S T segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is the most severe of the acute coronary syndromes (ACS). It is defined by characteristic symptoms of myocardial ischaemia in association with persistent electrocardiographic ST segment elevation and release of biomarkers of myocardial necrosis. It usually indicates complete blockage of a coronary artery with thrombus following acute plaque rupture.

### Symptoms and signs (Figure 45.1)

The typical presentation of STEMI is with sudden onset central or retrosternal chest pain, which may radiate down the left arm or to the neck or jaw. There may be associated breathlessness, nausea or vomiting. The pain occurs at rest or with minimal exertion and typically lasts longer than 20 min and is not relieved by glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) spray.

The patient will appear anxious and in distress. The heart rate may be normal or demonstrate a tachycardia or bradycardia. The blood pressure is usually normal but if the infarct is severe enough to cause cardiogenic shock, the systolic BP will be by definition below 90 mmHg. The rest of the cardiovascular examination may be unremarkable, but there may be a third or fourth heart sound on auscultation as well as a new and/or worsening murmur and bibasal crackles indicating pulmonary oedema. Patients can also present in cardiac arrest.

## Investigations

• **ECG** (Figure 45.1): ECG changes associated with myocardial infarction (MI) indicate the area of the heart which has infarcted. In STEMI there is ST segment elevation of at least 2.5 mm in men aged under 40 years; at least 2 mm ST segment elevation in men aged 40 years and older or at least 1.5 mm in women in leads V2–V3 and/or at least 1 mm in the other leads. A posterior STEMI resulting from an acutely occluded circumflex artery is indicated by ST segment depression in leads V1–V3. New left

- bundle branch block in the context of an appropriate clinical presentation should be treated as a STEMI equivalent.
- Cardiac biomarkers: STEMI is unique in the acute coronary syndromes in that it is diagnosed on clinical presentation and ECG alone without the need to wait for the serum troponin result.

#### **Immediate management** (Figure 45.1)

At the point of first medical contact the patient is assessed by brief history and clinical examination, and is connected to an ECG monitor with defibrillation capacity. A 12 lead ECG is recorded. To prevent further platelet aggregation 300 mg chewable aspirin and 180 mg ticagrelor are given. GTN is sprayed underneath the tongue. Oxygen is given if the peripheral saturations are less than 90%. Morphine, which has vasodilator properties, together with an antiemetic (e.g. metoclopramide) is administered to relieve pain and anxiety, thus reducing the tachycardia that these cause. The gold standard treatment of STEMI is emergent revascularisation with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI; see Chapter 43) of the culprit vessel within 2 h of symptom onset. Revascularisation allows reperfusion, which limits infarct size and reduces the risk of complications such as arrhythmias and heart failure.

Not every acute hospital is a PCI centre. Those that are not are affiliated with centres that are and protocols exist to enable the rapid transfer of patients. If the anticipated time from diagnosis of STEMI to PCI-mediated reperfusion is greater than 120 minutes, the alternative treatment is immediate **thrombolysis**. This is pharmacological dissolution of the clot with **thrombolytic agents** (e.g alteplase and tenecteplase) within 12 h of presentation unless contraindicated (see below). Thrombolytic agents induce **fibrinolysis**, which is the fragmentation of the fibrin strands holding the clot together. The main risk of thrombolysis is bleeding, particularly intracerebral haemorrhage, which occurs in ~1% of cases. Contraindications to thrombolysis therefore include recent haemorrhagic stroke, recent surgery or trauma, and severe hypertension. If thrombolysis fails to restore perfusion, the patient must be sent for rescue PCI to be performed as soon as possible.

#### **Subsequent management** (Figure 45.1)

Following treatment with PCI, the patient is admitted to the **coronary care unit** where they are closely monitored. An echocardiogram is performed to assess left ventricular systolic function, which may be moderately or severely impaired in the case of a large territory infarct. The patient has already been started on **dual antiplatelet therapy** (aspirin and ticagrelor) and further **secondary prevention** medications are added to reduce the risk of reinfarction. These are the same medications that are given in

cases of non-ST segment elevation ACS (Chapter 42). They are a  $\beta$ -blocker such as bisoprolol, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) such as ramipril, plus the mineralocorticoid antagonist eplerenone if the left ventricle (LV) ejection fraction is equal to or less than 40%, and high dose statin. The EPHESUS study in 2003 demonstrated that in patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular dysfunction, the addition of eplerenone to standard medical therapy reduced mortality. Cardiac risk factors such as smoking, diabetes and hypertension are addressed. The patient is referred to cardiac rehabilitation after discharge from hospital. This is a programme of exercise and education sessions that permit patients to get back to everyday life as successfully as possible.

# **Complications of acute myocardial infarction**

Complications of acute MI are either mechanical or arrhythmic.

With large infarcts, depression of pump function is sufficient to cause **cardiac failure**. An infarct involving more than 40% of the LV causes **cardiogenic shock**. It is heralded by a large fall in cardiac output, pulmonary congestion and hypotension. The mortality is extremely high. Treatment involves  $O_2$  to prevent hypoxaemia and positive inotropes (e.g. the  $\beta_1$ -agonist dobutamine) to aid myocardial contractility. Revascularization is crucial. An **intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP)** can be used temporarily to support the circulation. A catheter-mounted balloon is inserted via the femoral artery and positioned in the descending thoracic aorta. The balloon is inflated during diastole, increasing the pressure in the aortic arch and thereby improving perfusion of the coronary and cerebral arteries. During systole, deflation of the balloon creates a suction effect that reduces ventricular afterload and promotes systemic perfusion.

Rupture of the LV free wall is almost always fatal. Rupture of the ventricular septum creates a ventricular septal defect (VSD) and may result in leakage of blood between the ventricles. Rupture of the myocardium underlying a papillary muscle, or more rarely of the papillary muscle itself, may cause mitral regurgitation, detected clinically as a pansystolic murmur radiating to the axilla. Dressler's syndrome is the triad of pericarditis, pericardial effusion and fever. It is believed to be an autoimmune-mediated reaction to myocardial antigens produced after an MI.

Arrhythmias in the acute phase include the potentially life-threatening broad complex (QRS duration >0.12 s) tachycardias, ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF). Supraventricular arrhythmias include atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation. Bradyarrhythmias are also common, especially in inferior infarcts, as the right coronary artery supplies the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. Infarct expansion (see Chapter 44) is a dangerous late complication.
