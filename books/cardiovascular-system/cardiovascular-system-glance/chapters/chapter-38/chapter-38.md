## **Mechanisms of primary hypertension**

![](_page_0_Figure_4.jpeg)

n most people with **hypertension** (high arterial blood pressure; ABP), the condition is idiopathic (i.e. of unknown or uncertain cause) and is referred to as **essential** or **primary hypertension** (PH). **Secondary hypertension**, which is less common, arises due to an identifiable cause (e.g. hyperaldosteronism, renal disease, monogenic hypertension).

Population studies show that average systolic blood pressure (SBP) increases progressively throughout adulthood, whereas diastolic blood pressure (DBP) increases until midlife (40-59 years) and then declines. Thus, the majority of those beyond middle age suffer from isolated systolic hypertension (see Chapters 19 and 39). Often, however, PH develops earlier in life and is associated with increases in both SBP and DBP. This type of PH is a complex genetic disease in which an interaction between genetic variability and certain lifestyle and environmental factors (e.g. a high salt diet, psychosocial stress) results in the dysfunction of control systems regulating BP, causing it to rise. Genetic variability occurs because genes can exist in alternative forms (alleles), which have arisen as a result of mutation and become widespread in the population. There appear to be hundreds of genes which have commonly occurring alleles that cause tiny increases in ABP, such that inheriting enough of these would predispose to hypertension. Large genome-wide association scans have begun to identify many such genes. These include ATP2B1, which codes for the plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (see Chapter 15), and UMOD, which codes for uromodulin, a protein expressed in the thick ascending loop of Henle that is thought to regulate Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption. This type of polygenetic inheritance can be contrasted with **monogenic** or **Mendelian** hypertension, in which a mutation affecting only one protein raises ABP because that protein plays a very important role in controlling ABP. One example of monogenic hypertension is **Liddle syndrome**, in which mutation of the mineralocorticoid-sensitive Na<sup>+</sup> channel (ENaC) impairs renal Na<sup>+</sup> excretion.

Although the precise details of how genetic and other factors interact to cause PH are unknown and doubtless differ between individuals, extensive research over more than a century has given rise to a number of models designed to explain how ABP regulation may go awry. A simplified integration of some of these ideas is shown in Figure 38.1.

Guyton's model of hypertension: The kidneys regulate long-term ABP by controlling the body's Na<sup>+</sup> content (see Chapter 29). Guyton and colleagues proposed in the 1970s that hypertension is initiated by renal dysfunction leading to impaired or inadequate Na<sup>+</sup> excretion, which manifests as a rightward shift of the pressure-natriuresis curve (see Figure 29.4). The resulting Na<sup>+</sup> retention increases blood volume and therefore CO and ABP. The increased ABP then promotes Na<sup>+</sup> excretion by causing pressure natriuresis and reducing the activity of the RAA system. Whole body Na<sup>+</sup> balance is therefore restored, but at the cost of an increased ABP. Subsequently, the rise in ABP and blood volume sets in train autoregulatory processes resulting in long-term vasoconstriction

and/or vascular structural remodelling. This would reduce blood volume to normal levels, but by raising total peripheral resistance (TPR) would maintain the high ABP needed for Na<sup>+</sup> balance.

Two key findings supporting the concept that dysfunctional renal Na $^+$  handling is of paramount importance in causing hypertension are that (i) the ABP of hypertensive patients falls when they receive a kidney transplanted from a normotensive individual, and (ii) monogenic hypertension syndromes almost always involve abnormal renal Na $^+$  excretion. Moreover, a considerable body of evidence indicates that in many people an overactivity of the RAA system, which has a crucial role in regulating renal Na $^+$  excretion, may be responsible for the defect in renal Na $^+$  excretion proposed by Guyton. Interestingly, the kidney has its own renin–angiotensin system which is regulated independently of the RAA system in the rest of the body. Studies with mice in which the AT $_1$  receptor was knocked out only in the kidney suggest that it is this 'intra-renal' RAA system which may be of predominant importance in causing hypertension, although whether this is also true in humans is unknown.

In essence, this 'renocentric' model of PH pathogenesis depends on a very tight coupling between ABP and Na<sup>+</sup> excretion. Although it is accepted by many, it is coming under increasing attack in light of recent evidence that changes in ABP can occur independently of Na<sup>+</sup> excretion and vice versa.

Neurohormonal models of PH are based around the concept that long-term perturbations in ABP are due to abnormalities in neurological and hormonal control systems that have widespread actions on both the cardiovascular system and the kidneys. For example, some believe that PH in many patients is primarily due to dysfunction of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). This view is supported by evidence that the SNS is overactive in ~50% of hypertensives. Recent clinical trials also show that decreasing sympathetic outflow chronically using barostimulation (electrical stimulation of the carotid sinus baroreceptors via implanted electrodes), causes a sustained fall in ABP in many PH patients. Similarly, imidazoline receptor agonists such as moxonidine, which act in the brain to reduce sympathetic outflow, effectively lower ABP (see Chapter 39). Overactivity of the SNS could potentially be caused by chronic stress and/or a variety of factors that have been shown to stimulate areas of the brainstem that control sympathetic outflow; these include angiotensin 2, inflammation, hypoxia, elevated reactive oxygen species, and endogenous ouabain (see below).

There are a variety of mechanisms by which overactivity of the SNS could raise ABP, since sympathetic nerves innervate not only the heart and the vasculature, but also the kidneys, in which sympathetic stimulation activates the RAA system and causes Na+ retention. There is evidence in some animal models of hypertension (e.g. obese dogs) that it is the renal effects of the SNS overactivity that raise ABP. However in other animal models of hypertension (e.g. rats infused with angiotensin 2 and fed a high salt diet) the increase in ABP persists if the renal sympathetic nerve supply is cut but is prevented by denervation of the sympathetic supply to the splanchnic vascular bed (the blood vessels in the GI tract, liver and spleen). This has led to the proposal by Osborne and colleagues that the body counters increases in ABP by reducing sympatheticallymediated constriction of splanchnic arteries (thus decreasing TPR) and veins (thus decreasing central venous pressure and therefore CO). The suggestion is that these responses, which would successfully stabilize ABP in normotensives, are deficient in those with PH, thereby rendering the body unable to control the ABP properly.

*The natriuretic factor hypothesis* De Wardener and others have proposed that the body responds to inadequate renal salt excretion by

producing one or more **natriuretic factors** (not to be confused with **atrial natriuretic peptide**; see Chapter 29) which promote salt excretion by inhibiting the Na $^+$ -K $^+$ -ATPase in the nephron. Although this effect would be expected to reduce ABP, the Na $^+$ -K $^+$ -ATPase is also indirectly involved in lowering intracellular Ca $^{2+}$ , via regulation of both the membrane potential and Na $^+$ -Ca $^{2+}$  exchange, in smooth muscle cells and neurons. By blocking these effects of the Na $^+$ -K $^+$ -ATPase, natriuretic factors would cause additional responses such as vasoconstriction and increased norepinephrine release which would increase TPR, thereby causing hypertension. There is evidence that one such factor, **endogenous ouabain**, is synthesized in the adrenal glands and also in the hypothalamus, where it acts to increase sympathetic drive. Plasma levels of endogenous ouabain and **marinobufagenin**, another natriuretic factor that inhibits the Na $^+$ -K $^+$ -ATPase, are elevated in plasma taken from many hypertensives.

**Insulin resistance** is a condition in which the body becomes less responsive to the actions of the hormone *insulin*, leading to a compensatory rise in plasma insulin levels. Both insulin resistance and obesity, with which it is often associated, are very common in hypertensives. There is evidence that excessive insulin can cause multiple effects on the body which could promote hypertension, including activation of the sympathetic nervous system, increased renal Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption and reduced endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. Obesity has also been shown to have a leptin-induced effect on the hypothalamus which stimulates the SNS.

## Vascular remodelling

Established hypertension is associated with the *structural alteration* of small arteries and larger arterioles. This process, termed **remodelling**, results in the narrowing of these vessels and an increase in the ratio of wall thickness to luminal radius. Remodelling is proposed to be an adaptive mechanism which would reduce vascular wall stress (see the Laplace/Frank law; Chapter 18) and protect the microcirculation from increased ABP. However, it would also 'lock in' vascular narrowing and the resulting increase in TPR. Remodelling may also be enhanced by overactivation of the RAA and sympathetic nervous systems, which is known to promote smooth muscle cell growth.

Remodelling will increase basal TPR and also exaggerate any increase in TPR caused by vasoconstriction. In addition, studies in *spontaneously hypertensive rats* indicate that remodelling of renal afferent arterioles may contribute to hypertension by interfering with renal Na<sup>+</sup> excretion.

## **Secondary hypertension**

In those with secondary hypertension, high ABP is caused by an identifiable condition or factor. Common causes include:

- 1 *Endocrine disturbances*, often of the adrenal cortex, and associated with oversecretion of aldosterone, cortisol and/or catecholamines,
- **2** *Renal parenchymal* and *renovascular diseases*, which impair volume regulation and/or activate the RAA system,
- **3** *Oral contraceptives*, which may raise ABP via RAA activation and hyperinsulinaemia.

It has been argued that hypertension associated with obesity should also be viewed as secondary, as the link between these two conditions are now very well established.

**Malignant** or accelerated hypertension is an uncommon condition that develops quickly, involves large elevations in pressure, is often secondary to other conditions, rapidly damages the kidneys, retina, brain and heart, and if untreated causes death within 1–2 years.
