# **Treatment of chronic heart failure**

![](_page_0_Figure_4.jpeg)

reatment of chronic heart failure (CHF) is designed to (i) improve the quality of life by reducing symptoms, (ii) lengthen survival, and (iii) slow the progression of cardiac deterioration.

The **sympathetic** and **renin-angiotensin-aldosterone** (RAA) systems activated in response to reduced pump function initially help to maintain cardiac output but also drive the progression of cardiac deterioration (Chapter 46). Therapy mainly involves inhibiting these systems (Figure 47.1) using an **angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor** (**ACEI**) and a  $\beta$ -blocker, which together slow CHF progression, lengthen survival time and improve haemodynamics. **Angiotensin receptor blockers** (**ARBs**) are used as an alternative in ACEI-intolerant patients, and an ACEI-ARB combination can be used in  $\beta$ -blocker intolerant patients. **Sacubitril/valsartan**, a combination of an ARB and a neprilysin inhibitor, can be given in place of an ACEI or ARB (or their combination).

**Diuretics** are used to control fluid accumulation and the positive inotrope **digoxin** may be used to support cardiac function. In severe

or refractory CHF, or when existing therapy fails to control symptoms adequately, an **aldosterone antagonist** such as spironolactone is recommended. In intensive care settings, positive inotropes such as **dobutamine**, **dopamine** or **milrinone** may be used temporarily if decompensation (an acute worsening of heart failure) occurs, as can **intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation** (Chapter 45).

#### **ACEI and other vasodilators**

Clinical trials in the 1980s showed that although vasodilation per se did not lengthen survival in CHF, certain vasodilating drugs did have this effect. The most effective of these was the ACEI captopril. It later emerged that ACEI were improving survival because the stimulation of angiotensin 2 production which occurs in CHF is an important cause of the cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis which drive the progression of this condition. However, the vasodilating and diuretic properties of ACEI are also beneficial because they

help to reduce symptoms. Angiotensin 2 causes vasoconstriction and promotes fluid retention via multiple mechanisms (Chapter 29). ACEI, which inhibit the conversion of angiotensin 1 to angiotensin 2, therefore dilate arteries and veins, and reduce blood volume. Arterial vasodilatation decreases afterload and cardiac work and improves tissue perfusion by increasing stroke volume and cardiac output. Venous dilatation and reduction of fluid retention diminish pulmonary congestion, oedema and central venous pressure (CVP) (preload). Reduction of preload lowers ventricular filling pressure, therefore lowering cardiac wall stress, workload and ischaemia.

Angiotensin (AT1 ) receptor blockers such as **valsartan** are used in patients unable to tolerate ACEI due to dry cough or angioedema. The 2003 VALIANT study showed that valsartan was as effective as captopril in providing a morbidity and mortality benefit in people who had suffered a recent MI and showed signs of developing heart failure.

In 2014, the PARADIGM‐HF trial reported that combining valsartan with **sacubitril**, a **neprilysin inhibitor**, prolonged survival of CHF patients and caused less renal dysfunction and hyperkalaemia compared to the ACEI enalapril. Neprilysin, a neutral endopeptidase which is highly expressed in the kidneys, breaks down natriuretic peptides, bradykinin and substance P. By increasing the bioavailability of these peptides, its inhibition causes natriuresis, vasodilation and a reduction in ventricular remodelling. Approved in 2015, this angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) can be used instead of an ARB or ACEI in patients with mild‐moderate CHF and a ventricular ejection fraction of ≤40%.

The combination of the vasodilators **isosorbide dinitrate** (Chapter 41) and **hydralazine** can be used instead of an ACEI or ARB for patients in whom these drugs are not tolerated or in patients of Afro‐Caribbean descent. The 2004 A‐HeFT trial showed that in black patients, compared to placebo, isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine caused a 43% relative risk reduction in all‐cause mortality. The survival benefit of this drug combination probably arises due to nitric oxide release by isosorbide dinitrate.

## **β**‐receptor blockers

β‐blockers have a strong evidence base in CHF and all patients with LVEF <40% should receive a β‐blocker. The 1999 CIBIS‐II trial showed that the addition of the β<sup>1</sup> ‐cardioselective agent **bisoprolol** to standard therapy (ACEI/other vasodilator plus diuretic) improved mortality. **Carvedilol,** a non‐selective β‐blocker that also has α‐antagonist and antioxidant properties, was shown in the 2003 COMET trial to extend survival in patients already being treated with ACEI and diuretics

Long‐term treatment with β‐blockers increases ejection fraction, reduces systolic and diastolic volume, and eventually causes regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. Other beneficial effects of β‐blockers in CHF probably include reduced ischaemia and a reduction in heart rate, thus improving myocardial perfusion, inhibition of the deleterious effects of excess catecholamines on myocardial structure and metabolism, and reduction of cytokine release. β‐blockers appear to be particularly effective in reducing sudden death in those with CHF, suggesting that the prevention of ventricular fibrillation (Chapters and 52) constitutes an important part of their action.

The negative inotropic effect of β‐blockers is potentially hazardous in some patients with CHF, because cardiac function is already compromised. Therapy is therefore initiated with low doses which are carefully uptitrated over several weeks or months.

#### Aldosterone antagonists

Aldosterone levels initially fall during ACEI treatment but often rise again ('escape') during prolonged treatment. Aldosterone has a number of effects that worsen CHF and its consequences: inducing cardiac fibrosis and remodelling, reducing nitric oxide release, increasing Na+ retention, and promoting arrhythmias by decreasing plasma K+ and cardiac noradrenaline release.

The aldosterone antagonist **spironolactone** was shown in the 1999 RALES trial to reduce mortality when added to ACEI in severe CHF. Its use is recommended in patients with more severe heart failure and good renal function. As it can cause hyperkalaemia, careful monitoring of plasma K+ levels is important. Spironolactone also causes antiandrogenic side effects such as gynaecomastia. The more selective aldosterone antagonist **eplerenone** is also available and has fewer side effects.

**Ivabradine** dose‐dependently reduces the heart rate by selectively blocking the *I***<sup>f</sup>** ("funny") current that controls spontaneous depolarisation in the sinus node. The 2010 SHIFT study showed that adding ivabradine to standard therapy significantly reduced mortality.

#### Diuretics

Diuretics reduce fluid accumulation by increasing renal salt and water excretion. Preload, pulmonary congestion and systemic oedema are thereby relieved. **Loop diuretics** inhibit the Na+–K+– 2Cl− symport in the ascending loop of Henle. Na+ and Cl− reabsorption is thereby inhibited, and the retention of these ions in the tubule promotes fluid loss in the urine. Diuretics commonly used in heart failure include **furosemide** and **bumetanide**. Thiazide and thiazide‐like diuretics (Chapter 38), particularly **metolazone**, are sometimes combined with a loop diuretic.

Both loop and thiazide diuretics can cause hypokalaemia (low plasma K+) and metabolic alkalosis because some of the Na+ they cause to be retained in the tubular fluid is reabsorbed in exchange for K+ and H+ in the distal nephron. This process is stimulated by aldosterone (see Chapter 29), and diuretic‐induced hypokalaemia can therefore be prevented by an ACEI or an aldosterone antagonist. Hypokalaemia can also be treated with K+ supplements, or by using **K**<sup>+</sup>**‐sparing diuretics** such as **amiloride** or **triamterene** which inhibit Na+ reabsorption and K+ secretion in the collecting duct. Long‐term use of loop diuretics can result in hypovolaemia, reduced plasma Mg2+, Ca2+ and Na+, and hyperuricaemia and hyperglycaemia. This is more common in the elderly, who may require high doses of diuretics to overcome **diuretic resistance**.

#### Cardiac glycosides

Cardiac glycosides such as digoxin improve symptoms but do not prolong life. They work by inhibiting the Na+ pump in cardiac muscle, thereby increasing intracellular [Na+]. This reduces Ca2+ extrusion by the Na+–Ca2+ antiport (Chapter 12) and thus increases intracellular [Ca2+]. The rise in Ca2+ enhances cardiac contractility and shortens action potential duration and refractory period in atrial and ventricular cells by stimulating K+ channels. Digoxin also increases baroreceptor responsiveness, thereby reducing sympathetic tone.

Digoxin also acts on the nervous system to increase vagal tone. This slows sinoatrial node (SAN) activity and reduces atrioventricular node (AVN) conduction and can be useful in treating atrial arrhythmias (Chapters 49 and 52). It is therefore mainly used in patients with both CHF and atrial fibrillation.

Even a small (two‐ to threefold) excess of digoxin over the optimal therapeutic concentration can cause arrhythmias. This occurs because an excessive rise in [Ca2+]i causes oscillations in membrane potential after action potentials. These **delayed afterdepolarizations** (Chapter 48) can trigger ectopic beats and at higher doses can cause ventricular tachycardia. Inhibition of the Na+ pump also decreases intracellular K+, causing depolarization and facilitating arrhythmias. In addition, excess digoxin can increase vagal tone enough to block conduction at the AVN and can also raise sympathetic tone, again favouring arrhythmias. Digoxin toxicity is enhanced by hypokalaemia, because K+ decreases the affinity of digoxin for the Na+ pump. Digoxin causes toxic gastrointestinal effects, including anorexia, nausea and vomiting. Acute toxicity can be treated with intravenous K+ , antiarrhythmics (e.g. lidocaine) and digoxin‐specific antibodies (Digibind).

### Device therapy in CHF

**Implantable cardiac defibrillators** are indicated in patients with poor LV ejection fraction (<35%) who are at increased risk of sudden cardiac death due to ventricular arrythmias (Chapter 50). **Cardiac resynchronization therapy,** involving implantation of a pacemaker that stimulates both ventricles to contract simultaneously, is also used in patients with moderate to severe CHF and evidence of asynchronous ventricular contraction.

A **left ventricular assist device (LVAD)** (a pump that takes over part or all of the heart's pumping action) can serve as a bridge for patients awaiting cardiac transplant or as a destination device to lengthen survival if transplant is not possible.
