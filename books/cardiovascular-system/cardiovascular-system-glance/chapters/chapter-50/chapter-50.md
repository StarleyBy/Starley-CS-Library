The first two and final complexes originate in the sino-atrial node (SAN) as they are preceded by a P wave. The 3rd complex is a PAC originating at a site other than the SAN, as shown by the abnormal P wave, which is buried within the T wave of the preceding beat (red arrow).

AT accounts for 5—10% of cases of supraventricular tachycardia. The impulse originates in atrial tissue separate to the sinoatrial node and can be either left atrial or right atrial in origin. It does not require the atrioventricular node for its initiation and maintenance.

There are characteristic fluer waves present as a "saw tooth" baseline. In typical atrial fluer these are best seen in the inferior leads (II, III, aVF). In this example, every other fluer wave is triggering a QRS complex (fluer with 2:1 AV block). Fluer waves are generated by a macro reentrant rhythm in the right atrium in an anticlockwise paern involving the cavo-tricuspid isthmus.

with normal QRS complexes. The atria are activated retrogradely since the impulse originates from the AV node. The P wave may be obscured by the QRS complex, or, as shown in Figure 50.4.1 (left), may occur as a small R wave in Lead I (termed an rSR' paern) which is not present in the normal ECG (Figure 50.4.2, right).

The PR interval is short and there is a characteristic slurred upstroke to the QRS complex, termed a delta wave. These are present because the atrial impulse is conducted early to the ventricles via an accessory pathway. This ECG paern occurring with palpitations is termed the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.

In this case, AF has conducted to the ventricles down the accessory pathway resulting in an extraordinarily rapid ventricular rate which can degenerate to ventricular fibrillation.

achyarrhythmias are abnormalities in the origin, timing or sequence of cardiac depolarization that result in a heart rate of >100 beats/min, respectively. They may be **supraventricular**, in which case they arise in either the atria or the atrioventricular node (AVN) or **ventricular** in origin (see Chapter 51).

**Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)** is an umbrella term describing all tachycardias which originate above the His-Purkinje system. The differential diagnosis for SVT is broad and includes sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation (AF), atrial flutter, AV node re-entry tachycardia (AVNRT), AV re-entry tachycardia (AVRT), and atrial tachycardia. SVTs are rarely life threatening, but they can cause serious haemodynamic compromise and cardiac sequelae (e.g. tachycardiomyopathy, heart failure) if not treated.

**Premature atrial complexes** (PACs; Figure 50.1) are caused by **ectopic** (i.e. originating from a site other than the SAN) depolarizations. The commonest sites of origination are in and around the pulmonary veins where they insert into the left atrium. They are typically conducted to the ventricles to cause a premature beat, which is generally followed by a pause. The P wave is abnormally shaped because atrial contraction is not generated in the SAN.

Atrial tachycardia (Figure 50.2), characterized by a heart rate of 120–240 beats/min, is frequently caused by an ectopic pacemaker, and can arise in either atrium (e.g. often close to the pulmonary veins in the left atrium). Other atrial tachycardias are re-entrant in nature, frequently following surgery that involves incision into the atrium. The tachycardia may start and stop suddenly or gradually. As with atrial ectopics, the P wave is abnormally shaped.

Atrial flutter results from re-entry in an atrium (usually the right), often with an area of slowed conduction near the orifice of the inferior vena cava and a circuit involving the whole atrium. The atrial rate is typically ~300 beats/min. The ECG has a 'sawtooth' appearance due to the presence of rapid regular F waves representing atrial depolarization; these become more obvious if AVN conduction and the QRS complex are suppressed, for example, by adenosine. As shown in Figure 50.3, the AVN is often able to conduct only every other atrial impulse (2:1 AV block) to the ventricles because it is still refractory from the previous impulse so that the ventricular rate is typically ~150 beats/min. Less commonly, 3:1 or 4:1 block can occur, leading to correspondingly slower rates of ventricular contraction. Atrial flutter is typically seen in patients with underlying cardiac disease, often associated with atrial dilatation. It is particularly common in older hypertensive patients and may also be caused by acute pulmonary thromboembolism or thyrotoxicosis, but can also develop paroxysmally in patients without underlying heart disease (e.g. secondary to infection or alcohol excess). Attempts to cardiovert (restore normal sinus rhythm) atrial flutter with class IA drugs (see Chapter 52) may cause severe ventricular tachycardia and sudden death by establishing 1:1 AVN conduction. This occurs because these drugs suppress vagal firing, thereby increasing AVN conduction. This hazard is avoided by pre-administering a drug that suppresses AVN conduction (e.g. a β-blocker).

Atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT) (Figure 50.4) and atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia (AVRT)

result in periodic episodes during which the heart rate abruptly increases to beats/min, and they are therefore referred to as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias. Individuals with AVNRT have an additional or accessory conduction pathway between the atrium and the AVN. In most cases, the normal AV pathway (termed α) conducts rapidly and has a long refractory period, whereas the accessory (β) pathway conducts slowly and has a short refractory period. In these individuals, AVNRT can be initiated by a premature impulse arising in an atrium. This impulse will not be conducted by the  $\alpha$  pathway if it is still refractory from the preceding impulse. However, the impulse may travel slowly down the β pathway (which has recovered from the preceding impulse) and then encounter the distal end of the  $\alpha$  pathway. Sufficient time has now elapsed for this pathway to be no longer refractory, and the impulse is able to ascend the  $\alpha$  pathway in a *retrograde* (backwards) direction, allowing it to return to the atrium. From here it can continue to cycle through the  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$  pathways, exciting the ventricles to cause a heartbeat with each circuit. An abnormal P wave is also generated each time the impulse cycles through the atrium. This immediately follows the QRS complex because the re-entrant circuit, and thus the cycle time, is very short (compare Figures 50.4.1) and 50.4.2).

An accessory pathway allowing impulse conduction between an atrium and ventricle also exists in AVRT, but in this case it is not located within the AVN. Those in whom this pathway can conduct impulses in both directions may develop Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) or pre-excitation syndrome, the mechanism of which is described in Chapter 48. When the individual is in normal sinus rhythm, the atrial impulse is conducted in an anterograde (forward) direction through both the accessory pathway and the AVN. Because it is conducted more quickly through the accessory pathway, excitation of part of one ventricle occurs more quickly than normal (i.e. pre-excitation occurs), resulting in a shortened PR interval and an initial widening of the QRS complex referred to as a delta wave (Figure 50.5). During the tachycardia, however, the accessory pathway conducts in the retrograde direction (see Chapter 48) and so pre-excitation does not occur. Instead, premature P waves (often superimposed on the T wave) caused by rapid excitation of the atria by the retrograde impulse are observed. This type of accessory pathway is particularly dangerous in people with atrial fibrillation, because it is often better at conducting rapid impulses than the AVN because of its shorter refractory period. Thus, the AVN 'filter' which protects the ventricles from high-frequency atrial activity is bypassed, and the ventricular rate becomes very fast. In this condition, termed pre-excited AF (see Chapter 49), the ECG shows rapid and irregular QRS complexes, the majority of which are widened by pre-excitation (Figure 50.6).

Less common forms of AVRT also exist. In *antidromic* AVRT, the accessory pathway conducts in an anterograde direction during the tachycardia. In other cases, the accessory pathway is capable of conducting only in the retrograde direction. Thus, pre-excitation does not occur, and the bypass pathway is said to be *concealed*.
