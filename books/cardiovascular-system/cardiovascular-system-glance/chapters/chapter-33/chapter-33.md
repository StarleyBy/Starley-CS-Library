here is an array of imaging techniques available to cardiologists.

Chest radiograph (CXR) The CXR is ideally taken in the posteroanterior (PA) direction, with the patient upright and at full inspiration. Figure 33.1 shows the major structures in which abnormalities can be detected, such as enlargement of the heart chambers and major vessels, and a normal PA CXR. Heart size and cardiothoracic ratio (size of heart relative to thoracic cavity) can also be estimated. This ratio is normally <50%, except in infants and athletes, for example, due to mitral valve disease, but may be greatly increased in heart failure (Figure 33.2 and Chapters 46 and 55).

**Transthoracic echocardiography** is the most widely used imaging modality in cardiology as it is noninvasive and can be performed quickly at the bedside. It provides a wealth of structural and functional information, that is, quantification of chamber size, location

of areas of reduced contractility, estimation of left ventricular ejection fraction, detection of valvular disease, abnormalities in blood flow such as regurgitation, and detection of pericardial effusion. Echocardiography uses ultrasound to produce images. An ultrasound pulse of 1–10 MHz is emitted from piezoelectric crystals inside a transducer which is moved by the operator on the chest wall. The ultrasound waves are reflected back by internal structures and processed to generate the real time image.

**Transoesophageal echocardiography** (TOE). A specialised probe with an ultrasound transducer at its tip is passed into the patient's oesophagus. This provides greater resolution (Figure 33.3) and improved access to the pulmonary artery, aorta and atria. The commonest indications for TOE are to confirm the presence of a vegetation or other mass that may have been identified during a transthoracic echocardiogram and to assess valves prior to surgery.

**Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE)** is used in patients with angina to see how the heart performs under stress induced by the intravenously administered β1 agonist dobutamine, which increases contractility and cardiac output. DSE is used to diagnose the location and severity of ischaemia. Patients with a moderate to high burden of ischaemia are then offered invasive coronary angiography.

**Cardiac CT** There are two modalities of cardiac CT: coronary artery calcium score (CAC), which quantifies coronary artery calcification, and CT coronary angiography (CTCA), which provides 3D visualisation of the coronary arteries and any obstructive CAD. A normal CAC is zero, indicating that the patient has no calcified atheroma that can be resolved by the test. Patients with a calcium score of >100 are offered invasive coronary angiography as high CAC scores are an independent predictor of myocardial infarction and death. CTCA is useful in the exclusion of coronary artery disease in low‐risk patients.

**Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR)** is an advanced imaging modality for the functional and anatomical assessment of many diseases of the cardiovascular system. The commonest indications are the assessment of myocardial ischaemia and viability, heart failure, cardiomyopathies and congenital heart disease. Radiofrequency stimulation of protons held in a strong magnetic field emits energy which can be used to generate a high resolution image that reflects tissue density. Unlike CT and nuclear imaging, CMR uses no ionising radiation. Gadolinium‐based contrast agents are administered to detect areas of infarcted and viable myocardium in symptomatic patients and so guide revascularisation. Gadolinium has a rapid washout period in healthy tissue, which appears black on the images obtained. Conversely, infarcted nonviable tissue demonstrates delayed washout and the tissue appears white; this is termed late gadolinium enhancement (Figure 33.4).

**Nuclear imaging** The main application for nuclear imaging is to detect ischaemia. Radiopharmaceuticals introduced into the circulation are detected by a gamma camera, and their distribution can be used to measure or detect cardiac muscle perfusion, damage and function. 3D information can be obtained in a similar fashion using single photon emission computed tomography (**SPECT**). The nuclear tracers are distributed according to perfusion and taken up by cardiac myocytes. These show up brightly immediately after infusion; ischaemic and infarcted areas remain dark because of poor perfusion.

**Coronary angiography** is the most sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of obstructive coronary artery disease. The commonest indication is for diagnosis of coronary artery disease in symptomatic patients. The aortic root gives off two branches which supply the heart. These are the left main stem (also called the left coronary artery) and the right coronary artery. The left main stem bifurcates into the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and the left circumflex artery (LCx), which supply the anterior and posterolateral left ventricle. The right coronary artery (RCA) supplies the right heart and the inferior wall of the left ventricle. A catheter introduced via the radial or femoral artery is guided under fluoroscopy into the aortic root. The operator then manipulates the catheter into the left main stem and a syringe with contrast dye is attached to the end of the catheter. Contrast is then injected directly into the left main stem and its branches. Images are then taken and stored (Figure 33.5). A separate catheter designed to access the RCA is then used to take images of the RCA and its branches.

**Intracoronary imaging** allows realtime visualisation of plaques inside coronary arteries. There are two techniques: **intravascular ultrasound** (IVUS) and **optical coherence tomography** (OCT). IVUS uses an ultrasound probe mounted on the end of a catheter which is positioned in the coronary artery of interest. It is able to show the lumen, intima, media and adventitia of that artery. This cross‐sectional view can assist in choosing the correct sized stent and in confirming that the stent is correctly positioned. OCT uses near infrared light instead of sound waves for image acquisition. Owing to the shorter wavelength of infrared light compared to ultrasound, OCT has a 10‐fold higher resolution than IVUS and is therefore able to provide higher quality imaging of the arterial wall.
