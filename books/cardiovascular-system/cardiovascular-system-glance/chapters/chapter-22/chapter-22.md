# 22 The venous system

![](_page_0_Figure_3.jpeg)

T he venules and veins convey the blood from the microcirculation to the right atrium. In doing so, they are subject to regulation by several mechanisms (Figure 22.1) that allow them to influence the right atrial pressure and therefore the cardiac output (see Chapter 17).

The venous system differs from the arterial system in two important respects. First, the total volume (and cross‐sectional area) of the venous system is much greater than that of the arterial system. This is because there are many more venules than arterioles; venules also tend to have larger internal diameters than arterioles. Second, the veins are quite thin walled and can therefore expand greatly to hold more blood if their internal pressure rises.

As a result of its large cross‐sectional area, the venous system offers much less resistance to flow than the arterial system. The pressure gradient required to drive the blood through the venous system (15 mmHg) is therefore much smaller than the pressure needed in the arterial system (80 mmHg). The average pressure in the venae cavae at the level of the heart (the **central venous pressure**) is usually close to 0 mmHg (i.e. atmospheric pressure). The flow of blood back to the heart is aided by the presence of one‐way **venous valves** in the arms and especially the legs, which prevent backflow.

## Venous and arterial compliance

Figure 22.2 illustrates the relationship between pressure and volume in a typical vein and artery. The slope of the volume–pressure curve is referred to as the **compliance**. Compliance is a measure of **expandability**. Veins are much more compliant than arteries at low pressures (0–10 mmHg). Small increases in venous pressure in this range therefore cause large increases in venous blood volume.

One result of high venous compliance is that their thin walls allow veins to collapse at low internal pressures. Only small increases in pressure are needed to 'reinflate' a collapsed vein with blood until it has nearly rounded up. At higher pressures, however, venous compliance decreases dramatically (see Figure 22.2) because the slack in rigid collagen fibres in the venous wall is rapidly taken up. This limit on the expandability of the veins is important in limiting the pooling of blood in the veins of the legs that occurs during standing.

# The veins as capacitance vessels

Because of their large volumes and high compliance, the veins/venules accommodate a much larger volume of the blood (60–70% of the total) than do the arteries/arterioles (∼12%). They are therefore termed **capacitance vessels** and are able to serve as blood volume reservoirs. During exercise, and in hypotensive states (e.g. during haemorrhage), sympathetically mediated constriction of the veins/ venules, notably in the splanchnic (including the gastrointestinal tract and liver) and cutaneous circulations, displaces blood into the rest of the cardiovascular system. In particular, the resulting reduction of the venous volume increases the volume of blood in the central thoracic compartment (i.e. the heart and pulmonary circulation), thereby boosting cardiac output, assisting perfusion of other essential vascular beds and helping to maintain the blood pressure.

## Effects of posture

When the upright position is assumed (orthostasis), the pull of gravity increases the absolute pressures within *both* the arteries and veins of the lower extremities. The average arterial and venous blood pressures in a normal adult standing quietly are about 100 and 2 mmHg, respectively, at the level of the heart, while in the feet the pressures are about 190 and 90 mmHg, respectively. However, gravity does not affect the *pressure gradient* driving the blood circulation, because the *difference* between the arterial and venous pressures is similar (100 mmHg) at both levels. Therefore standing does not stop blood from flowing back to the heart (Figure 22.1, left).

However, orthostasis does cause important haemodynamic effects. The increased pressure within the veins of the lower extremities causes them to distend, so that about 500 mL blood is shifted into this part of the circulation. The rise in hydrostatic pressure within the capillaries of the lower extremities increases fluid filtration, causing a progressive loss of plasma volume into the tissues of the legs and feet. The resulting loss of fluid from the central thoracic compartment lowers central venous pressure and therefore CO (see Chapter 17).

The fall in CO causes an immediate decrease in the pulse pressure and the mean arterial blood pressure (MABP). However, this is rapidly compensated for by activation of the baroreceptor and cardiopulmonary reflexes (see Chapter 27), which respond to the fall in both parameters by causing an *increased heart rate* and widespread constriction of the veins limits the loss of blood from the central thoracic compartment, and of the arteries/arterioles, causes a 30–40% increase in total peripheral resistance. Since the CO remains depressed by ~20%, the MABP (which is equal CO x TPR) is restored to a level slightly higher than it was before standing up. A local *sympathetic axon reflex* which is triggered by the increase in venous pressure also reduces blood flow and pressure in the lower extremities, limiting fluid filtration.

In the upright position, the reduction of intravascular pressures above the heart causes the partial collapse of superficial veins. This prevents their internal pressure from falling below zero, while allowing blood flow to continue. Deeper veins remain partly open because their walls are anchored to surrounding tissues. Standing also causes a downward displacement into the spinal canal of the cerebrospinal fluid bathing the central nervous system (CNS). This creates a negative pressure inside the rigid cranium that prevents cerebral veins from collapsing, such that their internal pressure falls below zero. However, because cerebral venous pressure is not able to fall as much as arterial pressure (see Figure 22.1), the pressure gradient driving blood flow above the heart decreases and cerebral blood flow falls by 10–20%.

# The skeletal muscle pump

Even during quiet standing, the leg muscles are stimulated by reflexes to contract and relax rhythmically, causing swaying. During contraction, veins within the muscles are squeezed, forcing blood towards the heart, as the venous valves prevent retrograde flow. Upon relaxation, these veins expand, drawing in blood from venules and from superficial veins that communicate with the muscle veins via collaterals (Figure 22.1). This *skeletal muscle pump* thus 'milks' the veins, driving blood towards the heart to assist venous return. The skeletal muscle pump is greatly potentiated during walking and running, dramatically lowering the venous pressure in the foot to levels as low as 30 mmHg. Functional incompetence of the valves in superficial tributary veins of the legs, which becomes more common with ageing, renders the skeletal muscle pump less effective. This exposes these vessels to higher internal pressures during orthostasis, causing them to become chronically dilated (**varicose veins**).

### The respiratory pump

During inspiration, downward displacement of the diaphragm causes the intrathoracic pressure to fall and the intra‐abdominal pressure to rise. This increases the pressure gradient favouring venous return, and vena caval flow rises. An opposite effect occurs during expiration. During straining movements in which there is forced expiration against a closed glottis (e.g. the Valsalva manoeuvre), the rise in intrathoracic pressure severely reduces venous return.

#### Effect of cardiac contraction

Downward displacement of the ventricles during systole pulls on the atria, expanding them and drawing in blood from the venae cavae and pulmonary veins. When the valves between the atria and ventricles then open during diastole, the blood is drawn in from these veins by the expansion of the ventricles, further aiding venous return. Venous return is therefore driven not only by the upstream pressure but also (to a smaller extent) by downstream suction.
