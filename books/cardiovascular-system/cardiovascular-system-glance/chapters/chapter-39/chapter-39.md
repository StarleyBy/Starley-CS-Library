### **Definition and implications of hypertension**

Hypertension is defined pragmatically as the level of arterial blood pressure (ABP) above which therapeutic intervention can be shown to reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Chronic hypertension causes changes in the arteries similar to those due to ageing, which include endothelial damage and arteriosclerosis, a thickening and increased connective tissue content of the arterial wall that reduces arterial compliance. These effects on vascular structure combine with elevated ABP pressure to promote atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, left ventricular hypertrophy and renal damage. Hypertension is therefore an important risk factor for myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke and renal failure. Risk increases progressively with both systolic and diastolic ABP levels. Epidemiological studies predict that a long-term mmHg diminution of diastolic arterial blood pressure (DBP) should reduce the incidence of stroke and CHD by about 40 and 25%, respectively. Isolated systolic hypertension (see Chapters 19 and 38) is particularly harmful to the brain and kidney since these organs have a relatively low vascular resistance; thus the increased blood pressure pulsatility which characterizes this type of hypertension penetrates deeply into their microcirculations, damaging them.

# Diagnosis and general management of hypertension

ABP measurements taken using sphygmomanometry can vary significantly, and current guidelines state that, unless severe (>180/110 mmHg with signs of retinal or optic nerve damage), hypertension (ABP >140/90 mmHg) initially detected in the clinic should be confirmed by measuring ambulatory ABP or using a home monitor which records ABP over a 24-hour period. Tests for damage to target organs vulnerable to hypertension (e.g. eyes, kidneys) and assessment of other cardiovascular risk factors should also be carried out. Treatment depends on hypertension stage (see Table 39.1) and other factors. Those with *stage 1* hypertension who are <80 years of age should be treated if they have overt cardiovascular disease, diabetes, target organ damage, renal disease or an overall cardiovascular risk of >20% per 10 years (as estimated using risk algorithms; see Chapter 34). Even if they lack additional risk factors, stage 1 hypertensives under 40 years of age may warrant investigation for secondary hypertension and target organ damage. Those of any age with stage 2 or severe hypertension should be treated. The goal of antihypertensive therapy is to reduce the blood pressure to below 135/85 mmHg for those under 80, 145/85 mmHg for those over 80, and 130/80 mmHg in diabetics and those with renal disease.

**Lifestyle modifications** such as *weight reduction, regular aerobic exercise* and *limitation of dietary sodium* and *alcohol intake* can often normalize pressure in mild hypertension. They are also useful adjuncts to pharmacological therapy of more severe disease, and have the important added bonus of reducing overall cardiovascular risk.

However, adequate ABP control usually requires the lifelong use of **antihypertensive drugs**. These ultimately act to reduce cardiac output (CO) and/or total peripheral resistance (TPR) (Figure 39.1).

**Stepped treatment:** Treatment of hypertension is typically initiated with a single drug, but combinations of several drugs are usually needed to achieve adequate blood pressure control. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis is more likely to be a contributing factor in causing hypertension in younger white patients, and so step 1 is to offer an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) to white patients <55 of age. A calcium-channel blocker (CCB) should be offered to black and older white hypertensives; if a CCB is contraindicated a thiazide-like diuretic should be offered instead. If this fails to control ABP, step 2 in all patients is to try a combination of a CCB (or diuretic) with an ACEI or ARB. If ABP is still not adequately controlled, step 3 is to offer an (ACEI or ARB)/CCB/diuretic combination. Low dose spironolactone or a higher dose of thiazide-like diuretic can be added to this combination as step 4, and if ABP is still too high an  $\alpha$ - or  $\beta$ -blocker can be tried. Drug selection is also influenced by whether coexisting considerations render a certain type of antihypertensive more or less appropriate in that individual (e.g. β-blockers can be used in younger patients in whom ACEI/ ARB are contraindicated; ACEI are also useful for treating heart failure and diabetic nephropathy but should not be used in pregnant women; Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockers are used to control angina).

When hypertension is secondary to a known condition or factor (e.g. renal stenosis, oral contraceptives), removal of this cause is often sufficient to normalize the ABP.

### **Drugs used to treat hypertension**

Thiazide-like diuretics such as indapamide and chlortalidone increase renal Na<sup>+</sup> excretion by inhibiting Na<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>-</sup> symport in the cortical part of the ascending loop of Henle and the distal tubule. This leads to a fall in blood volume and CO. These drugs may also have vasodilating properties which contribute to their antihypertensive effects. Thiazide-like diuretics can cause hypokalaemia by promoting Na<sup>+</sup>–K<sup>+</sup> exchange in the collecting tubule. This can be prevented by giving K<sup>+</sup> supplements or also by combining thiazide diuretics with K<sup>+</sup>-sparing diuretics (e.g. amiloride) to reduce Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption and therefore K<sup>+</sup> secretion by blocking Na<sup>+</sup> channels (EnaC) in the collecting duct. Additional side effects include increases in plasma insulin, glucose or cholesterol, as well as hypersensitivity reactions and impotence.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors such as ramipril, enalipril and lisinopril block the conversion of angiotensin 1 into angiotensin 2. This reduces TPR because angiotensin 2 stimulates the sympathetic system centrally, promotes release of noradrenaline from sympathetic nerves, and vasoconstricts directly. The fall in plasma angiotensin 2, and consequently in aldosterone, also promotes diuresis/natriuresis because both hormones cause renal Na<sup>+</sup> and water retention (see Chapter 29). ACE also metabolizes the vasodilators bradykinin and substance P and increases in the concentrations of these substance in the lung associated with ACEI treatment are thought to sensitize sensory nerves in the airways, leading to the chronic cough that is the most common adverse effect of ACEI. This effect does not occur with angiotensin 2 receptor (AT<sub>1</sub>) blockers (ARB) such as losartan and valsartan, which selec-

tively inhibit the effects of angiotensin 2 on its AT<sub>1</sub> subtype without affecting bradykinin levels. Both ACEI and ARB have few side effects. However, they are contraindicated in pregnancy, renovascular disease and aortic stenosis. Aldosterone receptor antagonists (e.g. **spironolactone**; see Chapter 47), are also used to treat hypertension, as is **aliskiren**, an antagonist of renin which prevents it from producing angiotensin 1. As described in Chapter 35, aliskiren has theoretical advantages over ACEI and ARB with regard to less waning of its efficacy with time. Although there is some evidence that it may be more beneficial than ACEI or ARBs in hypertensives who are also diabetic, obese or suffer from metabolic syndrome, unlike these drugs aliskiren is not currently recommended for first-line use.

Calcium-channel blockers such as nifedipine, verapamil and diltiazem are commonly used to treat hypertension due to their vasodilating properties, as described in Chapter 35. The dihydropyridine CCBs, which are selective for vascular smooth muscle over the heart and are used most widely, also have a beneficial diuretic effect. Dihydropyridines have been shown to be especially effective in the elderly, and are safe in pregnancy.

**β-adrenergic receptor blockers** antagonize sympathetic nervous system stimulation of cardiac β-receptors (mainly  $\beta_1$ ), thereby reducing cardiac output through negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. They also block β-receptors on juxtaglomerular granule cells in the kidney, thus inhibiting renin release and reducing plasma levels of angiotensin 2 and aldosterone. During treatment, TPR rises initially and then returns to the predrug level via an unknown mechanism, while CO remains depressed. All β-blockers used to treat hypertension antagonize the  $\beta_1$  subtype, but some have additional effects on other adrenergic receptors which may contribute to their ABP-lowering actions and side effects (Chapter 35). β-blockers are contraindicated in moderate/severe asthma due to their potential effects on bronchiolar  $\beta_2$ -receptors. Adverse effects of these drugs include fatigue, negative inotropy, CNS disturbances in some (e.g. nightmares), and worsening and masking of the signs of hypoglycaemia.

 $\alpha_1$ -adrenergic receptor blockers cause vasodilatation by inhibiting the constriction of arteries by the sympathetic neurotransmitter noradrenaline. Like  $\beta$ -blockers, these drugs are used at a late stage of stepped treatment if combinations of other drugs have failed to adequately control the blood pressure.

The drugs **rilmenidine** and **moxonidine** reduce sympathetic outflow by activating central **imidazoline** ( $I_1$ ) receptors in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). This lowers blood pressure with few side effects, but the use of these drugs is limited due to lack of evidence from clinical trials that they have beneficial effects on survival.

In  $\sim\!25\%$  of patients, ABP cannot be adequately lowered with drugs. Recent clinical trials suggest that combining pharmacological therapy with **barostimulation** (Chapter 27) can significantly improve ABP control in such patients.

### **Renal effects of vasodilators**

In a recent paper, Dorrington and colleagues have pointed out that an implication of a strictly renocentric mechanism of hypertension pathogenesis (Chapter 38) is that vasodilator-induced reduction of TPR cannot by itself reverse hypertension, since any fall in ABP it causes will then diminish natriuresis/diuresis, thereby causing fluid retention and a rise in CO which will restore the high blood pressure. They propose that all vasodilators which lower TPR also have a natriuretic/diuretic effect (by lowering renal vascular resistance and/or inhibiting tubular solute reabsorption) and that it is the latter effect which lowers ABP. An alternative interpretation is that arterial and/or venous constriction also contributes to long term control of ABP and that a wholly renocentric view of ABP control is incorrect.
