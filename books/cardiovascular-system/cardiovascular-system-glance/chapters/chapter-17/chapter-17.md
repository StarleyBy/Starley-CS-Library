ardiac output (CO) is stroke volume (SV) × heart rate (HR), and at rest ~5 L/min; during strenuous exercise this can rise to >25 L/min. SV is influenced by the filling pressure (preload), cardiac muscle force, and pressure against which the heart has to pump (afterload), which are all modulated by the autonomic nervous system (ANS) (Figure 17.1). The heart and vasculature form a closed system, so except for transient perturbations venous return *must* equal CO.

## Filling pressure and Starling's law of the heart

Right ventricular (RV) **end-diastolic pressure** (**EDP**) is dependent on right atrial and therefore central venous pressure (**CVP**); left ventricular (LV) EDP is dependent on **pulmonary venous pressure**. EDP and the compliance of the ventricle (how easy it is to inflate) determine ventricular **end-diastolic volume** (EDV). As EDP (and so EDV) increases, the force of the following contraction, and thus SV, increases (Figure 17.2). This is known as the **Frank–Starling** relationship, and the graph relating SV to EDP is called a **ventricular function** curve. The force of contraction is dependent on muscle stretch, and **Starling's law of the heart** states '*The energy released during contraction depends on the initial fibre length*'.

As muscle is stretched more myosin crossbridges can form, increasing force. Cardiac muscle has a steeper relationship between stretch and force than skeletal muscle, because in the heart stretch also increases Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of troponin C (Chapter 12). The function curve is therefore steep, so small changes in EDP can lead to large increases in SV (Figure 17.2).

### **Importance of Starling's law**

The most important consequence of Starling's law is that SV is matched between right and left ventricles. If, for example, RV SV increases, the amount of blood in the lungs and thus pulmonary vascular pressure will also increase. As the latter determines LV EDP, LV SV increases due to Starling's law, until it again matches that of the RV when input to and output from the lungs equalize and the pressure stops rising. This represents a rightward shift along the function curve (Figure 17.2). Starling's law thus explains how CVP, although only perceived by the RV, also influences LV function and CO, and why postural hypotension and haemorrhage reduce CO. It also allows the heart to sustain output against an increased afterload (e.g. hypertension, valve stenosis), as this leads to accumulation of venous blood and a raised EDP/EDV. Ventricular force therefore increases according to Starling's law, until CO is restored at the expense of an increased EDP. The same occurs when contractility is reduced, which is why EDP is high in heart failure (Figure 17.2; Chapter 46). As an increase in LV EDP represents an increase in RV afterload, for the same reasons CVP may also rise (Figure 17.3). A consequence of the above is that the ejection fraction (SV/EDV) will be reduced; this and an enlarged heart (high EDV) are characteristic of systolic heart failure (Chapter 46).

### The autonomic nervous system

The ANS strongly influences CO and is central to control of blood pressure (Chapters 27, 28). **Sympathetic** stimulation increases heart rate whereas parasympathetic stimulation decreases it (Chapter 11). Sympathetic stimulation also increases cardiac muscle force (*without any change in EDV*), termed an increase in **contractility** (Chapter 12); the function curve therefore shifts upwards

(Figure 17.2). Agents that affect contractility are called **inotropes** (Chapter 12). Parasympathetic stimulation does not affect ventricular contractility.

Sympathetic stimulation also causes arterial and venous vaso-constriction (Chapter 28). An often overlooked point is that these differ in effect. Arterial vasoconstriction increases total peripheral resistance (**TPR**) and thus reduces flow, so downstream pressure and venous return fall. However, unlike arteries veins are highly **compliant** (stretch easily) and contain ~70% of blood volume. Venoconstriction reduces venous compliance and hence **capacity** (amount of blood they contain), and therefore has the same effect as increasing blood volume, that is, **CVP increases**. Venoconstriction does not significantly impede flow because venous resistance is very low compared to TPR. Sympathetic stimulation can thus increase CO by increasing heart rate, contractility and CVP.

# **Venous return and vascular function curves**

Blood flow is driven by the arterial-venous pressure difference, so venous return will be impeded by a rise in CVP. This is at first glance inconsistent with Starling's law if CO must equal venous return. However, factors that affect CVP (blood volume, venoconstriction) also affect the relationship between CVP and venous return (vascular function curves; Figure 17.3). If the heart stops, pressure will equalize between the arterial and venous circulations (mean circulatory pressure,  $P_{MC}$ ), which depends on the volume and compliance of the vasculature, primarily the veins. By definition CVP equals P<sub>MC</sub> when venous return (i.e. CO) is zero. The curve levels off at negative CVP due to venous collapse. Increasing blood volume or venoconstriction increases P<sub>MC</sub> and so shifts the curve to the right, whereas blood loss does the reverse. Arterial vasoconstriction and an increase in TPR on the other hand reduces blood flow and venous return (see above), but as resistance arteries contain little of the blood volume, and the decrease in diameter required to increase their resistance is small (Chapter 18), there is an insignificant change in vascular volume or P<sub>MC</sub>. Thus, the net effect is to reduce the slope of the curve. A reduction in TPR does

Guyton's analysis helps us to understand the function of the cardiovascular system by combining vascular and cardiac function curves into one graph (Figure 17.4). The cardiac function curve is now shown as CO plotted against CVP (i.e. RV EDP). The only point at which CO and venous return are equal, and so the only point where the system is in equilibrium, is where the two function curves cross (A), the equilibrium (or operating) point. Thus, increasing blood volume or venoconstriction shifts the equilibrium point (B) and CO and CVP are both increased. Blood loss or venous dilatation do the opposite (C), which is why nitrovasodilators, which primarily dilate veins, reduce cardiac work (Chapter 41). Positive inotropes (e.g. digoxin) increase cardiac contractility and shift the cardiac function curve upwards. At equilibrium (D) CO is thus increased but CVP reduced, explaining why digoxin reduces symptoms in heart failure (Chapter 46). Analysis of heart failure is illuminating. The initial fall in CO is limited by an elevated CVP (Figure 17.4, E; see Starling's law above). Central mechanisms mediated via the ANS then provide further compensation to maintain blood pressure, by increasing TPR, venoconstriction and renal retention of salt and water (Chapter 46). Combined, these raise and flatten the vascular function curve (see above), so at equilibrium CO may be largely restored, but at the expense of a greatly increased CVP (F).
