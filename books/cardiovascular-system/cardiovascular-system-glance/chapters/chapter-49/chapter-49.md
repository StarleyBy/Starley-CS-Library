12 lead ECG showing rate-controlled atrial fibrillation. The patient is likely taking β-blockers to achieve a resting ventricular rate of ~70 bpm. P waves are absent because there is loss of co-ordinated atrial contraction. The ventricular rate is irregularly irregular. The fibrillatory F waves are best seen in leads II and aVF.

A trial fibrillation (AF) is a supraventricular arrhythmia characterised by low amplitude baseline oscillations called fibrillatory waves with a rate of 300–600 beats per minute and an irregularly irregular ventricular rhythm. Atrial depolarisation occurs in rapid waves with constantly changing pathways, resulting in loss of coordinated atrial contraction so that on the 12 lead ECG, P waves are absent. The ventricular rate is typically less than 200 bpm because the AVN is unable to conduct most of the atrial impulses impinging upon it (Figure 49.1). *The only time the ventricular rate is regular in AF is when complete heart block is also present*. In this case a regular ventricular escape rhythm is responsible for the QRS complexes seen on the ECG.

## Classification of atrial fibrillation

AF, the most common arrhythmia, occurs in ~10% of people over the age of 75 and can be caused by both cardiac and non‐cardiac factors (see Figure 49.2). AF is classified into three types, based on duration. AF terminating within 7 days is called **paroxysmal AF**. AF present for more than 7 days is termed **persistent AF**. Longstanding AF refractory to attempts to cardiovert to sinus rhythm is called **permanent AF**. Paroxysmal AF is usually driven by an ectopic focus or reentrant pathway in the cardiac muscle surrounding pulmonary veins where they enter the left atrium. As AF progresses, it causes changes in the electrical and structural properties of the atrial myocardium, promoting further and more complex forms of reentry, thus rendering it more persistent and refractory to treatment. Palpitations, dyspnoea, dizziness, chest pain or syncope may occur as a result of an increased ventricular rate or the absence of atrial systolic filling, which reduces ventricular stroke volume by ~20%.

## The ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation

The ventricular rate in AF is either normal (60–100 bpm), fast (>100 bpm; **AF with a fast ventricular response**) or slow (<60 bpm; **AF with a slow ventricular response**). In the presence of bundle branch block, AF with a fast ventricular response is termed **AF with aberrant conduction**. Importantly, this may be difficult to distinguish from ventricular tachycardia (VT) on the 12 lead ECG, and *if there is any doubt regarding the diagnosis of a broad complex tachycardia, the safest approach is to treat as VT*. The ventricular rate in AF can be dangerously high in patients with Wolff‐ Parkinson‐White syndrome. This condition, **pre‐excited AF**, occurs because an accessory pathway permits 1:1 conduction of the atrial rate to the ventricles, bypassing the AVN and resulting in a ventricular rate of up to 300 bpm (see Chapter 50). If untreated, this will rapidly degenerate to ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest.

If the ventricular rate is slow, any rate‐limiting drugs should be stopped and if the slow ventricular rate persists, implantation of a

permanent pacemaker should be considered. Slow AF may occur in **tachy‐brady syndrome**. In this type of SAN disease, the patient alternates between high and low ventricular rates and requires implantation of a permanent pacemaker for management of the slow rate and concomitant use of AV nodal blocking agents such as bisoprolol to protect against ventricular high rates.

## Atrial fibrillation and stroke

AF accounts for ~20% of overall stroke incidence and up to 30% in those older than 80. Thrombi may form in the left atrium or in the **left atrial appendage** because the lack of coordinated atrial contraction leads to stasis of blood and clots which can then embolise to the systemic circulation. Stroke can be the first manifestation of AF in asymptomatic individuals.

## Management of atrial fibrillation

*Management* The management of AF (Figure 49.2) is threefold: control of the ventricular rate (rate control, Chapter 52), control of the atrial rhythm (rhythm control, used if the patient is not in permanent AF, Chapter 52) and prevention of thromboembolic complications such as stroke. Any underlying structural heart disease or other potential cause should also be investigated and treated.

*Rate control* is used in most patients to reduce the ventricular rate if it is >100 bpm. This is a common reason for presentation to emergency departments. β‐blockers (bisoprolol, metoprolol), calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem) and digoxin are the rate‐limiting (AV nodal blocking) agents commonly used.

*Rhythm control* is the preferred strategy under certain circumstances including new onset AF and in those with an identifiable reversible cause, for example, infection. Strategies for rhythm control depend on whether the patient is haemodynamically unstable. If this is the case, or if the patient has significant cardiac ischaemia or pulmonary oedema, then emergency **direct current cardioversion (DCCV**; see Chapter 51**)** is required. Shocks are delivered in synchrony with the R wave of the QRS complex to the heavily sedated patient via defibrillator pads placed below the right clavicle and over the apex of the heart. *This strategy is used for the treatment of all unstable arrhythmias*. DCCV can be used electively as a rhythm control strategy in patients who have been therapeutically anticoagulated for at least 3 weeks, or in those in whom a transoesophageal echocardiogram has confirmed no intracardiac thrombus. If the patient is not haemodynamically compromised, a pharmacological rhythm control strategy can be attempted with the class III antiarrhythmic amiodarone or the β‐blocker sotalol which also has class III properties. If there is no structural heart disease on echocardiography then the class IC agent flecainide can be used.

Ablation has assumed a central role in treating many arrhythmias and is curative in >90% of certain supraventricular arrhythmias. It is also used to treat VT when an appropriate target (e.g. a slowly conducting 'isthmus' in a myocardial scar) can be identified. The pathways or focally automatic sites causing or maintaining certain arrhythmias are ablated (destroyed) by focal heating or freezing delivered via a catheter. The catheter is inserted through the femoral vein and its tip is located at the surface of the endocardium at desired site. The tip temperature is raised to 55-70°C, creating a lesion mm in diameter and of similar depth. Although seldom causing complications, catheter ablation of sites very close to the AVN can potentially damage it, causing complete heart block which necessitates pacemaker implantation. This can be avoided using **cryoablation**, in which the catheter tip is cooled rather than heated. Cooling the tip briefly to -30°C causes a focal block of electrical activity that is reversible and so cannot cause permanent damage. If this stops the arrhythmia without causing undesirable effects the tip is then further cooled to -60 °C, causing a permanent lesion and ablating the abnormal rhythm.

To treat AF, multiple ablation lesions are created to effect electrical isolation of the four pulmonary veins at their insertion points into the left atrium. Recurrent AF after catheter ablation occurs in 20-40% of patients, most commonly due to resumption of conduction between previously isolated pulmonary veins and the left atrium ('pulmonary vein reconnection'), and it is not uncommon

for patients to undergo two or even three ablations to ensure durable pulmonary vein isolation.

A palliative rhythm control strategy 'pace and ablate' is reserved for those who have derived no benefit from drugs and/or ablation, and still experience symptomatic AF that has a significant impact upon quality of life. This involves implantation of a dual chamber permanent pacemaker and subsequent catheter ablation of the AVN. This renders the patient 'pacing dependent', that is, they are now in complete heart block and the dual chamber pacemaker takes over the electrical activity of the heart.

Prevention of thromboembolic complications AF confers a fivefold increased risk of stroke in patients who are not anticoagulated, and AF may in fact present with stroke. The annual risk of stroke is calculated using the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>VASC score, which stands for congestive cardiac failure, hypertension, age, diabetes, stroke, vascular disease, and female sex. Each risk factor scores one point except for age greater than 75 years and stroke, which score two points each. Patients scoring ≥2 have at least a 2.2% risk of stroke per annum and should be anticoagulated. Direct acting oral anticoagultants (DOACs) such as apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran are preferred to warfarin, although in some patients warfarin may be more suitable, for example, those with metallic heart valves. In patients unable to take anticoagulation, for example, those with a history of major haemorrhage or a high bleeding risk, the left atrial appendage, which is the primary site of thrombus formation, can be closed with a specialised device.
