The acute coronary syndromes (ACS, Figure 42.1), including in ascending order of severity, unstable angina (UA), non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), represent a spectrum of dangerous conditions in which myocardial ischaemia results from a sudden decrease in the flow of blood through a coronary artery. This decrease is almost always initiated by the rupture of an unstable atherosclerotic plaque, resulting in the formation of an intracoronary thrombus that diminishes or abolishes the flow of blood.

The ACS are divided into those with sustained (>20 mins) ST-segment elevation in two or more contiguous ECG leads (ST-segment myocardial infarction; STEMI) and those without (UA, NSTEMI). STEMI is discussed in Chapters 44 and 45. As UA

and NSTEMI are indistinguishable at initial presentation, they are grouped together as non-ST elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS).

In order to differentiate between UA and NSTEMI, the cardiac biomarker troponin T is measured. This is a protein integral to muscle contraction in cardiac muscle and is released into the blood by the death of cardiac cells. In NSTEMI there is a troponin rise, indicating myocyte necrosis, but in UA there is not. Both NSTEMI and UA may be associated with ECG changes other than ST elevation, for example ST segment depression and T-wave inversion. Symptoms of NSTE-ACS resemble those of stable angina, but they are generally more severe and persistent. Typical presentations include:

1 Angina of recent onset at rest or on minimal exertion or that which awakens the patient from sleep and lasts >10 mins.

- **2** An accelerating pattern of angina attacks, which are progressively more severe, prolonged and frequent.
- **3** Post-MI angina (ischaemic pain 24 h to 2 weeks after MI).

## **Pathophysiology of NSTE-ACS**

Episodes of unstable angina are preceded by a fall in coronary blood flow, thought to result from the periodic development of coronary **thrombosis** and **vasoconstriction**, which are triggered by coronary artery disease (Figure 42.2).

Thrombosis is promoted by the endothelial damage and turbulent blood flow associated with atherosclerotic plaques. Compared with the lesions of stable angina, plaques found in patients with ACS tend to have a thinner fibrous cap and a larger lipid core and are generally more widespread and severe. These stenoses are often *eccentric* – the plaque does not surround the entire circumference of the artery. Such lesions are especially vulnerable to being ruptured by haemodynamic stress. This exposes the plaque interior, which powerfully stimulates platelet aggregation and thrombosis. The thrombus propagates out into the coronary lumen, occluding the artery. Rupture may also cause haemorrhage into the lesion itself, expanding it out into the lumen and worsening stenosis.

These events may be exacerbated by impaired coronary vasodilatation, and vasospasm due to plaque-associated endothelial damage, which reduces the local release of endothelium-dependent relaxing factors, such as nitric oxide. Platelet aggregation and thrombosis also cause the local generation of vasoconstrictors such as thromboxane  $\boldsymbol{A}_2$  and serotonin.

## **Management of NSTE-ACS** (Figure 42.3)

The management of NSTE-ACS involves acute stabilisation of the patient, treatment of the culprit lesion and long-term management aimed at preventing disease progression and future plaque rupture/ erosion events (secondary prevention). According to the European Society of Cardiology guidelines, those with very high risk NSTE-ACS (haemodynamic instability, refractory symptoms, ventricular arrhythmias, acute heart failure, dynamic ST/T wave changes) require immediate invasive angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) if indicated. Patients with a high risk profile (elevated troponin, dynamic ECG changes) benefit from an early invasive strategy, that is, angiography and PCI if indicated within 24 hours. Patients at intermediate risk (diabetes, chronic kidney disease, impaired LV function, prior PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)) should undergo angiography and PCI if indicated within 72 hours. Not all patients with NSTE-ACS are suitable for angiography; in the very elderly and frail population, or in those with high bleeding risk, medical therapy is appropriate.

Long-term **optimal medical therapy** aims to prevent future acute coronary events and slow the progression of atherosclerosis.

Antiplatelet therapy (Chapter 8) Patients with NSTE-ACS are immediately treated with 300 mg aspirin. This is then reduced to 75 mg/day, lifelong. Aspirin suppresses platelet aggregation. A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials showed that aspirin is associated with a highly significant reduction in major vascular events.

The  $P2Y_{12}$  inhibitor clopidogrel is an inactive prodrug which requires activation by the cytochrome P450 system to generate its active metabolite. Its onset time is 2–6 hours. It inhibits ADP-stimulated platelet aggregation and was shown in the 2000 CURE trial to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality by ~20% in patients with NSTE-ACS.

**Ticagrelor** is a reversibly binding P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitor with a 30 min onset time. The PLATO trial in 2009 demonstrated that in ACS patients, ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel reduced the primary end-

point of cardiovascular death, MI and stroke. The bleeding risk was higher with ticagrelor but the incidence of life-threatening or fatal bleeds was the same. Therefore ticagrelor has superseded clopidogrel in the ACS setting apart from in older patients with a higher bleeding risk.

**Prasugrel** is a prodrug which irreversibly blocks platelet  $P2Y_{12}$  receptors with a rapid onset time of 30 mins. It was compared to clopidogrel in ACS patients in the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial and reduced cardiovascular events but was associated with more severe bleeding complications and is contraindicated in patients with prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack.

**Cangrelor** is an intravenous adenosine triphosphate analogue with a very rapid onset time (2 min) that reversibly binds to the  $P2Y_{12}$  receptor. A meta-analysis showed that cangrelor resulted in a 19% relative risk reduction of periprocedural death, MI, ischaemia-driven revascularisation and stent thrombosis when compared to clopidogrel. As with prasugrel, the bleeding risk was increased. Cangrelor is currently licensed for patients undergoing PCI in whom oral therapy with a  $P2Y_{12}$  inhibitor is not feasible, for example, in those who are unconscious.

Intravenous **glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors** (abciximab, tirofiban) block fibrinogen-mediated cross-linkage of platelets. These drugs are generally used in patients undergoing PCI. In patients treated with ticagrelor or prasugrel, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors should be restricted to periprocedural thrombotic complications as the bleeding risk of giving both drugs has not been prospectively addressed.

Anticoagulant therapy Anticoagulants inhibit thrombin generation and/or activity. The combination of antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs is more effective at reducing ischaemic events in NSTE-ACS than either treatment alone. Unfractionated heparin is routinely given to patients during elective and emergency angiography done via the radial route to prevent radial artery occlusion. If PCI is undertaken, higher doses of unfractionated heparin are given to prevent thrombus formation at the site of balloon injury and on angioplasty equipment. The low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) enoxaparin was associated with a marginally lower incidence of death or MI in ACS compared to unfractionated heparin according to a metanalysis. The factor Xa inhibitor fondaparinux binds reversibly to antithrombin, thereby preventing thrombin generation. The OASIS-5 trial found that in NSTE-ACS, fondaparinux resulted in less bleeding and less mortality than enoxaparin.

Antianginal drugs β-Blockers are beneficial in MI for several reasons. They diminish  $O_2$  demand by lowering the heart rate and decrease ventricular wall stress by lowering afterload. They therefore reduce ischaemia and infarct size when given acutely. They also decrease recurrent ischaemia and free wall rupture, and suppress arrhythmias (see Chapter 48). They should be given unless contraindicated (e.g. acute left ventricular failure since they are negatively inotropic, high grade atrioventricular block, severe asthma).

**Nitrates** can be given for symptom control, but do not reduce mortality.

In terms of long term management, **statins** and **angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors** (**ACEI**) improve survival in NSTE-ACS and are used routinely for secondary prevention. **ACEI** (e.g. enalapril, ramipril) reduce afterload and ventricular wall stress and improve ejection fraction. Inhibition of ACE raises bradykinin levels, which may improve endothelial function and limit coronary vasospasm. ACEI also limit ventricular remodelling and infarct expansion (see Chapter 47), thereby reducing mortality and the incidence of congestive heart failure and recurrent MI. Therapy should be instituted within 24 h in patients with STEMI, especially if there is evidence of heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction, and should continue long term if LV dysfunction remains evident.
