# **Primary haemostasis** (Figure 7.1)

The immediate response to damage of the blood vessel wall is vasoconstriction, which reduces blood flow. This is followed by a sequence of events leading to sealing of the wound by a clot. Collagen in the exposed subendothelial matrix binds von Willebrand factor (vWF), which in turn binds to glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) receptors on platelets, the first stage of platelet adhesion. This initial tethering promotes binding of platelet integrin  $\alpha_{\alpha}\beta_{\alpha}$ , and GPVI receptors directly to collagen. Binding of receptors initiates activation, partly by increasing intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Platelets change shape, put out pseudopodia and make thromboxane A, (TXA<sub>2</sub>) via cyclooxygenase (COX). TXA<sub>2</sub> releases mediators from platelet dense granules, including serotonin (5-HT) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and from  $\alpha$  granules vWF, factor V (see below) and agents that promote vascular repair. TXA, and 5-HT also promote vasoconstriction. ADP activates more platelets via P2Y, purinergic receptors, causing activation of fibrinogen (GPIIb/IIIa) receptors and exposure of phospholipid (PLD) on the platelet surface. Plasma fibrinogen binds to GPIIb/IIIa receptors causing the platelets to aggregate (stick together) forming a soft platelet plug (Figure 7.1). This is stabilized with fibrin during clotting. Note that **thrombin** (see below) is also a potent platelet activator.

### **Formation of the blood clot** (Figures 7.2, 7.3)

The final stage of blood clotting (coagulation) is formation of the clot – a tight mesh of **fibrin** entrapping platelets and blood cells. The process is complex, involving sequential conversion of proenzymes to active enzymes (**factors**; e.g. factor  $X \to Xa$ ). The ultimate purpose is to produce a massive burst of **thrombin** (factor IIa), a protease that cleaves fibrinogen to fibrin. The **cell-based model** of clotting (Figure 7.2) has replaced the older extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Most of the action in this model occurs on the cell surface (hence its name).

The **initial phase** of clotting is initiated when cells in the subendothelial matrix that bear **tissue factor** (**TF**; thromboplastin) are exposed to factor VIIa from plasma. Such cells include fibroblasts and monocytes, but damaged endothelium and circulating cell fragments containing TF (microparticles) can also initiate clotting. TF forms a complex with factor VIIa (**TF:VIIa**) which activates **factor X** (and IX, see below). **Factor Xa** with its cofactor Va then converts **prothrombin** (factor II) to thrombin; activation of both factor X and prothrombin require Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Comparatively little thrombin is produced at this time, but sufficient to initiate the **amplification phase**. Activity of these processes is normally suppressed by tissue factor pathway inhibitor (**TFPI**), which inhibits and forms a complex with factor Xa, which then inhibits TF:VIIa; however, the influx of plasma factors after damage overwhelms this suppression.

The **amplification phase** takes place on platelets (Figure 7.2). Thrombin produced in the initial phase activates further platelets and membrane-bound factor V which is released from platelet  $\alpha$  granules. Factor VIII is normally bound to circulating vWF, which protects it from degradation. Thrombin cleaves factor VIII from vWF and activates it, when it binds to the platelet membrane.

The scene is now set for the **propagation phase**. Either factor XIa (itself activated by thrombin) or TF:VIIa can activate factor IX,

which binds and forms a complex with factor VIIIa on the platelet membrane called **tenase**; this is a much more powerful activator of factor X than TF:VIIa. Factors Xa and Va then bind to form **prothrombinase** on the platelet membrane. This process leads to a massive burst of thrombin production, 1000-fold greater than in the initial phase and localized to activated platelets.

Factor XII (Hageman factor, not shown) is probably of limited significance, as deficiency does not lead to bleeding. It is activated by negative charge on glass and collagen and can activate factor XI. It may be involved in pathological clotting in the brain.

Thrombin cleaves small fibrinopeptides from fibrinogen to form fibrin monomers (Figure 7.3), which spontaneously **polymerize**. This polymer is **cross-linked** by **factor XIIIa** (activated by thrombin in the presence of  $Ca^{2+}$ ) to create a tough network of fibrin fibres and a **stable clot**. Retraction of entrapped platelets contracts the clot by ~60%, making it tougher and assisting repair by drawing the edges of the wound together.

# **Inhibitors of haemostasis and fibrinolysis**

Inhibitory mechanisms are vital to prevent inappropriate clotting (thrombosis). Prostacyclin (PGI<sub>2</sub>) and nitric oxide from undamaged endothelium impede platelet adhesion and activation. Antithrombin inhibits thrombin, factor Xa and IXa/tenase; its activity is strongly potentiated by heparin, a polysaccharide. Heparan on endothelial cells is similar. TFPI has already been mentioned. Thrombomodulin on endothelial cells binds thrombin and prevents it cleaving fibrinogen; instead, it activates protein C (APC) which with its cofactor protein S inactivates cofactors Va and VIIIa, and hence tenase and prothrombinase (Figure 7.4).

**Fibrinolysis** is the process by which a clot is broken down by **plasmin**, a protease (Figure 7.4). This creates soluble fibrin degradation products (**FDPs**) including small **D-dimers**. **Plasmin** is formed from fibrin-bound **plasminogen** by tissue plasminogen activator (**tPA**), released from damaged endothelial cells in response to bradykinin, thrombin and kallikrein. **Urokinase** (uPA) is similar. **APC** inactivates an inhibitor of plasminogen activator inhibitor (tPA; **PAI-1** and 2), and so promotes fibrinolysis (Figure 7.4). Plasmin is itself inactivated by  $α_2$ -antiplasmin and inhibited by thrombin activated fibrinolysis inhibitor (**TAFI**).

## **Defects in haemostasis**

The most common hereditary disorder is haemophilia A, a deficiency of factor VIII sex linked to males. Christmas disease is a deficiency of factor IX, and von Willebrand disease a deficiency of vWF. The latter leads to defective platelet adhesion and reduced availability of factor VIII, which is stabilized by vWF. The liver requires vitamin K for correct synthesis of prothrombin and factors VII, IX and X. As vitamin K is obtained from intestinal bacteria and food, disorders of fat absorption or liver disease can result in deficiency and defective clotting. Factor V Leiden is brought about by a mutant factor V that cannot be inactivated by APC. Five per cent carry the gene, which causes a fivefold increase in the risk of thrombosis. Antiphospholipid syndrome is caused by phospholipid-binding antibodies (e.g. cardiolipin, lupus anticoagulant) which may inhibit APC and protein S or facilitate cleavage of prothrombin. It is associated with recurrent thrombosis and linked to 20% of strokes in people under 50 years, more common in females.
