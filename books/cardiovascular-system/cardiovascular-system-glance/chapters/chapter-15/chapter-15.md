# Vascular smooth muscle excitation—contraction coupling

![](_page_0_Figure_4.jpeg)

ascular smooth muscle (VSM) contraction is, like that of cardiac muscle, controlled by the *intracellular Ca*<sup>2+</sup> *concentration* [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. Unlike cardiac muscle cells, however, VSM cells lack troponin and utilize a *myosin-based system* to regulate contraction.

## **Regulation of contraction by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and myosin phosphorylation** (see shaded area in left cell of Figure 15.1)

Vasoconstricting stimuli initiate VSM cell contraction by increasing  $[Ca^{2+}]_i$  from its basal level of ~100 nmol/L. Force development is proportional to the increase in  $[Ca^{2+}]_i$ , with maximal contraction occurring at ~1  $\mu$ mol/L  $[Ca^{2+}]_i$ . The rise in  $[Ca^{2+}]_i$  promotes its binding to the cytoplasmic regulatory protein **calmodulin** (**CaM**). Once a calmodulin molecule has bound four  $Ca^{2+}$  ions, it can

activate the enzyme myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK). MLCK in turn phosphorylates two 20-kDa subunits ('light chains') contained within the 'head' of each myosin molecule. Phosphorylated myosin then forms crossbridges with actin, using ATP hydrolysis as an energy source to produce contraction. Actin–myosin interactions during crossbridge cycling are similar to those in cardiac myocytes (Chapter 12).

The degree of myosin light-chain phosphorylation, which determines crossbridge turnover, is a balance between the activity of MLCK and a **myosin light-chain phosphatase** which dephosphorylates the light chains. Once  $\left[\text{Ca}^{2+}\right]_i$  falls, MLCK activity diminishes and relaxation occurs as light-chain phosphorylation is returned to basal levels by the phosphatase.

VSM cells *in vivo* maintain a tonic level of partial contraction that varies with fluctuations in the vasoconstricting and vasodilating influences to which they are exposed. VSM cells

avoid fatigue during prolonged contractions because their rate of ATP consumption is 300-fold lower than that of skeletal muscle fibres. This is possible because the maximum crossbridge cycling rate of smooth muscle during shortening is only about one-tenth of that in striated muscles due to differences in the types of myosin present. Once VSM cells have shortened, their ATP expenditure is further reduced because the myosin crossbridges remain attached to actin for a longer time, thus 'locking in' shortening.

### **Vasoconstricting mechanisms**

The binding to receptors of noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and other important vasoconstrictors such as endothelin, thromboxane A<sub>2</sub>, angiotensin 2 and vasopressin stimulates VSM contraction via common G-protein-mediated pathways (see left cell).

**Effects of IP<sub>3</sub> and diacylglycerol**Binding of vasoconstrictors to receptors activates the G-protein G<sub>0/11</sub>, which stimulates the enzyme phospholipase C. Phospholipase C splits the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2), generating the second messengers inositol,5-triphosphate (IP<sub>2</sub>) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP, binds to and opens Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels on the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). This allows Ca2+, which is stored in high concentrations within the SR, to flood out into the cytoplasm. DAG activates **protein kinase C** (PKC). This activates the protein CPI-17, which phosphorylates and inhibits myosin phosphatase, promoting contraction.

## Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx mechanisms

Vasoconstrictors also cause **membrane depolarization** via several mechanisms. First, the release of SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> they initiate causes the opening of plasmalemmal Ca2+-activated chloride channels, which are thought to be formed of the protein **anoctamin**. Second, vasoconstrictors may act via DAG and PKC to inhibit the activity of K+ channels. Third, vasoconstrictors act through DAG to open receptor-gated cation channels, which allow the influx of both Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions. These channels are formed from tetramers of TRPC (transient receptor potential canonical) proteins, with TRPC and 7 isoforms thought to be the main isoforms involved.

The membrane depolarization elicited by vasoconstrictors opens L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (also termed Ca\_1.2 channels) similar to those found in cardiac myocytes. With sufficient depolarization, some blood vessels may fire brief Ca2+ channel-mediated APs that cause transient contractions. More often, however, vasoconstrictors cause graded depolarizations, during which sufficient Ca2+ influx occurs to cause more sustained contractions. Vasoconstrictors further enhance Ca2+ influx through L-type channels by evoking channel phosphorylation. Furthermore, depletion of SR Ca2+ due to its release causes the activation of STIM1, an SR protein which then binds to and stimulates the opening of plasmalemmal store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (SOC) channels, which mediate the influx of both Ca2+ and Na+. The molecular correlate of SOC channels is probably the plasmalemmal protein Orail, although this concept is disputed because Orail is Ca<sup>2+</sup> selective and it may be that non-selective cation channels formed by the protein TRPC1 are also involved.

As well as raising [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], vasoconstrictors also promote contraction by a process termed Ca2+ sensitization. Ca2+ sensitization is caused by the inhibition of myosin phosphatase. This increases myosin light-chain phosphorylation, and therefore force development, even with minimal increases in [Ca2+], and MLCK activity. Although PKC has this effect (see above), phosphatase inhibition is primarily caused by RhoA kinase, an enzyme stimulated by the ras type Gprotein **RhoA**, which is activated by vasoconstrictors via  $G_{\alpha/1}$ .

The relative importance of the excitatory mechanisms listed above varies between different vasoconstrictors and vascular beds. In resistance arteries depolarization and Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated channels are probably most important.

## Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal and vasodilator mechanisms

(see right cell of Figure 15.1)

Several mechanisms serve to remove Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cytoplasm. These are continually active, allowing cells both to recover from stimulation and to maintain a low basal [Ca2+], despite the enormous electrochemical gradient tending to drive Ca2+ into cells. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) pumps Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cytoplasm into the SR, a process referred to as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sequestration. An analogous plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) pumps Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cytoplasm into the extracellular space (Ca2+ extrusion). Cells also extrude Ca2+ via a Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) located in the cell membrane, which is similar to that found in cardiac cells (Chapter 12). The NCX may be localized to areas of the plasma membrane that are approached closely by the SR, allowing any Ca<sup>2+</sup> leaking from the SR to be quickly ejected from the cell without causing tension development. Interestingly, when the intracellular Na+ concentration near the cell membrane is sufficiently raised due to the opening of receptorgated or store-operated channels, the NCX may act in reverse mode, thereby becoming a pathway for Ca2+influx rather than extrusion.

Most vasodilators cause relaxation by activating either the cyclic GMP (e.g. nitric oxide, atrial natriuretic peptide) or cyclic **AMP** (e.g. adenosine, prostacyclin, β-receptor agonists) second messenger systems. Both second messengers activate kinases, which, by phosphorylating overlapping sets of cellular proteins, stimulate numerous vasodilating pathways. cGMP activates cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase G, PKG). PKG causes vasodilation by phosphorylating and activating Ca2+activated K<sup>+</sup> (BK<sub>Ca</sub>) channels; this leads to a membrane hyperpolarization which inhibits Ca2+ influx by switching off voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, some of which are open even at the resting membrane potential. PKG also stimulates Ca2+ removal from the cytoplasm by SERCA, PMCA and NCX, and suppresses Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitization by inhibiting Rho kinase.

Cyclic AMP exerts its effects via cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A, PKA), although high levels of cAMP have also been shown to stimulate PKG. PKA lowers [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. by activating SERCA, and also by opening voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels and BK<sub>c3</sub>. Stimulation of SERCA by PKA, which loads the SR with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, may also indirectly activate BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels by increasing the frequency of 'Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks'. These are transient elevations of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], near the cell membrane caused by the spontaneous opening of clusters of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and the consequent release of Ca2+ from the SR. PKA can also phosphorylate and inhibit MLCK, although the contribution of this mechanism to relaxation under physiological conditions is controversial. Both PKG and PKA also have been proposed to cause relaxation by phosphorylating heat shock protein 20, thereby causing actin depolymerization and/or dissociation from the cytoskeleton.
