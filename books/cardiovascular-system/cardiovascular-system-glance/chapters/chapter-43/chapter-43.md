evascularisation is the restoration of perfusion to ischaemic myocardium. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are revascularisation techniques used to treat patients with both acute coronary syndromes and stable coronary artery disease (CAD). The choice of technique is determined by several factors including extent of disease and patient choice.

#### **Percutaneous coronary intervention**

(Figure 43.1)

PCI was first performed in 1977 by Andreas Gruentzig and the field has expanded enormously over the past 4 decades. In a typical procedure, an angiogram is taken to demonstrate the coronary anatomy and pattern of disease. If the decision is made to proceed to revascularisation, a **guide catheter** is introduced via the radial or femoral artery and is positioned in the right or left main coronary ostium. A **guide wire** is then advanced through the guide catheter down the lumen of the coronary artery distal to the lesion. A **balloon catheter** is advanced over the guide wire and inflated at the site of the stenosis in what is termed **pre-dilation** (Figure 43.1). A **stent** is then deployed at the site of the lesion to act as a tubular scaffold maintaining vessel patency. Another balloon catheter is advanced and inflated at the site of the stent to improve its expan-

sion against the vessel wall (**post-dilation**). PCI is deemed a success if blood flow is restored to a normal level.

**Primary PCI** refers to the emergency revascularisation of a patient who has suffered an ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). These patients are typically brought directly to a cardiac catheterisation laboratory ('cath lab') where an emergency team is waiting. In the UK, primary PCI accounts for more than a quarter of all PCI activity, the remainder being for non-ST segment elevation MI and stable angina.

Complications of PCI include **stent thrombosis**, which is the acute occlusion of the stent with a thrombus, and **in-stent restenosis**, which is a gradual narrowing of the stented vessel lumen due to neointimal proliferation which occurs as part of the immune response to a foreign body. Stent thrombosis usually results in an acute coronary syndrome and in-stent restenosis often results in a return of angina. **Drug-eluting stents** (**DES**) were developed to overcome in-stent restenosis, a particular problem with bare metal stents in which restenosis rates can be up to 25%. DES elute antiproliferative medications (e.g. zotarolimus, everolimus) up to 180 days after implantation, which reduces inflammation and excessive neointimal growth. Restenosis rates with current second generation DES are in the single digits.

DES require dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) due to the increased risk of late stent thrombosis. Despite advances in stent

technology, stent thrombosis and in‐stent restenosis remain complications of PCI. The continued use of bare metal stents is controversial. Proponents argue that they are safer in those with a higher bleeding risk owing to the much shorter duration of DAPT required. However the 2017 SENIOR trial showed that in elderly patients undergoing PCI, a DES and shorter duration of DAPT was preferred to a bare metal stent and similar duration of DAPT in terms of all‐cause mortality.

Recent innovations in the field of interventional cardiology include **drug‐coated balloons**, which deliver an antiproliferative medication (paclitaxel) to the vessel wall and were shown in the 2017 DARE trial to be noninferior to everolimus‐eluting stents in the treatment of in‐stent restenosis.

**Bioresorbable vascular scaffolds** are a new technology in which the implant degrades over time. The aim is to overcome the late complications of stenting. However early trials have been disappointing with a higher incidence of adverse cardiac events compared to drug‐eluting stents.

### The role of PCI in stable coronary artery disease

Whilst the role of PCI in acute coronary syndromes is indisputable in terms of improving survival, its role in stable CAD is less clear. One of the most important trials in the management of stable CAD was COURAGE. It compared optimal medical therapy (OMT) to OMT + PCI in more than 2000 patients with stable CAD. It showed that while OMT + PCI did not lead to a reduction in mortality compared to OMT alone at 4.6 years' follow‐up, it did reduce anginal symptoms. However, the rates of angina equalised within 5 years.

The groundbreaking 2017 ORBITA trial was the first placebo‐ controlled trial of PCI in stable CAD. It compared OMT + PCI to OMT + placebo PCI, that is, a sham procedure in patients with single vessel coronary disease and angina. It found that there was no difference between treadmill exercise time after 6 weeks but there was a significant change in dobutamine stress echocardiography wall motion score index favouring the OMT + PCI group.

The ISCHEMIA trial is currently enrolling 8000 patients with moderate ischaemia on stress testing and will randomise patients to PCI + OMT or OMT alone. It aims to define the role of PCI in stable CAD in the modern era.

## Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)

(Figure 43.2)

CABG was introduced in the 1960s. In a typical triple bypass operation, the left internal mammary artery (LIMA; a branch of the subclavian artery) is grafted onto the left anterior descending artery (LAD), and segments of harvested saphenous vein are grafted from the aorta onto the left circumflex artery (LCx) or its branches. The saphenous vein is also used to graft from the aorta onto the right coronary artery (RCA). Vein grafts have limited long‐term patency due to early thrombosis, intimal hyperplasia with smooth muscle proliferation within the first year, and the development of atherosclerosis after approximately 5–7 years. Most arterial grafts remain patent after 10 years and are associated with improved survival compared with vein grafts alone. The use of both left and right internal mammary arteries (**bilateral internal mammary artery**) for grafting has become more common, especially in younger patients. For example, the right internal mammary artery (RIMA) may be grafted to the LAD while the LIMA is anastomosed onto the circumflex system. The radial artery is also used as a graft in CABG. The operation is usually performed with the patient on *cardiopulmonary bypass*, with the heart stopped (cardioplegia). Blood is removed from the right atrium, drained into a reservoir, and then pumped through an oxygenator, then a filter and back into the aorta to perfuse the systemic circulation. The main complications are a systemic inflammatory response, atrial fibrillation and stroke. The latter is thought to be caused by emboli, either formed in the bypass circuit or produced by disturbance of aortic plaques during cannulation, which lodge in the cerebral vasculature. These complications can be avoided by *off‐pump CABG*, which does not involve stopping the heart. In this case, the region of the cardiac wall encompassing the target coronary segment is immobilised to allow grafting. Randomised trials show that both types of CABG offer similar outcomes. The mortality rate associated with CABG is ~2%. Advances in surgical technique mean it is possible to perform minimally invasive bypass grafting which does not require a sternotomy. This approach is called **minimally invasive direct CABG** or MIDCAB. Typically, the LIMA is harvested under direct visualisation through a small thoracotomy incision or endoscopically and is anastomosed onto the LAD.

#### PCI vs CABG in stable coronary artery disease

PCI outcomes are similar to CABG in stable CAD if there is one‐ or two‐vessel disease not involving the proximal LAD, or if there is three‐vessel disease with simple lesions amenable to PCI. CABG is preferred if there is distal left main stem disease and two‐ or three‐vessel disease or in diabetic patients with multivessel disease.

The SYNTAX trial compared PCI to CABG in stable CAD and showed that in complex multivessel CAD, CABG is superior to PCI in terms of rates of death, MI, stroke or repeat revascularisation. Follow‐on analysis of the FREEDOM trial at 7.5 years showed that in diabetic patients, CABG retains a mortality benefit over PCI in patients with multivessel CAD.
