# Pharmacological management of stable, microvascular and vasospastic angina

![](_page_0_Figure_4.jpeg)

he aim of treatment of **stable** and **microvascular angina** is twofold: to control symptoms and to halt the progression of underlying coronary disease. Antianginals control symptoms and work by restoring the balance between myocardial  $O_2$  demand and supply. Patients with stable angina whose symptoms are refractory to guideline-directed **optimal medical therapy** should be considered for revascularisation with angioplasty or bypass grafting. The treatment of **vasospastic angina** is primarily directed at preventing or reversing coronary vasospasm (Figure 41.1).

# **Antianginal agents**

First-line treatment for stable angina consists of either a  $\beta$ -adrenergic receptor blocker ( $\beta$ -blocker), or a calcium-channel blocker (CCB) together with the short-acting nitrate glyceryl trinitrate. The initial choice between a  $\beta$ -blocker or a CCB depends on coexisting conditions and contraindications. For example, a CCB is preferable if the patient has moderate or severe asthma or hypertension, and a  $\beta$ -blocker may be appropriate if heart rate control is also required (i.e. if atrial fibrillation is present). If the patient cannot tolerate either a  $\beta$ -blocker or CCB, then monotherapy with either of the following should be used: isosorbide mononitrate, nicorandil, ivabradine, or ranolazine. If the patient is taking a  $\beta$ -blocker or a CCB and their symptoms remain poorly controlled, then both agents are

used together. If the other agent is not tolerated or is contraindicated then isosorbide mononitrate, nicorandil, ivabradine, or ranolazine can be added. If the patient remains symptomatic on the maximum tolerated doses of two drugs then they should be referred to a cardiologist for consideration of revascularisation (Chapter 43).

# $\beta$ -Adrenergic receptor blockers

(see also Chapter 35)

**β-blockers** decrease cardiac  $O_2$  demand by causing a fall in the resting and exercising heart rate and also by decreasing myocardial contractility and wall stress. The fall in the heart rate increases the fraction of time the heart spends in diastole. This enhances perfusion of the left ventricle, which occurs predominantly during diastole (Chapter 26). The main therapeutic action of these drugs is on cardiac  $β_1$ -receptors, but both  $β_2$ -selective and  $(β_1/β_2)$  non-selective blockers are used.

Potential adverse effects of  $\beta$ -blockers include fatigue, reduced left ventricular function and bradycardia. Impotence may be a concern in men.  $\beta$ -blockers can precipitate asthma by blocking  $\beta_2$ -receptors in the airways, and therefore even  $\beta_1$ -selective agents are contraindicated in this condition. Lipid-soluble  $\beta$ -blockers (e.g. propranolol) can enter the central nervous system and cause depression or nightmares.  $\beta$ -blockers can also worsen insulininduced hypoglycaemia in people with diabetes.

#### Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel blockers (see also Chapter 35)

CCBs act by blocking the L-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels that allow depolarisation-mediated influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into smooth muscle cells and also cardiac myocytes (see Chapters and 35). As described in Chapter 35, *dihydropyridine* CCBs such as **amlodipine**, **nifedipine** and **felodipine** act selectively on vascular smooth muscle L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, while the *non-dihydropyridines* **verapamil** and **diltiazem** block these channels in cardiac myocytes as well. The non-dihydropyridine CCBs therefore reduce the heart rate and are referred to as *rate-limiting calcium channel blockers*.

CCBs prevent angina mainly by causing systemic arteriolar vasodilatation and decreasing afterload. They also prevent coronary vasospasm, making them particularly useful in vasospastic angina. The negative inotropic and chronotropic effects of verapamil and diltiazem also contribute to their usefulness by reducing myocardial O<sub>3</sub> demand.

The vasodilatation caused by CCBs can cause hypotension, headache and peripheral oedema (mainly dihydropyridines). The non-dihydropyridines verapamil and diltiazem should not be combined with  $\beta$ -blockers as severe bradycardia and heart failure can ensue.

#### **Nitrovasodilators**

Nitrovasodilators include **glyceryl trinitrate** (GTN), **isosorbide mononitrate**, and **isosorbide dinitrate**. The rapidly acting nitrovasodilator GTN is used to terminate acute attacks of angina, while longer-acting preparations provide long-term reduction in angina symptoms.

Nitrovasodilators are metabolised to release nitric oxide (NO), thus acting as a 'pharmacological endothelium'. GTN is thought to be metabolised mainly by the enzyme mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase, whereas longer acting nitrovasodilators may be metabolised by cytochrome P450. NO stimulates guanylate cyclase to elevate cGMP, thereby causing vasodilatation (see Chapter 24). At therapeutic doses, nitrovasodilators act primarily to dilate veins, thus reducing central venous pressure (preload) and as a consequent ventricular end-diastolic volume. This lowers myocardial contraction, wall stress and O<sub>2</sub> demand. Some arterial dilatation also occurs, diminishing total peripheral resistance (afterload). This allows the left ventricle to maintain cardiac output with less energy expenditure, again decreasing O, demand.

Nitrovasodilators can also increase the perfusion of ischaemic myocardium. They dilate larger coronary arteries (those >100  $\mu$ m in diameter). These give rise to **collateral vessels** (see Chapter 2) which can bypass stenotic arteries. Collaterals increase in number and diameter in the presence of a significant stenosis, providing an alternative perfusion of ischaemic tissue which is then enhanced by the nitrovasodilators. Nitrovasodilators also relieve coronary vasospasm and may diminish plaque-related platelet aggregation and thrombosis by elevating platelet cGMP.

GTN taken sublingually relieves angina within minutes; this route of administration avoids the extensive first-pass metabolism of these drugs associated with oral dosing. Nitrovasodilators can also be given in slowly absorbed oral, transdermal and buccal forms for sustained effect.

Continuous exposure to nitrovasodilators causes **tolerance**. This is caused in part by increased production within blood vessels of reactive oxygen species, which may inactivate NO and also interfere with nitrovasodilator bioconversion. Reflex activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system by nitrovasodilator-induced vasodilatation may also contribute to tolerance. Tolerance is irrelevant with short-acting nitrovasodilators, but long-acting preparations become ineffective within hours. Tolerance can be minimized by 'eccentric' dosing schedules that allow blood concentrations to become low overnight. The most common adverse

effect of nitrovasodilators is headache. Reflex tachycardia and orthostatic hypotension may also occur.

# Other antianginals

**Nicorandil** is a vasodilator with a dual mechanism. It increases the intracellular concentration of cGMP and thereby has nitrate-like effects and also causes smooth muscle cell hyperpolarisation by opening potassium ( $K_{\rm ATP}$ ) channels. **Ivabradine** reduces cardiac ischaemia by inhibiting the cardiac pacemaker current  $I_{\rm f}$  (see Chapter 11) with a resultant reduction in heart rate. **Ranolazine** is thought to work by inhibiting the late Na+ current in cardiac myocytes leading to a reduction in the intracellular calcium concentration. Unlike other antianginals, ranolazine has no clinically significant effect on heart rate or blood pressure. An important potential adverse effect of ranolazine is prolongation of the QT interval due to its action on the outward potassium delayed rectifier current  $I_{\rm Kr}$  during phase 3 of the cardiac action potential. It is therefore contraindicated in individuals with a corrected prolonged QT interval on the ECG.

# Management of microvascular angina

Some patients, but not all, respond to drugs given for stable angina. β-blockers have been shown to be more effective than CCBs or nitrates in the treatment of microvascular angina. Based on evidence from several small recent clinical trials, ranolazine should be considered in those refractory to traditional antianginal agents. The mechanisms by which it can improve symptoms in some patients with microvascular angina are unclear. However, it has been suggested that ranolazine has anti-inflammatory or antioxidant actions that improve coronary endothelial function. In addition, its effect on cardiac cells ameliorates myocardial mechanical dysfunction and may thereby diminish compression of the coronary microvasculature, resulting in a reduction of its resistance. Drugs which modify microvascular function, that is, statins and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) have a role in therapy as these increase coronary flow reserve and exert anti-inflammatory effects on endothelial cells. In patients whose microvascular angina is believed to involve abnormal pain nociception, the serotonin and noradrenaline uptake inhibitor imipramine may be helpful. It has been shown in studies to improve the symptoms of chest pain in patients with unobstructed coronary arteries at angiography.

### **Management of vasospastic angina**

CCBs and nitrovasodilators are used to treat vasospastic angina but  $\beta$ -blockers are not, as they may worsen coronary vasospasm by blocking the  $\beta_2$ -mediated (vasodilating) but not  $\alpha_1$ -mediated (vasoconstricting) effects of sympathetic stimulation.

# Drugs for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease

The reduction of risk factors that contribute to the further progression of coronary artery disease is a key aim of the management of all types of angina. Patients should be treated with 75 mg/day aspirin, which suppresses platelet aggregation and greatly reduces the risk of myocardial infarction and death. They should be offered a statin to reduce their plasma LDL levels. The 2001 HOPE trial showed that the ACEI ramipril reduced the progression of atherosclerosis and enhanced survival over a period of 5 years, in a group with coronary artery disease or diabetes, and ACEI are recommended for patients with stable angina with concomitant conditions (e.g. hypertension or heart failure) for which these drugs are also indicated.
