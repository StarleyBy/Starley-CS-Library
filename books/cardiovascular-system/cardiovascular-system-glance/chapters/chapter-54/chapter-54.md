# **Diseases of the aortic valve**

![](_page_0_Figure_4.jpeg)

he **aortic valve** is a tricuspid valve that permits the flow of blood during systole from the left ventricle (LV) into the LV outflow tract and ascending aorta. Impaired aortic valve opening, due to its narrowing, is known as **aortic stenosis** (AS). It impedes outflow of blood from the LV into the aorta and imposes a **pressure load** on the LV. Deficient valve closure (**aortic regurgitation**, AR) allows blood to flow back into the LV and thus imposes a **volume load** on the LV.

# **Aortic stenosis**

#### Causes

Calcific aortic valve disease, where calcium is deposited at the base of the cusps, is the most common cause of AS. The disease process likely represents proliferative and inflammatory processes involving lipid accumulation, upregulated angiotensin

converting enzyme activity, oxidative stress and T-cell and macrophage infiltration. Calcific AS is more common in people with congenital bicuspid valves and the onset is about 20 years earlier.

**Rheumatic** AS as a result of rheumatic heart disease is unusual without coexisting mitral valve disease. Inflammation and scarring of the aortic valve occur secondary to an autoimmune reaction to group A haemolytic Streptococci.

**Congenital** A **unicuspid aortic valve** is usually fatal within 1 year of birth. **Bicuspid** aortic valves develop progressive fusion of the commissures, and symptoms usually present after 40 years.

#### Pathophysiology

A slow reduction in aortic valve area requires the LV to work harder to expel blood into the aorta, which causes **left ventricular** 

**hypertrophy** and eventual myocardial dysfunction, arrhythmias and **heart failure** (see Chapter 46). **Severe AS** is present when the aortic valve area is <1 cm2 , and the peak gradient across the valve is >40 mmHg with a normal cardiac output. With worsening AS, cardiac output cannot increase adequately during exercise and eventually becomes insufficient at rest. As AS progresses the left ventricle dilates, and LV end‐diastolic pressure (EDP) increases to the point where overt LV failure ensues.

## Clinical features

The classical symptom triad of AS is angina, syncope and breathlessness. Patients present usually between the ages of 50 and 70 years, most commonly with **angina** either due to reduced cardiac output secondary to AS reducing coronary artery perfusion relative to myocardial demand or concurrent coronary artery disease, which is the case in 50%. In AS the hypertrophied LV mass has a higher oxygen demand and inadequate cardiac output for this demand occurs during exercise. Exercise tolerance is decreased, and if cerebral blood flow is insufficient patients may develop **syncope**. Once patients with AS develop angina, syncope or LV failure, their median survival is less than 3 years. Patients with mild AS have a normal blood pressure and pulse. In moderate to severe AS the pulse is slow rising and has a narrow pulse pressure. There may be a demonstrable **thrill** (vibration) felt on palpation over the precordium. The apex beat is **heaving** due to LV hypertrophy. Initially, the apex is non‐displaced; however, once the LV starts dilating in late‐stage AS then it will displace. Auscultation reveals a normal S1, **a quiet S2** and an **ejection systolic murmur** (Figure 54.1; see Chapter 32), heard best in the second intercostal space to the right of the sternum and which classically radiates to the carotids. It is louder with squatting and softer with standing or during the **Valsalva manoeuvre** (forced expiration against a closed glottis). With worsening AS and a fall in cardiac output, the murmur may become softer (**silent AS**).

# Investigations

Echocardiography is the key imaging modality. Echocardiography shows reduced valve opening and calcification of cusps and permits calculation of valve area. Doppler imaging allows calculation of the pressure gradient across the valve.

# Management

No medical therapy has been proven to delay the progression of AS. **Aortic valve replacement** surgery is the treatment of choice for symptomatic AS in patients who are suitable. When valve intervention is planned it is important that it is done before the LV starts to dilate. **Coronary angiography** is performed as part of the pre‐operative workup, and coronary artery bypass performed during the same operation if significant disease is present. Mechanical valves require **anticoagulation** (see Chapter 8). Bovine or porcine valves do not; hence these can be used in women of childbearing age, because warfarin is teratogenic. In those who are not surgical candidates, **transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)** can be offered. This procedure involves using a balloon catheter to dilate the stenosed valve and deliver a new valve which sits inside the diseased one. An option for the frailest patients is **balloon valvuloplasty**, which dilates the stenosed valve.

# Aortic regurgitation

AR occurs when the valve cannot close firmly at the end of ventricular systole and as a result blood flows back into the ventricle from the aorta at the start of diastole.

#### Causes

Causes of AR include **rheumatic disease**, where fibrous retraction of the valve cusps prevents apposition, **infective endocarditis** causing valve damage and **congenital malformations** (e.g. bicuspid valve) (Figure 54.2).

### Pathophysiology

AR imposes a volume load on the LV because of flow back into the ventricle. **Acute AR** (trauma, infective endocarditis, aortic dissection) is usually catastrophic. Here the LV cannot accommodate the acute increase in volume and LV EDP rises. The early increase in LV EDP causes premature closure of the mitral valve and inadequate forward LV filling, resulting in cardiovascular collapse and acute respiratory failure.

In **chronic AR**, volume load and LV EDP increase gradually, and **LV hypertrophy** allows adequate output to be maintained. As the aortic valve never completely closes, there is no LV isovolumetric relaxation phase (see Chapter 16) and the pulse pressure is wide.

## Clinical features

Patients usually do not present with symptoms until LV failure develops. Signs include a wide pulse pressure (caused by reduction in diastolic pressure) and a **collapsing pulse** (see Chapter 16). The LV apex is displaced laterally and is hyperdynamic. Auscultation reveals a high‐pitched **early diastolic murmur** at the left sternal edge and often a **systolic flow murmur** across the aortic valve. AR is associated with several eponymous signs. While these are rare in clinical practice, they are favoured by some finals examiners. **Quincke's sign** is visible nail bed pulsation; **Corrigan's sign** denotes visible pulsations in the carotids; **de Musset's sign** is pulsatile head bobbing; **Traube's sign** is a 'pistol shot' heard on auscultation of the femoral arteries; the **Austin Flint murmur** is a **rumbling late diastolic murmur** caused by premature closure of the mitral valve; it denotes **severe AR**.

### Investigations

Echocardiography can determine the aetiology and severity of AR by imaging the valve leaflets and LV dimensions, aortic root diameter and diastolic closure or fluttering of the mitral valve. Doppler imaging quantifies the amount of regurgitation.

# Management

Acute severe AR requires urgent valve replacement. Chronic AR has a generally good prognosis until symptoms develop. Patients with moderate AR should undergo echocardiography every 6–12 months. Valve replacement should be considered in symptomatic patients, or in asymptomatic patients with worsening LV dimensions, LV function or aortic root diameter. Valve replacement is similar to that for AS, except that replacement of the aortic root may also be required in patients with a severely dilated ascending aorta.
