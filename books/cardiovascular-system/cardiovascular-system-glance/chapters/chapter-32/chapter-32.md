# History and examination of the cardiovascular system

![](_page_0_Figure_4.jpeg)

#### **History**

**Presenting complaint** The reason for seeking medical attention. Examples are chest pain or discomfort, shortness of breath (dyspnoea), palpitations, oedema, and dizziness (presyncope) or collapse/blackouts (syncope).

*History of presenting complaint* Explore the features of the presenting complaint, such as onset, progression, severity, and aggravating and relieving factors (Figure 32.1).

When eliciting a history from a patient with chest pain, the goal is to ascertain whether the pain is cardiac in origin or not. Pain that is sharp, pleuritic or reproducible on palpation of the chest wall is usually noncardiac, whereas pain that radiates to either arm or shoulders or is exertional is more likely to be cardiac. A notable

exception is the sharp pleuritic pain of pericarditis that is classically relieved by leaning forwards as this separates the inflamed pericardial layers.

- **Dyspnoea:** Establish whether it occurs at rest, on exertion, on lying flat (**orthopnoea**) or at night. Ask how far the patient can walk without being breathless. Determine the rate of onset (sudden, gradual). Sudden onset dyspnoea is suggestive of myocardial damage or pulmonary embolism. Gradual onset is suggestive of heart failure or valve disease. Dyspnoea due to pulmonary oedema may cause **paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea**, a frightening experience in which the patient wakes at night, gasping for breath.
- **Palpitations:** increased awareness of the heartbeat. Ask the patient to tap out the rhythm is it regular or irregular, slow or

fast? Do the palpitations have associated features, that is, chest pain, dyspnoea, presyncope or syncope?

- **Syncope:** transient loss of consciousness caused by global cerebral hypoperfusion. Establish whether the 3 Ps are present – *position* (e.g. syncope brought on by standing for extended periods), *provoking features* (e.g. dehydration), *prodrome* (e.g. dizziness)? If they are then a vasovagal episode (neurocardiogenic syncope) is most likely; if not then the cause may be cardiogenic.
- **Others:** fatigue heart failure, arrhythmias and drugs (e.g. β‐ blockers). Oedema and abdominal discomfort – raised central venous pressure (CVP), heart failure. Leg pain on walking that is relieved by rest (**intermittent claudication**) is due to peripheral vascular disease.

*Past medical history* Ask specifically about myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, rheumatic fever. Also recent blood pressure measurements and lipid levels, and any cardiac investigations.

*Drug history* Prescribed and over‐the‐counter medications. Ascertain compliance. Ask about **drug allergies/sensitivities** and their effect(s).

*Family, occupational and social history* Family history of premature cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, stroke or sudden cardiac death? **Smoking:** quantify in pack years; **alcohol** consumption. **Occupation**: sedentary or active.

## Examination

## General examination (Figure 32.1)

Assess general appearance: obesity, cachexia (wasting). Note any scars; for example, a sternotomy scar (coronary artery bypass graft, CABG; valve surgery). If a sternotomy scar is present, inspect the legs for a saphenous vein graft scar.

- **Hands:** warm and well perfused or cold and shut down? Peripheral cyanosis (dusky blue discolouration, deoxyhaemoglobin >5 g/dL, that is, vasoconstriction, shock, heart failure); assess capillary refill by pressing on the nail bed for 5 s and releasing. Normal is <2 s. Inspect nails for clubbing (Figure 32.1), tar stains, splinter haemorrhages (infective endocarditis). Inspect the palms for Janeway lesions and Osler's nodes (also found in infective endocarditis but these signs are rare).
- **Pulses:** radial pulse; assess rate and character (regular or irregular). Feel for a collapsing pulse (aortic regurgitation). Is there radio‐radial delay (coarctation of the aorta)?
- **Blood pressure:** measure the blood pressure over the brachial artery in both arms and take the highest reading.
- **Face and neck:** locate the jugular venous pressure (JVP) wave. It aids in the estimation of volume status. Determine whether or not it is raised. It is raised if the tip of the pulsation in the internal jugular vein is >3 cm above the angle of Louis (where the manubrium meets the sternum). In overweight individuals the JVP may not be visible. Feel the carotid pulse and assess its volume and character. Inspect the conjunctivae for pallor (anaemia); cornea for arcus (hyperlipidaemia, although normal in old age); eyelids for xanthelasma (soft yellow plaques: hyperlipidaemia); tongue for central cyanosis (significant right‐to‐left shunting); dental hygiene (infective endocarditis); is the palate high arched? (Marfan's); cheeks for malar flush (mitral valve disease); perform fundoscopy looking for hypertensive or diabetic retinopathy.

### Examination of the praecordium

• **Palpation: apex beat**, usually at fifth intercostal space, midclavicular line (mitral area). *Non‐palpable*: obesity, hyperinflated

- lungs of chronic obstructive airways disease, pleural effusion. *Displaced*: cardiomegaly, dilated cardiomyopathy, pneumothorax. *Tapping*: mitral stenosis. *Double impulse*: ventricular hypertrophy. *Heaving* (forceful and sustained): pressure overload – hypertension, aortic stenosis. *Parasternal heave*: right ventricular hypertrophy. **Thrills** are palpable (therefore forceful) murmurs (see below). Is there an implanted pacemaker or defibrillator?
- **Auscultation** (Figure 32.2; see Chapters 14, 54–55): correlate with radial or carotid pulse. **First heart sound** (**S1**): closure of mitral and tricuspid valves. *Loud*: atrioventricular valve stenosis, short PR interval; *soft*: mitral regurgitation, long PR interval, heart failure. **Second heart sound** (**S2**): closure of aortic (A2) and pulmonary (P2) valves, A2 louder and preceding P2. *Loud* A2/P2: systemic/pulmonary hypertension. *Splitting*: normal during inspiration or exercise, particularly in the young. *Wide splitting*: delayed activation (e.g. right bundle branch block) or termination (pulmonary hypertension, stenosis) of RV systole. *Reverse splitting*: delayed activation (e.g. left bundle branch block) or termination (hypertension, aortic stenosis) of LV systole. **Others**: **S3** – rapid ventricular filling, common in the young but may reflect heart failure in older patients. **S4** – precedes S1, due to ventricular stiffness and abnormal filling during atrial systole. Presence of S3 and/or S4 gives a **gallop rhythm**. **Ejection click**: after S1, opening of stenotic semilunar valve. **Opening snap**: after S2, opening of stenotic atrioventricular valve.
- **Murmurs** (Figure 32.2): added sounds due to turbulent blood flow. Soft systolic murmurs are common and innocent in the young (∼40% children aged 3–8 years) and in exercise; **diastolic murmurs** are pathological. Most nonbenign murmurs are due to **valve defects** (Chapters 54–55) but can be due to a hyperdynamic circulation and atrial or ventricular septal defects.
- **Abdomen:** palpate for liver enlargement (**hepatomegaly**), ascites (raised JVP, heart failure), splenomegaly (infective endocarditis). The **abdominal aorta** is pulsatile in thin individuals but not expansile (indicates **abdominal aortic aneurysm**).
- **Lower limbs:** pitting oedema; arterial and venous ulcers of peripheral vascular disease.

#### Pulse

Resting rate 60–90 beats/min, slows with age and fitness. Compare radial with apex beat (delay: e.g. atrial fibrillation) and femoral/ lower limbs (delay: atherosclerosis, aortic stenosis). Changes in rate with breathing are normal (**sinus arrhythmia**).

- **Irregular beats** *Regularly irregular*: that is, extrasystoles (disappear on exertion), second degree heart block. *Irregularly irregular*: that is, atrial fibrillation (unchanged by exertion).
- **Character** (carotid): *thready or weak*: heart failure, shock, valve disease; *slow rising*: aortic stenosis. *Bounding*: high output; followed by *sharp fall* (*collapsing*): very high output, aortic regurgitation. *Alternating weak–strong* (*pulsus alternans*): left heart failure; distinguish from **pulsus bigeminus**, normal beat followed by weak premature beat. *Pulsus paradoxus, accentuated weakening of pulse on inspiration*: cardiac tamponade, severe asthma, restrictive pericarditis.

#### Blood pressure (Figure 32.3)

At rest, adult arterial systolic pressure is normally <140 mmHg and the diastolic pressure is usually <90 mmHg. Systolic pressure rises with age.

• **JVP** (Figure 32.4): Indirect measure of right atrial pressure. Raised in heart failure and volume overload. Large 'a' wave (see Chapter 16): pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary valve stenosis, tricuspid stenosis; large 'v' wave: tricuspid regurgitation. Absent 'a' wave: atrial fibrillation.
