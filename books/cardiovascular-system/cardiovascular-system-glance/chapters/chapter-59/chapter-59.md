Figure 59.4 Stroke symptoms due to arterial occlusion at different sites

Middle cerebral artery: supplies the largest part of the cerebral cortex and is most common site of strokes

- Occlusion here causes contralateral paralysis (hemiplegia) or weakness (hemiparesis), also hemisensory loss in head/arm (e.g. homonymous hemianopia – blindness over one half of visual field of both eyes).
- With dominant hemisphere stroke: speech/language dysfunction (aphasia) and dyspraxia (inability to carry out complex movements)
- With non-dominant hemisphere stroke: hemispatial neglect (deficient awareness of stimuli on one side of the head/arm)

Anterior cerebral artery - distal to the anterior communicating artery (which provides an alternative circulation): • Occlusion here causes contralateral hemiplegia/hemiparesis, hemisensory loss in leg/foot; incontinence.

#### Posterior cerebral artery

• Occlusion here causes homonymous hemianopia, visual agnosia (objects can be seen but not recognised), memory deficit

#### Internal carotid artery:

• Occlusion here is often fatal since so much of the cerebrum is supplied by branches of this artery; symptoms resemble those of middle cerebral artery occlusion

#### Vertebrobasilar arteries:

- An extensive stroke here is usually fatal.
- Occlusion of smaller arteries can cause a wide variety of symptoms depending on which region is affected. These may include coma, quadriplegia, ataxia (loss of coordination), visual deficits, dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing), dysarthria (difficulty in speaking), nausea, vertigo, Horner syndrome

troke (cerebrovascular infarct), the second leading cause of death and the largest source of disability worldwide, is defined as a sudden onset neurological deficit which is of cerebrovascular cause, is associated with a central nervous system infarct, and persists for more than 24 hours. Ischaemic stroke (~85% of cases) is usually due to a focal reduction of blood flow within the CNS caused by arterial thrombosis or embolism (e.g. due to atrial fibrillation), intracranial venous thrombosis, or is of undetermined cause. Haemorrhagic stroke (~15% of cases) is due to intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH, bleeding in the brain) or subarachnoid haemorrhage (bleeding between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater). A stroke is said to be *completed* when symptoms have reached a stable maximum. Transient ischaemic attack (TIA) is neurological dysfunction associated with focal cerebral, spinal cord or retinal ischaemia that lasts <24 hours (typically <15 minutes). TIA is not associated with infarct but indicates a high risk of future stroke.

**Blood supply to the brain** As shown in Figures 59.1–59.3, most of the cerebrum is supplied with blood through the middle and anterior cerebral arteries (yellow and green regions, respectively, in Figures 59.2-59.3), which are branches of the internal carotid arteries (the anterior circulation). However, parts of the temporal and occipital lobes (blue regions, Figures 59.2-59.3) receive their blood from the posterior cerebral arteries. These arise from the basilar artery, which is formed by the anastomosis of the vertebral arteries. The vertebrobasilar arteries (the posterior circulation) also give rise to arteries supplying blood to the medulla, pons, cerebellum, thalamus, and the midbrain. The Circle of Willis (Figure 59.1), which is formed from the anastomosis of arteries of the anterior and posterior circulations and their communicating branches, allows blood from either the posterior or anterior circulations to reach any part of the cerebrum. This redundancy of supply can potentially ameliorate the effects of a slowly developing vascular occlusion in the internal carotid or vertebral arteries, although the extent to which this occurs is variable since the calibre of the communicating arteries differs between individuals.

## Stroke signs, symptoms and risk factors

**Signs and symptoms of stroke** depend on the site of the infarct, as shown in Figure 59.4. **Stroke prognosis** also depends on the site and size of the infarct, with infarct in the territory of the middle cerebral artery being particularly dangerous. **Stroke risk** doubles every 10 years after age 55, such that in the UK approximately 18% of the population will have had a stroke by age 75. The largest modifiable risk factor for stroke is hypertension (increases risk fivefold). Diabetes, atherosclerosis, atrial fibrillation, smoking, hyperlipidaemia, high alcohol consumption and sickle cell disease are other important risk factors.

### **Pathogenesis**

The developing lesion in stroke consists of an **ischaemic core** where blood flow has fallen drastically due to occlusion of a cerebral artery, surrounded by a **penumbra** in which blood flow is less markedly reduced because of the existence of collateral circulation from other arteries. Cells in the ischaemic core die within minutes, whereas those in the penumbra have a depressed electrical activity and will die over a period of hours but have the potential to recover if blood flow is restored quickly enough (e.g. by thrombolysis).

As described in Chapter 26, brain cells require a very high blood flow to maintain cellular ATP stores. These are therefore depleted within minutes in the ischaemic core, causing failure of the Na+, K+ ATPase and a consequent rundown of the neuronal transmembrane Na+ and K+ gradients which causes cell depolarization. This opens voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, leading to a rise in cell [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] which is exaggerated by failure of the ATP-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> pump which extrudes Ca2+ from cells. Neuronal depolarization also causes a greatly increased release of glutamate, the most abundant neurotransmitter in the CNS. Glutamate acts on a variety of receptors, one of which, the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), is a Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable ion channel that is particularly sensitive to depolarization. Astrocytic uptake of glutamate, which normally controls its extracellular concentration, also fails due to ischaemia, further promoting the rise in extracellular [glutamate]. This leads to excitotoxicity, a vicious cycle of increasing Na+ and Ca2+ influx and glutamate release which results in activation of destructive enzymes, production of reactive oxygen species, cell swelling, membrane rupture, and necrosis in the ischaemic core.

Cell death in the penumbra is more gradual and occurs mainly by **apoptosis** (programmed cell death), a process which can be initiated by multiple stimuli including NMDAR -induced rises in cell [Ca²+] and the binding of ligands to cellular death receptors. Activation of NMDAR in the penumbra is associated with **spreading depolarizations**. These are long-lasting waves of depolarization which are initiated by the breakdown of the membrane potential in the ischaemic core and spread out through the penumbra as slow-moving waves, causing vasoconstriction and glutamate release as they spread. Apoptosis is also promoted by inflammation, which is driven both by activation of **microglial cells** (resident macrophages in the brain) and by the entry of leukocytes and lymphocytes from the circulation which occurs due to local disruption of the blood–brain barrier and results in the release of TNF $\alpha$  and other death receptor ligands.

### **Investigations**

Speed is critical in the diagnosis and treatment of stroke, as irreversible brain damage progresses rapidly. In those with a sudden onset of neurological symptoms, the FAST (Face Arm Speech Test) can be used anywhere to screen for possible stroke; once in hospital the ROSIER (Rule Out Stroke In the Emergency Room) or National Institutes of Health Health Stroke Scale questionnaires can be used for more definitive diagnosis. Patients should receive an immediate brain scan using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) to identify the site of the infarct and distinguish between ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke, as the treatments for these differ. Blood tests are done to rule out hypoglycaemia (symptoms can mimic those of stroke) and check for polycythaemia (since increases in blood viscosity and can cause stroke). An ECG is taken because emboli resulting from atrial fibrillation or MI are common causes of ischaemic stroke.

### **Acute management**

Stroke patients should be treated in a **specialist stroke care unit,** as this improves prognosis. Supportive treatment for ischaemic stroke includes maintaining a stable arterial  $\rm O_2$  saturation (> 93%), temperature (< 37.5°C), and blood glucose (< 180 mg/dl), as high temperature and hyperglycaemia worsen the infarct. Antihypertensive treatment should be used in patients with SBP >180 mmHg who are thrombolysed. Continual cardiac monitoring is necessary for several days.

Ischaemic stroke can be treated with **tissue plasminogen activator** (tPA, alteplase), the aim being to dissolve the blood clot in the affected cerebral artery, restore blood flow, and thereby promote recovery of tissue in the ischaemic penumbra. tPA does not affect survival but improves the chances of functional recovery. Its effectiveness decreases rapidly as treatment is delayed, so it is given *only* if symptoms are known to have been present for less than 4.5 hours. tPA is used only if a brain scan has ruled out ICH and is absolutely contraindicated by concurrent anticoagulant treatment, recent GI bleeding or surgery/major trauma/head injury, and severe hypertension. 0.9 mg/kg of tPA is given intravenously, with 10% injected as a bolus and the rest infused over an hour. 300 mg aspirin should also be administered immediately to limit further thrombosis and continued for a lower dose for 2 weeks or until discharge from hospital, after which long‐term antithrombotic treatment should be started.

In strokes due to thrombosis of the proximal middle cerebral or internal carotid arteries, mechanical removal of the thrombus (**thrombectomy**) is a relatively new treatment which can improve functional outcome. Thrombectomy can be combined with thrombolysis or can be used as an alternative to thrombolysis in patients who are on anticoagulants.

# Haemorrhagic stroke

There are no specific treatments for ICH, and management revolves around 'active care', in which patients are monitored to allow rapid intervention to prevent neurological worsening and the occurrence of further complications. For example, hypertension, hyperglycaemia and fever all worsen outcome and should be controlled. Antithrombotic treatment is an important predisposing factor for haemorrhagic stroke and worsens outcome; patients on warfarin can be given IV vitamin K and prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), whereas those on a direct acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC; see Chapter 8) can be given PCC or a specific antidote (e.g. idarucizumab for dabigatran).

# Long‐term management, rehabilitation and secondary prevention

Secondary prevention for ischaemic stroke includes careful control of vascular risk factors such as smoking, diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol. Patients with atrial fibrillation should be treated with a DOAC or warfarin. Secondary prevention for ICH focuses on strict control of hypertension.
