B lock of the cardiac conduction system, which can occur at various levels, is the cause of a number of important arrhythmias (see also Chapter 13).

## Atrioventricular block

Atrioventricular (AV) block occurs when an atrial impulse is not conducted to the ventricle or is conducted with delay; there are three types (illustrated in Chapter 13).

**First‐degree AV block:** delayed conduction from the atria to the ventricles; all atrial impulses are conducted but with a PR interval longer than 0.2 seconds (Figure 13.3.3). Causes include intrinsic disease of the AV node and/or His‐Purkinje system, high vagal tone (slows AV conduction), and drugs which slow AV node conduction, that is, calcium channel blockers, β‐blockers or digoxin. May occur in aortic stenosis or in aortic root abscess because the aortic valve is in close proximity to the AV node. *Treatment:* None required unless the PR interval is particularly prolonged (>300 ms), which may result in lightheadedness and dizziness. In these cases a pacemaker is indicated.

**Second‐degree AV block:** some but not all atrial impulses are conducted to the ventricle; it is subdivided into Mobitz types I and II.

**Mobitz type I** (or **Wenckebach**) is characterised by progressive lengthening of the PR interval until there is a non‐conducted P wave (Figure 13.3.5). The defect is almost always located within the AV node. This is a common and usually benign variant but can be caused by intrinsic disease of AV node, AV nodal blocking drugs, Lyme disease and myocarditis, and rarely by radiofrequency catheter ablation of AV nodal re‐entrant pathways. *Treatment*: None if asymptomatic, as there is a very low chance of progression to higher grades of AV block. However, if the associated QRS complex is broad, indicating that the block is located in the His‐ Purkinje system, the likelihood of progressing to higher degrees of AV block is greater. In these instances, implantation of a permanent pacemaker is indicated.

**Mobitz type II** is characterised by intermittent conduction of P waves but with fixed P‐P and PR intervals. The block is located within the His‐Purkinje system and has a high likelihood of progression to complete heart block. The QRS complex is usually broad. Causes include intrinsic disease of the His‐Purkinje system, drugs which slow conduction through this system (e.g. flecainide, quinidine, propafenone), coronary artery disease, and infiltrative conditions such as sarcoid, amyloid and Lyme disease. *Treatment:* as risk is high, implantation of a permanent pacemaker is indicated.

**Second‐degree AV block with 2:1 conduction** (Figure 13.3.4) occurs when alternate P waves are conducted to the ventricles, potentially making diagnosis of Mobitz type I or II difficult. If the QRS is narrow, the block is most likely within the AV node. *Treatment:* If the block is located in the His‐Purkinje system then a permanent pacemaker is indicated.

**Third‐degree AV block (complete heart block; CHB):** no P waves are conducted to the ventricles. There is complete dissociation of atrial (P waves) and ventricular (QRS complex) activity (**AV dissociation**), with atrial rhythm faster than ventricular rhythm. The latter now originates in either the AV nodal junction (**junctional escape rhythm**, narrow QRS; Figure 13.3.6) or ventricles (**ventricular escape rhythm**, broad QRS; Figure 53.1). The latter is slower than junctional escape rhythm at typically <40 bpm. CHB can occur with atrial sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation. Causes of CHB include ischaemia, electrolyte abnormalities and antiarrhythmic drugs. *Treatment*: potentially reversible causes must be treated before considering permanent pacing, which is normally indicated unless the block persists for less than 1–2 weeks after myocardial infarction and the patient is asymptomatic.

## Bundle branch block

**Left bundle branch block (LBBB)** means that the left ventricle has to be activated by impulses transmitted via the myocardium (i.e. slow conduction) from the right bundle branch of His. It is associated with typical changes in the 12 lead ECG, with a wide, negative QRS in lead V1 and prominent R waves in leads I, aVL and V6 (Figure 53.2). Activation of the left ventricle is delayed, causing it to contract later than the right ventricle; as a result the aortic valve closes later than the pulmonary valve. Causes: most often underlying heart disease (e.g. coronary heart disease, cardiomyopathy) but also ageing of the conduction pathways. *Treatment***:** a pacemaker may be indicated by a history of syncope; LBBB results in ventricular dysynchrony in patients with significant LV dysfunction and may contribute to heart failure; such patients may be treated with a **cardiac resynchronisation device** (see below).

**Right bundle branch block (RBBB)** means that the right ventricle has to be activated via the left bundle branch and its fascicles. It is associated with a distinctive pattern on the ECG, with a wide QRS of >120 ms duration and an rSR' pattern in lead V1, with wide S waves in leads I, aVL and V5‐V6 (Figure 53.3). Causes: RBBB can occur in healthy hearts with the incidence increasing with age. It is associated with structural heart disease and can occur following myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism and myocarditis. **Treatment:** Usually none.

**Bifascicular block** involves conduction delay due to RBBB plus block of left anterior (most common) or left posterior fascicles. The ECG demonstrates RBBB plus left or right axis deviation. Causes include ischaemic heart disease, hypertension and aortic stenosis. *Treatment:* requires implantation of a pacemaker only if symptoms are present due to progression to second‐ or third‐ degree AV block.

**Trifascicular block** is a term widely used in clinical practice to describe bifascicular block in combination with first‐degree AV block. This is technically incorrect, since first‐degree AV block occurs not in a fascicle but in the AV node. Trifascicular block is associated with underlying structural heart disease, such as coronary artery disease or degenerative disease of the conduction system and can progress to complete heart block. *Treatment:* Trifascicular block in association with syncope is an indication for a permanent pacemaker.

## Pacing systems

Pacing systems can be used either temporarily or permanently to initiate the heartbeat by imposing repeated cardiac depolarisations. **Temporary pacing** is generally accomplished using a catheter‐tipped electrode introduced via a large vein and provides for the rapid treatment of life‐threatening bradycardias. A temporary pacemaker can also be used to terminate a persistent arrhythmia by pacing the heart at a rate faster than that of the arrhythmia; sinus rhythm is often restored when this **overdrive pacing** is stopped. **Permanent pacemakers** are usually implanted to treat bradyarrhythmias. The pacemaker generator is implanted under the subcutaneous tissue above the pectoral muscle inferior to the clavicle and stimulates the heart through leads introduced into the heart via the cephalic, axillary or subclavian vein. Pacemakers are able to pace both the atria and ventricles to maintain AV synchronisation and to adjust the pacemaking frequency to respond to changes in physical activity by sensing parameters such as respiration and the interval between the stimulated depolarisation and the T wave, a measure of sympathetic nervous system activity.

Pacemakers may be single or dual chamber. A **single chamber pacemaker** has one lead to carry impulses to and from either the right atrium or the right ventricle. These devices are usually implanted in people whose underlying rhythm is atrial fibrillation. A **dual chamber pacemaker** has two leads, one to the right atrium and one to the right ventricle. This allows the pacemaker to create a rhythm that more closely resembles the natural conduction activity of the heart. **Biventricular pacemakers** have three leads: one to the right atrium and one to each ventricle. These are called **cardiac resynchronisation devices** and they aim to restore ventricular synchrony to enable more efficient cardiac contraction and improvement in heart failure symptoms.
