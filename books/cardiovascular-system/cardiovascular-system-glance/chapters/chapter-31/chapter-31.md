Figure 31.7 A classification of shock

Symptoms may depend on rate as well as volume of blood loss, and general health and fitness. Note that an increased heart rate may be the only overt symptom of quite significant cardiovascular shock

ardiovascular or circulatory shock is an acute condition where there is a generalized inadequacy of tissue blood flow. The patient appears pale, grey or cyanotic, with cold clammy skin, a weak rapid pulse and rapid shallow breathing. Urine output is reduced and blood pressure (BP) is generally low. Conscious patients may develop intense thirst. Cardiovascular shock may be caused by a reduced blood volume (hypovolaemic shock), profound vasodilatation (low-resistance shock), acute failure of the heart to maintain output (cardiogenic shock) or blockage of the cardiopulmonary circuit (e.g. pulmonary embolism) (Figures 31.1, 31.2).

### **Haemorrhagic shock**

Blood loss (haemorrhage) is the most common cause of hypovolaemic shock. Loss of 15% of total blood volume is unlikely to elicit shock in a fit person. Shock is normally induced if 15–30% of blood volume is lost, though blood pressure may be normal. Loss of 30–50% of volume, however, causes a reduction in BP and cardiac output which can be profound (Figure 31.3). Severe shock may become irreversible or refractory (see below); death is generally inevitable if blood loss is >50%. Figure 31.7 shows a common classification of shock, but severity is also related to rate of blood loss – a very rapid loss of 30% can be fatal, whereas 50% over 24 h may be survived.

#### **Immediate compensation**

The initial fall in BP is detected by the baroreceptors, and reduced blood flow activates peripheral chemoreceptors. These cause a reflex increase in sympathetic and decrease in parasympathetic drive, with a subsequent increase in heart rate, venoconstriction (to restore central venous pressure, CVP), and vasoconstriction of splanchnic, cutaneous, renal and skeletal muscle circulations which helps restore BP. This leads to pallor, reduced urine production and lactic acidosis. Increased sympathetic discharge also causes sweating and characteristic clammy skin. Sympathetic vasoconstriction of renal arteries plus reduced renal artery pressure stimulates the renin-angiotensin system (Chapter 29), and production of **angiotensin 2**, a powerful vasoconstrictor. This has an important role in the recovery of BP and stimulates thirst. In more severe blood loss, reduction in atrial stretch receptor output stimulates production of ADH (antidiuretic hormone, vasopressin) and adrenal production of adrenaline (epinephrine), both of which contribute to vasoconstriction. These initial mechanisms may prevent any significant fall in BP or cardiac output following moderate blood loss, even though the degree of shock may be serious. If BP falls below 50 mmHg the CNS ischaemic response is activated, with powerful sympathetic activation (Figure 31.3).

#### **Medium- and long-term mechanisms**

Vasoconstriction and/or fall in BP decreases capillary hydrostatic pressure, resulting in fluid movement from the interstitium back into the vasculature (Chapter 21). This 'internal transfusion' may increase blood volume by  $\sim 0.5$  L and takes hours to develop. Increased glucose production by the liver may contribute by raising plasma and interstitial fluid osmolarity, thus drawing water from intracellular compartments. This process results in haemodilution, and patients with severe shock often present with a reduced haematocrit (a warning sign for internal haemorrhage). Fluid volume is restored over a few days by increased fluid intake (thirst), decreased urine production (oliguria; due to renal vasoconstriction), increased Na+ reabsorption due to production of aldosterone

(stimulated by angiotensin 2) and a fall in atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and an ADH-mediated increase in water reabsorption (Figure 31.4). The liver replaces plasma proteins within a week, and haematocrit is restored within 6 weeks due to stimulation of **erythropoiesis** (Figure 31.4; Chapter 6).

Other responses to haemorrhage are *increased ventilation* due to reduced flow through **chemoreceptors** (carotid body) and/or acidosis; *decreased blood coagulation time* during a rapid but transient increase in platelets and fibrinogen (Chapter 7); and *increased white cell (neutrophil) count* after 2–5 h.

# Complications and irreversible (refractory) shock

When blood loss exceeds 30%, cardiac output may temporarily improve before declining again (progressive shock; Figure 31.5). This is due to a vicious circle initiated by circulatory failure and tissue hypoxia/ischaemia, leading to acidosis, toxin release and eventually multiorgan failure, including depression of cardiac muscle function, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hepatic failure and damage to intestinal mucosa. Increased vascular permeability further decreases blood volume as fluid is lost to the tissues, and vascular tone is depressed. These complications lead to further tissue damage, impairment of tissue perfusion and gas exchange (Figure 31.6). Rapid treatment (e.g. transfusion) is essential; after 1 h ('the golden hour') mortality increases sharply if the patient is still in shock, as transfusion and vasoconstrictor drugs may then cause only a temporary respite before cardiac output falls irrevocably. This is irreversible or refractory shock (Figure 31.5), primarily related to irretrievable damage to the heart.

## Other types of hypovolaemic shock

Severe burns cause loss of plasma in exudate from damaged tissue. As red cells are not lost, there is haemoconcentration, which increases blood viscosity. Treatment of burns-related shock therefore involves infusion of plasma rather than whole blood. Traumatic and surgical shock can occur after major injury or surgery. Although partly due to external blood loss, blood and plasma can also be lost into the tissues, and there may be dehydration. Other conditions include severe diarrhoea or vomiting and loss of Na<sup>+</sup> (e.g. cholera) with a consequent reduction in blood volume even if water is given, unless electrolytes are replenished.

#### **Low-resistance shock**

Unlike hypovolaemic shock, low-resistance shock may present with warm skin due to profound peripheral vasodilatation.

**Septic shock** is caused by profound vasodilatation due to endotoxins released by infecting bacteria, partly via induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (Chapter 24). Capillary permeability and cardiac function may be impaired, with consequent loss of fluid to the tissues and depressed cardiac output.

Anaphylactic shock is a rapidly developing and life-threatening condition resulting from presentation of antigen to a sensitized individual (e.g. bee stings or peanut allergy). A severe allergic reaction may result, with release of large amounts of histamine. This causes profound vasodilatation and increased microvasculature permeability, leading to protein and fluid loss to tissues (oedema). Rapid treatment with antihistamines and glucocorticoids is necessary, but immediate application of a vasoconstrictor (adrenaline) may be required to save the patient's life.
