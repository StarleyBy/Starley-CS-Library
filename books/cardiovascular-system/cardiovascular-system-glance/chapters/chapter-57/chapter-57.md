## Cardiomyopathies and channelopathies

![](_page_0_Figure_4.jpeg)

C ardiomyopathies are diseases of cardiac muscle and, along with channelopathies, the most common medical cause of sudden cardiac death in people under 35.

## Cardiomyopathies (Figure 57.1)

**Dilated cardiomyopathy** (DCM) is relatively common, with highest incidence in males and middle age. It is characterised by ventricular and atrial dilation and impaired systolic function and is the **third most common cause of heart failure** and most **frequent reason for heart transplants**. Symptoms may be absent or slow in onset and are similar to those for heart failure (Chapter 46) including dyspnoea, oedema and arrhythmias. Most cases are idiopathic (unknown aetiology), though ~35% show **autosomal dominant** inheritance; genes encoding sarcomere and cytoskeletal proteins have been implicated, including β myosin heavy chain, troponin and dystrophin. DCM can also be **acquired** in **myocarditis**

(inflammation of cardiac muscle), for example, viral infections, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), chronic alcohol or cocaine abuse. One in 4000 women develop DCM just before or after childbirth (**peripartum cardiomyopathy**), attributed to inflammatory cytokines. Management is similar to that for heart failure (Chapter 47) and aimed at controlling symptoms and life‐threatening arrhythmias.

**Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy** (HCM) is the most common genetic cardiac disease, with a prevalence of 1 in 500. Although generally asymptomatic, it is the leading cause of **sudden cardiac death** in young athletes and a significant cause in the general population. HCM is associated with septal and left ventricular hypertrophy, often **asymmetric,** caused by disordered myocardial growth. This is frequently coupled to **left ventricular outflow tract obstruction** and valve dysfunction, conduction defects and arrhythmias. Inheritance is **autosomal dominant**. Mutations in sarcomere‐related genes are present in 60% of cases, most commonly β myosin heavy chain (~45%) and cardiac myosin binding protein C (~35%). Clinical features are variable, ranging from asymptomatic to dyspnoea, angina, palpitations and syncope and, in a minority, heart failure, stroke and sudden cardiac death. Moderate symptoms are treated with  $\beta$ -blockers and/or verapamil, severe cases require surgery for outflow tract obstruction, and high-risk patients benefit from an **implantable cardioverter defibrillator** (ICD).

Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is rare and characterised by abnormal diastolic function due to reduced ventricular wall compliance and impaired filling. It invariably progresses to heart failure (Chapter 46). Symptoms include dyspnoea on exertion and syncope. It is often idiopathic though 30% of cases have a family history; it may involve similar genetic abnormalities as HCM. RCM can be secondary to infiltrative disorders including amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, some metabolic conditions and haemochromatosis (iron overload), and also fibrosis following radiation treatment.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (or dysplasia) (ARVC) is a rare, (1 in 5000) autosomal dominant inherited condition which can cause sudden cardiac death, particularly in the young. Right (and sometimes left) ventricular muscle is replaced with fibrous-fatty tissue, with disorganised electrical conduction leading to re-entrant ventricular tachycardias and arrhythmias. Genes linked to ARVC encode for desmosome proteins (Chapters 2, 13), suggesting a role for gap junctions. Presentation varies widely; management is focused on antiarrhythmic therapy and ICDs.

**Stress** (**Takotsubo**) **cardiomyopathy** (TCM; aka *broken heart syndrome*) is characterized by acute but rapidly reversible left ventricular systolic dysfunction, often localised to the apical region causing ballooning (like a Japanese octopus pot: *takotsubo*). It occurs after **severe emotional or psychological stress**, for example, intense grief or anger, serious accidents, although sometimes there is no obvious trigger. Clinical presentation is indistinguishable from acute coronary syndrome, with chest pain, dyspnoea and ST-segment elevation (Chapter 42), but there is no coronary artery obstruction, and in ~95% of cases there is full recovery after a month. TCM has been diagnosed in ~2% of admissions for acute coronary syndrome; ~90% of cases involve postmenopausal women aged between 58 and 75. TCM may be caused by "stunning" of cardiac muscle by stress-induced catecholamines. Oestrogen may protect premenopausal women.

## **Channelopathies**

Channelopathies are inherited diseases caused by mutations in genes for ion channels and predispose to arrhythmias, syncope and sudden cardiac death, most commonly in young, otherwise healthy adults with structurally normal hearts.

**Long QT syndrome** (LQTS) is characterized by a prolonged QT interval ( $QT_C > 0.44$  s; see Chapter 14). This is normally of no consequence and patients are otherwise healthy, but rarely acute emotion or exertion triggers the polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmia **torsade de pointes** (Chapter 51), causing syncope

(most common), seizures or sudden cardiac death. The trigger is increased sympathetic activity (see also CPVT below). LQTS is autosomal dominant inherited, with a prevalence of  $\sim$ 1 in 6000; ~4% suffer sudden cardiac death, largely children and young adults, but 30% remain asymptomatic lifelong. About 75% of cases involve three genes (Figure 57.2): loss-of-function mutations in KCNQ1 (~30%) or KCNH2 (hERG) (~40%), which encode **delayed rectifier K**<sup>+</sup> **channels**, reduce I<sub>v</sub> and so prolong repolarization (Chapter 12), whilst gain-of-function mutations in SCN5A (~5%; encodes the Na+ channel) slow channel inactivation so  $I_{N_0}$  is sustained, prolonging the action potential. Treatment with  $\beta$ -blockers to suppress sympathetic stimulation is effective, but an ICD may be required. Functional LQTS can be acquired in heart failure (Chapter 46). **Drug-induced** LQTS is common, not only with class IA and III antiarrhythmics (as expected; Chapter 52), but also antimalarial, antihistamine, antibiotic, psychiatric and recreational drugs (e.g. cocaine) because the hERG protein is promiscuous in its interactions. Such drugs dangerously increase risk for genetic LQTS.

**Short QT syndrome** (SQTS) has only recently been described. In contrast to LQTS repolarisation is abnormally shortened, predisposing to atrial and ventricular fibrillation. It has a high lethality; in ~30% sudden cardiac arrest was the first presentation, most often in young adults. Others experience syncope and palpitations. Most cases exhibit **gain-of-function** mutations in *KCNH2* (the opposite of LQTS), others have **loss-of-function** mutations in *CACNA1C* or related genes encoding the L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (Figure 57.2). Inheritance is autosomal dominant, and there is high penetrance in affected families. ICD is the mainstream and often prophylactic therapy, though quinidine may be effective.

Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) has similar symptoms to LQTS and is also triggered by acute emotion, exercise and increased sympathetic activity; however, the resting ECG is normal. Symptoms generally become apparent in the first decade of life, and 60% will have had symptoms by the age of 20. Prevalence is 1 in 10 000. Most cases (50–70%) are associated with mutations in *RYR2*, which encodes the **SR Ca**<sup>2+</sup> release channel and has autosomal dominant inheritance. A minority (~8%) have mutations in *CASQ2*, which encodes calsequestrin and is recessive (Chapter 12). Treatment is the same as for LQT syndrome.

**Brugada syndrome** is characterized by a Brugada pattern ECG (ST elevation in leads  $V_1$ – $V_3$ ; Chapters, 51); there is an increased risk of sudden cardiac death due to **ventricular fibrillation**, often during rest or sleep. Inheritance is autosomal dominant, though it is ~9-fold more common in males. Prevalence may be 1 in 2000, particularly in Southeast Asia where it is the leading cause of sudden death in young men. About 20% of cases are associated with **loss-of-function** mutations in SCN5A encoding  $\mathbf{Na^+}$  **channels**, which may favour re-entry arrhythmias due to electrical differences between subepicardial and subendocardial cells (Chapter 51), though numerous other genes have also been implicated. The only known effective treatment is an ICD.
