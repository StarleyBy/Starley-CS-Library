ongenital heart diseases (CHDs) are abnormalities of cardiac structure that are present at birth, caused by abnormal development between 3 and 8 weeks' gestation. The incidence of CHD is ~1% of live births, excluding common valve disorders such as bicuspid aortic valve and mitral valve prolapse (Chapters, Figure 56.7). Many spontaneously aborted or stillborn fetuses have cardiac malformations, which are also common in Down's syndrome and other genetic disorders of development. Maternal circumstances during gestation significantly increase the risk of CHD. These include later maternal age, diabetes (but not

gestational), **rubella** infection, **alcohol abuse** and medications such as acne treatments containing **isotretinoin**, or **ibuprofen** taken in the first trimester.

CHDs often present in infancy with **congestive heart failure** or **central cyanosis**, although some only become a problem later. Heart failure in an infant is usually caused by a **left to right shunt**, such as **ventricular septal defect** (VSD) or **patent ductus arteriosus** (PDA), or as a result of aortic obstruction. **Central cyanosis** may be caused by severe pulmonary disease or **right to left shunt**. It is characteristic of **transposition of the great vessels** and **tetralogy of Fallot**.

**Ventricular septal defects** (**VSD**) are the most common CHDs and may occur with other abnormalities. In utero, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) exceeds systemic vascular resistance (SVR), so most blood exits the left ventricle via the aorta. However, after birth PVR < SVR, and blood is shunted from the left to right ventricle via the VSD, and into the pulmonary artery (Figure 56.2). The magnitude of shunt is related to the size of defect and relative size of PVR and SVR. In young children, moderate VSD may limit exercise or cause fatigue, an enlarged heart and hypertrophy. Shunting of blood into the pulmonary circulation leads to pulmonary hypertension, and if persistent irreversible **pulmonary vascular remodelling**. PVR may then exceed SVR, reversing the shunt and causing cyanosis (Figure 56.3; **Eisenmenger's syndrome**). Surgical correction is then not possible, so infants with significant VSD benefit from early surgery. Half of smaller VSDs close spontaneously within ∼4 years.

**Atrial septal defects** (**ASD**) generally involve the midseptum in the ostium secundum and are distinct from a **patent foramen ovale** (PFO;), which are generally smaller and of little consequence, though very common (Chapter 25). They are often initially asymptomatic and if small may close spontaneously, though patients with small to moderate ASDs may develop symptoms when adult. With larger ASDs the left to right shunt may eventually lead to pulmonary hypertension, Eisenmenger's syndrome (see above) or left ventricular failure. There is also a risk of atrial arrhythmias, and as the child gets older stroke due to passage of thrombi. Due to the risk of complications in later life ASDs are normally repaired in childhood even if asymptomatic. Repair is rarely performed after 25 years of age, especially if there is pulmonary hypertension.

**Patent ductus arteriosus** (see Chapter 25) arises when the ductus does not close properly, often due to malformations and possibly related to maternal rubella. It is more common in females. The duct may not close in premature babies due to immaturity. Frequently PDA is not diagnosed at birth but only after development of heart failure or infective endocarditis. Treatment is initiated as soon as possible to prevent development of full heart failure. Ligation of the ductus arteriosus must be performed within 5 years of birth. A cyclooxygenase inhibitor (e.g. indomethacin) to reduce PGE1 is sometimes sufficient to promote closure.

**Fallot's tetralogy** is the most common **cyanotic CHD** in children surviving to 1 year (Figure 56.4). It consists of a VSD, pulmonary stenosis, an overriding aorta (positioning of aorta over VSD) and right ventricular hypertrophy. There is a high right ventricular pressure and right to left shunt. The degree of cyanosis depends on the degree of pulmonary stenosis. Infants with Fallot's tetralogy develop slowly and may present with dyspnoea, fatigue and hypoxic episodes (**Fallot's, tetralogy** or **"Tet" spells**), characterized by rapidly worsening cyanosis, progressing to limpness, stroke and loss of consciousness. There is a 50% mortality rate by 6 years if untreated. Surgical correction of the VSD and pulmonary obstruction is performed preferably around 12 months and has <5% mortality.

Complete **transposition of the great arteries** (**d‐TGA**; *dextropositioning of RV*) is the second most common **cyanotic** CHD, where the left ventricle empties into the pulmonary artery and the right ventricle into the aorta (Figure 56.5). This results in two separate circulations, one through the body and one through the lungs, so tissues have no access to oxygenated blood. Life can be supported only if there is mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, via either a VSD (present in 50%), PDA and/or ASD. Without an VSD severe cyanosis occurs rapidly after closure of the ductus arteriosus. This can be delayed by administrating PGE1 or creation of an ASD (balloon septostomy). Surgical correction involves reconnection of the great arteries to their appropriate ventricles in first week of life. Without correction, d‐TGA is fatal within 2 weeks for ∼30% and a year for 90%, depending on extent of VSD/ASD. **L‐TGA** (or *congenitally corrected* TGA) is rare. Here the right and left ventricles rather than great arteries are transposed, so blood follows a normal route through the lungs. However, as the right ventricle now serves the systemic circulation, it may hypertrophy and eventually fail.

**Atrioventricular septal defects** (**AVSD**) occur due to failure of the embryonic endocardial cushions to develop into the lower part of atrial septum and upper part of the ventricular septum, and to separate the mitral and tricuspid valves. It is common in Down's syndrome. In **complete AVSD** there is effectively a large hole in the centre of the heart where the atrial and ventricular septa would normally meet, and the upper and lower chambers are separated by a single common inflow valve. In **partial AVSD** the ventricular septum (but not atrial) is complete and there are distinct tricuspid and mitral valves, though the latter is generally defective and leaks. There are also transitional forms. AVSDs generally lead to congestive heart failure and pulmonary hypertension if untreated. Surgical correction is performed at 3–6 months (complete AVSD) or 6–18 months (partial) depending on severity. Medical treatment prior to surgery is as for heart failure (Chapter 47).

**Hypoplastic left heart syndrome** (**HLHS**) is one of the most challenging CHDs, characterized by a poorly developed left ventricle, small or blocked mitral and aortic valves, and small aorta (Figure 56.6). It is more common in males. As the ductus arteriosus starts to close after birth, symptoms including tissue hypoxia develop rapidly, and without treatment survival is a few days at most. HLHS is not correctable, but life can be extended by surgery to divert right ventricular output to the systemic circulation whilst maintaining pulmonary blood flow (a complex procedure), or in some cases heart transplant. The neonatal death rate is nevertheless close to 25%, and barely 70% survive to their teens. **Hypoplastic right heart syndrome** is similar but less common and involves the right ventricle, tricuspid and pulmonary valves.
