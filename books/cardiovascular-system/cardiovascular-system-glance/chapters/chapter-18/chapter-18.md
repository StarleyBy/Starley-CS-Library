## Relationships between pressure, resistance and flow

**Haemodynamics** is the study of the relationships between **pressure**, **resistance** and the **flow of blood** in the cardiovascular system. Although the properties of this flow are enormously complex, they can largely be derived from simpler physical laws governing the flow of liquids through single tubes (Figure 18.1).

When a fluid is pumped through a closed system, its flow (Q) is determined by the pressure head developed by the pump  $(P_1 - P_2)$  or  $\Delta P$ , and by the resistance (R) to that flow, according to **Darcy's law** (analogous to Ohm's law):

$$Q = \Delta P/R$$

or for the systemic circulation as a whole:

$$CO = (MABP - CVP)/TPR$$
,

where CO is cardiac output, MABP is mean arterial blood pressure, TPR is total peripheral resistance (also referred to as the systemic vascular resistance, SVR) and CVP is central venous pressure. Because CVP is ordinarily close to zero, this equation is typically simplified to  $MABP \approx CO \times TPR$ .

MABP is the arterial blood pressure averaged over the cardiac cycle, and since diastole lasts roughly twice as long as systole, it can be approximated as  $MABP \approx (DBP + (SBP - DBP)/3)$  where SBP and DBP refer to the systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressures, respectively.

TPR cannot be measured and is calculated as:

$$TPR = (MABP - CVP)/CO \text{ or } TPR \approx MABP/CO$$

*TPR* can be expressed in peripheral resistance units (PRU, also termed Wood units) as pressure in mmHg divided by cardiac output in mL/min (i.e. mmHg × min × L<sup>-1</sup>). However, pressure and flow can also be expressed as dynes/cm² and cm³/sec, respectively, such that resistance in cgs units is dynes × sec × cm $^{-5}$ . Taking into account that 1 mmHg = 1330 dynes/cm², the value of *TPR* in cgs units can be calculated from that in PRU by multiplying by 80. Thus, for example, if *MABP* is 95 mm/Hg and *CO* is 5200 mL/min, the *TPR* in PRU is ~18 and in cgp units is ~1460.

Resistance to flow is caused by frictional forces within a fluid and depends on the viscosity of the fluid and the dimensions of the tube, as described by **Poiseuille's law**:

resistance =  $8VL/\pi r^4$

so that:

flow = 
$$\Delta P \left( \pi r^4 / 8VL \right)$$
.

Here, V is the viscosity of the fluid, L is the tube length and r is the inner radius (= ½ the diameter) of the tube. Because flow depends on the fourth power of the tube radius in this equation, *small changes in radius have a powerful effect on flow*. For example, a 20% decrease in radius reduces flow by about 60%.

Considering the cardiovascular system as a whole, the different types or sizes of blood vessels (e.g. arteries, arterioles, capillaries) are arranged sequentially, or in *series*. In this case, the resistance of the entire system is equal to the *sum of all the resistances* offered by each type of vessel:

$$R_{\rm total} = R_{\rm arteries} + R_{\rm arterioles} + R_{\rm capillaries} + R_{\rm venules} + R_{\rm veins}.$$

Calculations taking into account the estimated lengths, radii and numbers of the various sizes of blood vessels show that the arterioles, and to a lesser extent the capillaries and venules, are primarily responsible for the resistance of the cardiovascular system to the flow of blood. In other words,  $R_{\rm arteriole}$  makes the largest contribution to  $R_{\rm total}$ . Because according to Darcy's law the pressure drop in any section of the system is proportional to the resistance of that section, the steepest fall in pressure is in the arterioles (Figure 18.2).

Although the various sizes of blood vessel are arranged in series, each organ or region of the body is supplied by its own major arteries which emerge from the aorta. The vascular beds for the various organs are therefore arranged in *parallel* with each other. Similarly, the vascular beds within each organ are mainly arranged into parallel subdivisions (e.g. the arteriolar resistances  $R_{\text{arteriole}}$  are in parallel with each other). For 'n' vascular beds arranged in parallel:

$$1/R_{\text{total}} = 1/R_1 + 1/R_2 + 1/R_3 + 1/R_4 \dots 1/R_n$$
.

An important consequence of this relationship is that the blood flow to a particular organ can be altered (by adjustments of the resistances of the arterioles in that organ) without greatly affecting pressures and flows in the rest of the system. This can be accomplished, as a consequence of Poiseuille's law, by relatively small dilatations or constrictions of the arterioles within an organ or vascular bed.

Because there are so many small blood vessels (e.g. millions of arterioles, billions of venules, trillions of capillaries), the overall cross-sectional area of the vasculature reaches its peak in the microcirculation. As the velocity of the blood at any level in the system is equal to the total flow (the cardiac output) divided by the cross-sectional area at that level, the blood flow is slowest in the capillaries (Figure 18.2), favouring  $O_2$ – $CO_2$  exchange and tissue absorption of nutrients. The capillary transit time at rest is 0.5–2 s.

#### **Blood viscosity**

Very viscous fluids like motor oil flow more slowly than less viscous fluids like water. **Viscosity** is caused by frictional forces within a fluid that resist flow. Although the viscosity of plasma is similar to that of water, the viscosity of blood is normally three to four times that of water, because of the presence of blood cells, mainly erythrocytes. In **anaemia**, where the cell concentration (haematocrit) is low, viscosity and therefore vascular resistance decrease and CO rises. Conversely, in the high-haematocrit condition **polycythaemia**, vascular resistance and blood pressure are increased.

#### **Laminar flow**

As liquid flows steadily through a long tube, frictional forces are exerted by the tube wall. These, in addition to viscous forces within the liquid, set up a velocity gradient across the tube (Figure 18.1) in which the fluid adjacent to the wall is motionless, and the flow velocity is greatest at the centre of the tube. This is termed laminar flow and occurs in the microcirculation, except in the smallest capillaries. One consequence of laminar flow is that erythrocytes tend to move away from the vessel wall and align themselves edgewise in the flow stream. This reduces the effective viscosity of the blood in the microcirculation (the Fåhraeus–Lindqvist effect), helping to minimize resistance.

### **Wall tension**

In addition to the pressure gradient along the length of blood vessels, there exists a pressure difference across the wall of a blood vessel. This transmural pressure is equal to the pressure inside the vessel minus the interstitial pressure. The transmural pressure exerts a circumferential tension on the wall of the blood vessel that tends to distend it, much as high pressure within a balloon stretches it. According to the **Laplace/Frank law**:

wall tension = 
$$P_t(r/\mu)$$
,

where  $P_{\rm t}$  is the transmural pressure, r is the vessel radius and  $\mu$  is the wall thickness. In the aorta, where  $P_{\rm t}$  and r are high, atherosclerosis may cause thinning of the arterial wall and the development of a bulge or **aneurysm** (see Chapter 37). This increases r and decreases  $\mu$ , setting up a vicious cycle of increasing wall tension which, if not treated, may result in vessel rupture.
