eart failure is a complex syndrome in which the heart is incapable of generating sufficient cardiac output (CO) to meet the demands of the body. Initially, compensatory mechanisms may allow adequate CO to be maintained at rest but not during exercise (exercise intolerance). Eventually CO cannot be maintained at rest (decompensation); this can be precipitated by infection (e.g. influenza), stress, arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome, or drugs causing water or salt retention (e.g. NSAIDs) or that are cardiotoxic (e.g. alcohol). Heart failure is predominantly a disease of older people. It occurs in ~2% of patients under 50 years, but in 10–20% over 70; 5-year survival is poor (<50%). There are many underlying causes (Figure 46.1).

# **Types of heart failure**

Heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (systolic failure): Most common (~70% cases), due to impaired left ventricular function with an **ejection fraction** <45% (Figure 46.2); most often a consequence of ischaemic heart disease (IHD).

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) (diastolic failure): Heart failure presents with a normal or mildly reduced ejection fraction, due to **impaired ventricular relaxation** and **ventricular filling**; caused by increased ventricular stiffness due to fibrosis, hypertrophy, or cardiac restriction (e.g. pericarditis). Most common in hypertension, obesity and diabetes.

Left heart failure refers to a clinical picture dominated by pulmonary congestion and thus dyspnoea (breathlessness), whereas in right heart failure the dominant features are a raised central venous pressure (CVP) and peripheral oedema. Right heart failure may result from chronic lung disease (cor pulmonale), pulmonary hypertension (Chapter 58) or pulmonary embolism. It most commonly occurs secondary to left heart failure; in biventricular (or congestive) heart failure the clinical picture includes signs and symptoms of both left and right heart failure.

High output failure occurs when a healthy heart is unable to meet grossly elevated demands for output due to anaemia or a drastically reduced peripheral resistance (e.g. septic shock).

*Acute heart failure* describes a sudden loss of cardiac function, for example **acute coronary syndrome** (Chapter 44), resulting in sudden onset pulmonary congestion and cardiogenic shock (Chapter 31).

# **Pathophysiology**

The pathophysiology of chronic heart failure is largely a consequence of mechanisms that compensate for reduced cardiac function. Impaired cardiac function causes accumulation of venous blood and thus raised filling pressures, so CO increases as a consequence of **Starling's law** (Figures 46.2, 46.3; Chapter 17). **Neurohumoral** mechanisms are activated by the baroreceptor reflex (Figure 46.4; Chapter 28), and the autonomic nervous system and circulating catecholamines stimulate increases in heart rate and contractility, arterial vasoconstriction (raises total peripheral resistance [TPR]) and venoconstriction (raises CVP) (Chapters 12 and 17). Sympathetic stimulation of renal granular cells and reduced renal perfusion cause release of renin, and consequently angiotensin 2 and aldosterone; vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone, ADH) also increases. These cause renal sodium and water retention and so elevate blood volume and CVP (and thus CO through Starling's law) (Chapter 29). Angiotensin 2 and vasopressin also increase TPR. In mild disease these mechanisms can maintain CO and blood pressure without overt symptoms. However, end-diastolic pressure (EDP) and volume (EDV) are always elevated (Figure 46.2, A) so **ejection fraction** is reduced, an early sign of heart failure.

As cardiac function declines, CO can be maintained only by an ever-increasing CVP and heart rate (Figure 46.2, B), fostering

further **myocardial damage** (see below). This vicious circle drives a relentless decay towards decompensation and death. Although adequate CO may be maintained at rest even in quite severe failure, this is at the expense of greatly increased venous pressures as the function curve flattens and Starling's law becomes less effective (Figure 46.2, A,B; Chapter 17). High venous pressures underlie most signs and symptoms of heart failure.

## **Consequences of compensation** (Figure 46.3)

Initially, symptoms only appear during exertion, which exacerbates the rise in venous pressures (Figure 46.2, C); this limits the ability to exercise (**exercise intolerance**). Any increase in contractility and heart rate during exercise is small because they are already strongly stimulated at rest, and in late disease  $\beta$ -adrenoceptor density and sensitivity are reduced. **Dyspnoea** on exertion is often the first symptom of left heart failure. It is caused by **pulmonary congestion** due to the raised pulmonary venous pressure, making the lungs stiffer and so promoting the sensation of breathlessness. Redistribution of blood to the lungs on lying down or during sleep can instigate dyspnoea (**orthopnoea**; **paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea**), and in severe failure and decompensation **pulmonary oedema**, when fluid enters the alveoli. This is a life-threatening condition causing extreme dyspnoea and hypoxaemia.

A high CVP similarly causes **peripheral oedema** (Chapter 21), **hepatomegaly** and **ascites**, common features of **right** and **congestive heart failure**. High EDP eventually leads to **cardiac dilation** and a greatly enlarged heart (see below) and is associated with an  $\mathbf{S}_3/\mathbf{S}_4$  **gallop rhythm** (Chapter 16). In more severe disease diversion of blood flow from skeletal muscle and non-essential tissues leads to **weakness** and **fatigue** and contributes to exercise intolerance.

# **Myocardial dysfunction and remodelling**

Chronic heart failure is characterized by progressive cardiac dysfunction, accompanied by **myocardial remodelling**. Compensation forces an already compromised heart to work harder. This leads to **energy deficit**, dysfunction of ATP-dependent transporters (e.g. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPases and Na<sup>+</sup> pump) (Chapters 10 and 12), and consequent **Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload** (Figure 46.4). This impairs relaxation and fosters lengthening of the action potential (e.g. *acquired long QT syndrome*; Chapter 57) and generation of **arrhythmias**, a major cause of sudden death. Mitochondrial dysfunction worsens the energy deficit. **Oxidative stress** and cytokines promote further damage, structural alterations and **apoptosis** (programmed cell death). Myocardial remodelling is potentiated by direct action of noradrenaline, angiotensin 2 and aldosterone (Figure 46.4).

**Dilatation** reduces cardiac *efficiency*, as pressure in a sphere is proportional to wall tension (i.e. myocardial force) divided by radius (Law of Laplace). Large dilated hearts therefore have to contract harder in order to develop the same pressure as smaller hearts.

Cardiac dilatation must not be confused with hypertrophy, where cardiac myocytes grow larger and ventricular wall thickness increases in response to a sustained increase in afterload (e.g. hypertension, aortic stenosis). Hypertrophy is not usually associated with IHD. Although force is increased, the thicker ventricle is less compliant, which impedes filling and contributes to diastolic failure. Capillary density is reduced, lowering coronary reserve (difference between maximum and resting coronary flow), so myocardial perfusion may be limited. Changes in contractile protein isoforms (myosin, tropomyosin) decrease contraction velocity and contractility. Gross hypertrophy may physically impair valve operation.
