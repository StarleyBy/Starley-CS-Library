Lead II of the 12 lead ECG showing premature ventricular complexes (PVCs). PVCs are wide QRS complexes not preceded by a P wave which arise from the right or left ventricle rather than the sinoatrial node (black arrows). They can occasionally cause symptoms such as a skipped beat or palpitations. The first three PVCs occur in a bigeminal paern (every other beat is a PVC) and the fourth PVC occurs in a trigeminal paern (every third beat is a PVC). The QRS complexes triggered normally by P waves are indicated by red arrows.

Lead II of the 12 lead ECG showing monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. Monomorphic refers to there being only one type of QRS morphology, originating from a single focus in the ventricle, such as a scar. In this rhythm strip, the QRS complexes are wide (>120 ms) and the rate is close to 300 beats per minute.

12 lead ECG showing polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Polymorphic means there are multiple QRS morphologies. Polymorphic VT is either associated with a prolonged QT interval in which case it is called Torsades de Pointes, or with a normal QT interval, which is likely due to ischaemia. In Torsades de Pointes, there are rapid irregular QRS complexes which appear to twist around the isoelectric line. It can rapidly degenerate into ventricular fibrillation.

Lead II of the 12 lead ECG showing sinus bradycardia degenerating into VF. VF is very rarely captured on the 12 lead ECG. It is usually seen on a defibrillator monitor in the context of cardiac arrest and is characterised by irregular QRS complexes without any P waves. It is due to disorganised electrical activity in the ventricles.

achyarrhythmias originating in the ventricles are most often associated with ischaemic heart disease. They are common during and up to 24 h after acute myocardial infarction (MI), when increases in sympathetic activity and extracellular [K+] as well as slowed conduction favour their initiation. Such arrhythmias may be immediately life threatening, and indeed the vast majority of deaths associated with MI are caused by ventricular fibrillation occurring before the individual reaches hospital. Subsequently, however, the border zone of the healed infarct scar may serve as a substrate for the development of dangerous re-entrant ventricular tachycardia (VT) which can recur or become incessant weeks to years after the MI. These late arrhythmias themselves confer an additional risk of death and must be treated with drugs and an **implantable cardioverter defibrillator** (ICD; see below). Ventricular tachyarrhythmias can also be associated with cardiomyopathy and valvular and congenital heart disease, and idiopathic varieties may occur in structurally normal hearts (e.g. focal VT).

## **Ventricular rhythm disturbances**

**Premature ventricular complexes** (PVCs) are caused by a ventricular ectopic focus and can occur randomly or following every (*bigeminy*) or every second (*trigeminy*) sinus beat (Figure 51.1). Because depolarisation is initiated within and conducts through the ventricle, it spreads more slowly than sinus beats which are distributed rapidly by the His–Purkinje conduction system. Thus the resultant QRS complex is broad and abnormally shaped. PVCs may be associated with a 'compensatory pause'. PVCs may be of no prognostic significance but can predispose to more serious arrhythmias if they develop during or after MI, and/or occur during the T wave of the preceding beat. Studies have shown that a daily PVC burden of >20% can induce cardiomyopathy. Such patients should be offered investigation of the underlying cause (e.g. ischaemia) and catheter ablation.

**Ventricular tachycardia** originates in the ventricles and is defined as four or more successive ventricular ectopic beats occurring at a rate of >100 beats/min. VT is described as *non-sustained* or *sustained* based on whether it lasts for >30 s. VT can cause symptoms such as syncope, angina and shortness of breath, and if sustained can compromise cardiac pumping, leading to heart failure and death. VT can also deteriorate into ventricular fibrillation (see below), particularly with a rate of >200 beats/min.

ECG criteria for VT include broad QRS complexes (>120 ms), atrioventricular dissociation (P waves and QRS complexes occur at different rates), extreme axis deviation (QRS positive in lead aVR and negative in leads I and aVF), and positive or negative concordance in leads V1-.V6 (i.e. these leads show entirely positive or negative complexes). Normal atrial activation may continue to be driven by the SAN, or the abnormal ventricular pacemaker may cause atrial tachycardia via retrograde impulses through the AVN. The configuration of the QRS complex can be used to classify VT into two broad categories. In monomorphic VT (Figure 51.2), the QRS complexes all have a similar morphology and the heart rate is generally constant, whereas in polymorphic VT both the QRS morphology and the rate vary continually. Monomorphic VT generally indicates the presence of a stable re-entrant pathway, the substrate for which is typically ischaemic scar (see Chapter 48). Polymorphic VT is thought to be caused by multiple ectopic foci or re-entry in which the circuit pathway is continually varying and most often occurs during or soon after an MI.

**Torsade de pointes** is a type of polymorphic VT in which episodes of tachycardia, which may give rise to fibrillation and sudden

death, are superimposed upon intervals of bradycardia, during which the QT interval (indicative of the ventricular action potential duration) is prolonged. During the tachycardia, the ECG has a distinctive appearance in which the amplitude of the QRS complexes alternately waxes and wanes (Figure 51.3). Torsade de pointes may be caused by drugs or conditions that delay ventricular repolarisation (e.g. class IA and III antiarrhythmics, hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia). It is also associated with **congenital long QT (LQT) syndrome**, which can be caused by mutations in *KvLQT1* or *hERG*, genes coding for cardiac K<sup>+</sup> channels mediating repolarisation, or *SCN5A*, the gene coding for the cardiac Na<sup>+</sup> channel. In congenital LQT syndrome, torsades de pointes is often triggered by sympathetic activity (e.g. caused by stress), which may give rise to early or delayed afterdepolarisations and may also involve functional re-entry mediated by spiral waves of depolarisation (see Chapter 48).

**Ventricular fibrillation (VF)** is a chaotic ventricular rhythm (Figure 51.4) incompatible with a cardiac output. The patient is therefore in cardiac arrest. VF may follow episodes of VT or acute ischaemia and frequently occurs during MI. It is the main cause of sudden cardiac death, which is responsible for  $\sim 10\%$  of all mortality. VF is generally associated with severe underlying heart disease, including ischaemic heart disease and cardiomyopathy.

VF occasionally occurs idiopathically, for example in people with LQT syndrome or **Brugada syndrome** (Figure 51.5). This latter condition is associated with ion channel mutations (e.g. in *SCN5A*) which shorten the action potential in epicardial but not endocardial cells of the right ventricle, a situation favouring re-entry.

**Focal VT** and **fascicular tachycardia** are forms of idiopathic VT; that is, they can occur in structurally normal hearts. Focal VT most commonly originates in the **right ventricular outflow tract** (RVOT tachycardia) and is associated with increases in sympathetic activity. This is thought to raise intracellular [cyclic AMP] and therefore [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], initiating delayed afterdepolarisations. Fascicular tachycardia may in some cases be caused by a re-entrant circuit involving the Purkinje system. Idiopathic VTs generally have a good prognosis and can usually be successfully treated with radiofrequency catheter ablation (see Chapter 49).

**Direct current cardioversion (DCCV)** allows rapid **cardioversion** (reversion to sinus rhythm) of any haemodynamically unstable arrhythmia in an emergency setting. An electrical shock synchronised with the peak of the R wave is delivered from a defibrillator to the heart via electrodes applied to the chest and back of the heavily sedated patient. If the shock is not synchronised, it is given as soon as the button on the defibrillator is pressed and so may occur during the T wave (ventricular repolarisation). If this is the case, there is a high chance that ventricular fibrillation will follow. DCCV is believed to prolong refractoriness in myocardial tissue, allowing for the termination of ventricular arrhythmias.

Implantable cardioverter defibrillators consist of a generator connected to electrodes placed transvenously in the heart and superior vena cava. A sensing circuit detects arrhythmias, which are classified as tachycardia or fibrillation on the basis of rate. The treatment algorithm is either as burst pacing, which can terminate VT with a high degree of success, or by the delivery of a shock at up to 40 J, which can cardiovert VT and VF. Shock delivery is between an electrode in the right ventricle and another in the superior vena cava or to the body of the generator. Refinements in detection allow the distinction of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, so that several tiers of progressively more aggressive therapy can be deployed. The AVID study reported that, in patients with malignant ventricular arrhythmia, this approach improved survival by 31% over 3 years compared with antiarrhythmic drug therapy (mainly amiodarone).
