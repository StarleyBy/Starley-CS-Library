ngina pectoris is pain or discomfort in the chest caused by myocardial ischaemia. Adjectives used to describe it include squeezing, crushing, tight, or heavy. The discomfort may radiate to the neck, jaw, arms or back. Epigastric discomfort may occur alone or in association with angina and may be mistaken for indigestion.

Angina is described as either typical or atypical. Typical angina meets all three of the following characteristics: (i) substernal chest discomfort of characteristic quality and duration; (ii) provoked by exertion or emotional stress; and (iii) relieved by rest and/or nitrates within minutes. Atypical angina meets two of these characteristics and non-cardiac chest pain meets only one if any of them.

Angina is caused by myocardial ischaemia due to an imbalance between myocardial  $O_2$  supply and demand (Figure 40.1).  $O_2$  demand is determined by **heart rate**, **left ventricular contractility** and **systolic wall stress** and increases with **exercise**, **hypertension** and **left ventricular dilatation** (e.g. during chronic heart failure). Myocardial  $O_2$  supply is primarily determined by coronary blood flow and coronary vascular resistance, mainly occurring at the level of the intramyocardial arterioles. With exercise coronary blood flow can increase to four to six times baseline, which is the normal coronary flow reserve (see Chapter 26).

## **Stable angina** (Figure 40.2)

**Stable angina** is a consequence of stable coronary artery disease (CAD). In 2019, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) introduced the term chronic coronary syndromes to describe stable CAD. This change emphasises that the underlying pathophysiology of CAD is a dynamic process of atherosclerotic plaque accumulation that can have long, stable periods but can also become unstable at any time, due to plaque rupture causing an acute coronary syndrome (Chapters 42 and 45). Stable angina arises when the flow reserve of one or more coronary arteries is limited by a significant structural stenosis resulting from atherosclerosis. At rest, cardiac O, demand is low enough to be satisfied even by a diminished coronary flow. However, when exertion increases myocardial O, demand, flow reserve is limited because of the stenosis, which presents a fixed obstruction. The resulting imbalance between myocardial O2 demand and supply causes myocardial ischaemia manifesting as angina. Ischaemia develops mainly in the subendocardium, the inner part of the myocardial wall. This is because the blood flow to the left ventricular wall occurs mainly during diastole as a result of arteriolar compression during systole. The arterioles of the subendocardium are compressed more than those of the mid- or subepicardial layers; thus the subendocardium is most vulnerable to a relative lack of O<sub>2</sub>.

In addition to causing pain, ischaemia causes a decline in highenergy phosphates (creatine phosphate and ATP). As a result, both ventricular contractility and diastolic relaxation in the territory of affected arteries are impaired. This can cause a fall in cardiac output, pulmonary congestion and activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Stable angina is usually relieved within minutes by rest or by glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) spray.

Some patients with stable angina may have excellent effort tolerance one day but develop angina with minimal activity on another day. Contributing to this phenomenon of *variable threshold angina* is a dynamic endothelial dysfunction which often occurs in patients with coronary artery disease. The endothelium normally acts via nitric oxide to dilate coronary arteries during exercise. If this endothelium-dependent vasodilatation is periodically impaired, exercise may result in paradoxical vasoconstriction due to the unopposed vasoconstricting effect of the sympathetic nervous system on coronary  $\alpha$ -receptors.

Diagnosis of stable angina If coronary artery disease is suspected based on the symptom and risk factor profile, a 12 lead ECG and an echocardiogram are performed. Ischaemia or previous myocardial infarction can be indicated on the resting ECG by ST segment/T wave changes, left bundle branch block or pathological Q waves. If clinical assessment indicates typical or atypical angina, the patient is offered a CT coronary angiogram. For those in whom coronary artery disease is confirmed (e.g. previous MI, revascularisation), a non-invasive functional test is offered. Examples of functional testing include exercise ECG, dobutamine stress echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and myocardial perfusion nuclear imaging. If stress testing demonstrates ischaemia, then invasive coronary angiography is used to provide direct radiographic visualisation of the extent and severity of disease. A decision is then taken whether to intervene on any lesion (see Chapter 43).

**Prognosis** Uncomplicated stable CAD has a similar mortality rate to that of the general population but as noted in the 2019 ESC guidelines the disease can become unstable at any time. Studies show that cardiovascular mortality in patients with stable angina is 1.2–2.4% per year. Mortality increases with the number of diseased arteries. Patients with previous myocardial infarction, poor left ventricular function or diabetes are at an increased risk of mortality of up to 3.8% per year.

## **Microvascular angina** (Figure 40.3)

Patients with **microvascular angina** have ischaemic symptoms with objective evidence of ischaemia such as a positive stress test but no obstructive coronary disease at invasive angiography. This condition is more common in peri- and postmenopausal women and in those with features of the metabolic syndrome (hypertension, dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance). In a large study, 40% of women with chest pain and evidence of ischaemia undergoing invasive angiography were found to have nonobstructive coronary disease, compared to only 8% of men.

**Pathophysiology** Myocardial ischaemia is due to coronary microvascular dysfunction. This is caused by an impaired endothelial response to increased myocardial  $O_2$  demand, which is believed to be an imbalance between endothelium-derived vasodilators and vasoconstrictors, and may be an early marker of vascular disease. This results in lower coronary flow reserve, which is associated with increased risk for major adverse outcomes. Increased pain nociception has been proposed as a pathogenic mechanism underlying cases of microvascular angina refractory to standard therapy.

**Prognosis** The Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation study found that women with angina and either normal coronary arteries or non-obstructive coronary artery disease had significantly higher rates of adverse cardiovascular outcomes compared to asymptomatic ageand race-matched controls even after adjusting for cardiac risk factors.

## **Vasospastic angina** (Figure 40.4)

Vasospastic angina, previously termed variant or Prinzmetal angina, is an uncommon condition in which myocardial ischaemia and pain are caused by a severe transient occlusive spasm of one or more epicardial coronary arteries. Patients with vasospastic angina may or may not have coronary atherosclerosis, and in the former case, vasospasm often occurs in the vicinity of plaques. Vasospastic angina occurs at rest or on exertion and may be intensely painful. It is exacerbated by smoking and can be precipitated by alcohol or cocaine use. Cardiac ischaemia caused by vasospastic angina can result in ventricular arrhythmias, syncope, myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest during prolonged attacks. Vasospasm is thought to occur because a segment of artery becomes abnormally overreactive to vasoconstricting agents (e.g. noradrenaline, serotonin). There is also evidence that flow-mediated vasodilatation, a function of the endothelium, is impaired in the coronary arteries of patients with vasospastic angina and that this endothelial dysfunction may be due to oxidative stress (see Chapter 24).

**Diagnosis** The hallmark of vasospastic angina is nitrateresponsive angina associated with transient ST segment elevation on the ECG. It can be induced and directly visualised angiographically in the cardiac catheter laboratory by intracoronary administration of acetylcholine.

**Prognosis** The major adverse cardiac event rate (including death and myocardial infarction) from vasospastic angina is 1% or less. Whilst this event rate is low, it is concerning that adverse events tend to occur within the first three months, often before the diagnosis has been made. Consequently, vasospastic angina should be considered in patients presenting with an acute coronary syndrome in the absence of a culprit lesion, unexplained syncope, or in aborted sudden cardiac death.
