chocardiographic evaluation of the aorta and main pulmonary artery is a routine part of the standard echocardiographic examination. For descriptive purposes, the aorta is divided into segments, beginning at the aortic valve, including the: E

- Aortic annulus
- Sinuses of Valsalva
- Sinotubular junction
- Ascending aorta
- Aortic arch
- Descending thoracic aorta
- Proximal abdominal aorta

The term *aortic root* has a variable definition that can lead to errors in communication. In studies of genetic connective tissue disorders, aortic root usually refers to the aortic sinuses, from the valve level to the sinotubular junction. However, a surgical aortic root replacement typically extends from the aortic annulus to the mid-ascending aorta. Thus, when the aorta is abnormal, more specific terms describing anatomic location are preferred.

Evaluation of the aortic annulus and sinuses is a routine component of an echocardiographic study. In addition, further evaluation of the ascending aorta, arch, and descending aorta can be performed when disease is suspected clinically. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) images often are suboptimal because of overlying or adjacent air-filled structures, so transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) imaging greatly enhances the diagnostic utility of echocardiography for diseases of the aorta.

#### <span id="page-0-0"></span>BASIC PRINCIPLES

Aortic abnormalities include:

- Dilation
- Aneurysm
- Dissection
- Pseudoaneurysm
- Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm
- Atherosclerosis

The most common abnormality of the aorta is dilation, or an increase in diameter greater than expected for age and body size. When aortic dilation exceeds the expected diameter by 50% or more (>5.0 cm for the ascending aorta), the term *aneurysm* is used. Aneurysms can involve one or more segments of the aorta (ascending, arch, and descending) and may be tubular or saccular in configuration.

![](_page_1_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 16.1 Typical echo findings in Marfan syndrome.** The proximal aorta is markedly dilated with effacement of the sinotubular junction. Aortic annular dilation results in inadequate aortic leaflet apposition with a central jet of aortic regurgitation *(AR)* and consequent LV enlargement *(LVE).* Often, the anterior mitral leaflet *(AMVL)* is long and redundant. *Ao,* Aortic.

<span id="page-1-0"></span>*Aortic dilation* associated with hypertension or atherosclerosis is characterized by normal contours of the sinuses of Valsalva and narrowing at the sinotubular junction, with enlargement primarily in the ascending aorta. A bicuspid aortic valve often is accompanied by dilation of the aortic sinuses or ascending aorta, but some narrowing at the sinotubular junction usually is preserved. Inherited connective tissue disorders that cause aneurysms of the ascending aorta, such as Marfan syndrome and Loeys-Dietz syndrome, are characterized by effacement of the sinotubular junction and enlargement of the sinuses of Valsalva, in addition to dilation of the ascending aorta, thus resulting in a "water balloon" appearance of the proximal aorta [\(Fig. 16.1](#page-1-0)). Systemic inflammatory diseases, such as ankylosing spondylitis, are associated with aortic aneurysms and often also affect the valve tissue. Aneurysms also may be seen in tertiary syphilis (with a characteristic pattern of calcification), aortic arteritis (such as Takayasu arteritis and giant cell arteritis), and as a result of blunt or penetrating chest trauma. Large aortic aneurysms are prone to rupture, so prophylactic repair often is recommended.

An *aortic dissection* is a life-threatening situation in which an intimal tear in the aortic wall allows passage of blood into a "false" channel between the intima and the media ([Fig. 16.2\)](#page-1-1). This false channel may be localized or may propagate downstream, often in a spiral fashion, because of the pressure of blood flow in the channel. Complications related to the false lumen include:

- Expansion with compression of the true aortic lumen (which supplies major branch vessels)
- Propagation down major branch vessels

![](_page_1_Picture_9.jpeg)

**Fig. 16.2 Schematic diagram of an aortic dissection.** This example shows an entry site above the sinotubular junction into a false lumen. In real time, the intimal flap shows rapid undulating motion, independent of the cardiac cycle. As indicated by the *arrows* across the intimal flap in the descending aorta, multiple flow communications between the true and false lumens may be seen with color flow imaging. *Ao-valve,* Aortic valve.

- <span id="page-1-1"></span>■ Thrombosis
- Rupture

An accurate, rapid diagnosis of the presence or absence of aortic dissection and the site of the entry tear is crucial in the treatment of patients with chest pain and suspected dissection. The most prevalent risk factors for aortic dissection are hypertension and atherosclerosis. However, patient groups with the highest risk of aortic dissection include those with Marfan syndrome and other inherited connective tissue disorders, Turner syndrome, aortitis, and vascular-type Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Patients with a congenital bicuspid or unicuspid aortic valve also have a fivefold increased risk of aortic dissection. Dissection is more likely in patients with a preexisting aneurysm, although dissection can occur in the absence of dilation in patients with Marfan syndrome or other connective tissue disorders.

A *pseudoaneurysm* is a blood collection outside the aorta, in contrast to an aneurysm, that involves all the layers of the aortic wall. Pseudoaneurysms sometime occur due to a contained rupture after complex aortic valve or aortic surgery, as a complication of endocarditis, or following an aortic dissection.

*Sinus of Valsalva* aneurysms [\(Fig. 16.3](#page--1-25)) are congenital or due to infection, Marfan syndrome, or previous surgical procedures. A sinus of Valsalva aneurysm protrudes into adjacent chambers and sometimes is associated with a fistula. Specifically, an aneurysm of the right coronary sinus protrudes into the right ventricular (RV) outflow tract, the left coronary sinus into the left atrium (LA), and the noncoronary sinus into the right atrium (RA).

*Atherosclerosis* of the aorta may lead to dilation, aneurysm, or dissection. In addition, the presence of atheroma is important as a marker for coexisting coronary artery disease and as a potential source of embolic cerebrovascular events.

**Fig. 16.3 Schematic diagram of a congenital sinus of Valsalva aneurysm.** A long, "wind sock"-like membranous outpouching of the right coronary cusp *(RCC)* protrudes into the RV outflow tract. If fenestrations are present in the aneurysm, an aortic-to-RV fistula is seen. Note that an aneurysm of the left coronary cusp *(LCC)* would protrude into the LA, whereas an aneurysm of the right coronary cusp would protrude into the RA. *NCC,* Noncoronary cusp; *PA,* pulmonary artery.

# ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC APPROACH

# Transthoracic Approach *Echocardiographic Imaging*

On transthoracic imaging, the *proximal ascending aorta* is well seen in parasternal long- and short-axis views [\(Fig. 16.4\)](#page--1-26). Depending on ultrasound penetration, images of additional segments of the ascending aorta are obtained by moving the transducer cephalad one or more interspaces. Image quality is enhanced by positioning the patient in a steep left lateral decubitus position, thereby bringing the aorta in contact with the anterior chest wall ([Figs. 16.5](#page--1-27) and [16.6](#page--1-28)). In all adults, aortic diameter measurements should be made:

- In a two-dimensional (2D) long-axis plane through the center of the aortic sinuses and ascending aorta
- At end-diastole (onset of the QRS signal)
- From the white-black to black-white interface defining the aortic lumen
- At the aortic sinuses (maximum diameter) and mid-ascending aorta

When aortic dimensions are greater than normal or when the shape of the aortic sinuses and sinotubular junction is abnormal, additional measurements should be made as described later ([Table 16.1;](#page--1-29) see also Tables A.8, A.9, and A.10 in Appendix A). Aortic sinus diameter also can be measured with an M-mode tracing at the level of the valve leaflets when a perpendicular orientation between the ultrasound beam and the aortic sinuses can be obtained. With M-mode

**Fig. 16.4 Evaluation of the aorta from a transcutaneous approach.** From a parasternal long-axis *(PLAX)* window, the sinuses and a segment of the ascending aorta are seen; from the suprasternal notch *(SSN)* window, the arch and proximal descending thoracic aorta are seen; from a posteriorly angulated apical two-chamber *(A2C)* approach, the mid-segment of the descending thoracic aorta is seen; and from a subcostal *(SC)* approach, the distal thoracic aorta and proximal abdominal aorta are seen. In some individuals, the segment of ascending aorta between the standard PLAX and SSN views can be imaged from a high parasternal position. However, in other patients, this segment of the aorta is "missed" on TTE imaging.

tracings a leading edge-to-leading edge measurement convention is used. M-mode tracings may allow for more accurate identification of the aortic wall because of the high temporal sampling rate.

The *aortic arch* is imaged from a suprasternal notch or supraclavicular approach with the patient in a supine position with the neck extended. Both longitudinal [\(Fig. 16.7](#page--1-30)) and transverse views of the arch are obtainable in nearly all individuals. Usually, only a short segment of the ascending aorta is visible from the suprasternal notch window, but this is variable among patients. Also note that the descending aorta appears to taper because of an oblique image plane with respect to its curvature (i.e., the descending aorta is only partially in the image plane).

The *descending thoracic aorta* is seen in cross section posterior to the LA in the parasternal long-axis view. A longitudinal section of this segment of the descending aorta is obtained by clockwise rotation and lateral angulation of the transducer. From the suprasternal notch approach, a small portion of the descending thoracic aorta is seen. From the apical two-chamber view, a longitudinal section of a segment of the descending aorta is seen by lateral angulation and clockwise rotation of the transducer ([Fig. 16.8](#page--1-31)).

**Fig. 16.5 Marfan syndrome.** The parasternal long-axis view (A) shows dilated sinuses with effacement of the sinotubular junction. In a short-axis view (B), the trileaflet valve in systole is stretched so the orifice is triangular instead of the normal circular opening. *Ao,* Aorta; *DA,* descending aorta; *RVOT,* RV outflow tract.

**Fig. 16.6 Imaging the ascending aorta.** (A) The standard parasternal long-axis view in a patient with Marfan syndrome shows only the aortic sinuses. (B) With the transducer moved up one interspace, the loss of the normal contour of the sinotubular junction *(arrow)* and more of the ascending aorta are seen. *Ao,* Aorta; *LPA,* left pulmonary artery.

From the subcostal approach, the *distal thoracic* and *proximal abdominal aorta* is seen as it traverses the diaphragm. In patients with a left pleural effusion, images of the aorta also may be obtained by imaging through the fluid from the left posterior chest (paraspinal) with the patient in a right lateral decubitus position.

#### *Doppler Flows*

Color Doppler interrogation of the ascending aorta from the parasternal approach allows for evaluation of the flow pattern in the proximal aorta and assessment of aortic regurgitation severity, with evaluation of the cause of aortic regurgitation and measurement

**Fig. 16.7 Suprasternal notch view of the aorta.** The long-axis view (A) shows the ascending aorta *(Ao),* arch, and descending aorta with the right pulmonary artery *(PA)* in short axis and the LA imaged inferiorly. The short-axis suprasternal notch view (B) shows the aortic arch, pulmonary artery, and LA.

of vena contracta width. The ascending aorta also is imaged from the apical approach in an anteriorly angulated four-chamber view and in an apical long-axis view. Although 2D image quality often is suboptimal at the depth of the ascending aorta from the apical approach, this view does allow a parallel intercept angle between the Doppler beam and the direction of blood flow for spectral Doppler flow velocity measurements.

Pulsed or continuous-wave (CW) Doppler recordings of descending aortic flow from the suprasternal notch show systolic flow away from the transducer at a velocity of approximately 1 m/s. Normal flow in the descending aorta shows:

- Brief, low-velocity, early diastolic flow reversal
- Low-velocity antegrade flow in mid-diastole
- Low-velocity flow reversal at end-diastole

The use of low wall filter settings is needed to appreciate this normal flow pattern [\(Fig. 16.9\)](#page--1-34). Flow abnormalities are seen with aortic disease (e.g., coarctation), shunts (e.g., patent ductus arteriosus), or aortic valve disease (e.g., regurgitation). Flow patterns in the proximal abdominal aorta are similar to those in the descending thoracic aorta and are easily recorded from the subcostal approach [\(Fig. 16.10](#page--1-35)).

**Fig. 16.8 Descending thoracic aorta.** The posteriorly angulated apical two-chamber view shows the descending thoracic aorta *(Ao)* along its long axis in a patient with Marfan syndrome and prior aortic root replacement for type A dissection.

#### **Fig. 16.10 Normal flow pattern in the proximal abdominal aorta.** Subcostal view of the proximal abdominal aorta with color Doppler *(top)*. The pulsed Doppler signal *(bottom)* shows normal antegrade flow toward the transducer in systole, followed by brief early diastolic flow reversal and slight antegrade flow in mid-diastole.

#### *Limitations of Transthoracic Imaging of the Aorta*

The major limitations of the transthoracic approach to ultrasound evaluation of the aorta are acoustic access and image quality. In many individuals, acoustic access is suboptimal or minimal from one or more of the windows needed for full evaluation of the aorta, thus leaving "gaps" in the echocardiographic examination. Even when acoustic access is adequate, image quality often is poor because of beam width at the depth of the aorta, particularly the descending thoracic aorta from apical and parasternal windows. Beam-width

**Fig. 16.9 Normal flow pattern in the descending thoracic aorta.** Pulsed Doppler recording of flow in the descending aorta from a suprasternal notch long-axis view shows antegrade flow in systole with a maximum velocity of 1.1 m/s and a normal systolic ejection curve. In diastole, brief early diastolic flow reversal occurs, followed by low-velocity antegrade flow in mid-diastole and absence of flow (or low-velocity reversal) in end-diastole.

artifact, noise, and poor lateral resolution make differentiation of intraluminal defects from artifacts difficult. Because of these limitations, evaluation by TEE or other imaging modalities is appropriate in many patients with acute or chronic aortic disease.

# Transesophageal Approach

#### *Echocardiographic Imaging*

From a high TEE probe position with the image plane rotated to approximately 45°, the aortic valve and *sinuses of Valsalva* are seen in short axis. Slight withdrawal of the probe in the esophagus allows short-axis imaging of the proximal ascending aorta, but more distal segments are obscured by interposition of the air-filled trachea between the esophagus (and transducer) and the ascending aorta. The long-axis view of the aortic valve, sinuses of Valsalva, and ascending aorta is obtained by rotating the image plane to approximately 120° ([Fig. 16.11](#page--1-36)). In the long-axis plane, more cephalad segments of the ascending aorta are seen by slowly moving the transducer to a higher esophageal position.

The *aortic arch* is best imaged from a high esophageal position. Starting with a short-axis view of the descending thoracic aorta, the probe is withdrawn to the level of the arch, and then the entire probe is turned toward the patient's right and angulated inferiorly to obtain a long-axis view of the arch. In some patients, images of the aortic arch may be suboptimal because of the positions of the trachea and bronchi. In many cases, transthoracic suprasternal notch views of the arch provide superior image quality.

The *descending thoracic aorta* and the *proximal abdominal aorta* are well seen by the TEE approach. The descending thoracic aorta lies immediately lateral and slightly posterior to the esophagus, so posterior rotation of the probe provides excellent images in either a crosssectional (transverse plane at 0°) or long-axis (at 90° to 120°) view [\(Fig. 16.12](#page--1-37)). Slight turning of the TEE probe is needed at different levels as the aorta curves relative to the esophagus. From a transgastric position, the proximal abdominal aorta is seen posterior to the stomach. Many examiners prefer to examine the length of the aorta in sequential cross-sectional views as the probe is slowly withdrawn from the stomach and esophagus, with imaging of the aortic arch just before probe removal. This ensures that the entire endothelial surface of the aorta is visualized. Any areas of abnormality can then be further examined in long-axis views, or simultaneous biplane short- and long-axis views can be recorded.

Three-dimensional (3D) TEE imaging of the aorta is not routine but is helpful when aortic pathology is present, for example, when defining the anatomy and extent of an aortic dissection flap, identifying the location and size of the dissection entry site, or quantitating total aortic atherosclerotic burden.

# *Doppler Flows*

TEE color flow imaging of the aorta shows the normal antegrade flow pattern in the ascending aorta, arch, and descending aorta and is helpful in the evaluation of abnormal blood flow patterns when aortic dissection is present. However, quantitative evaluation of aortic

![](_page_6_Figure_12.jpeg)

**Fig. 16.11 TEE imaging of the ascending aorta.** The aortic long-axis view (A) is obtained at about 120° rotation and the short-axis view (B) at about 30° to 40° rotation. Both image planes are aligned to the cardiac landmarks, analogous to TTE views, with the exact degree of rotation varying between patients. *Ao,* Aorta.

**Fig. 16.12 Dissection flap with fenestration.** (A) On TEE imaging, a 2D short-axis view of the descending thoracic aorta shows a dissection flap separating the smaller true lumen *(TL),* with systolic flow in *red,* from the false lumens *(FL),* with spontaneous contrast due to lowvelocity flow. (B) In a long-axis view, a fenestration is seen with flow from the true lumen to the false lumen *(arrow)*.

![](_page_7_Figure_3.jpeg)

flow velocities is challenging from the TEE approach. The ascending aorta is seen in a medially rotated transgastric long-axis view, although the intercept angle may not be parallel to flow, a situation that results in velocity underestimation, particularly when high velocities are present. For the descending aorta, the direction of blood flow is nearly perpendicular to the direction of the ultrasound beam, thereby limiting spectral Doppler velocity measurement, although recording Doppler flow signals in a long-axis plane with the Doppler beam aligned at the distal end of the aorta is possible. This approach likely underestimates velocity because of the nonparallel intercept angle, but it is useful to evaluate flow patterns, such as holodiastolic flow reversal with aortic regurgitation.

In addition, color Doppler evaluation of the aortic valve is a standard component of the examination because aortic valve regurgitation results from several types of aortic disease, including:

- Bicuspid aortic valve disease with eccentric regurgitation
- Annular dilation with "stretching" of the valve leaflets that results in central noncoaptation
- Dilation of the sinuses or sinotubular junction that leads to inadequate leaflet overlap
- Commissural involvement by aortic dissection that results in inadequate support of the leaflets
- A flail aortic leaflet due to extension of a dissection flap into the valve tissue
- Diffuse aortic wall and valve leaflet thickening due to an inflammatory process

Evaluation of aortic regurgitation includes the measurement of vena contracta width, identification of the origin and etiology of regurgitation, and evaluation of left ventricle (LV) size and systolic function (see Chapter 12).

#### *Limitations of Transesophageal Imaging of the Aorta*

TEE imaging provides improved image quality and allows imaging of more segments of the aorta compared with transthoracic imaging. However, the distal ascending aorta and aortic arch are not completely visualized. In addition, TEE provides little information on the major aortic branch vessels, which are better evaluated by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

#### AORTIC DILATION AND ANEURYSM

Aortic dilation often is first recognized on the chest radiograph or on an echocardiographic examination requested for other reasons. In specific clinical settings, such as Marfan syndrome, aortic dilation is an expected consequence of a systemic disease ([Table 16.2](#page--1-38)). In these cases, echocardiography is requested to assess the presence and degree of the aortic abnormality, as well as involvement of the aortic valve. In patients with a bicuspid aortic valve, aortic dimension should be routinely measured ([Fig. 16.13](#page--1-39)).

In addition to aortic dilation, the *shape* of the sinuses and sinotubular junction is altered in some disease states. Effacement of the sinotubular junction is characteristic of connective tissue disorders, with loss of the normal abrupt change in curvature between the cup-shaped sinuses and cylindrical ascending aorta. Severe effacement is easy to recognize as a smooth contour from the sinuses to the ascending aorta with no discernible transition point. Early disease is subtler, with an increased distance from the aortic valve plane to the sinotubular junction and slight straightening of the transition zone.

Measurements of aortic diameter on echocardiography are accurate and reproducible when care is taken to obtain a true diameter in the center of the vessel (nonoblique), gain settings are appropriate, and standard measurement conventions are used. In

**Fig. 16.13 Bicuspid aortic valve associated aortopathy.** *(Left)* TTE imaging in a patient with a bicuspid aortic valve shows dilation of the ascending aorta with a maximum dimension of 5.26 cm at end-diastole. *(Center)* TEE images confirm dilation of the ascending aorta, although dimension is slightly underestimated because of a slightly oblique image plane. *(Right)* 3D reconstruction of the contrast computed tomographic images shows the location and severity of aortic dilation, but the timing of measurements during the cardiac cycle may not exactly match the echocardiographic data. *Ao,* Aorta.

patients with aortic dilation, it is important to measure aortic diameter at several locations and to specify the measurement site and timing in the cardiac cycle. The aorta is pulsatile, with the change in dimension from end-diastole to end-systole dependent on aortic compliance. Aortic compliance may be significantly altered in different disease states, but a typical normal change in aortic diameter during the cardiac cycle is 2 to 3 mm. End-systolic measurements often are used in children. However, in adults, measurements are most reliable at end-diastole because timing in the cardiac cycle (onset of the QRS) is reproducible and because end-diastolic measurements are least affected by aortic compliance or loading conditions.

Measurements ([Fig. 16.14\)](#page--1-40) are made at *end-diastole* at the:

- Aortic annulus (the site used for LV outflow tract diameter measurement)
- Aortic sinus leaflet tip level (the standard position of an M-mode recording of the aortic valve)
- Sinotubular junction
- Ascending aorta
- Aortic arch
- Descending thoracic aorta

Although all these measurements are not needed in every patient, quantitative evaluation of the extent and severity of aortic dilation is extremely useful in follow-up and treatment of patients with chronic, progressive aortic dilation. Each measurement is made from the black-white interface on a freeze-frame enddiastolic image, averaging several beats to ensure a consistent measurement. Aortic annulus diameter is measured at the insertion of the base of the valve leaflets in the long-axis view. The maximum aortic sinus

**Fig. 16.14 Aortic measurements.** LV outflow tract (LVOT) diameter is measured in systole *(A)* when used for transaortic stroke volume calculations or for the calculation of valve area in the continuity equation. Measurements of the aorta are made at end-diastole at the sinuses *(B),* the sinotubular junction *(C),* and in the mid-ascending aorta *(D).* The site of measurement should be specified in the echocardiographic report. 2D measurements are made from inner edge to inner edge of the white-black interface. M-mode measurements of the aorta usually correspond to the sinus diameter.

dimension typically is measured in a long-axis view, but short-axis views also may be useful when anatomy is asymmetric. Note that M-mode sinus dimensions are measured at the tips of the aortic valve leaflets by using a leading edge-to–leading edge convention. The sinotubular junction is measured at the point where the curved sinus contour meets the tubular ascending aorta. The ascending aorta is measured at

the maximum dimension with notation of the distance from the aortic valve. The aortic arch is measured in its mid-section, and the descending aorta is measured in the mid-thoracic region. The echo report includes the actual and expected measurements in millimeters; the ratio of the actual to the expected aortic diameter (where 1.0 is normal) may also be included (Fig. 16.15). In children, measurements are normalized for age and body size by using Z-scores, based on the standard deviation from mean normal values.

Sequential transthoracic studies of the degree of aortic dilation are used to monitor patients with Marfan syndrome or other causes of aortic aneurysm. Prophylactic ascending aorta and valve replacement may be recommended when the degree of ascending aortic dilation reaches a critical value, typically about 5.5 cm in the absence of a known genetic cause or with a bicuspid aortic valve, 5.0 cm for Marfan syndrome, 4.5 cm for Loeys-Dietz syndrome, and even lower in patients with rapid progression, a strong family history, small body size, or other contributing factors. Thus, careful measurements on sequential studies are needed to assess whether the dilation is progressive or stable over time and to determine the optimal timing of surgical intervention. Transthoracic imaging is appropriate for nonurgent serial evaluation in most patients, although additional evaluation with CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is also considered appropriate.

### AORTIC DISSECTION

When transthoracic echocardiography is requested to "rule out" aortic dissection, the differential diagnosis

is broad, with aortic dissection being one of many (and often the least likely) possible diagnoses. Thus, if the echocardiographic appearance of the aorta is normal, echocardiographic examination for other possible causes of chest pain is needed, including:

- Coronary artery disease (e.g., wall motion abnormalities)
- Valvular disease (e.g., aortic stenosis)
- Pulmonary embolus
- Pericarditis

When the clinical suspicion of aortic dissection is low to intermediate, a normal aorta on echocardiography further decreases the post-test likelihood of disease, so other diagnoses may be pursued. However, when the clinical suspicion is moderate to high, a "negative" transthoracic exam does *not* substantially decrease the post-test likelihood of disease, so TEE, MRI, or CT evaluation should be performed promptly.

In the patient with a possible acute aortic syndrome, the likelihood of dissection is highest in those with: (1) an underlying predisposing condition; (2) severe symptoms with an abrupt onset; (3) chest pain described as "tearing"; and (4) evidence of distal vessel compromise such as a pulse deficit, neurologic symptoms, or right-left arm blood pressure difference. Examples of patients at risk for aortic dissection include those with:

- Genetic conditions (Marfan syndrome, Turner syndrome)
- Bicuspid aortic valve disease
- Hypertension
- Atherosclerosis
- Deceleration traumatic injury

# Transthoracic Imaging

The transthoracic examination for aortic dissection includes evaluation of the:

- Ascending aorta from the standard and high parasternal windows
- Aortic arch from the suprasternal notch window
- Descending aorta from parasternal and apical windows
- Proximal abdominal aorta from a subcostal approach

The echocardiographic diagnosis of aortic dissection [\(Fig. 16.16](#page--1-42)) is most secure in the presence of:

- A dilated aortic lumen
- A linear, mobile echogenic structure with a pattern of motion different from that of the aortic wall
- Different color Doppler flow patterns in the true and false lumen

When a definite, undulating intimal flap is seen, the specificity of transthoracic echocardiography for the diagnosis of dissection is high (see Appendix B, Table B.21). However, beam-width artifact and reverberations can be mistaken for intraluminal structures by an inexperienced observer; this results in a specificity of less than 100%, particularly when the images are not "classic" or when image quality is suboptimal.

Conversely, the sensitivity of transthoracic echocardiography for aortic dissection is quite low (i.e., the inability to demonstrate an internal flap does not reliably exclude the diagnosis). This low sensitivity is due to poor image quality, particularly of the segment of ascending aorta between the sinotubular junction and the aortic arch, and the poor far-field resolution of the descending thoracic aorta from the transthoracic approach.

In a patient with suspected aortic dissection, indirect signs may be present even when a flap is not identified, including:

- Aortic dilation
- Aortic regurgitation
- Pericardial effusion
- A new regional wall motion abnormality

These abnormalities do not confirm a diagnosis of dissection because many other causes for these findings are possible. However, the presence or absence of these findings should weight the clinical evidence toward or away from a diagnosis of dissection and guide the choice of additional imaging studies.

# Transesophageal Imaging

TEE images of the aorta are far superior to transthoracic images in most patients because of (1) the shorter distance between the transducer and the aorta, (2) the use of a higher-frequency transducer, and (3) better ultrasound tissue penetration (higher signal-tonoise ratio). The descending thoracic aorta can be examined in its entirety from the diaphragm to the arch in both long- and short-axis planes.

(B) Color Doppler shows disturbed systolic flow in the true lumen and indicates that the dissection flap may extend into the right coronary artery *(RCA). Ao,* Aorta; *RVOT,* RV outflow tract.

Features of aortic dissection seen on TEE imaging include any combination of:

- A dissection flap that appears as a linear, bright, echogenic structure in the aortic lumen with erratic motion compared with normal systolic pulsations [\(Fig. 16.17](#page--1-43))
- Color Doppler evidence of blood flow in both the true (bounded by endothelium) lumen and the false (bounded by media) lumen
- The entry site into the false lumen
- Other communications between the two channels
- Thrombosis of the false lumen
- A hematoma in the wall of the aorta (instead of an initial flap)

The proximal segment of the ascending aorta is seen on TEE imaging in the short-axis plane at the aortic valve level. However, evaluation of the ascending aorta depends on use of a long-axis view. Evaluation of the ascending aorta is particularly important because the decision between emergency surgical intervention and medical therapy hinges on whether the dissection originates in (or involves) the ascending aorta. Note that even a localized dissection flap in the ascending aorta carries a grim prognosis and warrants surgical treatment. Color flow imaging further defines the entry site and demonstrates flow in true and false lumens. The true lumen is usually smaller than the false lumen and shows systolic expansion with systolic antegrade flow, whereas the false lumen is typically larger but shows systolic compression with reduced, absent, or retrograde flow in systole. Flow at entry sites or fenestrations usually goes from the true to the false lumen in systole.

The sensitivity of TEE for the diagnosis of aortic dissection is high (>97%). Although specificity also is high, it is less than 100% because of misinterpretation of ultrasound artifacts, such as reverberations, beamwidth artifacts, and oblique imaging planes. Careful evaluation from multiple views with adjustment of instrument settings helps avoid these false-positive diagnoses.

## *Complications of Aortic Dissection*

Complications of aortic dissection can be recognized on echocardiography and have important clinical implications both for diagnosis and therapy. Complications of aortic dissection ([Fig. 16.18\)](#page--1-44) include:

- Acute aortic regurgitation
- Coronary ostial occlusion
- Distal vessel obstruction
- Pericardial effusion
- Aortic rupture (pleural effusion, mediastinal hematoma)

Aortic regurgitation is nearly always present, with either chronic regurgitation due to aortic dilation or associated valve abnormalities or acute regurgitation due to further aortic dilation or to inadequate leaflet support, which results from retrograde extension of the dissection. In extreme cases, a flail aortic leaflet may be seen because of the dissection disrupting the normal attachment of the commissure to the aortic wall.

Coronary artery ostial occlusion can occur as a result of the dissection flap separating the coronary artery from normal blood flow or by compression of the vessel. The resultant wall motion abnormalities—inferior for

![](_page_14_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 16.18 Potential complications of dissection of the ascending aorta.** If the dissection proceeds retrograde (as well as antegrade) from the entry site, the false lumen can cause (1) occlusion in the coronary artery ostium with resultant myocardial infarction, (2) loss of support of an aortic leaflet with consequent severe aortic regurgitation *(AR),* or (3) rupture into the pericardium, which may result in tamponade physiology.

right coronary obstruction, anterolateral for left main obstruction—are easily recognized on echocardiography. The diagnostic difficulty in this situation is recognizing that the wall motion abnormalities are secondary events due to aortic dissection rather than the primary event (e.g., acute myocardial infarction due to coronary thrombosis).

Distal vessel obstructions rarely are recognized during the cardiac ultrasound examination. However, the possibility of aortic dissection should be considered in patients with distal vessel obstructions who are referred for echocardiography to "rule out" a cardiac source of embolus. The correct diagnosis of distal vessel obstruction due to a dissection flap (rather than an embolus) may be made by the astute echocardiographer.

Aortic dissections can rupture in one of several ways. *External* rupture into the mediastinum or pleural space often results in exsanguination with acute hemodynamic collapse. If the rupture *thromboses,* the patient exhibits a mediastinal hematoma, a pleural effusion (more often left than right), or both. Alternatively, if the dissection ruptures at the aortic annulus into the pericardial space, the patient is likely to present with pericardial tamponade and rapid hemodynamic collapse. However, a partial rupture or a leak from the aorta into the pericardium manifests with a smaller pericardial effusion. Obviously, the presence of any amount of pericardial fluid in a patient with an aortic dissection is an alarming sign and should prompt rapid intervention.

#### *Postoperative Evaluation After Surgery on the Ascending Aorta*

In addition to the diagnosis of dissection and the evaluation of complications, TEE also is used during

defining these features.

and after surgical repair to assess for residual dissection and aortic valve function [\(Table 16.3](#page--1-46)). A residual dissection flap, with flow in both true and false lumens, persists in most patients (possibly as many as 70% to 80%) following emergency surgery for acute dissection. The usual operative procedure is to close the entry site by replacing a segment of the involved aorta with a prosthetic graft. At the distal graft anastomosis, the flap may persist. Often this persistence is intentional because some branch vessels may be supplied by the false lumen and other vessels by the true lumen. Thus, the finding of a dissection flap in the aortic arch or descending aorta of a patient with a previous ascending aortic dissection and graft repair may represent stable residual disease or a second acute process. These conditions are differentiated by comparison with previous imaging studies (when available) and correlation with the operative report, clinical presentation, and other imaging modalities.

In patients with ascending aortic grafts, echocardiographic follow-up is warranted to assess for late complications. Review of the operative report is helpful in echocardiographic interpretation [\(Fig. 16.19](#page-15-0)). Procedures for the treatment of aortic aneurysm or dissection include:

- 1. Graft replacement of the ascending aorta: A tubular fabric graft is placed from above the sinotubular junction to the arch.
- 2. Aortic valve resuspension with replacement of the ascending aorta: The proximal anastomosis of the aortic graft is at the sinotubular junction with the aortic valve "resuspended" by

- attachment of the three aortic valve commissures to the proximal end of this graft. The native aortic sinuses and coronary arteries remain unchanged with this approach.
- 3. Valve conduit or Bentall type procedure: This is a combined replacement of the aorta and aortic valve with a composite valved conduit extending from the aortic annulus to the aortic arch with reimplantation of the native coronary artery ostia on the aortic graft. Either a mechanical or bioprosthetic valve is incorporated into the aortic graft.
- 4. Aortic valve reimplantation or David procedure: This is a conduit replacement of the aorta from the aortic annulus to the arch with the native valve preserved and sutured within the artificial conduit .The coronary arteries are reimplanted into the graft.
- 5. Additional replacement of part of the aortic arch may be done with any of these procedures. Replacement of the underside of the arch is called a hemiarch replacement.

In patients with a valved conduit, a baseline study is indicated postoperatively to allow comparison with future studies in terms of prosthetic valve function

(see Chapter 13). The prosthetic aortic graft itself appears as an echodense, cylindrical structure with a uniform diameter [\(Fig. 16.20](#page--1-47)). Although most surgeons now resect the native diseased aorta, in the past the native aorta often was "wrapped around" the prosthetic graft, thus resulting in irregular areas of thickening anterior and posterior to the graft on echocardiography. Even with resection of the native aortic segment, postoperative periaortic scar tissue may be prominent. The coronary arteries retain their normal insertions if a segment of the native aorta has been preserved. In these cases, careful examination for dilation of the remaining aortic tissue and the sinuses of Valsalva is needed. When the graft extends to the aortic valve level, the right and left coronary ostia are reimplanted into the graft along with a small "button" of native aortic tissue. Dilation or loss of structural integrity of this aortic tissue or dehiscence of the coronary reimplantation suture line results in myocardial infarction due to disruption of coronary blood flow. In addition, this complication can lead to aortic rupture or pseudoaneurysm formation.

lumen, which accounts for about 5% of patients with an acute aortic syndrome. Possible mechanisms of intramural hematoma include rupture of the vasa vasorum vessels into an area of medial degeneration or a penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer without an intimal tear. About 10% to 15% of patients with an aortic intramural hematoma progress to a frank dissection with adverse clinical outcomes analogous to those seen in patients presenting initially with a clear dissection flap.

On echocardiography, an aortic intramural hematoma appears as an echogenic thickening of the aortic wall. On transthoracic imaging, intramural hematoma of the ascending aorta may be visualized, but TEE is needed for the diagnosis of other aortic segments. An intramural hematoma of the descending thoracic aorta appears on short-axis images as a crescent-shaped mass adjacent to the aortic lumen and bounded by the bright adventitial echo signal [\(Fig. 16.21](#page--1-48)). Long-axis imaging allows evaluation of the extent of the hematoma.

## AORTIC PSEUDOANEURYSM

An aneurysm involves all the layers of the aortic wall, whereas a pseudoaneurysm is due to loss of integrity of the aortic wall, with a blood collection outside the aorta. After surgery for aortic disease, escape of blood from the graft lumen into an area contained by surrounding scar tissue or the native aorta can occur

**Fig. 16.22 Aortic pseudoaneurysm.** Echocardiography was requested for the evaluation of cardiogenic shock in a 32-year-old man with *Pseudomonas* endocarditis. TEE imaging in a long-axis view *(left)* shows a flail noncoronary leaflet of the aortic valve *(short arrow)* in association with disruption of the posterior aortic sinus of Valsalva, resulting in a pseudoaneurysm *(long arrow)* between the aorta *(Ao)* and LA. The normal right coronary cusp of the aortic valve is seen in a closed position. On color Doppler, flow into and out of the pseudoaneurysm from the aorta and severe aortic regurgitation were seen. The short-axis view *(right)* at the level of communication between the aorta and pseudoaneurysm *(arrow)* shows the distorted appearance of the aortic valve and sinuses. *PA,* Pulmonary artery; *RVOT,* RV outflow tract.

at the proximal or distal graft anastomoses to the aorta or at the coronary reimplantation sites. Pseudoaneurysms also may occur after complex aortic valve surgery with root enlarging procedures or with endocarditis and tissue destruction.

A pseudoaneurysm appears as an echolucent area adjacent to the aortic graft [\(Fig. 16.22\)](#page--1-49). Flow into this region can be demonstrated with color flow imaging, although a TEE study often is necessary for adequate image quality. The pseudoaneurysm may rupture into the mediastinum or pleural spaces (both of which are likely to be fatal) or back across the aortic annulus into the LV. This pseudoaortic regurgitation consists of flow from the pseudoaneurysm into the LV in diastole, with flow from the LV into the pseudoaneurysm in systole. The characteristics of this flow signal on pulsed and CW Doppler are similar to those of transvalvular aortic regurgitation. Color flow imaging shows the flow around, rather than through, the prosthetic aortic valve.

# TRAUMATIC AORTIC DISEASE

Deceleration injury, from a fall or motor vehicle accident, can result in rupture of the aorta at the aortic isthmus (the junction of the arch and descending thoracic aorta adjacent to the ligamentum arteriosus). In some cases, containment of the rupture by hematoma allows diagnosis and emergency surgery. Contrast CT imaging is the optimal approach for diagnosis. The area of disruption often is challenging to recognize on TEE; because disruption extends only a short distance, no intimal flap may be present, and demonstrating flow outside the aorta may be difficult. With delayed diagnosis, a false aneurysm may be seen at the aortic isthmus.

Aortic injury with dissection or hematoma also can be a complication of diagnostic or interventional procedures, including coronary or valve interventions, and rarely may be seen after cardiac surgery related to aortic cannulation or cross-clamping.

# SINUS OF VALSALVA ANEURYSM

A sinus of Valsalva aneurysm can be due to:

- Congenital disease
- Acute infection (e.g., endocarditis)
- An inflammatory process

Echocardiographically, a dilated and distorted sinus of Valsalva is seen both in long- and short-axis views at the aortic valve level either from a TEE or transthoracic approach. A congenital aneurysm often is complex in shape, with a "wind sock" appearance of a mass of irregular, mobile echoes protruding from the aortic sinus into adjacent cardiac structures ([Fig.](#page--1-50) [16.23](#page--1-50)). If the aneurysm is not fenestrated, Doppler flow examination is unremarkable. More commonly, multiple fenestrations are present, with high-velocity turbulent flow from the high-pressure aorta to the

**Fig. 16.23 Ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm.** TTE short-axis views in this 42-year-old man show *(left)* a small congenital sinus of Valsalva aneurysm of the right coronary cusp *(arrow)*, which has ruptured into the RV outflow tract *(RVOT, center)*. CW Doppler *(right)* shows high-velocity (>4 m/s) flow from the aorta into the RV in both diastole and systole, thus confirming that the communication is from the aorta, rather than the LV. *Ao,* Aorta; *PA,* pulmonary artery.

low-pressure adjacent chambers detectable by CW, pulsed wave, and color flow Doppler techniques. Note that infection of a previously competent congenital sinus of Valsalva aneurysm may result in flow across a necrotic area of infection.

Acquired sinus of Valsalva aneurysms tend to be more regular in shape. Dilation of the sinuses in Marfan syndrome symmetrically involves all three sinuses, with a rounded, smooth shape. At surgery, replacement of the ascending aorta is performed with a composite valve and graft (with reimplantation of the coronaries). If only the ascending aorta is replaced in an emergency situation, patients with Marfan syndrome are at risk of progressive dilation and rupture of the residual aortic sinus tissue. A sinus of Valsalva aneurysm due to endocarditis tends to result in a more spherical, but still irregular-appearing, dilation of the sinus and thickening of the aortic wall. Again, the aneurysm protrudes (and may rupture) into adjacent cardiac structures depending on which sinus is involved.

# ATHEROSCLEROTIC AORTIC DISEASE

# Aortic Atherosclerosis as a Potential Source of Embolus

The excellent-quality images of the aorta obtained by TEE imaging have led to the observation of extensive atherosclerotic plaque in many individuals, with mobile thrombi attached to the atheroma in some cases. These observations have generated the hypothesis that atherosclerosis of the ascending aorta and arch may serve as a nidus for embolic material, resulting in cerebrovascular events. These areas of atherosclerosis rarely are seen on transthoracic imaging because of poor image quality related to acoustic access, the depth of the aorta from the transthoracic approach, and the use of a lower-frequency transducer. Echocardiographic evaluation of the extent and severity of atheroma correlates well with histologic examination, and TEE echocardiography is both sensitive and specific for the detection of atheroma-related thrombus formation.

Intraoperative evaluation of the ascending aorta for atheroma to avoid entering the aorta at a site of atherosclerotic disease now is routine before placement of aortic cannula or bypass grafting surgery. Either TEE imaging or direct sterile epiaortic imaging may be used for this evaluation.

# Aortic Atherosclerosis as a Marker of Coronary Artery Disease

The presence of detectable atherosclerotic plaques in the descending aorta on TEE ([Fig. 16.24\)](#page--1-37) indicates the presence of atherosclerosis and thus is a marker of coronary artery disease, with a sensitivity of 90%. Conversely, the absence of detectable atherosclerosis in the descending thoracic aorta suggests that significant coronary artery disease is not present, with a specificity of 90%.

# PULMONARY ARTERY ABNORMALITIES

Most abnormalities of the pulmonary artery are congenital, including poststenotic dilation, branch pulmonary artery stenosis, and an abnormal position of the pulmonary artery, as in transposition of the great vessels. However, the pulmonary artery may

be involved by systemic diseases that affect the aorta, such as Takayasu arteritis. Pulmonary artery dissection is rare but has been reported in patients with chronic pulmonary hypertension.

The finding of a dilated pulmonary artery in the absence of complex congenital heart disease raises the possibility of:

- Right-sided volume overload (e.g., atrial septal defect)
- Pulmonary hypertension
- Idiopathic dilation of the pulmonary artery

The finding of a dilated main pulmonary artery mandates a careful evaluation for right-sided pressure or volume overload. Idiopathic dilation of the pulmonary artery is a rare diagnosis and should be considered only if no other cause exists for pulmonary artery dilation.

The pulmonary artery can be depicted on TTE in a parasternal short-axis view at the aortic valve level or in an RV outflow view. In adults, it is difficult to visualize the anterior pulmonary artery wall because of overlying lung tissue. In younger patients, the pulmonary artery can be demonstrated from the anteriorly angulated apical four-chamber view by further anterior angulation. The subcostal short-axis view allows an alternate approach to depict the pulmonary artery in most patients. From the suprasternal notch window, the right pulmonary artery is seen in cross section in the long-axis view of the aortic arch and in its long axis in the orthogonal view (see [Fig. 16.7](#page--1-30)). The left pulmonary artery can be imaged by slight lateral angulation and posterior rotation from the standard long-axis suprasternal notch view.

TEE images of the pulmonary artery are obtained in a 0° image plane by slowly withdrawing the probe to an esophageal level superior to the LA. This view shows the long axis of the pulmonary artery and its bifurcation, but cannot be obtained in all patients because of interposition of the air-filled bronchus [\(Fig. 16.25](#page--1-51)). The pulmonary artery also is imaged in the 90° plane (analogous to the transthoracic RV outflow view) by turning the transducer to the patient's right from the LV long-axis view. However, image quality often is suboptimal because of the distance of the pulmonary artery from the transducer in this view.

# ALTERNATE APPROACHES

Although TEE has high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of acute aortic dissection and can be performed quickly at the patient's bedside [\(Table](#page--1-52) [16.4\)](#page--1-52), alternate imaging approaches often are preferred, depending on the clinical setting. The choice of imaging procedure depends on the urgency of the clinical presentation, the frequency of imaging, and the additional information needed. In the acute setting, CT angiography is the primary diagnostic modality because radiologists are on site at all times, whereas echocardiographers typically need to travel to the medical center. For long-term serial monitoring of patients with aortic disease, either CT or MRI imaging is appropriate, with MRI preferred to avoid repetitive (albeit low-dose) radiation exposure. Alternatively, the choice of imaging procedures may be driven by the specific additional information needed in an individual patient. Examples include distal vessel anatomy (angiography), adjacent mediastinal

After 3D reconstruction of computed tomographic data, two orthogonal planes *(left and right images)* are adjusted to go through the axis of the structure to be measured (in this case the aortic root). A third plane *(center image)* orthogonal to the first and second is used to measure an exact cross section of the structure of interest. All segments of the aorta should be measured in this fashion to avoid skewed slices and false results. *(From Radke RM, Baumgartner H: Diagnosis and treatment of Marfan syndrome: an update,* Heart *100[17]:1382–1391, 2014, Fig. 3.)*

disease (CT or MRI imaging), or valvular function (echocardiography).

Both CT angiography and MRI imaging provide excellent-quality images of the aorta with sensitivities and specificities for the diagnosis of aortic dissection as high as or higher than TEE ([Figs. 16.26](#page-21-0) and [16.27](#page-21-1)). Chest CT can be used to evaluate aortic disease with the advantages of a wide field of view, high accuracy, and wide availability. Chest CT may identify associated pericardial effusion but is of limited value in the evaluation of LV or aortic valve function. 3D reconstructions of CT scans enhance the ability to relate anatomic findings to one another. Disadvantages include the use of contrast, ionizing radiation, and the nonportable nature of the study.

MRI imaging of the aorta has the advantages of high resolution, high diagnostic accuracy, a wide field of view, and the ability to orient the images along the long axis of the aorta. As with chest CT, MRI imaging equipment is not portable, but contrast is not required for aortic imaging, and no exposure to ionizing radiation occurs. MRI imaging also allows evaluation for aortic regurgitation, pericardial effusion, and LV function. Both chest CT and MRI imaging provide data on branch vessel involvement, information that rarely is obtainable with echocardiography.

- *problematic. The regressions equations in Fig. 16.5 and upper limits of normal in Tables A.9 and A.10 are recommended as benchmarks. All imaging modalities are subject to physiologic and measurement variability, so small changes on serial studies should be interpreted with caution.*

Erratum in: *Eur J Echocardiogr* 12(8):642, 2011. *This guideline recommends TEE as the ultrasound procedure of choice for the evaluation of the thoracic aorta. The*
- *relationships among age, body size, and aortic diameter should be considered in the diagnosis of aortic enlargement. Echocardiography also allows evaluation of aortic elastic properties, detection of atheroma, and diagnosis of aortic dissection. However, CT and MRI imaging are more reliable for evaluation of the arch and descending aorta. Provides details and examples of image acquisition and measurement.*
