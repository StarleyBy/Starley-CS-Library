THE ECHO EXAM SUGGESTED READING

n understanding of the basic principles of ultrasound imaging and Doppler echocardiography is essential both during data acquisition and for correct interpretation of the ultrasound information. Although, at times, current instruments provide instantaneous images so clear and detailed that it seems as if we can "see" the heart and blood flow directly, in actuality we always are looking at images and flow data generated by complex analyses of ultrasound waves reflected and backscattered from the patient's body. Knowledge of the strengths, and more importantly the limitations, of this technique is critical for correct clinical diagnosis and patient management. On the one hand, echocardiography can be used for decision making with a high degree of accuracy in a variety of clinical settings. On the other hand, if an ultrasound artifact is mistaken for an anatomic abnormality, a patient could undergo other needless, expensive, and potentially risky diagnostic tests or therapeutic interventions.

In this chapter, a brief (and necessarily simplified) overview of the basic principles of cardiac ultrasound

imaging and flow analysis is presented. The reader is referred to the Suggested Reading at the end of the chapter for more information on these subjects. Because the details of image processing, artifact formation, and Doppler physics become more meaningful with experience, some readers may choose to return to this chapter after reading other sections of this book and after participating in some echocardiographic examinations.

Sound waves are mechanical vibrations that induce alternate refraction and compression of any physical medium through which they pass (Fig. 1.1). Like other waves, sound waves are described in terms of (Table 1.1):

- Frequency: cycles per second, or hertz (Hz)
- Velocity of propagation
- Wavelength: millimeters (mm)
- Amplitude: decibels (dB)

Frequency (f) is the number of ultrasound waves in a 1-second interval. The units of measurement are hertz, abbreviated Hz, which simply means cycles per second. A frequency of 1000 cycles/s is 1 kilohertz (kHz), and 1 million cycles/s is 1 megahertz (MHz). Humans can hear sound waves with frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz; frequencies higher than this range are termed *ultrasound*. Diagnostic medical ultrasound typically uses transducers with a frequency between 1 and 20 MHz.

The speed that a sound wave moves through the body, called the *velocity of propagation* (c), is different

for each type of tissue. For example, the velocity of propagation in bone is much faster (about 3000 m/s) than in lung tissue (about 700 m/s). However, the velocity of propagation in soft tissues, including myocardium, valves, blood vessels, and blood, is relatively uniform, averaging about 1540 m/s.

### ECHO MATH: Wavelength

Wavelength  $(\lambda)$  is the distance from peak to peak of an ultrasound wave. Wavelength can be calculated by dividing the frequency (f in Hz) by the propagation velocity ( $\epsilon$  in m/s):

$$\lambda = c/f \tag{Eq. 1.1}$$

Because the propagation velocity in the heart is constant at 1540 m/s, the wavelength for any transducer frequency can be calculated (Fig. 1.2) as:

$$\lambda \text{ (mm)} = [1540 \text{ m/s}/f(\text{Hz})]/1000 \text{ mm/m}$$

or

$$\lambda \text{ (mm)} = 1.54/f$$

For example, the wavelength emitted by a 5-MHz transducer can be calculated as:

$$\lambda = 1540 \text{ m/s}/5,000,000 \text{ cycle/s} = 0.000308 \\ m = 0.308 \text{ mm}$$

| Velocity of propagation (c) | The speed that ultrasound travels through tissue                                 | The average velocity of ultrasound in soft tissue is ≈1540 m/s.                                                                   | The velocity of propagation is similar in different soft tissues (e.g., blood, myocardium, liver, fat) but is much lower in lung and much higher in bone.                                       |

Depth of tissue penetration is greatest with a longer wavelength (lower frequency).                          |
| Amplitude (dB)              | Height of the ultrasound<br>wave or "loudness"<br>measured in decibels<br>(dB)   | A log scale is used for dB. On the dB scale, 80 dB represents a 10,000-fold and 40 dB indicates a 100-fold increase in amplitude. | A very wide range of amplitudes can be displayed using a gray-scale display for both imaging and spectral Doppler.                                                                              |

Wavelength is important in diagnostic applications for at least two reasons:

- Image resolution is no greater than 1 to 2 wavelengths (typically about 1 mm).
- The depth of penetration of the ultrasound wave into the body is directly related to wavelength; shorter wavelengths penetrate a shorter distance than longer wavelengths.

Thus there is an obvious trade-off between image resolution (shorter wavelength or higher frequency preferable) and depth penetration (longer wavelength or lower frequency preferable).

The acoustic pressure, or amplitude, of an ultrasound wave indicates the energy of the ultrasound signal. Power is the amount of energy per unit time. Intensity (I) is the amount of power per unit area:

Intensity 
$$(I) = Power^2$$
 (Eq. 1.2)

This relationship shows that if ultrasound power is doubled, intensity is quadruped. Instead of using direct measures of pressure energy, ultrasound amplitude is described relative to a reference value using the decibel scale. Decibels (dB) are familiar to all of us as the standard description of the loudness of a sound.

#### **ECHO MATH:** Decibels

Decibels are logarithmic units based on a ratio of the measured amplitude *(A2)* to a reference amplitude *(A1)* such that:

$$dB = 20 \log(A_2/A_1)$$
 (Eq. 1.3)

Thus a ratio of 1000 to 1 is

$$20 \times \log(1000) = 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dB}$$

a ratio of 100 to 1 is

$$20 \times \log(100) = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dB}$$

and a ratio of 2 to 1 is

$$20 \times \log(2) = 20 \times 0.3 = 6 \text{ dB}$$

A simple rule to remember is that a 6-dB change represents a doubling or halving of the signal amplitude or that a 40-dB change represents a 100 times difference in amplitude [\(Fig. 1.3](#page--1-36)).

![](_page_2_Figure_19.jpeg)

**Fig. 1.2 Transducer frequency versus wavelength and penetration of the ultrasound signal in soft tissue.** Wavelength has been plotted inversely to show that resolution increases with increasing transducer frequency while penetration decreases. The specific wavelengths for transducer frequencies of 1, 2.5, 3.5, 5, and 7.5 MHz are shown.

![](_page_2_Figure_21.jpeg)

**Fig. 1.3 Graph of the decibel scale.** The logarithmic relationship between the decibel scale (horizontal axis) and the amplitude ratio (vertical axis) is seen. A doubling or halving of the amplitude ratio corresponds to a 6-dB change, and a 100-fold difference in amplitude corresponds to a 20-dB change.

If acoustic intensity is used instead of amplitude, the constant 10 replaces 20 in the equation so that a 3-dB change represents doubling, and a 20-dB change indicates a 100-fold difference in amplitude. Both these decibel scales are used to refer to transmitted or received ultrasound waves or to describe attenuation effects. The advantages of the decibel scale are that a very large range can be compressed into a smaller number of values and that low-amplitude (weak) signals can be displayed alongside very highamplitude (strong) signals. In an echocardiographic image, amplitudes typically range from 1 to 120 dB. The decibel scale is the standard format both for echocardiographic image display and for the Doppler spectral display, although other amplitude scales are sometimes available.

# ULTRASOUND TISSUE INTERACTION

Propagation of ultrasound waves in the body to generate ultrasound images and Doppler data depends on a tissue property called *acoustic impedance* ([Table 1.2](#page--1-37)). Acoustic impedance (*Z)* depends on tissue density (*ρ*) and on the propagation velocity in that tissue (*c*):

$$Z = \rho c \tag{Eq. 1.4}$$

Although the velocity of propagation differs among tissues, tissue density is the primary determinant of acoustic impedance for diagnostic ultrasound. Lung tissue has a very low density compared with bone, which has a very high density. Soft tissues, such as blood and myocardium, have much smaller differences in tissue density and acoustic impedance. Acoustic impedance determines the transmission of ultrasound waves through a tissue; *differences* in acoustic impedance result in reflection of ultrasound waves at tissue boundaries.

The interaction of ultrasound waves with the organs and tissues of the body can be described in terms of [\(Fig. 1.4](#page--1-38)):

- Reflection
- Scattering
- Refraction
- Attenuation

**Fig. 1.4 Diagram of the interaction between ultrasound and body tissues.** Doppler analysis is based on the scattering of ultrasound in all directions from moving blood cells with a resulting change in frequency of the ultrasound received at the transducer. 2D imaging is based on reflection of ultrasound from tissue interfaces (specular reflectors). Attenuation limits the depth of ultrasound penetration. Refraction, a change in direction of the ultrasound wave, results in imaging artifacts.

# Reflection

The basis of ultrasound imaging is *reflection* of the transmitted ultrasound signal from internal structures. Ultrasound is reflected at tissue boundaries and interfaces, with the amount of ultrasound reflected dependent on the:

- Difference in acoustic impedance between the two tissues
- Angle of reflection

Smooth tissue boundaries with a lateral dimension greater than the wavelength of the ultrasound beam act as specular, or "mirror-like," reflectors. The amount of ultrasound reflected is constant for a given interface, although the amount received back at the transducer varies with angle because (like light reflected from a mirror) the angle of incidence and reflection is equal. Thus optimal return of reflected ultrasound occurs at a perpendicular angle (90°). Remembering this fact is crucial for obtaining diagnostic ultrasound images. It also accounts for ultrasound "dropout" in a two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) image when too little or no reflected ultrasound reaches the transducer resulting from a parallel alignment between the ultrasound beam and tissue interface.

# Scattering

*Scattering* of the ultrasound signal, instead of reflection, occurs with small structures, such as red blood cells suspended in fluid, because the radius of the cell (about 4 µm) is smaller than the wavelength of the ultrasound signal. Unlike a reflected beam, scattered ultrasound energy radiates in all directions. Only a small amount of the scattered signal reaches the receiving transducer, and the amplitude of a scattered signal is 100 to 1000 times (40–60 dB) less than the amplitude of the returned signal from a specular reflector. Scattering of ultrasound from moving blood cells is the basis of Doppler echocardiography.

The *extent* of scattering depends on:

- Particle size (red blood cells)
- Number of particles (hematocrit)
- Ultrasound transducer frequency
- Compressibility of blood cells and plasma

Although experimental studies show differences in backscattering with changes in hematocrit, variation over the clinical range has little effect on the Doppler signal. Similarly, the size of red blood cells and the compressibility of blood cells and plasma do not change significantly. Thus the primary determinant of scattering is transducer frequency.

Scattering also occurs within tissues, such as the myocardium, from interference of backscattered signals from tissue interfaces smaller than the ultrasound wavelength. Tissue scattering results in a pattern of *speckles;* tissue motion can be measured by tracking these speckles from frame to frame, as discussed in Chapter 4.

# Refraction

Ultrasound waves can be *refracted*—deflected from a straight path—as they pass through a medium with a different acoustic impedance. Refraction of an ultrasound beam is analogous to refraction of light waves as they pass through a curved glass lens (e.g., prescription eyeglasses). Refraction allows enhanced image quality by using acoustic "lenses" to focus the ultrasound beam. However, refraction also occurs in unplanned ways during image formation, with resulting ultrasound artifacts, most notably the "double-image" artifact.

# Attenuation

Attenuation is the loss of signal strength as ultrasound interacts with tissue. As ultrasound penetrates into the body, signal strength is progressively *attenuated* because of absorption of the ultrasound energy by conversion to heat, as well as by reflection and scattering. The degree of attenuation is related to several factors, including the:

- Attenuation coefficient of the tissue
- Transducer frequency
- Distance from the transducer
- Ultrasound intensity (or power)

The attenuation coefficient (α) for each tissue is related the decrease in ultrasound intensity (measured in dB) from one point (I1) to a second point (I2) separated by a distance *(l)* as described by the equation:

$$I_2 = I_1 e^{-2\alpha l}$$
 (Eq. 1.5)

The attenuation coefficient for air is very high (about 1000×) compared with soft tissue so that any air between the transducer and heart results in substantial signal attenuation. This is avoided on transthoracic examinations by use of a water-soluble gel to form an airless contact between the transducer and the skin; on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) examination, attenuation is avoided by maintaining close contact between the transducer and esophageal wall. The air-filled lungs are avoided by careful patient positioning and the use of acoustic "windows" that allow access of the ultrasound beam to the cardiac structures without intervening lung tissue. Other intrathoracic air (e.g., pneumomediastinum, residual air after cardiac surgery) also results in poor ultrasound tissue penetration because of attenuation, resulting in suboptimal image quality.

The power output of the transducer is directly related to the overall degree of attenuation. However, an increase in power output causes thermal and mechanical bioeffects as discussed in "Bioeffects and Safety," p. 27.

Overall attenuation is frequency dependent such that lower ultrasound frequencies penetrate deeper into the body than higher frequencies. The depth of penetration for adequate imaging tends to be limited to approximately 200 wavelengths. This translates roughly into a penetration depth of 30 cm for a 1-MHz transducer, 6 cm for a 5-MHz transducer, and 1.5 cm for a 20-MHz transducer, although diagnostic images at depths greater than these postulated limits can be obtained with state-of-the-art equipment. Thus attenuation, as much as resolution, dictates the need for a particular transducer frequency in a specific clinical setting. For example, visualization of distal structures from the apical approach in a large adult patient often requires a low-frequency transducer. From a TEE approach, the same structures can be imaged (at better resolution) with a higherfrequency transducer. The effects of attenuation are minimized on displayed images by using different gain settings at each depth, an instrument control called time-gain (or depth-gain) compensation.

# TRANSDUCERS

#### Piezoelectric Crystal

Ultrasound transducers use a piezoelectric crystal both to generate and to receive ultrasound waves ([Fig.](#page--1-39) [1.5](#page--1-39)). A piezoelectric crystal is a material (e.g., quartz or a titanate ceramic) with the property that an applied electric current results in alignment of polarized

![](_page_5_Figure_11.jpeg)

**Fig. 1.5 Schematic diagram of an ultrasound transducer.** The piezoelectric crystal both produces and receives ultrasound signals, with the electric input-output transmitted to the instrument via the cable. Damping material allows a short pulse length (improved resolution). The shape of the piezoelectric crystal, an acoustic lens, or electronic focusing (with a phased-array transducer) is used to modify beam geometry. The material of the transducer surface provides impedance matching with the skin. The ultrasound pulse length for 2D imaging is short (1–6 ms), typically consisting of two wavelengths (λ). "Ring down"—the decrease in frequency and amplitude in the pulse—depends on damping and determines bandwidth (the range of frequencies in the signal).

particles perpendicular to the face of the crystal with consequent expansion of crystal size. When an alternating electric current is applied, the crystal alternately compresses and expands, generating an ultrasound wave. The frequency that a transducer emits depends on the nature and thickness of the piezoelectric material.

Conversely, when an ultrasound wave strikes the piezoelectric crystal, an electric current is generated. Thus the crystal can serve both as a "receiver" and as a "transmitter." Basically, the ultrasound transducer transmits a brief burst of ultrasound and then switches to the "receive mode" to await the reflected ultrasound signals from the intracardiac acoustic interfaces. This cycle is repeated temporally and spatially to generate ultrasound images. Image formation is based on the *time delay* between ultrasound transmission and return of the reflected signal. Deeper structures have a longer time of flight than shallower structures, with the exact depth calculated based on the speed of sound in blood and the time interval between the transmitted burst of ultrasound and return of the reflected signal.

The burst, or pulse, of ultrasound generated by the piezoelectric crystal is very brief, typically 1 to 6 µs, because a short pulse length results in improved axial (along the length of the beam) resolution. Damping material is used to control the ring-down time of the crystal and hence the pulse length. Pulse length also is determined by frequency because a shorter time is needed for the same number of cycles at higher frequencies. The number of ultrasound pulses per second is called the *pulse repetition frequency*

(PRF). The total time interval from pulse to pulse is called the *cycle length,* with the percentage of the cycle length used for ultrasound transmission called the *duty factor*. Ultrasound imaging has a duty factor of about 1% compared with 5% for pulsed Doppler and 100% for continuous-wave (CW) Doppler. The duty factor is a key element in the patient's total ultrasound exposure.

The range of frequencies contained in the pulse is described as its *frequency bandwidth.* A wider bandwidth allows better axial resolution because of the ability of the system to produce a narrow pulse. Transducer bandwidth also affects the range of frequencies that can be detected by the system with a wider bandwidth, which allows better resolution of structures distant from the transducer. The stated frequency of a transducer represents the center frequency of the pulse.

# Types of Transducers

The simplest type of ultrasound transducer is based on a single piezoelectric crystal ([Table 1.3\)](#page--1-40). Alternate pulsed transmission and reception periods allow repeated sampling along a single line, with the sampling rate limited only by the time delay needed for return of the reflected ultrasound wave from the depth of interest. An example of using the transducer for simple transmission and reception along a single line is an A-mode (amplitude vs. depth) or M-mode (depth vs. time) cardiac recording when a high sampling rate is desirable.

Formation of more complex images uses an array of ultrasound crystals arranged to provide a 2D tomographic or 3D volumetric data set of signals. Each element in the transducer array can be controlled electronically both to direct the ultrasound beam across the region of interest and to focus the transmitted and received signals. Echocardiographic imaging uses a *sector scanning* format with the ultrasound signal originating from a single location (the narrow end of the sector), thus resulting in a fanlike shape of the image. Sector scanning is optimal for cardiac applications because it allows a fast frame rate to show cardiac motion and a small transducer size (aperture or "footprint") to fit into the narrow acoustic windows used for echocardiography. 3D imaging transducers are discussed in Chapter 4.

Most transducers can provide simultaneous imaging and Doppler analysis, for example, 2D imaging and a superimposed color Doppler display. Quantitative Doppler velocity data are recorded with the image "frozen" or with only intermittent image updates, with the ultrasound crystals used to optimize the Doppler signal. Although CW Doppler signals can be obtained using two elements of combined transducer, use of a dedicated nonimaging transducer with two separate crystals (with one crystal continuously transmitting and the other continuously receiving the ultrasound waves) is recommended when accurate high-velocity recordings are needed. The final configuration of a transducer depends on transducer frequency (higher-frequency transducers are smaller) and beam focusing, as well as the intended clinical use, for example, transthoracic versus TEE imaging.

# Beam Shape and Focusing

An unfocused ultrasound beam is shaped like the light from a flashlight, with a tubular beam for a short distance that then diverges into a broad cone of light [\(Fig. 1.6\)](#page--1-41). Even with current focused transducers, ultrasound beams have a 3D shape that affects measurement accuracy and contributes to imaging artifacts. Beam shape and size depend on several factors, including:

- Transducer frequency
- Distance from the transducer
- Aperture size and shape
- Beam focusing

Aperture size and shape and beam focusing can be manipulated in the design of the transducer, but the effects of frequency and depth are inherent to ultrasound physics. For an unfocused beam, the initial segment of the beam is columnar in shape (near-field *Fn*) with a length dependent on the diameter (D) of the transducer face and wavelength (λ):

$$F_n = D^2/4\lambda \tag{Eq. 1.6}$$

For a 3.5-MHz transducer with a 5-mm diameter aperture, this corresponds to a columnar length of 1.4 cm. Beyond this region, the ultrasound beam diverges (far field), with the angle of divergence θ determined as:

$$\sin \theta = 1.22 \lambda / D \qquad (Eq. 1.7)$$

This equation indicates a divergence angle of 6° beyond the near field, resulting in an ultrasound beam width of about 4.4 cm at a depth of 20 cm for this 3.5-MHz transducer. With a 10-mm diameter aperture, *Fn* would be 5.7 cm, and beam width at 20 cm would be about 2.5 cm ([Fig. 1.7](#page--1-42)).

The shape and focal depth (narrowest point) of the primary beam can be altered by making the surface of the piezoelectric crystal concave or by the addition of an acoustic lens. This allows generation of a beam with optimal characteristics at the depth of most cardiac structures, but again, divergence of the beam beyond the focal zone occurs. Some transducers allow manipulation of the focal zone during the examination. Even with focusing, the ultrasound beam generated by each transducer has a lateral and an elevational dimension that depends on the transducer aperture, frequency, and focusing. Beam geometry for phased-array transducers also depends

on the size, spacing, and arrangement of the piezoelectric crystals in the array.

In addition to the main ultrasound beam, dispersion of ultrasound energy laterally from a single-crystal transducer results in formation of *side lobes* at an angle θ from the central beam where sin θ = *mλ/*D, and *m* is an integer describing sequential side lobes (i.e., 1, 2, 3, and so on) ([Fig. 1.8\)](#page--1-43). Reflected or backscattered signals from these side lobes are received by the transducer, resulting in image or flow artifacts. With phased-array transducers, additional accessory beams at an even greater angle from the primary beam, termed *grating lobes,* also occur as a result of constructive interference of ultrasound wave fronts. Both the side lobes and the grating lobes affect the lateral and elevational resolution of the transducer.

![](_page_8_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 1.6 Schematic diagram of beam geometry for an unfocused** *(left)* **and focused** *(right)* **transducer.** The length of the near zone and the divergence angle in the far field depend on transducer frequency and aperture. The focal zone of a focused transducer can be adjusted, but beam width still depends on depth. Side lobes (and grating lobes with phased-array transducers) occur with both focused and unfocused transducers and, like the central beam, are 3D.

![](_page_8_Figure_4.jpeg)

**Fig. 1.7 Transducer frequency versus near zone length and divergence angle.** Transducer frequency is shown on the horizontal axis with the length of the near zone shown in yellow and divergence angle in blue for unfocused 5-mm *(squares)* and 10-mm *(triangles)* diameter aperture transducers. [Eqs. 1.6 and 1.7](#page--1-44) were used to generate these curves.

### Resolution

Image resolution occurs for each of three dimensions [\(Fig. 1.9](#page--1-45)):

- A*xial resolution* along the length of the ultrasound beam
- *Lateral resolution* side to side across the 2D image
- *Elevational resolution* or thickness of the tomographic slice

Of these three, axial resolution is most precise, so quantitative measurements are made most reliably using data derived from a perpendicular alignment between the ultrasound beam and structure of interest. Axial resolution depends on the transducer frequency, bandwidth, and pulse length but is independent of depth [\(Table 1.4\)](#page--1-46). Determination of the smallest resolvable distance between two specular reflectors with ultrasound is complex but is typically about twice the transmitted wavelength; higher-frequency (shorter-wavelength) transducers have greater axial resolution. For example, with a 3.5-MHz transducer, axial resolution is about 1 mm, versus 0.5 mm with a 7.5-MHz transducer. A wider bandwidth also improves resolution by allowing a shorter pulse, thus avoiding overlap between the reflected ultrasound signals from two adjacent reflectors.

Lateral resolution varies with the depth of the specular reflector from the transducer, primarily related to beam width at each depth. In the focal region where beam width is narrow, lateral resolution approaches axial resolution, and a point target will appear as a point on the 2D image. At greater depths, beam width diverges so a point target results in a reflected signal as wide as the width of the beam and accounts for "blurring" of images in the far field. If the 2D image is examined carefully, progressive widening of the echo signals from similar targets along the length of the ultrasound beam can be appreciated [\(Fig. 1.10\)](#page--1-47). Erroneous interpretations occur when the effects of beam width are not recognized. For example, beam width artifact from a strong

![](_page_9_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 1.8 Transducer beam side lobes.** *(Top)* This diagram shows that side lobes occur at the points where the distances traversed by the ultrasound pulse from each edge of the crystal face differ by exactly one wavelength. The distance from the left edge of the crystal (P1) to the position of side lobe 1 is exactly one wavelength (λ) longer than the distance from the extreme right edge of the crystal (P2) to the position of side lobe 1. *(Bottom)* The beam intensity plot formed by sweeping along an arc at focal length F. *(From Geiser EA: Echocardiography: physics and instrumentation. In Skorton DJ, Schelbert AR, et al, editors:* Marcus Cardiac Imaging, *ed 2, Philadelphia, 1996, Saunders, p 280. Used with permission.)*

specular reflector often appears to be an abnormal linear structure. Other factors that affect lateral resolution are transducer frequency, aperture, bandwidth, and side and grating lobe levels.

Resolution in the elevational plane is more difficult to recognize on the 2D image but is equally important in clinical diagnosis. The thickness of the tomographic plane varies across the 2D image,

depending on transducer design and focusing, both of which affect beam width in the elevational plane at each depth. In general, cardiac ultrasound images have a "thickness" of approximately 3 to 10 mm depending on depth and the specific transducer used. The tomographic image generated by the instrument, in effect, includes reflected and backscattered signals from this entire thickness. Strong reflectors adjacent to the image plane can appear to be "in" the image plane because of elevational beam width. Even more distant strong reflectors sometimes appear superimposed on the tomographic plane because of side lobes in the elevational plane. For example, a linear echo in the aortic lumen from an adjacent calcified atheroma may look like a dissection flap. These principles of ultrasound imaging also apply to 3D echocardiography.

# ULTRASOUND IMAGING MODALITIES

### M-Mode

Historically, cardiac ultrasound began with a singlecrystal transducer display of the amplitude *(A)* of reflected ultrasound versus depth on an oscilloscope screen. This A-mode display used to be shown on the 2D image screen to aid the examiner in optimal adjustment of the instrument controls. Repeated pulse transmission-and-receive cycles allow rapid updating of the amplitude-versus-depth information so that rapidly moving structures, such as the aortic or mitral valve leaflets, can be identified by their characteristic timing and pattern of motion [\(Fig. 1.11\)](#page--1-49).

With the time dimension shown explicitly on the horizontal axis and each amplitude signal along the length of the ultrasound beam converted to a corresponding gray-scale level, a *motion (M) mode display*

![](_page_10_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 1.9 Axial, lateral, and elevational slice thickness in 3D for a phased-array transducer ultrasound beam.** (A) Axial resolution along the direction of the beam is independent of depth; lateral resolution and elevational resolution are strongly depth dependent. Lateral resolution is determined by transmit and receive focus electronics; elevational resolution is determined by the height of the transducer elements. At the focal distance, axial is better than lateral and is better than elevational resolution. (B) Elevational resolution profile with an acoustic lens across the transducer array produces a focal zone in the slice thickness direction. *(Adapted from Bushberg JT, Seibert JA, Leidholdt EH, et al:* The essential physics of medical imaging, *2 ed, Philadelphia, 2002, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Fig. 16.21).*

![](_page_10_Picture_5.jpeg)

**Fig. 1.10 Beam width effect on 2D imaging.** 2D echocardiographic view of the LV from an apical approach. The effect of beam width can be appreciated by comparing the length of reflections from point targets near and at greater distances from the transducer as shown by the *arrows.*

is produced. M-mode data are shown on the video monitor either "scrolling" or "sweeping" across the screen at 50 to 100 mm/s. The 2D imaging allows guidance of the M-mode beam to ensure an appropriate angle between the M line and the structures of interest.

Because only a single "line of sight" is included in an M-mode tracing, the PRF of the transmissionand-receive cycle is limited only by the time needed for the ultrasound beam to travel to the maximum depth of interest and back to the transducer. Even a depth of 20 cm requires only 0.26 ms (given a speed of propagation of 1540 m/s), thus allowing a PRF up to 3850 times/s. In actual practice, sampling rates of about 1800 times/s are used. This extremely high sampling rate is valuable for accurate evaluation of rapid normal intracardiac motion such as valve opening and closing. In addition, continuously moving structures, such as the ventricular endocardium, are identified more accurately when motion versus time, as well as depth, is displayed clearly on the M-mode recording. Other examples of rapid intracardiac motion best demonstrated with M-mode imaging include the high-frequency fluttering of the anterior mitral leaflet in patients with aortic regurgitation and the rapid oscillating motion of valvular vegetations.

# Two-Dimensional Echocardiography *Image Production*

A 2D echocardiographic image is generated from the data obtained by electronically "sweeping" the ultrasound beam across the tomographic plane. For each scan line, short pulses (or bursts of ultrasound) are emitted at a PRF determined by the time needed for ultrasound to travel to and from the maximum image depth. The pulse repetition period is the total time

![](_page_11_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 1.11 3D, 2D, M-mode, and A-mode recordings of aortic valve motion.** This illustration shows the following: the relationship between the 3D and 2D long-axis image of the aortic valve *(left),* which shows distance in both the vertical and horizontal direction; M-mode recording of aortic root *(Ao),* LA, and aortic valve motion, which shows depth-versus-time *(middle);* and A-mode recording *(right),* which shows depth only (with motion seen on the video screen). Spatial relationships are best shown with 3D or 2D imaging, but temporal resolution is higher with M-mode and A-mode imaging.

from pulse to pulse, including the length of the ultrasound signal plus the time interval between signals.

Because a finite time is needed for each scan line of data (depending on the depth of interest), the time needed to acquire all the data for one image frame is directly related to the number of scan lines and the imaging depth. Thus PRF is lower at greater imaging depths and higher at shallow depths. In addition, a trade-off exists between scan line density and image frame rate (the number of images per second). For cardiac applications, a high frame rate (≥30 frames per second) is desirable for accurate display of cardiac motion. This frame rate allows 33 ms per frame or 128 scan lines per 2D image at a displayed depth of 20 cm.

The reflected ultrasound signals for each scan line are received by the piezoelectric crystal and a small electric signal generated with:

- Amplitude proportional to incident angle and acoustic impedance
- Timing proportional to distance from the transducer

This signal undergoes complex manipulation to form the final image displayed on the monitor. Typical processing includes signal amplification, time-gain compensation (TGC), filtering (to reduce noise), compression, and rectification. Envelope detection generates a bright spot for each signal along the scan line, which then undergoes analog-to-digital scan conversion because the original polar coordinate data must be fit to a rectangular matrix with appropriate interpolation for missing matrix elements. This image is subject to further "postprocessing" to enhance the visual appreciation of tomographic anatomy and is displayed in "real time" (nearly simultaneous with data acquisition) on the monitor screen.

Although standard ultrasound imaging is based on reflection of the fundamental transmitted frequency from tissue interfaces, *tissue harmonic imaging (THI)* instead is based on the harmonic frequency energy generated as the ultrasound signal propagates through the tissues. These harmonic frequencies result from the nonlinear effects of the interaction of ultrasound with tissue and with the key properties:

- Harmonic signal strength increases with depth of propagation.
- Harmonic frequencies are maximal at typical cardiac imaging depths.
- Stronger fundamental frequencies produce stronger harmonics.

![](_page_12_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 1.12 Relation between imaging distance and strength of fundamental and harmonic frequencies.** As ultrasound pulse propagates, strength of fundamental frequency declines while strength of harmonic frequency increases. At usual imaging distances for cardiac structures, strength of harmonic frequency is maximized. In this schematic, harmonic frequency strength is exaggerated; harmonic frequency signal strength is much lower than fundamental frequency signal strength. *(From Thomas JD, Rubin DN: Tissue harmonic imaging: why does it work?* J Am Soc Echocardiogr *11:803–808, 1998.)*

Thus harmonic imaging reduces near-field and side-lobe artifacts and improves endocardial definition, particularly in patients with poor fundamental frequency images [\(Fig. 1.12\)](#page--1-50). THI improves visualization of the left ventricular (LV) endocardium, which allows border tracing for calculation of ejection fraction, reduces measurement variability, and results in visualization of more myocardial segments during stress echocardiography. However, although THI improves lateral resolution by 20% to 50%, it reduces axial resolution by 40% to 100%. Valves and other planar objects therefore appear thicker with harmonic, compared with fundamental, frequency imaging, so that caution is needed when diagnosing valve abnormalities or making measurements of chamber or vessel size.

### *Instrument Settings*

Many of the elements in the process of image formation are features of a particular transducer and instrument that cannot be modified by the operator. However, for each patient and echocardiographic view, optimal image quality depends on transducer selection and instrument settings. Standard imaging controls available in most ultrasound systems include:

- *Power output:* This control adjusts the total ultrasound energy delivered by the transducer in the transmitted bursts; higher power outputs result in higher-amplitude reflected signals.
- *Gain:* The control adjusts the displayed amplitude of the received signals, similar to the volume control in an audio system.

- *TGC:* This control allows differential adjustment of gain along the length of the ultrasound beam to compensate for the effects of attenuation. Near-field gain can be set lower (because reflected signals are stronger) with a gradually increased gain over the midfield ("ramp" or "slope") and a higher gain in the far field (because reflected signals are weaker). On some instruments, near-field gain and far-field gain beyond the range of the TGC are adjusted separately.
- *Depth:* Displayed depth affects the PRF and frame rate of the image and also allows maximal display of the area of interest on the screen. Standard depth settings show the entire plane (from the transducer down), whereas "resolution," "zoom," or "magnification" modes focus on a specific depth range of interest.
- *Dynamic range or compression:* The amplitude range (in dB) of the reflected signal is greater than the display capacity of ultrasound systems so the signal is compressed into a range of values from white to black, or gray scale. The number of levels of gray in the image, or *dynamic range,* can be adjusted to provide an image with marked contrast between light and dark areas or a gradation of gray levels between the lightest and darkest areas. A variation of standard gray scale is to use color intensity for each amplitude value.

Other typical instrument controls include preprocessing and postprocessing settings that change the appearance of the displayed image. Image quality and resolution also depend on scan-line density and other factors (see [Table 1.4\)](#page--1-46). Scan-line density (or frame rate or both) can be increased by using a lower depth setting or by narrowing the sector to less than the standard 60° wide image.

# *Imaging Artifacts*

Imaging artifacts include (1) extraneous ultrasound signals that result in the appearance of "structures" that are not actually present (at least at that location), (2) failure to visualize structures that are present, and (3) an image of a structure that differs in size or shape or both from its actual appearance. Obviously, recognition of image artifacts is important for both the individual performing the study and the individual interpreting the echocardiographic data [\(Table 1.5\)](#page--1-40).

The most common image "artifact" is *suboptimal image quality* resulting from poor ultrasound tissue penetration related to the patient's body habitus with interposition of high-attenuation tissues (e.g., lung or bone) or an increased distance (e.g., adipose tissue) between the transducer and cardiac structures. Although, strictly speaking, poor image quality is not

![](_page_13_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 1.13 Example of acoustic shadowing and reverberations.** TEE view in a patient with a valve replacement *(MVR)* shows shadowing *(S)* by the sewing ring with reverberations *(R)* from the valve occluders further obscuring the ventricle.

an "artifact," a low signal-to-noise ratio makes accurate diagnosis difficult and precludes quantitative measurements. In many patients with suboptimal ultrasound penetration, image quality is improved by use of tissue harmonic imaging. In some cases, TEE imaging is needed to make an accurate diagnosis.

*Acoustic shadowing* ([Fig. 1.13](#page--1-51)) occurs when a structure with a marked difference in acoustic impedance (e.g., prosthetic valve, calcium) blocks transmission of the ultrasound wave beyond that point. The image appears devoid of reflected signals distal to this structure because no signal penetrates beyond the shadowing structure. The shape of the shadow (like a light shadow) follows the ultrasound path, so a small structure near the transducer casts a large shadow. When shadowing occurs, an alternate acoustic window is needed for evaluation of the area of interest. In some cases, a different transthoracic view will suffice. In other cases (e.g., prosthetic mitral valve), TEE imaging is necessary.

*Reverberations* [\(Fig. 1.14\)](#page--1-52) are multiple, linear, highamplitude echo signals originating from two strong specular reflectors resulting in back-and-forth reflection of the ultrasound signal before it returns to the transducer. On the image, reverberations appear as relatively parallel, irregular, dense lines extending from the structure into the far field. Like acoustic shadowing, prominent reverberations limit evaluation of structures in the far field. In less dramatic cases, reverberations appear to represent abnormal structures. For example, in the parasternal long-axis view, a linear echo in the aortic root that originates as a reverberation from anterior structures (e.g., ribs) may be mistaken for a dissection flap.

The term *beam width artifact* is applied to two separate sources of image artifacts. First, remember that all the structures within the 3D volume of the ultrasound beam are displayed in a single tomographic plane. In the focal zone of the beam, the 3D volume is quite small, and the tomographic "slice" is narrow. In the far zone, however, strong reflectors at the edge of a larger beam are superimposed on structures in the central zone of the beam even though signal intensity falls off at the edges of the beam. In addition, strong reflectors in side lobes of the beam are displayed in the tomographic section corresponding to the main beam ([Fig. 1.15](#page--1-53)).

![](_page_14_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 1.14 Reverberation artifacts result from the interaction of ultrasound with two parallel strong reflectors.** The transmitted ultrasound beam *(red with downward arrow)* is reflected from the first reflector and returns to the transducer *(red with upward arrow),* thus resulting in an ultrasound signal that corresponds to the correct depth of the reflector. However, ultrasound signals also reflect back and forth between the two strong reflectors, with some signals returning to the transducer after two *(A),* three *(B),* or more reverberation cycles. The longer time from transmission to reception of these late-returning signals results in their display on the ultrasound image at points distal to the actual reflector. In clinical imaging, reverberation artifacts can appear either as a single linear signal distal to the actual object or as a band of signals obscuring distal structures (see [Fig. 1.13\)](#page--1-51) because of multiple parallel reflectors.

The second type of beam width artifact is a consequence of varying lateral resolution at different imaging depths. A point target appears as a line whose length depends on the beam characteristics at that depth and the amplitude of the reflected signal. For example, the struts on a prosthetic valve can appear much longer than their actual dimension because of poor lateral resolution. Sometimes beam width artifacts can be mistaken for abnormal structures such as a valvular vegetation, an intracardiac mass, or an aortic dissection flap.

The appearance of a side-by-side double image results from ultrasound *refraction* as it passes through a tissue proximal to the structure of interest. This artifact often is seen in parasternal short-axis views of the aortic valve or LV, where a second valve or LV

![](_page_14_Figure_7.jpeg)

**Fig. 1.15 Example of beam width artifact.** Apparent "mass" *(arrow)* attached to the aortic valve on this off-axis TEE view is the noncoronary cusp of the aortic valve seen en face. Imaging in other planes demonstrated a normal trileaflet aortic valve. *Ao,* Aorta; *RVOT,* right ventricular outflow tract.

is "seen" medial to and partly overlapping the actual valve or LV. The explanation for this appearance is that the transmitted ultrasound beam is deviated from a straight path (the scan line) by refraction as it passes through a tissue near the transducer. When this refracted beam is reflected back to the transducer by a tissue interface, the reflected signal is assumed to have originated from the scan line of the transmitted pulse ([Fig. 1.16\)](#page--1-54) and thus is displayed on the image in the wrong location.

*Range ambiguity* occurs when echo signals from an earlier pulse cycle reach the transducer on the next "listen cycle" for that scan line; as a result, deep structures appear closer to the transducer than their actual location. The appearance of an anatomically unexpected echo within a cardiac chamber often is due to range ambiguity, as can be demonstrated by the disappearance or a change in position of this artifact when the depth setting (and PRF) is changed. Another type of range ambiguity is the appearance of an apparent second heart, deeper than the actual heart—a double image on the vertical axis. This type of range ambiguity results from echoes being rereflected by a structure close to the transducer (e.g., a rib), being re-reflected by the cardiac structures, and thus received at the transducer at a time *twice* normal. This artifact can be eliminated (or obscured) by decreasing the depth setting or adjusting the transducer position to a better acoustic window.

![](_page_15_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 1.16 Mechanism of a double-image artifact on 2D echocardiography.** An ultrasound pulse reflected from *point 1* of the LV endocardium returns to the transducer and is shown appropriately as a bright spot in the correct position on the 2D image. Later in the scan, an ultrasound pulse is refracted by an intervening tissue so that the beam is reflected back to the transducer from *point 2.* However, this reflected signal is shown along the transmission scan line *(point 3)* because this is the presumed origin of the reflected signal. *Ao,* Aorta in cross section.

*Electronic processing* artifacts can be difficult to identify and vary from instrument to instrument. In addition, types of artifacts other than those listed have been described.

# Three-Dimensional Echocardiography

Three-dimensional echocardiographic imaging is based on the same ultrasound principles used in 2D imaging with more complex acquisition of a volume of ultrasound data and more complex display options. (See Chapter 4 for details.) The physics of 3D imaging is very similar to that of 2D imaging, and issues such as beam width, resolution, and frame rate affect both approaches. The 3D echocardiographic displays currently used in clinical practice provide perspective-type anatomic images from different points of view, for example, a view of the left atrial (LA) side of the mitral valve. The same imaging artifacts seen on 2D images also can be seen with 3D imaging.

# Echocardiographic Imaging Measurements

Echocardiographic measurements are most accurate using axial resolution (i.e., along the length of the ultrasound beam). Measurements can be made using the *leading edge–to–leading edge* convention or at the white-black interface between tissues. The rationale for measuring from the leading edge is that the first reflection detected from the tissue interface is the best measure of its actual location, with other signals arriving slightly later because of reflections from within the tissue, reverberations, and ring-down artifact. The leading edge convention is used for M-mode studies, and much of the literature validating echocardiographic measurements for clinical decision making is based on this measurement approach.

On 2D images, identification of the leading edge is challenging—for example, in a parasternal long-axis view, separating the leading edge of the LV septal endocardium from signals originating within the septal myocardium. Instead, 2D measurements of cardiac chambers and great vessels are made using the whiteblack interface; LV internal dimensions are measured from the white-black interface of the septum to the white-black interface of the posterior wall. With current image quality, the white-black interface is a reasonable representation of the actual tissue-blood interface because the leading edge of the endocardial echo and the white-black interface are nearly identical. For measurements of great vessels, such as the aorta, the white-black interface convention is more reproducible than attempts to identify a leading edge on 2D images. Measurement of small solid or planar structures is problematic, so direct measurements of valve thickness, for example, are not routine.

Quantitative measurements are problematic because the 3D data are viewed as a 2D image, so measurements are made on 2D images within the 3D dataset. Using this approach, 3D echocardiographic LV volumes are more accurate than those obtained by 2D imaging, as discussed in Chapter 4.

# DOPPLER ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY

# Doppler Velocity Data *Doppler Equation*

Doppler echocardiography is based on the change in frequency of the backscattered signal from small moving structures (e.g., red blood cells) intercepted by the ultrasound beam ([Table 1.6\)](#page--1-55). A visual analogy is that Doppler scattering from blood is similar to scattering of light in fog, whereas imaging is similar to reflections from a mirror. A stationary target, if much smaller than the wavelength, will scatter ultrasound in all directions, with the frequency of the scattered signal being the same as the transmitted frequency when observed from any direction. A moving target, however, will backscatter ultrasound to the transducer so that the frequency observed when the target is moving *toward* the transducer is higher and the frequency observed when the target is moving *away* from the transducer is lower than the original transmitted frequency ([Fig. 1.17\)](#page--1-56). This Doppler effect

![](_page_17_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 1.17 The Doppler effect.** *(Left)* A stationary scatterer scatters ultrasound symmetrically in all directions with a wavelength identical to the transmitted wavelength and with the same frequency in all directions (no Doppler shift). *(Right)* A moving scatterer also scatters ultrasound symmetrically in all directions. However, the frequency will be higher when the scatterer is moving toward the transducer *(F2)* than when it is moving away from the transducer *(F1)* because of the movement of the scatterer resulting in waves closer together in advance of and farther apart behind the moving object.

is known to all of us from audio examples of the change in sound of a car horn, siren, or train whistle as it moves toward (higher pitch) and then away (lower pitch) from the observer.

The difference in frequency between the transmitted frequency (*F*T) and the scattered signal received back at the transducer (*F*S) is the Doppler shift:

Doppler shift = 
$$(F_s - F_T)$$
 (Eq. 1.8)

Doppler shifts are in the audible range (0–20 kHz) for intracardiac velocities using diagnostic ultrasound transducer frequencies. The relationship between the Doppler shift and blood flow velocity (*v*, in m/s) is expressed in the Doppler equation:

$$v = c (F_s - F_T) / [2 F_T (\cos \theta)]$$
 (Eq. 1.9)

where *c* is the speed of sound in blood (1540 m/s), θ is the intercept angle between the ultrasound beam and the direction of blood flow, and 2 is a factor to correct for the transit time both *to* and *from* the scattering source ([Fig. 1.18\)](#page--1-57).

Note that the intercept angle is critically important in calculation of blood flow velocity. The cosine of an angle of 0° or 180° (parallel toward or away from the transducer) is 1, allowing this term to be ignored when the ultrasound beam is aligned parallel to the direction of blood flow. In contrast, the cosine of 90° is *zero,* indicating that no Doppler shift will be recorded if the ultrasound beam is perpendicular to blood flow.

In cardiac Doppler applications, the ultrasound beam is aligned as close as possible to parallel with the direction of blood flow so that the cos θ can be assumed to be 1. Because the direction of intracardiac blood flow can be difficult to ascertain and is not predictable from the 2D image, especially with abnormal flow patterns, attempts to "correct" for intercept angle usually result in significant errors in

**Fig. 1.18 The Doppler equation.** The velocity *V* of blood flow can be calculated from the speed of sound in blood *c,* transducer frequency *FT,* backscattered frequency *FS,* and the cosine of the angle *θ* between the ultrasound beam and direction of blood flow. *T,* Transducer.

velocity calculation. Even when blood flow direction is apparent in a 2D plane, direction in the elevational plane remains unknown. Deviation up to 20° from a parallel intercept angle results a calculated velocity only 6% less than the actual blood flow velocity. However, a 60° intercept angle results in a calculated velocity that is only one-half the actual velocity. The importance of the intercept angle is particularly underlined in the setting of abnormal blood flow with high-velocity jets, such as in valvular stenosis. Although angle correction for the presumed direction of blood flow is used in some peripheral vascular applications, this approach is not acceptable for cardiac applications because of the likelihood that the "correction" will be erroneous.

# *Spectral Analysis*

When the backscattered signal is received at the transducer, the difference between the transmitted and backscattered signals is determined by "comparing" the two waveforms. This is a complex process because multiple frequencies are present in the backscattered signal. Typically, the frequency content of the signal is analyzed by a process known as a *fast Fourier transform* (FFT) that derives the component frequencies of a complex signal. Alternate methods of frequency analysis include the analog Chirp-Z method.

The display generated by this frequency analysis is termed *spectral analysis* [\(Fig. 1.19](#page--1-58)). By convention, this display shows time on the horizontal axis, the zero baseline in the center, and frequency shifts toward the transducer above and frequency shifts away from the transducer below the baseline. Because multiple frequencies exist at any time point, each frequency signal is displayed as a pixel on the vertical axis, with the gray scale indicating the amplitude (or loudness) and the position on the vertical axis

**Fig. 1.19 Examples of** *(top)* **pulsed and** *(bottom)* **CW spectral Doppler displays.** LV outflow recorded from an apical approach is shown in the standard format. The baseline has been moved from the middle of the vertical axis to display the antegrade flow signal. Velocities *(Vel)* toward the transducer are shown above and velocities away from the transducer below the baseline. The velocity range is determined by the Nyquist limit (½ pulse-repetition frequency) with pulsed Doppler echocardiography. Velocities are shown in shades of gray corresponding to the amplitude (dB) of the signal. Note the "envelope" of flow with pulsed Doppler because flow is sampled at a specific intracardiac location with relatively uniform blood flow velocities. With CW Doppler, the curve is "filled in" due to multiple blood flow velocities along the entire length of the ultrasound beam. *Arrows* indicate aortic valve closing click.

indicating the blood flow velocity (or frequency shift) component. Thus, each time point on the spectral display shows:

- Blood flow direction
- Velocity (or frequency shift)
- Signal amplitude

Each of these components is displayed at 4-ms intervals (or 250 times/s) simultaneous with data acquisition.

# *Continuous-Wave Doppler Ultrasound*

CW Doppler uses two ultrasound crystals; one continuously transmits and one continuously receives the ultrasound signal. The major advantage of CW Doppler is that very high-frequency shifts (velocities) can be measured accurately because sampling is continuous. The potential disadvantage of CW Doppler is that signals from the entire length of the ultrasound beam are recorded simultaneously. However, even with overlap of flow data, a given signal often is characteristic in timing, shape, and direction, thus allowing correct identification of the origin of the signal. In some cases, other methods (e.g., 2D, color, pulsed Doppler) must be used to determine the depth of origin of the Doppler signal.

CW Doppler optimally is performed with a dedicated, nonimaging transducer with two crystals. This type of transducer has a high signal-to-noise ratio and a small footprint, allowing it to fit into small acoustic windows (e.g., between ribs) and to be angled to obtain a parallel intercept angle between the ultrasound beam and the direction of blood flow. Use of a simultaneous imaging transducer is helpful in some cases, but signal quality is poorer, angulation is more difficult, and the 2D image distracts the operator from optimizing the *flow* signal instead of the anatomic image (which often do not coincide).

Careful technique yields a Doppler spectral signal that has a smooth contour with a well-defined edge and maximum velocity, as well as with clearly defined onset and end of flow. The audible signal is tonal and smooth. A CW Doppler velocity curve is "filled in" because lower-velocity signals proximal and distal to the point of maximum velocity also are recorded. Although the maximum frequency shift depends on the intercept angle between the Doppler beam and the flow of interest, amplitude (gray-scale intensity), shape, and audible quality are less dependent on intercept angle. Thus a "good-quality" Doppler signal recorded at a nonparallel intercept angle results in underestimation of flow velocity. The empirical method to ensure a parallel intercept angle is to examine the flow of interest from multiple windows with transducer angulation both in the plane of view and in the elevational plane to discover the highest-frequency shift. The highest value found is then assumed to represent a parallel intercept angle.

### *Pulsed-Wave Doppler Ultrasound*

Pulsed Doppler echocardiography allows sampling of blood flow velocities from a specific intracardiac depth. A pulse of ultrasound is transmitted, and then, after

![](_page_19_Figure_3.jpeg)

<span id="page-19-0"></span>**Fig. 1.20 Pulsed Doppler ultrasound.** The pulsed Doppler transducer goes through a repetitive cycle of transmission of an ultrasound pulse at the transducer frequency *(FT),* a waiting period determined by the time needed for the signal to travel to and from the depth of interest, and a receive phase when the backscattered signals are sampled. The travel-time duration determines sample volume *(SV)* depth. The duration of the receive phase determines sample volume. *PFR,* Pulse-repetition frequency.

a time interval determined by the depth of interest, the transducer briefly "samples" the backscattered signals. This transducer cycle of transmit-wait-receive is repeated at an interval termed the *pulse repetition frequency* ([Fig. 1.20\)](#page-19-0). Because the "wait" interval is determined by the depth of interest—the time it takes ultrasound to travel to and from this depth—each transducer cycle is longer for increasing depths. Thus the PRF also is depth dependent, being high at shallow depths and low for more distant sites.

The pulsed Doppler depth of interest is called the *sample volume* because signals from a small volume of blood are sampled, with the width and height of this volume dependent on beam geometry. The length of the sample volume can be varied by adjusting the length of the transducer "receive" interval. Typically, a sample volume length of 3 mm is used to balance range resolution and signal quality, but a longer (5–10 mm) or shorter (1–2 mm) sample volume is useful in specific cases.

Because pulsed Doppler echocardiography repeatedly samples the returning signal, a maximum limit to the frequency shift (or velocity) can be measured unambiguously. A waveform must be sampled at least twice in each cycle for accurate determination of wavelength. This phenomenon of ambiguity in the speed, direction, or speed and direction of the sampled signal is known as *signal aliasing* ([Fig. 1.21\)](#page-19-1). For the frequency of an ultrasound waveform to be correctly identified, it must be sampled at least twice per wavelength. Thus the maximum detectable frequency shift (the *Nyquist limit*) is one-half the PRF.

If the velocity of interest exceeds the Nyquist limit by a small degree, signal aliasing is seen with the signal cut off at the edge of the display and the "top" of the waveform appearing in the reverse channel

![](_page_19_Figure_9.jpeg)

<span id="page-19-1"></span>**Fig. 1.21 Principle of signal aliasing.** This schematic diagram shows how sampling at a constant interval (shown by vertical gray lines with a red dot where the waveform is sampled) results in ambiguity in the measured sound wave frequency. Sampling at twice the frequency of the wavelength, as shown at the top, correctly measures the sound wave frequency. As the sound wave frequency increases from top to bottom, intermittent sampling results in apparent frequencies that are lower and in the opposite direction of the actual sound waveform.

[\(Fig. 1.22\)](#page--1-59). In these cases, baseline shift (in effect, an electronic "cut and paste") restores the expected velocity curve and allows calculation of maximum velocity. When velocities further exceed the Nyquist limit, repeat "wraparound" of the signal occurs first into the reverse channel, then back to the forward channel, and so on. Occasionally, the shape of the waveform can be discerned, but more often only an undifferentiated band of velocity signals can be appreciated. Both nonlaminar disturbed flow and aliased laminar high-velocity flow appear (and sound) similar on spectral analysis. Methods that can be used to resolve aliasing include:

- Using CW Doppler ultrasound
- Increasing the PRF to the maximum for that depth (the Nyquist limit)
- Increasing the number of sample volumes (high-PRF Doppler)
- Using a lower-frequency transducer
- Shifting the baseline to the edge of the display

**Fig. 1.22 Pulsed Doppler signal aliasing.** The velocity of LV outflow recorded from an apical approach exceeds the Nyquist limit so that aliasing occurs *(left)* with the appearance of the peak of the outflow curve in the reverse channel *(arrow).* This degree of aliasing can be resolved by shifting the baseline *(right),* in effect an electronic "cut and paste" of the spectral display.

CW Doppler is the most reliable approach to resolving aliasing for very high velocities. The other approaches are useful when the aliased velocity exceeds the Nyquist limit by a modest degree (e.g., up to twice the Nyquist limit).

High-PRF Doppler is the deliberate use of range ambiguity to increase the maximum velocity that can be measured with pulsed Doppler echocardiography [\(Fig. 1.23](#page--1-60)). When the transducer sends out a pulse, backscattered signals from the entire length of the ultrasound beam return to the transducer. Range resolution is achieved by sampling only those signals in the short time interval corresponding to the depth of interest. However, signals from exactly twice as far away as the sample volume will reach the transducer during the "receive" phase of the next cycle. Thus signals from "harmonics" at 2×, 3×, 4×, and so on from the sample volume depth have the potential of being analyzed. Usually signal strength is low, and few moving scatterers are present at these depths, so this range ambiguity can be ignored. If, instead, the sample volume is placed purposely at one-half the depth of interest, backscattered signals from this sample volume (*SV1*) and a second sample volume (*SV2*) twice as far away (i.e., the depth of interest) will return to the transducer during the "receive" phase (albeit one cycle later). This recording of the signal of interest at a higher PRF allows measurement of higher velocities without signal aliasing [\(Fig. 1.24](#page--1-61)). An even higher PRF can be achieved by using additional (three or four) proximal sample volumes. Of course, the limitation of this approach is range ambiguity. The spectral analysis now includes signals from each of the sample volume depths and, as with CW Doppler, the origin of the signal of interest must be determined based on ancillary data. However, high-PRF Doppler is useful for evaluation of

![](_page_20_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Fig. 1.23 High–pulserepetition frequency Doppler ultrasound.** This technique is based on the concept that with a given sample volume depth *(SV1),* some ultrasound will penetrate beyond that depth. Backscattered signals from exactly twice the set depth *(SV2)* will return to the transducer *(T)* during the receive phase of the next cycle. Thus signals from both sample volume depths are recorded simultaneously.

velocities just above the aliasing limit of conventional pulsed Doppler. Often, the high PRF mode is automatically enabled when the Doppler velocity range is increased.

#### *Doppler Velocity Instrument Controls*

Pulsed and CW Doppler instrument controls typically include:

- Power output—adjusts the amount of electrical energy transmitted to the transducer
- Receiver gain—changes the degree of amplification of returning signals
- "Wall" or high-pass filters—eliminate lowfrequency Doppler shifts that result from motion

![](_page_21_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 1.24 Example of high–pulse repetition frequency Doppler.** In this case, LV outflow velocity exceeds twice the Nyquist limit so that aliasing persists even after baseline shift *(left).* The "wrapped around" peak velocity is clearly seen *(arrow).* With this Doppler technique, the maximum velocity is resolved in this patient with a subaortic membrane *(right).*

- of myocardium and valves (allowing only the higher frequencies to pass the filter)
- Baseline shift—moves the zero line toward the top or bottom of the display
- Velocity range—increases or decreases the scale (within the limits for each Doppler modality)
- Dynamic range—compresses the signal amplitude into shades of gray

In addition, pulsed Doppler controls include:

- Sample volume depth
- Sample volume length
- The number of sample volumes (high-PRF Doppler echocardiography)

Each of the three major Doppler modalities may be integrated with 2D imaging. However, although color Doppler flow imaging is nearly always conjoined with 2D imaging, pulsed Doppler signal quality is optimized when the 2D image is "frozen," and CW Doppler is optimized using a dedicated, small-footprint transducer with no 2D imaging.

# *Doppler Velocity Data Artifacts*

Many Doppler artifacts are related to ultrasound physics and beam geometry, analogous to those seen with 2D imaging. Others are specific to Doppler echocardiography ([Table 1.7\)](#page--1-62).

Clinically, the most important potential artifact is *velocity underestimation* resulting from a nonparallel intercept angle between the ultrasound beam and the direction of blood flow [\(Fig. 1.25\)](#page--1-63). Velocity underestimation can occur with either pulsed or CW Doppler techniques and is of most concern when measuring high-velocity jets due to valve stenosis, regurgitation, or other intracardiac abnormalities.

With pulsed Doppler echocardiography, *signal aliasing* limits the maximum measurable velocity. If the examiner recognizes that aliasing has occurred, appropriate steps can be taken to resolve the velocity data if needed. Aliasing can be due to nonlaminar disturbed flow, as well as high-velocity laminar flow.

*Range ambiguity* is inherent to CW Doppler but can occur with pulsed Doppler as well. With a sample volume positioned close to the transducer, strong signals from twice (or three times) the depth of the sample volume will be received in the next "receive"

![](_page_22_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 1.25 Effect of intercept angle on velocity calculations.** The importance of a parallel intercept angle between the ultrasound beam and direction of blood flow is shown. The cosine function versus intercept angle (horizontal axis) varies from 1 at a parallel angle (0° and 180°) to 0 at a perpendicular angle (90°). The error with a nonparallel intercept angle varies from only 6% at a 20° angle to 50% at a 60° angle. At a perpendicular (90°) intercept angle, no blood flow velocities are recorded.

phase and may be misinterpreted as originating from the set sample volume depth. For example, in an apical four-chamber view, placement of a sample volume in the LV apex at one-half the distance to the mitral annulus results in a spectral display showing the inflow signal across the mitral valve from the "second" sample volume depth. This phenomenon of range ambiguity is used constructively in the high-PRF Doppler mode.

*Beam width* (and side or grating lobes) affects the Doppler signal, as occurs with 2D imaging, and results in superimposition of spatially adjacent flow signals on the spectral display. For example, LV outflow and inflow often are seen on the same recording, especially with CW Doppler. Similarly, the LV inflow signal can be superimposed on the aortic regurgitant jet [\(Fig. 1.26](#page--1-64)).

*A mirror-image artifact* is common with spectral analysis, appearing as a symmetric signal of somewhat less intensity than the actual flow signal in the opposite flow direction [\(Fig. 1.27](#page--1-65)). Mirroring often can be reduced or eliminated by decreasing the power output or gain of the instrument. Interrogation of a flow signal from a near-perpendicular angle also can result in flow signals on both sides of the baseline.

*Electronic interference* appears as a band of signals across the spectral display that partially obscure the flow signals. These artifacts are the result of inadequate shielding of other electric instruments in the examination environment and are particularly common during studies in the intensive care unit, interventional procedure areas, or operating room.

The *transit time effect* is the change in propagation speed that occurs as an ultrasound wave passes through a moving medium, such as blood. This phenomenon is separate from the Doppler effect (which affects the backscattered signal) and is the basis of volume flow measurement with a transit-time flow probe. On the

**Fig. 1.26 Doppler beam width artifact.** This CW Doppler recording from an apical window shows superimposed signals of aortic regurgitation *(AR)* and LV inflow in diastole because the width of the ultrasound beam encompasses both flows. Bright lines caused by motion of prosthetic mitral valve disks also are seen *(short arrow). AS,* Aortic stenosis.

spectral display, the transit-time effect results in a slight broadening of the velocity range at a given time point ("blurring" on the vertical axis), which potentially can result in slight overestimation of velocity.

# Color Doppler Flow Imaging

# *Principles*

Doppler color flow imaging is based on the principles of pulsed Doppler echocardiography. However, rather than one sample volume depth along the ultrasound beam, multiple sample volumes are evaluated along each sampling line [\(Fig. 1.28\)](#page--1-66). By combining data from adjacent lines, a 2D image of intracardiac flow is generated.

![](_page_23_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 1.27 Mirror-image Doppler artifact.** A mirror-image Doppler artifact with apparent weaker flow signals in the reverse channel *(arrow).*

![](_page_23_Figure_5.jpeg)

**Fig. 1.28 Color Doppler flow imaging.** *(Left)* With pulsed Doppler, the sample volume depth is determined by the time needed for ultrasound to travel to and from the depth of interest. *(Right)* With color flow imaging, multiple sample volume "gates" along each scan line are interrogated, with this process repeated for scan lines across the 2D image.

Along each scan line, a pulse of ultrasound is transmitted, and then the backscattered signals are received from each depth along that scan line [\(Table](#page--1-55) [1.8](#page--1-55)). To calculate accurate velocity data, several bursts along each scan line are used—typically eight—which is known as the *burst length* [\(Fig. 1.29\)](#page--1-67). The PRF, as for conventional pulsed Doppler, is determined by the maximum depth of the Doppler signals. Signals from the eight sampling bursts at each position are analyzed to obtain mean velocity estimates for each depth along the scan line. Velocities are displayed using a color scale showing flow toward the transducer in red and flow away from the transducer in blue, with the shade of color indicating velocity up to the Nyquist limit. The option of displaying "variance" allows an additional color (usually green) to be added to indicate variability in the estimated mean velocity for the eight bursts along that sample line, thus indicating either a flow disturbance or aliasing of a high-velocity signal. This process is repeated for each adjacent scan line across the image plane. Because each of these processes takes a finite amount of time depending on the speed of sound in tissue, the rapidity with which this image can be updated (the frame rate) depends on a combination of these factors.

# *Color Doppler Instrument Controls*

The color flow display depends on each specific ultrasound instrument to some extent. However, many parameters are adjustable by the operator, so an optimal examination requires careful attention to instrument settings.

The *color flow map* usually can be varied in terms of:

- Color scale (assignment of colors to direction and velocity)
- Velocity range (within the Nyquist limit at that depth)
- Zero baseline position on the color scale
- Addition of variance to the color scale

The specific color scale used is a matter of personal preference, with the diagnostic goal being to optimize the display and recognition of abnormal flow patterns.

The *velocity range* of the color flow map is determined by the Nyquist limit, and as for conventional pulsed Doppler, the range can be altered by shifting the zero baseline, changing the pulse repetition frequency, or altering the depth of the displayed image. In addition, the velocity range can be set at a value lower than the Nyquist limit to enhance visualization of low-velocity flows, such as pulmonary venous inflow.

Color Doppler *power output* and *gain* are adjusted so that gain is just below the level at which random background noise appears. "Wall filters" can be varied to exclude low-velocity signals from the color flow display. In addition, many instruments allow variation in the assignment of a returning signal to 2D or Doppler display (depending on signal strength). One approach to optimizing the color flow display is to reduce the 2D gain because the instrument does not display flow data on top of "structures," even when the 2D signal is due to excessive gain.

Perhaps the most important technical factor in color flow imaging is optimization of *frame rate.* Color flow frame rate depends on sector width, depth, pulse repetition frequency, and the number of samples per sector line. The examiner optimizes frame rate by

focusing on the flow of interest, narrowing the sector, and decreasing the depth as much as possible ([Fig.](#page--1-68) [1.30\)](#page--1-68). When frame rate remains inadequate for timing flow abnormalities, a color M-line through the area of interest often is helpful (e.g., in assessment of aortic regurgitation).

### *Color Doppler Imaging Artifacts*

Color flow artifacts again relate to the physics of 2D and Doppler flow image generation [\(Table 1.9](#page--1-69)). *Shadowing* is prominent distal to strong reflectors with absence of both 2D and flow data within the acoustic shadow.

*Ghosting* is the appearance of brief (usually one or two frames), large color patterns that overlie anatomic structures and do not correspond to underlying flow patterns. This artifact is caused by strong moving reflectors (e.g., prosthetic valve disks). Typically, this artifact is solid red or blue and is inconsistent from beat to beat.

Note that at a depth of 16 cm, a frame rate 20 or greater can be achieved only by decreasing the burst length to 4 or narrowing the sector to 30 scan lines.

Color Doppler gain settings have a dramatic effect on the color flow image. Extensive gain settings result in a uniform speckled pattern across the 2D image plane resulting from random *background noise.* Conversely, too low a gain setting results in a smaller displayed flow area than is actually present, an effect colloquially known as "dial-a-jet." Most experienced echocardiographers recommend setting the gain level just below the level of random background noise to optimize the flow signal.

**Fig. 1.31 Effect of intercept angle on the color Doppler flow display.** In this TEE long-axis image of the descending thoracic aorta, flow in systole goes from right to left across the image plane as shown by the *arrow*. However, flow on the right side of the image appears red (because flow is directed toward the transducer), and flow on the left side of the image appears blue (because flow is directed away from the transducer), with a black area in the center of the image where the ultrasound beam is perpendicular to flow.

As for any Doppler technique, the *intercept angle* between the ultrasound beam and direction of blood flow *for each scan line* affects the color display in terms of both direction and velocity. Thus a uniform flow velocity traversing the image plane appears red (toward the transducer) at one side of the sector and blue (away from the transducer) at the other edge of the sector, with a black area in the center where the flow direction is perpendicular to the ultrasound beam [\(Fig. 1.31](#page--1-70)).

Flow velocities that exceed the Nyquist limit at any given depth result in *signal aliasing.* Aliasing on color flow results in "wraparound" of the velocity signal, similar to that seen on a spectral display, so

**Fig. 1.32 Signal aliasing with color Doppler flow imaging.** A normal LV inflow signal *(top)* shows aliasing from red to blue at the mitral annulus level because the velocity exceeds the Nyquist limit of 69 cm/s. *Ao,* Aorta.

an aliased velocity toward the transducer (should be red) appears to be traveling away from the transducer (displayed in blue). Aliasing on color flow images is very common; for example, the LV inflow stream appears red and then blue (due to aliasing) in the apical view [\(Fig. 1.32\)](#page--1-71). Color aliasing can be used to advantage to quantitate flow based on the proximal isovelocity surface area method described in Chapter 12. In some cases, aliasing results in a variance display (due to an apparent range of velocities at that site), a finding emphasizing that a variance display does not always indicate disturbed flow.

*Electronic interference* on color flow displays is instrument dependent. As with other electric interference artifacts, it is most likely to occur in settings where numerous other instruments or devices are in use (e.g., operating room, intensive care unit). Sometimes it appears as a linear multicolored band on the image along a few scan lines; sometimes more complex patterns are seen. Caution is needed because sometimes electronic interference results in suppression of the color flow signal. This artifact can be recognized by the absence of normal antegrade flow patterns.

# Tissue Doppler

The Doppler principle also can be used to measure motion of the myocardium using either pulsed Doppler with a sample volume at a specific site in the myocardium or color Doppler to display myocardium motion in the entire image plane. The basic principles of Doppler ultrasound also apply to tissue Doppler. Tissue Doppler signals are very high amplitude, so power output and gain settings are low, whereas tissue Doppler velocities are very low, so the velocity range is small. (See Chapter 4 for details).

Both pulsed and color tissue Doppler velocities are angle dependent, showing motion toward and away from the transducer. Pulsed tissue Doppler uses a spectral display, allowing accurate measurement of velocity data. The color tissue Doppler display, like other color Doppler images, displays mean velocities for the component of motion toward and away from the transducer. The derivation of strain rate and strain from tissue Doppler data is discussed in Chapter 4.

# BIOEFFECTS AND SAFETY

The use of ultrasound for diagnostic cardiac imaging has no known adverse biologic effects. However, ultrasound waves do have the potential to cause significant bioeffects depending on the intensity of exposure. Thus the physician and the cardiac sonographer must be aware of potential bioeffects in assessing the overall safety of the procedure.

# Bioeffects

Ultrasound bioeffects [\(Table 1.10\)](#page--1-40) can be divided into three basic categories:

- Thermal effects
- Cavitation
- Other (such as torque forces and micro streaming)

Thermal effects predominate with diagnostic ultrasound examinations. As the ultrasound wave passes through a tissue, heating occurs because of absorption of the mechanical energy of the sound wave. The rate of increase in temperature *dT/dt* depends on the absorption coefficient of the tissue for a given frequency α, the density ρ, and specific heat *Cm* of the tissue and the intensity *I* of ultrasound exposure:

$$dT/dt = 2\alpha I/\rho C_m$$
 (Eq. 1.10)

Increases in temperature as a result of ultrasound exposure are offset by heat loss because of blood flow through the tissue (convective loss) and heat diffusion. Denser tissues (e.g., bone) heat more rapidly than less dense tissue (e.g., fat). However, the actual elevation in temperature for a specific tissue is difficult to predict both because of the complexity of the entire biologic system and because it is difficult to assess the intensity of exposure accurately. In addition, the actual degree of tissue heating depends on transducer frequency, focus, power output, depth, perfusion, and tissue density.

*Cavitation* is the creation or vibration of small, gas-filled bodies by the ultrasound beam. Cavitation tends to occur only with higher-intensity exposures.

Microbubbles resonate (expand and decrease in size) depending on their dimension in relation to the sound wave, with a resonance frequency *F*0 defined by the radius of the microbubble (*R*0 in microns):

$$F_0 = 3260/R_0$$
 (Eq. 1.11)

Microbubbles also can be created by ultrasound by expansion of small cavitation nuclei. Cavitation has not been shown to occur with ultrasound exposure because of diagnostic ultrasound systems. However, this effect is more important when gas-filled bodies are introduced into the ultrasound field, such as with the use of contrast echocardiography.

Other ultrasound bioeffects occur only with much higher exposures than occur with diagnostic ultrasound. These effects include micro streaming, torque forces, and other complex biologic effects.

### Safety

The intensity *(I)* of ultrasound exposure can be expressed in several ways. The most commonly used unit of measure of intensity is power per area, where power is energy over a specific time interval:

$$I = power/area = watt/cm^2$$
 (Eq. 1.12)

The maximum overall intensity is then described as the highest exposure within the beam (spatial peak) averaged over the period of exposure (temporal average) and is known as the *spatial peak temporal average*  *(SPTA) intensity.* Another common measure is the *spatial peak pulse average (SPPA),* defined as the average pulse intensity at the spatial location where the pulse intensity is maximum. The Food and Drug Administration provides two maximum allowed limits for *I*SPTA for cardiac applications: a regulated application-specific limit of 430 mW/cm2 .

A major limitation of measuring the intensity of ultrasound exposure is that although measuring the *output* of the transducer is straightforward (e.g., in a water bath), estimating the actual tissue *exposure* is more difficult due to attenuation and other interactions with the tissue. Furthermore, tissue exposure is limited only to transmission periods, as reflected in the duty factor, and the time the ultrasound beam dwells at a specific point, both of which are considerably shorter than the total examination time. Other indices that incorporate these factors have been developed to define the exposure levels with diagnostic ultrasound more clearly. These measures include the thermal index (TI) and the mechanical index (MI).

The soft tissue TI is based on the ratio of transmitted acoustic power to the power needed to raise tissue temperature by 1°C:

$$TI = W_p / W_{deg}$$
 (Eq. 1.13)

where Wp is a power parameter calculated from output power and acoustic attenuation, and Wdeg is the estimated power needed to increase the tissue temperature by 1°C. Different TIs used for bone and cranial bone are less relevant for cardiac ultrasound.

The MI describes the nonthermal effects of ultrasound (cavitation and other effects) as the ratio of peak rarefactional pressure and the square root of transducer frequency, with the specific definition:

$$MI = [\rho_{r.3}/(f_c^{\frac{1}{2}})]/C_{MI}$$
 (Eq. 1.14)

Where CMI equals 1 Mpa MHz − 1 <sup>2</sup> , ρr.3 is the attenuated peak-rarefactional pressure in megapascals, and *f*c is the center frequency of the transducer in MHz.

An MI or TI less than 1 is generally considered safe; higher numbers indicate a higher probability of a biologic effect. These indexes are displayed only on instruments capable of exceeding an MI or TI of 1. With a higher index, the potential risks of ultrasound exposure must be balanced against the benefits of the diagnostic examination ([Fig. 1.33](#page-28-0)). The thermal index is most important with Doppler and color flow imaging, whereas the MI is most important with 2D imaging.

Although no known risks are associated with the diagnostic use of cardiac ultrasound imaging in adults, a prudent approach is to:

- Perform echocardiography only when indicated clinically (see Chapter 5), as part of an approved research protocol, or in appropriate teaching settings.
- Know the power output and exposure intensity of different modalities (imaging and Doppler) of each instrument.
- Limit the power output and exposure time as much as possible within the constraints of acquiring the necessary information.
- Keep up to date on any new scientific findings or data relating to possible adverse effects.

These principles are summarized by the acronym ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) with the core concepts of using ultrasound only when indicated and minimizing both exposure time and intensity.
