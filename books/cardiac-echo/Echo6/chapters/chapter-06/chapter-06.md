he degree of ventricular systolic dysfunction is a potent predictor of clinical outcome for a wide range of cardiovascular disease, including ischemic cardiac disease, cardiomyopathies, valvular heart disease, and congenital heart disease. Echocardiographic estimates of global and regional function, quantitative ventricular volumes and ejection fractions, and Doppler echocardiographic ejection phase indices all are valuable clinical tools. Even when evaluation of ventricular systolic function is not the primary focus of the echocardiographic examination, evaluation of ventricular systolic function is a key component of every clinical study. For research applications, echocardiographic measures of left ventricular (LV) systolic function provide important baseline data on disease severity and clinical endpoints for intervention trials in patients with ventricular dysfunction.

## <span id="page-0-1"></span>Cardiac Cycle

Systole is defined as the segment of the cardiac cycle from mitral valve closure to aortic valve closure ([Fig.](#page--1-41) [6.1](#page--1-41)). The onset of systole is identified on the electrocardiogram as ventricular depolarization (onset of the QRS complex), with the end of systole occurring after repolarization (end of T wave). In terms of ventricular pressure curves over time, systole begins when LV pressure exceeds left atrial (LA) pressure, resulting in closure of the mitral valve. Mitral valve closure is followed by isovolumic contraction, during which the cardiac muscle depolarizes, calcium influx and myosin-actin shortening occur, and ventricular pressure rises rapidly at a constant ventricular volume

**Fig. 6.1 The cardiac cycle.** LV, aortic *(Ao),* and LA pressures are shown with the corresponding Doppler LV outflow and inflow-velocity curves. The isovolumic contraction time *(IVCT)* represents the time between mitral valve closure and aortic valve opening, whereas the isovolumic relaxation time *(IVRT)* represents the time between aortic valve closure and mitral valve opening.

(although shape changes do occur). When ventricular pressure exceeds aortic pressure, the aortic valve opens. During ejection (aortic valve opening to closing), LV volume falls rapidly as blood flows from the LV to the aorta. LV pressure exceeds aortic pressure for approximately the first half of systole, corresponding to a rapid acceleration of blood flow and a small pressure difference from the ventricle to the aorta. In the normal heart, pressure crossover occurs in mid-systole, so during the second half of systole, aortic pressure exceeds LV pressure, thus resulting in continued forward blood flow but at progressively slower velocities (deceleration). Aortic valve closure occurs at the dicrotic notch of the aortic pressure tracing, immediately following end-ejection. In sum, systole includes isovolumic contraction and ventricular ejection (acceleration and deceleration phases). Ventricular volume ranges from a maximum at end-diastole (or onset of systole) to a minimum at end-systole.

## Physiology of Systolic Function

During systole, ventricular myocardial fibers contract circumferentially and longitudinally, resulting in myocardial wall thickening and inward motion of the endocardium. The simultaneous decrease in ventricular size and increase in pressure result in ejection of a volume of blood (stroke volume) from the ventricle.

![](_page_1_Figure_8.jpeg)

**Fig. 6.2 Pressure-volume loop.** LV volume is graphed on the horizontal axis, with pressure on the vertical axis. The temporal direction of pressurevolume changes is shown by the *arrows*. During diastole, volume increases with little rise in pressure. After mitral valve *(MV)* closure, isovolumic contraction *(IVC)* results in a rapid rise in pressure with no change in volume. At the onset of ejection, the aortic valve *(AoV)* opens with a rapid decrease in LV volume during systole. Aortic valve closure is followed by isovolumic relaxation *(IVR).*

Stroke volume reflects the *pump performance* of the heart. The decrease in chamber volume relative to end-diastolic volume, or ejection fraction, reflects overall *ventricular function*. Ventricular function and pump performance depend on:

- Contractility (the basic ability of the myocardium to contract)
- Preload (initial ventricular volume or pressure)
- Afterload (aortic resistance or end-systolic wall stress)
- Ventricular geometry

*Contractility* is the intrinsic ability of the myocardium to contract, independent of loading conditions or geometry. Evaluation of contractility itself thus requires measurement of ventricular ejection performance under different loading conditions. Experimentally, contractility often is described by the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (*E*max). To derive this value, LV pressure is graphed on the vertical axis, with volume (not time) on the horizontal axis ([Fig.](#page--1-42) [6.2](#page--1-42)). This pressure-volume "loop" then represents a single cardiac cycle, with different pressure-volume loops for the same ventricle representing different loading conditions (e.g., increasing or decreasing ventricular end-diastolic volume or changing afterload). *E*max is the slope of the line that intersects the endsystolic pressure-volume point for each curve. A decrease in contractility results in a decrease in stroke volume and larger LV volumes ([Fig. 6.3\)](#page--1-43). Contractility itself can be affected by several physiologic parameters including heart rate, coupling interval, and metabolic factors, in addition to disease processes and pharmacologic agents.

Fig. 6.3 Effect of changes in contractility on left ventricular pressurevolume loops. A normal ventricle is shown in yellow and an acute decrease in contractile state in pink. The slope of the line intersecting the end-systolic pressure-volume (P-V) points at different loading conditions, shown as a green line for each P-V loop, is a measure of contractility known as elastance  $(E_{max})$ , which is insensitive to changes in loading conditions. With decreased contractility, the P-V loop is displaced to the right, and the end-systolic P-V line shifts downward and to the right. The effect of an acute increase in contractile state is illustrated by the line on the left; the slope of the end-systolic P-V line is increased (the corresponding loop is not shown). (From Aurigemma GP, Gaasch WH, Villegas B, et al: Noninvasive assessment of left ventricular mass, chamber volume, and contractile function. Curr Probl Cardiol 20:418, 1995.)

The effect of preload on ventricular ejection performance is summarized by the Frank-Starling curve showing ventricular end-diastolic volume (or pressure) on the horizontal axis and stroke volume on the vertical axis (Fig. 6.4). For a given degree of contractility, a curvilinear relationship exists between these variables such that increasing end-diastolic volume results in a greater stroke volume. An increase in contractility results in a greater increase in stroke volume for a given increase in preload; a decrease in contractility has the opposite effect.

Afterload, defined by resistance or impedance, has an inverse relationship with myocardial fiber shortening such that increasing vascular resistance results in a decreased stroke volume (see Fig. 6.4). An increase in contractility allows maintenance of a normal stroke volume with a higher afterload. With a decrease in contractility, even slight increases in afterload further decrease myocardial fiber shortening and stroke volume.

Measurement of LV systolic function independent of loading conditions is difficult using echocardiographic or other clinical approaches. It rarely is possible to construct pressure-volume loops under different loading conditions because of the problem of measuring instantaneous LV volumes and the potential risk of altering loading conditions in ill patients. Thus clinical evaluation of ventricular function

Fig. 6.4 Preload and afterload. (Top) The relationship between preload, often defined by end-diastolic volume (EDV), and stroke volume (SV) is shown for a normal (blue line) LV. With increased contractility, one sees a greater increase in SV for an increase in EDV (red line); with decreased contractility, one sees a smaller increase in SV for an increase in EDV (green dashed line). (Bottom) The inverse relationship between afterload, approximated by blood pressure (BP) or systemic vascular resistance, and LV myocardial shortening velocity is shown for a normal ventricle (blue line). With increased contractility, shortening velocity (and stroke volume) can be maintained at higher afterloads (red line); with decreased contractility, shortening velocity is lower for any given afterload (green dashed line).

has focused on measurements of cardiac output, ejection fraction, and end-systolic dimension or volume, even though the load dependence of these measures is a clearly acknowledged limitation. Strain and strain rate measurements offer another approach to evaluation of ventricular function and are becoming more widely used.

#### Ventricular Volumes and Geometry

The normal shape of the LV is symmetric, with two relatively equal short axes and with the long axis running from the base (mitral annulus) to the apex. In long-axis views, the apex is slightly rounded, so the apical half of the ventricle resembles a hemiellipse. The basal half of the ventricle is more cylindrical,

so the ventricle appears circular in short-axis views. Various assumptions about LV shape have been used to derive formulas for calculating ventricular volumes from linear dimensions (M-mode) and cross-sectional areas (two-dimensional [2D] echo). Formulas using linear or cross-sectional measurements are simplifications to greater or lesser degrees, and variability exists among patients in the shape of the ventricle. Calculation of LV size from three-dimensional (3D) images avoids inaccuracy related to geometric assumptions.

#### ECHO MATH: Stroke Volume and Ejection Fraction

Although instantaneous ventricular volumes throughout the cardiac cycle are of interest, usually only enddiastolic volume (EDV) and end-systolic volume (ESV) are measured in the clinical setting.

Stroke volume (SV) is calculated as:

<span id="page-3-1"></span>
$$SV = EDV - ESV (Eq. 6.1)$$

with cardiac output obtained by multiplying stroke volume by heart rate.

Ejection fraction (EF) is:

<span id="page-3-0"></span>
$$EF(\%) = (SV/EDV) \times 100\%$$
 (Eq. 6.2)

For example, if EDV is 106 mL and ESV is 62 mL, stroke volume and ejection fraction are:

$$SV = EDV - ESV = 44 \text{ mL}$$

$$EF = [(EDV - ESV)/EDV] \times 100\%$$
$$= (106 - 62)/106 \times 100\% = 42\%$$

## Cardiac Output

The basic function of the heart is as a pump, so measurements of cardiac output are useful in routine day-to-day patient management. Cardiac output is the volume of blood pumped by the heart per minute, with stroke volume being the amount pumped on a single beat. Although cardiac output can be derived from ventricular volumes, as described earlier, various other approaches to measurement are available, including right heart catheterization with indicator dilation methods (Fick, thermodilution); inert gas rebreathing approaches; angiographic, radionuclide, or cardiac magnetic resonance) ventricular volumes; and cardiac magnetic resonance or Doppler flowvelocity methods.

## Response to Exercise

Ventricular systolic function and cardiac output are dynamic, responding rapidly to the metabolic demands of the individual. Cardiac output increases from a mean of 6 L/min at rest to 18 L/min with exercise in young, healthy adults. Most of this increase in cardiac output is mediated by an increase in heart rate. With supine exercise, only a minimal increase in stroke volume (about 10%) occurs, whereas with upright exercise, the increase in stroke volume is approximately 20% to 35%. With exercise, enddiastolic volume is unchanged or slightly decreased, but ejection fraction increases and end-systolic volume decreases. With imaging techniques, endocardial motion and myocardial wall thickening are augmented, with an appearance of "hypercontractility" during and immediately following exercise.

## IMAGING THE LEFT VENTRICLE

## Qualitative Evaluation of Systolic Function

Both global and regional ventricular function can be evaluated with 2D echocardiography on a semiquantitative scale by an experienced observer. On transthoracic (TTE) imaging, overall LV systolic function is evaluated best from multiple tomographic planes, typically:

- Parasternal long-axis view
- Parasternal short-axis view
- Apical four-chamber view
- Apical two-chamber view
- Apical long-axis view

On transesophageal (TEE) imaging, equivalent views from a high TEE and transgastric position are used. Attention to image acquisition is needed to obtain adequate endocardial definition. 3D image acquisition from the TTE or TEE approach allows simultaneous display of two or more tomographic planes and likely will be more widely used as 3D image quality and endocardial definition are improved.

The echocardiographer then integrates the degree of endocardial motion and wall thickening from these views to classify overall systolic function as normal, mildly reduced, moderately reduced, or severely reduced. Some experienced observers can estimate ejection fraction visually from 2D images with a reasonable correlation with ejection fractions measured quantitatively by echocardiography or other techniques. Typically, ejection fraction is estimated in intervals of 5% to 10% (i.e., 20%, 30%, 40%, and so on), or an estimated ejection fraction range is reported (e.g., 20% to 30%.

Several other imaging parameters provide a qualitative measure of LV systolic function. M-mode signs include:

■ The separation between the maximum anterior motion of the anterior mitral leaflet and

- maximum posterior motion of the ventricular septum (E-point septal separation)
- The degree of anteroposterior motion of the aortic root

With normal systolic function, the anterior mitral leaflet opens to nearly fill the ventricular chamber, thus resulting in little (0 to 5 mm) E-point septal separation. With systolic dysfunction, this distance is increased because of a combination of LV dilation and reduced motion of the mitral valve as a result of low transmitral volume flow. Similarly, LV systolic dysfunction results in reduced LA filling and emptying (low cardiac output), seen on M-mode as reduced anteroposterior motion of the aortic root (see Fig. 9.5).

On 2D echocardiography, the mitral annulus moves toward the ventricular apex in systole, with the magnitude of this motion proportional to the extent of shortening in ventricular length—a useful measure of overall LV systolic function. Normal subjects have motion of the mitral annulus toward the apex ≥8 mm, with a mean value of 12 ± 2 mm in both four- and two-chamber views. The sensitivity of mitral annulus motion <8 mm is 98%, with a specificity of 82% for identification of an ejection fraction <50%.

Qualitative evaluation of overall systolic function is a simple and highly predictive index that is of great clinical utility. Conversely, several factors can limit the usefulness of this evaluation. First, the accuracy of the estimated ejection fraction is dependent on the experience of each observer. Second, inadequate endocardial definition can result in incorrect estimates of systolic function. Third, integration of data from multiple tomographic images can be difficult when the pattern of contraction is asynchronous (with conduction defects, pacers, postoperative septal motion) or when the pattern of contraction is asymmetric (with prior myocardial infarction or with ischemia), especially when dyskinesis is present. To some extent, these limitations are minimized by an experienced observer, optimal endocardial definition, use of contrast to enhance border recognition, and integration of data from multiple views. However, when possible, it is preferable to avoid the limitations of estimates of systolic function by performing quantitative measurements.

Regional ventricular function also can be evaluated by imaging in multiple tomographic planes on TTE or TEE imaging. Regional function is evaluated qualitatively by dividing the ventricle into segments corresponding to the coronary artery anatomy and then grading wall motion on a 1 to 4+ scale as normal (score = 1), hypokinetic (score = 2), akinetic (score = 3), or dyskinetic (score = 4). In some cases, hyperkinesis (i.e., a compensatory increase in wall motion in regions remote from an acute myocardial infarction or the normal increase seen with exercise) also is scored. Evaluation of segmental wall motion is discussed in detail in Chapter 8.

## Quantitative Evaluation of Systolic Function

## *Linear Dimensions*

LV internal dimensions and wall thickness are routinely measured using 2D echocardiography. Measurements of LV size are most accurate when the ultrasound beam is perpendicular to the blood-endocardium interface because of the precision of axial, compared with lateral, resolution. In some specific situations, such as serial evaluation of the patient with chronic aortic or mitral regurgitation, 2D guided M-mode measurements are recommended, particularly when identification of the endocardium is suboptimal on the 2D images [\(Table 6.1](#page--1-45)).

On a standard examination, ventricular size is measured in the parasternal long-axis view, at the level of the mitral leaflet tips (mitral chordal level), perpendicular to the long axis of the ventricle ([Fig.](#page--1-46) [6.5](#page--1-46)). Biplane imaging or scanning between the longand short-axis views is also helpful to ensure that the measurements are centered in the short-axis plane. TEE measurements of LV internal dimensions are made in a transgastric two-chamber view at the junction between the basal third and apical portion of the ventricle. Wall thickness is measured in the transgastric short-axis view. On 2D images, LV internal dimensions are measured at end-diastole and endsystole from the tissue-blood interface (white-black transition). End-diastole is defined as the onset of the QRS complex, the first frame after mitral valve closure or maximum ventricular volume. End-systole is defined as the smallest ventricular volume or the frame just after aortic valve closure.

When 2D guided M-mode measurements are used, the transducer often needs to be moved cephalad to obtain a perpendicular angle between the M-line and the long axis of the ventricle. If only an oblique orientation is possible, correctly aligned measurements should be made from the 2D image instead. The major advantage of M-mode echocardiography is high time resolution, which facilitates recognition of endocardial motion and thus a more accurate measurement of ventricular internal dimensions. On M-mode, the LV posterior wall endocardium is the most continuous line with the steepest systolic motion [\(Fig. 6.6](#page--1-47)). The posterior wall epicardium is identified as the echo reflection immediately anterior to the pericardium. The septal endocardium also shows the steepest slope in systole with a continuous reflection through the cycle. On the right ventricular (RV) side of the septum, it is important to exclude any reflections that are caused by RV trabeculations. Conversely, a dark "mid-septal" stripe often is noted and should not be confused with the endocardial borders. LV wall thickness and dimensions are measured from the leading edge to leading edge of each interface of interest for optimal measurement accuracy. For example,

ventricular internal dimensions are measured from the leading edge of the septal endocardium to the leading edge of the posterior wall endocardium. Normal values for linear ventricular dimensions depend on age and sex [\(Fig. 6.7\)](#page--1-48).

In addition to LV wall thickness and internal dimensions (LVID) at end-diastole (d) and end-systole (s), endocardial fractional shortening (FS) can be calculated as:

$$FS (\%) = (LVID_d - LVID_s)/LVID_d \times 100\%$$
 (Eq. 6.3)

Fractional shortening is a rough measurement of LV systolic function, with the normal range being about 25% to 45% (95% confidence limits). Instead of endocardial fractional shortening, as shown in [Eq.](#page--1-49) [6.3](#page--1-49), mid-wall fractional shortening is a better reflector of contractility because it reflects both the inward motion of the endocardium and the degree of wall thickening. However, mid-wall shortening calculations are rarely used in clinical practice because 2D measures of ventricular systolic function are more robust.

**Fig. 6.5 Left ventricular M-mode measurements.** LV end-diastolic dimension *(EDD)* and end-systolic dimension *(ESD)* are measured from the parasternal window. 2D measurements are made for the white-black interface of the septum to the posterior wall, while taking care to measure perpendicular to the long axis of the ventricle and centered in the short axis. Similarly, 2D-guided M-mode measurements are made after verifying that the M-line is centered in the LV in the short-axis view and perpendicular to the long axis of the LV in the long-axis view. The transducer should be in a high intercostal space to ensure that the M-line is not oblique. The high sampling rate of the M-mode recording allows more precise identification of the endocardium. *Ao,* Aorta.

end-diastole and end-systole in one or more tomographic planes on TTE or TEE images [\(Table 6.2](#page--1-50) and Appendix A, Table A.1). Prerequisites for quantitative evaluation by 2D echocardiography are:

- Nonoblique standard image planes or image planes of known orientation relative to the long and short axis of the LV
- Inclusion of the apex of the ventricle
- Adequate endocardial definition
- Accurate identification of the endocardial borders

When image quality is suboptimal, use of leftsided echo contrast improves endocardial definition. Currently, 2D or contrast-enhanced endocardial borders must be traced manually by an experienced physician or sonographer for accurate quantitation of LV systolic function. Because 2D echocardiography is a tomographic technique, LV volume calculations are based on geometric assumptions about the shape of the LV. By convention, the papillary muscles are included in the ventricular chamber, with endocardial borders extrapolated along the base of the papillary muscle, following the expected curvature of the ventricular wall. Obviously, accuracy in individual patients will be highest with methods that have the fewest geometric assumptions and that use data from multiple tomographic images (see Appendix B, Table B.1).

Several approaches for the calculation of LV volumes from tomographic data, based on different geometric assumptions, have been proposed, ranging from a simple ellipsoid shape to complex

<span id="page-8-0"></span>Fig. 6.8 2D left ventricular volume calculations. Examples of three formulas for LV volume calculations showing the 2D echocardiographic views and measurements on the left and the geometric model on the right. For the biplane apical method, endocardial borders are traced in apical fourchamber and two-chamber views, which are used to define a series of orthogonal diameters (a and b). A "Simpson's rule" assumption based on stacked disks is used to calculate volume. The single-plane ellipsoid method uses the 2D area (A) and length (L) in a single (usually apical four-chamber) view. The hemisphere-cylinder method uses a short-axis endocardial area at the midventricular level (Am) and a long-axis length (L). For each method, both end-diastolic and end-systolic measurements are needed for calculation of end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, respectively, and for ejection fraction determination.

hemicylindrical or hemiellipsoid shapes (Fig. 6.8). The most robust and practical method for clinical use is Simpson's rule or *method of disks*, which calculates ventricular volume as the sum of a series of parallel "slices" from apex to base.

LV volume = 
$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i \mathcal{T}$$
 (Eq. 6.4)

Where A is the area and T is the thickness of each of n slices. For example, if 20 disks are summated, LV volume is:

LV volume = 
$$\sum_{n=20} [A_i \times L/20]$$
 (Eq. 6.5)

This approach is recommended in consensus guidelines because it is accurate even when ventricular geometry is distorted (Table 6.3). The apical biplane approach requires tracing of endocardial borders at end-diastole and end-systole in both four-chamber and two-chamber views, from either TTE or TEE images (Fig. 6.9). These borders are then used to calculate cross-sectional areas of a series of elliptical disks. End-diastolic volume is calculated from enddiastolic images, and end-systolic volume is calculated from end-systolic images. Normal LV volumes are smaller in women compared with men and decrease with age in both sexes (Fig. 6.10). Stroke volume is the difference between end-diastolic volume (EDV) and end-systolic volume (ESV) (Eq. 6.2), whereas ejection fraction (EF) is calculated with Eq. 6.1.

When only a four-chamber view is available, a single-plane ejection fraction can be calculated that summates a series of disks with a circular cross-sectional area. Another alternative is the area-length method, which assumes that the base of the ventricle is approximated by a cylinder and the apex by an ellipsoid, sometimes called the "bullet" formula; this formula uses a long-axis length L and the crosssectional area  $A_m$  of an orthogonal short-axis view at the mid-papillary level:

LV volume = 
$$5/6 \times A_n L$$
 (Eq. 6.6)

In the presence of a distorted ventricular shape or regional wall motion abnormalities, these alternate methods are less accurate because, if the region of abnormal wall motion is included in the dimension or area measurements, volumes will be overestimated and vice versa.

3D echocardiography provides more accurate measurements of LV volumes and ejection fraction that are independent of geometric assumptions (Appendix B, Table B.2). Current instrumentation allows semiautomated border detection from the 3D volumetric data set with calculation of end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes and ejection fraction. From an apical window, the key steps in 3D data acquisition for evaluation of the LV are as follows:

- Start with 2D apical views to optimize gain settings, typically higher than for 2D imaging.
- Guide the 3D acquisition by use of a split screen display of orthogonal views of the LV.
- Acquire the 3D volume data set during a breath hold to minimize stitch artifacts.
- Consider use of contrast to opacify the LV to improve endocardial border identification.

Data are displayed as a cine loop 3D-rendered LV volume, a graph of LV volume over the cardiac cycle, and images showing regional wall motion or regional ejection fraction, depending on the specific ultrasound system (Fig. 6.11). In clinical practice, limitations of 3D evaluation of the LV include lower temporal and spatial resolution compared with 2D imaging and difficulty including the entire LV chamber within the 3D volume data set. However, 3D volumes and ejection fraction are more accurate than 2D measurements, so quantitative evaluation of LV systolic function 3D echocardiography is recommended, whenever possible.

#### *Left Ventricular Wall Stress, Strain, and Strain Rate Imaging*

Wall stress is the force per unit area exerted on the myocardium. Wall stress is dependent on:

- Cavity radius (R)
- Pressure (P), and
- Wall thickness (Th)

The basic equation for wall stress (σ) is:

$$\sigma = PR/2 \text{ Th}$$
 (Eq. 6.7)

Wall stress can be described in three dimensions as circumferential, meridional (longitudinal), or radial. End-systolic calculations of circumferential and meridional wall stress reflect ventricular afterload, whereas end-diastolic wall stress reflects preload. Both meridional and circumferential wall stress can be calculated from 2D echocardiographic measures of chamber size and wall thickness. Although the concept of wall stress is important in understanding ventricular function, especially in ventricular pressure or volume overall states (e.g., hypertension, aortic stenosis, aortic or

mitral regurgitation), wall stress calculations are not yet widely utilized in clinical practice.

#### Left Ventricular Speckle Tracking Strain Imaging

Speckle tracking strain is less load dependent compared with other echocardiographic parameters and allows detection of early LV systolic dysfunction before overt evidence of a fall in ejection fraction, as detailed in Chapter 4 (Fig. 6.12). Most often global longitudinal strain (GLS) is measured with images acquired in apical four-chamber, two-chamber, and long-axis views. Longitudinal strain is a negative number with the normal value varying among different ultrasound systems, but typically it is about 20%. Global longitudinal strain includes data from all three apical views, with results presented in a target-type color-coded chart, a graph of strain over the cardiac cycle for each myocardial wall, and a single number representing global longitudinal systolic LV function.

## Left Ventricular Geometry and Mass

LV mass is the total weight of the myocardium, derived by multiplying the volume of myocardium by the specific density of cardiac muscle. LV mass can be estimated from M-mode dimensions of septal thickness (ST), posterior wall thickness (PWT), and LV internal dimensions (LVID) at end-diastole as:

$$\begin{split} LV~mass &= 0.80\\ &\times [1.04~(ST_d + PWT_d + LVID_d)^3 - LVID_d^3]\\ &+ 0.6~g \end{split} \tag{Eq. 6.8}$$

On 2D or 3D echocardiography, LV mass theoretically can be determined by tracing epicardial borders to calculate the total ventricular volume (walls plus chamber), subtracting the volumes determined from endocardial border tracing, and then multiplying by the specific density of myocardium:

$$LV mass = 1.05 (total volume - chamber volume)$$
 (Eq. 6.9)

However, epicardial definition rarely is adequate for this approach. Instead, mean wall thickness is calculated from epicardial  $(A_1)$  and endocardial  $(A_2)$  cross-sectional areas in a short-axis view at the papillary muscle level. LV mass measurements often are indexed for body size (either as body surface area or height)

The maximum strain is used to determine the valve displayed of −8.5%. *(Bottom)* The target diagram integrates strain data from multiple image planes with the apex in the center and the base around the edges of the circle. In this example, apical strain has a large absolute value indicating better systolic function than basal segments.

using sex-specific normal values (see Appendix A, Table A.2).

*Relative wall thickness* is a simpler measure of ventricular geometry in patients with hypertrophy that reflects the relative thickness of the walls compared with chamber size. Relative wall thickness (RWT) is calculated from posterior wall thickness (PWT) and LV internal dimension (LVID), both at end-diastole, as:

$$RWT = 2PWT_d/LVID_d \qquad \text{(Eq. 6.10)}$$

Ventricular geometry can be classified based on relative wall thickness (normal <0.42) and LV mass as:

- Normal geometry—Normal LV mass and normal relative wall thickness
- Concentric hypertrophy—Increased LV mass and increased relative wall thickness
- Eccentric hypertrophy—Increased LV mass with normal relative wall thickness
- Concentric remodeling—Normal LV mass with increased relative wall thickness

Concentric hypertrophy is typical of ventricular pressure overload caused by aortic stenosis with a small chamber and thick walls, whereas eccentric hypertrophy is typical of chronic volume overload caused by aortic regurgitation with a dilated chamber with normal wall thickness but an increased total weight of the ventricle. Hypertensive heart disease most often results in concentric remodeling with a normal total ventricular weight but walls that are relatively thick compared with the chamber size.

## Limitations and Alternate Approaches *Endocardial Definition*

Accurate identification of the ventricular endocardium is key in the echocardiographic evaluation of LV systolic function regardless of whether M-mode, 2D, or 3D approaches are used. Speckle tracking stain also is most accurate with high-quality images of the myocardium. Endocardial definition is affected by the physics of ultrasound instrumentation, by anatomic factors, and by technical factors, including the skill of the sonographer. The endocardial-ventricular cavity interface is curved from any imaging window, so the endocardium appears as a thin, bright line where it is perpendicular to the ultrasound beam (axial resolution), but as a broad, "blurred" line where the beam is parallel to the endocardial-ventricular cavity interface (lateral resolution). As for other ultrasound targets, lateral resolution is depth dependent. In addition, "dropout" of signals may result from attenuation, a parallel intercept angle, acoustic shadowing, or reverberations.

Anatomically, the endocardium is not a smooth surface but has numerous trabeculations that are most prominent at the LV apex. The ultrasound beam is reflected from the inner edge of these trabeculations, so that the "endocardium" identified by echocardiography differs from the "endocardium" identified by contrast ventriculography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, in which contrast fills these trabeculations and outlines their outer edges.

Several technical factors affect endocardial definition during image acquisition, and meticulous examination technique is needed for optimal image quality. First, acoustic access can be optimizing by:

- Patient positioning
- Use of an echo-stretcher with an apical cutout
- Having the patient suspend respiration
- Careful adjustment of transducer position

Instrument settings can dramatically affect image quality, including:

- Transducer frequency
- Gain
- Gray-scale settings
- Focal depth
- Tissue harmonic imaging

2D endocardial borders are traced from digitally acquired images using the real-time motion of the images to aid in identification of the endocardial border during the tracing process. End-diastolic and end-systolic images are traced on the same cardiac cycle, with end-diastole defined as onset of the QRS complex and end-systole defined as minimal ventricular volume. The trained human observer remains the most accurate means for endocardial border tracing, thus limiting the wide application of quantitative methods because manual tracing of endocardial borders at enddiastole and end-systole in at least two views remains a tedious and time-consuming task. 3D imaging uses semiautomated border detection but continues to rely on manual identification of key anatomic landmarks and usually requires adjustment of the automated borders for accurate volumes measurements. Similarly, the speckle tracking strain images are visually inspected and adjusted to ensure that the myocardium is tracked correctly.

For 3D, 2D, and speckle tracking apical imaging, the patient is positioned in a steep left lateral position on a stretcher with an apical cutout to avoid foreshortening the LV length. A higher-frequency transducer is used for optimal image quality, and the focal depth of the transducer is adjusted to the depth of interest. The sector depth and width are adjusted to maximize the size of the LV on the screen and to optimize frame rate. Tissue harmonic imaging improves 2D endocardial definition in most patients. In addition, the patient is asked to suspend respiration, while avoiding a Valsalva maneuver, at the phase of respiration where image quality is optimal. When endocardial definition remains poor despite these measures, the use of an intravenous contrast agent to opacify the LV is appropriate.

#### *Geometric Assumptions*

Quantitation of LV volumes depends on accurate visualization of the endocardium along the entire length of the chamber. 3D data sets or 2D views that foreshorten the LV will result in underestimation of LV length, which affects both TTE and TEE approaches. With TTE imaging, adequate apical views require a steep left lateral decubitus position with an apical cutout in the echo-stretcher mattress to visualize the true long axis of the chamber. On TEE imaging, even with adjustment of transducer position and angulation of the image plane, it is not always possible to include the apex on 3D data sets or in the 2D four-chamber and two-chamber views.

Respiratory motion and cardiac motion within the chest during the cardiac cycle further confound the geometric assumptions of LV volume calculations. The effect of respiratory motion of the heart relative to the transducer can be avoided by measuring beats at the same phase of respiration or by having the patient briefly suspend respiration during data acquisition. In some cases, optimal images are obtained when the patient suspends respiration after taking in a small breath, rather than at end-expiration. It is more difficult to correct for the motion of the heart itself when using a tomographic imaging procedure. Cardiac translation (movement of the heart in the chest), rotation (movement around the long axis of the heart), and torsion (unequal rotational motion of the heart) can result in images of different segments of the LV during systole and diastole, even with a fixed image plane. Although cardiac motion has only a limited effect on the accuracy of LV volume calculations, it can have a pronounced effect on quantitative evaluation of regional ventricular function, as discussed in Chapter 8.

#### *Accuracy and Reproducibility*

Qualitative comparison of LV systolic function from different studies on the same patient is facilitated by the standard digital cine-loop side-by-side format. Of course, the influence of loading conditions on LV systolic function still must be considered when comparing studies performed at different time points in a patient's clinical course.

In most reported series, intraobserver variability for 2D LV volumes ranges from 5% to 10%. Interobserver variability is greater, ranging from 7% to 25% for 2D ventricular volumes. Because ejection fraction is a calculated percentage, reproducibility is better, with variability of about 10%. These values are similar to reported variability for ventricular volumes and ejection fraction determined by contrast or radionuclide ventriculography. Note that variability between studies in an individual patient includes:

- Physiologic variability (loading condition, heart rate, volume states)
- Image acquisition or test-retest variability (endocardial definition, image orientation)

 Measurement variability in tracing the endothelial borders

With optimal data, a significant change between studies is a difference in ejection fraction >2%, end-diastolic volume >2%, and end-systolic volume >5%.

Although LV volumes are underestimated by 3D echocardiography compared with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, measurements are more accurate and reproducible than 2D-derived data. For example, the mean difference between observers for 3D echocardiographic LV end-diastolic volume is  $-3 \pm 10$  mL compared with  $13 \pm 17$  mL for 2D LV volumes. Similarly, the interobserver mean difference of LV ejection fraction is  $0 \pm 3\%$  for 3D versus  $2 \pm 8\%$  for 2D imaging.

#### Alternate Approaches

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging provides precise and accurate measures of LV volumes, mass, ejection fraction, and cardiac output. Other approaches include contrast angiography in the cardiac catheterization laboratory and radionuclide ventriculography. The choice of imaging technique in an individual patient depends on what other clinical questions are present in addition to availability and cost.

## DOPPLER EVALUATION OF LEFT VENTRICULAR SYSTOLIC FUNCTION

#### Stroke Volume Calculation

Doppler echocardiographic evaluation of LV systolic function usually is based on calculation of stroke volume and cardiac output (see Appendix B, Table B.3).

## **ECHO MATH:** Doppler Stroke Volume and Cardiac Output

Using Doppler and 2D echo data, stroke volume (SV in cm³ or mL) is calculated as cross-sectional area (CSA in cm²) of flow times the velocity-time integral (VTI in cm) of flow through that region:

$$SV = CSA \times VTI$$
 (Eq. 6.11)

and

$$CO = SV \times HR$$
 (Eq. 6.12)

Where CO is cardiac output and HR is heart rate.

For example, if LV outflow tract diameter is 2.3 cm, LV outflow-velocity time integral is 11 cm, and heart rate is 88 bpm:

Cardiac output (CO) is calculated using the LVOT diameter to calculate the circular cross-sectional areas of flow:

$$CSA_{LVOT} = \pi (LVOT_D/2)^2 = 3.14(2.3/2)^2 = 4.2 \text{ cm}^2$$

Stroke volume across the aortic valve ( $cm^3 = mL$ ), then, is:

$$SV_{LVOT} = (CSA_{LVOT} \times VTI_{LVOT})$$
$$= 4.2 \text{ cm}^2 \times 11 \text{ cm} = 46 \text{ cm}^3$$

Cardiac output is:

$$CO = SV \times HR = 46 \text{ mL} \times 88 \text{ beats/min}$$
  
=  $4048 \text{ mL/min}$  or  $4.05 \text{ L/min}$ 

Cardiac index (CI) normalizes flow to body surface area (BSA):

$$CI = CO/BSA = 4.05 L/min/1.8 m^2 = 2.25 L/min/m^2$$

This indicates a low cardiac output and index (normal >2.5 L/min/m²)

Conceptually, the LV ejects a volume of blood into the cylindrical aorta on each beat (Fig. 6.13). The base of this cylinder is the systolic cross-sectional area of the outflow tract, whereas its height is the distance the average blood cell traveled during ejection for that beat. This distance is expressed as the integral of the Doppler systolic velocity-time curve because velocity is the first derivative of distance. Alternatively, this distance also can be thought of as mean velocity (cm/s) multiplied by ejection duration (seconds). Again, because the volume of a cylinder is base times height, stroke volume is cross-sectional area multiplied by the velocity-time integral.

![](_page_14_Figure_27.jpeg)

Fig. 6.13 Doppler stroke volume concept. The cross-sectional area (CSA) of flow is calculated as a circle based on a 2D echo diameter (D) measurement. The length of the cylinder of blood ejected through this cross-sectional area on a single beat is the velocity-time integral (VTI) of the Doppler curve. Stroke volume (SV) then is calculated as  $CSA \times VTI$ .

This approach to stroke volume calculation depends on several basic assumptions:

- Accurate cross-sectional flow area measurement
- Laminar flow with spatially "flat" flow-velocity profile
- Parallel intercept angle between Doppler beam and direction of blood flow
- Velocity and diameter measurements are made at the same anatomic site

First, the cross-sectional area must be measured accurately. Typically, diameter is measured and 2D area calculated as π(D/2)[2](#page--1-56) based on the assumption of a circular geometry. Deviations from a circular geometry or changes in cross-sectional area during the flow period will result in inaccuracies unless appropriate corrections are included in the calculations. Small errors in 2D diameter measurements become large errors in cross-sectional area calculations because radius (half the diameter) is squared in the calculations. Using a transducer orientation and instrument settings that maximize image quality, performing measurements based on axial (rather than lateral) resolution, performing diameter measurements in two orthogonal planes (when possible), and averaging several beats can help minimize this source of error.

Second, the pattern of flow is assumed to be laminar, and the spatial flow profile across the flowstream is assumed to be relatively flat. These assumptions ensure that the velocity curve represents the spatial (and temporal) average flow in that region. The validity of the assumption of laminar flow in the great vessels and across normal cardiac valves is demonstrated by the narrow band of velocities and smooth spectral signal seen on pulsed Doppler echo recordings. A flat flow profile also is a reasonable assumption at the inlet to the great vessels and across the valve planes because of the effects of geometric convergence and acceleration. A flat flow-velocity profile can be confirmed by moving the sample volume across the flowstream in two orthogonal views to demonstrate uniform velocities at the center and the edges of the flowstream.

Third, the Doppler signal is assumed to have been recorded at a parallel intercept angle to flow, resulting in an accurate velocity measurement (based on a cos θ = 1 in the Doppler equation). In practical terms, the sonographer aligns the Doppler beam in the presumed direction of flow and then carefully moves the ultrasound beam across the image plane and in the elevational plane to obtain the highest-velocity signal, thus indicating the most parallel alignment with flow. Note that the optimal window for Doppler interrogation is when the ultrasound beam and flowstream are parallel, whereas the optimal window for diameter measurement is when the ultrasound beam and tissue-blood interfaces are perpendicular.

Fourth, it is crucial that the diameter and velocity measurements be made at the same anatomic site because the cross-sectional area and flow-velocity curves must be temporally and spatially congruent for accurate volume flow rate calculations. As the cross-sectional area of flow narrows or expands, flow velocity will increase or decrease correspondingly, so that conjoining information from two different anatomic sites will result in erroneous stroke volume data. Similarly, dynamic changes in stroke volume occur with changes in heart rate, loading conditions, exercise, and so on, so that measurements made at disparate times cannot be combined. In clinical practice, diameter and velocity recordings are made in close sequence and are repeated if any question of an interval physiologic change exists.

## Sites for Stroke Volume Measurement

Stroke volume can be measured by this approach at any intracardiac site where both cross-sectional area and the flow-velocity integral can be recorded, given the assumptions of laminar flow and a flat flow profile.

#### *Left Ventricular Outflow*

The standard site for stroke volume measurement is the LV outflow tract at the level of the aortic annulus just proximal to the valve leaflets. The LV outflow tract offers several advantages: (1) the spatial flow profile is relatively flat because of tapering geometry and flow acceleration, (2) the needed data can be recorded in nearly all patients, and (3) flow remains laminar proximal to a stenosis (allowing transaortic stroke volume calculations in patients with aortic valve disease). LV outflow tract diameter is measured in a parasternal long-axis view parallel and immediately adjacent to the aortic valve, in mid-systole, from the white-black edge of the septal endocardium to the black-white edge of the anterior mitral leaflet [\(Fig. 6.14](#page--1-57)). Pulsed Doppler is used from an apical approach to record the velocity curve, by using the closing click of the aortic valve to ensure that the sample volume is located at the annulus (the same site as the diameter measurement). The small region of flow convergence proximal to the narrowed aortic valve is avoided by moving the sample volume slightly apically until a narrow spectral width is seen at the velocity peak.

On TEE imaging, outflow tract diameter is measured in a long-axis view with improved accuracy because of the higher-resolution images on TEE. LV outflow velocity sometimes may be recorded from a transgastric apical view or, starting from a transgastric short-axis view, rotating the image plane 90° to the two-chamber view and then turning the transducer slightly medially to visualize the LV outflow tract. However, it is difficult to ensure a parallel intercept angle between the ultrasound beam and LV outflow, so underestimation of stroke volume is likely.

**Fig. 6.14 Doppler left ventricular outflow stroke volume calculation.** (A) LV outflow tract diameter *(LVOTD)* measurement from a parasternal long-axis view and (B) the pulsed Doppler recording of LV outflow just proximal to the aortic valve *(Ao)* from an apical approach for stroke volume calculation. The aortic valve closing click *(arrow)* on the outflow tract velocity *(LVOTV)* recording ensures that the sample volume *(SV)* location is immediately adjacent to the valve, corresponding with the site of outflow tract diameter measurement.

LV stroke volume also can be measured in the ascending aorta with diameter measured from a parasternal long-axis view and the flow-velocity curve recorded from either an apical or a suprasternal notch window. If continuous-wave (CW) Doppler ultrasound is used, the highest velocities along the path of the beam will be recorded, so the narrowest segment of the aorta (the sinotubular junction) is used for diameter measurements. If pulsed Doppler is used, the aortic diameter measurement should correspond to the Doppler sample volume location. Note that if aortic valve disease is present, stroke volume measurement in the ascending aorta will be inaccurate because of nonlaminar flow distal to the valve.

#### *Mitral Valve*

Transmitral stroke volume calculations assume that the mitral annulus is the limiting cross-sectional flow area, with the leaflets moving passively in response to the flowstream. Transmitral stroke volume is calculated as the product of the cross-sectional annulus area and the velocity-time integral of flow recorded at the mitral annulus level. On TEE imaging, transmitral flow rate is measured in the four-chamber view with the pulsed Doppler sample volume placed at the annulus level and the diameter measured from the 2D image [\(Fig. 6.15](#page--1-58)). Although the mitral annulus is most accurately described as a curved ellipse with the major (more apical) axis seen in the four-chamber view and the minor (more basal) axis seen in the long-axis view, for most clinical applications, the mitral annulus is assumed to be circular. Mitral annulus diameter can be measured in a parasternal long-axis view, which has the advantage of using axial resolution (which improves accuracy) but the disadvantage of ambiguity in the correct measurement location because the site of Doppler recording must be estimated. Alternatively, diameter can be measured in the apical four-chamber view, which has as the advantage that diameter can be measured on the same image that displays the sample volume (ensuring a correct measurement site) but the disadvantage of lateral resolution, which limits the accuracy of the measurement.

#### *Right Heart*

Stroke volume can be calculated by analogous methods in the pulmonary artery or across the tricuspid valve [\(Fig. 6.16\)](#page--1-59). In adult patients, use of the pulmonary artery site on TTE imaging often is limited by poor image quality, which results in unobtainable or inaccurate pulmonary artery diameter measurements. However, from a TEE approach, pulmonary artery flow and diameter often can be measured using a very high transducer position looking from the pulmonary artery bifurcation toward the pulmonic valve.

## Differences in Transvalvular Volume Flow Rates

In a normal heart, stroke volume across each of the four valves is equal, and measurement at more than

**Fig. 6.15 Doppler transmitral stroke volume calculation.** The mitral valve *(MV)* annulus area in diastole is multiplied by the velocity-time integral *(VTI)* of flow at the annulus. In this example, annulus diameter *(left)* is 3.5 cm, so the circular cross-sectional area is 9.6 cm2 . The velocity-time integral of transmitral flow is 7.7 cm for a stroke volume of 74 mL or a cardiac output of 4.4 L/min at a heart rate of 60 bpm.

one site only serves as an internal accuracy check. However, in the presence of valvular regurgitation or an intracardiac shunt, calculation of stroke volume at two intracardiac sites allows quantitation of the degree of regurgitation or pulmonic-to-systemic shunt ratio, as detailed in Chapters 12 and 17.

## Other Doppler Measures of Systolic Function

## *Ejection Acceleration Times*

In addition to stroke volume calculations, the shape of the Doppler ejection curve provides information about ventricular function. When systolic function is normal, the isovolumic contraction period is short, and the rate of pressure rise in early systole is rapid. These features are reflected in the Doppler velocity curve, which shows a short isovolumic contraction time, a rapid acceleration of blood in early systole, and a short time interval from the onset of flow to maximum velocity. With impaired LV systolic function, the isovolumic contraction time (also known as the pre-ejection period) becomes progressively longer, the rate of acceleration diminishes, and the time to maximum velocity increases, with all these changes mirrored in the Doppler velocity curve. In addition to measuring these variables at rest, some centers have found evaluation of aortic ejection curves with exercise useful in detection of LV systolic dysfunction.

#### Rate of Ventricular Pressure Rise (dP/dt)

When mitral regurgitation is present, the CW Doppler velocity curve indicates the instantaneous pressure difference between the LV and the LA in systole, assuming a constant intercept angle between the mitral regurgitant jet and the ultrasound beam. Given the rapid rate of rise of LV pressure with normal systolic function (and the low LA pressure), mitral regurgitation typically shows a rapid rise to maximum velocity as per the Bernoulli equation. If the rate of rise in ventricular pressure is reduced because of LV systolic dysfunction, the rate of increase in velocity of the mitral regurgitant jet also is reduced. For example, in patients with premature ventricular beats, the altered contractility of the premature beat is evidenced by a marked difference in the rate of velocity increase of the mitral regurgitant jet.

#### ECHO MATH: Left Ventricular dP/dt

The slope of the mitral regurgitant jet can be quantitated as the rate of change in pressure over time (dP/dt) by measuring the time interval between the mitral regurgitant jet velocity at 1 and at 3 m/s (Fig. 6.17). At each velocity, the corresponding pressure gradient is  $4v^2$  per the Bernoulli equation. Then,

$$dP/dt = [4(3)^2 - 4(1)^2]/\text{time interval}$$
 (Eq. 6.13)  
= 32 mmHg/time interval

Thus a longer time interval indicates a depressed dP/dt, and vice versa. Of course, the calculation of dP/dt can be performed only when a recordable mitral regurgitant jet is present and assumes a constant (and parallel) intercept angle between the mitral regurgitant jet and the ultrasound beam during the measurement period.

For example, if the time interval is 36 ms (0.036 seconds) between the points on the mitral regurgitant velocity curve at 1 and 3 m/s,

$$dP/dt = [4(3)^2 - 4(1)^2]/0.036 \text{ s} = 32 \text{ mmHg}/0.036 \text{ s}$$
  
= 889 mmHg/s

which is mildly reduced (normal >1000 mmHg/s).

## Limitations and Alternate Approaches

The major limitation of Doppler evaluation of LV systolic function in adults is accurate diameter measurement for cross-sectional area calculations. Although

![](_page_18_Figure_14.jpeg)

Fig. 6.17 Left ventricular dP/dt. The time interval between 1 and 3 m/s on the mitral regurgitant (MR) velocity curve is measured with the scale expanded to optimize accuracy. Examples of (A) normal ventricular systolic function (dP/dt > 1000 mmHg/s) and (B) the slow rate of rise in mitral regurgitant velocity in a patient with dilated cardiomyopathy, corresponding to a dP/dt of 668 mmHg/s, are shown by the parallel vertical lines.

Doppler velocity curves can be recorded consistently with little interobserver measurement variability (2% to 5%), the variability of 2D diameter measurements is significantly greater (8% to 12%). For Doppler velocity data, the major source of measurement variability is data recording, given the critical importance of obtaining a parallel intercept angle between the ultrasound beam and the flow of interest. For 2D diameters, the major source of variability is measuring

the 2D images, particularly when image quality is suboptimal or when lateral resolution limits accurate border recognition. Despite these potential limitations, Doppler measurement of stroke volume has been well validated in a variety of clinical and research settings.

Measurement of *dP/dt* is limited by the need for enough mitral regurgitation to generate a Doppler signal with a well-defined velocity curve. Changes during ejection in the intercept angle between the ultrasound beam and the regurgitant jet will result in an erroneous measurement because the assumption that cos θ = 1 in the Doppler equation will not be valid.

When more precise or repeated measures of flow are needed, cardiac output can be measured by the thermodilution or Fick techniques through a right-sided heart catheter both in the catheterization laboratory and in the coronary care unit.

## ECHO APPROACH TO RIGHT VENTRICULAR SYSTOLIC FUNCTION

The normal shape of the RV is complex in 3D, with the inflow segment located medial to the LV, the body and apex located anterior to the LV, and the RV outflow tract located superior to the LV and aortic valve ([Fig. 6.18](#page--1-61)). No simple geometric shape approximates the RV chamber; rather, it is "wrapped around" the LV in a U-shaped fashion. Because echocardiographic long- and short-axis views are oriented with respect to the LV, the RV appears abnormal in some individuals because of an oblique image plane compared with the position of the RV,

![](_page_19_Figure_8.jpeg)

**Fig. 6.18 Anatomy of the normal right ventricle.** *Left*, Left lateral view. *Right*, Basal view. Endocardial surfaces were generated by reconstruction using 3D echo and knowledge-based reconstruction. The hollow mesh is the RV endocardial surface; the solid red is that of the LV. The RV is crescentic in short-axis section, with tricuspid and pulmonic valve orifices widely separated by the crista supraventricularis. *Ant,* Anterior; *AoV,* aortic valve; *Inf,* inferior; *MV,* mitral valve; *Post,* posterior; *PV,* pulmonic valve; *Sup,* superior; *TV,* tricuspid valve. *(Images courtesy Dr. Florence H. Sheehan, University of Washington Cardiovascular Research and Training Center. From Kurtz C: Right ventricular anatomy, function, and echocardiographic evaluation.

particularly from the parasternal window. Both subcostal and apical four-chamber windows tend to offer more consistent views of the RV, with the RV appearing somewhat triangular, with a broad base and narrow apex. The RV apex is slightly closer to the base than the LV apex (by about one third of the LV length) in normal individuals.

On TTE 2D imaging, the RV is evaluated from several different windows:

- Parasternal long- and short-axis
- RV inflow
- Apical four-chamber
- Subcostal four-chamber

On TEE imaging, similar views are obtained including the high TEE four-chamber view, a TEE short-axis view obtained by rotating the image plane to about 90°, and the transgastric RV inflow view. In each view on either TTE or TEE imaging, evaluation of the RV includes:

- Area of the chamber (relative to the LV chamber)
- Shape of the RV cavity
- Wall thickness
- Motion of the RV free wall
- Ventricular septal curvature and motion

## Right Ventricle Size

With RV dilation, the RV outflow tract may be enlarged in the parasternal and TEE long-axis view. On apical and subcostal views and TEE transgastric views, the RV chamber is larger, and the RV apex is either closer to or encompasses the LV apex. The degree of RV dilation is best evaluated in the apical or subcostal four-chamber view in relation to the size of the LV, while taking into consideration any abnormalities in LV size. Qualitatively, RV size is described as:

- Normal (smaller than LV with RV apex more basal than LV apex)
- Mildly dilated (enlarged but RV < LV area)
- Moderately dilated (RV = LV area)
- Severely dilated (RV > LV area)

Quantitative end-diastolic 2D echocardiographic measurements for quantitation of RV size [\(Fig. 6.19](#page--1-62) and [Table 6.4](#page--1-45)) include:

- Basal and mid-RV dimensions measured in the four-chamber view
- RV wall thickness measured on the subcostal view
- RV outflow tract proximal and distal diameters measured in parasternal views

RV dilation is the normal response of the ventricle to volume overload, and its presence mandates a careful search for etiology, such as an atrial septal defect, tricuspid regurgitation, or pulmonic regurgitation.

![](_page_20_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 6.19 Standard 2D right ventricle views and measurements.** Evaluation of RV size and systolic function is based on multiple views including the parasternal long-axis *(upper left)* and short-axis *(upper right)* apical four-chamber *(lower left)* views angulated to focus on the RV and the subcostal four-chamber view *(lower right)* . Standard measurements (*arrows* in each view) include the proximal and distal RV outflow tract *(RVOT),* the basal and mid-RV diameters at end-diastole, and the RV free wall thickness, as shown. *Ao,* Aorta.

Pressure overload of the RV also leads to dilation, so evaluation of pulmonary pressures is mandatory when the RV is abnormal.

RV hypertrophy is manifested as an RV free wall thickness >0.5 cm. RV wall thickness is best measured by 2D or 2D-guided M-mode in a subcostal fourchamber view at the tricuspid chordal level at the peak of the R wave on the electrocardiogram. Epicardial fat and myocardial trabeculations are excluded from this measurement. The presence of RV hypertrophy suggests RV pressure overload and prompts a search for evidence of elevated pulmonary pressures or pulmonic valve stenosis. Increased thickness of the RV free wall also is seen in some infiltrative cardiomyopathies or in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

## Right Ventricular Systolic Function

RV systolic function is evaluated qualitatively as:

- Normal
- Mildly reduced
- Moderately reduced
- Severely reduced

laboratories.

When ventricular systolic function is normal, the relative function of the two ventricles can be compared. When LV systolic function is depressed, the severity of LV dysfunction is used as an index of RV function (e.g., a normal RV compared with a reduced LV ejection fraction appears hyperdynamic). If both ventricles have a similar qualitative pattern of contraction, the degree of RV dysfunction will be similar to the degree of LV dysfunction.

RV speckle tracking longitudinal strain

Quantitative evaluation of RV systolic function is challenging. Standard geometric formulas for volume calculations have only limited applicability given the shape of the RV and 3D methods require further evaluation. Instead, clinical evaluation is based on simpler measures including:

■ Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE)

35% or higher

10 cm/s or greater

*Normal RV 3D EF* 45% or higher

*Normal S*′

- RV fractional area change
- Tissue Doppler peak systolic velocity at the tricuspid annulus
- Pulsed or tissue Doppler myocardial performance index

TAPSE measures RV longitudinal shortening based on the distance the tricuspid annulus moves toward the RV apex from end-diastole to end-systole. TAPSE

is measured from an RV-optimized apical four-chamber view, with an M-mode intersecting the lateral tricuspid annulus ([Fig. 6.20](#page--1-63)). RV fractional area change is measured by tracing the RV endocardial borders at end-diastole and end-systole in the apical four-chamber view, while taking care to include the RV apex and lateral wall in the image plane [\(Fig. 6.21](#page--1-64)). The tissue Doppler annular velocity signal [\(Fig. 6.22](#page--1-40)) allows measurement of the peak systolic velocity (with a measurement over 10 cm/s indicating normal RV systolic function).

#### **ECHO MATH:** RV Index of Myocardial Performance

The RV index of myocardial performance (RIMP) is the ratio of isovolumic contraction time (IVCT) plus isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) divided by ejection time (ET):

$$RIMP = (IVCT_{RV} + IVRT_{RV})/ET$$
 (Eq. 6.14)

RIMP can be measured using intervals measured from conventional pulsed Doppler or from the Doppler tissue imaging signal with time intervals measured on the same heartbeat. Ejection time is measured as the pulmonic systolic flow duration or as the tissue Doppler systolic velocity duration. Tricuspid valve closure time (TCO) is measured as the total duration of tricuspid regurgitation or as the interval between the end of the tissue Doppler *A'* velocity and the onset of the next *E'* velocity. Tricuspid valve closure time includes RV ejection time (ETRV) plus isovolumic relaxation (IVRRV) and isovolumic contraction (IVCRV):

$$TCO = IVC_{RV} + IVR_{RV} + ET_{RV}$$
 (Eq. 6.15)

so that

$$TCO - ET_{RV} = IVC_{RV} + IVR_{RV}$$
 (Eq. 6.16)

Thus,

$$RIMP = (TCO - ET)/ET$$
 (Eq. 6.17)

For example, if the ejection time is 300 ms and the tricuspid closure time is 430 ms,

$$RIMP = (430 - 300)/430 = 0.30$$

which indicates normal RV systolic function. Abnormal RV function is indicated by an RIMP >0.43 by pulsed and > 0.54 by tissue Doppler.

## Patterns of Ventricular Septal Motion

The interventricular septum functions as part of the LV in the normal heart. During diastole, the LV is circular in a short-axis view, with the normal septal curvature convex toward the RV and concave toward the LV. With the onset of systole, the septal myocardium thickens, and the septal endocardium moves toward the center of the LV such that at end-systole the short-axis image shows a circular LV chamber.

Several cardiac disorders alter the pattern of ventricular septal motion, the most prominent being RV pressure and volume overload. The basic principle

**Fig. 6.21 Right ventricular fractional area change.** In the apical four-chamber view, the end-diastolic *(top)* and end-systolic *(bottom)* RV areas are traced to calculate fractional area change in a patient with normal RV size and systolic function *(left)* and a patient with a dilated, hypertrophied, and hypocontractile RV *(right).*

underlying the pattern of septal motion with RV dilation or hypertrophy is that the septum moves toward the center of mass of the entire heart. Normally, the center of cardiac mass coincides with the center of the LV. When RV and LV masses are equal, septal motion is "flat" (on M-mode) or minimal (on 2D echo). When RV mass exceeds LV mass, the septum moves "paradoxically" anterior in systole (on M-mode) and flattens or reverses its curvature in diastole (on 2D echo) [\(Fig. 6.23](#page--1-65)).

On 2D echocardiography, pressure overload of the RV (increased mass as a result of increased wall thickness with a nondilated chamber) results in a leftward shift of septal motion throughout the cardiac cycle with the maximum reversed curvature at endsystole. With predominant RV volume overload, the maximum reversed curvature is seen in mid-diastole with normalization of curvature in systole. With increased RV mass resulting from volume overload, the additional factor of increased RV filling and emptying accentuates the diastolic reverse motion of the septum (because of rapid RV diastolic filling), resulting in a D shape of the LV chamber in early diastole, with the reversed curvature of the septum persisting throughout diastole. Anterior motion with systole appears less prominent than with isolated pressure overload as the septum moves from its abnormal diastolic position back toward the center

**Fig. 6.22 Right ventricular annular tissue Doppler imaging.** In an apical fourchamber view angled toward the right heart, a Doppler sample volume is placed about 1 cm apical to the tricuspid annulus *(arrow).* Tissue Doppler imaging *(TDI)* shows apical motion toward the transducer in systole (S′) with a normal velocity over 10 cm/s, as in this example. In diastole, *E*′ and *A*′ tissue Doppler velocities are seen, analogous to those seen on mitral TDI recordings.

![](_page_24_Figure_4.jpeg)

of the heart, thereby resulting in a more convex curve relative to the RV chamber. Often, the observation of abnormal septal motion during the examination is the first clue of RV pressure, volume overload, or both.

Other abnormalities that affect the pattern of ventricular septal motion are summarized in [Fig.](#page--1-66) [6.24](#page--1-66). Conduction defects affect the pattern of motion by altering the sequence of RV and LV contraction. Valvular disease can affect the timing of RV versus LV diastolic filling, particularly in early diastole. Pericardial tamponade or constriction results in a fixed total cardiac volume so that respiratory changes in RV filling result in respiratory shifts in the pattern of septal motion.

An abnormal pattern of septal motion may be appreciated on 2D imaging; however, M-mode echo offers more detailed time resolution for studying the pattern of motion. Abnormal septal motion rarely is diagnostic in and of itself, but it may raise a diagnostic possibility that had not been considered previously or support a suspected diagnosis. For example, a pattern of paradoxical septal motion in association with RV and right atrial (RA) enlargement suggests the possibility of an atrial septal defect. This possibility then can be specifically excluded (or confirmed) during the echocardiographic examination. Another example is the patient with a pericardial effusion; in this situation a changing pattern of septal motion with respiration supports a diagnosis of tamponade physiology.

## Limitations and Alternate Approaches

Echocardiographic measures of RV size and systolic function generally are adequate in most clinical situations, despite the challenges related to RV geometry and image quality. However, when precise measurements are needed, alternate approaches are appropriate. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging provides accurate measurement of RV volumes and ejection fraction and is increasingly used when these measurements are needed for clinical decision making, particularly in adults with congenital heart disease. RV contrast angiography can be performed at catheterization, but wide variability in the appearance of the normal RV has been observed. Radionuclide ventriculography can be used to derive an RV ejection fraction.

## PULMONARY VASCULATURE

## Pulmonary Systolic Pressure Estimates

Clinically, one of the most important quantitative parameters affecting RV systolic function is pulmonary artery pressure or resistance. Pulmonary hypertension often occurs in response to chronic left-sided heart diseases, such as mitral stenosis, mitral regurgitation, cardiomyopathy, and ischemic cardiac disease, but it also occurs in patients with pulmonary disease or primary pulmonary hypertension. Knowledge of the degree of pulmonary pressure elevation is critical in patient management and is a key component of the echocardiographic examination [\(Table 6.5](#page--1-67)).

## *Tricuspid Regurgitant Velocity*

The most reliable method for estimating pulmonary artery pressures noninvasively is based on measurement of the velocity in the tricuspid regurgitant jet.

![](_page_25_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 6.23 Paradoxical septal motion.** *(Top)* In a patient with RV volume overload due to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the parasternal short-axis view shows a dilated RV with a flat contour of the septum in diastole *(arrows)* but with a normal sepal contour and round appearance of the LV chamber in systole. *(Bottom)* In contrast, with RV pressure overload caused by primary pulmonary hypertension, although the diastolic image is similar to the volume-overloaded RV, with a markedly dilated RV with reverse curvature of the normal septal contour *(arrows),* the systolic image shows persistent flattening of the septal contour, with a D-shaped LV in both systole and diastole.

#### **ECHO MATH:** Estimated Pulmonary Systolic Pressure

The tricuspid regurgitant velocity *VTR* reflects the RV to RA pressure difference *ΔP*, as stated in the Bernoulli equation ([Fig. 6.25](#page--1-68)):

$$\Delta P_{\rm RV-RA} = 4(V_{\rm TR})^2$$
 (Eq. 6.18)

*IVC,* Inferior vena cava; *PA,* pulmonary artery; *RA,* right artrial; *TR,* tricuspid regurgitation.

When added to an estimate of RA pressure, RV systolic pressure (RVP) is obtained:

$$RVP = \Delta P_{RV-RA} + RAP$$
 (Eq. 6.19)

In the absence of pulmonic stenosis (which is rare in adults), RV systolic pressure equals pulmonary artery systolic pressure, so that:

$$RVP = PAP_{\text{systolic}} = 4(V_{\text{TR}})^2 + RAP \qquad \text{(Eq. 6.20)}$$

as diagrammed in [Fig. 6.25.](#page--1-68)

For example, with a tricuspid regurgitant velocity of 2.7 m/s and an estimated right atrial pressure of 10 mmHg,

Estimated PA systolic pressure  
= 
$$4(2.7)^2 + 10 \text{ mmHg} = 39 \text{ mmHg}$$

When pulmonic stenosis (PS) is present, the peak gradient (ΔPPS) is subtracted from the estimated RV systolic pressure:

$$PAP_{\text{systolic}} = [4(V_{\text{TR}})^2 + RAP] - \Delta P_{\text{PS}} \qquad \text{(Eq. 6.21)}$$

Mean pulmonary systolic pressure can be estimated by tracing the tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity to obtain the mean RV to RA pressure difference in systole, which is then added to the estimated RA pressure:

$$PAP_{mean} = Mean \Delta P_{RV-RA} + RAP$$
 (Eq. 6.22)

This method has been shown to be highly accurate compared with invasive measurements of pulmonary artery pressure over a wide range of values (Appendix B, Table B.4). Of course, the reliability of this approach is dependent on obtaining a parallel intercept angle between the tricuspid regurgitant jet and the ultrasound beam. Most often the apical or RV inflow view yields the highest-velocity signal given careful angulation of the ultrasound beam in 3D ([Fig. 6.26\)](#page--1-63). Occasionally, the highest-velocity tricuspid regurgitant jet is recorded

**Fig. 6.24 Patterns of septal motion on M-mode echocardiography.** The normal pattern is characterized by systolic brief anterior motion *(1)* followed by posterior motion and myocardial thickening. In diastole, a small diastolic dip *(2)* following mitral valve opening may be seen. Left bundle branch block *(LBBB)* is characterized by systolic rapid downward septal motion. LV volume overload results in exaggerated septal (and posterior wall) motion. RV volume overload results in paradoxical anterior motion of the septum in systole. A similar pattern is seen in patients after cardiac surgery *(Post-op).* Constrictive pericarditis is characterized by anterior motion of the septum with atrial filling (before the QRS), whereas mitral stenosis typically shows a prominent early diastolic dip.

from a subcostal approach. Although this method requires the presence of tricuspid regurgitation, this rarely is a limitation because about 90% of normal individuals and patients have some degree of tricuspid regurgitation.

## *Pulmonic Regurgitant Velocity*

The same concept can be applied to the pulmonic regurgitant velocity curve. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitant velocity (*V*PR) reflects the pulmonary artery to RV end-diastolic pressure gradient per the Bernoulli equation. When added to an estimate of RA pressure, this provides a noninvasive estimate of diastolic pulmonary artery pressure [\(Fig. 6.27](#page--1-69)).

$$PAP_{diastolic} = 4(V_{PR})^2 + RAP$$
 (Eq. 6.23)

## Estimation of Right Atrial Pressure

RA pressure is best estimated from evaluation of the inferior vena cava during respiration [\(Fig. 6.28](#page--1-70)). From a subcostal window, this segment of the inferior vena cava is imaged during quiet respiration. If the inferior vena cava diameter is normal (≤2 cm diameter) and the segment adjacent to the RA collapses by at least 50% with respiration, then RA pressure is equal to normal intrathoracic pressures (i.e., 5 to 10 mmHg). Failure to collapse with respiration, dilation of the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins, or both is associated with higher RA pressures [\(Table 6.6](#page--1-71)). When no response is noted with normal respiration, the patient is asked to sniff. This generates a sudden decrease in intrathoracic pressure, normally resulting in a decrease in inferior vena cava diameter. Echocardiographic estimates of RA pressure are most accurate for normal and severely elevated pressures, so it is prudent to indicate a range of possible pressures for intermediate values.

## Pulmonary Vascular Resistance

Pulmonary pressure is not an ideal measure of the vascular properties of the pulmonary bed because pressure is affected by volume flow rate (increased pressures with higher flow rates and vice versa) and by the LA pressure.

## *Pulmonary Artery Velocity Curve*

LV ejection curves show very rapid acceleration with a short time from flow onset to maximum velocity, whereas RV ejection curves show slower acceleration, a longer time from onset of flow to peak flow, and a more "rounded" velocity curve. As pulmonary vascular resistance increases, the shape of the RV ejection curve more closely approximates an LV

**Fig. 6.26 Tricuspid regurgitant velocity for pulmonary artery pressure calculations.** The tricuspid regurgitant jet is recorded with CW Doppler from the window yielding the highest velocity signal, the apical four-chamber view in this example, to calculate the peak RV-to-RA systolic pressure difference. The velocity curve also can be traced for calculation of the mean pressure difference for determination of mean pulmonary artery pressure.

**Fig. 6.27 Pulmonic regurgitation for diastolic pulmonary artery pressure estimate.** Pulmonic regurgitation recorded from a parasternal approach with CW Doppler shows an end-diastolic velocity *(Pl End Dias Vel)* of about 1 m/s, indicating low diastolic pulmonary pressures.

ejection curve, with a shorter time to peak velocity, findings suggesting that the shapes of these velocity curves are related to the downstream resistance or impedance. However, estimates of pulmonary pressures based on the pulmonary artery velocity curve are not as reliable as those based on the tricuspid regurgitant velocity, because an apparent short time to peak velocity can be due to measurement variability or to a nonuniform spatial flow-velocity distribution in the pulmonary artery.

#### *Pulmonary Vascular Resistance Calculations*

Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is calculated as the pressure drop across the pulmonary bed (mean systolic pulmonary pressure minus mean LA pressure) divided by stroke volume (SV):

$$PVR = (PA_{\rm mean} - LA_{\rm mean})/SV \tag{Eq. 6.24} \label{eq:eq. 6.24}$$

Pulmonary vascular resistance is expressed in dimensionless Wood units where normal is <1.5 Wood

<sup>\*</sup>Inferior vena cava diameter (IVC) is measured just proximal to entrance of hepatic veins in a subcostal view. Changes in IVC diameter during the respiratory cycle are not reliable indicators of RA pressure in patients on mechanical ventilation.

Data integrated from multiple sources, including: Brennan JM, Blair JE, Goonewardena S, et al: Reappraisal of the use of interior vena cava for estimating right atrial pressure, *J Am Soc Echocardiogr* 20:857–861, 2007; Kircher BH, Himelmann RB, Schiller NG: Noninvasive estimation of right atrial pressure from the inspiratory collapse of the inferior vena cava, *Am J Cardiol* 66:493, 1990; Lang RM, Bierig M, Devereux RB, et al: Recommendations for chamber quantification, *J Am Soc Echocardiogr* 18:1440, 2005.

Data from Rudksi LG, Lai WW, Afilalo J, et al: Guidelines for the echocardiographic assessment of the right heart in adults, *J Am Soc Echocardiogr* 23:685–713, 2010.

For intermediate values, the RA pressure estimate should be lowered or increased depending on the absence or presence of other signs of elevated RA pressures including restrictive right-sided diastolic filling pattern, tricuspid *E*/*E'* >6, diastolic flow predominance in the hepatic veins (systolic filling fraction <55%), and dilated RA with bulging of the septum toward the LA.

units, or a conversion factor is used for units of dynes/s/cm-5, where normal is <120 dynes/s/cm-5.

Noninvasive calculation of pulmonary resistance is problematic because of difficulty in measuring mean LA pressure and because of the measurement variability in noninvasive pulmonary artery pressure and right heart cardiac output calculations. One approach is to estimate the pressure drop across the pulmonary bed using the peak tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (*V*TR in m/s) (ignoring LA pressure) and to estimate stroke volume using the velocity-time integral of flow in the RV outflow tract (VTIRVOT in cm). This ratio is multiplied by 10 to approximate pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in Wood units:

$$PVR \cong 10(V_{TR})/VTI_{RVOT}$$
 (Eq. 6.25)

This approach is not recommended for routine use, but it may be helpful in identification of patients with normal resistance despite a high pulmonary systolic pressure and, conversely, patients with high resistance but low pressures resulting from a low cardiac output. However, this method may not be accurate in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, elevated pulmonary diastolic pressures, pulmonary artery or outflow tract dilation, severe elevation of RA pressure, or severe pulmonic regurgitation.

## Limitations and Alternate Approaches

Determination of pulmonary artery systolic pressure derived from the CW Doppler tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity is only as accurate as the primary data. Underestimation of tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity because of a nonparallel intercept angle between the jet and the ultrasound beam results in underestimation of pulmonary artery pressures. Overestimation of pulmonary artery pressures can occur if the mitral regurgitant jet is mistaken for tricuspid regurgitation. Although both signals occur in systole and are directed away from the LV apex, the duration of tricuspid regurgitation is slightly longer than that of mitral regurgitation (when RV and LV systolic function are normal) because of a slightly longer RV systolic ejection period. The shapes of the velocity curves tend to differ as well, with tricuspid regurgitation having a slower upstroke and a peak later in systole, although the shapes of both velocity curves are affected by changes in ventricular function or atrial pressure. Note that the velocity of mitral regurgitation always is high because it reflects the systolic LV (approximately 100 mmHg) to LA (approximately 10 mmHg) pressure difference. With normal pulmonary artery pressures, tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity is 2 to 2.5 m/s. With severe pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary pressure approaches systemic pressures, with a corresponding tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity in the range of 5 m/s.

It is important to keep separate the concepts of regurgitant *volume flow rate*—which relates to regurgitant severity—and regurgitant jet *velocity*—which reflects the instantaneous pressure gradient across the valve.

The estimate of RA pressure from the appearance of the inferior vena cava also can affect the accuracy of Doppler pulmonary artery pressure estimates. The importance of this source of error is greatest at intermediate tricuspid regurgitant jet velocities: a tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity of 2.5 m/s with an RA pressure of 5 mmHg indicates a pulmonary artery pressure of only 30 mmHg (normal to mildly elevated), but if RA pressure is 20 mmHg, then pulmonary artery pressure is 45 mmHg (moderate pulmonary hypertension). At the extreme (e.g., a tricuspid regurgitant jet of 5 m/s), pulmonary hypertension clearly is severe regardless of the RA pressure estimate.

If images of the inferior vena cava are suboptimal, or if the degree of change with respiration is equivocal, it is appropriate to report the range of possible pulmonary artery pressures or to indicate that the RV-to-RA pressure gradient is added to a clinical estimate of RA pressure. Evaluation of respiratory variation in inferior vena cava diameter can be confounded by respiratory motion in the position of the inferior vena cava such that the center of the vessel moves in and out of the image plane. Of course, evaluation of inferior vena cava size and respiratory variation is not helpful in patients supported by positive-pressure ventilation because intrathoracic pressures are abnormal.

When clinical and echocardiographic data are discrepant, invasive measurement of pulmonary artery pressure is appropriate. In many types of heart disease, accurate measures of pulmonary vascular resistance are needed, requiring direct measurement of pulmonary pressures with simultaneous cardiac output measurements.
