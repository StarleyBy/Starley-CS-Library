cardiac mass is defined as an abnormal structure within or immediately adjacent to the heart. The three basic types of cardiac masses are:

- Tumor
- Thrombus
- Vegetation

Abnormal mass lesions must be distinguished from the unusual appearance of a normal cardiac structure, which may be mistakenly considered an apparent "mass." Echocardiography allows dynamic evaluation of intracardiac masses with the advantage, compared with other tomographic techniques, that both the anatomic extent and the physiologic consequences of the mass can be evaluated. In addition, associated abnormalities (e.g., valvular regurgitation associated with a vegetation) and conditions that predispose to the development of a mass (e.g., apical aneurysm leading to left ventricular [LV] thrombus or rheumatic mitral stenosis resulting in left atrial [LA] thrombus) can be assessed. Disadvantages of echocardiography include suboptimal image quality in some patients, a relatively narrow field of view compared with that of computed tomography (CT) or cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, and the possibility of mistaking an ultrasound artifact for an anatomic mass.

# <span id="page-0-0"></span>BASIC PRINCIPLES

The first step in assessing a possible cardiac mass is to ensure that the echocardiographic findings represent an actual mass rather than an ultrasound artifact. As discussed in detail in Chapter 1, artifacts can be caused by electrical interference, characteristics of the ultrasound transducer or system, or various physical factors influencing image formation from the reflected ultrasound signals. These include beam-width artifact, near-field "ring-down," and multipath artifact. Appropriate transducer selection, scanning technique, and evaluation from multiple examining windows will help distinguish artifacts from actual anatomic structures.

Besides ultrasound artifacts, several normal structures and normal variants may be mistaken for a cardiac mass [\(Table 15.1\)](#page--1-25). In the ventricles, normal trabeculae, aberrant trabeculae or chordae (ventricular "webs" or false tendons) ([Fig. 15.1](#page--1-26)), muscle bundles (e.g., the moderator band), or the papillary muscles may be mistaken for abnormal structures.

Valve anatomy includes a wide range of normal variation, and the appearance of a normal (but often unrecognized) structure, such as a nodule of Arantius, on the aortic valve may be considered incorrectly to

represent a cardiac mass. The belly of a valve leaflet, if cut tangentially, may appear as a "mass" when it actually is a portion of the leaflet itself seen en face. In the atrium, normal ridges adjacent to the venous entry sites [\(Figs. 15.2](#page--1-27) and [15.3](#page--1-28)), normal trabeculations [\(Fig. 15.4](#page--1-29)), postoperative changes (see Fig. 9.31), and distortion of the free wall contour by structures adjacent to the atrium [\(Fig. 15.5](#page--1-30)) all may be diagnosed erroneously as a cardiac mass.

Definitive diagnosis of an intracardiac mass by echocardiography is based on:

- Excellent image quality, which requires the use of a high-frequency (5- or 7.5-MHz), short-focus transducer to evaluate the LV apex from the transthoracic (TTE) approach and the use of transesophageal (TEE) imaging to evaluate posterior cardiac structures (e.g., LA, mitral valve). Three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography often provides better definition of the location and geometry of the mass.
- Identification of the mass throughout the cardiac cycle, in the same anatomic region of the heart, from more than one acoustic window. This decreases the likelihood of an ultrasound artifact.
- Knowledge of the normal structures, normal variants, and postoperative changes that appear similar to a cardiac mass.
- Integration of other echocardiographic findings (e.g., rheumatic mitral stenosis and LA enlargement in a patient with suspected LA thrombus) and clinical data in the final echocardiographic interpretation.

Once it is clear that a cardiac mass is present, the next step is to determine whether that mass most likely is a tumor, a vegetation, or a thrombus. A definitive diagnosis generally cannot be made from the echocardiographic images alone because the microscopic

A small pericardial effusion *(PE)* around the lateral wall of the appendage is noted. A corresponding 3D image *(right)* is seen; in the video, the appendage is noted to be fibrillating. The *asterisk* indicates a pectinate muscle. *(From Oxorn D, Otto CM. Masses.

**Fig. 15.5 Persistent left superior vena cava.** Diagnosis is based on the finding of a dilated coronary sinus *(CS)* posterior to the LA *(arrow)* seen in a parasternal long-axis *(PLAX)* view *(left)*. If ultrasound "dropout" from the wall of the coronary sinus occurs, the abnormal contour of the LA may be mistaken for a mass.

and bacteriologic characteristics of the structure cannot be determined. However, a reasonably secure diagnosis often can be made by integrating the clinical data, echocardiographic appearance, and associated echo Doppler findings.

# VALVE VEGETATIONS

Infectious cardiac masses include valvular vegetations, which are seen in patients with endocarditis (bacterial or fungal). Noninfectious vegetations also occur in patients with nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE, or *marantic* endocarditis). Vegetations typically are irregularly shaped, attached to the upstream side of the valve leaflet (e.g., LA side of the mitral valve, LV side of the aortic valve), and exhibit chaotic motion that differs from that of the leaflets themselves [\(Fig. 15.6\)](#page--1-31). Valvular regurgitation is a frequent but not invariable accompaniment of endocarditis. Valvular stenosis *due to* the vegetation is rare. Paravalvular abscess, which also manifests as a cardiac mass, often is difficult to recognize on transthoracic imaging but can be diagnosed with high sensitivity and specificity on TEE echocardiography. Infectious cardiac masses are discussed in detail in Chapter 14.

# CARDIAC TUMORS

#### Nonprimary

Nonprimary cardiac tumors are approximately 20 times more common than primary cardiac tumors. Tumors can involve the heart by direct invasion from adjacent malignancies (lung, breast), by lymphatic spread, or by metastatic spread of distant disease (lymphoma, melanoma) [\(Fig. 15.7](#page--1-32)). In an autopsy series of patients with a malignant disease, cardiac involvement was present in approximately 10% of cases, although clinical recognition of cardiac involvement occurs less frequently. Melanoma has the highest rate of pericardial metastases, but because relatively few patients have melanoma, a cardiac tumor is more likely to represent a more prevalent malignant disease, as shown in [Table 15.2](#page--1-33).

Almost three fourths of cardiac metastases are due to lung, breast, or hematologic malignancies. Lymphomas associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) have frequent and extensive cardiac involvement.

Nonprimary cardiac tumors can affect the heart by:

- Invasion of the pericardium, epicardium, myocardium, or endocardium
- Production of biologically active substances
- Toxic effects of treatment on the heart (e.g., radiation or chemotherapy)

Cardiac malignancies most often involve the pericardium and epicardium (approximately 75% of metastatic cardiac disease) and manifest as a pericardial effusion, with or without tamponade physiology ([Fig.](#page--1-34) [15.8\)](#page--1-34). Because echocardiographic diagnosis of the *cause* of a pericardial effusion rarely is possible, the diagnosis of a pericardial effusion (and particularly tamponade) in a patient with a known malignancy should alert the clinician to the possibility of cardiac involvement. Confirmation of the diagnosis requires examination of pericardial fluid and, if necessary, pericardial biopsy. The differential diagnosis of a pericardial effusion in a patient with a known malignancy includes radiation pericarditis and idiopathic pericarditis (which is common in patients with cancer), in addition to metastatic disease. Repeat echocardiographic evaluation of patients with a malignant pericardial effusion often is needed after the initial diagnosis for assessment of therapeutic interventions and follow-up for recurrent effusion.

**Fig. 15.6 2D and 3D images of aortic valve vegetations.** TEE short-axis views of the aortic valve in diastole *(top)* and systole *(bottom)* using 3D *(left)* and 2D *(right)* imaging. 3D imaging shows three vegetations, one on each leaflet of the aortic valve. On 2D imaging only one vegetation *(arrow)* is seen in systole, with none visible on the diastolic image because the 2D image plane does not include the entire 3D height of the valve, but rather only a single image plane.

Myocardial involvement by metastatic disease is less common than pericardial involvement, but it does occur, particularly with lymphoma or melanoma. Intramyocardial masses can project into or compress cardiac chambers, with resulting hemodynamic compromise. Endocardial involvement is rarely seen.

A specific type of cardiac involvement by tumor that should be recognized by the echocardiographer is the extension of *renal cell carcinoma* up the inferior vena cava ([Fig. 15.9\)](#page--1-35). A "fingerlike" projection of a tumor protrudes into the right atrium (RA) from the inferior vena cava, and the tumor can be followed retrograde (from a subcostal approach) back to the kidney. Correlation with other wide-view imaging techniques is needed for full delineation of the tumor extent. *Uterine tumors* also occasionally manifest in this fashion.

Tumors also can affect the cardiac structures indirectly, as is seen in *carcinoid heart disease* ([Fig.](#page--1-30) [15.10\)](#page--1-30). Metastatic carcinoid tissue in the liver produces biologically active substances, including serotonin, which cause abnormalities of the right-sided cardiac valves and endocardium. Typical changes include thickening, retraction, and increased rigidity of the tricuspid and pulmonic valve leaflets, thus resulting in valvular regurgitation or, less often, valvular stenosis. Left-sided valvular involvement is rarely seen, possibly because of a lower concentration of the active molecules after passage through the lungs. Although metastatic carcinoid disease is rare, the echocardiographic

**Fig. 15.7 Distribution and pathologic characteristics of cardiac masses according to intracardiac attachment site.** In this series of 75 consecutive patients undergoing surgery for cardiac mass removal, masses were most often seen in the LA (46%), followed by the RA/inferior vena cava (IVC)/ superior vena cava (SVC) (27%), LV (8%), and RV (7%); in addition, 12% were attached to a valve. The most common causes of masses requiring excision were myxomas (41%), thrombi (16%), fibroelastoma (13%), and hypernephroma (9%). The baseline or postprocedure intraoperative TEE altered management in 16% of cases. *ca,* Carcinoma; *LAA,* LA appendage; met*,* metastatic; *MV,* mitral valve; *TV,* tricuspid valve. *(From Dujardin KS, Click RL, Oh JK: The role of intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography in patients undergoing cardiac mass removal,* J Am Soc Echocardiogr *13:1080–1083, 2000.)*

findings are pathognomonic and should lead to the diagnosis in a patient in whom it was not considered previously. About one third of patients with carcinoid tumors have cardiac involvement, and one half of the deaths in patients with carcinoid disease are due to heart failure resulting from severe tricuspid regurgitation.

#### Primary

As for tumors elsewhere in the body, the distinction between benign and malignant primary cardiac tumors is based on pathologic examination of tissue and its tendency to invade adjacent tissue or metastasize to distant sites ([Table 15.3](#page--1-36)). Although 75% of primary cardiac tumors are benign, a pathologically benign cardiac tumor can have "malignant" hemodynamic consequences if it obstructs the normal pattern of blood flow. Thus, the echocardiographic examination includes definition of both the anatomic extent of a cardiac tumor and its physiologic consequences.

#### *Benign Primary Cardiac Tumors*

*Myxomas* account for 27% of primary cardiac tumors. Cardiac myxomas most often are single, arising from the fossa ovalis of the interatrial septum and protruding into the LA (in approximately 75% of cases) ([Fig.](#page--1-37) [15.11](#page--1-37)). Other sites of origin include the RA (18%), the LV (4%), and the right ventricle (RV) (4%). More than one site can occur in an individual patient (5% of cases).

**Fig. 15.9 Renal cell carcinoma.** TEE imaging in a patient with renal cell carcinoma showing the extension into the RA *(arrows)* from the inferior vena cava without involvement of the atrial wall, septum, or valves. *Ao,* Aorta.

The clinical presentation of a cardiac myxoma includes constitutional symptoms (fever, malaise), clinically evident embolic events, and symptoms of mitral valve obstruction. A myxoma also may be an unexpected finding on a study requested for other clinical indications.

An LA myxoma varies in size from very small to nearly completely filling the LA chamber [\(Fig. 15.12](#page--1-38)), with prolapse of the tumor mass across the mitral annulus into the LV in diastole (accounting for the tumor "plop" on auscultation). The mass often has an irregular shape characterized by protruding "fronds" of tissue or a "grape cluster" appearance. The echogenicity of the mass typically is nonhomogeneous, sometimes with areas of calcification.

The degree to which the tumor causes functional obstruction to LV diastolic filling is evaluated qualitatively by color flow imaging and quantitatively by the pressure half-time method. Careful echocardiographic evaluation from multiple views, often including TEE, is needed in planning the surgical approach. Important goals of the echo examination are:

- To identify the site of tumor attachment
- To ensure that the tumor does not involve the valve leaflets themselves
- To exclude the possibility of multiple masses

Postoperatively, complete excision should be documented by echocardiography. Sequential long-term follow-up is indicated because recurrent myxomas have been reported, particularly with a familial form of this disease, with multiple myxomas, or with a less than full-thickness excision.

The echocardiographic approach to myxomas arising in other locations is similar to that described for LA myxomas, except that the imaging and Doppler examination are tailored to evaluating the specific region of tumor involvement in that patient. Again, a diagnosis based on clinical features, anatomic location, and echocardiographic appearance is only

presumptive until confirmed histologically. A "typical" myxoma may turn out to be a metastatic malignancy or a primary cardiac malignancy on pathologic examination. Hence the echocardiographic examination should be as complete as possible to exclude tissue invasion by the tumor, multiple sites of involvement, or atypical features.

A *papillary fibroelastoma* is a benign cardiac tumor that arises on valvular tissue, thus mimicking the appearance of a valvular vegetation. A papillary fibroelastoma appears as a small mass attached to the aortic or mitral valve with motion independent

**Fig. 15.11 TEE LA myxoma.** A mass *(M)* arising from a thin stalk *(arrow)* attached to the fossa ovalis of the interatrial septum is seen in a TEE view. *Ao,* Aorta

from the normal valve structures [\(Fig. 15.13\)](#page--1-39). Other attachment sites for a papillary fibroelastoma include the tricuspid or pulmonic valve and nonvalvular sites. Unlike a vegetation, a fibroelastoma is more often found on the downstream side of the valve (LV side of mitral valve, aortic side of aortic valve). The histologic appearance is very similar to that of the smaller Lambl excrescences, which can be seen on normal valves in older adults. Usually a small papillary fibroelastoma is of no clinical significance; the relationship of larger benign valve tumors to embolic events is controversial. In addition, some cases of superimposed thrombus formation resulting in systemic embolic events have been described. Often these tumors are better visualized on TEE imaging.

*Other benign cardiac* tumors seen in adults include hemangiomas and mesotheliomas of the atrioventricular node.

![](_page_8_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 15.12 TTE large LA myxoma.** A parasternal long-axis view (A) shows the tumor prolapsing into the mitral orifice in diastole, which results in functional mitral stenosis with only a narrow flow stream seen with color Doppler. In the apical view (B), the attachment to the septum *(arrow)* and the inhomogeneous echogenicity of the myxoma are seen. *Ao,* Aorta.

*Lipomatous hypertrophy* of the interatrial septum manifests as a cardiac mass that is often mistaken for a tumor. Lipomatous hypertrophy typically involves the superior and inferior fatty portions of the atrial septum and spares the fossa ovalis region ([Fig. 15.14\)](#page--1-40). However, symmetric ellipsoid enlargements of the interatrial septum also have been described. If the cause of atrial septal hypertrophy is unclear on echocardiography, CT scanning establishes the diagnosis of lipomatous hypertrophy by showing the characteristic radiographic density of adipose tissue.

#### *Malignant Primary Cardiac Tumors*

Malignant primary cardiac tumors are rare. In adults, angiosarcomas [\(Fig. 15.15\)](#page--1-41), rhabdomyosarcomas [\(Fig.](#page--1-42) [15.16](#page--1-42)), mesotheliomas, and fibrosarcomas are seen (see [Table 15.1\)](#page--1-25). The clinical presentation is variable, ranging from an "incidental" finding on echocardiography or nonspecific systemic symptoms (fever, malaise, fatigue) to signs and symptoms of cardiac tamponade. Because metastatic disease is far more likely than a primary cardiac origin, thorough evaluation must include a search for potential primary sites. Ultimately, the diagnosis depends on examination of tissue from the cardiac mass.

The echocardiographic examination focuses on:

- The anatomic location and extent of the tumor involvement
- The physiologic consequences of the tumor (e.g., valvular regurgitation, chamber obliteration, obstruction) (see [Fig. 15.16\)](#page--1-42)

■ Associated findings (pericardial effusion, evidence of tamponade physiology)

Along with other imaging techniques, the echocardiographic examination helps guide therapy by determining whether the tumor is resectable or whether palliative cardiac procedures are likely to be beneficial. Specific attention also is directed toward possible involvement of the valves, coronary arteries, or conduction system.

# Technical Considerations and Alternate Approaches

Although echocardiography has definite advantages for evaluating cardiac tumors, it has significant disadvantages as well. These include (1) poor acoustic access, resulting in suboptimal image quality, which limits the confidence with which tumor location and extent can be defined or results in a missed diagnosis (TEE imaging obviates this limitation in some patients); (2) the need for a careful and meticulous examination to detect and evaluate fully the cardiac tumor (as for other applications, echocardiography is operator dependent, and a significant learning curve for obtaining optimal data can be observed); and (3) the limited "field of view" inherent in echocardiography (i.e., structures adjacent to the heart in the mediastinum and lung are difficult to evaluate). Other tomographic imaging techniques, specifically CT and CMR, have the advantage of a wide field of view, so the relationship between cardiac and extracardiac tumor involvement can be evaluated. Often judicious use of both

This appearance is typical of a papillary fibroelastoma. *Ao,* Aorta.

echocardiographic techniques (to assess cardiac involvement in detail and to evaluate the physiologic consequences of the tumor mass) and CT or CMR (to assess potential extracardiac involvement) is needed in an individual patient for optimal clinical decision making. CT and CMR provide data on the tissue characteristics of the abnormal mass, which currently cannot be obtained with echocardiography [\(Fig. 15.17](#page--1-43)).

### LEFT VENTRICULAR THROMBUS

# Predisposing Conditions

Thrombus formation in the LV tends to occur in regions of blood stasis or low-velocity blood flow. The most familiar example of blood flow stasis in the LV is a ventricular aneurysm, in which low-velocity swirling blood flow patterns are seen. Stasis also occurs with less severe segmental wall motion abnormalities (e.g., apical akinesis) and with diffuse LV dysfunction (e.g., dilated cardiomyopathy). LV thrombus formation is extremely rare in the absence of an akinetic or dyskinetic apex or diffuse LV dysfunction. Thrombus formation also often accompanies an LV pseudoaneurysm. In this case, the thrombus lines an area of LV rupture that has been contained by the pericardium (see Figs. 8.25 and 8.26).

Even when a definite LV thrombus is not seen on echocardiographic examination, the likelihood of thrombus formation remains high in patients with LV aneurysm, apical akinesis, or diffuse LV systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction less than 20%. Doppler analysis of apical flow patterns has been suggested to help identify which of these patients are at the highest risk of thrombus formation. Evidence of apical flow stasis or of continuous swirling of flow around the apex is thought to identify patients at particular risk for apical thrombus.

# Identification of Left Ventricular Thrombi

The sensitivity and specificity of echocardiography for detecting LV thrombi are high, about 95% and 85% to 90% respectively. A careful and thorough examination requires not only standard views but also angulated apical views and the use of higherfrequency, short-focus transducers to improve near-field resolution. It is advantageous to use a 5- or 7.5-MHz transducer from the standard apical four-chamber

window and also to move the transducer slightly laterally while angulating it anteriorly to obtain an apical short-axis view. Scanning across the apex in several views usually allows for the distinction of apical thrombi from prominent apical trabeculations or false tendons, which are bright linear structures that attach to mural trabeculae. A thrombus is often (although not always) more echogenic than the underlying myocardium and has a contour distinct from the endocardial border. Contrast opacification of the LV improves the diagnosis of apical thrombus and should be considered when clinical or imaging findings raise this concern.

The diagnosis of LV thrombus is most secure when an echogenic mass is seen with a convex surface that is not a "ring-down" artifact, is clearly distinct from the endocardium, and is located in a region of abnormal wall motion ([Fig. 15.18\)](#page--1-34). The diagnosis of laminated thrombus is more difficult unless a clear demarcation between the thrombus and the underlying myocardium is seen, but it can be suspected when the apex appears "rounded" and akinetic, with apparent excessively thick apical myocardium.

# Clinical Implications

The presence of an LV thrombus on echocardiographic examination is a strong predictor of subsequent embolic events, particularly when the thrombus protrudes into the ventricular cavity or shows independent mobility. Sessile, nonprotruding thrombi may have lower embolic potential. In some cases, apical images are suboptimal despite careful examination technique and use of left-sided contrast. In this situation, a definite exclusion of apical thrombus is not possible.

# Alternate Approaches

Transthoracic echocardiography is the clinical procedure of choice for the identification of LV thrombi. TEE imaging rarely is helpful. Although specificity is high (about 96%), sensitivity is very low (only about 40%) because the apex often is missed in standard

image planes and is at a considerable distance from the transducer, thereby limiting resolution of structural detail. LV contrast angiography and radionuclide ventriculography both have low sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing LV thrombus. In the research setting, gamma-camera imaging of indium-114–labeled platelets has shown a high specificity, but this approach is not available for routine clinical use. Contrast-enhanced CMR has very high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of LV thrombus and may be appropriate in selected patients (see Appendix B, Table B.20).

#### LEFT ATRIAL THROMBUS

#### Predisposing Factors

LA thrombi tend to form in the presence of stasis of blood flow in the LA. In general, low-velocity flow in the LA is associated with:

- Atrial enlargement
- Mitral valve disease
- Atrial fibrillation

The highest incidence of LA thrombus is in patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis and atrial fibrillation. However, in the presence of mitral stenosis or poor LV function, even patients in sinus rhythm and those with only modest LA enlargement can have LA thrombi. LA thrombi are less common in patients with mitral regurgitation, presumably because the high-velocity regurgitant jet mechanically disrupts the area of blood stasis within the LA.

# Identification of Left Atrial Thrombi

Visualization of LA thrombi using transthoracic echocardiography is limited by two factors:

- 1. The LA is in the far field of the image from both parasternal and apical windows, thus limiting resolution of LA structures and possible thrombi.
- 2. Large percentages of LA thrombi are found in the LA appendage, which is difficult to image from the transthoracic approach.

TEE imaging has a high sensitivity and a high negative predictive value for the diagnosis of LA thrombi. Hence, TEE evaluation is the appropriate procedure when the presence or absence of LA thrombus is important for patient management. From the TEE approach, the LA lies close to the transducer, and the appendage can be visualized using a 7.5-MHz transducer in at least two orthogonal views. Optimally, the LA appendage is evaluated by centering the appendage in the image plane at the 0° or 60° transducer position by using a small field of view and a high-frequency transducer. Then, simultaneous biplane images are acquired, and if needed, the image plane is slowly rotated through 180°, keeping the atrial appendage centered in the image, to evaluate for a possible thrombus. In addition, the body of the LA and atrial septal region are evaluated using rotational scanning from 0° to 180° from a high esophageal position [\(Fig. 15.19](#page--1-30)).

Stasis of blood flow appears on TEE imaging as "spontaneous" echo contrast, that is, echogenic reflections from the low-velocity blood flow look like

**Fig. 15.19 LA appendage thrombus.** In this 45-year-old woman with severe mitral stenosis who was referred for balloon valvotomy, orthogonal images of the LA appendage show an irregular mass *(arrows)* consistent with atrial thrombus.

**Fig. 15.20 Spontaneous contrast in the LA.** Biplane 2D TEE images in a patient with atrial fibrillation and rheumatic mitral stenosis show swirling echodensities *(arrows)* in the LA. *SVC,* Superior vena cava.

white swirls on the echocardiographic image ([Fig.](#page--1-44) [15.20](#page--1-44)). Although the appearance of "spontaneous" contrast depends on technical factors such as transducer frequency and instrument gain, in addition to the pattern of blood flow, this finding is associated with an increased risk of LA thrombus formation and embolic complications.

Doppler recordings of the pattern of blood flow in the LA appendage are helpful in identifying patients at highest risk of thrombus formation ([Fig.](#page--1-45) [15.21](#page--1-45)). With a pulsed Doppler sample volume positioned approximately 1 cm from the entry of the appendage into the body of the LA, a normal contraction velocity is about 0.4 m/s; values less than this are associated with an increased risk of thrombus formation.

In some patients, the LA appendage is visualized from a transthoracic parasternal approach, starting in the short-axis view at the aortic valve level and angulating the transducer inferiorly and laterally to demonstrate the triangular appendage just inferior to the pulmonary artery. From the apical two-chamber view, the LA appendage is visualized by slight superior angulation of the transducer. If a discrete echogenic mass is seen in the LA of a patient with mitral stenosis and atrial fibrillation, the specificity of this finding for LA thrombi is high [\(Fig. 15.22\)](#page--1-46). However, the sensitivity of transthoracic echocardiography for the detection of LA thrombus is very poor. If *no* LA thrombus is seen in a patient in whom the diagnosis is suspected, a transthoracic study certainly does *not* exclude this possibility.

![](_page_14_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 15.21 LA appendage blood flow patterns.** LA appendage flow can be recorded with a pulsed Doppler sample volume positioned about 1 cm into the appendage on TEE imaging. In a patient with atrial flutter *(top),* flow with a velocity greater than 40 cm/s into and out of the atrial appendage is present at a rate of 300/min. In sinus rhythm *(bottom),* normal flow shows a velocity >40 cm/s toward the transducer with atrial contraction following the electrocardiographic P wave. In contrast, when atrial fibrillation is present (see [Fig. 15.23\)](#page--1-47), only very low flow velocities with an irregular pattern are seen, thus leading to stasis of blood in the atrial appendage.

The importance of an LA thrombus depends on the clinical setting. In a patient with new atrial fibrillation and an embolic stroke, the most likely cause of the stroke is an LA thrombus whether or not one is actually imaged, and thus the demonstration of an LA thrombus would be unlikely to change clinical management. In contrast, in a patient with rheumatic mitral stenosis, the presence of an LA thrombus is a contraindication to mitral balloon valvotomy. Evaluation for LA thrombus by TEE is frequently performed before elective cardioversion and before interventional and electrophysiology procedures in which catheters or devices will be placed in the LA, for example, mitral valvuloplasty or atrial fibrillation ablation ([Fig.](#page--1-47) [15.23](#page--1-47)).

Prognosis and Clinical Implications

# Alternate Approaches

Although few direct comparisons of echocardiography versus CT or CMR have been performed, these imaging modalities also have a high sensitivity for the detection of LA thrombus. Intracardiac echocardiography is useful for evaluation of LA thrombus at the time of an invasive procedure.

# RIGHT-SIDED HEART THROMBI

Formation of thrombi in the right side of the heart is rare, although it has been reported in cases of severe RV dilation and systolic dysfunction. The more likely origin of thrombi seen within the right side of the heart is a peripheral venous thrombus that has embolized and become entrapped in the tricuspid valve apparatus or RV trabeculations during passage from the peripheral veins toward the pulmonary artery [\(Fig. 15.24](#page--1-27)). Thrombi also frequently form on

(Bottom)* Pulsed Doppler shows low velocity irregular velocities into and out of the appendage consistent with atrial fibrillation.

indwelling catheters or pacer wires. Although thrombi in the right side of the heart are sometimes seen with meticulous transthoracic imaging ([Fig. 15.25\)](#page--1-48), TEE is better able to resolve the presence, extent, and attachment of right-sided heart thrombi.

When mobile echogenic targets are seen within the right heart chambers, it is important to distinguish thrombi from Eustachian valve remnants, microbubbles, or reverberation artifacts. Eustachian valve remnants, which are persistent portions of the embryologic valves of the sinus venosus, are typically mobile, thin, linear structures attached at the junction of the inferior or superior cavae and the RA cavity. A Chiari network is the term used for larger remnants that extend the length of the RA from the inferior to superior vena cava or that cross the atrium, thus attaching to the fossa ovalis. Microbubbles, which are encapsulated gas bubbles that can be seen in patients with indwelling venous access, appear as discrete echogenic targets that are usually located in different parts of the heart during successive cycles.

#### CARDIAC SOURCE OF EMBOLUS

# Basic Principles

In a patient with a suspected cardiac origin of a systemic embolic event, echocardiographic evaluation is directed toward identification of:

■ Abnormal intracardiac masses (e.g., LV thrombus, LA tumor, valvular vegetation)

**Fig. 15.24 RA thrombus.** An echodensity *(arrows)* is seen on a subcostal view *(left)* and an apical four-chamber view *(right)*. This could be a thrombus in transit from a peripheral venous thrombosis.

**Fig. 15.25 Pulmonary embolism.** TTE view of the main pulmonary artery *(MPA)* with bifurcation into the right pulmonary artery and left pulmonary artery *(LPA)* demonstrates an echodensity nearly filling the right pulmonary artery *(arrow)* in this 63-year-old woman with recurrent pulmonary emboli who was referred for surgical thrombectomy.

- Abnormalities that predispose the patient to the development of intracardiac thrombi (e.g., LV aneurysm, mitral stenosis, atrial flow stasis)
- Cardiac abnormalities that serve as a potential conduit for systemic embolism (e.g., patent foramen ovale, atrial septal defect)
- Aortic atheroma, with or without protruding thrombus

Note that echocardiographic evaluation *after* an index embolic event may fail to demonstrate a cardiac thrombus even if it was the cause of the clinical event because now the thrombus has embolized and is no longer in the heart. Recurrent intracardiac thrombus formation may not yet have occurred.

# Identifiable Cardiac Sources of Emboli

In patients with an abnormal intracardiac mass on echocardiography in the aftermath of a recent systemic embolic event, the likelihood is very high that a portion of the mass embolized, thereby causing the clinical event. Cardiac masses known to be associated with clinical systemic embolic events include:

- Valvular vegetations
- LV and LA thrombi
- Cardiac tumors (especially LA myxomas)

In patients with suspected systemic embolic events, a definite cardiac source is documented by transthoracic echocardiography in approximately 10% to 15% of sequential cases. To some extent, the low prevalence of a definite source may relate to imaging *after* the event (when the mass is no longer in the heart). Conversely, in many patients the source of embolus was outside the heart (e.g., atheromas with or without superimposed thrombus in the carotid arteries or ascending aorta), or the intracardiac thrombi embolized soon after formation. In this latter group, it is particularly important to search for conditions that predispose the patient to intracardiac thrombus formation, even though an intracardiac thrombus is not identified at the time of the examination.

# Predisposing Conditions

*Apical aneurysms* have a high incidence of associated thrombus formation. Other segmental wall motion abnormalities and diffuse LV systolic dysfunction also predispose to LV thrombus formation. An LV *pseudoaneurysm* is almost invariably accompanied by a thrombus lining the pseudoaneurysm cavity.

*Rheumatic mitral stenosis* is associated with LA thrombus formation. *Atrial fibrillation,* even when it occurs without coexisting mitral valve disease, is strongly associated with systemic embolic events, presumably because of LA thrombi. In a patient with a systemic embolic event and either paroxysmal or sustained atrial fibrillation, LA thrombus formation is so likely that even if TEE echocardiography fails to demonstrate an LA clot, it still is appropriate to treat the patient with systemic anticoagulants to prevent recurrent atrial thrombus formation.

Intracardiac thrombi occur in patients with *congenital heart disease*, particularly those with atrial dilation or ventricular dysfunction. Patients with a large atrial septal defect are at risk for "paradoxical" systemic embolization of peripheral venous thrombi. Thrombi can pass from the RA to the LA even when the shunt is predominantly left to right owing to streaming of flow or transient shifts in the RA-to-LA pressure gradient. Patients with Eisenmenger complex and a large ventricular septal defect are at risk of systemic embolization from peripheral venous thrombus formation. However, paradoxical embolization is unlikely in adults with a small ventricular septal defect because the high LV, compared with RV, pressure limits flow from right to left.

*Prosthetic valves* are other potential sources of embolic events; the incidence of clinical events is higher with mechanical valves compared with that of tissue valves. Demonstration of small thrombi on prosthetic valves is difficult even with TEE imaging because of shadowing and reverberations from the prosthetic leaflets and the sewing ring. Hence, the diagnosis often is presumptive when evidence exists of suboptimal anticoagulation at the time of the event or when other causes for the clinical event have been excluded even if the level of anticoagulation appears to have been adequate. In these patients, the primary goals of the echocardiographic examination are to assess prosthetic valve function (because significant thrombus often results in stenosis, regurgitation, or both) and to exclude other intracardiac sources of thrombus formation (e.g., associated LV systolic dysfunction).

TEE echocardiography provides imaging of atrial structures in more detail and has led to the recognition of other anatomic variants and disease processes that may be associated with systemic embolic events including:

- Patent foramen ovale
- Interatrial septal aneurysm
- A swirling pattern of blood flow in the LA in the absence of an exogenous "contrast" agent (thought to represent flow stasis and often called *spontaneous contrast*)
- Atherosclerosis in the aorta

A *patent foramen ovale* is present in 25% to 35% of unselected patients at autopsy. During fetal development, incomplete closure of the interatrial septum shunts oxygenated placental blood from the RA to the LA and then to the brain. This potential interatrial communication fuses within the first few days after birth in most individuals. If the flap valve covering the fossa ovalis remains unfused, usually no passage of blood occurs across the interatrial septum. The "flap" is functionally closed because LA pressure normally exceeds RA pressure. However, if RA pressure transiently exceeds LA pressure (as during a cough or the Valsalva maneuver) or if RA pressure chronically exceeds LA pressure (e.g., after pulmonary embolization or with chronic lung disease), right-to-left passage of blood (or thrombi) can occur across the interatrial septum.

An *interatrial septal aneurysm* is defined as a transient bulging of the fossa ovalis region of the interatrial septum (total excursion from the septal plane) greater than 15 mm in the absence of chronically elevated LA or RA pressure. Septal aneurysms are associated with a high likelihood (up to 90%) of associated fenestration.

Echocardiographic demonstration of a patent foramen ovale is possible with color flow Doppler imaging from a TEE approach in only about 5% to 10% of patients, with a lesser number detected by transthoracic color Doppler imaging. Detection of a patent foramen is enhanced by intravenous injection of echo-contrast material (e.g., agitated saline solution), thereby providing opacification of the right-sided heart structures [\(Fig. 15.26\)](#page--1-49).

A saline contrast study for the detection of patent foramen ovale should:

- Use a view where contrast in the right heart will not shadow the LA
- Demonstrate contrast in the left heart within three beats of appearance in the right heart
- Record a longer digital clip to ensure correct timing of contrast appearance
- Perform at least two saline contrast injections (one at rest and one with Valsalva)
- Consider TEE whether the diagnosis could change clinical management

Using an echo-contrast agent, a patent foramen ovale is detectable at rest in approximately 5% of the general population. When maneuvers to increase RA pressure transiently are performed simultaneously with contrast injection, the prevalence of detectable patent foramen ovale by contrast TEE echocardiography increases to approximately 25%, similar to the incidence at autopsy [\(Fig. 15.27\)](#page--1-50).

Passage of very small microbubbles through the pulmonary capillaries can occur with a peripheral injection of agitated saline; microbubbles from transpulmonary passage typically appear in the LA via the pulmonary veins late after the appearance of contrast material in the RA. With an atrial septal

**Fig. 15.26 Patent foramen ovale on TTE saline contrast study.** In an apical four-chamber view, the RA and RV are opacified by saline contrast injected into an arm. A few microbubbles *(arrow)* are seen in the left side of the heart within three beats of the appearance of contrast in the right heart.

defect or patent foramen ovale, contrast material appears in the LA within three beats of its appearance in the right heart ([Fig. 15.28\)](#page--1-51).

*"Spontaneous" contrast* is seen in the LA in the presence of stasis of blood flow. It is seen more often on TEE than on transthoracic imaging because of the higher transducer frequency and the closer proximity of the LA when interrogated from the esophagus, but it can be seen on transthoracic imaging in some patients. Spontaneous contrast is associated with LA enlargement and LA thrombus formation, and it may be a marker for a "prethrombotic" state in which definite atrial thrombi are not seen. In extreme cases of spontaneous contrast in patients with mitral stenosis, the jet of diastolic blood flow across the stenotic mitral orifice can be seen on two-dimensional (2D) imaging because of the contrast effect.

Spontaneous contrast also can be seen in the LV when stasis of blood flow is present, such as in the region of an apical aneurysm. Spontaneous contrast is observed frequently in patients with mechanical prosthetic valves. Here the mechanism of spontaneous contrast formation is different, relating to the mechanical impact of the valve occluder during closure resulting in microcavitation or the liberation of gas from solution. Of course, patients with mitral prosthetic valves also have some degree of stasis of blood flow in the LA if long-standing disease has resulted in LA enlargement and atrial fibrillation.

This is a useful view to evaluate for patent foramen ovale (B), demonstrated with color Doppler in this patient by showing a narrow jet across the patent foramen *(arrow)* from the RA to the LA.

**Fig. 15.28 Patent foramen ovale on TEE saline contrast study.** The RA is opacified by saline contrast with a few microbubbles seen in the LA after Valsalva maneuver, consistent with a patent foramen ovale.

The presence of *atheroma* in the descending thoracic aorta is associated with an increased risk of stroke and transient ischemic attack. These lesions are recognized as focal areas of increased thickness in the aortic endothelium with irregular borders and nonuniform echogenicity. An atheroma is considered "complex" if thickness is greater than 4 mm, evidence of ulceration is noted, or areas of independent mobility are present.

## Indications for Echocardiography in Patients With Systemic Embolic Events

Current understanding of potential cardiac causes for systemic embolism is incomplete, and considerable controversy exists about the indications for transthoracic imaging and TEE in patients with suspected systemic embolic events [\(Table 15.4\)](#page--1-52). In patients with embolic events, the prevalence of patent foramen ovale is about 30%, compared with a prevalence of 10% in control subjects. Aortic atheromas (see Chapter 16) are seen in 20% of patients with embolic events, compared with 4% of control subjects. Other echocardiographic findings in patients with embolic events include LA

thrombus in approximately 9%, spontaneous contrast in approximately 17%, and atrial septal aneurysm in 13%. The prevalence of these findings is highest in patients with cryptogenic stroke (e.g., no obvious primary cerebrovascular disease or other cause).

Current guidelines suggest that transthoracic echocardiography with a saline contrast study is appropriate in patients with neurologic or other vascular occlusive events:

- When abrupt occlusion of a major peripheral or visceral artery occurs in patients of any age
- In younger patients (<55 years) with a cerebrovascular embolic event

- In older patients with a neurologic event without other evidence of cerebrovascular disease
- In patients in whom the clinical therapeutic decision would be altered based on the echocardiographic results

The role of echocardiography in older patients with cerebrovascular disease of questionable significance or with other evident causes for the cerebrovascular event remains uncertain. If transthoracic studies are unrevealing, TEE imaging should be performed, given its higher sensitivity for diagnosis of a patent foramen ovale, LA thrombus, interatrial septal aneurysm, valvular vegetation, and small intracardiac tumors ([Table 15.5](#page--1-25)).

- • Routine surveillance of uncomplicated IE when no change in management is contemplated
- • Suspected pulmonary embolism to establish diagnosis
- • Routine surveillance of prior pulmonary embolism with normal RV function and pulmonary artery systolic pressure

#### **Transesophageal Echocardiography**

- • As initial or supplemental test for evaluation for cardiovascular source of embolus with no identified noncardiac source
- • As initial or supplemental test to diagnose IE with a moderate or high pre-test probability (e.g., Staphylococcus bacteremia, fungemia, prosthetic heart valve, or intracardiac device)
- • As initial test for evaluation to facilitate clinical decision making with regard to anticoagulation, cardioversion, and/or radiofrequency ablation
- • *Uncertain Indication: evaluation for cardiovascular source of embolus with a previously identified noncardiac source*
- • Evaluation for cardiovascular source of embolus with a known cardiac source in which TEE would not change management
- • Routine use of TEE when diagnostic TTE is reasonably anticipated to resolve all diagnostic and management concerns
- • Surveillance of prior TEE finding for interval change (e.g., resolution of thrombus after anticoagulation, resolution of vegetation after antibiotic therapy) when no change in therapy is anticipated
- • To diagnose IE with low pre-test probability (e.g., transient fever, known alternative source of infection, negative blood culture results, or atypical pathogen for endocarditis)
- • Evaluation when a decision has been made to anticoagulate and not to perform cardioversion
