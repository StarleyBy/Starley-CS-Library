chocardiography plays a key role in the management of patients undergoing cardiac procedures in the operating room, cardiac catheterization laboratory, and hybrid procedure suites. Echocardiographic approaches include transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), epicardial imaging, or intracardiac echocardiography, depending on the specific procedure and monitoring needs. TTE imaging typically is performed by a cardiac sonographer or noninvasive cardiologist, epicardial imaging by the cardiac surgeon, and intracardiac echocardiography is performed by the interventional cardiologist. Intraoperative or intraprocedural TEE typically is performed by appropriately trained cardiovascular anesthesiologists or cardiologists. E

The principles of diagnostic TEE and intraoperative TEE are identical in terms of image plane orientation, anatomic findings, and Doppler flow patterns (see Chapter 3). In addition, standard methods for the evaluation of ventricular systolic and diastolic function, valve dysfunction, congenital heart disease, and so on, as described in previous chapters, are also used for intraoperative TEE. Three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography is particularly important during monitoring of procedures in the operating room and is essential for guidance during some transcatheter procedures.

Typically, baseline TEE data are recorded after the induction of anesthesia but before cardiopulmonary bypass or beginning the interventional procedure. TEE data are again recorded after the surgical or transcatheter intervention and weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. As with diagnostic TEE, intraprocedural TEE provides images of great clarity and diagnostic value. However, intraprocedural TEE differs from standard diagnostic TEE in several respects:

- Time constraints often require a focused examination.
- Altered loading conditions affect the evaluation of valve and ventricular dysfunction.

This chapter provides an introduction to the basic principles and major clinical applications of intraoperative TEE. Echocardiographers who practice intraprocedural TEE should review training guidelines and refer to the additional books and articles included in the Suggested Reading at the end of this chapter [\(Table 18.1\)](#page--1-38). In addition, other imaging modalities often are used in the operating room (e.g., epicardial echocardiography) and in the interventional laboratory (e.g., fluoroscopy or intracardiac echocardiography) for procedural guidance (see Chapter 4).

## BASIC PRINCIPLES

## Indications

The indications for intraprocedural TEE range from basic monitoring of cardiovascular function to evaluation of function after complex intracardiac surgical repairs [\(Table 18.2\)](#page--1-39). In addition to traditional surgical approaches in the operating room with full cardiopulmonary bypass, TEE now also is used with alternate surgical and transcatheter approaches. The role of TEE has become more important as imaging replaces direct visualization of cardiac structure and function.

# Preoperative Diagnosis

For elective surgical and transcatheter procedures, the diagnosis and surgical plan should be determined before the operative date [\(Fig. 18.1](#page--1-40)). Often, diagnostic TEE is performed as part of surgical planning in addition to other diagnostic imaging studies, such as coronary angiography, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, or computed tomography (CT). This allows time to review and discuss the diagnostic data, resolve any apparent discrepancies, and obtain additional data, as needed. In addition, the surgical options can be reviewed and discussed with the patient.

Preoperative assessment is particularly important for valvular and congenital heart disease, both for technical and physiologic reasons. From a technical point of view, valve stenosis is best evaluated by TTE imaging, which allows multiple interrogation angles to ensure that the maximum jet velocity is recorded. On TEE, the constraints in transducer position often result in underestimation of stenosis severity. From a physiologic point of view, the altered loading conditions during anesthesia frequently result in underestimation of regurgitant severity, for example, if afterload is reduced.

Even when the preoperative diagnostic evaluation is complete, baseline intraprocedural TEE is important to:

- Confirm the diagnosis
- Provide additional information on valve repairability
- Serve as a baseline comparison for the postprocedure study
- Check for other abnormalities
- Monitor left ventricular (LV) function

In elective cases, when unexpected findings are present on the baseline intraprocedural TEE, management is individualized based on the specific findings and the urgency of the procedure. Usually, the surgical procedure can be modified as needed; for example, closure of an incidental patent foramen ovale at the time of mitral valve repair. However, major unexpected findings may require consultation with the patient's primary cardiologist or rescheduling of the procedure.

In emergency cases, the intraprocedural TEE recorded before cardiopulmonary bypass sometimes is the primary diagnostic study. For example, with an acute aortic dissection, promptly transferring the patient to the operating room and obtaining TEE images quickly after the induction of anesthesia may be optimal. In these situations, the echocardiographer should ensure that the diagnosis is correct, evaluate for complications, and promptly communicate this information to the surgeon.

# Hemodynamics

Assessment of cardiac hemodynamics and ventricular function in the operating room is affected by:

- Positive pressure mechanical ventilation
- Volume status
- Myocardial "stunning" secondary to aortic cross-clamping
- Effects of cardiopulmonary bypass
- Pharmacologic therapy

Typically, general anesthesia is provided by inhalational agents with supplemental opioids and muscle relaxants, all of which alter preload and afterload. Many agents impair myocardial contractility, decrease systemic vascular resistance, or both. During weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, vasodilators or vasopressors may be used to maintain a normal systemic vascular resistance, and inotropic agents may be used if ventricular systolic function is impaired. Positive pressure ventilation at baseline and after cardiopulmonary bypass reduces systemic venous return because of the increase in intrathoracic pressure; this effect is most pronounced when ventricular filling volumes

**Fig. 18.1 Flow chart illustrating integration of intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography into clinical decision making.**

are low. The combination of changes in preload, afterload, and contractility result in variation in the severity of valve regurgitation ([Fig. 18.2](#page--1-41)). Antegrade velocities and pressures gradients also vary with volume flow rates.

TEE images and Doppler data optimally are recorded at loading conditions similar to those in the patient's baseline state and with matched loading conditions on the baseline and post–cardiopulmonary bypass studies. Basic parameters, such as heart rate and blood pressure, should be recorded on the echocardiographic images to ensure comparable loading conditions, with measures of systemic vascular resistance, filling pressures, and cardiac output also noted, when possible. After the patient is weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass, preload on the postbypass study is optimized with volume infusion, often by using TEE images of LV size as a measure of LV filling status, and afterload is adjusted using pharmacologic agents as needed, to match the baseline study.

# Surgical Manipulation and Instrumentation

During an open cardiac surgical procedure, the effects of surgical manipulation are directly observable on the TEE images ([Fig. 18.3\)](#page--1-42). For example, if the left atrial (LA) appendage was inverted during a mitral valve repair procedure, the inverted appendage sometimes appears as a "mass" in the LA that disappears when the appendage resumes its normal shape. Cannulas for cardiopulmonary bypass are visualized to confirm correct positioning but also result in shadowing and reverberations that limit the evaluation of cardiac function. Infusion of cardioplegia results

in a contrast effect with increased echogenicity of the perfused myocardium. Intracardiac air related to the open surgical procedure has a characteristic bright appearance, so that TEE imaging helps ensure that no residual intracardiac air is present at the end of the procedure [\(Fig. 18.4](#page--1-43)). Electronic interference from electrocautery creates an artifact on TEE images and disrupts the color Doppler signal.

## Time Constraints

A complete systematic TEE examination is recommended during intraprocedural evaluation whenever possible. However, when clinical urgency limits the time available for imaging, the data needed are prioritized, and the most important images and Doppler data are recorded first, with care taken to ensure that adequate data are recorded for any clinical decision making. Most patients have had a complete diagnostic study before entering the operating room so that the baseline intraprocedural TEE focuses on the views needed for comparison to the postprocedure images.

Quantitative approaches that are simple and fast are preferred over more complex methods, when possible. For example, valve regurgitation quantitation by measurement of vena contracta width is similar and faster than optimizing the proximal isovelocity signal or comparing volume flow rates across the regurgitant valve and a normal valve. LV ejection fraction most often is visually estimated, rather than tracing end-diastolic and end-systolic borders for a biplane ejection fraction calculation. 3D image acquisition with semiautomated border detection facilitates

quantitative evaluation of LV function. The use of simultaneous imaging in two planes ([Fig. 18.5\)](#page--1-44) and the use of simultaneous two-dimensional (2D) imaging and color Doppler helps minimize the exam time while enabling the echocardiographer to acquire a complete image set. Once images are obtained, the echocardiographer also needs to be cognizant of any limitations in the data and communicate those issues to the surgeon. If the echocardiographic data are essential for decision making, adequate time for imaging without electronic artifacts needs to be provided.

# ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC APPROACH

## Views

The primary goal of an intraprocedural TEE exam is to address the specific clinical issue in that patient, so a focused examination is appropriate in many situations. However, a complete examination requires only a few minutes and is recommended whenever possible [\(Table 18.3\)](#page--1-39). The American Society of Echocardiography and the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists recommend a standard series of 20 2D views that are supplemented by 3D imaging [\(Fig.](#page--1-45) [18.6\)](#page--1-45) and Doppler data . Each view is recorded as a 2-second cine loop, so all these images can be recorded within 10 minutes by an experienced operator, even assuming an average of 30 seconds to obtain each view. Additional time is needed for the evaluation of abnormal findings, color and Doppler spectral recordings, and discussions among the anesthesiologist, surgeon, and cardiologist.

Quantitation of LV systolic function using the biplane apical approach with 2D imaging or 3D LV volumes is recommended when time allows ([Fig. 18.7](#page--1-46)). In addition, 3D volumetric imaging now is routine in views appropriate for the specific diagnosis and procedure, for example, 3D imaging of the interatrial septum in a patient undergoing atrial septal defect closure or 3D imaging of the mitral valve in patient with mitral regurgitation who is undergoing a transcatheter valve procedure.

In addition to imaging data, a screening Doppler study is recommended. A basic intraprocedural TEE includes color Doppler evaluation for regurgitation of the aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valves in at least two orthogonal views. Evaluation of the pulmonic valve is more difficult and is needed only in specific situations, such as congenital pulmonic valve disease, after cardiac transplantation, or with right ventricular (RV) assist device placement. Additional Doppler data recordings are tailored to the specific clinical indication. For example, when significant regurgitation is present, additional color Doppler data, such as vena contracta, are recorded. Color Doppler also allows detection of intracardiac shunts, including a patent foramen ovale. Continuous-wave (CW) Doppler recordings are helpful for the evaluation of valve stenosis and regurgitation and for the estimation of pulmonary pressures, if a pulmonary artery catheter has not been placed.

Doppler recordings are used to evaluate LA filling via the pulmonary veins, LV diastolic filling, and atrial appendage function.

## Sequence

Several sequences of image acquisition are possible, and all are appropriate as long as the needed diagnostic images are obtained. Some echocardiographers prefer to obtain all the views from each transducer position:

- Mid-esophageal
- Transgastric
- Upper esophageal

This approach minimizes the time needed for acquisition and is easy to remember.

**Fig. 18.7 Assessment of left ventricular function.** Surrogates for LV function are presented in a patient before and after cardiopulmonary bypass. In the *top three panels,* circumferential strain *(left),* end-diastolic are *(EDA)* and end-systolic area *(ESA; center)* and LV outflow tract velocity-time integral *(VTI; right)* are obtained before bypass in a patient undergoing mitral valve replacement. In the *lower three panels,* the same measurements are made following a long pump run and aortic cross-clamp time. Decrements in all three parameters are seen. These returned toward baseline with time and following institution of resuscitative measures. *EDA,* End-diastolic area; *ESA,* end-systolic area; *FAC,* fractional area of change. *(From Oxorn DC: Intraoperative and procedural echocardiography: basic principles. In Otto CM, editor:* The Practice of Clinical Echocardiography, *ed 5, Philadelphia, 2017, Elsevier, Fig. 4.6.)*

In this sequence, starting in a mid-esophageal four-chamber view with depth adjusted to show the entire LV, the image plane is rotated toward the two-chamber view and then the long-axis view (see Figs. 3.3, 3.7, and 3.9). The "mitral commissural" view describes a two-chamber plane in which both the medial and lateral commissures are seen, similar to the standard two-chamber view at about 60° rotation. An additional "two-chamber" view at about 90° rotation provides visualization of additional segments of the mitral valve and the LA appendage. These views also allow sequential evaluation of regional wall motion in the four-chamber view (inferior septum and lateral wall), the two-chamber view (inferior wall and anterior wall), and the long-axis view (posterior wall and anterior septum). A full-volume 3D acquisition allows measurement of LV ejection fraction, assessment of regional wall motion, and evaluation of global and regional longitudinal strain.

From the long-axis view, depth is decreased to focus on the aortic and mitral valves. Then the transducer is moved superiorly in the esophagus to visualize the ascending aorta, first in long axis (see Fig. 3.10), followed by rotation of the image plane to a short-axis view of the ascending aorta, with the pulmonary artery seen in long axis. The probe is advanced to a short-axis view of the aortic valve (see Fig. 3.13) and then the tricuspid and pulmonic valves. Turning the probe to the right with further rotation of the image plane yields the bicaval view of the right atrium (RA) (see Fig. 3.12). 3D real-time and multibeat volumetric images of the aortic and mitral valve are obtained from this probe position.

From the transgastric position, standard views include the short-axis views at the mid-LV and mitral valve levels, followed by rotation of the image plane to about 90° to show the two-chamber view (see Figs. 3.16 and 3.18). The probe is then turned rightward for a long-axis view, which includes the aorta, and an RV inflow view. From the deep transgastric position, an anteriorly angulated four-chamber view is obtained in some patients. The descending thoracic aorta is examined in sequential short-axis views from the level of the diaphragm to the arch, as the probe is slowly withdrawn in the esophagus. These short-axis views are supplemented with long-axis views at 90° rotation when abnormalities are seen. The arch is seen from an upper esophageal position by turning the image plane rightward, with a short-axis view obtained by rotation of the image plane.

Another approach is to evaluate each structure of interest in at least two orthogonal views, combining imaging, color, and spectral Doppler evaluations of each structure. With this approach, a complete examination includes:

- All four cardiac chambers (LV, RV, LA, RA)
- All four valves (aortic, mitral, tricuspid, pulmonic)
- Both great arteries (aorta, pulmonary artery)
- Systemic and pulmonary venous return (inferior vena cava, superior vena cava, four pulmonary veins)
- Atrial septum and LA appendage

This approach is useful with a focused examination, starting with the primary structures of interest and continuing on to evaluate other structures as time allows. Even when a different sequence of imaging is used, the anatomic approach also provides a quick checklist to ensure that every structure has been evaluated before the examination is completed. 3D imaging is integrated into the 2D imaging sequence with the 3D examination focused on the specific structure of interest, such as the mitral valve in patients undergoing mitral valve repair.

# Reporting and Image Storage

Intraprocedural TEE results are communicated directly to the surgeon at the time of data acquisition to facilitate prompt decision making. Intraprocedural TEE results should be available throughout the surgical procedure, verbally or in written format. In addition, a permanent written or electronic report that includes indications, a description of the procedure, and diagnostic findings should be included in the medical record. The report should indicate whether a comprehensive examination (most of the 20 recommended views) was recorded or whether it was a focused or limited examination to address a specific clinical issue. Intraprocedural TEE images and reports should be stored at each medical center in digital format with other echocardiographic images and reports to allow later review and comparison with subsequent studies.

## LIMITATIONS AND TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS

# Image Plane Orientation

As with any echocardiographic study, intraprocedural 2D TEE images should be aligned in standard image planes corresponding to long-axis, short-axis, fourchamber, and two-chamber views, with scanning between standard image planes to ensure a comprehensive study. 3D views also are recorded in standard orientations (see Chapter 4). Internal anatomic landmarks are used to define correct image alignment. The rotation angles provided in tables serve only as a guide to the typical angle needed for a given view; the actual rotation angle varies from patient to patient. In addition, individual variability in the anatomic relationship between the esophagus and the heart results in variability in image plane orientation, so correct alignment of views is not always possible.

# Doppler Interrogation Angle

A parallel alignment between the Doppler beam and blood flow of interest is not always possible on TEE imaging. The probe position is constrained by the anatomic relationship between the esophagus and the heart, so even with careful adjustment of transducer position and rotation of the image plane, the interrogation angle is typically still nonparallel, with potential underestimation of flow velocities. Intercept angle has a limited impact on the diagnostic value of color Doppler because the color Doppler flow image corresponds to the spatial pattern of the flow disturbance, even though exact velocities cannot be accurately measured. For spectral Doppler recordings, a near-parallel alignment is easily obtained by TEE for antegrade and regurgitant flow across the mitral valve [\(Fig. 18.8\)](#page--1-47) and for LA appendage and pulmonary vein flow. From a high esophageal position, flow in the pulmonary artery also can be recorded at a near-parallel intercept angle. However, alignment of the Doppler beam with the LV outflow tract and transaortic flow is problematic. On mid-esophageal views, parallel alignment is not possible. Sometimes better alignment can be obtained from a transgastric long-axis view or a deep transgastric anteriorly angulated four-chamber view. However, underestimation of velocity is likely and should be considered, particularly with TEE evaluation of aortic stenosis severity.

**Fig. 18.8 Transesophageal echocardiography quantitation of mitral regurgitation.** The orientation of the mitral regurgitant *(MR)* jet allows a parallel intercept angle between the ultrasound beam and the direction of blood flow. (A) Vena contracta width *(arrow)* is 2.6 mm for this central jet of functional regurgitation. (B) The CW Doppler regurgitant signal *(arrow)* is less dense than antegrade flow, which is also consistent with mild to moderate regurgitation.

# Technical Issues in the Operating Room and Interventional Suite

During intraoperative or intraprocedural TEE, the echocardiographer needs to be alert to interference or technical artifacts. Cannulas, catheters, and other devices cause acoustic shadows or reverberations, obscuring the structure or flow of interest [\(Fig. 18.9](#page--1-48)). Electronic interference from electrocautery or other procedures precludes diagnostic images or Doppler data [\(Fig. 18.10](#page--1-49)). If reverberations and shadowing cannot be avoided by repositioning the probe, alternate approaches, such as epicardial scanning with a sterile transducer, need to be considered. Electronic devices should be paused when possible to allow recording of echocardiographic data without interference artifacts.

# Optimization of Instrument Settings

Intraprocedural TEE is facilitated by presetting the instrument settings to optimize image recording with minimal additional adjustment of parameters during the examination. Images are recorded using one- or two-beat cine-loop image acquisition triggered to the QRS signal or by setting a fixed recording time (if the electrocardiogram signal is not adequate for consistent triggering).

Typically, the study is started with standard transducer frequency, depth, gain, processing, and

**Fig. 18.9 Shadowing and reverberations on transesophageal echocardiography.** The long-axis TEE view in a patient with endocarditis in a mechanical aortic valve prosthesis shows shadows and reverberations originating from the posterior aspect of the prosthetic valve *(yellow arrow)* extending in alternating bands *(between blue arrows)* of dark (shadows) and white (reverberations) to obscure more distal structures, including the anterior aspect of the valve and the LV outflow tract. *HR,* Heart rate.

**Fig. 18.10 Electronic artifact.** In a transgastric short-axis view, electronic artifact from the surgical cautery system not only creates a geometric artifact pattern but also obscures the 2D image. Doppler flow data are not reliable when electronic artifact is present. *HR,* Heart rate.

sector width settings. However, each of these parameters should be adjusted for optimal image recording during the TEE study. A higher transducer frequency (7 MHz) should be used to optimize resolution of near structures, such as the LA appendage, whereas lower frequencies (5 or 3.5 MHz) are needed for optimal penetration to visualize the LV apex in the four-chamber view or on transgastric views. Depth should be adjusted to show the structure of interest: for example, starting with a depth of 15 to 16 cm in the four-chamber view for ventricular function and then decreasing depth to just beyond the mitral valve for the examination of valve function [\(Fig. 18.11](#page--1-50)). Zoom mode provides improved image resolution and frame rate when examining the atrial appendage, the

**Fig. 18.11 Aortic valve in long axis.** The aortic valve and aortic sinuses are evaluated in a long-axis view using a shallow depth and zoom mode with a high transducer frequency to optimize image resolution. The origin of the right coronary artery *(RCA)* is seen *(arrow)*. *Ao,* Aorta; *HR,* heart rate.

aortic valve, or the mitral valve. Gain should be adjusted as needed based on image quality.

3D echocardiographic views are tailored to the specific clinical situation. Many operators find it helpful to begin with real-time 3D imaging, using a narrow sector and zoom mode to optimize frame rate. Gain settings are increased to fill in the structures of interest, and the image is rotated and cropped to show the pathology of interest. Additional acquisition of a four-beat full-volume dataset allows further cropping and analysis with higher-density image data.

With color Doppler imaging, the color sector is adjusted so that depth just includes the flows of interest, which allows a higher frame rate because of the shorter pulse-repetition frequency at a lesser depth. However, the color sector should always extend to the top of the image because frame rate is not improved by excluding this section of the image. Usually, color flow data are recorded initially with a relatively wide sector width to ensure that the spatial extent of the flow disturbance is visualized, with the sector width then narrowed to allow a higher frame rate. For vena contracta or proximal isovelocity surface area calculations, the color scale baseline and Nyquist limit also are adjusted to provide clear definition of the jet width and the proximal acceleration zone [\(Fig. 18.12](#page--1-51)).

Spectral Doppler is recorded using the same principles as those used for any Doppler recording. Gray-scale gain and low-pass ("wall") filters are adjusted to optimize the flow signal, the velocity scale is adjusted so the flow signal fits within but nearly fills the velocity range, the zero baseline is adjusted up or down depending on the flow of interest, and data are recorded with the time scale at 50 to 100 mm/s.

**Fig. 18.12 Aortic regurgitation vena contracta.** Measurement of vena contracta width *(arrows)* is most accurate using zoom mode to enlarge the area of interest. The image plane and color parameters are adjusted to show the proximal flow acceleration, the narrow vena contracta, and distal jet expansion. In this example, vena contracta width is 3 mm consistent with mild regurgitation. *Ao,* Aorta.

# CLINICAL UTILITY OF INTRAOPERATIVE TEE

Clinical applications of intraoperative and intraprocedural TEE continue to evolve as new surgical and percutaneous approaches are developed. Some of the current established indications are briefly discussed here as examples of the clinical utility of this approach. Echocardiographers performing TEE during surgical or percutaneous procedures should obtain additional training and consult reference sources as appropriate.

# Monitoring Ventricular Function

Intraoperative TEE is useful in high-risk patients undergoing cardiac or noncardiac surgical procedures [\(Table 18.4](#page--1-38)). Images of the LV provide continuous monitoring of:

- Ventricular preload (LV volume)
- Overall LV systolic function
- Regional LV function
- RV function

In general, the size of the ventricular chamber is a direct reflection of filling volume and can be used to optimize preload. Typically, ventricular size is evaluated qualitatively during the procedure, although a quick measurement of end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions provides a useful scale factor at baseline. In most patients, increases in filling volumes and pressures correlate with increases in ventricular volumes. Conversely, ventricular size is small, despite adequate filling pressures, in patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy, pericardial constraint, and severe right heart dysfunction or in high contractility states.

Overall systolic function is usually estimated visually in the transgastric short-axis view. The area change in ventricular size provides a quick and accurate visual correlate of ejection fraction (see Chapter 6). Although 2D or 3D measurements of ejection fraction are well validated and recommended at baseline, repeated measurements are not always feasible given the rapid time course of hemodynamic changes in the operating room. Similarly, although Doppler cardiac output measurements in the aorta or pulmonary artery can be reliably made, time factors make these approaches unrealistic. In addition, cardiac output typically is continuously monitored by right heart catheter techniques.

The transgastric short-axis view is also useful for monitoring regional ventricular function because it includes myocardium supplied by all three major coronary arteries [\(Fig. 18.13\)](#page--1-52). An acute change in regional ventricular function suggests coronary ischemia, although changes in regional wall motion are not always due to epicardial coronary disease. Other causes of regional dysfunction include hypovolemia, conduction defects, and myocardial stunning after cardiopulmonary bypass. TEE monitoring of ventricular function during interventions to reverse ischemia allow assessment of the effects of therapy. Evaluation of RV systolic function is important because dysfunction may occur due to inadequate cardioplegia or air embolism, which preferentially affects the right coronary artery when separating from cardiopulmonary bypass. Coronary ischemia in the distribution of a coronary bypass graft may also be due to mechanical occlusion or a kink in a vein graft or spasm of an internal mammary graft.

#### *Mitral Valve Repair*

In patients undergoing elective mitral valve repair, the baseline intraoperative TEE provides additional detailed 2D and 3D information on mitral valve anatomy and the mechanism and severity of regurgitation ([Fig. 18.14\)](#page--1-53). If needed, annular size is measured in four-chamber and long-axis views or with 3D imaging.

Even when a comprehensive preoperative examination has been done, the echocardiographer in the operating room needs to be familiar with, and record, images demonstrating the baseline pathology for comparison with the postrepair study. Standard terminology for mitral valve anatomy facilitates communication between the echocardiographer and the surgeon. The anterior and posterior leaflets meet at the medial and lateral valve commissures, with the posterior leaflet extending around more of the annulus than the anterior leaflet. The posterior mitral leaflet typically has three distinct scallops, which are labeled from the perspective of a surgeon looking at the valve from the LA side. Thus, posterior leaflet scallops are

In the mid-esophageal long-axis and commissural positions, dashed lines indicate the effect of turning the probe left (counterclockwise) or right (clockwise) from the standard positions. Using the annulus diameter and position of the LV apex as landmarks ensures that the long-axis view reliably visualizes the A2/P2 coaptive surface and the commissural view visualizes the A1/A2 and A3/P3 coaptive surfaces. In the mid-esophageal four-chamber view, dashed lines indicate the effect of withdrawing/anteflexing or advancing/retroflexing the probe from the standard position.

numbered from lateral (P1) to medial (P3), with central (P2) in the middle, with corresponding terms for the anterior leaflet.

Using rotational scanning from a mid-esophageal transducer position, both the four-chamber and longaxis views show the central (A2 and P2) scallops of both leaflets. As the image plane is rotated from 0° to 45°, first A3 and P1 are seen, and then, with further rotation, both P3 and P1 are seen in the "bicommissural view," typically at a rotation angle of 60° to 90°. In this view, both the medial and lateral commissures are seen, with the P3 and P1

posterior leaflet scallops at their attachments to the annulus. The central (A2) anterior leaflet scallop fills the center section of the annulus, and it moves in and out of the image during the cardiac cycle.

Another approach to the visualization of the mitral leaflet scallops is to start in the four-chamber view and then either tilt the image plane superiorly or slightly withdraw the probe, to show the more anterior or lateral scallops (A1 and P1), then tilt posteriorly or advance the probe to show the posterior or medial segments (A3 and P3). From the two-chamber or bicommissural plane, turning the image plane toward

the patient's right side shows all three scallops of the anterior leaflet, and turning leftward shows all three scallops of the posterior leaflet. Transgastric short-axis views at the mitral valve level also are helpful.

Mitral valve anatomy in patients undergoing surgical repair for mitral regurgitation is well visualized by 3D echocardiography [\(Fig. 18.15](#page-17-0)). The position of the TEE transducer posterior to the mitral valve, with the ultrasound imaging beam relatively perpendicular to the surface of the closed valve, results in excellent image quality and the ability to include the entire valve in the image field. As 3D imaging becomes widely available in formats that allow real-time or rapid image reconstruction, 3D imaging of the mitral valve likely will become the standard approach to evaluation in the operating room.

The mechanism of regurgitation in patients undergoing mitral valve repair most often is myxomatous disease, with fewer cases of rheumatic valve disease. With primary leaflet disease, anatomy is described for each leaflet segment in terms of thickness, redundancy, and motion, and any areas of calcification or chordal fusion and shortening are described. Prolapse describes motion of the leaflet into the LA in systole, with a curved shape in systole due to intact chordal attachments ([Fig. 18.16\)](#page--1-54). A flail segment indicates chordal rupture with the tip of the disrupted segment directed toward the LA in systole. Secondary mitral regurgitation often is due to ischemic disease. With secondary mitral regurgitation, leaflet motion typically is restricted with a tethering effect due to LV dilation and regional wall motion, which results in inadequate systolic leaflet coaptation. Restricted leaflet motion also is seen with rheumatic valve disease or with dilated cardiomyopathy.

Color Doppler imaging is helpful for determining the mechanism of mitral regurgitation. The origin of the regurgitant jet as it crosses the valve indicates the area of inadequate coaptation. The direction of the regurgitant jet in the atrium tends to be anterior with posterior leaflet dysfunction, posterior with anterior leaflet dysfunction, and central with functional regurgitation. Complex or multiple jets are seen when more than one mechanism of regurgitation is present.

Regurgitant severity is best evaluated before the patient is anesthetized in the operating room because of the potential effects of altered loading conditions. However, baseline measures of regurgitant severity are needed for comparison with the postrepair images. Jet size and shape are not reliable indicators of regurgitant severity because they are affected by many other factors, including driving pressure, chamber size and compliance, and cardiac rhythm. The recommended basic measurements of mitral regurgitant severity in the operating room are:

- Vena contracta width
- CW Doppler signal intensity relative to antegrade flow
- Pulmonary vein systolic flow reversal

A simple, reliable measure of regurgitant severity is vena contracta width, with the echocardiographer taking care to measure the narrowest diameter between the proximal jet acceleration on the ventricular side of the valve and the area of jet expansion in the LA. Accuracy is enhanced by using zoom images, a fast frame rate, and careful image alignment (see Chapter 12). The CW Doppler signal density compared with antegrade flow also provides a quick qualitative measure of regurgitant severity. Pulmonary vein systolic flow reversal indicates severe regurgitation in patients

**Fig. 18.16 Carpentier classification for leaflet dysfunction.** Type I dysfunction is defined as mitral regurgitation in the presence of normal leaflet motion. Examples include annular dilatation, leaflet perforation, and leaflet cleft. Type I dysfunction can also result from the combination of degenerative and secondary disease. Type II dysfunction refers to excessive leaflet motion. Examples include leaflet prolapse and flail due to degenerative disease. Type III dysfunction refers to restricted leaflet motion. Type IIIa is leaflet restriction that occurs predominantly in diastole. Examples include rheumatic disease, radiation-induced valvulopathy, and dystrophic calcification. Type IIIb is leaflet restriction that occurs predominantly in systole. Type IIIb may be symmetric or asymmetric. Examples include dilated cardiomyopathy (symmetric) and myocardial infarction (asymmetric). *(From Drake DH, Zimmerman KG, Sidebotham DA: Transesophageal echocardiography for surgical repair of mitral regurgitation. In Otto CM, editor:* The Practice of Clinical Echocardiography, *ed 5, Philadelphia, 2017, Elsevier, Fig. 19.2.)*

in sinus rhythm, although interrogation of all four pulmonary veins is needed with eccentric jets. In nonsinus rhythms, the pulmonary vein flow pattern is altered because of the rhythm and is not an accurate reflection of regurgitant severity. If further quantitation is needed, the proximal isovelocity surface area approach can be applied in the operating room.

After the surgical valve repair and weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, imaging and Doppler studies of the mitral valve are repeated. Loading conditions should be adjusted to match conditions at the time of the baseline study as much as possible, and the same image planes and Doppler flows should be recorded with the same instrument settings [\(Fig. 18.17](#page--1-55)). The most common mitral valve repair is quadrangular resection of a posterior leaflet scallop (usually P2), with reapproximation and suturing of the resected edges and placement of an annuloplasty ring. The exact repair varies from patient to patient; more complex repairs include modifications to the anterior leaflets, use of artificial chords, and chordal transfer or shortening. Knowledge of the exact repair is needed for the postpump TEE evaluation to ensure that expected postoperative changes are distinguished from abnormal findings. The use of intraprocedural TEE is associated with a higher rate of successful mitral valve repair at both academic and community medical centers.

Complications of mitral valve repair detectable by TEE include:

- Persistent mitral regurgitation
- Systolic anterior mitral leaflet motion

- Mitral stenosis
- Ventricular systolic dysfunction
- Injury of the circumflex artery
- Tricuspid regurgitation

With a successful mitral valve repair, no or minimal residual mitral regurgitation occurs. More than trivial mitral regurgitation, after optimization of loading conditions, should prompt consideration of an additional repair or valve replacement. Excessive reduction in mitral annular size is associated with systolic anterior motion of the mitral leaflet with resultant LV outflow obstruction and mitral regurgitation, although this complication is infrequent with current surgical techniques. Functional mitral stenosis can occur with some repairs and is easily detected by recording the antegrade mitral flow velocity after valve repair. Ventricular dysfunction often is transient because of cardioplegia; persistent dysfunction suggests preoperative dysfunction that is more evident with a competent mitral valve or a complication of the procedure, such as coronary artery air embolism. Tricuspid regurgitation often accompanies mitral valve disease and should be evaluated both at baseline and on the postrepair study.

#### *Valve Stenosis*

Whenever possible, aortic stenosis should be fully evaluated before the patient is in the operating room (see Chapter 11). TEE calculation of continuity equation valve area is possible in some cases if the LV outflow and aortic flow velocities can be recorded

from transgastric long-axis planes. Unfortunately, this approach may significantly underestimate stenosis severity because of the inability to align the Doppler beam parallel to flow from a TEE approach, which results in inaccurate velocity data. TEE short-axis views of the valve are accurate for the determination of valve anatomy, and planimetry of valve area is possible in many cases. In other cases, the complex 3D geometry of the orifice and distortion of aortic valve anatomy are challenging; ensuring measurement at the minimal orifice is facilitated with 3D imaging (see Fig. 11.6). Reverberations and shadowing by valve calcification affect the accuracy of planimetry with either 2D or 3D approaches.

Some specific circumstances in which intraprocedural TEE evaluation is especially helpful are:

- Detection of bicuspid valve
- Degree of valve calcification
- Aortic sinus and ascending aorta dilation

For example, in the patient undergoing coronary bypass grafting, aortic valve replacement is appropriate with moderate or severe asymptomatic stenosis. In equivocal cases, the finding of a bicuspid aortic valve or extensive valve calcification on TEE tips the balance toward valve replacement. Conversely, a trileaflet valve with minimal calcification and only mild to moderate aortic stenosis does not need intervention. Bicuspid

**Fig. 18.18 Localized tamponade after aortic surgery.** (A) In a patient with a complex aortic valve and root replacement with coronary reimplantation, hypotension in the early postoperative period was due to localized compression of the RA by pericardial thrombus, as seen in a simultaneous four-chamber and bicaval view using 3D TEE. (B) Color Doppler demonstrates a narrow flowstream in the compressed, slitlike RA.

aortic valve disease often is accompanied by aortic dilation. Intraprocedural TEE often provides improved images and measurements of the aortic sinuses and ascending aorta. The surgical approach may be modified to include aortic root replacement if significant aortic dilation is present that was not recognized preoperatively. With percutaneous or hybrid approaches to aortic valve replacement, intraprocedural TEE is used to monitor the procedure, ensure correct placement of the valve, provide immediate assessment of valve function, and detect any complications of the procedure [\(Fig. 18.18\)](#page--1-56).

# *Endocarditis*

Intraprocedural TEE is essential in patients undergoing valve surgery for endocarditis (see Chapter 14). The TEE study should include assessment of:

- Presence and location of vegetations
- Mechanisms of valve dysfunction
- Severity of regurgitation
- Paravalvular abscess
- Other complications such as fistulas, pseudoaneurysms

Given the complex patterns of valve destruction with endocarditis, careful review of the images with the surgeon is essential for planning the operative repair. Even with a complete presurgical evaluation, additional changes may occur between the time of that study and the surgical procedure, so the echocardiographer should perform a complete study. The baseline intraprocedural study also provides a comparison with the postprocedure images.

## *Prosthetic Valve Dysfunction*

After implantation of a prosthetic valve, TEE evaluation is helpful to confirm normal function. In addition to the normal patterns of mild regurgitation for prosthetic valves, a small amount of paravalvular regurgitation is not unusual immediately after implantation. However, a significant paravalvular leak suggests suture dehiscence that may require immediate intervention. The orientation and function of a mechanical valve are easily visualized [\(Fig. 18.19\)](#page--1-57). Occasionally, mechanical valve disk motion is impaired by excessive retained mitral leaflet tissue or other anatomic factors.

# Aortic Disease

#### *Aortic Dissection*

Intraprocedural TEE is accurate for the diagnosis of the presence and extent of an aortic dissection. Often, these patients are promptly transferred to the operating room after a CT scan showing an ascending aortic dissection, with no prior TEE imaging. The intraprocedural study confirms the presence and origin of the dissection flap and provides assessment of aortic valve function ([Fig. 18.20\)](#page--1-58). It is particularly important to determine whether the dissection involves the ascending aorta (type A), requiring surgical intervention, or whether it affects only the descending aorta (type B), often managed medically.

A complete examination of the aorta includes mid-esophageal views of the sinuses and the ascending aorta in both short- and long-axis views, thereby ensuring that the aorta is examined from the annulus level as far superiorly as possible with slow withdrawal of the probe (see Chapter 16). Aortic diameters are measured at end-diastole, from the inner edge to inner edge of the black-white interface, at the annulus, sinuses, sinotubular junction, and mid-ascending aorta. The descending thoracic aorta is imaged from the transgastric position to a very high esophageal position with slow withdrawal of the probe in the esophagus. Sequential short-axis views ensure that the entire

The *bottom left* shows the "surgeon's view" (the view the surgeon would have from the right side of the operating table with the LA open), with the *red line* intersecting the valve, resulting in the reconstructed 2D mid-esophageal long-axis view seen in the *top left* image. The leaflets close symmetrically and are indicated by *white arrows.* In the patient on the *right,* the valve has been implanted in the "antianatomic position" with the prosthetic valve occluders oriented at about 90° from the positions of the native valve leaflets. In the 3D image *(lower right),* the *green line* intersects the valve, resulting in a reconstructed 2D image plane similar to a bicommissural view *(top right).* The leaflets again close symmetrically. *AoV,* Aortic valve. *(From Oxorn DC, Otto CM: Surgical prosthetic valves.

endocardial surface is visualized. Supplemented longaxis views at each level are appropriate, especially when abnormal findings are present; however, abnormalities medial or lateral to the long-axis plane are missed with this approach. Descending aortic diameter is measured in the distal, mid-, and proximal descending aorta. The aortic arch is seen from a high TEE position with the image plane turned and tilted to show the length of the arch. In each view, depth and gain settings are adjusted to optimize visualization of a dissection flap, intramural hematoma, or atheroma. Color Doppler is helpful in showing flow patterns in the true and false lumens when a dissection is present. The spectral Doppler pattern, recorded in a long-axis view of the descending aorta, shows holodiastolic flow reversal when severe aortic regurgitation is present.

Other key findings are regional wall motion abnormalities, resulting from involvement of the right coronary artery, and pericardial effusion, resulting from impending rupture. After the repair, a dissection flap typically persists in the descending aorta, and the postrepair TEE images serve as a baseline for future follow-up studies. If the aortic valve has been resuspended, postrepair imaging of leaflet opening and Doppler evaluation for regurgitation are essential.

## *Aortic Atheroma*

Cardiac surgery usually involves cannulation or manipulation of the aorta, which is associated with adverse neurologic events because of embolization of aortic atheromas [\(Fig. 18.21](#page--1-59)). Detection of a

**Fig. 18.20 Intraoperative transesophageal aortic dissection.** (A) In this mid-esophageal short-axis view, a fenestrated dissection flap is seen during systole *(arrow, left).* In diastole *(top right),* the right coronary artery is seen *(arrow).* (B) In the long-axis view, the *left* image clearly shows the dissection flap *(arrow).* In addition, the aortic diameter at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva is enlarged at 5 cm.

**Fig. 18.21 Epiaortic scan.** Long-axis view of the aortic valve, aortic sinuses, and proximal ascending aorta *(Ao)* on an epiaortic scan with the transducer in a sterile sleeve placed directly on the anterior surface of the heart during the cardiac surgical procedure. No significant atheromas are seen in this example.

protruding, mobile, or large (>3 mm) atheroma is a marker of increased risk. Atheroma can be detected by TEE, although epiaortic scanning provides higher accuracy because it allows for more complete imaging of the entire endothelial surface of the ascending aorta. The recommended minimum epiaortic examination consists of three short-axis views of the ascending aorta (proximal, mid-, and distal) and two long-axis views (proximal and distal). The location of any plaques should be described with measurement of plaque thickness and notation of any mobile components.

## Cardiomyopathies

#### *Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy*

Intraprocedural TEE is used to guide the extent of myectomy in patients with LV outflow obstruction resulting from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to assess:

- Severity and location of septal hypertrophy
- Immediate hemodynamic results
- Complications of the procedure

Careful evaluation of the degree and location of hypertrophy in terms of distance from the aortic valve and by myocardial segment allows for tailoring of the depth, width, and length of the myomectomy (see Chapter 9). Imaging is performed from both midesophageal and transgastric transducer positions, using multiple image planes to assess septal anatomy fully. Color Doppler localizes the level of obstruction at the site of flow acceleration in the LV outflow tract and is useful for the detection and evaluation of associated mitral regurgitation. The LV outflow gradient may be recorded with CW Doppler from a deep transgastric view or the transgastric long-axis view, although underestimation is likely because of a nonparallel intercept angle.

After the procedure, TEE allows assessment of residual outflow obstruction and detection of complications, such as a ventricular septal defect. Often, LV outflow obstruction caused by systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve is accompanied by significant mitral regurgitation, which resolves when normal mitral leaflet motion is restored. Postoperative TEE results in additional surgical procedures in about 4% of cases.

# *Ventricular Assist Devices*

When placement of a ventricular assist device is considered, intraprocedural TEE ensures that the patient has no preexisting contraindications to this procedure, for example, significant aortic regurgitation would result in an inability to unload the LV. Another example is a patent foramen ovale, which allows right-to-left shunting when left-sided pressure is reduced, leading to arterial oxygen desaturation or paradoxical embolism. The presence of an aortic atheroma also influences the exact site for placement of the aortic inflow cannula. LV or LA clot also should be excluded.

In addition, intraprocedural TEE assists with the placement of ventricular assist devices by assessment of (see [Table 18.4](#page--1-38)):

- Placement of inflow and outflow cannula
- Ventricular volumes and systolic function
- Doppler inflow and outflow velocities
- De-airing of the pump before activation

LV assist devices include extracorporeal devices that use cannulas and an external pump to direct blood from the LV apex into the aorta. Some pumps provide pulsatile flow, whereas others provide nonpulsatile axial (continuous) flow. Some devices are placed percutaneously, directing blood from the LA (via a transseptal cannula) into the aorta. In addition, some intracorporeal devices fit inside the heart. Because these devices are currently in development, frequent changes in technology occur, so the echocardiographer needs information on each specific device, including information on the use of cannulas, optimal device or cannula placement, and expected flow patterns

![](_page_23_Figure_12.jpeg)

**Fig. 18.22 Left ventricular assist device.** (A) TEE in a patient with an LV assist device shows the color Doppler signal of flow from the outflow cannula *(arrow)* into the ascending aorta *(Ao).* (B) Pulsed *(PW)* Doppler interrogation of this flow shows predominant systolic flow about 1 m/s in velocity, with persistent antegrade flow in diastole.

[\(Fig. 18.22](#page--1-60)). Complications of ventricular assist devices include intracardiac thrombus formation, obstruction of inflow or outflow cannula as a result of positioning or thrombus formation, regurgitation of the pump valves, and inadequate flow volumes. Nonpulsatile devices are challenging to evaluate by TEE, but ventricular size is one factor in adjusting flow rates for these devices. With continuous flow devices, excessive LV drainage results in collapse of the ventricular chamber that leads to obstruction of the inflow cannula and a drop in flow rates.

#### *Heart Transplantation*

After heart transplantation, intraprocedural TEE is used to evaluate the anastomoses to the aorta and the pulmonary artery. The RA and LA anastomoses also are evaluated to ensure that no obstruction to systemic or pulmonary venous return exists and to serve as a baseline for atrial anatomy on subsequent diagnostic studies. With lung transplantation, all four pulmonary veins are imaged with recording of Doppler flow to ensure normal flow patterns. Evaluation of RV size and systolic function is particularly important after either heart or lung transplantation.

# Congenital Heart Disease

Intraprocedural TEE is essential in the surgical and percutaneous management of patients with congenital heart disease (see Chapter 17). Postprocedure evaluation ensures complete closure of ventricular and atrial septal defects, functional status of repaired or replacement valves, and patency of conduits. Except for simple defects, such as closure of an isolated atrial septal defect, intraprocedural TEE for congenital heart disease should be performed by echocardiographers with additional training and experience in pediatric or adult congenital heart disease.

# CLINICAL UTILITY IN TRANSCATHETER AND HYBRID PROCEDURES

The approach to echocardiographic imaging in patients undergoing transcatheter procedures for structural heart disease parallels the basic approach to intraoperative TEE. A complete diagnostic transthoracic study is performed before the procedure, along with other imaging tests as needed for decision making about the timing and type of intervention. A preprocedure TEE also is appropriate in many cases to allow optimal visualization of the anatomy and to aid in planning the procedure. During the procedure, views that show the anatomy and allow guidance of the procedure are used for monitoring; 3D imaging is particularly helpful for transcatheter intervention [\(Table 18.5](#page--1-61)). After the procedure, images and Doppler data are acquired to evaluate procedural results and detect complications.

Echocardiographic imaging is used to guide interventions for several types of structural heart disease [\(Fig. 18.23\)](#page--1-62). Rapid advances in interventional procedures for structural heart disease will require the echocardiographer to work closely with the interventional team to provide useful imaging data.

TEE monitoring during interventional procedures typically requires general anesthesia because patients do not tolerate having the probe in position for a long period while awake. When general anesthesia is needed for the procedure itself, this is not an issue, but in other cases, alternate echocardiographic approaches, such as TTE or intracardiac echocardiography, may be more appropriate.

## Atrial Septal Defect Closure

Transcatheter closure of a patent foramen ovale or secundum atrial septal defect typically is performed using echocardiographic guidance. Most often, both 2D and 3D TEE images are used [\(Fig. 18.24\)](#page--1-63). Alternatively, the interventional cardiologist my use intracardiac echocardiography for procedural guidance (see Fig. 4.19).

## Transcatheter Valve Implantation

In the patient with severe aortic stenosis who is being considered for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), baseline TTE imaging provides visualization of valve anatomy and the degree of leaflet calcification, quantitation of stenosis severity, and evaluation of LV geometry and function [\(Table 18.6](#page--1-39)). Multimodality imaging is recommended before the procedure. TAVI valve size is determined from gated contrast-enhanced CT angiography, which allows visualization and measurement of the 3D shape of the annulus and sinuses, as well as measurement of the distance from the valve leaflets to the coronary ostia.

The role of TEE during the TAVI procedure has evolved as this technology has matured. Initially, most TAVI procedures were performed using general anesthesia with continuous TEE guidance to position the valve, assess function immediately after implantation, and detect complications ([Fig. 18.25](#page--1-64)). Increasingly, TAVI procedures are performed with sedation using only fluoroscopic images to guide valve placement. TTE imaging after the procedure is used to detect complications and assess valve function. Long term, echocardiography is used to monitor valve function; the presence of paravalvular aortic regurgitation is a poor prognostic sign and should be monitored closely.

<sup>\*</sup>TAVI CTA: Unless otherwise noted, this refers to single arterial-phase CTA of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Typically, the thorax is acquired using ECG-gated multiphase acquisition. At minimum, acquisition and reconstruction should include end-systole, usually between 30% and 40% of the R-R window.

TEE: Given the use of CT, the role in annular sizing before TAVI with TEE is limited. Periprocedural use of TEE is limited to cases performed.

**Fig. 18.25 Transesophageal echocardiography guidance of transcatheter aortic valve implantation.** TEE can be used during transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in patients receiving general anesthesia. This example shows baseline *(top)* color Doppler imaging in short- and long-axis views in a patient with severe aortic stenosis. 3D imaging helps guide positioning of the valve *(middle),* with the guidewire seen as a linear bright echo extending from the aorta *(Ao)* into the LV. The position of the valve is shown by the *black arrows* with reverberation artifacts distal to the valve. After valve implantation *(bottom),* short- and long-axis views now show normal velocity laminar flow across the valve.

# Transcatheter Mitral Valve Repair

Based on the complex anatomy of the mitral valve apparatus, several approaches to transcatheter reduction of mitral regurgitation severity are in various stages of study or approval. Currently, the most common

![](_page_29_Figure_9.jpeg)

**Fig. 18.26 Transcatheter mitral valve repair.** The MitraClip system (Abbott Laboratories, Abbot Park, Ill.) with the delivery catheter entering the LA through the fossa ovalis area and the clip with open arms in the LV near the tip of the mitral valve leaflets. *(From Salcedo EE, Quaife RA, Kim MS, Carroll JD: Transcatheter mitral valve repair: role of echocardiography in patient selection, procedural guidance and evaluation of outcomes. In Otto CM, editor:*  The Practice of Clinical Echocardiography, *ed 5, Philadelphia, 2017, Elsevier, Fig. 20.2.)*

transcatheter mitral valve procedure is placement of a clip that connects the center of the anterior and posterior leaflet tips to improve leaflet coaptation [\(Fig.](#page--1-68) [18.26\)](#page--1-68). Others are similar to annuloplasty ring placement with changes in shape and size of the annulus, for example, with a device in the coronary sinus that lies immediately adjacent to the annulus. These procedures require a detailed baseline evaluation of mitral valve anatomy, with measurements specific to each procedure, such as annulus diameters or leaflet coaptation and tenting distances. For guidance of transcatheter mitral procedures, a real-time 3D view that clearly demonstrates the area of interest is obtained; this view is then used to guide the procedure ([Fig. 18.27](#page--1-58)). TEE during the procedure allows measurement of transmitral diastolic gradients and assessment of residual regurgitation at each step of the procedure [\(Fig. 18.28\)](#page--1-69). Long term, TEE is used to assess for residual mitral valve dysfunction.

# Other Transcatheter Interventions

Echocardiography also is used to guide catheter septal ablation for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (see Chapter 9), closure of prosthetic valve paravalvular leaks ([Fig.](#page--1-70) [18.29](#page--1-70)), closure of post–myocardial infarction ventricular septal defects, or procedures to occlude the LA appendage [\(Fig. 18.30\)](#page--1-71).

**Fig. 18.27 Procedural transesophageal echocardiography guidance of mitral valve clip placement.** TEE is essential for correct placement of a mitral valve clip to reduce regurgitant severity. A combination of 3D and 2D imaging is used to guide the clip *(arrow)*  from the LA to the correct position on the LA size of the mitral valve, as shown in biplane images *(top)* . The open arms of the clip can be seen in the *top right* image. Imaging then is used to guide grasping of the leaflets and to assess the degree of residual mitral regurgitation. 3D imaging after placement of two clips *(bottom)* shows clips *(arrows)* in the mid-section of the leaflets with the resultant dual orifices *(asterisks). BP,* Blood pressure.

**Fig. 18.29 Closure of paravalvular leak.** In this patient with severe paravalvular regurgitation around a mitral valve prosthetic valve *(asterisk)*, several transcatheter closure devices *(arrows)* have been placed around the annulus to reduce regurgitant severity.

**Fig. 18.30 Transesophageal echocardiography after LA appendage occluder device placement.** 3D TEE imaging shows the LA appendage *(LAA)* occluder device *(arrows)* blocking the orifice of the LA appendage into the LA. 2D color Doppler shows a small residual leak around the device *(asterisk). Ao,* Aorta.

# **THE ECHO EXAM**

## Basic Principles of Intraprocedural TEE

- • Establish diagnosis preprocedure when possible.
- • The goals of the baseline TEE are to:
  - • Confirm the diagnosis.
  - • Provide additional information on repairability.
  - • Serve as a comparison with postprocedure studies.
  - • Assess LV and RV function.
  - • Check for other abnormalities.
- • Perform a complete study unless there are clinical or time constraints.
- • Record postprocedure images at similar loading conditions to those of baseline.
- • Communicate and discuss findings at time of study.
- • Report TEE findings in medical record, and store TEE images.
