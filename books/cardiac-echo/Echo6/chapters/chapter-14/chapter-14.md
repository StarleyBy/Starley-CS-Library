chocardiography is an essential component of the evaluation of a patient with infective endocarditis. In combination with clinical and bacteriologic data, the echocardiographic finding of a valvular vegetation allows for an accurate diagnosis of endocarditis. In addition, echocardiographic assessment of the degree of valve dysfunction and detection of complications, such as a paravalvular abscess or fistula, are needed for optimal patient care. E

Although transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is adequate in some cases, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) imaging is more sensitive and specific, both for the detection of valvular vegetations and for the detection of complications. Furthermore, demonstration of normal valve anatomy and function on TEE imaging reliably excludes endocarditis in patients in whom this diagnosis is suspected.

## <span id="page-0-0"></span>BASIC PRINCIPLES

The diagnosis of endocarditis is most secure with pathologic confirmation of a valvular vegetation with active infection, local tissue destruction, and/ or paravalvular abscess formation. In the clinical setting, endocarditis is diagnosed based on a combination of echocardiographic, laboratory, and physical examination findings, as detailed in [Table 14.1](#page--1-0). The major criteria for the diagnosis of endocarditis are persistent bacteremia with typical organisms and echocardiographic evidence of endocardial involvement. Minor criteria include less specific bacteriologic and echocardiographic findings, factors predisposing to endocarditis (e.g., preexisting valve disease or intravenous drug use), vascular events (e.g., pulmonary or systemic emboli), immunologic phenomena (e.g., glomerulonephritis), and signs of systemic infection (e.g., fever).

The goals of echocardiography in a patient with a diagnosis of infective endocarditis are to evaluate the:

- Presence, location, size, and number of valvular vegetations
- Dysfunction of the affected valve(s), especially valvular regurgitation
- Underlying anatomy of the affected valve(s) and any coincident valvular disease
- Impact of valvular dysfunction on left ventricle (LV) size and systolic function
- Other complications of endocarditis (e.g., paravalvular abscess, pericardial effusion)

In addition, echocardiographic findings provide prognostic data on the anticipated clinical course, the risk of systemic embolization, and the indications for and timing of surgical intervention.

In a patient with a low likelihood of endocarditis on clinical grounds, an echocardiogram often is requested to "rule out" endocarditis. In this setting, the goals of the echocardiographic examination are:

- The identification of any valvular vegetations
- The assessment of valve anatomy and function with respect to anatomic or physiologic factors that increase the likelihood of endocarditis (e.g., bicuspid aortic valve, mitral valve prolapse)

If an abnormality is identified, complete evaluation is directed toward the goals listed for clinical endocarditis. If no vegetations are identified on transthoracic imaging, additional imaging studies still are often needed, depending on the clinical situation.

# ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC APPROACH

# Valvular Vegetations

## *Transthoracic Echocardiography*

On echocardiographic imaging, features typical features of a valvular vegetation [\(Table 14.2\)](#page--1-22) are:

- An abnormal echogenic, irregular mass, usually attached to a valve
- Site of attachment on the upstream side of the valve leaflet
- A pattern of motion that is dependent on, but more chaotic than, normal valve motion

For example, an aortic valve vegetation is attached to the LV side of the valve leaflet but shows motion in excess of normal valve excursion with rapid oscillations in diastole (best appreciated on M-mode recordings). Typically, an aortic valve vegetation prolapses into the LV outflow tract in diastole and extends into the aortic root in systole [\(Fig. 14.1](#page--1-23)). A mitral valve vegetation is attached on the atrial side of the valve, prolapses into the left atrium (LA) in systole, and moves into the LV, beyond the normal range of mitral valve opening, in diastole ([Fig. 14.2](#page--1-24)), again with rapid motion independent of normal leaflet motion.

Valvular vegetations vary in size from so small as to be undetectable with current imaging techniques to greater than 3 cm in length. Vegetations can be attached at any area of the leaflet, although lesions at the coaptation line are most common. More than one valve can be involved, either by direct extension of infection or as a separate process, thus emphasizing the caveat that each valve requires careful examination even if a vegetation has been identified on another valve. In most but not all cases, endocarditis occurs on a previously abnormal valve.

Multiple acoustic windows and two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) views are needed for the detection of a valvular vegetation. Because the vegetation is a focal structure, it is seen only in certain tomographic planes. 3D imaging often improves visualization of vegetations on transthoracic echocardiography in some patients, depending on image quality, but it has the disadvantage of lower spatial resolution and slower frame rates.

With 2D imaging, slow scanning between the standard image planes—for example, between the parasternal long-axis view and the right ventricular (RV) inflow view—increases the likelihood of identifying a valvular vegetation. Orthogonal views further ensure that all segments of the valve leaflets are examined. In a patient with suspected endocarditis, a complete examination is needed with scanning from parasternal, apical, subcostal, and suprasternal notch views for careful evaluation of each valve. The reported sensitivity of transthoracic imaging for the detection of valvular vegetations ranges from less than 50% to as high as 90% (see Appendix B, Table B.18).

**AORTIC VALVE.** Aortic valve vegetations most often are detected in parasternal long- and short-axis views. Careful angulation from medial to lateral in the long-axis plane and from inferior to superior in the short-axis plane is needed because vegetations often are eccentrically located. Image quality is optimized by use of a minimum depth setting and adjustment of gain and processing parameters. An echogenic mass attached to the ventricular side of the leaflet with independent motion and prolapse into the outflow tract in diastole is diagnostic for a valvular vegetation [\(Fig. 14.3\)](#page--1-25). Rapid oscillating motion is best appreciated on an M-mode recording.

**Fig. 14.3 Aortic valve vegetation.** In a TTE parasternal long-axis view, a large echodensity *(arrow)* is seen in the aorta *(Ao)* attached to the anterior aortic valve leaflet in systole with prolapse into the LV outflow tract in diastole. In addition to moving with the leaflet, the mass showed rapid oscillating motion typical of a vegetation.

Less typically, a vegetation is attached to the aortic side of the leaflet or shows little independent motion. A definitive diagnosis is more difficult if the underlying valve anatomy is abnormal. For example, a vegetation on a calcified aortic valve may be difficult to diagnose because of shadowing and reverberations by the leaflet calcification. In these cases, the findings of independent motion and prolapse into the LV in diastole are particularly helpful signs. Recent changes compared with previous echocardiograms increase the likelihood of valve infection; stable findings compared with previous studies decrease the likelihood of an acute process.

Findings that may be mistaken for an aortic valve vegetation include beam-width artifact related to a calcified nodule, a prosthetic valve, the normal leaflet apposition zone, or the normal leaflet thickening at the central coaptation region (the nodule of Arantius). Occasionally, a linear echo representing a normal variant called a *Lambl excrescence* is seen. These small fibroelastic protrusions from the ventricular side of the leaflet closure zone occur with increasing frequency with age and are present in a high percentage of patients ([Fig. 14.4](#page--1-26)).

An aortic valve vegetation also may be seen in apical views, both from an anteriorly angulated fourchamber view and from an apical long-axis view. The finding of an abnormality in both parasternal and apical views decreases the likelihood of an ultrasound artifact because the relationship of the ultrasound beam and the aortic valve is entirely different from these two windows. Aortic valve vegetations typically are accompanied by new or worsening aortic regurgitation [\(Fig. 14.5](#page--1-27)).

**MITRAL VALVE.** Mitral valve vegetations typically are located on the atrial side of the leaflets. Diagnostic features include rapid independent motion, prolapse into the LA in systole, and functional evidence of valve dysfunction. Parasternal long- and short-axis views with careful scanning across the valve apparatus in both image planes allow assessment of the presence, size, and location of any vegetations [\(Fig. 14.6\)](#page--1-28). Apical four-chamber, two-chamber, and long-axis views again are helpful both in visualizing valve and vegetation anatomy and in distinguishing a true valve mass from an ultrasound artifact.

In a short-axis diastolic view *(right)*, the mass *(arrow)* is attached to the medial aspect of both the anterior and posterior leaflets. A small pericardial effusion also is present. *Ao,* Aorta.

As for the aortic valve, beam-width artifacts can be mistaken for a vegetation. A particular artifact to be aware of is the appearance of a "mass" on the atrial side of the anterior mitral leaflet in the apical four-chamber view due to beam-width artifact from a calcified or prosthetic aortic valve. Other types of mitral valve pathology that are difficult to distinguish from a valvular vegetation include a severely myxomatous leaflet, a partial flail leaflet, and a ruptured papillary muscle. Again, comparison with previous studies helps differentiate an acute process from chronic underlying valve disease. Endocarditis also can occur on an anatomically normal valve [\(Fig. 14.7](#page--1-30)). With mitral valve endocarditis, mitral regurgitation often, but not invariably, is present.

**TRICUSPID VALVE.** Tricuspid valve endocarditis occurs most often in intravenous drug users and is associated with large vegetations due to *Staphylococcus aureus* infection. The RV inflow view often is diagnostic, showing a large, mobile mass of echoes attached to the atrial side of the leaflet with prolapse into the right atrium (RA) in systole [\(Fig. 14.8](#page--1-29)). Given the range of excursion and mobility of these vegetations, it is not surprising that septic pulmonary

emboli are frequent complications of tricuspid valve endocarditis. The apical and subcostal four-chamber views allow further evaluation of the presence and extent of tricuspid valve infection. Assessment of tricuspid regurgitant severity and consequent RA and RV dilation also can be performed from these windows.

**PACER LEAD INFECTIONS.** Infections of intracardiac devices, particularly pacer or defibrillator leads in the right side of the heart, have become increasingly common because of the greater number of patients with these devices. Accurate diagnosis of lead infection is important because therapy typically requires removal of the pacer leads and pacemaker, in addition to prolonged antibiotics. Small fibrinous strands are common on pacer leads, and small thrombi also may be seen. No definitive findings have been identified that distinguish an infected from noninfected pacer lead mass, so infection must be assumed to present when blood culture results are positive. Pacer lead vegetations resemble valvular vegetations—a mobile mass attached to the pacer lead with independent motion. Some pacer lead infections can be diagnosed on transthoracic imaging, but TEE is much more sensitive for this diagnosis and is recommended when this diagnosis is of concern.

In diastole *(left)*, a bright echodense mass *(arrow)* is seen attached to the valve leaflet. In systole, this mass prolapses into the RA with incomplete tricuspid valve closure resulting in severe tricuspid regurgitation. These findings are consistent with healed endocarditis, although blood cultures were obtained to exclude active infection.

**Fig. 14.9 Transesophageal echocardiography aortic valve vegetation.** In the same patient as in [Fig. 14.8](#page--1-29), the TEE long-axis view *(left)* shows the attachment of the vegetation at the base of the aortic valve. The short-axis view *(right)* shows that the underlying anatomy is a bicuspid valve with an additional vegetation *(short arrow)* attached to the more posterior valve leaflets. The increased echodensity posterior to the aortic valve in the long-axis views raises concern for paravalvular abscess.

#### *Transesophageal Imaging*

From the TEE approach, the aortic valve is examined in multiple 2D image planes, including standard long-axis (typically at approximately 120° rotation) and short-axis (about 45° rotation) views. As with transthoracic imaging, careful scanning from medial to lateral in the long-axis view and from superior to inferior in the short-axis view is needed to evaluate valve anatomy fully and to achieve a high sensitivity for the detection of valvular vegetations [\(Figs. 14.9](#page--1-31) and [14.10](#page--1-32)). When the image plane is oblique, an en face view of the aortic leaflet may be mistaken for an aortic valve mass. Evaluation in more than one image plane and assessment of the pattern of motion (rapid oscillating independent motion versus motion *with* the valve) avoid this potential error. Image quality is enhanced by the use of a higher-frequency transducer

and magnification of the area of interest, but small, normal variants of valve anatomy should not be interpreted as abnormalities. Sometimes the aortic valve can be evaluated from a transgastric apical view; however, image quality often is no better than from a transthoracic approach because of the distance from the transducer to the aortic valve. 3D imaging of the aortic valve with a full-volume acquisition to view both the aortic and ventricular sides of the valve is helpful, although it is limited by lower resolution and slower frame rates than those with 2D imaging.

The mitral valve is well seen from a high esophageal position. Because the mitral valve plane is perpendicular to the ultrasound beam from this approach, excellent 2D images can be obtained in multiple views by slowly rotating the multiplane transducer from 0° to 180°. Particular attention should be paid to standard four-chamber (at 0°), two-chamber (at 60°), and long-axis (at 120°) views. The degree of mitral regurgitation can be assessed with color flow imaging in these same views. Given the distance of the mitral valve from the chest wall in both parasternal and apical transthoracic views, TEE imaging often provides dramatically better images and important clinical data [\(Fig. 14.11](#page--1-33)). 3D imaging of the mitral valve is particularly helpful because the orientation of the valve to the TEE probe allows acquisition of high-quality 3D datasets that provide 3D views of the left atrial side of the valve. These images help localize the size and attachment site of the vegetations and allow identification of leaflet perforation (see [Fig. 14.11](#page--1-33)).

The tricuspid valve is seen in the TEE four-chamber view and from a transgastric approach. Because the tricuspid valve lies closer to the chest wall than the mitral valve, transthoracic imaging often is diagnostic. TEE imaging is most valuable in these patients for the detection of left-sided valve involvement. TEE also may be diagnostic when infection of a pacer lead is suspected ([Fig. 14.12](#page--1-34)). Again, 3D imaging is particularly valuable for defining the spatial relationship of the vegetation to the pacer lead.

## *Diagnostic Accuracy*

Numerous studies have evaluated the sensitivity of echocardiography for the diagnosis of valvular vegetation by comparing the echo findings with subsequent surgical or autopsy findings. Fewer data are available on specificity because most studies include only subjects with a definite diagnosis of endocarditis. Thus, the study group has no subjects without the disease. Second, when surgical or autopsy inspection of the valve is the standard of reference, only patients who are sick enough to need surgery or who have died are included in the study group. Direct inspection of valves that appeared normal on echocardiography rarely is available.

A few studies (see Appendix B, Table B.18) have circumvented these study design problems by including all patients with *suspected* endocarditis (some have the disease and some do not) and using clinical outcome rather than direct valve inspection as the standard of reference. All these studies demonstrate a high specificity of transthoracic echocardiography (93% to 98%) and TEE (100%) imaging in excluding the diagnosis of endocarditis.

The specificity of echocardiography depends on distinguishing a valvular vegetation from other intracardiac masses and from ultrasound artifacts.

Echocardiographic findings that might be mistaken for a vegetation include:

- Papillary fibroelastoma
- Myxomatous mitral valve disease
- Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis
- Systemic lupus erythematosus
- Thrombus (especially with prosthetic valves)

- Beam-width artifact
- Normal valve variants such as a Lambl excrescence or nodule of Arantius

# Valve Dysfunction

Valve leaflet destruction by the infectious process and distortion of leaflet closure by the vegetation typically result in valvular regurgitation. Regurgitation can occur at the closure line or through a perforation in the leaflet itself. The degree of regurgitation varies from none to mild, moderate, or severe. Assessment of valvular regurgitation in endocarditis is performed using the pulsed, color flow, and continuous-wave (CW) Doppler approaches described in Chapter 12, with careful attention to the features that distinguish acute from chronic regurgitation. Because endocarditis often affects a previously abnormal valve, acute regurgitation superimposed on chronic regurgitation results in mixed findings on echocardiography.

Valve stenosis due to endocarditis is rare. Occasionally, a large vegetation partially obstructs the orifice of the open valve and causes some degree of functional stenosis.

Although 90% of patients with endocarditis have a new murmur, approximately 10% do not, and a few have no regurgitation detectable on Doppler examination. This is most likely to occur if the vegetation is located at the base of the leaflet, thus resulting in little distortion of leaflet closure. Echocardiographic recognition of the diagnosis in this subgroup is all the more important in that endocarditis often is not suspected clinically, with the echocardiogram ordered for other reasons.

**Fig. 14.13 Paravalvular abscess.** In addition to a valvular vegetation, the TEE long-axis image *(left)* in a patient with aortic valve endocarditis shows thickening of the posterior aortic wall and irregular areas of echolucency and echodensity in the aortic annulus and sinuses *(arrows)*. The short-axis view *(right)* shows a congenital bicuspid aortic valve with thickening, dilation, and irregularity of the aortic sinus. At surgery, a paravalvular abscess was present. *Ao,* Aorta.

# Paravalvular Abscess and Intracardiac Fistula

Unlike abscesses elsewhere in the body, a cardiac abscess is either echolucent or echodense on ultrasound examination. Typically, abscesses occur in the valve annulus adjacent to the infected leaflet tissue and are more common with aortic than with mitral valve endocarditis. For the diagnosis of an aortic annular abscess, findings include increased echogenicity, an echolucent area in the base of the septum, or increased thickness of the posterior aortic root ([Fig. 14.13](#page--1-36)). Involvement of the aortic annulus can extend into the contiguous anterior mitral valve leaflet with evidence of increased thickness of the leaflet tissue, a valvular vegetation, and/or leaflet perforation. A sinus of Valsalva aneurysm occurs when the aortic wall is infected, which is diagnosed based on a dilated and distorted aortic sinus, even in the absence of rupture. In effect, this represents an abscess that is in direct communication with the bloodstream.

Rupture of an aortic annular abscess results in different complications depending on the exact site of rupture. The region of the noncoronary cusp ruptures into the RV outflow tract either in the sinus of Valsalva (an aortic-to-RV connection) or from the LV outflow tract through the septum into the RV (a ventricular septal defect). An aortic-to-RV fistula shows both systolic and diastolic left-to-right flow on Doppler interrogation, whereas a ventricular septal defect shows predominantly systolic flow. Rupture also can occur from the LV into the mitral-aortic intervalvular fibrosa with flow into and out of the abscess cavity from the LV outflow tract [\(Fig. 14.14](#page--1-35)).

The right coronary sinus region ruptures into the RV or RA, often with involvement of the adjacent septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve. Again, rupture can occur either from the aorta or from the LV outflow tract into the right side of the heart. Note that a small segment of ventricular septum (the atrioventricular septum) actually separates the LV from the *RA,* so that a ventriculoatrial communication is possible. The left coronary sinus of the aortic valve ruptures into the LA or RA, sometimes with extension of infection directly into the interatrial septum [\(Figs.](#page--1-37) [14.15](#page--1-37) and [14.16](#page--1-38)).

A mitral annular abscess appears as increased thickening and echogenicity in the posterior aspect of the mitral annulus. Infection can extend into the basal segments of the ventricular myocardium or into the pericardial space. Again, identification often is difficult on echocardiographic imaging, and the diagnosis should be pursued with TEE echocardiography when suspected on clinical grounds. An unusual complication of mitral valve endocarditis is a persistent contour abnormality, in effect a pseudoaneurysm of the valve leaflet, which persists even after the infection is treated.

Tricuspid valve endocarditis can be associated with a ring abscess, again manifested as increased thickening and echogenicity in the annulus region.

Diagnosis of paravalvular abscess by transthoracic imaging has a markedly lower sensitivity and specificity (Appendix B, Table B.19) compared with TEE imaging because of poor ultrasound tissue penetration resulting in suboptimal image quality. A high index of suspicion is needed by the echocardiographer, and subtle abnormalities suggesting a valve abscess should not be ignored. However, even with careful imaging from

However, real-time images suggested an abnormal echodensity on the LA size of the aortic valve in the region indicated by the *arrow,* thus prompting a TEE study. (B) and (C) In the same patient as in A, TEE long-axis images demonstrate an aortic root abscess and complex pseudoaneurysm of the aortic-mitral intravalvular fibrosa. The posterior aortic wall is markedly thickened *(between arrowheads)* consistent with an aneurysm, but an echo-free space *(asterisk)* is also present between the aortic valve prosthesis and the aortic wall. This contained space is a pseudoaneurysm due to rupture of the fibrous tissue between the aortic and mitral valves. The pseudoaneurysm communicates with the LV but not the aorta *(Ao).* In diastole, blood flows from the pseudoaneurysm back into the LV, but in this case also into the LA across a perforation in the pseudoaneurysm *(arrow).* Systolic images (C) show flow from the LV into the pseudoaneurysm *(arrow),* in addition to mitral regurgitation *(MR).*

**Fig. 14.16 Doppler flows with intracardiac LV** → **RV fistulas.** The velocity, timing, and shape of the CW Doppler curve can be used to determine the origin of an abnormal flow pattern seen on color Doppler in patients with endocarditis and extensive tissue destruction. The pressure tracings *(left)* and corresponding Doppler recordings *(right)* show the following: (A) A ventricular septal defect results in high-velocity left-to-right flow from the LV to RV in systole with an ejection-type curve. Persistent low velocity diastolic left-to-right flow is seen if LV diastolic pressure exceeds RV diastolic pressure. (B) A fistula from the aorta to the RV outflow tract due to a ruptured aortic annular abscess results in high-velocity flow in systole and diastole that reflects the large pressure difference between the aorta *(Ao)* and the RV. Velocity decreases slightly in systole as the pressure gradient diminishes due to RV contraction. (C) With a fistula from the aorta to the LA, very high-velocity, continuous systolic and diastolic flow is seen consistent with the high pressure difference between these chambers throughout the cardiac cycle.

several acoustic windows in multiple tomographic planes, a definite diagnosis is not always possible. TEE imaging is especially important in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis because paravalvular abscesses are common, and shadowing and reverberations from the valve prosthesis compromise the examination (see Chapter 13).

The superior image quality of TEE is associated with a higher sensitivity (87%) and specificity (96%) for the diagnosis of a paravalvular abscess. In addition to 2D findings of abnormal areas of increased echogenicity or abnormal echolucent areas adjacent to the valve, color flow imaging and conventional pulsed Doppler may allow demonstration of flow into and out of these abnormal areas consistent with an abscess that partially communicates with the bloodstream.

## Other Echocardiographic Findings

In addition to direct assessment of valvular disease, the examination includes an evaluation of cardiac chamber size and function. Acute aortic regurgitation results in only mild LV dilation, but a subacute or acute course superimposed on mild to moderate chronic disease results in significant ventricular dilation. Severe valve destruction often results in a flail leaflet (see Fig. 13.16). Mitral regurgitation results in LA and LV enlargement. LV systolic dysfunction is atypical but may be present due to long-standing valvular disease or secondary to the acute infectious process. Pulmonary pressures often are elevated because of mitral regurgitation, directly resulting in an elevated LA pressure, or because of aortic regurgitation with a high end-diastolic LV pressure. A small pericardial effusion often is seen in patients with endocarditis. A larger effusion raises

the concern of purulent pericarditis due to direct extension from a paravalvular abscess.

## LIMITATIONS AND TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS

## Active Versus Healed Vegetations

Sequential echocardiographic studies in a patient undergoing effective treatment for endocarditis typically show a gradual reduction in size, a decrease in mobility, and an increase in echogenicity of the valvular vegetation. Sometimes vegetations either abruptly "disappear" from the heart because of embolization; thus, a patient with active endocarditis may have no visible vegetation if recent embolization has occurred. A persistent vegetation with no change in size or echodensity raises concern for inadequate treatment or ongoing infection; however, some patients have vegetations evident long after the acute episode. The diagnosis of endocarditis is based on a combination of microbiological, clinical (e.g., fevers, systemic emboli, new murmur, and peripheral manifestation of endocarditis), and imaging findings, as detailed in [Table 14.1.](#page--1-0) Obviously, echocardiography provides no information regarding the causative organism. Although certain causal agents (e.g., fungal endocarditis, *Haemophilus influenzae*) are associated with larger vegetations, this observation is not diagnostically useful in an individual patient.

## Nonbacterial Thrombotic Endocarditis

The echocardiographic appearance of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis, typically seen in patients with malignant disease or systemic lupus erythematosus, is somewhat similar to that of infectious endocarditis, but the vegetations tend to be smaller, are located near the leaflet base, show variable echodensity, and have less independent motion. However, none of these differences are independently diagnostic, so differentiation of infective from nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis depends on clinical and bacteriologic correlation [\(Fig. 14.17\)](#page--1-39).

# Diagnosis With Underlying Valve Disease

Endocarditis most often occurs on a previously abnormal valve because the local flow disturbance increases the likelihood of bacterial deposition. When the underlying disease is anatomically straightforward, such as a bicuspid aortic valve, this poses little problem in diagnosing superimposed valvular vegetations. Often, however, the presence of an abnormal valve makes exclusion or confirmation of a valvular vegetation more difficult. For example, with calcific aortic stenosis, the irregular areas of increased echogenicity on the valve leaflets could represent a vegetation or chronic fibrocalcific changes. Findings of independent rapid motion and prolapse into the outflow tract in diastole increase the likelihood of a vegetation, but the absence of these findings does not allow for a definite conclusion on the absence of a vegetation.

Another example is myxomatous mitral valve disease, in which an independently mobile mass of echoes attached to the leaflet and prolapsing into the LA in systole could represent either a valvular vegetation or a flail leaflet segment and attached chordae. When underlying valve disease is present, the improved 2D and 3D images obtained by the TEE approach may increase the certainty of diagnosis.

### Prosthetic Valves and Intracardiac Devices

Evaluation of prosthetic valves for suspected endocarditis is problematic for two reasons. First, infection often involves the area around the sewing ring of the prosthetic valve, rather than resulting in a discrete valvular vegetation. Second, reverberations and shadowing by the prosthesis limit the ability of echocardiography to detect abnormalities. This is a particular problem with transthoracic imaging of mitral prostheses, in which the LA side of the valve is "masked" by the prosthesis so that neither the paravalvular infection in the mitral annulus nor the resulting valvular incompetence can be detected (see Chapter 13). Acoustic shadowing is less of a problem with aortic valve prostheses because aortic regurgitation can be evaluated from both apical and parasternal windows without "masking" by the valve prosthesis. However, because the anterior part of the valve prosthesis shadows the more posterior portions, images of the valve leaflets may be suboptimal.

With suspected prosthetic valve endocarditis, the transthoracic examination provides clues that suggest the diagnosis even when definitive findings are not present. For example, if color flow imaging is nondiagnostic because of shadowing and color flow artifacts, CW Doppler evidence for prosthetic valve regurgitation suggests infection with leaflet or annular destruction ([Fig. 14.18](#page--1-40)). Care is needed in the

In both the long-axis view and the short-axis view *(top right)*, thickening is seen posterior to the prosthetic valve with echolucent areas *(arrows)*.

(B) Color Doppler shows diastolic flow in the abnormal echolucent area that is suggestive of paravalvular regurgitation and valve dehiscence. *Ao,* Aorta.

assessment of the *severity* of regurgitation in this situation; it is prudent to indicate the presence of regurgitation on transthoracic echocardiography with the recommendation to pursue TEE for quantitation of severity if needed. Other clues to prosthetic valve dysfunction include increased antegrade flow velocity across the prosthesis (reflecting increased antegrade volume flow due to prosthetic regurgitation) and elevated tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity due to pulmonary hypertension.

Whenever prosthetic valve endocarditis is suspected, TEE imaging should be strongly considered, given its higher sensitivity and specificity for the detection of prosthetic valve endocarditis, paravalvular abscess, and prosthetic mitral regurgitation [\(Figs. 14.19](#page--1-41) and [14.20](#page--1-42)).

Endocarditis rarely can result in prosthetic valve stenosis due to impingement of the infected mass on leaflet opening or to an infected pannus on the upstream side of the valve. Visualization of the infected mass may not be possible on transthoracic imaging but is more likely on TEE or with alternate imaging approaches. Prosthetic valve stenosis is recognized by findings of an increased transvalvular pressure gradient and a decreased valve area (by pressure half-time or by continuity equation).

In an individual patient, a *change* in the appearance or flow characteristics of a prosthetic valve is more diagnostic than an observation at one point in time. Review of previous studies (if available) performed when the patient clinically was well can improve the diagnostic yield of echocardiography.

## CLINICAL UTILITY

## Suspected Endocarditis

Although TEE echocardiography is more sensitive than transthoracic echocardiography for the detection of valvular vegetations, transthoracic echocardiography remains the initial procedure of choice in patients with a low pre-test likelihood of disease (the "rule out endocarditis" indication) because of the lower cost and risk of this approach ([Fig. 14.21\)](#page--1-43). Based on an average sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 98% for transthoracic detection of vegetations, the positive likelihood ratio of finding a vegetation is 40 (an excellent test), but the negative likelihood ratio is 0.20 (only a reasonably good test). Thus, in a patient with a pre-echo likelihood of disease of 50%, a normal transthoracic exam reduces that likelihood to 10%. In contrast, using a sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 91% for TEE diagnosis of valve vegetations, the negative likelihood ratio is 0.03, indicating that a normal TEE is reliable for excluding a diagnosis of endocarditis. A normal TEE in the patient with a pre-echo likelihood of 50% reduces the likelihood of endocarditis to 1.5%.

TEE is appropriate in patients at high risk of endocarditis and in situations where transthoracic imaging is likely to be nondiagnostic ([Table 14.3](#page--1-22)). High-risk patients include those with prosthetic valves, congenital heart disease, previous endocarditis, new heart failure, new atrioventricular block, and community-acquired staphylococcal bacteremia. Typically, transthoracic imaging also is needed in these patients to allow parallel alignment for CW Doppler evaluation of high-velocity flows, standard measurement of chamber dimensions, quantitation of LV systolic function, and measurement of pulmonary artery pressures. In addition, the combination of transthoracic imaging and TEE allows optimal visualization of both sides of the prosthetic valve

because shadowing from the prosthesis occurs in opposite directions with these two approaches. TEE imaging also is reasonable when endocarditis has been detected on transthoracic echocardiogrraphy particularly when the aortic valve is involved, because of the risk of paravalvular abscess. Finally, TEE is appropriate in patients with persistent fever, recurrent bacteremia, or new atrioventricular block—all signs of paravalvular abscess formation.

#### Known Endocarditis

In a patient with known endocarditis, an echocardiogram is an invaluable adjunct to clinical decision making concerning potential surgical intervention and prediction

of short- and long-term prognosis. Echocardiography often allows clear definition of which (and how many) valves are affected. Echocardiographic findings are key variables in identifying indication for surgical intervention and in optimizing the timing of intervention—early (during the initial hospitalization) or at a later date.

Early surgery is indicated for patients with valve dysfunction causing heart failure, infection with resistant organisms, the presence of a paravalvular abscess or clinical heart block, and in those with persistent infection despite antibiotic therapy. Early surgery also is reasonable in patients with recurrent emboli due to persistent vegetations and may be considered when a large (>1 cm), mobile native valve vegetation is present on echocardiography, even in the absence of an embolic event. Surgery at a later date may be needed for patients with residual valve dysfunction in the absence of acute heart failure and in those with relapsing prosthetic valve endocarditis. In patients with an implanted cardiac electronic device (e.g., pacer or implanted cardiac defibrillator), evidence of infection on the leads is an indication for early device removal.

Although echocardiography remains the primary imaging approach for diagnosis and management of infective endocarditis, both computed tomographic imaging and positron emission tomographic studies are useful in selected patients. Computed tomographic imaging allows visualization of occluder motion with mechanical valves and provides detailed information about pannus, thrombus, and masses in the paravalvular region ([Fig. 14.22](#page--1-25)). The use of 18-fluorine– fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomographic imaging improves detection of cardiac infection in selected cases. These approaches now are incorporated into guidelines for diagnosis of endocarditis.
