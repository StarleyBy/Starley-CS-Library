[THE ECHO EXAM](#page--1-58) [SUGGESTED READING](#page--1-59)

ardiomyopathy is defined as a primary disease of the myocardium, excluding myocardial dysfunction due to ischemia or chronic valvular disease. Several approaches to the classification of cardiomyopathies are possible, such as etiology or anatomy, but a physiologic classification is most useful clinically. The three basic physiologic categories of cardiomyopathy are: C

- Dilated
- Hypertrophic
- Restrictive

The disease process in an individual patient tends to correspond closely with one of these physiologic categories; however, overlap among these categories (particularly between dilated and restrictive) can occur. Echocardiographic evaluation focuses on confirming the diagnosis and type of cardiomyopathy present and on defining the physiologic consequences of the disease process in that individual.

Although hypertensive and pulmonary heart diseases are not primary diseases of the heart muscle, they are included in this chapter because their clinical and echocardiographic presentations often mimic those of cardiomyopathy. In addition, evaluation of patients receiving advanced heart failure therapies is outlined. End-stage coronary disease resulting in left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, sometimes referred to as ischemic cardiomyopathy, is discussed in Chapter 8.

# DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY

# Basic Principles

Dilated cardiomyopathy manifests clinically as heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Typically, all four chambers are enlarged, and impaired systolic function of both the LV and right ventricle (RV) occurs, due to a wide range of underlying causes [\(Table 9.1\)](#page--1-60). The physiology of dilated cardiomyopathy [\(Fig. 9.1](#page--1-61)) is characterized predominantly by:

- Impaired LV contractility
- Reduced cardiac output
- Elevated LV end-diastolic pressure

Clinically, patients most often have heart failure, with initial complaints ranging from symptoms of pulmonary or systemic venous congestion to symptoms of low forward cardiac output. Secondary mitral regurgitation frequently is present secondary to LV and mitral annular dilation. In addition, pulmonary hypertension develops in many patients in response to the chronic elevation in left atrial (LA) pressure.

#### **Four-chamber dilation**

**Fig. 9.1 Dilated cardiomyopathy.** Four-chamber enlargement is present with reduced LV and RV systolic function. *Dashed lines* indicate the limited extent of endocardial motion between end-diastole and end-systole. An apical thrombus is present. Secondary mitral regurgitation *(MR)* and tricuspid regurgitation *(TR)* are indicated by the *arrows*.

Typically, LV diastolic dysfunction coexists with systolic dysfunction, although separating the hemodynamic effects of diastolic dysfunction from concurrent systolic dysfunction is challenging.

### Echocardiographic Approach

The echocardiographic approach to the patient with heart failure symptoms should start with an evaluation of LV size, wall thickness, and systolic function [\(Figs.](#page--1-62) [9.2](#page--1-62) and [9.3](#page--1-63)). Echocardiographic imaging from standard windows allows evaluation of the size and function

**Fig. 9.2 Echocardiographic approach to the patient with heart failure.** Key features that help distinguish the cause of heart failure symptoms include LV chamber size, wall thickness, and systolic function in addition to RV systolic function. Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction *(HFrEF)* is characterized by global myocardial dysfunction versus regional dysfunction with ischemic disease. Asymmetric hypertrophy suggests hypertrophic cardiomyopathy *(HCM),* whereas concentric hypertrophy is more typical of hypertensive heart disease. When LV size and function are normal, diastolic dysfunction or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction *(HFpEF)* is likely in the absence of pericardial or valve disease. RV dysfunction may be due to primary myocardial disease, such as RV infarction or arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy, or to elevated pulmonary artery pressure *(PAP)* with primary or secondary pulmonary hypertension *(PH).

**Fig. 9.5 M-mode findings in dilated cardiomyopathy.** The mitral M-mode shows increased mitral E-point septal separation *(EPSS)* and a "B-bump" *(left)*. The aortic M-mode shows decreased aortic root motion with early closure of the aortic valve *(right)*.

#### ❐ Doppler

- Reduced aortic ejection velocity
- Reduced rate of rise in ventricular pressure *(dP/dt)*
- Secondary mitral regurgitation
- Diastolic dysfunction

The increase in E-point to septal separation is due to a combination of LV dilation and reduced mitral leaflet motion caused by low transmitral flow rates. Reduced anteroposterior aortic root motion reflects reduced LA filling and emptying [\(Fig. 9.5](#page--1-65)). A reduced aortic ejection velocity indicates a reduced stroke

volume, although compensatory mechanisms (including LV dilation) often result in a normal stroke volume at rest. A slow rate of rise in velocity of the mitral regurgitant jet indicates a reduced rate of rise in LV pressure in early systole *(dP/dt)*.

The cause of secondary mitral valve regurgitation (with an anatomically normal valve) is related to misalignment of the papillary muscles, ventricular systolic dysfunction, and annular dilation. Regurgitant severity ranges from mild to severe, as assessed with Doppler techniques [\(Fig. 9.6;](#page-4-0) see Table 12.8). Pulmonary pressures usually are elevated and can be estimated from the velocity of the tricuspid regurgitant jet, as described in Chapter 6.

The echocardiographic appearance of dilated cardiomyopathy is fairly uniform despite a wide range of disease processes. Exceptions include fulminant myocarditis, in which little ventricular dilation is present, despite severe systolic dysfunction. In Chagas heart disease, an LV apical aneurysm is seen in about half of patients; thrombus formation is often seen, although global hypokinesis is typical with advanced disease ([Fig. 9.7\)](#page-4-1). Tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy is an acute, transient, stress-induced cardiomyopathy characterized by "apical ballooning" with apical dilation and dyskinesis but preserved dimensions and function of the cardiac base ([Fig. 9.8](#page--1-66)).

Diastolic dysfunction typically accompanies systolic heart failure in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and noninvasive estimates of filling pressures are helpful in clinical management. When systolic dysfunction is present, the elevated end-systolic volume results in a

**Fig. 9.8 Tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy.** This older woman developed acute heart failure after emergency noncardiac surgery. In the apical fourchamber view, the LV apex is dilated with systolic dyskinesis *(arrows)* with relatively preserved contraction at the myocardial base. Coronary angiography was normal, and ventricular systolic function returned to normal within 2 weeks.

**Fig. 9.9 Doppler findings in dilated cardiomyopathy.** LV diastolic inflow shows a high *E* velocity and low *A* velocity suggestive of "pseudonormalization" due to an elevated end-diastolic pressure *(left)*. The mitral regurgitant *(MR)* jet shows a slow rate of rise in velocity consistent with a reduced *dP/dt (right)*.

shift along the pressure-volume curve to a steeper segment. This means that, for a given diastolic pressure-volume relationship, compliance is reduced at higher LV volumes. Thus the expected pattern of diastolic filling in dilated cardiomyopathy is that of reduced compliance: a high *E* velocity, rapid deceleration slope, low *A* velocity, and an *E/A* ratio >1 ([Fig.](#page--1-67) [9.9](#page--1-67)). When filling pressures are elevated, the *E/E′* ratio is increased to 15 or higher, and the pulmonary vein *a*-wave velocity and duration are increased. The M-mode finding of a delayed rate of mitral valve closure, termed a "B-bump" or "AC-shoulder" also correlates with an elevated end-diastolic pressure (see [Fig. 9.5\)](#page--1-65). However, patterns of diastolic dysfunction can be complex in patients with a dilated cardiomyopathy and vary with volume status, medical therapy, and phase of the disease course.

When significant LV systolic dysfunction is present (ejection fraction <35%), a careful search for apical LV thrombus is indicated, although prevalence is low with current medical therapy ([Fig. 9.10\)](#page--1-68). Details on the technical aspects of identifying an LV thrombus are given in Chapter 8.

# Limitations and Technical Considerations

Echocardiography rarely can establish the etiology of dilated cardiomyopathy, even though it is instrumental both in confirming the presence of ventricular dysfunction and in providing prognostic data. The accuracy of measures of ventricular volumes and ejection fraction depend on attention to data acquisition and analysis, as discussed in Chapter 6. In addition to the technical aspects in the evaluation of diastolic dysfunction, as

![](_page_6_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 9.10 Left ventricular apical thrombus.** In the apical two-chamber *(A2C)* view *(left)* in a patient with dilated cardiomyopathy, endocardial definition is poor, but no obvious LV mass is noted. With left-sided contrast to opacify the LV, a nonopacified apical mass consistent with thrombus *(arrow)* is seen. The use of left-sided echo contrast *(right)* improves sensitivity for detection of thrombus by enhancing the blood-thrombus border.

discussed in Chapter 7, diastolic function and systolic function are inseparable parts of cardiac performance. Isolating the effects of diastolic dysfunction from the altered loading conditions related to systolic dysfunction can be problematic. Most patients have combined systolic and diastolic dysfunction, with both contributing to clinical symptoms and outcomes.

# Clinical Utility

Echocardiography plays a key role in the evaluation and management of patients with heart failure. The correlation between echocardiographic findings and specific causes of heart failure is shown in [Table 9.2.](#page--1-69) If echocardiography shows no significant impairment of LV systolic dysfunction, other possible diagnoses include:

- Coronary artery disease
- Valve disease
- Hypertensive heart disease
- Pericardial disease
- Pulmonary heart disease

Whenever the clinical presentation suggests heart failure, a comprehensive examination of systolic and diastolic function is needed, even when the core echocardiographic examination does not show obvious evidence of dysfunction. If the echocardiogram is consistent with the clinical diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy, detailed information on ventricular function, chamber sizes, associated valvular disease, and pulmonary artery pressures should be obtained.

Periodic echocardiography is essential for optimal care of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. The detailed assessment available by echocardiography aids in the appropriate tailoring of medical therapy. In addition, repeat echocardiography is helpful when a change in clinical status suggests an interval change in ventricular function. Myocardial dyssynchrony can be evaluated by tissue Doppler and speckle tracking techniques [\(Fig. 9.11](#page--1-64)) although the role of this information in clinical practice not well established.

In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy in the intensive care unit, echocardiographic evaluation can be helpful in to assess LV function, pulmonary artery pressures, and the degree of coexisting mitral regurgitation and to estimate LV filling pressure. Evaluation of an individual patient's response to afterload reduction therapy can be performed by repeat ejection fraction measurements or by sequential noninvasive measurements of pulmonary pressures and cardiac output ([Fig. 9.12\)](#page--1-70).

# Alternate Approaches

Evaluation of a patient with new-onset heart failure typically includes a careful clinical evaluation and laboratory data. In many patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, an exact etiology cannot be identified, even when all diagnostic modalities are used. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging provides evaluation of myocardial fibrosis and inflammation. The possibility of an ischemic cause of LV systolic dysfunction relies on visualization of coronary anatomy by computed tomography or at cardiac catheterization. If exact

measurement of pulmonary vascular resistance is needed (e.g., in a heart transplant candidate), cardiac catheterization is indicated because noninvasive approaches provide only an estimate of pulmonary vascular resistance.

# HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY

# Basic Principles

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an autosomal dominant inherited disease of the myocardium (with variable penetrance) related to abnormalities in genes coding for contractile proteins. Characteristic anatomic features of this disease [\(Fig. 9.13\)](#page--1-71) include:

- Asymmetric hypertrophy of the LV
- Normal LV systolic function
- Impaired diastolic LV function
- Dynamic subaortic LV outflow obstruction

Other important clinical features of this disease are a high risk of sudden death (especially during exertion); symptoms of angina, exercise intolerance, and syncope; a high prevalence of atrial fibrillation; and a systolic murmur on cardiac auscultation.

The pattern and degree of LV hypertrophy in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can be quite variable [\(Fig. 9.14](#page--1-72)). The septum often is primarily hypertrophied at the base with a sigmoid shape of the septum, or severe septal hypertrophy can occur, with bulging into the LV chamber. With apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy severe hypertrophy is confined to the LV apex, sometimes with near obliteration of the LV cavity in systole. The common feature of all these hypertrophy patterns is normal thickness (or "sparing") of the basal posterior LV wall.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is classified as:

- Nonobstructive (about one third of patients) if the outflow gradient at rest and with provocation is <30 mmHg
- Obstructive if the gradient at rest is ≥30 mmHg (>2.7 m/s)
- Provocable or latent if the resting gradient is <30 mmHg but obstruction occurs with exercise (or other maneuvers)

![](_page_10_Figure_17.jpeg)

**Fig. 9.13 Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.** Typical findings include asymmetric septal hypertrophy with sparing of the basal posterior wall and normal LV systolic function with impaired diastolic function. When dynamic outflow tract obstruction is present, systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets, mid-systolic closure and coarse fluttering of the aortic valve leaflets, and mitral regurgitation (MR; *blue arrow*) are noted. *Ao,* Aorta.

**Fig. 9.14 Septal hypertrophy.** 2D images of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in (A) a parasternal long-axis *(PLAX)* view at end-diastole for measurement of septal and posterior wall thickness. The septum is markedly thickened with a normal thickness of the basal inferior-lateral (posterior) wall. (B) The parasternal short-axis *(PSAX)* view shows hypertrophy involving the anterior and inferior septum. *Ao,* Aorta.

<span id="page-11-0"></span>![](_page_11_Figure_3.jpeg)

With dynamic obstruction, one sees an increase in flow velocity, and corresponding pressure gradient, proximal to the aortic valve, in association with systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve toward the hypertrophied ventricular septum [\(Fig. 9.15](#page--1-64)). Obstruction is dynamic rather than fixed, both in the sense that it occurs only in mid to late systole and in the sense that the presence and severity of obstruction can be altered by loading conditions. These features contrast with the relatively fixed obstruction of aortic valve stenosis, which persists from the onset to the end of ejection and in which the severity of the stenosis is relatively insensitive to changes in loading conditions. Dynamic outflow obstruction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy typically has a pattern of onset in mid-systole, with the maximum LV to aortic pressure gradient occurring in late systole.

Obstruction can be diminished by maneuvers that increase ventricular volume (e.g., an increase in preload or a decrease in contractility) or by maneuvers that increase afterload. Conversely, the degree of obstruction is increased by:

- Reduced preload
- Increased contractility
- Decreased afterload

Each of these physiologic changes results in a decrease in LV volume and an increase in the degree of dynamic obstruction, with a louder murmur and an increased Doppler velocity.

Dynamic outflow obstruction usually is associated with mitral regurgitation because the systolic anterior motion of the leaflets disrupts normal coaptation. A posteriorly directed mitral regurgitant jet of mild to moderate severity originates at the malcoapted segment of the leaflets ([Fig. 9.16\)](#page--1-73).

LV systolic function typically is normal in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. However, LV diastolic function is abnormal, with impaired relaxation and decreased compliance, thus accounting for many of the heart failure symptoms in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

# Echocardiographic Approach *Asymmetric Left Ventricular Hypertrophy*

Evaluation of the pattern and extent of LV hypertrophy is made from multiple tomographic 2D image planes. In the parasternal long-axis view, particular attention is focused on the posterior basal wall between the papillary muscle and the mitral annulus. Although the wall in this region is not thickened in most patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, it is thickened in patients with concentric hypertrophy due to other etiologies (e.g., hypertension, infiltrative cardiomyopathy). 2D guided M-mode tracings are used for the measurement of septal and posterior wall thickness, by using both long- and short-axis views to ensure that the measurements are perpendicular to the LV wall and to avoid inclusion of RV trabeculation in the septal wall thickness. Careful measurements of diastolic septal thickness provide prognostic information (e.g., risk of sudden death) and are essential for decision making about septal reduction procedures.

![](_page_12_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 9.16 Mitral systolic anterior motion and mitral regurgitation in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.** In this parasternal long-axis 2D image *(left)* and color flow image *(right),* systolic anterior motion *(SAM)* and mitral regurgitation *(MR)* are seen. The posteriorly directed MR jet originates from malcoaptation of a mitral leaflet segment in association with systolic anterior motion. Turbulence in the LV outflow tract *(LVOT)* is seen because of subaortic dynamic obstruction. *Ao,* Aorta.

The parasternal long-axis view also offers the best opportunity to define the exact relationship between the pattern of septal hypertrophy and the outflow tract. This is important when a surgical approach, such as septal myectomy, is being considered because surgical visualization usually is retrograde across the aortic valve, thereby allowing only limited direct inspection of the septal endocardium and little information on the extent of septal thickening or the degree of septal curvature. The extent and pattern of hypertrophy also are relevant if alcohol septal ablation is being considered. Parasternal short-axis views from base to apex allow assessment of the medial to lateral extent of the hypertrophic process.

It is important to recognize that some degree of bulging of the septum into the LV outflow tract, often called a septal "knuckle," is seen in normal older individuals. This apparent septal prominence most likely is due to increased tortuosity of the aorta that results in a more acute angle between the basal septum and aortic root. Most patients with this anatomy do not have convincing clinical features of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Apical views are essential for complete visualization of the pattern and extent of hypertrophy. Diagnosis of apical hypertrophy can be difficult because endocardial definition may be poor, and the endocardial surface (which is located up to one third the distance from the apical epicardium to the base) is missed if image quality is suboptimal ([Fig. 9.17\)](#page--1-74). In some cases, the

![](_page_12_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Fig. 9.17 Apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.** Marked thickening of the apical segments is noted in the apical four-chamber view.

epicardium is mistaken for the apical endocardium. A careful examination, when the referring physician has alerted the echocardiographer to this possible diagnosis, avoids this potential pitfall. Color or pulsed Doppler examination is helpful in demonstrating the absence of blood flow in the "apical" region, which is occupied by the hypertrophied myocardium. If needed, echo contrast can be used to define the endocardial border more clearly. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations of LV systolic function are performed using standard approaches (see Chapter 6).

### *Left Ventricular Diastolic Function*

Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy often have a pattern of LV diastolic filling consistent with impaired relaxation. Typical changes include a reduced *E* velocity, enhanced *A* velocity, and increased duration and velocity of the pulmonary vein *a*-reversal. These findings are consistent with impaired diastolic relaxation and an elevated LV end-diastolic pressure. However, the evaluation of diastolic dysfunction in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is problematic because of the numerous confounding factors in these patients. Many of the parameters validated in other patient groups are not accurate in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, including only a modest correlation between *E/E′* and LV filling pressures.

### *Dynamic Subaortic LV Outflow Tract Obstruction*

In about 70% of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, subaortic obstruction is present, at rest or with exercise, and characterized by:

- ❐ Systolic anterior motion of the mitral leaflet
- ❐ Mid-systolic closure of the aortic valve
- ❐ Late-peaking, high-velocity flow in the outflow tract

- ❐ Variability in the severity of obstruction with maneuvers:
  - Post-premature ventricular contraction beats
  - Valsalva maneuver
  - Exercise

**IMAGING.** In a patient with dynamic LV outflow tract obstruction, long-axis images show the classic finding of systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve with apposition of the mitral leaflet and septum in mid to late systole. M-mode recordings are helpful in that, with pathologic systolic anterior motion, the rate of anterior leaflet motion is more rapid than the anterior motion of the posterior wall in systole [\(Fig. 9.18](#page--1-75)). A "contact lesion" on the ventricular septum at the site of mitral leaflet impingement is seen in some patients.

Short-axis views also show the systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. Frame-by-frame analysis shows the cross-sectional area of the outflow tract throughout systole.

Apical 2D views are helpful for demonstrating the abnormal mitral leaflet motion, especially the apical long-axis and the anteriorly angulated four-chamber views. Note that the degree of systolic anterior motion is not always uniform from medial to lateral across the mitral leaflets, so imaging in multiple planes with slight adjustments in transducer angulation are needed to demonstrate the presence and extent of dynamic outflow obstruction.

The aortic valve shows normal leaflet opening in early systole, followed by mid-systolic abrupt partial closure with coarse fluttering of the aortic valve leaflets in late systole due to late systolic dynamic outflow obstruction. Again, these rapid leaflet movements are

**Fig. 9.18 M-mode findings in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.** M-mode at the mitral valve level *(left)* in a patient with dynamic outflow obstruction shows classic septal hypertrophy and systolic anterior motion of the mitral leaflets *(arrows)*. An M-mode view at the aortic valve level *(right)* shows mid-systolic closure of the aortic valve *(arrow)* followed by coarse fluttering of the leaflets.

best documented on M-mode recordings. Often the aortic leaflets themselves are sclerotic because of the long-term effect of a turbulent jet as a result of subaortic obstruction, with some degree of coexisting aortic regurgitation.

**DOPPLER EVALUATION.** Doppler studies provide a more direct evaluation of the presence, location, and degree of dynamic subaortic obstruction than do imaging techniques. With conventional pulsed or color flow imaging, the site of obstruction is identified based on the location of the poststenotic turbulence. Both parasternal and apical long-axis views are useful for this examination.

Using pulsed Doppler from an apical approach, the sample volume is slowly moved from the apex progressively toward the base, recording the velocity curve at each step. Proximal to the outflow obstruction, velocities are normal. At the site of obstruction, the velocity increases abruptly to a velocity reflecting the degree of obstruction (as stated in the Bernoulli equation). This approach, using stepwise evaluation with pulsed Doppler ultrasound, is advantageous in that intracavity gradients due to apical hypertrophy or apposition of the papillary muscle with the septum will be recognized and not mistaken for subaortic dynamic obstruction.

Continuous-wave (CW) Doppler from an apical approach typically shows a late-peaking, high-velocity systolic jet in patients with a dynamic LV outflow tract obstruction [\(Fig. 9.19\)](#page-14-0). The shape of this curve is distinctive, corresponding to the temporal course of the LV to aortic pressure gradient (see [Fig. 9.15](#page-11-0)).

**LATENT OUTFLOW OBSTRUCTION.** Some patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have dynamic outflow obstruction with exercise but not at rest. Traditionally, maneuvers to "provoke" outflow obstruction at rest were performed during the echocardiography examination. A spontaneous premature ventricular contraction (PVC) results in an increased degree of obstruction on the post-PVC beat due to increased LV contractility. The strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver increases obstruction by decreasing preload (smaller LV cavity size), but it is difficult to perform simultaneously with echocardiography because of changes in cardiac position and lung interference as the patient performs the maneuver. In the past, amyl nitrate inhalation was used to induce a brief decrease in preload (venodilation) and decrease in afterload (arterial dilation), both of which increase the degree of obstruction. However, these maneuvers are no longer recommended because of low reproducibly and limited clinical value.

The optimal approach to evaluate for provocable obstruction is a supine bicycle or upright treadmill exercise stress test. CW Doppler outflow velocity recordings are made at rest and immediately after exercise to assess for inducible outflow obstruction, defined as an exercise outflow tract gradient ≥30 mmHg (velocity ≥2.7 m/s) ([Fig. 9.20\)](#page--1-76). Pharmacologic stress testing with dobutamine is not recommended because it is nonspecific (mid-cavity obstruction is seen even in normal individuals) and does not provide information on exercise capacity or the relationship of symptoms to exertion.

<span id="page-14-0"></span>**Fig. 9.19 Dynamic outflow obstruction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.** Resting outflow obstruction in this patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was evaluated from the apical view *(left)* with color and pulsed Doppler to localize the level of obstruction.

CW Doppler *(right)* shows the high-velocity, late-peaking *(arrow)* jet typical of dynamic outflow obstruction. *LVOT obstr.,* LV outflow tract obstruction.

The mitral valve is anatomically and functionally abnormal in the majority of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Anatomically, the leaflets are larger than in normal individuals. Functionally, mitral regurgitation results from systolic anterior motion of the leaflets into the outflow tract that leads to late systolic failure of coaptation and a consequent posteriorly directed regurgitant jet. Mitral regurgitant severity

**Fig. 9.20 Provoked dynamic outflow obstruction.** Supine bicycle stress testing in a 45-year-old man with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy showed an LV outflow tract velocity that peaked in mid-systole at 2.6 m/s during rest *(left)* consistent with no significant obstruction. Peak stress Doppler data *(right)* documented provoked obstruction with a late-peaking LV outflow signal with a maximum velocity of 5.5 m/s. The velocity scale on the baseline and peak Doppler recordings have matched in this example. *(From Owens DS, Otto CM: Exercise testing for structural heart disease. In Gillam L, Otto CM, editors:* Advanced Approaches in Echocardiography: Practical Echocardiography Series, *Philadelphia, 2012, Saunders, Fig. 11-14.)*

This patient was anemic and febrile at the time of this examination. Hypertensive hyperdynamic mid-cavity obstruction must be distinguished from the dynamic subaortic obstruction seen in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

typically is moderate but ranges from mild to severe and varies dynamically with the severity of outflow obstruction. Evaluation of mitral valve anatomy and severity of regurgitation is detailed in Chapter 12.

# Limitations and Technical Considerations

When a high-velocity outflow signal is detected with CW Doppler, other techniques are needed to determine the depth of origin of the signal because velocities are measured along the entire length of the ultrasound beam. In some patients with hypertensive heart disease or hypovolemia, the combination of LV hypertrophy and hyperdynamic systolic function results in a latepeaking, high-velocity systolic waveform ([Fig. 9.21\)](#page--1-77) similar to that seen in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. However, in these patients the site of obstruction is not subaortic; it is closer to the apex, at the midventricular level.

The distinction between hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and a hyperdynamic concentrically hypertrophied ventricle can be made by careful attention to the 2D images (sparing of the basal posterior wall in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) and by evaluating the depth of origin of the high-velocity jet using conventional pulsed, high pulse repetition frequency (HPRF), and color Doppler techniques. The patient's clinical and family histories also are important for making this distinction. Genetic testing is increasingly a routine part of the diagnostic evaluation.

Distinguishing between the signal due to dynamic subaortic obstruction and mitral regurgitation can be challenging because both are common with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and both are high-velocity systolic signals directed away from the apex. The two features that are helpful in this distinction are: (1)

(B) The mitral regurgitation signal *(blue)* starts earlier and ends later in systole, has a high velocity throughout the ejection period, and is higher in velocity than LV outflow.

the shape of the velocity curve (late peaking with subaortic obstruction versus a rapid early systolic rise in velocity with mitral regurgitation) and (2) the timing of flow (mitral regurgitation is longer in duration, starting earlier and ending later in the cardiac cycle) [\(Fig. 9.22](#page--1-78)).

### Clinical Utility

### *Diagnosis and Screening*

Echocardiography is the procedure of choice for the accurate diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Because this is an inherited disorder, screening with echocardiography is indicated for all first-degree relatives of the affected individual. This diagnosis significantly affects clinical management even in asymptomatic individuals, given the high risk of sudden death with exertion, and it has important implications for genetic counseling. Doppler diastolic tissue velocities are reduced even in the absence LV hypertrophy and help identify genetically affected family members early in the disease course.

### *Evaluation of Medical Therapy*

In patients with a definite diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Doppler findings can be used to assess the impact of medical therapy. Specifically, the pattern of LV diastolic filling after the institution of therapy to improve diastolic function (e.g., beta blockers or calcium channel blockers) shows an improvement in early diastolic filling. The degree of dynamic outflow obstruction also may be reduced with medical therapy.

# *Selection of Patients for Implantable Cardiac Defibrillators*

Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is based on implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) placement in patients with a combination of risk factors for sudden death. Definite risk factors are sustained or frequent nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, recurrent unexplained syncope, a family history of sudden death, an abnormal blood pressure response to exercise, and extreme LV hypertrophy (septal diastolic wall thickness >30 mm). Other risk factors include high-risk genetic defects. Outflow obstruction is considered only a minor risk factor for sudden cardiac death.

### *Monitoring of Alcohol Septal Ablation*

Echocardiography plays a key role in patient selection for catheter septal ablation procedures and for monitoring the procedure in the catheterization laboratory. In the patient being considered for alcohol septal ablation or surgical treatment for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, knowledge of the extent, distribution, and curvature of septal hypertrophy determines the location and size of the muscle segment to be removed or ablated. In the catheterization laboratory, contrast is injected during echocardiographic imaging, with the catheter positioned in a septal coronary branch to show the specific location and extent of the area perfused by that vessel before the delivery of the ablation agent [\(Fig. 9.23\)](#page--1-64). Baseline and postprocedure Doppler data are used in conjunction with invasive hemodynamics to assess the reduction in outflow

**Fig. 9.23 Catheter septal ablation for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.** An apical four-chamber view shows contrast in the septum *(arrows)* defining the area perfused by the septal branch that will be injected with the ablation agent. At baseline, Doppler demonstrated severe obstruction with a late-peaking outflow tract velocity of 5 m/s *(top)*. After the septal ablation, the maximum velocity was 1.4 m/s *(bottom)*.

![](_page_17_Figure_4.jpeg)

obstruction. After the procedure, sequential echocardiographic studies may show continued improvement in the extent of outflow obstruction due to healing and fibrosis of the infarcted septal myocardium.

# *Surgical Therapy*

Intraoperative monitoring of septal myectomy allows evaluation of the adequacy of the procedure in relieving outflow tract obstruction. Transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) imaging often provides adequate images of the myectomy site; however, epicardial imaging can be helpful because the septum is located anteriorly relative to the esophagus. Doppler evaluation for residual obstruction following cardiopulmonary bypass should be performed under hemodynamic conditions as similar as possible to the baseline state because the degree of obstruction is influenced by loading conditions. Color flow imaging is helpful in excluding residual obstruction, but when the subaortic flow pattern remains abnormal, quantitative Doppler velocity data are needed. Careful examination for a postoperative ventricular septal defect also should be performed.

It often is difficult to obtain an accurate CW Doppler recording of the degree of outflow obstruction in the operating room because the TEE approach rarely provides a transgastric apical view from which the beam can be aligned parallel to the jet. An epicardial apical position may not be obtainable with a median sternotomy because the transducer often is too large to fit under the ribs at the apex. Placement of a sterile transducer on the ascending aorta with inferior angulation toward the outflow tract allows a parallel intercept angle in some patients (see Chapter 18).

# Alternate Approaches

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging provides an accurate and detailed assessment of the pattern and degree of hypertrophy. Cine images demonstrate systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve and outflow obstruction. Patchy areas of late gadolinium enhancement in the myocardium are supportive of a diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

In some patients, cardiac catheterization is helpful. First, evaluation of coronary anatomy may be indicated because coexisting epicardial coronary artery disease explains symptoms in some patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Second, recordings of LV and aortic pressures at rest and after provocative maneuvers to increase or decrease dynamic outflow obstruction and with slow "pullback" across the outflow tract and aortic valve allow more detailed hemodynamic evaluation. This is particularly helpful in the patient with sequential stenoses in the subaortic region and at the aortic valve level. In the operating room, direct LV and aortic pressure measurements after myectomy are helpful if residual obstruction is suspected.

# RESTRICTIVE CARDIOMYOPATHY

# Basic Principles

Restrictive cardiomyopathy is characterized by heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and predominant diastolic dysfunction due to a stiff and thickened myocardium ([Fig. 9.24\)](#page--1-79). Heart failure is due to the inability to maintain a normal cardiac output or maintenance of a normal cardiac output only with an elevated LV end-diastolic pressure. Thus the initial clinical presentation tends to include signs

![](_page_18_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 9.24 Restrictive cardiomyopathy.** Typical features include a thickwalled, small LV with impaired diastolic function, LA and RA enlargement, and signs of secondary pulmonary hypertension, including paradoxical septal motion and a high-velocity tricuspid regurgitant *(TR)* jet.

and symptoms of low cardiac output, including fatigue and decreased exercise tolerance; right heart failure may also be prominent, with peripheral edema and ascites.

As the disease progresses, an individual patient progresses from an anatomic or hemodynamic pattern consistent with restrictive cardiomyopathy to a pattern showing some features of dilated cardiomyopathy, ending with a picture indistinguishable from dilated cardiomyopathy. Compared with dilated cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy is an uncommon diagnosis. Causes of restrictive cardiomyopathy include systemic diseases with accumulation of cells or protein in the myocardial interstitium, storage diseases with accumulation of material within myocardial cells, and processes that affect the endocardium (see [Table 9.1](#page--1-60)).

# Echocardiographic Approach *Anatomic Features*

Typical echocardiographic features [\(Fig. 9.25\)](#page--1-72) in the untreated patient with restrictive cardiomyopathy include:

- Nondilated, thick-walled LV
- Normal LV systolic function
- Abnormal LV diastolic function
- RV free wall thickening
- Biatrial enlargement
- Moderate pulmonary hypertension
- Elevated right atrial (RA) pressure (dilated inferior vena cava)

Tissue Doppler imaging *(right)* shows severely reduced diastolic tissue Doppler velocities. *Ao,* Aorta.

Echocardiography usually cannot identify the cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy, but some features support a specific diagnosis (see [Table 9.2\)](#page--1-69). The classic "speckled" myocardium of amyloidosis is nonspecific, particularly with harmonic imaging. However, amyloid frequently also affects the valves, the conduction system, and the coronary microvasculature. Hemochromatosis results in conduction disease, in addition to a dilated or restrictive cardiomyopathy. Fabry disease is characterized by symmetric or asymmetric ventricular hypertrophy (which appears similar to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), conduction defects, and, late in the disease, aortic root dilation. A hyperechoic endocardium helps distinguish Fabry disease from other causes of ventricular hypertrophy [\(Fig. 9.26\)](#page--1-75). Sarcoidosis often causes conduction defects, and pericardial effusions are common. In hypereosinophilic syndrome, LV thrombus formation occurs in the absence of an underlying wall motion abnormality (particularly in the apex), thus resulting in gradual apical "obliteration" (as seen on angiography) or filling in of the apex with an echogenic mass (on echocardiography). Thrombus formation also occurs under the posterior mitral valve leaflet and leads to adherence of the posterior leaflet to the endocardium and significant mitral regurgitation. Heart disease related to radiation therapy results in a restrictive cardiomyopathy of both the LV and the RV and in accelerated calcific valve disease and coronary atherosclerosis of the segments within the radiation field.

# *Diastolic Function*

The pattern of LV diastolic filling parallels the abnormalities in LV diastolic function in this disease.

**Fig. 9.26 Fabry disease.** The apical four-chamber view in this patient with Fabry disease shows increased LV wall thickness with increased echodensity of the endocardium, particularly along the septum *(arrows)*.

However, interpretation is complicated both by the numerous confounding factors that affect LV diastolic filling (see Chapter 7) and by temporal changes in diastolic filling as the disease progresses in an individual patient. Early in the disease course, impaired diastolic relaxation of the LV results in impaired early diastolic filling. The Doppler LV inflow curve shows reduced *E* velocity, increased *A* velocity, prolonged isovolumic relaxation time, and decreased early diastolic deceleration slope. The mitral annular tissue Doppler signal shows reduced *E′* and increased *A′* velocity [\(Fig. 9.27](#page--1-80)). The pulmonary vein flow curve shows a reduced diastolic filling phase and normal systolic filling phase, which results in a decreased ratio of systolic to diastolic pulmonary venous flow.

RA filling patterns, recorded in the hepatic vein (or superior vena cava), correspond to physical examination of the neck vein pulsations seen in patients

![](_page_19_Figure_10.jpeg)

**Fig. 9.27 Diastolic function in restrictive cardiomyopathy.** LV diastolic filling in a patient with a restrictive cardiomyopathy shows pseudonormalization with an *E* velocity slightly greater than the *A* velocity *(top)*. This pattern is distinguished from normal by the tissue Doppler myocardial velocity *(bottom)* showing reduced early motion *(E′),* compared with the motion after atrial contraction *(A′)*.

with restrictive cardiomyopathy. Using this analogy, the hepatic vein flow pattern typically shows:

- A prominent reverse flow phase with atrial contraction (*a*-wave)
- A rapid filling curve in systole (*x*-descent)
- A blunted RA diastolic filling phase (diminished *v*-wave and *y*-descent)

These findings correspond to the pattern of RA pressure recordings at catheterization; the *x*-descent represents the "dip," and the blunted systolic filling phase represents the "plateau" of the dip-and-plateau pattern.

As the disease progresses, LA pressure rises, resulting in an increased pressure gradient from the LA to the LV at mitral valve opening. Along with reduced diastolic compliance of the LV, this increased mitral opening pressure leads to an increased *E* velocity and a rapid deceleration slope. The *A* velocity is reduced because of a combination of increased LV end-diastolic pressure and reduced atrial contractile function. Thus the pattern of diastolic filling in established restrictive cardiomyopathy (which may coincide with the initial clinical presentation) is similar to the "big *E*, little *A*" pattern seen in normal young individuals. However, this "pseudonormal" pattern of LV filling can be distinguished from normal by:

- The rapid early diastolic deceleration time (LV inflow)
- A reduced *E′* velocity (annular tissue velocity)
- An increased PVa velocity and duration
- The patient's age, clinical presentation, and other associated echocardiographic findings

With a pseudonormal LV inflow pattern, mitral annular velocity shows a marked reduction in *E′* velocity with the ratio of transmitral *E* velocity to annular *E′* velocity corresponding to the elevation in LV end-diastolic pressure. In addition, pulmonary venous inflow in diastole is normal or increased as blood flows in a conduit from the pulmonary veins to LV. With atrial contraction, the increased resistance to LV filling results in an increase in the velocity and duration of the atrial flow reversal into the lower resistance pulmonary veins. Thus pulmonary venous flow shows an increased diastolic phase, a reduced systolic phase, and prominent *a*-wave flow reversal. This is in contrast to the normal pattern of nearly equal systolic and diastolic pulmonary venous inflow curves and a small *a*-wave.

Late in the disease course, a restrictive pattern of LV filling is seen with an increased *E* velocity and reduced *A* velocity, a steep early diastolic deceleration slope, and reduced isovolumic relaxation time.

# Limitations and Technical Considerations

Differentiation between restrictive cardiomyopathy and constrictive pericarditis is problematic. Both have a similar clinical presentation, and both are characterized by preserved LV systolic function with impaired diastolic filling. Features that distinguish these two conditions include the patterns of atrial and ventricular diastolic filling, the presence or absence of pericardial thickening, and the degree of associated pulmonary hypertension. However, no single feature is diagnostic of either condition (see Table 10.4).

Attention to technical details is necessary in recording Doppler atrial and ventricular filling patterns, particularly attention to their relationship with the phase of respiration (see Chapter 7). Respiratory variation is assessed most reliably by using a respirometer to mark the onsets of inspiration and expiration. Before recording Doppler signals, 2D and color flow imaging is used to convince the sonographer that no significant respiratory variation exists in the angle between the ultrasound beam and direction of blood flow because respiratory changes in intercept angle could result in apparent changes in velocity, even under constant-flow conditions, due to the erroneous assumption that cosine θ remains 1 in the Doppler equation.

# Clinical Utility

In a patient with symptoms of heart failure, a diagnosis of restrictive cardiomyopathy often is not suspected on clinical grounds. In some cases, echocardiographic findings may provide the first clues pointing toward this diagnostic possibility. In a patient with known restrictive cardiomyopathy, echocardiography can be used to follow disease progression. A meticulous examination with careful attention to technical details and with integration of imaging, Doppler, and clinical data allows differentiation between restrictive cardiomyopathy and constrictive pericarditis.

# Alternate Approaches

Clinical history and laboratory tests are important in determining the cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy. Diagnostic evaluation also includes cardiac catheterization with measurement of intracardiac pressures at rest and with volume loading. Endomyocardial biopsy can be diagnostic, although sensitivity is low because of nonhomogeneous myocardial involvement in many of these conditions. Biopsy of noncardiac tissue may be diagnostic for amyloidosis. Chest computed tomographic imaging can exclude pericardial calcification or thickening. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging can detect myocardial iron overload due to hemochromatosis or patchy late gadolinium enhancement with sarcoidosis and can distinguish myocardial involvement due to restrictive cardiomyopathy from constrictive pericarditis.

# OTHER CARDIOMYOPATHIES

### Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia

Arrhythmogenic RV dysplasia (ARVD) is a genetic form of cardiomyopathy that results in fibrofatty replacement of the RV wall and clinical manifestations of RV systolic dysfunction, arrhythmias, and sudden death. Echocardiographic findings include RV dilation and systolic dysfunction in the presence of a relatively normal LV and normal pulmonary pressures ([Fig.](#page--1-81) [9.28\)](#page--1-81). Prominent trabeculation of the RV, increased echogenicity of the moderator band, and small RV aneurysms also may be seen. However, echocardiographic findings are quite variable, and other imaging approaches, such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, are more accurate for this diagnosis.

# Left Ventricular Noncompaction

Isolated LV noncompaction is a genetic cardiomyopathy characterized by decreased coronary flow reserve and a thickened, prominently trabeculated myocardium with deep recesses that communicate with the ventricular chamber [\(Fig. 9.29\)](#page--1-82). A similar pattern of ventricular trabeculation is seen with secondary cardiomyopathies due to neuromuscular diseases and other conditions. Features of noncompaction overlap with the clinical presentation of dilated, hypertrophic, and restrictive cardiomyopathy. Noncompaction manifests clinically with heart failure,

![](_page_21_Figure_10.jpeg)

**Fig. 9.29 Left ventricular noncompaction.** The apical four-chamber view (A) shows the thick LV wall with deep trabecular recesses *(arrows)*. The color flow image (B) shows ventricular flow filling the trabeculated sections of the myocardium.

embolic events, and arrhythmias. Distinguishing echocardiographic features are hypokinesis and myocardial thickening localized to the apex, midlateral, and mid-inferior walls; a ratio of the thickness of the noncompacted to compacted myocardium at end-systole ≥2 :1; and color Doppler showing flow extending into the trabecular recesses.

# ADVANCED HEART FAILURE THERAPIES

# Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy

Variability in the timing of myocardial contraction between different LV segments, or dyssynchrony, is evident on 2D imaging in many patients with heart failure; it can be quantitated with 3D wall motion analysis or with tissue Doppler or speckle tracking echocardiography. Dyssynchrony in the timing of RV and LV contraction also can be evaluated using M-mode or spectral Doppler approaches. It is plausible that measurement of mechanical dyssynchrony (rather than electrical dyssynchrony as seen on electrocardiography) should identify which patients might benefit from pacer therapy to resynchronize the pattern of contraction. However, clinical trials do not yet support the use of dyssynchrony measures; instead, resynchronization therapy is recommended in patients with heart failure and significant symptoms, a wide QRS (over 120 ms), and an LV ejection fraction 35% or less.

# Left Ventricular Assist Devices

Mechanical support with an LV assist device (LVAD) [\(Fig. 9.30](#page--1-72)) can be used to maintain a normal cardiac output in patients with acute heart failure until myocardial recovery occurs or until the patient can receive a heart transplant. An LVAD also is used as destination therapy for long-term support

![](_page_22_Figure_9.jpeg)

**Fig. 9.30 Left ventricular assist device.** Example of a continuous flow LV assist device with low-velocity inflow recorded from the apical cannula and outflow recorded in the ascending aorta. The aortic valve remains closed throughout systole on most beats with this type of LV assist device.

where recovery or transplantation is not likely to occur. Echocardiographic evaluation of patients with an LVAD is challenging, in part because current devices provide continuous rather than pulsatile flow, with blood intake into the device from a cannula at the LV apex, with blood pumped back into the ascending aorta. Imaging shows severe LV systolic dysfunction. In addition, the aortic valve may remain closed throughout the cardiac cycle because blood is pumped from the LV to the aorta without crossing the valve.

Flow patterns and expected velocity data vary among devices, but changes among studies often are most important in clinical decision making. In addition to standard imaging, as in any patient with heart failure, recommended parameters for echocardiographic evaluation of a patient with an LVAD include:

- Record LVAD type, mode, and pump speed.
- Measure LV dimensions and volumes in standard image planes.
- Record aortic valve motion with M-mode for several cardiac cycles to document aortic valve opening frequency and duration.
- Record LVAD inflow from the apical conduit using color and pulsed Doppler.
- Record LVAD outflow into the ascending aorta with color and pulsed Doppler.

Optimal images of the inflow and outflow cannulas often require oblique nonstandard image plans. Echocardiographic data are used to optimize LVAD flow parameters to avoid underfilling the device, thus causing either low forward flow rates and a dilated ventricle or excessively high flow rates, which can result in cannula obstruction due to a small LV chamber impinging on the inflow cannula orifice. Complications that can be detected include pericardial tamponade (often loculated), RV failure, and thrombus formation.

# Total Artificial Heart

Echocardiographic evaluation of patients with a total artificial heart is limited because the pumping chambers of the artificial heart are plastic and do not allow acoustic access. On transthoracic imaging, RA filling pressures can be estimated from the appearance of the inferior vena cava, but other images usually cannot be obtained. On TEE imaging, views are limited to visualization of the RA and LA, along with the atrioventricular mechanical valves.

# Cardiac Transplantation

Echocardiographic evaluation of a patient after cardiac transplantation typically is directed toward one of three goals: (1) assessment of cardiac anatomy and physiology prompted by a specific clinical problem, (2) the elusive goal of noninvasive diagnosis of early rejection of the transplanted heart, or (3) diagnosis of post-transplant coronary artery disease.

# *Cardiac Allograft Structure and Function*

Common problems encountered in patients after cardiac transplantation include:

- Pericardial effusion, particularly early postoperatively
- RV systolic dysfunction due to inadequate myocardial preservation at the time of transplantation, persistently elevated pulmonary vascular resistance, or transplant rejection
- LV systolic dysfunction due to inadequate myocardial preservation, acute rejection early after transplantation, or superimposed coronary artery disease at a longer interval after transplantation

Primary valvular disease, of course, is uncommon because of screening of donor hearts before transplantation. However, mitral or tricuspid regurgitation secondary to ventricular dysfunction and annular dilation also is seen. Diastolic dysfunction is an early marker of rejection.

Typically, RV and LV size, wall thickness, and systolic function are normal in the absence of perioperative complications or rejection. However, abnormal septal motion, with anterior motion of the septum in systole with a slight decrease in the extent of systolic thickening of the septal myocardium, is the norm. Valvular anatomy and function are normal, with small amounts of mitral, tricuspid, and pulmonic regurgitation present with a prevalence similar to that in normal individuals. The suture lines in the aorta and pulmonary artery often are difficult to appreciate depending on the distance of the suture lines from the valve planes and the type of surgical procedure. A small pericardial effusion is seen early in the postoperative period but rarely persists beyond a few weeks. Pericardial effusions often are loculated because of postoperative pericardial adhesions, so examination in multiple tomographic planes from parasternal, apical, and subcostal windows is essential when this diagnosis is suspected. Some degree of persistent pulmonary hypertension may be present, as calculated from the velocity in the tricuspid regurgitant jet and estimates of RA pressure.

If the surgical approach included anastomoses of the normal and donor atrium, a normal echocardiogram after cardiac transplantation will show biatrial enlargement [\(Fig. 9.31\)](#page--1-68), with a variably prominent ridge between the donor and recipient portions of both the RA and LA. The atrial suture line should not be mistaken for an abnormal atrial mass. When transplantation is performed with anastomosis of the superior and inferior vena cavae for the RA and a

**Fig. 9.31 Post–heart transplant image.** Example of a heart transplant with a prominent anastomosis *(arrow)* between the severely dilated native LA and normal-size donor LA in a parasternal long-axis view (A) and an apical four-chamber view (B) . Typically the residual native atrial size is smaller, with a less obvious bulge at the anastomosis. *Ao,* Aorta.

cuff of tissue with the pulmonary veins for the LA, little atrial enlargement occurs, and suture lines are less evident.

### *Acute Transplant Rejection*

With acute, severe rejection, echocardiography shows increased LV mass, decreased systolic function, and an increase in the echogenicity of the myocardium. However, with mild or early rejection, echocardiographic changes are subtle and are not accurate or reproducible enough to allow adjustment of immunosuppressive medications in individual patients. Instead, proposed approaches to the diagnosis of early rejection have focused on measures of diastolic function, specifically measures of early diastolic relaxation. The Doppler changes in acute rejection include:

- Decreased pressure half-time (increased early diastolic deceleration slope)
- Decreased isovolumetric relaxation time
- Increased *E* velocity

Compared with the patient's own baseline study, a significant change (defined as >20% for *E* velocity and >15% for pressure half-time or isovolumic relaxation time) is consistent with rejection. Tissue Doppler measures are sensitive but not specific for the detection of rejection. In addition, many posttransplant patients have resting tachycardia, with *E/A* fusion, due to cardiac denervation. Some transplant centers have found these measures clinically useful, but most centers continue to rely on endomyocardial biopsy.

# *Post-Transplant Monitoring*

As survival after cardiac transplantation has improved, increasing numbers of patients are seen with posttransplant coronary artery disease. Transplant coronary disease differs from typical atherosclerosis in that both epicardial vessels and the microvasculature are diffusely involved with an accelerated form of intimal hyperplasia. Echocardiographic exercise stress testing has a higher prevalence of false-negative results because of the diffuse disease process masking regional wall motion abnormalities. Dobutamine stress echocardiography is more accurate in this patient population and now is routine at many transplant centers. However, coronary angiography is needed for a definitive diagnosis, often with concurrent intravascular ultrasound examination of the coronary arteries.

# Limitations, Technical Considerations, and Alternate Approaches

The standard method for the evaluation of transplant rejection remains transvenous endomyocardial biopsy. Some centers use echocardiographic (rather than fluoroscopic) guidance for this procedure. Because echocardiographic images are tomographic, any segment of the biopsy catheter going through the image plane will appear to be the "tip." Thus it is crucial to identify the open forceps at the tip for correct identification of the biopsy site. A subcostal window often is most practical because, with the patient supine, clear views of the RV and septum are obtained, and the sonographer is clear of the sterile field (usually the right internal jugular vein approach is used). In some cases, the apical views also are helpful.

# HYPERTENSIVE HEART DISEASE

# Basic Principles

Hypertensive heart disease is an end-organ consequence of systemic hypertension. Chronic systemic pressure overload results in LV hypertrophy to maintain normal wall stress. Initially diastolic function is impaired, whereas systolic function remains normal. With long-standing hypertension, systolic dysfunction and ventricular dilation can occur. Typical echocardiographic findings associated with chronic hypertension include:

- LV hypertrophy
- Diastolic dysfunction
- Ascending aortic dilation
- Aortic valve sclerosis
- Mitral annular calcification
- LA enlargement
- Atrial fibrillation

# Echocardiographic Approach *Ventricular Hypertrophy*

Standard imaging views demonstrate concentric LV hypertrophy with increased wall thickness and a nondilated chamber [\(Fig. 9.32\)](#page--1-61). In contrast to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the pattern of hypertrophy is generally symmetric, including involvement of the basal posterior wall with an increased end-diastolic wall thickness (>11 mm). LV mass can be estimated

![](_page_25_Picture_15.jpeg)

**Fig. 9.32 Hypertensive heart disease.** This parasternal long-axis view shows the typical echocardiographic findings with concentric LV hypertrophy, mitral annular calcification *(MAC),* aortic valve sclerosis *(arrow)*, and increased echogenicity of the ascending aorta *(small arrow)*. *Ao,* Aorta.

from M-mode data, assuming hypertrophy is symmetric, but preferably is calculated from 2D data (see Chapter 6).

### *Diastolic Function*

LV diastolic function is characterized by impaired early diastolic relaxation ([Fig. 9.33](#page--1-80)). This results in a prolonged isovolumic relaxation time, reduced acceleration to a reduced *E* velocity, prolonged early diastolic deceleration slope, an increased *A* velocity, and an *E/A* ratio <1. When LV systolic dysfunction supervenes, the elevated LV end-diastolic pressure and elevated LA pressure result in "pseudonormalization" of this pattern with an enhanced *E* velocity (related to a higher mitral valve opening gradient) and reduced *A* velocity (due to the elevated LV enddiastolic pressure). Coexisting mitral regurgitation also can lead to a "paradoxical" higher *E* velocity despite impaired ventricular relaxation. Interestingly, in individuals with physiologic hypertrophy or "athlete's heart," diastolic dysfunction is not seen even when increased wall thickness is present. In pathologic hypertrophy (due to hypertension), diastolic dysfunction often is the first evidence of end-organ damage, usually antedating clear evidence of anatomic hypertrophy.

![](_page_25_Figure_20.jpeg)

**Fig. 9.33 Diastolic dysfunction in hypertensive heart disease.** LV inflow *(top)* and pulmonary venous flow *(bottom)* in a patient with hypertension and concentric hypertrophy. Mild diastolic dysfunction is present with impaired relaxation as evidenced by the *E/A* ratio <1 and the prolonged deceleration time. However, LV end-diastolic pressure is normal with a low velocity and short duration of the pulmonary vein atrial reversal *(a).*

# *Systolic Function*

Typically, systolic function is preserved early in the disease course. Segmental wall motion abnormalities are not seen unless coexisting coronary artery disease is present. With a small, hypertrophied, normally functioning LV chamber, mid-cavity obliteration occurs at end-systole, with an associated Doppler velocity curve showing a brief, late systolic, high-velocity signal. The duration of this intracavity gradient is briefer than that seen with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the level of obstruction is mid-ventricular rather than subaortic, and systolic anterior motion of the mitral leaflets is not seen. Mid-cavity obliteration is exacerbated by hypovolemia or increased contractility.

# *Other Echocardiographic Findings*

Dilation of the ascending aorta often is present in hypertensive patients and is associated with increased tortuosity of the ascending aorta, arch, and descending aorta. Increased irregular echogenicity of the aortic walls, representing atherosclerosis, also may be noted. In uncomplicated hypertension, the aortic annulus itself is not dilated. The aortic valve leaflets usually show sclerotic changes and associated mild aortic regurgitation. Mitral annular calcification frequently is present in patients with chronic hypertension and is one cause of mild to moderate mitral regurgitation in these patients. LA enlargement is due to a combination of a chronically elevated LV end-diastolic pressure and mitral regurgitation.

### Limitations and Technical Considerations

LV mass determinations are dependent on optimal image quality with clear definition of endocardial and epicardial surfaces and on correct endocardial border tracing at end-diastole and end-systole. Differentiation between hypertensive heart disease and hypertrophic or restrictive heart disease is based on the pattern of hypertrophy, associated echocardiographic findings, and integration of the echocardiographic and clinical data.

# Clinical Utility

### *Diagnosis and Prognosis*

LV mass, measured by echocardiography, is a strong predictor of clinical outcome in patients with hypertension. In subjects with borderline hypertension, increased LV mass identifies a subgroup of patients with a poor prognosis without medical therapy. In patients with definite hypertension, the degree of LV hypertrophy reflects the chronic elevation of systemic pressure, in theory serving as an index of the temporally averaged blood pressure over long periods of time. Thus LV mass is a more accurate method for assessing the severity of hypertension than occasional blood pressure recordings in the physician's office or even 24-hour recordings of blood pressure. Changes in LV mass also are helpful for assessing the long-term effect of medical therapy.

### *Evaluation of Heart Failure Symptoms in a Patient With Hypertension*

In a patient with chronic hypertension, heart failure symptoms may be due to diastolic or systolic LV dysfunction, superimposed coronary artery disease, or superimposed valvular disease. Early in the disease course, pathologic hypertrophy is associated with impaired early diastolic filling. Impaired ventricular filling leads to elevated LA pressures and pulmonary venous hypertension, resulting in dyspnea. Diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction with preserved systolic function can be made by echocardiography and has important clinical implications because the therapy for heart failure symptoms is quite different for diastolic versus systolic dysfunction.

Heart failure symptoms due to hypertension with preserved systolic function and severe LV hypertrophy have been termed *hypertensive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy*. This condition is characterized by normal to hyperdynamic systolic function, concentric hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, and a mid-ventricular late systolic gradient due to cavity obliteration (see [Fig. 9.21](#page--1-77)). Strictly speaking, this combination of findings is not a "cardiomyopathy" and is not an inherited disorder but simply represents severe end-organ damage due to hypertension. However, awareness of this specific clinical picture results in consideration of this diagnosis in patients in whom hypertrophic or restrictive cardiomyopathy otherwise might be suspected.

With long-standing hypertension, impairment of LV contractility can occur, even in the absence of coexisting coronary artery disease. Physiologically, elevated afterload (as in valvular aortic stenosis) is the proximate cause of systolic dysfunction. However, systolic function does not always improve, even with aggressive antihypertensive therapy when systolic dysfunction is long-standing, a finding suggesting that irreversible changes in ventricular contractility have occurred. End-stage hypertensive heart disease has an echocardiographic appearance similar to end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy.

# Alternate Approaches

The need for routine echocardiographic evaluation of patients with hypertension is controversial. Medical management based on intermittent office blood pressure measurements remains standard practice at most medical centers. When needed, estimates of the chronicity of blood pressure elevation can be obtained by 24-hour blood pressure monitors or evaluation of other end-organ damage (e.g., renal function, retinal examination). Although electrocardiographic estimates of LV hypertrophy are less accurate and precise than echocardiographic measurements, the cost differential between these diagnostic tests is substantial.

# PULMONARY HEART DISEASE

# Chronic Versus Acute Pulmonary Disease

Chronic pulmonary hypertension, whether due to intrinsic lung disease, recurrent pulmonary emboli, or primary pulmonary hypertension, results in a group of clinical signs and symptoms termed *cor pulmonale*. The underlying pathophysiology of this clinical syndrome is chronic pressure overload of the RV as it ejects into a high-resistance pulmonary vascular bed. Initially, compensatory hypertrophy occurs with preserved systolic function. Over time, contractility deteriorates, and RV dilation, moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, and consequent RA enlargement are seen [\(Fig. 9.34\)](#page--1-83).

![](_page_27_Figure_7.jpeg)

![](_page_27_Figure_8.jpeg)

**Fig. 9.34 Pulmonary heart disease.** RV hypertrophy *(RVH)* and enlargement *(RVE)* are seen with paradoxical septal motion. Secondary tricuspid regurgitation *(TR)* and RA enlargement *(RAE)* are common. Elevated pulmonary artery pressures will be reflected in the high-velocity tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity and mid-systolic notching in the pulmonary artery velocity curve. *PR,* Pulmonic regurgitant.

Acute pulmonary embolism also can affect right heart function because of the sudden onset of elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. Echocardiographic evaluation is helpful in assessing pulmonary artery pressures and RV function in patients with either chronic or acute pulmonary hypertension.

# Echocardiographic Approach

# *Pulmonary Pressures*

Standard approaches for the noninvasive evaluation of pulmonary pressures (PAP), as described in Chapter 6, are applicable to the patient with suspected or known pulmonary hypertension. The most reliable approach is to record the maximum tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (*V*TR) for calculation of the RV to RA systolic pressure difference [\(Fig. 9.35\)](#page--1-84). Care is needed to interrogate the tricuspid regurgitant jet from multiple acoustic windows (apical, parasternal) with a systematic approach to transducer angulation to obtain a parallel intercept angle between the ultrasound beam and jet. RA pressure (RAP) is estimated from the size and respiratory variation in the inferior vena cava. Then pulmonary artery systolic pressure (in the absence of pulmonic stenosis) is calculated as:

$$PAP = 4V^2_{TR} + RAP$$
 (Eq. 9.1)

Diastolic pulmonary artery pressure can be estimated from the velocities in the pulmonic regurgitant Doppler curve. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) can be estimated from the ratio of the tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity to the velocity time integral of RV outflow (VTIRVOT), multiplied by 10 for conversion to Wood units (see Chapter 6):

$$PVR(Wood units) = 10(V_{TR}/VTI_{RVOT})$$
 (Eq. 9.2)

Indirect signs of pulmonary hypertension often are seen that indicate the presence, but not the exact severity, of pulmonary hypertension. For example, an M-mode recording through the pulmonic valve shows a reduced *a*-wave and mid-systolic closure of the valve. This pattern has a reasonably high specificity (>90%) for detecting pulmonary hypertension but a low sensitivity (30% to 60%). This motion pattern is paralleled by the Doppler velocity curve, which shows an abrupt mid-systolic deceleration of flow [\(Fig. 9.36](#page--1-85)). Signs of RV pressure overload, including abnormal ventricular septal motion, also are valuable clues suggesting the presence of pulmonary hypertension.

# *Right Ventricular Pressure Overload*

The response of the RV to chronic pressure overload consists of hypertrophy and dilation [\(Fig. 9.37\)](#page--1-64). The increase in thickness of the RV free wall is best seen on the subcostal view. Ventricular septal motion is

![](_page_28_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 9.35 Primary pulmonary hypertension.** Tricuspid regurgitant jet in a patient with primary pulmonary hypertension. Using 2D and color-guided CW Doppler from the apex *(left)*, a clear signal is obtained, although signal strength is low, with a maximum jet of 4.6 m/s. The use of a dedicated CW probe *(right)* provides a stronger signal, and a higher jet velocity is obtained from a parasternal window. The maximum velocity of 4.9 m/s indicates an RV to RA pressure difference of 96 mmHg. RA pressure was elevated at 10 mmHg, so estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 106 mmHg. Note the faint linear spread of the signal at peak of the curve *(see third beat in right panel)*. This faint signal is due to the transit time effect and should not be included in the velocity measurement

![](_page_28_Figure_5.jpeg)

**Fig. 9.36 Pulmonary artery velocity curve in pulmonary hypertension.** The rapid acceleration (short time to peak velocity) and mid-systolic notching *(arrow)* are consistent with severe pulmonary hypertension.

abnormal or "paradoxical," with anterior motion of the septum during systole both on M-mode and 2D imaging. A rational explanation for this pattern of septal motion is based on the concept that the septum moves toward the center of mass of the heart during systole. With RV hypertrophy, the center of mass is shifted anteriorly, so the septum moves toward the center of the RV instead of the normal pattern of motion toward the center of the LV. On 2D imaging the curvature of the septum is reversed in both systole and in early to mid-diastole. In contrast, RV volume overload is characterized by diastolic flattening of the septum in late diastole with a normal curvature in systole, due to increased volume flow into the RV (compared with the LV) in diastole but normal ventricular pressures in systole (see Fig. 6.23).

With long-standing or acute pulmonary hypertension, RV systolic dysfunction can occur, with secondary dilation serving as a compensatory mechanism to maintain forward stroke volume. However, RV dilation leads to tricuspid regurgitation because of annular dilation and malalignment of the papillary muscles. This superimposed volume overload results in further RV dilation and more tricuspid regurgitation. RA dilation is due to both pressure (*v*-wave) and volume (tricuspid regurgitation) overload.

# *Secondary Tricuspid Regurgitation*

Tricuspid regurgitation secondary to pulmonary hypertension, RV systolic dysfunction, or both can be evaluated with color Doppler flow imaging from parasternal, apical, and subcostal views. Severe regurgitation results in systolic flow reversal in the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins. Evaluation of tricuspid valve anatomy is needed to ensure that other causes of tricuspid regurgitation (e.g., vegetation, rheumatic, carcinoid, Ebstein anomaly) are not present.

The intensity of the CW Doppler tricuspid regurgitant jet relates to the severity of regurgitation, but the velocity relates to the RV to RA pressure difference. With acute tricuspid regurgitation, a rapid falloff in velocity in late systole is seen, consistent with an RA *v*-wave.

# Limitations and Technical Considerations

The major limitation of echocardiography in the evaluation of cor pulmonale is poor ultrasound tissue penetration resulting in poor image quality and low Doppler signal strength. Hyperexpanded lungs obscure the

**Fig. 9.37 Cor pulmonale.** (A) Apical fourchamber view at end-diastole in a patient with chronic pulmonary disease and secondary pulmonary hypertension.

![](_page_29_Figure_4.jpeg)

standard acoustic windows in many patients with chronic lung disease. However, adequate image quality is obtained with current instruments in nearly all patients.

Assessment of the severity of pulmonary hypertension depends on obtaining a parallel intercept angle between the ultrasound beam and the tricuspid regurgitant jet. Underestimation of pulmonary artery pressures should be considered in all patients, especially when Doppler signal strength is suboptimal or when the Doppler data and clinical setting are discrepant. The absence of a recordable tricuspid regurgitant jet does not indicate normal pulmonary pressures. In this situation, the report indicates that the data are inadequate, and alternate diagnostic approaches should be considered. Overestimation of pulmonary pressures from the tricuspid regurgitant signal can be avoided by measuring the outer edge of the dark spectral envelope but avoiding the slight spectral broadening at peak velocity that results from the transit time effect.

# Clinical Utility

In the patient with chronic lung disease and right heart failure, echocardiography allows the confirmation of a clinical diagnosis of cor pulmonale, assessment of the degree of pulmonary hypertension, and evaluation of RV size and systolic dysfunction.

In patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, echocardiography is essential in excluding other causes of pulmonary hypertension, such as an atrial septal defect or mitral regurgitation. In addition, noninvasive measurement of pulmonary pressure now is routinely used for evaluating changes in pulmonary pressures with medical therapy.

In the patient with an acute pulmonary embolus, imaging rarely shows a residual thrombus originating from or in transit through (from a deep vein thrombosis) the right heart. TEE imaging can demonstrate thrombus in the main, right, or left pulmonary artery. However, the sensitivity of echocardiography for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism based on demonstrating a thrombus is low because the thrombus is lodged more distally in the pulmonary vasculature in most cases. In addition, adequate visualization of the pulmonary artery bifurcation is not possible in all patients because of interposition of the air-filled trachea and bronchi. Indirect signs of pulmonary embolism include:

- Elevated pulmonary artery pressures
- Evidence of acute RV pressure overload
- RV dilation and dysfunction
- Tricuspid regurgitation

Similar findings are seen in patients with chronic recurrent pulmonary emboli. The possibility of pulmonary embolism should be strongly considered in patients with these findings, even when a different working clinical diagnosis or "reason for echo" was entertained. Often patients in whom pulmonary embolism is subsequently diagnosed are initially referred for nonspecific indications including "chest pain," "dyspnea," or "heart failure."

# Alternate Approaches

Cardiac catheterization allows direct measurement of RV and pulmonary artery pressures and calculation of pulmonary vascular resistance. RV size and systolic function can be evaluated by angiography.

Clinically, the standard approach for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is computed tomographic pulmonary angiography. When that procedure is not available, a radionuclide ventricular perfusion scan is appropriate. Pulmonary angiography with injection of contrast material directly into the main pulmonary artery is only rarely needed when results of other tests are inconclusive.
