ongenital heart disease in adults has two basic categories:

- The initial clinical presentation of previously undiagnosed and untreated congenital defects
- Survival into adulthood of patients with known congenital heart disease and previous surgical procedures

In adult patients with no previous diagnosis of heart disease, a congenital defect often is not considered as a potential cause of symptoms, and thus the initial diagnosis may be made at the echocardiographic examination. In these patients, the diagnostic challenge is to recognize and correctly evaluate the congenital abnormality. In contrast, in patients with known congenital disease and previous surgical procedures, the goals are to identify the postoperative anatomy and assess the physiologic consequences of residual defects in each patient. With "corrective" surgery, as with "palliative" procedures, many patients have significant residual or progressive abnormalities.

Both these challenges can be met by a logical and methodical approach to the echocardiographic examination with the application of the basic principles of ultrasound imaging and Doppler data described throughout this text. In addition to careful integration of imaging and Doppler data, evaluation with other imaging modalities, such as cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging or computed tomography (CT), often is needed for complete assessment of congenital heart disease.

A comprehensive discussion of the echocardiographic findings in adult congenital heart disease is beyond the scope of this text. Instead, an overview of the echocardiographic approach to these patients and examples of the more common abnormalities are presented. The reader is referred to the specialized references listed at the end of the chapter for more detailed information. The goal of this chapter is to allow preliminary diagnosis of congenital heart disease; advanced training is recommended for definitive imaging and diagnosis of congenital heart disease.

### BASIC PRINCIPLES

Congenital heart diseases in adults include [\(Table 17.1](#page--1-44)):

- Stenotic lesions
- Abnormalities of the aorta and coronary arteries
- Regurgitant lesions
- Intracardiac shunts
- Abnormal connections
- Combinations or complex congenital disease

### Stenosis

Congenital stenotic lesions, including obstruction to right ventricular (RV) or left ventricular (LV) outflow (either subvalvular, valvular, or supravalvular), obstruction to LV inflow (congenital mitral stenosis, cor triatriatum), and narrowings in the great vessels (aortic coarctation, branch pulmonary artery [PA] stenosis), are common.

The anatomy of a congenital stenotic lesion differs from that seen in acquired valve disease, but the physiology and fluid dynamics are similar, with normal velocity flow upstream and a flow disturbance downstream from the narrowing. In the narrowed region itself, a high-velocity laminar jet of flow is present, with velocity (*V*, in m/s) related to the pressure difference (Δ*P*, in mmHg) across the narrowing, as stated in the simplified Bernoulli equation:

$$\Delta P = 4V^2 \tag{Eq. 17.1}$$

When a parallel intercept angle is obtained between the jet and the ultrasound beam, quantitative data on stenosis severity and intracardiac hemodynamics are reliable. For example, if the maximum velocity across a subpulmonic membrane is 4.5 m/s, then the maximum RV-to-PA systolic pressure difference is approximately 80 mmHg. Quantitative evaluation of stenosis severity for a congenitally stenotic lesion includes the calculation of maximum and mean pressure gradients as for acquired valve stenosis. Similarly, when possible, valve area calculations are performed using either the continuity equation (aortic valve) or the pressure half-time method (mitral valve).

Several significant differences between congenital and acquired stenosis should be noted. First, congenital stenosis of ventricular outflow, for both the RV and the LV, may involve the subvalvular or the supravalvular region rather than (or in addition to) stenosis of the valve itself [\(Fig. 17.1](#page--1-45)). Careful evaluation with conventional pulsed Doppler or color flow imaging to identify the poststenotic flow disturbance is helpful in determining the exact site of obstruction. Second, when serial stenoses are present, quantitation of the contribution of each level of obstruction to the overall degree of stenosis is difficult using Doppler echo methods. Third, the proximal flow pattern in congenital stenosis often is characterized by a greater increase in velocity because of anatomic tapering of the proximal flow region (e.g., in aortic coarctation or with congenital pulmonic stenosis). In these situations, accurate pressure gradient calculations should include the proximal velocity (*V*prox), as well as the maximum a jet velocity (*V*jet) in the Bernoulli equation:

$$\Delta P = 4(V_{\text{jet}}^2 - V_{\text{prox}}^2) \tag{Eq. 17.2}$$

Otherwise, the evaluation of congenital stenosis is similar to the evaluation of acquired stenosis in adults, and the methods described in detail in Chapter 11 are applied in this patient group.

### Regurgitation

Careful imaging of a congenitally regurgitant valve usually reveals the specific mechanism of regurgitation in that patient. For the atrioventricular valves, particular attention is focused on the number and position of papillary muscles; the chordal attachments (especially aberrant ones); leaflet size, shape, thickness, redundancy, and motion; and annulus size and shape. Malformations include myxomatous changes of the leaflets, abnormal leaflet position (Ebstein anomaly), and abnormal chordal attachments (atrioventricular canal defect) ([Fig. 17.2](#page--1-46)). The semilunar valves may be regurgitant because of great vessel dilation or leaflet fenestration. Three-dimensional (3D) imaging is helpful in the evaluation of leaflet anatomy and the mechanism of regurgitation.

The physiology of congenital regurgitation is no different from that of acquired regurgitation. A flow disturbance occurs in the chamber receiving the regurgitant flow with progressive dilation (and eventual dysfunction) of the volume-overloaded cardiac chambers. The evaluation of congenital regurgitation is similar to the evaluation of acquired regurgitation, as detailed in Chapter 12.

#### Shunts

An abnormal intracardiac communication is characterized by blood flow across the defect, with the direction, timing, and volume of flow determined by the size of the orifice, the pressure gradient across the defect, and the relative resistance to flow of the vascular beds on each side of the defect. If left-sided heart pressures exceed right-sided pressures (pulmonary vascular resistance is low), left-to-right flow across the defect predominates. In addition, small degrees of

**Fig. 17.3 Small, membranous ventricular septal defect.** In the parasternal long-axis view *(left),* color flow Doppler shows a systolic flow disturbance in the RV outflow tract from flow through the small ventricular septal defect *(VSD).* The short-axis view *(center)* demonstrates the exact site of the defect just on the LV side of the aortic valve in a position typical for a membranous VSD. CW Doppler *(center)* from the parasternal window demonstrates a high-velocity (5.5 m/s) signal toward the transducer (with some channel cross-talk) corresponding to the large difference in pressure between the LV and the RV in systole. Because LV diastolic pressure is slightly higher than RV diastolic pressure, low-velocity flow from left to right also is seen in diastole. *Ao,* Aorta.

right-to-left shunting are present briefly during the cardiac cycle because right-sided pressures transiently exceed left-sided pressures.

With conventional pulsed Doppler ultrasound or with color flow imaging, a flow disturbance is found downstream from the defect: on the right side of the interventricular septum for a ventricular septal defect (VSD), in the right atrium (RA) for an atrial septal defect (ASD), and in the PA for a patent ductus arteriosus.

Analogous to a stenotic or regurgitant orifice, the velocity of blood flow through the shunt orifice is related to the pressure gradient across the defect, as stated in the Bernoulli equation. Thus, a small VSD results in a high-velocity systolic flow signal (approximately 5 m/s) because LV systolic pressure greatly exceeds RV systolic pressure (by approximately 100 mmHg) [\(Fig. 17.3\)](#page--1-47). Conversely, flow across an ASD typically is low in velocity because only a modest left atrial (LA)–to–RA pressure difference is present.

A left-to-right intracardiac shunt imposes chronic volume overload on the receiving chamber(s) with consequent dilation of the affected chamber(s). With

<span id="page-5-0"></span>Fig. 17.4 Doppler shunt ratio calculation. Pulmonary flow  $(\Omega_{\rho})$  is calculated from transpulmonic stroke volume calculation using pulmonary artery (PA) diameter measured at the site of the Doppler sample position and the velocity-time integral (VTI) of PA flow. A circular cross-sectional area (CSA) is assumed. Similarly, systemic flow  $(\Omega_{s})$  is calculated from LV outflow tract (LVOT) diameter and the velocity-time integral of the LV outflow tract.

![](_page_5_Figure_3.jpeg)

an ASD, both RA and RV dilation, along with paradoxical septal motion, are seen. With a patent ductus arteriosus, the volume overload is imposed on the LA and LV. Although it could seem that a VSD would cause RV volume overload, in fact, RV size usually is normal because the LV effectively ejects the shunt flow directly into the PA via the septal defect in systole. Instead, LA and LV dilation is seen because these chambers receive the increased pulmonary blood flow as it returns to the left side of the heart via the pulmonary veins.

The volume of blood flow (Q) across an intracardiac shunt—the ratio of pulmonary to systemic blood flow (Q;Q)—is determined by Doppler echo measurements of stroke volume at two intracardiac sites (Fig. 17.4). In the case of an ASD, transpulmonic volume flow  $(Q_p)$  is calculated from the PA cross-sectional area (CSA) and velocity-time integral (VTI), whereas systemic volume flow  $(Q_p)$  is calculated from measurements of LV outflow tract (LVOT) cross-sectional area and velocity-time integral:

$$Q_{p} = CSA_{PA} \times VTI_{PA}$$
 (Eq. 17.3) 
$$Q_{s} = CSA_{LVOT} \times VTI_{LVOT}$$
 (Eq. 17.4)

so that:

$$Q_{p}: Q_{s} = \frac{\text{CSA}_{PA} \times \text{VTI}_{PA}}{\text{CSA}_{IVOT} \times \text{VTI}_{IVOT}}$$
(Eq. 17.5)

This approach is accurate when two-dimensional (2D) images are of adequate quality for precise diameter measurements (for calculation of a circular cross-sectional area) and when Doppler velocity data are recorded at a parallel intercept angle to flow. Potential errors in estimation of the  $Q_p$ :  $Q_s$  ratio are the same as for any Doppler echo stroke volume measurement (see Chapter 6).

#### **ECHO MATH:** Calculation of Shunt Ratio

#### Example

A 26-year-old woman undergoes echocardiography for symptoms of decreased exercise tolerance. She is found to have an enlarged RA and RV with paradoxical septal motion and the following Doppler data:

| RV outflow velocity                           | 1.8 m/s |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------|
| Velocity-time integral (VTI <sub>RVOT</sub> ) | 32 cm   |
| Diameter                                      | 2.6 cm  |
| LV outflow velocity                           | 1.1 m/s |
| Velocity-time integral (VTI <sub>LVOT</sub> ) | 16 cm   |
| Diameter                                      | 2.4 cm  |

The right heart enlargement suggests that an ASD may be present. The shunt ratio is calculated from the ratio of pulmonary flow  $(Q_b)$ , measured in the RV outflow tract (RVOT), and systemic flow  $(Q_c)$ , measured in the LV outflow tract (LVOT). At each site, cross-sectional area (CSA) is calculated as the area of a circle:

$$CSA_{RVOT} = \pi (D/2)^2 = 3.14(2.6/2)^2 = 5.3 \text{ cm}^2$$
  
 $CSA_{LVOT} = \pi (D/2)^2 = 3.14(2.4/2)^2 = 4.5 \text{ cm}^2$ 

Flow (stroke volume) at each site then is calculated:

$$Q_{p} = \text{CSA}_{\text{RVOT}} \times \text{VTI}_{\text{RVOT}} = 5.3 \text{ cm}^{2} \times 32 \text{ cm} = 170 \text{ cm}^{3}$$

$$Q_{s} = \text{CSA}_{\text{LVOT}} \times \text{VTI}_{\text{LVOT}} = 4.5 \text{ cm}^{2} \times 16 \text{ cm} = 72 \text{ cm}^{3}$$
so that

 $Q_{\rm p}/Q_{\rm s} = 170/72 = 2.4$ 

With significant left-to-right shunting, pulmonary pressures become elevated, and irreversible pulmonary hypertension develops over time. When pulmonary vascular resistance equals or exceeds systemic vascular resistance, the direction of shunt flow reverses, resulting in decreased systemic oxygen saturation and cyanosis. Irreversible pulmonary hypertension with equalization of pulmonary and systemic pressures due to an intracardiac shunt is known as *Eisenmenger physiology*. This can occur in infancy, particularly with a large VSD, but it also can occur later in life when the pulmonaryto-systemic shunt ratio chronically exceeds about 2:1.

### Connections

Echocardiographic diagnosis is more difficult when abnormal connections exist between the atrium and the ventricles, between the ventricles and great vessels, or both. In adults, poor acoustic access further compromises the examination; but with a systematic approach, a correct anatomic evaluation usually is possible.

Because the position of the heart in the chest often is abnormal, the echocardiographer cannot rely on the intrathoracic position of the chambers for correct identification of cardiac anatomy. *Dextroposition* is a rightward shift in the cardiac position with otherwise normal anatomy; for example, due to decreased right lung volume or severe scoliosis. Acoustic windows are shifted rightward, but image planes are similar to normal. With *dextroversion*, the cardiac apex points to the right, but the right and left heart chambers are otherwise normally related. Long-axis views are obtained with the image plane aligned from the left shoulder to the right hip, and the apical window is mid-line or right of the sternum. In contrast, with mirror image *dextrocardia*, cardiac anatomy is a mirror image of normal (the right-sided chambers are left of the left-sided chambers), and the heart is located in the right hemithorax with the apex in the right mid-clavicular line. Thus, acoustic windows are on the right chest with image planes mirror images of normal. The term *situs inversus* refers to right-to-left reversal of thoracic and abdominal viscera.

*Atrial situs* refers to the position of the RA and LA in the chest. The inferior vena cava nearly always drains into the RA, thereby allowing correct identification of this chamber by imaging the inferior vena cava from a subcostal approach and following it into the RA. Thus, the subcostal window often is a useful starting point for the examination of a patient with complex congenital heart disease. The LA, then, is the "other" atrial chamber because although the pulmonary veins normally drain into the LA, this is not always the case (e.g., partial or total anomalous pulmonary venous return).

The anatomic RV and LV are distinguished from each other by several features ([Fig. 17.5\)](#page--1-48). The anatomic RV has:

- Prominent trabeculation
- A moderator band
- An infundibular region
- A more apical atrioventricular annulus than the LV
- A tricuspid valve

Fibrous continuity of the anterior mitral valve leaflet and the aortic valve occurs only with a normally related LV and aortic root. When the anatomic RV connects to the aortic root, a band of myocardium is seen between the base of the atrioventricular valve leaflet and the great vessel. When abnormal connections of the anatomic ventricles are present, the ventricle pumping blood to the pulmonary bed is called the *subpulmonic ventricle* and the ventricle pumping blood into the aorta is called the *systemic ventricle.*

The atrioventricular valves develop with the appropriate anatomic ventricle, so identification of the mitral valve is another feature that differentiates the LV from the RV. Caution is needed if a cleft anterior mitral valve leaflet is present because it may superficially resemble the tricuspid valve. In addition to the number of atrioventricular valve leaflets, the relative positions of the atrioventricular valve annuli are helpful because the tricuspid valve annulus lies slightly closer to the apex than the mitral valve annulus. Note that ventricular size, shape, and/or wall thickness do not distinguish the two ventricles because congenital lesions can result in dilation and hypertrophy of either chamber.

After identifying the atrium and ventricles, attention is directed toward the great vessels. The aortic root is best identified by following the vessel downstream to image the arch and head and neck vessels. Visualization of the origins of the coronary arteries is helpful, but anomalous origin of the coronary arteries from the PA must be considered. The PA is identified by its bifurcation into right and left branches.

The position of the great vessels within the thorax and relative to one another often is altered in congenital disease. Normally, the PA lies anterior and slightly medial to the aortic root at its origin and then courses posteriorly and laterally, with the right PA lying posterior to the ascending aorta. The aortic annulus normally lies posterior to the RV outflow tract, with the aortic root extending medially and anteriorly before turning posterolaterally to form the aortic arch. The normal relationship of the aortic and pulmonic valve planes is approximately perpendicular to each other, with the pulmonary valve slightly more superior within the chest than the aortic valve. With transpositions of the great vessels, these relationships are altered, so the semilunar valves lie in the same tomographic plane, and the aorta and the PA lie parallel to each other instead of in their normal "crisscross" positions. If the aorta is anterior and to the left, *L* (for levo) transposition is present. An anterior and medial (rightward) aorta is termed *D* (for dextro) transposition.

**Fig. 17.5 Transposition of the great arteries.** CMR images demonstrate the anatomic relationships of the great arteries and ventricles. (A) The longitudinal view shows the side-by-side orientation of the great arteries and the systemic ventricle *(SV)* and pulmonary ventricle *(PV).* The aorta *(Ao)* is anterior to the pulmonary artery *(PA).* (B) In a four-chamber view, the systemic ventricle is an anatomic RV, as demonstrated by the presence of a moderator band, prominent trabeculation, and the slightly more apical insertion of the tricuspid valve *(TV)* compared with the mitral valve *(MV).* The systemic ventricle is appropriately hypertrophied. The pulmonary ventricle is an anatomic LV.

Most patients with abnormal connections between the cardiac chambers and great vessels have associated abnormalities that require echocardiographic evaluation. These include intracardiac shunts, stenotic and regurgitant lesions, pulmonary hypertension, and ventricular dysfunction. The echocardiographic examination in these patients is facilitated by:

- Knowledge of the patient's clinical history, including previous surgical procedures and diagnostic tests
- Formulation of specific clinical questions to be answered by the echocardiographic examination

During the examination, the physician and the sonographer work together to identify:

- Cardiac chambers, great vessels, and their connections
- Associated defects
- Physiologic consequences of each lesion
- Clinical questions that remain unanswered at the end of examination

In addition, the echocardiographer should suggest other appropriate imaging modalities to address any areas of uncertainty.

### CONGENITAL STENOTIC LESIONS

### Congenital Aortic Valve Stenosis

Although a congenital bicuspid aortic valve is the most common type of congenital heart disease (reported to occur in 1% to 2% of the general population), the bicuspid valve often is functionally normal until about age 50 years or later, when superimposed fibrocalcific changes lead to aortic valve stenosis. Significant regurgitation of a congenital bicuspid valve occurs somewhat less commonly but manifests in young adulthood with a diastolic murmur and symptoms of exercise intolerance.

The presentation of significant LV outflow obstruction in a young adult should prompt consideration of abnormalities other than a bicuspid valve, specifically a unicuspid aortic valve, a subaortic membrane, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A unicuspid aortic valve appears as a thickened, deformed valve with systolic bowing of the valve on ultrasound imaging. A high parasternal short-axis view shows the eccentric unicuspid opening in systole. 3D transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) further defines valve anatomy. Doppler echocardiography allows measurement of the transvalvular gradient and valve area as for any type of aortic valve stenosis. Restenosis of the aortic valve in patients who previously underwent surgical valvotomy in childhood or adolescence is common. Restenosis occurs in up to 40% of patients a mean of 13 years after open surgical valvotomy.

#### Subaortic Stenosis

Congenital subaortic obstruction ranges anatomically from a muscular ridge to a thin membrane. Although typically located 1 to 1.5 cm apically from the aortic valve plane, the membrane sometimes is located immediately adjacent to the aortic valve. In either case, a subaortic membrane is difficult to see in adults because of poor acoustic access. The possibility of a subaortic membrane should be considered when high-velocity flow is recorded in the LV outflow tract, but the aortic valve leaflets appear normal. TEE allows direct imaging of the subaortic membrane, especially if multiple image planes or 3D images are used to identify this thin structure. Conventional pulsed Doppler, high-pulse repetition frequency Doppler, and color flow imaging are helpful from either TTE or TEE approaches in demonstrating that, in contrast to valvular aortic stenosis, the increase in antegrade velocity and poststenotic flow disturbance occurs on the LV side of the aortic valve and indicates that subaortic obstruction is present. Coexisting aortic regurgitation occurs because of chronic exposure of the aortic valve leaflets to the high-velocity subaortic flow, resulting in a "jet lesion" on the aortic valve, or (rarely) because of fibrous attachments from the subaortic membrane to the aortic valve leaflets.

### Congenital Obstructions to Right Ventricular Outflow

The level of RV outflow obstruction ranges from subvalvular (in the muscular outflow tract), valvular to supravalvular (either in the main PA or its major branches). Pulmonic stenosis sometimes occurs as an isolated anomaly but more often is part of a complex of defects (e.g., tetralogy of Fallot) or is associated with other abnormalities (e.g., corrected transposition). The level of outflow obstruction is determined using pulsed Doppler and color flow to identify the anatomic site at which the flow velocity increases and the poststenotic flow disturbance appears. The obstruction itself is seen on 2D or 3D imaging as a muscular subpulmonic ridge; as deformed, doming pulmonic valve leaflets; or as a narrowing in the PA. If significant obstruction is present, compensatory RV hypertrophy typically is seen.

The degree of obstruction is measured by Doppler ultrasound by using the Bernoulli equation (Fig. 17.6), with the proviso that only an estimate of the total obstruction is possible if serial stenoses are present. Note that in the presence of pulmonic stenosis, the tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity remains an accurate reflection of the RV to RA systolic pressure difference but no longer indicates PA systolic pressure. Instead, PA systolic pressure (PAP) is estimated by calculating the:

(1) RV systolic pressure (RVSP) based on the tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity ( $V_{\rm TR}$ ) and RA pressure (RAP) estimated from the inferior vena cava size and respiratory variation:

$$RSVP = 4V_{TR}^2 + RAP$$
 (Eq. 17.6)

(2) RV-to-PA gradient ( $\Delta P_{\text{RV-PA}}$ ) from the pulmonic stenosis jet velocity ( $V_{\text{PS}}$ ):

$$\Delta P_{\rm RV-PA} = 4 V_{\rm PS}^2 \qquad (Eq. 17.7)$$

(3) PA systolic pressure (PAP) by subtracting the transpulmonic gradient from the estimated RV systolic pressure:

$$PAP = (\Delta P_{RV-RA} + P_{RA}) - \Delta P_{RV-PA} \qquad (Eq. 17.8)$$

The end-diastolic velocity in the pulmonic regurgitation jet also provides useful data on PA pressures because it reflects the diastolic pressure difference between the PA and the RV (high in patients with pulmonary hypertension, low in patients with pulmonic stenosis, and normal PA diastolic pressures).

## **ECHO MATH:** Calculation of Pulmonary Pressures With Pulmonic Valve Disease

#### Example

A 24-year-old with a history of a cardiac murmur has an echocardiogram which shows:

RV outflow velocity
PA velocity
3.1 m/s
Tricuspid regurgitant jet
Estimated RA pressure
5 mmHg (small inferior vena cava with normal respiratory variation)

Because the RV outflow velocity is elevated, the maximum pulmonic valve gradient should be calculated using the proximal velocity  $(V^2_{\ prox})$  in the Bernoulli equation:

$$\Delta P = 4(V_{jet}^2 - V_{prox}^2)$$

$$\Delta P = 4[(3.1)^2 - (1.6)^2] = 4[9.6 - 2.6] = 28 \text{ mmHg}$$

If the proximal velocity is not included, the gradient would be overestimated at 38 mmHg.

Estimated pulmonary systolic pressure (PAP) is calculated by subtracting the pulmonic valve gradient from the estimated RV pressure because pulmonic stenosis is present:

$$PAP = (\Delta P_{RV-RA} + P_{RA}) - \Delta P_{RV-PA}$$
$$PAP = (4V^{2}_{TR} + P_{RA}) - \Delta P_{RV-PA}$$
$$= [4 (3.4)^{2} + 5] - 28 = 23 \text{ mmHg}$$

Thus, estimated PA systolic pressure is normal even though the tricuspid regurgitant jet indicates an RV systolic pressure of 51 mmHg.

**Fig. 17.6 Subpulmonic stenosis.** In an anteriorly angulated four-chamber view *(top),* color Doppler shows an increase in velocity proximal to the pulmonic valve in this patient with complete transposition. CW Doppler *(bottom)* demonstrates a velocity of 3.4 m/s and a diastolic signal consistent with moderate to severe pulmonic regurgitation. *PA,* Pulmonary artery; *PS,* pulmonic stenosis; *PV,* pulmonary ventricle.

### CONGENITAL ABNORMALITIES OF THE AORTA AND CORONARY ARTERIES

#### Aortic Coarctation

A congenital narrowing in the proximal descending thoracic aorta most often is located just upstream from the entry site of the ductus arteriosus. Less often, postductal coarctation is seen. The coarctation usually is relatively discreet, with involvement of only a short segment of the aorta, but sometimes is a long, tubular narrowing. Imaging the coarctation site is difficult from a TTE suprasternal notch window in adults. Even in normal individuals, the descending thoracic aorta appears to taper because the tomographic view cuts the aorta obliquely as it leaves the image plane. Restenosis manifests at variable ages in adults with previous surgical coarctation repair, depending on the specific surgical procedure and the patient's age at the time of repair. For both operated and unoperated coarctations, TEE imaging with a long-axis view of the descending aorta can be helpful, although CT and CMR imaging now are the standard clinical approaches.

Doppler examination shows an increased velocity across the coarctation and, if the obstruction is severe, persistent antegrade flow into diastole ([Fig.](#page--1-50) [17.7\)](#page--1-50) sometimes called *diastolic run-off.* If the velocity proximal to the coarctation is elevated, the proximal velocity should be included in the Bernoulli equation for pressure gradient estimation. The jet direction in an unoperated coarctation is very eccentric, so it rarely is possible to achieve a parallel alignment between the ultrasound beam and the jet direction, a situation that leads to underestimation of the severity of the obstruction. In restenosis of a previously operated coarctation, the jet orientation tends to be more symmetric, and a parallel intercept angle with correct estimation of the pressure gradient is more likely. In either case, other clinical methods for assessing the severity of the coarctation are available (e.g., upper versus lower extremity blood pressure).

#### Sinus of Valsalva Aneurysm

A congenital aneurysm of the aortic sinuses of Valsalva appears as a thin, dilated area that projects into adjacent cardiac structures, often with a fistulous communication, depending on which sinus is involved. On echocardiographic imaging, a congenital aneurysm often has a "wind sock" appearance with a long, convoluted, mobile sac of tissue extending from the

![](_page_10_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 17.7 Aortic coarctation.** From a suprasternal notch *(SSN)* window, CW Doppler of the coarctation shows an increased velocity in systole, with persistent antegrade flow into diastole. Imaging of the coarctation often is suboptimal in adults. *Ao,* Aorta.

aortic sinus into adjacent cardiac structures (see Fig. 16.3). This appearance contrasts with the more symmetric dilation seen in aneurysms due to endocarditis. An aneurysm of the noncoronary sinus projects into the RA, the left coronary cusp into the LA, and the right coronary cusp into the RV outflow tract. If a fistula is present, pulsed and color Doppler flow images demonstrate a left-to-right shunt with a flow disturbance in the receiving chamber. Continuous-wave (CW) Doppler shows a high-velocity systolic and diastolic flow signal.

### Coronary Arteriovenous Fistula

A coronary arteriovenous fistula is a rare congenital anomaly that manifests in young adults as a continuous murmur. The abnormal communication typically arises from a coronary artery and empties into the coronary sinus or RA. A coronary arteriovenous fistula is recognized echocardiographically as an abnormal area of dilation with diastolic or continuous flow in addition to a flow disturbance at the site of entry into the cardiac chamber [\(Fig. 17.8\)](#page--1-49).

### Anomalous Origins of the Coronary Arteries

Other coronary artery abnormalities diagnosed on echocardiography, particularly when TTE or TEE images are of high quality, include an anomalous circumflex coronary artery arising from the right sinus of Valsalva, an anomalous right coronary artery arising from the left sinus of Valsalva, or the left main coronary arising from the right sinus of Valsalva.

An anomalous coronary artery arising from the PA only occasionally is diagnosed initially in adulthood because the resulting myocardial ischemia usually leads to significant clinical manifestations at a younger age. With an anomalous left coronary (ALCAPA) or right coronary artery arising from the pulmonary artery (ARCAPA), the flow direction from the aorta is antegrade in the coronary artery that comes off the aorta and then retrograde in the anomalous coronary artery, which then drains into the pulmonary artery. Thus, these rare lesions are diagnosed on echocardiography based on a diastolic flow disturbance in the main pulmonary artery.

### CONGENITAL REGURGITANT LESIONS

### Ebstein Anomaly of the Tricuspid Valve

Ebstein anomaly is characterized by adherence of the basal segments of one (most often the septal) or more of the leaflets of the tricuspid valve to the RV endocardium that results in the appearance of apical displacement of the tricuspid valve attachment ([Fig.](#page--1-51) [17.9\)](#page--1-51). In Ebstein anomaly, the distance between the tricuspid and mitral annulus exceeds the normal 10-mm difference. In severe cases, the tricuspid valve is displaced nearly to the RV apex. In addition, the tricuspid valve leaflets are thickened and malformed. Functionally, tricuspid regurgitation nearly always is present, ranging from mild to severe. Typically, no antegrade obstruction to RV diastolic filling is present [\(Fig. 17.10](#page--1-52)).

Owing to the apical displacement of the tricuspid leaflet insertion, a portion of the anatomic RV physiologically serves as part of the RA. This "atrialized" ventricle adds to the appearance of RA enlargement, which is augmented by chronic atrial volume overload from tricuspid regurgitation. Ebstein anomaly occurs as an isolated anatomic defect or in association with an aberrant atrioventricular conduction bypass tract (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome), an ASD, or other congenital anomalies (e.g., ventricular inversion). Ebstein anomaly of the anatomic tricuspid valve in a patient with corrected transposition results in systemic atrioventricular valve regurgitation and chronic volume overload of the systemic ventricle.

**Fig. 17.8 Coronary arteriovenous fistula.** In this 24-year-old woman with a continuous murmur, the 2D long-axis view *(upper left)* shows a large, echo-free space in the region of the coronary sinus *(arrow)*. Color Doppler *(upper right)* shows a swirling flow pattern from the aorta into this space. In combination with other image planes, this finding was consistent with a right coronary–to–coronary sinus atrioventricular fistula. Pulsed Doppler recordings *(bottom)* confirmed low-velocity flow, predominantly in diastole *(arrow)* but extending into systole, consistent with a coronary fistula. *Ao,* Aorta.

![](_page_11_Figure_4.jpeg)

### Cleft Mitral Valve

Congenital abnormalities of the mitral valve include congenital mitral stenosis due to a parachute mitral valve (one papillary muscle), a double orifice mitral valve, a supramitral ring, or other abnormalities of the leaflets or papillary muscles. The lesion most often diagnosed in adults is a cleft anterior mitral valve leaflet, frequently in association with an atrioventricular canal defect or primum ASD but sometimes as an isolated finding resulting in mitral regurgitation. The cleft in the anterior leaflet is seen best in the parasternal short-axis view, whereas lateral-to-medial angulation in the long-axis image plane shows the differing patterns of motion of the medial and lateral leaflet segments (see [Fig. 17.2](#page--1-46)). A cleft mitral valve with adequate systolic apposition of leaflet segments is functionally normal but more often results in significant mitral regurgitation due to inadequate leaflet closure. In adults with myxomatous mitral valve disease, 3D imaging often demonstrates deep clefts in either the anterior or posterior mitral leaflet, but this phenotype is distinct from a congenital cleft anterior mitral valve leaflet.

#### INTRACARDIAC SHUNTS

### Atrial Septal Defects *Anatomy*

Three basic anatomic types of ASDs are recognized [\(Fig. 17.11](#page--1-53)). The most common is a secundum defect, in which the central section of the atrial septum (the fossa ovalis) is absent because of failure of the secundum atrial septum to cover the foramen secundum during development. A secundum ASD typically is an ovale defect in the center of the septum with a diameter of 1 to 2 cm.

A primum ASD is the absence of the section of the interatrial septum adjacent to the central fibrous body. Developmentally, abnormal formation of the septum primum occurs with failure of closure of the foramen primum, which often is associated with abnormalities of the atrioventricular valves, especially a cleft anterior mitral leaflet. In a more severe developmental abnormality—called an *atrioventricular*  *canal* or *endocardial cushion defect*—the entire central fibrous body is absent, resulting in a primum ASD, a VSD, and abnormalities of the atrioventricular valves [\(Figs. 17.12](#page--1-54) and [17.13](#page--1-55)).

The third type of ASD is the sinus venosus defect. This abnormal communication between the RA and the LA is developmentally related to abnormal fusion between the embryologic sinus venosus and the atrium and thus is located near the junction of the atrium with either the superior or inferior vena cava. Partial

**Fig. 17.13 Example of atrioventricular canal defect.** Ostium primum atrial septal defect (ASD) with an accompanying ventricular septal defect (VSD)—also called an atrioventricular canal—in a young woman with Down syndrome. This apical four-chamber view in systole shows the ASD, VSD, and common atrioventricular valve. RV and LV pressures are equal in systole, and pressure in all four chambers is equal in diastole. These findings are consistent with Eisenmenger physiology unless severe pulmonic stenosis is present.

anomalous pulmonary venous return often is associated with a sinus venosus defect but also occurs as an isolated defect, which often is not diagnosed until adulthood. Anomalous pulmonary veins drain directly into the RA or into the superior or inferior vena cava.

#### *Transthoracic Imaging*

TTE has a sensitivity of 89% for the detection of a secundum ASD and 100% for a primum defect, but only 44% for a sinus venosus defect. TTE imaging of an ASD is most reliable from a subcostal approach so that the ultrasound beam is perpendicular to the plane of the interatrial septum. From apical or parasternal windows, apparent loss of signal from the atrial septum is due to a parallel alignment between the ultrasound beam and the structures of interest (i.e., no ultrasound is reflected back to the transducer). Secundum ASDs are seen in the central portion of the atrial septum [\(Fig. 17.14\)](#page--1-56), and primum defects are seen adjacent to the annuli of the atrioventricular valves. TTE imaging of a sinus venosus defect is challenging, so this diagnosis should be considered in patients with unexplained right heart enlargement or paradoxical septal motion.

If an ASD is associated with a significant left-toright shunt, RA enlargement, RV enlargement, and paradoxical septal motion consistent with right-sided volume overload [\(Fig. 17.15](#page--1-57)) are uniformly present. In fact, evidence for right-sided heart volume overload often is the first abnormality noted during the echocardiographic examination. Shunt flow is quantitated by measuring stroke volume in the PA (pulmonary blood flow) and in the LV outflow tract (systemic blood flow) [\(Fig. 17.16](#page--1-49)).

The subcostal window is optimal for color imaging of flow across the ASD, because the direction of flow is parallel to the ultrasound beam. Color flow imaging from other windows (including parasternal and apical) also is helpful because it is the location and timing of the flow disturbance—rather than the absolute velocity of flow—that are diagnostic of the defect in the atrial septum. Color flow imaging shows a broad flowstream from LA to RA in both diastole and systole, with a more prominent diastolic component. With large shunts, the flow across the atrial septum extends across the open tricuspid valve into the RV in diastole. Proximal flow acceleration on the LA side of the septum usually is evident.

However, in some cases, the diastolic-systolic lowvelocity flow signal across the ASD is difficult to distinguish from other venous flow signals in the RA. Care must be taken to avoid mistaking superior vena cava flow into the RA, which often streams along the interatrial septum, for ASD flow. This appearance can be particularly misleading in high-volume flow states, such as pregnancy. Occasionally, a tricuspid

regurgitant jet directed along the interatrial septum also results in a confusing flow pattern.

#### *Contrast Echocardiography*

In a patient with a primum or secundum ASD, peripheral venous injection of agitated saline shows passage of microbubbles across the interatrial septum, even when the shunt is predominantly left to right in direction. The explanation for this observation is that RA pressure transiently and briefly exceeds LA pressure, thus allowing passage of a small volume of blood (and microbubbles) from right to left across the atrial septum. Dense contrast in the RA also allows demonstration of a "negative" contrast jet across the ASD; that is, the blood flow from the LA into the RA appears as an area with no echo contrast.

Contrast echo studies are rarely needed for the diagnosis of an ASD when typical imaging, Doppler, and color flow imaging findings are present. The principle of using echo contrast to identify very small degrees of right-to-left shunting also is used to detect a patent foramen ovale as a potential source of a systemic embolic event (see Chapter 15).

**Fig. 17.16 Calculation of the shunt ratio in a patient with an atrial septal defect.** Systemic flow (*Q*s) is calculated from the LV outflow tract *(LVOT)* diameter (2.2 cm) and Doppler velocitytime integral (*VTI;* 15 cm) *(top)*, whereas pulmonary blood flow is calculated from the pulmonary artery *(PA)* diameter (2.3 cm) and Doppler velocity-time integral (21 cm) *(bottom)*. In this example, *Q*p is 87, and *Q*s is 57 mL, so *Q*p:*Q*s is only 1.5, a value of borderline significance.

![](_page_15_Figure_4.jpeg)

### *Transesophageal Imaging*

TEE is recommended for preprocedural evaluation of adults with an ASD, guidance of transcatheter closure of the defect, and intraoperative assessment in patients undergoing surgical repair. In addition, when evidence for right-sided volume overload is present in the absence of a visualized ASD or other definable cause for volume overload (e.g., tricuspid regurgitation), TEE imaging should be performed to evaluate for the possibility of a sinus venosus defect or partial anomalous pulmonary venous return [\(Fig. 17.17](#page--1-58)).

The TEE approach [\(Fig. 17.18\)](#page--1-59) to the evaluation of an ASD is:

- Center the atrial septum in a four-chamber view to show the fossa ovalis region.
- Rotate the TEE image plane in 20° to 30° increments from 0° to 90° to examine the entire surface of the atrial septum and the size of the rim available for anchoring a transcatheter closure device.
- Be sure to include the entry of the superior and inferior vena cavae into the RA in the views of the atrial septum to avoid missing a sinus venosus defect.
- Acquire real-time and full-volume 3D images of the atrial septum to provide better assessment of the size and shape of the defect [\(Fig. 17.19](#page--1-60)).
- Use color Doppler to visualize flow across the defect, either simultaneously with or subsequent to imaging.

■ Identify the entry of all four pulmonary veins into the atrium and document expected flow patterns in each vein with color and pulsed Doppler modalities.

TEE imaging also is useful for the guidance of transcatheter closure of the ASD [\(Fig. 17.20\)](#page--1-61).

### Ventricular Septal Defects

#### *Anatomy*

Four anatomically different types of VSDs are recognized [\(Fig. 17.21](#page--1-62)). The most common type is a *perimembranous VSD* located in the region of the membranous septum immediately inferomedial to the aortic valve and lateral to the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve. Small membranous VSDs often close spontaneously during childhood by approximation of the tricuspid valve septal leaflet across the defect. A completely closed defect usually is undetectable in adulthood, but a residual anatomic abnormality—a ventricular septal aneurysm—sometimes is visualized at the closure site without evidence of blood flow from the LV to the RV. Incomplete closure leads to a persistent, albeit smaller, VSD, which is difficult to distinguish from a septal aneurysm on 2D imaging. However, color flow and CW Doppler images show typical evidence for an abnormal flow communication between the LV and the RV, even when the defect is small.

*Muscular VSDs* occur at any location in the muscular portion of the septum and often are multiple. When they are small, imaging the defect is not possible with a tomographic imaging technique (e.g.,

**Fig. 17.17 Sinus venosus atrial septal defect.** Patient with a superior sinus venosus atrial septal defect, persistent left superior vena cava (SVC) to the coronary sinus *(CS),* and partial anomalous pulmonary venous return of the right upper pulmonary vein.

echocardiography), even when multiple image planes are examined. Again, Doppler data are diagnostic in this situation.

*Inlet VSDs* are the result of failure of complete formation of the central fibrous body. This defect is located inferior to the aortic valve plane, adjacent to the mitral and tricuspid valve annuli. Inlet defects often are associated with other anomalies of the central fibrous body such as a primum ASD, atrioventricular valve abnormalities, or a complete atrioventricular canal defect.

*Supracristal VSDs* are located in the RV outflow portion of the septum (above the crista ventricularis), lateral and just inferior to the aortic valve. These defects are rarely initially diagnosed in adulthood.

#### *Imaging*

Large defects are visualized easily with 2D echocardiography, but small defects are difficult to demonstrate. Perimembranous VSDs are imaged best in a parasternal long-axis view angulated slightly medially (see [Fig. 17.3\)](#page--1-47). In the short-axis view just below the aortic valve level, the VSD is seen in a 10 o'clock position inferior to the right coronary cusp of the aortic valve and adjacent to the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve. In this view, a supracristal VSD is located at the 2 o'clock position, inferior to the left coronary leaflet of the aortic valve and adjacent to the pulmonic valve. A supracristal VSD is imaged in the long-axis plane by lateral angulation of the transducer from the standard long-axis view. Muscular VSDs are best seen in sequential basal-to-apical short-axis views of the LV, in the apical four-chamber view, or using 3D imaging with a view of the entire septal surface. Inlet VSDs are best imaged in the apical four-chamber view or from the parasternal window in a short-axis view at the mitral valve level.

Most VSDs seen in adults are associated with a very small flow volume, so chamber sizes and

![](_page_18_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 17.21 Ventricular septal defect anatomy.** A membranous ventricular septal defect *(VSD)* is seen in a medially angulated parasternal long-axis view, immediately adjacent to the aortic valve. A supracristal VSD is seen well in a short-axis view just below the aortic valve with flow from the LV outflow tract *(LVOT)* into the outflow region of the RV. A muscular VSD can be located anywhere in the muscular portion of the ventricular septum and may be multiple. An inlet VSD is seen in the apical four-chamber view, often associated with an atrioventricular canal defect. *Ao,* Aorta; *RVOT,* RV outflow tract.

ventricular function are normal. When a significant volume of left-to-right flow is present across a VSD, dilation of the LV and LA occurs because of volume overload of these chambers. RV size usually is normal because the systolic flow across the defect is ejected directly into the PA, and LV systolic function typically is preserved because the shunt flow is ejected into the low-impedance pulmonary vascular bed. With large shunts, pulmonary vascular hypertension supervenes, resulting in Eisenmenger physiology with RV hypertrophy and dilation ([Fig. 17.22\)](#page--1-63).

#### *Doppler Findings*

Color Doppler flow imaging shows a flow disturbance on the right side of the ventricular septum (with a left-to-right shunt). The presence and location of this flow disturbance are diagnostic for a VSD, even in the absence of a demonstrable defect on imaging. The flow disturbance is detectable in the defect itself, with proximal acceleration on the left side of the septum, immediately adjacent to the defect. Doppler ultrasound has a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 98% for the detection of a VSD.

CW Doppler ultrasound shows a high-velocity left-to-right signal, with the shape of the velocity curve similar to that of mitral regurgitation, as determined by the instantaneous LV-to-RV pressure differences (see Fig. 14.16). In diastole, left-to-right shunting persists at a lower velocity (proportional to the diastolic LV-to-RV pressure differences), with the shape of the time-velocity curve similar to that of mitral stenosis. Brief reversal of flow may be, but is not always, present during isovolumic relaxation and contraction phases. Both the diastolic flow and brief reversals during the isovolumic periods are low velocity and thus are not appreciated except at low high-pass filter settings on the Doppler spectral recording. Because this reversal of flow does not always occur, intravenous injection of echo-contrast material is less sensitive for the detection of an intracardiac shunt at the ventricular level than at the atrial level.

Calculation of a pulmonic-to-systemic shunt ratio rarely is needed in adults with VSDs because either (1) the defect is small with a small volume of left-toright shunt, or (2) a large defect with a significant shunt in childhood now has resulted in Eisenmenger physiology with equalization of RV and LV pressures. If calculation of a shunt ratio is needed, systemic flow is calculated in the aorta, and pulmonary flow is calculated either in the PA (if not disturbed by the septal defect flow) or across the mitral valve (pulmonary venous return).

#### Patent Ductus Arteriosus

A patent ductus arteriosus often is difficult to image in adults because of limited acoustic access. However, the chronic volume overload of the LA and LV is manifested as dilation of these chambers. Left-to-right flow through the ductus is detectable with either conventional pulsed or color Doppler flow imaging using both parasternal short-axis and RV outflow views of the PA ([Figs. 17.23](#page--1-64) and [17.24\)](#page--1-65). Diastolic ductal flow in the PA, typically seen along the lateral wall of this vessel, has a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 100% for the diagnosis of a patent ductus arteriosus. Recording of flow in the descending aorta, from a suprasternal notch approach, shows holodiastolic flow reversal due to antegrade flow into the ductus in diastole. This finding must be distinguished from diastolic flow reversal due to aortic regurgitation because the two conditions sometimes coexist in adult patients.

### OTHER CONDITIONS MANIFESTING IN ADULTHOOD

### Corrected Transposition of the Great Arteries

Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries is variously termed and abbreviated cc-TGA

**Fig. 17.23 Patent ductus arteriosus.** Flow *(arrow)* from the descending aorta *(DA)* into the pulmonary artery *(PA)* often streams along the lateral wall of the PA on color flow imaging. Pulsed or CW Doppler shows holodiastolic flow reversal in the PA. Systolic flow typically is also abnormal, because aortic pressure exceeds PA pressure throughout the cardiac cycle (giving rise to a continuous murmur on auscultation). *RVOT,* RV outflow tract.

**Fig. 17.25 Transposition of the great arteries.** Basic anatomy of a normal heart, a heart with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (cc-TGA), and a heart with complete transposition of the great arteries (d-TGA). In patients with cc-TGA, systemic venous blood returns to the RA, passes across the mitral valve into an anatomic LV (the pulmonary ventricle), and is ejected into the pulmonary artery *(PA).* Pulmonary venous return into the LA is directed across the tricuspid valve into an anatomic RV (the systemic ventricle) and from there into the aorta *(Ao).* Common associated abnormalities are an Ebstein-type malformation of the tricuspid valve resulting in systemic atrioventricular valve regurgitation, pulmonic stenosis, ventricular septal defect(VSD), and complete heart block. The aorta is anterior on the patient's left side, and the aorta and the PA are parallel to each other. With d-TGA, the aorta arises from the RV, and the PA arises from the LV. Before corrective surgery, delivery of oxygenated blood to the systemic circulation depends on intracardiac shunting via an atrial septal defect (ASD) or a VSD.

("congenitally corrected"); l-TGA (because the aorta is to the left of the transposed PA); or ventricular inversion, because the anatomic RV serves as the systemic ventricle, and the anatomic LV serves as the pulmonic ventricle. With corrected transposition, the physiologic pathway of oxygenated and unoxygenated blood flow through the heart is normal: systemic venous blood returns to the RA, crosses the mitral valve into an anatomic LV, and then is ejected into the PA; pulmonary venous return to the LA crosses the tricuspid valve into an anatomic RV and then is ejected into the aorta ([Fig. 17.25](#page--1-66)). In the absence of associated defects, the diagnosis often is made "incidentally" in adulthood [\(Fig. 17.26\)](#page--1-49). However, associated defects, including VSDs, pulmonic stenosis, complete heart block, and Ebstein anomaly of the "inverted" tricuspid valve, are common. Dilation and eventual systolic dysfunction of the systemic ventricle are common, although it is unclear whether this is due to the anatomy of the RV being less suited to performing as the systemic ventricle, to inadequate coronary blood flow via the right coronary artery, or to associated systemic atrioventricular valve regurgitation.

On echocardiographic examination, corrected transposition is recognized by identifying the anatomic ventricles in a side-by-side orientation and demonstrating the pathway of blood flow. Associated defects have 2D echo and Doppler findings as described for each abnormality. In addition, the position of the great vessels is abnormal, with the two semilunar valves lying in the same image plane—best seen in parasternal short-axis views—and with the great vessels parallel to one another—best seen in parasternal long-axis views. Typically, the aortic annulus is anterior and to the left of the pulmonic valve (hence the "l" in l-TGA). Corrected transposition also is associated with dextroversion (apex points toward the right), which makes the echocardiographic examination technically more difficult because the cardiac structures lie directly behind the sternum, limiting acoustic access.

### "Incidental" Congenital Anomalies

A few congenital anomalies have no known adverse clinical effects but are important in that, if not recognized, they may be mistaken for pathologic conditions and prompt other (possibly harmful) diagnostic tests. A persistent left superior vena cava is seen in a small percentage (0.3% to 0.5%) of otherwise normal individuals and in a higher percentage (3% to 10%) of patients with other congenital heart abnormalities. Because this vein drains into the coronary sinus, dilation of the coronary sinus is seen on parasternal long- and short-axis views and on an apical

**Fig. 17.26 Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries.** Two long-axis images are obtained from a parasternal position with the aorta *(Ao)* and the pulmonary artery *(PA)* in a side-by-side orientation. The systemic RV and anteriorly located aorta are seen *(upper left)*, with the muscular separation between the atrioventricular valve and semilunar valve evident. This anterior great vessel was identified as the aorta by following it superiorly to the arch and head and neck vessels. With slight lateral angulation, a long-axis view of the venous LV and posteriorly located (and dilated) PA is seen *(upper right)*. Note the fibrous continuity between the atrioventricular and semilunar valve. In the short-axis view *(lower left)*, the aortic and pulmonic valves are both seen in cross section, with the aortic valve located anterior to the pulmonic valve. The apical four-chamber view in the standard display format *(lower right)* demonstrates the anatomic RV on the patient's left, which serves as the systemic ventricle. Note apical displacement of the tricuspid valve septal leaflet compared with the mitral leaflet insertion *(arrows)*. This patient has significant regurgitation of the systemic (anatomic tricuspid) atrioventricular valve resulting in LA enlargement.

four-chamber view angulated posteriorly (see Fig. 15.5). This last view nicely illustrates the entry of the dilated coronary sinus into the RA. The diagnosis can be confirmed (if questions remain) by injection of echocontrast material, which will first opacify the coronary sinus and then the RA, into the left arm. Injection of echo-contrast material into the right arm will opacify only the RA. The dilated coronary sinus often protrudes into the LA, particularly on the parasternal long-axis view, and is sometimes mistaken for an LA mass.

Idiopathic dilation of the PA is another uncommon benign abnormality. The diagnosis is made when the PA is enlarged, but no evidence of pulmonic stenosis (which could result in poststenotic dilation) or other congenital abnormalities is present.

A Chiari network is a prominent inferior vena cava valve with fibrous extensions to the crista terminalis, coronary sinus valve, or both; it is seen in 2% of patients undergoing TEE echocardiography. These fibrous connections are fenestrated and lax, forming a "network" that shows rapid, chaotic motion during the cardiac cycle. On 2D imaging, the appearance of small, echogenic targets moving rapidly in the RA suggests this diagnosis. Although the Chiari network itself is benign, the likelihood of an associated atrial septal aneurysm or patent foramen ovale is high (see Fig. 15.27).

### COMMON TYPES OF PALLIATED ADULT CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE

### Classification of Types of Procedures

Numerous palliative and corrective surgical treatments for congenital heart disease have been developed since the first closure of a patent ductus arteriosus in 1938. These procedures are grouped into several categories, as indicated in [Table 17.2](#page--1-44) and as listed here:

- Relief of stenosis
- Closures
- Shunts
- Pulmonary banding
- Atrial switch
- Arterial switch
- Conduits

The approximate years during which each procedure was performed are shown in [Table 17.2](#page--1-44) to indicate which are likely to be encountered in a patient of a given age and to provide a historical

However, many patients with older surgical procedures continue to be seen as they survive longer in adulthood.

Procedures to relieve congenital stenotic lesions include aortic coarctation repair; pulmonic, aortic, or mitral valvotomy either with direct surgical inspection or with a percutaneous balloon; and the Konno procedure to relieve LV outflow obstruction. A residual gradient usually is present after these procedures, and valvular regurgitation is common.

Procedures to close congenital intracardiac shunts— ASDs, VSDs, patent ductus arteriosus—are conceptually straightforward and use approaches that include suturing the edges of the defect together (primary closure), using a surgical pericardial or synthetic patch to cover the defect, or closing the shunt with a percutaneous device. The most common long-term complication of shunt closure is a residual shunt.

In conditions with low pulmonary blood flow (e.g., tetralogy of Fallot, complete transposition of the great arteries, pulmonary atresia, or tricuspid atresia), an intracardiac shunt can be created to increase pulmonary blood flow. Shunts redirect flow from a systemic artery to a PA (Blalock-Taussig, Potts, Waterston), from a systemic vein to the PA (Glenn), or at the atrial level (Blalock-Hanlon or balloon atrial septostomy). In some cases, these shunts are removed ("taken down") at the time of subsequent corrective surgery. Complications of surgical shunts include:

- Inadequate pulmonary blood flow due to kinking or closure of the shunt
- Excessive pulmonary blood flow resulting in pulmonary hypertension
- Thrombus formation

Pulmonary banding is a palliative procedure that creates functional pulmonic stenosis to reduce pulmonary blood flow and "protect" the pulmonary vasculature from irreversible pulmonary hypertension. Banding is performed in patients with a large left-toright shunt when definitive repair is not possible or must be delayed. If the degree of banding is not adequate, pulmonary hypertension still ensues. Distal migration of the band results in unequal right versus left PA obstruction.

Other intracardiac repairs include the Fontan procedure, which directs systemic venous return to the PA without an intervening RV in patients with an absent right heart (e.g., tricuspid atresia) and other more complex repairs, as indicated in [Table 17.2.](#page--1-44) When patients with previous surgical procedures for congenital heart disease are referred for echocardiographic evaluation, more detailed references on congenital heart disease are helpful in planning, performing, and interpreting the echocardiographic examination.

### Tetralogy of Fallot

The three primary characteristics of tetralogy of Fallot [\(Figs. 17.27](#page--1-67) and [17.28](#page--1-68)) are:

- Membranous VSD
- Large aorta positioned across ("overriding") the VSD
- RV outflow obstruction—subvalvular, supravalvular, or valvular

![](_page_24_Figure_10.jpeg)

**Fig. 17.27 Tetralogy of Fallot.** Schematic diagram of tetralogy of Fallot *(TOF)* shows a large ventricular septal defect with an enlarged aorta *(Ao)* that spans (or overrides) the defect. Also noted are pulmonic stenosis (subpulmonic or valvular) and compensatory RV hypertrophy. *PA,* Pulmonary artery.

The fourth feature of this tetralogy is RV hypertrophy secondary to outflow obstruction. Adults with an untreated tetralogy of Fallot are rarely seen because of the high mortality rate of this condition without surgical intervention. In adults with a repaired tetralogy of Fallot, the VSD patch is evident, the aortic root is enlarged, and some degree of residual RV outflow obstruction usually persists. However, the major longterm issue in adults with surgically treated tetralogy of Fallot is late pulmonic regurgitation [\(Fig. 17.29](#page--1-69)).

**Fig. 17.28 Unrepaired tetralogy of Fallot.** In this 23-year-old man, the overriding aorta and ventricular septal defect are seen in the parasternal long-axis view *(left)*. The CW Doppler signal across the stenotic pulmonic valve has a maximum velocity of 5 m/s, consistent with severe pulmonic stenosis and low pulmonary pressures *(right)*. *Ao,* Aorta; *PARA,* parasternal, *RVOT,* RV outflow tract.

**Fig. 17.29 Severe pulmonic regurgitation after tetralogy of Fallot repair.** In a 34-year-old woman with a repaired tetralogy of Fallot and progressive RV enlargement, the CW Doppler signal across the pulmonic valve shows laminar forward and reverse low-velocity flow *(arrow)* consistent with severe pulmonic regurgitation. Because the flow velocity is low, this finding often is missed on real-time viewing of the images, thus emphasizing the importance of frame-by-frame review when this diagnosis is suspected.

**Fig. 17.30 Atrial and arterial switch procedures for complete transposition of the great arteries.** *(Left)* With an atrial switch operation, such as a Mustard or Senning procedure, an interatrial baffle directs systemic venous return to the anatomic LV (and then to the pulmonary artery *[PA]*) and pulmonary venous return to the anatomic RV (and then aorta *[Ao]*). Adequate visualization of the interatrial baffle usually requires TEE imaging in adults *(right).* With the arterial switch procedure, the PA and aorta are transected and reconnected to the correct ventricle. The coronary artery ostia are reimplanted into the neoaorta (the native pulmonic sinuses that are now connected to the aorta). In some patients, dilation of the neoaorta and aortic regurgitation are late complications. *d-TGA,* Complete transposition of the great arteries; *IVC,* inferior vena cava; *SVC,* superior vena cava.

With severe pulmonic regurgitation, color Doppler imaging is unimpressive because diastolic reverse flow is laminar and low in velocity. The pulsed or CW Doppler signal is diagnostic with diastolic reversal of flow equal in signal strength to antegrade flow, with the signal reaching the zero baseline before enddiastole, because of the equalization of pulmonic and RV diastolic pressures. Evaluation of RV size and systolic function on serial studies is particularly important, although quantitative CMR measurement of RV volumes and ejection fraction now is considered the optimal approach.

### Complete Transposition of the Great Arteries

With complete transposition of the great arteries (often abbreviated *d-TGA*), at birth pulmonary venous flow returning to the anatomic left ventricle is ejected into the pulmonary artery, whereas systemic venous return into the anatomic right ventricle is ejected into the aorta. Survival initially depends on mixing of blood via an ASD or VSD to provide oxygenated blood to the systemic circulation, followed by a surgical repair that redirects systemic venous return to the pulmonary artery and pulmonary venous return to the aorta via a "switch" at either the atrial or arterial level.

Older adults with complete transposition of the great arteries most likely had an atrial switch procedure, whereas younger adults more likely underwent an arterial switch or Rastelli procedure [\(Figs. 17.30](#page--1-70) and [17.31\)](#page--1-71). Atrial switch (Mustard or Senning) procedures for complete transposition are designed to redirect systemic venous return to the PA (via the anatomic LV) and pulmonary venous return to the aorta (via the anatomic RV). The 3D anatomy of these baffles is complex and is difficult to demonstrate on a TTE study because of poor ultrasound penetration at that depth [\(Fig. 17.32](#page--1-72)). A TEE approach improves image quality, but an experienced examiner and multiple tomographic planes are needed to assess the interatrial baffle fully. Late complications of this procedure include baffle obstruction, baffle leaks, systolic dysfunction of the systemic (anatomic right) ventricle, and arrhythmias.

The arterial switch procedure has replaced the interatrial baffle repair for complete transposition. The aorta and the PA are transected and reconnected to the correct ventricular chambers, thereby resulting in a physiologic normal flow pattern. Complications of this procedure are related to reimplantation of the coronary arteries and supravalvular great vessel obstruction at the anastomotic sites. Long term, dilation of the "aortic sinuses" with aortic regurgitation (the anatomic pulmonary root and valve) also is seen [\(Fig.](#page--1-73) [17.33](#page--1-73)). The transposed positions of the aorta and the PA are seen on echocardiography, and with other imaging approaches in patients with complete

The pulmonic ventricle *(PV)* is an anatomic LV. With the image plane angled posteriorly (A), the pulmonary venous return channel of the baffle is well seen. Color Doppler (C) shows normal inflow, which is confirmed by pulsed Doppler recordings (D) showing low-velocity diastolic flow. With the apical view angled anteriorly (B), the systemic venous return limb of the baffle is seen. Further anterior angulation showed the side-by-side aorta and pulmonary artery.

transposition, even after an atrial or arterial switch procedure.

### Fontan Physiology

In patients with tricuspid atresia or other types of complex congenital heart disease with only one functional ventricle (single-ventricle physiology), various approaches are used to ensure adequate flow to the pulmonary circulation to allow oxygenation of blood. The Fontan procedure connects systemic venous return to the PA without an intervening ventricular chamber. This connection currently is made directly from the inferior vena cava to the PA (lateral tunnel or extracardiac) with the superior vena cava connected to the PA (a bidirectional Glenn connection) [\(Fig. 17.34](#page--1-74)). An RA-to-PA connection, with severe RA enlargement, still is occasionally seen in patients with an older Fontan procedure. Evaluation of patients with a Fontan procedure is complicated by the numerous variations of the surgical approach in the method of connecting systemic venous return to the PA, broadly categorized as interatrial versus lateral tunnel. TEE imaging often is required for adequate visualization, although TTE may be adequate for evaluation of Doppler flow patterns. ([Fig. 17.35\)](#page--1-75). Late complications of the Fontan procedure include baffle obstruction, interatrial shunts, and thrombus formation.

### LIMITATIONS OF ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY AND ALTERNATE APPROACHES

### Measurement of RV Volumes and Ejection Fraction

Accurate quantitative measures of RV size and function are needed for clinical decision making in adults with congenital heart disease; for example, in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonic regurgitation. Echocardiography allows categorization of RV size as normal versus mild, moderate, or severe dilation and allows a similar qualitative estimate of systolic function. CMR imaging now allows accurate measurement of RV size and volume and currently is recommended, in conjunction with periodic echocardiography, for patient management [\(Fig. 17.36\)](#page--1-76).

### Calculations of Shunt Ratios

Accurate calculation of shunt ratios by Doppler echocardiography depends on accurate stroke volume determinations at two intracardiac sites. Each of these stroke volume determinations is affected by several factors, as discussed in Chapter 6. Alternate methods for calculation of pulmonary-to-systemic shunt ratios include: (1) cardiac catheterization with measurement

The early Fontan repair connected the RA directly to the PA. These patients often have severe RA enlargement at long-term follow-up. *Ao,* Aorta. *(From Child J: Echocardiographic evaluation of the adult with postoperative congenital heart disease.

Color Doppler (B) shows pulmonary venous inflow into the ventricle *(arrow);* no color is seen in the Fontan because flow is low in velocity and perpendicular to the ultrasound beam. Pulsed Doppler (C) shows low-velocity continuous flow in the conduit *(arrow).* Often, TEE or CMR imaging is needed for better visualization of the Fontan conduit.

### Imaging Cardiac Anatomy

TTE imaging in adult patients with congenital heart disease is limited by poor acoustic access [\(Table 17.3](#page--1-77)). Even when image quality is acceptable, lateral resolution at the depth of interest on TTE limits evaluation of posterior conduits, interatrial baffle repair procedures, sinus venous ASDs, or anomalous pulmonary venous return. TEE offers improved image quality, particularly of posterior structures, and is a useful adjunct to TTE imaging in this patient population. Although 3D imaging is helpful in selected cases, the limitations of acoustic access and ultrasound artifacts are still present. In adults with congenital heart disease, 3D imaging is most helpful for evaluation of ASDs, 3D visualization of atrioventricular valve anatomy, and quantitation of ventricular function. In addition, 3D imaging is essential during transcatheter interventions to guide the procedure, immediately detect

complications, and assess anatomy and blood flow at the completion of the procedure.

*PA,* Pulmonary artery; *Qp:Qs*, pulmonary-to-systemic shunt ratio.

Evaluation of extracardiac anatomy by echocardiography limits evaluation of the PA branches, systemic arterial or venous shunts to the PA, and abnormalities of the ascending aorta and aortic arch. Other tomographic imaging techniques are especially helpful in assessing the position of the cardiac structures in the chest and in evaluating mediastinal abnormalities not accessible by ultrasound. Both CT and CMR imaging are helpful, with the advantage of a wide field of view for both techniques ([Fig. 17.37\)](#page--1-78). With both CT and CMR imaging, data are reformatted, in an orientation based on the long axis of the LV, into standard long- and short-axis views facilitating identification of abnormal structures.

Other limitations of echocardiography are due to the use of a tomographic approach. For example,

**Fig. 17.37 Computed tomography imaging with contrast in a patient with complete transposition of the great arteries.** (A) The interatrial baffle repair *(arrow)* directing pulmonary venous return to the systemic ventricle *(SV)* is seen. This patient also has a mechanical pulmonary atrioventricular valve replacement. (B) At the level of the great arteries, the aorta *(Ao)* is anterior and slightly leftward to the pulmonary artery *(PA). PV,* Pulmonary ventricle.

coronary anatomy cannot be assessed adequately with tomographic techniques. CT or direct coronary angiography is needed. Another example of potential shortcomings of echocardiography is that multiple VSDs may be missed unless careful evaluation in numerous tomographic planes is performed, although 3D imaging is helpful when image quality is adequate. A silhouette technique, such as ventriculography from an angle at which the septum forms one of the borders of the ventricular chamber, has a high reliability for detection of multiple VSDs. Limitations of angiography include the risks of contrast dye injection and its cost and invasive nature.

### Intracardiac Hemodynamics

Although the definitive method for the assessment of intracardiac hemodynamics remains cardiac catheterization with direct pressure measurement, much indirect information on intracardiac hemodynamics is derived from the CW Doppler signal. PA pressure is approximated by the evaluation of pulmonic regurgitation, the tricuspid regurgitant jet, or both. Maximum and mean pressure gradients across stenotic valves are measured accurately with Doppler techniques. Inferences about the chronicity of regurgitation and the presence or absence of *v*-waves are possible based on the shape of the regurgitant velocity curve. Estimates of LV end-diastolic pressure are possible based on aortic regurgitant velocity at end-diastole, the pattern of LV diastolic filling, or pulmonary venous flow patterns. However, invasive pressure measurements still are often needed for appropriate clinical decision making in adults with congenital heart disease. In particular, evaluation of pulmonary vascular resistance, which requires invasive data, is an essential factor in patient treatment.

### INTEGRATING THE DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH

Whichever diagnostic imaging procedure is performed first in an individual patient—be it echocardiography, catheterization, CT, or CMR imaging—the next step should be to consider the data acquired in terms of both the anatomic and physiologic diagnoses and the certainty that each of these diagnoses are correct. Then, the remaining important clinical questions should be formulated, and the most appropriate study to answer those questions should be performed next. When this approach is used, the echocardiogram usually is the initial test to assess cardiac anatomy and physiology, or is performed only to answer a specific clinical question.

### Categories of Congenital Heart Disease

#### **Congenital Stenotic Lesions**

Subvalvular Valvular Supravalvular

Great vessels (e.g., aortic coarctation)

#### **Congenital Regurgitant Lesions**

Ebstein anomaly Cleft mitral valve

#### **Abnormal Intracardiac Communications**

Atrial septal defect Ventricular septal defect Patent ductus arteriosus

#### **Abnormal Chamber and Great Vessel Connections**

Transposition of the great arteries (d-TGA) Congenitally corrected transposition (l-TGA or cc-TGA) Tetralogy of Fallot Tricuspid atresia Truncus arteriosus

#### Approach to the Echocardiographic Examination in Adults With Congenital Heart Disease

#### **Before the Examination**

Review the clinical history. Obtain details of any prior surgical procedures. Review results of prior diagnostic tests. Formulate specific questions.

#### **Sequence of Examination**

Identify cardiac chambers, great vessels, and their connections.

Identify associated defects, and evaluate the physiology of each lesion.

Regurgitation and/or stenosis (quantitate as per Chapters 11 and 12)

Shunts (calculate *Q*p*:Q*s)

Pulmonary hypertension (calculate pulmonary pressure) Ventricular dysfunction (measure ejection fraction if anatomy allows)

#### **After the Examination**

Integrate echo and Doppler findings with clinical data. Summarize findings.

Identify which clinical questions remain unanswered, and suggest appropriate subsequent diagnostic tests.
