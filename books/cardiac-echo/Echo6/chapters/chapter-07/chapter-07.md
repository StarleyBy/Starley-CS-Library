entricular emptying and filling are complex interdependent processes, with the cardiac cycle conceptually divided into systole and diastole to allow clinical measurements of disease severity. *Diastolic* ventricular dysfunction plays a key role in the clinical manifestations of disease in patients with a wide range of cardiac disorders. In patients with clinical heart failure who have a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), diastolic dysfunction is the predominant cause of symptoms. Diastolic dysfunction often is an early sign of cardiac diseases (as in hypertension) and frequently antedates clinical or echocardiographic evidence of systolic dysfunction. In addition, in patients with heart failure with reduced V

ejection fraction, the degree of diastolic dysfunction may explain differences in clinical symptoms among patients with similar ejection fractions.

Echocardiographic techniques allow evaluation of right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) diastolic filling patterns, the velocity of myocardial motion, and right atrial (RA) and left atrial (LA) filling patterns. Newer approaches to the evaluation of diastolic function include strain imaging of the LV and LA. The relationship between these noninvasive measures and ventricular diastolic function and the utility of these measures in patient evaluation are discussed in this chapter. Specific patterns of diastolic dysfunction are discussed in chapters relevant to each disease process.

## BASIC PRINCIPLES

#### Phases of Diastole

Diastole is the interval from aortic valve closure (end-systole) to mitral valve closure (end-diastole) [\(Fig.](#page--1-48) [7.1](#page--1-48)). The isovolumic contraction period, from mitral valve closure to aortic valve opening, is part of systole.

Diastole can be divided into four phases:

- Isovolumic relaxation
- Early rapid diastolic filling
- Diastasis
- Late diastolic filling caused by atrial contraction

*Isovolumic relaxation* starts with aortic valve closure, followed by a rapid decline in LV pressure. When LV pressure falls below LA pressure, the mitral valve opens, ending the isovolumic relaxation period. Maximal opening of the mitral leaflets occurs rapidly, within 100 ± 10 ms of valve opening, in normal individuals. Mitral valve opening is followed by *rapid*

**Fig. 7.2 Diastolic filling curves.** The relationship between LV volume and the diastolic LV Doppler filling pattern is shown. Early rapid filling coincides with the *E* velocity, followed by diastasis (with little or no flow from the LA to the LV), and atrial contraction (which coincides with the late diastolic *A* velocity). The Doppler velocity curve, in effect, is the first derivative of the LV volume curve. *Ao,* Aortic; *MV,* mitral valve.

*early diastolic filling*, with the rate and time course of LA to LV flow determined by several factors, including the pressure difference along the flow stream, ventricular relaxation, and the relative compliances of the two chambers.

As the ventricle fills, pressures in the atrium and ventricle equalize, resulting in a period of *diastasis,* during which little movement of blood between the chambers occurs, and the mitral leaflets remain in a semiopen position. The duration of diastasis depends on heart rate; it is longer at slow heart rates and entirely absent at faster heart rates. With *atrial contraction*, LA pressure again exceeds LV pressure, thus resulting in further mitral leaflet opening and a second pulse of LV filling. In normal individuals this atrial contribution accounts for only about 20% of total ventricular filling [\(Fig. 7.2](#page--1-49)).

The phases of diastole for the RV are analogous to those described for the LV, with the difference that the total duration of diastole is slightly shorter in normal individuals because of a slightly longer RV systolic ejection period.

#### Parameters of Diastolic Function

Several physiologic parameters can be used to describe different aspects of diastolic function, but no single measure of overall diastolic function exists. The most clinically relevant parameters of diastolic function are:

- Ventricular relaxation
- Myocardial or chamber compliance
- Filling pressures

Additional parameters of interest include elastic recoil of the ventricle and the effect of pericardial constraint, but the importance of these factors in normal diastolic ventricular function remains controversial.

#### *Ventricular Relaxation*

LV relaxation, occurring during isovolumic relaxation and the early diastolic filling period, is an active process involving the use of energy by the myocardium. Factors affecting isovolumic relaxation include internal loading forces (cardiac fiber length), external loading conditions (wall stress, arterial impedance), inactivation of myocardial contraction (metabolic, neurohumoral, and pharmacologic), and nonuniformity in the spatial and temporal patterns of these factors. Abnormal relaxation results in prolongation of the isovolumic relaxation time, a slower rate of decline in ventricular pressure, and a consequent reduction in the early peak filling rate (due to a smaller pressure difference between the atrium and the ventricle when the atrioventricular valve opens). Measures of LV relaxation include the isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT), the maximum rate of pressure decline *(*−*dP/dt),* and the time constant of relaxation (tau or τ). Several different mathematical approaches to the calculation of τ are available, but basically it reflects the rate of pressure decline from the point of maximum −*dP/dt* to mitral valve opening. Although peak rapid filling rate is affected by ventricular relaxation, it is only an indirect measure of this physiologic parameter because several other factors also affect peak filling [\(Fig. 7.3](#page--1-50)).

#### *Ventricular Compliance*

*Compliance* is the ratio of change in volume to change in pressure *(dV/dP).* Stiffness is the inverse of compliance: the ratio of change in pressure to change in volume *(dP/dV).* Conceptually, compliance can be divided into myocardial (the characteristics of the isolated myocardium) and chamber (the characteristics of the entire ventricle) components. Chamber compliance is influenced by ventricular size and shape, in addition to the characteristics of the myocardium. Extrinsic factors also affect measurement of compliance, including the pericardium, RV volume, and pleural pressure. Evaluation of ventricular compliance is based on diastolic passive pressure-volume curves showing the degree to which pressure and volume change in relation to each other over the physiologic range [\(Fig. 7.4](#page--1-51)).

![](_page_2_Figure_12.jpeg)

**Fig. 7.3 Impaired left ventricular relaxation.** A reduced −*dP/dt* and a prolonged time constant of relaxation are noted. The Doppler velocity curve shows a prolonged isovolumic relaxation time *(IVRT),* reduced *E* velocity (corresponding to a low LA-LV gradient at mitral valve opening), and an increased *A* velocity. *Ao,* Aortic.

#### *Ventricular Diastolic Pressures*

Clinically, evaluation of diastolic pressures alone often is used in patient management. Diastolic "filling" pressures include LV end-diastolic pressure and mean LA pressure. LV end-diastolic pressure reflects ventricular pressure after filling is complete, and LA pressure reflects the average pressure in the LA during diastole. Clinically, LA pressure is estimated by the pulmonary wedge pressure either at a single time point in the cardiac catheterization laboratory or at many time points with an indwelling right heart (Swan-Ganz) catheter in the intensive care unit.

#### *Ventricular Diastolic Filling (Volume) Curves*

Another clinically available measure related to diastolic function is the time course of ventricular filling. In theory, an LV volume curve can be generated by multiplying mitral annulus area by the integral of the Doppler velocity curve for each time point in diastole. LV filling curves also can be generated from

**Fig. 7.4 Reduced diastolic compliance.** The passive pressure-volume relationship of the LV is steeper than normal. As LV volume increases in diastole, pressure rises rapidly, resulting in an initial high LA-LV pressure gradient with a rapid decrease in the filling gradient during diastole. The Doppler velocity curve shows a decreased isovolumic relaxation time *(IVRT),* a steep deceleration slope, and a reduced *A* velocity. Note that even with normal compliance, reduced systolic function *(fx)* results in a rightward shift along the normal pressure-volume relationship, resulting in a pattern of diastolic filling similar to decreased compliance.

frame-by-frame measurements of ventricular volumes using three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography. The accuracy, reproducibility, and diagnostic value of LV filling curve data require further study before widespread clinical application.

Ventricular *diastolic function* is one of the major factors affecting the pattern of *diastolic filling,* but these two concepts are not identical. Several physiologic parameters other than diastolic function affect diastolic filling. Given no change in diastolic function (e.g., relaxation, compliance), the peak **early diastolic filling rate** will be affected by:

- Changes in preload that affect the initial pressure difference between the ventricle and the atrium (e.g., increased with volume loading, decreased with volume depletion)
- A change in transmitral volume flow rate (e.g., increased with coexisting mitral regurgitation)
- A change in atrial pressure (e.g., elevated LV end-diastolic pressure or a *v*-wave caused by mitral regurgitation)

Late diastolic filling is affected by:

- Cardiac rhythm
- Atrial contractile function
- Ventricular end-diastolic pressure
- Heart rate
- The timing of atrial contraction (PR interval)
- Ventricular diastolic function

The importance of considering how these factors affect the Doppler pattern of diastolic filling is discussed in more detail in the following sections. In addition, it is obvious that the utility of ventricular diastolic filling patterns for assessing diastolic function is valid only in the absence of mitral valve disease because, with mitral stenosis, LV filling velocity and timing are predominantly affected by the severity of valve obstruction, whereas with mitral regurgitation, the transmitral volume flow rate is increased, altering the LV inflow velocity curve. In patients with rhythms other than normal sinus rhythm (e.g., atrial fibrillation), evaluation of diastolic function with Doppler is more challenging because of the absence of atrial contraction and the varying length of the diastolic filling period.

#### *Atrial Pressures and Filling Curves*

Another component in the evaluation of ventricular diastolic function is the measurement of atrial filling patterns and pressures. The atrium serves as a "conduit" for flow from the venous circulation to the ventricle, especially in early diastole, when the atrium is not contracting. In addition, elevations in ventricular diastolic pressures are reflected in elevated pressures in the atrium ([Fig. 7.5\)](#page--1-52).

RA pressures normally are quite low (0 to 5 mmHg), with only small increases in pressure following atrial (*a*-wave) and ventricular (*v*-wave) contraction.

**Right atrial filling** is characterized by:

- A small reversal of flow following atrial contraction (*a*-wave)
- A systolic phase (which is effectively "diastole" for the atrium) when blood flows from the superior and inferior vena cavae into the atrium
- A small reversal of flow at end-systole (*v*-wave)
- A diastolic filling phase when the atrium serves as a conduit for flow from the systemic venous return to the RV

These filling phases are reflected in the patterns of jugular venous pulsation familiar to the clinician: the *a*-wave following atrial contraction, the *x*-descent corresponding to atrial filling during ventricular systole, the *v*-wave at end-systole, and the *y*-descent corresponding to atrial filling during ventricular diastole. Disease processes affect the jugular venous pulsations and the Doppler pattern of RA filling in similar ways.

![](_page_4_Figure_5.jpeg)

Fig. 7.5 Right atrial (hepatic vein) and left atrial (pulmonary vein) filling patterns. Atrial filling patterns are similar to the pattern of jugular venous pulsations seen on physical examination with atrial (a) and ventricular (v) "waves." Pulmonary and hepatic vein patterns appear "opposite" in direction because the direction of flow in the hepatic vein using a transthoracic subcostal view is away from the transducer (into the RA), whereas the direction of flow from a transthoracic apical view of the pulmonary vein is toward the transducer (into the LA).

**LA filling** from the pulmonary veins also is characterized by:

- A small reversal of flow following atrial contraction (a-wave)
- A systolic filling phase
- A blunting of flow or brief reversal at end-systole (v-wave)
- A diastolic filling phase

In normal individuals, the systolic and diastolic filling phases are approximately equal in volume. Normal LA pressure is low (5 to 10 mmHg), corresponding to the normal LV end-diastolic pressure, with slight increases in pressure following atrial (a-wave) and ventricular (v-wave) contraction.

## Normal Respiratory Changes

Normal LV and RV diastolic filling shows respiratory variation. With inspiration, negative intrapleural pressure results in an increase in systemic venous return into the thorax and thus into the RA. This increase in RA volume and pressure results in a transient increase in RV diastolic filling volumes and velocities, with a normal magnitude of increase of up to 20% compared with end-expiratory values.

LA filling does *not* increase with inspiration because pulmonary venous return is entirely intrathoracic and thus not affected significantly by respiratory changes in intrathoracic pressure. In fact, LA and, consequently, LV diastolic filling is slightly higher at end-expiration than during inspiration. The mechanism of this observation remains controversial. Some investigators postulate a delay in transit of the increased RV filling to the left side of the heart. Others suggest a decrease in LA filling during inspiration because of an increased volume (or "pooling") in the pulmonary venous bed. Less likely in normal individuals is impaired LV diastolic filling due to an increase in RV diastolic volume within a fixed-volume pericardium. This last mechanism becomes important in patients with pericardial disease (e.g., constriction, tamponade) and partly accounts for the exaggerated respiratory changes in RV and LV diastolic filling seen in these conditions.

## Causes of Diastolic Dysfunction

Although diastolic dysfunction can be seen with a wide range of cardiac disorders, the four basic mechanisms of disease (Table 7.1) that lead to diastolic dysfunction are:

- Primary myocardial disease
- Secondary LV hypertrophy
- Coronary artery disease
- Extrinsic constraint

#### ANATOMIC PARAMETERS

#### Left Ventricular Changes

Evaluation of ventricular chamber dimensions and wall thickness is an integral part of the echocardiographic evaluation of diastolic function. The relative degree of systolic and diastolic dysfunction in patients with heart failure ranges from severe diastolic

dysfunction with a normal ejection fraction to severe systolic dysfunction with normal filling pressures. However, most patients with systolic dysfunction have some degree of diastolic dysfunction, and most patients with diastolic dysfunction have anatomic cardiac changes evident on echocardiographic imaging. Typically, diastolic heart failure (HFpEF) occurs in patients with a thick-walled, small ventricle due to either restrictive cardiomyopathy or hypertensive heart disease. The presence and severity of LA enlargement reflect chronically elevated filling pressures, so that measurement of LA size or volume is integral to evaluation of diastolic function (see Fig. 2.16).

In patients with heart failure due primarily to systolic ventricular dysfunction (heart failure with reduced ejection fraction), typical imaging findings include a dilated LV with global or regional dysfunction and a reduced ejection fraction. Diastolic dysfunction usually accompanies systolic dysfunction, and measures of diastolic function and LV filling pressures are important for patient management and prognosis.

## Left Atrial Volumes

LA volume is a key element in the evaluation of diastolic dysfunction. Measurement of LA volumes by two-dimensional (2D) or 3D imaging is feasible and accurate and is a strong predictor of clinical outcome. However, LA volume is nonspecific because, in addition to diastolic dysfunction, LA volume increases with age, athletic conditioning, cardiac arrhythmias, high-output states (e.g., anemia), and mitral valve disease.

#### Other Imaging Parameters

Other imaging findings that raise the question of diastolic dysfunction include pericardial thickening (as in constrictive pericarditis), the pattern of ventricular septal motion with respiration (especially with tamponade physiology), and dilation of the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins (consistent with elevated RA pressures). Elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressures, in the absence of another cause such as mitral valve disease or primary pulmonary disease, also raise the concern for LV diastolic dysfunction.

#### DOPPLER EVALUATION OF LV FILLING

#### Nomenclature and Measurements

Doppler recordings of LV diastolic filling velocities correspond closely with ventricular filling parameters measured by other techniques. The normal Doppler ventricular inflow pattern is characterized by a brief time interval between aortic valve closure and the onset of ventricular filling (the isovolumic relaxation time). Immediately following mitral valve opening rapid acceleration of blood flow from the LA to the ventricle occurs with an early peak filling velocity of 0.6 to 0.8 m/s 90 to 110 ms after the onset of flow in young, healthy individuals [\(Table 7.2\)](#page--1-55). This early maximum filling velocity (*E* velocity) occurs simultaneously with the maximum pressure gradient between the atrium and the ventricle. After this maximum velocity, flow decelerates rapidly (i.e., with a steep slope) in normal individuals with a normal deceleration slope of 4.3 to 6.7 m/s2 [\(Table 7.3](#page--1-56)). Deceleration time, defined as the time interval from the *E* peak to where a line following the deceleration slope intersects with the zero baseline, ranges from 140 to 200 ms. Early diastolic filling is followed by a variable period of minimal flow (diastasis), depending on the total duration of diastole. With atrial contraction, LA pressure again exceeds ventricular pressure, with a resulting second velocity peak (late diastolic or atrial velocity), which typically ranges from 0.19 to 0.35 m/s in young, normal individuals [\(Fig. 7.6](#page--1-54)).

Quantitative measurements that can be made from the Doppler velocity curve include [\(Fig. 7.7](#page--1-57)):

- *Maximum velocities:* The *E* velocity, the *A* velocity, and their ratio (*E/A* ratio)
- *Velocity-time integrals:* Total, early diastolic, atrial contribution, first third or half of diastole, and their ratios
- *Time intervals:* The isovolumic relaxation time, the total duration of diastole, the deceleration time, and the atrial filling period
- *Measures of acceleration and deceleration:* The time from onset of flow to the *E* velocity, the maximum rate of rise in velocity, and the slope of early diastolic deceleration

#### Volumetric Flow Rates

To convert the Doppler ventricular inflow *velocity* curve to a *volume* curve, the cross-sectional area of flow must be taken into account. Volumetric flow rates can be calculated as the product of velocity and cross-sectional area in regions where flow is laminar with a spatially symmetric flow pattern ([Fig. 7.8](#page--1-58)). Thus the instantaneous volume flow rate across the mitral valve can be calculated as instantaneous velocity times the flow cross-sectional area (CSA). Similarly, transmitral stroke volume (SV) can be determined from the integral of the flow velocity curve (VTI) over the diastolic filling period:

$$SV_{transmitral} = VTI \times CSA$$
 (Eq. 7.1)

The standard approach to determining the crosssectional area of flow across the mitral valve is to calculate the cross-sectional area of flow at the mitral annulus level. Motion of the mitral leaflets is a passive

process, with the degree of motion reflecting flow across the valve (in the absence of mitral stenosis). Although flow area tapers from the annulus to the leaflet tips, the more rigid mitral annulus is a preferable site for flow measurement rather than the flexible, mobile leaflets. Even though the shape of the mitral annulus is complex in 3D, in clinical practice assuming either a circular or elliptical geometry is a reasonable approximation, based on a diameter measurement in the apical four-chamber or parasternal long-axis view or both (see Fig. 6.15).

Combining Doppler LV inflow velocity data with the cross-sectional area of the mitral annulus, additional filling parameters that can be calculated include:

- *Peak filling rates:* Peak rapid filling rate, atrial peak filling rate, and their ratio
- *Stroke volume*
- *Fractional filling rates:* For example, first third filling fraction or the ratio of early to late filling

For each of these parameters, the filling rate is calculated by multiplying the appropriate velocity or

Of course, volume flow measurements are accurate only when velocities and diameters are measured at the same anatomic location, for example, at the annulus level.

#### Doppler Data Recording

20:496, 1999.

LV inflow can be recorded in nearly all patients from an apical approach in either a four-chamber or longaxis view on transthoracic (TTE) imaging. This window allows parallel alignment between the ultrasound beam and the direction of LV filling. On transesophageal (TEE) echocardiography, LV inflow can be recorded from a high esophageal position, while taking care to align the Doppler beam parallel to the inflow stream [\(Fig. 7.9](#page--1-59)). In some patients, a transgastric apical view also allows recording of LV inflow, although caution is needed to avoid a nonparallel intercept angle (with resultant underestimation of velocities) and a foreshortening of the ventricle from this window.

Inflow velocities should be recorded using pulsed Doppler with a 2- to 3-mm sample volume positioned either at the mitral leaflet tips (for evaluation of diastolic function) or at the mitral annulus level (for measurement of volume flow rates and the duration of atrial filling) (see [Fig. 7.6\)](#page--1-54). For diastolic function evaluation, with the beam aligned parallel to the flow stream, the sample volume is moved slowly along the length of the ultrasound beam to identify the site of maximal velocity, usually at the mitral leaflet tip level. The velocity range is adjusted to maximize the display of the velocity of interest and avoid signal aliasing. The sweep speed of the spectral display is maximized (100 cm/s), and wall filters are reduced (as allowed by signal quality) so that the velocities approach the baseline, thus allowing accurate time interval measurements. Flows are recorded at end-expiration during normal breathing.

Standard clinical measurements of LV inflow include:

- Early diastolic filling velocity *(E)*
- Atrial filling velocity *(A)*
- Deceleration time (DT) all at the leaflet tips
- Atrial filling duration (*A*dur) is measured at the mitral annulus.

#### TISSUE DOPPLER MYOCARDIAL IMAGING

As the LV fills in diastole, the chamber lengthens from base to apex and expands in both radial and circumferential directions. The velocity of longitudinal myocardial lengthening in diastole (and shortening in systole) can be measured using pulsed tissue Doppler with the velocity scale, gain, and wall filters adjusted to display the velocity of the movement of the myocardium, rather than the intracavity blood flow velocities. Tissue Doppler myocardial velocities are less dependent on preload than are transmitral flow velocities and thus are useful measures in evaluation of diastolic function.

Compared with transmitral blood flow velocity, the myocardial velocity curve is similar but inverted and lower in velocity ([Fig. 7.10\)](#page--1-60). When myocardial tissue velocities are recorded near the mitral annulus from an apical approach, there is a brief early systolic velocity peak away from the transducer, corresponding

Fig. 7.6 Normal pattern of left ventricular diastolic filling. Pulsed Doppler recording in an apical four-chamber view with the sample volume positioned at the mitral leaflet tips (left) is used to measure E velocity, A velocity, and the deceleration time (arrow). The flow signal recorded with the sample volume positioned at the level of the mitral annulus level (right) is used for measurement of atrial flow duration. If transmitral stroke volume is calculated, the annular flow signal is used for the velocity-time integral.

to early diastolic relaxation, with a normal velocity between 0.10 and 0.14 cm/s. This early diastolic velocity is abbreviated as E' (E-prime) in this book, but other common abbreviations include e' (small e' instead of capital E')  $E_m$  (for mitral annular), and  $E_a$  (for annular). Following atrial contraction, a second velocity peak away from the apex is seen (A') with a normal ratio of E'/A' greater than 1.0. A reduced E'/A' ratio indicates impaired relaxation. The pattern

Fig. 7.8 Transmitral volume flow rate. Volumetric flow rates across the mitral annulus can be calculated as shown. Mitral annular diameter can be measured from both apical four-chamber and parasternal long-axis views to calculate an elliptical cross-sectional area (CSA). Alternatively, a circular cross-sectional area is used as an approximation using a single annular diameter measurement. SV, Stroke volume; VTI, flow velocity curve.

of E'/A' also helps distinguish normal LV filling from the pseudo-normalized pattern seen in patients with moderate to severe diastolic dysfunction.

Myocardial tissue Doppler signals are recorded using pulsed Doppler in an apical four-chamber view with a small sample volume (1 to 3 mm in length) positioned within the basal ventricular wall, within

1 cm of the mitral annulus. For evaluation of diastolic function, recordings from the basal septum (medial annulus) typically are used. Tissue Doppler velocities recorded from the lateral annulus usually are slightly higher in velocity but are not as reproducible as medial annulus measurements. Some experts recommend averaging medial and lateral annular tissue velocities. For Doppler tissue recordings, the velocity scale is decreased to show a range of only about 0.2 m/s, gain is turned to very low levels, and wall filters are reduced to obtain a well-defined signal with clear *E*′ and *A*′ peaks. Some instruments have a tissue Doppler setting that automatically makes these adjustments to the pulsed Doppler modality. Recordings are made at end-expiration during normal quiet

**Fig. 7.9 Transesophageal echocardiography transmitral flow velocities.** The typical pattern of LV diastolic filling is seen with a parallel alignment between the ultrasound beam and flow direction from a TEE four-chamber view. The only difference from a TTE flow recording is that flow is directed away from the transducer on TEE.

respiration. Standard clinical measurements from the myocardial tissue Doppler include:

- Early diastolic filling velocity *(E*′*)*
- Filling velocity after atrial contraction *(A*′*)*
- Ratio of early to atrial diastolic myocardial velocity *(E*′*/A*′*)*
- Ratio of transmitral blood flow velocity to tissue Doppler velocity *(E/E*′*)*

The rationale for the ratio of blood flow to tissue velocity is that the transmitral *E* velocity reflects both the LA to LV opening pressure gradient and the amount of blood entering the ventricle in diastole. In contrast, the tissue Doppler velocity reflects only the amount of blood entering the ventricle (the volume increase in ventricular size), so this ratio normalizes the *E* velocity for volume flow rate, thus providing a measure of filling pressure. A very high *E/E*′ ratio (>15) is specific for an elevated filling pressure, but this ratio is not very sensitive, so many patients with elevated filling pressures have a ratio between 8 and 15.

## LEFT ATRIAL FILLING

#### Nomenclature and Measurements

LA filling is evaluated by Doppler recordings of pulmonary vein flow either from a TEE or a TTE approach. Again, the Doppler pattern of velocities parallels the normal filling curves, with inflow into the LA occurring in two phases, systolic and diastolic. In addition, flow deceleration following ventricular contraction and a small reversal of flow after atrial contraction occur ([Fig. 7.11\)](#page--1-61). On TEE recordings, the systolic inflow pattern is biphasic in some patients, with an early systolic peak related to atrial relaxation and a second late systolic peak related to displacement of the mitral annulus toward the LV apex. Respiratory variation in flow is seen in left heart filling patterns

![](_page_9_Figure_16.jpeg)

**Fig. 7.10 Tissue Doppler imaging at the mitral annulus.** (A) The Doppler sample volume (S.V.) is located in the basal septum, adjacent to the mitral annulus, in the apical four-chamber view. (B) The tissue Doppler imaging *(TDI)* recording in a young normal patient shows an early myocardial velocity *(E*′*)* greater than the atrial velocity *(A*′*)*. The systolic velocity toward the transducer is termed *S*′. Note that the velocity scale has a maximum of only 0.15 m/s, compared with 1.5 m/s for LV inflow in [Fig. 7.6](#page--1-54) in the same patient.

(atrial and ventricular) but is less prominent than the variation seen in right heart filling patterns, *and* it is directionally opposite: left heart filling diminishes slightly with inspiration. Both the pulmonary veins and the LA are intrathoracic in their entirety, so negative intrathoracic pressure does not result in a pressure gradient between them. Instead, atrial filling diminishes during inspiration as blood "pools" briefly in the expanded pulmonary veins, which then empty during expiration.

## Doppler Data Recording

From a TEE approach, LA inflow patterns can be easily recorded in each of the four pulmonary veins in the transverse plane. Careful positioning and angulation are needed to ensure that the pulsed Doppler sample volume is located in the pulmonary vein itself rather than in the adjacent LA. A sample volume size of 2 to 3 mm typically is used, with wall filters lowered to show the low-velocity components associated with atrial and ventricular contraction. The flow pattern varies somewhat with distance from the pulmonary vein orifice. A distance about 1 cm from the orifice provides optimal signal strength with the most consistent inflow pattern.

The left superior pulmonary vein is most easily visualized adjacent to the LA appendage, directed somewhat anteriorly. The left inferior pulmonary vein can be visualized by advancing the transducer a short distance to see the inflow pattern from this horizontally directed vein. The right pulmonary veins can be imaged by turning the transducer medially to identify the superior right pulmonary vein (again anteriorly directed) and advancing the probe slightly to image the horizontally positioned right inferior pulmonary vein.

![](_page_10_Figure_9.jpeg)

**Fig. 7.12 Left atrial inflow on transesophageal echocardiography.** Normal pattern of LA inflow recorded in the right superior pulmonary vein from a transthoracic apical four-chamber view using color flow imaging to aid in positioning the sample volume approximately 1 to 2 cm into the vein. Filling shows systolic *(S)* and diastolic *(D)* filling phases with a slight flow reversal following atrial contraction *(a).*

From a TTE approach, recording pulmonary venous flow patterns is more challenging. Most echocardiographers use the apical four-chamber view, which allows a parallel alignment between the right superior pulmonary vein flow stream and the ultrasound beam. Signal strength is a limiting factor at this depth of interrogation (typically about 14 cm), so careful attention to sample volume position, wall filters, and gain settings is needed to optimize the velocity data. Sample volume positioning is facilitated by the use of color flow imaging to identify the flow stream from the pulmonary vein into the LA. Again, the sample volume should be positioned in the pulmonary vein, 1 to 2 cm from the orifice. Of note, atrial reversal and the biphasic pattern of systolic inflow are more difficult to demonstrate on TTE compared with TEE imaging because of a lower signal-to-noise ratio [\(Fig. 7.12](#page--1-62)). In addition, the flow pattern in the left upper pulmonary vein on TEE echocardiography shows a more laminar flow pattern than the right upper pulmonary vein. Alternate transthoracic windows for recording of pulmonary vein flow in some individuals include subcostal and parasternal short-axis views at the aortic valve level or suprasternal notch views of the LA and pulmonary veins. However, the intercept angle tends to be suboptimal from these windows.

Standard clinical measures of **pulmonary venous inflow** include:

- Peak systolic velocity (PVS)
- Peak diastolic velocity (PVD)
- Peak atrial reversal velocity (PVa)
- Duration of pulmonary vein atrial reversal (*a*dur)

## Isovolumic Relaxation Time

The isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) is simply the time interval between aortic valve closure and mitral valve opening. A normal isovolumic relaxation time is approximately 50 to 100 ms, but the normal range varies with age and heart rate. Impaired relaxation is associated with a prolonged isovolumic relaxation time, whereas decreased compliance and elevated filling pressures are associated with a shortened isovolumic relaxation time. Thus this measurement is useful in determining the severity of diastolic dysfunction, particularly in serial studies of patients receiving medical therapy or with disease progression.

The isovolumic relaxation time is measured from an apical four-chamber view angulated anteriorly to show the outflow tract and aortic valve. Using pulsed Doppler, a 3- to 5-mm sample volume is positioned midway between the aortic and mitral valves to obtain a clear signal showing both aortic outflow and mitral inflow, optimally with a defined aortic valve closing click. After adjusting gain and decreasing the wall filters, the isovolumic relaxation time is measured as the time interval in milliseconds from the middle of the aortic closure click to the onset of mitral flow [\(Fig. 7.13](#page--1-63)).

## Propagation Velocity

Color Doppler M-mode recordings of LV inflow from an apical approach can be used to measure the propagation velocity as blood moves from the annulus to the apex. The flow propagation velocity is decreased with restrictive ventricular filling and increased with constrictive pericarditis.

![](_page_11_Figure_8.jpeg)

**Fig. 7.13 Isovolumic relaxation time.** The isovolumic relaxation time *(IVRT)* is measured from aortic valve closure and the onset of mitral flow *(arrows)* and measures 96 ms in this example.

Color M-mode propagation velocity is recorded from an apical four-chamber view using color flow imaging to place a color M-mode cursor parallel to mitral inflow in the center of the flow stream ([Fig.](#page--1-64) [7.14](#page--1-64)). Using a narrow sector, minimum depth needed to include the annulus and apex, and an aliasing velocity of 0.5 to 0.7 m/s, the color M-mode signal is recorded at a fast sweep speed (100 to 200 mm/s). With normal diastolic function, the blood flows quickly from the annulus toward the apex, resulting in a nearly vertical M-mode color pattern. The slope of the line along the edge of the color Doppler M-mode in early diastole is termed the propagation velocity, with a normal value greater than 50 cm/s. With decreased relaxation, the movement of blood from the annulus to the apex is slower, so the slope of color M-mode is prolonged. Accurate recording and measurement of the propagation velocity require considerable expertise and are not used in all laboratories.

## Rate of Left Ventricular Relaxation (−dP/dt)

The rate of decline in velocity of the mitral regurgitant jet at end-systole reflects the rate of decrease in LV pressure in early diastole [\(Fig. 7.15](#page--1-65)). This allows measurement of negative *dP/dt* from the end-systolic segment of the mitral regurgitant jet, analogous to measurement of positive *dP/dt* from the initial segment of the jet (see Fig. 6.17). Unfortunately, the mitral regurgitant jet velocity is also affected by LA pressure, which often is elevated with mitral regurgitation independent of abnormalities in diastolic function. In addition, reproducibility of this

![](_page_11_Figure_13.jpeg)

**Fig. 7.14 Color Doppler M-mode propagation velocity.** Propagation velocity *(dashed line)* recorded with the color Doppler M-mode cursor positioned in the center of the mitral annulus in an apical four-chamber view. The slope of the Doppler flow as it moves from the annulus *(bottom of scale)* to the apex *(top of the scale)* reflects the rate of LV relaxation.

**Fig. 7.15 Early diastolic −dP/dt.** The time interval between 1 and 3 m/s on the mitral regurgitant velocity deceleration curve is used to calculate −*dP/dt* as Δt/32 mmHg.

![](_page_12_Figure_4.jpeg)

measurement is suboptimal because of poor signal strength in some patients and measurement of a short time interval, so it has not been widely accepted as a standard method for evaluation of diastolic dysfunction.

## LV and LA Myocardial Mechanics

Measures of LV strain and strain rate derived from tissue Doppler imaging or speckle tracking echocardiography (see Fig. 4.14) can be used to evaluate regional diastolic dysfunction. This approach may be helpful for the diagnosis of coronary disease, assessment of myocardial viability, and detection of interstitial fibrosis. Other potential measures of diastolic function that can be derived from tissue Doppler imaging include the time interval from *E*′ to *E* velocity, which reflects end-diastolic pressure and global myocardial deformation measures such as strain rate during isovolumetric relaxation (which is not affected by loading conditions). Tissue Doppler imaging and speckle tracking echocardiography also allow evaluation of rotation and twist of the LV in systole and of untwisting in diastole, although the clinical utility of this approach has not been established.

LA function can be assessed using tissue Doppler imaging or speckle tracking echocardiography. Indices that can be derived from these approaches include:

- Maximal strain during LV systole (LA reservoir function)
- Early diastolic strain (LA conduit function)
- Strain during LA systole (LA contractile function)

LA strain measures may be useful in the evaluation of patients with diastolic heart failure and in predicting persistence of sinus rhythm after cardioversion for atrial fibrillation. However, further study of these measures is needed before they can be recommended for routine clinical use.

## CONFOUNDING FACTORS

## Physiologic Factors

Evaluation of LV diastolic function is confounded by the normal variation in ventricular filling related to:

- Respiration
- Heart rate
- PR interval
- Age
- Preload

Pulmonary venous flow patterns also are affected by physiologic factors other than diastolic function, with the *systolic filling phase* most affected by:

- LA size
- LA pressure
- LA compliance
- Atrial contractile function

The velocity and duration of the *atrial reversal* is affected by:

- LA contraction
- LA compliance
- Cardiac rhythm

Despite the potential influence of all these factors on the pattern of LV diastolic filling, the Doppler velocity data still can provide useful information on diastolic dysfunction if they are carefully interpreted.

#### *Respiration, Heart Rate, and PR Interval*

A normal slight variation (<20%) in LV inflow velocities occurs with respiration. At higher heart rates, diastole is shorter—particularly the period of diastasis—so that the *A* velocity more closely succeeds the *E* velocity. When overlap of these two velocity curves occurs, the *A* velocity, in effect, is "added" to the *E*-velocity curve, resulting in a higher *A* velocity and a lower *E/A* ratio [\(Fig. 7.16\)](#page--1-66). Similarly, a longer PR interval results in an *A* velocity earlier in diastole that becomes superimposed on the *E*-velocity curve. At very high heart rates (short diastolic filling periods), the *E-* and *A*-velocity curves become merged into a single *E/A* velocity. Evaluation of a patient with heart block or an atrial arrhythmia often demonstrates this nicely, with the location of the *A* velocity relative to the *E* velocity affecting its magnitude accordingly [\(Fig. 7.17](#page--1-67)).

LA filling is affected by many of the same variables that affect LV diastolic filling. Higher heart rates result in merging of the systolic and diastolic phases of LA filling, whereas lower heart rates result in clearer separation between them.

![](_page_13_Figure_5.jpeg)

**Fig. 7.16 Effect of heart rate on E/A ratio.** Schematic diagram showing the overlap or "summation" of *A* velocity with *E* velocity that occurs with higher heart rates.

#### *Age*

In children and young adults, the majority of ventricular filling occurs in early diastole, with a prominent *E* velocity and only a small contribution to ventricular filling due to atrial contraction (20% of total LV volume). With age, the *E* velocity diminishes, and the atrial contribution becomes more prominent, with equalization of *E* and *A* velocities at approximately age 50 years and reversal of the *E/A* ratio after that age in normal individuals (Appendix A, Table A.5). Early diastolic deceleration time also is progressively prolonged, and a slight increase in isovolumic relaxation time occurs with age ([Fig. 7.18](#page--1-68)). Presumably the mechanism of the changes in LV filling patterns with age is a gradual reduction in the rate of early diastolic relaxation. Keeping in mind that *E* velocity and *E/A* ratio usually decrease with age, the finding of a "normal" LV filling pattern in an older patient should raise the question of abnormal ventricular compliance.

Changes in LA inflow with aging have been described, including a reduction in the diastolic filling phase, a compensatory increase in the systolic filling phase, and a more prominent atrial reversal in subjects older than age 50 years.

#### *Preload*

LA pressure and volume *preload* dramatically affect the pattern of LV filling ([Fig. 7.19\)](#page--1-69). Increased LA pressure results in an increase in the *E* velocity, a shortened isovolumic relaxation time, and steeper deceleration slope of early diastolic filling. As the LV fills rapidly in early diastole LV diastolic pressure rises, so atrial contraction results in only a small pressure gradient between the LA and the LV and a small *A* velocity. Examples of elevated preload include volume infusion or an elevated LA pressure due to elevation of LV end-diastolic pressure.

Situations with a reduced preload also affect diastolic filling parameters. Reduced LA pressures have

**Fig. 7.18 Aging changes in left ventricular and left atrial inflow patterns.** Schematic diagram showing the changes in LV *(top)* and LA inflow and pulmonary venous flow *(bottom)* patterns that occur with age. The typical pattern seen in younger (age 50 years) subjects *(pink)* is compared with middle-aged *(blue)* and older (age 70 years) subjects *(yellow)*. *A,* atrial; *D,* diastolic; *S,* systolic.

a reduced *E* velocity because of a smaller gradient between the LA and LV at mitral valve opening. Thus hypovolemia or use of a venodilator (e.g., nitroglycerin) results in a decrease in the *E* velocity, with a much smaller effect on *A* velocity. Preload is transiently decreased during the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver. Thus if the *E/A* ratio appears normal but preload is elevated, with the Valsalva maneuver the decrease in *E* velocity results in normalization or reversal of the *E/A* ratio. This response to the Valsalva maneuver may be used to separate a normal from a pseudo-normal pattern of diastolic filling and to distinguish reversible from irreversible severe diastolic dysfunction.

## Pathophysiology

Several pathophysiologic variables, other than LV diastolic function, that also affect the pattern of LV diastolic filling include:

![](_page_14_Figure_8.jpeg)

![](_page_14_Figure_9.jpeg)

**Fig. 7.19 Effect of preload on left ventricular filling patterns.** With increased preload, an increased pressure gradient from the LA to the LV at the time of mitral valve opening results in a higher *E* velocity. The *A* velocity remains the same or is reduced if a high end-diastolic pressure results in a smaller LA to LV pressure gradient following atrial contraction. The opposite changes occur with decreased preload.

- LV systolic function
- Mitral valve disease
- Cardiac rhythm and atrial contractile function

#### *LV Systolic Function*

LV systolic function affects the pattern of diastolic filling in that, for a given diastolic pressure-volume curve, an increased end-systolic volume results in a shift to a steeper portion of the pressure-volume curve. Diastolic filling then occurs with a greater increase in pressure for a given increase in volume. This results in an increased *E* velocity and reduced *A* velocity, similar to the pattern seen with decreased compliance due to a shift to a different diastolic pressure-volume curve (see [Fig. 7.4](#page--1-51)).

#### *Mitral Valve Disease*

The use of transmitral and pulmonary vein flow curve in assessment of LV diastolic function depends on the assumption that the mitral valve itself does not affect filling patterns. Obviously this assumption is invalid when mitral valve disease is present. Mitral valve area is the rate-limiting step for LV filling when mitral stenosis is present; Doppler echo cannot be used for evaluation of LV diastolic function if significant mitral stenosis is present. When more than mild mitral regurgitation is present, an increased initial pressure gradient is present when the valve opens and an increased volume flow rate across the mitral valve occurs in early diastole. Thus diastolic function cannot be accurately evaluated when significant mitral regurgitation is present [\(Fig. 7.20](#page--1-70)).

#### *Cardiac Rhythm and Atrial Contractile Function*

Evaluation of diastolic function is challenging except with normal sinus rhythm [\(Fig. 7.21\)](#page--1-71) because the E/A ratio is a key diagnostic measure. In addition, some patients with sinus rhythm on the electrocardiogram may have ineffective atrial contraction, resulting in a small or absence A velocity. In atrial fibrillation, diastolic filling time varies from beat to beat, and the LV inflow A velocity and pulmonary venous inflow atrial reversal are absent. In addition, because forward pulmonary vein flow in systole reflects atrial filling after atrial contraction, systolic pulmonary vein flow typically is blunted when atrial fibrillation is present, even in the absence of mitral regurgitation or LV diastolic dysfunction. Measures of LV diastolic function that indicate elevated filling pressures in the presence of atrial fibrillation, when averaged from several beats, include:

- Mitral deceleration time (DT) ≤160 ms
- Isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) ≤ 65 ms
- *E/E*′ ≥ 11

#### CLINICAL CLASSIFICATION OF DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION

In the clinical setting, evaluation of diastolic ventricular function is complicated by the coexistence of more than one of the factors that affect diastolic filling. For example, patients with reduced compliance often have an elevated preload. Thus an older adult patient with reduced compliance has a pattern of LV filling similar to a younger patient with normal diastolic function (a pattern referred to as *pseudo-normalization*). Conversely, a patient with impaired relaxation has coexisting mitral regurgitation, resulting in an increased *E/A* ratio due to the increased transmitral volume flow rate instead of the expected decrease in *E/A* ratio due to impaired relaxation. As these examples illustrate, sorting out the relative contribution of diastolic dysfunction from other physiologic parameters can be difficult in an individual patient. Furthermore, the factors that affect diastolic filling are not independent. A change in one physiologic parameter (e.g., LA pressure) affects other parameters (e.g., atrial compliance and LV contractility). However, from a practical point of view, the combination of transmitral flow, myocardial tissue velocity, and pulmonary venous inflow patterns allows a clinically useful classification of the type and severity of diastolic dysfunction [\(Table 7.4](#page--1-55)).

The clinical indications and optimal examination for diastolic dysfunction continue to evolve, so each laboratory needs to develop a protocol for when and how to evaluate diastolic function. My recommendation is that detailed evaluation of diastolic dysfunction be performed in patients referred for evaluation of heart failure symptoms, including dyspnea, particularly if LV systolic function is normal, and in patients with evidence of any of the conditions listed in [Table 7.1](#page--1-53) based on clinical or echocardiographic criteria [\(Fig. 7.22](#page--1-72)).

## Estimates of Diastolic Filling Pressures

In clinical practice, it can be difficult to separate the effects of changes in ventricular relaxation and compliance from changes due to elevated filling pressures. Nevertheless, these parameters are conceptually different. Although Doppler data are not accurate or precise enough to replace invasive pressure measurements in critically ill patients when treatment is being titrated based on hemodynamic parameters, several Doppler parameters are useful for identification of patients with elevated filling pressure, even when an

Only the yellow rows are included in the American Society of Echocardiography guidelines plus consideration of tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity. In the absence of other causes for elevated pulmonary pressures, a tricuspid regurgitant velocity greater than 2.8 m/s is consistent with moderate to severe LV diastolic dysfunction.

E/A with the Valsalva maneuver is <1.

\*See Table 7.4 for classification of diastolic dysfunction.

**Fig. 7.22 Practical approach to clinical evaluation of diastolic dysfunction.** When LV size, wall thickness, and ejection fraction *(EF)* are normal, further evaluation of diastolic function is needed only in the presence of LA enlargement or an abnormal *E/A* ratio for age. In patients with ventricular hypertrophy or dilation with a normal ejection fraction, diastolic function should be fully evaluated, particularly if clinical concern exists that diastolic dysfunction is the cause of symptoms. When ejection fraction is reduced, the first step is to evaluate for elevated filling pressures. If simple criteria for elevated filling pressures are not present, a more complete evaluation of diastolic function is appropriate. *DT,* Deceleration time; *IVRT,* isovolumic relaxation time; *LVH,* LV hypertrophy; *PVD,* peak diastolic velocity; *PVS,* peak systolic velocity.

exact numeric value cannot be provided (see Appendix B, Table B.5).

Doppler parameters that indicate an elevated LV filling pressure include a:

- Ratio of transmitral *E* velocity to the myocardial tissue *E*′ velocity *(E/E*′*)* >15
- Pulmonary vein atrial reversal velocity (PVa) >0.35 m/s
- Pulmonary atrial reversal duration (*a*dur) at least 20 ms > transmitral atrial flow duration (*A*dur)
- Pulmonary venous systolic flow less than diastolic flow (S < D)
- Ratio of the early to atrial transmitral velocity (*E/A* ratio) >2
- Deceleration time <140 ms

In clinical practice, several of these variables are considered in the examination of patients with suspected diastolic dysfunction, with the confounding factors of diastolic relaxation and compliance affecting the data in each patient. In patients with a low LV ejection fraction, an *E/E*′ ratio greater than 15 is a reasonably accurate indicator of elevated filing pressures. When LV systolic function is normal, a very low (≤8) or very high (>15) *E/E*′ ratio is diagnostic, but the additional parameters listed earlier should be considered when the *E/E*′ ratio is between 8 and 15. The diagnosis of elevated filling pressures is most secure when multiple parameters are congruent. Additional findings, such as LA enlargement and pulmonary hypertension, improve diagnostic reliability.

## Mild Diastolic Dysfunction

Mild diastolic dysfunction is characterized by impaired ventricular relaxation with a classic pattern of impaired early diastolic filling and an increased atrial contribution to total LV filling [\(Fig. 7.23](#page--1-73)). *Impaired relaxation* is associated with a:

- Reduced *E* velocity
- Longer early diastolic deceleration time (DT) (>200 ms)
- Tissue Doppler *E*′ velocity <10 cm/s
- Prolonged isovolumic relaxation time (≥100 ms)

If filling pressures are normal despite impaired relaxation, the *E/E*′ ratio is less than 8, and the pulmonary venous pattern is normal with a:

- Systolic phase greater than a diastolic phase
- Normal atrial reversal duration and velocity

If impaired relaxation is accompanied by elevated filling pressures, the LV inflow pattern will continue to show an *E/A* ratio less than 0.8 with a prolonged deceleration time. However, the ratio of early diastolic blood flow to tissue velocity *(E/E*′*)* now is elevated, the isovolumic relaxation time is in the normal range, and the pulmonary venous atrial reversal is prolonged in duration and increased in velocity. This pattern is consistent with mild to moderate diastolic dysfunction.

## Moderate Diastolic Dysfunction

Moderate diastolic dysfunction is characterized by abnormal compliance, often in addition to impaired

![](_page_18_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 7.23 Mild diastolic dysfunction.** In this patient with LV hypertrophy and decreased relaxation, the mitral inflow at the leaflet tips (*top*) shows an *E/A* <1 and a prolonged deceleration time. The myocardial tissue Doppler (*center*) confirms impaired relaxation with an *E*′*A*′ <1, indicating the mitral flow pattern is not related to loading conditions. The pulmonary venous inflow (*bottom*) shows relatively slightly greater systolic flow compared with diastolic flow and a normal atrial reversal velocity and duration *(PVa),* consistent with normal LV filling pressures. In addition, the E/E′ ratio is only 4.

relaxation. Abnormal ventricular compliance results in rapid early diastolic filling following mitral valve opening with a short isovolumic relaxation time and acceleration time. As the ventricle fills, LV diastolic pressure rises rapidly because of a stiff ventricle with decreased compliance, so a high *E* velocity is followed by a steep deceleration slope ([Fig. 7.24\)](#page--1-74). The atrial contribution to filling is relatively small because filling is now occurring on the steep portion of the pressurevolume relationship. In addition, LV end-diastolic pressure typically is elevated, so only a small LA to LV pressure gradient is present following atrial contraction. This pattern of ventricular filling often is referred to as "pseudo-normal" because the *E/A* ratio looks similar to normal even though diastolic dysfunction is present.

Moderate diastolic dysfunction, with a normal *E/A* ratio (pseudo-normal), is distinguished from normal ventricular filling by a:

- Low *E*′ velocity (<8 cm/s)
- Short, early diastolic deceleration time (150 to 200 ms)
- Tissue Doppler *E*′*/A*′ <1
- Ratio of *E to E*′ between 10 and 14
- Short isovolumic relaxation time (60 to 100 ms)
- Pulmonary venous diastolic velocity greater than systolic velocity

In addition, the pulmonary venous flow pattern shows a prominent diastolic phase with an increased velocity and duration of atrial flow reversal, thus confirming the diagnosis of moderate diastolic dysfunction. Although the *E/A* ratio is typically 0.8 to 2 at rest, with the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver (decreased preload), the *E* velocity decreases more than the *A* velocity, resulting in an *E/A* ratio less than 1.

## Severe Diastolic Dysfunction

With severe diastolic dysfunction, the progressive reduction in compliance and elevation of filling pressures results in a further increase in the *E* velocity and a decrease in the deceleration time. The myocardial tissue velocities decrease to less than 5 cm/s, and the ratio of *E/E*′ increases to 15 or greater. The isovolumic relaxation time becomes very short, and the pulmonary venous inflow pattern is dominated by diastolic flow. Atrial reversal is prominent as well, with an increased velocity and duration of atrial flow caused by a high LV diastolic pressure that reduces late diastolic LV filling so that atrial contraction results in reversal of flow in the pulmonary veins [\(Fig. 7.25\)](#page--1-75).

In summary, severe diastolic dysfunction with *reduced compliance* is associated with:

- Increased *E* velocity and *E/A* ratio
- Decreased deceleration time
- Low *E*′ velocity with an *E/E*′ ratio ≥15

![](_page_19_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 7.24 Moderate diastolic dysfunction.** In a patient with impaired compliance and an elevated LV end-diastolic pressure, the mitral inflow at the leaflet tips (*top*) shows an *E/A* >1 and a short deceleration time. The myocardial tissue Doppler (*center*) shows about equal *E*′ and *A*′ velocities, with an *E*′ <0.8 m/s, consistent with decreased compliance. The *E/E*′ ratio is slightly higher than 8. The pulmonary venous inflow (*bottom*) shows a relatively larger diastolic component than systolic component and an increased atrial reversal velocity *(PVa)* (approximately 0.40 m/s) and duration, consistent with elevated LV filling pressures.

![](_page_19_Figure_4.jpeg)

**Fig. 7.25 Severe diastolic dysfunction.** In this patient with heart failure and a low ejection fraction, the transmitral inflow shows a very high *E/A* ratio of 4 and a steep deceleration time (*top*). The myocardial tissue Doppler (*center*) shows a very low *E*′ velocity of 0.5 m/s and a very high *E/E*′ ratio of 32. The pulmonary venous inflow pattern *(bottom)* is suboptimal, but diastolic flow is seen with no systolic component and the atrial reversal velocity *(PVa)* is at the upper limits of normal (approximately 0.35 m/s) *(arrow),* with a duration slightly longer than the mitral *A* duration, also supporting the diagnosis of elevated LV filling pressures.

- Short isovolumic relaxation time
- Pulmonary venous diastolic flow greater than systolic flow
- Increased velocity and prolonged duration of pulmonary vein atrial reversal

Some classifications of diastolic dysfunction include another category of severe irreversible diastolic dysfunction characterized by the lack of a decrease in *E* velocity with the Valsalva maneuver, along with even more severe abnormalities in the other parameters of diastolic function. Examples of clinical patterns of diastolic dysfunction are shown in [Table 7.5.](#page--1-56)

#### RIGHT VENTRICULAR DIASTOLIC FUNCTION

#### Right Ventricular Filling

The pattern of RV diastolic filling is similar to LV diastolic filling, except that maximal velocities are lower (because the tricuspid annulus is larger), the diastolic filling period is slightly shorter, and greater normal respiratory variation in RV filling occurs ([Fig.](#page--1-76) [7.26\)](#page--1-76). Although few studies have addressed RV diastolic filling, the same measurements described for LV diastolic filling are applicable.

## Doppler Data Recording

On TTE, RV inflow can be recorded from the parasternal RV inflow view or from the apical four-chamber view. Pulsed Doppler is used with the same technical considerations that apply to recording LV inflow velocities. Evaluation of respiratory variation of inflow velocities is complicated by the respiratory motion of the heart, so care is needed to ensure a parallel intercept angle between the ultrasound beam and inflow stream throughout the respiratory cycle. This can be accomplished in most patients by using a window where 2D echo shows little respiratory variation in the image plane itself or in the Doppler beam orientation relative to the 2D image.

#### Physiologic Factors That Affect Right Ventricular Filling

RV filling appears to be affected by all the same physiologic parameters that affect LV filling. Again, the major differences between RV and LV filling are (1) timing, (2) reciprocal respiratory variation (as described earlier), and (3) absolute velocities, which are lower for RV inflow because the tricuspid annulus is larger than the mitral annulus.

#### Right Atrial Filling

Doppler velocity curves of RA filling can be recorded in the superior vena cava (from a suprasternal notch approach) or the central hepatic vein (from a subcostal approach) because these central veins empty directly into the RA without intervening venous valves. The pattern of RA filling recorded by Doppler parallels the jugular venous pressure curves seen clinically [\(Fig.](#page--1-77) [7.27\)](#page--1-77). However, the Doppler data represent a more reliable approach given that evaluation of jugular venous patterns is difficult in some patients because of body habitus and the fact that interpretation is subjective (with no recorded data).

Again, RA filling patterns show respiratory variation in normal individuals with augmentation of RA inflow during inspiration, as is seen in the RV inflow pattern. A plausible explanation for these observations is that the negative intrathoracic pressure with voluntary inspiration (but not with mechanical ventilation) results in an extrathoracic to intrathoracic pressure gradient from the great veins into the RA, thus leading to increased blood flow into the right side of the heart. RA pressure can be estimated by echocardiographic evaluation (from the subcostal window) of the inferior vena cava as blood flow enters the RA, as discussed in Chapter 6.

RA filling is most often evaluated from the subcostal window. After the long-axis view of the inferior vena cava is obtained, the transducer is rotated and angulated to visualize the central hepatic vein, which tends to be directed toward the transducer in this view, to allow a parallel intercept angle between the pulsed Doppler beam and hepatic vein flow. Hepatic vein flow is assumed to be representative of inferior vena caval flow because both enter into the RA without intervening venous valves. Direct study of inferior vena caval flow is limited by a nearly perpendicular intercept angle.

RA inflow also can be recorded in the superior vena cava from the suprasternal notch window. From the standard aortic arch view, the transducer is angulated toward the patient's right to visualize the superior vena cava adjacent and slightly anterior to the ascending aorta. The pulsed Doppler sample volume is positioned in the superior vena cava, with adjustment of transducer angle and sample volume depth to obtain a well-defined velocity curve. As for other inflow patterns, wall filters are minimized (as allowed by signal-to-noise ratio) to demonstrate the low-velocity flows associated with atrial filling.

From both the superior vena cava and hepatic vein recordings, it is important to distinguish respiratory variation in the Doppler curves due to (1) respiratory variation in the angle between the ultrasound beam and blood flow direction from (2) true variations in atrial filling volumes. The hepatic vein is small, so several positions often need to be tried

flow is recorded in the central hepatic vein showing systolic *(S)* and diastolic *(D)* antegrade filling, with slight flow reversal following atrial *(a)* contraction.

to find one that maintains the sample volume in the hepatic vein throughout the respiratory cycle.

The physiologic factors that affect LA filling also affect RA filling, although less attention has been focused on physiologic parameters affecting the right side of the heart. Respiratory variation in RA filling typically is much more prominent than the respiratory variation seen in LA filling. When a nonsinus cardiac rhythm is present, the lack of atrial contraction results in an absent atrial reversal; systolic forward flow (the filling phase following atrial emptying) may be blunted or reversed.

## ALTERNATE APPROACHES

Despite the numerous potential shortcomings of Doppler echocardiographic evaluation of diastolic filling, it has proven to be a repeatable, noninvasive, widely available method for the evaluation of diastolic function [\(Fig. 7.28](#page--1-78)). Techniques used in the research laboratory (e.g., time constant of relaxation, pressurevolume curves) rarely are applicable to clinical patient management. The other available clinical modalities for the evaluation of diastolic function include:

- Direct intracardiac pressure measurements
- Radionuclide high-resolution time-activity curves

■ Cardiac magnetic resonance tissue tracking methods

The roles of tissue Doppler or speckle tracking strain rate and strain measurements and other newer approaches for clinical evaluation of diastolic dysfunction are in evolution.

#### DIASTOLIC FUNCTION REPORTING

Essential data on diastolic dysfunction in the echocardiographic report includes key numeric measures as established by each laboratory protocol along with a plain language interpretation of the findings. Key information includes the presence or absence of evidence for diastolic dysfunction, the presence or absence of evidence for elevated filling pressures, the severity of diastolic dysfunction (mild, moderate, or severe), and concurrent factors that affect this diagnosis (e.g., age, heart rate, rhythm, mitral valve disease). Evaluation of diastolic dysfunction is complex, requiring integration with other echocardiographic and clinical data in each patient. Specific measures of diastolic function are most useful in an individual patient when comparing changes over time or in response to medical or interventional therapy.
