# TYPES OF ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC STUDIES

Cardiac ultrasound examinations now are performed in various practice settings by health care providers with differing types of clinical and imaging expertise. *Diagnostic echocardiography* is defined as an echocardiographic examination performed under the supervision of a cardiologist with expertise in echocardiography (Level 2 or 3 training) for the purposes of diagnosis, measurement of disease severity, evaluation of disease progression, or assessment of response to therapy. A diagnostic echocardiogram includes a formal interpretation in the medical record that meets American Society of Echocardiography quality standards and archiving of a complete set of diagnostic images. Diagnostic echocardiography typically is performed in the context of a medical center–based echocardiography service or outpatient cardiology practice with established technical standards, imaging protocols, and quality control measures [\(Table 5.1\)](#page--1-25). Diagnostic studies also may include contrast enhancement, 3D echocardiography, and strain imaging. In addition to transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TTE), additional diagnostic echocardiographic modalities used by cardiologists include exercise and pharmacologic stress echocardiography.

Cardiac ultrasound imaging also is used in other clinical settings by physicians with special expertise in areas other than echocardiography. For example, TEE to provide *procedural guidance* in the operating room and interventional suite usually is performed and simultaneously interpreted by cardiac anesthesiologists or cardiologists participating in the procedure (see Chapter 18). Intracardiac echocardiography may be used in conjunction with (or instead of) TEE imaging for procedural guidance in some situations (see Chapter 4). The results of monitoring studies are included in the procedure report, and selected images should be archived.

Focused cardiac ultrasound imaging often is performed in other clinical settings in which a rapid evaluation of basic cardiac function is needed for acute patient management. These *point of care cardiac ultrasound* (POCUS) studies typically are performed

by providers in the emergency department or intensive care unit as an integral component of clinical care. POCUS studies also are used for screening at risk populations, for example, in evaluation for structural heart disease in athletes or detection of rheumatic valve disease in endemic areas.

Appropriate education and training in cardiac ultrasound are needed by all providers performing cardiac ultrasound examinations. Each medical center also has procedures to ensure monitoring and quality improvement for all imaging studies.

# BASIC PRINCIPLES OF DIAGNOSTIC TESTING

# Reliability of a Diagnostic Test

The reliability of a diagnostic test includes two components: accuracy and precision. Accuracy is the ability of the test to make a correct numeric measurement (e.g., left ventricular [LV] volume) or to diagnose the presence or absence of a condition correctly (e.g., coronary artery disease). Precision reflects the agreement of repeated evaluations, including the acquisition, measurement, and interpretation of data. The combination of accuracy and precision determines the value of echocardiography in different clinical situations.

## *Accuracy*

The accuracy of a numeric measurement, such as wall thickness, aortic jet velocity, or aortic diameter, is expressed as the agreement between the echocardiographic measurement and a reference standard. These measurements reflect continuous variables; a continuous range of values is recognized from the smallest to largest seen in clinical practice. For example, aortic jet velocity ranges from <1 m/s to as high as 6 m/s. The numeric reference standard may be an anatomic measurement at surgery or autopsy, direct measurements in an experimental model, or comparison of echocardiography with other imaging techniques or hemodynamic recordings. Published data on the accuracy of echocardiography are shown in tables in each chapter of this book. More recent studies use an approach called Bland-Altman analysis, which compares the deviation of each measurement (echocardiography and the reference standard) with the mean of both measurements. Older validation studies typically report correlation coefficients and regression equations with standard errors for each measurement.

For echocardiographic diagnoses that are either present or absent (called categorical variables), accuracy reflects the certainty with which a specific diagnosis can be confirmed or excluded based on the test results [\(Fig. 5.1\)](#page--1-26). An example is echocardiography for the diagnosis of endocarditis: the patient either has or does not have endocarditis; no range of values exists. Accuracy for this type of test is described in terms of sensitivity and specificity. The sensitivity of a test is the degree to which it identifies all patients with the disease; specificity is the degree to which a test identifies all patients without the disease.

- Sensitivity = "True-positive" test results / All patients with the disease = TP / (TP + FN)
- Specificity = "True-negative" test results / All patients without the disease = TN / (TN + FP)

where TP is true positive, FN is false negative, TN is true negative, and FP is false positive.

Accuracy indicates the percentage of patients in whom the test results are correct in identifying the presence or absence of disease.

■ Accuracy = True positives + True negatives / Total number of tests = (TP + TN) / All tests

Using a diagnostic test to determine whether a disease is present or absent depends on the cutoff value or breakpoint used to define the test as abnormal. Sensitivity and specificity are related inversely to each other; in general, the higher the sensitivity, the lower is the specificity and vice versa. Whether a higher sensitivity is preferable to a higher specificity depends on the clinical question. If the goal of the test is identification of all patients with the disease, a high sensitivity is preferable. If the goal is confirmation of the diagnosis in an individual patient, a high specificity is preferable.

The relationship between sensitivity and specificity can be evaluated quantitatively for any given diagnostic test by graphing the sensitivity (*y*-axis) versus 1 − specificity (*x*-axis), with each point on the curve representing a different breakpoint defining the test as abnormal. The area under the curve reflects the clinical value of the test, with a larger area indicating a more reliable diagnostic test. The point on the receiver-operator curve where sensitivity and specificity are maximized indicates an appropriate breakpoint [\(Fig. 5.2](#page--1-27)).

## *Precision*

The reproducibility of echocardiographic imaging and Doppler data is affected by variability in:

- Recording
- Measurement
- Interpretation

In addition, variability can occur both when the same person repeats the data acquisition or measurement at a different time (intraobserver variability) and when data acquisition or measurement is performed by different people (interobserver variability). These sources of imprecision are major limitations of echocardiography in clinical practice. Several approaches to improving the precision, and thus reliability, of echocardiographic data are used. Appropriate training and experience help ensure correct acquisition of data, including correctly aligned image planes and Doppler recordings, optimization of instrument parameters, and standardized study protocols. Measurement precision is improved with adherence to published standards, quality control in each laboratory, and comparison with reference standards when possible. Interpretation variability is minimized by using standard terminology and diagnostic criteria, developing a consensus approach to reporting in each laboratory, and comparing images and Doppler data

**Fig. 5.2 Receiver-operator curve for a diagnostic test.** A receiver-operator curve is a graph of sensitivity (the percentage of positive test results that are true positives) versus 1 minus specificity (the percentage of positive test results that are false positives). Each point on the curve defined by a threshold value for the test result. If the test has no value in making a correct diagnosis, points would fall on the line of identity *(diagonal green line).* For a useful test, a curve can be drawn to the left of the line of identity; hypothetic curves for two different tests are shown by the *green* and *orange lines.* The area between each curve and the line of identity indicates the overall value of the test, with a larger area indicating a more useful test.

with previous recordings in that patient whenever possible; that is, the report should specify whether a change from previous studies has occurred based on direct comparison of the recorded data, with sideby-side measurements as needed. Measurement variability is reported in each chapter when this information is available.

## *Expertise*

The quality of an echocardiographic examination is highly dependent on the expertise of the sonographer performing the study, the physician interpreting the data, and the expertise of the laboratory. Optimal acquisition of image and Doppler data requires experience, in addition to education and training. A physician's interpretation is affected both by the data acquired (e.g., if images of a ventricular thrombus are not recorded, the physician will not see it) and by the education, training, and experience of that physician. Laboratory expertise affects data quality in terms of study protocols, time allocation and efficiency, instrumentation, and the group expertise of the sonographers and physicians. Thus, echocardiographic studies performed in different laboratories are not always comparable, and published studies on the accuracy of echocardiographic diagnosis may not apply to all diagnostic examinations.

#### Predictive Value

A major limitation of applying sensitivity and specificity data to an individual patient is the problem of whether a particular patient has a "true" or a "false" test result. Predictive values indicate the percentage of patients with a positive test result who have the suspected disease and the percentage with a negative test result who do not have the suspected disease:

- Positive predictive value = true positives divided by all positives
- Negative predictive value = true negatives divided by all negatives

However, predictive values are determined by the prevalence of disease in the population studied and also by the sensitivity and specificity of the test. Intuitively, this is obvious, comparing the use of echocardiography to "screen" healthy young subjects for endocarditis (many false-positive results because of ultrasound imaging artifacts) versus the same test in patients who have a new murmur, fever, and positive blood culture results, with a high prevalence of disease. The finding of a valvular vegetation on echocardiography in the latter group has a much higher predictive value for a diagnosis of endocarditis than in the healthy subjects, even though the sensitivity and specificity of echocardiography for diagnosing endocarditis are the same in both groups. Thus, the positive or negative predictive value of a test reflects disease prevalence as well as test accuracy.

#### Likelihood Ratio

The likelihood ratio indicates the relative likelihood of disease in an individual patient, based on a positive or negative test result. The likelihood ratio for a positive test result is calculated as:

or

+Likelihood ratio = 
$$\frac{\text{True} - \text{positive rate}}{\text{False} - \text{positive rate}}$$

A positive likelihood ratio >10 indicates an excellent test, and a ratio of 5 to 10 indicates a good test.

The likelihood ratio for a negative test result is calculated as:

$$-$$
Likelihood ratio =  $(1 - sensitivity)/specificity$ 

or

+Likelihood ratio = 
$$\frac{\text{False} - \text{negative rate}}{\text{True} - \text{negative rate}}$$

A negative likelihood ratio <0.1 indicates an excellent test, and a ratio of 0.1 to 0.2 indicates a reasonably good test.

For example, diagnosis of left ventricular (LV) thrombus by echocardiography, assuming a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 88%, has a positive likelihood of 7.9 (a good diagnostic test) and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.06 (an excellent diagnostic test). The positive likelihood is not excellent because ultrasound artifacts may be mistaken for a ventricular thrombus. The excellent negative likelihood depends on a high-quality echocardiographic study and the expertise of the sonographer to ensure that an apical thrombus is not missed by echocardiographic imaging.

#### Pre-test and Post-test Probability

Another approach to the use of sensitivity and specificity data in patient management is to consider relevant clinical data along with the test result (Fig. 5.3). The value of a diagnostic test increases when the pre-test likelihood of disease is integrated with the test results to derive a post-test likelihood of disease. This approach is known as Bayesian analysis. For example, the pre-test likelihood of severe aortic stenosis in an asymptomatic 30-year-old woman without a systolic murmur is very low. An echocardiogram purporting to show severe aortic stenosis most likely is an erroneous interpretation (a false-positive test result). In this setting, the result does not increase the post-test likelihood of disease very much. In contrast, in an elderly man with a 4/6 aortic stenosis murmur and symptoms of angina, syncope, and heart failure, the diagnosis of severe valvular aortic stenosis can be made with a high level of certainty even before any test is performed. The echocardiogram serves only to confirm the diagnosis and define the severity of obstruction. In general, diagnostic tests are most helpful when the pre-test likelihood of disease is intermediate so that the test result will substantially change the post-test likelihood of

The most comprehensive approach to the evaluation of a diagnostic test is clinical decision analysis. Clinical decision analysis incorporates several rigorous approaches to the problem of clinical prediction, with the method most applicable to a diagnostic test (e.g., echocardiography) being the threshold approach. The basic tenet of clinical decision analysis as applied to a diagnostic test is that the test results should have an impact on patient care by either:

- Prompting a change in therapy or
- Leading to a change in the subsequent diagnostic strategy in that patient

This basic assumption is formalized in the threshold model of decision analysis. In this approach, two

![](_page_5_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 5.3 Bayesian analysis.** The pre-test and post-test likelihoods of coronary artery disease in patients undergoing exercise echocardiography are shown for inducible ischemia (+echo) or a normal result (−echo). These curves were generated based on a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 82% of exercise echocardiography for diagnosis of significant (>70% luminal narrowing) coronary artery disease. In clinical practice, the pre-test likelihood is based on the patient's clinical history, age, and sex. The post-test likelihood then depends on the result of the exercise echocardiogram. For example, if the pre-test likelihood is 50%, an exercise echocardiogram showing inducible ischemia indicates an 83% likelihood of coronary disease, whereas a negative test indicates only a 15% likelihood of coronary disease.

disease probability thresholds are defined for the diagnostic test:

- A lower threshold below which the risk of the test is greater than the risk of not treating the patient and
- An upper threshold above which treating the patient is a lower risk than performing the test

The intermediate range—in which the risk of treating or not treating the patient is greater than the risk of the diagnostic test—is known as the testing zone [\(Fig. 5.4\)](#page--1-29). For any specific indication, the testing zone for echocardiography generally is wide because of the low risk and high accuracy of this technique. However, both an upper threshold and a lower threshold still are definable for echocardiography. The upper threshold is reached in situations in which the diagnosis is clear, and echocardiographic examination would only delay appropriate treatment. For example, a patient with a classic presentation of an ascending aortic dissection (chest pain, wide mediastinum, peripheral pulse loss) requires prompt surgery. Any delay caused by unnecessary diagnostic testing could result in additional morbidity or mortality.

It is tempting to assume that no lower end to the test zone for echocardiography exists, given the absence of known adverse biologic effects of this procedure. However, the risk of the test also includes the risks of additional diagnostic tests or even erroneous treatment choices resulting from a false-positive or falsenegative echocardiographic findings. For example, an

![](_page_5_Figure_10.jpeg)

**Fig. 5.4 Threshold approach to clinical decision making.** The risk of the diagnostic test—in this case, echocardiography—is shown by the *curved blue line* (*left y*-axis), with the risk of not treating the patient *(pt)* for the suspected disease shown by the *straight gray line* (*right y*-axis). The probability of disease based on the clinical presentation is shown from 0% to 100% on the *x*-axis. The lower threshold is the point at which the risk of not treating the patient is greater than the risk of echocardiography. The upper threshold is the point at which the risk of echocardiography (including false-negative results, delay in treatment) is greater than the risk of not treating the patient. The test zone is the pre-test likelihood of disease between these two thresholds.

echocardiogram is not indicated to evaluate for aortic dissection in a young patient with atypical chest pain and a normal physical examination, electrocardiogram, and chest radiograph. If a false-positive echocardiographic diagnosis leads to further evaluation with cardiac catheterization, any complications from the invasive procedure ultimately can be considered a consequence of the echocardiographic results. Thus, a lower limit to the test zone does exist for echocardiography and can be defined for each specific diagnostic indication by applying decision analysis techniques. Other clinical decision analysis approaches have been applied to specific clinical problems that use echocardiographic data as a branch point in the decision analysis tree.

#### **Cost-Effectiveness**

An additional consideration in medical practice is the cost-effectiveness of a diagnostic procedure. Note that this term includes not only the cost of the test (echocardiography compares favorably with other cardiac diagnostic tests) but also the effectiveness of the test—that is, test accuracy and its impact on patient management. This type of analysis has been applied to some echocardiographic diagnostic issues, but more widespread use of this approach is needed.

#### Clinical Outcomes

The most important measure of the value of a diagnostic test is its impact on subsequent clinical outcome (Fig. 5.5). Although the first step in evaluation of the clinical utility of a test includes various measures of diagnostic accuracy in comparison with some accepted standard, the more important assessment is whether the diagnostic test changes the subsequent diagnostic or therapeutic plan in each patient. The definitive value of echocardiography depends on its ability to predict prognosis, for example, survival in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, timing of valve surgery in patients with chronic regurgitation, or the rate of hemodynamic progression in patients

with valvular stenosis. Echocardiographic data are increasingly used in clinical outcome studies, as referenced in the suggested readings throughout this textbook.

# INDICATIONS AND APPROPRIATENESS CRITERIA

The indications for echocardiography are based on the reliability of this approach for diagnosis in a wide range of cardiovascular diseases and are summarized in consensus guidelines developed by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology. In addition, specific recommendations on the use of echocardiography often are included in disease-specific guidelines, for example, guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease and for heart failure.

Appropriateness criteria go beyond indications to consider the clinical setting in which a diagnostic test is appropriate. For example, exercise echocardiography is sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease, but it should not be used as a routine screening test in all patients. Appropriateness criteria have been developed by the American College of Cardiology in collaboration with other organizations that provide helpful guidance, although not all possible clinical situations are included. These criteria can be used to improve appropriateness of referrals for diagnostic imaging (Fig. 5.6).

Ideally, the echocardiogram request should indicate an appropriate clinical question (not "evaluate heart") based on the patient's symptoms or exam findings and, when possible, an estimate of the probability of the diagnosis in that patient. Next, the reliability of

Adherence to AUC and the subsequent impact on clinical outcomes warrant further study.

Impact clinical decision making to help achieve desired patient outcome

echocardiography for that diagnosis and the likelihood that the echocardiographic results will alter patient management are considered before performing the study. Often it is helpful to consider the specific branch point in the diagnostic and therapeutic plans that the echocardiographic results will be applied to in the clinical decision process.

With these considerations in mind, in certain situations the use of echocardiography clearly changes patient management. These situations include:

- Making the correct anatomic diagnosis. For example, differentiating a primary valvular problem from systolic LV dysfunction in a patient with heart failure symptoms.
- Providing important prognostic data in a patient with a known anatomic diagnosis. For example, LV ejection fraction in cardiomyopathy or severity of asymptomatic mitral regurgitation.
- Identifying complications of a known diagnosis. For example, paravalvular abscess in endocarditis or LV thrombus in cardiomyopathy.
- Assessing the effect of therapy. For example, reevaluation of LV systolic function after optimization of heart failure therapy.

Throughout this text, the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of echocardiography for each specific diagnosis will be indicated, if known. The clinician then should integrate these data with the pre-test likelihood of disease in each patient. Critical evaluations of the diagnostic utility of echocardiography in specific patient populations and clinical settings will be highlighted, including evaluation of chest pain in the emergency room (see Chapter 8), decision making in adults with aortic stenosis (see Chapter 11) and aortic regurgitation (see Chapter 12), the diagnosis and prognosis of endocarditis (see Chapter 14), and intraoperative assessment of mitral valve repair (see Chapter 18).

## INDICATIONS FOR DIAGNOSTIC ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY

# Transthoracic Echocardiography

Common clinical signs and symptoms in patients referred for echocardiography include an enlarged heart [\(Fig. 5.7\)](#page--1-32), a murmur on ausculation ([Fig. 5.8](#page--1-33)), chest pain [\(Fig. 5.9](#page--1-34)), heart failure [\(Fig. 5.10](#page--1-35)), and fever or bacteremia [\(Fig. 5.11\)](#page--1-36). When the echocardiographer evaluates a patient with one of these indications, it is important that the differential diagnosis be considered and each possibility excluded or confirmed during the course of the examination.

Echocardiography is appropriate in the acute setting when the likelihood of a cardiac cause is high and the imaging results would affect patient management, as shown in [Table 5.2.](#page--1-37)

**Fig. 5.8 Flow chart for the echocardiographic differential diagnosis of a murmur.** The flow chart is arranged by anatomy because the echocardiographer often is not provided information about the type of murmur or other clinical findings. The basic echocardiographic examination includes measurement of antegrade flows and evaluation for regurgitation of all four valves. Additional evaluation for murmur includes careful interrogation of flow in the pulmonary artery *(PA)* to detect a patent ductus arteriosus or increased flow because of an atrial septal defect *(ASD).* Flow in the septal region is examined with color and CW Doppler to exclude a ventricular septal defect *(VSD).* Normal physiologic amounts of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are not audible and do not explain the presence of a murmur. *PDA,* Patent ductus arteriosus; *T <sup>1</sup> 2 ,* pressure half-time; *Vmax,* maximum antegrade velocity.

**Fig. 5.9 Echocardiographic approach to evaluation of chest pain.** The primary goal in the acute setting is to exclude life-threatening conditions, such as an acute coronary syndrome or acute aortic dissection. With both acute and chronic chest pain, further diagnostic evaluation often is needed. *HCM,* Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

**Fig. 5.10 Echocardiographic approach to the patient referred for heart failure.** A systemic echocardiographic study will include the 2D views and Doppler flows to identify each of these possible diagnoses. In addition, the sonographer should mentally "check off" each of these conditions as the exam progresses to ensure that the entire differential diagnosis is considered. If the echocardiographic study result is normal, a noncardiac cause of symptoms is likely.

In patients with a known cardiac diagnosis, such as valvular heart disease [\(Table 5.3\)](#page--1-38), heart failure [\(Table 5.4](#page--1-39)), or aortic disease [\(Table 5.5\)](#page--1-40), periodic echocardiographic monitoring often is needed for decisions about medical therapy and timing of interventions. In these patients, the echocardiographer needs to be aware of the information that can be obtained by echocardiography, the limitations of echocardiography, and alternative diagnostic approaches.

## Transesophageal Echocardiography

The indications for TEE are based on its superior image quality compared with transthoracic imaging, particularly of posterior cardiac structures. In many cases, TEE echocardiography is performed after a complete transthoracic examination. However, in some clinical situations it is appropriate to begin with a TEE examination ([Table 5.6](#page--1-41)). Some echocardiographers

## TABLE 5.3 Appropriate Indications for Transthoracic Echocardiography in Patients With Valvular Heart Disease

#### **Valve Regurgitation**

- • Initial evaluation
- • Routine reevaluation of moderate or severe valve regurgitation (6-month to 1-year intervals)
- • Reevaluation for a change in clinical status

#### **Valve Stenosis**

- • Initial evaluation
- • Routine reevaluation of mild valve stenosis (typically 3-year intervals)
- • Routine reevaluation of moderate or severe valve stenosis (typically 1-year intervals)
- • Reevaluation for a change in clinical status

#### **Prosthetic Valves**

#### **Endocarditis**

- • Initial evaluation of suspected infective endocarditis (native or prosthetic valve) with positive blood cultures or a new murmur
- • Reevaluation of infective endocarditis in high-risk patients—virulent organism, severe hemodynamic lesion, aortic involvement, persistent bacteremia, a change in clinical status, or symptomatic deterioration

advocate the use of TEE imaging whenever transthoracic images are nondiagnostic. However, given that the threshold approach to clinical testing predicts a narrower test window as the risk of the test increases, it is appropriate to consider TEE studies somewhat more critically. The indications for a TEE study should be discussed with the referring physician on a caseby-case basis to determine whether the information potentially obtained justifies the slight but definite risk of the TEE approach.

Several definite indications for TEE are apparent when the limitations of transthoracic imaging are considered. The improved sensitivity of TEE versus transthoracic imaging for detection of paravalvular abscess in patients with endocarditis has been demonstrated convincingly (see Chapter 14). TEE clearly is indicated for the evaluation of prosthetic mitral valve dysfunction because the shadows and reverberations from the prosthetic valve no longer obscure the left atrium (LA) from this approach as they do on transthoracic imaging [\(Fig. 5.12](#page--1-42)) (see also Chapter

## TABLE 5.4 Appropriate Indications for Transthoracic Echocardiography in Patients With Hypertension, Heart Failure, and Cardiomyopathies

#### **Hypertension**

• Initial evaluation of suspected hypertensive heart disease

#### **Heart Failure**

- • Initial evaluation of known or suspected HF (systolic or diastolic)
- • Reevaluation of known HF with a change in clinical status or exam, without a clear precipitating factor, or to guide therapy
- • Pacer, ICD, and CRT devices—determine candidacy and device type, evaluate symptoms possibly caused by device complication or suboptimal device settings
- • Ventricular assist devices—determine candidacy, optimize settings, evaluate for complications
- • Monitor for rejection after heart transplantation
- • Evaluation of potential heart donor

#### **Cardiomyopathies**

- • Initial evaluation of known or suspected cardiomyopathy
- • Reevaluation of known cardiomyopathy with a change in clinical status to guide therapy
- • Screening evaluation in first-degree relatives of a patient with an inherited cardiomyopathy
- • Baseline and serial reevaluation in patients receiving cardiotoxic agents

*CRT,* Cardiac resynchronization therapy; *HF,* heart failure; *ICD,* implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.

**Fig. 5.12 Acoustic shadowing from a prosthetic mitral valve.** *(Left)* With TTE, the acoustic shadow obscures the LA, thus limiting assessment of valvular incompetence by Doppler techniques.

13). Abnormalities of the posterior aspect of a prosthetic aortic valve also are seen well with the TEE approach, although the anterior portion of the paravalvular region is shadowed by the posterior aspect of the prosthetic valve.

## TABLE 5.5 Additional Indications for Transthoracic Echocardiography

#### **Cardiac Masses**

- • Suspected cardiac mass
- • Suspected cardiovascular source of embolus

#### **Pericardial Disease**

- • Suspected pericardial disease
- • Reevaluation of known pericardial effusion to guide management
- • Guidance of percutaneous noncoronary cardiac procedures (e.g., pericardiocentesis, septal ablation, or RV biopsy)

#### **Aortic Disease**

- • Known or suspected connective tissue disorder or genetic condition associated with aortic dilation
- • Reevaluation of known ascending aortic dilation or history of aortic dissection to establish rate of expansion, when rate of change is excessive, or with a change in clinical status when findings may alter management or therapy

#### **Adult Congenital Heart Disease**

- • Initial evaluation of known or suspected adult congenital heart disease
- • Reevaluation to guide therapy or for a change in clinical symptoms or signs
- • Routine surveillance (≥1 year) following incomplete or palliative repair

Adapted from Douglas PS, Garcia MJ, Haines DE, et al: ACCF/ ASE/AHA/ASNC/HFSA/HRS/SCAI/SCCM/SCCT/SCMR 2011 appropriate use criteria for echocardiography, *J Am Coll Cardiol* 57:1126–1166, 2011 (see [Suggested Reading](#page--1-0)).

Improved evaluation of mitral valve anatomy and the degree of mitral regurgitation is especially useful in the perioperative evaluation of patients undergoing surgical mitral valve repair (see Chapter 18). In patients with congenital heart disease, TEE imaging improves diagnostic certainty, particularly in evaluation of posterior structures such as an interatrial baffle surgical repair or a sinus venosus atrial septal defect. The sensitivity of TEE echocardiography for detection of LA thrombus far exceeds that of transthoracic imaging. Finally, excellent images of the thoracic aorta, arch, and ascending aorta allow accurate diagnosis of aortic dissection by TEE. Other indications for TEE imaging include the evaluation for a patent foramen ovale in patients with a systemic embolic event and the exclusion of endocarditis when this diagnosis is a possibility.

# Stress Echocardiography

In many cardiac conditions, abnormalities of cardiac function are manifested only when increased oxygen consumption results in increased cardiac demands that cannot be met by the usual compensatory changes

## TABLE 5.6 Indications for Use of TEE as the Initial or Supplemental Test

- • Patients with a high likelihood of a nondiagnostic TTE because of patient-related characteristics or ability to visualize the structures of interest
- • Suspected acute aortic pathology including dissection or transection
- • Suspected endocarditis with a moderate or high pre-test probability (e.g., staphylococcal bacteremia, fungemia, prosthetic heart valve, or intracardiac device)
- • Evaluation of valve structure and function to evaluate suitability for surgical or transcatheter valve interventions
- • Guidance of percutaneous noncoronary cardiac interventions including but not limited to septal ablation, mitral valvuloplasty, PFO/ASD closure, radiofrequency ablation
- • Evaluation of patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter to facilitate clinical decision making with regard to anticoagulation and/or cardioversion and/or radiofrequency ablation
- • Evaluation for cardiac source of embolus with no identified source on TTE
- • Reevaluation for interval changes compared with prior TEE when a change in therapy is anticipated.
- • Suspected complications of endocarditis (e.g., abscess, fistula[\)\\*](#page--1-43)
- • Suspected prosthetic mitral valve dysfunction[\\*](#page--1-43)
- • Evaluation of posterior structure (e.g., atrial baffles) in patients with congenital heart diseas[e\\*](#page--1-43)

\*Not considered in the appropriateness guidelines document but generally accepted as appropriate indications for TEE as the initial approach.

*PFO/ASD,* Patent foramen ovale/atrial septal defect. Adapted from Douglas PS, Garcia MJ, Haines DE, et al: ACCF/ ASE/AHA/ASNC/HFSA/HRS/SCAI/SCCM/SCCT/SCMR 2011 appropriate use criteria for echocardiography, *J Am Coll Cardiol* 57:1126–1166, 2011 (see [Suggested Reading](#page--1-0)).

[\(Table 5.7\)](#page--1-38). This basic concept has led to the widespread use of stress testing in patients with cardiovascular disease. Increased cardiac demand can be induced by exercise or with appropriate pharmacologic interventions. The risk of this approach is related to the risk of stress testing with no significant additive effect of echocardiographic imaging.

Exercise echocardiography is performed by recording images of the LV immediately before and immediately after treadmill exercise or by recording images during supine or upright bicycle exercise. The most common indication for exercise echocardiography is suspected or known coronary artery disease. At rest, LV endocardial motion and wall thickening are normal, even if significant coronary disease is present, unless prior myocardial infarction has occurred. Increased myocardial oxygen demands (e.g., with exercise) result in ischemia when significant stenosis of an epicardial coronary artery is present. This results sequentially in myocardial metabolic changes, decreased wall thickening and endocardial motion, electrocardiographic changes, and angina. Echocardiographic

## TABLE 5.7 Appropriate Indications for Exercise or Pharmacologic Stress Echocardiography[\\*](#page--1-44)

#### **Low Pre-test Probability of CAD (10-Year Risk <10%) With:**

- • Angina or equivalent and an uninterruptable ECG or inability to exercise
- • New-onset heart failure or LV dysfunction and no plans for coronary angiography
- • Stress test–induced arrhythmias including sustained and nonsustained VT or frequent PVCs

#### **Intermediate (10-Year Risk 10%-20%) to High (10-Year Risk >20%) Probability of CAD With:**

- • Angina or equivalent
- • Acute chest pain without diagnostic ECG changes or elevated cardiac enzymes
- • New-onset atrial fibrillation

## **Prior Abnormal Test Results**

- • Abnormal catheterization or stress study with worsening symptoms on medical therapy
- • Coronary calcium score (Agatston) ≥400
- • Coronary stenosis of unclear significance by invasive or CT angiography

#### **Risk Assessment**

- • Before noncardiac surgery with at least one cardiac risk factor and poor exercise tolerance (<4 METs)
- • Following acute coronary syndrome when early catheterization not planned
- • Recurrent chest pain late after coronary revascularization
- • Incomplete revascularization after coronary intervention

#### **Other**

- • Assessment of myocardial viability with known CAD eligible for revascularization
- • Evaluation of low output aortic stenosis (dobutamine stress only)
- • Symptomatic patients with moderate mitral stenosis at rest
- • Asymptomatic moderate to severe mitral regurgitation with LV size not meeting surgical criteria
- • Contrast is appropriate when one or more contiguous segments are not seen on noncontrast images.

\*The stress modality is exercise, unless the patient is unable to exercise.

*CAD,* Coronary artery disease; *CT,* computed tomography; *ECG,* electrocardiogram; *MET,* metabolic equivalent; *PVCs,* premature ventricular contractions; *VT,* ventricular tachycardia. Adapted from Douglas PS, Garcia MJ, Haines DE, et al: ACCF/ ASE/AHA/ASNC/HFSA/HRS/SCAI/SCCM/SCCT/SCMR 2011 appropriate use criteria for echocardiography, *J Am Coll Cardiol* 57:1126–1166, 2011 (see [Suggested Reading](#page--1-0)).

images recorded during ischemia show abnormalities of wall motion, thus allowing for the detection of significant coronary artery disease. The specific coronary arteries involved can be identified by the anatomic pattern of induced wall motion abnormalities. Exercise echocardiography, as discussed in detail in Chapter 8, has been found to be more sensitive than exercise electrocardiography (and as sensitive as nuclear perfusion imaging) for detection of significant coronary artery disease. Exercise echocardiography is particularly helpful in patients with an abnormal resting electrocardiogram (e.g., bundle branch block or LV hypertrophy). It also has been used to assess the extent of disease, to document functional improvement after revascularization, and to detect restenosis after angioplasty.

In addition to changes in segmental wall motion with exercise stress testing, parameters of global ventricular function, including ventricular volumes, ejection fraction, and the Doppler LV ejection velocity curve, can be evaluated. Other Doppler parameters are helpful in specific settings. For example, a patient with mitral stenosis will show an excessive rise in pulmonary artery systolic pressure (estimated from the tricuspid regurgitant jet) with exercise. In a patient with aortic coarctation, the increase in gradient across the coarctation with exercise can be demonstrated with Doppler recordings.

Pharmacologic stress echocardiography replaces exercise testing when the patient is unable to exercise (e.g., peripheral vascular disease, musculoskeletal limitation). In addition, pharmacologic stress testing allows monitoring by echocardiography as the dose is increased and permits evaluation at sequential stress levels. Pharmacologic stress testing most often is performed using a beta-agonist, such as dobutamine, which increases myocardial contractility, myocardial oxygen demands, and the degree of peripheral vasodilation. An alternate pharmacologic agent is adenosine, which vasodilates coronary vessels, thus resulting in relative inequalities in blood flow between myocardium supplied by normal coronary arteries and myocardium supplied by stenosed coronary arteries.

## POINT OF CARE CARDIAC ULTRASOUND STUDIES

## Instrumentation

The term *point of care cardiac ultrasound* (POCUS) refers to the bedside use of small, lightweight ultrasound systems. Some of these systems are very small ("pocketsize") and have only limited capabilities, whereas others have nearly all the features of a standard ultrasound system and are still easily carried in one hand ([Table 5.8](#page--1-40)).

# Applications

Small, relatively inexpensive, portable or handheld echocardiography instruments are of great clinical utility in the emergency department, intensive care

unit, and other clinical settings for triage of acutely ill patients. POCUS allows for rapid diagnosis of:

- Pericardial effusion
- Overall LV and RV systolic function
- Segmental wall motion abnormalities

For example, a point of care study showing a dilated, hypokinetic LV in a patient with shortness of breath supports a diagnosis of heart failure, not pulmonary disease. POCUS also is useful in patients with chest pain and a nondiagnostic electrocardiogram; for this situation, an akinetic anterior wall indicates coronary disease, whereas a pericardial effusion suggests pericarditis. Another example is the hypotensive patient; severe global LV hypokinesis indicates heart failure, whereas a small hyperdynamic LV suggests an alternate diagnosis, such as septic shock [\(Fig. 5.13](#page--1-45)).

POCUS also may identify the *presence* of valve disease based on visualization of aortic valve calcification on 2D imaging or mitral regurgitation on color flow imaging. However, in general, evaluation of valve disease, diastolic function, suspected aortic dissection, and congenital heart disease requires a full echocardiographic examination with a standard ultrasound system.

In addition, POCUS is a useful tool for patient triage, for screening populations at risk of heart disease, and in medical education ([Table 5.9](#page--1-46)). As these devices become more widely available, with better image quality and lower cost, we can expect that POCUS will become a routine part of bedside diagnosis.

## Providers

Point of care cardiac imaging typically is performed by health care providers with limited ultrasound training who perform a quick study to answer a specific clinical question. Diagnostic accuracy is highest for major findings such as the presence or absence of a pericardial effusion or the presence or absence of LV systolic dysfunction. Accuracy is lower for more

**Fig. 5.14 Dimensions of care framework for evaluating quality of cardiovascular imaging.** The quality of an imaging study depends on multiple processes, as well as appropriately educated and trained sonographers and physicians and high-quality imaging systems. The value of clinical imaging depends on appropriate patient selection, optimal image acquisition, correct interpretation, and clear communication of results.

## TABLE 5.9 Point of Care Cardiac Ultrasound: Typical Indications

Urgent clinical evaluation (emergency department or intensive care unit)

- • LV size (volume status) and systolic function
- • RV size and systolic function
- • Pericardial effusion or tamponade

Screening at risk populations (e.g., athletes, rheumatic heart disease)

Frequent serial exams for known abnormality (e.g., response to heart failure therapy)

complex diagnoses such as regional wall motion or valvular heart disease. Recommendations for training have been published by the American Society of Echocardiography and other groups. However, as the use of ultrasound imaging is disseminated further and instrumentation improves, each medical center or practice group will need to establish standards for training and competency, study documentation, scope of practice, and continuous quality improvement.

# Safety and Limitations

The greatest limitation of these instruments is a missed diagnosis due to an inexperienced operator or suboptimal image quality. When handheld images suggest a new cardiac diagnosis or when diagnostic images cannot be obtained, it may be prudent to obtain a complete echocardiographic examination. Most handheld systems provide only limited recording capacity, so accurate reporting in the clinical notes, similar to reporting of physical examination findings, is essential. Quality assurance and improvement are important for POCUS as for any type of ultrasound imaging.

# QUALITY ASSURANCE IN ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY

Several steps should be taken to ensuring that highquality echocardiographic studies are provided to our patients [\(Fig. 5.14\)](#page--1-47). These include documentation of sonographer and physician competency, appropriate laboratory standards and procedures, and continuous quality improvement measures. Documentation of competency typically is based on:

- Accreditation—endorsement of a training program or laboratory by a recognized national accreditation agency
- Certification—documentation of appropriate training and successful completion of an examination in the area of expertise by each physician and sonographer

■ Credentialing—standards set by each health care organization for health care professionals providing patient care at that institution

In addition, innovative approaches to quality assurance based on statistical analysis of physician or laboratory performance have been proposed. Statistical database approaches will be increasingly useful as medical record systems are computerized.

# Sonographer Education and Training

The sonographer must be familiar with patterns of disease in clinical cardiology and also with the technical aspects of performing the examination. A sonographer's education and training include a knowledge base of cardiac anatomy and physiology, cardiac pathology, and clinical cardiology, in addition to ultrasound physics and the echocardiographic examination. Training also includes patient interaction skills, basic medical procedures (e.g., sterile technique), patient privacy, and so forth.

Guidelines for the education and training of cardiac sonographers have been published by the American Society of Echocardiography and are periodically updated. Education and training in an accredited program are recommended with accreditation for cardiac sonographer programs provided by two Joint Review Commissions (JRCs) under the auspices of the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Educational Programs (CAAHEP), the JRC-Diagnostic Medical Sonography (JRC-DMS), and the JRC-Cardiovascular Technology (JRC-CVT). Education and training include the acquisition of both cognitive and technical skills with demonstration of competency in each area. After completion of training, sonographers can be credentialed by the American Registry of Diagnostic Medical Sonographers (ARDMS), with separate examinations for adult and pediatric echocardiography, or they can be accredited by Cardiovascular Credentialing International (CCI). Cardiac sonographers must attend formal continuing medical education meetings to maintain these credentials.

# Physician Education and Training

The physician must have expertise in the technical aspects of the examination, in addition to the expected findings in each disease state, to guide the sonographer in optimizing data quality and to interpret the recorded data correctly. Details such as transducer frequency, gain controls, processing curves, and depth settings significantly affect image quality. The appropriate choice of Doppler modality for the flow of interest pulsed, color flow, or continuous-wave (CW) Doppler affects the data obtained. Factors such as wall filters, gain, sample volume size, and color sector width also significantly affect data collection. Knowledge of how these factors affect data quality and knowledge of which views and approaches yield optimal data allow the physician to assess the reliability of recorded data, to suspect abnormalities that may not have been noted explicitly during the examination, to recognize imaging and flow artifacts, and to direct the sonographer in optimal data acquisition.

Physician education and training in echocardiography most often take place during Cardiology Fellowship Training in a program accredited by the American Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). In addition, specific recommendations for training in echocardiography have been published, and are periodically updated, by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA). These recommendations divide training into three levels of expertise:

Level 1: Basic introduction to echocardiography needed by all cardiologists

Level 2: Qualified to independently interpret echocardiographic studies

Level 3: Additional qualifications to supervise an echocardiography laboratory

It is recommended that Level 2 training in TTE be achieved before training is undertaken in advanced procedures, including TEE and stress echocardiography. Recommended numbers of procedures during training are indicated in [Table 5.10](#page--1-38).

Most physicians completing a 3- or 4-year program in cardiology will have achieved Level 2 training. Successful completion of the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) examination in Cardiovascular Disease, in conjunction with at least Level 2 training as documented by the program director, provides verification of competence in TTE.

Other physicians achieve competency in echocardiography based on the same training guidelines recommended for cardiology trainees. Physicians who receive echocardiography training outside of Cardiology Fellowship programs have the option of taking the examination provided by the National Board of Echocardiography (NBE) to document competency. In addition, specific guidelines for training of cardiovascular anesthesiologists in echocardiography have been published by the American Society of Echocardiography with a focus on expertise in TEE and intraoperative echocardiography. The NBE offers a special examination for cardiovascular anesthesiology.

To maintain competency in echocardiography, physicians should document continuing medical education and should interpret a minimum of 300 studies per year for Level 2 and 500 studies per year for Level 3, with performance of some studies recommended. For maintaining competency in TEE echocardiography, 25 to 50 studies should be performed and interpreted annually, with 100 studies per year recommended for stress echocardiography.

# Echocardiography Reporting

It is essential that sonographers relay technical concerns to the physician and direct attention to abnormalities noted during the examination. Conversely, the physician should give feedback to the sonographer about the completeness and quality of data recorded and offer suggestions for future patient studies. The physician review also should indicate whether additional echocardiographic recordings are needed, either before the patient leaves the laboratory or at a later examination.

The echocardiographic report serves at least two purposes: (1) it conveys the results of the test to the referring physician, and (2) it serves as a narrative summary of the echocardiographic examination for comparison with future studies. Given the wide variety of views and flows that can be recorded, it is helpful for the report to document the structures imaged (even if normal), the flow signals recorded, the different Doppler modalities used, and the overall quality of the study. Any areas of limitation in the study are noted.

In each patient, the various echocardiographic findings then are integrated with each other in the final interpretation. For example, a report describing mitral regurgitation also would include a clear description of valve anatomy with an indication of the most likely cause of regurgitation or the differential diagnosis if the cause were unclear. Mitral regurgitant severity is estimated, and the methods used to generate this estimate are indicated. In addition, the degrees of LA and LV dilation are described, with attention to serial changes if previous studies are available. LV systolic function is quantitated, and the degree of pulmonary hypertension is estimated. All these findings fit together physiologically and thus can be reported in a logical integration of the data. For example, significant mitral regurgitation results in LV and LA enlargement because of volume overload, whereas the chronically elevated LA pressure leads to pulmonary hypertension.

Finally, these findings are reviewed in the context of the patient's clinical presentation, potential implications of the findings are discussed with the referring physician, and additional diagnostic tests or follow-up studies are recommended as clinically indicated. If principles of clinical decision analysis are being used in patient management, the pre-test and post-test likelihood of disease can be estimated. Ideally, the overall impact of the echocardiographic findings on the patient's therapy or subsequent diagnostic evaluation is reviewed with the referring physician both before and after the examination. Specific comments about timing of periodic echocardiography or consideration of referral to a cardiologist also may be appropriate. Of course, any unexpected or serious findings should promptly be relayed to the referring physician. In some cases, the echocardiography attending physician may need to assume immediate care of the patient, for example, if results indicate persistent abnormalities after stress testing or with the unexpected finding of an aortic dissection.

through the Intersocietal Commission for the Accreditation of Echocardiography Laboratories (ICAEL, <http://www.intersocietal.org/echo/>). This accreditation process reviews all aspects of the echocardiographic examination, including:

- Physician training and experience
- Sonographer training and experience
- Continuing medical education of physicians and sonographers
- Physical facilities (e.g., instruments, exam area)

- Echocardiography performance
- Laboratory procedures and protocols
- Echocardiographic reporting and data storage
- Quality assurance measures

The detailed recommendations of the ICAEL provide a useful starting point for laboratory policies and procedures that then can be modified as needed for each institution. The recommendations also include the essential components of TTE, TEE, and stress echocardiography examinations.
