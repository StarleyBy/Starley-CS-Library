The pericardium consists of two serous surfaces surrounding a closed, complex, saclike potential space. The visceral pericardium is continuous with the epicardial surface of the heart. The parietal pericardium is a dense but thin fibrous structure that is apposed to the pleural surfaces laterally and blends with the central tendon of the diaphragm inferiorly. Around the right and left ventricles (RV and LV) and the ventricular apex, the pericardial space is a simple ellipsoid structure conforming to the shape of the ventricles. Around the systemic and pulmonary venous inflows and around the great vessels, the parietal and visceral pericardia meet to close the "ends" of the sac—these areas often are referred to as *pericardial reflections.* The pericardial space encloses the right atrium (RA) and RA appendage anteriorly and laterally, with pericardial reflections around the superior and inferior vena cavae near their junction with the RA. Superiorly, the pericardium extends a short distance along the great vessels, with a small "pocket" of pericardium surrounding the great arteries posteriorly—the *transverse sinus.* The pericardial space extends laterally to the left atrium (LA), and a blind pocket of the pericardium extends posteriorly to the LA, between the four pulmonary veins—the *oblique sinus* ([Fig. 10.1\)](#page--1-29). The pericardial space normally contains a small amount (5 to 10 mL) of fluid that is detectable by echocardiography.

Anatomically, the pericardium isolates the heart from the rest of the mediastinum and from the lungs and pleural space, by serving as a barrier to infection and reducing friction with surrounding structures during contraction, rotation, and translation of the heart. In addition, the semirigid enclosure provided by the pericardium affects the pressure distribution to the cardiac chambers and mediates the interaction between RV and LV diastolic filling. The importance of the pericardium is most evident when it is affected by disease processes such as inflammation, thickening, or fluid accumulation.

# <span id="page-0-2"></span>Basic Principles

Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium, and it can be due to a wide variety of causes, including bacterial or viral infection, trauma, uremia, and transmural myocardial infarction ([Table 10.1\)](#page--1-30). Clinically, the diagnosis of pericarditis is based on at least two of the four characteristic features:

- Typical chest pain
- Widespread ST elevation or PR depression on electrocardiography

**Fig. 10.1 Pericardial anatomy.** The posterior wall of the pericardial sac after the heart has been removed by severing its continuity with the great arteries and veins and by cutting the two pericardial sleeves that surround the arteries and veins. *Arrows* indicate the transverse and oblique sinuses of the pericardium. *(From Netter FH:* Atlas of Human Anatomy, *Basel, Switzerland, 1989, Ciba-Geigy.)*

- Pericardial rub on auscultation
- New or increasing pericardial effusion

Although it is probable that most patients with pericarditis have a pericardial effusion at some point in the disease course, a pericardial effusion is not a necessary criterion for a diagnosis of pericarditis, nor does the presence of an effusion indicate a diagnosis of pericarditis. Interestingly, no correlation exists between the size of the pericardial effusion and the presence or absence of a pericardial "rub" on cardiac auscultation.

# Echocardiographic Approach

In a patient with suspected pericarditis, the echocardiogram may show a pericardial effusion of any size or pericardial thickening with or without an effusion, or it may be entirely normal. A pericardial effusion is recognized as an echolucent space around the heart [\(Fig. 10.2](#page--1-31)).

*Pericardial thickening* is evidenced by increased echogenicity of the pericardium on two-dimensional (2D) imaging and as multiple parallel reflections posterior to the LV on M-mode recordings [\(Fig. 10.3\)](#page--1-32). However, because the pericardium typically is the most echogenic structure in the image, it can be difficult to distinguish normal from thickened pericardium, and other imaging approaches, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (CMR), are more sensitive for this diagnosis.

Examination from several windows is needed when pericarditis is suspected because effusion or thickening can be localized and thus seen in only certain tomographic views. If a pericardial effusion is present, the possibility of tamponade physiology should be considered. If pericardial thickening is present, examination for evidence of constrictive physiology should be considered.

# Clinical Utility

Pericarditis is a clinical diagnosis that cannot be made independently by echocardiography. The goal of the echocardiographic examination is to evaluate for pericardial effusion or thickening and to evaluate for tamponade physiology [\(Table 10.2\)](#page--1-33).

**Fig. 10.2 Pericardial effusion on echocardiography.** Parasternal long- and short-axis views of a moderate circumferential pericardial effusion *(PE).* In the long-axis view (A) and short-axis view (B), the effusion tracks appear anterior to the descending aorta *(DA)* with a small amount of fluid posterior to the LA in the oblique sinus. Pericardial fluid in the transverse sinus (posterior to the aorta *[Ao]*) delineates the right pulmonary artery *(arrow),* which is not usually seen in this view in adults. Pericardial fluid anterior to the RV is seen in both the long- and short-axis views.

#### PERICARDIAL EFFUSION

### Basic Principles

A wide variety of disease processes can result in a pericardial effusion with a differential diagnosis similar to that for pericarditis (see [Table 10.1](#page--1-30)). The physiologic consequences of fluid in the pericardial space depend both on the volume and the rate of fluid accumulation. A slowly expanding pericardial effusion can become quite large (>1000 mL) with little increase in pericardial pressure, whereas rapid accumulation of even a small volume of fluid (50 to 100 mL) can lead to a marked increase in pericardial pressure ([Fig. 10.4](#page--1-34)).

*Tamponade physiology* occurs when the pressure in the pericardium exceeds the pressure in the cardiac chambers, thus resulting in impaired cardiac filling [\(Fig. 10.5\)](#page--1-35). As pericardial pressure increases, filling of each cardiac chamber is sequentially impaired, with lower-pressure chambers (atria) affected before higher-pressure chambers (ventricles). The compressive effect of the pericardial fluid is seen most clearly in the phase of the cardiac cycle when pressure is lowest in that chamber—systole for the atrium, diastole for the ventricles. Filling pressures become elevated as a compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output. In fully developed tamponade, diastolic pressures in all four cardiac chambers are equal (and elevated) because of exposure of the entire heart to the elevated pericardial pressure.

**Fig. 10.4 Pericardial pressure versus pericardial volume.** The graph shows an acute effusion (*blue line,* with a steep pressure-volume relationship) and a chronic effusion (*yellow line,* where large volumes lead to only mild pressure elevation).

Clinically, tamponade physiology manifests as low cardiac output symptoms, hypotension, and tachycardia. Jugular venous pressure is elevated and pulsus paradoxus (an inspiratory decline >10 mmHg in systemic blood pressure) is present on physical examination. The clinical finding of pulsus paradoxus is closely related to the echo findings of reciprocal respiratory changes in RV and LV filling and emptying.

# **Diagnosis of Pericardial Effusion**

The sensitivity and specificity of echocardiography for detection of a pericardial effusion are very high (Table 10.3). Diagnosis continues to rely on 2D transthoracic echocardiographic imaging from multiple acoustic windows; transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) sometimes is helpful with loculated posterior effusions. Three-dimensional (3D) imaging is not needed routinely but occasionally is helpful in the diagnosis of loculated effusions or hematomas.

![](_page_4_Figure_4.jpeg)

Fig. 10.5 Relationships among pericardial pressure, right atrial pressure, mean arterial pressure, and cardiac output. Note that when pericardial pressure (PP) exceeds RA pressure (RAP), blood pressure (mean arterial pressure [MAP]) and cardiac output (CO) fall. When RV pressure is exceeded (at the arrow), cardiac output and mean arterial pressure fall further.

#### Diffuse Effusion

A pericardial effusion is recognized as an echolucent space adjacent to the cardiac structures. In the absence of prior pericardial disease or surgery, pericardial effusions usually are diffuse and symmetric with clear separation between the parietal and visceral pericardium (Fig. 10.6). A relatively echogenic area anteriorly, in the absence of a posterior effusion, most likely represents a pericardial fat pad. M-mode recordings are helpful, especially with a small effusion, showing the flat posterior pericardial echo reflection and the moving epicardial echo with separation between the two in both systole and diastole.

In the apical views, the lateral, medial, and apical extent of the effusion can be appreciated. In the apical four-chamber view, an isolated echo-free space superior to the RA most likely represents pleural fluid. The subcostal view demonstrates fluid between the diaphragm and RV and is particularly helpful in echo-guided pericardiocentesis.

The size of the pericardial effusion is considered to be small when the separation between the heart and the parietal pericardium is <0.5 cm, moderate when it is 0.5 to 2 cm, and large when it is >2 cm. More quantitative measures of the size of the pericardial effusion rarely are needed in the clinical setting.

In patients with recurrent or long-standing pericardial disease, fibrinous stranding within the fluid and on the epicardial surface of the heart often is seen. When a malignant effusion is suspected, it is difficult to distinguish this nonspecific finding from

metastatic disease. Features suggesting the latter include a nodular appearance, evidence of extension into the myocardium, and the appropriate clinical setting [\(Fig. 10.7](#page--1-38)).

# *Loculated Effusion*

After surgical or percutaneous procedures, or in patients with recurrent pericardial disease, pericardial fluid often is *loculated* [\(Fig. 10.8](#page--1-39)). In this situation, the effusion is localized by adhesions to a small area of the pericardial space or consists of several separate areas of pericardial effusion, separated by adhesions. Recognition of a loculated effusion is especially important because hemodynamic compromise can occur with even a small, strategically located fluid collection. In addition, drainage of a loculated effusion is not always possible from a percutaneous approach.

#### *Distinguishing From Pleural Fluid*

To exclude the possibility of a loculated pericardial effusion reliably, echocardiographic evaluation requires examination from multiple acoustic windows. The

**Fig. 10.7 Malignant pericardial effusion.** Apical four-chamber view in a patient with metastatic lymphoma shows both a pericardial effusion lateral to the LV and pleural fluid.

mistaken for pericardial fluid. In fact, these structures can help in distinguishing pericardial from pleural fluid because a left pleural effusion extends posterolaterally to the descending aorta, whereas a pericardial effusion tracks anterior to the descending aorta ([Fig.](#page--1-40) [10.9\)](#page--1-40). When a large left pleural effusion is present, sometimes cardiac images can be obtained with the transducer on the patient's back ([Fig. 10.10\)](#page--1-41).

# Clinical Utility

Echocardiography is very sensitive for the diagnosis of pericardial effusion, even when loculated, if care is taken to examine the heart in multiple tomographic planes from multiple acoustic windows. Loculated effusions can be difficult to assess in certain locations, particularly if they are localized to the atrial region, because the effusion itself may be mistaken for a normal cardiac chamber. TEE imaging better detects and defines the extent of loculated effusions after cardiac surgery, especially when the effusions are located posteriorly ([Fig. 10.11\)](#page--1-42).

Pericardial adipose tissue is common, especially anterior to the RV, and sometimes is mistaken for an effusion. Unlike pericardial fluid, adipose tissue exhibits a fine pattern of echogenicity, which helps with identification of this normal finding. A pericardial cyst is an uncommon congenital fluid filled sac, usually adjacent to the right heart. Pericardial cysts usually are missed on echocardiography and are better evaluated by chest CT or CMR. However, when present, they may be mistaken for a pericardial or pleural effusion (see [Fig. 10.2](#page--1-31)).

The cause of the pericardial effusion is not always evident on echocardiographic examination. Irregular

![](_page_7_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 10.10 Large pleural effusion.** In a view with the transducer moved laterally from the apical position *(top),* a large left pleural effusion is seen. This can be distinguished from pericardial fluid by the position of the descending aorta *(DA),* by the presence of compressed lung, and by identification of both layers of the pericardium adjacent to the myocardium. Images also were obtained with the transducer on the patient's *(PT)* back *(bottom)*, thus demonstrating the relationship between the pleural fluid and the descending aorta. *Ao,* Aorta.

pericardial or epicardial masses in a patient with a known malignancy certainly raise the possibility of a malignant effusion, but this appearance can be mimicked by a fibrinous organization of a longstanding pericardial effusion. Masses adjacent to the cardiac structures (in the mediastinum) resulting in pericardial effusion can be missed by echocardiography. Wide-view tomographic imaging procedures, such as CT or CMR, are helpful in these cases.

Obviously, whether a pericardial effusion is infective or inflammatory in etiology cannot be determined by echocardiography. Depending on the associated clinical findings in each case, diagnostic pericardiocentesis, pericardial biopsy, or both will help establish the correct diagnosis.

With pericardial effusion due to aortic dissection or cardiac rupture (as a consequence of either myocardial infarction or a procedure), the entry site into the pericardium rarely can be detected, so a high level of suspicion is needed when these diagnoses are a possibility. The site of an LV rupture is "contained" by pericardial adhesions, resulting in formation of a pseudoaneurysm. A *pseudoaneurysm* is defined as a saccular structure communicating with the ventricle with walls composed of pericardium. In contrast, the walls of a "true" aneurysm are composed of thinned, scarred myocardium (see Fig. 8.27).

# PERICARDIAL TAMPONADE

The term *pericardial tamponade* is defined as hemodynamic compromise—hypotension and/or decreased cardiac output—due to compression of the cardiac chambers by fluid in the pericardial space.

# Echocardiographic Approach

When cardiac tamponade occurs with a diffuse, moderate to large pericardial effusion, the associated physiologic changes are evident on echocardiographic and Doppler examination [\(Fig. 10.12\)](#page--1-44), including:

- RA systolic collapse for greater than one-third of systole
- RV diastolic collapse
- Reciprocal respiratory changes in RV and LV volumes (septal shifting)
- Reciprocal respiratory changes (>25%) in RV and LV filling
- Reduced early diastolic tissue Doppler velocity
- Severe dilation of the inferior vena cava

# *Right Atrial Systolic Collapse*

When intrapericardial pressure exceeds RA systolic pressure (lowest point of the atrial pressure curve), inversion or collapse of the RA free wall occurs. Because the RA free wall is a thin, flexible structure, brief RA wall inversion can occur in the absence of tamponade physiology. However, the longer the duration of RA inversion relative to the cycle length, the greater is the likelihood of cardiac tamponade. Inversion for greater than one third of systole has a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 100% for the diagnosis of tamponade. Careful frame-by-frame 2D-image analysis is needed for this evaluation [\(Fig. 10.13](#page--1-43)).

### *Right Ventricular Diastolic Collapse*

RV diastolic collapse occurs when intrapericardial pressure exceeds RV diastolic pressure *and* when the

![](_page_8_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 10.11 Transesophageal echocardiography imaging of loculated effusion.** In this patient with hypotension early after surgical aortic valve and root replacement, no pericardial fluid is noted around the RV or LV, but the TEE four-chamber and long-axis views show pericardial fluid posterior to the left atrium with compression of the left atrial wall resulting in tamponade physiology. *Ao,* Aorta.

![](_page_8_Picture_5.jpeg)

**Fig. 10.12 2D echo findings with tamponade physiology.**

RV free wall is normal in thickness and compliance. The presence of RV hypertrophy or infiltrative diseases of the myocardium allows development of a pressure gradient between the pericardial space and the RV chamber without inversion of the normal contour of the free wall. RV diastolic collapse is best appreciated in the parasternal long-axis view or from a subcostal window. If the timing of RV wall motion is not clear on 2D imaging, an M-mode recording through the RV free wall is helpful. The presence of RV diastolic collapse is somewhat less sensitive (60% to 90%) but more specific (85% to 100%) than brief RA

systolic collapse for diagnosing tamponade physiology [\(Fig. 10.14](#page--1-45)).

#### *Reciprocal Changes in Ventricular Volumes*

Reciprocal respiratory variation in RV and LV volumes and consequent septal shifting are seen on 2D imaging when tamponade is present. In the apical four-chamber view, an increase in RV volume with inspiration (shift in septal motion toward the LV in diastole and toward the RV in systole) and a decrease during expiration (normalization of septal motion) can be appreciated.

![](_page_9_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 10.14 Right ventricular diastolic collapse.** In the same patient as in [Fig. 10.13](#page--1-43), the subcostal four-chamber view shows the pericardial effusion *(PE)* with compression (or collapse) of the RV *(arrows)* in diastole.

This pattern of motion corresponds to the physical finding of pulsus paradoxus. The proposed explanation for this observation is that total pericardial volume (heart chambers plus pericardial fluid) is fixed in tamponade; thus as intrathoracic pressure becomes more negative during inspiration, enhanced RV filling limits LV diastolic filling. This pattern reverses during expiration.

# *Respiratory Variation in Diastolic Filling*

Doppler recordings of RV and LV diastolic filling in patients with tamponade physiology show a pattern that parallels the changes in ventricular volumes. With inspiration, the RV early diastolic filling velocity is augmented, whereas LV diastolic filling diminishes [\(Figs. 10.15](#page--1-46) and [10.16\)](#page--1-47). In addition, the flow velocity integral in the pulmonary artery increases with inspiration, whereas the aortic flow velocity integral decreases. In the acutely ill patient, these changes can be difficult to demonstrate in part because of respiratory changes in the intercept angle between the Doppler beam and the flow of interest, thus causing artifactual apparent velocity changes. Differentiating the normal respiratory variation in diastolic filling from the

excessive variation (>25%) seen in tamponade may be subtle in borderline cases. Tamponade physiology is not an all-or-none phenomenon; hemodynamic impairment is more evident as the degree of pericardial compression (pericardial pressure) increases.

# *Tissue Doppler Early Diastolic Velocity*

The early diastolic mitral annular tissue Doppler velocity *(E′)* is reduced when tamponade is present and returns to normal after pericardiocentesis, likely reflecting changes in cardiac output. However, respiratory variation is not seen, and the sensitivity and specificity of this finding have not been evaluated.

# *Inferior Vena Cava Dilation*

Inferior vena cava plethora, a dilated inferior vena cava with <50% inspiratory reduction in diameter near the inferior vena cava–RA junction, also is a sensitive (97%), albeit nonspecific (40%), indicator of tamponade physiology. This simple finding reflects the elevated RA pressure seen in tamponade.

# Clinical Utility

# *Diagnosis of Pericardial Tamponade*

In evaluating a patient for cardiac tamponade, it is essential to remember that tamponade is a clinical and hemodynamic diagnosis. Furthermore, varying degrees of tamponade physiology are possible. The most important finding on echocardiography in a patient with suspected pericardial tamponade is whether or not a pericardial effusion is present. The absence of a pericardial effusion *excludes* the diagnosis, but again care must be taken that a loculated effusion is not missed. Only rarely does tamponade physiology result from other mediastinal contents under pressure (e.g., air due to barotrauma or a compressive mass). Conversely, in a patient with convincing clinical evidence for tamponade, the presence of a moderate to large pericardial effusion on echocardiography *confirms* the diagnosis; further evaluation with Doppler is not needed and should not delay appropriate intervention.

In intermediate cases, either when the diagnosis has not been considered or when clinical evidence is equivocal, 2D findings of chamber collapse and inferior vena cava plethora in addition to Doppler findings showing marked respiratory variation in RV and LV filling are helpful, in conjunction with the clinical data (see Table B.10). Another approach to making this diagnosis is right heart catheterization showing depressed cardiac output and equalization of RA, RV diastolic, and pulmonary artery wedge pressures.

# *Echo-Guided Pericardiocentesis*

The success rate without complications of percutaneous needle pericardiocentesis can be enhanced by using echocardiographic guidance. With the patient in the position planned for the procedure, the optimal transcutaneous approach is identified based on the location of the effusion, the distance from the chest wall to the pericardium, and the absence of intervening structures. The transducer angle and pericardial depth are noted, and the transducer position is marked before preparing the site for the procedure. After the procedure, the residual amount of pericardial fluid is assessed using standard tomographic views ([Fig.](#page--1-48) [10.17](#page--1-48)). If monitoring during the procedure is needed, an acoustic window that allows visualization of the effusion but does not compromise the sterile field is identified. (Alternatively, a sterile sleeve is used for the transducer.) Note that with *tomographic* imaging it is difficult to identify the *tip* of the needle because any segment of the needle passing through the image plane appears to be the tip. The source of error is minimized by scanning in both superior-inferior and lateral-medial directions during the procedure or using 3D imaging. Confirmation that the needle tip is in the pericardial space can be made by injecting a small amount of agitated sterile saline solution through the needle to achieve an echo-contrast effect.

# PERICARDIAL CONSTRICTION

#### Basic Principles

In constrictive pericarditis, the serous surfaces of the visceral and parietal pericardium are adherent, thickened, and fibrotic, with resultant loss of the pericardial space and impairment of diastolic ventricular filling. Pericardial constriction can occur after repeated episodes of pericarditis, after cardiac surgery, after radiation therapy, and from a variety of other causes. The diagnosis often is delayed because clinical symptoms are nonspecific—fatigue and malaise due to low cardiac output—and physical findings either

On the pre-pericardiocentesis image *(left),* a large pericardial effusion *(PE),* a small ventricular chamber, and RA collapse are seen. The post-pericardiocentesis image *(right)* shows the absence of an effusion, an increase in RV and LV volumes, and a normal contour of the RA wall.

**Fig. 10.18 Pericardial tamponade compared with pericardial constriction.** With tamponade, diastolic filling is impaired in both early and late diastole because of the elevated pericardial pressures "compressing" the heart. With constriction, early diastolic filling is rapid but ends abruptly when the volume limits of the rigid pericardial space are reached.

are subtle (elevated jugular venous pressure, distant heart sounds) or occur only late in the disease course (ascites and peripheral edema).

The physiology of constrictive pericarditis is characterized by impaired diastolic cardiac filling due to the abnormal pericardium surrounding the cardiac structures, which act like a rigid "box" [\(Fig. 10.18](#page--1-49)). Early diastolic filling is rapid, with an abrupt cessation of ventricular filling as diastolic pressure rises—when the "box" is "full." Pressure tracings ([Fig. 10.19\)](#page--1-50) typically show:

- A brief, rapid fall of ventricular pressure in early diastole followed by
- A high mid-diastolic pressure plateau (*dip-plateau* or *square root sign*)

- A rapid fall in RA pressure with the onset of ventricular filling (*y*-descent)
- Only modest elevation of RV and pulmonary artery systolic pressures
- An RV diastolic pressure plateau that is one third or more of systolic pressure
- Equalization of diastolic pressures in the RV and LV even after volume loading

# Echocardiographic Approach

Echocardiographic evaluation of the patient with possible constrictive pericarditis requires careful integration of imaging and Doppler data. In addition to standard imaging planes, Doppler flow, and tissue Doppler data, additional recordings of ventricular

and atrial inflows are needed at lower sweep speeds (to show more sequential beats on the saved images) with a respirometer tracing or other annotation of the respiratory phase.

#### *Imaging*

0

Typically, LV wall thickness, internal dimensions, and systolic function are normal in the patient with constrictive pericarditis. LA enlargement is seen because of chronic LA pressure elevation. Pericardial thickening is evident on 2D imaging as increased echogenicity in the region of the pericardium ([Fig.](#page--1-51) [10.20](#page--1-51)). Careful examination from several acoustic windows is needed because the spatial distribution of pericardial thickening often is asymmetric.

M-mode imaging still is helpful for the diagnosis of pericardial thickening on transthoracic imaging. From the parasternal approach, an M-mode recording shows multiple echo-densities, posterior to the LV epicardium, moving parallel with each other; they persist even at a low-gain setting. High time resolution M-mode recordings also demonstrate abrupt posterior motion of the ventricular septum in early diastole, with flat motion in mid-diastole and abrupt anterior motion following atrial contraction. This pattern of motion appears to be due to initial rapid RV diastolic filling followed by both equalization of filling of the RV and LV as the "plateau" phase of the pressure curve is reached and increased RV filling after atrial contraction. The LV posterior wall endocardium shows little posterior motion during diastole (<2 mm from early to late diastole) because of the impairment of diastolic filling resulting in a "flat" pattern of diastolic posterior wall motion.

On subcostal views, the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins are dilated, reflecting the elevated RA pressure.

# *Doppler Examination*

The Doppler findings in constrictive pericarditis reflect the abnormal hemodynamics in this condition [\(Figs.](#page--1-52) [10.21 and 10.22](#page--1-52)), including:

- Characteristic patterns of RA and LA filling
- Respiratory variation in LV and RV filling
- Respiratory variation in the isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT)
- Tissue Doppler *S*′ >8 cm/s and *E*′ >8 cm/s

Pulsed Doppler recordings of hepatic vein flow (from a subcostal approach) measure RA filling and show a prominent *a*-wave and a deep *y*-descent ([Fig.](#page--1-53) [10.23](#page--1-53)) in addition to a marked increase in flow velocities with inspiration. Similarly, pulsed Doppler recordings of pulmonary vein flow (transthoracic apical four-chamber view or TEE approach) indicate LA filling and again show a prominent *a*-wave, prominent *y*-descent, a prominent diastolic filling phase, and blunting of the systolic phase of atrial filling.

Both RV and LV diastolic filling show a high *E* velocity, reflecting rapid early diastolic filling due to the initial high atrial to ventricular pressure difference. As LV pressure rises, filling abruptly ceases, reflected in a short deceleration time of the *E* velocity curve. Little ventricular filling occurs in late diastole because of the elevated LV diastolic pressure (the "plateau") and the constrictive effect of the thickened pericardium. Doppler recordings of ventricular inflow thus show a very small *A* velocity following atrial contraction.

Marked reciprocal respiratory variations in RV and LV diastolic inflow velocities are seen because of the differing effects of changes in intrapleural

**Fig. 10.20 Constrictive pericarditis.** In the parasternal short-axis view, thickened pericardium *(arrows)* and a small effusion are seen posterior to the LV. The subcostal view shows a dilated inferior vena cava *(IVC)* with no respiratory change in diameter.

![](_page_13_Figure_4.jpeg)

**Fig. 10.21 Tissue Doppler annular motion with constrictive pericarditis.** With constrictive pericarditis the typical pattern of a higher E′ velocity at the septum compared to the lateral wall is reversed. As in this example, septal annular E′ velocity is 17 cm/s compared with a lateral annular E′ velocity of 12 cm/s, an imaging finding sometimes called "annulus reversus." The likely explanation for this finding is restriction diastolic expansion of the lateral LV wall by the adherence pericardium with a compensatory increase in septal motion as the LV fills in early diastole.

pressure on filling of the two ventricles [\(Fig. 10.24](#page--1-54)). With inspiration, intrapleural pressure becomes more negative, resulting in augmentation of RV diastolic filling and inflow velocity. In contrast, LV filling velocities *decrease* with inspiration and *increase* with expiration. Although similar directional changes in filling velocities occur in normal individuals, the respiratory changes are much greater (variation >25%) in patients with constrictive pericarditis.

The LV isovolumic relaxation time—measured from the aortic closure to the mitral opening click on Doppler recordings—increases by a mean of 20% with inspiration in patients with constrictive pericarditis. Tissue Doppler findings in constrictive pericarditis include an increased early diastolic velocity *(E*′*)*, consistent with rapid early diastolic filling.

# *Constrictive Pericarditis Versus Restrictive Cardiomyopathy*

Even though the hemodynamic features of pericardial tamponade and pericardial constriction have some similarities, differentiating between these two diagnoses usually is straightforward based on the presence or absence of a pericardial effusion [\(Table 10.4](#page--1-55)). Differentiating between constrictive pericarditis and a restrictive cardiomyopathy is more difficult. Both are characterized by clinical signs and symptoms of elevated venous pressure and low cardiac output, and both show a normal-sized LV chamber with normal systolic function on 2D echocardiography. Pericardial thickening frequently is difficult to appreciate, and other 2D and M-mode findings do not reliably differentiate reduced. Δ, Change.

between these two diagnoses. Doppler findings that favor constrictive pericarditis over restrictive cardiomyopathy include (1) reciprocal respiratory changes in ventricular volumes and filling parameters with a 25% or greater difference in maximum *E* velocity from expiration to inspiration and (2) normal or only mildly elevated pulmonary pressures. The relative difference in the E′ tissue Doppler velocity also is helpful. With restrictive cardiomyopathy, the septal E′ velocity is lower than the lateral E′ velocity (e.g., the normal pattern). With constrictive pericarditis, this pattern is reversed with a higher septal compared with lateral E′ velocity, often called "annulus reversus" due to tethering of the lateral wall by the adherent pericardium. However, Doppler data are not absolutely accurate because of overlap among groups in the Doppler findings and because of differing hemodynamics in patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy depending on disease stage (see Chapter 9).

Studies suggest that newer approaches, such as speckle tracking echocardiography, may be useful in differentiating constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy ([Fig. 10.25\)](#page--1-56).

# Clinical Utility

The diagnosis of pericardial constriction remains problematic, with no single diagnostic feature on echocardiographic or Doppler examination. However, the conjunction of several findings in a patient in whom the level of clinical suspicion is high increases the likelihood of this diagnosis and is definitive in some cases (see Table B.11). Conversely, the echo and Doppler findings sometimes provide the first clues to this diagnosis in a patient in whom it was not previously considered, for example, a patient presenting with ascites and no prior cardiac history.

TEE is more accurate than transthoracic echocardiography for the diagnosis of pericardial thickening,

**Fig. 10.25 Strain imaging in constriction.** Longitudinal systolic strain (speckle tracking) "bull's-eye" map in a patient with constrictive pericarditis. Global average longitudinal systolic strain is nearly normal (−17.8%). Lateral *(LAT)* strain is prominently reduced compared with septal *(SEPT)* strain because of the tethering effects of the diseased pericardium. *A2C,* Apical two-chamber; *A4C,* apical four-chamber; *ANT,* Anterior; *INF,* inferior; *POST,* posterior. *(From Otto CM, editor:* The Practice of Clinical Echocardiography, *ed 5, Philadelphia, 2017, Fig. 28.10.)*

**Fig. 10.26 Computed tomography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging for pericardial thickening.** In a 32-year-old man who received radiation therapy 15 years ago, chest computed tomography (A) shows thickening of the pericardium *(arrows)* and bilateral pleural effusion. (B) In the same patient, a similar cardiac magnetic resonance view shows pericardial thickening as a low-signal band *(arrows)* at the apex and around the lateral LV wall, anterior to the RV.

with a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 86%. However, CT or CMR scanning is more definitive for the detection of pericardial thickening and calcification, especially when they are asymmetric [\(Fig. 10.26](#page--1-57)). Endomyocardial biopsy occasionally confirms a diagnosis of restrictive cardiomyopathy due to an infiltrative process. Right- and left-sided heart catheterization shows equalization of diastolic pressure in the four cardiac chambers when constrictive pericarditis is present.

Differentiation between constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy is further complicated by the concurrent presence of both conditions in some patients, for example, in patients with radiation-induced heart disease. Similarly, although constrictive pericarditis typically occurs in the absence of a pericardial effusion, some patients have an overlap condition with a clinical presentation consistent with effusiveconstrictive pericarditis.

# **THE ECHO EXAM**

# Pericardial Disease **Pericardial Effusion**

#### Views

- • Parasternal
  - • Apical
  - • Subcostal

Distinguish from pleural fluid

#### Size

- • Small (<0.5 cm)
- • Moderate (0.5–2.0 cm)
- • Large (>2.0 cm)

Diffuse versus loculated

Evaluate for tamponade physiology if moderate or large

TEE if needed, especially in postoperative patients

#### **Pericardial Tamponade**

#### Clinical findings

- • Low cardiac output
- • Elevated venous pressures
- • Pulsus paradoxus
- • Hypotension

#### 2D-echo

- • Moderate to large pericardial effusion
- • RA systolic collapse (duration greater than one third of systole)
- • RV diastolic collapse
- • Reciprocal respiratory changes in RV and LV volumes
- • Inferior vena cava plethora

#### Doppler

- • Respiratory variation in RV and LV diastolic filling
- • Increased RV filling on first beat after inspiration
- • Decreased LV filling on first beat after inspiration

*IVRT,* Isovolumic relaxation time.

#### **Constrictive Pericarditis**

#### Imaging

- • Pericardial thickening
- • Normal LV size and systolic function
- • LA enlargement
- • Flattened diastolic wall motion
- • Abrupt posterior motion of the ventricular septum in early diastole
- • Dilated inferior vena cava and hepatic veins

#### Doppler

- • Prominent y-descent on hepatic vein or superior vena cava flow pattern
- • LV inflow showing prominent E velocity with a rapid early diastolic deceleration slope and a small or absent A velocity
- • Increase in LV IVRT by >20% on first beat after inspiration
- • Respiratory variations in RV and LV diastolic filling (difference >25%) with inspiratory ↑RV ↓LV filling with inspiration
- • Tissue Doppler ↑ E′ >8 cm/s with S′ >8 cm/s
- • Annulus reversus with septal E′ > lateral E′
- • Pulmonary venous flow showing prominent a-wave and blunting of systolic phase

#### **LV Pseudoaneurysm**

- • Abrupt transition from normal myocardium to aneurysm
- • Acute angle between myocardium and aneurysm
- • Narrow neck
- • Ratio of neck diameter to aneurysm diameter <0.5
- • Often lined with thrombus
