ransesophageal echocardiography (TEE) offers the advantage of improved image quality compared with transthoracic echocardiographic images, particularly of posterior structures, such as the interatrial septum, mitral valve, left atrium (LA), and pulmonary veins. Image quality is improved both because of the decreased distance between the transducer and the structures of interest and because of the absence of intervening lung or bone tissue. A better signal-to-noise ratio and decreased image depth also allow for the use of higher-frequency (5- and 7-MHz) transducers, which further enhances image quality. Three-dimensional (3D) TEE imaging is increasingly used to evaluate mitral valve and atrial septal anatomy and to guide complex interventional procedures (see Chapter 18). T

However, TEE imaging is more risky than transthoracic imaging because of the insertion of the probe in the esophagus and the need for conscious sedation in most patients. Typically, a TEE examination provides additional information but does not replace a transthoracic examination, and in some situations, transthoracic imaging provides better image quality and diagnostic Doppler data. For example, anterior structures, such as a prosthetic aortic valve, may be better imaged from the transthoracic approach. For Doppler velocity measurements, the transthoracic approach offers more acoustic windows with the ability to adjust the transducer angle freely in both the transverse and elevational planes. In contrast, transducer position and angulation are constrained with the TEE approach by the relative positions of the esophagus and heart. The inability to align the Doppler beam parallel to the flow of interest often results in substantial velocity underestimation. In addition, it often is more difficult to obtain standard anatomic measurements from the TEE approach because of oblique two-dimensional (2D) image planes. Thus, even when TEE imaging is necessary, data from the transthoracic examination are integrated into the final clinical interpretation.

In this chapter, the TEE procedure and its risks are briefly outlined, followed by a description of the standard views obtained from each acoustic window (upper esophageal, mid-esophageal, transgastric, transgastric apical, and descending aorta). Sections on the TEE imaging and Doppler evaluation of each cardiac valve and chamber are included to guide the reader to the optimal views for each anatomic structure. This chapter focuses on normal anatomy and flow patterns. Clinical indications for TEE imaging are discussed in Chapter 5, and pathologic images are integrated into subsequent chapters. The use of TEE imaging to monitor surgical and interventional procedures is discussed in Chapter 18.

# <span id="page-0-0"></span>PROTOCOLS AND RISKS

The TEE procedure is performed by a physician skilled in both echocardiography and the endoscopy procedure, as detailed in published guidelines for physician training. Typically, a cardiac sonographer assists the physician, by adjusting instrument settings for optimal image quality and data acquisition. Many physicians use conscious sedation for their patients, in addition to local anesthesia of the pharynx, to minimize patients' discomfort and improve tolerance of the procedure. When sedation is used, a designated, qualified individual (usually a nurse) monitors and documents the patient's blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, arterial oxygen saturation, and level of consciousness throughout the procedure. The nurse also ensures patency of the airway and provides suction of oral secretions as needed. The specific protocols, medications used for sedation, and monitoring procedures are dictated by the standards of each institution.

TEE has a very low incidence of complications when performed by trained individuals with appropriate patient selection and monitoring. However, this procedure does have known risks, which must be taken into consideration in deciding whether the potential information obtained justifies use of this procedure; TEE is contraindicated in some clinical situations, as summarized in [Table 3.1](#page--1-25). The rate of complications serious enough to interrupt the procedure is less than 1%, with a reported mortality rate of less than 1 in 10,000 patients [\(Table 3.2\)](#page--1-26). If the preprocedure history or physical examination suggests an increased risk for conscious sedation, appropriate consultation with anesthesiology is essential. If the patient has a history of esophageal disease or symptoms related to impaired swallowing, evaluation of the esophagus or a gastroenterology consultation is needed before TEE.

After sedation and local anesthesia of the pharynx, the probe is gently inserted via a bite block, positioned in the esophagus, and advanced as needed to obtain diagnostic images. In intubated patients in the intensive care unit, interventional suite, or operating room, care is needed to avoid compromise of the endotracheal tube position. Indwelling nasogastric or feeding tubes may limit probe motion or result in air between the transducer and the heart, so these tubes often need to be removed for the TEE procedure.

The risk of aspiration is minimized by: having the patient fast for several hours before the procedure, by using a left lateral decubitus position during probe insertion, and by having the patient continue to fast after the procedure until recovery from the local anesthesia of the pharynx. Esophageal trauma or perforation is unlikely in the absence of a history of esophageal disease or swallowing difficulty, both of which are ascertained by clinical history. Bleeding complications are rare and usually mild, and the procedure can be safely performed with therapeutic levels of systemic anticoagulation. Initial concern that TEE imaging could increase the risk of endocarditis

**Fig. 3.1 Transesophageal echocardiography image plane rotation.** Rotation of the image plane starting from the four-chamber view (see [Fig. 3.3](#page--1-28)), with the LV apex centered in the image, allows a two-chamber view (see [Fig. 3.7\)](#page--1-29) at approximately 60° rotation and a long-axis view (see [Fig. 3.9\)](#page--1-30) at approximately 120° rotation. Slight repositioning and angulation of the transducer may be needed as the image plane is rotated to ensure inclusion of the LV apex in the image.

in the esophagus constrains the possible image planes that can be obtained, potentially resulting in oblique 2D image orientations compared with standard echocardiographic image planes. The goal of a TEE study is to perform a systematic and comprehensive examination, using standard short-axis, long-axis, two-chamber, and four-chamber image planes whenever possible. Standard views then are supplemented with additional image planes to demonstrate the specific pathologic processes in each patient.

3D echocardiographic techniques can facilitate obtaining optimal views and display of spatial relationships, particularly for the atrial septum and mitral valve. 3D imaging is optimal when 3D acquisitions start from a standard 2D tomographic image plane. The recommended sequence of 2D images, 3D data sets, and Doppler recordings for a standard TEE study is shown in The Echo Exam summary at the end of this chapter. The following sections describe both the 2D and 3D views useful for evaluation of the valves and cardiac chambers. Often additional views or Doppler data are needed to supplement the basic examination, depending on the specific clinical question.

The position of the tip of the probe is described as esophageal or transgastric and is referenced to the cardiac structures seen in each view. The absolute distance of the transducer from the patient's mouth will vary depending on body size and cardiac position. The exact degree of rotation, tilt, and angulation needed to obtain the best short-axis, long-axis, twochamber, and four-chamber views also varies. When standard views are obtained, the images correspond to the anatomy described for the equivalent transthoracic views, with the major difference being image orientation given the TEE transducer position.

For TEE echocardiograms, transducer motions [\(Fig. 3.2](#page--1-31)) are referred to as:

- *Repositioning,* defined as movement of the probe up and down in the esophagus
- *Rotation,* defined as rotating the image plane from 0° to 180° using the multiplane control knob
- *Turning,* defined as moving the entire transducer in a rotational fashion in the esophagus to show a mediolateral change in image plane
- *Angulation,* defined as bending and extending the probe so that the image plane is directed superiorly or inferiorly at an angle to the original image plane
- *Tilt,* defined as lateral motion of the transducer tip to image different structures in the same image plane (although slight superior motion occurs as well)

From the TEE position, most image planes are achieved using repositioning, rotation, and turning of the transducer. The use of angulation is particularly important on transgastric views. A key principle in using a multiplane probe is that the anatomic area of interest should be centered in the image before rotation to a new view; this ensures that the structure of interest remains in the image plane.

# Esophageal Position

# *Four-Chamber Plane*

As the transducer is advanced into the esophagus from the mouth toward the stomach, acoustic access is limited by interposition of the air-filled trachea until the transducer passes the level of the carina. From a high TEE position, with the probe located posterior to the LA, a standard four-chamber view

![](_page_3_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Fig. 3.2 Turning the transesophageal echocardiography image plane.** From a mid-esophageal position, turning the image plane from left to right provides images of the left pulmonary veins *(purple)*, aorta and LV *(blue)*, RV *(green)*, and RA with superior and inferior vena cavae *(yellow).*

is obtained in the 0° position with angulation of the transducer toward the left ventricular (LV) apex [\(Fig.](#page--1-28) [3.3](#page--1-28)). In the four-chamber view the lateral wall and inferior septal segments of the LV are seen, along with the central portions of both the anterior and posterior leaflets of the mitral valve.

Care is needed to include as much of the full length of the ventricle as possible in this view. Typically, even with optimal positioning and angulation, TEE views are somewhat foreshortened compared with the true long-axis of the ventricle, and the apparent apex may actually represent a more proximal segment of the anterior wall. The four-chamber view is useful for the evaluation of overall ventricular systolic function, regional wall motion (recognizing that the apex often be missed), and the pattern of septal motion. Biplane ejection fraction also can be calculated from traced endocardial borders at end-diastole and end-systole, although volumes may be underestimated because of foreshortening of the ventricular length.

From the four-chamber view, anterior angulation shows the LV outflow tract and aortic valve (the "five-chamber" view) [\(Figs. 3.4](#page--1-32) and [3.5\)](#page--1-33). Posterior angulation provides images of the lateral segments of the mitral valve leaflets, with the coronary sinus visualized on extreme posterior angulation. A 3D image of the mitral valve, viewed from the LA side, obtained by real-time imaging from stored full-volume data acquisition, is helpful when mitral valve pathology is present.

While examining the LA in the four-chamber plane, it is helpful to slowly advance and withdraw the transducer to visualize the full superior and inferior extent or to slowly angulate the probe tip to provide

**Fig. 3.3 Transesophageal echocardiography four-chamber view.** Drawing *(left)* and echocardiographic image *(right)* obtained from an upper TEE position with the multiplane probe at 0° rotation. In this view, the apparent apex may actually represent a segment of the anterior wall because of foreshortening of the long axis of the ventricle.

**Fig. 3.4 Transesophageal echocardiography probe angulation.** From an upper esophageal position with the probe at 0° rotation, the transducer tip is extended to obtain a four-chamber view (as shown in [Fig. 3.3](#page--1-28)) or flexed for a short-axis view of the LA appendage (as shown in [Fig. 3.8\)](#page--1-34).

sequential cross sections of the LA. Because the LA is in the near field of the image, careful adjustment of imaging parameters is needed to avoid misinterpretation of near-field artifacts. For this reason, identification of a small thrombus along the posterior LA wall is problematic.

In the standard four-chamber TEE image, the size, shape, and systolic function of the right ventricle (RV) are assessed by turning the probe toward the patient's right side. This view also provides visualization of the septal and anterior leaflets of the tricuspid valve and the right atrium (RA). The interatrial septum is well visualized, with the fossa ovalis and primum septal region clearly identifiable ([Fig. 3.6](#page--1-35)).

# *Two-Chamber Plane*

After ensuring that the LV apex is in the center of the image in a four-chamber view, the image plane is rotated to about 60° to obtain a two-chamber view. Because the apex often is not exactly centered in three dimensions, the position and angulation of the transducer are adjusted to obtain a two-chamber view that includes the full length of the LV [\(Fig. 3.7](#page--1-29)). In this view, the inferior and anterior LV walls of the LV are seen, allowing assessment of regional function and providing the orthogonal plane (along with the four-chamber view) for calculation of ejection fraction. In the two-chamber view, typically only the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve is seen, so it is difficult to evaluate leaflet prolapse in this view.

With further rotation to about 90°, the LA appendage is visualized in a view approximately perpendicular

**Fig. 3.5 Left ventricular outflow view.** (A) Slight anterior angulation from the four-chamber view, midway between the image planes shown in [Fig.](#page--1-32) [3.4](#page--1-32), allows visualization of the aortic valve and LV outflow tract.

**Fig. 3.6 Interatrial septum view.** A biplane view of the interatrial septum is obtained by turning the transducer from the four-chamber view toward the patient's right side in a four-chamber view *(left).* The thin central region of the interatrial septum known as the fossa ovalis is between the *arrows*. The biplane image at 90° shows a second view of the interatrial septum. *Ao,* Aorta; *SVC,* superior vena cava.

**Fig. 3.7 Transesophageal echocardiography two-chamber view.** The two-chamber, or vertical long-axis, plane is shown in the 3D heart and then rotated with the vertex of the sector at the top to correspond to the systolic and diastolic echocardiographic images. This view shows the LA and LV with the LA appendage *(LAA),* coronary sinus in the atrioventricular groove, and the mitral valve. In the two-chamber view, small portions of the posterior mitral leaflet are seen laterally and medially with the anterior leaflet filling most of the annulus area. Part of a papillary muscle has been shown for orientation, but the papillary muscles are located symmetrically posterior to the image plane.

**Fig. 3.8 Left coronary artery.** LA appendage *(LAA)* and left main coronary artery seen at a rotation angle of about 30°. Starting in the four-chamber view the probe is slightly withdrawn and angulated anteriorly. Note the normal trabeculation in the LAA compared with the smooth LA wall. This image was obtained with a 7.0-MHz transducer to optimize detection of atrial appendage thrombus. *Ao,* Aorta.

to that obtained in the transverse plane [\(Fig. 3.8](#page--1-34)). The left superior pulmonary vein is seen entering the LA by slightly withdrawing and turning the probe laterally. The 90° view is also useful for evaluation of mitral valve anatomy.

#### *Long-Axis Plane*

From the high-TEE probe position, further rotation of the image plane to about 120° results in a long-axis view of the LV and aorta [\(Fig. 3.9](#page--1-30)). Again, slight adjustment of transducer position and angulation is needed to obtain a view that includes the LV apex. Similar to a transthoracic long-axis view, the proximal ascending aorta, sinuses of Valsalva, and right coronary and noncoronary leaflets of the aortic valve are well visualized. In a correctly aligned long-axis plane, the aortic valve leaflets should look linear with a closure slightly more cephalad than the leaflet attachment sites. Scanning between this view and the 90° image planes allows appreciation of the perpendicular relationship between the aortic and pulmonic valve planes and the slightly more cephalad position of the pulmonic valve. Note that in the esophageal long-axis plane, withdrawing the transducer in the esophagus results in more cephalad images of the ascending aorta, with the superior limit of imaging determined by the interposed air-filled bronchus [\(Fig. 3.10](#page--1-36)).

The anterior and posterior mitral leaflets are seen in a long-axis orientation, and the coronary sinus is identified in cross section in the atrioventricular groove. The right pulmonary artery is visualized posterior to the aortic root at the superior aspect of the LA. In the long-axis view, the anterior septum and posterior wall of the LV are seen. In addition, a portion of the RV outflow tract is seen anterior to the aortic valve (in the far field of the image).

## *Other Long-Axis Image Planes*

At a rotation angle of 90°, the probe is turned from the LV long-axis view toward the patient's left side to obtain a long-axis view of the pulmonic valve and RV outflow tract [\(Fig. 3.11\)](#page--1-37). In this view, the pulmonic valve is in the far field of the image, with shadowing by the aortic valve and root if calcification is present. Portions of the RV and tricuspid valve are seen, depending on the exact position of the heart relative to the esophagus in each patient.

At a 90° rotation with the probe turned toward the patient's right side, images of the RV and tricuspid valve in an inflow view are obtained. If the probe is turned farther to the right, the bicaval view is obtained, showing the RA and RA appendage, with the superior vena cava entering from the right side of the screen and the inferior vena cava from the left [\(Fig. 3.12](#page--1-38)). In some individuals, a Eustachian valve at the inferior caval-atrial junction is seen. The trabeculated RA appendage often is seen with slight medial rotation from this view.

## *Short-Axis Plane*

A short-axis view at the aortic valve level is obtained by rotating the image plane to between 30° and 45° and withdrawing the probe in the esophagus to the level of the aortic valve. Visualization of aortic valve anatomy is excellent, showing the three leaflets and sinuses of Valsalva [\(Fig. 3.13](#page--1-39)). The interatrial septum is well seen, with the fossa ovalis clearly defined. The origin of the left main coronary artery is easily identified after minor adjustments in the depth and tilt of the image plane. The right coronary artery is more difficult to visualize in the short-axis view but often is seen in the long-axis view of the aortic valve and ascending aorta..

By turning the transducer laterally and angulating superiorly from the 0° esophageal position, the LA appendage and left superior pulmonary vein are seen [\(Fig. 3.14](#page--1-40)). Prominent features include normal trabeculation of the atrial appendage and a variably prominent ridge at the junction of the left superior pulmonary vein and the LA appendage. Compared with the left superior pulmonary vein, which enters the LA anteriorly with flow directed parallel to the ultrasound beam, the left inferior pulmonary vein enters the atrium with flow perpendicular to the ultrasound beam. The left inferior pulmonary vein

**Fig. 3.9 Transesophageal echocardiography long-axis view.** The position of the image plane is shown on the 3D heart with the tomographic view rotated to the standard TEE image orientation to correspond to the systolic and diastolic echocardiographic images. This view typically is obtained at approximately 120° rotation, but considerable individual variability exists in the exact image plane needed to show the aorta and LV in a long-axis orientation. The 3D view shows the cross-section of the aortic root *(Ao),* LV, LA, and RV outflow tract *(RVOT).* In the long-axis view, the anterior and posterior mitral valve leaflets are seen. *CS,* Coronary sinus.

In the 90° TEE image plane, the RV outflow tract *(RVOT),* pulmonic valve *(PV, arrow)*, and pulmonary artery *(PA)* are seen. *MV,* Mitral valve.

is seen by advancing the transducer and angulating slightly inferiorly. The right pulmonary veins are imaged by rotating the transducer medially and withdrawing the transducer cephalad (to see the anteriorly directed right superior pulmonary vein) or by angulating the transducer inferiorly (to see the medially directed right inferior pulmonary vein). The pulmonary veins also are identified in the 90° image plane by turning the transducer toward the patient's right to show the right pulmonary veins and to the left for the left pulmonary veins. Again, color flow imaging often facilitates identification of the pulmonary veins based on the characteristic venous inflow patterns.

In many patients, the pulmonary artery can be imaged in the 0° image plane by further withdrawing the probe in the esophagus to obtain a view straight down the main pulmonary artery from the bifurcation to the valve level. In some cases, this view is limited by the position of the air-filled bronchus, and some patients find the probe uncomfortable when it is positioned at this level in the esophagus.

**Fig. 3.12 Transesophageal echocardiography bicaval view.** The position of the image plane is shown on the 3D heart with the tomographic view rotated to the standard TEE image orientation to correspond to the systolic and diastolic echocardiographic images. With the probe turned toward the patient's right side, the RA, superior vena cava *(SVC),* and inferior vena cava *(IVC)* are visualized in the 90° TEE image plane. A Eustachian valve often is present at the IVC-RA junction. Part of the trabeculated RA appendage is seen adjacent to the SVC.

## Transgastric Position

#### *Short-Axis Plane*

As the transducer is passed into the stomach, slight resistance may be encountered at the gastroesophageal junction. With the probe tip in the stomach, superior angulation (flexing the scope) in the 0° image plane results in a short-axis view of the LV at the papillary muscle level ([Fig. 3.15\)](#page--1-41). In this view, global LV systolic function, LV dimensions and wall thickness, and regional LV function are evaluated ([Fig. 3.16\)](#page--1-42). Depending on the position of the patient's heart with respect to the diaphragm, a short-axis view at the mitral valve level is obtained by slight withdrawal of the transducer toward the esophagus ([Fig. 3.17\)](#page--1-43).

#### *Two-Chamber Plane*

A two-chamber view of the LV is obtained from the transgastric position by rotating the image plane to the 90° position ([Fig. 3.18\)](#page--1-44). From this two-chamber view, turning the entire probe toward the patient's right side results in (1) a view of the LV outflow tract and aortic valve and then, with further turning to the right, (2) a view of the RA, tricuspid valve, and RV similar to a transthoracic RV inflow view. In

Fig. 3.15 Transgastric image planes. From the transgastric position, the probe is positioned near the gastroesophageal junction to obtain a shortaxis view of the LV or is advanced into the stomach to obtain an "apical" view. Transgastric apical images may show a foreshortened LV because the true LV apex often does not lie on the diaphragm.

**Fig. 3.16 Transgastric short-axis views of the left ventricle.** The position of the image plane is shown on the 3D heart with the tomographic view rotated to the standard TEE image orientation to correspond to the systolic and diastolic echocardiographic images. This view is obtained by retroflexion of the transducer from a transgastric position and is particularly valuable for intraoperative monitoring of LV size and global and regional systolic function.

some individuals, the RV outflow tract and pulmonic valve also are visualized.

#### *Four-Chamber Plane*

From the transgastric short-axis view, the transducer is advanced farther, into the fundus of the stomach. In most individuals, an "apical" four-chamber view can be obtained using the 0° image plane of the probe if the LV lies on the diaphragm, without intervening lung. Note that the transducer usually is not on the true LV apex, so this view is foreshortened. Anterior angulation shows the aortic valve in a view similar to the transthoracic five-chamber view.

#### *Long-Axis Plane*

From the transgastric apical four-chamber plane, rotation of the image plane to 120° results in a long-axis view of the LV outflow tract, thus providing a more parallel intercept angle for Doppler study of outflow tract and aortic velocities. However, this view

**Fig. 3.17 Transgastric short-axis at the mitral valve level.** The position of the image plane is shown on the 3D heart with the tomographic view rotated to the standard TEE image orientation to correspond to the systolic and diastolic echocardiographic images. From the transgastric short-axis view of the LV, slight withdrawal of the probe toward the gastroesophageal junction may allow a short-axis view of the mitral valve with definition of the anterior mitral valve leaflets *(AMVL)* and posterior mitral valve leaflets *(PMVL)*.

cannot be obtained in all patients, particularly if the transducer is not on the true LV apex, because lung tissue is interposed between the transducer and cardiac structures as the image plane is rotated.

# Descending Thoracic Aorta

From the TEE or transgastric position, the transducer is turned posteriorly until the image plane is directed slightly left of the patient's spine to obtain a short-axis view of the descending thoracic aorta. The aorta appears circular and shows normal systolic pulsations [\(Fig. 3.19\)](#page--1-45). The descending thoracic aorta is imaged in sequential short-axis views from the transgastric position to the junction with the aortic arch as the probe is slowly withdrawn in the esophagus. When the transducer reaches the level of the arch, turning the transducer medially with inferior angulation allows a long-axis view of the arch itself. Imaging in the short-axis view as the probe is withdrawn along the

**Fig. 3.18 Transgastric long-axis views of the left ventricle.** From the transgastric short-axis view, 90° rotation provides a two-chamber view of the LV, LA, and LA appendage *(LAA) (top)*. The tomographic image plane has been rotated with the apex of the sector at the top to correspond to the echocardiographic image *(bottom right)*. Turning the transducer toward the patient's right side from this view provides a two-chamber view of the RA and RV, analogous to a transthoracic RV inflow view.

length of the aorta ensures visualization of the entire aortic endothelium.

A long-axis view of the descending aorta, obtained by centering the aorta in the 2D sector and rotating the image plane to 90°, complements the short-axis view in evaluation of aortic dissections, aneurysms, and atheromas and improves the differentiation of ultrasound artifacts from anatomic abnormalities. The 90° image plane also allows identification of the origin of the left subclavian artery, which is important for describing the proximal extent of dissection and for placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump (see Chapter 16). Biplane imaging allows simultaneous short- and long-axis views of the descending thoracic aorta.

## VALVE ANATOMY AND FUNCTION

Optimal evaluation of valve anatomy and function on TEE echocardiography includes the use of at least two standard orthogonal imaging planes [\(Table](#page--1-46) [3.3](#page--1-46)). This approach provides a reasonably complete evaluation of valve anatomy and aids recognition

![](_page_14_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 3.19 Transesophageal echocardiography 2D and color flow images of the descending thoracic aorta.** Short-axis *(left)* (0° rotation) and long-axis *(right)* (90° rotation) views on 2D echo *(top)* and with color flow imaging *(bottom)* are shown. The short-axis view shows flow filling the aorta *(Ao)* in systole. In the long-axis view, although the direction and velocity of flow are uniform *(arrow)*, the color displayed depends on the angle between the ultrasound beam and the flow direction. Lines for three ultrasound beam angles are shown in cyan *(1, 2, 3),* illustrating how the color changes from red for flow directed toward the transducer *(1),* to black where flow is perpendicular to the ultrasound beam *(2),* and then to blue where flow is directed away from the transducer *(3).*

of ultrasound artifacts. Continuous-wave (CW) and pulsed Doppler velocities should be recorded with the ultrasound beam aligned parallel to the flowstream. However, a parallel intercept angle is difficult to achieve given the constraints on transducer position from the TEE approach. As with transthoracic imaging, color Doppler is helpful for the evaluation of abnormal flow patterns even at nonparallel intercept angles.

## Aortic Valve

The aortic valve and LV outflow tract are imaged in the long-axis view from the high TEE probe position with rotation of the image plane to about 120° [\(Fig. 3.20\)](#page--1-47). A short-axis view of the aortic valve is obtained by rotating the image plane to about 45° (see [Fig. 3.13\)](#page--1-39). In the short-axis view, slight withdrawal of the probe shows the sinuses of Valsalva and left main coronary artery, whereas slight advancement provides a short-axis view of the LV outflow tract. In the 0° four-chamber view, the outflow and aortic valve also are seen by anterior angulation of the image plane (see [Fig. 3.5\)](#page--1-33) In both the short- and long-axis views, image quality is optimized by use of a high transducer frequency and adjustment of the depth, or use of zoom mode, to maximize the valve image.

3D images of the aortic valve are helpful in selected patients but can be challenging to acquire in views that are clinically diagnostic. Starting in the 2D short- or long-axis view of the aortic valve, a narrow-angle real-time 3D image is acquired either looking down at the aortic side of the valve or up at the LV side of the valve with the right coronary cusp at the bottom of the image [\(Fig. 3.21](#page--1-48)). A fullvolume 3D data set also is acquired and then cropped to display the aortic valve in long- or short-axis views.

Color flow imaging in long- and short-axis views of the valve allows evaluation for valvular regurgitation, including vena contracta width and the origin and direction of the regurgitant jet (see Chapter 12). A cross-sectional area of the aortic regurgitant jet can

be obtained by starting in a short-axis view of the aortic valve and slowly advancing the probe in the esophagus to obtain a short-axis view of the outflow tract.

Measurement of antegrade velocity across the aortic valve is limited by the nonparallel intercept angle between the ultrasound beam and the direction of blood flow from the TEE position. In some patients, a transgastric apical view allows recording of pulsed and CW Doppler flow velocities proximal to and across the aortic valve [\(Fig. 3.22\)](#page--1-49). However, caution still is needed in interpretation of the Doppler data because the intercept angle may be oblique. If aortic valve pathology is present, transthoracic recording of antegrade velocities is more accurate and should be performed in all cases.

## Mitral Valve

The mitral valve is evaluated by slow rotation from the TEE four-chamber view to the long-axis view with image recording at about 30° increments. Transducer depth is decreased to include just the mitral valve, transducer frequency is increased to improve image resolution, and the transducer position is centered relative to the valve annulus. The leaflets

When a high-velocity jet is suspected, careful angulation and positioning of the transducer are needed to obtain the highest velocity signal. Because of the constraints on transducer positioning, the possibility of velocity underestimation should be considered. *Ao,* Aorta.

and subvalvular apparatus are usually well seen in these views unless valve calcification with shadowing of distal structures is present. If additional views are needed, transgastric short-axis and two-chamber views of the mitral valve are obtained. The valve also is seen on the transgastric apical view, although image quality often is suboptimal at the depth of the mitral valve.

If the mitral valve is abnormal, 3D imaging is recommended. Real-time 3D imaging showing the LA aspect of the valve provides improved display of spatial relationships, with adequate temporal resolution. A full-volume zoomed 3D acquisition provides the best spatial and temporal resolution. Typically, cropped views show the ventricle and the atrial side of the valve, with the image oriented to show the aortic valve at the top of the image ([Fig.](#page--1-50) [3.23\)](#page--1-50).

The pattern of antegrade flow across the mitral valve (LV diastolic filling) is recorded with pulsed Doppler in the four-chamber or long-axis view at a parallel intercept angle ([Fig. 3.24](#page--1-51)). Because the flow is directly away from the transducer, the velocity curve with the typical early diastolic peak (E) and late diastolic peak (A) velocities is shown below the baseline. Transmitral flow also can be recorded from the transgastric apical approach, although signal strength is lower because of the greater depth of the mitral valve from this position.

Color Doppler is used to evaluate for mitral regurgitation as the image plane is slowly rotated from the four-chamber to two-chamber to long-axis view. The image plane that best shows the proximal jet geometry (proximal isovelocity acceleration and vena contracta) is used for quantitative measures of regurgitant severity, as discussed in Chapter 12. Split screen 2D and color imaging is used if the sector width encompasses the entire mitral annulus, but separate imaging and color Doppler data recordings are needed in some patients. Mitral regurgitation also is evaluated with CW Doppler from the upper esophageal position, using the color flow signal to align the CW Doppler beam with the vena contracta of the regurgitant jet ([Fig. 3.25](#page--1-52)). Color 3D imaging of the proximal jet geometry is an area of active research.

# Pulmonic Valve

The pulmonic valve and RV outflow tract are best imaged from an upper esophageal position at 0° rotation with a long-axis view of the pulmonary artery from the valve plane to its bifurcation. Doppler velocities are recorded from this position at a parallel intercept angle as flow is directed straight toward the transducer [\(Fig. 3.26](#page--1-53)). The pulmonic valve also is visualized in the 90° long-axis plane with the pulmonic valve seen in its perpendicular relationship with the aortic valve in the far field of the image (see [Fig. 3.11\)](#page--1-37). However, velocities cannot be recorded from this approach because of a nonparallel intercept angle. In some patients the pulmonic valve also can be imaged from the transgastric position either in the 90° image plane including the tricuspid valve or in a very anteriorly angulated apical four-chamber view.

# Tricuspid Valve

The tricuspid valve is well imaged in the standard four-chamber view, both from the TEE position and from the transgastric apical view. Other useful views include the TEE RV inflow view and the transgastric two-chamber view turned to show the right heart structures. In a transgastric view obtained close to the diaphragm, the entry of the coronary sinus into the RA adjacent to the tricuspid valve is seen. Further advancement of the transducer often allows a short-axis view of the tricuspid valve.

The tricuspid regurgitant jet is recorded from either TEE or transgastric views; however, underestimation of velocity should be considered given the limited ability to vary transducer position to ensure a parallel intercept angle. If high pulmonary pressures are suspected, transthoracic CW Doppler recordings or invasive measures of pulmonary pressure should be obtained.

**Fig. 3.23 3D imaging of mitral valve.** Anatomic views of the mitral valve *(top)* correspond to 3D volumetric images viewed from the LA side *(left)* and LV side *(right)* of the valve in diastole *(middle)* and systole *(bottom)*. The recommended orientation of 3D echo images of the mitral valve is with the aortic valve at the top of the image, as shown here. The three scallops of the anterior *(A)* and posterior *(P)* mitral leaflets are shown with the medial (*P3* and *A3*) scallops on the right side of the image and the lateral (*P1* and *A1*) scallops on the left side of the image.

**Fig. 3.24 Left ventricular inflow.** Pulsed Doppler is recorded with the sample volume positioned at the mitral leaflet tips from an anteriorly angulated TEE four-chamber view. The flow pattern is similar to a transthoracic recording of LV inflow, albeit inverted because the flow is directed away from the transducer.

**Fig. 3.26 Pulmonary artery flow.** A very upper TEE position provides a long-axis view *(top)* of the main pulmonary artery *(PA)* and its bifurcation into right and left pulmonary arteries. The ascending aorta *(Ao)* is seen in the short-axis view. This view allows recording of flow in the pulmonary artery at a parallel intercept angle because flow is directly toward the transducer *(bottom)*.

**Fig. 3.25 Continuous-wave Doppler recording of mitral regurgitation.** From a TEE four-chamber view *(left)*, color flow was used to identify the vena contracta of the regurgitant jet for the initial positioning of the CW Doppler *(CWD)* beam. Transducer position and angulation then were modified as needed to obtain a clear signal with the highest flow velocity. Even so, a higher velocity was obtained with a transthoracic dedicated CW Doppler transducer, immediately after the TEE examination *(right)*. *APX,* Apical; *MV,* mitral valve; *TTE,* transthoracic echocardiography.

# CHAMBER ANATOMY AND FILLING PATTERNS

## Left Ventricle

Standard views of the LV are obtained from the TEE position in four-chamber, two-chamber, and long-axis views [\(Table 3.4](#page--1-54)). A short-axis view is obtained from the transgastric position. These views allow qualitative assessment of LV size and overall systolic function. Regional ventricular function also can be evaluated for each myocardial segment with a high degree of interobserver reproducibility for grading of wall motion in standard segments. In the transgastric short-axis view, the wall segments are the same as in a transthoracic short-axis view, *except* that the entire image has been rotated approximately 180° clockwise. Compared with a transthoracic subcostal short-axis view, the image is rotated 90° clockwise (see Fig. 8.6). Biplane imaging allows faster acquisition of imaging data, but it can be challenging to optimize the image plane and endocardial definition in more than one 2D image at the same time [\(Fig. 3.27\)](#page--1-55).

LV volumes and ejection fraction can be measured on TEE from 2D four-chamber and two-chamber views. However, 3D calculation of LV volumes and ejection fraction is more accurate because foreshortening of the LV apex is avoided (see Chapter 6 and [Fig. 3.27\)](#page--1-55). Measurement of 3D LV volumes and ejection fraction is recommended on all TEE studies

**Fig. 3.27 Biplane imaging of the left ventricle.** From an upper esophageal probe position, a four-chamber *(left)* and twochamber *(right)* view are seen simultaneously using a three-beat full-volume 3D data acquisition. This view is used for qualitative evaluation of global and regional LV systolic function. This view also is useful to ensure correct positioning and adequate endocardial definition for quantitative measurement of ventricular volumes and ejection fraction, as shown in [Fig. 3.28](#page--1-56).

**Fig. 3.28 TEE measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction.** Ejection fraction *(EF)* can be measured on TEE using the apical biplane method by tracing endocardial borders at end-diastole and end-systole in four-chamber *(4C)* and two-chamber *(2C)* 2D views or by using semiautomated border detection with 3D imaging.

unless image quality is inadequate or clinical concerns prevent completion of the exam protocol. Additional modalities for evaluation of ventricular function, such as speckle tracking strain imaging, is helpful in selected cases (see Chapter 4).

# Left Atrium

The location and flow patterns of the pulmonary veins are readily assessed by TEE echocardiography [\(Fig. 3.28\)](#page--1-56). The flow pattern is most easily recorded in the left superior pulmonary vein, where the typical systolic and diastolic antegrade flows and the reversal after atrial contraction can be appreciated ([Fig. 3.30](#page--1-57)). Although flow tends to be more laminar with a narrow band on velocities on the spectral display in the left, compared with the right, superior pulmonary vein, flow patterns generally are similar in all four pulmonary veins. However, exceptions do occur as, for example, when mitral regurgitation is present. In this situation, the regurgitant jet is directed eccentrically, altering flow patterns in some, but not all, pulmonary veins.

If LA thrombus is suspected, the atrial appendage should be examined in at least two orthogonal views or using biplane imaging (see Chapter 15). Recognition of low flow (spontaneous contrast) and appendage thrombi is enhanced by use of a high transducer frequency (7 MHz) and zoom mode. Care is needed to distinguish normal trabeculation from localized thrombus formation. Trabeculae tend to be more linear and are continuous with the atrial wall in more than one view. Thrombi typically protrude into the appendage, often with independent motion.

The flow pattern in the LA appendage is recorded with pulsed Doppler ultrasound with the sample volume positioned in the appendage about 1 cm from the junction with the body of the LA. The normal flow pattern (see Fig. 15.21) is characterized by ejection of blood from the appendage following atrial contraction at a velocity >40 cm/s. Abnormal flow patterns are seen with atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and other tachyarrhythmias.

The interatrial septum is well seen in the standard four-chamber view and is evaluated in detail by centering the septum in the image and then slowly rotating the image plane from 0° to 120° while keeping the septum centered in the image plane. The fossa ovalis and primum septum are clearly demarcated, and the "flap valve" of a patent foramen ovale often is identified on 2D imaging, before confirmation with color Doppler or an intravenous contrast injection (see Fig. 15.28). 3D images of the interatrial septum are viewed from the LA side with the right upper pulmonary vein at the 1 o'clock position, or from the RA side with the superior vena cava at the 11 o'clock position. A full-volume multibeat 3D acquisition allows accurate measurement of the size and shape of the atrial septal defect from reconstructed correctly aligned images (see Chapter 17).

# Right Ventricle

As with transthoracic imaging quantitation of RV size and systolic function is difficult because of the complex geometry of this chamber. Qualitative assessment of size and function is made from the TEE four-chamber and transgastric short-axis views.

The left and right superior pulmonary views (*LSPV* and *RSPV*) enter the LA at a superior and anterior angle—on TEE the superior pulmonary venous flow is directed toward the TEE transducer, and the left and right inferior pulmonary veins (*LIPV* and *RIPV*) enter the atrium at a more posterior angle—on TEE the inferior pulmonary venous flow is directed horizontally in the image plane. The LAA is just inferior and anterior to the LSPV. *(Images courtesy James C. Lee.)*

# Right Atrium

The body of the RA is best imaged in the TEE four-chamber view. In addition, the TEE long-axis view of the RA, obtained with the image plane at 90° and the probe rotated toward the patient's right, allows visualization of the atrial appendage (with normal trabeculation) and the entrances of the superior and inferior vena cavae. Movement of the probe up in the esophagus allows evaluation of the cephalad extent of the superior vena cava, whereas movement toward the stomach provides additional views of the inferior vena cava.

The coronary sinus is identified in a posteriorly angled four-chamber view. The entry of the coronary sinus into the RA is best seen in the 0° image plane with the transducer positioned near the gastroesophageal junction and angulated superiorly.

## IMAGING SEQUENCE

A standard structured sequence of image acquisition on TEE imaging ensures evaluation with imaging in at least two orthogonal views and Doppler data, as appropriate, of:

- All four cardiac chambers
- All four heart valves
- The interatrial septum and LA appendage
- Both great arteries (aortic and pulmonary artery
- All major venous inflows (vena cavae and the four pulmonary veins) and
- The descending thoracic aorta

Although this sequence may need to be modified to focus immediately on an acute process in unstable patients or abbreviated in patients who do not tolerate the study, the time needed for a standardized study is relatively short, and these data can be acquired in most patients. A standardized examination ensures that unexpected findings are not missed and provides the data needed for subsequent review of findings in the patient.

The specific sequence used in each laboratory depends on patient populations and physicians' preferences. My preferred sequence starts with an upper TEE view at enough depth to image the LV in four-chamber, two-chamber, and long-axis views. Next, after optimizing the 2D image of the LV, a full-volume multibeat 3D acquisition is performed for calculation of LV volumes and ejection fraction.

Depth is then decreased to focus on 2D imaging of the mitral valve with rotation from the long-axis view back to the four-chamber view, recording images at 30° to 60° increments, with both 2D imaging and color Doppler to detect mitral regurgitation. If mitral regurgitation is present, color Doppler is used to visualize jet direction, measure vena contracta width and the proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) diameter, along with CW Doppler recording of the mitral regurgitant velocity signal, as detailed in Chapter 12. 3D imaging of the mitral valve is recommended with display of real-time zoom images from the LA and LV sides, as well as a full-volume acquisition for improved 3D image quality and off-line quantitative measurements. Antegrade mitral flow is recorded with pulsed and CW Doppler, if needed, for assessment of LV diastolic function (see Chapter 7) or mitral stenosis (see Chapter 11).

The aortic valve is imaged with 2D and color in the long-axis view. Then the probe is pulled back to show a larger extent of the ascending aorta. The aortic valve short-axis view is obtained with rotation of the image plane to 30° to 50°, again with 3D imaging if appropriate. Pulsed and CW Doppler evaluations of the aortic valve are challenging on TEE. Flow signals may be recorded from transgastric long-axis or apical views, but the possibility that velocities are underestimated must not be forgotten.

Next the pulmonary veins are identified using a combination of 2D and color flow imaging either at a rotation angle of 0° or 90°, by looking at first the left and then the right pulmonary veins. Pulsed Doppler flow should be recorded in at least one pulmonary vein but in more than one if mitral regurgitation or LV diastolic dysfunction is present.

The atrial appendage is visualized either at 90° rotation in the two-chamber view or by angulating superiorly from the 0° (four-chamber) image plane, using a high-frequency transducer and magnified views. Imaging of the atrial appendage is facilitated by biplane imaging, which allow simultaneous recording in two image planes. Atrial appendage flow is recorded with pulsed Doppler if needed.

The atrial septum is examined by centering the septum in the four-chamber view, with identification of the fossa ovalis. Then the image plane is slowly rotated to 90°, while keeping the septum centered in the image. Color flow imaging, either with split screen 2D/color or with separate image acquisition, while rotating back to 0° allows identification of a patent foramen ovale. If an atrial septal defect is present, 3D real-time zoom and full-volume imaging is recommended.

The RV and tricuspid valve are examined in the four-chamber view turned toward the right side and in a low TEE view. Tricuspid regurgitation with color flow imaging is evaluated in these views and in a short-axis view. CW Doppler recording of the tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity allows estimation of pulmonary systolic pressure. The superior and inferior vena cavae are seen in the 90° plane, which also shows the RA appendage.

The pulmonic valve typically is visualized in the 90° image plane and from an upper TEE 0° view with 2D imaging and color Doppler. Recording of antegrade flow in the pulmonary artery is possible from an upper TEE position.

In patients who tolerate transgastric passage of the probe, short-axis and two-chamber views of the LV are obtained. Apical transgastric views are optional, depending on the clinical indication.

After checking with the other medical professionals assisting with the procedure (e.g., the nurse and sonographer) to verify that all the needed data have been recorded, the probe is turned posteriorly to image the descending aorta in the short-axis view with both 2D imaging and color Doppler flow imaging. The probe is slowly withdrawn, keeping the descending aorta centered in the image plane and turning the probe to look down the aortic arch just before probe withdrawal. When aortic pathology is present, long-axis views or biplane images are recommended.

This basic examination is supplemented with additional 3D image acquisitions, additional views, and Doppler flows, depending on the specific clinical question. For example, a study to evaluate for patent foramen ovale also would include a right-sided saline contrast study. The findings on these basic views also may mandate further evaluation. For example, in a patient with endocarditis, findings consistent with a para-aortic abscess would lead to detailed examination for valve dysfunction and any intracardiac shunts or fistula.
