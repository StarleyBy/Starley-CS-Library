valuation of patients with suspected or documented coronary artery disease is one of the most common indications for echocardiography. Evaluation typically focuses on functional changes due to coronary artery narrowing or occlusion specifically systolic wall thickening and endocardial motion—rather than on direct imaging of the coronary arteries. Although the proximal left main and right coronary arteries often can be identified, even on transthoracic images, ultrasound imaging currently does not provide the detailed knowledge of distal vessel anatomy or the location and severity of coronary artery narrowing that is needed for patient management. Invasive coronary angiography remains the procedure of choice for direct assessment of coronary artery anatomy because diagnosis often is combined with interventional treatment. Computed tomographic (CT) coronary angiography provides an alternative approach in some clinical situations. E

However, echocardiography offers detailed functional assessment of segmental and global left ventricular (LV) systolic function both at rest and with stressors to induce ischemia. Functional assessment provides critical data for patient management. For example, stress echocardiography is a reliable approach for the initial diagnosis of coronary artery disease, especially in patients with a nondiagnostic stress electrocardiogram (ECG). Another example is the use of echocardiography in the emergency department for early diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in patients with equivocal ECG changes. In addition, the central role of echocardiography in evaluation for complications of acute myocardial infarction has long been recognized. Finally, echocardiography often provides important prognostic data in patients with coronary artery disease.

Coronary anatomy varies to some degree from patient to patient, but the overall pattern of coronary artery branching is relatively uniform ([Fig. 8.1\)](#page--1-32). The left main coronary artery arises from the superior aspect of the left coronary sinus of Valsalva and divides into (1) the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, which extends by the interventricular groove down the anterior wall to (and sometimes around) the LV apex; and (2) the circumflex (Cx) artery, which continues laterally in the atrioventricular groove. The right coronary artery (RCA) arises from the superior aspect

**Fig. 8.1 Normal coronary anatomy.** A computed tomographic reconstruction of the coronary arteries shows *(left)* the origin of the right and left coronary arteries from the aorta with the left ventricular chamber shown for orientation. The right coronary artery *(RCA)* gives rise to the posterior descending artery *(PDA)* in most people, although a few have the PDA arising from the distal circumflex coronary artery *(Cx).* With the heart chambers removed and the image rotated *(right),* the left main coronary artery bifurcates into the left anterior descending coronary artery *(LAD)* (with a septal branch) and the circumflex coronary artery, which branches into obtuse marginal branches. *(Images courtesy Dr. Kelley Branch.)*

of the right coronary sinus of Valsalva and extends inferomedially following the atrioventricular groove. Approximately 80% of patients have a *right-dominant* coronary circulation; the right coronary artery gives rise to the posterior descending artery (PDA), which lies in the inferior interventricular groove. In about 20% of patients the coronary circulation is *left dominant;*

the circumflex artery gives rise to the posterior descending artery.

Segmental wall motion abnormalities seen by echocardiography correspond closely to the coronary artery blood supply to the myocardium [\(Fig. 8.2](#page--1-33)). The left anterior descending artery supplies the anterior portion of the interventricular septum through septal

<span id="page-2-0"></span>Fig. 8.3 Segmental analysis of left ventricular endocardial motion and wall thickening. The LV is divided into three levels from base to apex, with wall segment nomenclature as shown. The apex segments are usually visualized from apical four-chamber, apical two-chamber, and apical three-chamber views. The apical cap can be appreciated only on contrast studies in some patients. (From Lang RM, Bierig M, Devereux RB, et al: Recommendations for chamber quantification: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography's Guidelines and Standards Committee and the Chamber Quantification Writing Group, developed in conjunction with the European Association of Echocardiography, a branch of the European Society of Cardiology.

perforating branches and the anterior wall through diagonal branches. The posterior descending artery supplies the inferior aspect of the ventricular septum and the inferior free wall. The lateral wall is supplied by obtuse marginal branches of the circumflex artery. The inferolateral (or posterior) LV wall may be supplied by extension branches from the right coronary artery or by obtuse marginal branches of the circumflex arteries. Marked individual variability is noted in the blood supply to the LV apex. In some cases, the left anterior descending artery extends around the apex to supply the apical segment of the inferior wall. In other cases, the posterior descending artery extends around the apex to supply the apical segment of the anterior wall. More commonly, the blood supply to the apex arises from both the left anterior descending and the posterior descending coronary arteries.

Standardized nomenclature for tomographic imaging of the heart allows consistency of terms, correlations among different imaging techniques, and a known relationship of each segment with coronary anatomy. Standard tomographic planes on echocardiography are short axis, long axis, four chamber, and two chamber. In each image plane, the LV is divided into three segments from base to apex—basal, mid-cavity, and apical—which correspond to proximal, middle, and apical lesions of the coronary arteries (Fig. 8.3). In a short-axis view, both at the basal (mitral valve) and mid-cavity (or papillary muscle) levels, the ventricle is divided clockwise, beginning with the interventricular groove, into six segments: the anterior wall, the anterolateral wall, the inferolateral (or posterior) wall, the inferior wall, the inferior septal wall, and the anterior septal wall. The apical region is divided into four segments because of the normal tapering of the ventricle toward the apex: anterior, lateral, inferior, and septal, with an additional segment for the tip of the apex. This results in a total of 17 myocardial segments. On standard echocardiographic imaging, the apical cap is difficult to visualize, so a 16-segment model typically is used in clinical practice. The location of wall motion abnormalities can be reported in two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) formats, descriptively, using colors to signify wall motion abnormalities or using more quantitative display formats.

The segmental wall motion abnormalities seen with ischemia or infarction correspond to the coronary anatomy as follows:

- 1. Left anterior coronary artery disease
  - Anterior septum
  - Anterior free wall, at the base and mid-cavity
  - Apical segments of the septum and anterior wall, plus the apical cap

Depending on the degree to which diagonal branches supply the lateral wall, the anterolateral wall also may be affected. If the left anterior descending artery extends around the apex, the affected area includes apical segments of the inferior and inferolateral walls. The location of the lesion along the length of the coronary artery affects the pattern of wall motion. A lesion in the distal third of the vessel affects only the apex, and a lesion in the mid-segment of the vessel affects the mid-cavity and apical segments, whereas a proximal lesion affects the entire wall including the basal segments.

- 2. Circumflex coronary artery disease
  - Anterolateral wall
  - Inferolateral (posterior) wall

Again the extent of segmental wall motion is related to the exact coronary anatomy in an individual patient. Echocardiography is particularly helpful in patients with circumflex artery disease because this myocardial region often is "silent" electrocardiographically and is not well seen on a single-plane right anterior oblique LV angiogram.

- 3. Posterior descending coronary artery disease
  - Inferior septum
  - Inferior free wall

If the posterior descending artery is a short vessel, the apex will not be affected, whereas extensive wall motion abnormalities of the apex may be seen if the posterior descending artery extends to supply the ventricular apex.

Other patterns of abnormal wall motion are seen with lesions of the branches of the three major coronary arteries. For example, isolated disease in a diagonal branch of the left anterior descending artery results in a discrete wall motion abnormality in the portion of the anterolateral wall supplied by that vessel. Proximal right coronary artery disease can result in ischemia or infarction of the right ventricular (RV) free wall.

Collateral vessels and previous coronary stenting or bypass surgery also affect the pattern of wall motion. If a myocardial segment has a balanced oxygen demand-to-supply ratio, wall motion will be normal whether blood flow is supplied antegrade by the native vessel, by collateral vessels, or by a bypass graft.

### Evaluation of Left Ventricular Wall Motion

### *Transthoracic Imaging*

Regional systolic function for each segment of the LV can be assessed on transthoracic imaging by combining data from multiple image planes or using 3D echocardiography.

With 2D imaging, standard views for evaluation of wall motion are ([Fig. 8.4](#page--1-34)):

- Short-axis (base, mid-LV, and apex) view
- Four-chamber view
- Two-chamber view
- Long-axis view

In the parasternal long-axis view, the basal and midventricular segments of the anterior septum and posterior LV walls are seen. In the parasternal shortaxis view, circumferential images of the LV at the base and midventricular levels are obtained. Note that if the transducer is angulated toward the apex from a fixed parasternal position, progressively more

**Fig. 8.4 Example of the standard image planes used for stress echocardiography.** These planes are apical four-chamber *(A4C),* apical two-chamber *(A2C),* apical long-axis *(A-long),* and parasternal short-axis *(SAX).* Images are acquired in a digital cine-loop format at each stress stage and are then re-sorted to show the baseline and peak stress images side by side for each view. Images are gated to show only systole, so that endocardial motion and wall thickening appear to occur in the same time frame, even though a substantial difference is present in heart rate between baseline and peak stress. Image depth is adjusted to show only the LV.

**Fig. 8.5 Effect of transducer angulation on left ventricle imaging.** Angulation of the transducer from a fixed parasternal position results in short-axis views that intersect similar segments of the septum but progressively more apical segments of the posterior wall. By moving the transducer apically, more parallel image planes can be obtained. *Ao,* Aorta.

<span id="page-4-0"></span>apical segments of the posterior wall are imaged while the *same* segment of the septum is included in the ultrasound image plane. A more parallel alignment between image planes is obtained by moving the transducer apically to obtain short-axis mid-cavity and (sometimes) apical views of the LV ([Fig. 8.5](#page-4-0)) or by using 3D imaging. The apical segments rarely are adequately visualized from the parasternal window or on transesophageal (TEE) images.

From the apical window, evaluation of LV wall motion is performed in four-chamber, two-chamber, and long-axis views. Detailed evaluation of the extent of abnormal myocardium is possible on 2D imaging by slow rotation of the image plane between the standard views. In the four-chamber view, the inferior septum and anterolateral wall are seen. Anterior angulation to include the aortic valve allows visualization of portions of the anterior septum. In the two-chamber view, the anterior and inferior free walls are seen. Endocardial and epicardial definition of the anterior wall often is difficult due to attenuation by adjacent overlying lung tissue. This problem can be alleviated by careful patient positioning and imaging during held respiration. In the apical long-axis view, the

<span id="page-4-1"></span>**Fig. 8.6 Comparison of parasternal, subcostal, and transesophageal echocardiography transgastric short-axis views of the left ventricle.** Correct identification of wall segments is facilitated by noting the position of the septum and the papillary muscles.

anterior septum and inferolateral (posterior) wall are seen (analogous to the parasternal long-axis view). Care is needed in positioning the transducer at the apex to avoid foreshortening of the ventricle from this approach. Integration of data from parasternal and apical approaches, while taking into account image quality in each view, allows assessment of each myocardial segment in at least two views. Evaluation from a subcostal approach also is helpful. In the subcostal four-chamber view, the inferior septum and anterolateral wall are imaged. In the subcostal short-axis view, the inferior and inferolateral (posterior) walls are nearest the transducer and the anterior and anterolateral walls are most distal [\(Fig. 8.6](#page-4-1)).

Real-time 3D multiplane or volumetric imaging from an apical approach has the potential to provide more rapid and complete assessment of wall motion.

With 3D echocardiography, wall motion is assessed using:

- Multiple simultaneous 2D views or
- 3D volumetric LV image

Simultaneous apical views at set angles of rotation or multiple parallel short-axis views can be generated from the 3D volume set, thus allowing rapid evaluation of wall motion in multiple myocardial segments on the same cardiac cycles. A limitation of apical volumetric scans is that the endocardium is imaged using the lateral, rather than axial, resolution of the ultrasound beam, and this limits identification of endocardial borders for quantitative analysis. The 3D volumetric image can be displayed in motion in a cine-loop format, with rotation of the image to show different wall segments. In addition to qualitative measures of wall motion, semiquantitative measures of timing and magnitude of wall motion can be displayed in a "target diagram" with the apex in the center and the base around the edges of the circular display ([Fig. 8.7](#page--1-35)).

When endocardial definition is suboptimal with either 2D or 3D imaging, opacification of the LV with leftsided contrast is recommended for evaluation or regional function [\(Fig. 8.8](#page--1-36)). Contrast to enhance endocardial border definition is recommended when two or more segments are poorly visualized with standard imaging and is particularly important for stress echocardiography to ensure detection of ischemic segments. Most laboratories find that contrast enhancement is needed for 30% to 50% of stress echocardiographic studies, depending on the patient population.

#### *Transesophageal Imaging*

When transthoracic images are inadequate, or in certain monitoring situations (e.g., intraoperative monitoring of LV function), regional LV function can be evaluated from a TEE approach. From the high left atrial (LA) position a four-chamber view of the LV is obtained (in the 0° plane of the TEE probe), showing the inferior septum and lateral wall. Rotating the image plane to approximately 60° provides a two-chamber view with visualization of the anterior and inferior walls, whereas further rotation to about 120° results in a long-axis view with imaging of the anterior septum and inferolateral (posterior) wall, although the exact

**Fig. 8.7 3D echocardiographic wall motion assessment.** Wall motion can be assessed based on 3D volume acquisition image planes corresponding to four-chamber *(A4C),* two-chamber *(A2C),* and short-axis *(SAX)* images. Wall motion is then displayed graphically on a cine or still image coded by color on the 3D LV reconstruction *(middle right),* as a graph of motion versus time with each segment shown in a different color *(bottom)*.

![](_page_5_Figure_12.jpeg)

**Fig. 8.8 Contrast enhancement of left ventricular endocardial borders.** This patient had suboptimal endocardial definition even with harmonic imaging and careful patient positioning. After intravenous injection of a left heart contrast agent, opacification of the LV chamber is seen with clear definition of the endocardial border, at rest *(left)* and with stress *(right)* in the apical four-chamber view, demonstrating inducible ischemia in the middle and apical inferior septum *(arrows)*.

degree of rotation to obtain these views varies slightly from patient to patient. Transducer position and angulation require adjustment as the image plane is rotated using anatomic landmarks to ensure proper alignment. Even with optimal technique these views are usually foreshortened; that is, the apparent apex represents an oblique plane through the anterolateral wall, whereas the true LV apex is not seen.

From the transgastric position, the transverse image plane provides short-axis views of the LV at the base (mitral valve) and mid-cavity (papillary muscle) levels. Rotation of the image plane at this position provides a two-chamber view, though the apex often is foreshortened. Further advancement of the probe allows acquisition of an "apical" four-chamber view (in the 0° plane) by flexing the probe tip. Often, the true apex is missed in this view because the LV apex does not lie on the diaphragm without intervening lung tissue in a position accessible from the transgastric approach.

With all TEE studies, a 3D volumetric image acquisition is recommended for measurement of LV volumes and ejection fraction, as well as assessment of regional wall motion.

TEE imaging of LV wall motion is indicated:

- For intraoperative assessment of global and segmental LV function
- In critically ill patients when transthoracic views are inadequate

TEE imaging also may be used with stress protocols, although this is not a routine approach.

### Sequence of Events in Ischemia

Irreversible myocardial damage (e.g., infarction) results in wall motion abnormalities that are present at rest. With an acute infarction, wall thickness is normal, but systolic wall thickening and endocardial motion are reduced or absent. An old myocardial infarction is characterized by thinning and increased echogenicity of the affected segments due to scarring and fibrosis, in addition to abnormal motion and absent wall thickening.

In contrast, ischemia is a reversible imbalance in the myocardial oxygen demand-to-supply ratio. Even with substantial coronary artery narrowing, blood flow is adequate for myocardial oxygen demands at rest. However, when the narrowing exceeds approximately 70% of the luminal cross-sectional area, blood flow becomes inadequate to meet increased myocardial oxygen demands with exercise, pharmacologic interventions, or mental stress, with resulting ischemia. When oxygen demand returns to baseline, blood flow again is adequate, ischemia resolves, and wall motion returns to normal. Thus wall motion *at rest* is normal in patients with coronary artery disease if no prior myocardial infarction occurred.

The sequence of changes as a region of myocardium becomes ischemic is as follows [\(Fig. 8.9\)](#page--1-37). The first detectable changes associated with heterogeneity of flow to the LV are biochemical, followed by a significant perfusion defect (detectable by radionuclide and magnetic resonance techniques). Next, regional myocardial dysfunction, characterized by both abnormal diastolic function and impaired systolic wall thickening, occurs in rapid succession (within a few cardiac cycles). Ischemic ST-segment depression on ECG and clinical angina are relatively late manifestations of ischemia and are not seen consistently. Echocardiography, by detecting abnormal regional wall motion, provides a useful noninvasive method for evaluating ischemia that is more sensitive than ECG given this sequence of events. Echocardiography differs from radionuclide techniques in that the functional consequences of ischemia, rather than the pattern of myocardial perfusion, are assessed.

**Fig. 8.9 Schematic diagram of the sequence of events in myocardial ischemia.** The level of stress is shown on the horizontal axis, often estimated by the heart rate *(HR)* × blood pressure *(BP)* product, with the degree of ischemia shown on the vertical axis. With a 70% coronary artery narrowing *(blue),* ischemia begins when the stress level results in inadequate coronary blood flow to that region of myocardium. As ischemia increases, the sequence of events is shown. With rest *(downward blue arrow),* these events reverse unless the duration of ischemia is long enough to cause infarction. The onset and slope of the ischemic response are earlier and steeper with more severe coronary stenosis (as shown for a 90% lesion), and they are later and less steep with milder coronary disease (as shown for a 50% stenosis).

### Evaluation of Global and Regional Ventricular Function

Global LV systolic function can be evaluated either qualitatively or quantitatively in patients with coronary artery disease by using the approaches described in Chapter 6. Because the pattern of LV dysfunction typically is *not* uniform, it is important that qualitative and quantitative evaluation be based on multiple tomographic views or 3D imaging. In patients with coronary artery disease, LV ejection fraction measurement provides essential clinical data because it is an essential variable in clinical decision making.

Segmental (or regional) LV systolic function most often is evaluated using a semiquantitative scoring system based on 2D or 3D imaging. The endocardial motion for each defined myocardial segment is graded as normal, hypokinetic, akinetic, dyskinetic, or aneurysmal [\(Table 8.1\)](#page--1-38). Some clinicians prefer to subclassify the degree of hypokinesis as mild, moderate, or severe, but such a subclassification often has significant interobserver and intraobserver variability. Ischemia results both in a decrease in the total amplitude and velocity of endocardial motion and wall thickening and in a delay in the onset of contraction and relaxation. Some centers use a numeric scoring system for wall motion from 1 (normal) to 4 (dyskinetic) for each segment. An overall wall motion score index can be derived by dividing the sum of scores for each segment by the number of segments evaluated:

Wall motion score Sum of individual segment scores Number o <sup>=</sup> f segments visualized (Eq. 8.1)

Several more sophisticated approaches to quantitation of wall motion have been proposed based on the total amplitude of endocardial motion, the extent of wall thickening, the velocity of myocardial motion, or the timing of the onset of contraction. Quantitative evaluation of regional function based on imaging the myocardium requires:

- Identification of the endocardial border at enddiastole and end-systole
- Evaluation of wall motion for all segments of the myocardium
- Knowledge of the degree of variability of normal wall motion
- Correction for the effects of LV translation, rotation, and torsion
- High temporal resolution for analysis of the onset and velocity of myocardial thickening

Approaches that incorporate 3D reconstruction of the LV improve data acquisition times and diminish the effects of cardiac motion that potentially result in imaging different regions of myocardium in systole versus diastole for a given tomographic plane. Although wall thickening or the timing and velocity of motion may be more sensitive methods for evaluation of regional ventricular function, most current approaches continue to rely on endocardial motion.

Contrast now is routinely used to enhance endocardial definition with improved reliability for detection of abnormal wall motion; typically contrast is needed in about one half of stress echo studies. Other promising techniques include (1) contrast echocardiography for evaluation of myocardial perfusion and (2) tissue Doppler or speckle tracking strain and strain rate imaging [\(Fig. 8.10](#page--1-39)). However, these newer approaches are not commonly used in clinical practice because evidence to show improved diagnostic accuracy or better prediction of clinical outcomes is inadequate (see Suggested Reading and Chapter 4).

### MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA

Because echocardiographic wall motion at rest is normal in a patient with significant coronary artery disease and no prior myocardial infarction, imaging *during ischemia* is needed for diagnosis. Inducing ischemia during echocardiographic imaging is referred to as *stress echocardiography.* Ischemia can be induced by increasing myocardial oxygen demand either with exercise or by pharmacologic interventions [\(Table 8.2\)](#page--1-40).

### Basic Principles of Stress Echocardiography

Stress echocardiography is based on the concept that an increased cardiac workload is needed to elicit signs of physiologic dysfunction in many types of cardiac

disease. For example, in patients with coronary artery disease, resting myocardial blood flow is adequate, so myocardial function, seen on echocardiography as wall thickening and endocardial motion, is normal at rest. However, when cardiac workload is increased, the increased oxygen demands of the myocardium cannot be balanced by an increase in flow in the coronary artery, with resulting ischemia with impairment of myocardial thickening and endocardial motion [\(Fig. 8.11](#page--1-19)). An increase in cardiac workload typically is achieved by having the patient exercise, either on a supine bicycle or an upright treadmill, or by infusion of a pharmacologic agent, such as dobutamine, that increases heart rate and blood pressure. In addition to echocardiographic imaging, key elements in interpretation of stress test results include the:

- Duration of exercise
- Maximum workload—approximated by multiplying heart rate by systolic blood pressure
- Symptoms
- Blood pressure response
- Arrhythmias
- ST-segment changes on ECG

The basic principles of image acquisition for stress echocardiography are to use standard image planes, ensure that all myocardial segments are visualized in at least one (and preferably two) views, use comparable views at rest and stress, and record images in a digital cine-loop format with side-by-side display of rest and stress images. The cine-loop format is essential because otherwise the change in heart rate between rest and stress makes interpretation of wall motion difficult.

For evaluation of regional ventricular function, optimal endocardial definition is essential. When endocardial definition remains suboptimal despite careful patient positioning, use of harmonic imaging and other imaging adjustments, contrast echocardiography, or a nonechocardiographic imaging approach should be considered.

**Fig. 8.11 Concept of stress echocardiography.** This schematic illustrates a patient with a 70% stenosis in the proximal third of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). At rest (*left*), endocardial motion and wall thickening are normal. After stress (*right*), either exercise or pharmacologic, the middle and apical segments of the anterior wall become ischemic, showing reduced endocardial wall motion and wall thickening. If the LAD extends around the apex, the apical segment of the posterior wall also will be affected, as shown here. The normal segment of the posterior wall shows compensatory hyperkinesis. *Ao,* Aorta.

The sensitivity of stress echocardiography for detection of coronary disease depends on acquiring stress images at the maximal cardiac workload. With pharmacologic stress testing, this is rarely an issue because the stress level can be maintained until image acquisition is complete. However, with exercise stress, the workload declines rapidly on cessation of exercise, so that images must be acquired as quickly as possible after exercise. Both the time from stopping exercise and the heart rate at the time of image acquisition compared with maximum heart rate are recorded as indicators of workload. 3D echocardiographic acquisition systems that allow simultaneous real-time imaging in multiple image planes offer the promise of faster acquisition times at peak stress, with the potential for improved diagnostic sensitivity [\(Fig. 8.12\)](#page--1-41).

### Exercise Echocardiography

Exercise echocardiography typically is performed using standard exercise test protocols. Supine or upright bicycle exercise protocols have the advantage that echocardiographic imaging can be performed during exercise at each progressive level of exertion, including maximal exercise. Treadmill exercise protocols have the advantage that a higher total workload can be achieved but the disadvantage that imaging can be performed only after exercise. Wall motion abnormalities that resolve very rapidly after exercise may be missed.

Resting images are acquired in digital cine-loop format for standard views of the LV. Standard exercise protocols are used with monitoring of the 12-lead ECG, blood pressure, and symptoms by a qualified medical professional during and following the exercise protocol. The risks of exercise echocardiography are the risks of the exercise test itself. Either during

maximal exercise (supine or sitting bicycle) or immediately after exercise (treadmill), digital cine-loop image acquisition is repeated. The patient exercises to maximum capacity rather than a target heart rate because accuracy is highest with a high workload. Heart rate starts to decline immediately on stopping exercise; thus all four standard poststress images should be acquired as quickly as possible (within 90 seconds) after exercise, and heart rate at the time of image acquisition should be displayed on the screen. Typically, four or more sequential cycles are recorded digitally, and the examiner subsequently chooses the best image for comparison with the baseline views [\(Fig. 8.13\)](#page--1-42). This allows elimination

of poor-quality images due to respiratory motion. Next, the rest and exercise cine-loop digital images are displayed side by side so that endocardial motion and wall thickening for each myocardial region can be compared.

Interpretation of an exercise stress echocardiogram includes incorporation of data on the maximum workload achieved (exercise duration), the heart rate and blood pressure response to exercise, the presence of arrhythmias, and clinical symptoms, as well as evaluation of the echocardiographic images. A systematic approach, comparing each segment in turn, is needed for detection of subtle abnormalities [\(Fig. 8.14](#page--1-43)).

## Dobutamine Stress Echocardiography

#### *Evaluation for Ischemia*

Pharmacologic stress testing with intravenous dobutamine is based on the increased heart rate and contractility induced by this potent beta-agonist. Dobutamine is started at a low dose (5 µg/kg/min) and increased incrementally every 3 minutes with a calibrated intravenous infusion pump to (10, 20, 30, and 40 µg/kg/min) until the maximum dose or an endpoint has been reached. Atropine is used as needed, in divided doses of 0.25 to 0.5 mg (maximum total 2.0 mg), to achieve the target goal of 85% of the patient's maximum predicted heart rate. To minimize the likelihood of significant adverse effects and to

**Fig. 8.14 Abnormal exercise echocardiogram.** Compared with rest images, this study shows development of apical akinesis *(arrows)* with exercise. End-systolic images are shown at rest on the *left* and immediately after exercise on the *right* in the apical four-chamber *(A4C)* view *(top)* and the apical two-chamber *(A2C)* view *(bottom).* Regional function was normal at rest, with normal endocardial motion and wall thickening in all segments. With stress, the apical inferior septum and inferior wall become akinetic, consistent with inducible ischemia in the distal left anterior descending coronary artery territory.

optimize the quality of the data obtained, a dobutamine stress echocardiography examination requires a well-defined study protocol performed in the appropriate clinical setting.

Patient monitoring during dobutamine stress echocardiography includes:

- Periodic blood pressures (usually every 2 to 3 minutes)
- Continuous ECG monitoring
- Careful observation for clinical symptoms or signs

Appropriate equipment, medications, and trained personnel should be immediately available in the event of an adverse effect, including a cardiac defibrillator, emergency cardiac medications, intravenous esmolol (a beta-blocker that counteracts the effects of dobutamine), and a qualified physician.

After an intravenous line for administration of the dobutamine has been placed, the patient is positioned in a left lateral decubitus position on an echo-stretcher with an apical cutout to allow optimal image acquisition throughout the study protocol. Initially the intravenous line is filled only with saline solution while resting data are obtained. Data collection at baseline, at each dosage level, and during recovery includes heart rate, blood pressure, symptoms, a 12-lead ECG, and echocardiographic images ([Fig.](#page--1-44) [8.15\)](#page--1-44). Standard views include parasternal short-axis images at the base and mid-cavity levels and apical four-chamber, two-chamber, and long-axis images with digital image acquisition in each view or with 3D image acquisition at each stage. Some centers also record Doppler LV filling and ejection velocities at each stage of the stress protocol.

![](_page_11_Figure_9.jpeg)

**Fig. 8.15 Flow chart of dobutamine stress echo protocol.**

Endpoints for stopping the test are:

- Reaching the maximum protocol dose
- Patient's discomfort
- A definite wall motion abnormality involving two or more adjacent segments
- ST-segment elevation on ECG
- Reaching 85% of maximum predicted heart rate for age
- A systolic blood pressure >200 or <100 mmHg *or* a diastolic blood pressure >120 mmHg, or
- Significant ventricular arrhythmias

Although serious complications are uncommon when appropriate precautions are observed, reported adverse effects include anxiety, tremulousness, palpitations, arrhythmias, paresthesias, and chest pain. About 10% of patients have premature atrial or ventricular beats, and up to 4% of patients experience nonsustained supraventricular or ventricular tachycardia. Because the purpose of the test is to induce ischemia, some patients have either echocardiographic changes or ECG evidence of ischemia and may experience angina. However, the frequency of angina may be less than with standard ECG stress testing because the protocol can be stopped as soon as wall motion abnormalities are seen (which often is before angina occurs). Hypotension occurs in up to 10% of patients because of peripheral β2-receptor–mediated vasodilation, but unlike hypotension with exercise testing, it is *not* a predictor of severe coronary disease or a worse prognosis. Overall, the risk of myocardial infarction or ventricular fibrillation is about 1 in 2000 studies. Contraindications to dobutamine stress echocardiography include unstable angina, uncontrolled hypertension, or sensitivity to dobutamine.

The echocardiographic images are interpreted after reformatting the digital images, with each quadrant of the screen showing a different stress stage ([Fig. 8.16](#page--1-45)). For each myocardial segment, wall motion is compared on matched images in a systematic fashion. Because wall thickening and endocardial motion normally increase with dobutamine, an abnormal test result is defined as the observation of hypokinesis or akinesis in a region that had normal wall motion at rest [\(Fig. 8.17\)](#page--1-46).

### *Evaluation for Myocardial Viability*

In addition to detection of ischemic myocardium, dobutamine stress echocardiography has been proposed as a method to evaluate for myocardial viability in regions that are "stunned" or "hibernating." For example, after treatment of myocardial infarction with thrombolytic therapy, the extent of residual viable myocardium in the area at risk may be unclear early after the event because of myocardial "stunning." Alternatively, a patient with chronic coronary artery disease may have hypokinesis or akinesis at baseline due to "hibernating" myocardium, which may recover

**Fig. 8.16 Normal dobutamine stress echocardiography.** The standard display format shows the apical four-chamber view at end-systole at baseline, low-dose (5 µg/kg/min) dobutamine, high-dose (40 µg/kg/min) dobutamine, and recovery images. This example shows the end-systolic images in the apical four-chamber *(A4C)* view *(top)* and the apical two-chamber *(A2C)* view *(bottom)* at baseline and at peak dose dobutamine.

**Fig. 8.17 Abnormal dobutamine stress echocardiographic study.** Baseline images *(top)* at end-systole in an apical four-chamber view *(left)* and apical two-chamber view *(right)* are compared with peak dose (40 µg/kg/min dobutamine plus 0.5 mg atropine) end-systole images on the *bottom*.

with revascularization. In both these settings, echocardiographic imaging during low-dose (5 to 10 µg/ kg/min) dobutamine infusion has been reported to show improved wall thickening and endocardial motion in viable segments of the myocardium. Of course, at higher dobutamine doses, worsening of regional function may occur due to induction of ischemia. This pattern of initial improvement at low dose, with subsequent worsening of myocardial function at higher dobutamine doses, is referred to as a *biphasic response*.

### Other Stress Modalities

Vasodilators (dipyridamole or adenosine) have been proposed for echocardiographic stress testing by some investigators based on the differential pattern of coronary blood flow induced by these agents: increased blood flow in normal coronary arteries with a *relative* decrease in blood flow in diseased vessels. Overall success with this approach has been higher with nuclear perfusion imaging because the difference in blood flow between regions supplied by normal versus abnormal coronary arteries can be seen on the radionuclide images. Results with echocardiographic imaging have been less consistent because actual ischemia (not just a relative difference in blood flow) is needed to discern a wall motion abnormality. In patients with a permanent pacemaker, atrial pacing to achieve the target heart rate is another option.

### Limitations and Technical Aspects

Stress echocardiography has high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of significant coronary artery disease. In addition, it allows reliable definition of the anatomic location and extent of ischemic myocardium. However, stress echocardiography does have potential technical and physiologic limitations:

- Endocardial definition
- Cardiac and respiratory motion
- Inadequate stress or workload
- Abnormal resting LV function

Assessment of endocardial wall motion and wall thickening requires adequate delineation of the endocardium for each myocardial segment. Careful attention to patient positioning, transducer orientation, and image-processing parameters can improve image quality, but definition of certain segments, particularly the anterior wall, is difficult in some individuals due to adjacent lung tissue. Contrast agents that opacify the LV after intravenous administration should be used to enhance detection of regional wall motion abnormalities when endocardial definition is suboptimal.

Exercise and postexercise imaging can be limited by respiratory interference due to a rapid respiratory rate. Digital acquisition in cine-loop format of several cycles, followed by selection of the best images, is necessary for correct interpretation. The possible effects of cardiac translation and rotation, both between systole and diastole and between baseline and stress, should be considered in comparisons of wall motion. The interpretation of a stress echocardiographic study includes a description of image quality as an indicator of the reliability of these results. Suboptimal images should be interpreted with caution.

Potential physiologic limitations are related to the fact that abnormal wall motion occurs only *during* ischemia. First, if the "stress" used does *not* induce ischemia, no wall motion abnormality will be seen even if significant coronary disease is present. For example, a patient with limited exercise duration due to hip pain will not achieve a level of exertion that results in ischemia. Similarly, a pharmacologic "stress" that does not induce ischemia will not induce a wall motion abnormality. Second, the duration of ischemia is important. If ischemia has resolved by the time imaging is performed, the wall motion abnormality will not be detected. This is of particular concern with treadmill exercise because echocardiographic imaging is performed after exertion, although this possible limitation is offset by the higher maximum workload achieved before the recovery period compared with bicycle exercise protocols.

Stress echocardiography in patients with abnormal global or regional function at rest is more difficult to interpret than in subjects with normal resting LV systolic function. The presence of a segmental motion abnormality at rest implies that coronary artery disease, with prior myocardial infarction, is present. With stress imaging, new wall motion abnormalities in regions remote from the site of resting abnormal wall motion indicate additional areas of ischemia. Evaluation of areas adjacent to the resting wall motion abnormality is problematic due to a potential tethering effect by the abnormal region. In patients with global systolic dysfunction at rest—which may be due to end-stage ischemic disease, cardiomyopathy, or chronic valvular disease—stress echocardiography is less specific for the diagnosis of coronary disease.

### Alternate Approaches

In patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease, the choice of stress and imaging modality depends on patient-related factors and on the specific clinical question. Optimally, the method of stress is chosen to allow an adequate workload in that patient with pharmacologic testing used in patients who cannot exercise to a maximal workload due to orthopedic, neurologic, pulmonary, or other conditions. The choice of imaging modality is based on image quality in each patient and the type of information needed [\(Table 8.3](#page--1-48)).

The origins of the right and left coronary arteries often can be identified on transthoracic imaging [\(Fig.](#page--1-47) [8.18](#page--1-47)). On TEE imaging the proximal left coronary can be followed to its bifurcation into left anterior descending and circumflex arteries ([Figs. 8.19](#page--1-49) and [8.20](#page--1-50)),

and often these branches can be imaged for a portion of their length, as can the right coronary artery. However, clinical decision making usually requires detailed knowledge of the entire extent of the coronary anatomy. Ultrasound imaging is a suboptimal method for evaluation of the relatively small coronary vessels that move with the epicardial surface of the heart.

- Detection of coronary artery disease
- Assessment of the area of myocardium at risk
- Risk stratification after myocardial infarction
- Evaluation after revascularization
- Detection of myocardial viability

Stress echocardiography is particularly useful for detection of coronary artery disease in specific patient groups, including:

- Women with chest pain symptoms or cardiac risk factors, or both
- Patients after heart transplantation
- Patients being considered for renal transplantation
- Patients undergoing vascular surgery

Stress echocardiography also can be used to evaluate changes in cardiac hemodynamics including valve gradients and areas, regurgitant severity, and pulmonary pressures. As discussed in Chapters 11 and 17, echocardiography is used in patients with valvular or congenital heart disease for evaluation of changes with stress in:

- Aortic valve gradient and area in calcific aortic stenosis
- Mitral regurgitant severity in myxomatous mitral valve disease
- Pulmonary pressures in mitral stenosis or regurgitation
- Aortic coarctation pressure gradients
- Dynamic outflow obstruction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

#### *Diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease*

The accuracy of stress echocardiography for diagnosis of significant coronary artery disease is highly dependent on image quality, specifically endocardial definition, with most investigators reporting success rates for obtaining diagnostic images after treadmill exercise of 85% to 100% in their patients. The success rate for image acquisition and the quality of the images obtained tend to be greater with supine exercise (in which the patient can be positioned optimally) and with pharmacologic stress (which has the added advantage of little increase in respiratory interference).

Compared with coronary angiography, with significant disease defined as 50% narrowing of an epicardial coronary artery, exercise echocardiography has an overall sensitivity of 74% to 97% and a specificity of 64% to 100% for diagnosing the presence of coronary artery disease (see Appendix B, Tables B.6 and B.7). Sensitivity is highest for multivessel disease (>90%) and lowest for single-vessel disease (60% to 80%) in these studies. In comparison, exercise ECG had a much lower sensitivity at 51% to 63% and specificity at 62% to 74%, whereas exercise thallium-201 perfusion imaging tends to have an accuracy similar to that of echocardiography, with a sensitivity of 61% to 94% and a specificity of 81%.

#### *Extent and Location of Ischemic Areas*

When image quality is adequate, stress echocardiography also allows accurate evaluation of the location and extent of the area of ischemic myocardium. By integrating data from multiple views or using 3D imaging, a reasonable estimate of the location of significant coronary lesions can be made. Echocardiographic estimates of which and how many coronary arteries are affected correlate well with angiographic findings.

### *Prognostic Implications*

The relationship between stress echocardiographic results and clinical outcome has been evaluated in several studies and in a meta-analysis (Appendix B, Tables B.8 and B.9). In patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease, a normal stress echocardiogram has a 98% negative predictive value for myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death over the next 3 years. Interpretation of a stress test depends on the pretest likelihood of disease, including clinical risk factors such as age, sex, diabetes, smoking, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. In addition, indicators of a higher likelihood of an adverse outcome with exercise echocardiography, as with all exercise stress tests, include exercise capacity, exercise-induced angina, and the blood pressure response to exercise. However, echocardiographic images provide additional prognostic information, with the key predictors of clinical outcome including resting wall motion abnormalities, ejection fraction, and the extent of ischemia. Similarly, with dobutamine stress, echocardiography provides incremental value with resting wall motion and evidence of inducible ischemia predicting cardiovascular events.

### MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION

### Basic Principles

Acute coronary syndrome includes patients presenting with acute chest pain due to transient rest ischemia (unstable angina), those with non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and those with ST-elevation (or transmural) myocardial infarction. Pathologically, myocardial infarction is defined as irreversible injury to the myocardium due to prolonged ischemia, usually secondary to acute thrombotic occlusion of an epicardial coronary artery at the site of an atherosclerotic plaque. Initially the affected myocardium becomes akinetic, with normal wall thickness. Over time (4 to 6 weeks), an un-reperfused ST-elevation myocardial infraction results in a definite area of akinesis and wall thinning. A non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction results in a lesser degree of wall thinning and in hypokinesis rather than akinesis. However, in the current era, the extent of myocardial damage in patients presenting with an acute coronary syndrome depends on the speed and success of reperfusion therapy. A corresponding range of findings is seen on echocardiography, with the extent of wall motion abnormalities ranging from a large transmural infarction to a nearly normal LV.

### Echocardiographic Imaging

The myocardial segments affected and the echocardiographic views for assessment of myocardial infarction are the same as described for [myocardial](#page--1-5) [ischemia](#page--1-5). An occlusion of the left anterior descending artery results in akinesis of the anterior septum, anterior free wall, and apex [\(Fig. 8.21](#page--1-45)). Imaging in parasternal long-and short-axis views and in apical views demonstrates these segmental wall motion abnormalities. In the acute setting [\(Fig. 8.22](#page--1-51)), the unaffected walls are hyperkinetic. Overall LV systolic function typically is moderately depressed with an average ejection fraction of 41 ± 11% after an un-reperfused anterior myocardial infarction due to a proximal left anterior descending artery occlusion.

Occlusion of the posterior descending artery results in an inferior myocardial infarction with akinesis of the inferior septum, the inferior free wall, and (to a variable extent) the inferolateral (posterior) wall. Parasternal and apical views again are used. The subcostal approach is particularly helpful in patients with poor image quality from parasternal and apical windows. Typically, overall LV systolic function is only mildly depressed, with an average postinfarction ejection fraction of 53 ± 10% after an un-reperfused inferior infarction. With inferior infarction the echocardiographer also should evaluate for possible concurrent RV infarction.

Occlusion of the circumflex artery, resulting in a lateral myocardial infarction, is less common and often is electrocardiographically "silent." Akinesis of the anterolateral and posterolateral walls is seen, with a mild to moderately depressed ejection fraction depending on the extent of myocardium supplied by the circumflex artery in that individual.

Note that these "classic" patterns of wall motion abnormalities vary with individual variation in coronary anatomy and the location of the occlusion along the length of the coronary artery. Also, these patterns are altered by the use of reperfusion therapy.

In acute myocardial infarction, diastolic function, as well as systolic function, is abnormal. Acutely, diastolic relaxation is impaired with normalization over the subsequent 1 to 2 weeks when reperfusion is successful. With late or ineffective reperfusion resulting in a large infarction, an initial pattern of impaired relaxation is followed by pseudo-normalization of diastolic filling with a high *E* velocity reflecting an increased LV end-diastolic pressure. In patients with moderate to severely reduced systolic function, the *E/A* ratio correlates positively with LV end-diastolic and LA pressures (i.e., a higher *E/A* ratio indicates a higher LV end-diastolic pressure) due to the overriding effect of LA pressure on the early diastolic filling velocity. It is most helpful to interpret patterns of LV diastolic filling in a patients with coronary artery disease over time with side-by-side comparisons of the echocardiographic findings and integration with other clinical data (see Chapter 7).

### Limitations and Alternate Approaches

As for other applications of echocardiography, image quality can be a limiting factor in patients with poor ultrasound tissue penetration. However, with optimal patient positioning, an experienced sonographer, and a state-of-the-art instrument, diagnostic images can be obtained in nearly all patients.

The standard approach to the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction includes two of the following three findings:

- A typical clinical presentation
- Diagnostic ECG changes
- A consistent pattern of elevation in serum cardiac enzyme levels

When typical findings of acute myocardial infarction are present, the diagnosis rarely is in doubt. Unfortunately, many patients have an atypical clinical presentation, and ECG changes often are nondiagnostic.

Radionuclide imaging for acute myocardial infarction is based on the principle of detection of areas of hypoperfusion. The finding of a normal radionuclide perfusion pattern in patients presenting with chest pain has a high specificity for the absence of acute myocardial infarction. Sensitivity for acute infarction is lower because an old infarction cannot be distinguished from an acute infarction with this approach.

Noninvasive computed tomographic imaging of the coronary arteries is useful for screening for coronary disease in patients undergoing other cardiac surgery or with a low pretest likelihood of disease.

Invasive coronary angiography remains the standard of reference for identification of an occluded coronary artery. Concurrent left ventriculography can identify wall motion abnormalities. The current standard of care for acute myocardial infarction includes percutaneous coronary revascularization, so most patients go directly to the catheterization laboratory at the time of presentation.

### Clinical Utility

### *Diagnosis in the Emergency Department*

In a patient presenting to the emergency department with chest pain and a nondiagnostic ECG, echocardiographic assessment of global and segmental wall motion can be helpful in clinical decision making. The presence of a segmental wall motion abnormality indicates that coronary artery disease is present—which may be acute infarction, unstable angina, or an old infarction. Associated hyperkinesis of uninvolved

**Fig. 8.22 Acute anterior myocardial infarction.** Comparing the apical four-chamber view in diastole *(top)* and systole *(bottom)* demonstrates the akinetic septum *(arrows),* although the myocardium is not yet thinned and scarred, as in the old infraction shown in [Fig. 8.21.](#page--1-45)

segments suggests an acute event. Many emergency departments now use point of care ultrasound devices for this indication.

Because ischemic myocardium also is akinetic in a patient with chest pain, echocardiography cannot distinguish acute infarction from ongoing ischemia. Normal wall motion implies that no ischemia was present *at the time* the images were acquired. Thus normal wall motion *between* episodes of chest pain does not exclude a diagnosis of unstable angina. In patients presenting with chest pain, a nondiagnostic ECG, and normal cardiac enzymes, some clinical centers now use exercise echocardiography to allow triage to further inpatient versus outpatient evaluation.

### *Evaluation of Interventional Therapy*

In a patient with a definite myocardial infarction by clinical and ECG criteria, echocardiography allows assessment of the location and extent of "myocardium at risk." Once reperfusion therapy has been initiated, echocardiography can be used to assess its effects. However, a several-day time lag often occurs between successful reperfusion and normalization of wall motion ("stunned" myocardium), so evaluation is most meaningful just before hospital discharge or at outpatient follow-up. Prolonged persistence of wall motion abnormalities that can be reversed by reperfusion also can occur—termed *hibernating myocardium.* Echocardiographic imaging at rest cannot distinguish between these conditions because it shows the regional myocardial function at the time imaging is performed. In patients with postinfarction chest pain, echocardiography helps separate those with recurrent ischemia, and new wall motion abnormalities, from those with postinfarction pericarditis or noncardiac chest pain. At long-term follow-up after myocardial infarction, echocardiography allows assessment of global ventricular function and long-term ventricular dilation due to infarct expansion.

#### *Myocardial Viability*

Distinguishing irreversibly infarcted myocardial from viable myocardium that might benefit from reperfusion therapy is important in clinical decision making. Akinesis or hypokinesis at rest may be due to myocardial stunning or hibernation rather than to irreversible myocardial damage. Viable myocardium shows an increase in wall thickening and endocardial motion in response to low-dose (5 to 10 µg/kg/min) dobutamine. At higher dobutamine doses, myocardium supplied by a patent coronary artery shows further enhancement of myocardial thickening, whereas ischemia with hypokinesis or akinesis is seen when significant coronary stenosis is present. This biphasic response—wall motion improvement at low-dose and worsening at high-dose dobutamine—identifies areas of myocardium likely to benefit from percutaneous or surgical reperfusion, even late after myocardial infarction, with a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 78%. Factors that affect the response to dobutamine include:

- Extent of viable tissue
- Degree of residual coronary stenosis
- Extent of collateral coronary blood flow
- Tethering from adjacent segments
- Medical therapy

### *Mechanical Complications of Myocardial Infarction*

Echocardiography is the procedure of choice for initial evaluation of the post–myocardial infarction patient with a new systolic murmur [\(Table 8.5\)](#page--1-52) with a differential diagnosis of:

- Mitral regurgitation
- Ventricular septal defect
- Ventricular rupture with pseudoaneurysm formation

Most commonly, the etiology of the murmur is *mitral regurgitation* due to papillary muscle dysfunction, abnormal wall motion of the segment underlying a papillary muscle, or papillary muscle rupture. The presence and severity of mitral regurgitation are evaluated using Doppler techniques (see Chapter 12), and the etiology is inferred from 2D or 3D imaging. Ischemic mitral regurgitation typically results from failure of adequate coaptation of the anterior leaflet against a tethered posterior leaflet resulting in a posteriorly directed regurgitant jet. Partial or complete rupture of the papillary muscle is a catastrophic complication that can be recognized as a flail leaflet with an attached mass (the papillary muscle head) that prolapses into the LA in systole ([Fig. 8.23](#page--1-53)). TEE imaging is indicated when this diagnosis is suspected unless the diagnosis is clear on transthoracic images.

Another cause of a new systolic murmur after myocardial infarction is a *ventricular septal defect* due

TEE images in an oblique long-axis view more clearly show the septal defect *(arrow)* with color flow across the septum.

to necrosis and rupture of a focal area of the interventricular septum ([Fig. 8.24](#page-22-0)). Identification of the rupture site is difficult with 2D imaging, especially because this complication tends to occur with *small* infarcts, so the wall motion abnormality may be subtle. Evaluation with Doppler ultrasound establishes the diagnosis, with a high-velocity left-to-right systolic jet recorded with continuous-wave Doppler ultrasound and systolic turbulence on the RV side of the septum recorded with conventional pulsed Doppler or color flow imaging.

When *ventricular rupture* occurs in the free wall of the LV (instead of in the septum), the mortality rate is extremely high due to extravasation of blood into the pericardial space and acute pericardial tamponade. However, some patients have a temporary respite due to containment of the rupture by pericardial adhesions or by thrombosis at the rupture site. In these patients, echocardiography may establish the diagnosis, thus prompting emergency surgery ([Fig.](#page--1-54) [8.25](#page--1-54)). Echocardiographic clues of ventricular rupture (in the appropriate clinical setting) include a diffuse or localized pericardial effusion and a discrete segmental wall motion abnormality. Occasionally, the site of rupture can be visualized on 2D imaging, and rarely, flow from the ventricle into the pericardial space can be demonstrated with Doppler techniques.

A chronic, contained ventricular rupture is called a *pseudoaneurysm* ([Fig. 8.26](#page--1-55)). An LV pseudoaneurysm has a wall composed of pericardium (no myocardial fibers). Characteristic features are:

- An abrupt transition from normal myocardium to the aneurysm
- An acute angle between the normal myocardium and aneurysm
- A narrow "neck" at the site of rupture

![](_page_23_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 8.25 Left ventricular pseudoaneurysm.** The apical two-chamber view shows acute rupture of the basal inferior LV wall after myocardial infarction. An abrupt discontinuity in the LV wall *(arrow)* is noted, with flow in and out of a thrombus-lined section of the pericardium. Rapid diagnosis allowed surgical intervention in this patient.

**Fig. 8.26 Schematic diagram of a pseudoaneurysm versus a true aneurysm.**

- A ratio of the "neck" diameter to the maximum diameter <0.5
- Partial filling of the aneurysm with thrombus

Often, flow into and out of the pseudoaneurysm is seen, and clinically, a corresponding apical murmur may be appreciated on auscultation. Although longterm survival has been described occasionally in patients with a pseudoaneurysm, correct echocardiographic diagnosis is essential. Surgical repair usually is recommended given a high likelihood of spontaneous rupture.

Other complications of acute myocardial infarction include:

- Pericardial effusion
- RV infarction
- LV aneurysm
- LV thrombus

A *pericardial effusion* also can be seen after myocardial infarction as a nonspecific response to transmural infarction. This effusion may be asymptomatic or associated with clinical symptoms (chest pain) and signs (ECG changes) of acute pericarditis. Although usually benign, an effusion may be complicated by tamponade physiology.

*RV infarction* may accompany an inferior infarction of the LV. Echocardiographic findings include RV hypokinesis or akinesis with variable degrees of RV dilation. With ECG leads placed on the right chest (in a mirror image pattern to the normal positions), ST-segment elevation may be seen, but this finding is not as sensitive or specific as echocardiographic features.

**Fig. 8.27 Apical aneurysm.** The end-diastolic image *(left)* shows increased echogenicity and thinning of the basal two thirds of the septum with dilation (e.g., a diastolic contour abnormality; *arrows*) of the apex. The end-systolic image *(right)* shows persistent apical dyskinesis (*arrows*). No obvious thrombus is noted, but evaluation with a higher-frequency transducer and oblique views is needed.

Longer-term complications of acute myocardial infarction include aneurysm formation, LV thrombi, and the sequelae of the irreversible decrease in LV systolic function. An *LV aneurysm* is defined echocardiographically as a dyskinetic region with a diastolic contour abnormality ([Fig. 8.27\)](#page--1-56). Apical aneurysms are most common, but inferior-basal aneurysms also are seen. Note that a "true" LV aneurysm, unlike a "false" aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm, is lined by (thinned) myocardium. A smooth transition is seen from normal myocardium to the thinned area, with an obtuse angle between the aneurysm and body of the LV. The ratio of the diameter of the junction between the aneurysm and the remainder of the LV to the maximum aneurysm diameter is >0.5.

*LV thrombi* form in regions of stasis of blood flow, such as in an apical aneurysm or overlying an area of akinesis in other regions of the LV. Evidence of severely reduced overall ventricular function, an aneurysm, an akinetic area, and the appearance of a spontaneous contrast effect in the LV all increase the likelihood of LV thrombus formation. Only rarely (as in hypereosinophilic syndrome) do ventricular thrombi occur in the absence of an underlying wall motion abnormality.

A thrombus is identified as an area of increased echogenicity within the ventricular chamber, distinct from the endocardium (see Fig. 15.18). Often, the thrombus protrudes into the chamber with a convex contour, but laminated thrombus with a concave contour following the endocardial curve also can be seen. Care is needed to distinguish a thrombus from prominent apical trabeculation with a false tendon or "web" traversing the apex of the LV chamber (see Fig. 15.1).

Diagnosis of apical thrombi is enhanced by using a 5-MHz transducer (improved near-field resolution), sliding the transducer laterally from the apical window, and then angulating it medially and superiorly to obtain a short-axis view of the apex. These procedures allow clear definition of the apical endocardium in most individuals. However, if images are suboptimal, appropriate interpretation should indicate that a thrombus "cannot be excluded," especially if the patient is at high risk of LV thrombus formation. Note that TEE imaging is less helpful for this diagnosis because the apex often is not fully visualized and is in the far field of the image plane.

### END-STAGE ISCHEMIC CARDIAC DISEASE

### Differentiation From Other Causes of Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction

The diagnosis of coronary artery disease is clear in patients with definite segmental wall motion abnormalities that correspond to the distribution of coronary blood flow. In end-stage ischemic disease, repeated transmural and subendocardial infarctions result in a diffuse pattern of abnormal wall thickening and endocardial motion. Thus when global systolic dysfunction is present, it is difficult to differentiate between end-stage ischemic disease and systolic dysfunction due to long-standing valvular disease or dilated cardiomyopathy ([Fig. 8.28\)](#page--1-54).

![](_page_25_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 8.28 End-stage ischemic heart disease versus dilated cardiomyopathy.** Although the 2D images are superficially similar, the patient with ischemic disease (A) has apical dilation and dyskinesis, thinning and brightness of the septum due to prior infarction *(arrowheads),* and a cardiac implanted electronic device lead in a relatively normal right heart. (B) The patient with dilated cardiomyopathy has more diffuse and severe four-chamber enlargement and biventricular dysfunction.

### Echocardiographic Approach

Several features of the echocardiographic examination help in this differentiation. The segmental pattern of LV wall motion is examined carefully in each tomographic plane. Although patients with dilated cardiomyopathy often have a somewhat asymmetric pattern of wall motion with relative preservation at the ventricular base, definite areas of akinesis or wall thinning suggest ischemic disease. The degree of reduction in overall ventricular function (ejection fraction) is important in patient management but does not assist in determining the etiology of disease.

RV size and systolic function are normal in patients with ischemic disease unless they have had a previous RV infarction. Dilated cardiomyopathy occasionally affects the two ventricles in differing degrees but most often results in a symmetric pattern of RV and LV dilation and reduced systolic function.

Mitral valve regurgitation typically accompanies both dilated cardiomyopathy and end-stage ischemic disease due to one of several mechanisms, including mitral annular dilation, reduced papillary muscle systolic function, or malalignment of the papillary muscles. LV dilation and systolic dysfunction *due to* chronic mitral regurgitation, in contrast to mitral regurgitation due to ventricular dilation and dysfunction, usually are associated with anatomic abnormalities of the mitral leaflets themselves (e.g., myxomatous or rheumatic disease).

Pulmonary artery pressures are elevated to variable degrees in patients with LV dysfunction of any etiology, due to chronic elevation in LV end-diastolic pressure. Pulmonary pressures can be estimated from the tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity or from the pulmonary artery systolic velocity curve, as described in Chapter 6. Mild degrees of tricuspid valve regurgitation are common in ischemic disease, but moderate or severe regurgitation usually is a response to chronic pulmonary hypertension or chronic RV dilation and systolic dysfunction.

Note that aortic regurgitation is *not* a consequence of LV dilation or systolic dysfunction. LV dilation typically does not result in an increase in the diameter of the aortic annulus or adjacent outflow tract. The finding of moderate or severe aortic regurgitation implies primary valvular disease or aortic root dilation.

LV thrombi are possible with severe LV dysfunction of any etiology. The observation of reduced systolic function should prompt a search for apical thrombi, but this finding does not help in the differential diagnosis.

### Limitations and Alternate Approaches

If a diagnosis of end-stage ischemic disease versus a primary cardiomyopathy would alter patient management, coronary angiography will be needed for a definitive diagnosis, to document the exact site and severity of coronary lesions, and to assess the distal vessel anatomy. Other useful approaches include computed tomographic coronary angiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging for visualization of coronary anatomy and identification of myocardial scar.

These definitions are unchanged from prior documents. The standard reference for cardiac displays is defined as the long axis of the LV. The names used for image planes are short axis (90° to long axis), vertical long axis (apical two-chamber plane), and horizontal long axis (four-chamber plane). Myocardial segments are defined at the basal and midventricular level as (clockwise from the anterior septal insertion) as anterior, anterolateral, inferolateral, inferior,*
- *inferoseptal, and anteroseptal. There are four apical segments (anterior, septal, inferior, and lateral).*

Technical details of contrast preparation and injection and instrument settings can be used in laboratory imaging protocols. Practical advice is provided for dealing with common artifacts seen with contrast including swirling, shadowing, and inadequate chamber opacification.*
