# <span id="page-0-1"></span>Tomographic Imaging

Echocardiography provides tomographic images of cardiac structures and blood flow, analogous to a thin "slice" through the heart. Two-dimensional (2D) echocardiographic images provide detailed anatomic data in a given image plane, but complete evaluation of the cardiac chambers and valves requires integration of information from multiple image planes. Small structures that traverse numerous tomographic planes (e.g., the coronary arteries) are difficult to evaluate fully. In addition, structures move in and out of the imaging plane as a result of motion caused by cardiac contraction or respiratory movement of the heart within the chest. Respiratory variation in cardiac location is recognized easily by its timing, but any movement of the heart during the cardiac cycle is more problematic because it is not obvious on the 2D image. Cardiac motion relative to surrounding structures is described in three dimensions as:

- Translation (movement of the heart as a whole in the chest)
- Rotation (circular motion around the long axis of the left ventricle [LV])
- Torsion (unequal rotational motion at the apex versus the base of the LV)

Even if the 2D image plane is fixed in position, the location of underlying structures varies between systole and diastole. For example, in the apical fourchamber view, adjacent segments of the LV (often supplied by different coronary arteries) might be seen in systole versus diastole. Compared with tomographic imaging, three-dimensional (3D) imaging provides a wider field of view that provides more intuitive cardiac images, but it has poorer resolution and a slower frame rate and is affected by respiratory and cardiac motion, as is 2D imaging (see Chapter 4). Thus, both modalities are used together as appropriate during the echocardiographic study.

# Nomenclature of Standard Views

Each tomographic image is defined by its acoustic *window* (the position of the transducer) and *view* (the image plane) [\(Table 2.1\)](#page--1-47). The standard three orthogonal echocardiographic image planes are determined by the axis of the heart itself (with the LV as the major point of reference), rather than by skeletal or external body landmarks ([Fig. 2.1\)](#page--1-48). The primary reference points on the heart are the apex, defined

**Fig. 2.1 Basic image planes used in transthoracic echocardiography.** The long-axis view *(purple arrow)* extends from the LV apex through the aortic valve plane. The short-axis view *(red arrow)* is perpendicular to the long-axis view, thus resulting in a circular view of the LV. The two-chamber *(blue arrows)* and four-chamber *(green arrow)* views are each about 60° rotation from the long-axis view, and both are perpendicular to the short-axis view. The four-chamber view includes both ventricles and both atria. The two-chamber view includes the LV and LA. *Ao,* Aorta; *DA,* descending thoracic aorta; *LAA,* LA appendage; *RVOT,* RV outflow tract.

as the tip of the LV, and the base, defined by the plane of the atrioventricular (e.g., mitral and tricuspid) valves. The four standard image planes are:

- *Long-axis plane:* Parallel to the long axis of the LV, with the image plane intersecting the LV apex and center of the aortic valve, aligned with the anterior-posterior diameter of the mitral annulus
- *Short-axis planes:* A series of image planes perpendicular to the long axis of the ventricle and resulting in circular cross-sectional views of the LV, mitral valve, and aortic valve
- *Four-chamber plane*: An image plane from apex to base, perpendicular to the short-axis view, that includes both ventricles and atria, aligned with the medial-lateral diameter of both the mitral and tricuspid annulus
- *Two-chamber plane:* An image plane from apex to base that includes the LV and left atrium (LA), perpendicular to the short-axis view, and rotated to be midway between the long-axis and four-chamber views

In addition to apical versus basal, other standard directional terms are medial versus lateral (the horizontal axis in a short-axis or four-chamber view) and anterior versus posterior (the vertical axis in a short-axis or long-axis view). This standard terminology also applies to visualization of cardiac anatomy with 3D echocardiography.

Acoustic windows are transducer positions that allow ultrasound access to the heart. The bony thoracic cage and adjacent air-filled lung limit acoustic access, thereby making patient positioning and sonographer experience critical factors in obtaining diagnostic images. Transthoracic images typically are obtained from parasternal, apical, subcostal, and suprasternal notch acoustic windows. The transducer motions used to obtain the desired view are described as follows [\(Fig. 2.2](#page--1-49)):

- *Move* the transducer to a different position on the chest.
- *Tilt or point* the transducer tip with a rocking motion to image different structures in the same tomographic plane.
- *Angle* the transducer from side to side to obtain different tomographic planes somewhat parallel to the original image plane.
- *Rotate* the image plane at a single position to obtain intersecting tomographic planes.

# Image Orientation

Most laboratories follow the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) guidelines for image orientation in adults, although some pediatric cardiologists use alternate formats. The recommended orientation

![](_page_2_Picture_16.jpeg)

**Fig. 2.2 Transducer motion.** This example, using a left parasternal transducer (T) position, demonstrates: *Tilt*: The transducer is "rocked" to provide images (*A* or *B*) in the same tomographic plane. *Angle*: Different image planes (perpendicular to the plane of the figure at lines *A, B,* and *C*) are obtained by angulation of the transducer. *Rotation*: The transducer is "twisted" with a circular motion to provide a different image plane while maintaining the same orientation between the transducer itself and the chest wall. *Ao,* Aorta; *PA,* pulmonary artery.

is with the transducer position (narrowest portion of the sector scan) at the top of the screen so that structures closer to the transducer are at the top of the image and structures farther from the transducer are at the bottom of the image. Thus, a transthoracic four-chamber view is displayed with the apex at the top of the image (because it is closest to the transducer), whereas a transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) four-chamber view is displayed with the apex at the bottom of the image (because it is most distant from the transducer). This orientation aids in prompt recognition of ultrasound artifacts, shadowing, and reverberations because the display of the origin of the ultrasound signal is the same for all acoustic windows and image planes.

In short-axis views, lateral cardiac structures are displayed on the right side of the screen, with medial structures on the left side, as if the viewer is looking from the apex toward the cardiac base. In long-axis views, basal structures (e.g., the aortic valve) are shown on the right and apical structures on the left, as if the viewer is looking from the patient's left side. The four-chamber plane is displayed with lateral structures on the right side of the screen and medial structures on the left side (as for the short-axis view); thus with normal cardiac anatomy the LV is on the right side of the screen and the right ventricle (RV) is on the left side.

# Examination Technique

A diagnostic echocardiographic examination is performed by a physician or by a trained cardiac sonographer under the supervision of a qualified physician. Point of care ultrasound studies also are performed by other health care providers within a defined scope of practice. Guidelines and recommendations for education and training in echocardiography for cardiologists, anesthesiologists, sonographers, and other health care providers have been published, as referenced in Chapter 5.

At the time of a transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) examination, relevant clinical data, prior imaging studies, and the indications for the study are reviewed. Blood pressure is recorded along with age, height, and weight. The patient is positioned comfortably for each view in either a left lateral decubitus or supine position. Electrocardiographic (ECG) electrodes are attached for display of a single lead (usually lead II) to aid in timing cardiac events. Specially designed echocardiographic examination stretchers provide apical cutouts for optimal transducer positioning at the apex. The transducer is applied to the chest and upper abdomen by using a water-soluble gel to obtain good contact without intervening air. The time needed to perform an echocardiographic examination depends on the specific clinical situation from a few minutes in a critically ill patient to document cardiac tamponade to more than 1 hour to quantitate multiple lesions in a patient with complex valvular or congenital heart disease.

# Technical Quality

Image quality depends on the degree of ultrasound tissue penetration, transducer frequency, instrument settings, and the sonographer's skill. Ultrasound tissue penetration or "acoustic access" to the cardiac structures is largely determined by body habitus, specifically how the heart is positioned relative to the lungs and chest wall. Conditions that increase transducer distance from the heart (e.g., adipose tissue), decrease ultrasound penetration (e.g., scar tissue), or interpose air-containing tissues between the transducer and the heart (e.g., chronic lung disease, recent cardiac surgery) all lead to poor image quality. TEE images tend to show better definition of cardiac structures given the shorter distance between the transducer and the heart, the absence of interposed lung, and the use of a higher transducer frequency. On transthoracic studies, optimal patient positioning for each acoustic window brings the cardiac structures against the chest wall. In addition, respiratory variation can be used to the sonographer's advantage by having the patient suspend breathing briefly in whichever phase of the respiratory cycle yields the best image quality. Unfortunately, even with careful attention to examination technique, echocardiographic images remain suboptimal in some patients.

# Echocardiographic Image Interpretation

The physician uses the tomographic 2D echocardiographic images to build a mental 3D reconstruction of the cardiac chambers and valves or uses a 3D echocardiographic data set to examine anatomy in specific image planes (see Chapter 4). To do this, an understanding of image planes and orientation and the technical aspects of image acquisition (e.g., in recognizing artifacts) is needed, along with a detailed knowledge of cardiac anatomy [\(Table 2.2](#page--1-50)). Recording images as the tomographic plane is moved between standard image planes is important for this analysis and ensures that abnormalities lying outside or between our arbitrary "standard" views are not missed. 3D imaging is helpful for elucidating anatomic relationships in complex cases and aids in identifying the optimal 2D image planes for display of abnormal findings. Information obtained from anatomic imaging then is integrated with physiologic Doppler data and clinical information in the final echocardiographic interpretation.

## TRANSTHORACIC TOMOGRAPHIC VIEWS

Normal echocardiographic anatomy is described in this section for each tomographic view. The best views for specific cardiac structures are indicated in [Table 2.3](#page--1-51).

space, adjacent to the sternum, a long-axis view of the heart is obtained that bisects the long axis of both aortic and mitral valves [\(Figs. 2.3](#page--1-52) and [2.4](#page--1-53)). In this standard view, the *aortic sinuses,* sinotubular junction, and proximal 3 to 4 cm of the ascending aorta are seen; further segments of the ascending aorta are visualized by moving the transducer cephalad one or two interspaces. The term "aortic root" often is used to refer to the entire proximal aorta including the annulus, sinuses, sinotubular junction, and ascending aorta. The upper limit of normal for aortic enddiastolic dimension in adults is 1.6 cm/m2 at the annulus and 2.1 cm/m2 at the sinuses.

**Fig. 2.4 Normal parasternal long-axis 2D echo images.** (A) End-diastolic and (B) end-systolic images show the anatomic features seen in [Fig. 2.3](#page--1-52). In addition, the descending thoracic aorta *(DA)* is seen posterior to the LA. *Ao,* Aorta.

In the long-axis view, the right coronary cusp of the *aortic valve* is anterior and the noncoronary cusp is posterior (the left coronary cusp is lateral to the image plane). In systole, the thin aortic leaflets open widely, assuming a parallel orientation to the aortic walls. In diastole, the leaflets are closed, with a small obtuse closure angle between the two leaflets. The leaflets appear linear from the closure line to the aortic annulus because of the hemicylindrical shape of the closed leaflets (linear along the length of the cylinder, curved along its short axis). In normal young individuals, the leaflets are so thin that only the apposed portions at the leaflets' closure line may be seen. The 3D anatomy of the attachment line of the aortic leaflets to the aortic root is shaped like a crown with the three commissures attached near the tops of the sinuses of Valsalva and the mid-portion of each leaflet attached near the base of each sinus [\(Fig. 2.5](#page--1-54)). The fibrous continuity between the aortic root and the anterior mitral leaflet (absence of intervening myocardium) helps identify the anatomic LV in complex congenital disease.

The anterior and posterior *mitral valve* leaflets appear thin and uniform in echogenicity, with chordal attachments leading toward the medial (or posteromedial) papillary muscle seen in the long-axis view, although the papillary muscle itself is slightly medial to the long-axis plane. The anterior mitral leaflet is longer than the posterior leaflet but has a smaller annular length so that the surface areas of the two leaflets are similar ([Fig. 2.6](#page--1-55)). As the mitral leaflets open in diastole, the tips separate, and the anterior leaflet touches or comes very close to the ventricular septum. In systole, the leaflets coapt, with some overlap between the leaflets (apposition zone) and a slightly obtuse (>180°) angle relative to the mitral annulus plane.

**Fig. 2.5 Aortic valve anatomy.** Schematic diagram in a frontal view with the aortic root "opened" between the left *(L)* and noncoronary *(N)* cusps by cutting through the anterior mitral leaflet *(AML)* to demonstrate the crown-shaped "annulus." The commissures are near the top of each sinus, and each leaflet has a hemicylindrical shape so that the closed leaflets appear as a straight line in the long-axis view. Each aortic leaflet has a coaptation *(COAPT)* zone, with overlap between adjacent leaflets and a thicker region, the nodule of Arantius, at the center of each cusp. The close anatomic relationships of the aortic valve with the interventricular septum *(IVS),* membranous septum, mitral valve, and LA can be appreciated. *R,* Right coronary cusp.

**Fig. 2.6 Mitral valve anatomy.** The mitral valve apparatus includes the leaflet, annulus, chordae, and papillary muscles *(m.).* The anterior mitral leaflet attaches to a smaller portion of the circumference of the annulus than the posterior mitral leaflet, but the anterior leaflet is longer. The posterior leaflet consists of three segments designated the medial *(M),* central *(C),* and lateral *(L)* scallops. Both leaflets attach to both the medial and lateral papillary muscle.

The chordae normally remain posterior to the plane of leaflet coaptation in systole. Some normal individuals have systolic anterior motion of the chordae resulting from mild redundancy of chordal tissue that is not associated with hemodynamic abnormalities. This must be distinguished from the pathologic systolic anterior motion of the mitral leaflets seen in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The mitral annulus (the attachment between the mitral leaflets, LA, and LV) is an anatomically well-defined fibrous structure shaped like a bent ellipse, with the more apical major axis bisected in the four-chamber view and the more basal minor axis bisected in the long-axis view.

The *left atrium* is seen posterior to the aorta and has an anteroposterior diameter similar to that of the aortic sinuses in normal adults. The *right pulmonary artery* lies between the proximal ascending aorta and the superior aspect of the LA but usually is not well seen on transthoracic images in adults. The *coronary sinus* is seen in the atrioventricular groove posterior to the mitral annulus. Dilation of the coronary sinus resulting from a persistent left superior vena cava (which can be confirmed by echo-contrast injection in a left arm vein if needed) is seen in about 0.4% of studies; it is an isolated incidental finding in about half of these cases and is associated with congenital heart disease in the remainder.

Posterior to the LA, the *descending thoracic aorta* is seen in cross section. A long-axis view of the descending thoracic aorta can be obtained by rotating the transducer counterclockwise. The oblique sinus of the pericardium lies between the LA and the descending thoracic aorta so that a pericardial effusion can be seen between these two structures, whereas a pleural effusion is seen only posterior to the descending thoracic aorta.

The *left ventricle* septum and posterior wall are seen at the base and mid-ventricular level in the long-axis view, thus allowing assessment of wall thickness, chamber dimensions, endocardial motion, and wall thickening of these myocardial segments. LV enddiastolic and end-systolic measurements of wall thickness and internal dimensions are made in the long-axis view on 2D images from the septal to posterior wall tissue-blood interface or using a 2D-guided M-mode recording when a perpendicular alignment can be obtained (see Chapter 6). From the parasternal window, the LV apex is not seen; the apparent "apex" usually is an oblique image plane through the anterolateral wall.

A portion of the muscular *right ventricular outflow tract* is seen anteriorly. Unlike the symmetric prolate ellipsoid shape of the LV, the RV does not have an easily defined long or short axis. In effect, the RV is "wrapped around" the LV, with an inflow region, an apical region, and an outflow region forming a somewhat anteroposteriorly flattened U-shaped structure. Most standard image planes result in oblique tomographic sections of the RV, so right ventricular size and systolic function are best evaluated from multiple views or with 3D imaging, as discussed more fully in Chapter 6.

#### *Right Ventricular Inflow and Outflow Views*

In the long-axis plane, the transducer is moved apically and then angulated medially to obtain a view of the *right atrium, tricuspid valve,* and *right ventricle* [\(Fig. 2.7](#page--1-48)). In this RV inflow view, the septal and anterior leaflets of the tricuspid valve are well seen. The RV apex is heavily trabeculated, whereas the outflow tract (supracristal region) has a smoother endocardial surface. The moderator band, a prominent muscle trabeculation that traverses the RV apex obliquely and contains the right bundle branch, is seen in both parasternal and apical views [\(Fig. 2.8](#page--1-56)). The papillary muscles are more difficult to identify in the RV than in the LV. Typically, two principal papillary muscles (anterior and posterior) are seen, with a smaller supracristal (or conus) papillary muscle. The moderator band attaches near the base of the anterior RV papillary muscle.

The *coronary sinus* is identified as it enters the right atrium (RA) adjacent to the tricuspid annulus. By

**Fig. 2.7 Right ventricular inflow view.** The position of the image plane is shown in the 3D heart *(top left)*, which is opened and rotated to the position corresponding to the echocardiographic image plane *(top right)*. 2D images in diastole *(bottom left)* and systole *(bottom right)* in the standard orientation show the RV and RA, tricuspid valve, and ostia of the coronary sinus *(CS)* and inferior vena cava *(IVC).* In this view, two tricuspid leaflets are seen, typically the anterior *(arrow)* and septal leaflets, but the posterior leaflet may be seen depending on the exact image plane and individual variation. *MB,* Moderator band.

slowly scanning back to an LV long-axis view, the coronary sinus can be followed along its length.

Another normal anatomic feature of the RA (Fig. 2.9) is the *crista terminalis*, a muscular ridge that courses anteriorly from the superior vena cava to the inferior

vena cava and divides the trabeculated anterior portion of the RA from the posterior, smooth-walled sinus venosus segment. The RA appendage is rarely seen on transthoracic imaging, but it is a trabeculated protrusion of the RA that extends anterior to the RA free wall and base of the aorta.

**Fig. 2.10 Aortic valve short-axis view.** (A) Parasternal short-axis view at the aortic valve level showing the relationship between the three cusps of the aortic valve—right coronary cusp *(R),* noncoronary cusp *(N),* left coronary cusp *(L)*—and the LA, RA, RV outflow tract *(RVOT),* and pulmonary artery *(PA).* The positions of the right coronary artery *(RCA),* left main coronary artery *(LMCA),* superior vena cava *(SVC),* pulmonic valve *(PV),* and tricuspid valve *(TV)* are shown. 2D echocardiographic images at the aortic valve level in (B) diastole and (C) systole. Note the three open leaflets of the aortic valve in systole. The left coronary cusp *(arrow)* can be difficult to visualize due to the parallel orientation of the open leaflet relative to the ultrasound beam. *LAA,* LA appendage.

The *inferior vena cava* is seen entering the RA inferior to the coronary sinus. In some individuals, a prominent Eustachian valve is seen at the junction of the inferior vena cava and RA both in this view and from the subcostal window. When a more extensive fenestrated valve is present, it forms a Chiari network extending from the inferior to the superior vena cava, attached to the crista terminalis posteriorly and the fossa ovalis medially, with a netlike structure that appears as bright mobile echo densities in the RA. Both these findings are considered normal variants.

The interatrial septum is not well seen in the RV inflow view, being just inferior and parallel to the image plane. However, careful angulation between the long-axis and RV inflow views allows examination of the atrial septum with recognition of the thick primum septum at its junction with the central fibrous body, the thin fossa ovalis in the central portion of the atrial septum, the ridge-like limbus located superior to the fossa, and the ridge adjacent to the junction with the coronary sinus.

Moving the transducer toward the base and then angulating laterally, a long-axis view of the RV outflow tract, *pulmonic valve,* and pulmonary artery is obtained. This view is particularly useful for recording flow velocities in the RV outflow tract and pulmonary artery.

#### *Short-Axis Views*

Short-axis views are obtained from the parasternal window by rotating the transducer clockwise 90° and then moving or angulating the transducer superiorly or inferiorly to obtain specific image planes.

At the *aortic valve* level [\(Fig. 2.10\)](#page--1-58), the short-axis view demonstrates all three aortic valve leaflets: right, left, and noncoronary cusps. In systole, the aortic leaflets open to a near-circular orifice. In diastole, the typical Y-shaped arrangement of the coaptation lines of the leaflets is seen with three points of aortic attachment, or commissures. Identification of the number of aortic valve leaflets (or commissures) is made most accurately in systole because a bicuspid valve may appear trileaflet in diastole as a result of a raphe in the larger leaflet but the presence of only two commissures in systole. The normal valve leaflets are thin at the base with an area of thickening on the ventricular aspect in the middle of the free edge of each cusp that serves to fill the space at the center of the closed valve. These nodules normally enlarge with age (nodules of Arantius) and can have small, mobile filaments attached on the ventricular surface (Lambl excrescences). These small but normal structures may be seen when echocardiographic images are of high quality and should not be mistaken for pathologic conditions. The origins of the left main and right coronary arteries often can be identified in this view.

The aortic and pulmonic valve planes normally lie perpendicular to each other. Thus, when the aortic valve is seen in the short axis, the pulmonic valve is seen in the long axis. In adults, evaluation of the leaflets of the pulmonic valve is limited; usually only one or two leaflets are seen well, and a short-axis view often is not obtainable. The close relationship between the aortic valve and other intracardiac structures is apparent in this short-axis view ([Fig.](#page--1-56) [2.11\)](#page--1-56). The pulmonic valve and RV outflow tract are seen anterolaterally, adjacent to the left coronary cusp, and portions of the septal and anterior tricuspid valve leaflets are seen anteriorly and slightly medially, adjacent to the right coronary cusp. Posteriorly, the RA, interatrial septum, and LA lie in proximity to the noncoronary cusp of the aortic valve. The LA appendage can be better imaged from this view by a slight lateral angulation and a superior rotation of

![](_page_10_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 2.11 Anatomic valve relationships.** An anatomic view of the cardiac base looking toward the apex in a surgeon's view demonstrates the close relationships among the four cardiac valves. The aortic and pulmonic valve planes are perpendicular to each other. *L,* Left; *LAD,* left anterior descending coronary artery; *R,* right. *(From Otto CM: Echocardiographic evaluation of valvular heart disease. In Otto CM, Bonow R, editors:* Valvular Heart Disease: A Companion to Braunwald's Heart Disease, *ed 3, Philadelphia, 2009, Saunders.)*

the transducer. The central location of the aortic valve illustrates how disease processes can extend from the aortic valve or root into the RV outflow tract, RA, or LA. Extension of disease processes into the ventricular septum or anterior mitral leaflet also is possible, as evident in the long-axis view.

At the *mitral valve* short-axis level [\(Fig. 2.12](#page--1-59)), the thin anterior and posterior mitral leaflets are seen as they open nearly to the full cross-sectional area of the LV in diastole and close in systole. The posterior leaflet consists of three major scallops—lateral, central, and medial (also called P1, P2, and P3)—although considerable individual variability exists. The two mitral commissures (the points on the annulus where the anterior and posterior leaflets meet) are located medially and laterally. Note that this parallels the arrangement of the papillary muscles so that chordae from the medial aspects of both anterior and posterior leaflets attach to the medial (or posteromedial) papillary muscle, and chordae from the lateral aspects of both leaflets attach to the lateral (or anterolateral) papillary muscle. Chordae branch at three levels (primary, secondary, and tertiary) between the papillary muscle tip and mitral leaflet with a progressive decrease in chordal diameter and increase in the number of chordae from approximately 12 at the papillary muscle to 120 at the mitral leaflet. Most chordae attach at the free edge of the leaflets (called *marginal chordae*), but some (called *basal or strut chordae*) attach to the LV surface of the leaflet. Occasionally, aberrant chordae to the ventricular septum or other structures are seen in an otherwise normal individual.

At the mid-ventricular (or *papillary muscle*) level [\(Fig.](#page--1-60) [2.13](#page--1-60)), the normal LV is circular in the short-axis view. An elliptical appearance of the chamber usually is due to a nonperpendicular orientation relative to the long axis of the LV. Moving the transducer superiorly with apical angulation resolves this problem. In some normal individuals, the LV appears flattened along the diaphragm in diastole, but it has a normal circular appearance in systole. A noncircular appearance in systole is consistent with myocardial disease, such as myocardial infarction or aneurysm formation, or with abnormal septal curvature due to right heart disease. Although 2D linear measurements of LV diameter are made in the long-axis view, rotating the transducer between the long- and short-axis views at this level ensures that this measurement is both centered in the chamber and perpendicular to the long axis. Oblique measurements result in overestimation of wall thickness and ventricular dimensions.

This view also allows assessment of segmental endocardial motion and wall thickening at the midventricular level. The nomenclature of LV myocardial segments is based on coronary anatomy as discussed in Chapter 8. Basically, the ventricle is divided into anterior (septum and free wall), anterolateral, inferolateral (also called posterior), and inferior (free wall and septum) segments for consistent descriptors of the location of abnormalities. The segments are further defined by their location along the length of the ventricle as basal, mid-ventricular, or apical. Ventricular septal motion reflects abnormalities other than

**Fig. 2.12 Short-axis plane at the mitral valve level.** The position of the image plane is shown in the 3D heart, which is opened and rotated to the position corresponding to the echocardiographic image plane. 2D images in diastole and systole in the standard orientation show the LV with the anterior and posterior mitral valve leaflets (*AMVL* and *PMVL*).

coronary disease, including RV volume overload, pressure overload, or both; conduction abnormalities; and the post–cardiac surgery state (see Fig. 6.22).

The medial and lateral papillary muscles are seen in this short-axis plane and serve as landmarks identifying the mid-ventricular level. Rarely, one of the papillary muscles is bifid, resulting in an appearance of three separate papillary muscles. Note that the apical segments of the LV myocardium are not seen in standard parasternal views. However, in some patients, a short-axis view of the LV near the apex can be obtained by moving the transducer laterally and angling medially. Alternatively, 3D volumetric imaging can be used to display multiple simultaneous short-axis views of the LV from base apex (see Chapter 4).

#### Apical Window

The apical window is identified initially by palpation of the LV apex with the patient in a steep left lateral decubitus position. An apical "cutout" in the examination stretcher allows optimal patient positioning and easier positioning of the transducer at the apical impulse. Transducer position then is adjusted as needed to obtain optimal images. The relationship between the three basic apical views and the short-axis plane is shown in [Fig. 2.14](#page--1-61).

#### *Four-Chamber View*

In the apical four-chamber view, the length of the *left ventricle* is seen in a plane perpendicular to both the short-axis and long-axis planes ([Fig. 2.15\)](#page--1-62). The anterolateral wall, apex, and inferior septum lie in this tomographic plane. The LV appears as a truncated ellipse with a longer length than width and a tapered but rounded apex. If the transducer is not positioned at the true apex, the LV will appear foreshortened, with a more spherical shape and little tapering of the apex. Foreshortening of the long-axis plane must be distinguished from disease processes, such as chronic aortic regurgitation, which result in increased sphericity of the ventricle. Although the RV is more trabeculated than the LV, prominent trabeculation also can be seen at the LV

**Fig. 2.13 Short-axis plane at the papillary muscle level.** The position of the image plane is shown in the 3D heart, which is opened and rotated to the position corresponding to the echocardiographic image plane. 2D images in diastole and systole in the standard orientation demonstrate the circular shape of the LV with symmetric wall thickening and inward endocardial motion with contraction.

![](_page_12_Figure_5.jpeg)

**Fig. 2.14 Apical image planes.** The apical image planes are perpendicular to the short-axis plane with the lines on this diagram indicating the locations of the four-chamber, two-chamber, and aortic long-axis image plane, each about 60° apart, along with the LV wall segments intersected by each image plane. *Ant.,* anterior; *Inf.,* inferior; *Lat.,* lateral.

apex and must be distinguished from apical thrombus. An aberrant LV trabecula that traverses the ventricular chamber is an incidental finding, often called an LV "chord."

Medially, the *right ventricle* is triangular with a cavity about half the area of the LV. The RV apex is less round and more basal than the LV apex, and the moderator band traverses the RV chamber near the apex. The RV can be further evaluated by moving the transducer medially over the RV apex. Considerable individual variability in the shape and wall motion of the RV, particularly at the apex, is seen in normal individuals, so caution is needed in diagnosing an abnormal RV from any single tomographic plane.

The four-chamber view also shows the mitral annulus in its major dimension and the anterior (located adjacent to the septum) and posterior (adjacent to the lateral wall) mitral valve leaflets, along with chordal attachments to the lateral papillary muscle. The mitral leaflet tips separate widely in diastole. In systole the closure plane of the leaflets may appear

Fig. 2.15 🔛 Apical four-chamber view. The four-chamber view is obtained with the transducer on the LV apex and shows the relationships of the LV and RV and LA and RA in the intact heart (upper left). The 2D image plane is oriented with the transducer position at the top of the image (upper right). In the LV, the papillary muscle, chordae, and anterior and posterior mitral leaflets are seen. The descending aorta (DA) is seen in partial cross section lateral to the left atrium, and the right superior pulmonary vein (RSPV) drains into the LA adjacent to the interatrial septum. In the RV, the moderator band (MB) and the anterior and septal tricuspid valve leaflets are seen. Note the ventriculoatrial septum (VAS) separating the LV from the RA in association with the normal, slightly more apical position of the tricuspid compared with the mitral valve annulus. 2D echo images in an apical four-chamber view at end-diastole and end-systole are shown (bottom).

"flat" (a 180° closure angle) because of the nonplanar "saddle" shape of the annulus, with the four-chamber view bisecting the annulus at its most apical position compared with the more basal annulus segments seen in a long-axis view.

The tricuspid annulus lies slightly (up to 1.0 cm) closer to the apex than the mitral annulus. The tricuspid leaflets show a wide diastolic opening; thin, uniformly echogenic, leaflets; and normal coaptation in systole. The septal leaflet is imaged adjacent to the septum. The tricuspid leaflet adjacent to the free wall may be either the anterior or posterior leaflet, depending on the exact rotation and angulation of the image plane.

The left and right atria are distal from the apical transducer position. Apical views are useful for measurement of LA volume (Fig. 2.16), but ultrasound resolution at this depth is poor, so detailed evaluation of atrial tumors or exclusion of thrombus typically requires TEE imaging. The interatrial septum lies parallel to the ultrasound beam in this view, so "dropout"—absence of reflected signal—from the region of the fossa ovalis is common and should not be mistaken for an atrial septal defect. The descending thoracic aorta is seen lateral to the LA. The pulmonary veins enter the LA posteriorly but are difficult to image at this depth in adults. If the transducer is angulated posteriorly from the four-chamber view, more posterior portions of the lateral and inferior septal myocardium are seen. In addition, the length of the coronary sinus comes into view in the atrioventricular groove.

![](_page_14_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 2.16 Left atrial volume measurement.** LA area is traced in systole in the apical four-chamber *(A4C)* and apical two-chamber *(A2C)* views for measurement of length, area, and volume. The biplane *(BP)* end-systolic volume *(ESV)* and indexed ESV are calculated from the two atrial tracings.

By angulating the transducer anteriorly, the aortic valve and root are seen in an oblique long view. This view is sometimes referred to as the apical "fivechamber" view. More anterior portions of the septum and lateral wall are seen, especially at the base, as the transducer is angulated anteriorly. This view of the anterior mitral leaflet, LV outflow tract, and aortic valve is at an angle approximately 60° to 90° from the long-axis view. In some adults, further anterior angulation of the transducer allows visualization of the pulmonary artery arising from the RV. A view of the pulmonic valve from the apical window is more easily obtained in young adults and children.

#### *Two-Chamber View*

From the four-chamber view, the transducer is rotated counterclockwise about 60° to obtain the two-chamber view of the LV, mitral valve, and LA ([Fig. 2.17](#page--1-64)). The apical two-chamber view is used for evaluation of the anterior LV wall (seen to the right of the screen) and the inferolateral (posterior) wall (seen on the left). Fine adjustments in transducer position may be needed to visualize the anterior wall endocardium because of interference from adjacent lung tissue. To ensure that the proper rotation has been made for a twochamber view, the transducer is angled posteriorly to intersect both papillary muscles symmetrically. Then the transducer is angled slightly anteriorly so that neither papillary muscle is seen in its long axis in this view. The anterior mitral leaflet is seen en face, so the apparent closure plane of the leaflet relative to the annulus can be misleading. The LA appendage may be visualized adjacent to the anterior wall. A long-axis view of the descending thoracic aorta can be obtained by angulating posteriorly and rotating counterclockwise from the two-chamber view.

## *Long-Axis View*

Rotating the transducer another 60° from the twochamber view (120° from the four-chamber view) yields a long-axis view similar to the parasternal long-axis view [\(Fig. 2.18](#page--1-65)). The aortic valve, LV outflow tract, and mitral valve are seen in long axis. The LV walls visualized in this view are the anterior septum (on the right side of the screen) and posterior or inferolateral wall (on the left). Compared with the parasternal long-axis view, the LV apex now is seen, but the aortic and mitral valves are at a greater image depth (with consequent poorer image resolution).

## *Other Apical Views*

Nonstandard short-axis views of the LV apex that use a higher-frequency transducer (5 or 7.5 MHz) are helpful if an LV apical thrombus is suspected. One useful view is obtained by sliding the transducer laterally from the LV apex and then angulating medially.

# Subcostal Window

With the patient supine and the legs bent at the knees (if necessary) to relax the abdominal wall

![](_page_15_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 2.17 Apical two-chamber view.** The position of the image plane is shown in the 3D heart, which is opened and rotated to the position corresponding to the echocardiographic image plane. 2D images in diastole and systole in the standard orientation show the cross section of the LA and ventricle with the LA appendage *(LAA),* coronary sinus in the atrioventricular groove, and mitral valve. In the two-chamber view, small portions of the posterior mitral leaflet are seen laterally and medially with the anterior leaflet filling most of the annulus area. Part of a papillary muscle has been shown for orientation, but the papillary muscles are seen located symmetrically posterior to the image plane. In this view, the inferior and anterior LV walls are seen. Corresponding 2D images in diastole and systole are shown.

musculature, subcostal images of the cardiac structures are obtained. A view of all four chambers shows the RV free wall, the mid-section of the interventricular septum, and the anterolateral LV wall ([Fig. 2.19\)](#page--1-66). In this view, the interatrial septum is perpendicular to the direction of the ultrasound beam, thereby allowing evaluation of atrial septal defects.

A subcostal short-axis view of the LV allows measurements of LV wall thickness and dimensions that are comparable with dimensions obtained from a parasternal short-axis view, albeit at a greater depth and through different myocardial segments. The subcostal window provides a useful alternative for qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the LV when the parasternal window is inadequate.

Rotating the transducer inferiorly from the subcostal four-chamber view, a long-axis view of the inferior vena cava is obtained as it enters the RA (see Fig. 6.26). The size of the inferior vena cava (1–2 cm from the RA junction) at rest and changes in size with respiration are used to estimate RA pressure (see Table 6.9). The hepatic veins (particularly the central hepatic vein, which courses parallel to the ultrasound beam in this view) are helpful in assessing RA pressure and for recording RA Doppler filling patterns. The proximal abdominal aorta is imaged in the long axis medial to the inferior vena cava.

#### Suprasternal Notch Window

With the patient supine and the neck extended, the transducer is positioned in the suprasternal notch or right supraclavicular position to obtain a view of the aortic arch in long- and short-axis views. The long-axis view (with respect to the aortic arch) shows the

![](_page_16_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 2.18 Apical long-axis view.** The position of the image plane is shown in the 3D heart, which is opened and rotated to the position corresponding to the echocardiographic image plane. In this view, the anterior septal and posterior (inferolateral) LV walls are seen. *Ao,* Aorta; *RVOT,* RV outflow tract.

ascending aorta, arch, proximal descending thoracic aorta, and the origins of the right brachiocephalic and left common carotid and subclavian arteries [\(Fig.](#page--1-67) [2.20\)](#page--1-67). The corresponding veins lie superior to the aortic arch, with the superior vena cava lying adjacent to the ascending aorta. The right pulmonary artery is seen "under" the curve of the aortic arch and can be followed to its branch point by rotating the transducer medially.

The short-axis view shows the aortic arch in cross section. The left pulmonary artery can be imaged by rotating slightly laterally. The LA lies inferior to the pulmonary arteries in both long- and short-axis views, so it is occasionally possible to evaluate atrial pathology or flow disturbances from this window.

### Other Acoustic Windows

In specific cases, other acoustic windows are needed. For example, a dextropositioned heart would necessitate mirror-image acoustic windows. When a large pleural effusion is present, good-quality images may be obtained in some cases by imaging from the posterior chest wall through the effusion with the patient in a sitting position.

## M-MODE RECORDINGS

Although M-mode recordings have largely been replaced by 2D or 3D imaging, M-mode recordings

![](_page_17_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 2.19 Subcostal four-chamber view.** The position of the image plane is shown in the 3D heart, which is opened and rotated to the position corresponding to the echocardiographic image plane. The interatrial septum is perpendicular to the ultrasound beam from this window, thus allowing evaluation for atrial septal defects.

still have an important role in evaluation of rapid motion of cardiac structures because the sampling rate is 1800 frames per second rather than the 30 to 60 frames per second used for 2D or 3D imaging. The rapid sampling rate also makes identification of thin moving structures, such as the LV endocardium, more accurate and reproducible by showing motion as well as depth of the structure of interest. The potential disadvantage of M-mode data, a nonperpendicular orientation to the structure of interest, can be avoided by using the 2D image in two orthogonal planes to position the M-mode sampling line.

Use of the M-mode feature is most helpful when guided by the 2D image and used for:

- Timing of rapid cardiac motions
- Precise measurements of cardiac dimensions
- Further evaluation of structures seen on 2D imaging (e.g., suspected vegetations) to aid in their identification

### Aortic Valve and Left Atrium

**Fig. 2.20 Suprasternal notch view.** The position of the image plane is shown in the 3D heart, which is opened and rotated to the position corresponding to the echocardiographic image plane. 2D and color Doppler views show the ascending aorta *(Ao),* arch, and proximal descending aorta with the origins of the left carotid and subclavian arteries. The right pulmonary artery *(RPA)* lies immediately inferior to the arch, with the LA and aortic valve sometimes seen from this window. *LVOT,* LV outflow tract; *SVC,* superior vena cava.

moving anteriorly in systole and posteriorly in diastole ([Fig. 2.21](#page--1-68)). The LA is posterior to the aortic root and shows filling in atrial diastole (ventricular systole) and emptying in atrial systole (ventricular diastole). LA filling is largely responsible for the anterior displacement of the aortic root, so aortic root "motion" on an M-mode recording reflects variations in LA size. Increased aortic root motion is seen with increased LA filling and emptying (e.g., with mitral regurgitation). Decreased aortic root motion is seen in low cardiac output states, with corresponding low volumes of atrial filling and emptying.

The aortic leaflet coaptation point is seen as a thin line in diastole. In systole, the leaflets separate rapidly and completely, forming a boxlike appearance on the M-mode recording. Fine systolic fluttering of the aortic valve leaflets is seen in normal individuals.

# Mitral Valve

An M-mode recording at the mitral valve level intercepts the anterior RV wall and chamber, the interventricular septum, the anterior and posterior mitral leaflets, the posterior LV wall, and the pericardium [\(Fig. 2.22\)](#page--1-69). The coaptation point of the mitral leaflets in systole is seen as a thin line that moves slightly anteriorly during systole and parallels the motion of the posterior wall. In early diastole, the leaflets separate widely, with the maximum earlydiastolic motion of the anterior leaflet termed the *E-point.* Normally, only a small distance is present between the E-point and the maximal posterior motion of the ventricular septum—E-point septal separation (EPSS). In the absence of mitral stenosis, an increased EPSS indicates LV dilation, systolic dysfunction, or aortic regurgitation.

The leaflets move toward each other in mid-diastole (diastasis) and then separate again with atrial systole, thus resulting in the late-diastolic peak, the *A point.* The slope of anterior mitral leaflet closure from *A* to the closure point *(C)* is linear unless LV end-diastolic pressure is elevated, when a "*B* bump" or "*A-C* shoulder" may be seen on the M-mode recording of mitral valve motion. Fine fluttering of the anterior mitral leaflet is not seen in normal individuals and usually indicates aortic regurgitation.

### Left Ventricle

A 2D-guided M-mode recording perpendicular to the long axis of and through the center of the LV at the papillary muscle level provides standard measurements of systolic and diastolic wall thickness and chamber dimensions ([Fig. 2.23\)](#page--1-70). These measurements are limited in that they represent only a single line through the LV and thus do not accurately describe the LV when the disease process is asymmetric, such as with prior myocardial infarction. However, many disease processes do result in symmetric changes in the LV (volume overload, hypertrophy), and the accuracy and reproducibility of these measurements make them useful in clinical trials and in patient management. Examples of their utility include sequential evaluations of LV end-systolic dimension in patients with chronic valve regurgitation and assessment of LV hypertrophy in hypertensive patients.

The posterior wall endocardium is identified as the continuous line with the steepest upslope in early systole, but care must be taken to distinguish the

endocardium from reflections caused by overlying mitral chordal structures. Similarly, the endocardium of the septum is identified as a continuous line with systolic inward motion. Measurements are made from the leading edge of the septal endocardial echo to the leading edge of the posterior wall endocardium.

An M-mode recording at this level also is helpful in timing the motion of the RV free wall when cardiac tamponade is suspected or for detection of a small posterior pericardial effusion.

#### Other M-Mode Recordings

An M-mode recording through the pulmonic valve is similar to an aortic valve M-mode recording, except

that usually only one leaflet can be recorded in adults. The slight displacement of the leaflet in diastole (after atrial contraction), called the A-wave, is increased (>7 mm) when pulmonic stenosis is present and is decreased (<2 mm) when pulmonary hypertension is present. Transient mid-systolic closure (or "notching") of the pulmonic valve on M-mode is seen when pulmonary hypertension is present (Fig. 2.24). Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) measured on an apical M-mode recording is useful for evaluation of RV systolic function (see Chapter 6).

#### NORMAL INTRACARDIAC FLOW **PATTERNS**

#### **Basic Principles**

#### Laminar Versus Disturbed Flow

Normal intracardiac flow patterns are characterized by laminar flow. Laminar flow is defined as movement of fluid

![](_page_20_Figure_3.jpeg)

along well-defined parallel stream lines with uniform flow velocities (Fig. 2.25). In three dimensions, laminar flow consists of concentric layers (or lamina) of flow, each with a predictable and uniform direction and velocity.

Steady laminar flow becomes disturbed when the dimensionless Reynolds number exceeds 2000 to 2500. The Reynolds number (R<sub>e</sub>) is directly related to blood flow velocity V, lumen diameter d, and blood density  $\rho$  and inversely related to viscosity  $\gamma$ :

$$\mathrm{Re} = (\mathrm{Vd}\rho)/\gamma$$
 (Eq. 2.1)

When blood flow patterns are disturbed, blood cells move in multiple directions at multiple velocities, rather than along uniform, parallel stream lines. Turbulence, in fluid dynamic terms, refers to the specific situation in which the flow pattern of a particular fluid element is no longer predictable. Although intracardiac flow disturbances rarely exhibit true turbulence, this term is used clinically to denote nonlaminar flow.

#### Flow-Velocity Profiles

The spatial distribution of velocities in cross section at a specific intracardiac location and at a specific

![](_page_20_Figure_11.jpeg)

time point in the cardiac cycle is known as the flow-velocity profile (Fig. 2.26). If all the parallel stream lines in a laminar flow pattern have the same velocity, then the flow-velocity profile is "flat." If velocity is higher in the center of the vessel and lower at the walls of the vessel, the flow profile is "curved" (usually parabolic). Although normal flow in peripheral vessels has a curved flow-velocity profile, many intracardiac flows have a relatively flat flow-velocity profile. Factors that tend to equalize the velocity distribution across the cross-sectional area of flow include anatomic tapering of the flow area, acceleration of flow, and inlet-type geometry (e.g., an abrupt transition from a large chamber to a smaller orifice). Thus, the proximal aorta and pulmonary artery and the mitral and tricuspid annuli have reasonably flat flow-velocity profiles at their inlets. Downstream, the spatial distribution changes; for example, in the ascending aorta, the flow profile is asymmetric, with higher flow velocities along the inside curve of the aortic arch and lower velocities along the outer curve. Many Doppler quantitative methods make assumptions about

![](_page_21_Picture_2.jpeg)

Fig. 2.25 Intracardiac blood flow patterns. Laminar flow is characterized by parallel stream lines at uniform velocities with concentric layers of flow, each with a predictable and uniform direction and velocity (top). Disturbed flow occurs downstream from areas of narrowing (stenotic orifice, regurgitant orifice, or intracardiac shunt) with blood flow in multiple directions and velocities (bottom). In the orifice itself, a laminar high-velocity iet occurs.

the spatial flow profile at a particular intracardiac site. In some cases, these assumptions can be verified by careful pulsed or color Doppler evaluation.

### Clinical Quantitative Doppler Methods

Three basic principles are common to the clinical use of Doppler ultrasound in evaluation of cardiac disease. These are presented briefly here and in more detail, including technical aspects and potential pitfalls, in subsequent chapters, as follows:

- Measurement of volume flow in Chapter 6
- The relationship between velocity and pressure gradients in Chapter 11
- The spatial flow pattern through a small orifice (e.g., regurgitant valve) in Chapter 12

#### Measurement of Volume Flow

Doppler echocardiography allows accurate measurement of the volume of blood ejected by the heart on each beat or of the amount of blood passing across each cardiac valve. This method is used clinically to measure stroke volume and cardiac output at rest or after physiologic or pharmacologic interventions, to evaluate the severity of valvular regurgitation, as a component in the equation for valve area calculations, and to quantitate the ratio of pulmonary to systemic blood flow in patients with intracardiac shunts.

#### **ECHO MATH:** Measurement of Volume Flow

When blood flow is laminar with a flat flow-velocity profile, it is intuitive that the instantaneous flow rate can be calculated as cross-sectional area, or CSA (in cm<sup>2</sup>), times flow velocity (in cm/s). Thus, by integrating flow velocity over the duration of flow, stroke volume, or SV (in cm<sup>3</sup>), can be calculated as:

$$SV \text{ (cm}^3\text{)} = CSA \text{ (cm}^2\text{)} \times VTI \text{ (cm)}$$
 (Eq. 2.2)

where VTI is the velocity-time integral (cm) of the Doppler velocity curve.

For example, if the LV outflow tract diameter is 2.4 cm and we assume a circular CSA  $(\pi r^2)$  and the VTI of flow at that site is 18 cm, then volume flow rate is calculated as:

$$SV = 3.14 (1.2 \text{ cm})^2 \times 18 \text{ cm} = 81 \text{ cm}^3 = 81 \text{ mL}$$

If heart rate (HR) is 80 beats per minute, cardiac output (CO) then is:

$$CO = SV \times HR = 81 \text{ mL} \times 80 = 6480 \text{ mL/min}$$
  
= 6.48 L/min

## Velocity-Pressure Relationships

At any area of significant narrowing in the flowstream—whether a stenotic valve, a ventricular septal defect, or a regurgitant orifice—flow velocity increases in relation to the degree of narrowing; the narrower the opening, the faster is the velocity for a given volume flow rate. This relationship between pressure gradient and velocity is important for quantitation of valve stenosis severity, noninvasive determination of pulmonary artery pressures, and evaluation of other intracardiac hemodynamics using continuous-wave (CW) Doppler ultrasound.

#### **ECHO MATH:** Velocity-Pressure Relationships

In most clinical situations, the velocity in a highvelocity "jet" through a narrowed orifice is related quantitatively to the pressure gradient across the narrowing, as stated in the simplified Bernoulli equation:

$$\Delta \mathbf{P} = 4\mathbf{v}^2 \tag{Eq. 2.3}$$

where Δ*P* is the instantaneous pressure gradient (mmHg) and *v* is the instantaneous velocity (m/s) and the number 4 converts from units of velocity (m/s) to pressure (mmHg).

For example, if the velocity across a narrowed aortic valve is 5 m/s, then the maximum pressure gradient is:

$$\Delta P = 4 (5)^2 = 100 \text{ mmHg}$$

## *Spatial Pattern of Flow*

Flow through a small orifice is characterized by a:

- Proximal flow convergence region
- Narrow flowstream through the orifice, called the vena contracta
- Downstream flow disturbance

Each of these components of the spatial flow pattern can be evaluated with color flow imaging, which allows real-time demonstrations of flow patterns in each tomographic plane (e.g., with valve regurgitation). The proximal flow convergence region allows calculation of volume flow rates. The vena contracta provides a simple measure of regurgitant severity. The downstream flow disturbance allows detection of valvular regurgitation and intracardiac shunts and determination of the anatomic level of RV or LV outflow obstruction. In addition, the 3D shape of the flow disturbance provides clues to the cause of regurgitation.

# Normal Antegrade Intracardiac Flows

Normal antegrade intracardiac flows can be evaluated with either pulsed or CW Doppler ultrasound [\(Table](#page--1-51) [2.4\)](#page--1-51). Accurate measurement of antegrade flow velocities is dependent on several technical factors. Most important is a parallel alignment between the ultrasound beam and the direction of blood flow. The ultrasound instrument measures Doppler frequency shifts. The displayed velocities are *calculated* with the Doppler equation based on transducer frequency, the speed of sound in blood, and the angle between the Doppler beam and flow of interest. For intracardiac flows, the 3D direction of flow is difficult to determine, particularly when flow is abnormal, and attempts to

"correct" for the presumed intercept angle are likely to increase, rather than decrease, measurement error. Instead, the examiner positions the ultrasound beam as parallel as possible to the flow of interest based on obtaining the highest calculated velocity with careful transducer positioning and angulation. In the Doppler equation, cos θ = 1 (and therefore can be ignored) when flow is oriented directly away (intercept angle = 0°) or straight toward (intercept angle = 180°) the ultrasound transducer. Small deviations from a parallel intercept angle (up to 20°) result in only a small error (6%) in velocity calculations (see Fig. 1.25). Although this approach generally results in accurate velocity data, the possibility of underestimation of intracardiac velocities resulting from a nonparallel intercept angle always must be considered in all echocardiographic examinations. This potential limitation becomes significant when recording high-velocity flows in valvular stenosis, regurgitation, or intracardiac shunts.

Other technical factors pertinent to recording antegrade flow velocities include the use of an appropriate velocity scale, wall filters, and gain settings. The standard velocity format is to display flows toward the transducer above and flows away from the transducer below the zero baseline. The baseline is shifted to maximize the flow of interest and the velocity scale adjusted so that the velocity curve uses the entire displayed range. Wall filters are set as low as possible, without resulting in excessive noise, to allow accurate measurement of time intervals. Gain settings are adjusted to show the peak velocity and velocity curve clearly without excessive background noise. A sample volume length of 2 to 4 mm typically is used to record antegrade flow velocities because this length provides reasonable intracardiac localization with adequate signal strength.

Signal aliasing (as discussed in Chapter 1) occurs even with normal intracardiac flow velocities. Use of the baseline shift can resolve this problem in most cases. If aliasing persists, use of high–pulse repetition frequency or CW Doppler is needed for unambiguous display of the maximum velocity.

With appropriate instrument settings and attention to technical details, antegrade velocities with pulsed Doppler ultrasound appear as smooth envelopes with a well-defined onset and end of flow, a well-defined maximum velocity, and a thin band of velocities at each time point. The area under the velocity curve is "clear" because the flow velocities at a specific intracardiac site are relatively uniform. CW Doppler recordings differ in that the curve is "filled in" because of inclusion of lower velocities along the entire length of the ultrasound beam.

#### *Left Ventricular Outflow*

An apical or suprasternal notch window is used to obtain a parallel intercept angle between the ultrasound beam and the direction of blood flow in the LV outflow tract and ascending aorta. In general, LV outflow velocities are most accurately recorded from a transthoracic approach because it is more difficult to obtain a parallel intercept angle from the TEE approach. In some cases, a TEE transgastric "apical" approach may be useful, but potential underestimation of velocity resulting from a nonparallel intercept angle always should be considered.

With a pulsed Doppler sample volume positioned on the LV side of the aortic valve, an ejection velocity curve is recorded with a steep acceleration slope, a sharply peaked early systolic maximum velocity, and a less steep deceleration slope ([Fig.](#page--1-74) [2.27\)](#page--1-74). A normal LV outflow tract velocity is about 0.7 to 1.1 m/s. Note the narrow band of velocities at any instant in time during acceleration that reflects the uniformity of blood flow velocity in the outflow tract during acceleration. During deceleration, the range of flow velocities at any instant is slightly wider (spectral broadening) because instability in the flow pattern during deceleration results in slight variation in flow velocities. The aortic valve closing click is seen immediately following end-ejection. Flow recordings with pulsed Doppler on the aortic side of the valve appear similar, except that the aortic valve opening click, rather than the closing click, is seen, and the maximum velocity is slightly higher than the outflow tract velocity because of a slight narrowing of the cross-sectional area of flow at the aortic leaflet tips.

With CW Doppler interrogation of the aortic valve, both opening and closing clicks are recorded. The area under the velocity curve is filled in with lowervelocity signals because lower-velocity blood flow signals that originate in the LV along the length of the ultrasound beam are displayed as well. With a normal aortic valve, the area under the velocity curve (the velocity-time integral) reflects stroke volume, which can be calculated by multiplying by cross-sectional area. The normal antegrade maximum velocity across the valve is between 1.0 and 1.7 m/s and is the same whether measured by pulsed or CW Doppler methods.

The relationship between velocity and pressure gradients across *nonstenotic* valves is somewhat complex and is not fully described by the Bernoulli equation (which applies to areas of narrowing). The period of acceleration corresponds to a slight pressure gradient from the LV to the aorta, with the maximum pressure gradient corresponding to maximum acceleration. LV pressure falls below aortic pressure in mid-systole, and at this point, deceleration of flow occurs. Thus, for the normal valve, maximum velocity occurs at the pressure crossover point (see Fig. 6.1). During deceleration, aortic pressure remains slightly higher than LV pressure until flow decelerates to zero and the valve closes. At this point, LV pressure continues to decline rapidly.

#### *Right Ventricular Outflow*

The RV outflow tract and pulmonary artery velocities are recorded from a parasternal short-axis or an RV outflow view [\(Fig. 2.28](#page--1-75)). In a normal individual, the RV ejection curve is similar to the LV ejection curve, except that peak velocity is slightly lower (0.5 to 1.3 m/s), the ejection period is longer, and the velocity curve is more rounded, with the maximum velocity occurring in mid-systole. The shapes of the RV and LV ejection curves appear to relate to the downstream vascular resistance. The low-resistance pulmonary vasculature results in a slower rate of acceleration of blood flow, with the maximum velocity (and pressure crossover) occurring later in the ejection cycle. When pulmonary vascular resistance is increased, the RV ejection curve resembles LV ejection more closely with a sharper velocity curve and earlier peak velocity.

#### *Left Ventricular Inflow*

Diastolic flow across the mitral valve shows two peaks: an early-diastolic peak velocity (*E*-wave) reflecting passive early-diastolic filling and a late diastolic peak velocity as a result of atrial contraction (*A*-wave) ([Fig.](#page--1-48) [2.29\)](#page--1-48). The normal *E* velocity in healthy, young individuals is about 1 m/s, with an *A* velocity of 0.2 to 0.4 m/s, reflecting the normal small contribution

**Fig. 2.27 LV outflow velocity.** (A) LV outflow tract *(LVOT)* velocity is recorded with pulsed Doppler from an anteriorly angulated apical four-chamber view(as shown here) or an apical long-axis view. (B) The correct position for recording LVOT velocity is with the sample volume positioned just proximal to the aortic valve closure plane. The pulsed Doppler signal shows a smooth velocity curve with a well-defined peak between 0.8 and 1.2 m/s with a linear bright aortic valve closing click *(arrow)*. Flow velocities are uniform during acceleration but vary during deceleration, thus resulting in slight spectral broadening in the second half of systole. (C) The sample volume depth is increased to just beyond the tips of the open valve leaflets in systole for recording the higher aortic *(Ao)* flow laminar velocity curve with no visible closing click. (D) CW Doppler recording of aortic flow shows a higher velocity as blood flow crosses with valve plane, with both an opening and closing click and filling in of the velocity curve due to recording velocity along the entire length of the ultrasound beam.

of atrial contraction to LV diastolic filling. If diastole is long enough, a period of no flow, or diastasis, between the two flow curves is seen. The pattern of LV diastolic filling varies with age, loading conditions, heart rate, and pulmonic regurgitation (PR) interval. With age, a gradual reduction in *E* velocity, prolongation in the rate of early-diastolic deceleration, and increase in *A* velocity occur such that the ratio of *E* to *A* velocity changes from >1 in young individuals, to about 1 at 50 to 60 years of age, to <1 in older normal individuals (see Chapter 7).

C

**1.5**

Typically, LV diastolic filling is recorded from an apical window on transthoracic studies. In addition to the physiologic variability discussed earlier, the peak *E* velocity and the ratio of the *E* to *A* peaks differs depending on whether the sample volume is placed at the mitral annulus or at the mitral leaflet tips. Appropriate positioning of the sample volume depends on whether the Doppler curve is used to evaluate diastolic filling of the LV (leaflet tips are probably most useful) or transmitral stroke volume (mitral annular level is most useful). CW Doppler recordings show the highest velocities wherever they occur along the length of the ultrasound beam. LV diastolic filling is discussed in more detail in Chapter 7.

**1.3 m/s**

# *Right Ventricular Inflow*

RV inflow can be recorded from an apical approach or from the parasternal RV inflow view. The pattern of RV diastolic filling is similar to LV filling, although

**Fig. 2.28 Normal pulmonary artery velocity curve.** The pulsed Doppler sample volume is positioned in the mid-pulmonary artery from a parasternal short-axis view. The velocity curve is rounded with a peak in mid-systole and a maximum velocity of about 0.8 m/s. Compare the shape of this velocity curve with the LV outflow curve seen in [Fig. 2.27](#page--1-74). *PV AT,* Pulmonic valve acceleration time.

peak flow velocities are slightly lower with a normal RV inflow *E* velocity of 0.3 to 0.7 m/s.

#### *Left Atrial Filling*

It is technically challenging to record LA filling from a transthoracic approach because of suboptimal signal strength at the depth of the pulmonary veins in many adults. However, with careful attention to technical details, this flow curve is obtainable in the right superior pulmonary vein in an apical four-chamber view in about 90% of patients. From a TEE approach, flow in both right and left pulmonary veins can be recorded, with the most laminar flow signals obtained from the left superior pulmonary vein (see [Fig. 2.29\)](#page--1-48). The venous flow signals in the pulmonary veins are low velocity, about 0.5 m/s in both systole and diastole.

Atrial contraction results in brief low-velocity (about 0.3 m/s) backflow in the pulmonary veins (*a*-wave), followed by a biphasic filling pattern with prominent filling of the atrium (*x*-descent) during ventricular systole, a second brief reversal of flow (*v*-wave) following ventricular contraction, and a second atrial filling curve (*y*-descent) during ventricular diastole (see Chapter 7). Abnormalities of LA filling can be seen in patients with mitral regurgitation (see Chapter 12), constrictive pericarditis (see Chapter 10) and restrictive cardiomyopathy (see Chapter 9).

![](_page_25_Figure_11.jpeg)

**Fig. 2.29 Normal LV inflow and pulmonary vein velocity signals.** *(Left)* LV inflow is recorded from the apical view, usually in a four-chamber plane, with the sample volume positioned at the mitral leaflet tips in diastole. *(Right, top)* Pulsed Doppler transmitral LV inflow shows rapid early-diastolic filling *(E)* and the small atrial *(A)* contribution to late diastolic filling in this normal young individual. *(Right, bottom)* Pulmonary vein flow is recorded in the right superior pulmonary vein *(RSPV)* in the four-chamber view with the sample volume positioned about 1 cm into the pulmonary vein*.* The pulsed Doppler LA filling curve shows systolic *(S)* and diastolic *(D)* filling with a small atrial *(a)* reversal of flow.

## *Right Atrial Filling*

RA filling can be assessed from Doppler recordings of superior vena caval flow (from a suprasternal notch approach) or central hepatic vein flow (which lies parallel to the ultrasound beam from a subcostal window). The pattern of flow again is analogous to the pulsation pattern of the neck veins seen on clinical examination, with an *a*-wave, an *x*-descent reflecting systolic filling, a *v*-wave, and a *y*-descent reflecting diastolic filling of the RA (see Fig. 7.5).

## *Descending Aorta*

Flow patterns in the descending aorta are important in the evaluation of cardiac disorders because the downstream flow pattern depends on the presence and severity of specific cardiac lesions. Examples include aortic regurgitation, patent ductus arteriosus, and aortic coarctation. Descending thoracic aorta flow can be recorded from a suprasternal notch approach and shows antegrade flow with a systolic velocity curve, a peak velocity of about 1 m/s, and brief early-diastolic flow reversal (see Fig. 16.9). The proximal abdominal aorta recorded from a subcostal approach shows a similar flow pattern (see Fig. 16.10).

# Normal Color Doppler Flow Patterns *Impact of Color Doppler Physics*

Although spectral Doppler (pulsed or continuous) is preferable for accurate measurement of specific intracardiac blood flow velocities, the overall pattern of intracardiac flow is better demonstrated with color flow imaging. Of course, as with any Doppler modality, color Doppler flow images are *angle dependent*. For example, flow in the LV outflow tract is a uniform red color from a parasternal long-axis view because the direction of flow is toward the transducer. The same flow is a uniform *blue* color from an apical approach because now it is directed away from the transducer [\(Fig. 2.30\)](#page--1-76).

Angle dependence of flow patterns also can be seen in a single image plane. For example, antegrade flow in the aortic arch from a suprasternal notch view appears red (toward the transducer) in the more proximal segment and blue (away from the transducer) more distally, with a small black area in the center of the image where the ultrasound beam is perpendicular to flow. Similarly, in the abdominal aorta from a subcostal approach, antegrade flow appears alternatively red and then blue as it traverses the image plane (see Fig. 1.31). In these examples, the change in color is due to a change in intercept angle between the ultrasound beam and blood flow at the left versus right edge of the sector, rather than a change in the direction or velocity of blood flow.

Less dramatic changes in intercept angle across the 2D image also result in a complex color flow pattern for laminar normal flow. For example, evaluation of the LV outflow tract in an apical long-axis view may show an apparent higher systolic velocity along the ventricular septum than along the anterior mitral leaflet ([Fig. 2.31](#page--1-77)). This appearance results from a more parallel intercept angle between the Doppler beam and blood flow along the septum than adjacent to the mitral valve. The same actual velocities across

![](_page_26_Figure_12.jpeg)

**Fig. 2.30 Doppler color LV outflow patterns.** Antegrade flow from the LV into the aorta *(Ao)* in systole recorded from a parasternal approach *(left)* is *red* (toward the transducer), whereas the same flow from an apical position *(right)* is *blue* (away from the transducer).

![](_page_27_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 2.31 Color Doppler signal aliasing.** Color Doppler imaging of LV outflow from an apical long-axis view shows aliasing proximal to the aortic valve because the flow velocity (about 1 m/s) exceeds the Nyquist limit (0.67 m/s) at this depth. The color change pattern across the outflow tract is the result of a more parallel intercept angle between the ultrasound beam and flow along the septum compared with near the mitral valve. *Ao,* Aorta.

the outflow tract result in differing Doppler frequency shifts depending on this intercept angle. Because the instrument assumes that cos θ = 1 for each signal, a falsely low velocity is calculated for nonparallel intercept angles, with the resulting image showing an apparent increase in velocity across the image plane as a result of differing intercept angles.

In addition to intercept angle, color flow images also are affected by the phenomenon of *signal aliasing*. The Nyquist limit, as displayed at the top and bottom of the color scale, typically is 60 to 80 cm/s with a 2- or 3-MHz transducer at depths used for transthoracic cardiac imaging. Because normal intracardiac flow velocities often exceed this limit, signal aliasing occurs. Flow toward the transducer is displayed in red at velocities less than the Nyquist limit, but once aliasing occurs, this same flow signal is displayed in blue. Thus, flow toward the transducer is red aliasing to blue, whereas flow away from the transducer is blue aliasing to red. In fact, multiple aliases can occur with high-velocity flows displayed sequentially as going from red to blue to red and so on. An example of normal aliasing is seen in the LV inflow pattern on the apical four-chamber view,

where the red flow toward the apex turns blue as it exceeds the Nyquist limit (see Fig. 1.32). Although confusing at first, patterns of signal aliasing can be advantageous in the quantitation of intracardiac flows using the proximal isovelocity surface area approach discussed in Chapter 12.

Another color image pattern seen even with normal intracardiac flows is *variance,* which often is encoded as green on the color display. Although the concept of variance is that a single intracardiac site exhibits multiple flow velocities and directions (e.g., in a regurgitant jet), from the foregoing discussions of intercept angle and aliasing, it is apparent that a normal flow pattern might meet variance criteria. For example, in a region at the aliasing limit, the instrument sequentially measures flow toward and then away from the transducer due to aliasing and then assigns variance to that color pixel. Awareness that a color variance pattern can occur with normal intracardiac flows avoids erroneous interpretations.

## *Normal Ventricular Outflow Patterns*

Color flow imaging of LV outflow can be recorded from an apical approach in either an anteriorly angulated four-chamber view or a long-axis view. Flow is laminar, but aliasing typically occurs at this depth, resulting in a complex color pattern. Although measurement of stroke volume proximal to the aortic valve, which assumes a flat flow-velocity profile, has been validated, it remains controversial whether the appearance of aliasing along the ventricular septum in systole is due to a skewed flow profile or to variations in intercept angle across the color sector.

RV outflow can be visualized from a parasternal short-axis view, from the RV outflow view, or from a subcostal short-axis view. Because velocities are slightly lower and the depth of interrogation is less than for LV outflow, the flow pattern away from the transducer typically shows a uniform blue color.

## *Normal Ventricular Inflow Patterns*

In the apical four-chamber view, LV inflow appears as a broad flowstream extending laterally across the mitral annulus and lengthwise to the LV apex. If the Nyquist limit is exceeded, signal aliasing occurs with a color shift at the aliasing velocity. In real time, the separate flows of early and late diastolic filling may be seen. When ultrasound penetration is optimal, diastolic flow extends from the pulmonary veins to the LV apex. The normal spatial pattern of the LV inflow is directed along the lateral LV wall, in middiastole, with blue flow away from the transducer along the ventricular septum consistent with a "vortex" of flow in the LV in diastole [\(Fig. 2.32](#page--1-78)). This normal counterclockwise vortex often is reversed in patients after mitral valve replacement. RV inflow patterns on color flow imaging are analogous to the patterns seen in the LV.

#### *Normal Atrial Inflow Patterns*

Inflow into the LA occurs via the four pulmonary veins. On transthoracic imaging, the right superior pulmonary vein is the easiest to visualize in the apical four-chamber view. Color flow imaging showing the biphasic red inflow from this vein allows correct placement of a pulsed Doppler sample volume for recording the spectral Doppler data. TEE imaging is needed for reliable identification of all four pulmonary veins, which are rarely visualized on transthoracic imaging in adults.

Inflow into the RA occurs via the superior and inferior venae cavae and the coronary sinus. Evaluation may be complicated by some degree of tricuspid regurgitation (present in 80% to 90% of normal subjects and a higher percentage of patients), which typically is directed along the interatrial septum. Flow from the inferior vena cava and coronary sinus is seen in the RV inflow view, as well as in the short-axis view at the aortic valve level and in the apical fourchamber view. Superior vena caval flow is seen from the suprasternal notch approach. In the RA, recognition of the several normal inflow patterns is important when an atrial septal defect is suspected. About 20% to 30% of normal subjects have a patent foramen ovale (demonstrable by intravenous echo contrast during a Valsalva maneuver), but color flow evidence for a patent foramen ovale is seen on transthoracic imaging in only about 5% of normal individuals.

## *Physiologic Valvular Regurgitation*

With careful examination techniques, a small amount of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation is detectable in 50% to 80% of normal people. In addition, mild pulmonic regurgitation, appearing as a narrow red "flame" in diastole, is an incidental finding (present in 70% to 80% of normal individuals). These physiologic degrees of regurgitation are characterized by a localized signal that often is seen only briefly during the cardiac cycle. Small amounts of mitral, tricuspid, and pulmonic valvular regurgitation are of no apparent clinical significance. In contrast, color Doppler evidence of aortic regurgitation is seen in only about 5% of otherwise normal adults.

## AGING CHANGES ON ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY

Between young adulthood and age 70 years, typical echocardiographic changes include an increase in LV wall thickness by about 2 mm with little change in chamber size, LV diastolic dysfunction with *E-A* reversal at about age 50 years, and progressive mild LA enlargement. Aortic dimensions also increase slightly, with about a 6% increase between the fourth and eighth decades of life. Calcific cardiac changes also are common, particularly mild aortic valve leaflet thickening without obstruction to outflow (e.g., aortic sclerosis), which is present in about 25% of adults older than 65 years of age, and calcification of the mitral annulus, seen in up to 50% of older adults. Many older adults, particularly those with a history of hypertension, have a more acute angle between the aorta and ventricular septum, resulting in apparent basal septal thickening, or a "septal knuckle." None of these findings is strictly "normal," but they are seen in many older adults and should be interpreted in that context.

### THE DIAGNOSTIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM

## Core Elements

A diagnostic echocardiogram is defined as a clinical study, performed under the supervision of a physician with special expertise in echocardiography, with generation of a formal interpretation and long-term image storage. In contrast, point of care or handheld ultrasound, discussed in Chapter 4, is a focused examination performed by the physician caring for the patient; it is used to guide short-term patient management Although the diagnostic echocardiographic examination should be directed toward the specific clinical question in each individual patient, it is important to use a systematic and consistent format with the supervising physician ensuring that instrumentation and data acquisition are appropriate for the clinical indication. Additional imaging and Doppler elements may be needed to pursue the clinical question or any observed abnormalities fully.

The core diagnostic echocardiographic elements differ from laboratory to laboratory, but the concept of a standardized examination sequence is critical to ensure that abnormalities are not missed. Blood pressure and study indications are reviewed before beginning the examination. An electrocardiographic lead is recorded to assist in evaluating the timing of cardiac motion and Doppler flows. Measurements of the cardiac chambers, great vessels, and Doppler flow appropriate for the clinical indication are made using M-mode, 2D, and 3D imaging ([Table 2.5;](#page--1-50) see Tables A.1 to A.4 in Appendix A).

The Core Elements of the examination allow the physician to evaluate the:

# Left ventricle:

- Chamber size and wall thickness
- Segmental wall motion abnormalities
- Overall systolic function (including ejection fraction)
- Diastolic filling

Aortic valve and aorta:

- Aortic sinus dimensions and shape
- Ascending aortic diameter
- Aortic valve anatomy
- Evidence for regurgitation or stenosis

Mitral valve and left atrium:

- Mitral valve anatomy and motion
- Evidence for stenosis or regurgitation
- LA size

Right side of the heart:

- RV size and systolic function
- RA size
- Valve anatomy and function
- Estimated pulmonary artery pressure

#### Pericardium:

■ Evidence for thickening or effusion

## Additional Components

Additional imaging and Doppler data are recorded as needed based on the clinical indications for the study and any abnormalities seen on the basic examination. The combination of Core Elements and Additional Components then constitutes a complete echocardiographic examination.

An example of findings on the Core Elements leading to additional data recording is when a calcified aortic valve is present. With this finding, attention is focused first on the precise valve anatomy—bicuspid, calcific, rheumatic—and then on the function of the valve. The degree of stenosis is quantitated from the maximum aortic jet velocity and calculation of valve area (see Chapter 11), and the degree of regurgitation is evaluated with color flow and CW Doppler techniques (see Chapter 12). Next, the LV response to the pressure load imposed by the abnormal aortic valve is assessed both for systolic function (see Chapter 6) and diastolic function (see Chapter 7).

Another example is evaluation of a patient after myocardial infarction. In this case, attention is focused on the extent and distribution of LV segmental wall motion abnormalities (see Chapter 8). If apical akinesis or dyskinesis is noted, a diligent search for an apical thrombus is indicated (see Chapter 15). If the patient has a new murmur, careful evaluation is performed to assess the possibility of mitral regurgitation as a result of papillary muscle dysfunction or the possibility of a postinfarction ventricular septal defect. Overall LV systolic function is evaluated, as is RV function.

Even if no obvious abnormalities are noted during the basic examination, the study is focused toward the specific clinical question in that patient. For example, if endocarditis is suspected (see Chapter 14), more attention to valvular anatomy is needed, with careful transducer angulation and nonstandard views to optimize visualization of possible valvular vegetations. Another example of how the clinical indication affects the examination is the patient referred for symptoms of heart failure. Even if the Core Elements are unremarkable, more complete evaluation of diastolic LV function is helpful to evaluate for a cardiac cause of the patient's symptoms.

The need to focus the examination on the specific clinical question and at the same time ensure that significant abnormalities are not missed highlights the necessity for appropriate training of both the physician responsible for the examination and the sonographer performing the study, as well as for close interaction between these two individuals during the performance and interpretation of the study. Furthermore, interaction with the referring physician is recommended either before the examination is performed to clarify the differential diagnosis and clinical questions or after the examination to integrate the pretest likelihood with the echocardiographic findings and estimate the probability of any remaining diagnostic problems.

The Echo Exam should always include additional components to address the clinical indication. For example, if the indication is "heart failure," additional components to evaluate systolic and diastolic function are needed even if the Core Elements do not show obvious abnormalities. If the indication is "cardiac source of embolus," the Additional Components for that diagnosis are needed. *TR,* tricuspid regurgitation
