chocardiographic evaluation of prosthetic valves is similar, in many respects, to the evaluation of native valve disease. However, some important differences exist. First, several types of prosthetic valves are available, with differing fluid dynamics for each basic design and differing flow velocities for each valve size. Second, the mechanisms of valve dysfunction are somewhat different from those for native valve disease. Third, the technical aspects of imaging artificial devices—specifically, the problem of acoustic shadowing—significantly affect the diagnostic approach when prosthetic valve dysfunction is suspected ([Table 13.1\)](#page--1-36). E

Echocardiographers frequently are asked to evaluate prosthetic valve function because of the increasing number of prosthetic valves implanted annually and the greater longevity of patients with prosthetic valves. Both an understanding of the basic approach to echocardiographic evaluation (as outlined in this chapter) and detailed knowledge of the specific flow dynamic for the size and type of prosthesis in an individual patient are needed for appropriate patient management.

The three basic types of prosthetic valves [\(Figs. 13.1](#page--1-37) and [13.2\)](#page--1-38) are:

- Tissue valves, or bioprostheses
- Homograft valves
- Mechanical valves

Bioprosthetic heart valves are implanted either surgically or by a transcatheter approach.

*Tissue valves* are composed of three biologic leaflets with an anatomic structure similar to that of the native aortic valve. With stented prosthetic valves, the leaflets (typically porcine), or pericardium (usually bovine or equine) shaped to mimic normal leaflets, are mounted on a cloth-covered rigid support that functions as the crown-shaped aortic annulus with a raised "stent" at each of the three commissures ([Fig.](#page--1-39) [13.3\)](#page--1-39). Variations in the support structure and leaflet

types abound in commercially available valves; some include anticalcification treatments. "Stentless" tissue valves also have been developed that use a flexible cuff of fabric or tissue, instead of rigid stents, to support the valve leaflets. Stentless valves often are implanted as part of a composite tissue valve and aortic root. In the past, bioprosthetic valves were implanted only surgically using cardiopulmonary bypass to support the circulation while the valve was implanted. Now, specially designed bioprosthetic valves can be implanted by a transcatheter approach with the tissue leaflets mounted on a compressible stent ([Fig. 13.4\)](#page--1-40).

# *Homograft Valves*

Homograft valves are cryopreserved human aortic or pulmonic valves harvested at autopsy. Typically, the valve and great vessel are preserved as a block, to be trimmed appropriately at the time of implantation in the aortic or pulmonic position. Whereas the fluid dynamics of a homograft are similar to those of a native valve, flow velocities are slightly higher and valve areas are slightly smaller than for a normal native valve because of the space occupied by the homograft annulus in the patient's outflow tract. Because of late severe tissue calcification with homograft valves, the approach usually is reserved for adults with complex aortic root abscesses.

Self-expanding transcatheter aortic valves *(bottom)* are implanted slightly lower (3 to 6 mm below annulus), but the prosthetic cusps are in a supra-annular position. Patients in this example have no or trace periprosthetic regurgitation. Knowledge of the appropriate position is essential for diagnosing transcatheter aortic valve migration and malposition.

## *Mechanical Valves*

Various mechanical valves currently are available. In addition, several other types of valves, which were implanted in the past, are still in situ in some patients. The two basic types of currently implanted mechanical valves are:

- A bileaflet valve in which two semicircular disks hinge open to form two large lateral orifices and a smaller central orifice [\(Figs. 13.5](#page--1-41) and [13.6\)](#page--1-42)
- A tilting-disk valve in which a single circular disk opens at an angle to the annulus plane, being constrained in its motion by a smaller "cage," a central strut, or a slanted slot in the valve ring

In the past, ball-cage mechanical valves also were used and are still occasionally encountered. With a ball-cage valve, a spherical occluder is contained by a metal "cage" when the valve is open and fills the orifice in the closed position.

#### *Valved Conduits*

Valved conduits are used in congenital heart surgery and in ascending aortic repairs when both a new passageway for blood flow and a valve are needed. Conduits are constructed from biologic (e.g., a homograft) or artificial (e.g., various types of fabric) material, either with a stented tissue or a mechanical valve. Fluid dynamics similar to those for a valve implanted in the native annulus. A stentless valve in root prosthesis also can be used in this situation.

## Mechanisms of Prosthetic Valve Dysfunction

The types of disease processes that affect prosthetic valves are distinctly different from those seen with native valvular heart disease and can be classified into three groups:

- Structural failure
- Thromboembolic complications
- Endocarditis

#### *Primary Structural Failure*

Failure of a bioprosthetic valve to open or close properly (mechanical failure) usually is the result of slowly progressive tissue degeneration with fibrocalcific changes of the leaflets, a process that results in

**Fig. 13.5 Bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis.** TEE images. (A) The sewing ring and two parallel open leaflets *(arrows*) in diastole. (B) In systole, the two leaflets close with a slightly obtuse closure angle with reverberations from the leaflets and shadowing from the sewing ring *(arrows)* obscuring the LV side of the valve.

(B) In systole*,* two normal jets of regurgitation *(arrows)* are seen.

increased resistance to opening (stenosis) or failure to coapt during valve closure (regurgitation). Typically, failure of tissue valves occurs 10 or more years after valve implantation. Acute bioprosthetic valve stenosis is rare. Acute bioprosthetic regurgitation can occur with a leaflet tear, usually adjacent to a region of calcification.

Failure of a mechanical valve can occur because of faulty design or wear and tear of the prosthetic material resulting in disk escape or incomplete valve closure. However, these complications were seen only with older-generation valves. Current-generation mechanical valves are reliable and very durable. More often, mechanical valve stenosis or regurgitation is due to thrombus formation or pannus ingrowth around the valve, thus impairing disk excursion or closure.

With both bioprosthetic and mechanical valves, paravalvular regurgitation can occur around the sewing ring because of loss of suture material postoperatively; this is most often related to fibrocalcific disease in the valve annulus. The new onset of paravalvular regurgitation late after surgery raises the possibility of an infectious process (endocarditis) resulting in valve dehiscence.

## *Thromboembolic Complications*

Prosthetic valves, particularly mechanical valves, are prone to thrombus formation with consequent systemic embolic events or valve dysfunction. Echocardiographic evaluation for prosthetic valve thrombus is limited, except with very large masses, because of shadowing and reverberations. In addition, clinical events may be associated with clots smaller than the limits of clinical ultrasound resolution. Thus, echocardiography cannot exclude the possibility of thrombus on a prosthetic valve; in patients with embolic events, the prosthetic valve itself is a potential source of embolus.

## *Endocarditis*

Infection of a valve prosthesis is a serious clinical problem, so suspected endocarditis is a frequent indication for echocardiography in patients with prosthetic valves. Endocarditis on a bioprosthesis may result in vegetations similar to those seen on a native valve. However, with a mechanical valve, the infection often is paravalvular, and no discrete vegetation may be present.

# Technical Aspects of Echo Evaluation

Evaluating prosthetic valves by echocardiography has two major challenges. The normal fluid dynamics of the prosthetic valve must be distinguished from prosthetic valve dysfunction. However, the most technically limiting aspect of the echocardiographic evaluation of prosthetic valves is the problem of acoustic shadowing. The sewing rings of both surgical bioprosthetic and mechanical valves, the supporting stent of transcatheter valves, and the occluders of mechanical valves all are strong echo reflectors, resulting in acoustic shadows and reverberations ([Fig.](#page--1-43) [13.7](#page--1-43)). These reverberations and shadows obscure the motion of the valve structures and block detection of imaging and Doppler abnormalities in the acoustic shadow region. During the examination, considerable effort is directed toward using windows and views that avoid these imaging artifacts. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is particularly useful in the evaluation of prosthetic mitral valves because it provides acoustic access from the left atrial (LA) side of the valve. Three-dimensional (3D) imaging often is helpful, although acoustic shadowing and reverberations still limit optimal valve visualization.

# ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC APPROACH

# Imaging

#### *Bioprosthetic Valves*

*Stented tissue prosthetic valves* have a trileaflet structure similar to that of a native aortic valve. An M-mode recording through the leaflets shows the typical "boxlike" opening in systole (for the aortic position) or diastole (for the mitral position), as is seen with a normal native aortic valve. However, with conventional valve designs, the echogenic sewing ring and struts limit visualization of the leaflets, with the specific ultrasound appearance of the supporting structures depending on the specific model ([Fig. 13.8](#page--1-39)). When examining a patient with an unfamiliar valve type, a quick look online at valve photographs can be helpful. *Stentless bioprosthetic valves* have an echocardiographic appearance very similar to that of a native aortic valve, other than increased echogenicity in the aortic root in the early postoperative period. This valve is best identified by reviewing the chart or asking the patient about any cardiac surgical procedures before beginning the study.

Transcatheter valves (see [Fig. 13.4\)](#page--1-40) in the aortic or pulmonic position appear similar to normal native valves, with three thin valve leaflets. However, increased echogenicity or thickness of the para-annular region is evidence. Some transcatheter aortic valves have a longer supporting cage that extends into the left ventricular (LV) outflow tract or ascending aorta. Transcatheter mitral valves have a supporting cylindrical cage that extends into the LV chamber, with a variable appearance depending on specific valve type.

*Aortic homografts* appear similar to native aortic valves except for some increased thickness in the LV outflow tract and the ascending aorta at the proximal and distal suture sites. Typically, the homograft is implanted using the mini-root technique with the homograft replacing a segment of the native aorta. This approach necessitates reimplantation of the coronary arteries. In the past, the aortic homograft sometimes was positioned inside the patient's native aorta with appropriate trimming to maintain patency of the coronary ostia. In patients with endocarditis, the attached anterior mitral leaflet of the homograft is an option for patching a ventricular septal defect or abscess cavity. The echocardiographic appearance of a homograft is very similar to that of a native aortic valve, except for the associated surgical changes. Standard parasternal long- and short-axis image planes provide optimal visualization of valve leaflet anatomy and motion.

Improved images of prosthetic tissue valves can be obtained from a TEE approach, particularly for valves in the mitral position, because the ultrasound beam has a perpendicular orientation to the leaflets with no intervening structures from this approach. With aortic valve prostheses, TEE imaging is less rewarding because the posterior part of the sewing ring shadows the valve leaflets. When images of the leaflets themselves are suboptimal, Doppler data can provide valuable information.

The longevity of bioprosthesis valves typically is limited by slowly progressive tissue failure with

fibrocalcific changes resulting in leaflet deformity (leading to regurgitation), increased stiffness (leading to stenosis), or both. Echocardiographically, increased echogenicity and irregularity of the leaflets are typical, although images of the leaflets often are suboptimal because of shadowing and reverberation.

## *Mechanical Valves*

Ultrasound imaging of mechanical valves from a transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) approach is frustrating because of severe reverberations and acoustic shadowing. Although imaging provides clues to the type of valve prostheses (e.g., "low-profile" bileaflet or tilting-disk valve vs. "high-profile" ball-cage valve), obviously it is simpler to ascertain the exact valve type and size from the patient's medical record or valve identification card. Assessing motion of the valve occluder often is difficult. For example, the leading edge of a tilting-disk valve results in a strong reverberation across the image that obscures motion of the disk itself. In addition, an oblique image plane often is obtained relative to the prosthetic valve because orientation of the prosthesis within the annulus is not standard. With a tomographic plane perpendicular to the open bileaflet valve, the two leaflets can be identified clearly; this is an image plane that is best identified on multiplane TEE imaging or by using 3D volumetric imaging [\(Fig. 13.9](#page--1-44)).

Technical limitations make the identification of prosthetic valve endocarditis or thrombosis problematic because the abnormalities may be obscured by reverberations or hidden by acoustic shadowing. TEE imaging can be helpful in identifying thrombus or infected vegetations on the atrial side of a mitral prosthesis because the TEE approach avoids "masking" of the LA by the prosthetic valve from transthoracic parasternal and apical windows. In a patient with a mechanical aortic valve, the subaortic region can be evaluated well from a transthoracic approach from parasternal and apical windows. In this situation, TEE images are less helpful because of shadowing of the outflow tract by the posterior aspect of the prosthesis.

## *Microcavitation*

An incidental finding in some patients with a mechanical prosthetic valve is the phenomenon of *spontaneous contrast*. This phenomenon is similar to the spontaneous LA contrast seen in patients with an enlarged LA and low-velocity flow, which has been reported to be associated with a high propensity for thrombus formation. However, with a prosthetic valve, only a few bright mobile echogenic particles are seen downstream from the valve, even in the absence of a low flow state. The presumed mechanism of prosthetic valve spontaneous contrast is microcavitation due to impact of the occluder against the sewing ring.

## *Valved Conduits*

Ultrasound imaging of a bioprosthetic or mechanical valve in a conduit (e.g., right ventricular [RV] to pulmonary artery) is difficult because of ultrasound attenuation by the conduit prosthetic material. Stenosis in a valved conduit can occur as a result of either stenosis of the valve prosthesis or fibrotic ingrowth along the length of the conduit. In addition, residual or progressive stenosis at the proximal or distal anastomosis site can occur. Imaging the narrowing in the conduit often is difficult, but a careful Doppler examination allows detection of the abnormal flow velocities. CW Doppler is used to assess the maximum flow velocity, whereas pulsed Doppler or color flow

imaging is used to localize the level of obstruction along the length of the conduit.

# Normal Doppler Findings

#### *Prosthetic Valve "Clicks"*

The motion of the occluder of a mechanical valve (or the tissue leaflets of a biologic valve) creates a brief, intense Doppler signal that appears as a dark, narrow band of short duration on the spectral display [\(Fig. 13.10\)](#page--1-45). Audibly, this signal is similar to the valve "click" appreciated on auscultation. However, unlike in auscultation, usually both opening and closing

**Fig. 13.10 Normal mechanical valve Doppler flows.** In this patient with both aortic and mitral valve replacement, the mechanical mitral valve prosthesis (A) antegrade velocity is increased (compared with that of a native valve), but pressure half-time is steep, indicating no significant stenosis. The mechanical aortic valve *(AV)* prosthesis (B) antegrade velocity also is slightly increased compared with a native valve, but the triangular shape indicates a normal flow pattern. Prominent valve clicks are seen on both tracings.

valve clicks are noted on spectral Doppler analysis. The Doppler signals associated with valve opening and closing are similar to those seen with native valves but are of greater intensity. The motion of the occluder also results in color flow artifacts, with color signals covering large areas of the image that are inconsistent from beat to beat.

#### *Antegrade Flow Patterns and Velocities*

Bioprosthetic valves have a flow profile similar to that of a native aortic valve, with three leaflets that open to a circular orifice (in systole in the aortic position or in diastole in the mitral position), providing laminar antegrade flow with a relatively blunt flow profile. In the mitral position, the orientation of the bioprosthesis results in the inflow stream being directed anteriorly and medially toward the ventricular septum in most patients instead of toward the ventricular apex, as is seen for normal native valves. This results in a reversed vortex of blood flow in mid-diastole, as seen in an apical four-chamber view.

Flow profiles of different mechanical valves vary substantially, and none is analogous to flow across a normal native valve. Bileaflet mechanical valves have complex fluid dynamics that affect the Doppler echocardiographic evaluation of these valves. With the leaflets open, two large lateral valve orifices with a small, narrow central slit-like orifice are present. The flow velocity profile shows three peaks corresponding to these three orifices, with higher velocities in the center of each orifice. The local acceleration forces within the narrow central orifice result in localized high-pressure gradients in this region of the valve, which often are substantially higher than the overall pressure gradient across the valve ([Fig. 13.11](#page--1-46)).

The fluid dynamics of a tilting-disk valve are characterized by two orifices in the open position, one larger than the other (major vs. minor), with an asymmetric flow profile as blood accelerates along the tilted surface of the open disk. Subtle variations in this flow pattern depend on the shape of the disk (convex vs. concave surface), in addition to the sewing ring design.

With a ball-cage valve in the open position, blood flows across the sewing ring and around the ball occluder on all sides. When the valve closes, a small amount of regurgitation is seen circumferentially around the ball as it seats in the sewing ring.

Prosthetic valve normal velocities, pressure gradients, and valve areas depend on the valve type, size, and position. However, compared with a normal native valve, all prosthetic valves are inherently stenotic to some extent. Specifically, the expected antegrade velocities and pressure gradients across a normally functioning prosthetic valve are higher than the corresponding values for a native valve. Similarly, the effective orifice area of a prosthetic valve is smaller

**Fig. 13.11 Prosthetic aortic valve hemodynamics.** Schematic representation of velocity and pressure changes from the LV outflow tract to the ascending aorta *(Ao)* in the presence of a stented bioprosthesis and a bileaflet mechanical valve illustrating the phenomenon of pressure recovery. Because of pressure recovery, velocities are lower and systolic arterial pressure *(SAP)* is higher at the distal aorta than at the level of the vena contracta *(VC).* This is further exaggerated in the case of a bileaflet valve, in which the velocity is higher in the central orifice *(CO),* and thus pressure drop is higher at that level. Doppler gradients are estimated from maximal velocity at the level of the vena contracta and represent the maximal pressure drop, whereas invasive estimations of gradients usually reflect net pressure difference *(ΔP)* between LV systolic pressure *(LVSP)* and ascending aorta. *EOA,* Effective orifice area; *LO,* lateral orifice; *SV,* stroke volume in LV outflow tract. *(From Zoghbi WA, Chambers JB, Dumesnil JG, et al: Recommendations for evaluation of prosthetic valves with echocardiography and Doppler ultrasound: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography's Guidelines and Standards Committee and the Task Force on Prosthetic Valves,*  J Am Soc Echocardiogr *22[9]:975–1014, 2009.)*

Flow axis

than the orifice area of a normal native valve. In general, larger valve sizes have lower velocities and gradients and larger effective orifice areas. Mitral prostheses have lower velocities and gradients compared with aortic prostheses because valve sizes are larger and passive transcavitary flow from the atrium into the ventricle in diastole occurs with a lower pressure gradient compared with active ejection and a higher LV-to-aortic pressure gradient in systole for aortic prostheses. Expected normal velocities, pressure gradients, and valve areas for several commonly seen prosthetic valves are shown in Appendix A, Tables A.6 and A.7.

However, valve hemodynamics are also affected by patient characteristics such as body size, transvalvular volume flow, heart rate, and other clinical factors. Current guidelines recommend an echocardiogram within 3 months of valve implantation that then serves as the new baseline for each individual patient. This approach facilitates the detection of changes in prosthetic valve function over time, with each patient serving as his or her own control. Sometimes the implanted valve is relatively small for the patient's body size, resulting in *patient-prosthesis mismatch,* with baseline hemodynamics consistent with stenosis (i.e., high velocity, small valve area) despite normal valve function. A postoperative baseline study helps distinguish patient-prosthesis mismatch from progressive stenosis due to mechanical valve failure.

## *Normal Regurgitation*

Normal prosthetic valve function implies a small degree of valvular regurgitation in virtually all mechanical valves and in a high percentage (30% to 50%) of bioprosthetic valves. The spatial patterns of regurgitation correspond to the fluid dynamics of each valve type. Bioprosthetic valves typically have a small amount of central regurgitation.

When a bileaflet valve closes, two criss-cross jets of regurgitation are seen in the plane parallel to the leaflet opening plane (see [Fig. 13.6](#page--1-42)). In the perpendicular plane, two smaller diverging regurgitant jets are seen. With a tilting-disk valve, regurgitation occurs at the closure line, with the major regurgitant jet directed away from the sewing ring at the edge of the major orifice. With a single-disk valve and a central strut (e.g., Medtronic-Hall, Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, Minn.), a small central jet of regurgitation also occurs around the central hole of the disk, as might be expected. The orientation of the prosthetic valve in the annulus can be variable, depending on surgical preference, so that the open disk position and the orientation of the regurgitant jet vary correspondingly, often with additional small regurgitant jets circumferentially around the annulus. However, the total volume of regurgitation is small with normal prosthetic valve function.

On a transthoracic study, it is difficult to separate normal from pathologic prosthetic regurgitation, especially for the mitral position. On color flow imaging, normal prosthetic regurgitation tends to be a uniform color with little variance, whereas pathologic regurgitation shows aliasing and variance with a "confetti-like" appearance of the flow pattern. On a CW Doppler examination, normal prosthetic regurgitation has a low signal strength and persists through only part of the cardiac cycle. On TEE imaging, the normal patterns of prosthetic regurgitation for each valve type can be identified, keeping in mind that normal regurgitation tends to be relatively uniform in color, even though the jet area appears relatively large. Physiologic regurgitation originates within the sewing ring with typical patterns for each valve type. Pathologic regurgitation is characterized by:

- An eccentric or large jet
- Marked variance on the color flow display
- A jet that often originates around the valve sewing ring (paravalvular)
- Visualization of a proximal flow acceleration region on the LV side of the mitral valve

#### Prosthetic Valve Stenosis

#### Pressure Gradients

The principles applied to the evaluation of native valve stenosis also have been used for suspected stenosis of prosthetic valves. From a CW Doppler recording of the antegrade velocity across the valve, obtained at a parallel intercept angle, maximum instantaneous and mean pressure gradients can be calculated using the Bernoulli Eq.  $(4v^2)$ . Although the maximum velocity across a prosthetic valve is higher than that for a native valve, the shape of the velocity curve is triangular (in contrast to the rounded contour seen in aortic stenosis). Thus, the calculated mean gradient typically is less for a prosthetic valve than for a native valve with the same maximum antegrade velocity (see Fig. 13.10).

Maximum and mean pressure gradients across bioprosthetic valves calculated by Doppler echo compare well with directly measured pressure gradients (see Appendix B, Table B.16). The situation is more complex for mechanical valves because of the differing fluid dynamics of each type of prosthesis. In theory, the pressure gradient across a given degree of stenosis will be identical whether the stenosis consists of a single orifice or multiple orifices, with the Bernoulli relationship being valid for each orifice. Thus, a maximum pressure gradient of 36 mmHg will correspond to a single or multiple 3 m/s jets across the valve. However, although this theory holds true when local acceleration and viscous forces can be ignored, local higher-pressure gradients do occur with some valve types. This phenomenon has been studied most thoroughly for the bileaflet valve.

With the valve leaflets open, the bileaflet valve has a narrow, slitlike central orifice flanked by two larger semicircular orifices (see Fig. 13.11). The walls of this narrow central orifice are formed by the parallel valve disks, which are nearly perpendicular to the sewing ring of the valve. Within this narrow central flow stream, acceleration forces result in a localized high-pressure gradient (and corresponding high velocity) with rapid pressure recovery distal to the valve.

Therefore the pressure difference measured between the upstream side of the valve and this central orifice is greater than the pressure difference between the upstream and downstream sides of the valve. Because CW Doppler ultrasound records the highest velocity along the length of the ultrasound beam, this higher localized velocity is recorded. Although this high localized gradient is measured correctly, the gradient of interest is the upstream-to-downstream valve gradient. This explains the observation that, even though the correlation between Doppler and invasive pressure gradient measurements is high, the slope of the regression line indicates that the Doppler approach consistently "overestimates" the overall transvalvular gradient. This overestimation is large enough that an erroneous diagnosis of severe stenosis may be made if the phenomenon of pressure recovery is not recognized.

Interestingly, the overestimation of pressure gradients across bileaflet valves becomes less significant in the presence of prosthetic valve stenosis. The proposed mechanism for this observation is a gradual reduction in the size of the central orifice as leaflet opening is reduced. Clinically, this poses a problem in that a high velocity across a bileaflet valve could represent overestimation of the pressure gradient with normal valve function or a correct estimate of a high gradient with a stenotic valve. Again, a baseline study in the postoperative period provides a standard of comparison when subsequent valve dysfunction is suspected.

#### Valve Areas

Even when accurately measured, the physiologic limitation of transvalvular velocities across prosthetic valves is that velocities vary with volume flow rate for a given orifice area. A normally functioning valve prosthesis in an individual patient has:

- A high transvalvular velocity if cardiac output is elevated (e.g., with exercise, anemia, or fever)
- A low transvalvular velocity if cardiac output is depressed (e.g., LV dysfunction)

For these reasons, a flow-independent measure of prosthetic valve function is more useful clinically.

**AORTIC.** Bioprosthetic aortic valves have fluid dynamics similar to those of native aortic valves, and it is logical to assume that continuity equation valve area calculations are valid in this situation (Fig. 13.12). In fact, direct comparisons of Doppler echo (prosthetic aortic valve area [AVA<sub>prost</sub>]) and invasive valve areas in patients with suspected stenosis of bioprosthetic aortic valves have shown a reasonable correlation. As for a native aortic valve, the components of the continuity equation are the LV outflow tract velocity-time integral (VTI<sub>LVOT</sub>), the LV outflow tract cross-sectional area (CSA<sub>LVOT</sub>), and the aortic jet

![](_page_11_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 13.12 Continuity equation for the calculation of prosthetic aortic valve area.** LV outflow tract *(LVOT)* flow is recorded from an apical approach using pulsed Doppler with the sample volume positioned just proximal to the prosthetic valve. LVOT diameter is measured from a parasternal long-axis view for calculation of a circular cross-sectional area *(CSA)* of flow. CW Doppler is used to record the flow signal across the prosthetic valve from whichever window yields the highest velocity jet. *Ao,* Aorta; *AVR,* aortic valve replacement; *AVA,* aortic valve area; *VTI,* velocity-time integral.

velocity-time integral (VTIAo). The continuity equation, then, is:

# AVAprost L = × ( ) CSA VOT L VTI V VOT A TI <sup>o</sup> (Eq. 13.1)

LV outflow tract velocity is recorded from an apical approach using pulsed Doppler echo with the sample volume positioned proximal to the prosthetic valve, thereby avoiding the small region of flow acceleration immediately adjacent to the valve. Aortic jet velocity is recorded with CW Doppler from whichever window gives the highest velocity signal, as for native valve stenosis. LV outflow tract diameter is measured in a parasternal long-axis view in midsystole from the septal endocardium to the anterior mitral leaflet parallel to and immediately adjacent to the aortic valve [\(Fig. 13.13](#page--1-48)). Direct measurement of outflow tract diameter is preferable to the use of the implanted prosthetic valve size, because valve size relates to the external diameter of the sewing ring, not the effective diameter of the subvalvular flow region. A circular cross-sectional LV outflow tract area is calculated as π(D/2)[2](#page--1-49) from this diameter measurement.

The use of the continuity equation for mechanical aortic valves is more problematic. Presumably, if the transvalvular velocity-time integral is an accurate reflection of transvalvular volume flow rate, then calculated valve areas should be accurate. Remember that the continuity equation assumes a flat flow velocity profile in the stenotic orifice (or vena contracta), as

![](_page_11_Figure_8.jpeg)

**Fig. 13.13 Bioprosthetic aortic valve stenosis.** In this patient with bioprosthetic aortic valve stenosis, the severely calcified valve leaflets are seen in the long-axis view and in a zoomed image for measurement of outflow tract diameter. Mitral annular calcification also is present. Transvalvular velocity is 4.2 m/s from the apex and 4.4 m/s from the suprasternal notch *(SSN)* approach, consistent with severe prosthetic valve stenosis. Severe stenosis is confirmed by the increased acceleration time and the rounded shape of the velocity curve. *Ao,* Aorta; *PG,* pressure gradient; *Vel,* velocity.

well as proximal to the valve. Clearly, this assumption is not true for bileaflet valves. The local high velocities in the central orifice will result in a significant error in measurement of volume flow rate across the valve orifice, with a consequent underestimation of valve area. However, for tilting-disk valves, limited data suggest that the continuity equation is reasonably accurate, despite complex fluid dynamics, because the CW velocity signal provides an approximation of the spatial mean flow velocity across the valve (see Appendix B, Table B.17).

Another approach to the evaluation of suspected prosthetic aortic valve stenosis is to measure the "step-up" in velocity across the valve. The ratio of the outflow tract velocity to the aortic jet velocity reflects the degree of stenosis—if no obstruction is present, these velocities will be nearly equal with a ratio close to 1; as the degree of narrowing increases, the aortic jet velocity will increase with no change in outflow tract velocity, thus resulting in a progressive decline in the velocity ratio. Because all prosthetic valves are inherently stenotic to some degree, the "normal" velocity ratio across an aortic prosthesis ranges from 0.35 to 0.50, compared with 0.75 to 0.90 for a normal native aortic valve.

The velocity ratio has several advantages because it:

- Takes volume flow rate into account
- Does not require an outflow tract diameter measurement
- Is easily measured and reproducible
- Serves as a baseline "normal" value for comparison on follow-up studies

Some investigators advocate measuring the velocity ratio with increases in flow rate (e.g., with exercise) to increase specificity for excluding prosthetic valve stenosis. Pragmatically, even if Doppler velocities and continuity equation valve areas overestimate the degree of prosthetic valve stenosis, in an individual patient a *change* in velocity or valve area is valuable in clinical management decisions ([Table 13.2\)](#page-12-0).

**MITRAL.** Prosthetic mitral valve areas can be estimated using the pressure half-time approach, as for native mitral valve stenosis. The expected normal half-time for a prosthetic valve is longer than that of a native valve, with the specific value depending on valve type and size. For bioprosthetic mitral valves, valve area can be estimated from the same formula as for native valves:

$$MVA = 220/T\frac{1}{2}$$
 (Eq. 13.2)

where the pressure half-time ( T <sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup> ) is measured in milliseconds, as described in Chapter 11.

Somewhat surprisingly, the empirical constant 220 also appears to provide a reasonable approximation of mitral valve area for mechanical prostheses. With a bileaflet valve, the higher localized velocities in the central slitlike orifice affect the accuracy of pressure gradient calculations. However, the pressure half-time measurement is less affected because it depends on the *time course* of the velocity decline relative to the maximum velocity rather than on the velocities themselves.

Continuity equation valve area also can be calculated for a mitral prosthesis (in the absence of mitral

regurgitation) by using the antegrade stroke volume across the aortic or pulmonic valve in the equation.

The antegrade velocity curve across a mitral bioprosthesis is recorded from an apical approach using pulsed, high pulse repetition frequency, or CW Doppler ultrasound. Care in positioning the transducer is needed because inflow often is directed obliquely into the ventricular chamber. Some echocardiographers find it helpful to use the color flow image to aid in alignment of the Doppler beam parallel to the inflow stream. In many patients, after mitral valve replacement, the inflow stream is directed anteriorly and medially toward the ventricular septum. In these patients, a low parasternal window may provide an optimal intercept angle for recording antegrade velocity. As for native mitral valve stenosis, Doppler acquisition parameters are adjusted to show a smooth velocity deceleration slope and a band of velocity signals along the edge of the curve.

# Prosthetic Valve Regurgitation

## *Detection*

The echocardiographic approaches described for the evaluation of native valve regurgitation in Chapter 12 also apply to the evaluation of prosthetic valve regurgitation. The major differences between native or prosthetic valves are:

- The prosthetic valve has a higher antegrade velocity.
- The degree of normal prosthetic regurgitation is greater than the trivial amounts of native valve regurgitation seen in normal individuals.
- Acoustic shadowing, reverberations, and beamwidth artifact make the evaluation of a prosthetic valve more difficult.

These differences decrease the sensitivity of transthoracic echocardiography for the detection of prosthetic regurgitation, so TEE imaging is needed more frequently.

Transthoracic color Doppler flow imaging for the detection of prosthetic valve regurgitation can be helpful, particularly if a view in which the ultrasound beam has access to the chamber receiving the regurgitant flow without first traversing the valve prosthesis can be obtained. For the aortic valve, both parasternal and apical views are helpful because the ultrasound signal reaches the LV outflow tract region without intercepting the valve prosthesis, thereby avoiding the problem of acoustic shadowing. For the mitral valve, the parasternal approach is helpful if a view in which the LA side of the valve is not shadowed by the valve prosthesis can be obtained. Apical views often are limited because of acoustic shadowing, but occasionally, a paraprosthetic jet can be identified from this approach. In addition to acoustic shadowing, color artifacts are prominent in patients with prosthetic valves, and these artifacts further obscure the detection of abnormal flow signals.

CW Doppler also is helpful for the detection of prosthetic regurgitation, with the advantage of a wide beam size at the depth of a prosthetic valve and a high signal-to-noise ratio, enhancing the likelihood that a weaker signal or eccentric jet (i.e., paraprosthetic regurgitation) will be identified [\(Fig. 13.14](#page--1-50)). The timing of the presumed regurgitant signal is extremely important for correct identification of the origin of the Doppler signal. Many laboratories find it helpful to examine the prosthetic valve with CW Doppler

**Fig. 13.15 Continuous-wave Doppler prosthetic mitral regurgitation.** CW Doppler recording of mechanical prosthetic mitral regurgitation obtained from an apical *(APX)* window. The regurgitant signal *(arrow)* starts immediately after the mitral closure click and continues up to the onset of antegrade flow across the prosthesis in diastole. The signal is not as dense as antegrade flow, thus suggesting that regurgitation is not severe. However, TEE is preferred for evaluation of regurgitant severity of a mechanical mitral valve *(MV)* because shadowing often results in underestimation from the TTE approach.

Because of the problems of acoustic shadowing and reverberations, even the most carefully performed transthoracic examinations have a low sensitivity for the detection and quantitation of prosthetic regurgitation. Especially for the mitral position, the TEE approach provides both improved image quality and the opportunity to interrogate the valve from the LA side—that is, the acoustic shadow now will obscure the LV rather than the LA. Thus, when prosthetic mitral valve regurgitation is suspected, a TEE study is recommended ([Fig. 13.16](#page--1-52)). A transthoracic study showing prosthetic regurgitation can be clinically useful (high positive predictive value) but rarely allows for accurate quantitation of mitral regurgitant severity. A transthoracic study that does not show prosthetic regurgitation does not exclude this possibility (low negative predictive value).

## *Severity and Etiology*

When prosthetic regurgitation is detected, the first step is deciding whether "normal" or pathologic prosthetic regurgitation is present. Although the normal backflow across the valve represents a small volume of blood, the color jets on TEE imaging can be fairly large in area. Distinguishing features are the characteristic pattern for each valve type, a uniform color pattern rather than the mosaic flow disturbance seen with pathologic regurgitation, and the absence of other features (increased antegrade velocity, chamber sizes and function, pulmonary hypertension) to suggest significant regurgitation.

Reverberations from the valve obscure the LV.

Pathologic regurgitation of surgical bioprosthetic valves most often is due to degenerative changes of the leaflets (see [Fig. 13.16](#page-14-0)). This process can be slowly progressive, with gradually increasing severity of a central regurgitant stream, or it can occur abruptly, with cusp rupture adjacent to a fibrocalcific nodule. The cause of mechanical valves regurgitation most often is incomplete closure resulting from pannus ingrowth around the sewing ring or from thrombus formation. With transcatheter aortic valve implantation, paravalvular regurgitation can occur immediately after valve implantation, likely due to undersizing of the prosthesis or to calcification from the native valve preventing a fully circular deployment, thus allowing flow around the valve stent or supporting cage [\(Fig. 13.17](#page-15-0)).

Paraprosthetic regurgitation also can occur with mechanical valves or surgically implanted bioprosthetic valves. Immediately after implantation, a small degree of paraprosthetic regurgitation is normal on intraoperative TEE echocardiography and usually does not have long-term adverse clinical consequences. However, more severe or persistent paravalvular regurgitation is likely to cause symptoms. The cause of paraprosthetic regurgitation most often is a scarred and/or calcified annulus resulting in disruption of the sutures securing the valve or a paravalvular abscess with tissue destruction. Distinguishing prosthetic from paraprosthetic regurgitation is difficult on transthoracic imaging; in most cases, TEE is needed [\(Fig. 13.18](#page--1-53)). The regurgitant jet originates externally from the sewing ring, with an eccentric jet extending into the receiving chamber. A single or multiple paraprosthetic jet or jets may be present. Color flow imaging shows proximal flow acceleration (on the LV side of the mitral valve) into the regurgitant orifice that facilitates identification of the paraprosthetic origin of the signal. 3D TEE is useful for procedural guidance for transcatheter closure of paravalvular leaks (see Chapter 18).

Although evaluation of prosthetic regurgitation follows the same principles as for native valve disease, quantitation can be challenging. Qualitative measures remain clinically helpful, including:

- The shape, origin, and orientation of the regurgitant jet
- The circumferential extent of the diastolic flow disturbance around a transcatheter valve
- Vena contracta diameter (if visualized)
- The intensity and shape of the CW Doppler signal
- Evidence for distal flow reversals (e.g., descending aorta diastolic flow in aortic regurgitation)
- The antegrade velocity across the prosthetic valve
- Estimated pulmonary pressures (particularly with mitral regurgitation)

Calculations of regurgitant volume and orifice area are more difficult because calculation of antegrade flow rates across a prosthetic valve is challenging and jets are usually eccentric, thereby limiting the proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) approach. Signs of severe prosthetic regurgitation are helpful in some clinical situations (see [Table 13.2\)](#page-12-0). However, the presence of pathologic prosthetic regurgitation and its clinical consequences (e.g., hemolysis, heart failure)

often is more important than exact measures of severity.

# Other Echocardiographic Findings

In addition to direct imaging or Doppler evaluation of regurgitation, several other findings on the echocardiographic examination are integrated in the overall interpretation of prosthetic valve function. These include:

- LV size, hypertrophy, and systolic function
- Antegrade prosthetic valve flow velocity
- Pulmonary artery pressures

For example, persistent LV hypertrophy after aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis raises the possibility of prosthetic valve stenosis or patient-prosthesis mismatch. In other cases, LV dilation is due to aortic or mitral prosthetic regurgitation with resultant volume overload. A hyperdynamic (but previously normal) LV may indicate prosthetic mitral regurgitation. Although it is difficult to separate persistent postoperative abnormalities from new pathologic findings in some patients, a change between examinations is of concern.

An increase in antegrade velocity may be due to increased volume flow because of prosthetic regurgitation rather than prosthetic stenosis. In this case, although the calculated gradient will be higher, the valve area will be unchanged. Alternatively, an increased flow velocity across the prosthetic valve may be due to a high cardiac output state (e.g., fever, anemia, or anxiety). In this situation, antegrade velocities across the other cardiac valves will be increased proportionately.

Although pulmonary hypertension can persist after successful mitral valve surgery, *recurrent* pulmonary hypertension (after an initial postoperative decline) often is due to prosthetic valve dysfunction.

# LIMITATIONS AND ALTERNATE APPROACHES

The major limitation of transthoracic echocardiography for the evaluation of prosthetic valves is technical, specifically reverberations, artifacts, and acoustic shadowing. The last of these problems can be circumvented to some extent with the TEE approach by casting the shadow in the opposite direction. Reverberations and other ultrasound artifacts remain problems with both approaches.

Other limitations are overestimation of transvalvular pressure gradients with bileaflet mechanical valves, limited validation of valve area calculations for mechanical valves, and the problem of differentiating "normal" from pathologic prosthetic valve regurgitation.

Importantly, the same factors that can lead to errors in the evaluation of native valves also are significant limitations in the evaluation of prosthetic valves. Most notably, these factors include ultrasound tissue penetration, Doppler intercept angle assumptions, accurate diameter measurement, correct image orientation, and correct identification of the origin of Doppler signals.

When the echocardiographic examination finding is negative or when the examination yields results discordant with other clinical findings, other diagnostic procedures are appropriate. Cardiac computed tomographic imaging allows the evaluation of mechanical valve occluder motion and now is recommended instead of fluoroscopy for this indication. Cardiac computed tomography also is the most accurate approach for the evaluation of pannus formation and paravalvular thrombus. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging also is helpful, although artifact from metallic valve components limits visualization of valve structures. Cardiac catheterization can be performed with direct measurement of intracardiac pressures to confirm the pressure gradient across the valve and measure pulmonary artery pressures. Angiographic evaluation (LV for mitral regurgitation, aortic root for aortic regurgitation) is helpful in evaluating prosthetic regurgitation on a semiquantitative (0 to 4+) scale.

## CLINICAL UTILITY

# Baseline Prosthetic Valve Function After Implantation

A baseline echocardiographic examination after implantation of a prosthetic valve is recommended in all patients. Wide variability exists in normal antegrade velocities and in the degree of "normal" regurgitation across prosthetic valves even for a given size, type, and position. Establishing baseline Doppler findings in each patient soon after implantation serves as a reference point in case prosthetic valve dysfunction is suspected in the future. Approximately 6 to 8 weeks postoperatively is a reasonable time to obtain this baseline study, because by then the patient has recovered from surgery, is returning to cardiology follow-up, and has a stable hemodynamic status with a normal cardiac output. This timing of the examination also allows an initial evaluation of regression of LV hypertrophy or dilation, recovery of LV systolic function, changes in pulmonary artery pressures, and other long-term effects of the valve surgery.

## Prosthetic Valve Stenosis

Echocardiography is the initial diagnostic approach to the evaluation of suspected prosthetic valve stenosis ([Figs. 13.19](#page--1-54) and [13.20](#page--1-55)). The antegrade velocity and mean gradient across the prosthetic valve, particularly in comparison with previous data in that patient, may be diagnostic. Valve area can be calculated by the continuity equation for valves in the aortic [\(Fig. 13.21\)](#page--1-56) position and by the pressure half-time method for valves in the mitral ([Fig.](#page--1-57) [13.22\)](#page--1-57) or tricuspid position ([Fig. 13.23\)](#page--1-58). Despite the overestimation of the average transvalvular gradient that occurs with Doppler evaluation of bileaflet mechanical valves, this approach still is helpful in assessing changes over time in an individual patient.

The differential diagnosis of an increased antegrade velocity across the valve includes a high cardiac output state or coexisting valvular regurgitation, in addition to prosthetic valve stenosis. A significant prosthetic or paraprosthetic regurgitant jet can increase the antegrade volume flow rate across the valve

**Fig. 13.19 Approach to evaluation of prosthetic aortic stenosis.** A practical approach to the evaluation of possible prosthetic aortic stenosis *(AS)* is to start with standard measures of stenosis severity including antegrade velocity *(Vmax),* mean pressure gradient *(ΔP)*, effective orifice area *(EOA),* and the ratio of LV outflow to aortic velocity. Although normal values for each valve type and size should be referenced, the simple break points of 3 and 4 m/s are a quick first step. In those with intermediate measures of stenosis severity, the shape of the velocity curve can be helpful with a triangular shape (short time to peak velocity [TPV]) suggesting normal valve function and a rounded waveform (longer TPV) suggesting significant stenosis. *(This approach is abstracted from Zoghbi WA, Chambers JB, Dumesnil JG, et al: Recommendations for evaluation of prosthetic valves with echocardiography and Doppler ultrasound: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography's Guidelines and Standards Committee and the Task Force on Prosthetic Valves,* J Am Soc Echocardiogr *22[9]:975–1014, 2009.)*

**Fig. 13.20 Approach to the evaluation of prosthetic mitral stenosis.** A practical approach to the evaluation of possible prosthetic mitral stenosis *(MS)* is to start with standard measures of stenosis severity, including antegrade velocity *(Vmax),* mean pressure gradient *(ΔP)*, effective orifice area *(EOA),* and the pressure half-time *(T <sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup> ).* Although normal values for each valve type and size should be referenced, these simple break points are a quick first step. In patients with intermediate measures of stenosis severity, the differential diagnosis includes significant stenosis, patient-prosthesis mismatch *(PPM),* and a high flow state. In this setting, additional diagnostic evaluation, such as computed tomographic imaging or cardiac catheterization, may be needed. *(This approach is abstracted from Zoghbi WA, Chambers JB, Dumesnil JG, et al: Recommendations for evaluation of prosthetic valves with echocardiography and Doppler ultrasound: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography's Guidelines and Standards Committee and the Task Force on Prosthetic Valves,* J Am Soc Echocardiogr *22[9]:975–1014, 2009.)*

**Fig. 13.21 Mechanical aortic valve thrombosis.** This 56-year-old man with a mechanical aortic valve replacement *(AVR)* presented with heart failure and noncompliance with anticoagulation. 2D transthoracic imaging showed reverberations and shadowing from the prosthesis, with poor visualization of occluder motion. However, Doppler data were diagnostic, with the CW Doppler signal of transaortic flow increasing from a baseline of 2.8 m/s (maximum gradient 31 mmHg) to 5.5 m/s (maximum gradient 123 mmHg), concurrent with a decline in the LV outflow tract *(LVOT)* velocity *(V)* and consistent with a decreased cardiac output. This patient has a mechanical mitral valve as well, as indicated by the two prosthetic valve clicks *(arrows)*. *CHF,* Congestive heart failure; *PG,* pressure gradient.

substantially, thus resulting in a high velocity and a high transvalvular gradient. Valve area, however, remains relatively normal.

With careful examination techniques, the antegrade velocity across the prosthetic valve can be recorded in nearly all patients. When signal strength is suboptimal, invasive evaluation may be required. This is most likely for the evaluation of a prosthetic valve in a conduit (typically RV or right atrium [RA] to pulmonary artery). In this situation, the valve is difficult to image because of shadowing by the vascular graft, and it is difficult to obtain a window where the Doppler beam is parallel to flow across the prosthetic valve.

# Transcatheter Valve Implantation

Echocardiographic evaluation is a standard component in evaluation of patients undergoing transcatheter valve implantation to assess the severity of disease before the procedure [\(Fig. 13.24\)](#page--1-59) and to assess for complications and hemodynamics results after valve implantation ([Fig. 13.25](#page--1-57)). Transcatheter aortic valve implantation now is routinely performed for treatment of severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, particularly in older adults and those at high risk for a surgical procedure. In addition to a baseline postimplantation study, routine annual imaging is recommended to evaluate valve function and any associated abnormalities ([Table 13.3\)](#page--1-60).

Color Doppler *(left)* of the bioprosthetic tricuspid valve suggests mimal stenosis with a color flow stream filling the annulus area. CW Doppler *(right)* shows a moderately dense tricuspid regurgitation signal with a velocity *(Vel)* of 3 m/s *(arrow)* indicating only mild pulmonary hypertension.

In this 34-year-old man with tetralogy of Fallot repair in childhood, the bioprosthetic pulmonic valve is calcified (arrow) and relatively immobile on 2D imaging (upper left). Color Doppler (upper right) shows flow acceleration on the RV side of the valve with a flow disturbance that begins at the valve level. CW Doppler (bottom) shows an antegrade velocity of 4.5 m/s, consistent with severe stenosis. Coexisting pulmonic regurgitation is seen on the CW Doppler tracing.

#### Patient-Prosthesis Mismatch

In some patients, the size of the prosthetic aortic valve that can be implanted results in inadequate blood flow to meet the metabolic demands of the patient, even when the prosthetic valve itself is functioning normally. This situation, called patient-prosthesis mismatch, as previously noted, is defined as an indexed effective orifice area ≤0.85 cm²/m² and is a predictor of a high transvalvular gradient, persistent ventricular hypertrophy, and an increased rate of cardiac events after aortic

valve replacement. The impact of a relatively small valve area is most noticeable with severe patient-prosthesis mismatch, defined as an orifice area 0.65 cm²/m². Patient-prosthesis mismatch can be avoided by choosing a valve prosthesis that will have an adequate indexed orifice area, based on the patient's body size and annular dimension. In some cases, annular enlargement or other approaches should be considered to allow implantation of an appropriately sized valve or avoidance of a prosthetic valve.

**Fig. 13.25 Transcatheter pulmonic valve-in-valve prosthesis.** In the same patient as [Fig. 13.24,](#page--1-59) a transcatheter pulmonic valve replacement was placed within the old surgical bioprosthetic valve. On 2D imaging *(upper left)* the valve leaflets now are thin *(arrow)* with normal systolic opening. Color Doppler *(upper right)* still shows signal aliasing in the RV outflow tract and pulmonary artery *(PA)* with CW Doppler *(bottom)* showing a velocity *(Vel)* of 3.0 m/s across the transcatheter valve *(bottom).* However, the velocity of flow proximal to the pulmonic valve was 2.6 m/s, so these findings are consistent with normal valve function and a high cardiac output. *PG,* Pressure gradient.

## Prosthetic Valve Regurgitation

Transthoracic echocardiography is accurate for the diagnosis of aortic prosthetic valve regurgitation and for the differentiation of normal from pathologic regurgitation [\(Figs. 13.26](#page--1-62) and [13.27](#page--1-61)). However, because of acoustic shadowing, the sensitivity for the detection of mitral prosthetic regurgitation is lower, and it is more difficult to distinguish normal from pathologic regurgitation. TEE echocardiography imaging is needed when this diagnosis is suspected on clinical grounds. TEE echocardiography has a high accuracy for detection of prosthetic regurgitation and reliably distinguishes transprosthetic from paraprosthetic regurgitation.

# Prosthetic Valve Endocarditis

Detection of valvular vegetations on prosthetic valves is difficult with transthoracic echocardiography because of reverberations and acoustic shadowing ([Fig. 13.28](#page--1-63)). Features that may increase the suspicion of prosthetic valve endocarditis on a transthoracic echocardiographic examination include Doppler evidence of valve dysfunction (either regurgitation due to incomplete closure or stenosis due to an infected pannus on the inflow surface of the valve), evidence of valve instability (i.e., "rocking"), an unexplained increase in pulmonary artery pressures, or an interval change in chamber dimensions. Prosthetic valve endocarditis often involves the sewing ring and annulus, resulting in formation

of a paravalvular abscess ("ring" abscess) rather than the typical vegetation seen with native valve infection. Identification of an abscess is limited on TTE echocardiography.

Thus, given the technical and pathologic peculiarities of the evaluation of suspected prosthetic valve endocarditis, TEE imaging is needed in the majority of these patients. TEE echocardiography has a high sensitivity for the detection of prosthetic valve endocarditis, abscess formation, or both. As for native valve endocarditis (see Chapter 14), cardiac abscesses may be echo dense or relatively echo free. Persistent infection also may result in an aneurysm instead of an abscess cavity [\(Fig. 13.29](#page--1-64)).

## Prosthetic Valve Thrombosis

In patients with embolic events presumed secondary to prosthetic valve thrombosis, even TEE echocardiographic results may be negative if the thrombi are small or if a new thrombus has not formed since the embolic event. When thrombi are documented on TEE echocardiography, this finding may be important in patient management. However, an

**Fig. 13.28 Bioprosthetic mitral valve endocarditis.** *(Left)* Although TTE images often are nondiagnostic for prosthetic valve endocarditis, the large valvular vegetation on the stented tissue mitral prosthesis in this patient is obvious *(arrow)* in a low parasternal long-axis view. In the image on the *right,* the depth has been decreased to improve image resolution, which allows the vegetation within the struts of the prosthetic valve to be seen.

**Fig. 13.29 Aneurysm of the mitral aortic intravalvular fibrosa.** In a 28-year-old man with a mechanical aortic valve replacement, the TTE long-axis image *(left)* shows a pseudoaneurysm between the posterior aspect of the aortic prosthesis and the base of the anterior mitral leaflet *(arrow)*. The corresponding TEE image *(right)* shows the narrow neck of the pseudoaneurysm *(pA; double arrow)*. Doppler color flow imaging showed flow into the pseudoaneurysm from the LV in systole (with flow back into the LV) and the associated collapse of the pseudoaneurysm in diastole. *Ao,* Aorta.

<span id="page-26-0"></span>**Fig. 13.30 Mechanical mitral valve thrombosis on transthoracic echocardiography imaging.** This pregnant woman with a bileaflet mechanical mitral valve *(MV)* presented with acute heart failure. TTE shows a narrow inflow stream on color Doppler in an apical two-chamber view *(left).* The CW Doppler mean transmitral gradient *(PG; center)* is markedly elevated at 26 mmHg with a prolonged pressure half-time. The CW Doppler signal of the tricuspid regurgitant jet *(right)* shows a peak velocity *(Vmax)* of 3.6 m/s. Estimated RA pressure was 10 mmHg, so that estimated pulmonary systolic pressure is 46 mmHg. Her previous echocardiograms had shown a transmitral gradient of 4 to 5 mmHg and normal pulmonary pressures. Thus, these findings suggest prosthetic valve stenosis, likely due to acute thrombosis. *MVR,* Mitral valve replacement; *VTI,* velocity-time integral.

<span id="page-26-1"></span>**Fig. 13.31 Transesophageal echocardiography mechanical mitral valve thrombosis.** In the same patient as [Fig. 13.30](#page-26-0), TEE imaging shows the prosthetic mitral valve replacement *(MVR)* in diastole *(left)* and systole *(right)* with normal motion of one of the valve occluders *(arrows)*. The other occluder is immobile with hazy echo densities filling the normal valve orifice consistent with thrombosis, which was confirmed at surgery.

embolic event in a patient with a prosthetic valve (especially mechanical) presumably is related to the presence of a prosthetic valve, even if TEE echocardiography is negative. Thus, the potential clinical implications of the study results should be considered *before* the examination. If the treatment and subsequent management would be the same whether or not a thrombus is documented, then TEE echocardiography is not necessary. If documentation of a thrombus or exclusion of other possible abnormalities would affect patient management, then TEE echocardiography examination is appropriate. Because infected pannus due to prosthetic valve endocarditis cannot be differentiated from thrombus on ultrasound imaging, careful clinical and bacteriologic correlation is needed whenever an abnormal valve-associated mass is observed [\(Figs.](#page-26-0) [13.30](#page-26-0) and [13.31](#page-26-1)).
