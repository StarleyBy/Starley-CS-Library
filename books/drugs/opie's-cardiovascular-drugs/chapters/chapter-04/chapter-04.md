# Metabolic Syndrome and Prediabetes

Obesity has become a common problem in Western society, and it is a strong predictor of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).1,2 In the United States it is estimated that almost one-third of the population will develop T2DM in their lifetimes. T2DM, in turn, predisposes to cardiovascular abnormalities.<sup>2</sup>

An increased waistline is one of the five criteria of the metabolic syndrome (MetSyn)—a prediabetic state—in addition to fasting hyperglycemia and blood pressure (BP) elevation, increased circulating triglycerides (TGs), and decreased circulating highdensity lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (HDL-C) (Fig. 4.1).3 Three of these are required for the diagnosis of the MetSyn (Table 4.1).4 Abdominal girth, insulin resistance (IR), and insulin response are the three main factors that, each independently, increase the metabolic risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).<sup>5</sup> However, waist circumference is a better predictor of the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) than body mass index (BMI) is.<sup>6</sup>

Abdominal adipose tissue is now recognized as a metabolically active organ and regarded as the basic abnormality in the Met-Syn by the International Diabetes Federation.<sup>7</sup> There are strong links between excessive abdominal fat leading to excessive circulating free fatty acids (FFAs) and cytokines, which contribute to the other four features of the MetSyn and help explain worsening IR (Fig. 4.2).6 The MetSyn is of clinical importance in that it increases the risk of CVD and especially T2DM, driven almost entirely by the fasting glucose component.<sup>8</sup> Currently an increasing number of patients with the MetSyn obesity or T2DM are being treated by cardiologists, often in close collaboration with primary care physicians and diabetologists.

#### *HDL & TG IN METABOLIC SYNDROME & DIABETES*

![](_page_1_Figure_2.jpeg)

Fig. 4.1 HDL and TG in metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Consistent features (see right side of the figure) are the increased circulating levels of triglycerides (TGs) and decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The basic problem lies in increased levels of the atherogenic particles: very-low density lipoproteins (VLDLs), triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TG-rL), and apoliprotein (Apo) B. (Apos have detergent-like properties that solubilize the hydrophobic lipoproteins.) Levels of TG-rL and Apo B are increased by excess hepatic synthesis of VLDL, high postprandial TG concentrations after a fatty meal, and low levels of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity. Adipose tissue releases excess free fatty acids (FFAs), which with hyperglycemia leads to increased hepatic production of VLDL. Cholesterol-ester transfer protein (CETP) increases the transfer of TG to HDL particles to form TG-rich HDL, with a simultaneous transfer of cholesteryl esters (CE) from the HDL particles to TG-rL. TG-rich HDL is broken down by hepatic lipase (HL) to form small, dense HDL particles. A similar process leads to increased formation of small dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles.

# **Risks of Metabolic Syndrome**

MetSyn comprises a group of cardiometabolic risk factors, each of which individually may be of only borderline significance, but when taken together indicate enhanced risk of development of overt T2DM or CVD. While a useful tool to communicate underlying pathophysiology and shared risk factors, influential authorities have questioned the independent predictive value of the MetSyn for the future development of T2DM and stress the role of one of the five components alone; glucose. For cardiologists, becoming alert to risk-factor clustering, including abdominal obesity, high TGs, low HDL-C, prehypertension, and hyperglycemia, is an important widening of vision. 10 The risk of developing future CVD is proportional to the number of MetSyn features. <sup>11</sup> With four or five features, the risk of T2DM was 25-fold greater than with no features and still much more than with only one feature. 12 In an analysis of persons in 37 studies, MetSyn had a relative risk of 1.78 for future cardiovascular events, and the association remained after adjusting for traditional cardiovascular risk factors (relative risk [RR], 1.54; confidence interval [CI], 1.32–1.79). <sup>13</sup> The International Day for Evaluation of Abdominal Obesity study measured waistlines in primary care patients spread worldwide to confirm an association between waist and CVD (RR 1.36) and more so with T2DM (RR 1.59 in men and 1.83 in women).

#### **METABOLIC SYNDROME**

![](_page_3_Figure_2.jpeg)

Fig. 4.2 Metabolic syndrome. The adipose tissue releases increased free fatty acids (FFAs) into the circulation, thereby inhibiting the uptake of glucose by muscle. Plasma glucose rises and elicits an insulin response. However, the pancreas is damaged by the high FFA levels and increased cytokines. The net effect is increased fasting plasma glucose (FPG) despite the increased circulating insulin (insulin resistance). Increased plasma FFA and glucose predispose to increased hepatic synthesis of triglycerides (TGs) and increased blood levels of TG, which in turn decrease levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Increased release of angiotensin II (A-II) from the abdominal fat causes vasoconstriction and increases the blood pressure (BP). F, Female; M, male. For details, see Opie LH. Metabolic syndrome. Circulation 2007;115:e32.

#### **Insulin Resistance**

IR leads to the MetSyn $^5$  via increased circulating FFA (Fig. 4.2) and elevated glucose production in the liver, which are the precursors of T2DM.  $^{14}$  There is a dose-response effect of elevated plasma FFA on insulin signaling.  $^{15}$  Importantly, early life dietary patterns strongly predispose to IR.

How is obesity related to IR? Already modestly elevated FFA often observed in obese persons, and in some increased FFA flux, inhibit insulin signaling and stimulate nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) to promote IR (Figure 1 in Kim, 2012). AFκB in turn stimulates macrophages to provoke the chronic low-grade inflammatory response (Figure 2 in Kim, 2012) with increased plasma levels of C-reactive protein, and inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor—alpha, interleukin (IL) 6, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, and IL-8, and the multifunctional proteins leptin and osteopontin. Are "Western" high-fat diet experimentally enhances such cytokine production, whereas exercise diminishes it. The overall sequence is:

Obesity  $\rightarrow$  FFA flux  $\rightarrow$  NF $\kappa$ B  $\rightarrow$  macrophages  $\rightarrow$  inflammatory cytokines  $\rightarrow$  insulin resistance

# **Diabetes Prevention**

# **Lifestyle Changes to Slow the Onset of Diabetes**

The transition from MetSyn to full-blown T2DM can be significantly lessened by lifestyle intervention. Walking only approximately 19km per week can be beneficial in treating MetSyn. <sup>18</sup> However, more intense intervention is needed for more substantial change. Tuomilehto et al. <sup>19</sup> studied a group of overweight subjects with impaired glucose tolerance who, on average, also had the features of the MetSyn. Dietary advice and exercise programs were individually tailored. The five aims were weight reduction, decreased fat intake, decreased saturated fat intake, increased fiber intake, and increased endurance exercise (at least 30 minutes daily). Of these, increased exercise was achieved in 86% of participants, and the other components less frequently. After a mean duration of 3.2 years, the relative risk for new T2DM in the lifestyle intervention group was  $0.4 \ (P < 0.001)$ .

In the Diabetes Prevention Group,<sup>20</sup> similar subjects were given lifestyle modification or metformin for a mean of 2.8 years. Lifestyle intervention was very intense with a 16-lesson curriculum

covering diet, exercise, and behavior modification taught by case managers on a one-to-one basis during the first 24 weeks after enrollment. Lifestyle intervention was more effective than metformin in delaying the onset of T2DM, and both were more effective than placebo in preventing new T2DM.

However, while lifestyle intervention may significantly reduce the severity of DM, lifestyle changes seem to have little effect on the cardiovascular risk seen in T2DM. In the Look-AHEAD study, the National Institute of Health sponsored a randomized controlled trial, assessing if Intensive Lifestyle Intervention (ILI) or Diabetes Support and Education (DSE) would lead to cardiovascular benefits in overweight or obese T2DM patients.<sup>21</sup> Look-AHEAD was stopped prematurely because of futility, as there was no difference in reduction of cardiovascular events between the two groups. For the ILI group, the cardiovascular event rate was 1.83 per 100 patient-years while the DSE group had a similar rate of 1.92 events for 100 patient-years (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83–1.09, P = 0.51). However, other aspects of DM morbidity were improved in the ILI group, such as glucose and lipid control biomarkers, sleep apnea, liver fat, depression, quality of life, knee pain, inflammation, sexual function, and kidney disease. Overall, these outcomes reduced health care costs of the ILI group.

Is the protection from DM found in the Diabetes Prevention Group study sustained? The postintervention 10-year follow-up says no, with an equal incidence of new T2DM in placebo, former lifestyle, and metformin groups. Yet the cumulative incidence of T2DM remained lowest in the lifestyle group. Thus, prevention or delay of T2DM with lifestyle intervention or metformin may persist for at least 10 years.

#### **Blood Pressure and Lifestyle**

Modest BP elevation, a component of the MetSyn, is often associated with overweight and obesity. Weight loss and exercise in the setting of intensive behavioral intervention in the MetSyn can reduce systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the range of 8 mmHg with small additional reductions if the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is added. When added drugs are required,  $\beta$ -blockers and diuretics should be considered second-line agents and avoided except when there are compelling indications. There is now growing but controversial evidence that new T2DM may develop during the therapy of hypertension, more so with  $\beta$ -blockers and diuretics than with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (Fig. 4.3). There is a "weight of evidence against

β-blockers" as first choice for obese patients with hypertension.<sup>25</sup> A network meta-analysis linked diuretic and β-blocker therapy separately to new T2DM in hypertension (Fig. 4.3).<sup>26</sup> Thus, current European Hypertension Guidelines list MetSyn as a possible contradiction to the use of β-blockers and diuretics (thiazides/thiazide-like).<sup>27</sup> In view of the potential increased risk of new T2DM, it seems prudent to give preference to antihypertensive therapy initially based on ACE inhibitors or ARBs, with low-dose diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg) as needed (unless there are compelling indications for β-blocker–diuretic therapy).

## Which Drugs Halt the Slide to Diabetes?

Metformin 850mg twice daily when given in the Diabetes Prevention Study<sup>28</sup> reduced future T2DM, albeit less than vigorous lifestyle changes.

Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) increase hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity by activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) receptors. In the ACT NOW trial (Actos Now for Prevention of Diabetes), pioglitazone, as compared to placebo, reduced the risk of conversion of impaired glucose tolerance to T2DM by 72%, but was associated with significant weight gain and edema.  $^{29}$ 

Acarbose inhibits the intestinal absorption of glucose but is often poorly tolerated because of gastrointestinal symptoms. Findings from the Acarbose Cardiovascular Evaluation (ACE) trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase IV ACE trial of 6522 Chinese adults, demonstrated a reduction of T2DM incidence by 18%. However, there was no significant reduction in the incidence of the composite, five-point major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).  $^{30}$ 

Because there have been no comparative studies between metformin, acarbose, and TZDs, it is difficult to say with certainty which would be most effective in preventing progression to new T2DM should lifestyle modifications prove inadequate. However, metformin and pioglitazone have convincing data. In light of this, the 2019 Standards of Medical Care of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommend metformin for high-risk individuals (patients with gestational diabetes mellitus history or BMI  $\geq\!35\,\mathrm{kg/m^2}$ ) due to strong evidence, low cost, and safety profile.  $^{31}$ 

#### **What Can Be Achieved?**

For lifestyle by itself to be effective in preventing transition to T2DM as well as reducing BP, major behavioral changes have to be affected, requiring intense input from professional personnel such as nutritionists and exercise physiologists. Although this intensive counseling may not be a cost-effective approach when applied to the general population, it is undeniable that the ideal strategy for the whole population is a broad behavior modification that avoids obesity. Drug therapy to prevent the transition to T2DM is both feasible and effective in selected patients, yet not widely applied.

# Cardiovascular Disease Risk Assessment

The primary cause of morbidity and mortality of individuals with T2DM is atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).  $^{32}$  While T2DM is clearly associated with risk, not all patients with T2DM are at the same risk.  $^{33}$  A meta-analysis of patients in 13 trials showed that patients without T2DM but with a prior MI had a 43% higher coronary heart disease (CHD) risk than individuals with

T2DM without previous CVD.<sup>34</sup> This risk heterogeneity argues for the routine use of risk assessment in clinical practice.

# Risk Calculators

Both major current DM guidelines, the 2019 guidelines by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and the 2019 ADA/EASD Standards of Medical Care, recommend evaluating the 10-year risk of first atherosclerotic CVD (10-year ASCVD) using the race-and sex-specific pooled cohort equation (PCE). This risk model is used for patients with as well as without DM. The use of DM-specific risk calculators is questionable, as most studies have shown that risk factors modify CVD risk similarly, irrespective of whether or not the patient suffers from DM.35 However, when intermediate risk (7.5%–20%) is present, noninvasive imaging such as a coronary calcium score may be useful in decision making to follow, i.e., intensity of statin and aspirin therapy.

# Risk Enhancing Factors

In addition to using risk calculators, both guidelines also recommend evaluating CVD risk by assessing each patient's diabetesspecific cardiovascular risk factors (Tables 4.2 and 4.3). The ADA Standards of Medical Care recommend the assessment of these risk factors at least annually. In clinical practice, it is best to assess any comorbid cardiometabolic risk factors (including presence of Met-Syn), the duration of DM, and the age of onset.

#### Duration of Diabetes

Duration of DM is independently associated with cardiovascular events. Evidence shows that patients with >10-year history of

T2DM without history of CHD have similar risk of CHD as patients without DM but with prior CHD.<sup>36</sup> By extension, individuals with less than 10 years of T2DM history are not considered CHD risk equivalents. The 2019 ACC/AHA guidelines of preventive CVD state that a T2DM duration of over 10 years is an independent cardiovascular risk enhancer. <sup>37</sup>

## Age of Onset

Age of T2DM diagnosis is an important prognostic factor for cardiovascular risk.

A study using data from the Swedish National Diabetes Registry showed that patients diagnosed with T2DM before the age of 40 had the highest excess relative risk for CVD-related mortality (HR 1.95 [1.68–2.25]), heart failure (HF) (HR 4.77 [3.86–5.89]), and CHD (HR 4.33 [3.82-4.91]) compared to controls. Controls were randomly selected individuals from the general population matched for age, sex, and county. The authors observed that all CVD risks diminished with each additional decade of diagnostic age. Survival of patients with T2DM diagnosed in adolescence was almost a decade less than controls, while patients diagnosed >80 years had the same survival as controls.<sup>38</sup>

Data from a cross-sectional survey of T2DM patients showed that early-onset T2DM (mean diagnostic age 35 years) was associated with a higher risk of nonfatal CVD events compared to late-onset T2DM (mean diagnostic age 55 years) (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.81–2.02).39 While the risk was diminished when adjusted for DM duration, it still remained significant (OR, 1.13; 95% CI 1.06–1.20). This study showed that while duration of T2DM and diagnostic age are associated, age of onset is an independent and significant risk factor for CVD.39,40

The ADA 2019 Standards of Medical Care specifically point out that patients with youth-onset T2DM have a particularly high risk of suffering from DM complications.<sup>31</sup> A cross-sectional study of 2733 patients showed that youth-onset T2DM is associated with microvascular as well as macrovascular risk burden. <sup>41</sup> Further, β-cell function in patients with youth onset T2DM seems to deteriorate faster than that of βT2 cells of patients with adult-onset DM.<sup>42</sup>

# **Coronary Artery Calcium Testing**

The CHD and CVD risk variability of patients with T2DM is perhaps best measured by coronary artery calcium (CAC). The CAC score resulting from a noncontrast cardiac-gated computed tomography scan of the heart—is a marker for atherosclerosis burden, in effect measuring the cumulative effect of a lifetime exposure of measured and unmeasured cardiovascular risk factors. 43 Evidence suggests that CAC can improve risk discrimination of CHD and CVD events more effectively than traditional risk factors. 44 Studies have also shown that the CAC score mirrors the variance in CVD risk of patients with T2DM. For instance, a study by Silverman et al. showed that most individuals with DM < 60 years have an extremely low risk at <5 deaths per 1000 person years when CAC =  $0.^{45}$  In contrast, CAC was detected in almost all patients with DM with prior CHD (92.5%) and CVD (82.5%) events. 46

The Diabetes Heart Study suggested that CAC scoring can reclassify risk of patients with T2DM with a heightened risk for CVD mortality. 47 The study showed that CVD mortality risk increased proportionally to CAC score after adjusting for cardiovascular factors. The area under the curve (AUC) without CAC was 0.70(0.67-0.73) while with CAC was 0.75(0.72-0.78). After addition of the CAC, the model that classified participants into different risk categories reclassified 28% individuals with a net reclassification index (NRI) = 0.13 (0.07-0.19).47

The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) evaluated the use of CAC in long-term prognostication of incident CHD and ASVD among patients with T2DM. The addition of CAC to global risk assessment significantly improved risk stratification in individuals with T2DM. CAC was independently associated with CAC (HR 1.3 [1.19–1.43]), and the net reclassification improvement with CAC addition to traditional risk assessment was 0.23 (95% CI, 0.10–0.37).<sup>48</sup> In light of this evidence, current DM guidelines endorse CAC testing for cardiovascular risk assessment for intermediate-risk (7.5%–20%) patients where risk and treatment decisions are uncertain.31

# Value of Improved Glycemic Control

# Guideline Recommendations on Glycemic Control

The major adverse events of T2DM are microvascular and macrovascular complications. Both are affected by the intensity of glycemic control, typically assessed by levels of glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).

While it is established that effective management of all levels of gylcemia reduces microvascular complications,49–<sup>51</sup> results from the large outcome trials (ACCORD, ADVANCE, VADT—Table 4.4) have not shown that more intensive glycemic control significantly reduces CVD outcomes. In response to this evidence, the 2019 ADA/EASD Standards of Medical Care acknowledge the complexity of adequate glycemic control and strongly endorse the importance of shared decision making to incorporate the individual characteristics and preferences of each patient to find optimal glycemic targets.<sup>31</sup> A general target of <7% HbA1c for nonpregnant adults is still recommended. However, in individuals just diagnosed with T2DM, without CVD, patients with long life expectancy or individuals treated with lifestyle therapy and metformin only, more aggressive glycemic management(<6.5%) is reasonable and can prevent microvascular complications.<sup>31</sup> For patients with short life expectancy who may not profit from the long-term benefits of more aggressive glycemic management, or suffer from serious comorbidities and poor self-management, an HbA1c up to 8% is more suitable.<sup>31</sup> Where tight HbA1c levels cannot be achieved safely, higher HbA1c levels are acceptable.

glycemic targets for each patient, the Standards of Medical Care recommend assessing seven categories to decide on the stringency of the glycemic target; risks of hypoglycemia/drug adverse effects, disease duration, life expectancy, comorbidities, established vascular complications, patient preference, and resources and support system.31

# Microvascular Complications

Multiple randomized controlled studies have repeatedly established that intensive glycemic control can reduce microvascular complications in T2DM.49–<sup>51</sup> The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) reported that a 60% reduction of development of diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy was achieved in the intensive treatment group (mean HbA1c of 7%) than in the standard group (HbA1c of 9%)<sup>52</sup> in early-onset youths and younger adults with T1DM. The landmark trial, UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), which included over 7600 subjects with T2DM and a median follow-up of 10 years, assessed the effects of intensive glycemic control on incidence of complications. One of the major conclusions drawn from the study showed that the microvascular complication rate was reduced by 25% more in the intensive treatment arm (median HbA1c of 7.0%) compared to the control treatment arm (median HbA1c of 7.9%). <sup>49</sup>

# Macrovascular Complications

However, the microvascular benefits of more aggressive glycemic management may be offset by the effects on cardiovascular outcomes. The current discussion of glycemic control on cardiovascular risk is shaped by recent major outcome studies including the ACCORD,<sup>53</sup> ADVANCE,<sup>7</sup> and VADT<sup>54</sup> (Table 4.4).

ACCORD. In patients with T2DM at high cardiovascular risk, perhaps similar to those that a cardiologist might see, the NIDsupported Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study compared intense versus standard glycemic control. Mean HbA1c levels were 6.4% in the intense and 7.5% in the standard arms. ACCORD ended the glycemic control study early after results showing an increased mortality in individuals belonging to the very intense glycemic control arm, with an HbA1c target of <6%, compared to the standard arm (1.41 versus 1.14% per year; 257 versus 203 deaths over a mean 3.5 years of follow-up; hazard ratio [HR] 1.22 [95% CI 1.01–1.46]). As a result, the ACCORD study researchers wrote, "Such a strategy cannot be recommended for high-risk patients with advanced T2D." <sup>53</sup> As a result of the ACCORD study, the subsequently published ADA Standards of Care in Diabetes 2013 guidelines only recommended intensive glycemic control in low 10-year ASCVD risk patients.  $^{55}$ 

ADVANCE. The ADVANCE trial (Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation) was launched with a similar motivation to ACCORD: to evaluate more aggressive glycemic management on the risk of CVD in patients with T2DM. The primary outcome of ADVANCE combined macrovascular (MI, stroke, and cardiovascular death) and microvascular (nephropathy and retinopathy) events.<sup>56</sup> While intensive glycemic control resulted in a significant reduction of this combined primary endpoint (18.1% intensive versus 20.0% conventional therapy—HR 0.90; 95% CI 0.82–0.98; P = 0.01), this decrease was mainly driven by the reduction of microvascular events (mainly albuminuria). There was no significant reduction in major macrovascular events (10.0% intensive versus 10.6% conventional therapy; HR 0.94; 95% CI 0.84-1.06; P = 0.32). Unlike ACCORD, ADVANCE did not observe an elevated risk in mortality for patients with intensive glucose control.57

**VADT.** The Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial (VADT), a prospectiverandomized trial in patients with advanced T2DM, also failed to demonstrate a significant benefit in terms of overall or cardiovascular mortality, herein from lowering HbA1c to 6.9% in the intensivetherapy group versus 8.4% in the standard-therapy group. 54 The VADT trial's population included predominantly (98%) older men with poorly controlled T2DM (median entry HbA1c 9.4%). CVD risk factors such as BP, smoking cessation, aspirin therapy, and statin therapy were treated intensively. While the tight glycemic control group reduced HbA1C levels to 6.9% within the first year of the study, the primary outcome, time to first cardiovascular event, was not significantly reduced in the intensive group (HR 0.88 [95%] CI 0.74–1.05], P = 0.12). The study also reported more CVD deaths in the intensive glycemic control group than in the standard control group (38 versus 29); however, this difference was not statistically significant. More recent analysis has demonstrated that VADT participants randomly assigned to intensive glycemic control over 5.6 vears had fewer CVD events only during the prolonged period in which the glycated hemoglobin curves were separated.<sup>51</sup>

**Summary.** Results from these outcome studies suggest that patients with a long history of T2DM, history of hypoglycemia, advanced atherosclerosis, and old age are less likely to benefit from tight glycemic control. <sup>59,60</sup> In all three trials, significantly more hypoglycemic episodes occurred in tight glycemic control groups than in

others. In response to ACCORD, VADT, and ADVANCE, the 2019 ADA/EASD Standards of Medical Care state that physicians should be cautious of intensive glucose control for patients with long history of T2DM and cardiovascular risk factors. <sup>31</sup> The risks associated with intensive glycemic control might outweigh its benefits.

# Importance of Large Cardiovascular Disease Outcome Trials

Until 2008, antidiabetic drugs were exclusively approved on the basis of lowering of HbA1c, as trials with intensive glycemic control demonstrated lower rates of microvascular complications. Most participants in trials evaluating effects of certain glycemic targets had no established ASCVD or very low cardiovascular risk and were generally drug naïve. This study design limited the ability to adequately assess cardiovascular effects of these drugs. Over time, a range of evidence demonstrated that some diabetic drugs might pose risks to cardiovascular safety (Table 4.5). <sup>61</sup>

Perhaps the most famous trial that initiated the debate on cardiovascular safety of antidiabetic drugs was the study showing that rosiglitazone was associated with an elevated risk of MI and risk of death from cardiovascular causes. <sup>62</sup> Ironically, later studies did not confirm the adverse cardiovascular effects of rosiglitazone, <sup>63</sup> and the FDA since lifted safety regulations against this agent. <sup>64</sup>

In response to the overall rosiglitazone trial data<sup>62</sup> and other trials questioning cardiovascular safety of antidiabetic agents, in 2008 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published guidance for industry recommending the inclusion of enough patients with high CVD risk in order for trials to adequately assess the cardiovascular risks of diabetic drugs.<sup>65</sup> In order for novel drugs to demonstrate sufficient cardiovascular safety and win FDA approval, the agency mandated that a premarketing outcomes trial show that the upper bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval of the estimated hazard ratio is less than 1.8 for composite threepoint MACE (cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, and nonfatal stroke) or four-point MACE (cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, and hospitalization for unstable angina).65 For approved drugs, the FDA also required a postmarketing safety trial that must demonstrate that the estimated risk ratio of the upper bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval is less than 1.3 for the composite MACE outcome. <sup>65</sup> To achieve this, most enrolled patients must have established CVD or high ASCVD risk.

#### DPP-4, Dipeptidyl peptidase 4;

Modified from Cecilia C, Low Wang M, Brendan M, et al. Cardiovascular safety trials for all new diabetes mellitus drugs? Ten years of FDA guidance requirements to evaluate cardiovascular risk. Circulation 2019;139:1741–1743.

Drug manufacturers quickly adapted to this new regulatory climate. While most trials were designed to only demonstrate the anti-diabetic agent's noninferiority to placebo, some drugs were powered to show superiority compared to standard treatment. <sup>66</sup>

As a result, a multitude of large CVOTs for antidiabetic agents were published after 2008 (Table 4.6). Categorically, the drugs tested demonstrated cardiovascular safety (noninferior cardiovascular outcomes compared to placebo). These post-2008 FDA mandated CVOTs led to a paradigm shift in T2DM treatment; therapies now are not primarily aimed at HbA1c reduction but are focused on other aspects of T2DM comorbidities as well, such as the effects on cardiovascular health. In addition, the information of these CVOTs led to great insights, such as the demanding issue of HF in older patients with T2DM<sup>67</sup> and the effects of these agents on kidney function. <sup>66</sup> In response to the outcome of these trials, the FDA for the first time approved label changes to drugs used to treat patients with diabetes for lower risk of MACE (liraglutide, <sup>68</sup> canagliflozin <sup>69</sup>) and cardiovascular death (empagliflozin <sup>70</sup>). <sup>71</sup>

After a decade under the 2008 guidance, in October 2018, the FDA Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee discussed whether to provide updated guidance. Perhaps the most important critique about the past CVOTs is the lack of generality of the trial's results. <sup>66</sup> Most participants had high baseline CVD risk, and this limits how much the results can be extrapolated onto the entire population. <sup>66</sup> Further, some point out that focusing new T2DM drugs on atherosclerotic cardiovascular safety is too limited. <sup>71</sup> For instance, members of the committee emphasized the importance of drug development for outcomes such as HF, peripheral artery disease, and fatty liver disease, and these comorbidities are all important to individuals with T2DM. <sup>61</sup> In addition, the high cost and rigor of these large outcome trials might deter the development of novel drugs by pharmaceutical companies. <sup>71</sup>

The committee voted 10 to 9 to continue the 2008 guidance; the close decision demonstrates the complexity of the subject. While the new guidelines have not been finalized, a possible outcome of the committee's discussion is that trials assessing new drugs should be more strict than before the implementation of the FDA 2008 guidance for industry, but more lenient than 2008 recommendations. For instance, there were discussions on modifying the approval procedure to a one-step process and altering the preapproval hazard ratios from 1.8 to <1.5, while removing the 1.3 postapproval limit. If implemented by the FDA, this simplified approach to diabetes related CVOT trial design would allow more resources to be directed to development of drugs that show efficacy against outcomes like peripheral artery disease, HF, glycemic variability, quality of life, or kidney disease.

# Drugs That Lower Cardiovascular Disease Risk

# Metformin

## Drug Class Overview

Singly or in combination, metformin is the standard of care to promote glycemic control and is the first-choice agent in international T2DM guidelines.31,73 Importantly, it also suppresses appetite, is associated with modest (2%–3%) weight reduction, appears to be devoid of cardiovascular harm, and may benefit when given to patients with T2DM and HF.<sup>74</sup> In the prolonged UKPDS study, metformin was the only drug to reduce T2DM-related and all-cause mortality, although the number of events was low.<sup>75</sup> Since then, it has been the first-line treatment in overweight patients with T2DM.

#### Mechanisms of Action

Most of the metabolic effect of metformin occurs in the liver wherein it reduces glucose production.<sup>76</sup> Although the in vivo effects in patients with T2DM or at risk for T2DM remain unproven, in skeletal muscle, metformin phosphorylates, and activates 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which facilitates many of the observed cellular effects of metformin, such as inhibition of glucose and lipid synthesis. AMPK activation also leads to the glucose transporter-4 mediated glucose uptake (Fig. 4.4). Overall, metformin leads to a higher systemic insulin sensitivity.<sup>77</sup> Another putative mechanism of metformin relates to the impact on the intestinal microbiome.<sup>78</sup>

## Differences Among Drugs in Class

Metformin can be administered twice daily in the short-release form or once daily in the long-release form.31 Both forms are equally effective. However, the long release is associated with fewer gastrointestinal effects than the short-release form.<sup>79</sup>

# Data for Use

Overall, the initial treatment with metformin shows many benefits on clinical outcomes, such as less hypoglycemia and weight gain compared to insulin or sulfonylureas.<sup>50</sup>

Glycemic control. Metformin is the first-choice agent for T2DM primarily because of its glycemic efficacy in the absence of side effects seen with other glucose-lowering agents. The United States Multicenter Metformin Study group showed that after 29 weeks,

#### CELLULAR GLUCOSE METABOLISM

![](_page_20_Picture_3.jpeg)

Fig. 4.4 Cellular glucose metabolism. Excess free fatty acid (FFA) entering the muscle cell is activated to long-chain acyl coenzyme A, which inhibits the insulin signaling pathway so that there is less translocation of glucose transporter vesicles (GLUT-4 and GLUT-1 glucose) to the cell surface. Glucose uptake is decreased, and hyperglycemia is promoted. The increased uptake of FFA promotes lipid metabolites accumulation in various organs, including the heart and pancreas. Metformin and exercise, by stimulating adenosine monophosphate protein kinase (AMPK), promote the translocation of transport vesicles to the cell surface to promote glucose entry and to oppose insulin resistance. Protein kinase B, also called Akt, plays a key role. AMPK, 5' AMP-activated protein kinase; G, glucose; IRS-P, insulin receptor substrate-phosphatidyl. (Modified from Opie LH.

patients randomly assigned to metformin had a mean HbA1c concentration of 7.1% compared to 8.6% in the placebo group.<sup>80</sup>

Weight loss. An additional advantage over other antidiabetics is the weight loss associated with metformin. In the Diabetes Prevention Program, study participants reduced their body weight by  $2.06 \pm$ 5.65% when taking metformin, compared to the  $0.02 \pm 5.52\%$  weight loss of the placebo group (P < 0.001). In a meta-analysis, when combined with insulin, metformin reduced HbA1c by 0.5% and weight gain by 1 kg, whereas the insulin dose fell by 5 U/day.<sup>82</sup>

Cardiovascular outcomes. Trials on cardiovascular outcomes of metformin preceded the FDA guidance, and as a result there are no definitive CVOTs similar to those with SGLT-2 (sodium-glucose cotransporter-2) inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and DPP-4 (dipeptidyl peptidase 4) inhibitors. Evidence on cardiovascular effect of metformin relies on a number of smaller studies that, even though controversial, overall point toward cardiovascular benefits. Evidence from a meta-analysis of 179 trials and 25 observational studies concluded that cardiovascular mortality was lower for metformin compared to sulfonylureas. For example, compared to sulfonylureas, metformin was associated with a lower all-cause mortality (HR 0.5–0.8), lower CVD mortality (HR 0.6–0.9), and lower CVD morbidity (HR 0.3–0.9), In a Danish retrospective national cohort study, Andersson et al. demonstrated that patients with T2DM with HF treated with metformin had a lower risk of mortality compared with sulfonylureas and/or insulin. In the sulfonylureas and/or insulin.

REMOVAL (Reducing with Metformin Vascular Adverse Lesions), the largest and longest double-blinded randomized control study assessing metformin, observed the progression of atherosclerosis in patients with T1DM. Atherosclerosis progression was measured by average maximal carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT). In the group treated with metformin, CIMT was significantly reduced ( $-0.013\,\mathrm{mm/year}$ , -0.024 to -0.003;  $P\!=\!0.0093$ ), suggesting cardiovascular benefits. There is also evidence that metformin may protect against coronary atherosclerosis in prediabetes and early T2DM in men. This hypothesis is currently being examined in the study VA-IMPACT (Investigation of Metformin in Pre-Diabetes on Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Outcomes), testing if metformin reduces mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in patients with prediabetes and established ASCVD compared to placebo.

**Cancer incidence.** In addition, observational studies have observed that metformin may lower cancer incidence.

#### Side Effects

The major side effects of metformin are gastrointestinal intolerances such as bloating or diarrhea. A very rare observed occurrence is lactic acidosis at very high circulating metformin levels if patients suffer from overdose, or acute renal failure. Consequently, metformin should be avoided in patients with a predisposition to lactic acidosis. Such factors include an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)  $<\!30\,\mathrm{mL/min/1.73\,m^2}$  or severe illness with vomiting and dehydration.  $^{87.73}$  Additionally, metformin is potentially

associated with Vitamin B12 deficiency.<sup>88</sup> The 2019 ADA Standards of Medical Care state that Vitamin B levels should be routinely measured in patients treated with metformin, especially in patients with anemia or peripheral neuropathy (Level B recommendation).<sup>31</sup>

# Drug Interactions or Major Restriction

Metformin demonstrates synergistic effects when coadministered with SGLT-2 inhibitors. In comparison to the application of metformin alone, the combination of metformin and SGLT-2 inhibitors improved arterial stiffness in T1DM patients.<sup>89</sup> Endothelial dysfunction is improved through the combination of metformin and saxagliptin in T2DM.90

Metformin and kidney disease. Metformin is renally excreted. Bearing in mind that moderate to severe renal disease with eGFR <60mL/min occurs in 20%–30% of patients with T2DM, metformin dose reduction should be considered at an eGFR <45mL/min and at an eGFR <30mL/min, metformin should not be used.31,73 If eGFR is 30–60mL/min, the 2019 ADA Standards of Medical Care additionally advise to pause metformin treatment before iodinated contrast imaging procedures.<sup>31</sup>

# SGLT-2 Inhibitors

## Drug Class Overview

The 2019 ADA Standards of Medical Care state that if the HbA1c target is not achieved after 3 months of metformin and lifestyle intervention alone, metformin can be combined with additional drugs. For patients with ASCVD, HF, or CKD, the guidelines recommend the addition of SGLT-2 inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists.<sup>31</sup>

# Mechanisms of Action

SGLT-2 inhibitors work by decreasing glucose levels through urinary excretion (Fig. 4.5). Their glucosuric effect, coupled with a diuretic-mediated antihypertensive effect and hemoconcentration, may explain their cardiovascular benefits.<sup>91</sup> The inhibition of SGLT-2 receptors in the kidneys result in increased urinary excretion of glucose, which reduces postprandial glycemic excursions and leads to more effective glycaemic control and weight loss. The weight loss associated with SGLT-2 inhibitors, which was confirmed in a meta-analysis that compared SGLT-2 inhibitors with placebo showing that SGLT-2 inhibitors, were associated with a mean of 2.99 kg reduction in weight over 2 years (95% CI 3.64 to 2.3492), may also contribute CVD risk reductions. These effects

improve insulin sensitivity. The negative energy balance associated with glycosuria leads to ketone body metabolization by cardiac myocytes, which are a more efficient energy fuel.  $^{93}$  The osmotic diuresis contributes to the BP reduction associated with SGLT-2 inhibitors. For example, the CANTATA-M (Canagliflozin Treatment and Trial Analysis – Monotherapy) trial showed that SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values were reduced with 300 mg canagliflozin by  $-5.4\,\mathrm{mmHg}$  and  $-2\,\mathrm{mmHg}$ , respectively.  $^{94}$ 

## **Differences Among Drugs in Class**

While canagliflozin and empagliflozin have demonstrated cardiovascular and renal benefits, canagliflozin was associated with a higher risk of lower limb amputations and fractures. <sup>69</sup> The ADA 2019 Standards of Medical Care state that for patients with established ASCVD, evidence for empagliflozin is the strongest. <sup>73</sup> Dapagliflozin showed significant benefits for individuals with HF. <sup>95</sup>

#### Data for Use

Multiple large FDA mandated CVOTs have since reported on the cardiovascular effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors (Table 4.6). The two FDA-approved SGLT-2 inhibitors, empagliflozin and canagliflozin, showed significant reductions in cardiovascular events.

**EMPA-REG.** EMPA-REG, a randomized double-blinded trial, evaluated the effect of empagliflozin on a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke. The Even though designed for noninferiority, the study concluded that empagliflozin was superior to placebo. Empagliflozin reduced risk of the primary outcome, with a relative risk reduction of 14% (10.5% empagliflozin vs 12.1% placebo - HR 0.86 [95% CI 0.74–0.99. P=0.04). In individuals using empagliflozin, cardiovascular death was reduced by 38% (absolute rate 3.7% versus 5.9%, HR 0.62 [95% CI 0.49–0.77], P<0.001). Due to the significant decrease in cardiovascular death associated with empagliflozin, the FDA approved empagliflozin in 2016 "to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adult patients with T2DM and cardiovascular disease," even though cardiovascular death reduction was only a secondary outcome.

In addition, empagliflozin reduced risk of HF both in patients with and without HF at baseline. The ACC/AHA 2019 Standards of Care recognized empagliflozin's potential for primary prevention of HF.<sup>38</sup> Within the first few months, reduction in cardiovascular mortality was observed in EMPA-REG.<sup>70</sup> This posits that the increased diuresis and improved hemodynamics associated with empagliflozin may result in the cardiovascular benefits, which are independent of glycemic control.<sup>96</sup> The hypothesis that glycemic control

is not the only cause of empagliflozin's beneficial cardiovascular effect is further established by the observation that patients with HF benefited from empagliflozin, within a large range of HbA1c values. <sup>96</sup> In order to assess if SGLT-2 inhibitors prevent HF independent of glycemic control, the effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors on HF will be measured in EMPEROR HF for empagliflozin (ClinicalTrials.gov trial number NCT03057977) and DAPA HF for dapagliflozin (ClinicalTrials.gov trial number: NCT03036124) in patients without T2DM.

**CANVAS.** The CANVAS trial evaluated the cardiovascular effects of canagliflozin. Here, canagliflozin reduced the rate of three-point MACE from 31.5 to 26.9 participants per 1000 patient-years (HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.75 to 0.97; P < 0.001 for noninferiority; P = 0.02 for superiority). However, there were no significant findings for cardiovascular death or death by any cause. Of note, the rate of lower limb amputations almost doubled in the canagliflozin group compared to the control group 6.3 versus 3.4 per 1000 patient years (HR 1.97 [1.41–2.75]).

**CREDENCE.** The CREDENCE trial also studied canagliflozin, but the authors evaluated the renal effects of this drug. The primary outcome was a composite of end-stage kidney disease, doubling of serum creatinine and death from renal/cardiovascular disease. Compared to the placebo group, the rates of the primary outcome were lower in the canagliflozin group (43.2 and 61.2 per 1000 patient-years HR: 0.70; 95% CI 0.59–0.82; P = 0.00001). CREDENCE also showed that canagliflozin positively impact patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). 97 According the most current guidelines, SGLT-2 inhibitors are not recommended for patients with GFR < 45 mL/min but results from CREDENCE suggest that for precisely these patients, SGLT-2 inhibitors are most beneficial. Even though the CREDENCE population consisted of a population which had slightly higher risk profiles than CANVAS, there was no increase in amputation or fracture as observed as adverse events in the CAN-VAS participants.

**DECLARE-TIMI-58.** The impact of dapagliflozin on cardiovascular outcomes was studied in the DECLARE-TIMI-58 trial. <sup>96</sup> This was the first CVOT SGLT-2 inhibitor trial to enroll a majority (59%) primary prevention patients. Only 41% had established ASCVD. While dapagliflozin achieved noninferiority, it was not superior to placebo in the primary outcome, three-point MACE (HR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.84–1.03, P=0.17). However, dapagliflozin did result in lower rates of hospitalization of HF (4.9% versus. 5.8%; HR 0.83; 95% CI 0.73–0.95; P=0.005).

**Summary.** The conclusion from a meta-analysis studying all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality was that SGLT-2 inhibitors are the most beneficial to cardiovascular outcomes compared to the other drug classes that underwent the FDA-mandated trials (GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors). SGLT-2 inhibitors were also associated with lower rates of HF and MI outcome, compared to GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors.

#### Side Effects

The FDA-mandated outcome studies showed that SGLT-2 inhibitors were associated with an increased risk of genital infections due to the glucosuria. In a recent report, the FDA identified 55 cases of Fournier Gangrene receiving SGLT-2 inhibitors. 98 Other adverse events, such as an increase in LDL-C  $(1.09 \pm 2.3 \,\text{mg/dL})$  and an increase in total cholesterol (2.14±3.7 mg/dL), have also been noted. 99 Ten cases of bladder cancer have been noted among patients prescribed dapagliflozin. As the result, the FDA initiated postmarketing surveillance studies for this rare outcome. SGLT-2 inhibitors may cause symptomatic hypotension in older adults when taken simultaneously with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or diuretics. Postmarketing reports also observed cases of acute kidney injury in patients taking canagliflozin and dapagliflozin.<sup>101</sup> SGLT-2 inhibitors should not be prescribed when eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Although some studies reported a higher incidence in bone fractures, this could not be confirmed in a meta-analysis of dapagliflozin or empagliflozin. <sup>102</sup> In the CVOTs, the fracture risk was only increased in the CANVAS trial but not in the other SGLT-2 inhibitor trials. 103 Cases of euglycemic ketoacidosis have also been reported with patients taking SGLT-2 inhibitors, and patients with T2DM treated with insulin may be at higher risk. In the post-2008 CVOTs, only canagliflozin showed an elevated risk of lower limb amputation. <sup>69</sup> As a result, the FDA issued a warning that canagliflozin should not be issued to patients at risk of foot amputations. Patients prescribed canagliflozin should be observed for any signs of foot ulceration. 104

## **Drug Interactions or Major Restrictions**

Overall, SGLT-2 inhibitors show little drug interactions with other drugs used to treat patients with diabetes or other usual concomitant drugs. Only canagliflozin should be given in a higher dose when patients simultaneously are taking UDP-glucuronosyltransferase inducer like rifampicin, phenytoin, or ritonavir. <sup>105</sup>

## **Experimental Drugs**

Sotagliflozin is a dual SGLT-1 receptor (expressed in the gastrointestinal tract) and SGLT-2 (expressed in the kidneys) inhibitor.  $^{107}$ 

Thus, the agent reduces absorption of glucose in the kidneys as well as in the gastrointestinal tract.<sup>106</sup> Sotagliflozin currently completed phase III trial testing for T1DM patients, while phase III trial testing for T2DM patients is ongoing.<sup>106</sup> In April 2019, the European Union approved the use of sotagliflozin in addition to insulin in T1DM patients with a BMI >27 when insulin therapy is insufficient.<sup>107</sup> In the US, during the January 2019 FDA Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drug Advisory Committee meeting, the committee raised concerns regarding incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis with sotagliflozin. As a result, the FDA deferred approval and issued a complete response letter for sotagliflozin.<sup>108</sup>

# GLP-1 Receptor Agonists

#### Drug Class Overview

GLP-1 receptor agonists stimulate insulin secretion and suppress glucagon release while also reducing appetite and promoting weight loss. For patients with ASCVD, HF, or CKD, the ADA/EASD Standard of Care recommend the addition of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists if HbA1c targets are not achieved through metformin or lifestyle intervention alone.31

## Mechanism of Action

GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors are drugs developed on the basis of the incretin system. Incretins are gastrointestinal peptide hormones released during absorption of nutrients to augment insulin secretion. GLP-1 is a hormone secreted into the circulation by the intestinal L-cells in response to ingested food (Fig. 4.6).109 The incretin response system is disturbed in T2DM. The incretin axis also includes the enzyme DPP-4, a serine protease that rapidly degrades GLP-1 and other proteins. Ultimately, this "arc of discovery" has led to new approved diabetes therapies: GLP-1 analogs (exenatide, liraglutide) and DPP-4 inhibitors (saxagliptin, sitagliptin, and others).<sup>109</sup> Incretin mimetics are GLP-1 receptor agonists. GLP-1 regulates glucose levels by stimulating glucosedependent insulin secretion and biosynthesis, and by suppressing glucagon secretion, delayed gastric emptying, and promoting satiety (Fig. 4.6). They regulate glucose metabolism through multiple mechanisms and have beneficial cardiovascular effects, possibly independent of the glucose-lowering activity, which include changes in BP, endothelial function, body weight, cardiac metabolism, lipid metabolism, left ventricular function, atherosclerosis, and the response to ischemia-reperfusion injury.<sup>102</sup>

## Differences Among Drugs in Class

GLP-1 receptor agonists are divided into short-and long-acting drugs. Exenatide and lixisenatide are shorter acting and have a more marked effect on postprandial glucose and gastric emptying but less on fasting glucose.110 Lixisenatide is administered once daily, while exenatide is given twice daily. After the initial short-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists were produced, longer-acting versions were developed. Dulaglutide, exenatide extended release (ER), liraglutide, and semaglutide are all long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists. In contrast to short acting, long-acting agents have a greater effect on fasting glucose and less on gastric emptying.<sup>111</sup> A review of 17 trials assessing the effects of multiple GLP-1 receptor agonists showed that compared to active comparators, liraglutide and exenatide led to greater weight loss.<sup>112</sup> Unlike other GLP-1 receptor agonists, semaglutide may be associated with retinopathy through its potent glucose-lowering effects. <sup>113</sup>

#### Data for Use

**Glycemic control.** GLP-1 receptor agonists improve glycemic control. A meta-analysis of 17 trials showed that GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce HbA1c by approximately 1% compared to placebo. In patients who require greater glycemic efficacy of injectable therapies, GLP-1 may be a reasonable option versus insulin because the glycemic efficacy is similar with a lower risk of hypoglycemia and more weight loss. In comparison to other glucose-lowering agents, GLP-1 receptor agonists have a higher glycemic efficacy compared to TZDs and sulfonylureas.

**Weight loss.** Weight loss is a beneficial therapeutic effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists. A systematic review of 17 randomized trials showed that individuals had a weight reduction of approximately 1.5–2.5 kg over 30 weeks on a GLP-1 receptor agonist compared to a placebo or active comparator (insulin glargine, DPP-4 inhibitor, TZD, sulfonylurea). 112

**Cardiovascular outcomes.** The cardiovascular safety of GLP-1 receptor agonists was reviewed in a total of eight large CVOTs (Table 4.6).

**ELIXA.** ELIXA assessed the effect of lixisenatide on cardiovascular outcomes in T2DM patients with recent acute coronary events. <sup>116</sup> Notably, lixisenatide was the only short-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist drug tested in the immediate post 2008 FDA mandated trials. However, while noninferior, lixisenatide did not prove to be superior to the placebo regarding the primary composite outcome of the study. The composite of MI, stroke, cardiovascular death, or hospitalization for unstable angina occurred in 13.4% of the lixisenatide group compared to 13.2% of the placebo group (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.17; P < 0.001 for inferiority; P = 0.81 for superiority).

**LEADER.** LEADER, evaluating the effects of liraglutide, showed a dramatic reduction of cardiovascular mortality. In participants taking liraglutide, MI, stroke, and cardiovascular death occurred in 13% compared to 14.9% in the placebo group (HR 0.87; 95% CI 0.78–0.97; P=0.01). This reduction in primary composite outcome was mainly due to the significant reduction of cardiovascular death (4.7% liraglutide versus 6.0% placebo, HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.66–0.93). While liraglutide was already approved for the reduction of blood glucose in patients with T2DM, in response to the LEADER study, the FDA additionally approved liraglutide "to reduce the risk of MACE in adults with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease" in 2017.

**SUSTAIN-6.** SUSTAIN-6 examined the weekly GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide for cardiovascular safety. <sup>113</sup> Despite a fewer number of events in a smaller sample, results were similar to LEADER; semaglutide was noninferior to cardiovascular safety compared to placebo. 6.6% of the semaglutide group suffered from the primary outcome (first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI or nonfatal stroke), compared to 8.9% in the placebo group (HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.58–0.95; P < 0.001 for noninferiority).

**EXSCEL.** Exenatide ER, observed in the EXSCEL study, demonstrated a borderline statistical benefit in the primary outcome but did not significantly lower cardiovascular events compared to the placebo. The primary outcome (cardiovascular death, MI or stroke) occurred in 11.4% of the Exenatide group compared to the 12.2% of the placebo group (HR 0.91; 95% CI 0.83–1.00; P = 0.06 for superiority; P < 0.001 for noninferiority).

**HARMONY OUTCOMES.** HARMONY OUTCOMES showed that albiglutide significantly reduced major cardiovascular events when added to standard care of T2DM patients. <sup>117</sup> The incidence rate of three-point MACE was 7% in the albiglutide group compared to 9% in the placebo group (HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.68–0.90; P < 0.0001 noninferiority; P = 0.0006 for superiority). However, 2017 sales of albiglutide were discontinued due to limited prescriptions of the drug.

**REWIND.** The REWIND study was the CVOT trial with the longest follow-up time of 5.5 years. <sup>118</sup> Noteworthy is also REWIND's inclusion of a high proportion of women (47%), lower baseline HbA1c (7.2%), and higher proportion of primary prevention patients (70%). REWIND showed that dulaglutide is superior to placebo regarding cardiovascular events. Twelve percent of participants of the dulaglutide group suffered three-point MACE events compared to 13.4% in the placebo group (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.79–0.99; P=0.026). Further, REWIND suggests that dulaglutide may be beneficial for primary prevention.

In summary, the results of the CVOTs for GLP-1 receptor agonists showed somewhat heterogenous results. Only four of the trials (LEADER, SUSTAIN-6, REWIND, HARMONY OUTCOMES) significantly reduced the risk of the primary outcome, major cardiovascular events. In addition, only REWIND suggested that GLP-1 receptor agonists may be applicable to primary prevention. ELIXA, HARMONY, LEADER, SUSTAIN-6, and EXSCEL included a majority of patients with a history of CVD, suggesting that these drugs primarily reduce cardiovascular events in individuals with established ASCVD. After reflection on the CVOT trials for GLP-1 receptor agonists, the 2019 ADA/EASD Standards of Care state that liraglutide has strongest evidence for cardiovascular benefit. The 2018 ADA/EASD Standards of Care also noted that evidence is also favorable for semaglutide.

#### Side Effects

The most common side effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists are gastrointestinal. A meta-analysis showed that diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea occur in 10%–50% of patients.<sup>112</sup> Events of acute pancreatitis have also been associated with GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment. However, the incidence is extremely low; a meta-analysis of individuals enrolled in trials reported only 16 cases of acute pancreatitis.<sup>119</sup> Injection site reactions may also occur. A study concluded that local site reactions were more common (10%) in albiglutide and exenatide compared to insulin (1%–5%).120,121 GLP-1 receptor agonists are also associated with risk of gallbladder events, an adverse effect that may relate to the weight reduction.<sup>122</sup> Patients administered semaglutide in the SUSTAIN-6 trial showed complications of diabetic retinopathy more frequently than the placebo group (HR 1.76; 95% CI 1.11–2.78).<sup>113</sup> However, currently it is unclear if this is a direct effect of the drug or only consequence of the glycemic control through semaglutide. The FDA advises that exenatide should not be used with severe renal impairment, after receiving reports from 78 individuals with acute renal failure or renal insufficiency.<sup>123</sup> Rodent studies also showed that liraglutide and dulaglutide were associated with benign and malignant thyroid C tell tumors.<sup>124</sup> Further, GLP-1 receptor agonists may modestly increase risk of hypoglycemia when added to insulin and sulfonylureas.<sup>125</sup>

## Experimental Drugs

Tirzepatide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist developed for T2DM patients with increased cardiovascular risk, is currently undergoing phase III testing. The phase II trial showed that tirzepatide was associated with greater weight loss and HbA1c reduction compared to Trulicity (standard GLP-1 agonist).<sup>126</sup> SURPASS-4, a phase III trial initiated in 2018, demonstrated the safety and efficacy of tirzepatide in participants with elevated cardiovascular risk.<sup>127</sup>

# Drugs That Do Not Lower Cardiovascular Disease Risk

# DPP-4 Inhibitors

## Drug Class Overview

DPP-4 inhibitors are chemically derived, selective, competitive inhibitors of DPP-4 and can be administered orally.

#### **Mechanisms of Action**

DPP-4 inhibitors counteract the degradation of plasma GLP-1 and GIP after eating (Fig. 4.6). Like GLP-1 agonists, these agents have antidiabetic activity by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas and by inhibiting that of glucagon. However, DPP-4 inhibitors only elevate GLP-1 by a modest amount, compared to when administering GLP-1 receptor agonists directly. This could account for the greater beneficial effects on weight, fasting glucose levels, and reduction of HbA1c of GLP-1 compared to DPP-4 inhibitors. <sup>96,128</sup>

## **Differences Among Drugs in Class**

All DPP-4 inhibitors are excreted renally and need to be adjusted according to renal function. Linagliptin is an exception, as it is excreted via the enterohepatic system. Thus, linagliptin dosage does not need to be adjusted for patients with CKD.<sup>73</sup>

#### Data for Use

**Glycemic control.** All DPP-4 inhibitors moderately lower HbA1c to a similar extent. <sup>129</sup> As a second-line treatment, DPP-4 inhibitors are inferior to GLP-1 receptor agonists, but had no advantage over sulfonylureas in a meta-analysis. <sup>130</sup> DPP-4 inhibitors and pioglitazone were associated with the same change in HbA1c from baseline, but pioglitazone was associated with a higher chance of reaching <7% (goal HbaA1c value of the study). <sup>130</sup>

Cardiovascular effect. In CVOTs examining the cardiovascular outcomes of DPP-4 inhibitors (Table 4.6), no agents were associated with cardiovascular benefit. However, saxagliptin 131 and alogliptin 132 demonstrated an elevated risk for hospitalization from HF, with saxagliptin showing the greater risk. As a consequence of these results, the American Heart Association and Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) concluded that for patients with HF or at high risk of HF, the use of DPP-4 inhibitors is not justified. 133 In 2017, the FDA issued package insert warnings regarding the increased risk of HF for saxagliptin and alogliptin.

**EXAMINE.** The EXAMINE trial evaluated the cardiovascular safety of alogliptin on T2DM with recent acute coronary syndrome. Alogliptin was noninferior to placebo in regard to the primary endpoint, three-point MACE (HR 0.98; 95% CI 0.86–1.12). However, a post hoc analysis showed that alogliptin increased the risk of hospitalization from HF contrast to placebo (HR 1.07; 95% CI 0.79–1.46). 132

**TECOS.** The authors of the trial TECOS concluded that sitagliptin did not increase the risk of cardiovascular events compared to placebo (HR 0.98; 95% CI 0.88–1.09). <sup>135</sup>

**SAVOR TIMI-53.** Saxagliptin did not increase or decrease the rate of ischemic events in the SAVOR-TIMI-53 trial (HR 1.00; 95% CI 0.89–1.12; P=0.99 for superiority and P<0.001 for noninferiority). <sup>131</sup> However, the authors noted an increase in the rates of hospitalization for HF (3.5% saxagliptin versus 2.8% placebo) in the saxagliptin group compared to the control arm.

**CARMELINA.** The CARMELINA study examined the cardiovascular safety of linagliptin. Linagliptin was noninferior with regard to risk of major cardiovascular events. <sup>136</sup> Notably, the CAR-MELINA study included a patient population who were at high vascular risk. This is significant, as it provides important information on the use of linagliptin with high-risk patients.

#### Side Effects

As a group, DPP-4 inhibitors are well tolerated, and rates of weight gain, gastrointestinal adverse effects, and hypoglycemia are minimal. <sup>137</sup> In contrast to GLP-1 receptor agonists, they are weight neutral rather than promoting weight loss. <sup>130</sup> Importantly, in monotherapy, the incidence of hypoglycemia in DPP-4 inhibitor–treated patients in clinical trials was similar to placebo. <sup>139</sup> Moreover, in older patients on stable insulin doses, linagliptin improved glycemic management without an excess of hypoglycemia. <sup>139</sup> While nasopharyngitis was more prevalent with the DPP-4 inhibitors than with placebo, rates of pancreatitis were lower than with other oral antihyperglycemic agents. <sup>99</sup> Incidences of musculoskeletal side effects have also been noted. <sup>140</sup>

# **Drug Interactions or Major Restrictions**

The addition of DPP-4 inhibitors to sulfonylureas increases the risk of hypoglycemia by 50% compared to monotherapy. <sup>141</sup>

# **Thiazolidinedione**

## Drug Class Overview

Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone belong to the class of TZDs, also called *glitazones*. TZDs are oral agents that improve insulin sensitivity and lower glucose levels very effectively. While they are inexpensive, show atherosclerotic benefits, and have a high glucose efficacy, these benefits have to be balanced with safety concerns like weight gain, <sup>142</sup> fracture risk, <sup>143</sup> HF, <sup>144,145</sup> and possible increased risk for bladder cancer. <sup>146</sup>

#### **Mechanisms of Action**

TZDs activate the PPAR- $\gamma$  (gamma) transcriptional system, thereby promoting the metabolism of glucose (Fig. 4.7). Evidence also

suggests that TZDs slow the rate of  $\beta\text{-cell}$  function loss more than oral antidiabetics do.  $^{147}$ 

## **Differences Among Drugs in Class**

The main drugs are rosiglitazone—the first, but now suspended in Europe—and the safer pioglitazone. <sup>148</sup> The FDA restricted access to rosiglitazone in September 2010.

#### Data for Use

**Glycemic control.** In the ACT NOW trial, pioglitazone reduced the risk of conversion of impaired glucose tolerance to T2DM by 72% but was associated with significant weight gain and edema. However, TZDs may achieve glycemic control without excessive risk of hypoglycemia. 149

Cardiovascular benefits. Pioglitazone (Actos) although found to increase CHF, was associated with decreased mortality, MI, and stroke. In the IRIS (Insulin Resistance Intervention after Stroke) trial, patients with a recent history of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack receiving pioglitazone had lower risk of stroke or MI (HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62–0.93; P = 0.007). While the PROACTIVE (Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial In Macrovascular Events) trial also demonstrated a potential beneficial cardiovascular effect by reducing the risk of the composite primary endpoint (death from any cause, nonfatal MI, coronary revascularization, or revascularization of the leg) compared to placebo (HR 0.90; 95% CI 0.80–1.02; P = 0.095), this result was nonsignificant. However, the secondary endpoint, three-point MACE, was significantly reduced by 16% (HR 0.84, P = 0.027). <sup>145</sup> In a large UK general practice research database on people with a mean follow-up of 7.1 years, pioglitazone was associated with reduced all-cause mortality compared with metformin and with rosiglitazone. 150

#### Side Effects

**Cardiovascular.** While cardiovascular benefits of pioglitazone have been observed, multiple publications suggest possibly harmful cardiovascular effects of the now infrequently used drug rosiglitazone.

Fluid retention seems to be an important side effect of TZDs, which is associated with HF.<sup>152</sup> This explains the results of the two large outcome trials, DREAM (Diabetes Reduction Assessment with Ramipril and Rosiglitazone Medication)<sup>144</sup> and ProACTIVE, <sup>145</sup> which reported relative risk increase of HF. The ADA/EASD 2019 Standards of Care suggest avoiding TZDs in patients with symptomatic HF.<sup>31</sup> This advice was also issued in a scientific statement from the HFSA.<sup>133</sup> Here the authors stated that even in patients with T2DMs without HF, TZDs may increase the risk of HF events.<sup>133</sup>

Weight gain. In addition, TZDs are associated with weight gain. 142

**Bladder cancer.** There is conflicting evidence on whether pioglitazone is linked to bladder cancer. Nevertheless, the FDA has issued a warning that physicians should not subscribe pioglitazone to patients with active bladder cancer. <sup>146</sup>

**Bone fractures.** TZDs may increase the risk of fractures due to reduction in bone mineral density, especially in women. <sup>143</sup> The 2019 ADA/EASD Standards of Care also state that TZDs should be used with care in patients at risk of falls or fractures. <sup>31</sup>

**Lipid profiles.** Glitazones favorably increase HDL-C by 19%, potentially offsetting an LDL-C increase of 8%, while reducing

TGs and glycemia (Fig. 4.1).  $^{153}$  Total LDL-C rose more with rosiglitazone, whereas pioglitazone increased HDL-C levels much more than rosiglitazone.  $^{154}$  Pioglitazone decreased fasting TGs, which was increased by rosiglitazone.  $^{154}$  These changes may help to explain why rosiglitazone but not pioglitazone monotherapy was associated with increased  $\mathrm{MI}^{62,155}$  and mortality.  $^{149}$ 

## **Drugs Interactions or Major Restriction**

Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are metabolized via cytochrome P450. Consequently, simultaneous subscription with rifampicin decreases the AUC, while the addition to gemfibrozil increases the AUC by almost three fold.  $^{156,157}$ 

# **Experimental Drugs**

In the last decade, dual PPAR  $\alpha/\gamma$  agonists have gained international attention due to their combination of insulin-sensitizing and lipid-lowering capabilities. While many dual PPAR  $\alpha/\gamma$  agonists failed during preclinical stages due to safety issues or efficacy, saroglitazar is approved in India for the treatment of diabetic dyslipidemia. The phase III trial PRESS V (Prospective Randomized Efficacy and Safety of Saroglitazar V) demonstrated the reduction of plasma TG levels with 2mg saroglitazar by 26.4% and with 4mg by 45%. In this trial HbA1c levels were also decreased by  $-0.3\%\pm0.6\%$  with saroglitazar 4mg.  $^{159}$  Another phase III trial, PRESS VI, also showed that 2mg and 4mg saroglitazar reduced HbA1c TG levels by  $-45.5\%\pm3.03\%$  and  $-46.7\%\pm3.02\%$ , respectively.  $^{159}$  However the reduction of HbA1c levels in this trial was not significant.  $^{159}$ 

## **Sulfonylureas**

## **Drug Class Overview**

Sulfonylureas are oral antidiabetic drugs known for their high glucose-lowering efficacy while being relatively inexpensive. However, they are also associated with significant weight gain and risk of hypoglycemia. If cost is a determining factor in a patient without known CVD, sulfonylureas may be a reasonable choice. <sup>73</sup>

#### **Mechanisms of Action**

These are insulin secretagogues that stimulate insulin secretion by inhibiting adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–sensitive potassium channels of  $\beta\text{-cells.}^{160}$ 

#### **Differences Among Drugs in Class**

Sulfonylureas can be distinguished between the older first-generation (tolbutamide) and newer agents belonging to the second generation (glipizide, glibenclamide, [glyburide], gliclazide, and glimepiride). Overall, hypoglycemia is less common with short-acting agents (gliclazide) compared to long-acting sulfonylureas (glibenclamide) <sup>161</sup>; however, in contrast with other sulfonylureas, glibenclamide is associated with the highest risk of hypoglycemia. <sup>162</sup> As a result, the ADA/EASD 2019 Standards of Care state that short-acting agents like glipizide are preferred. Glibenclamide is contraindicated in older adults, as these individuals have a higher risk of hypoglycemia. <sup>31</sup> For patients with renal impairment, it is important to keep in mind that glibenclamide and gliquidone are predominantly excreted biliary, while other agents are excreted through urine. <sup>163</sup>

#### Data for Use

**Glycemic control.** Sulfonylureas have a high glucose-lowering efficacy. In a systematic review of 31 double-blind randomized controlled trials, sulfonylureas lowered HbA1c levels by 1.51% compared to placebo. In comparison to other oral glucose-lowering agents, sulfonylureas lowered HbA1c by 1.62%, and compared to insulin by 0.46% (mean baseline HbA1c varied from 4.6% to 13.6% between the individual trials). <sup>164</sup> However, it is also known that sulfonylureas do not have a lasting effect on lowering glucose levels. <sup>165</sup>

#### Side Effects

Cardiovascular effects. Because the sulfonylurea receptor SUR2a is also expressed on cardiomyocytes, it has long been held that these drugs might also interfere with cardiac function. Indeed. several smaller-scale clinical trials and experimental studies have suggested an impairment of ischemic preconditioning with sulfonylurea drugs. 166 Besides these potential direct effects of sulfonylureas on cardiac and vascular functions, hypoglycemia, as commonly seen during sulfonylurea therapy, is associated with cardiac arrhythmias, thereby providing an additional potential mechanism linking these drugs to increased cardiovascular events. 167 There are few prospective studies on the long-term major clinical effect of these agents on outcomes in T2DM. The University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP) study from the 1960s initially suggested a high incidence of cardiovascular mortality in patients treated with the sulfonylurea agent tolbutamide. <sup>168</sup> In contrast, the UKPD study revealed no significant effect of glibenclamide on either mortality or the incidence of cardiovascular events.<sup>49</sup> There are few

prospective studies on the long-term major clinical effect of these agents on outcomes in T2DM. Monotherapy with the most-used agents, including glimepiride, glibenclamide, glipizide, and tolbutamide, was associated with increased mortality and cardiovascular risk compared with metformin in a large prospective registry trial.  $^{169}$  Findings from a more recent meta-analysis observed no increase in all-cause mortality in comparison to other treatment plans.  $^{170}$  In addition, the recently published CAROLINA study affirmed the cardiovascular safety of sulfonylureas; CAROLINA observed no major differences in cardiovascular risk between glimepiride (sulfonylurea) and linagliptin (DPP4 inhibitor) (three-point MACE occurred in 11.8% of participants subscribed linagliptin and 12.0% of individuals taking glimepiride (HR 0.98; P=0.7625).  $^{171}$ 

**Weight gain.** In addition, sulfonylureas are also associated with weight gain. Patients prescribed glibenclamide in the UPKDS study gained 4kg of weight in the first 3 years. <sup>49</sup> In the ADOPT study (A Diabetes Outcome Progression Trial), glyburide resulted in a 1.6kg weight gain after 12 months (95% CI 1.0–2.2). <sup>172</sup>

**Hypoglycemia.** A systematic review of a population-based study concluded sulfonylureas had a prevalence of mild/moderate (defined as no third-party assistance needed during the episode) hypoglycemic events of 30% and a severe prevalence (third-party assistance was needed) of 5%. Nevertheless, sulfonylureas still had less hypoglycemic incidences than insulin. <sup>174</sup> Evidence suggests that especial care should be taken prescribing sulfonylureas to elderly patients with low HbA1c or impaired renal function, as in these patients hypoglycemic episodes occur more frequently. <sup>174–176</sup>

## **Drug Interactions or Major Restriction**

Evidence suggests that sulfonylureas interact with drugs that utilize CYP2C9 substrates, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and increase risk of hypoglycemia. 177

#### Insulin

#### **Drug Class Overview**

After failed oral or GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) therapy, insulin is the remaining requirement, as in the current Standards of Care.

The current 2019 ADA Standards of Care suggest administering insulin if patients show signs of catabolism like weight loss, hyperglycemia, HbA1c levels  $>\!10\%$  (86 mmol/mol), or blood glucose levels over 300 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L).  $^{31}$ 

#### Mechanisms of Action

Long-acting insulin preparations (degludec, insulin glargine) inhibit endogenous glucose production (mostly liver) after meals. Rapid-acting insulins, on the other hand, are used if/ when basal insulin therapy is not sufficient to achieve or maintain level of glycemia.<sup>73</sup> Bolus insulins (lispro, aspart, glulisine) help to limit postprandial increases in plasma glucose after meals. Inhaled insulin is more rapid in onset and, along with bolus insulins, can be used to correct hyperglycemia; however, larger studies are needed to confirm any benefits compared to injectable insulins. These insulins are the preferred agents for T2DM according to the 2018 EASD-ADA Standards of Care. 73 Decludec's insulin mechanism is particularly interesting. The long-acting flat profile of degludec forms a deposit of soluble subcutaneous multihexamers from which insulin is slowly and continuously absorbed into the circulation, thus being "not a revolution but an evolution" of insulin therapy for T1DM and  $T2DM^{180}$ 

## **Differences Among Drugs in Class**

As the most basic difference, insulins differ in their action profile between rapid-, short-, intermediate-, and long-acting agents. Combination insulins include basal and prandial insulin types, which cover a patient's basal and bolus insulin needs simultaneously by one injection. Evidence suggests that long-acting insulins offer a modest advantage compared to neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin regarding risk of hypoglycemia but are more costly. <sup>180</sup> Increases in the cost of insulins have been a major issue for patients and treating health care professionals. <sup>181</sup> However, in real-world hospital settings there was no hypoglycemia risk differences in NPH and long-acting insulins. <sup>182</sup> Clinicians should also keep in mind that in patients with high CVD risk, decludec is associated with lower risk of sever hypoglycemia compared to glargine U100. <sup>183</sup>

#### Data for Use

**Glycemic control.** When added to metformin, insulins can reduce HbA1c levels up to 4.9% in patients with T2DM. <sup>184</sup> Well established in clinical practice is the addition of insulin to oral agents for therapy intensification. In a study in which participants were prescribed metformin and insulin, HbA1c was significantly reduced compared to insulin monotherapy. In addition, patients in the insulin-metformin group gained less weight and had fewer incidences of hypoglycemia. <sup>185</sup> A meta-analysis confirmed that not only the combination of metformin and insulin but also the

addition of TZDs and sulfonylureas to insulin improve glycemic control.  $^{186}$  In all studies, the average insulin-sparing effect of the addition of oral agents was 62%.  $^{186}$ 

#### Side Effects

Cardiovascular. The often presumed increased risk of HF caused by fluid retention with insulin treatment has not been translated into a consistent increase in the rate of mortality or hospitalization for HF.<sup>74</sup> In addition, the Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine Intervention trial (ORIGIN) showed that the addition of the basal insulin glargine and an oral agent in patients with prediabetes or new-onset T2DM does not increase the risk of cardiovascular events. The incident rates of cardiovascular outcomes were similar in the glargine group versus the standard care (2.94 glargine and 2.85 standard care per 100 person-years). A meta-analysis of four trials (ACCORD, ADVANCE, VADT, and UKPDS) evaluating outcomes of tight glycemic control showed an overall 9% reduction in major cardiovascular events (HR 0.91; 95% CI 0.84–0.99) in the intensive glucose-lowering arm compared to the standard arm, mainly due to 15% reduction of MI. 188

**Hypoglycemia.** The major problem with insulin is that hyperglycemia control may be bought at the cost of hypoglycemia. A meta-analysis of glucose-lowering drugs showed that basal insulins and sulfonylureas had the highest risk of hypoglycemia (OR, 17.9 [95% CI 1.97–162]; RD, 10% [95% CI 0.08%–20%]). <sup>189</sup>

**Weight gain.** A particularly pressing issue is the weight gain associated with insulin therapy. The UKPDS study demonstrated that after 10 years after insulin therapy initiation, patients gained on average 7kg of weight.<sup>49</sup> Of note, combination injection therapy of GLP-1 receptor agonists and insulin is associated with less weight gain and hypoglycemia, compared to intensified insulin plans, while maintaining the same glucose lowering efficacy.<sup>190</sup>

## **Drug Interactions or Major Restriction**

Numerous agents have adverse reactions with insulin. Several substrates have glucose-lowering effects and should not be administered with insulin to avoid the risk of hypoglycemia. Glucose-lowering effects have been observed when insulin is combined with some antibiotics,  $^{191}$   $\beta$ -blockers, salicylates, and alcohol. Diuretics,  $^{192}$  steroids, and oral contraceptives promote peripheral IR and reduce insulin release and thereby may reduce the amount of exogenous insulin needed.

Inhaled insulins should not be prescribed to patients who are smokers or suffer from asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or other chronic lung diseases.<sup>31</sup>

# **Hypoglycemia**

Not only do microvascular and macrovascular complications of DM pose risks to DM patients, but hypoglycemic episodes equally enhance risks of diabetic morbidity.

Hypoglycemia seems to especially affect cardiovascular health. Episodes of hypoglycemia promote platelet aggregation, <sup>193</sup> inflammation, <sup>193</sup> endothelial dysfunction, <sup>194,195</sup> and proarrhythmogenic processes <sup>196</sup> that increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events (Table 4.7).

#### **Trial Data**

Multiple studies have observed the relationship between cardiovascular outcomes and hypoglycemic episodes. In a study including patients examining the association between severe hypoglycemia and adverse clinical outcome, patients with severe hypoglycemia had a significantly higher incidents of macrovascular events (HR 2.88; 95% CI 2.01–4.12) compared to patients without episodes of hypoglycemia. 197 This was confirmed in the EXAMINE trial, in which patients with severe hypoglycemia had a HR of 2.42 (95% CI 1.27–4.60; P=0.007) for risk of major adverse cardiovascular events. 198 Hypoglycemia has also been shown to affect development of atherosclerosis, as a study reported association between hypoglycemia and higher CAC scores (CAC > 100 Agatston units). 199 Data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC), a prospective cohort analysis including 1209 individuals, concluded that participants with severe hypoglycemic events had higher rates of cardiovascular disease, CHD, HF, atrial fibrillation, peripheral artery disease, and all-cause mortality. The risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1.73; 95% CI 1.38–2.17), cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.64; 95% CI 1.15-2.34), and CHD (HR 2.02; 95% CI 1.27–3.2) reached statistical significance.<sup>200</sup>

However, some suggest that this relationship may be explained due to confounding factors. Individuals who experience hypoglycemic episode are older, more likely to suffer from comorbid illnesses, and are also more vulnerable cardiovascular disease. <sup>198</sup> On the other hand, a bias analysis including data from over patients in observational studies showed that there is a strong direct relationship between hypoglycemia and cardiovascular disease. <sup>199</sup> Even though this meta-analysis concluded that a moderate heterogeneity across the included studies exists, in the stratified analysis most subgroups showed similar results. <sup>199</sup>

# **Diabetes Drugs and Hypoglycemia**

A marked difference exists between glucose-lowering drugs and their individual risk of hypoglycemia. In a meta-analysis of second-line T2DM agents, only insulins, sulfonylureas, and glinides increased risk of hypoglycemia compared to placebo (OR of 8.86 [95% CI 4.63–17.83], 10.51 [95% CI 3.59–38.32], 4.77 [95% CI 1.35–18.3] and 17.78 [95% CI 4.84–69.98], respectively). Newer antidiabetic drugs like SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and DPP-4 inhibitors have a very low risk or even reduce risk of hypoglycemia.

# Guidelines

Overall, the 2019 ADA/EASD Standards of Care endorse an individualized approach to pharmacological DM therapy (Fig. 4.8). Key comorbidities (ASCVD, HF, and CKD), effect on weight gain, risk of hypoglycemia, cost, and patient preference should all be taken into consideration when deciding on the antidiabetic agent.

Metformin is still recommended as the primary agent for T2DM. If HbA1c target is not achieved after 3 months, the choice of add-on therapy to metformin can be guided by comorbidities. Due to the cardiovascular benefit demonstrated for GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors, these agents should be used for patients with established ASCVD. If HF or CKD predominates, SGLT-2 inhibitors should be initiated, which demonstrated inhibition of HF and CKD progression in CVOTs, if the eGFR is acceptable. Empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and canagliflozin have proven to reduce HF incidence and CKD development in CVOTs. If patients do not tolerate SGLT-2 inhibitors or the eGFR is not adequate, GLP-1 receptor agonists should be used with evidence of reducing CVD events. For GLP-1 receptor agonists, liraglutide was shown to have the strongest evidence.

TZDs should be avoided in patients with HF. If weight loss is a therapeutic goal, then physicians can prescribe GLP-1 receptor agonists. Semaglutide had the greatest evidence for weight loss. Due to the moderate glucose-lowering efficacy of DPP-4 inhibitors and the possible elevated risk of HF associated with some DPP-4 inhibitor agents, it is only second-line therapy in the guidelines.

# Future Directions

# Cardiometabolic Specialist

The strong relationship between DM and CVD has long been established. T2DM medication now also can affect cardiovascular health, as recent large outcome trials of GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors have demonstrated. In light of this, some argue that T2DM cannot be allotted to one specialty but be described as a cardiometabolic disease requiring expert clinical knowledge of both endocrinologists and cardiologists. Initiation of "cardiometabolic" specialist training programs combining fields of expertise of endocrinologist, cardiologists, and primary care doctors is currently under discussion. The cardiometabolic specialist integrating these disciplines offers the most benefit to the increasingly aging and obese patients with T2DM and cardiovascular disease.<sup>203</sup> The cardiometabolic specialist integrates disciplines that offer the most benefit to the increasingly aging and obese patients with T2DM and cardiovascular disease.<sup>203</sup>

# Vitamin D

Current research has posited low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels as a risk factor for T2DM, and observational studies have supported this association.2–<sup>4</sup> However, a trial randomizing 2423 participants to 4000IU of vitamin D per day did not find a significantly lower risk of T2DM than placebo.<sup>205</sup>

# Oral Semaglutide

A novel development in GLP-1 research is the development of an oral formulation of semaglutide that proved successful in multiple trials. The series of PIONEER (Peptide Innovation for Early Diabetes Treatment) trials compared oral semaglutide to placebo,<sup>206</sup> sitagliptin,<sup>207</sup> and liraglutide,<sup>208</sup> and concluded that oral semaglutide was superior to all of these agents in terms of weight loss and HbA1c reduction. In addition, oral semaglutide proved safe for patients with T2DM with renal impairment.<sup>209</sup> Current

#### 276 4 — Drugs for Diabetes

studies have demonstrated promising results regarding cardiovascular outcomes. Oral semaglutide was shown to be noninferior to placebo by reducing the risk of the primary outcome by 21% (P < 0.001) in PIONEER 6, but due to the small scale of the trial (PIONEER 6 enrolled 3183 patients), it was too underpowered to demonstrate superiority. The study also showed oral semaglutide's cardiovascular benefit by extensively lowering the risk of multiple secondary endpoints; oral semaglutide significantly reduced death from cardiovascular cause (HR 0.49; 95% CI 0.27–0.92) and all-cause mortality (HR 0.51; 95% CI 0.31– 0.84) compared to placebo. The oral form of GLP-1 receptor agonists will hopefully improve therapy adherence compared to injectable medication.
