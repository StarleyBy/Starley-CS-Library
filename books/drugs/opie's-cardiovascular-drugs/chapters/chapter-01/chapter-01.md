# Drugs for Ischemic Heart Disease

WILLIAM E. BODEN

# Introduction

The contemporary management of patients with ischemic heart disease demands a sound understanding of the pathophysiologic precipitants of both angina pectoris and myocardial ischemia from which the principles of pharmacotherapy can be applied and tailored to the specific causes underlying these perturbations of myocardial oxygen supply and demand. This chapter details several broad classes of drug therapies directed at both symptom relief and ameliorating the consequences of reduced coronary blood flow and myocardial supply-demand imbalances for which specific treatments are targeted, including the traditional agents (β-blockers, nitrates, calcium channel blockers) as well as newer, non-traditional antianginal agents such as ranolazine as well as agents (ivabradine, nicorandil, and trimetazidine) that are not available for use in the US, but are in use internationally. These drugs are discussed comprehensively for both acute and chronic coronary syndromes, with particular attention to drug selection, dosing considerations, drug interactions, and common side effects that may influence treatment considerations.

# β-Blockers

# Introduction

β-adrenergic receptor antagonist agents remain a therapeutic mainstay in the management of ischemic heart disease with the exception of variant angina or myocardial ischemia due to coronary vasospasm. β-blockade is still widely regarded as standard therapy in cardiology professional society guidelines for exertional angina, unstable angina, and for variable threshold angina (or mixed

angina), particularly where increases in heart rate and/or blood pressure (BP) (including the rate-pressure product rise that occurs during exercise or stress) results in an increase in myocardial oxygen consumption. β-blockers have an important role in reducing mortality when used as secondary prevention after acute myocardial infarction (MI), though outcomes data are lacking to support a beneficial role of β-blockers in ischemic heart disease patients without prior MI. And while β-blockers exert a markedly beneficial effect on outcomes in patients with heart failure, particularly in those with reduced EF, and have an important role as antiarrhythmic agents and to control the ventricular rate in chronic atrial fibrillation, as well as to adjunctively treat hypertension, the therapeutic applications of β-blockers in these other disease states will not be discussed in this chapter. Established and approved indications for  $\beta$ -blockers in the United States are shown in Table 1.1.

The extraordinary complexity of the β-adrenergic signaling system probably evolved millions of years ago when rapid activation was required for hunting and resisting animals, with the need for rapid inactivation during the period of rest and recovery. These mechanisms are now analyzed.1

#### **Mechanism of Action**

The  $\beta_1$ -adrenoceptor and signal transduction. Situated on the cardiac sarcolemma, the  $\beta_1$ -receptor is part of the adenylyl (= adenyl) cyclase system (Fig. 1.1) and is one of the group of G proteincoupled receptors. The G protein system links the receptor to adenylyl cyclase (AC) when the G protein is in the stimulatory configuration (G<sub>s</sub>, also called Gas). The link is interrupted by the inhibitory form (G<sub>i</sub> or Gai), the formation of which results from muscarinic stimulation following vagal activation. When activated, AC produces cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The intracellular second messenger of  $\beta_1$ -stimulation is cAMP; among its actions is the "opening" of calcium channels to increase the rate and force of myocardial contraction (the positive inotropic effect) and increased reuptake of cytosolic calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR; relaxing or lusitropic effect, see Fig. 1.1). In the sinus node the pacemaker current is increased (positive chronotropic effect), and the rate of conduction is accelerated (positive dromotropic effect). The effect of a given β-blocking agent depends on the way it is absorbed, the binding to plasma proteins, the generation of metabolites, and the extent to which it inhibits the  $\beta$ -receptor (lock-and-key fit).

**β**<sub>2</sub>-receptors. The β-receptors classically are divided into the  $\beta_1$ -receptors found in heart muscle and the  $\beta_2$ -receptors of bronchial and vascular smooth muscle. If the β-blocking drug selectively interacts better with the  $\beta_1$ -than the  $\beta_2$ -receptors, then such a  $\beta_1$ -selective blocker is less likely to interact with the  $\beta_2$ -receptors in the bronchial tree, thereby giving a degree of protection from the tendency of non-selective β-blockers to cause pulmonary complications.

 $β_3$ -receptors. Endothelial  $β_3$ -receptors mediate the vasodilation induced by nitric oxide in response to the vasodilating β-blocker nebivolol (see Fig. 1.2).  $^{2,3}$ 

Secondary effects of β-receptor blockade. During physiologic  $\beta$ -adrenergic stimulation, the increased contractile activity resulting from the greater and faster rise of cytosolic calcium (Fig. 1.3) is coupled to increased breakdown of ATP by the myosin adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase). The increased rate of relaxation is linked to increased activity of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake pump. Thus, the uptake of calcium is enhanced with a more rapid rate of fall of cytosolic calcium, thereby accelerating relaxation. Increased cAMP also increases the phosphorylation of troponin-I, so that the interaction between the myosin heads and actin ends more rapidly. Therefore, the  $\beta$ -blocked heart not only beats more slowly by inhibition of the depolarizing currents

in the sinoatrial (SA) node but has a decreased force of contraction and decreased rate of relaxation. Metabolically,  $\beta$ -blockade switches the heart from using oxygen-wasting fatty acids toward oxygen-conserving glucose. All these oxygen-conserving properties are of special importance in the therapy of ischemic heart disease. Inhibition of lipolysis in adipose tissue explains why gain of body mass may be a side effect of chronic  $\beta$ -blocker therapy.

# Cardiovascular Effects of β-Blockade

β-blockers were originally designed by the Nobel prize winner Sir James Black to counteract the adverse cardiac effects of adrenergic stimulation. The latter, he reasoned, increased myocardial oxygen demand and worsened angina. His work led to the design of the prototype β-blocker, *propranolol*. By blocking the cardiac β-receptors, he showed that these agents could induce the now well-known inhibitory effects on the sinus node, atrioventricular (AV) node, and on myocardial contraction. These are the negative chronotropic, dromotropic, and inotropic effects, respectively (Fig. 1.4). Of these, it is especially bradycardia and the negative inotropic effects that are relevant to the therapeutic effect in angina pectoris and in patients with ischemic heart disease because these changes decrease the myocardial oxygen demand (Fig. 1.5). The inhibitory effect on the AV node is of special relevance in the therapy of supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs; see Chapter 9), or when β-blockade is used to control the ventricular response rate in atrial fibrillation.

Fig. 1.1, Cont'd β-adrenergic signal systems involved in positive inotropic and lusitropic (enhanced relaxation) effects. These can be explained in terms of changes in the cardiac calcium cycle. When the β-adrenergic agonist interacts with the β-receptor, a series of G protein-mediated changes lead to activation of adenylate cyclase and formation of the adrenergic second messenger, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The latter acts via protein kinase A (PKA) to stimulate metabolism and to phosphorylate (P) the calcium channel protein, thus increasing the opening probability of this channel. More  $Ca^{2+}$  ions enter through the sarcolemmal channel, to release more  $Ca^{2+}$  ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Thus the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions also increase the rate of breakdown of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate  $(P_i)$ . Enhanced myosin adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity explains the increased rate of contraction, with increased activation of troponin-C explaining increased peak force development. An increased rate of relaxation (lusitropic effect) follows from phosphorylation of the protein phospholamban (PL), situated on the membrane of the SR, that controls the rate of calcium uptake into the SR.

# VASODILATORY β-BLOCKERS

![](_page_6_Figure_3.jpeg)

Fig. 1.2 Vasodilatory mechanisms and effects. Vasodilatory β-blockers tend to decrease the cardiac output less as the systemic vascular resistance falls. Vasodilatory mechanisms include  $\alpha$ -blockade (carvedilol), formation of nitric oxide (nebivolol and carvedilol), and intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). ISA, as in pindolol, has a specific effect in increasing sympathetic tone when it is low, as at night, and increasing nocturnal heart rate, which might be disadvantageous in nocturnal angina or unstable angina. cAMP, Cyclic adenosine monophosphate; NO, nitric oxide. (Figure © L. H. Opie, 2012.)

Effects on coronary flow and myocardial perfusion. Enhanced  $\beta$ -adrenergic stimulation, as in exercise, leads to  $\beta$ -mediated coronary vasodilation. The signaling system in vascular smooth muscle again involves the formation of cAMP, but whereas the latter agent increases cytosolic calcium in the heart, it paradoxically decreases calcium levels in vascular muscle cells (see Fig. 1.6). Thus, during exercise, the heart pumps faster and more forcefully while coronary flow is augmented to meet the increased demand imposed by the increment in external workload. Conversely, while  $\beta$ -blockade

Fig. 1.3 The β-adrenergic receptor is coupled to adenyl (¼ adenylyl) cyclase (AC) via the activated stimulatory G-protein, Gs. Consequent formation of the second messenger, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) activates protein kinase A (PKA) to phosphorylate (P) the calcium channel to increase calcium ion (Ca2 +) entry. Activity of AC can be decreased by the inhibitory subunits of the acetylcholine (ACh)–associated inhibitory G-protein, Gi . cAMP is broken down by phosphodiesterase (PDE) so that PDE-inhibitor drugs have a sympathomimetic effect. The PDE is type 3 in contrast to the better-known PDE type 5 that is inhibited by sildenafil (see Fig. 2.6). A current hypothesis is that the β2–receptor stimulation additionally signals via the inhibitory G-protein, Gi , thereby modulating the harm of excess adrenergic activity. (Figure © L. H. Opie, 2012.)

should have a coronary vasoconstrictive effect with a rise in coronary vascular resistance, the longer diastolic filling time resulting from a decreased heart rate during exercise leads to more nutritive coronary blood flow and better diastolic myocardial perfusion.

# Pharmacokinetic Properties of β-Blockers

Plasma half-lives. Esmolol, given intravenously, has the shortest of all half-lives at only 9 minutes. Esmolol may therefore be preferable in unstable angina and threatened infarction when hemodynamic changes may call for withdrawal of β-blockade.

The half-life of propranolol (Table 1.2) is only 3 hours, but continued administration saturates the hepatic process that removes propranolol from the circulation; the active metabolite 4-hydroxypropranolol is formed, and the effective half-life then becomes longer. The biological half-life of propranolol and metoprolol (and all other  $\beta$ -blockers) exceeds the plasma half-life considerably, so that twice-daily dosages of standard propranolol are effective even in angina pectoris. Clearly, the higher the dose of any  $\beta$ -blocker, the longer the biologic effects. Longer-acting compounds such as nadolol, sotalol, atenolol, and slow-release propranolol (Inderal-LA) or extended-release metoprolol (Toprol-XL) should be better for hypertension and effort angina.

**Protein binding.** Propranolol is highly bound, as are pindolol, labetalol, and bisoprolol. Hypoproteinemia calls for lower doses of such compounds.

**First-pass hepatic metabolism.** First-pass liver metabolism is found especially with the highly lipid-soluble compounds, such as propranolol, labetalol, and oxprenolol. Major hepatic clearance is also found with acebutolol, nebivolol, metoprolol, and timolol. First-pass metabolism varies greatly among patients and alters the

Note unexpected proposal that β-blockade diminishes exercise-induced vasoconstriction. (Figure © L. H. Opie, 2012.)

dose required. In liver disease or low-output states the dose should be decreased. First-pass metabolism produces active metabolites with, in the case of propranolol, properties different from those of the parent compound. Metabolism of metoprolol occurs predominantly via cytochrome (CY) P450 2D6–mediated hydroxylation and is subject to marked genetic variability.5 Acebutolol produces large amounts of diacetolol, and is also cardioselective with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), but with a longer half-life and chiefly excreted by the kidneys (Fig. 1.7). Lipidinsoluble hydrophilic compounds (atenolol, sotalol, nadolol) are excreted only by the kidneys (see Fig. 1.7) and have low brain penetration. In patients with renal or liver disease, the simpler pharmacokinetic patterns of lipid-insoluble agents make dosage easier. As a group, these agents have low protein binding (see Table 1.2).

Pharmacokinetic interactions. Those drugs metabolized by the liver and hence prone to hepatic interactions are metoprolol,

carvedilol, labetalol, and propranolol, of which metoprolol and carvedilol are more frequently used. Both are metabolized by the hepatic CYP2D6 system that is inhibited by paroxetine, a widely used antidepressant that is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. To avoid such hepatic interactions, it is simpler to use those βblockers not metabolized by the liver (see Fig. 1.7). β-blockers, in turn, depress hepatic blood flow so that the blood levels of lidocaine increase with greater risk of lidocaine toxicity.

Fig. 1.7 Comparative routes of elimination of β-blockers. Those most hydrophilic and least lipid-soluble are excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Those most lipophilic and least water-soluble are largely metabolized by the liver. Note that the metabolite of acebutolol, diacetolol, is largely excreted by the kidney, in contrast to the parent compound. (For derivation of data in figure, see third edition. Estimated data points for acebutolol and newer agents added.) (Figure © L. H. Opie, 2012.)

# Data for Use: Clinical Indications for β-Blockers

# Angina Pectoris

Symptomatic reversible myocardial ischemia often reflects classical effort angina. Here the fundamental problem is inadequacy of coronary vasodilation in the face of increased myocardial oxygen demand, typically resulting from exercise-induced tachycardia (see Fig. 1.8). However, in many patients, there is also a variable element of associated coronary (and possibly systemic) vasoconstriction that may account for the precipitation of symptoms by cold exposure combined with exercise in patients with "mixed-pattern" angina. The choice of prophylactic antianginal agents should reflect the presumptive mechanisms of precipitation of ischemia.

β-blockade reduces the oxygen demand of the heart (see Fig. 1.5) by reducing the double product (heart rate BP) and by limiting exercise-induced increases in contractility. Of these, the most important and easiest to measure is the reduction in heart rate. In addition, an aspect frequently neglected is the increased

oxygen demand resulting from left ventricular (LV) dilation, so that any accompanying ventricular failure needs active therapy.

All β-blockers are potentially equally effective in angina pectoris (see Table 1.1), and the choice of drug matters little in those who do not have concomitant diseases. But a minority of patients do not respond to any  $\beta$ -blocker because of underlying severe obstructive coronary artery disease, responsible for angina even at low levels of exertion and at heart rates of 100 beats/min or lower: or an abnormal increase in LV end-diastolic pressure resulting from an excess negative inotropic effect and a consequent decrease in subendocardial blood flow. Although it is conventional to adjust the dose of a β-blocker to secure a resting heart rate of 55 to 60 beats/min, in individual patients, heart rates less than 50 beats/ min may be acceptable provided that heart block is avoided and there are no symptoms. The reduced heart rate at rest reflects the relative increase in vagal tone as adrenergic stimulation decreases. A major benefit is the restricted increase in the heart rate during exercise, which ideally should not exceed 100 beats/min in patients with angina. The effectiveness of medical therapy for stable angina pectoris, in which the use of β-blockers is a central component, is similar to that of percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting.<sup>6</sup>

Combination antiischemic therapy of angina pectoris. β-blockers are often combined with nitrate vasodilators and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) in the therapy of angina (see Table 1.3). However, the combined use of β-blockers with nondihydropyridine calcium antagonists (e.g., verapamil, diltiazem) should in general be avoided because of the risks of excess bradycardia and precipitation of heart failure, whereas the combination with long-acting dihydropyridines (DHPs) is well documented.<sup>7</sup>

Combination therapy in angina. Angina is basically a vascular disease that needs specific therapy designed to give long-term vascular protection. The following agents should be considered for every patient with angina: aspirin and/or clopidogrel for antiplatelet protection, statins and a lipid-lowering diet to decrease lipid-induced vascular damage, and an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that has proven protection from MI and with the doses tested. Combinations of prophylactic antianginal agents are necessary in some patients to suppress symptoms but have less clear-cut prognostic implications.

Vasospastic angina. β-blockade is commonly held to be ineffective and even harmful because of lack of efficacy. On the other

hand, there is excellent evidence for the benefit of CCB therapy, which is the standard treatment. In the case of exercise-induced anginal attacks in patients with variant angina, a small prospective randomized study in 20 patients showed that nifedipine was considerably more effective than propranolol.8

Cold intolerance and angina. During exposure to severe cold, effort angina may occur more easily (the phenomenon of mixed-pattern angina). Conventional β-blockade by propranolol is not as good as vasodilatory therapy by a CCB<sup>9</sup> and may reflect failure to protect from regional coronary vasoconstriction in such patients. 10

**Silent myocardial ischemia.** Episodes of myocardial ischemia, for example detected by continuous electrocardiographic recordings, may be precipitated by minor elevations of heart rate, probably explaining why β-blockers are very effective in reducing the frequency and number of episodes of silent ischemic attacks. In patients with silent ischemia and mild or no angina, atenolol given for 1 year lessened new events (angina aggravation, revascularization) and reduced combined endpoints.11

# **Acute Coronary Syndrome**

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is an all-purpose term, including unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction (AMI), so that management is based on risk stratification (see Fig. 1.9). Plaque fissuring in the wall of the coronary artery with partial coronary thrombosis or platelet aggregation on an area of endothelial disruption is the basic pathologic condition. Urgent antithrombotic therapy with heparin (unfractionated or low molecular weight) or other antithrombotics, plus aspirin is the basic treatment (see Chapter 8). Currently, early multiple platelet-receptor blockade is standard in high-risk patients.

β-blockade is a part of conventional in-hospital quadruple therapy, the other three agents being statins, antiplatelet agents, and ACE inhibitors, a combination that reduces 6-month mortality by 90% compared with treatment by none of these.  $^{12}$   $\beta$ -blockade is usually started early, especially in patients with elevated BP and heart rate, to reduce the myocardial oxygen demand and to lessen ischemia (see Fig. 1.5). The major argument for early β-blockade is that threatened infarction, into which unstable angina merges, may be prevented from becoming overt. 13 Logically, the lower the heart rate, the less the risk of recurrent ischemia. However, the actual objective evidence favoring the use of  $\beta$ -blockers in unstable angina itself is limited to borderline results in one placebocontrolled trial, <sup>14</sup> plus only indirect evidence from two observational studies. <sup>12,15</sup>

# ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROMES: TRIAGE

![](_page_19_Figure_2.jpeg)

Fig. 1.9 Principles of triage for acute coronary syndromes (ACS) with non–ST-elevation (non-STE). All receive aspirin. Patients are stratified according to the risk are given unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and bivalirudin (no glycoprotein [GP] Ilb/Illa, as below). Those at high risk are given ticagrelor or clopidogrel and taken to the catheter laboratory. Then they either undergo coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Those undergoing PCI are given ticagrelor (or prasugrel), if not yet given, and some are selected to be given GPIIb/Illa inhibitors. Those at low risk are closely observed and, if requiring an angiogram (angio), given ticagrelor or prasugrel to be followed by PCI. Those at lower risk and stable are subject to an effort stress test. (Figure © B.J. Gersh, 2012.)

# **Acute ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction**

**Early ST-elevation myocardial infarction.** There are no good trial data on the early use of β-blockade in the reperfusion era. Logically, β-blockade should be of most use in the presence of ongoing pain,  $^{16}$  inappropriate tachycardia, hypertension, or ventricular rhythm instability. In the COMMIT trial, early intravenous

metoprolol given to more than Asiatic patients, about half of whom were treated by lytic agents and without primary percutaneous coronary intervention, followed by oral dosing, led to 5 fewer reinfarctions and 5 fewer ventricular fibrillations per 1000 treated. 18 The cost was increased cardiogenic shock, heart failure, persistent hypotension, and bradycardia (in total, 88 serious adverse events). In the United States, metoprolol and atenolol are the only β-blockers licensed for intravenous use in AMI. Overall, however, no convincing data emerge for routine early intravenous β-blockade. 19 With selected and carefully monitored exceptions, it is simpler to introduce oral β-blockade later when the hemodynamic situation has stabilized. The current American College of Cardiology (ACC)-American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines recommend starting half-dose oral β-blockade on day 2 (assuming hemodynamic stability) followed by dose increase to the full or the maximum tolerated dose, followed by long-term postinfarct β-blockade.<sup>20</sup>

**Postinfarction secondary prevention.** Administer β-blockade for all postinfarct patients with an ejection fraction (EF) of 40% or less unless contraindicated, with use limited to carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, or bisoprolol, which reduce mortality (Class 1, Level of Evidence A); administer  $\beta$ -blockade for 3 years in patients with normal LV function after AMI or ACS; (Class I, Level B). It is also reasonable to continue β-blockade beyond 3 years (Class IIa, Level B). 21

Benefits of postinfarct  $\beta$ -blockade. In the postinfarct phase,  $\beta$ blockade reduces mortality by 23% according to trial data<sup>22</sup> and by 35% to 40% in an observational study on a spectrum of patients including diabetics.<sup>23</sup> Timolol, propranolol, metoprolol, and atenolol are all effective and licensed for this purpose. Metoprolol has excellent long-term data.  $^{24}$  Carvedilol is the only  $\beta$ -blocker studied in the reperfusion era and in a population also receiving ACE inhibitors. 25 As the LV dysfunction was an entry point, the carvedilol dose was gradually uptitrated, and all-cause mortality was reduced. The mechanisms concerned are multiple and include decreased ventricular arrhythmias<sup>26</sup> and decreased reinfarction.<sup>27</sup> β-Blockers with partial agonist activity are relatively ineffective, perhaps because of the higher heart rates.

The only outstanding questions are whether low-risk patients really benefit from β-blockade (there is an increasing trend to omit β-blockade especially in patients with borderline hyperglycemic values); when to start (this is flexible and, as data for early β-blockade are not strong, <sup>22</sup> oral β-blocker may be started when the patient's condition allows, for example from 3 days onward<sup>25</sup> or even later at about 1 to 3 weeks); and how long β-blockade should be continued. Bearing in mind the risk of β-blockade withdrawal in patients with angina, many clinicians continue β-blockade administration for the long term once a seemingly successful result has been obtained. The benefit in high-risk groups such as older adults or those with low EFs increases progressively over 24 months.<sup>23</sup>

The *high-risk patients* who should benefit most are those often thought to have contraindications to β-blockade.<sup>23</sup> Although CHF was previously regarded as a contraindication to β-blockade, postinfarct patients with heart failure benefited more than others from βblockade.<sup>23</sup> Today this category of patient would be given a βblocker after treatment of fluid retention cautiously with gradually increasing doses of carvedilol, metoprolol, or bisoprolol. The SAVE trial<sup>27</sup> showed that ACE inhibitors and β-blockade are additive reducing postinfarct mortality, at least in patients with reduced EFs. The benefit of β-blockade when added to combination therapy with ACE inhibitors reduces mortality by 23% to 40%. <sup>23,25</sup> Concurrent therapy of CCBs or aspirin does not diminish the benefits of postinfarct β-blockade.

Despite all these strong arguments and numerous recommendations, β-blockers are still underused in postinfarct patients at the expense of many lives lost. In the long term, 42 patients have to be treated for 2 years to avoid one death, which compares favorably with other treatments. 22

# **Lack of Outcome Studies in Angina**

Solid evidence for a decrease in mortality in postinfarct follow-up achieved by β-blockade has led to the assumption that this type of treatment must also improve the outcome in effort angina or unstable angina. Regretfully, there are no convincing outcome studies to support this belief. In unstable angina, the short-term benefits of metoprolol were borderline.  $^{14}$  In effort angina, a meta-analysis of 90 studies showed that  $\beta$ -blockers and CCBs had equal efficacy and safety, but that β-blockers were better tolerated<sup>28</sup> probably because of short-acting nifedipine capsules, which were then often used. In angina plus hypertension, direct comparison has favored the CCB verapamil (see next section).

# Other Cardiac Indications for $\beta$ -Blockers

While this chapter addresses the specific role of \(\beta\)-blockers in patients with ischemic heart disease only, there are other established uses for β-blocker therapy, which include hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, the treatment of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) with high-dose β-blockers to prevent exercise-induced VT; in *mitral stenosis with sinus rhythm*, where \(\beta\)-blockade benefits patients by decreasing resting and

exercise heart rates; in mitral valve prolapse, where  $\beta$ -blockade is the standard procedure for control of associated arrhythmias, and in both dissecting aortic aneurysms; and in Marfan syndrome with aortic root involvement, where β-blockade has an important role in reducing the rate of pressure rise within the left ventricle (dp/dt) and the shear stress imposed on the proximal aortic wall.

These conditions will be referenced and discussed in other sections of this book.

# Noncardiac Indications for β-Blockade

**Stroke.** In an early trial the nonselective blocker propranolol was only modestly beneficial in reducing stroke (although ineffective in reducing coronary artery disease [CAD]). <sup>29</sup> The  $\beta_1$  selective agents are more effective in stroke reduction. <sup>30</sup>

Vascular and noncardiac surgery. B-blockade exerts an important protective effect in selected patients. Perioperative death from cardiac causes and MI were reduced by bisoprolol in high-risk patients undergoing vascular surgery.<sup>31</sup> A risk-based approach to noncardiac surgery is proposed by a very large observational study on patients. In those at no or very low cardiac risk, β-blockers were without benefit and in fact were associated with more adverse events, including mortality. In those at very high cardiac risk, mortality decreased by 42%, with a number needed to treat of only 33.32 Thus risk factor assessment is vital (see original article for revised cardiac risk index). In patients undergoing vascular surgery but otherwise not at very high risk, perioperative metoprolol gave no benefit yet increased intraoperative bradycardia and hypotension.<sup>33</sup>

**Impact of POISE study.** In the major prospective PeriOperative ISchemic Evaluation (POISE) study on a total of 8351 patients, perioperative slow-release metoprolol decreased the incidence of nonfatal MI from 5.1% to 3.6% (P < 0.001), yet increased total perioperative mortality from 2.3% to 3.1% (P < 0.05), with increased stroke rates and markedly increased significant hypotension and bradycardia. Thus, routine perioperative inception of metoprolol therapy is not justified. As metoprolol exerts markedly heterogenous cardiovascular effects according to metabolic genotype, involving subtypes of CYP450 2D6,<sup>5</sup> genetic differences may have accounted for part of the adverse cardiovascular findings in POISE and another study.<sup>33</sup>

In an important focused update given by ACC-AHA, 34 the major recommendations are the following: Class I indication for perioperative β-blocker use in patients already taking the drug; Class Ila recommendations for patients with inducible ischemia, coronary artery disease, or multiple clinical risk factors who are undergoing vascular (i.e. high-risk) surgery and for patients with CAD or multiple clinical risk factors who are undergoing intermediate-risk surgery; Initiation of therapy, particularly in lower-risk groups, requires careful consideration of the risk/benefit ratio; If initiation is selected, it should be started well before the planned procedure with careful perioperative titration to achieve adequate heart rate control while avoiding frank bradycardia or hypotension. In light of the POISE results, routine administration of perioperative β-blockers, particularly in higher fixed-dose regimens begun on the day of surgery, cannot be advocated.

Thyrotoxicosis. Together with antithyroid drugs or radioiodine, or as the sole agent before surgery, β-blockade is commonly used in thyrotoxicosis to control symptoms, although the hypermetabolic state is not decreased. β-blockade controls tachycardia, palpitations, tremor, and nervousness and reduces the vascularity of the thyroid gland, thereby facilitating operation. In thyroid storm, intravenous propranolol IV in slow 1–2 mg boluses may be repeated every 10–15 min until the desired effect is achieved. Alternatively, esmolol, 500 micrograms/Kg IV bolus, followed by 50–200 micrograms/Kg/min for maintenance may be administered; circulatory collapse is a risk, so that βblockade should only be used in thyroid storm if LV function is normal as shown by conventional noninvasive tests.

Anxiety states. Although propranolol is most widely used in anxiety (and is licensed for this purpose in several countries, including the United States), probably all β-blockers are effective, acting not centrally but by a reduction of peripheral manifestations of anxiety such as tremor and tachycardia.

Glaucoma. The use of local β-blocker eye solutions is now established for open-angle glaucoma; care needs to be exerted with occasional systemic side effects such as sexual dysfunction, bronchospasm, and cardiac depression. Among the agents approved for treatment of glaucoma in the United States are the nonselective agents timolol (Timoptic), carteolol, levobunolol, and metipranolol. The cardioselective betaxolol may be an advantage in avoiding side effects in patients with bronchospasm.

Migraine. Propranolol (80 to 240 mg daily, licensed in the United States) acts prophylactically to reduce the incidence of migraine attacks in 60% of patients. The mechanism is presumably by beneficial vasoconstriction. The antimigraine effect is prophylactic and not for attacks once they have occurred. If there is no benefit within 4 to 6 weeks, the drug should be discontinued.

Esophageal varices. β-blockade has been thought to prevent bleeding by reducing portal pressure. No benefit was found in a randomized study.<sup>35</sup>

# **Pharmacologic Properties of Various β-Blockers**

**β-blocker** "generations." First-generation nonselective agents, such as propranolol, block all the β-receptors (both  $β_1$  and  $β_2$ ). Second-generation cardioselective agents, such as atenolol, metoprolol. acebutolol, bisoprolol, and others, have relative selectivity for the  $\beta_1$  (largely cardiac) receptors when given in low doses (Fig. 1.10). Third-generation vasodilatory agents have added properties (Fig. 1.2), acting chiefly through two mechanisms: first, direct vasodilation, possibly mediated by release of nitric oxide as for carvedilol (see Fig. 1.2) and nebivolol<sup>3</sup>; and, second, added

# **β<sub>1</sub> VS β<sub>2</sub> SELECTIVITY** Bradycardia Negative inotropy β₁-SELECTIVE Less bronchospasm Metabolic effects Fewer peripheral effects Circulatory Similar cardiac and antihypertensive effects NON-SELECTIVE $(\beta_1 \quad \beta_2)$ More marked pulmonary and peripheral effects

Fig. 1.10  $\beta_1$ - versus  $\beta_2$ -cardioselectivity. In general, note several advantages of cardioselective β-blockers (exception: heart failure). Cardioselectivity is greatest at low drug doses. (Figure © L. H. Opie, 2012.)

α-adrenergic blockade, as in labetalol and carvedilol. A third vasodilatory mechanism, as in pindolol and acebutolol, acts via β2-ISA, which stimulates arterioles to relax. Acebutolol is a cardioselective agent with less ISA than pindolol that was very well tolerated in a 4-year antihypertensive study.<sup>36</sup>

Nonselective agents (combined β1-β2-blockers). The prototype β-blocker is propranolol, which is still often used worldwide and is a World Health Organization essential drug. By blocking β1-receptors, it affects heart rate, conduction, and contractility, yet by blocking β2-receptors, it tends to cause smooth muscle contraction with risk of bronchospasm in predisposed individuals. This same quality might, however, explain the benefit in migraine when vasoconstriction could inhibit the attack. Among the nonselective blockers, nadolol and sotalol are much longer acting and lipid insoluble.

Combined β1–β2–α-blockers. Carvedilol is very well supported for preferential use in heart failure, in which this combination of receptor blockade should theoretically be ideal, as shown by better outcomes than with metoprolol in the COMET study.<sup>37</sup>

Cardioselective agents (β1-selectivity). Cardioselective agents (acebutolol, atenolol, betaxolol, bisoprolol, celiprolol, and metoprolol) exert antihypertensive effects equally to the nonselective ones (see Fig. 1.10). Selective agents are preferable in patients with chronic lung disease or chronic smoking, insulin-requiring diabetes mellitus, and in stroke prevention.<sup>30</sup> Cardioselectivity varies among agents but is always greater at lower doses. Bisoprolol is among the most selective. Cardioselectivity declines or is lost at high doses. No β-blocker is completely safe in the presence of asthma; low-dose cardioselective agents can be used with care in patients with bronchospasm or chronic lung disease or chronic smoking. In angina and hypertension, cardioselective agents are just as effective as noncardioselective agents. In acute MI complicated by stressinduced hypokalemia, nonselective blockers theoretically should be better antiarrhythmics than β1-selective blockers.

Vasodilating β-blockers. Carvedilol and nebivolol are the prototypes (see Fig. 1.2). These agents could have added value in the therapy of hypertension by achieving vasodilation and, in the case of nebivolol, better reduction of LVH is claimed.<sup>38</sup>

Antiarrhythmic β-blockers. All β-blockers are potentially antiarrhythmic by virtue of Class II activity (see Fig. 1.11). Sotalol is a unique β-blocker with prominent added Class III antiarrhythmic activity (see Fig. 1.11; Chapter 9) and will be discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

# Specific β-Blockers Used in Clinical Practice

Of the large number of β-blockers, the ideal agent for hypertension or angina might have advantageous pharmacokinetics (simplicity, agents not metabolized in liver); a high degree of cardioselectivity (bisoprolol); long duration of action (several); and a favorable metabolic profile, especially when associated with vasodilatory properties (carvedilol and nebivolol).

Propranolol. (Inderal) is the historical gold standard because it is approved for so many different indications, including angina, acute MI, postinfarction secondary prevention, hypertension, arrhythmias, migraine prophylaxis, anxiety states, and essential tremor. However, propranolol is not β1-selective. Being lipid soluble, it has a high brain penetration and undergoes extensive hepatic first-pass metabolism. Central side effects may explain its poor performance in quality-of-life studies. Propranolol also has a short halflife so that it must be given twice daily unless long-acting preparations are used. The other β-blockers agents are described below alphabetically:

Acebutolol. (Sectral) is the cardioselective agent with ISA that gave a good quality of life in the 4-year TOMH study in mild hypertension. In particular, the incidence of impotence was not increased.39

Atenolol. (Tenormin) was one of the first of the cardioselective agents and now in generic form is one of the most widely used drugs in angina, in postinfarction secondary prevention, and in hypertension. However, its use as first-line agent in hypertension is falling into disfavor,<sup>40</sup> with poor outcomes, including increased all-cause mortality when compared with the CCB amlodipine in ASCOT.<sup>41</sup> There are very few trials with outcome data for atenolol in other conditions, with two exceptions: the ASIST study in silent ischemia<sup>11</sup> and INVEST in hypertensives with coronary artery disease. Here atenolol had equality of major clinical outcomes with verapamil at the cost of more episodes of angina, more new diabetes, and more psychological depression.42,43 Note that atenolol was often combined with a diuretic and verapamil with an ACE inhibitor. In the British Medical Research Council trial of hypertension in older adults, atenolol did not reduce coronary events.29 More recently, in the LIFE Trial, atenolol was inferior to the ARB losartan in the therapy of hypertensives with LVH.44

Bisoprolol. (Zebeta in the United States, Cardicor or Emcor in the United Kingdom) is a highly β1-selective agent, more so than atenolol, licensed for hypertension, angina heart failure in the United Kingdom, but only for hypertension in the United States. It was the drug used in the large and successful CIBIS-2 study in heart failure, in which there was a large reduction not only in total mortality but also in sudden death. 45 In CIBIS-3, bisoprolol compared well with enalapril as first-line agent in heart failure. 46 A combination of low-dose bisoprolol and low-dose hydrochlorothiazide (Ziac) is available in the United States (see Combination Therapy, p. 13).

Carvedilol. (Coreg in the United States, Eucardic in the United Kingdom) is a nonselective vasodilator α-β-blocker with multimechanism vasodilatory properties mediated by antioxidant activity, formation of nitric oxide, stimulation  $\beta$ -arrestin-MAP-kinase<sup>47</sup> and  $\alpha$ -receptors, that has been extensively studied in CHF<sup>48</sup> and in postinfarct LV dysfunction. 25 Metabolically, carvedilol may increase insulin sensitivity. 49 In the United States, it is registered for hypertension, for CHF (mild to severe), and for post-MILV dysfunction ( $EF \le 40\%$ ), but not for angina.

**Labetalol.** (Trandate, Normodyne) is a combined  $\alpha$ - and β-blocking antihypertensive agent that has now largely been supplanted by carvedilol except for acute intravenous use as in hypertensive crises (see Table 1.4).

**Metoprolol.** (Toprol-XL) is cardioselective and particularly well studied in AMI and in postinfarct protection. Toprol-XL is approved in the United States for stable symptomatic Class 2 or 3 heart failure.<sup>50</sup> It is also registered for hypertension and angina. *Lopressor*, shorter acting, is licensed for angina and MI.

**Nadolol.** (Corgard) is very long acting and water soluble, although it is nonselective. It is particularly useful when prolonged antianginal activity is required.

**Nebivolol.** (Nebilet in the United Kingdom, Bystolic in the United States) is a highly cardioselective agent with peripheral vasodilating properties mediated by nitric oxide.<sup>38</sup> Hepatic metabolites probably account for the vasodilation<sup>51</sup> and the long biological half-life. <sup>52</sup> Nebivolol reverses endothelial dysfunction in hypertension, which may explain its use for erectile dysfunction in hypertensives.<sup>53</sup> There are also metabolic benefits. In a 6-month study, nebivolol, in contrast to atenolol and at equal BP levels. increased insulin sensitivity and adiponectin levels in hypertensives.<sup>54</sup> Nebivolol given in the SENIORS trial to older adult patients with a history of heart failure or an EF of 35% or less reduced the primary composite end-point of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations, also increasing the EF and reducing heart size.55

Penbutolol. (Levatol) has a modest ISA, similar to acebutolol, but is nonselective. It is highly lipid soluble and is metabolized by the liver.

**Sotalol.** (Betapace, Betapace AF) is a unique nonselective β-blocker that has Class 3 antiarrhythmic activity. It is licensed for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias as Betapace, and now also as Betapace AF for maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Sotalol is a water-soluble drug, excreted only by the kidneys, so that Betapace AF is contraindicated in patients with a creatinine clearance of less than 40 mL/min.

**Timolol.** (Blocarden) was the first β-blocker shown to give postinfarct protection and it is one of the few licensed for this purpose in the United States. Other approved uses are for hypertension and in migraine prophylaxis.

# **Ultrashort-Acting Intravenous β-Blockade**

**Esmolol.** (Brevibloc) is an ultrashort-acting  $\beta_1$ -blocker with a halflife of 9 minutes, rapidly converting to inactive metabolites by blood esterases. Full recovery from β-blockade occurs within 30 minutes in patients with a normal cardiovascular system. *Indications* are situations in which on-off control of \beta-blockade is desired, as in SVT in the perioperative period, or sinus tachycardia (noncompensatory), or emergency hypertension in the perioperative period (all registered uses in the United States). Other logical indications are emergency hypertension (pheochromocytoma excluded) or in unstable angina. <sup>56</sup> Doses are as follows: For SVT, loading by 500 µg/kg/min over 1 minute, followed by a 4-minute infusion of 50 µg/kg/min (US package insert). If this fails, repeat loading dose and increase infusion to 100 µg/kg/min (over 4 minutes). If this fails, repeat loading dose and then infuse at rates up to 300 µg/kg/min. Thereafter, to maintain control, infuse at adjusted rate for up to 24 hours. For urgent perioperative hypertension, give 80 mg (approximately 1 mg/kg) over 30 seconds and infuse at 150 to 300 µg/kg/min if needed. For more gradual control of BP, follow routine for SVT. Higher doses are usually required for BP control than for arrhythmias. After the emergency, replace with conventional antiarrhythmic or antihypertensive drugs. For older adult patients with non-ST-elevation MI requiring acute β-blockade despite symptoms of heart failure, a cautious infusion of 50–200 µg/kg/min may be tried.<sup>57</sup> Cautions include extravasation of the acid solution with risk of skin necrosis.

# Concomitant Diseases and Choice of **β-Blocker**

**Respiratory disease.** Cardioselective β<sub>1</sub>-blockers in low doses are best for patients with reversible bronchospasm. In patients with a history of asthma, no β-blocker can be considered safe.

Associated cardiovascular disease. For hypertension plus effort angina, see "β-blockers for hypertension" earlier in this chapter. In patients with sick sinus syndrome, pure β-blockade can be dangerous. β-blockers with ISA may be best. In patients with Raynaud phenomenon, propranolol with its peripheral vasoconstrictive effects is best avoided. In active peripheral vascular disease, β-blockers are generally contraindicated, although the evidence is not firm.

Renal disease. The logical choice should be a β-blocker eliminated by the liver rather than the kidney (see Fig. 1.7). Of those, the vasodilating β-blocker nebivolol conserved the estimated glomerular filtration rate in patients with heart failure better than did metoprolol.<sup>58</sup>

Diabetes mellitus. In diabetes mellitus, the risk of β-blockade in insulin-requiring diabetics is that the premonitory symptoms of hypoglycemia might be masked. There is a lesser risk with the cardioselective agents. In type 2 diabetics with hypertension, initial β-blocker therapy by atenolol was as effective as the ACE inhibitor, captopril, in reducing macrovascular endpoints at the cost of weight gain and more antidiabetic medication. 59 Whether diabetic nephropathy benefits as much from treatment with β-blockade is not clear. ARBs and ACE inhibitors have now established themselves as agents of first choice in diabetic nephropathy. Carvedilol combined with renin angiotensin system (RAS) blocker therapy in diabetic patients with hypertension results in better glycemic control and less insulin resistance than combination therapy that includes metoprolol.<sup>60</sup> Although better glycemic control should theoretically translate into fewer cardiovascular events and other adverse outcomes, the short-term nature of this study does not allow conclusions on outcomes.

Those at risk of new diabetes. The use of  $\beta$ -blockers and diuretics poses a risk of new diabetes, <sup>61</sup> which should be lessened by a truly low dose of the diuretic or by using another combination. Regular blood glucose checks are desirable.

# Side Effects of β-Blockers

The four major mechanisms for  $\beta$ -blocker side effects are smooth muscle spasm (bronchospasm and cold extremities), exaggeration of the cardiac therapeutic actions (bradycardia, heart block, excess negative inotropic effect), central nervous system penetration (insomnia, depression), and adverse metabolic side effects. The mechanism of fatigue is not clear. When compared with propranolol, however, it is reduced by use of either a cardioselective

β-blocker or a vasodilatory agent, so that both central and peripheral hemodynamic effects may be involved. When patients are appropriately selected, double-blind studies show no differences between a cardioselective agent such as atenolol and placebo. This may be because atenolol is not lipid soluble and should have lesser effects on bronchial and vascular smooth muscle than propranolol. When propranolol is given for hypertension, the rate of serious side effects (bronchospasm, cold extremities, worsening of claudication) leading to withdrawal of therapy is approximately 10%. 62 The rate of withdrawal with atenolol is considerably lower (approximately 2%), but when it comes to dose-limiting side effects, both agents can cause cold extremities, fatigue, dreams, worsening claudication, and bronchospasm. Increasing heart failure remains a potential hazard when β-blockade therapy is abruptly started at normal doses in a susceptible patient and not tailored in.

Central side effects. An attractive hypothesis is that the lipidsoluble β-blockers (epitomized by propranolol) with their high brain penetration are more likely to cause central side effects. An extremely detailed comparison of propranolol and atenolol showed that the latter, which is not lipid soluble, causes far fewer central side effects than does propranolol. However, depression remains an atenolol risk. <sup>64</sup> The lipid-solubility hypothesis also does not explain why metoprolol, which is moderately lipid soluble, appears to interfere less with some complex psychological functions than does atenolol and may even enhance certain aspects of psychological performance.<sup>65</sup>

Quality of life and libido. In the first quality-of-life study reported in patients with hypertension, propranolol induced considerably more central effects than did the ACE inhibitor captopril. 66 More modern β-blockers, with different fundamental properties, all leave the quality of life largely intact in hypertensives. However, there are a number of negatives. First, weight gain is undesirable and contrary to the lifestyle pattern required to limit cardiovascular diseases, including the metabolic syndrome and hypertension. Second, β-blockade may precipitate *diabetes*, <sup>67</sup> a disease that severely limits the quality of life. Third, during exercise, β-blockade reduces the total work possible by approximately 15% and increases the sense of fatigue. Vasodilatory β-blockers may be exceptions but lack outcome studies in hypertension. *Erectile dysfunction* is an age-dependent complication of β-blockade. In a large group with mean age 48 years, erectile problems took place in 11% given a β-blocker, compared with 26% with a diuretic and 3% with placebo.<sup>68</sup> β-blockers have consistently impaired sexual intercourse more than an ACE inhibitor or ARB, the latter improving sexual output. 69 Changing to nebivolol may improve erections. 53 Sildenafil (Viagra) or similar agents should also

help, but are relatively contraindicated if the β-blocker is used for angina (because of the adverse interaction with nitrates, almost always used in those with angina).

Adverse metabolic side effects and new-onset diabetes. The capacity of β-blockers to increase new diabetes, whether given for hypertension or postinfarct,<sup>61</sup> comes at a time when diabetes is increasingly recognized as major cardiovascular hazard (see Chapter 4). A wise precaution is to obtain fasting blood glucose levels and, if indicated, a glucose tolerance curve before the onset of chronic β-blockade and at annual intervals during therapy. Note that the vasodilatory β-blockers carvedilol and nebivolol both promote formation of nitric oxide and both have a better metabolic profile than comparator cardioselective agents, without, however, long-term outcome data in hypertension (see "Specific β-Blockers" later in this chapter, see also Fig. 1.2).

β-blockade withdrawal. Chronic β-blockade increases β-receptor density. When β-blockers are suddenly withdrawn, angina may be exacerbated, sometimes resulting in MI. Treatment of the withdrawal syndrome is by reintroduction of β-blockade. Best therapy is to avoid this condition by gradual withdrawal.

# Contraindications to β-Blockade

The absolute contraindications to β-blockade can be deduced from the profile of pharmacologic effects and side effects (Table 1.5). Cardiac absolute contraindications include severe bradycardia, preexisting high-degree heart block, sick sinus syndrome, and overt LV failure unless already conventionally treated and stable (Fig. 1.12). Pulmonary contraindications are overt asthma or severe bronchospasm; depending on the severity of the disease and the cardioselectivity of the β-blocker used, these may be absolute or relative contraindications. The central nervous system contraindication is severe depression (especially for propranolol). Active peripheral vascular disease with rest ischemia is another contraindication. The metabolic syndrome suggests caution.

# Overdose of β-Blockers

Bradycardia may be countered by intravenous atropine 1 to 2 mg; if serious, temporary transvenous pacing may be required. When an infusion is required, glucagon (2.5 to 7.5 mg/h) is logical because it stimulates formation of cAMP by bypassing the occupied β-receptor. However, evidence is only anecdotal.<sup>70</sup> Logically an infusion of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, such as amrinone or milrinone, should

# β-Blockade: contraindications and cautions

(Note: cautions may be overridden by the imperative to treat, as in postinfarct patients)

#### Cardiac

Absolute: Severe bradycardia, high-degree heart block, cardiogenic shock, overt untreated left ventricular failure (versus major use in early or stabilized heart failure).

Relative: Prinzmetal's angina (unopposed α-spasm), high doses of other agents depressing SA or AV nodes (verapamil, diltiazem, digoxin, antiarrhythmic agents); in angina, avoid sudden withdrawal.

#### Pulmonary

Absolute: Severe asthma or bronchospasm. Must question for past or present asthma. Risk of fatalities.

Relative: Mild asthma or bronchospasm or chronic airways disease. Use agents with cardioselectivity plus β2-stimulants (by inhalation).

### Central Nervous

Absolute: Severe depression (especially avoid propranolol).

Relative: Vivid dreams: avoid highly lipid-soluble agents (see Fig. 1.7) and pindolol; avoid evening dose. Visual hallucinations: change from propranolol. Fatigue (all agents). If low cardiac output is cause of fatigue, try vasodilatory β-blockers. Erectile dysfunction may occur (check for diuretic use; consider change to nebivolol and/or ACE inhibitor/ARB). Psychotropic drugs (with adrenergic augmentation) may adversely interact.

#### Peripheral Vascular, Raynaud Phenomenon

Absolute: Active disease: gangrene, skin necrosis, severe or worsening claudication, rest pain.

Relative: Cold extremities, absent pulses, Raynaud phenomenon. Avoid nonselective agents (propranolol, sotalol, nadolol); prefer vasodilatory agents.

#### Diabetes Mellitus

Relative: Insulin-requiring diabetes: nonselective agents decrease reaction to hypoglycemia; use selective agents. Note successful use of atenolol in type 2 diabetes in prolonged UK trial at cost of weight gain and more antidiabetic drug usage.

#### Metabolic Syndrome or Prediabetes

β-blockers may increase blood sugar by 1–1.5 mmol/L and impair insulin sensitivity especially with diuretic cotherapy; consider use of carvedilol or nebivolol.

Continued on following page

#### Table 1.5

# β-Blockade: contraindications and cautions (Continued)

#### Renal Failure

Relative: As renal blood flow falls, reduce doses of agents eliminated by kidney (see Fig. 1.7).

#### Liver Disease

Relative: Avoid agents with high hepatic clearance (propranolol, carvedilol, timolol, acebutolol, metoprolol). Use agents with low clearance (atenolol, nadolol, sotalol). See Fig 1.7. If plasma proteins low, reduce dose of highly bound agents (propranolol, pindolol, bisoprolol).

#### Pregnancy Hypertension

β-blockade increasingly used but may depress vital signs in neonate and cause uterine vasoconstriction. Labetalol and atenolol best tested. Preferred drug: methyldopa.

#### Surgical Operations

β-blockade may be maintained throughout, provided indication is not trivial; otherwise stop 24 to 48 hours beforehand. May protect against anesthetic arrhythmias and perioperative ischemia. Preferred intravenous drug: esmolol. Use atropine for bradycardia, β-agonist for severe hypotension.

#### Age

β-blockade often helps to reduce BP but lacks positive outcome data. Watch pharmacokinetics and side effects in all older adult patients.

#### Smoking

In hypertension, β-blockade is less effective in reducing coronary events in smoking men.

## Hyperlipidemia

β-blockers may have unfavorable effects on the blood lipid profile, especially nonselective agents. Triglycerides increase and HDLcholesterol falls. Clinical significance unknown but may worsen metabolic syndrome. Vasodilatory agents, with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity or α-blocking activity, may have mildly favorable effects.

help cAMP to accumulate. Alternatively, dobutamine is given in doses high enough to overcome the competitive β-blockade (15 μg/kg/min). In patients without ischemic heart disease, an infusion (up to 0.10 μg/kg/min) of isoproterenol may be used.

# Summary

- 1. Clinical conditions for which β-blockers are beneficial. β-blockers still come closest to providing all-purpose cardiovascular therapy with the conspicuous absence of any benefit for lipid problems. Approved indications include angina, hypertension, AMI, postinfarct follow-up, arrhythmias, and now heart failure. Data for postinfarct protection and for mortality reduction in CHF are particularly impressive. Other data are less compelling (Table 1.6).
- 2. In heart failure, solid data support the essential and earlier use of β-blockers in stable systolic heart failure, to counter the excessive adrenergic drive. Only three agents have been studied in detail, namely carvedilol, metoprolol, and bisoprolol, of which only the first two are approved for heart failure in the United States. In older adults, nebivolol improved EF in systolic but not diastolic heart failure. Following the recommended protocol with slow, incremental doses of the chosen agent is essential.

- 3. For coronary heart disease, \u03b3-blockade is very effective symptomatic treatment, alone or combined with other drugs, in 70% to 80% of patients with classic effort angina. However, atenolol-based therapy was no better at lessening major outcomes than verapamil-based therapy, and worse for some minor outcomes. β-blockers are part of the essential postinfarct protection armamentarium. For ACSs, indirect evidence suggests a quadruple follow-up regime of aspirin, statin, ACE inhibitor, and β-blockade, but there are no compelling outcome trials. Overall, there is no clinical evidence that β-blockers slow the development of coronary artery disease.
- 4. *In hypertension* β-blockers have lost their prime position, although they reduce the BP effectively in 50% to 70% of those with mild to moderate hypertension. The crucial study showed that for equal brachial pressures, the aortic pressure was less reduced with atenolol than with the CCB amlodipine, which could explain why β-blockers reduce stroke less than several other agents. Older adults with hypertension, especially those of the black ethnic group, respond less well to β-blocker monotherapy. The previously recommended combination of β-blockers and diuretics may provoke new diabetes, with lesser risk if the diuretic dose is truly low.
- 5. *In arrhythmias* β-blockers are among the more effective ventricular antiarrhythmics.
- 6. Metabolic side effects, including new diabetes, may be important to monitor. β-blockers can be diabetogenic even without

diuretics. The vasodilatory β-blockers carvedilol and nebivolol appear to be exceptions and have outcome studies only in heart failure.

- 7. Is there still a role for propranolol? There is no particular advantage for this original "gold standard" drug, with its poor quality-of-life outcomes, unless hypertension or angina with some other condition in which experience with propranolol is greater than with other β-blockers (e.g., POTS, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, migraine prophylaxis, anxiety, or essential tremor).
- 8. Other β-blockers are increasingly used because of specific attractive properties: cardioselectivity (acebutolol, atenolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol), vasodilatory capacity and possible metabolic superiority (carvedilol and nebivolol), positive data in heart failure (carvedilol, metoprolol, bisoprolol, nebivolol), or postinfarct protection (metoprolol, carvedilol, timolol), lipid insolubility and no hepatic metabolism (atenolol, nadolol, sotalol), long action (nadolol) or long-acting formulations, ISA in selected patients to help avoid bradycardia (pindolol, acebutolol), and well-studied antiarrhythmic properties (sotalol). Esmolol is the best agent for intravenous use in the perioperative period because of its extremely short half-life.
- 9. Evidence-based use supports the use of those agents established in large randomized trials because of the known doses and clearly expected clinical benefits. For example, for postinfarct protection propranolol, metoprolol, carvedilol, and timolol are the best studied, of which only carvedilol has been studied in the reperfusion era. For stabilized heart failure, carvedilol, metoprolol, and bisoprolol have impressive data from large trials. Carvedilol especially merits attention, being licensed for a wide clinical range, from hypertension to LV dysfunction to severe heart failure, and having best trial data in heart failure. For arrhythmias, sotalol with its class 3 properties stands out.

# Nitrates and Newer (or Nontraditional) Antianginals

# Introduction

This section focuses on the antianginal effects of nitrates, one of three major classes of traditional antianginal agents, including β-blockers and CCBs (Fig. 1.13), as well as an expanding fourth

![](_page_39_Figure_3.jpeg)

Fig. 1.13 Proposed antianginal mechanisms for the major four classes of antianginal agents: nitrates, β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and metabolic agents (for details of metabolic agents, see Fig. 2.7). SA, Sinoatrial. (Figure © L. H. Opie, 2012.)

class of novel antianginals that act principally by reducing late inward sodium current (ranolazine), by metabolic modulation without major hemodynamic effects (trimetazidine), or by inhibition of the sinus node (ivabradine). Mechanistically, nitrates and CCBs are coronary vasodilators, with nitrates also reducing preload and CCBs afterload while β-blockers reduce oxygen demand by slowing heart and imparting a negative inotropic effect.

This section reviews the organic nitrates, including both their antianginals effects and other hemodynamic effects, and more novel agents with diverse antianginal properties, which include ranolazine, ivabradine, and trimetazidine. It is important to emphasize that the treatment and prophylaxis of angina to ameliorate symptoms is but one component of a more encompassing overall management strategy that includes proven "disease-modifying" therapies such as aspirin, P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors, statins, inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors and ARBs), statins, and other dyslipidemic agents (ezetimibe, icosapent ethyl) in addition to treatment of symptomatic myocardial ischemia.

# **Mechanisms of Action of Nitrates in Angina** and Heart Failure

Nitrates provide an exogenous source of vasodilator nitric oxide (NO', usually given as NO), a very short-lived free radical, thereby inducing coronary vasodilation even when endogenous production of NO' is impaired by CAD. Thus, nitrates act differently from the other classes of antianginals (see Fig. 1.13). Chronic nitrate use may produce tolerance, which can be a significant clinical problem. The main treatment strategy is to minimize or prevent the development of tolerance, with the major emphasis on the adverse role of excess NO that produces harmful peroxynitrite. 71 The thrust of basic work has shifted to endogenously produced NO as a ubiquitous physiologic messenger, as described by Ignarro, Furchgott, and Murad, 72 the winners of the 1998 Nobel Prize for Medicine. Although endogenously produced NO has many functions (such as a role in vagal neurotransmission) quite different from the NO derived from exogenous nitrates, there are important shared vasodilatory effects.

Coronary and peripheral vasodilatory effects. A distinction must be made between antianginal and coronary vasodilator properties. Nitrates preferentially dilate large coronary arteries and arterioles greater than 100 mm in diameter to redistribute blood flow along collateral channels and from epicardial to endocardial regions and relieve coronary vasospasm and dynamic epicardial stenosis, including the coronary arterial constriction that may be induced by exercise and thereby relieving exercise-induced myocardial ischemia. Thus, nitrates are effective in dilating epicardial coronary arteries and reducing coronary vascular resistance, which, in turn, promotes augmented coronary flow to ischemic myocardium, in contrast to more potent arterial dilators such as dipyridamole and other vasodilators (such as nifedipine) that act more distally in the arterial tree and which pose the risk of diverting nutritive coronary blood away from ischemic myocardium to nonischemic myocardium, which may induce a "coronary steal" phenomenon.

The additional peripheral hemodynamic effects of nitrates, originally observed by Lauder Brunton, 74 also cannot be ignored in that nitrates do reduce both afterload and preload of the heart (Fig. 1.14).

# ACTION OF NITRATES ON CIRCUI ATION

![](_page_41_Figure_3.jpeg)

Fig. 1.14 Schematic diagram of effects of nitrate on the circulation. The major effect is on the venous capacitance vessels with additional coronary and peripheral arteriolar vasodilatory benefits. (Figure © L. H. Opie, 2012.)

**Reduction in myocardial oxygen demand.** Nitrates increase the venous capacitance, causing pooling of blood in the peripheral veins and thereby a reduction in venous return and in ventricular volume. There is less mechanical stress on the myocardium and this corresponding reduction in LV wall tension decreases myocardial oxygen demand. In addition, a modest fall in the aortic systolic pressure also reduces the oxygen demand.

**Endothelium and vascular mechanisms.** The fundamental mechanism of nitrate biological effect is the enzyme-mediated release of highly unstable NO from the nitrate molecule (Fig. 1.15). 75 An intact vascular endothelium is required for the vasodilatory effects of some vascular active agents (thus acetylcholine physiologically vasodilates but constricts when the endothelium is damaged). Nitrates vasodilate whether or not the endothelium is physically intact or functional. Prolonged nitrate therapy with formation of peroxynitrite may, however, inhibit endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS), which is one of several postulated

# **NITRATE MECHANISMS**

![](_page_42_Figure_3.jpeg)

Fig. 1.15 Effects of nitrates in generating nitric oxide (NO) and stimulating guanylate cyclase to cause vasodilation. Nitrate tolerance is multifactorial in origin, including the endothelial effects of peroxynitrite and superoxide that ultimately inhibit the conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP). Note that mononitrates bypass hepatic metabolism and the mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (mito ALDH) step required for bioactivation of nitroglycerin. Hence reduced or genetic lack of ALDH-2 may also be a cause of nitrate tolerance. Endo. endothelial; OONO, peroxynitrite, SH, sulfhydryl. (Figure © L. H. Opie, 2008.)

mechanisms of nitrate tolerance. Similarly, long-term use of longacting nitrates may cause endothelial dysfunction mediated by free radicals (see later, Fig. 1.16). Whether this problem extends to aggravation of preexisting endothelial dysfunction is uncertain. Thus, nitrate tolerance and endothelial dysfunction have partially shared pathogenetic mechanisms.

Nitrates, after entering the vessel wall, are bioconverted to release NO, which stimulates guanylate cyclase to produce cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP; see Fig. 1.15). In addition, NO acts potentially via direct S-nitrosylation of a number of proteins,

![](_page_43_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Fig. 1.16** The formation of peroxynitrite and the role of oxidases in the process. Excess nitrate administration leads to stimulation of the oxidase system. The end result is increased endothelial dysfunction. Angiotensin II stimulates the vascular smooth muscle (*VSM*) cells to form peroxynitrite. Some of the procedures that diminish these processes, leading to endothelial dysfunction, include administration of carvedilol (strong data), high doses of atorvastatin (human volunteer data), and the angiotensin receptor blocker telmisartan (experimental data). *NADPH*, Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; *NO*·, Nitric oxide; *OONO*, peroxynitrite; *ROS*, reactive oxygen species. (Figure © L. H. Opie, 2012.)

altering their physiologic properties via a posttranslational modification step. NO may also be "scavenged" by the superoxide  $(O_2^-)$  radical, generating peroxynitrate (ONOO<sup>-</sup>), which in high concentrations contributes to nitrate toxicity (Fig. 1.16) and the induction of nitrate tolerance. Conversely, low concentrations enhance the vasodilator effects of NO.

Overall the best-known mechanism linked to clinical practice is that calcium in the vascular myocyte falls, and vasodilation results (see Fig. 1.15). Sulfhydryl (SH) groups are required for such formation of NO and the stimulation of guanylate cyclase. Nitroglycerin powerfully dilates when injected into an artery, an effect that is probably limited in humans by reflex adrenergic-mediated vasoconstriction. Hence nitrates are better venous than arteriolar dilators, and there is an associated adrenergic reflex tachycardia  $^{77}$  that can be attenuated by concurrent  $\beta$ -blockade.

Effects of NO on myocardial relaxation and contractile proteins. NO has a fundamental role as a modulator of myocardial relaxation, mediated at least in part by cyclic GMP (see Fig. 1.15). <sup>78</sup> This effect is independent of the restoration of coronary blood flow that in turn can reverse ischemic diastolic dysfunction. Furthermore, NO improves diastolic function in human heart muscle where it acts on the contractile proteins by increasing troponin I phosphorylation of the springlike cytoskeletal protein titin.<sup>79</sup> In long-term therapy, NO donors may limit or reverse LV hypertrophy (LVH). 80 These studies raise the possibility that organic nitrates may exert a role in the management of systemic hypertension, in which LVH is a marker and modulator of long-term cardiovascular risk.

#### Pharmacokinetics of Nitrates

Bioavailability and half-lives. Because the various nitrate preparations differ so appreciably, each needs to be considered separately. As a group, nitrates are absorbed from the mucous membranes, the skin, and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The prototype agent, nitroglycerin, has pharmacokinetics that are not well understood. It rapidly disappears from the blood with a half-life of only a few minutes, largely by extrahepatic mechanisms that convert the parent molecule to longer-acting and active dinitrates. 81 Isosorbide dinitrate, on the other hand, must first be converted in the liver to active mononitrates (see Fig. 1.15) that have half-lives of approximately 4 to 6 hours with ultimate renal excretion. The mononitrates are completely bioavailable without any hepatic metabolism, with half-lives of 4–6 hours. Of the many nitrate preparations (Table 1.7), sublingual nitroglycerin remains the gold standard for acute anginal attacks.<sup>82</sup> In practice, patients are often also given long-acting nitrates, except that in order to avoid or minimize the likelihood of nitrate tolerance, it is important that physicians should prescribe a 6–10-hour nitrate free interval each day, though this approach does pose the possible risk of precipitating angina during the nitrate-free interval, which is often at night.<sup>82</sup>

# Short-Acting Nitrates for Acute Exertional Angina

Sublingual nitroglycerin is very well established in the initial therapy of exertional angina, yet may be ineffective, frequently because the patient has not received proper instruction or because of severe headaches. When angina starts, the patient should rest in

the sitting position (standing may promote syncope, while a recumbent position enhances venous return and increased work of the heart) and take sublingual nitroglycerin (0.3 to 0.6 mg) every 5 minutes until the discomfort abates. In general, it is not advised that patients consume more than three sublingual nitroglycerin tablets over 15 minutes; persistent rest angina unresponsive to multiple nitroglycerin tablets may presage an ACS or AMI, and should be regarded as a medical emergency. Nitroglycerin spray is an alternative mode of oral administration, which is more acceptable to some patients. It vasodilates sooner than does the tablet, which might be of special importance in those with dryness of the mouth.<sup>83</sup>

Isosorbide dinitrate may be given sublingually (5 mg) to abort an anginal attack and then exerts antianginal effects for approximately 1 hour. Because the dinitrate requires hepatic conversion to the mononitrate, the onset of antianginal action (mean time: 3.4 minutes) is slower than with nitroglycerin (mean time: 1.9 minutes), so that the manufacturers of the dinitrate compound recommend sublingual administration of this drug only if the patient is unresponsive to or intolerant of sublingual nitroglycerin. After oral ingestion, hemodynamic and antianginal effects persist for several hours. Single doses of isosorbide dinitrate confer longer protection against angina than can single doses of sublingual nitroglycerin (see Table 1.7).

# Short-Acting Nitrates for Angina Prophylaxis

While most physicians and patients regard sublingual nitroglycerin as an acute treatment intervention to abort an angina attack, it is important to emphasize that sublingual nitroglycerin or nitrolingual spray can also be used prophylactically to prevent an angina attack when there is a regular, predictable pattern of exertional angina that is elicited with a particular precipitant such as brisk walking up an incline or climbing a hill, exposure to cold, eating a large meal, etc. Patients can be encouraged to take a short-acting nitrate preparation several minutes prior to the onset of the expected offending activity in order to obtain a potentially therapeutic coronary vasodilatory effect.

# Long-Acting Nitrates for Angina Prophylaxis

As noted, long-acting nitrates are not continuously effective if regularly taken over a prolonged period, unless allowance is made for a nitrate-free or nitrate-low interval (Table 1.8). 8487 Worsening of endothelial dysfunction is a potential complication of long-acting nitrates that should be avoided, <sup>88</sup> and the common practice of routine use of long-acting nitrates for exertional angina<sup>7</sup> may have to be reevaluated.

Isosorbide dinitrate (oral preparation) is frequently given for the prophylaxis of angina. An important question is whether regular therapy with isosorbide dinitrate gives long-lasting protection (3–5 hours) against angina. In a crucial placebo-controlled study, exercise duration improved significantly for 6 to 8 hours after single oral doses of 15 to 120 mg isosorbide dinitrate, but for only 2 hours when the same doses were given repetitively four times daily.<sup>89</sup> Marked tolerance develops during sustained therapy, despite much higher plasma isosorbide dinitrate concentrations during sustained than during acute therapy. 89 While eccentric twice-daily treatment with extended-release isosorbide dinitrate (Tembids) 40 mg administered in the morning and 7 hours later was not superior to placebo in a large multicenter study, <sup>84</sup> such dosing schedules of isosorbide dinitrate are still often used in an effort to avoid tolerance.

Mononitrates have similar dosage and effects to those of isosorbide dinitrate. Nitrate tolerance, likewise a potential problem, can be prevented or minimized when rapid-release preparations (Monoket, Ismo) are given twice daily in an eccentric pattern with doses spaced by 7 hours.<sup>85</sup> Using the slow-release preparation (Imdur), the dose range 30–240 mg once daily was tested for antianginal activity. Only higher dose 120 and 240 mg daily improved exercise times at 4 and 12 hours after administration, even after

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>b</sup>No data for other doses. <sup>c</sup>Eur Heart J. 1989:10(Suppl. A):43-49.

42 days of daily use. <sup>86</sup> These high doses were reached by titration over 7 days. A daily dose of 60 mg, still often used, was ineffective.

Transdermal nitroglycerin patches are designed to permit the timed release of nitroglycerin over a 24-hour period. Despite initial claims of 24-hour efficacy, major studies have failed to show prolonged improvement, and nitrate tolerance is an issue with more continuous dosing.

# **Nitrates for Acute Coronary Syndromes**

Large trials have failed to show a consistent reduction in mortality in either unstable angina and non-ST elevation MI or in ST-elevation MI. Therefore, the goal of nitrate therapy is pain relief or management of associated acute heart failure or severe hypertension.

Intravenous nitroglycerin is widely regarded as being effective in the management of pain in patients with ACS, although without properly controlled trials. Nitroglycerin should be infused at an initial rate of 5 µg/min (or even 2.5 µg/min in patients with borderline hypotension), using nonadsorptive delivery systems. Although earlier studies used progressive uptitration of infusion rates to relief of pain (with eventual rates of >1000 µg/min in some patients), this strategy should be limited in general because of the risks of tolerance induction and subsequent "rebound." Given that even 10 µg/min nitroglycerin induces some degree of tolerance within 24 hours, an infusion rate of 10–50 µg/min is recommended in most cases. Nitrate patches and nitroglycerin ointment should not be used. Intravenous therapy, which can be titrated upward as needed, is far better for control of pain, and because of the short half-live of intravenous nitroglycerin, rapid downtitration is usually effective if BP decreases.

**Percutaneous coronary intervention.** Intracoronary nitroglycerin is often used to minimize ischemia, for example, caused by coronary spasm, either with or without oral CCBs.

# **Acute Heart Failure and Acute Pulmonary Edema**

No clear guidelines exist regarding management of *acute decompensated heart failure*. In an observational study of more than patients, intravenous nitroglycerin gave similar outcomes to what was achieved previously with intravenous nesiritide and better results than dobutamine, though randomized trail data are largely lacking. <sup>93</sup>

In *acute pulmonary edema* from various causes, including acute MI, nitroglycerin can be strikingly effective, with some risk of precipitous falls in BP and of tachycardia or bradycardia. Sublingual nitroglycerin in repeated doses of 0.8 to 2.4 mg every 5 to 10 minutes can relieve dyspnea within 15 to 20 minutes, with a fall of LV filling pressure and a rise in cardiac output. <sup>94</sup> Intravenous nitroglycerin, however, is usually a better method to administer

nitroglycerin because the dose can be rapidly adjusted upward or downward depending on the clinical and hemodynamic response. Infusion rates required may be higher than the maximal use for acute MI (i.e., above 200 µg/min), but this is premised on the need for only a brief infusion when pulmonary edema is present without systemic hypotension. A similar approach has been validated with intravenously infused isosorbide dinitrate.95

# Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction

Both short- and long-acting nitrates are used as unloading agents in the relief of symptoms in acute and chronic heart failure. Their dilating effects are more pronounced on veins than on arterioles, so they are best suited to patients with raised pulmonary wedge pressure and clinical features of pulmonary congestion. There is a beneficial, synergistic interaction between nitrates and hydralazine whereby the latter helps to lessen nitrate tolerance, <sup>96</sup> probably acting through inhibition of free radical formation. This may explain why the combination of nitrates and hydralazine is effective in heart failure. <sup>97</sup> The combination of high-dose isosorbide dinitrate (60 mg four times daily) plus hydralazine was better than placebo in decreasing mortality, yet nonetheless inferior to an ACE inhibitor in severe heart failure. 98 However, heart failure patients treated with the hydralazineisosorbide dinitrate combination had more significant improvements in both EF and NYHA functional class compared to enalapril. Thus, there is a firm therapeutic rationale for using additive, or combination, vasodilator therapy in heart failure patients. 98

As in treating exertional angina, nitrate tolerance remains a problem. Intermittent dosing designed to counter periods of expected dyspnea (at night, or during anticipated exercise) is one approach. 99 Escalating doses of nitrates provide only a short-term solution and should, in general, be avoided.

### Beneficial Combination of Isosorbide Dinitrate and Hvdralazine in African American Patients With Heart **Failure**

The combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate is approved for use in the United States as BiDil (Nitromed, Inc) for patients with heart failure who self-identify as black. Approval was based in part on results of the African American Heart Failure Trial (A-HeFT) showing that BiDil use was associated with a 43% reduction in death and a 39% reduction in hospitalizations. 100 The combination used was isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg and hydralazine 37.5 mg, both given three times daily.

Despite the proven efficacy of this additive vasodilator combination in African Americans, it remains unclear whether there could be a potentially incremental role of such combination

therapy in other ethnic groups of patients with severe heart failure or in whom other forms of pharmacotherapy are relatively contraindicated, for example, on the basis of renal dysfunction.

# Side Effects, Contraindications, and Drug Interactions

# Side Effects

Hypotension is the most serious and headache the most common side effect (Table 1.9). Headache characteristically occurs with sublingual nitroglycerin, and at the start of therapy with long-acting nitrates.<sup>82</sup> Often the headaches pass over while antianginal efficacy is maintained; yet headaches may lead to loss of treatment adherence. Concomitant aspirin reduces the occurrence of headaches. In chronic lung disease, arterial hypoxemia may result from vasodilation and increased venous admixture.

# Nitrate Contraindications

With right ventricular involvement in AMI, a nitrate-induced fall in LV filling pressure may aggravate hypotension. A systolic BP of less than 90 mmHg is a contraindication. Recent ingestion of sildenafil or its equivalent means that nitrate therapy must be delayed or avoided (see "Nitrate Interactions with Other Drugs," pp. 43–44).

# Nitrate Interactions With Other Drugs

Many of the proposed interactions of nitrates are pharmacodynamic, involving potentiation of vasodilatory effects, as with the CCBs. However, the chief example of vasodilator interactions is with the selective phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors such as sildenafil and similar agents used for erectile dysfunction. In addition, PDE-5 inhibitors are used increasingly for the therapy of pulmonary hypertension (see Chapter 11), and their potential benefits in heart failure are likewise being explored. As a group, these agents can cause serious hypotensive reactions when combined with nitrates (see Fig. 1.16). Hence the package insert of each agent forbids coadministration to patients taking nitrates in any form either regularly or intermittently. For example, sildenafil decreases the BP by approximately 8.4/5.5 mmHg, and by much more in those taking nitrates. The exertion of sexual intercourse also stresses the cardiovascular system further. As a group, these drugs should also not be given with α-adrenergic blockers. In case of inadvertent PDE-5-nitrate combinations, administration of an α-adrenergic agonist or even of norepinephrine may be needed.

# Nitrate precautions and side effects

#### Precautions

Need airtight containers.

Nitrate sprays are inflammable.

#### Common side effects

Headaches initially frequently limit dose; often respond to aspirin. Facial flushing may occur.

Sublingual nitrates may cause halitosis.

## Serious side effects

Syncope and hypotension may occur.

Hypotension risks cerebral ischemia.

Alcohol or other vasodilators may augment hypotension.

Tachycardia frequent.

Methemoglobinemia: with prolonged high doses. Give IV methylene blue (1–2 mg/kg)

#### Contraindications

In hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, nitrates may exaggerate outflow obstruction.

Sildenafil (or similar agents): risk of hypotension or even acute MI.

#### Relative contraindications

Cor pulmonale: decreased arterial pO2.

Reduced venous return risky in constrictive pericarditis, tight mitral stenosis.

#### Tolerance

Continuous high doses lead to tolerance that eccentric dosage may avoid. Cross-tolerance between formulations.

#### Withdrawal symptoms

Gradually discontinue long-term nitrates.

Additionally, whenever a male patient presents with an anginal attack or ACS, whether or not precipitated by sexual intercourse, one essential question that must be considered or probed is whether the patient has recently taken sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra), or tadalafil (Cialis) (Fig. 1.17)? If so, an important corollary question is how soon thereafter can a nitrate be safely administered. In clinical practice, nitrates may be started 24 hours

## SERIOUS NITRATE INTERACTION

![](_page_53_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 1.17** A serious nitrate-drug interaction. The mechanism of normal erection involves penile vasodilation mediated by guanosine triphosphate (*GTP*) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (*GMP*). The phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (*PDE* 5) such as sildenafil (Viagra) act by inhibiting the enzymatic breakdown of penile cyclic GMP to GMP with increased vasodilation. This is not confined to the penis, and peripheral vasodilation added to that caused by nitrates gives rise to an excess fall of blood pressure (*BP*) and possible syncope. Hence the use of PDE 5 inhibitors in any patient taking nitrates is contraindicated. *NO*, Nitric oxide. (Figure © L. H. Opie, 2012.)

after sildenafil $^{82}$  and for vardenafil, while for the longer-acting tadalafil, the corresponding interval is 48 hours. $^{101}$ 

# **Nitrate Tolerance and Nitric Oxide Resistance**

#### Nitrate Tolerance

Nitrate tolerance often limits nitrate efficacy. Thus longer-acting nitrates, although providing higher and better-sustained blood nitrate levels, paradoxically often seem to lose their efficacy with time. This is the phenomenon of nitrate tolerance (see Fig. 1.15).

### Strategies to Prevent or Minimize Nitrate Tolerance

In effort angina, many studies now show that symptomatic tolerance can be lessened by interval dosing. Eccentric twice-daily doses of isosorbide mononitrate (Monoket, Ismo) or once-daily treatment with 120 or 240 mg of the extended-release formulation of mononitrate (Imdur) maintain clinical activity but may nonetheless lead to endothelial dysfunction. There is considerable evidence that nitrate effects on blood vessels and platelets are SH-dependent. Concomitant therapy with SH donors such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC) potentiates nitroglycerin effects, both hemodynamically 105 and on platelet aggregation. <sup>106</sup> Concomitant nitroglycerin-NAC therapy may also limit tolerance induction clinically <sup>107</sup> while improving outcomes in unstable angina pectoris. <sup>108</sup>Additional simple procedures that might be tried are folic acid supplementation, supplemental L-arginine, <sup>109</sup> and vitamin C. <sup>76</sup>

### Nitrate Rebound and Pseudotolerance

Rebound is the abrupt increase in anginal frequency during accidental nitrate withdrawal (e.g., displacement of an intravenous infusion) or during nitrate-free periods. Nitrate pseudotolerance probably accounts for the "zero hour phenomenon," whereby patients receiving long-acting nitrate therapy experience worsening of angina just prior to routine administration of medication. 87 The purported underlying mechanisms are unopposed vasoconstriction (angiotensin II, catecholamines, and endothelin) during nitrate withdrawal with attenuation of net vasodilator effect of NO. 112

### Nitric Oxide Resistance

NO resistance may be defined as de novo hyporesponsiveness to NO effects, whether vascular or antiaggregatory. It also occurs with other "direct" donors of NO, such as sodium nitroprusside. The occurrence of NO resistance accounts for the finding that some patients with heart failure respond poorly to infused NO donors, irrespective of prior nitrate exposure. 113 The mechanisms of NO resistance in platelets relate primarily to incremental redox stress mediated by superoxide anion release. 114 There is a close association between NO resistance and endothelial dysfunction as in ACS. <sup>115</sup> Platelet resistance to NO is an adverse prognostic marker. <sup>116</sup>

# **Combination Therapy for Angina**

Existing data are inadequate to evaluate the overall efficacy of combinations of nitrates plus β-blockers and CCBs when compared with optimal therapy by each other or by any one agent alone. The previous landmark COURAGE Trial continues to reflect current American practice, and these findings have been largely validated and reinforced by the recent large international ISCHEMIA Trial published in April 2020.  $^{117a\text{-c}}$  Almost all received a statin and aspirin, 86% to 89% a  $\beta$ -blocker, and 65% to 78% an ACE inhibitor or ARB. Nitrate use declined from 72% at the start to 57% at 5 years. However, only 43% to 49% were given a CCB.  $^{117d}$ 

 $\beta$ -blockade and long-acting nitrates are often combined in the therapy of angina (see Table 1.10). Both  $\beta$ -blockers and nitrates decrease the oxygen demand, and nitrates increase the oxygen supply;  $\beta$ -blockers block the tachycardia caused by

- 2. Prophylactic drugs. Give aspirin, statins and ACE inhibitors. Control BP.

nitrates. β-blockade tends to increase heart size and nitrates to decrease it

CCBs and short-acting nitroglycerin are often combined. In a double-blind trial of 47 patients with effort angina, verapamil 80 mg three times daily decreased the use of nitroglycerin tablets by 25% and prolonged exercise time by 20%. 118 No outcome data have been reported. CCBs and long-acting nitrates are also often given together, however, again without support from outcome trial data.

*Nitrates*,  $\beta$ -blockers, and CCBs may also be combined as triple therapy. The ACTION study was a very large outcome study in which long-acting nifedipine GI therapeutic system (GITS; Procardia XL, Adalat CC) was added to preexisting antianginal therapy, mostly β-blockers (80%) and nitrates (57% nitrates as needed, and 38% daily nitrates). The CCB reduced the need for coronary angiography or bypass surgery, and reduced new heart failure. In hypertensive patients added nifedipine gave similar but more marked benefits plus stroke reduction. There are two lessons: first, dual medical therapy by  $\beta$ -blockers and nitrates is inferior to triple therapy (added DHP CCBs); and second, hypertension in stable angina needs vigorous antihypertensive therapy as in triple therapy. However, we argue that "optimal medical therapy" should consider a metabolically active agent.

# Calcium Channel Blockers

# Introduction

CCBs (calcium antagonists) act chiefly by vasodilation and reduction of the peripheral vascular resistance. They remain among the most commonly used agents for hypertension and angina. Their major role in these conditions is now well established, based on the results of a series of large trials. CCBs are a heterogeneous group of drugs that can chemically be classified into the DHPs and the non-DHPs (Table 1.11), their common pharmacologic property being selective inhibition of Ltype channel opening in vascular smooth muscle and in the myocardium (Fig. 1.18). Distinctions between the DHPs and non-DHPs are reflected in different binding sites on the calcium channel pores, and in the greater vascular selectivity of the DHP agents. 120 In addition, the non-DHPs, by virtue of nodal inhibition, reduce the heart rate (heart rate-lowering [HRL] agents). Thus, verapamil and diltiazem more closely resemble the β-blockers in their therapeutic spectrum, with one major difference: CCBs should be used cautiously in heart failure, particularly in the setting of a recent Q-wave MI or ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMD. 121

# **Mechanisms of Action and Pharmacologic Properties**

# **Calcium Channels: L and T Types**

The most important property of all CCBs is selectively to inhibit the inward flow of charge-bearing calcium ions when the calcium channel becomes permeable or is "open." Previously, the term slow channel was used, but now it is realized that the calcium current travels much faster than originally thought, and that there are at least two types of calcium channels, the L and T. The conventional long-lasting opening calcium channel is termed the *L-type channel*, which is blocked by CCBs and increased in activity by catecholamines. The function of the L-type is to permit the influx of the requisite amount of calcium ions needed for initiation of contraction via the release of stored calcium ions from the SR (see Fig. 1.18). The T-type (T for transient) channel opens at more negative

potentials than the L-type. It plays an important role in the initial depolarization of sinus and AV nodal tissue and is relatively upregulated in the failing myocardium. Currently there are no specific Ttype blockers clinically available.

In smooth muscle (see Fig. 1.6), calcium ions regulate the contractile mechanism independently of troponin C. Interaction of calcium with calmodulin forms calcium-calmodulin, which then stimulates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) to phosphorylate the myosin light chains to allow actin-myosin interaction and, hence, contraction. cAMP inhibits the MLCK. By contrast, β-blockade, by lessening the formation of cAMP, removes the inhibition on MLCK activity, and therefore promotes contraction in smooth muscle, which explains why asthma may be precipitated, and why the peripheral vascular resistance often rises at the start of β-blocker therapy (Fig. 1.19).

# Cellular Mechanisms: β-Blockade Versus CCBs

Both these categories of agents are used primarily for angina and hypertension, yet there are important differences in their subcellular mode of action. Both have a negative inotropic effect, whereas only CCBs relax vascular and (to a much lesser extent) other smooth muscle (Fig. 1.6). CCBs "block" the entry of calcium through the calcium channel in both smooth muscle and myocardium, so that less calcium is available to the contractile apparatus. The result is vasodilation and a negative inotropic effect, which in the case of the DHPs is usually modest because of the unloading effect of peripheral artery vasodilation.

CCBs versus β-blockers. CCBs andβ-blockers have hemodynamic and neurohumoral differences. Hemodynamic differences are well defined (see Fig. 1.19). Whereas β-blockers inhibit the reninangiotensin system by decreasing renin release and opposethe hyperadrenergic state in heart failure, CCBs as a group have no such inhibitory effects.122 This difference could explain why β-blockers but not CCBs are an important component for treating heart failure.

# Classification of CCBs and Differences Among Drugs in Class

# Dihydropyridines (DHPs)

The DHPs all bind to the same sites on the α1-subunit (the N sites), thereby establishing their common property of calcium channel antagonism (Fig. 1.20). To a different degree, they exert a greater inhibitory effect on vascular smooth muscle than on the myocardium, conferring the property of vascular selectivity (see Table 1.11, Fig. 1.21). There is nonetheless still the potential for myocardial depression, particularly in the case of agents with less selectivity and in the presence of prior myocardial disease (particularly extensive MI)<sup>123</sup> or β-blockade. For practical purposes, effects of DHPs on the SA and AV nodes can be ignored.

# Nondihydropyridine (non-DHP) or Heart Rate-Lowering (HRL) CCBs

Both verapamil and diltiazem bind to two different sites on the α1 subunit of the calcium channel (see Fig. 1.20) yet have many properties in commonwith each other. Thefirst andmost obvious distinction from the DHPs is that verapamil and diltiazem both act on nodal tissue, being therapeutically effective in SVTs. Both tend to decrease impulse formation from the sinus node and slow heart rate. Both

Fig. 1.20 Proposed molecular model of calcium channel α1-subunit with binding sites for nifedipine (N), diltiazem (D), and verapamil (V). It is thought that all dihydropyridines bind to the same site as nifedipine. Amlodipine has additional subsidiary binding to the V and D sites. P indicates sites of phosphorylation in response to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (see Fig. 1.18), which acts to increase the opening probability of the calcium channel. (Figure © L.H. Opie, 2012.)

inhibit myocardial contraction more than the DHPs or, put differently, are less vascular selective (see Fig. 1.21). These properties, added to peripheral vasodilation, lead to substantial reduction in the myocardial oxygen demand. Such "oxygen conservation" makes the HRL agents much closer than the DHPs to the β-blockers, with which they share some similarities of therapeutic activity.

# Specific CCB Agents

## Verapamil

Verapamil (Isoptin, Calan, Verelan), the prototype non-DHP agent, remains the CCB with the most licensed indications. Both verapamil and diltiazem have multiple cardiovascular effects (see Fig. 1.22).

### *CARDIAC VS VASCULAR SELECTIVITY*

![](_page_62_Figure_3.jpeg)

Fig. 1.21 As a group, the dihydropyridines (DHPs) are more vascular selective, whereas the non-DHPs verapamil and diltiazem act equally on the heart and on the arterioles. AV, Atrioventricular; SA, sinoatrial. (Figure © L.H. Opie, 2012.)

Electrophysiology. Verapamil inhibits the action potential of the upper and middle regions of the AV node where depolarization is calcium mediated. Verapamil thus inhibits one limb of the reentry circuit, believed to underlie most paroxysmal SVTs (see Fig. 1.23). Increased AV block and the increase in effective refractory period of the AV node explain the reduction of the ventricular rate in atrial flutter and fibrillation. Hemodynamically, verapamil combines arteriolar dilation with a direct negative inotropic effect (see Table 1.12).

Pharmacokinetics. Oral verapamil takes 2 hours to act and peaks at 3 hours. Therapeutic blood levels (80 to 400 ng/mL) are seldom measured. The elimination half-life is usually 3 to 7 hours but increases significantly during chronic administration and in patients with liver or advanced renal insufficiency. Despite nearly complete absorption of oral doses, bioavailability is only 10% to 20%. There is a high first-pass liver metabolism by multiple components of the P-450 system, including CYP3A4, the latter explaining why verapamil increases blood levels of several statins such as atorvastatin, simvastatin, and lovastatin, as well as ketoconazole. Because of the hepatic CYP3A4 interaction, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that the 10-mg dose of simvastatin should not be exceeded in patients taking verapamil. Ultimate

excretion of the parent compound, as well as the active hepatic metabolite norverapamil, is 75% by the kidneys and 25% by the GI tract. Verapamil is 87% to 93% protein bound, but no interaction with warfarin has been reported. When both verapamil and digoxin are given together, their interaction causes digoxin levels to rise, probably as a result of a reduction in the renal clearance of digoxin.

Verapamil doses. The usual total oral dose is 180–360 mg daily, but no more than 480 mg given once or twice daily (long-acting formulations) or three times daily for standard short-acting preparations should be administered (see Table 1.12). Large differences in pharmacokinetics among individuals indicates that careful dose titration is required, so that 120 mg daily may be adequate for those with hepatic impairment or for older adults. During chronic oral dosing, the formation of norverapamil metabolites and altered rates of hepatic metabolism suggest that less frequent or smaller daily doses of short-acting verapamil may be used.<sup>124</sup> For example, if verapamil has been given at a dose of 80 mg three times daily, then 120 mg twice daily should be equipotent and well tolerated. Lower doses are required in older adult patients or those with advanced renal or hepatic disease or when there is concurrent β-blockade. Intravenous verapamil is much less used for supraventricular arrhythmias since the advent of adenosine and the ultra–short acting β-blocker, esmolol.

Slow-release preparations. Calan SR or Isoptin SR releases the drug from a matrix at a rate that responds to food, whereas Verelan releases the drug from a rate-controlling polymer at a rate not sensitive to food intake. The usual doses are 240–480 mg daily. The SR preparations are given once or twice daily and Verelan once daily. A controlled-onset, extended-release tablet (Covera-HS; COER-24; 180 or 240 mg tablets) is also taken once daily at bedtime.

# Data for Clinical Use: Indications for Verapamil

Angina and myocardial ischemia. In chronic stable exertional angina, verapamil acts by a combination of afterload reduction and a mild negative inotropic effect, plus reduction of exerciseinduced tachycardia and coronary vasoconstriction. The heart rate usually stays the same or falls modestly. In a major outcome study in patients with CAD with hypertension, INVEST, verapamil-based therapy was compared with atenolol-based therapy, the former supplemented by the ACE inhibitor trandolapril and the latter by a thiazide, if required, to achieve the BP goal.<sup>42</sup> Major outcomes were very similar, but verapamil-based therapy resulted in less angina and new diabetes. Verapamil doses of 240–360 mg daily were the

approximate equivalent of atenolol 50–100 mg daily. For patients with Prinzmetal's variant angina, therapy is based on CCBs, including verapamil, and high does may be needed.<sup>125</sup> Abrupt withdrawal of verapamil may precipitate rebound angina.

Hypertension. Verapamil is approved for mild to moderate hypertension in the United States. Besides the outcome study in CAD with hypertension (preceding section), in a long-term, double-blind comparative trial, mild to moderate hypertension was adequately controlled in 45% of patients who received verapamil 240 mg daily,<sup>126</sup> versus 25% control for hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily, versus 60% for the combination. Verapamil combinations can include diuretics, β-blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or centrally acting agents. During combination with α-blockers, a hepatic interaction may lead to excess hypotension.

Supraventricular arrhythmias. Verapamil is licensed for the prophylaxis of repetitive SVTs and for rate control in chronic atrial fibrillation. For acute attacks of SVTs, when there is no myocardial depression, a bolus dose of 5 mg to 10 mg (0.1 to 0.15 mg/kg) given over 2 minutes restores sinus rhythm within 10 minutes in 60% of cases (package insert). However, this use is now largely supplanted by intravenous adenosine (see Fig. 1.24). When used for uncontrolled atrial fibrillation (but with caution if there is LV failure), verapamil may safely be given (0.005 mg/kg/min, increasing) or as an intravenous bolus of 5 mg (0.075 mg/kg) followed by double the dose if needed. The maximal total dose of intravenous verapamil is 20–30mg when used as repetitive boluses. In atrial flutter, AV block is increased. In all SVTs, including atrial flutter and fibrillation, the presence of a bypass tract (Wolff-Parkinson-White [WPW] syndrome) contraindicates verapamil.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, verapamil has been the CCB best evaluated. It is licensed for this purpose in Canada. When given acutely, it lessens symptoms, reduces the outflow tract gradient, improves diastolic function, and enhances exercise performance by 20% to 25%. Verapamil should not be given to patients with resting outflow tract obstruction. No long-term, placebo-controlled studies with verapamil are available. In retrospective comparisons with propranolol, verapamil appeared to decrease sudden death and gave better 10-year survival.127 The best results were obtained by a combination of septal myectomy and verapamil. A significant number of patients on longterm verapamil develop severe side effects, including SA and AV nodal dysfunction, and occasionally overt heart failure.

Postinfarction secondary prevention. For postinfarct protection, verapamil is approved in the United Kingdom and in

### ADENOSINE INHIBITION OF AV NODE

![](_page_68_Figure_3.jpeg)

Fig. 1.24 Adenosine inhibits the atrioventricular (AV) node by effects on ion channels. Adenosine acting on the adenosine 1  $(A_1)$  surface receptor opens the adenosine-sensitive potassium channel to hyperpolarize and inhibit the AV node and also indirectly to inhibit calcium channel opening.

Scandinavian countries when β-blockade is contraindicated. Verapamil 120 mg three times daily, started 7 to 15 days after the acute phase in patients without a history of heart failure and no signs of CHF (but with digoxin and diuretic therapy allowed), was protective and decreased reinfarction and mortality by approximately 25% over 18 months. <sup>128</sup> As noted above, both verapamil and diltiazem may have clinical utility for reducing recurrent cardiac events in selected patients (principally those with non-Q-wave MI or NSTEMI) where there is no evidence of LV systolic dysfunction, generally defined as an EF <40%.

**Side effects.** Verapamil has a less active effect on vascular smooth muscle and thus less vasodilatory side effects than the DHPs, with less flushing or headaches or pedal edema (Table 1.13). Reflex

tachycardia is uncommon because of the inhibitory effects on the SA node. LV depression remains the major potential side effect, especially in patients with preexisting congestive heart failure (CHF) due to largely extensive MI. Why constipation occurs only with verapamil of all the CCBs is not known.

Contraindications to verapamil. (Fig. 1.25, Table 1.14). Contraindications, especially in the intravenous therapy of SVTs, are sick sinus syndrome; preexisting AV nodal disease; and excess therapy with β-blockade, digitalis, quinidine, or disopyramide. In the WPW syndrome complicated by atrial fibrillation, intravenous verapamil is contraindicated because of the risk of anterograde conduction through the bypass tract (see Fig. 1.26). Verapamil is also contraindicated in VT (wide QRS-complex) because of excess myocardial depression, which may be lethal. Myocardial depression, if secondary to the SVT, is not a contraindication, whereas preexisting LV systolic failure warrants cautious use.

# **Drug Interactions With Verapamil**

### *AV NODAL RE-ENTRY VERSUS WPW*

![](_page_72_Figure_1.jpeg)

Fig. 1.26 Atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentry and Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) or preexcitation syndrome. The top left panel shows AV nodal reentry without WPW. The common pattern is slow-fast (middle panel), whereas fast-slow conduction (bottom left panel) is uncommon. The slow and fast fibers of the AV node are artificially separated for diagrammatic purposes. The right panel shows WPW with the bypass tract as a white band. During paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), when anterograde conduction occurs over the AV node and retrograde conduction most commonly through the accessory pathway, the QRS pattern should be normal (orthodromic supraventricular tachycardia [SVT], top right panel). Less commonly, the accessory pathway is used as the anterograde limb and the AV node (or a second accessory pathway) is the retrograde limb (antidromic SVT, bottom right panel). The QRS pattern shows the pattern of full preexcitation. In such preexcited atrial tachycardias, agents that block the AV node may enhance conduction over the accessory pathway to the ventricles (red downward arrows), leading to rapid ventricular rates that predispose to ventricular fibrillation. Sites of action of various classes of antiarrhythmics are indicated. Ado, Adenosine; β-B, β-blocker. (Figure © L.H. Opie, 2012.)

in the therapy of angina pectoris or hypertension, provided that due care is taken (monitoring for heart rate and heart block). In older adults, prior SA and AV nodal disease must be excluded. For hypertension, a combination of a β-blocker plus verapamil is therapeutically effective, although heart rate, AV conduction, and LV function may sometimes be adversely affected. To avoid any hepatic pharmacokinetic interactions, verapamil is best combined with a hydrophilic β-blocker such as atenolol or nadolol, rather than one that is metabolized in the liver, such as metoprolol, propranolol, or carvedilol.

Digoxin. Verapamil inhibits the digoxin transporter, P-glycoprotein, to increase blood digoxin levels, which is of special relevance when both are used chronically to inhibit AV nodal conduction. In digitalis toxicity, rapid intravenous verapamil is absolutely contraindicated because it can lethally exaggerate AV block. In the absence of digitalis toxicity or AV block, oral verapamil and digoxin should be used very cautiously, and digoxin levels needs to be checked. Whereas digoxin can be used for heart failure with atrial fibrillation, verapamil is negatively inotropic and should be avoided.

Antiarrhythmics. The combined negative inotropic potential of verapamil and disopyramide is considerable. Cotherapy with flecainide may also produce additive negative inotropic and dromotropic effects.

Statins and other agents. Verapamil inhibits the hepatic CYP3A isoenzyme, and therefore potentially increases the blood levels of atorvastatin, simvastatin, and lovastatin, which are all metabolized by this isoenzyme.<sup>132</sup> It also increases blood levels of cyclosporin, carbamazepine (Tegretol), and theophylline, and this CYP3A inhibition is also expected to increase blood levels of ketoconazole and sildenafil. Conversely, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and rifampin are CYP3A4 inducers in metabolizing verapamil so that its blood levels fall.

Therapy of verapamil toxicity. There are few clinical reports on management of verapamil toxicity. Intravenous calcium gluconate (1 to 2 g) or half that dose of calcium chloride, given over 5 minutes, helps when heart failure or excess hypotension is present. If there is an inadequate response, positive inotropic or vasoconstrictory catecholamines are administered or, alternatively, glucagon or hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic therapy is given.<sup>133</sup> Intravenous atropine (0.5 to 1 mg) or isoproterenol is used to shorten AV conduction. A pacemaker may be needed.

# Diltiazem

Although molecular studies show different channel binding sites for diltiazem and verapamil (see Fig. 1.20), in clinical practice they have somewhat similar therapeutic spectra and contraindications, so that they are often classified as the non-DHPs or HRL agents (see Fig. 1.21). Clinically, diltiazem is used for the same spectrum of disease as is verapamil: angina pectoris, hypertension, supraventricular arrhythmias, and rate control in atrial fibrillation or flutter (see Fig. 1.22). Diltiazem has a low side-effect profile, similar to or possibly better than that of verapamil; specifically the incidence of constipation is much lower (Table 1.13). On the other hand, verapamil is registered for more indications.

Pharmacokinetics. Following oral administration of diltiazem, more than 90% is absorbed, but bioavailability is approximately 45% (first-pass hepatic metabolism). The onset of action of short-acting diltiazem is within 15–30 minutes (oral), with a peak at 1–2 hours. The elimination half-life is 4–7 hours; hence, dosage every 6–8 hours of the short-acting preparation is required for sustained therapeutic effect. The therapeutic plasma concentration range is 50–300 ng/mL. Protein binding is 80–86%. Diltiazem is acetylated in the liver to deacyldiltiazem (40% of the activity of the parent compound), which accumulates with chronic therapy. Unlike verapamil and nifedipine, only 35% of diltiazem is excreted by the kidneys (65% by the GI tract). Because of the hepatic CYP3A4 interaction, the FDA warns that dosage of simvastatin should not exceed 10 mg when used with diltiazem.

Diltiazem doses. The dose of diltiazem is 120–360 mg, given in four daily doses of the short-acting formulation or once or twice a day with slow-release preparations. Cardizem SR permits twicedaily doses. For once-daily use, Dilacor XR is licensed in the United States for hypertension and Cardizem CD and Tiazac for hypertension and angina.

# Data for Use: Clinical Indications for Diltiazem

Exertional angina and myocardial ischemia. The efficacy of diltiazem in chronic stable angina is at least as good as propranolol or other β-blockers, and the dose is titrated from 120–360 mg daily (see Table 1.12). In vasospastic angina, diltiazem 240– 360 mg/day reduces the number of episodes of ischemic chest discomfort.

Diltiazem for supraventricular arrhythmia. Intravenous diltiazem (Cardizem injectable) is approved for arrhythmias but not for acute hypertension. The main electrophysiologic effect is a negative chronotropic and dromotropic effect on the AV node; the functional and effective refractory periods are prolonged by diltiazem, so that diltiazem is approved fortermination of an attack of supraventricular tachyarrhythmia and for the rapid decrease of the ventricular response rate in atrial flutter or fibrillation. For acute conversion of paroxysmal SVT, after exclusion of WPW syndrome (see Fig. 1.26) or for slowing the ventricular response rate in atrial fibrillation or flutter, it is given as 0.25 mg/kg over 2 minutes with electrocardiogram and BP monitoring. If the response is inadequate, the dose is repeated as 0.35 mg/kg over 2 minutes. Acute therapy is usually followed by an infusion of 5–15 mg/h for up to 24 hours. Diltiazem overdose is treated as for verapamil. Oral diltiazem can be used for the elective as well as prophylactic control (90 mg three times daily) of most supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.

Diltiazem for hypertension. In the major long-term outcome study, the Nordic Diltiazem (NORDIL) trial, which included more than patients, diltiazem followed by an ACE inhibitor if needed to reach BP goals was as effective in preventing the primary combined cardiovascular endpoint as treatment based on a diuretic, a β-blocker, or both.134 In the multicenter VA study of antihypertensive monotherapy, diltiazem was shown to be the most effective among five agents (atenolol, thiazide, doxazosin, and captopril) in reducing BP, and was especially effective in older adult white patients and in black patients.<sup>135</sup> Nonetheless, reduction of LV hypertrophy was limited/inconclusive at 1 year of follow-up, possibly because a short-acting diltiazem formulation was used.136

Postinfarction secondary prevention. While β-blockers have been used extensively as secondary prevention in post-MI patients for decades, there has been a paucity of data to support the benefits of β-blockers in patients with prior MI. HRL CCBs have been viewed historically as being contraindicated in post-MI secondary prevention. This concern about the presumed "negative inotropic effects" of HRL CCBs was fueled primarily by the negative results of the Multicenter Diltiazem Post-Infarction Trial (MDPIT) more than 30 years ago. While there was clearly an increased rate of death or MI in the 20% of MDPIT patients with clinical or radiographic pulmonary congestion and among subjects with an EF <40%, these deleterious findings were observed principally in the 30% of participants who had presented clinically with extensive anterior Q-wave MI associated with LV systolic dysfunction. In the MI patients without pulmonary congestion or LV systolic dysfunction, there was no evidence for an excess in death and/or MI rate.

By contrast, and importantly, among the 27% of enrolled subjects in MDPIT with non-Q-wave MI (NSTEMI), the first recurrent cardiac event rate (death or MI) was reduced by approximately 40% during a mean 2-year follow-up from 15% in the placebo group to 9% in the diltiazem group (HR 0.66, 96% CI 0.44, 0.98). It is relevant to cite, however, that these findings were observed only in a subset of the overall study population, though these were prespecified analyses. Despite these findings of a salutary benefit of diltiazem in this group of patients, this has become a virtually forgotten therapeutic agent for postinfarction secondary prevention.

Side effects. Normally side effects of the standard preparation are few and limited to headaches, dizziness, and ankle edema in approximately 6–10% of patients (see Table 1.13). With high-dose diltiazem (360 mg daily), constipation may also occur. Bradycardia and first-degree AV block may occur with all diltiazem preparations. In the case of intravenous diltiazem, side effects resemble those of intravenous verapamil, including hypotension and the possible risk of asystole and high-degree AV block when there is preexisting nodal disease. In postinfarction patients with preexisting poor LV function, most notably among the subset of patients with recent, extensive anterior Q-wave MI or post-STEMI, mortality was shown to be increased by diltiazem, not decreased. Occasionally, severe skin rashes such as exfoliative dermatitis are found.

Contraindications. Contraindications resemble those of verapamil (see Fig. 1.25, Table 1.14): preexisting marked depression of the sinus or AV node, hypotension, myocardial failure, and WPW syndrome. Postinfarction LV failure, as described above, with an EF of less than 40% is a contraindication to diltiazem administration (based on the results of the older MDPIT trial).<sup>137</sup>

Drug interactions and combinations. Unlike verapamil, the effect of diltiazem on the blood digoxin level is often slight or negligible.<sup>138</sup> In fact, one carefully performed study failed to show any increase in serum digoxin levels despite the graded increase in oral diltiazem dosing in normal subject volunteers.<sup>138</sup> As in the case of verapamil, there are the expected hemodynamic interactions with β-blockers. Nonetheless, diltiazem plus a β-blocker may be an effective combination when used with care for angina pectoris management, taking precaution for excess bradycardia or AV block or hypotension. Occasionally diltiazem plus a DHP CCB is used for refractory coronary artery spasm, the rationale being that two different binding sites on the calcium channel are involved (see Fig. 1.20). Diltiazem plus long-acting nitrates may lead to excess hypotension. As in the case of verapamil, but probably less so, diltiazem may inhibit CYP3A cytochrome, which is expected to increase blood levels of cyclosporin, ketoconazole, carbamazepine (Tegretol), and sildenafil.<sup>132</sup> Conversely, cimetidine inhibits the hepatic cytochrome system breaking down diltiazem to increase circulating levels.

# Nifedipine: The Prototypic and First DHP CCB

The major actions of the DHPs can be simplified to one: arteriolar dilation (see Fig. 1.21). The direct negative inotropic effect is usually outweighed by arteriolar unloading effects and by reflex adrenergic stimulation (see Fig. 1.27), except in patients with heart failure. Nifedipine was the first of the DHPs. In the short-acting capsule form, originally available, it rapidly vasodilates to relieve severe hypertension and to terminate attacks of coronary vasospasm. The peripheral vasodilation and a rapid drop in BP led to rapid reflex adrenergic activation with tachycardia (Fig. 1.27). Such

proischemic effects probably explain why the short-acting DHPs in high doses have precipitated serious adverse events in unstable angina. The inappropriate use of short-acting nifedipine can explain much of the adverse publicity that once surrounded the CCBs as a group, <sup>140</sup> so that the focus has now changed to the long-acting DHPs, which are free of such dangers. 141 The subsequent introduction of truly long-acting compounds, such as amlodipine or the extended-release formulations of nifedipine (GITS, XL, CC), and of others such as felodipine and isradipine, has led to much greater usage of the DHPs

## **Long-Acting Nifedipine Formulations**

The long-acting nifedipine formulations (Procardia XL in the United States, Adalat LA elsewhere; Adalat CC) are now widely used in the treatment of hypertension, in exertional angina, and in vasospastic angina.

**Pharmacokinetics.** Almost all circulating nifedipine is broken down by hepatic metabolism by the cytochrome P-450 system to inactive metabolites (high first-pass metabolism) that are largely excreted in the urine. The long-acting, osmotically sensitive tablet (nifedipine GITS, marketed as Procardia XL or Adalat LA) releases nifedipine from the inner core as water enters the tablet from the GI tract (see Table 1.12). This process results in stable blood therapeutic levels of approximately 20 to 30 ng/mL over 24 hours. With a core-coat system (Adalat CC), the blood levels over 24 hours are more variable, with the trough-peak ratios of 41% to 91%.

**Doses of nifedipine.** In exertional angina, the usual daily dose mg of Procardia XL or Adalat LA (Adalat CC is not licensed in the United States for angina). Dose titration is important to avoid precipitation of ischemic pain in some patients. In cold-induced angina or in coronary spasm, the doses are similar and capsules (in similar total daily doses) allow the most rapid onset of action. In hypertension, standard doses are 30–90 mg once daily of Procardia XL or Adalat CC. In older adults or in patients with severe liver disease, doses should be reduced.

# Data for Use: Clinical Indications for Nifedipine

**Exertional angina.** In the United States only Procardia XL and not Adalat CC is licensed for exertional angina, when β-blockade and nitrates are ineffective or not tolerated. Whereas capsular nifedipine modestly increases the heart rate (that may aggravate angina), extended-release preparations leave the unchanged. 142 Their antianginal activity and safety approximate

that of the β-blockers, albeit at the cost of more subjective symptoms.<sup>143</sup> In the ACTION study on patients with stable coronary disease, one of the largest studies on effort angina (n 7800), 80% already receiving β-blockade, the major benefits of added longacting nifedipine were less new heart failure, less coronary angiography, and less bypass surgery.<sup>144</sup> In the retrospective substudy on hypertensives (mean initial 151/85 mmHg falling to 136/78 mmHg) new heart failure decreased by 38% and major stroke by 32%, without altering cardiovascular death.<sup>145</sup>

Vasospastic angina. Long-acting nifedipine is widely used as a powerful arterial vasodilator with few serious side effects and is now part of the accepted therapy for vasospastic angina, although its use as a DHP CCB has been largely supplanted by amlodipine. However, in unstable angina at rest and in ACSs not felt to be vasospastic in origin, nifedipine in any formulation should not be used as monotherapy, as it may be associated with hypotension, reflex tachycardia, a coronary steal phenomenon, and worsening myocardial ischemia.123,139

Systemic hypertension. Long-acting nifedipine and other DHPs are increasingly used with excellent efficacy and tolerability. The major outcome study with nifedipine GITS, the INSIGHT study, showed equivalence in mortality and other major outcomes to the diuretic, with less new diabetes or gout or peripheral vascular disease and more heart failure.<sup>146</sup> Capsular forms are not licensed for hypertension in the United States because of intermittent vasodilation and reflex adrenergic discharge, as well as the short duration of action. Procardia XL and Adalat CC are, however, approved and the dose is initially 30 mg once daily up to 90 mg daily.

Contraindications and cautions. (Fig. 1.28, Table 1.15). These include hemodynamically significant severe valvular aortic stenosis or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (danger of exaggerated pressure gradient), clinically evident heart failure or LV dysfunction (added negative inotropic effect), unstable angina with threat of infarction (in the absence of concurrent β-blockade), and preexisting hypotension.

Minor side effects. Two residual side effects of note are headache, as for all arteriolar dilators, and ankle edema, caused by precapillary dilation. The bilateral ankle edema caused by nifedipine is distressing to patients but is not due to cardiac failure; if required, it can be treated by dose reduction, by conventional diuretics, or by an ACE inhibitor. Nifedipine itself has a mild diuretic effect. The low incidence of acute vasodilatory side effects, such as flushing and tachycardia, is because of the slow rate of rise of blood DHP levels.

Fig. 1.28 Contraindications to dihydropyridines (DHPs) are chiefly obstructive lesions such as aortic stenosis or hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and heart failure.

AV, Atrioventricular; SA, sinoatrial. (Figure © L.H. Opie, 2012.)

Drug interactions. Cimetidine and grapefruit juice (e.g., large amounts >1–2 quarts) inhibit the hepatic CYP3A4 P-450 enzyme system breaking down nifedipine, thereby substantially increasing its blood levels. Phenobarbital, phenytoin, and rifampin induce this system metabolizing so that nifedipine blood levels should fall (not mentioned in package insert). In some reports, blood digoxin levels rise. Volatile anesthetics interfere with the myocardial calcium regulation and have inhibitory effects additional to those of nifedipine.

Rebound angina/ischemia after cessation of nifedipine therapy. In patients with vasospastic angina, the manufacturers recommend that the dose be tapered to discontinuation and not abruptly discontinued.

Combination with β-blockers and other drugs. In patients with largely preserved LV function (EF 40%), nifedipine may be freely combined with β-blockade (Fig. 1.29), provided that excess hypotension is avoided. In significant LV systolic dysfunction (e.g., EF <40%), the added negative inotropic effects may precipitate overt heart failure. In the therapy of exertional or vasospastic angina, nifedipine is often combined with nitrates. In the therapy of hypertension, nifedipine may be combined with diuretics, β-blockers,

# Amlodipine: The First of the Second-Generation DHPs

The major specific advantages of amlodipine (Norvasc; Istin in the United Kingdom) are the slow onset of action and the long duration of activity (see Table 1.15) and the vast experience with this drug in hypertension. It was the first of the longer acting "secondgeneration" CCBs. It binds to the same site as other DHPs (labeled N in Fig. 1.20). The charged nature of the molecule means that its binding is not entirely typical, with very slow association and dissociation, so that the channel block is slow in onset and offset. Additionally, it also binds to the same sites as verapamil and diltiazem, albeit to a lesser degree, so that with justification its binding properties are regarded as unique. 147

Pharmacokinetics. Peak blood levels are reached after hours, followed by extensive hepatic metabolism to inactive metabolites. The plasma levels increase during chronic dosage probably because of the very long half-life. The elimination half-life is 35–48 hours, increasing slightly with chronic dosage. In older adults, the clearance is reduced and the dose may need reduction. Regarding drug interactions, no effect on digoxin levels has been found, nor is there any interaction with cimetidine (in contrast to verapamil and nifedipine). Because of the hepatic CYP3A4 interaction, the FDA warns that the 20-mg dose of simvastatin should not be exceeded in patients taking amlodipine. There is no known adverse effect with grapefruit juice ingestion.

# Data for Use: Clinical Indications for Amlodipine

**Hypertension.** Amlodipine has an outstanding record in major BP trials (Table 1.16). 148 As initial monotherapy, a common starting dose is 5 mg daily going up to 10 mg. In a large trial on mild hypertension in a middle-aged group over 4 years, amlodipine 5 mg daily was the best tolerated of the agents compared with an  $\alpha$ -blocker, β-blocker, diuretic, and ACE inhibitor. 149 In the largest outcome study, ALLHAT, amlodipine had the same primary outcome (fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease) as the diuretic and ACEinhibitor groups, but with modestly increased heart failure while decreasing new diabetes. <sup>150</sup> In another mega-trial, ASCOT-BP Lowering Arm, amlodipine usually in combination with the ACE inhibitor perindopril gave much better outcomes than a β-blocker usually combined with a diuretic. <sup>151</sup> Specifically, all cardiovascular events were decreased, including heart failure; new diabetes was less; and decreased mortality led to premature termination of the trial.

The important ACCOMPLISH trial, comparing initial antihypertensive treatment with benazepril plus amlodipine versus benazepril plus hydrochlorothiazide, was terminated early as the CCB-ACE inhibitor combination was clearly demonstrated as superior to the ACE inhibitor-diuretic combination. <sup>152</sup> Both primary and secondary endpoints were reduced by approximately 20%. For cardiovascular deaths, nonfatal MI, and nonfatal stroke, the hazard ratio was 0.79 (95% CI 0.67–0.92, P = 0.002). When matching the reductions in BP exactly, the benefits were the same. 153 The progression of nephropathy was slowed to a greater extent with this combination. 154

In hypertensive type 2 diabetics, ALLHAT showed that amlodipine was as effective as the diuretic in the relative risk of cardiovascular disease. 155 In advanced diabetic nephropathy, amlodipine

Exertional angina and coronary artery disease. Amlodipine is well tested in effort angina, with an antianginal effect for 24 hours, and often better tolerated than β-blockers. In CAMELOT, amlodipine was given for 2 years to 663 patients with angiographic CAD; amlodipine decreased cardiovascular events by 31% versus enalapril despite similar BP reduction.157,158 Although atheroma volume fell in this trial, arterial lumen dimensions were unchanged. In PRE-VENT, amlodipine given to patients with coronary angiographic disease had reduced outcome measures after 3 years.<sup>159</sup> Exerciseinduced ischemia was more effectively reduced by amlodipine than by the β-blocker atenolol, whereas ambulatory ischemia was better reduced by atenolol, and for both settings the combination was the best.<sup>160</sup> However, the CCB–β-blocker combination is often underused, though this largely reflects clinicians' concerns of using simultaneously two pharmacologic agents that possess negative chronotropic and negative inotropic effects. While the previous COURAGE Trial in stable ischemic heart disease patients found high rates of usage for aspirin, statins, and inhibitors of the reninangiotensin system as part of what the authors termed "optimal medical therapy," there were lower overall rates of usage of antianginal agents, particularly nitrates and CCBs.<sup>161</sup> Exercise-induced ischemia is at the basis of effort angina. After the anginal pain is relieved by nitrates, the EF takes approximately 30 minutes to recover, a manifestation of postischemic stunning. Amlodipine markedly attenuates such stunning,<sup>162</sup> hypothetically because cellular calcium overload underlies stunning. In Prinzmetal's vasospastic angina, another approved indication, amlodipine 5 mg daily lessens symptoms and ST changes. For cardiovascular protection in hypertension, amlodipine was the major drug in the important ASCOT study reducing strokes, total major events, and mortality.<sup>151</sup>

Contraindications, cautions, and side effects. Amlodipine has the same contraindications as other DHPs (see Fig. 1.28). It is untested in unstable angina, AMI, and during long-term follow-up in patients with ischemic heart disease. First principles strongly suggest that it should not be used in the absence of concurrent β-blockade. In heart failure, CCBs as a group are best avoided, but amlodipine may be added, for example, for better control of angina. In liver disease, the dose should be reduced. Of the side effects, peripheral edema is most troublesome, occurring in approximately 10% of patients at 10 mg daily (see Table 1.13). In women there is more edema (15%) than in men (6%). Next in significance are dizziness (3–4%) and flushing (2–3%). Compared with verapamil, edema is more common, while headache and

constipation are less common. Compared with placebo, headache is not increased (package insert). Amlodipine gave an excellent quality of life compared with other agents in the TOMH study.<sup>149</sup>

# Felodipine

Felodipine (Plendil ER) shares many of the standard properties of other long-acting DHPs. In the United States, it is only approved for hypertension in a starting dose of 5 mg once daily, then increasing to 10 mg or decreasing to 2.5 mg as needed. As monotherapy, it is approximately as effective as nifedipine. Initial felodipine monotherapy was the basis of a very large outcome study (Height of Hypertension [HOT]) in Scandinavia in which the aim was to compare BP reduction to different diastolic levels,, or 80 mmHg.<sup>163</sup> Combination with other agents such as ACE inhibitors and β-blockers was often required to attain BP treatment goals. Best results were found with the lowest BP group in diabetics, in whom hard endpoints such as cardiovascular mortality was reduced. Felodipine, like other DHPs, combines well with β-blockers.<sup>164</sup> There are two drug interactions of note: cimetidine, which increases blood felodipine levels, and anticonvulsants, which markedly decrease levels, both probably acting at the level of the hepatic enzymes. Grapefruit juice markedly inhibits the metabolism. The high vascular selectivity of felodipine led to extensive testing in heart failure, yet achieved no sustained clinical benefit in the large Ve-HeFT-III trial in which it was added to conventional vasodilator therapy.<sup>165</sup>

# Third-Generation Dihydropyridines

Third-generation DHP CCBs inhibit T-type calcium channels on vascular muscular cells such as those localized on postglomerular arterioles. The first of these agents, mibefradil, had to be withdrawn after a series of initially successful studies because of hepatic side effects. Now there is interest in a newer agent, manidipine.<sup>166</sup> In the DEMAND study on 380 subjects for a mean of 3.8 years, combined manidipine and ACE-inhibitor therapy reduced both macrovascular events and albuminuria in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whereas the ACE inhibitor did not. The proposed mechanism was reduced postglomerular resistance and decreased intraglomerular pressure. Cardioprotective effects extended beyond improved BP and metabolic control. Worsening of insulin resistance was almost fully prevented in those on combination therapy, which suggested additional effects possibly manidipinemediated activation of adipocyte peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ. The authors estimated that approximately 16 subjects had to be treated with the combined therapy to prevent one major cardiovascular event. Much larger trials are required to place the third-generation CCBs firmly on the therapeutic map.

# Summary

- 1. Spectrum of Use. CCBs are widely used in the therapy of hypertension and vasospastic angina, but are often underused in exertional angina, particularly in combination with β-blockers. The major mechanism of action is via calcium channel blockade in the arterioles, with peripheral or coronary vasodilation thereby explaining the major effects in hypertension and in effort angina. The HRL CCBs have a prominent negative inotropic effect, and inhibit the sinus and the AV nodes, which imparts also a negative chronotropic effect. These inhibitory cardiac effects are absent or muted in the DHPs, of which nifedipine is the prototype, now joined by amlodipine, felodipine, and others. Of these, amlodipine is very widely used in hypertension with proven outcome benefit. As a group, the DHPs are more vascular selective and more often used in hypertension than the HRL agents, also called the non-DHPs. Only the non-DHPs, verapamil and diltiazem, have antiarrhythmic properties by inhibiting the AV node. Both DHPs and non-DHPs are useful in the management of exertional angina and myocardial ischemia, albeit acting through different mechanisms and often underused especially in the United States.
- 2. Safety and Efficacy. Previous serious concerns about the long-term safety of the CCBs as a group have been annulled by seven large outcome studies in hypertension, with one in angina pectoris. Nonetheless, as with all drugs, cautions and contraindications as noted in the preceding sections need to be considered.
- 3. Ischemic Heart Disease. All the CCBs are effective in ameliorating both rest and exertional angina, particularly if the etiology is vasospastic in origin, and these agents are also effective in blunting myocardial ischemia with efficacy and safety rather similar to β-blockers. The largest angina outcome study, ACTION, showed the benefits of adding a long acting DHP to prior β-blockade. In unstable angina the DHPs are specifically contraindicated in the absence of β-blockade because of their tendency to vasodilation-induced reflex adrenergic activation. Although the use of the HRL non-DHPs in unstable angina is relatively well supported by data, they have in practice been supplanted by β-blockers—though, as noted previously, a vasospastic etiology would strongly favor the use of HRL CCBs

such as diltiazem or verapamil. In postinfarction patients, verapamil or diltiazem may be used if β-blockade is not tolerated or contraindicated, provided that there is no heart failure, although it is not approved for this purpose in the United States. Diltiazem has been shown to reduce first recurrent cardiac events in selected postinfarction patients, notably those with non-Q-wave MI or NSTEMI. There are insufficient trials data to support the use of DHP CCBs in postinfarction patients.

- 4. Hypertension. Strong overall evidence from a series of large outcome studies favors the safety and efficacy on hard endpoints, including coronary heart disease, of longer-acting DHPs. One large outcome study in coronary heart disease patients shows that the non-DHP verapamil gives overall results as effective as atenolol, with less new incident diabetes cases.
- 5. Diabetic Hypertension. ALLHAT showed that amlodipine was as effective as the diuretic or the ACE inhibitor in the relative risk of cardiovascular disease. Other data suggest that initial antihypertensive therapy in diabetics should be based on an ACE inhibitor or ARB, especially in those with nephropathy. To achieve current BP goals in diabetics, it is almost always necessary to use combination therapy, which would usually include an ACE inhibitor or ARB, and a CCB besides a diuretic or βblocker.
- 6. Heart Failure. Heart failure remains a general contraindication to the use of all CCBs, with two exceptions: diastolic dysfunction based on LV hypertrophy, and otherwise well-treated systolic heart failure when amlodipine may be cautiously added if needed, for example, for additional symptomatic control of angina. Diltiazem and verapamil should be avoided in patients with significantly LV systolic dysfunction (generally an EF <40% in the setting of recent, extensive Q-wave MI or STEMI), or in the setting of clinical or radiographic pulmonary congestion.

# Newer (Nontraditional) Antianginal Agents (or Metabolic and Other Nontraditional Antianginal Agents)

In addition to the standard pharmacotherapy drug classes that include beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and nitrates, several newer antianginal therapies are now available for the symptomatic treatment of both angina and myocardial ischemia. These include ranolazine, trimetazadine, ivabradine, and nicorandil, which are detailed in the following section.

# Ranolazine

Ranolazine is an inhibitor of late sodium channel influx (late INa) during repolarization (Fig. 1.30). This reduces intracellular sodium concentrations, which, in turn, lowers intracellular calcium concentrations, which results in lower ventricular diastolic wall tension, a reduction in oxygen consumption, and improvement in angina symptoms. In addition, ranolazine is believed to be a partial fatty acid oxidation inhibitor with a resultant attenuation of oxidative stress.<sup>108</sup> Ranolazine reduces angina without any significant reductions in heart rate, BP, or rate-pressure product during exercise and is hemodynamically neutral, thus making it a useful therapeutic option in patients who are at risk of hypotension or bradycardia with the use or uptitration of traditional antianginals. Ranolazine also prolongs the ventricular action potential and QTc interval through inhibition of the rapid delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr) in a dose-dependent manner. Ranolazine alone,

Fig. 1.30 Novel antianginal agents work in different ways. If inhibition by ivabradine increases myocardial oxygen demand by decreasing the heart rate. Ranolazine decreases the inflow of sodium by the slow sodium current during ischemia and thereby lessens the intracellular sodium and calcium load. Perhexiline inhibits free fatty acid (FFA) oxidation at the level of the enzyme CPT-1. Trimetazidine inhibits fatty acid oxidation at the level of the mitochondrial long-chain oxidation and, in addition, improves wholebody insulin sensitivity. (Figure © L. H. Opie, 2012.)

or as combination therapy with β-blockers or CCBs, significantly decreases the frequency of angina and NTG use, improves exercise duration and delays the onset of ST depression during exercise (MARISA, CARISA, and ERICA).

In a randomized, double-blind trial of 6566 patients with non-ST elevation MI who were managed with either ranolazine or placebo in addition to the background therapy, 167 ranolazine was not associated with a significant decrease in the primary composite end-point of cardiovascular death, MI between the two groups (21.8% ranolazine versus 23.5% placebo, P = 0.11). However, recurrent ischemia was significantly reduced in the ranolazine group (13.9% versus 16.1% for placebo, P = 0.03). <sup>168</sup> Furthermore, despite a small increase in QTc, there was no significant increase in documented arrhythmia (3.0% versus 3.1%, P = 0.84), supporting the safety of this medication. 168 In a prespecified analysis, the authors of the MERLIN-TIMI 36 trial evaluated the antianginal efficacy of ranolazine in a large subgroup of over 5500 patients with chronic angina who presented with ACS, and showed that ranolazine compared to placebo was associated with significant reduction in the primary composite end-point of cardiovascular death, MI, or recurrent ischemia. 169 These findings from MERLIN-TIMI 36 trial demonstrate that ranolazine is an effective antianginal agent but does not reduce mortality. 169 In patients with diabetes mellitus, ranolazine has demonstrated significant reductions in HbA1c, thus making it an appealing option for managing angina in these patients. 110,11f In a post hoc analysis of the CARISA trial, there was a  $0.48\% \pm 0.18\%$  (P = 0.008) reduction in HbA1c with 750 mg twice-daily dosing and a  $0.70\% \pm 0.18\%$  (P = 0.0002) reduction in HbA1c with 1000 mg twice-daily dosing when compared to placebo after 12 weeks of therapy. 110 Additionally, as a part of the MERLIN-TIMI 36 trial, the patients with diabetes treated with ranolazine had a significant reduction in HbA1c, had a greater likelihood of having an HbA1c <7% at 4 months, and were less likely to have a  $\geq$ 1% increase in HbA1c at 1 year. <sup>111</sup>A recent randomized controlled trial, the Type 2 Diabetes Evaluation of Ranolazine in Subjects with Chronic Stable Angina (TERISA), enrolled 949 patients with diabetes, CAD, and stable angina who were being treated with one to two antianginals at baseline to treatment with ranolazine or placebo. <sup>170</sup> Ranolazine was found to significantly lower weekly angina frequency and weekly sublingual nitroglycerin use. 170

Trimetazidine. Widely used as an antianginal drug in Europe but not in the United States or United Kingdom. It is a partial inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation without hemodynamic effects. Short-term clinical studies have demonstrated significant benefits including a reduction in weekly angina episodes and improved exercise time, but large, long-term trials are needed. <sup>171</sup> In diabetic patients with CAD, trimetazidine decreased blood glucose, increased forearm glucose uptake, and improved endothelial function. <sup>172</sup> An interesting proposal is that, because it acts independently of any BP reduction, it could be used as an antianginal in those with erectile dysfunction in place of nitrates to allow free use of sildenafil and similar agents.

There is increasingly strong evidence that trimetazidine may also be useful in the treatment of chronic systolic heart failure 173 secondary to improvements in myocardial energetics. In heart failure, added trimetazidine gives benefit to conventional therapy including β-blockades and RAS inhibition. <sup>174</sup> In a small series of neurologic patients, treatment with trimetazidine worsened previously diagnosed Parkinson disease, <sup>175</sup> which should become a contraindication to its use.

**Ivabradine.** (*Procoralan*) is a blocker of the pacemaker current I<sub>f</sub>, and hence does not act directly on the metabolism but indirectly by decreasing the heart rate and thus the metabolic demand of the heart. Its antianginal potency is similar to that of  $\beta$ -blockade  $^{176}$ and amlodipine. There is no negative inotropic effect or BP reduction as with β-blockers, nor is there any rebound on cessation of therapy. 178 Ivabradine is licensed in the United Kingdom and other European countries for use in angina when β-blockers are not tolerated or are contradicted. In practice, it may be combined with βblockade with clinical benefit, <sup>179</sup> but in this study the β-blocker was not upwardly titrated to achieve maximal heart rate reduction. Theoretically there is less risk of severe sinus node depression than with β-blockade because only one of several pacemaker currents is blocked, whereas  $\beta$ -blockade affects all. The downside is that the current  $I_f$  is also found in the retina, so that there may be disturbance of nocturnal vision with flashing lights (phosphenes) 180 that could impair driving at night and is often transient. In heart failure patients, the SHIFT study established the clinical benefits of ivabradine in a group of patients with moderate systolic heart failure whose heart rates remained elevated despite β-blockade, <sup>181</sup> though here is some controversy as to whether adequate β-blocker doses had been used during the conduct of the trial. Only 23% of the patients were at trial-established target doses and only half were receiving 50% or more of the targeted β-blocker dose.

**Nicorandil.** (not approved for use in the United States) Has a double cellular mechanism of action, acting both as a potassium channel activator and having a nitrate-like effect, which may explain why experimentally it causes less tolerance than nitrates. It is a nicotinamide nitrate, acting chiefly by dilation of the large coronary arteries, as well as by reduction of pre- and afterload. It is widely used as an antianginal agent in Japan. In the IONA study, 5126 patients with stable angina were followed for a mean of 1.6 years. Major coronary events including ACS were reduced. 183

# Summary

## A. Nitrates:

- 1. Mechanisms of action. Nitrates act by venodilation and relief of coronary vasoconstriction (including that induced by exercise) to ameliorate anginal attacks. They are also arterial dilators and reduce aortic systolic pressure. Their unloading effects also benefit patients with heart failure with high LV filling pressures.
- 2. Intermittent nitrates for exertional angina. Sublingual nitroglycerin remains the basic therapy, usually combined with a β-blocker, a CCB, or both with careful assessment of lifestyle, BP, and blood lipid profile. As the duration of action lasts for minutes, nitrate tolerance is unusual because of the relatively long nitrate-free intervals between attacks. Intermittent isosorbide dinitrate has a delayed onset of action because of the need for hepatic transformation to active metabolites, while the duration of action is longer than with nitroglycerin.
- 3. For angina prophylaxis. Both short-acting and long-acting nitrates can be used effectively in advance of exertional angina precipitants and can play important roles in angina prophylaxis. Short-acting sublingual nitroglycerin or nitrolingual spray administered several minutes in advance of a known angina trigger may prevent exertional attacks.
- 4. For unstable angina at rest or early-phase acute MI. A nitrate-free interval is not possible, and short-term treatment for 24 to 48 hours with intravenous nitroglycerin is frequently effective; however, escalating doses are often required to overcome tolerance. Intravenous nitroglycerin in acute MI may be beneficial in enhancing coronary collateral flow, and in the setting of heart failure or increased LV filling pressures (or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure), intravenous nitroglycerin may increase venous capacitance and decrease preload.
- 5. Treatment of heart failure. Nitrates may effectively lower preload and reduce pulmonary congestion, though tolerance may also develop with chronic use. Isosorbide dinitrate combined with hydralazine may be of benefit in heart failure with or without ACE inhibitor therapy. A proprietary combination (BiDil) is approved for heart failure in patients who self-identify as African-American.
- 6. Nitrate tolerance. The current understanding of the mechanism tolerance focuses on free radical formation (superoxide and peroxy nitrite) with impaired bioconversion of nitrate to active NO• . During the treatment of effort angina

by isosorbide dinitrate or mononitrate, substantial evidence suggests that eccentric doses with a nitrate-free interval largely avoid clinical tolerance, but endothelial dysfunction remains a long-term hazard. Besides addition of hydralazine (see previous discussion), other, less well-tested measures include administration of antioxidants, statins, ACE inhibitors, and folic acid. Increasing data show that endothelial dysfunction, in which aldehyde formation plays a role, is incriminated in nitrate tolerance. Coadministration with carvedilol or possibly nebivolol as the β-blockers of choice should help to prevent or delay tolerance, yet prospective clinical trials are lacking.

7. Interaction with PDE-5 inhibitors. Nitrates can interact very adversely with such agents, which are now often used to alleviate erectile dysfunction. The latter is common in those with cardiovascular disease, being a manifestation of endothelial dysfunction. The coadministration of these PDE-5 inhibitors with nitrates is therefore contraindicated. If any of these agents has been used, there has to be an interval of 24–48 hours (the longer interval for tadalafil) before nitrates can be given therapeutically with reasonable safety but still with great care.
