# Drug Class Overview and Guidelines

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, heterogenous family of disease states marked by pathologic remodeling of the pulmonary vascular system, leading to increased pulmonary artery pressure and ultimately right ventricular failure, hypoxia, and death.1 Unlike the majority of pulmonary hypertension in the United States, which is secondary to either chronic lung disease or chronic left ventricular dysfunction,2,3 PAH is thought to be a primary disease of the vasculature itself, triggered by an array of etiologic agents, including connective tissue disease, drugs or toxins, infections, genetic triggers among others, or is idiopathic in approximately 40% of cases.4,5

# Pathobiology of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension

Historically neglected due to its relatively rare prevalence, insights into the pathophysiology of PAH have led to a steady influx therapies for patients over the past two decades. Most of these therapies that primarily work by specific pulmonary vasodilation have been developed based on a now classical view of PAH characterized by a mismatch between vasodilatory and vasoconstrictive molecules in the pulmonary arteriolar tree. An important vasodilator, nitric oxide (NO), has long been identified as a key regulatory molecule in PAH.<sup>6</sup> NO is decreased in the pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) of diseased patients. A lack of NO triggers both loss of vasorelaxation mediated by cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) as well as smooth muscle cell proliferation.7,8 Endothelin-1 (ET-1), a vasoconstricting small peptide is a second molecule implicated in PAH pathobiology. ET-1 has been shown to be overexpressed in PAECs of PAH patients.9,10 Prostacyclin, a potent vasodilatory prostanoid, is a third important vasoactive small molecule. Prostacyclin, via cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), normally vasodilates smooth muscle cells but is decreased in afflicted patients. <sup>11</sup>

Most of the mainstays of modern PAH pharmacologic therapy operate via one of the pathways previously discussed. More recently, discoveries in the basic science of the disease are driving interest in new drug classes aimed at targeting the disordered and proliferative aspects of diseased arterioles in PAH. Development of these drugs are in various stages of implementation.

# **Updates in the Clinical Classification of PAH**

The World Health Organization (WHO) organized the first World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension (WSPH) in 1973. 12 Since that time, pulmonary hypertension has been invariably defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) ≥25 mmHg. PAH, or WHO group 1 disease, requires not only mPAP >25 mmHg but also the presence of precapillary pulmonary hypertension with pulmonary vascular resistance >3 Wood units in the absence of alternative causes of precapillary disease such as chronic thromboembolic disease, lung disease, or select rare other causes not considered to be group 1 etiologic agents. At the sixth WSPH in 2018, however, the definition of pulmonary hypertension and PAH was changed. It is now recommended that a lower mPAP cutoff of >20 mmHg now be used to define pulmonary hypertension and PAH. 13 This change was made to better reflect the understanding that the typical upper limit of normal for mPAP is lower than the traditional 25 mmHg as endorsed by the older definition 14 and mPAP >20 mmHg is associated with worse clinical outcomes. As of this writing, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology PAH guidelines have not been revised to reflect the new WHO-endorsed position.<sup>15</sup> It is also unclear whether this new definition should drive the use of pulmonary vasodilator drugs in this population of formerly "borderline" PAH patients.

In addition to the change in PAH definition, three new oral agents have become available for treatment of PAH since 2013. Riociguat is a first-in-class soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator that was approved in 2013. Riociguat achieves its augmented vasodilation via the NO-cGMP pathway. Later that same year, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved an oral form of the prostanoid treprostinil (treprostinil diolamine) for use in PAH patients. Finally, in 2015, selexipag, a nonprostanoid oral prostacyclin (PGI<sub>2</sub>) receptor (IP receptor) agonist, was approved for use to delay disease progression and reduce risk of hospitalization in PAH.

## History and the Modern Era of PAH Therapy

"I would comment now upon the clinical picture of pure right ventricular failure. Usually one sees it secondary to failure of the left side, or the case is one of mitral disease with embarrassment of the pulmonary circulation... It is rare in my experience to witness such a pure and rapidly progressive failure of the right ventricle."

— Dr. Terence East, London, 1940, describing a series of three young women with rapidly fatal PAH.<sup>16</sup>

PAH was traditionally an invariably progressive and often fatal condition. Although it remains incurable (except by lung transplantation), PAH has become viewed in more recent years a more manageable chronic condition that can be marked by long periods of clinical stability. This is in large part due to the number of agents now available for patients with PAH and the expansion of dedicated PAH comprehensive care centers with expert multidisciplinary teams dedicated to this disease.

The modern era of PAH therapy began in the mid-1990s with the remarkable success of intravenous prostacyclin. In a landmark 1996 study including 81 patients with PAH followed for only 12 weeks, intravenous epoprostenol was associated with a reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance, 6-minute walk test (6MWT) distance, and mortality—100% of epoprostenol patients were alive at study end versus 80% in the control group.17 Prior to the epoprostenol era, registry data of patients with idiopathic PAH showed a 1-year and 5-year survival of 68% and 34%, respectively.18,19 These figures have slowly improved over the years. Over a decade later, results from the Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-term Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Disease Management (REVEAL Registry) showed that the 1- and 5-year survival for idiopathic PAH patients had improved to 91% and 65%, respectively.20

## Prostanoids

The first truly efficacious therapy in PAH, the prostanoid class of medications has now grown to include medications available in four routes of administration: intravenous, subcutaneous, inhaled, and oral.

Approved in 1996 on the basis of the randomized trial described previously, epoprostenol is the prototypical example of a vasodilatory agent used in PAH. Available only in intravenous formulation, epoprostenol has two available preparations: Flolan and Veletri, the latter designed to have enhanced room temperature stability.

Treprostinil is a synthetic prostanoid that is now available for use intravenously or subcutaneously (Remodulin), via inhalation (Tyvaso), or orally (Orenitram). Like epoprostenol, treprostinil is a potent pulmonary vasodilator. It is distinguished from epoprostenol by its much longer half-life (4 hours versus 2.7 minutes for epoprostenol) and greater flexibility with respect to route of administration

Approved in 2004, and only available in inhaled formation, *Iloprost* is the third currently available prostanoid for the treatment of PAH. It is marketed under the trade name Ventavis.

While not a true prostanoid by molecular structure, *Selexipag* (Uptravi) is an IP receptor antagonist, administered orally, and approved for use since 2015.

#### **Endothelin Receptor Antagonists (ERAs)**

With action against the ET-1 receptor, there are three ERAs currently available for use: *bosentan* (Tracleer), *ambrisentan* (Letaris), and *macitentan* (Opsumit). All are oral agents and have been proven efficacious in improving hemodynamics and symptoms in PAH.

## Phosphodiesterase Type 5 Inhibitors (PDE-5is)

Orally taken, the PDE-5is vasodilate the pulmonary circulation via augmentation of the cGMP pathway. Two agents are available for use in the US, *sildenafil* (Revatio) and *tadalafil* (Adcirca). Vardenafil has been studied for use in a PAH population but is not approved for use in PAH by the FDA.

Closely related to PDE-5is are the sGC stimulators, of which the recently approved oral agent *riociguat* (Adempas) is the only approved agent.

#### Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs)

Off-label use of CCBs, particularly *diltiazem* and *niledipine*, and occasionally *amlodipine*, has long had a role in PAH, specifically in those with a positive vasoreactivity study on right heart catheterization. To perform such a study, an operator with experience in PAH would place a pulmonary artery catheter in position, then administer a vasodilator, typically inhaled NO, intravenous epoprostenol, adenosine, or sodium nitroprusside. A drop in mPAP of  $\geq \! 10 \, \text{mmHg}$  to a mPAP of  $\leq \! 40 \, \text{mmHg}$  with stable cardiac output is defined as a positive vasoreactivity test. Approximately 5%–10% of treatment naïve patients will have a positive vasoreactivity test—a figure that may be higher in idiopathic PAH patients.  $^{22-24}$  A 2010 analysis of approximately 2400 registry patients showed that 8.7% took CCBs specifically for PAH, a number that is consistent with the expected prevalence of positive vasoreactivity studies.  $^{25}$ 

## Guidelines

#### Rationale and General Principles

In general, more aggressive therapy, including parental medications, is reserved for patients with more advanced and higher-risk disease. Correctly matching PAH therapy to a patient requires a careful and complete physiologic and historical assessment. Diligent evaluation of PAH patients, both at index presentation and longitudinally, is essential. The most important historical element is the patient's level of functioning. Often referred to as the WHO functional class (FC), it is modeled on the frequently used New York Heart Association functional status.26 Briefly, FC I patients have no functional limitation. FC II patients have a slight impairment in physical activity, where ordinary causes symptoms such as dyspnea, chest pain, fatigue, or presyncope. FC III patients recall symptoms with less than ordinary daily activity, and FC IV patients are either symptomatic at rest, often with signs of overt right heart failure.

Patients with PAH often suffer from delayed diagnosis, meaning it is not unusual for PAH patients to first present with severe disease and advanced symptoms. In one study, a series of retrospective interviews with PAH patients revealed that patients averaged 5.3 general practitioner visits and 3.0 specialist visits prior to being seen in a PAH referral center—a process that took 47 months on average.<sup>27</sup> In REVEAL, 61% of patients were FC III at the time of diagnostic right heart catheterization and 12% suffered from FC IV.<sup>25</sup>

Initial workup of PAH will include detailed history and physical examination to determine the WHO functional class and assess for signs of right ventricular failure, including syncope, ascites, and edema. An electrocardiogram and echocardiogram are included in the initial evaluation of all patients.28 At times, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be helpful in quantifying the level of right ventricular dysfunction.29–<sup>31</sup> In patients in whom initial evaluation raises concern for PAH, and in patients with established disease but a change in clinical status, a right heart catheterization is required.1,15

### Risk Stratification

The evaluation of the PAH patient should allow for risk stratification. Patients with more significant functional limitation are higher risk. In addition, patients with so-called "sentinel events" such as hospital admission, intensification of PAH therapy, decrease in 6MWT distance by 15%, or worsening WHO FC should be given heightened scrutiny, as these morbidity events have been shown to be predictive of incident mortality.32

The 2015 European Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society (ESC/ERS) guidelines proposed a simple low/ moderate/high risk framework based on history, laboratory, and hemodynamic assessment (Table 11.1). Patients in the highest risk category should be considered for aggressive escalation of therapy.

## Patients With Positive Vasoreactivity Studies

Guidelines support vasoreactivity testing during right heart catheterization in select patients with an initial diagnosis of PAH.1,15,33 Contraindications include low blood pressure, reduced cardiac output, a diagnosis of pulmonary vasoocclusive disease, or pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PVOD or PCH), as these patients may not tolerate an acute vasodilator challenge. Patients with FC IV would not be candidates for a trial of CCB even if vasoreactivity test were positive; therefore, it is of questionable utility to proceed with such testing in these patients.

For the 5%–10% of patients who do respond to vasodilator challenge and have FC II or III symptoms, current guidelines suggest a trial of CCB as initial therapy, with early repeat catheterization in 3 months to assess for response. Required doses are typically high; up to 240mg for nifedipine, 20mg for amlodipine, and 720mg for diltiazem. Verapamil is not typically used or recommended for use in this indication, mostly over concern (perhaps based more on experience than data34) that verapamil is more potent negative inotrope than the other CCBs, including diltiazem.

Multiple concerns have been voiced for the use of long-term CCB in the PAH population. Most acutely, there is concern for the lack of direct evidence of benefit in the modern vasodilator therapy era, along with the theoretical risk of worsening inotropy on high-dose CCBs.22,23

## Asymptomatic Patients

Patients without symptoms (WHO FC I) at diagnosis represent a rare clinical scenario. Current guidelines suggest close monitoring for the development of symptoms while withholding active therapy.<sup>33</sup> In such cases, careful examination, history, and functional testing may be required to determine if patients are truly asymptomatic. Occasionally, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, either invasive or noninvasive, may be considered to provide an objective assessment of severity of functional limitation and may be of use in borderline cases.<sup>35</sup>

#### Initial Combination Therapy

From the early 1990s until 2004, all PAH clinical drug trials tested single drug regimens against placebo or alternatives.<sup>36</sup> It was not

until the BREATHE-2 trial, which compared epoprostenol plus bosentan to epoprostenol plus placebo in patients with WHO FC III or IV, that initial combination therapy was rigorously tested. Although it did not show significant difference in hemodynamics or clinical status, BREATHE-2 was an important first step toward initial combination therapy in treatment naïve individuals, and led the way for the AMBITION trial, published in 2015. Comprised of patients with WHO FC II and III on no current PAH therapy, AMBITION was a three-armed protocol that randomized patients to ambrisentan plus tadalafil combination therapy or to each drug (plus placebo) alone. In contrast to BREATHE-2, AMBITION showed a marked reduction in a combined clinical endpoint of all-cause mortality, PAH hospitalization, and disease progression.

The 2015 ESC/ERS guidelines make no value judgment on starting combination therapy versus monotherapy in treatment naïve patients presenting with FC II or III, <sup>1</sup> citing the possible benefit of combination therapy seen in AMBITION but also the potential for increased drug interactions and side effects with upfront combination therapy. In contrast, the 2019 update to the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guideline now recommends initial combination ambrisentan plus tadalafil for patients with FC II and III, <sup>33</sup> reflecting the advancing acceptance of the overall benefit profile of upfront combination therapy. This represents a change from the 2014 guidelines <sup>39</sup> and is given a grade of weak recommendation with moderate quality of evidence. Tables 11.2<sup>1,40</sup> and 11.3 outline selected regimens for initial combination therapy as supported by current guidelines and expert consensus.

## **Initial Monotherapy**

Starting monotherapy in treatment naïve PAH patients, then adding additional agents sequentially based on patient response and tolerability is the more traditional approach to the management of PAH—albeit a decreasingly popular choice in light of the AMBI-TION trial data. In general, patients presenting with WHO FC II or III symptoms are recommended to begin with oral therapy; parenteral therapy is reserved for WHO functional class IV patients and those with high-risk features (Table 11.4). In the 2019 ACCP guidelines, the same therapy might have several different recommendation grades for a particular WHO FC, as the guidelines' authors may provide a separate recommendation grade for multiple outcomes. For example, there may be two recommendations provided for one particular drug: one for the endpoint of improving 6MWT and one for improving functional class. The summary information in Table 11.4 records the strongest recommendation given for each drug.

Several key differences exist among the presently offered expert guidelines. The ACCP currently recommends starting an intravenous or subcutaneous prostanoid (epoprostenol or treprostinil) in patients with FC IV and issue no recommendation for oral agents in this scenario. The ESC/ERS guidelines do issue recommendations for specific oral agents as monotherapy in FC IV; however, these guidelines also make a statement recommending upfront combination therapy that includes an intravenous or subcutaneous prostanoid in such patients.

### Sequential Therapy

For patients already started on initial monotherapy, a common strategy for treatment of PAH consists of short interval reassessment of symptoms and risk (Table 11.1) with consideration of sequential addition of therapies. This has been the approach often taken in the trial literature as well, where novel agents are often tested when added to established medications.

ACCP, American College of Chest Physicians; ESC/ERS, European Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society; IV, intravenous; SC, subcutaneous; UC, ungraded, consensus-based statement of recommendation; WHO FC, World Health Organization Functional Class.

In patients who continue to be symptomatic on stable doses of an ERA or PDE-5i, the addition of inhaled iloprost or inhaled treprostinil is guideline-supported. Riociguat is recommended as an addition to bosentan, ambrisentan, or inhaled prostanoid. Macitentan receives a recommendation as an addition to symptomatic patients on stable doses of a PDE-5i or inhaled prostanoid, and tadalafil as add-on therapy to ambrisentan.

In practice, drugs within a class are often substituted for each other, based on side effect profiles, availability or formulary access, and cost. This is done with the presumption that class effects may be interchangeable to varying degrees, but evidence does exist regarding the specific nature of activity of single drugs independent of drug class as well.

# Mechanisms of Action

A mechanistic overview for important pathways of action for PAH drugs is shown in Fig. 11.1.

### Prostanoids

Prostanoids were first indirectly described in the 1960s upon the discovery of a vasoactive substance that was downregulated by administration of aspirin.<sup>41</sup> Prostanoids were subsequently characterized as a family of 20-carbon eicosanoids (from the Greek είκοσι—"twenty") derived from arachidonic acid via oxygenation by cyclooxygenase (COX). The prostanoid family includes PGI2, thromboxane A2, and the prostaglandins, among other molecules. Most prostanoids share a five-carbon ring base with attached fattyacid derived chains.<sup>42</sup> In the pulmonary hypertension literature, the term "prostanoid" refers almost exclusively to PGI2, or epoprostenol, and a number of synthetic stable PGI2 analogues, including treprostinil and iloprost. PGI2 was discovered in 1976, and within 5 years its use was described in a patient with idiopathic PAH.<sup>42</sup> The potent vasodilatory properties of PGI2 were recognized early on,<sup>43</sup> but a wealth of evidence now exists suggesting that beyond providing vasodilation to improve pulmonary vascular resistance, prostanoids have a wide array of other disease modifying effects.<sup>44</sup>

PGI2 and its analogues bind the IP receptor on the cell surface membrane. Once engaged, the IP receptor couples the G-protein Gs and activates adenylyl cyclase, producing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and leading to relaxation in smooth muscle cells and antithrombosis in platelets.<sup>44</sup> Like PGI2, treprostinil engages the IP receptor, but also demonstrates strong affinity to the EP2 and DP1 cell surface receptors. Ex vivo study indicates that

Fig. 11.1 Mechanisms of action for currently approved drugs for pulmonary arterial hypertension in the pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (PASMC) and pulmonary artery endothelial cell (PAEC). Both prostanoids and prostacyclin receptor agonists engage the prostacyclin receptor (IP), which couples with the G-protein Gs to activate adenylyl cyclase (AC), thus converting adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and causing vasorelaxation via activated protein kinase A. Moreover, prostanoids may provide proapoptotic effect via upregulation of transcription of the gene Fast. Both the phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE-5is) and soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) stimulators enhance vasorelaxation via the nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (NO-cGMP) pathway. Stimulated sGC increases production of cGMP from guanosine triphosphate (GTP), and inhibition of PDE-5i prevents hydrolysis of cGMP to guanosine monophosphate (GMP). The endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) oppose the action of endothelin-1 (ET-1) on its receptors, ETA and ETB. Both endothelin receptors have mitogenic and proliferative effects in PASMCs. Additionally, vasoconstriction is promoted via the production of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) from hydrolysis of the phospholipid PIP<sub>2</sub>. In the PAEC, ET<sub>B</sub> is vasodilatory via the NO and prostacyclin (PGI<sub>2</sub>) pathways; however, the net effect of ET<sub>B</sub> activation in the pulmonary vasculature is vasoconstrictive.

the latter may have an increased role in dilation of pulmonary veins in addition to arteries; the clinical relevance of this finding is unclear.  $^{45}$  lloprost has also been shown to have action at the EP<sub>4</sub> receptor, an additional pathway of vasodilation.  $^{46}$  Such a finding may be important therapeutically, as there is some evidence that

patients with PAH have downregulated IP receptors, perhaps reducing their susceptibility to treatment with prostacyclin/epoprostenol.  $^{47}$ 

Beyond vasodilation,  $PGI_2$  also has proapoptotic properties via the IP receptor. This is particularly important given the recent attention given to the "cancer theory" of PAH. *BMPR2*, the most important gene identified in hereditary PAH,  $^{49-51}$  has been implicated in dysregulation and proliferation (antiapoptosis) in diseased pulmonary artery endothelial cells.  $^{52,53}$  Important activities are also held by the growth factors PDGF and VEGF, as well as a shift from oxidative metabolism to glycolysis in processes mirroring cancer pathogenesis.  $^{54,55}$  There is evidence that prostanoids may directly interrupt some of these processes and may enhance apoptosis. Treprostinil, for example, has been shown to reduce PDGF-related proliferative signaling.  $^{56}$ 

While not a prostanoid, selexipag also exerts its effects via the IP receptor. Selexipag is an orally available prodrug of MRE-269, a highly selective IP receptor agonist with a half-life of approximately 8 hours. <sup>56</sup> Unlike epoprostenol, treprostinil, and iloprost, selexipag does not appear to engage prostanoid receptors other than the IP receptor. <sup>44,57,58</sup>

# **Phosphodiesterase Type 5 Inhibitors**

Selective PDE-5is leverage the action of endogenous NO in the cells of smooth muscle and other tissues. NO is produced in endothelial cells from L-arginine via NO synthase. <sup>59</sup> A small molecule, NO diffuses into smooth muscle adjacent to endothelial cells where it binds to sGC, stimulating production of cGMP from guanosine triphosphate. cGMP has potent vasodilatory effects by decreasing intracellular calcium concentration, leading to lower smooth muscle tone. It is rapidly hydrolyzed by PDE-5. The two currently approved PDE-5is for the treatment of PAH, sildenafil and tadalafil, both function to selectively inhibit PDE-5, thus augmenting the availability of cGMP and leading to vasorelaxation. <sup>60</sup>

PDE-5is can cause a certain degree of nondiscriminate vasodilation in both arterial and venous systems in healthy subjects. <sup>61</sup> However, affinity for the pulmonary circulation has been described in patients with PAH. <sup>62</sup> An early hemodynamic study found, for example, that pulmonary systolic pressures decreased over twice as much as systemic systolic pressures (14 mmHg versus 5.9 mmHg) after 3 months of sildenafil treatment in PAH patients. <sup>63</sup> The underlying reason for this is only partially clear. It has been proposed that atrial natriuretic peptide, found in increased concentration in PAH patients, may act synergistically with the NO-cGMP pathway to selective vasodilate the pulmonary circulation. <sup>64,65</sup>

Like prostanoids, there is evidence that PDE-5is have important disease-modifying effects outside of vasodilation. One intriguing possibility is that PDE-5is may improve dysfunctional signaling in PAH patients with abnormal bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). Pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells carrying loss-offunction mutations in BMPR2 tend to become proproliferative via decreased and/or altered BMP and SMAD 1/5/8 signalling. In a BMPR2 knockout animal model, sildenafil has been shown to prevent development of PAH and partially restore SMAD signaling.68

Riociguat, the only available sGC stimulator, has a mechanism closely related to PDE-5is, in that it is active directly via the NOcGMP pathway. The original synthesis of riociguat was propelled by the discovery in the 1990s that YC-1, a related compound originally discovered as a synthetic benzylindazole antiplatelet agent, had sGC stimulatory properties. <sup>69,70</sup> Riociguat binds sGC and increases production of cGMP from GTP in a NO-independent manner. Synergism with NO is also possible. In vitro, sGC activity is increased 122-fold by riociguat in the presence of NO, and 73-fold when riociguat acts alone.7

# **Endothelin Receptor Antagonists**

A potent vasoconstrictor, ET-1 is a 21-amino-acid peptide overexpressed in patients with PAH. ET-1 is produced mainly in endothelial cells—it is not stored and both transcription its mRNA and ET-1 itself have relative short half-lives (10-20 minutes), meaning that ET-1 levels may fluctuate in response to a myriad stimulators.<sup>72</sup> Notable stimuli include hypoxia, ischemia, shear stress. ET-1 has two cellular targets relevant to PAH therapeutics. Endothelin receptor A (ET<sub>A</sub>) is found on the surface of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, while endothelin receptor B (ET<sub>B</sub>) is found both on pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells.<sup>60</sup>

ET-1 has mitogenic properties via both ET<sub>A</sub> and ET<sub>B</sub>; the overall effect is to increase extracellular matrix proliferation as well as potentiation of growth factors such as TGF-β. On the smooth muscle cell, the binding of ET-1 to both ET<sub>A</sub> and ET<sub>B</sub> activates phospholipase C and promotes vasoconstriction via production of inositol triphosphate, which raises intracellular calcium. The vasoactive effects of ET<sub>B</sub> on endothelial cells are more complex. ET-1 binding endothelial cells may increase NO production, leading to vasorelaxation. However, the vasodilatory properties of ET-1, acting at the ET<sub>B</sub> receptor, appear to be impaired in PAHafflicted patients. <sup>60</sup> In sum, the net effect of ET-1 on the pulmonary circulation is vasoconstriction and cellular proliferation.

# Differences Among Drugs in Class

The full list of currently available PAH-specific drug therapies approved for use in the United States is presented in Table 11.5. Specific and important intraclass differences between agents are discussed later.

## Prostanoids

With three agents, four routes of administration, and multiple formulations available for epoprostenol, prostanoids may lead to some confusion among patients and providers not accustomed to PAH therapy. Prostanoids are available in oral, intravenous, subcutaneous, and inhaled forms, making it the only class of PAH medications that is available with more than one route of administration. Table 11.617,77–<sup>91</sup> compares pharmacologic profiles of available agents in this class.

#### Epoprostenol: Flolan Versus Veletri

Epoprostenol is available in two formulations, usually referred to by their US trade names, Flolan (GlaxoSmithKline) and Veletri (Actelion).92 Epoprostenol as a PAH therapy was approved in 1995. Formulated with glycine-mannitol excipients, reconstituted Flolan has stability at room temperature for up to 8 hours. This can be extended for up to 24 hours with the use of ice packs; however, the need for refrigeration beyond this time causes some logistical difficulties with administration, especially for patients on home therapy.<sup>93</sup> Veletri, which uses arginine-mannitol excipients at a higher pH, was approved by the FDA in 2008 on the basis of having an identical active ingredient to Flolan. Although rigorous preapproval testing of the new formulation was not required prior to approval, small postmarketing studies have shown equivalence of Flolan and Veletri with respect to tolerability, effect, and bioavailability.94,95

#### Epoprostenol Versus Parenteral Treprostinil

The synthetic prostanoid treprostinil has a similar mechanism of action and side effect profile to epoprostenol.<sup>96</sup> Initially formulated as a subcutaneous infusion to reduce risk associated with indwelling central catheters and approved in 2002, treprostinil is additionally distinguished from epoprostenol by its much longer half-life. Since initial approval, an intravenous form has been made available. Reconstituted treprostinil has excellent stability at room temperature and may be stored for up to 14 days once mixed with

IV, intravenous; SC, subcutaneous.

proper dilutents.<sup>97</sup> At the molecular level, epoprostenol and treprostinil have similar structure and engage similar targets.

The half-life of treprostinil is approximately 4.5 hours, but the effective half-life may be shorter. Based on bioavailability studies, it appears that subcutaneous and intravenous treprostinil have dosing equivalence through the normal therapeutic range (up to 125 ng/kg/min). There may be some depot effect from subcutaneous administration of treprostinil such that the drug serum concentration takes longer to decline as compared to intravenous administration, but this difference does not appear to be clinically meaningful.

Unlike epoprostenol, which is spontaneously metabolized, treprostinil is extensively cleared by the cytochrome P450 system in the liver. Strong modifiers of CYP2C8 should be used with caution in patients receiving treatment with treprostinil. Intravenous and subcutaneous treprostinil should be dose-reduced in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment; no studies have been done in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Patients with liver dysfunction are more vulnerable to toxicity with treprostinil diolamine (oral treprostinil) due to lack of normal first past metabolism. As a result, treprostinil diolamine should be dose-reduced in patients with Child-Pugh A hepatic dysfunction and should be avoided and is contraindicated in Child-Pugh B and C disease.

#### Inhaled Treprostinil Versus Inhaled Iloprost

Inhaled iloprost is designed to be administered in a specially made delivery device. For patients who self-administer iloprost at home, some dexterity is required in order to break the vials storing the medication and pipette the contents into the delivery device, which may need to be done several times per day depending on dosage.  $^{102}$  Inhaled treprostinil is delivered via an ultrasonic pulsed-delivery device that meters out 6  $\mu g$  of drug per inhalation. The device is loaded each morning with treprostinil from an ampule by the patient.  $^{103}$  The longer half-life of treprostinil allows for QID dosing, as compared to up to nine times daily for iloprost.  $^{100}$

Table 11.7 summarizes the important differences between the two available PDE-5is. The primary difference between sildenafil and tadalfil is pharmacokinetics and elimination half-life. Sildelafil is extensively metabolized by the liver, mostly by CYP3A4, and to a lesser extent CYP2C9. <sup>104</sup> Its half-life of 4 hours is substantially short than that of tadalfil (15 hours). Both PDE-5is are metabolized by the liver, predominantly by CYP3A4. While use of both appear safe in

# Endothelin Receptor Antagonists

Key considerations in the use of the three available ERAs are summarized in Table 11.8. Bosentan, the first ERA to market in the United States, is dosed twice daily, with a shorter half-life than either ambrisentan or macitentan. While all three drugs are hepatically metabolized, only bosentan is both a substrate and inducer of the cytochrome P450 system, specifically CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, leading to significant concern for drug-drug interactions.<sup>106</sup> All three drugs should be used with caution in severe hepatic impairment due to metabolism. In addition, bosentan has been associated with risk of true hepatotoxicity, a concern which may or may not be associated with ambrisentan and macitentan. A recent metaanalysis of clinical trials of ERAs supported this unique risk of bosentan, with a risk ratio for abnormal liver function tests of 3.8 [95% CI, 2.4, 5.9] compared to placebo.<sup>107</sup> Monthly monitoring of liver function tests was formerly suggested for all patients on ERAs,15 but currently only applies to bosentan in the US.<sup>1</sup>

Bosentan is a nonselective inhibitor of both ETA and ETB. However, due to the partial vasodilatory effects of ETB, there was considerable interest in finding an ETA-selective ERA, leading to the development and subsequent approval of ambrisentan in 2007.<sup>106</sup> Macitentan, the newest ERA on the market, is a dual (ETA/ETB) antagonist with high-affinity ETA in particular. It was developed with the goal of improved safety in a dual-receptor ERA.<sup>108</sup>

# Data for Use

The modern drug therapy era for PAH began with the demonstration of a mortality benefit for patients treated with epoprostenol in 1996, published via a randomized trial by Barst and colleagues.<sup>17</sup> Since that time, while the prognosis has improved for PAH patients treated with epoprostenol suggesting improvement in overall mortality,<sup>20</sup> no other drug has been proven to offer a definitive mortality benefit for patients across any FC and diagnosis subtype. This may be attributable to improvement in nonpharmacologic management or diminishing returns for each additive therapy. Perhaps most notably, as PAH disease progression has slowed in the current era of drug therapy, it becomes more challenging to power a randomized trial for a mortality endpoint. Since regulatory agencies increasingly have been willing to base approval on surrogate (yet

still patient-centered) outcomes such as 6MWT time or worsening of WHO FC, incentives have decreased for drug developers and other investigators to design trials with an endpoint of mortality. Selected discussion of key trials leading to medication approval or clinical practice change are discussed in this section. A summary of high-level evidence is presented in Table 11.5.

# **Combination Therapy**

#### Tadalafil and Ambrisentan

Upfront combination in treatment naïve PAH patients with WHO FC II or III symptoms is now recommended as the first choice by the 2019 ACCP guideline. This recommendation is based largely on the AMBITION trial, published in 2015. In this study, 500 participants with treatment naïve PAH and FC II or III symptoms were randomized, in 2:1:1 ratio, to combination ambrisentan and tadalafil versus each drug as monotherapy. In the combination therapy group, 18% of participants reached a primary endpoint event (a composite of death, hospitalization for worsening PAH, or disease progression) compared to 31% in the pooled monotherapy group (Fig. 11.2).

# **Monotherapy and Sequential Therapy**

#### **Prostanoids**

Barst and colleagues demonstrated the efficacy of intravenous epoprostenol in 81 patients with PAH and WHO FC III or IV symptoms as compared to placebo. After just 12 weeks of epoprostenol therapy, patients randomized to epoprostenol demonstrated improved 6MWT distance, lower mPAP, and lower pulmonary vascular resistance. In addition, there were eight deaths in the control group (20%) and none in the active therapy group. <sup>17</sup>

Continuous subcutaneous treprostinil infusion was demonstrated to be effective by Simonneau and colleagues in 2002. <sup>79</sup> In addition to background therapy (which notably did not include modern ERAs or PDE-5is), infusion of subcutaneous treprostinil lead to improved hemodynamics and 6MWT distance versus placebo in 470 patients with PAH and WHO FC II, III, or IV symptoms.

Treprostinil diolamine (orally administered treprostinil) was tested in the FREEDOM series of trials. In FREEDOM-C and FREEDOM-C2, the addition of treprostinil diolamine to background therapy including ERA and/or PDE-5i did not improve 6MWT, the primary outcome, compared to placebo. However, in the FREEDOM-M investigation of treprostinil diolamine in patients not currently on ERA of PDE-5i therapy, patients assigned to treprostinil showed an

Fig. 11.2 Upfront combination therapy with ambrisentan and tadalafil versus monotherapy in treatment naı¨ve pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) patients with functional class II or III symptoms, from the AMBITION trial. In this placebo-controlled, randomized trial, 500 patients with PAH and not previously treated were assigned, in 2:1:1 ratio, to initial combination therapy with 10mg of ambrisentan plus 40mg of tadalafil (combination-therapy group), 10mg of ambrisentan plus placebo, or 40mg of tadalafil plus placebo. Freedom from the primary combined endpoint is shown in the figure for the combination therapy group versus the two monotherapy groups combined. The primary combined endpoint was any of following: death of any cause, hospitalization for worsening PAH, disease progression, or unsatisfactory clinical response, the latter two assessed via functional class and 6-minute walk test distance.

increase in 6MWT of 23 meters. Results from the FREEDOM-EV study, quantifying mortality and morbidity outcomes of oral treprostinil on top of initial monotherapy, await formal release.

#### IP Receptor Agonists

The novel oral IP receptor agonist selexipag was tested in the multicenter GRIPHON study of patients who were either treatmentnaïve (20% of enrollees) or on stable background therapy of an ERA, PDE-5i, or both.83 This study, conducted in 1156 patients, demonstrated a 40% reduction in a composite endpoint of death or worsening PAH for selexipag versus placebo. The vast majority of patients were WHO FC II or III at enrollment. A slight majority of the study population (56%) had idiopathic PAH.

# Phosphodiesterase Type 5 Inhibitors

The safety and efficacy of sildenafil for the treatment of PAH have been long established. In the SUPER trial, published in patients with PAH not currently on vasodilator therapy were randomized to sildenafil, or 80mg three times daily or placebo.<sup>84</sup> After 12 weeks, patients assigned to any of the sildenafil arms had significantly improved 6MWT distance from baseline over placebo (Fig. 11.3). Almost all patients reported FC II or III symptoms at enrollment.

Tadalafil was tested in the multicenter PHIRST trial, which randomized 405 patients with PAH to tadalafil 2.5,, or 40mg daily or placebo.<sup>85</sup> Patients were either treatment naïve or on stable background therapy with full dose bosentan (125mg twice daily).

![](_page_25_Figure_5.jpeg)

Fig. 11.3 Change in 6-minute walk test from baseline in patients treated with sildenafil versus placebo from the SUPER trial. In a placebocontrolled randomized clinical trial, 278 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) were randomly assigned 1:1:1:1 to monotherapy with sildenafil, or 80mg three times daily or placebo. Figure shows the change from baseline 6-minute walk test distance at week 12 for each of the four arms. There was significant improvement compared to baseline in all active arms; in contrast, no difference was seen in patients taking placebo. (Modified from Galie` N, Ghofrani HA, Torbicki A, et al. Sildenafil citrate therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension. N Engl J Med 2005;353:2148–2157.)

Tadalafil, and 40mg daily (but not 2.5mg) showed efficacy in improving 6MWT distance over placebo. In addition, the high-dose group (40mg daily) showed significantly improved time to clinical worsening over placebo.

## Soluble Guanyl Cyclase Stimulators

The sGC stimulator riociguat was proven efficacious in the 443 patient PATIENT-1 trial.<sup>87</sup> Included patients suffered from PAH and were either taking no background therapy (50% of participants) or were taking stable doses of an ERA and/or a prostanoid (excluding intravenous prostanoid). Participants were randomized to placebo or riociguat, individually adjusted, up to 2.5 or 1.5mg three times daily. After 12 weeks, the mean difference in 6MWT between the 2.5mg riociguat group and placebo was 36 meters. This was accompanied by hemodynamic improvements, including lower pulmonary vascular resistance, lower mPAP, and higher cardiac output in the riociguat group.

#### Endothelin Receptor Antagonists

Bosentan was the first oral vasodilator proven to benefit patients with PAH. Compared to placebo in FC III and IV patients taking no other therapy, it was shown to improve symptoms and increase 6MWT (BREATHE-1).<sup>89</sup> The follow-up study, BREATHE-2, which randomized patients (approximately 75% FC III and 25% FC IV) to epoprostenol versus epoprostenol plus bosentan, did not show a significant difference in outcomes between the two groups.<sup>37</sup>

Monotherapy with ambrisentan was evaluated in the concurrent ARIES-1 and ARIES-2 studies, each testing several dosing alternatives to placebo in PAH patients with predominantly FC III presentations on no other therapy. Subjective dyspnea, as well as 6MWT distance, improved at the end of the 12-week study period.<sup>90</sup> SERAPHIN was a modern trial of macitentan, the newest ERA, for use as either monotherapy or add-on therapy in PAH.<sup>91</sup> Approximately two-thirds of the 250 patients randomized were taking a PDE-5i at randomization. Macitentan 10mg daily was associated with a 45% reduction in the primary composite endpoint, a combination of death or disease worsening.

# Side Effects

Almost invariably, PAH therapies are associated with side effects of vasodilation—generally with severity directly related to agent potency. Various class-wide side effects are shown in Table 11.5.

#### **Prostanoids**

Typical and nearly universal side effects of epoprostenol and treprostinil infusion therapy are jaw pain (trismus), flushing, nausea, and headaches. Frequency can range from over half of patients to nearly 90%. Diffuse body aches, diarrhea, and vomiting can also occur. Side effects are typically dose-related, but they often improve with symptomatic support and time, without necessitating dose decrease. For patients using subcutaneous delivery devices for treprostinil, injection site pain is common occurrence, and can often be managed by rotating the infusion site. Fewer than 10% of patients may have to discontinue therapy due to injection site pain. 79 For patients receiving intravenous medication, central line infections are a serious concern, especially in PAH patients who, if requiring parenteral therapy, likely have little physiologic reserve. In one observational series of patients on long-term epoprostenol, there were 119-line infections, and 70 episodes of sepsis, in 162 over an average of 3 years of follow-up. 110

All prostanoids inhibit platelet function;<sup>41</sup> thus bleeding is a common side effect of their use. This is particularly true of PAH patients on oxygen, among whom epistaxis is a common complaint.

Unintended hemodynamic consequences can be seen with virtually all PAH therapy. These include hypotension as well as high output heart failure, which may lead to pulmonary edema.

#### **IP** receptor agonists

Side effects with selexipag are similar to those for prostanoids: headache, diarrhea, jaw pain, nausea, and myalgia. Hyperthyroidism was more common among patients taking selexipag than placebo in a large clinical trial. The mechanism and implications of such thyroid dysfunction are currently unclear. §3

# **Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors**

Class-related side effects of PDE-5is include hypotension, headache, and nausea. In a trial of sildenafil in a population of patients all with connective tissue disease associated PAH, epistaxis was more common (13%) than reported in other populations. <sup>111</sup> Priapism is not a common side effect of PDE-5is when used in PAH; however, a placebo-controlled trial of sildenafil for sickle cell anemia—associated pulmonary hypertension was stopped early due to an increase of adverse events in the active treatment arm, including priapism. <sup>112</sup>

In clinical trials, riociguat was generally well tolerated. Major adverse events included headache, dyspepsia, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting.87,113,114 Rare cases of drug-related syncope, gastritis, and renal failure have been reported among patients taking riociguat.

# Endothelin Receptor Antagonists

Common class side effects of ERA therapy include headache and dizziness.<sup>115</sup> Idiosyncratic agent adverse effects, however, include risk of hepatotoxity, thought to be chiefly attributable to bosentan. In a trial of 213 patients randomized to bosentan or placebo, the incidence of abnormal liver function tests >five times the upper limit of normal. This occurred in 3% of participants taking placebo, 4% among patients taking 125mg twice daily, but 14% among participants taking 250mg twice daily.<sup>89</sup> Study drug was discontinued for aminotransferase >eight times the upper limit of normal in 2% of active drug patients and 0% of controls. In the ARIES trials of ambrisentan, no patients on active drug were reported to have serum aminotransferase concentrations greater than three times the upper limit of normal, compared to three patients (2.3%) taking placebo. Macitentan is generally very well tolerated, but headache, nasopharyngitis, and anemia have been seen with higher frequency in participants taking macitentan compared with controls.<sup>91</sup>

# Drug Interactions

# Prostanoids

The prostanoids are free of major drug-drug interactions that limit use. In all prostanoids, the antiplatelet and antithrombotic effects might be exacerbated in patients who receive anticoagulation for other indications. There has been some concern for decreased clearance of furosemide in patients administered both epoprostenol and furosemide, but the effect was small, found in only a single study, and may be statistical aberration.116Due to its metabolism by CYP2C8, treprostinil is susceptible to drug interactions by agents that induce (such as rifampin) or inhibit (e.g., gemfibrozil) this enzyme.100

Like treprostinil, selexipag is extensive metabolized by CYP2C8. Coadministration with strong inhibitors of this enzyme, such as gemfibrozil, is not advised due to the risk of selexipag toxicity. Selexipag undergoes partial metabolism by CYP3A4, but it is not clear that there is a risk of significant drug-to-drug interactions between selexipag and agents that affect this enzyme. <sup>117</sup> Selexipag should not be used concurrently with prostanoids due to shared action site at the IP receptor. <sup>1</sup>

# **Phosphodiesterase Type 5 Inhibitors**

Both sildenafil and tadalafil may cause lowering of systemic blood pressure, and so caution is advised when combining these agents with other antihypertensives. It should be noted, however, that the systemic blood pressure lowering effect of these agents is modest; in a preapproval hemodynamic study of healthy volunteers, administration of a high dose of sildenafil (50 mg three times daily) resulted in a systemic systolic blood pressure decrease of only 6 mmHg. <sup>63</sup> PAH patients with abnormal baseline hemodynamics may respond more dramatically however. Due to shared pathway of action on the NO-cGMP pathway, oral nitrates should never be coadministered with PDE-5is.

Sildenafil is metabolized via CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent CYP2C9 and should be avoided in patients taking the antiviral ritonavir and other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors—an important consideration in patients with HIV-associated PAH. II8 A similar interaction is seen with tadalafil, which is also extensively metabolized via CYP3A4.

Pharmacodynamic studies have suggested that bosentan, an inducer of both CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, may lead to reduced serum levels of sildenafil in patients taking both. <sup>120</sup> Interestingly, this may explain why trials examining dual therapy with sildenafil and bosentan in PAH have been negative. <sup>121,122</sup>

## **Soluble Guanylyl Cyclase Stimulators**

The sGC stimulator riociguat acts via the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway and thus should not be coadministered with a PDE-5i. Use of riociguat along with strong CYP and P-glycoprotein/BCRP inhibitors (ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) may increase riociguat levels and risk of toxicity. 123

## **Endothelin Receptor Antagonists**

Bosentan is an inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, a finding that may have clinical relevance when coadministered with sildenafil, as discussed previously. Unlike bosentan, ambrisentan does not appear to share this risk. <sup>120</sup> However, ambrisentan is metabolized by

CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, and concomitant administration with strong inducers or inhibitors of those enzymes is discouraged. Macitentan is also metabolized by CYP3A4, but in vivo pharmacokinetic studies seem to support low risk of drug-to-drug interactions with macitentan.  $^{106,124}\,$ 

# **Experimental Drugs**

Despite the many advances in the understanding of and care for patients with PAH in the years since the first PAH therapies became available. PAH remains a difficult disease to treat—it remains incurable and the field is lacking a complete molecular understanding of disease pathogenesis. 125 Although recently approved drugs, such as oral treprostinil, selexipag, and riociguat, represent exciting new drug formulations and/or oral therapy options, they are all active along established mechanistic and vasodilatory pathways. In fact, not since sildenafil in 2005 has a PAH drug been approved with an entirely new mechanism of action (Fig. 11.4). Additional agents leveraging established therapeutic pathways are currently under development. Ralinepag, a new IP receptor agonist, <sup>126</sup> is currently in phase III clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03626688). A phase III randomized trial (NCT01908699) of the addition of the oral prostanoid beraprost-314d to inhaled treprostinil has completed with preliminary reports indicating that it did not meet its primary endpoint; official results are pending. 127

Drugs with novel mechanisms of action are under development, as investigators work to transform new insights of pulmonary vascular remodeling and right ventricular dysfunction into the molecular basis of PAH into therapeutic targets. For example, pursuant to the discovery of multiple inflammatory pathways that initiate and sustain PAH pathogenesis, a number of candidate therapeutic agents are currently under evaluation that have antiinflammatory effects. Bardoxolone methyl is an orally available triterpenoid that inhibits inhibitor transcription factor NF-κΒ<sup>130</sup> and is currently undergoing evaluation in patients with connective tissue disease-associated PAH (NCT02657356). Other specific antiinflammatory therapies, including the anti-CD20 inhibitor rituximab, are under study in planned or ongoing early phase trials. In addition to inflammation, BMPR2-related signaling is being targeted for new drug therapy, as are PAH-specific alterations seen in vascular metabolism,  $^{53}$  stiffening, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR- $\gamma$ ) activity.  $^{131,132}$  Such discoveries hold promise for new therapies under development.  $^{133-135}$  Finally, rapid advances in new genetic associations with PAH will almost certainly lead to new molecular targets.

# Conclusions

The prognosis in PAH has been greatly improved in the over two decades since potent pulmonary vasodilatory drugs became available. Yet, PAH continues to present great challenge to patients and clinicians alike, and a clear unmet need still exists for new diseasemodifying therapies. New molecular insights into PAH hold promise for initiating the next generation of vascular remodeling drugs in the care for PAH.
