#### **Drugs Targeting Inflammation**

Inflammatory responses encompass a series of host defense and repair mechanisms.1 Inflammatory processes fight off microbial and viral invaders. They aid the repair of injured tissues. Thus, the operation of inflammatory pathways proves essential to survival of the individual and of the species. Yet, these very processes that can protect from infection or injury, when unleashed inappropriately, or if the inflammatory response fails to resolve, can cause disease. The aging of the population favors the development of chronic diseases. The control of communicable diseases by sanitation, vaccination, antibiotic treatment, and other societal measures permits more individuals to survive to the point of developing chronic diseases of many organ systems. Inflammatory pathways contribute to many of the chronic conditions that currently challenge successful aging. Inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of diseases as diverse as forms of dementia, the arthritides, chronic lung and kidney diseases, and of course cardiovascular conditions. Thus, understanding and combatting inflammation holds a key for the prevention and treatment of many chronic conditions associated with aging. Moreover, recognition has increased that oncogenesis, and the growth, invasion, and metastasis of many cancers hijack inflammatory pathways.<sup>2</sup>

Given the critical role of inflammation in host defenses and tissue homeostasis, interventions that modulate inflammatory processes require careful targeting and modulation, lest adverse consequences outweigh potential benefits. While antiinflammatory strategies have long contributed to the management of forms of arthritis and airways disease, the advent of strategies that modulate inflammation have just begun to show promise in cardiovascular conditions. Given the delicate balance required to intervene

successfully to modulate therapeutically inflammation, a background in the basics of inflammation biology provides a framework for this undertaking.

### Basic Concepts of Inflammation Biology

Inflammatory pathways encompass two major sets of responses that have evolved in an interdependent manner (Fig. 7.1). The innate immune response arose early in evolution. Marine invertebrates such as the starfish and limulus crab have innate immune responses. The innate pathways mobilize rapidly. Their triggers include products of infectious agents known as pathogen-associatedmolecular patterns (PAMPs). Damaged or dead cells can releasetriggers for innate immunity known as damage-associatedmolecular patterns (DAMPs). These signals interact with a series of pattern recognition receptors, prominently the class known as Toll-like receptors (TLRs). These receptors recognize hundreds or just a few thousand different DAMPs or PAMPs. Thus, although innate immune responses mobilize rapidly, they are relatively blunt, as they recognize a fairly restricted set of patterns.

In contrast, the adaptive immune response arose much later in evolution. Most arms of adaptive immunity require "education." Specific structures can serve as antigensfor instigating cellular or humoral immune responses. Defined structural features of proteins, carbohydrates, and some lipids can engender adaptive immune responses. Rather than hundreds or thousands of structures as triggers, adaptive immunity can recognize millions or even billions of structures. The "education" of the adaptive immune response helps to limit recognition of self structures, to minimize autoimmune responses. Also, the affinity of antibodies and specificity of cellular responses to antigens can increase with time. Thus, in contrast to the innate immune response, adaptive immunity shows exquisite specificity and considerable power, given the fine-tuning of adaptive immune responses over time after encountering an initial antigenic stimulus.3

While the mononuclear phagocyte exemplifies the main cellular mediator of innate immunity, lymphocytes give rise to the adaptive immune response. T lymphocytes comprise the afferent limb of cellular immunity. Several important subclasses of T lymphocytes subserve specific functions. T helper 1 (Th1) cells, characterized by secretion of a signature cytokine immune interferon or interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), promote adaptive immune responses. Th2 lymphocytes tend to mediate allergic responses. Th2 cells secret interleukin (IL) -4 and -10 as signature cytokines. Regulatory T cells (Treg) secrete transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and

can calm immune responses and promote tissue repair through fibrosis. B lymphocytes mediate humoral immunity and give rise to plasma cells that produce large quantities of antibody. In an exception to the rule that adaptive immune responses require "education," B1 lymphocytes secrete "natural" antibodies, some of which can mitigate experimental atherosclerosis. B2 lymphocytes tend to aggravate adaptive immune responses.

Although innate immunity evolved before the adaptive response, adaptive immune factors regulate innate immunity. Innate immune cells such as the dendritic cell (a relative of the mononuclear phagocytes) serve to present antigens to the T cell, initiating the adaptive immune response. IFN-γ elaborated by Th1 cells can activate macrophages strongly. Cytokines derived from Th2 cells such as IL-10 can dampen innate immune responses mediated by macrophages. These examples provide an illustration of the complex crosstalk underway in any moment in complex organisms (Fig. 7.1). The inflammatory status of an individual can vary immensely and depends on an intricate balance of proinflammatory, antiinflammatory, and proresolving pathways.

In acute bacterial infections the rapidly mobilized innate immune system responds rapidly, causing fever and a series of host defense mechanisms that help to fight off the invaders including mobilization of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The extreme example of an acute inflammatory response, Gram-negative bacterial sepsis, familiar to all clinicians, illustrates the rapidity and devastating nature of an undampened acute inflammatory response. Fulminant myocarditis illustrates another acute inflammatory response that affects the cardiovascular system.

On the other end of the spectrum, the chronic conditions that plague the cardiovascular system often involve much more muted inflammatory responses that play out over months and years rather than hours and days as in the case of acute inflammation. An example of a chronic immune response mediated by macrophages, tuberculosis, illustrates the long-term and indolent nature of the chronic immune response. The intersection of innate and adaptive immune responses that give rise to chronic diseases of many organ systems, including atherosclerosis, exemplifies the ravages of a chronic immune response in the cardiovascular system.

# Stimuli for the Inflammatory Response

A number of stimuli can initiate inflammatory responses in the context of cardiovascular disease (Fig. 7.2). Atherosclerosis represents the best-studied chronic inflammatory condition of the

Fig. 7.2 Diagram summarizing some of the potential therapeutic targets for modifying chronic inflammatory diseases. These overlapping categories fall into three major categories: proximal triggers (top), central hubs (middle), and distal effectors (bottom). BETs, Bromodomain and extraterminal domain proteins; LDL, low-density lipoprotein; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; NFx B, nuclear factor  $\kappa$  B; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; PPARs, peroxisome proliferation activation receptors; ROS, reactive oxygen species;  $TXA_2$ , thromboxane  $A_2$ .

cardiovascular system. Although low-density lipoprotein (LDL) doubtless plays a pivotal permissive role in atherosclerosis, it does not appear to exert most of its proatherogenic actions primarily by instigating inflammation. While macrophages of the innate immune system accumulate lipid and become foam cells when exposed to excessive concentrations of atherogenic lipoproteins, unmodified LDL itself does not lead to lipid overload. The LDL receptor responds exquisitely to intercellular cholesterol concentrations. Hence, loading cells with cholesterol requires uptake of cholesterol-containing lipoproteins via receptors besides the classical LDL receptor. Such scavenger receptors tend to recognize modified LDL particles that have undergone oxidation or glycation. Foam cell formation may thus depend less on native LDL than on cholesterol derived from other atherogenic lipoproteins.

Although initial evidence pointed to oxidized LDL as a possible antigen triggering the adaptive immune response in the context of atherosclerosis, more recent data suggest that the T cells recognize native LDL more readily than modified LDL. 7.8 Finally, an intervention that lowers LDL by augmenting activity of the LDL receptor, inhibitors of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9),

can mitigate atherosclerotic events without decreasing biomarkers of inflammation. This observation underscores the contention that LDL itself has modest proinflammatory properties at best.

Hypertension and mediators of high blood pressure can involve both adaptive and innate immunity. High concentrations of angiotensin II, a prototypical vasoconstrictor hormone implicated in the pathogenesis of many forms of hypertension, can elicit the production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 from various cell types involved in atherosclerosis, including smooth muscle cells. Ocnsiderable experimental evidence supports the involvement of adaptive immunity in hypertension. Yet, anti-inflammatory drugs tend not to improve blood pressure in hypertensive individuals. Indeed, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents tend to increase blood pressure modestly. These findings argue against inflammation as a major contributor to chronic forms of hypertension.

Many have invoked oxidative stress, and oxidatively modified lipoproteins in particular as instigators of both innate and adaptive immune responses in the context of atherosclerosis. Yet, all antioxidant vitamins tested, and a number of inhibitors of oxidative pathways including the production of oxidized LDL, have failed to reduce cardiovascular events in rigorously conducted clinical trials. Once again, despite considerable preclinical evidence and the results of observational studies, oxidative stress and lipoprotein oxidation have not shown promise as therapeutic targets. These observations demote the clinical relevance of oxidative pathways as instigators of immune and inflammatory responses.

A large body of experimental and observational epidemiologic literature support associations between various infectious agents and atherosclerosis. While viral myocarditis indubitably represents an example of an inflammatory trigger for cardiovascular disease, targeting infectious agents has not proven actionable in general in atherosclerosis. While bacteria and viruses can stimulate both innate and adaptive immunity, and microbial products can serve as PAMPs, rigorously conducted and appropriately sized antibiotic intervention studies have failed to show reduced cardiovascular events. These studies have used several classes of antibiotic agents that target microorganisms implicated by experimental and seroepidemiologic studies in atherosclerosis, e.g., Chlamydia pneumoniae. The types of agent used in the larger randomized clinical trials include macrolides (e.g., azithromycin) and fluoroquinolones (e.g., gatifloxacin). While various viruses, notably Herpesviridae, can inhabit many human tissues including atheromata, rigorous evidence implicating viral agents as triggers to innate and adaptive immunity in usual forms of human atherosclerosis has not emerged. Experimentally, a herpes virus can cause an

atherosclerotic-like disease in avian species (Marek disease),17 and cytomegalovirus can also enhance arterial disease in rodents.<sup>18</sup>

Considerable recent interest has highlighted the potential of the microbiome as a contributor to cardiovascular disease.<sup>19</sup> The clinical extrapolation of intriguing experimental results showing the ability of intestinal microbiota to produce metabolites that putatively potentiate atherosclerosis, such as trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), to humans still requires reinforcement.

Tissue damage can instigate innate immune responses through the production of DAMPs (Fig. 7.1). Experimental evidence substantiates the possibility that DAMPs elaborated from the infarcted myocardium can augment innate immune responses. For example, dying cardiac myocytes can release DNA that can initiate an inflammatory response through a pathway mediated by interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3).20 Myocardial infarction can mobilize systemic inflammatory responses that can augment remote inflammatory responses, including in preexisting atherosclerotic lesions.21 These pathways involve mobilization of macrophages and their activation in response to tissue injury (Fig. 7.3). These examples show how ischemic damage to myocardium produced by preexisting atherosclerotic plaques can elicit and amplify immune responses. Yet, these pathways likely participate in the potentiation of inflammatory responses to preexisting disease, rather than proving pathogenic in initiation of primary atherosclerotic plaques.

A good deal of recent work has firmly established that adipose tissue can contribute to inflammatory states. In particular, ectopic fat deposition around the viscera, associated with the android fat distribution (male or "apple" pattern), associates with markers of innate immune activation such as C-reactive protein (CRP).22,23 Such ectopic depots of adipose tissue team with inflammatory cells including macrophages and T lymphocytes. Ectopic adipose tissue elaborates proinflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor that can mediate insulin resistance. Perivascular adipose tissue may participate in local "outside in" inflammatory signaling that can potentiate vascular disease.<sup>23</sup> Thus, weight loss either pharmacologic or through bariatric surgery might mitigate inflammation in cardiovascular diseases. The use of pharmacologic agents in this regard has proved quite challenging due to adverse or off-target effects. For example, certain classes of weight loss drugs can produce pulmonary hypertension or valvular heart disease. The thiazolidinediones that activate peroxisome proliferation activation receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) may cause a redistribution of adipose tissue away from the visceral depot, but also can cause fluid retention and exacerbate heart failure. These limitations have frustrated pharmacologic management of adiposity and as antiinflammatory strategies in cardiovascular disease.

Fig. 7.3 Leukocytes link local and systemic inflammation in ischemic cardiovascular disease. The stress of acute myocardial infarction produces an "echo" in atherosclerotic plaques. Acute myocardial infarction causes pain and anxiety that triggers sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system. β<sup>3</sup> adrenergic stimulation mobilizes leukocyte progenitors from their bone marrow niche. These progenitor cells can migrate to the spleen, where they can multiply in response to hematopoietic growth factors. The proinflammatory monocytes then leave the spleen and enter the atherosclerotic plaque, where they promote inflammation that can render a plaque more likely to provoke thrombosis and hence acute myocardial infarction.

Exposure to foreign tissues, such as transplanted organs, can also lead to activation of the immune response (Fig. 7.4). Such adaptive immune reactions to foreign tissues known as the allogeneic immune response, clearly contribute to rejection of solid organ transplants. This is one arena where therapies that mitigate immune and inflammatory responses have proven of daily applicability in the practice of cardiovascular medicine. Allograft

Each of the depicted immune and nonimmune mechanisms may pertain to variable extents in individual patients. In addition to these mechanisms, the risk factors for usual atherogenesis (dyslipidemia, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, etc.) doubtless also apply when present.

rejection can be hyperacute, acute, or chronic. Preformed antibodies against donor determinants mediate hyperacute rejection, a process that occurs within minutes to hours after transplantation. This form of allograft rejection has become relatively rare due to the practice of prospective cross-matching in sensitized recipients. Acute rejection can be cellular or humoral. In acute cellular rejection, T cells directed against the donor myocardium trigger an inflammatory response that leads to myocyte necrosis and graft failure. Antibodies directed against the graft vasculature mediate acute humoral rejection. This type of rejection can lead to local complement activation, vessel damage, and graft failure. Allograft vasculopathy also called "chronic rejection" results from immune and nonimmune responses against the graft vasculature and leads to diffuse and concentric narrowing of donor coronary arteries including smaller intramyocardial branches (Fig. 7.3). We prefer the term allograft vasculopathy to chronic rejection, as the major immunological mechanisms differ substantially. CD8+ T-cell-mediated myocardiocytolysis characterizes acute cellular parenchymal rejection. In contrast, CD4+ T cells likely dominate in the pathogenesis of proliferative lesions in the arterial intima of graft vasculopathy. Acute cellular and humoral rejection contribute to early transplant death, while allograft vasculopathy typically causes later transplant mortality. 24

Transplant immunosuppression can be divided into induction and maintenance therapies (Table 7.1). Induction therapies, including antithymocyte globulin or basiliximab, may be given for a limited duration, shortly after transplant, to allow earlier reduction of steroid dosage or to delay introduction of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) in patients at risk for nephrotoxicity. Antithymocyte globulin or basiliximab may reduce the risk of acute rejection without substantially altering posttransplant survival or complications.<sup>25</sup> Maintenance immunosuppression consists of lifelong therapy with some combination of corticosteroids, CNIs (cyclosporine or tacrolimus), and antimetabolites (azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil). Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (everolimus and sirolimus) can be used in combination with low-dose CNI, or after withdrawal of CNI, to reduce progression of allograft vasculopathy or CNI-induced nephrotoxicity. <sup>26</sup> While these potent inhibitors of adaptive immune responses have greatly attenuated acute allograft rejection, they have not allayed the chronic inflammatory response that begets the allograft vascular disease that remains a major challenge to the longevity of transplanted hearts.

For reasons that remain unclear, self-antigens can occasionally trigger the immune response leading to myocarditis. Cardiac infiltration by inflammatory cells resulting in myocardial necrosis characterizes the myocardidites. Myocarditis can have many etiologies including viral (Coksackievirus B, parvovirus, and adenovirus being among the most common), pharmacologic (e.g. anthracyclines), hematologic (e.g. eosinophilic myocarditis), and autoimmune (e.g., giant cell myocarditis).

Knowledge regarding the immunobiology of myocarditis emerged from two types of animal experiments: viral myocarditis caused by infection of mice with Coxsackievirus B3 and experimental autoimmune myocarditis caused by immunization of mice with cardiac myosin or a myocarditogenic peptide derived from cardiac  $\alpha$ -myosin heavy chain, or forced expression

of ovalbumin in the myocardium in mice with ovalbumin responsive T cells.28

In viral myocarditis, myocardial injury results from a direct viral cytopathic effect as well as activation of the host cellular immune response. During acute infection, NK cells infiltrate the myocardium and play a critical role in the early host response by preventing viral replication. A second wave of infiltrating leukocytes, composed primarily of CD3+ T cells that colocalize with CD68+ macrophages, peaks 7–14 days after viral infection. They destroy infected myocytes to promote viral clearance, and the ensuing damage exposes cryptogenic intracellular antigens, such as myosin-derived peptides, that generate an autoimmune cardiacspecific response leading to chronic inflammation, fibrosis and progression to dilated cardiomyopathy.<sup>29</sup> Similarly in other forms of autoimmune myocarditis, unknown triggers, combined with specific host factors, activate the innate immune response leading to myocyte damage and exposure of cryptic antigens that are recognized by autoimmune T-cell clones leading to sustained activation of the adaptive immune response and progressive myocardial damage.<sup>28</sup>

The therapeutic approach to myocarditis has relied on immunosuppressive therapy as a way to target proinflammatory mediators of disease. The Myocarditis Treatment Trial failed to show a benefit of corticosteroids, in combination with cyclosporine or azathioprine, in patients with histologically proven lymphocytic myocarditis and left ventricular dysfunction compared to placebo.<sup>30</sup> The failure of immunosuppressive therapy in this study may have resulted from suppression of the beneficial effects of the innate immune response on viral replication.<sup>29</sup> Another study evaluated the effects of corticosteroids with azathioprine in patients with histologically proven myocarditis and chronic heart failure with no evidence of myocardial viral genomes. In this study, immunosuppression resulted in a significant improvement in left ventricular function and volumes compared to placebo.<sup>31</sup> Clinically, treatment of myocarditis does not routinely use immunosuppression, save for patients with giant cell myocarditis where registry data indicate that the use of immunosuppression improved mean survival from 3 to 12.3 months.<sup>32</sup> However, only 11% of patients survived without transplantation. Recently, the rising use of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of solid tumors has also given rise to T-cell–mediated myocarditis in <1% of patients.<sup>33</sup> Despite treatment with high-dose immunosuppressive therapy, almost half of these patients suffer major adverse cardiovascular events including cardiovascular death, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, and hemodynamically significant complete heart block.<sup>34</sup>

Another arm of innate immunity, the complement system, also participates in certain vasculitides. A large body of experimental work has implicated complement activation in ischemiareperfusion injury. Yet, anticomplement strategies have not proven productive in the clinical management of either vasculitis or reperfusion injury in humans.35

A novel aspect of inflammation has emerged from studies of clonal hematopoiesis (Fig. 7.5).36,37 With age, humans often host clones of myeloid cells, classical participants in innate immunity,

![](_page_13_Figure_3.jpeg)

Fig. 7.5 Clonal hematopoiesis: a common, powerful, and recently recognized risk factor for atherothrombotic and heart failure events. Acquired mutations in bone marrow stem cells can give rise to a clone of circulating mutant leukocytes (top panel) in peripheral blood (middle panel). Individuals who harbor these clones with somatic mutations in blood have a heightened risk of atherothrombotic and heart failure events (lower panel, left). People with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) develop hematologic malignancy at a rate of 0.5%–1% per annum (lower panel, right). CHIP portends a greater risk for cardiovascular events than for cancer. (From Libby P, Sidlow R, Lin AE, et al. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) at the crossroads of aging, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. J Am Coll Cardiol 2019;74:567–577.)

that bear mutations in genes implicated in driving acute leukemia. Over 10% of individuals over 70 will harbor such clones of mutant leukocytes. The development of acute leukemia generally requires successive accumulation in the same clone of two or three mutations in leukemia driver genes. Thus, most individuals with clonal hematopoiesis will never develop leukemia. Yet, these individuals have a striking enrichment in cardiovascular risk. This condition is called clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). As in the case of monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS), most individuals with CHIP will never develop a hematologic malignancy.

Only a small subset of the forty-odd well-characterized driving mutations for leukemia cause CHIP and associate with enhanced cardiovascular risk.37,38 The most common mutations that cause CHIP associate with enhanced inflammation in mice engineered to bear CHIP mutations.37,39 Hence, CHIP represents a potent and common but only very recently recognized cardiovascular risk factor, totally independent of classical risk factors. As pharmacologic interventions exist that can target the pathways activated by CHIP mutations, management of CHIP may prove susceptible to antiinflammatory therapies in the future.

# Central Hubs of Inflammatory Signaling (see Fig. 7.2)

Many of the triggers to innate immune responses delineated above activate central hubs of inflammatory signaling that represent potential therapeutic targets. A transcription factor known as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), first recognized in B lymphocytes, orchestrates the expression of many proinflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory mediators.<sup>40</sup> Proinflammatory cytokines themselves activate this transcriptional control system providing an amplification mechanism. PAMPs and DAMPs through TLRs can also activate NF-κB. The details of NF-κB activation and signaling have undergone extensive analysis identifying numerous potential therapeutic targets. Inhibitors of the proteasome can augment concentrations of the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB.) While experimental studies have shown efficacy of targeting NF-κB activation in muting experimental inflammation, drugs of practical utility in the treatment of cardiovascular disease have not emerged from this wellunderstood pathway. Indeed, as NF-κB activation may protect cells from apoptosis, survival of malignantly transformed cells might increase under circumstances of NF-κB inactivation, causing the unwanted effect of augmenting tumor growth.

Another intracellular multi-molecular structure, the inflammasome, consists of subunits that can sense various kinds of danger signals including certain PAMPs and DAMPs, especially crystalline structures such as silica, monosodium urate, or cholesterol monohydrate.<sup>41</sup> The danger-sensing moieties of inflammasomes ultimately activate an enzyme, caspase 1, that can process the inactive precursors of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 to their biologically active forms (Fig. 7.6). While various types of

The nod-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, an intracellular supramolecuar structure senses various danger signals that ultimately activate the IL-1β convertase caspase-1. This converting enzyme processes the inactive precursors of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 to their biologically active mature forms. IL-1 can induce its own gene expression, an auto-induction amplification loop. IL-18 or IL-1β can induce the production of copious IL-6 from various cell types, thus amplifying pro-inflammatory signaling. IL-6 signals hepatocytes to boost synthesis of the acute phase reactants C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Adapted from Ridker et al. Eur Heart J 41:2153–2163.

inflammasomes act as hubs of inflammatory signaling, the nod-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome has received particular attention because of its role in generating the primordial proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1β. Thus, targeting the inflammasome has given rise to new potential antiinflammatory strategies in development currently.

Another central hub in inflammatory signaling of relevance to cardiovascular disease, the Kruppel-like factors (KLFs) operate as € transcription factors.42 Activation of KLF2 by laminar shear stress transcriptionally regulates a cassette of genes implicated in protection against atherosclerosis and blood clot formation and stability.43,44 Of direct relevance to cardiovascular pharmacology, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, statins, also induce this transcription factor.<sup>42</sup> Thus, unlike the PCSK9 inhibitors, statins both lower LDL and can exert an independent antiinflammatory effect through the mediation of KLFs. Statins can also inhibit the prenylation of small G proteins involved in intracellular signaling. Thus, statins can have "pleiotropic" antiinflammatory effects that do not depend on LDL lowering through at least two sets of molecular mechanisms. This dual action of the statins, LDL lowering and an antiinflammatory action, may account for the marked success of this class of agents in forestalling cardiovascular disease both in primary and secondary prevention.

Epigenetic regulation can influence the transcription of genes involved in cardiovascular disease pathogenesis, including those implicated in inflammation.<sup>45</sup> Modifications of histones, proteins around which strands of DNA coil in nucleosomes, or of DNA itself mediate epigenetic control of gene transcription. Methylation and acetylation comprise the moieties that signal such epigenetic regulation. Various enzymes participate in the "writing" and "erasing" of these covalent modifications of chromatin components. "Readers" of these epigenetic modifications and provide links to components of transcriptional complexes that regulate the expression of genes.

In particular, one family of epigenetic "readers" has become a target of pharmacologic agents under evaluation as cardiovascular therapeutics that target in part inflammatory pathways. Bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins bind to acetylated lysine residues in histones and promote the assembly of transcriptional complexes that enhance the expression of numerous genes involved in cardiovascular inflammation.<sup>46</sup> A recent clinical trial has evaluated the ability of an inhibitor of BET proteins to improve outcomes in diabetic patients with coronary artery disease.47 This study did not show a significant reduction in major adverse cardiac events in diabetic individuals post acute coronary syndrome.

#### Mediators

The central hubs of inflammatory signaling delineated above influence the expression of a variety of mediators of inflammation in immunity implicated in cardiovascular disease (Fig. 7.2). A key event in most inflammatory processes and immune responses is the recruitment of leukocytes. A variety of endothelial surface molecules that mediate adhesive interactions with various classes of leukocytes participate in the recruitment of the inflammatory cells (Fig. 7.7). Molecules that bear homology to lectins known as the selectins cause leukocytes to associate with the surface of activated endothelial cells that express these adhesion molecules. Selectins cause a rolling interaction of the leukocytes. Members of the immunoglobulin superfamily such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) or vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) mediate firmer and less transitory adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelial surface. The expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules can regulate the type of leukocyte recruited to a site of inflammation or immune response. For example, E-selectin interacts particularly with polymorphonuclear leukocytes implicated in acute inflammatory responses. VCAM-1 interacts with monocytes, the precursor of many tissue macrophages, and T lymphocytes that participate in more chronic adaptive immune responses in tissues.

Once bound to the endothelium, leukocytes receive signals that direct their migration to within tissues. Protein mediators of this directed migration or chemoattraction include a series of protein mediators known as chemokines.<sup>48</sup> Small molecules including certain lipid mediators may also promote the migration of leukocytes within tissues. Subsets of the numerous chemokine families can govern the type of leukocyte recruited. The chemokines provide a kind of "zip code" for signaling accumulation of acute versus chronic cellular mediators of inflammation and immunity.

Despite the molecular characterization of leukocyte adhesion molecules and chemoattractant cytokines and an abundance of in vitro and experimental animal data that demonstrates their function, inhibitors of these adhesive pathways have not borne fruit in terms of clinical application.<sup>48</sup> Leukocyte adhesion inhibitors have failed to improve ischemia reperfusion injury despite numerous preclinical studies suggesting efficacy. An inhibitor of the adhesion molecule P-selectin also failed to improve cardiovascular outcomes. Given the complexity and promise of potential specificity of interference in leukocyte accumulation pathways, targeting these mediators may yet prove beneficial in some circumstances.

Fig. 7.7, Cont'd Local leukocyte and smooth muscle cell functions in the atherosclerotic plaque. Accumulation of lipoprotein particles in the intima (yellow spheres). The modification of these lipoproteins is depicted by the darker color. Modifications include oxidation and glycation. Oxidative stress, including products found in modified lipoproteins, can induce local cytokine elaboration (green spheres). The cytokines thus induced increase expression of adhesion molecules (blue stalks on endothelial surface) for leukocytes that cause their attachment and chemoattractant molecules that direct their migration into the intima. Blood monocytes, on entering the artery wall in response to chemoattractant cytokines such as monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), encounter stimuli such as macrophage colony-stimulating factor that can augment their expression of scavenger receptors. Scav-

enger receptors mediate the uptake of modified lipoprotein particles and promote the development of foam cells. Macrophage foam cells are <sup>a</sup> source of mediators, such as additional cytokines and effector molecules such as hypochlorous acid, superoxide anion (O2), and matrix metalloproteinases. Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) migrate into the intima from the media. SMCs can then divide and elaborate extracellular matrix (ECM), promoting ECM accumulation in the growing atherosclerotic plaque. In this manner, the fatty streak can evolve into <sup>a</sup> fibrofatty lesion. In later stages, calcification can occur (not depicted) and fibrosis continues, sometimes accompanied by SMC death (including programmed cell death or apoptosis), yielding <sup>a</sup> relatively acellular fibrous capsule surrounding <sup>a</sup> lipid-rich core that also may contain dying or dead cells and their detritus.

themselves, have undergone intensive investigation as potential targets in the treatment of atherosclerosis. Various classes of phospholipases that generate proinflammatory constituents of oxidized lipoproteins have undergone investigation as therapeutic targets. Rigorous clinical studies however have not substantiated improvement in cardiovascular outcomes with inhibitors of a soluble phospholipase (verasladib) or a lipoprotein associated phospholipase A2 (LpPLA2). Darapladib, an inhibitor of LpPLA2, did not improve outcomes in individuals with either acute or chronic atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in the SOLID and STABILITY trials.49,50

A variety of different classes of proteinases may participate in cardiovascular disease. An extensive preclinical literature supports roles for matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in remodeling of the extracellular matrix in both arteries and the myocardium.<sup>51</sup> Compensatory enlargement of arteries during atherogenesis likely involves the action of MMPs that degrade constituents of the arterial extracellular matrix such as elastin and interstitial collagen.<sup>52</sup> Penetration of medial smooth muscle cells into the intima to form an atheroma likewise requires lysis of extracellular matrix components mediated by MMPs. Arterial ectasia, giving rise to aortic aneurysms in the extreme, also involves degradation of extracellular matrix macromolecules. MMPs and various cathepsins implicated in elastin breakdown likely contribute to all of these situations that involve macrovascular remodeling.<sup>53</sup> These various families of proteinases generally depend on inflammatory mediators to augment their expression and activation. Thus, these proteases are central participants in inflammatory reactions.

Formation of microvessels, angiogenesis, also involves proteinase-mediated remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Remodeling of the ventricular myocardium following ischemic injury also involves breakdown of extracellular matrix constituents. A large literature implicates proteinases including the MMPs and certain cathepsins in the geometrical remodeling, repair, and healing of myocardial infarction. Despite the convincing preclinical data and experimental promise, no cardiovascular therapy that targets matrix-degrading proteinases has demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials.

Small molecule lipid mediators of inflammation, particularly the eicosanoids, have served successfully as targets for cardiovascular intervention. Most notably, aspirin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenases, can improve cardiovascular outcomes in acute coronary syndromes and secondary prevention. Although the doses of aspirin that confer cardiovascular benefit may not quell systemic inflammation, they may act as antiinflammatory agents secondarily by inhibiting platelet activation. Platelets contain preformed proinflammatory mediators that can potentiate inflammatory processes locally upon their

degranulation. Thus, low-dose aspirin may exert some of its benefit through an antiinflammatory action secondary to its inhibition of platelet activation. The selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors have not only not shown an ability to improve cardiovascular outcomes but in some cases have shown signals of cardiovascular hazard.54 Thus, aspirin treatment particularly in low doses appears to have achieved a "sweet spot" in inhibition of prostanoid production. Recent evidence from large-scale clinical trials, however, indicates that the bleeding risk counterbalances clinical benefit of low-dose aspirin in most primary prevention indications.55,56

Another class of small low-molecular-weight lipids can participate in cardiovascular inflammation—the leukotrienes, enzymes such as 5-lipoxygenase, and its activator FLAP—have undergone investigation in cardiovascular clinical trials. Despite the theoretical and experimental considerations that led to targeting of leukotrienes, inhibitors of the enzymes that govern the production of this class of mediators have not shown benefit in clinical trials.

The participation of adaptive immunity in atherosclerosis and certain forms of myocardial disease has received considerable experimental support buttressed by human observations. These considerations have led to several attempts to modulate adaptive immunity therapeutically in the context of cardiovascular disease.57 Elimination of B cells with a therapeutic antibody that targets cluster of differentiation molecule (CD20) can benefit certain vasculitides. As natural antibodies secreted by B1 lymphocytes can mitigate experimental atherogenesis, a number of attempts to vaccinate with modified lipoproteins that elicit these natural antibodies are in various stages of clinical development.58 The concept of a vaccine for atherosclerosis has considerable attraction. While one clinical trial that evaluated a biomarker, fluorodeoxyglucose uptake, did not show benefit (GLACIER), several teams are striving to implement vaccination strategies in the clinic that could prove beneficial in mitigating atherosclerotic complications.59,60

Another clever and intriguing approach to manipulating adaptive immunity involves the administration of low doses of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-2 to individuals at risk for cardiovascular complications. High doses of IL-2, used in treatment of certain malignancies, can trigger a capillary leak syndrome and have proven hazardous from a cardiovascular perspective. Yet, low doses of IL-2 can skew the adaptive immune response toward an activation of regulatory T cells that can mitigate inflammation, largely through the production of TGF-β. Pilot clinical studies evaluating this ingenious approach are currently underway.57, 61

Among the metabolites of arachidonic acid, several families of mediators of resolution of inflammation have emerged. These complex structures known as resolvins or maresins can mitigate inflammation without impairing host defenses.<sup>62</sup> These classes of proresolving mediators are known as specific proresolving mediators, or SPMs. The elegant chemistry and assessment of protective functions in vivo have led to experiments that target atherosclerosis. Indeed, experimental evidence that SPMs can mitigate experimental atherosclerosis has emerged.63,64 Whether achievable concentrations of these proresolving mediators will permit boosting of resolution of inflammatory processes in the cardiovascular system requires further study. The concept of promoting resolution without impairing host defenses or tumor surveillance or reducing defenses against infection has considerable appeal.

One place where targeted antiinflammatory therapy has shown clinical benefit in a rigorous and adequately powered clinical trial is targeting of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β. The Canakinumab Antiinflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study (CANTOS) targeted IL-1β with a monoclonal antibody, canakinumab, that very specifically inhibits IL-1β. <sup>65</sup> The study selected individuals who were in the stable phase following an acute coronary syndrome and who showed an indication of persistent inflammation despite receiving statins and other evidence based secondary prevention treatments, as indicated by an elevation in high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) above the approximate population median (2 mg/L). The median duration of treatment in the trial was 3.7 years. Administration of canakinumab 150 mg subcutaneously every 3 months yielded a statistically significant 15% reduction in relative risk of the primary composite endpoint of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death.<sup>66</sup> In an on-treatment analysis, individuals who achieved a greater than median response to canakinumab as judged by CRP reduction showed an over 30% decrease in cardiovascular and total mortality (Fig. 7.8).<sup>67</sup> Thus, CANTOS provided the first large-scale rigorous clinical trial evidence that targeting inflammation could provide a cardiovascular benefit.

Other studies targeting IL-1 and allied proinflammatory cytokines have shown evidence of benefit. The MRC IL-1 trial used anakinra, an inhibitor of the IL-1 receptor, that blocks responses to both the IL-1α and β isoforms, reduced the area under the curve of the hs-CRP response in patients undergoing acute coronary syndromes.<sup>68</sup> Anakinra administration has yielded positive signals in heart failure and experimentally as well.69-71 Other studies have targeted the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 in patients undergoing acute coronary syndromes and shown a decrease in the area under the curve of CRP particularly in those who underwent percutaneous intervention.72-74 As there are numerous proinflammatory cytokines, their exploration as therapeutic targets in cardiovascular disease merits further investigation.<sup>75</sup> In CANTOS, as expected, there was a

Fig. 7.8 Responders to canakinumab had mortality benefit in the on-treatment analysis from CANTOS. Multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for prespecified cardiovascular outcomes according to on-treatment high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels above or below 2 mg/L after drug initiation. HRs adjusted for age, gender, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, body mass index, baseline hsCRP, baseline low density lipoprotein-cholesterol. This on-treatment analysis underwent numerous sensitivity analyses to assess possible confounding that affirmed the conclusion. (Ridker PM, et al. Relationship of C-reactive protein reduction to cardiovascular event reduction following treatment with canakinumab: <sup>a</sup> secondary analysis from the CANTOS randomised controlled trial. Lancet 2018;391:319–328.)

statistically significant albeit slight increase in infections, some of them fatal. While the type of infections and identification of those susceptible to infections during treatment with canakinumab should permit mitigation of this risk, this result illustrates the need to calibrate carefully antiinflammatory interventions when attempting to treat cardiovascular disease and carefully monitoring the benefit/risk ration. Although a slight increase in fatal infections occurred in CANTOS, a striking reduction in cancer mortality counterbalanced this risk.76 This observation underscores the commonality of inflammatory mechanisms shared by cancer and cardiovascular disease.<sup>2</sup>

A large body of experimental literature and pilot clinical observations suggest that targeting the proinflammatory tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-α) could benefit individuals with heart failure. The large-scale clinical trials that evaluated this proposition did not show clinical benefit, and indeed suggested higher hazard rate of an anti-TNF strategy.<sup>77</sup> Thus, TNF neutralization, which has received wide acceptance in rheumatology and gastroenterology, does not appear a promising strategy for reducing cardiovascular risk. A prespecified secondary analysis of CANTOS did show a reduction in heart failure events and hospitalization for heart failure in patients receiving canakinumab.<sup>78</sup> Thus CANTOS also provided a proof of principle of the efficacy of anticytokine therapy in heart failure. Most therapies that have proven beneficial in treating patients with heart failure involve neurohumoral blockade. Hypotension and impaired renal function provide serious clinical limitations to ever increased neurohumoral blockade in our heart failure patients. Therefore, the concept of targeting inflammation that does not lower blood pressure or impair renal functions provides a therapy worthy of further exploration to complement the standard approaches of diuresis and blockade of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in patients with heart failure.

## Conclusions, Challenges, and Future Perspective

The plethora of proinflammatory cytokines, in the context of the success of CANTOS, suggests that selective cytokine inhibition warrants further investigation.79,80 Methotrexate, an antiinflammatory intervention that has revolutionized the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and allied disorders, has an uncertain mechanism of antiinflammatory effect and did not show benefit in a large-scale cardiovascular outcomes trial, the cardiovascular inflammation reduction trial (CIRT).<sup>81</sup> This impeccably conducted trial yielded a null result despite a robust body of observational and preclinical data indicating its efficacy.<sup>82</sup> The population enrolled in CIRT did not have baseline elevation in inflammation as would be indicated by above median CRP, a distinct difference from CANTOS. Moreover, the low-dose weekly methotrexate employed in CIRT did not lower CRP or IL-6, again in contrast to the CANTOS findings.

Taken together, the results of CANTOS and CIRT point to the IL-1β pathway as an attractive target for further attempts to target inflammation in cardiovascular disease. The inflammasome activates pro-IL-1β to its active form. It also processes the precursor of IL-18 to the active cytokine. Some data suggest that the IL-1α isoform may also undergo activation by caspase-1, the enzyme component of the inflammasome that responds to the danger signals sensed by its other constituent proteins. IL-1β strongly induces IL-6. IL-6 signaling participates causally in cardiovascular disease as shown by recent concordant human genetic studies using Mendelian randomization approaches.83,84 IL-6 can signal both through a classical pathway that involves activating the acute phase response in the hepatocyte through binding of the transmembrane form of the IL-6 receptor. IL-6 can also signal using a "trans" pathway by binding a soluble form of its receptor which can then activate extra hepatocyte cells bearing the coreceptor for IL-6, gp130 (see Fig. 7.9).

Strategies exist for neutralizing the cytokine IL-6 and its receptor, thus providing the ability to antagonize selectively classical or trans IL-6 signaling. Thus, IL-6 stands out as a logical candidate for further investigation as a target for antiinflammatory therapy in cardiovascular disease. As the acute-phase response boosts production of fibrinogen, the precursor of clots, and of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a major inhibitor of endogenous fibrinolysis, inhibiting classical signaling of IL-6, and limiting the acute phase response would not only quell inflammation but might also reduce thrombus formation and favor fibrinolysis (Fig. 7.6).

IL-18 has multiple proinflammatory properties. In addition to its classical receptor, IL-18 can signal through a sodium-chloride co-transporter. Interference with IL-18 signaling can reduce experimental atherosclerosis. Thus, targeting IL-18 also merits consideration and further exploration of antiinflammatory strategies to treat cardiovascular disease. As the NLRP3 inflammasome generates both active IL-1β and active IL-18, targeting of the inflammasome could prove beneficial in cardiovascular disease as well. Although one might be concerned about upstream inhibition of IL-1β and IL-18 maturation, alternate pathways can also generate active forms of IL-1β. In contrast to CANTOS, which targeted the cytokine itself, inhibition of the inflammasome might theoretically interfere less with host defenses than canakinumab and avoid some of the unwanted infectious consequences of IL-1β inhibition.

Fig. 7.9 Interleukin-6: A central hub of cardiometabolic signaling. Various stimuli, among them the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 and tumor necrosis factor can stimulate the release of IL-6 from leukocytes, vascular cells, adipose tissue among other sources. IL-6 can bind to its canonical receptor on the surface of hepatocytes, leukocytes, and megakaryocytes. In response to IL-6, hepatocytes produce the products of the acute-phase response including those listed. In addition to this classical IL-6 signaling pathway, the alpha subunit of the transmembrane IL-6 receptor can undergo cleavage by the metalloproteinase ADAM-17 to produce a soluble form. When bound to IL-6 in the fluid phase of blood or in the extracellular space, the soluble receptor-ligand pair can associate with gp130 expressed on many cell types, and form a ternary complex that can elicit primarily proinflammatory responses. Thus, both canonical and "transsignaling" can promote aspects of cardiometabolic disease and atherothrombosis. HDL, High-density lipoprotein. (Libby P, Rocha VZ. All roads lead to IL-6: a central hub of cardiometabolic signaling. Int J Cardiol 2018;259:213–215.)

Several small molecule inhibitors of the inflammasome have begun clinical development. Mining the inflammasome-IL-1β, IL-18, to IL-6 to acute phase response pathways holds considerable promise for further exploration as antiinflammatory therapies in atherosclerosis (Fig. 7.2, 7.6, and 7.9).

As illustrated in CANTOS, using biomarkers for selective targeting of antiinflammatory therapies provides a scheme for targeting antiinflammatory therapies. As we strive to realize the promise of personalized medicine, the identification of subsets of individuals particularly likely to respond to a given intervention based on biomarker status could prove promising. The development of biomarkers of inflammation and their validation could also aid with pharmaceutical development.85 The use of biomarkers could help select appropriate doses for clinical trials. Biomarker studies could also validate target engagement. Finally, the use of biomarkers and surrogate endpoints could provide early glimpses of clinical efficacy to aid the allocation of resources for large scale clinical trials to the most promising agents at doses likely to provide benefit.

The fundamental biology of inflammation and a wealth of experimental data have highlighted inflammation and the immune response as a potential series of therapeutic targets beyond the traditional pharmaceutical approaches to treating cardiovascular conditions. Multiple examples described above have demonstrated that interventions that have shown promise experimentally and in small-scale clinical investigations have often proved disappointing in appropriately powered randomized clinical trials. Accordingly, we must apply what we have learned while moving forward in expanding the results of CANTOS to identify further and ever safer approaches to targeting inflammation and immunity in cardiovascular disease. Given the wealth of the fundamental scientific underpinnings of this approach and the multitude of potential targets discussed in this chapter, it is likely that advances in therapeutics will realize the promise of targeted antiinflammatory therapies as a reality in cardiovascular therapeutics in the future.
