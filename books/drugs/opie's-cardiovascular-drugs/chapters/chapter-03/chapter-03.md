#### Introduction

Drug therapies for heart failure (HF) differ depending on the phenotype of presentation. <sup>1-3</sup> Distinctive phenotypes of presentation have different management targets, ranging from acute decompensated HF (ADHF) to chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) or preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). <sup>4-6</sup> For the purposes of this discussion, we shall focus on drug therapy for specific phenotypic syndromes including ADHF, HFrEF, and HFpEF. Preventive care, self-management, cardiac rehabilitation, device-based therapies, and surgical management of HF are discussed elsewhere.

# **Acute Decompensated Heart Failure**

#### Introduction

Acute decompensated HF is a life-threatening condition generally defined as a first occurrence (*de novo*) or, more frequently a presentation of acute worsening of preexisting chronic HF with prior reported admissions for decompensation. <sup>7-9</sup> It affects primarily the elderly and often requires urgent evaluation and hospitalization (Table 3.1). <sup>4,10,11</sup>

Patients with *de novo* ADHF usually have a sudden presentation, with pulmonary edema or cardiogenic shock, while those with acute decompensation of chronic HF tend to show progressive signs and symptoms before acute presentation. These differences are explained by compensatory mechanisms, the capacity of the pulmonary lymphatic system and preexisting use of diuretic therapy. <sup>12-14</sup> Also, although acute decompensation of chronic HF can happen without known precipitants, most patients have identifiable triggers such as infection, arrhythmia, anemia, pulmonary embolism, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and nonadherence. <sup>15-17</sup>

#### NYHA functional classification

- Class I—Patients with heart disease without resulting limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause heart failure symptoms such as fatigue or dyspnea.
- Class II—Patients with heart disease resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. Symptoms of heart failure develop with ordinary activity but there are no symptoms at rest.
- Class III—Patients with heart disease resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. Symptoms of heart failure develop with less than ordinary physical activity but there are no symptoms at rest.
- Class IV—Patients with heart disease resulting in inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of heart failure may occur even at rest.

#### ACC/AHA stages of heart failure

- Stage A—At high risk for heart failure but without structural heart disease or symptoms of heart failure.
- Stage B—Structural heart disease but without signs or symptoms of heart failure. This stage includes patients in NYHA class I with no prior or current symptoms or signs of heart failure.
- Stage C—Structural heart disease with prior or current symptoms of heart failure. This stage includes patients in any NYHA class with prior or current symptoms of heart failure.
- Stage D—Refractory heart failure requiring specialized interventions. This stage includes patients in NYHA class IV with refractory heart failure.

Although prehospital management is recommended, it should not delay transfer to an appropriate medical environment.<sup>18</sup> The assessment includes discrimination of severity and adjudication of the relative contribution of either congestion or perfusion to the bedside clinical profile. In the absence of cardiogenic shock, immediate echocardiography is not mandatory, since initial treatment of ADHF is similar for patients with HFrEF or HFpEF, which centers around decongestion with diuretic therapy and maintenance of adequate peripheral perfusion using either vasodilators or in selected situations, inotropic support.<sup>17</sup> There is some controversy as to whether chronic therapies for HF should be reduced or stopped during acute decompensations. Current guidelines suggest that patients should continue long-term HF therapies in the setting of ADHF, except in the presence of hemodynamic instability, hyperkalemia or severely impaired renal function. The clinical supposition in such cases is that the neurohormonal activation may be necessary during acute decompensation to maintain cardiorenal hemodynamics. In these cases, daily dosages of neurohormonal antagonists may be down-titrated or withheld temporarily until stabilization, with rapid reexposure once the acute state abates. The choice of drug therapy will need to take prognostic variables into account and parameters such as an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level >43 mg/dL, low systolic blood pressure (BP) <115 mmHg, high serum creatinine level >2.75 mg/dL, and increased troponin I level signify elevated risk. T5,16,19 Permanent signs of congestion and renal dysfunction have been shown to be among the most important prognostic variables. The routine use of a pulmonary artery catheter is not recommended and should be restricted to hemodynamically unstable patients with an unknown mechanism of deterioration and influences the therapy which in such cases tends to be targeted towards the hemodynamic aberration. A clinical approach that may act as a surrogate to invasive hemodynamic parameters has been widely used to classify patients into therapeutic categories (Fig. 3.1). Patients with a "wet" profile have correlated higher pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP > 18 mmHg) while those with a "cold" profile have lower cardiac indexes (CI  $\leq$ 2.2 L/min/m<sup>2</sup>). <sup>25,27</sup> Fig. 3.2 summarizes the 2016 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) algorithm for management of patients admitted with ADHF based on clinical profiles.

# Pharmacotherapy

#### Diuretics

Congestion is the leading cause of hospitalization in patients with ADHF.28,29 Although robust evidence is lacking, clinical experience has demonstrated that diuretics effectively improve hemodynamics and congestive symptoms, even in the setting of de novo ADHF, in which pulmonary edema may occur without significant volume overload.<sup>30</sup> During ADHF hospitalization, net changes in weight and fluid balance are commonly used to assess response to decongestive therapies.<sup>31</sup>

Diuretics are classified according to their major site of action, chemical structure, or type of diuresis. Table 3.2 summarizes the doses and site of action of most diuretics commonly used in patients with acute and chronic HF. The optimal regimen is often influenced by renal function, preexisting diuretic therapy and urgency of decongestion. Loop diuretics, such as furosemide, torsemide, and bumetanide, have the most potent diuretic effect and remain the diuretic of choice for treating ADHF.30,32 These agents act by directly inhibiting the sodium–potassium–chloride cotransporter (NKCC) at the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. They also inhibit a second cotransporter isoform that is widely expressed throughout the body, including the ear, which probably explains the side effect of ototoxicity associated with their use.

Loop diuretics are organic anions that are heavily bound to proteins as they circulate, reaching the tubular lumen predominantly by active secretion rather than glomerular filtration and thus maintain efficacy unless renal function is severely impaired. While structurally similar as a class, these agents have substantial differences in pharmacokinetics. The oral bioavailability of furosemide ranges from 10% to 90% and is determined by absorption from the gastrointestinal tract into the bloodstream, which is decreased in patients with severe ADHF-associated bowel edema. In contrast, the oral bioavailability of torsemide and bumetanide remain high (>90%), making oral and intravenous (IV) doses similar.<sup>33</sup> In addition, torsemide has a longer half-life when compared to furosemide or bumetanide. In healthy individuals, an oral dose of a loop diuretic may be as effective as an IV dose because the diuretic bioavailability that is above the natriuretic threshold is approximately equal. However, the natriuretic threshold increases in patients with HF and the oral dose may not provide a high enough serum level to elicit a significant natriuresis.<sup>34</sup> Therefore, IV therapy is recommended in patients with ADHF to achieve a higher and consistent bioavailability, allowing rapid onset of action within few minutes.

dMinimal diuretic effect

Diuretic dosing should be individualized and titrated according to hemodynamic response. Patients on chronic loop diuretic therapy may need higher doses in the setting of acute decompensation of chronic HF. The DOSE trial prospectively compared diuretic strategies in patients with ADHF and suggested that 2.5 times the usual home dose is associated with better symptom improvement than low dose, at the cost of some renal impairment.35 The DOSE trial also showed no difference in outcomes between continuous IV infusion and intermittent bolus strategies, suggesting that both approaches could be considered when managing significant volume overload or diuretic resistance. Clinical experience, however, has demonstrated that when the effect of high-dose loop diuretic is suboptimal, a continuous infusion may be superior to reduce toxicity and maintain stable serum drug levels. Given the steep dose-response curve of loop diuretics, prompt doubling of dose at 2-hour intervals might allow the attainment of a ceiling dose earlier. Increasing the dose above the ceiling can lead to additional natriuresis by extending the time during which serum drug levels exceeds the natriuretic threshold, which makes it appear as if a ceiling does not exist.<sup>30</sup>

Impaired diuretic response is a common complication in patients with ADHF and is associated with increased rehospitalization and mortality. Although not fully understood, diuretic resistance is thought to result from a complex interplay between cardiac and renal dysfunction, specific renal adaptation, and escape mechanisms.30,33,36 In fact, the magnitude of natriuresis following a given dose of diuretics declines over time as a result of the braking phenomenon, an appropriate homeostatic response that prevents excessive volume depletion during continued diuretic therapy. However, in patients with secondary hyperaldosteronism, such as those with HF, this phenomenon can be pronounced, leading to an increased reabsorption of sodium and contributing to diuretic resistance.<sup>37</sup> Furthermore, chronic treatment with a loop diuretic results in compensatory hypertrophy of the distal tubular cells, which bypasses the proximal effect of the loop diuretic.<sup>38</sup>

The coexistence of HF and impaired renal function is another common cause of diuretic resistance, as decreased renal blood flow and impaired tubular secretion may lead to insufficient therapeutic urinary drug concentrations. Among these patients, it is important to distinguish between underlying kidney disease and cardiorenal syndrome, which is being increasingly recognized as a complication of ADHF. The pathways to these distinct conditions involve not only hemodynamic deterioration but also neurohormonal, inflammatory, and intrinsic renal mechanisms.<sup>39</sup> It is hypothesized that the cardiorenal syndrome may represent a backward failure, with elevated right-sided filling pressures contributing more to renal dysfunction than low cardiac output (CO).<sup>40</sup> Traditional therapy with diuretics can contribute to cardiorenal syndrome, probably by further neurohormonal activation and worsening intrarenal hemodynamics, while vasodilator or inotropic therapy has not been shown to help.<sup>39</sup> In most cases, however, worsening of renal function in the setting of aggressive diuresis may reflect hemodynamic or functional changes in glomerular filtration rather than actual renal tubular injury.<sup>41</sup> Because residual clinical congestion is a predictor of poor outcomes in HF, a small to moderate increase in the BUN/creatinine ratio should not prevent further diuretic therapy if clinical evidence of congestion is still present in patients with ADHF.42-44

A useful approach for overcoming diuretic resistance is by sequential nephron blockade, which is the concurrent use of diuretics acting upon different segments of the nephron to produce an additive or synergistic diuretic response.<sup>32</sup> There is some evidence that a stepped pharmacologic strategy with early assessment of urinary output and sequential nephron blockade might result in equal decongestion when compared to mechanical ultrafiltration (UF), without significant renal impairment.45-47 A post hoc analysis of the CARRESS-HF, DOSE, and ROSE-ADHF trials compared the efficacy of a urine-output guided diuretic adjustment versus standard high-dose loop diuretics therapy for the management of cardiorenal syndrome in patients with ADHF.<sup>46</sup> Compared with standard therapy, the stepped pharmacologic algorithm dosed to maintain urine output between 3 and 5 L/day resulted in greater weight change and more net fluid loss after 24 hours with slight improvement in renal function. A practical stepped pharmacologic algorithm to diuretic assessment in ADHF is reflected in Fig. 3.3.

Combined diuretic therapy using any of several thiazide-type diuretics can more than double daily natriuresis, although care must be taken for symptomatic hypotension, renal dysfunction, and electrolyte abnormalities.32,48,49 Both IV chlorothiazide and oral metolazone have been shown to provide significant increases in urine-output when added to furosemide monotherapy, with chlorothiazide inducing a larger diuretic effect but at higher costs and greater need for potassium replacement.48 There are no randomized controlled trials to establish whether a preferable thiazide exists in the treatment of ADHF.

Potassium-sparing diuretics, such as spironolactone, eplerenone, amiloride, and triamterene, should be considered to prevent hypokalemia associated with loop and thiazide diuretics use. Spironolactone and eplerenone are synthetic mineralocorticoidreceptor antagonists (MRAs) with a strong recommendation for patients with symptomatic chronic HFrEF, while amiloride and triamterene are epithelial sodium channel blockers that do not affect the mineralocorticoid receptor.1,2,50

The use of diuretics in heart failure with congestion—a position statement from the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology. Eur J Heart Fail 2019;21:137–155.)

Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, such as acetazolamide, potently inhibit sodium bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal tubules, resulting in increased sodium levels in the loop of Henle where loop diuretics may exert their natriuretic action. These agents may be particularly useful during concomitant metabolic alkalosis, but, when used repeatedly, can lead to metabolic acidosis and hypokalemia. Other potential drugs for further decongestion, such as the arginine vasopressin (AVP) antagonists, have been investigated as adjuncts to standard HF therapies and will be addressed in other sections.

Other approaches that may also be helpful in patients with diuretic resistance are UF or hypertonic saline solution (HSS 3%) administration. The potential benefit of veno-venous UF is the removal of isotonic fluid without neurohormonal activation seen with diuretics. A trial comparing UF to diuretic therapy in patients with ADHF showed that UF was associated with greater weight loss by 48 hours but no difference in dyspnea score when compared to the control group. UF was associated with a reduction in rehospitalization and unscheduled office visits.<sup>51</sup> By contrast, other trials have observed a higher frequency of adverse events in patients treated with UF, including worsening of renal function in the CARRESS-HF and venous access complications in the AVOID-HF, which was not completed by the sponsor.45,52 Based on these concerns, current HF guidelines do not recommend routine use of UF, which should be restricted to patients with congestion not responding to a stepped-care diuretic strategy. HSS 3% administration along with high-dose furosemide in selected hyponatremic patients with systemic congestion and renal dysfunction may be associated with greater clinical response and renal function preservation.53,54 However, routine use of HSS 3% is controversial and further studies are needed before use can be endorsed.

# Vasodilators

Although there is no robust evidence to support their routine use, IV vasodilators are the second most commonly used agents to relieve congestive symptoms in patients with ADHF.55-57 Some vasodilators may act primarily on arterial resistance, leading to a decrease in afterload, while others act predominantly on venous capacitance with consequent reduction in preload. Most vasodilators, however, have balanced action on both afterload and preload.

Vasodilators are indicated in situations of pulmonary and systemic edema with or without hypoperfusion and are particularly helpful during hypertensive ADHF. However, they must be used with caution in patients who are preload or afterload dependent, such as those with severe diastolic dysfunction or aortic stenosis, since these agents can cause significant hypotension. Moreover, the use of vasodilators requires intensive BP monitoring and dose titration, and they should be avoided in patients with hypotension, hypovolemia, and recent use of phosphodiesterase (PDE)-5 inhibitors such as sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil.

As a class, traditional direct-acting vasodilators, such as organic nitrates, sodium nitroprusside, and nesiritide (Table 3.3), act as an exogenous source of nitric oxide (NO) to activate soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), producing cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and consequent vascular smooth muscle relaxation (Fig. 3.4).55 Conversely, novel vasodilator agents targeting new pathways have been developed, including serelaxin, natriuretic peptides, neurohormonal antagonists, and sGC stimulators and sGC activators.

#### Organic Nitrates

Organic nitrates, such as nitroglycerin, isosorbide dinitrate, and isosorbide mononitrate, reduce ventricular preload primarily via venodilation. At higher doses, especially in the presence of

**Fig. 3.4** Nitric oxide, nitroprusside, and nesiritide stimulate guanylate cyclase to form cyclic guanosine monophosphate (*cGMP*) with vasodilatory properties. *GTP*, *guanosine-5'-triphosphate*; *LDL*, low-density lipoprotein; *LVH*, left ventricular hypertrophy; *SH*, Sulfhydryl. (Figure © L.H. Opie, 2012.)

vasoconstriction, these agents can decrease systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and left ventricular (LV) afterload, consequently increasing stroke volume (SV) and CO. 55 Nitrates are also partially selective for epicardial coronary arteries, thus justifying use in ADHF associated with ACS. 57

Nitrate indication is largely based upon hemodynamic response and expert opinion, as evidence is scarce and has relatively limited methodological quality. <sup>58,59</sup> Intravenous administration is recommended for greater bioavailability and ease of titration. Low initial doses of nitroglycerin (NTG) are recommended, with rapid up-titration increments every 5 minutes as required and tolerated. Aggressive early up-titration of NTG is associated with a significant reduction in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) that reaches a maximum effect at 2 to 3 hours and declines subsequently within the following 24 hours due to tachyphylaxis. <sup>60</sup> Tachyphylaxis is described as a rapid and significant attenuation of hemodynamic effects, limiting NTG usefulness in the treatment of patients with ADHF. The most common side effects of NTG are hypotension, headache, and nausea.

#### Sodium Nitroprusside

In contrast to NTG, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) causes balanced arterial and venous dilation, therefore reducing both the preload and the afterload. The use of SNP in patients with ADHF results in a significant decrease in systemic BP, right atrial pressure (RAP), pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), PCWP, SVR, and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). SNP has a very short half-life, of seconds to a few minutes, and is particularly effective in the setting of ADHF secondary to elevated afterload such as acute aortic or mitral regurgitation, ventricular septal rupture, or hypertensive emergency.<sup>61</sup>

Administration of SNP requires close hemodynamic monitoring due to its potent hemodynamic effects. Although severe hypotension is rare and resolves quickly, significant vasodilation of the intramyocardial vasculature may cause a "coronary steal" phenomenon. Therefore, SNP is not recommended in the setting of ACS. Also, sudden withdrawal may cause a "rebound hypertension" effect and gradual tapering is advised, ideally transitioning to oral vasodilators.

The major limitation to the use of SNP is its metabolism to cyanide. When doses >400 μg/min are used for long periods of time, especially in patients with renal and/or hepatic dysfunction, the accumulation of SNP metabolites can lead to the development of cyanide, or rarely thiocyanate, toxicity, which may be fatal. The first sign of cyanide toxicity is lactic acidosis, and the most common side effects of thiocyanate toxicity are mental status changes, nausea, and abdominal pain. Thiocyanate can be removed with dialysis, and cyanide toxicity has been successfully managed with infusions of thiosulfate, sodium nitrate, and hydroxycobalamin.<sup>57</sup> There are no randomized clinical trials of SNP in patients with ADHF and, as with NTG, their indication is based upon hemodynamic response and expert opinion.

#### Nesiritide

Nesiritide is a synthetic analogue form of the human B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), manufactured from Escherichia coli with recombinant DNA technology. It causes balanced arterial and venous dilation, resulting in significant reductions in filling pressures and mild increases in CO.

In patients with ADHF, the administration of nesiritide has been investigated more extensively than both NTG and SNP. The VMAC trial tested the safety and efficacy of nesiritide in patients with ADHF and reported a significantly greater decrease in PCWP compared to both NTG and placebo, with no evidence of tachyphylaxis.<sup>60</sup> Nesiritide, but not NTG, was also associated with significant improvements in patient-reported dyspnea at 3 hours. The ASCEND-HF trial tested nesiritide in a broad population of patients with ADHF and demonstrated a modest improvement in dyspnea when compared to placebo, but no difference in the composite outcome of death or HF hospitalization at 30 days.<sup>62</sup> While there was no increase in renal failure with nesiritide, the incidence of symptomatic hypotension was higher with nesiritide. Those findings were consistent with the latter ROSE-ADHF trial, which assessed the effects of low-dose nesiritide in patients with ADHF and showed no benefits on urine output, congestion, renal function, or clinical outcomes, but more symptomatic hypotension.<sup>63</sup>

Because of its high cost and lack of clear clinical benefit beyond other vasodilator therapies, such as NTG or SNP, nesiritide is not recommended as a first-line drug for patients with ADHF. Neither should it be used for the indication of replacing diuretic therapy, enhancing natriuresis, preventing cardiorenal syndrome, or improving survival. However, in selected patients who remain symptomatic despite standard therapy, a trial of nesiritide may be helpful.

# Novel Vasodilators

Given the central role of vasodilator therapy in ADHF, there has been considerable enthusiasm for developing other types of vasodilator therapies. Serelaxin is a recombinant form of the human peptide relaxin-2, a hormone that regulates CV and renal adaptation to improve arterial compliance during pregnancy in humans.<sup>64</sup> It acts primarily via receptor-based increase of intracellular NO, with additional activation of matrix metalloproteinases, upregulation of endothelin type-B receptors, and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Low-dose serelaxin decreases RAP and PCWP, while high-dose increases CO.<sup>65</sup> The RELAX-ADHF trial tested the efficacy of serelaxin by randomizing patients with ADHF to a 48-hour infusion of either serelaxin or placebo within 16 hours of hospital presentation.<sup>66</sup> Serelaxin improved short-term dyspnea and was associated with reduced worsening signs or symptoms of HF, shorter hospital length of stay (LOS), and improved biomarkers of end-organ dysfunction including troponin, N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP), creatinine, and transaminases. Following a similar protocol, RELAX-ADHF-2 trial aimed to confirm the beneficial effects of serelaxin on CV mortality and worsening HF, but failed to meet either of its primary outcomes.<sup>64</sup> These seemingly contradictory results suggest that serelaxin decongests the system rapidly, but with no improvement in CV outcomes.

Ularitide is a synthetic form of urodilatin, another natriuretic peptide, which is produced in the distal renal tubules with vasodilating, natriuretic, and diuretic effects. The TRUE-ADHF trial randomized patients with ADHF to continuous infusion of ularitide or placebo for 48 hours and found no difference in the risk of long-term CV mortality between the groups despite ularitide improving PCWP, SVR, CI, and dyspnea.<sup>67</sup> Additionally, ularitide increased creatinine associated with a doubling of hypotension.

Neurohormonal antagonism started aggressively during ADHF hospitalization and on top of more established therapy has been tested in large-scale trials, with mostly disappointing results. The ASTRONAUT trial found that the addition of aliskiren, a direct renin inhibitor (DRI), to standard ADHF therapy did not reduce mortality or hospitalization outcomes and was associated with higher rates of hyperkalemia, renal dysfunction, and hypotension.<sup>68</sup> Likewise, there was no benefit with tezosentan, a nonselective endothelin antagonist, or TRV027, an angiotensin type-1 (AT-1) receptor antagonist, over matching placebo in the VERITAS and BLAST-ADHF trials, respectively.69,70 In contrast, the PIONEER-HF trial showed that sacubitril–valsartan, an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), reduced NT-proBNP to a greater degree than enalapril among eligible patients admitted with acute decompensated HF.71 Of note, side effects including hyperkalemia and hypotension were similar between the two drugs. Nevertheless, because reduction in biomarkers is a surrogate outcome, a larger trial powered for clinical outcomes is warranted.

The sGC stimulators and the sGC activators have a mechanism of action similar to that of organic nitrates, since both classes of drugs activate the sGC in smooth muscle cells, thus leading to the synthesis of cGMP and subsequent vasodilation. However, unlike traditional nitrates, sGC stimulators and sGC activators can induce sGC in its NO-insensitive state. Intravenous cinaciguat showed dosedependent improvement in hemodynamic parameters but failed to demonstrate effectiveness in clinical trials for ADHF due to a high incidence of treatment induced hypotensive events requiring emergency intervention.<sup>72</sup> Subsequently, oral vericiguat was evaluated in two dose-finding studies within the SOCRATES program. In the SOCRATES-REDUCED trial, vericiguat showed a significant reduction in NT-proBNP and a trend toward fewer hospitalizations in patients with HFrEF.<sup>73</sup> In the SOCRATES-PRESERVED trial, it did not change NT-proBNP but was associated with better quality-of-life assessments in patients with HFpEF.<sup>74</sup> Recently, the oral sGC stimulator vericiguat was tested in the VICTORIA trial, which randomized patients with NYHA class II-IV HF, LVEF 45%, and a recent decompensation event to receive vericiguat or placebo. Over a median follow-up of 10.8 months, the incidence of CV death or HF hospitalization was significantly lower among patients receiving vericiguat, but there was no difference in all-cause mortality. Vericiguat was safe and well tolerated and did not require monitoring of renal function or electrolytes.<sup>75</sup>

Several other agents can reduce afterload and improve hemodynamic parameters, such as nitroxyl donors, short-acting calcium channel blockers, and potassium channel activators. However, robust randomized clinical trials for such agents are lacking.

### Inotropes

Inotropic agents should be considered selectively in patients with advanced HF and low CO syndrome resulting in hypoperfusion, hypotension (relative and absolute), and end-organ dysfunction to prevent hemodynamic collapse and stabilize the clinical situation. They are also a reasonable pharmacologic bridge to cardiac transplantation in patients with end-stage HF.

The mechanism of action for most inotropes involves their ability to increase intracellular calcium, either by increasing influx into the cell or stimulating releasefrom the sarcoplasmic reticulum. However, there is long-standing concern that even short-term use of IV inotropes might lead to hypotension, atrial or ventricular arrhythmias, and death.76-79 In particular, patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) may be at higher risk of further myocardial ischemia due to reduced coronary perfusion and increased oxygen consumption. In any case, inotropic therapy should be started at very low doses, uptitrated under close monitoring, and discontinued as soon as appropriate organ perfusion is reestablished (Table 3.4). Inotropes are not indicated in patients with HFPEF, and there is limited evidence to suggest that one particular agent is better than another.

# β-Adrenergic Agonists

#### Dobutamine

Dobutamine is the most widely used β-adrenergic agent for inotropic support. It is a synthetic analog of dopamine, with strong β<sup>1</sup> agonist activity as well as minor effects on β2-and α1-receptors. It has been suggested that the inotropic activity of dobutamine results from combined β<sup>1</sup> and α<sup>1</sup> stimulation in the myocardium. β1-stimulation enhances cardiac contractility through increases in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and calcium. At low doses, β2-stimulation generally offsets α1-adrenergic activity, resulting in peripheral artery vasodilation that occasionally may lead to symptomatic hypotension. At higher doses, though, peripheral vasoconstriction predominates through vascular

α1-receptor stimulation. Since it has no dopaminergic effects, dobutamine is less prone to induce hypertension than is dopamine.

Dobutamine provides hemodynamic support with a dosedependent increase in SV and CO and modest decreases in SVR and PCWP, referred to as an inodilatory effect. Lower doses might improve perfusion in patients with cardiogenic shock, but higher doses are generally recommended for more profound hypoperfusion states.

Dobutamine may induce serious atrial and ventricular arrhythmias at any infusion dose, particularly in the context of myocarditis and electrolyte imbalance. It also increases heart rate (HR) and myocardial oxygen demand and should be used cautiously in patients with recent myocardial ischemia. Hypersensitivity to dobutamine is a rare and unrecognized cause of eosinophilic myocarditis after prolonged infusion. Also, β-receptors may be downgraded or therapeutically blocked in patients with advanced HF so that intolerance to dobutamine may ensue. In the absence of cardiogenic shock, either levosimendan or milrinone could be alternatives for treating ADHF when β-blockade is thought to be contributing to hypoperfusion.<sup>80</sup>

Clinical trials and HF registries have documented excess mortality in patients receiving intermittent or continuous dobutamine infusion, despite its beneficial hemodynamic effects.81-83 Thus, dobutamine should be restricted to HF patients with pulmonary congestion and low CO syndrome. In this setting, dobutamine appears to be as effective as milrinone.<sup>84</sup>

#### Dopamine

Dopamine is a catecholamine-like agent, with complex effects that vary greatly with dose. At low doses, dopamine acts primarily on dopamine-1 receptors to dilate renal, splanchnic, and cerebral arteries. Although it has been proposed that dopamine might improve renal blood flow promoting natriuresis through direct distal tubular effects, data supporting such a potential benefit are limited. The DAD-HF study suggested that a combination of low-dose furosemide and low-dose dopamine as a continuous infusion for 8 hours was equally effective as high-dose furosemide but associated with improved potassium homeostasis and preservation of renal function.<sup>85</sup> The follow-up DAD-HF II trial, however, found no differences in mortality rates, HF hospitalization, or overall dyspnea relief with the combined therapy.86 These findings are consistent with the ROSE-ADHF trial, which found that neither low-dose dopamine nor low-dose nesiritide enhanced decongestion or improved renal function in patients with ADHF.63 Notably, both DAD-HF II and ROSE-ADHF studies showed a higher incidence of tachycardia in the dopamine group.

At intermediate doses, dopamine acts as a precursor in the synthesis of norepinephrine (NE), an agonist of both adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors, and an inhibitor of NE reuptake, increasing SV and CO with variable effects on HR. Both the β1-stimulation and the rapid release of NE can precipitate tachycardia as well as atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Tachyphylaxis to the inotropic effects of dopamine may develop, in part, because myocardial NE stores often become depleted in patients with advanced HF.

At higher doses, dopamine also stimulates α-receptors leading to pulmonary and peripheral artery vasoconstriction. In the treatment of shock, dopamine compares similarly to NE as the first-line vasopressor agent with respect to 28-day mortality but is associated with an increased risk of arrhythmias.<sup>87</sup> Also, vasoconstriction dosages carry significant risk of precipitating limb and end-organ ischemia and should be used with caution. Discontinuation from high infusion rates should be done gradually to no less than 3 μg/kg/min, to minimize potential hypotensive response of lowdose dopamine.

#### Epinephrine

Epinephrine is the first-line vasopressor for cardiac arrest and anaphylactic shock. It acts as a complete β-receptor agonist, with dose-dependent α-agonism effect at higher doses. At lower doses, epinephrine acts predominantly on β1-receptors, with less prominent effects on β<sup>2</sup> and α1, resulting in an overall increase in CO with balanced vasodilator and vasoconstrictor effects. At higher doses, it increases SVR and BP, with combined inotropic and vasopressor effect. Common side effects, particularly at high doses, include tachycardia, arrhythmias, poor peripheral perfusion, headaches, anxiety, cerebral hemorrhage, and pulmonary edema. There is also a risk of local tissue necrosis with extravasation.

#### Isoproterenol

This relatively pure β-stimulant should be considered in cardiogenic shock secondary to bradycardia or when excessive β-blockade is thought to be contributing to hypoperfusion. It increases inotropy and chronotropy through β1-stimulation, with a variable response on BP, depending upon the degree of concomitant β2-vasodilator stimulation. The cardiac effects of isoproterenol may lead to palpitations, sinus tachycardia, and more serious arrhythmias. Other common side effects are hypotension, angina pectoris, flushing, headache, restlessness, and sweating. Patients with IHD may be at higher risk of further myocardial ischemia due to increased oxygen consumption. Also, there are some concerns regarding cost effectiveness of isoproterenol when compared to significantly cheaper alternative chronotropic agents.

# Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors

Intravenous PDE-3 inhibitors, such as milrinone and enoximone (also available for oral use), decrease the rate of cAMP degradation, leading to enhanced inotropy, chronotropy, and lusitropy in cardiomyocytes. They also cause significant peripheral and pulmonary vasodilation via inhibition of vascular PDE, reducing preload and afterload while increasing contractility (Fig. 3.5).

Since PDE-3 inhibitors do not act via β-receptor stimulation, their effects are not offset by concomitant β-blocker therapy as are those of dobutamine or dopamine. Additionally, this independence of adrenergic pathways also allows for synergistic effects with the β-agonist inotropes. Nevertheless, while the hemodynamic effects of PDE-3 inhibitors can be helpful for short-term support, the increased levels of myocardial cAMP predispose to life-threatening arrhythmias, and the routine use of these agents for periods longer than 48 hours is not recommended. Milrinone is widely available for clinical use. Intravenous infusions may be started with a slow bolus over 10–20 minutes, which is often omitted due to hypotensive effects. The dose requires adjustments in the presence of renal dysfunction.

Major side effects include hypotension and atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. The OPTIME-CHF trial compared the effects of short-term IV milrinone versus placebo in patients with acute decompensation of chronic HF not requiring inotropic support. It showed that routine use of IV milrinone for ADHF was not associated with a reduction in hospital-based resource utilization at 60 days but increased the risk of sustained hypotension and atrial arrhythmias.<sup>77</sup> In addition, a later subanalysis revealed increased mortality and rehospitalization in patients with IHD receiving milrinone when compared to placebo.<sup>88</sup> Retrospective analysis of the ADHERE registry also found an increased in-hospital mortality associated with dobutamine or milrinone when compared to NTG or nesiritide.<sup>83</sup> However, given that sicker patients were treated with inotropes, it is difficult to know if the adjustments were sufficient.

# Calcium Sensitizers

Calcium sensitizers increase the sensitivity of troponin C fibers to ionic calcium that is already available in the cytoplasm, improving myocardial contractility with no additional calcium overload and

minimal increase in oxygen demand. The most widely studied calcium sensitizer is levosimendan, while pimobendan is primarily used as a veterinary medication. <sup>89</sup> Neither levosimendan nor pimobendan, however, are pure calcium sensitizers, as both share some PDE-3 inhibitor activity that may be partially responsible for their inotropic and vasodilator properties. Levosimendan exerts additional pleiotropic effects through the opening of potassium-dependent adenosine triphosphate (ATP) channels in vascular smooth muscle cells and mitochondria. <sup>90</sup>

Although not approved for any use in the United States, levosimendan is currently available worldwide, including some countries in Europe and South America. It is indicated as short-term therapy for patients with ADHF who need inotropic support in the absence of severe hypotension. Intravenous infusions may be given with a bolus over 10 minutes, which is usually omitted due to the risk of significant hypotension. Due to an active long-acting metabolite, the hemodynamic effects of levosimendan can last for up to at least a week after stopping the infusion.<sup>91</sup>

Despite a dose-dependent improvement in indices of cardiac performance, including a reduction in PCWP and afterload and an increase in CO, there is limited evidence of clinical benefit from levosimendan therapy. Initial clinical studies, such as LIDO and RUSSLAN, suggested a survival advantage from levosimendan when compared to dobutamine or placebo, respectively.81,92 The sequential more definitive trials REVIVE I and REVIVE II demonstrated a significant improvement in symptoms, BNP level, and hospital LOS with levosimendan therapy. However, there were more episodes of hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias in the levosimendan group, as well as a nonsignificant increase in early mortality when compared to placebo.<sup>93</sup> The SURVIVE trial demonstrated no survival difference between levosimendan and dobutamine during long-term follow-up of patients with ADHF despite evidence for an early reduction of plasma BNP level with levosimendan. Levosimendan therapy was also associated with more episodes of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and hypokalemia.<sup>80</sup>

# Novel Inotropes

#### Omecamtiv Mecarbil

Omecamtiv mecarbil is a direct cardiac myosin activator that enhances effective actin-myosin cross-bridge formation and creates a force-producing state that is not associated with cytosolic calcium accumulation. Thus, omecamtiv mecarbil is believed to act as a calcium-sensitizer with pure inotropy action and no pleiotropic effects. Earlier studies have shown that it is safe, well tolerated, and produces dose-dependent increases in systolic ejection time, SV, EF, and fractional shortening.<sup>94</sup> In the ATOMIC-AHF trial, IV omecamtiv mecarbil did not meet the primary outcome of dyspnea improvement in patients with ADHF compared to placebo, except in the higher-dose group. It did, however, increase systolic ejection time and decrease LV endsystolic diameter.<sup>95</sup>

#### Istaroxime

Istaroxime is an investigational drug that mediates lusitropism through inhibition of sodium-potassium ATPase and stimulation of the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase type 2a (SER-CA2a). In the phase 2 HORIZON-HF trial, the addition of istaroxime to standard therapy lowered PCWP and HR and increased systolic BP in patients with ADHF. Also, higher doses of istaroxime appeared to be associated with more improvement in diastolic function.<sup>96</sup> The role of this agent remains uncertain at this time.

#### Vasopressors

Vasopressor therapy should be reserved for patients with persistent hypotension, especially in the management of cardiogenic shock when hypoperfusion is evident despite optimization of filling pressures. Vasopressors increase vasoconstriction, which leads to increased SVR and mean arterial pressure (MAP), improving end-organ perfusion at the cost of peripheral perfusion and increased afterload. Among patients without preexisting cardiac dysfunction under vasopressor therapy, CO is either maintained or actually increased. However, the impact on CO in HF patients will depend on the balance between contractility improvement and afterload increase. Therefore, it is generally recommended to begin vasopressor therapy at very low doses, often in combination with inotropes.

The most often used vasopressors are NE, high-dose dopamine, high-dose epinephrine, vasopressin, and phenylephrine (Table 3.4). NE has a high affinity for α1-receptors and moderate affinity for β-adrenergic receptors (Fig. 3.6), resulting in marked vasoconstriction with mild to modest increase in HR, CO, and myocardial oxygen demand. In general, NE is the vasopressor of choice for generalized shock. The SOAP II trial evaluated first-line vasopressor selection in patients with generalized shock and showed that, among the prespecified cardiogenic shock subgroup, dopamine was associated with a higher risk of death and arrhythmia when compared to NE.87 Although the SOAP II trial was the largest study in patients with generalized shock, a scientific statement from the American Heart Association (AHA) raised questions about the external validity and applicability of the findings in the subgroup with cardiogenic shock.97 Therefore, NE might be the vasopressor of choice in many patients with shock, especially those presenting with arrhythmias, but whether it the optimal first-line vasoactive medication to treat cardiogenic shock remains unclear. Side effects include tachycardia, reflex bradycardia, anxiety, pulmonary edema, headache,

#### *ADRENERGIC TERMINAL NEURON*

![](_page_24_Figure_2.jpeg)

Fig. 3.6 Neuromodulation of vascular tone. Upper panel, terminal neuron; lower panel, vascular smooth muscle (VSM). Adrenergic sympathetic depolarization (top left) leads to release of norepinephrine (NE) from the storage granules of the terminal neurons into the synaptic cleft that separates the terminals from the arterial wall to act on postsynaptic vasoconstrictive β1-receptors. NE also stimulates presynaptic β2-receptors to invoke feedback inhibition of its own release, to modulate excess release of NE. Vagal cholinergic stimulation releases nitric oxide (NO), which acts on muscarinic receptors (subtype two, M2) to inhibit the release of NE, thereby indirectly causing vasodilation. Circulating epinephrine (EPI) stimulates vascular vasodilatory β2-receptors but also presynaptic receptors on the nerve terminal that promote release of NE. Angiotensin-II (A-II) formed in response to renin released from the kidneys in shock-like states is also powerfully vasoconstrictive, acting both by inhibition of NE release (presynaptic receptors, schematically shown to the left of the terminal neuron) and also directly on arteriolar receptors. (Figure © L.H. Opie, 2012.)

and hypertension. As with all catecholamines and vasodilators, there is risk of local tissue necrosis with extravasation.

Phenylephrine is a selective α1-receptor agonist with potent arterial vasoconstrictor effect and minimal cardiac inotropy or chronotropy. It is particularly useful in patients with severe hypotension related to systemic vasodilation, such as septic shock, rather than to a decrease in CO. Thus, it should be reserved for patients in whom NE is contraindicated due to arrhythmias or who have failed other vasopressors.

As noted above, both dopamine and epinephrine may also be used for their vasoconstrictor properties. Dopamine is a precursor of NE and epinephrine, which acts in a dose-dependentfashion on dopaminergic receptors as well as α- and β-receptors. Epinephrine has essentiallyα1- andβ- activity, increasing SVR, HR, CO, and BP (Fig. 3.6).

Angiotensin II is a naturally occurring hormone secreted as part of the renin-angiotensin system that results in systemic vasoconstriction. In the ATHOS-3 trial, IV angiotensin II at a rate of 20 ng/kg/min adjusted to increase the mean arterial BP to at least 75 mmHg effectively increased BP and reduced vasopressor needs in patients with refractory vasodilatory shock.<sup>98</sup> Although angiotensin II has been better studied in vasodilatory shock, it may be beneficial in both cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest as well.99

Vasopressin is an endogenous vasopressor stored mainly in the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland and myocardium.<sup>100</sup> In a retrospective study of 36 patients who developed cardiogenic shock after myocardial infarction (MI), IV vasopressin therapy increased mean arterial BP without adversely affecting PCWP, CI, urine output, or other inotropic requirements.<sup>101</sup> In a prospective randomized clinical trial of 48 patients, the combined infusion of vasopressin and NE proved to be superior to infusion of NE alone in the treatment of cardiocirculatory failure in catecholamineresistant vasodilatory shock.<sup>102</sup> A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials compared vasopressin or terlipressin, which is a vasopressin analog not available in the United States, with supportive care in vasodilatory shock and showed no difference in short-term mortality.<sup>103</sup> Currently, vasopressin is used as a second-line agent in refractory vasodilatory shock, particularly septic shock or anaphylaxis that is unresponsive to epinephrine.

# Special Situations

#### Acute Coronary Syndromes

The acute onset of severe myocardial ischemia, with or without infarction, can result in decreased CO and/or elevated filling pressures.104 The coexistence of ADHF within ACS identifies a high-risk cohort, for whom aggressive therapy aiming at reperfusion should be rapidly instituted. Primary angioplasty is the strategy of choice for patients with ST-elevation MI.105-107 Inopressor therapy can offer pharmacological support to improve hemodynamics during cardiogenic shock but should be administered at the lowest possible doses to avoid further ischemia. Inodilator agents are not recommended in the absence of shock.<sup>108</sup>

#### Hypertensive Emergency

Hypertensive ADHF accounts for approximately 10% of all ADHF cases, being most common in patients with HFpEF.<sup>7</sup> ADHF precipitates in the setting of markedly elevated afterload, and typically manifests as acute pulmonary edema. Aggressive BP reduction with IV vasodilators and diuretics is recommended. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) without significant myocardial depressant effects, such as nicardipine and clevidipine, may be helpful in patients presenting with hypertensive ADHF.<sup>109</sup> Intravenous clevidipine has a rapid onset of action, high clearance, and no effect on ventricular contractility or central venous pressure (CVP), and is currently approved for the acute management of severe hypertension. Intravenous esmolol, a β-blocker, may be also used, but it is contraindicated in severe bradycardia heart block, cardiogenic shock, and overt HF.

#### Right Ventricular Heart Failure

Isolated right-sided or right ventricular (RV) HF is generally caused by acute RV infarction, severe pulmonary hypertension, or acute pulmonary embolism. Acute RV infarction should be approached as any other ACS, including early reperfusion and primary angioplasty when indicated. However, patients with RV infarction are very preload-dependent and can develop severe hypotension in response to nitrates or other preload-reducing agents. Hemodynamic stabilization with careful volume loading to a goal CVP of 10–12 mmHg can be beneficial, especially in patients with MAP <60 mmHg.<sup>110</sup> After ensuring adequate filling pressures, inotropic support can further augment RV CO. However, these principals do not apply to chronic right-sided HF.

The RV is also sensitive to increases in afterload, which is affected by the PVR. Selective pulmonary artery vasodilation includes treatment with NO, prostacyclin analogues, endothelin receptor antagonists, or, less frequently, certain CCBs. Hemodynamically unstable patients due to acute pulmonary embolism should be treated with immediate reperfusion either with thrombolysis, catheter-based approach, or surgical embolectomy.

#### **Cardiogenic Shock**

Cardiogenic shock is defined as a state of sustained hypotension (systolic BP <90 mmHg for  $\geq \! 30$  min) and a reduced CI (<2.2 L/ min/m²) in the presence of normal or elevated PCWP (>15 mmHg) and inadequate tissue perfusion (e.g., elevation in lactate levels).  $^{97,111}$  Acute MI with LV dysfunction is the most frequent cause of cardiogenic shock.  $^7$  In patients with a recent ACS, mechanical complications such as papillary muscle rupture, ventricular septal defect, and free wall rupture may present as cardiogenic shock within 24 hours of hospitalization.  $^{112}$  Also, around 2%–6% patients may develop postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock following cardiac surgery. Therefore, immediate echocardiography is mandatory in all individuals presenting with cardiogenic shock. Other, less common etiologies include advanced valvular heart disease, arrhythmias, cardiac tamponade, cardiac constriction, pulmonary embolism, peripartum cardiomyopathy, acute coronary dissection, acute myocarditis, and drug poisoning.  $^{97}$ 

Fluid challenge for up to 30 minutes, either with saline or ringer lactate, is recommended as the first-line treatment if there is no sign of overt fluid overload. Pharmacological therapy with inotropic and vasopressor agents aims to improve organ perfusion by increasing CO and BP. Despite their frequent use, few clinical outcome data are available to guide the initial selection of such therapies in patients with cardiogenic shock. Dobutamine is the most used inotrope, while levosimendan may be an alternative to patients already on oral β-blockade. Norepinephrine is recommended as the first-line vasopressor agent in the treatment of shock, as the use of dopamine is associated with a greater number of adverse events, such as arrhythmia. 87 Short-term MCS, including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), may be considered as a bridge to heart transplantation or to other mechanical intervention in refractory cases. Currently, the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) is still the most widely used MCS device in cardiogenic shock. However, among patients with MI and cardiogenic shock, the use of an IABP did not improve mortality or any long-term secondary outcome in the IABP-SHOCK II trial. 115 Therefore, routine use of an IABP cannot be recommended.

# Heart Failure Patients With Reduced Ejection Fraction

#### Introduction

There has been substantial progress in the pharmacological management of chronic HF over the past three decades. The positive results of successive landmark clinical trials are reflected in clinical

practice guidelines, which, in turn, have become standard of HF care. In general, the goals of treatment are to improve symptoms, functional capacity, and general quality of life, prevent disease progression and recurrent admissions, and prolong survival. To accomplish these goals, HFrEF should be viewed as a continuum that comprises four interrelated stages with incremental therapy at each stage aimed at modifying risk factors (A), treating structural heart disease (B-D), and reducing morbidity and mortality.3,34

Currently, the recommendation for patients with stage A HF is largely preventive and should focus on risk factor modification and treatment of atherosclerotic vascular disease. There is robust evidence showing that the onset of HF may be delayed or prevented through interventions aimed at modifying risk factors or treating asymptomatic LV systolic dysfunction. The SPRINT trial showed that intensive BP control in subjects with a high CV risk was associated with a 38% relative risk reduction in the development of overt HF.116 In patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) without LV dysfunction, meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials have shown a modest benefit of angiotensin converting–enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, with a reduction in major CV outcomes, including HF.117 The antidiabetic sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors reduced the composite risk of CV death or HF hospitalization in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), regardless of established CV disease or HF.118-120 There is also reasonable evidence that intensive statin therapy, but not aspirin or other antiplatelet agents, may prevent or delay the onset of HF after ACS, with the most gain in patients with elevated levels of BNP.121,122

Several mechanisms contribute to the progression of HF, such as neurohormonal activation, endothelial dysfunction, venous congestion, and myocardial remodeling. Once patients have established structural heart disease, the choice of pharmacotherapy will depend on their NYHA functional class. For patients with structural heart disease but without signs or symptoms of HF (stage B), the therapeutic goal should be the prevention of further cardiac remodeling. In asymptomatic patients with chronically reduced LV ejection fraction (LVEF), an ACE inhibitor should be used to prevent the risk of HF hospitalization.123,124 In all patients with a recent or remote history of MI or ACS, β-blockers and ACE inhibitors should be used, regardless of LVEF. It is noteworthy that β-blocker therapy should only be initiated after acute MI has resolved to avoid the risk of cardiogenic shock.125,126

Symptomatic patients (stages C and D) have a worse prognosis, particularly after hospital admission for ADHF. The major goals of treatment in patients with structural heart disease and previous or current symptoms (stage C) are to alleviate symptoms and reduce morbidity by reversing or slowing the cardiac and peripheral dysfunction. Neurohormonal antagonists, such as ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), β-blockers, MRAs, and ARNIs, have been shown to improve outcomes in HFrEF and are recommended, unless contraindicated or not tolerated. More recently, the SGLT-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin was also associated with improved clinical outcomes among patients with symptomatic HFrEF, irrespective of T2DM status, signaling a new approach in the treatment of HF.

Additional pharmacological agents, such as hydralazine plus nitrate, ivabradine, and digoxin, should be considered in selected patients. Patients with refractory end-stage HF (stage D) may be eligible for specialized, advanced treatments, such as LV assist devices (LVADs) and heart transplantation.

#### Neurohormonal Activation

HFrEF classically develops after an index event that could be an acute injury to the heart, a long-standing hemodynamic overload, or a response to genetic variations that disrupt contractile function or lead to myocyte death. The circulatory changes that arise from impaired cardiac pumping and/or filling trigger a series of compensatory mechanisms referred to as neurohormonal activation. This historical term reflects early observations that many of the molecules that are elaborated in response to HFrEF are produced by the neuroendocrine system. However, most neurohormones such as NE and angiotensin II are now known to be synthesized directly within the myocardium and, therefore, act in an autocrine or paracrine manner.<sup>127</sup>

The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) are the major neurohormonal systems, working collectively to maintain CO through increased retention of salt and water, peripheral vasoconstriction, and increased contractility.<sup>128</sup> The activation of inflammatory mediators also contributes to maintain early CV homeostasis through cardiac repair and remodeling.<sup>129</sup> However, sustained and chronic neurohormonal activation has deleterious effects and leads to progressive ventricular remodeling and worsening HF.<sup>130</sup> Further activation of the natriuretic peptide (NP) system briefly offsets these harmful effects but is unable to sustain compensation for chronic neurohormonal activation over time.<sup>131</sup>

Neuroendocrine modulation with β-blockers targeting the SNS and ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and MRAs targeting the RAAS have become the cornerstone of medical therapy to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic HFrEF. Most recently, the ARNIs further improved clinical outcomes by targeting both the RAAS and the NP system.

# Pharmacotherapy

#### β-Blockers

SNS activation is one of the earliest responses to a decrease in CO, resulting in both increased release and decreased reuptake of catecholamines at adrenergic nerve endings.132,133 It plays a complex role in HF, with both beneficial and adverse effects. In the short term, catecholamine-mediated chronotropic and inotropic responses help to maintain CO while increased SVR and venous tone preserve BP and preload. NE and angiotensin II also mediate constriction of the efferent arterioles, allowing for stable glomerular filtration rate (GFR) despite a low renal perfusion, and stimulate sodium retention and volume expansion, improving SV via the Frank–Starling law.<sup>133</sup>

Over time, however, these responses become detrimental, resulting in disruptions of β-adrenergic signaling and impaired mobilization of intracellular calcium.<sup>128</sup> As a consequence, increased SNS activation has been implicated in the development and progression of HF through multiple mechanisms, involving cardiac, renal, and vascular function. In the heart, it may lead to downregulation and functional desensitization of β-adrenergic receptors, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, necrosis, apoptosis, and fibrosis. In the kidneys, SNS activation stimulates salt and water retention, attenuates response to natriuretic factors, and activates the RAAS, which in turn promotes a positive feedback loop that adversely affects hemodynamic and cardiac remodeling. In the peripheral vessels, it also mediates neurogenic vasoconstriction and vascular hypertrophy.132,134

The association between SNS activation, reflected by an increase in the plasma NE concentration, and mortality in patients with HFrEF raised the possibility of therapeutic efficacy for sympathetic inhibition. The potential mechanisms by which β-blockers improve outcomes in HFrEF are likely related to reducing the detrimental effects of sustained SNS activation by competitively antagonizing β-adrenergic receptors. Particular benefits might include decreased myocyte death from catecholamine-induced necrosis, antiarrhythmic and HR-lowering effects, upregulation of β1 receptors, and inhibition of renin secretion. In addition, β-blockers directly reduce myocardial oxygen consumption and BP, revert production of fetal protein isoforms, and prevent proapoptotic and cardiotoxic effects of cAMP-mediated calcium overload.135-137

β-Blockers also strongly modulate cardiac remodeling, improve symptoms, reduce hospitalizations, and prolong survival in patients with HFrEF. Recommendations for their use are mainly based on the outcomes of large randomized placebo-controlled trials. The three β-blockers that have been shown to reduce the risk of death in patients with chronic HFrEF are carvedilol, bisoprolol, and extended-release metoprolol succinate (CR/XL). Nebivolol was also associated with a reduction in the composite outcome of mortality or CV hospitalizations, but it did not reduce mortality alone and is not approved by the US Food a Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of HFrEF.

The MDC was the first randomized clinical trial testing a βblocker, the short-acting metoprolol tartrate, in subjects with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and NYHA class II-III.<sup>138</sup> At 12 months, the metoprolol group had significant improvement in quality-of-life assessments, LVEF, and exercise capacity. There was also a nonsignificant 34% relative risk reduction in the combined outcome of death or need for cardiac transplantation, which was driven entirely by the reduction in transplantation, since there was no difference in all-cause mortality. The following MERIT-HF trial also investigated the impact of metoprolol on mortality in subjects with symptomatic HFrEF. However, it was larger, included patients with IHD as well as idiopathic DCM, and used the metoprolol succinate, which has a better pharmacological profile than metoprolol tartrate because of its extended-release formulation (CR/XL) and longer half-life.<sup>139</sup> The MERIT-HF trial was stopped early at a mean follow-up of 12 months after an interim analysis demonstrated a 34% relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality in subjects with NYHA class II–IV HF and LVEF 40% with metoprolol CR/XL compared to placebo. Additional secondary outcomes showed a reduction in all-cause hospitalization and CV events. Of note, metoprolol CR/XL reduced mortality from both sudden cardiac death and progressive pump failure while nearly 95% of the study population was already taking a concomitant ACE inhibitor or ARB at baseline.

The first study performed with bisoprolol in HFrEF was the CIBIS trial, which showed a nonsignificant trend toward 20% lower mortality and 30% fewer HF hospitalizations at a mean follow-up of 1.9 years in the bisoprolol group.<sup>140</sup> The subsequent follow-up CIBIS-II trial had greater statistical power to detect a mortality benefit and included approximately four times as many subjects as did CIBIS.<sup>141</sup> The CIBIS-II was stopped early, at about 16 months, after the second interim analysis demonstrated a 34% relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality in patients with NYHA class III–IV HF and LVEF 35% with bisoprolol compared to placebo. At the time of CIBIS-II publishing, standard HFrEF therapy included diuretics, ACE inhibitors, nitrates, and digoxin. Other benefits of bisoprolol therapy, such as a reduction in the risk of sudden cardiac death, HF hospitalizations, and all-cause hospitalizations, were observed regardless of the HF etiology.

Of the three FDA-approved β-blockers for the treatment of HFrEF, carvedilol has been the most studied. The US Carvedilol Heart Failure Program was designed as a stratified clinical program consisting of four component trials to evaluate nonfatal outcomes in subjects with mild to severe HF and LVEF <35%. 142 Although mortality was not a predefined primary outcome for the combined trials, it was prospectively measured by a safety committee, which prematurely stopped the program at a mean follow-up of 6.5 months due to a highly significant 65% relative risk reduction in mortality associated with the use of carvedilol across all four trials. The following ANZ-Carvedilol trial was conducted primarily to determine the effect of carvedilol therapy on LVEF and exercise tolerance in subjects with HF due to ischemic heart disease. The study concluded that carvedilol therapy for 12 months reduced LV volumes and preserved exercise performance at a lower rate-pressure product. 143 At 19 months, there was also a significant 26% relative risk reduction in the clinical composite of death or hospitalization with carvedilol compared to placebo. However, the ANZ-Carvedilol trial was not powered to determine statistically significant effects on mortality, and therefore, the 24% relative risk reduction in mortality alone did not achieve statistical significance.

Taken together, the outcomes of the US Carvedilol HF Program and the ANZ-Carvedilol trial provided a strong rationale for other large, randomized mortality studies, such as the COPERNICUS and the CAPRICORN trials. The COPERNICUS trial was specifically designed to evaluate the impact of carvedilol in a population with more advanced HF than was studied in previous trials, including subjects with NYHA class III-IV and severely reduced LVEF <25%. 144 After a mean follow-up of 10.4 months, carvedilol was associated with a 34% relative risk reduction in annual mortality rates, as well as reductions in rehospitalizations, hospital length of stay, and cardiogenic shock when compared to placebo. In addition, subjects in the carvedilol group felt better and were less likely to develop any serious adverse event. The CAPRICORN trial tested the effects of carvedilol in patients with acute MI and LV dysfunction with LVEF < 40% and showed no difference in the prespecified primary composite outcome of mortality and CV hospitalization when compared to placebo. However, all-cause mortality was reduced by 23% in the carvedilol group, a magnitude nearly identical to the results of the BHAT trial, which tested propranolol in patients with acute MI and was published two decades before. 146 Importantly, almost all subjects in CAPRICORN were taking an ACE inhibitor, while approximately one-half had received thrombolysis and/or primary angioplasty.

Differences in  $\beta$ -blockers clinically used in HFrEF are associated to  $\beta_1$ -receptor selectivity, presence of  $\alpha_1$ -receptor antagonism,

antioxidant properties, and vasodilating effects.136 Both metoprolol and bisoprolol are second-generation agents that block β1-receptors to a much greater extent than β2-receptors, without antioxidant properties or vasodilating effects. Metoprolol is 75-fold selective, whereas bisoprolol has approximately 120-fold higher affinity for human β1-versus β2-receptors. This is important because their effects are mainly restricted to areas containing β<sup>1</sup> receptors, especially the heart and part of the kidney. Also, side effects linked to β2-blockade, such as bronchospasm, peripheral vasoconstriction, and abnormalities of glucose and lipid metabolism, are less common with β1-selective agents, although receptor selectivity weakens at higher doses. Conversely, carvedilol is a third-generation nonselective β-blocker that competitively blocks β1-, β2-, and α-receptors with some antioxidant properties. Approximately 80% of adrenergic receptors in the normal myocardium are β1-receptors. However, due to β<sup>1</sup> downregulation in HF, β<sup>2</sup> may rise up to 40% of the total adrenergic receptors.135,147 Interestingly, β<sup>2</sup> also mediates the effects of catecholamines in the heart, and as a result, it becomes a relatively important mediator of inotropic support and arrhythmogenic effects of sympathetic stimulation in patients with HF.148 The human heart also expresses α1-receptors, although at much lower levels than β-receptors. The importance of cardiac α1-receptors in the pathophysiology of HF is still controversial, but their role in the vasoconstriction of major arteries, such as the aorta, pulmonary arteries, mesenteric vessels, and coronary arteries, is well known. Consequently, carvedilol blockade of α1-receptors causes vasodilation of blood vessels and might help to improve afterload while posing a higher risk for hypotension.

The hypothesis that multiple adrenergic blockade is more effective than selective β1-adrenergic blockade was tested in the COMET trial, which remains the largest and most well-designed head-to-head trial of β-blockers in HF.<sup>149</sup> The COMET trial randomized subjects with NYHA class II–IV HF and LVEF 35% to carvedilol or short-acting metoprolol tartrate in addition to other standard therapies and showed that carvedilol was more effective in reducing all-cause mortality. The generalizability of these findings is limited given that the degree of β-blockade may not have been equivalent in the two arms of COMET. The mean dose of metoprolol achieved in COMET was lower than the ones given in the MDC and MERIT-HF trials, which resulted in significantly lesser HR reductions when compared to carvedilol. Another potential concern is that metoprolol tartrate differs from the extended-release metoprolol succinate (CR/XL) used in MERIT-HF, the main trial showing a survival benefit of metoprolol compared with placebo in HFrEF patients. Metoprolol tartrate produces a less sustained β1-blockade because of its shorter half-life and has not been shown to reduce mortality in the MDC trial. There have been no trials directly comparing outcomes on carvedilol and extended-release metoprolol succinate (CR/XL).

The COMET trial supports the hypothesis that meaningful differences exist in the clinical effects of different β-blockers, suggesting that their beneficial effects in HFrEF may not necessarily be a class effect. For instance, some β-blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, such as xamoterol, have been shown to increase, rather than reduce, mortality in patients with HFrEF.<sup>150</sup> Other βblockers, such as bucindolol and nebivolol, had a neutral effect on overall mortality rates in the BEST and SENIORS trials. Bucindolol is a third-generation nonselective β-blocker, with additional weak α-blocking properties and some intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Although it failed to reduce total mortality in the BEST trial, a prespecified subanalysis suggested a survival benefit restricted to white participants that might be secondary to a polymorphism in β1-receptors in that population.<sup>151</sup> Nebivolol is a selective β1-receptor antagonist with some vasodilatory effects that are partially mediated by NO production via activation of β3-adrenergic receptors. It is approximately 3.5 times more β1-selective than bisoprolol and, along with carvedilol, is one of the few β-blockers to cause vasodilation. The SENIORS trial tested the effects of nebivolol on mortality and morbidity in patients 70 years old with stable HF.152 At a mean follow-up of 21 months, nebivolol therapy resulted in a significant 14% relative risk reduction in the primary composite outcome of all-cause mortality or CV hospitalizations compared to placebo but did not reduce all-cause mortality. In the United States, nebivolol is only approved for the treatment of hypertension, while in Europe it is registered for use in hypertension and HF as well.

Overall, the results of the COMET, BEST, and SENIORS trials highlight the importance of using doses and formulations of βblockers with proven benefit in clinical trials. In accordance with clinical practice guidelines recommendations, β-blockers should be up-titrated to reach maximally tolerated doses whenever possible. Evidence-based doses for recommended β-blockers are listed in Table 3.5. However, the abrupt withdrawal of adrenergic support may lead to exacerbation of congestive HF and significant negative chronotropy. Thus, therapy with β-blockers is recommended for clinically stable patients and should be initiated at very low doses and up-titrated gradually, with dose doubling no earlier than every 2 weeks as tolerated. Nevertheless, patients may experience some fluid retention within the first 3–5 days of treatment and should be advised to weigh themselves on a daily basis. Fluid retention can be managed by increasing the diuretic dose until weight returns to baseline and should not prevent future up-titration of the β-blocker.

Other commonly mentioned noncardiac side effects of βblockers include exacerbation of reactive airway disease, increased peripheral vascular resistance, depression, fatigue, insomnia, and sexual dysfunction. Hence, despite extensive evidence of clinical efficacy, several HF registries have shown that the use and dose of β-blockers is often suboptimal, possibly due to side effects or intolerance.136,153 Reasons for β-blocker discontinuation have differed across registries, but generally include worsening of HF symptoms, bradycardia, hypotension, dizziness, and fatigue.

β-Βlocker selection may affect tolerability, as patients with reactive airway disease may benefit from β1-selective blockers, while those with peripheral vascular disease may benefit from carvedilol, given its vasodilatory effects. The CIBIS-ELD trial was designed to compare the tolerability of bisoprolol and carvedilol during attempted titration to guideline-recommended target doses after 12 weeks of treatment in elderly subjects with chronic HF.<sup>154</sup> It showed that adverse bradycardia was more common with bisoprolol, whereas pulmonary events were more common with carvedilol. Lipophilic β-blockers, such as metoprolol, can cause sleep disturbances, insomnia, vivid dreams, and nightmares, due to the high penetration across the blood–brain barrier. Furthermore, intolerance may not be a class effect, as 80% of subjects considered intolerant to one β-blocker might be successfully changed to another. Actually, contrary to early reports, β-blocker therapy is well tolerated by 90% of HF patients, including those with diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive lung disease, and peripheral vascular disease.136,155

Severe bradycardia and asthma with active bronchospasm remain the most important contraindications to β-blockade. The dose of β-blocker should be adjusted if HR decreases to <50 beats/min or in the setting of second- or third-degree heart block. Symptomatic hypotension can be managed by decreasing the diuretic dose. Finally, continuation, but not introduction, of βblocker treatment during an episode of ADHF is safe, although dose reduction may be necessary.<sup>156</sup>

# Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors

The RAAS plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of HF, with effects on cardiac remodeling, vascular tone, endothelial function, sodium retention, oxidative stress, fibrosis, sympathetic tone, and inflammation. The likely mechanisms for RAAS activation include renal hypoperfusion, reduced filtered sodium, and increased SNS stimulation of the kidney, leading to increased renin release from juxtaglomerular apparatus.128,132

ACE inhibitors have many short- and long-term biological effects that are beneficial in patients with chronic HFrEF, and the evidence supporting their efficacy has been consistently demonstrated in large randomized clinical trials. These agents prevent the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which is formed by the proteolytic action of renin on circulating angiotensinogen. Angiotensin II is a peptide hormone that causes vasoconstriction, modulates SNS activation, and mediates aldosterone and vasopressin secretion, both associated with abnormal fluid retention and volume regulation in HF.127,157 It also promotes a prothrombotic state and abnormal cellular growth. Through RAAS modulation, ACE inhibitors have a consistent effect in increasing plasma renin while decreasing angiotensin II, aldosterone, NE, epinephrine, and vasopressin. Therefore, they reduce SNS activity and improve arterial tone, endothelial function and ventricular compliance, contributing to a decrease in ventricular afterload and cardiac remodeling. In addition, because ACE is identical to kininase II, ACE inhibitors may also lead to the upregulation of bradykinin, an inflammatory mediator with vasodilator properties. These actions may potentially enhance the effects of angiotensin II suppression and further contribute to the vasodilatory effects of ACE inhibitors.

In the era before ACE inhibitors, the V-HeFT trial demonstrated that a combined vasodilator therapy with hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate (H-ISDN) conferred a nonsignificant survival benefit in subjects with HFrEF.158 Subsequently, several prospective, randomized pivotal trials have demonstrated a significant survival benefit with ACE inhibitors in that population. The CONSENSUS trial randomized subjects with NYHA class IV HFrEF to enalapril or placebo in addition to standard medical therapy, which until the late 1980s focused primarily on symptom control through use of digitalis, diuretics, and nitrates. The intervention group had a significant 40% relative risk reduction in 6-month mortality.<sup>130</sup> Enalapril was also associated with significant reductions in NYHA class and is the requirement for further HF therapies.

The SOLVD trial randomized subjects with NYHA class II–IV HFrEF to enalapril or placebo and showed a 16% relative risk reduction in the 4-year mortality in the enalapril group, predominantly due to a reduction in the risk of HF mortality.<sup>159</sup> There was also a reduction in the risk of CV hospitalizations and in the enddiastolic LV volume index, which began a recurring observation that some disease-modifying therapies in HFrEF also cause reverse remodeling.137,160 Published at the same time as the SOLVD trial, the V-HeFT II showed that enalapril was superior to H-ISDN in patients with NYHA class II–III HFrEF, providing evidence that ACE inhibition improves HF outcomes through additional mechanisms than just vasodilation.<sup>161</sup>

Enalapril is the only ACE inhibitor that has been used in placebo-controlled mortality trials in HFrEF. However, similar favorable effects were found when captopril, ramipril, and trandolapril were started at least 3 days following MI in the SAVE, AIRE, and TRACE trials, respectively.125,162,163 Additionally, the GISSI-3 trial also showed a mortality benefit with lisinopril after MI regardless of subsequent LV function.164 Taken together, these observations suggest a class effect of ACE inhibitors in the treatment of HFrEF. Thus, ACE inhibitors are strongly recommended to all patients with HFrEF, unless contraindicated or not tolerated. Evidence-based doses for ACE inhibitor are listed in Table 3.5.

Most side effects of ACE inhibitors are primarily related to interfering with the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degradation of bradykinin. Clinical evaluation prior to ACE inhibitor initiation includes assessment of BP, renal function, and electrolytes.<sup>165</sup> It should be emphasized that patients with hypotension or impaired renal function were excluded from most of the clinical trials, and the efficacy of ACE inhibitors for such patients is less well established. Hypotension, early decrease in renal function, and hyperkalemia are dose-dependent side effects that may be avoided by slow dose titration. Symptomatic hypotension and modest reduction in GFR may be initially managed by reducing the dose of diuretics in the absence of significant fluid retention. However, GFR at reduced renal perfusion pressure ultimately depends upon the postglomerular efferent arteriolar vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II. Hence, in subjects with renal-artery stenosis or reduced intravascular volume, RAAS blockade might be capable of reducing filtration pressure at critical levels of kidney perfusion, worsening renal function. Progressive loss of GFR can sometimes recover by withholding ACE inhibitors. An ACE inhibitor therapy should be avoided in nondialysis patients with serum creatinine >3.5 mg/dL or estimated GFR <20 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> , while dialysis patients can be treated with ACE inhibitors. Hyperkalemia can be prevented by prescription of a low-potassium diet, loop diuretics, and prior discontinuation or dose reduction of other medications that raise serum potassium, such as potassium supplements or a potassium-sparing diuretics.<sup>165</sup> A serum potassium level of up to 5.5 mmol/L is acceptable as long as it is stable. In patients with uncontrollable hyperkalemia and an increase of more than 20% to 30% in creatinine level within a week, the ACE inhibitor should be discontinued or down-titrated. Frequent monitoring is advised, although ACE inhibitors may rarely cause severe hyperkalemia that requires emergency management.

Other side effects, as dry cough and angioneurotic edema, are related to the accumulation of bradykinin. Bradykinin is not only a vasodilator, but it also increases prostaglandin concentrations and vascular permeability with fluid extravasation. This clinical distinction is important as side effects related to reduced angiotensin II, but not those related to increased kinins, are also seen with the ARBs. Persistent dry cough, a recognized side effect that occurs in 5% to 20% of subjects on ACE inhibitors, may be dose-related and is not a true allergic effect. When the ACE inhibitor is discontinued, improvement often begins within 4–7 days. Angioneurotic edema is rare (<1%) and resolves without complications in most cases. However, because endotracheal intubation or emergent tracheostomy may be necessary and fatalities have been reported, an ACE inhibitor should not be prescribed for patients with idiopathic or prior angioneurotic edema. The incidence of ACE inhibitor– induced angioneurotic edema is up to five times greater in individuals of African descent. Actually, there is conflicting evidence on the efficacy of ACE inhibitors in people of African descent, which may be genetically explained by a low-renin system.166 However, given the available evidence, ACE inhibitor therapy recommendations are the same for all HFrEF patients, regardless of race. Allergic reactions include skin rash, neutropenia, dysgeusia, or anaphylactoid reactions. Both ACE inhibitors and ARBs can cause fetal abnormalities and are absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy in the second and third trimesters.

#### Angiotensin-converting Enzyme Inhibitors or β-Blockers First

Although the combination of an ACE inhibitor and a β-blocker is more effective in HFrEF than monotherapy with either, the order of initiation is important in clinical practice because patients often cannot tolerate optimum doses of both agents. There are theoretical considerations suggesting it may be more beneficial to initiate the treatment with a β-blocker, as the SNS is systemically activated at an earlier stage than is the RAAS. The CIBIS-III trial addressed this important question and showed that initiating treatment with the selective β1-receptor blocker bisoprolol is as effective and well tolerated as beginning treatment with the ACE inhibitor enalapril.<sup>167</sup>

In clinical practice, drug initiation and up-titration could be tailored to individual patients and their unique clinical circumstances. The initial treatment strategy with β-blockers first may be better for subjects with ischemic cardiomyopathies and tachycardia, while the strategy of using an ACE inhibitor first should be indicated for patients with hypertension and fluid overload. Current clinical practice guidelines recommend starting with an ACE inhibitor, followed by the addition of a β-blocker. In most cases, βblockers are then up-titrated to their maximum recommended dose before further increase in the dose of ACE inhibitors.

### Angiotensin Receptor Blockers

Long-term treatment with ACE inhibitors leads to a gradual return of circulating angiotensin II concentrations through non-ACEdependent pathways.168,169 Any angiotensin II that is produced through such alternative pathways remains available for binding with two types of angiotensin receptors, AT-1 and AT-2. The AT-1 receptors are abundant in the vessels, brain, heart, kidney, adrenal, and nerves, while AT-2 are only available in small amounts in the adult kidney, adrenal, heart, brain, uterus, and ovary. Rather than preventing the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, the ARBs selectively block the binding of angiotensin II to the AT-1 receptors. Activation of AT-1 leads to increased vasoconstriction, aldosterone and catecholamine release, sodium resorption in the proximal tubules of the kidney, and cell growth in the arteries and heart. Thus, antagonizing AT-1 causes a reduction in both cardiac afterload and preload. Also, ARBs may be better tolerated, since they do not interfere with the degradation of bradykinin and do not appear to induce cough and possibly other side effects that force some patients to discontinue treatment with ACE inhibitors.

Given their different mechanisms, earlier rationale postulated that ARB therapy would provide an advantage over ACE inhibitor therapy. However, despite the theoretical benefits, clinical evidence of ARB effectiveness in HFrEF patients is less robust than that of ACE inhibitors.<sup>168</sup> In the Val-HeFT trial, the addition of valsartan to standard HFrEF therapy that included ACE inhibitors did not improve survival but reduced the incidence of the composite outcome of morbidity and mortality, largely through a decrease in HF hospitalizations.<sup>170</sup> Moreover, a retrospective subanalysis of the Val-HeFT suggested that valsartan might also reduce all-cause mortality in the small subgroup of subjects not receiving an ACE inhibitor. The CHARM program consisted of three independent, parallel, placebo-controlled trials evaluating candesartan in different symptomatic HF populations with the same primary composite outcome of CV death or HF hospitalization.<sup>171</sup> HFrEF subjects who received candesartan had significant better outcomes than those who received placebo in both the CHARM-Alternative and CHARM-Added component trials. Specifically, the CHARM-Alternative trial showed that candesartan was well tolerated in symptomatic HFrEF patients who had previously failed an ACE inhibitor, resulting in a 20% relative risk reduction in CV mortality and fewer HF hospitalization.<sup>172</sup> While similar findings were shown in the CHARM-Added trial, the combination of candesartan with an ACE inhibitor and a βblocker resulted in higher rates of adverse outcomes including increased creatinine and hyperkalemia.173 Additionally, a later Cochrane meta-analysis showed that the combination of ARBs and ACE inhibitors increased the risk of withdrawals due to side effects, especially renal dysfunction and hyperkalemia, and did not reduce total mortality or hospitalizations when compared to ACE inhibitors alone.168 It is noteworthy that only 17% of subjects in the CHARM-Added trial were on an MRA, which might be the preferred next agent to add on to the combination of an ACE inhibitor and a β-blocker in patients with HFrEF. Combined use of MRA, ACE inhibitor, and ARB should be avoided because of concerns about hyperkalemia and lack of evidence of efficacy.

Regarding dosing of ARBs, the HEAAL trial showed that highdose losartan was associated with a significant reduction in HF admissions when compared to low-dose losartan.<sup>174</sup> Thus, they should be started at low doses and up-titrated to the maximum recommended and tolerated dose. Evidence-based doses for ARBs are listed in Table 3.5. Long-term therapy with ARBs in patients with HFrEF produces hemodynamic, neurohormonal, and clinical effects consistent with those expected after interference with the RAAS. However, controversial results from different meta-analysis cannot confirm their superiority over placebo, particularly when compared to ACE inhibitors. A direct comparison of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was assessed in the ELITE-II trial, which did not observe any mortality benefit of losartan over captopril in elderly subjects with HFrEF.<sup>177</sup> Furthermore, the VALIANT trial showed that valsartan was noninferior to captopril on all-cause mortality in subjects with post-MI LV dysfunction.<sup>178</sup> Although both classes might have similar effects, the general consensus is that an ARB should only be recommended as an alternative for patients with prior or current symptoms of chronic HFrEF who are intolerant to ACE inhibitors due to cough, skin rash, or angioneurotic edema. It should be stated, however, that other side effects such as hypotension, renal dysfunction, and hyperkalemia appear to be similar for ACE inhibitors and ARBs. Additionally, angioedema has also been reported in some patients taking ARBs, although much less frequently than with ACE inhibitors.

ARBs are also reasonable choices as first-line drugs for HFrEF patients who are already on ARB therapy for other indications, like hypertension, and those who are unable to tolerate an MRA for other reasons than renal dysfunction and hyperkalemia. Both ACE inhibitors and ARBs can cause fetal abnormalities and are absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy in the second and third trimesters.

# Angiotensin Receptor Neprilysin Inhibitors

In the context of normal cardiac physiology, both the RAAS and SNS are balanced by the NP system to maintain BP and fluid homeostasis. The NP system consists of structurally similar peptides, such as the atrial, B-type, and C-type NPs, that act through receptor-based generation of cGMP, enhancing diuresis, natriuresis, and vasodilation while countering SNS and RAAS overstimulation.<sup>131</sup> As HFrEF progresses, the effects of the NP system become attenuated by several mechanisms, including reduced availability of active forms of NPs, diminished organ responsiveness, and overactivation of counter-regulatory neurohormones. Therefore, pharmacological approaches to enhance the functional effectiveness of the NP system in chronic HFrEF have been proposed.<sup>179</sup>

Initial efforts focused on the IV administration of synthetic forms of NPs, such as nesiritide and ularitide, in the setting of ADHF, but did not improve clinical outcomes.62,67 Similar disappointing findings were seen with the lone inhibition of neprilysin (NEP), a neutral endopeptidase responsible for the breakdown of several vasodilator peptides, such as NPs, bradykinin, and adrenomedullin, as well as vasoconstrictors peptides, as angiotensin and endothelin-1.179,180 By blocking regulators of opposite actions of vasodilation and vasoconstriction, lone NEP inhibition essentially neutralize each effect and further increase RAAS activation stimulated by upregulation of angiotensin II. Later studies tested omapatrilat, a compound that inhibited both ACE and NEP, to further inhibit angiotensin II in addition to NEP. The OVERTURE trial found that the use of omapatrilat in HFrEF patients was not superior to enalapril alone in reducing mortality and hospitalization but was associated with a higher incidence of angioedema (2.17% versus 0.68%).<sup>181</sup> The increased incidence of this life-threatening complication was attributed to the synergism between the ACE and NEP inhibition on the breakdown of bradykinin. In addition, omapatrilat also inhibits a third enzyme involved in the degradation of bradykinin, the aminopeptidase P. Further clinical research on the entire class of ACE-NEP inhibitors were halted.

The strategy that ultimately proved successful in improving HFrEF outcomes was the molecular combination of sacubitril, a NEP inhibitor, with valsartan, an ARB, resulting in the first-in-class ARNI sacubitril–valsartan. The PARADIGM-HF trial showed a highly significant 20% relative risk reduction in the primary composite outcome of CV death or HF hospitalization of sacubitril–valsartan over enalapril in subjects with NYHA class II–IV HFrEF.<sup>182</sup> Sacubitril–valsartan also reduced secondary outcomes of CV death by 20%, first hospitalization for worsening HF by 21%, all-cause mortality by 16%, and prevented deterioration of symptoms and quality of life.

Since all participants of the PARADIGM-HF were required to first tolerate a run-in phase of enalapril, most HFrEF guidelineissuing societies suggested that sacubitril–valsartan should be initiated only in subjects tolerating full-dose ACE inhibitor or ARB. However, given the positive results of the subsequent PIONEER-HF trial, it is now considered a reasonable strategy to initiate sacubitril–valsartan as a first-line component of the long-term RAAS blockade in hemodynamically stable patients with ADHF.<sup>71</sup> To facilitate initiation and titration, the approved ARNI is available in three doses, including a lower one that was not tested in the PARADIGM-HF trial (Table 3.5).

In the PARADIGM-HF trial, symptomatic hypotension was more common in patients receiving sacubitril–valsartan, although there was no increase in the rate of discontinuation. Measures to avoid hypotension include adjusting the dose of diuretics or other concomitant antihypertensive drugs, correcting volume depletion prior to starting sacubitril–valsartan, and starting at a lower dose. Hyperkalemia and renal dysfunction were reported as adverse events in both treatment groups in PARADIGM-HF, although clinically important increases in serum creatinine were less frequent in the sacubitril–valsartan than in the enalapril group. In addition, among MRA-treated patients, severe hyperkalemia was also more likely with enalapril.<sup>183</sup> Nonetheless, the same precautions for renal impairment and hyperkalemia should be applied to all subjects receiving RAAS inhibitors, including careful screening of baseline renal function and serum potassium concentration, followed by close periodic monitoring. Recruiting only subjects who tolerated both enalapril and sacubitril–valsartan during the active run-in phase reduced the risk of angioneurotic edema in the PARADIGM-HF. However, because of the previous experience with Omapatrilat, a 36-hour washout period when switching from an ACE inhibitor to sacubitril–valsartan is advised. Combined treatment with sacubitril–valsartan and an ACE inhibitor, or a lone ARB, is contraindicated. If none of these three agents is tolerated, the combination of H-ISDN is a potential alternative therapy for patients with HFrEF. Sacubitril–valsartan is also contraindicated during pregnancy due to concerns about risk of teratogenicity with ARBs.

There are also additional concerns about the effects of NEP inhibition on the degradation of β-amyloid peptide in the brain, which could theoretically accelerate amyloid deposition, leading to impaired cognitive function. A subanalysis found no increase in dementia-related adverse events in PARADIGM-HF, but long-term follow-up may be necessary to detect such a signal.<sup>184</sup>

# Mineralocorticoid-Receptor Antagonists

Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid hormone produced primarily by the adrenal cortex but also by endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells in the blood vessels and myocardium in response to angiotensin II, hyperkalemia, and corticotropin.<sup>185</sup> In addition to its classic mineralocorticoid properties, which can lead to hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, aldosterone has other adverse effects that can contribute to the pathophysiology of HF, such as inflammation, vascular stiffening, collagen formation, and myocardial necrosis.<sup>186</sup> Therefore, chronically elevated aldosterone is associated with coronary and renovascular remodeling, endothelial and baroreceptor dysfunction, myocardial hypertrophy, and reduced HR variability.

Since angiotensin II prevents renin release by negative feedback, a large increase in plasma renin activity occurs with the administration of ACE inhibitors and ARBs. Moreover, plasma aldosterone returns to pretreatment levels after several weeks of therapy in up to 30% to 40% of patients, either through non-ACE-dependent pathways, or high serum potassium concentrations.157,169 MRAs, often referred to as aldosterone antagonists, block receptors that bind aldosterone and, with different degrees of affinity, other steroid hormone receptors such as corticosteroids and androgens. It has been shown that MRAs provide a more complete inhibition of the RAAS when added to standard HFrEF therapy, preventing many of the maladaptive effects of aldosterone.185-187 Most of their benefits are mediated by antifibrotic mechanisms, which slows or reverse cardiac remodeling and reduce arrhythmogenesis. In addition, MRAs also preserve serum potassium levels, countering the risk of hypokalemia and further associated arrhythmic risk induced by other diuretics, such as loop diuretics.

The combination of an MRA with standard HFrEF regimen improves survival and reduces morbidity in patients with symptomatic chronic HFrEF, as well as those with LV systolic dysfunction after MI. Such major clinical benefits have been demonstrated in a few well-conducted randomized clinical trials. The first evidence was demonstrated by the RALES trial, which tested spironolactone versus placebo in subjects with NYHA class III–IV HFrEF receiving a background of loop diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and, in most cases, digoxin.<sup>188</sup> RALES demonstrated a 30% relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality with spironolactone, without a significant increase in the risk of serious hyperkalemia or renal failure as hypothesized. HF hospitalization was also 35% lower in the MRA group.

However, although generally well tolerated in RALES, spironolactone was associated with dose-dependent reports of gynecomastia or breast tenderness in 10% of men, compared with 1% in the placebo group. Gynecomastia is clinically defined as benign enlargement of the glandular tissue of male breast due to periductal fibrosis, stromal hyalinization, and increased subareolar fat, while breast pain is caused by inflammatory infiltration of the periductal tissue.<sup>189</sup> Its pathophysiological process usually involves an imbalance between free estrogen and free androgen actions in the breast tissue. Spironolactone induces gynecomastia by decreasing testosterone production in the testicles, increasing its peripheral conversion to estradiol and displacing more estrogen from sex hormonebinding globulin, increasing the bioavailability of estrogen to a greater extent than androgen.187,189 Other distressing endocrine side effects of spironolactone include menstrual irregularities in premenopausal females and impotence and decreased libido in men.

Shortly after publication of the RALES trial, the MRA eplerenone became available for clinical evaluation. It was postulated that due to its greater specificity for the mineralocorticoid receptor, eplerenone would have fewer antiandrogenic effects than spironolactone, as a greater fraction of free testosterone could tightly bind to sex hormone-binding globulin. This prompted the subsequent EPHESUS trial, which investigated eplerenone in the treatment of LV systolic dysfunction and clinical evidence of HF or diabetes after an MI, as well as the EMPHASIS-HF trial, investigating eplerenone in the treatment of NYHA class II HFrEF.190,191 Both were positive trials, reinforcing the benefits of MRAs in improving survival and hospitalizations in patients with HFrEF, but with fewer endocrine side effects in comparison to spironolactone. Importantly, both trials were performed in the era of widespread β-blocker use, in contrast to RALES in which only 10% subjects were on β-blocker therapy. In EPHESUS, particularly, eplerenone was beneficial on top of all of the existing therapies for MI at that time, including aspirin, reperfusion, and statin. Prior to EMPHASIS-HF, no clinical trial had evaluated the benefits of aldosterone blockade in HFrEF subjects with mild symptoms, as RALES and EPHESUS randomized a population with higher NYHA classes. Therefore, an MRA is recommended for all patients with HFrEF who remain symptomatic despite treatment with an ACE inhibitor (or ARB or ARNI) and a β-blocker, to reduce the risk of HF hospitalization and death, unless contraindicated. Evidence-based doses for spironolactone and eplerenone are listed in Table 3.5.

The major side effect of MRAs is the development of lifethreatening hyperkalemia. Caution should be taken in patients with serum potassium concentrations >5.0 mmol/L or serum creatinine >2.5 mg/dL. In RALES, EPHESUS, and EMPHASIS-HF, hyperkalemia was more common in the active treatment groups, although serum potassium concentration 6 mmol/L was rare. The risks of severe hyperkalemia can be mitigated through appropriate patient selection and education, dose adjustments, careful monitoring of serum potassium levels and renal function, and closer follow-up. The development of worsening renal function should prompt therapy discontinuation.

Although eplerenone is associated with fewer endocrine adverse effects, spironolactone is the most widely prescribed MRA, presumably because of its lower cost. Generally, discontinuation of spironolactone results in resolution of such effects. Thus, it may be reasonable to start MRA therapy with spironolactone, and eventually switch to eplerenone case endocrine side effects occurs. Novel, nonsteroidal MRAs, such as the finerenone, combine the potency of spironolactone with the selectivity of eplerenone, resulting in less hyperkalemia and greater decrease in BNP and NTproBNP levels.187 Exploratory analysis of the phase 2 ARTS-HF trial suggested a more favorable effect of finerenone on CV mortality and HF hospitalizations when compared to eplerenone.<sup>192</sup> The relative effectiveness of finerenone over eplerenone remains to be determined in a large outcomes trial.

# Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors

The SGLT-2 inhibitors, also called "gliflozins," are a class of medications that reduce glucose reabsorption by inhibiting the high-capacity sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 in the proximal tubule of the nephron. This leads to an increased concentration of chloride in the distal tubule and a resetting of the tubulo-glomerular feedback mechanism, which results in a contraction of the plasma volume without activation of the SNS. Empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin have been shown to reduce the risk of HF hospitalization in three large clinical trials in T2DM patients at high cardiovascular risk: the EMPA-REG Outcomes, the CANVAS Program, and the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial.118-120 The DAPA-HF trial was the first outcomes trial with an SGLT-2 inhibitor investigating the treatment of HFREF irrespective of T2DM status.<sup>193</sup> The DAPA-HF trial randomized subjects with NYHA class II–IV HFrEF to dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo, in addition to standard care, and showed a statistically significant 26% reduction in the risk of the primary composite outcome of worsening HF or CV death. When analyzed separately, worsening HF was reduced by 30% and the risk of CV death was reduced by 18%. Notably, the treatment effect was consistent across all prespecified subgroups, including patients without baseline T2DM and regardless of hemoglobulin A1c levels. In addition, dapagliflozin reduced the risk for all-cause death by 17% and showed a significant improvement in patient-reported HF symptoms. Adverse events related to volume depletion, renal adverse events, major hypoglycemia, lower limb amputation, and fracture were comparable to placebo, with low rates of discontinuation in both groups (<5%). The potential mechanisms of benefit from gliflozins in HFrEF are likely multifactorial, involving not only glycosuria or osmotic diuresis but also cardio-renal protection through metabolic and hemodynamic effects.

#### Additional Therapy

#### Diuretics

Diuretics are the cornerstone of therapy for the treatment of volume overload in patients with HF, relieving clinical symptoms and signs more rapidly than any other drug.194 They can reduce CVP, pulmonary congestion, peripheral edema, and body weight within hours or days of initiation of therapy, whereas the clinical effects of digoxin, ACE inhibitors, or β-blockers may require weeks or months to become apparent. Additionally, in the intermediate term, diuretics have also been shown to improve cardiac function and exercise tolerance in HF patients.<sup>33</sup> However, the effects of diuretic therapy with long-term follow-up in chronic HFrEF have not been studied in large prospective randomized controlled trials. A Cochrane meta-analysis suggested that in patients with chronic HF, conventional diuretic therapy might reduce the risk of death and worsening of HF compared to placebo and appear to improve exercise capacity compared to active control.<sup>194</sup> However, this meta-analysis included only small-size studies with limited followup and cannot be used as formal evidence to recommend the use of diuretics to reduce HF mortality.

Patients at higher risk for fluid overload would benefit from long-term therapy with oral loop diuretics. However, the use of loop diuretics might associate with electrolyte disturbances, arrhythmias, neurohormonal activation, accelerated renal function decline, and hypotension.<sup>33</sup> The latter might be particularly relevant, as it could limit optimal target doses of neurohormonal antagonists. Therefore, it is advised to use the lowest possible dose of loop diuretic, which should be adjusted individually. As previously stated, diuretics do not have a smooth dose-response curve, and natriuresis will only occur when the threshold rate of drug excretion, which is often higher in HF patients, is attained.<sup>30</sup> Hence, if there is little or no response to the initial dose, it is recommended to double it rather than giving the same dose twice a day. Additionally, for patients presenting with an ADHF episode while previously taking a loop diuretic, a higher dose at discharge should be considered.

Thiazide diuretics are widely used for the management of hypertension. Despite structural variation among the heterogeneous group of agents with similar physiological properties, including the thiazide-like diuretics, the term "thiazide diuretic" comprises all diuretics believed to have a primary action in the distal convoluted tubule. Metolazone, a quinazoline sulfonamide, is a thiazide-like diuretic that can be used in combination with furosemide in patients with diuretic resistance. The chronic use of sequential nephron blockade with thiazide diuretics should be avoided in stable patients, as it often induces electrolyte disorders that could go unseen in the ambulatory setting.30,32

Since sodium retention occurs in more proximal tubular sites, potassium-sparing diuretics are ineffective in achieving a net negative sodium balance when given alone in HF patients. Besides, the benefit of MRAs in patients with HF is thought to be relatively independent of their diuretic properties and may be due to their ability to antagonize the RAAS.

Vasopressin receptor antagonists modulate the renal actions of AVP by directly blocking its receptors V1A, V1B, and V2.<sup>195</sup> The inappropriate elevation of AVP in HF plays a key role in mediating vasoconstriction, water retention, and electrolyte imbalance. Combined V1A and V2 antagonism causes a decrease in SVR and prevents dilutional hyponatremia. The AVP antagonists, or "vaptans," can either selectively block the V2-receptor or nonselectively block both the V1A- and the V2-receptors. The EVEREST-Outcomes trial randomized subjects admitted with ADHF to the selective V2 receptor antagonist tolvaptan or placebo and showed no difference in long-term mortality or HF-related morbidity at a median followup of 9.9 months.<sup>195</sup> Currently, conivaptan and tolvaptan are FDA-approved for the treatment of clinically significant hypervolemic and euvolemic hyponatremia, but they are not officially approved for HF. Although it is reasonable to use these agents after traditional measures to hyponatremia have failed, including fluid restriction and optimal target doses of angiotensin inhibitors, their widespread use might be limited by high costs.

Patients receiving diuretics should be monitored regularly for complications, including electrolyte and metabolic disturbances, volume depletion, and worsening renal function. Even when successful in controlling symptoms and fluid retention, diuretics alone are unable to maintain the clinical stability of patients with chronic HF for long periods of time. Therefore, they should be combined with standard guideline recommended HFrEF therapies, including neurohormonal antagonists.

# Combination of Hydralazine Plus Isosorbide Dinitrate

Until the 1970s, standard medical therapy for HF was limited to digitalis and diuretics. A hemodynamic rationale for the combined use of a venous and arterial vasodilator therapy is to reduce both preload and afterload by improving venous capacitance while decreasing SVR.196 Early pivotal studies found that the combination of two oral vasodilators, hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate, in patients with NYHA class III–IV HF results in a better hemodynamic response than either drug individually.<sup>197</sup> Additionally, since nitrates are NO donors and hydralazine has antioxidant properties, it is possible that the NO-mediated effects of H-ISDN might also play a complex role in the maintenance of CV health.

The V-HeFT trial was the first major randomized, placebocontrolled HF study, which compared H-ISDN, prazosin, or placebo in subjects with symptomatic HF and LVEF <45%.<sup>158</sup> At a mean follow-up of 2.3 years, there was no statistically significant difference in mortality between the groups, although H-ISDN was associated with a trend toward improved survival when compared to placebo. H-ISDN also improved LVEF at 8 weeks and 1 year, while prazosin was associated neither with mortality nor LVEF improvement. The subsequent V-HeFT II trial was undertaken to compare H-ISDN with enalapril in a similar population to that of V-HeFT and showed a survival benefit with enalapril at the primary specified time point of 2 years but not during the entire follow-up of the trial.<sup>161</sup> The survival benefit was largely driven by a reduction in sudden cardiac death, but there were no significant differences in rates of hospitalizations between the two groups.

Of interest, post hoc subgroup analysis from both V-HeFT and V-HeFT II trials suggested improved survival benefit with H-ISDN among self-identified black subjects, which was the basis of the A-HeFT trial. Based on the rationale that persons of African descent may have less RAAS activity, rendering ACE inhibitors less effective, the A-HeFT trial randomized self-identified black subjects with NYHA class III–IV HFrEF to either placebo or a fixed combination of H-ISDN.<sup>198</sup> The trial was stopped early at a mean follow-up of 10 months due to a significant 43% relative risk reduction in allcause mortality associated with the use of H-ISDN added to standard therapy with diuretics, ACE inhibitors, β-blockers, digoxin, and spironolactone. H-ISDN was also associated with a lower rate of first and recurrent HF hospitalizations and a significant improvement in quality-of-life assessments. Importantly, the A-HeFT trial tested a fixed-combination single-pill equivalent to the generic H-ISDN, called BiDil, but it is probable that the same benefits can be achieved with a combination of the separate formulations. BiDil has provoked controversy as the first FDA-approved drug marketed for a single racial-ethnic group—those of African descent—in the treatment of HFrEF.

Guideline-issuing professional societies recommend the combination of H-ISDN for self-identified black patients with NYHA class III–IV HFrEF who remain symptomatic despite concomitant use of ACE inhibitors, β-blockers, and MRAs. The results of the A-HeFT trial are difficult to translate to other racial or ethnic origins, and there is less robust evidence supporting the use of H-ISDN as a contemporary first-line therapy for nonblack HFrEF subjects. Nonetheless, based on the V-HeFT trial, which recruited patients who received only digoxin and diuretics, H-ISDN may be considered in symptomatic HFrEF patients who cannot be given an ACE inhibitor, ARB, or ARNI because of drug intolerance, hypotension, or renal dysfunction. Evidence-based doses for H-ISDN are listed in Table 3.5. Concomitant use of any form of nitrate with PDE-5 inhibitors or sGC stimulators is contraindicated due to the increased risk of refractory hypotension.

# If Channel Inhibitor

An elevated HR in patients with HFrEF reflects, in part, an imbalance between sympathetic overstimulation and parasympathetic suppression, which are components of the neurohumoral activation. It has been shown that increased HR not only predicts CV death and HF hospitalization but may also be a therapeutic target in patients with chronic HFrEF.<sup>199</sup> Several classes of pharmacological agents can modulate HR, including β-blockers, ivabradine, digoxin, amiodarone, and nondihydropyridine CCBs, such as diltiazem and verapamil. While some agents are associated with clinical benefits in patients with HFrEF, such as β-blockers and ivabradine, others provide no direct benefit and should generally be avoided, such as most CCBs. Choice will depend on heart rhythm, comorbidities, and disease phenotype. <sup>200</sup>

Although the conventional definition of tachycardia is a resting HR over 100 beats/min, the risk of adverse CV outcomes in HFrEF patients appears to increase progressively with HR  $\geq 70$  beats/min.  $^{201\text{-}203}$   $\beta$ -Blockers reduce HR by antagonizing the adverse effects of the SNS and have become a cornerstone for HFrEF therapy. In some cases, however, recommended target doses cannot be tolerated or are contraindicated, and other drugs should be considered for adequate HR control. Ivabradine is a selective blocker of the cardiac pacemaker If ("funny") channel current that controls the spontaneous diastolic depolarization of the sinoatrial node, approved for the treatment of HFrEF in the United States. Specific blockade of the If channels prolongates the slow depolarization phase, causing a dose-dependent reduction in HR. As a consequence, ivabradine does not affect contractility or SVR.

Initially developed and approved as an antianginal agent in Europe, ivabradine was also shown to improve outcomes in subjects with HFrEF. The BEAUTIFUL trial randomized subjects with IHD to ivabradine or placebo and did not meet its primary outcome of reducing CV death, MI, or HF hospitalization. 201 However, in a post hoc analysis, ivabradine was shown to reduce rates of MI and coronary revascularization in the subgroup with a HR >70 beats/min, yielding insights into the potential benefits of additional HR reduction in patients with HFrEF. <sup>202</sup> The SHIFT trial randomized symptomatic HFrEF patients with LVEF <35%, sinus rhythm, and resting HR ≥70 beats/min despite maximally tolerated βblocker therapy to either ivabradine or matching placebo. 204 The primary composite outcome of HF hospitalization or mortality was reduced by 18% in the ivabradine group, driven primarily by 26% fewer HF hospitalizations, since there was no decrease in CV or all-cause deaths. Remarkably, only 26% of subjects in SHIFT were taking optimal target doses of β-blockers and only 56% were on at least half-target doses at inclusion. Given that ivabradine lowered HR by approximately 10 beats/min, and that its benefits were somewhat attenuated in the subgroup of subjects on at least halftarget doses of  $\beta$ -blocker therapy, it is possible that titrating  $\beta$ blockers to recommended doses may have reduced HF hospitalizations to a similar degree.

Overall, ivabradine was well tolerated in the SHIFT trial, with only a modest increase in bradycardia. Transient visual disturbances secondary to effects on the hyperpolarization-activated current within the retina, referred to as phosphenes, were the most common non-CV side effect, but they frequently improved over time. Current HF guidelines recommend considering ivabradine in HFrEF patients with LVEF  $\leq$ 35%, sinus rhythm, and resting HR

70 beats/min who remain symptomatic despite β-blocker therapy at maximum tolerated dose. It should be noted that the off-label use of ivabradine for inappropriate sinus tachycardia or other electrophysiological disorders lacks evidence support and remains unapproved.<sup>200</sup> Evidence-based doses for ivabradine are listed in Table 3.5.

Ivabradine is contraindicated in patients with ADHF, hypotension, sinus node dysfunction, sinus bradycardia with a HR <60 beats/min, and sinoatrial (SA) or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, unless a functioning demand pacemaker is present. Other contraindications for ivabradine are severe hepatic dysfunction, pacemaker dependence, and known atrial or ventricular arrhythmias. In the SIGNIFY trial, subjects with CAD treated with ivabradine had an increase in relative risk for AF, which is consistent with the findings of a later meta-analysis.205,206 Ivabradine also has the potential to cause fetal toxicity, and women of reproductive age should therefore be advised.

#### Digoxin

Digoxin is a purified cardiac glycoside derived from the foxglove plant that has been used for more than 200 years to treat HF. It acts by inhibiting the sodium–potassium (Na-K) ATPase pump in cell membranes, reducing the transport of sodium from the intracellular to the extracellular space in both cardiac and noncardiac cells and contributing to hemodynamic, neurohumoral, and electrophysiologic effects (Fig. 3.7).<sup>207</sup>

In myocytes, inhibition of the Na-K-ATPase pump is associated with a rise in intracellular calcium concentration, which is the pivotal link in excitation-contraction coupling, causing positive inotropy. This results in improved LVEF, CO, and PCWP without causing detrimental effects on HR or BP.<sup>208</sup> In noncardiac cells, digoxin sensitizes Na-K-ATPase activity in vagal afferent nerves, leading to an increase in parasympathetic tone that offsets the deleterious activation of the SNS. In addition to its direct autonomic effects, digoxin indirectly reduces sympathetic outflow by improving carotid baroreflex responsiveness. Thus, at low doses, digoxin acts as a neurohormonal modulator in patients with severe HFrEF. Further dose increases, however, have no additional benefit and may augment sympathetic tone.<sup>209</sup> Also, by increasing vagal tone and decreasing sympathetic outflow, digoxin slows firing at the SA node and prolongs conduction at the AV node, with limited electrophysiological effects on the rest of the conduction system.<sup>207</sup>

Despite its beneficial properties and widespread use in the past, the role of digoxin therapy in patients with chronic HFrEF

# INOTROPIC, VAGAL AND SYMPATHETIC EFFECTS OF DIGOXIN

![](_page_53_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 3.7 Digoxin has hemodynamic, neurohumoral, and electrophysiologic effects.** The inotropic effect of digoxin is due to inhibition of the sodium pump in myocardial cells. Slowing of the heart rate and inhibition of the atrioventricular (AV) node by vagal stimulation and the decreased sympathetic nerve discharge are important therapeutic benefits. Toxic arrhythmias are less well understood but may be caused by calcium-dependent afterpotentials. *CHF*, Congestive heart failure; *E*, epinephrine; *NE*, norepinephrine; *RAS*, renin-angiotensin system; *SA*, sinoatrial. (Figure © L.H. Opie, 2012.)

remains controversial. Before the pivotal DIG trial, two digoxin-withdrawal trials from the early 1990s, the PROVED and the RADI-ANCE, examined the effects of stopping digoxin therapy in subjects with NYHA class II–III HFrEF and normal sinus rhythm. <sup>210-212</sup> Both trials showed that withdrawing digoxin in these subjects significantly worsened HF symptoms and lowered exercise tolerance, with no effects on mortality. In the DIG trial, the largest randomized clinical trial of digoxin efficacy in HF, digoxin therapy reduced hospitalizations by 28% but had no statistically significant effect

on all-cause mortality.<sup>210</sup> Also, a trend toward survival benefit found in patients with severe HFrEF was offset by an increased risk of sudden and other nonpump-failure cardiac deaths. Of note, most subjects in the DIG were receiving standard therapy with ACE inhibitors and diuretics, while β-blocker therapy was not yet approved for use in HF. Reanalysis of the DIG trial have brought into question the safety of digoxin, including the optimal serum digoxin concentration (SDC) and the role of gender in digoxin therapy. A post hoc analysis of the DIG suggested that the SDC was directly related to mortality, with increased all-cause mortality among subjects with SDC 1.2 ng/mL. By contrast, concentrations between 0.5 and 0.8 ng/mL were safe.<sup>213</sup> In another retrospective analysis of the DIG trial, digoxin was associated with a significantly higher risk of death from any cause among women, suggesting a significant treatment-gender interaction.<sup>214</sup> However, further post hoc analyses focusing on subjects with available SDC showed that women with SDC in the lower range of 0.5–0.9 ng/ml had mortality rates similar to those obtained with placebo and a significant 30% relative risk reduction in HF hospitalizations.<sup>215</sup> Conversely, an increased mortality was observed among women with SDC 1.2 ng/mL, which is a similar trend to that observed in the general population. Those findings are consistent with a recent post hoc analysis of the ARISTOTLE trial, which examined the association between mortality and digoxin use in subjects with nonvalvular AFib.<sup>216</sup> The retrospective study found that subjects with baseline SDC at 1.2 ng/mL or above had over 50% increased risk of death when compared to those not on digoxin, while subjects with SDC below 0.9 ng/mL showed no increased risk. In addition, patients starting digoxin in the follow-up also had significantly higher mortality risks.

Taken together, the DIG, the PROVED, and the RADIANCE trials prompted the FDA to approve digoxin for use in HFrEF in 1997. However, due to its side effects and a narrow toxic-to-therapeutic window, major clinical practice guidelines currently offer only a secondary recommendation for HFrEF patients with normal sinus rhythm who remain symptomatic despite optimal medical therapy. Evidence-based doses for digoxin are listed in Table 3.5. Importantly, digoxin therapy for patients with chronic kidney dysfunction or those with low lean body mass should be introduced at lower doses or every other day.

Digoxin toxicity typically presents with the combination of cardiac effects and dose-dependent central nervous system or gastrointestinal effects, such as visual changes, anxiety, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. While elevated intracellular calcium concentration and increased vagal tone facilitate the development of arrhythmias, digoxin should have minimal proarrhythmic effects when dosed to recommended SDC. However, intoxication through supratherapeutic or therapeutic SDC with concomitant hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypercalcemia, hypothyroidism, or myocardial ischemia can cause sinus bradycardia, SA nodal block, AV block, and escape rhythms. SDC could also be increased by associated use of quinidine, verapamil, flecainide, propafenone, amiodarone, and spironolactone. Consequently, SDC should be closely monitored to minimize side effects.

# Iron Supplementation and Anemia

Anemia is a frequent finding in HF patients, with a prevalence ranging from 4% to 55% depending on the population studied.<sup>217</sup> Potential mechanisms of interaction between anemia and HF include inflammation, hemodilution, malnutrition, and renal dysfunction. Acute isovolemic drop of hemoglobin concentration in healthy individuals leads to compensatory changes, including increases in HR, SV, and CI along with tissue oxygen extraction, which are often impaired in patients with reduced CO. Therefore, anemia is associated with worse symptoms and NYHA functional status, greater risk of HF hospitalization, and reduced survival in patients with HFrEF. However, it remains unclear whether anemia is an independent predictor of mortality or simply a marker of more advanced disease and extensive comorbidities.

A standard diagnostic workup should include complete blood count, renal function, occult blood loss, iron and vitamin B12/folate deficiencies, and C-reactive protein. Correctable causes of anemia should be treated according to clinical practice guidelines, but in many cases no specific cause is found. Iron deficiency is very common in HFrEF patients, with an estimated prevalence of over 50% in the ambulatory setting.<sup>218</sup> It is an independent predictor of worse functional status and survival, regardless of anemia. Some studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety of iron supplementation in subjects with HFrEF and iron deficiency, defined as ferritin <100 ng/dl or ferritin of 100–299 ng/dl with transferrin saturation <20%, with mild or no anemia. Early small-size clinical trials and a number of observational studies have provided promising evidence of symptomatic benefit from treating HF with iron, yielding placebo-controlled multicenter trials of IV iron in subjects with chronic HFrEF. The FAIR-HF trial randomized subjects with NYHA class II–III HF and LVEF 40%–45% to IV ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) or placebo at regular intervals during correction and maintenance phases. After 24 weeks of follow-up, FCM supplementation resulted in significant improvements in NYHA class, 6-minute walk distance, and several quality-of-life assessments when compared to placebo.<sup>219</sup> Of note, these benefits were similar in patients with hemoglobin concentration ≤12 or >12 g/dL, suggesting that an alternate mechanism, rather than anemia, could be associated with the observed outcomes. The second large-scale trial of IV FCM in HFrEF, the CONFIRM-HF trial, showed very similar results to those of the FAIR-HF, with sustained benefits over a 1-year period. <sup>220</sup> The following EFFECT-HF trial further suggested that FCM could improve peak oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>) by ergospirometry at 24 weeks.<sup>221</sup> None of the trials, however, were powered to test for the impact of IV iron on mortality and HF hospitalizations or to evaluate separately its consequences in anemic and nonanemic individuals. In two separate meta-analyses, IV iron supplementation in HFrEF subjects with iron deficiency suggested a reduced composite risk of all-cause mortality and CV hospitalization.<sup>218</sup> The FAIR-HF 2 trial is currently ongoing and aims at examining efficacy of IV iron in reducing CV mortality and recurrent hospitalizations in HF patients.

Oral iron preparations are poorly absorbed due to bowel edema. The IRONOUT-HF trial randomized subjects with NYHA II–IV class HF and LVEF  $\leq$ 40% to oral iron polysaccharide or placebo and showed no significant differences between the treatment groups in VO<sub>2</sub> at 16 weeks. <sup>222</sup> Likewise, there was no significant change for the secondary outcomes of 6-minute walk distance and NT-proBNP levels. Furthermore, oral iron preparations are associated with a higher incidence of gastrointestinal side effects, mostly as a result of direct iron effects on the gut wall. Thus, clinical practice guidelines recommend that iron supplementation with IV, but not oral, preparations might be reasonable in subjects with NYHA class II–III HF and iron deficiency, defined as ferritin <100 ng/dl or ferritin of 100–299 ng/dl with transferrin saturation <20%, to improve functional status and quality of life.

Data on use of blood transfusions in patients with HF are limited. Based upon low-quality evidence and expert opinion, a transfusion threshold for maintaining the hemoglobin above 7 g/dL has been generally accepted, although some symptomatic patients may require transfusion at higher levels. <sup>223</sup> Given the risks of volume overload and the costs of red blood cell transfusion, careful selection of patients is recommended, with adjustment of diuretics doses and transfusion rates as needed. Importantly, the sensitizing effects of transfusion may also affect end-stage HF patients, further limiting their access to heart transplantation. Thus, the routine use of blood transfusion cannot be recommended for treating the anemia that occurs in stable HF patients.

Finally, the best evidence of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in subjects with HF comes from the RED-HF trial, which randomized HFrEF patients with mild to moderate anemia to receive either darbepoetin alfa or placebo. Darbepoetin alfa did not improve

clinical outcomes when compared to placebo but led to an excess of thromboembolic events and is therefore not recommended.<sup>224</sup>

# Fish Oil and Marine Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids

Several epidemiological and experimental studies have suggested controversial benefits of dietary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on CV health. The three most important omega-3 PUFAs for humans are the α-linolenic acid (ALA), the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). α-Linolenic acid is an essential fatty acid, mainly obtained from nuts, vegetable oils, flax seeds, and leafy vegetables ingestion, while EPA and DHA can be either synthesized from ALA or obtained from seafood or fish oil supplements.225 Omega-3 fats are critical in cellular function, influencing cellular structure, signaling, and gene expression. PUFA consumption lowers serum triglyceride concentrations and modestly raises HDL cholesterol. Moreover, various pleotropic effects have been described to be associated with PUFA consumption, including reduction of HR and BP as well as antiinflammatory, antithrombotic, antiarrhythmic, and vasodilatory properties.225,226

Supplementation with PUFAs has been of potential interest as a therapy for HF. The GISSI-HF trial randomized subjects with NYHA class II–IV chronic HFrEF to receive 1 g/day of PUFA or matching placebo. At a mean follow-up of 3.9 years, 1 g/day of PUFA was associated with a significant 9% relative risk reduction in mortality from any cause in all of the predefined subgroups, including patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy.227 The primary composite outcome of mortality or CV admissions was also reduced. Although the improvements in clinical outcomes were modest, they were additive to those of other therapies that are standard of care in HF, such as ACE inhibitors, β-blockers, MRAs, and diuretics.

While regular dietary seafood consumption can be considered the optimal source of PUFA for many patients, the dose-response for potential HFrEF benefits is not well established. In the GISSI-HF, for example, only preparations containing 850–882 mg of EPA and DHA as ethyl esters at the average ratio of 1:1.2 have shown an effect on the cumulative outcome of death and hospitalization. EPA and DHA have differing effects on lipid oxidation, signal transduction, fluidity, and cholesterol domain formation, potentially due in part to distinct membrane interactions.<sup>228</sup> Therefore, it is unclear if different preparations would have yielded the same results. The CV benefit of lowering triglyceride levels with pure EPA-only preparations is supported by two large clinical trials, the JELIS and the REDUCE-IT.229,230 By contrast, many supplements actually contain only the omega-3 ALA, which may also have CV benefits but cannot yet be considered a replacement for marine omega-3 PUFAs.

PUFA therapy is generally safe and well tolerated, with the most common side effects being gastrointestinal abnormalities, such as nausea. In the GISSI-HF trial, there was a similar 30% dropout rate from both PUFA and placebo groups. The REDUCE-IT found a significant increase in the rates of AFib and peripheral edema in the EPA group, but with no difference in the rates of new HF or HF hospitalization. Thus, current HF guidelines recommend omega-3 PUFA supplementation as a reasonable adjunctive therapy in patients with NYHA class II–IV HFrEF, preferably in preparations containing >850 mg/g of EPA and DHA.

# Micronutrient Supplementation

Dietary micronutrient deficiency is common in patients with HFrEF. Deficiencies of L-carnitine, thiamine, and taurine alone are wellknown causes of cardiomyopathy.231,232 Micronutrient supplementation offers the opportunity to correct deficiencies in critical myocyte pathways, including those associated with the provision of ATP, intracellular calcium balance, and reduction of oxidative stress. Although some clinical trials of single micronutrient supplementation, including coenzyme Q10, L-carnitine, thiamine, and taurine, have yielded promising results, their value has been limited by design and inconsistency.232,233 Because of the inconclusive data, current HF guidelines do not recommend the routine use of nutritional supplements in patients with current or prior HF symptoms. Larger trials of multiple-micronutrient supplementation are needed.

# Oral Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Therapy

HF is considered a major risk factor for thromboembolic events, which is best explained by the elements of the Virchow's triad, hypercoagulability, blood stasis, and endothelial dysfunction. In large clinical HFrEF trials, the rate of thromboembolic events ranged from 1.5% to 2.7% per year. The major thrombotic sources in HF are related to venous thromboembolism (VTE) and AFib. The VTE risk is associated with RV dysfunction, which may reflect previous, often undiagnosed episodes of pulmonary embolism.<sup>234</sup> Likewise, HF is an important risk factor for stroke embolization among patients with AF, as accessed by a variety of risk scores used to guide therapy, including the CHA2DS2-VASc score.<sup>235</sup>

Therapeutic anticoagulation is the mainstay of risk reduction strategies in patients with HFrEF and AFib or a history of systemic or pulmonary emboli, including stroke or transient ischemic attack. However, anticoagulation therapy should be based on an assessment of the risk of thromboembolic events versus the risk of bleeding as recommended by clinical practice guidelines. While warfarin and other vitamin K antagonists (VKA) were the only available class of oral anticoagulants for many decades, their use is limited by a narrow therapeutic index that necessitates frequent monitoring and dose adjustments.<sup>236</sup> Therefore, the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) represent a particularly attractive therapeutic option in patients with nonvalvular AFib and concomitant HF, due to a more predictable therapeutic effect. Two meta-analyses of the clinical trials RE-LY, ROCKET AF, ARISTOTLE, and ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 in patients with nonvalvular AFib suggested that DOACs might have a more favorable risk-benefit profile, with significant reductions in stroke, major bleeding, and intracranial hemorrhage when compared to warfarin.236,237 DOACs are not approved for use in patients with mechanical heart valves or at least moderate mitral stenosis, because of increased evidence of thromboembolic and bleeding complications as compared with warfarin.<sup>238</sup> In such cases, only VKAs should be used for the prevention of thromboembolic stroke.1 For patients at high risk of bleeding, a left atrial occlusion device could be considered as an alternative to avoid the risk of anticoagulation-related hemorrhage.

Although anticoagulation in patients with HFrEF and documented AFib is well established, the role of oral anticoagulation in subjects with HFrEF and sinus rhythm is controversial and not recommended for routine use. This recommendation is based on the findings of previous randomized trials, including the WASH, HELAS, WATCH, and WARCEF.239-242 These trials failed consistently to show the benefit of warfarin for primary outcomes that included death and nonfatal stroke.243 In both WARCEF and a subsequent meta-analyses including all four trials, warfarin was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of ischemic stroke, which was offset by an increased rate of major bleeding. Interestingly, intracerebral hemorrhage remained very low and was not significantly different from aspirin.<sup>243</sup> Similarly, the COMMANDER-HF trial randomized patients with HFrEF, CAD, and sinus rhythm to the DOAC rivaroxaban or placebo and showed no significant differences in the composite outcome of all-cause mortality, MI, or stroke during a mean follow-up of 21 months.<sup>244</sup> In addition, patients assigned to rivaroxaban had more bleeding events requiring hospitalization than those assigned to placebo.

Evidence supporting anticoagulation in patients with a recent MI and documented LV thrombus is very limited, partially because most data were generated before the contemporary era of thrombolysis, percutaneous coronary intervention, dual antiplatelet therapy, and imaging techniques. Likewise, based on low-quality evidence, there is a weak recommendation for oral anticoagulation in the initial 3 months following a large anterior MI with symptomatic or asymptomatic IHD. Currently, there is no evidence on the benefits of antiplatelet drugs in patients with HFrEF without concomitant CAD, while there is a substantial risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and a potential inhibitory effect of aspirin on ACE inhibitors. Conversely, antiplatelet therapy for patients with CAD and LV systolic dysfunction should be guided by the applicable guidelines.

### Statins

Statins, also known as 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, are widely used for both the primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic CV disease. In addition to their lipid-lowering action, statins also have a variety of pleiotropic effects including antiinflammatory, antihypertrophic, antifibrotic, and antioxidant properties. Most of these effects can target important components of the complex physiopathology of HFrEF, such as endothelial dysfunction, neurohormonal activation and cardiac arrhythmias.<sup>245</sup> Conversely, statins are associated with a decrease in coenzyme Q10 levels and selenoprotein activity, which could lead to skeletal and cardiac myopathy.<sup>246</sup> Also, low concentrations of LDL cholesterol are associated with a worse prognosis in patients with HFrEF.

The best data on the role of statin therapy in HFrEF comes from two large randomized clinical trials, GISSI-HF and CORONA.245,246 The CORONA randomized subjects with IHD, NYHA class II–IV, and LVEF 35%–40% to either rosuvastatin or placebo and showed no significant difference in the primary composite outcome of CV death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke at a mean follow-up of 33 months. Following a similar protocol, the GISSI-HF studied this hypothesis among ischemic and nonischemic HF patients, rather than IHD patients only. At a mean follow-up of 47 months, the GISSI-HF investigators found no significant difference in all-cause mortality or in the combined outcome of death or CV hospitalization in both ischemic and nonischemic HF subjects.

Taken together, CORONA and GISSI-HF trials provide reasonably strong evidence against the routine use of statins for NYHA class II–IV HFrEF. Of note, the secondary outcome of all-cause hospitalizations in the CORONA trial was significantly reduced in the rosuvastatin group. Thus, in patients who are already receiving a statin for CAD, a continuation of this therapy may be considered.

#### **Antiarrhythmic Agents**

AFib is the most frequent arrhythmia in HF, with a prevalence ranging from  $<\!10\%$  of patients with mild disease up to nearly half of those with advanced HF. It can impair myocardial function by several mechanisms, including loss of atrial systole and rapid ventricular HR, both of which can reduce CO and diastolic filling time.  $^{247}$  Also, persistent tachycardia and irregular heart rhythm can lead to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, a relatively rare though well-recognized condition.

The general management of AFib is rather similar in patients with or without HF and involves three principles: thromboembolic risk assessment, ventricular rate control, and rhythm control in selected cases. 235 Most clinical trials in the general AFib population, such as the AFFIRM, have shown that rhythm control is not superior to rate control in terms of morbidity and mortality. 248 Patients with HF, however, present specific challenges, including a higher risk for side effects from certain antiarrhythmic drug. In a sub-analysis of the CHF-STAT trial, patients with HFrEF and AFib converted to sinus rhythm with amiodarone had significantly lower mortality than those who remained in AFib. 249 The same findings were seen in a substudy of the DIAMOND, with dofetilide. 250 Addressing this controversy, the large prospective randomized trial comparing current strategies for rhythm control among HFrEF with AFib, the AF-CHF trial, showed that higher rates of sinus rhythm did not translate into any clinical benefit. <sup>251</sup> Thus most clinical practice guidelines recommend that rhythm-control strategy should be reserved for patients with HFrEF and AFib-related symptoms or worsening HF despite adequate rate control.

The optimal HR for patients with concomitant AFib and HF is unclear. The RACE II trial found no difference in a composite of clinical outcomes when a strategy of strict rate control, defined as HR <80 beats/min at rest and <110 beats/min during moderate exercise, was compared with lenient rate control, defined as resting HR <110 beats/min. 252 However, a sustained HR >100 beats/min, and particularly >120 beats/min, can lead to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy and must be avoided. Available therapies for rate control of AFib include β-blockers, digoxin, nondihydropyridine CCBs, and amiodarone. In the context of HFrEF, β-blockers are recommended as first-line therapy, as individual patient data subgroup meta-analysis of clinical trials suggests no safety concerns. <sup>251</sup> In the event that a second drug is needed to achieve rate control, the combination of digoxin and a β-blocker is more effective than a β-blocker alone. Nevertheless, as previously noted, a direct association between SDC and mortality was consistently reported in observational studies and post hoc analysis of clinical trials.

Routine use of nondihydropyridine CCBs, such as verapamil or diltiazem, should be avoided in patients with HFrEF due to their negative inotropic effects. However, in selected cases, the shortterm IV administration of diltiazem can be considered for the acute management of AFib with rapid ventricular response. If rate control has not been achieved with either a β-blocker or a combination of a β-blocker and digoxin, amiodarone may be useful. Of note, there is a small chance that amiodarone may pharmacologically cardiovert patients to sinus rhythm.

Rhythm control can be achieved with pharmacological or electrical cardioversion, catheter ablation, or surgical ablation. Antiarrhythmic drugs for the maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with AFib and HFrEF are limited to dofetilide or amiodarone. Dofetilide is a class III antiarrhythmic drug that selectively inhibits the rapid component of the late potassium current through cell membranes, increasing the refractory period. In the DIAMOND trial, patients with symptomatic HFrEF and AFib treated with dofetilide were significantly more likely to convert to sinus rhythm when compared to placebo.<sup>250</sup> However, dofetilide requires inpatient stay for loading, and there is a significant risk of torsades de pointes observed in 3.3% of all cases. Because of such risk, dofetilide is not approved in Europe and is only available by mail order or through specially trained local pharmacies in the United States.

Amiodarone is another class III antiarrhythmic with little or no negative inotropic or proarrhythmic effects, particularly when lower doses of 100–200 mg/day are used for maintenance therapy. Despite potentially significant side effects, amiodarone is the ideal antiarrhythmic agent for the rhythm control strategy and may improve the success of electrical cardioversion. Advantages of amiodarone compared to dofetilide include the ability to start therapy as an outpatient, once-a-day dosing and a lower risk of torsades de pointes. Side effects, such as hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, pulmonary fibrosis, and hepatitis, are less likely with maintenance therapy at lower doses, but still occur. Amiodarone also increases the serum concentrations of phenytoin and digoxin and prolongs the INR in patients taking VKAs, thus monitoring is advised.

Dronedarone, a derivative of amiodarone with shorter half-life and devoid of iodine moiety, should not be used in patients with advanced HFrEF and long-standing persistent AFib. Strong evidence against its use comes from the ANDROMEDA trial, which had to be discontinued early because of a two fold increase in mortality in the dronedarone-treated HFrEF subjects, mainly due to worsening HF.<sup>253</sup> Other antiarrhythmic drugs, especially class I sodium-channel blockers, are associated with an increased proarrhythmic risk and sudden cardiac death in patients with HF and are contraindicated.

#### **Direct Renin Inhibitors**

Based on the observation that long-term therapies with ACE inhibitors or ARBs provoke a compensatory increase in renin and its downstream intermediaries, direct renin inhibitors (DRIs) offer another pharmacologically distinct route of RAAS inhibition. Aliskiren is a first-in-class orally active DRI that provides significant BP-lowering efficacy in patients with hypertension, with no rebound effects after withdrawal. In early preclinical and proof-of-concept studies, aliskiren appeared to produce similar, if not greater, beneficial impact on RAAS inhibition, cardiac hypertrophy, LV wall thickness, and diastolic function when compared to ACE inhibitors and ARBs. <sup>254,255</sup>

Promising results from the ALOFT trial, in which aliskiren was shown to decrease plasma NT-proBNP and urinary aldosterone excretion in HFrEF subjects, yielded several large trials to determine whether adding aliskiren to standard HFrEF therapy would improve clinical outcomes. However, both the ASTRONAUT and the ATMOSPHERE trials failed to improve outcomes in HFrEF subjects. In fact, the ASTRONAUT found a tendency toward harm in diabetic patients, and the ATMOSPHERE showed that the addition of aliskiren to enalapril led to more adverse events, as hyperkalemia, renal dysfunction, and symptomatic hypotension. Therefore, DRIs are not recommended as an alternative to an ACE inhibitor or ARB in patients with HFrEF. Fig. 3.8 summarize the 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/AHA/Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) recommended approach to the treatment of stages C and D HFrEF.

# **Heart Failure Patients With Preserved Ejection Fraction**

#### Introdution

For many decades, the definition of HF was most commonly associated with LV systolic dysfunction and HFrEF. However, epidemiologic data indicate that at least 50% of all patients with HF have preserved LVEF, a prevalence that has increased over time.

The diagnosis of HFpEF requires the presence of symptoms and/or signs of HF, a LVEF ≥50%, elevated concentrations of NP, and evidence of diastolic dysfunction or relevant structural heart disease. It should be noted that diastolic dysfunction and HFpEF are not synonymous, as diastolic dysfunction might also be present in HFrEF. Recently, the H2FPEF score was elaborated to estimate the probability of HFpEF versus noncardiac causes of dyspnea. <sup>259</sup>

Fig. 3.8 See legend on next page

Large outcome trials and registries have demonstrated that the demographics, comorbidities, prognoses, and, most importantly, responses to pharmacotherapy differ between HFpEF and HFrEF. Patients with HFpEF are older, more often females, and have higher rates of hypertension, AFib, obesity, and anemia when compared to those with HFREF. They are also less likely to have IHD, although the prevalence of CAD is not trivial.4,17,171,260

All-cause mortality is generally lower in HFpEF than in HFrEF. Nevertheless, the incidence of non-CV deaths is significantly higher for HFpEF patients, reflecting their higher age and increased comorbidity. Also, while survival rates in HFrEF have significantly improved over the past decades, HFpEF prognosis remains the same.<sup>261</sup> No treatment has yet been shown, convincingly, to reduce morbidity or mortality in patients with HFpEF. Therapeutic targets in HFpEF are directed toward associated conditions and include control of congestion, stabilization of HR and BP, and efforts at improving exercise tolerance.<sup>40</sup> Experience has demonstrated that BP control, in accordance with published clinical practice guidelines, is more effective to alleviate symptoms and improve wellbeing than targeted therapy with specific agents.

# Heart Failure Patients With Mid-Range Ejection Fraction

Despite the widespread adoption of ejection fraction-based classification of HF, the optimal cut-off for group characterization have varied across studies.<sup>5</sup> Medical societies acknowledged that patients with an LVEF in the range of 40% to 49% represent a "grey area," and thus an intermediate group was added to the 2016 ESC HF Guidelines, entitled HF with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF).1 Because HFmrEF patients have generally been included in trials of HFpEF, the following guidance applies to both phenotypes of HFmrEF and HFpEF. Identifying HFmrEF as a separate group will stimulate research into their unique characteristics. As new evidence demonstrating a prognostic difference between these categories becomes available, it might be possible to make separate recommendations for each one.

# Pharmacotherapy

#### Diuretics

Diuretics are widely used to attenuate symptoms and signs of congestion in both HFrEF and HFpEF, although their effects on longterm survival have never been demonstrated. The goal of decongestive diuretic therapy is similar in all phenotypes of HF, with caution to avoid excessive preload reduction and hypotension.<sup>33</sup> In the small-size Hong Kong Diastolic Heart Failure Study, patients with HFpEF, defined as LVEF >45%, were randomized to diuretics alone or combined with ramipril or irbesartan.<sup>262</sup> Diuretic therapy alone significantly improved quality-of-life assessments, while the addition of ramipril or irbesartan provided only slight additional beneficial effects. Further benefit of diuretics was suggested by an ancillary analysis of the CHAMPION trial, a single-blind clinical trial of a wireless implantable PAP monitor, the CARDIOMEMs, to guide ambulatory management of HF.263,264 In the ancillary study, treatment decisions driven by the CARDIOMEMs, notably changes in mean loop diuretic dose, were associated with a significant reduction in HF hospitalizations.

Recent preclinical data suggest that empagliflozin reduces myofilament passive stiffness and improves diastolic tension of human end-stage HF ventricular trabeculae, independently of glucose or calcium metabolism modulation.<sup>265</sup> Beneficial diuretic and cardiometabolic effects make SGLT-2 inhibitors particularly attractive for obese HFpEF patients with volume overload and adipose inflammation.<sup>266</sup> Trials such as the EMPEROR-Preserved, DELIVER, and DETERMINE are currently investigating the safety and efficacy of SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with HFpEF. Current guidelines for the treatment of HFpEF recommend management of volume overload with appropriate diuretic dosing, but do not provide any guidance on therapy choice.

# Renin-Angiotensin Blockade: Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers

Both angiotensin II and aldosterone are known contributors to LV hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis, which are important determinants of diastolic dysfunction. The rationale in the use of a RAAS antagonist in HFpEF is to prevent the prohypertrophic and profibrotic effects of angiotensin II. In addition, many underlying risk factors and comorbidities for HFpEF, such as hypertension, T2DM, CAD, and chronic kidney disease, benefit from treatment with ACE inhibitors and ARBs.

The PEP-CHF trial evaluated the effectiveness of perindopril versus placebo on the primary composite outcome of all-cause mortality or HF hospitalization in subjects older than 70 years with HFpEF, defined as LVEF >45%.<sup>267</sup> Despite being the largest trial of ACE inhibitors in HFpEF, PEP-CHF failed to meet sufficient power for its primary composite outcome due to lower than expected enrollment and a high rate of crossover to open-label ACE inhibitor. A post hoc analysis using only the first year of follow-up, when crossover rates were lower, suggested a favorable trend with perindopril, primarily driven by reduction in HF hospitalizations. Other mechanistic studies in the elderly showed conflicting results or no benefits of ACE inhibitors on exercise tolerance, quality-of-life assessments, aortic distensibility, peripheral neurohormone expression, or LV mass.

Two large randomized clinical trials, CHARM-Preserved and I-PRESERVE, addressed the benefit of ARB use in patients with HFpEF. The CHARM-Preserved trial was part of the CHARM program and randomized subjects with NYHA class II–IV HFpEF, defined as LVEF >40%, to either candesartan or placebo.171,268 After adjustments for nonsignificant covariates in baseline characteristics, the trial showed a reduction in HF hospitalizations with candesartan, but no difference in all-cause mortality. It is unknown whether that benefit was driven by neurohormonal blockade or simply by hypertension management, as the candesartan group achieved better BP control when compared to the placebo control group. The I-PRESERVE trial evaluated irbesartan versus placebo in subjects with NYHA class II–IV HFpEF, defined as LVEF >45%, and found no significant differences for a variety of CV outcomes, including death from any cause and CV hospitalization. However, a doubling of creatinine and serious hyperkalemia occurred more often in the irbesartan group.

According to current ACC/AHA HF guidelines, it is reasonable to use ACE inhibitors or ARBs for BP control in patients with hypertension and HFpEF. Also, based on the CHARM-Preserved, ARBs might be considered to decrease HFpEF admissions.

### Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists

Aldosterone has been associated with oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, ventricular hypertrophy, and myocardial fibrosis, mechanisms known to influence the progression of HFpEF. <sup>186,270</sup> MRAs antagonize the detrimental effects of aldosterone and can improve diastolic function.

In the ALDO-DHF trial, spironolactone improved echocardiographic indices of diastolic dysfunction in patients with HFpEF. even after adjustment for the effect in systolic BP.<sup>271</sup> However, it had no effect on exercise capacity, symptoms, or other quality-oflife assessments when compared to placebo. The large-scale TOP-CAT trial randomized patients with symptomatic HFpEF, defined as LVEF  $\geq$ 45%, to receive either spironolactone or placebo. 272 At a mean follow-up of 3.3 years, there was no difference in the primary composite outcome of CV mortality, aborted cardiac arrest, or HF hospitalization. However, spironolactone was associated with a secondary signal of benefit on HF hospitalizations. Further subgroup analysis of the TOPCAT found a controversial heterogeneity of results across regions of enrollment. Eastern European, including Russian and Georgian participants, had roughly equivalent rates of HF hospitalization and CV mortality to age- and gender-matched controls, suggesting that they might not have suffered from HFpEF. They also had no significant changes in BP, creatinine, or potassium levels, and the metabolic product of spironolactone was low or undetected implying nonconsumption of the study medication. By contrast, a post hoc sub-analysis of the Americas, including Canada, United States, Brazil, and Argentina participants, showed that the rates of CV mortality and HF hospitalization were significantly reduced by spironolactone.<sup>273</sup>

Adverse events in the TOPCAT included a higher rate of hyper-kalemia and acute kidney injury not requiring dialysis in the spironolactone group. According to current ACC/AHA HF guidelines, MRAs might be considered to decrease hospitalizations in selected patients with HFpEF, defined as LVEF  $\geq\!45\%$ , with elevated BNP levels or HF admission within 1 year, GFR  $>\!30$  mL/min/1.73 m², creatinine  $<\!2.5$  mg/dL, and potassium  $<\!5.0$  mEq/L.

# **Angiotensin Receptor Neprilysin Inhibitors**

Patients with preclinical diastolic dysfunction have an impaired natriuretic and renal endocrine response to acute volume expansion early in the development of HFpEF.<sup>274</sup> The disappointing results of the CHARM-Preserved, PEP-CHF, and I-PRESERVE trials prompted studies with the dual-action agent sacubitril–valsartan, which splits into an ARB and a NEP inhibitor after absorption. NEP inhibition increases NPs and intracellular cGMP, which in turn improves myocardial relaxation and hypertrophy. NPs also stimulate diuresis, natriuresis, and vasodilation, and might have additional antifibrotic and antisympathetic effects.

The proof-of-concept PARAMOUNT-HF trial randomized patients with NYHA class II-III HFpEF, defined as LVEF >45% and elevated levels of NP, to receive therapy with sacubitril-valsartan or valsartan alone.<sup>275</sup> Sacubitril–valsartan was safe and led to a greater reduction in NT-proBNP at 12 weeks, but not at 36 weeks, along with left atrial reverse remodeling and improvement in NYHA functional class. The PARAMOUNT-HF was followed by the largest clinical trial in HFpEF to date, the PARAGON-HF, which followed a similar protocol to assess the efficacy of sacubitril-valsartan or valsartan alone on the primary composite outcome of CV death and HF hospitalizations. After a median follow-up of 35 months, the sacubitril-valsartan failed to significantly reduce the primary composite outcome. However, exploratory secondary endpoints suggested an improvement in NYHA class and renal function with sacubitril-valsartan. Importantly, there was evidence of a heterogeneous response to treatment, with potential benefit in certain subgroups, such as women and patients in the lower end of the LVEF range included in the study (45% to 57%). Sacubitril–valsartan was associated with a higher rate of hypotension and lower rates of elevated potassium and creatinine compared with valsartan, findings similar to those seen in the PARADIGM-HF trial. Angioedema was also more frequent with sacubitril–valsartan (0.6% vs 0.2%), although none of the cases was associated with airway compromise. Sacubitril–valsartan is currently FDA-approved for use in patients with HF and LVEF 40% but has no indication for HFpEF at this time.

# β-Blockers

The potential benefits of β-blockers in HFpEF include improvements in BP, HR, diastolic filling time, myocardial oxygen demand, and, with vasodilating agents, arterial stiffness. Conversely, patients with HFpEF have a high prevalence of chronotropic incompetence associated with exercise intolerance, which could be further impaired by β-blockers.

In the SWEDIC study, carvedilol showed echocardiographic improvement in diastolic function from baseline to 6 months when compared to placebo.<sup>276</sup> The SENIORS trial was a placebocontrolled study that tested the effect of nebivolol, a vasodilating β1-blocker, in both HFpEF and HFrEF patients with a LVEF cut-off of 35% for group characterization.<sup>152</sup> A 14% relative risk reduction was observed in the primary composite outcome of all-cause mortality or CV hospitalization, driven primarily by the effect on hospitalizations, that was not different between patients with LVEF above versus below 35%. However, as very few patients with LVEF 50% were included in the trial, no definite conclusion can be drawn about the benefit of nebivolol in HFpEF. The small-size J-DHF trial randomized patients with HFpEF, defined as LVEF >40%, to carvedilol or placebo and found no significant difference in the composite of CV death and unplanned HF hospitalization.<sup>277</sup>

The OPTIMIZE-HF registry found no significant association between β-blocker use and mortality or rehospitalization rates in patients with HFpEF at 60–90 days.17 However, in a subanalysis including only patients with HR 70 beats/min, high-dose β-blocker use was associated with a significantly lower risk of death.278 Accordingly, the COHERE registry also showed that β-blocker use was associated with a significant reduction in mortality in a cohort of HFpEF patients followed up for 25 months.279

There is no definitive evidence for the benefit of β-blockers in patients with HFpEF. According to current ACC/AHA HF guidelines, it is reasonable to use β-blockers for BP control in patients with hypertension and HFpEF.

# Digoxin, Calcium Channel Blockers, and Ivabradine

A subgroup analysis of the I-PRESERVE study showed that higher HR was an independent predictor of adverse clinical outcomes among HFpEF patients in normal sinus rhythm.<sup>280</sup> The theory that a reduced diastolic filling time may have detrimental effects in HFpEF led to the investigation of HR-lowering drugs, such as digoxin, nondihydropyridine CCBs, and ivabradine, in that population.

Potential benefits of digoxin in HFpEF include improvements in the active energy-dependent early diastolic function and on neurohormonal profile, as previously described. The DIG ancillary trial was a parallel study to the original DIG trial that included a separate cohort of patients with ambulatory HFpEF, defined as LVEF >45%, and normal sinus rhythm, receiving ACE inhibitors and diuretics.<sup>281</sup> After a mean follow-up of 37 months, digoxin use was not associated with any effect on total, CV, or HF mortality, or total or CV hospitalizations, although a trend toward a reduction of HF hospitalization was observed. To date, the indications for digoxin use in HF are limited to patients with HFrEF. However, it may be considered in patients with HFPEF to slow a rapid ventricular response during AFib.

CCBs may act as third- or fourth-line antihypertensive drugs in patients with HFpEF and hypertension. Data regarding the use of HR-lowering nondihydropyridine CCBs in HFpEF are rare. A small-size placebo-controlled, crossover trial assigned subjects with HFpEF, defined as LVEF >45%, to verapamil or placebo and suggested some improvement of symptoms and exercise tolerance with the CCB.<sup>282</sup> The impact of HR reduction with ivabradine in HFpEF patients is controversial. Small-size randomized trials suggested that short- and long-term treatment with ivabradine is beneficial in terms of diastolic function and exercise capacity improvement in HFpEF patients.283,284 However, the results of those studies are in contrast with another randomized placebo-controlled trial showing that ivabradine did not improve exercise capacity, but instead worsened VO2 in the HFpEF cohort.<sup>285</sup> Large randomized trials are required to confirm these observations.

Patients with HFpEF are at greater risk for AFib than the general age-matched population. A rhythm-control strategy is preferred because LV filling in HFpEF occurs largely in late diastole and, consequently, is more dependent on the atrial contraction. When sinus rhythm cannot be achieved, rate control strategy becomes important. The ideal HR in patients with HFpEF and AFib is uncertain, but aggressive HR control might be deleterious and should be avoided. Whether digoxin,  $\beta$ -blockers, or nondihydropyridine CCBs, or a combination of these, should be preferred is unknown. Non-dihydropyridine CCBs should not be combined with a  $\beta$ -blocker.

# Nitric Oxide and cGMP Signaling: Phosphodiesterase-5 Inhibitors, Nitrates, and Soluble Guanylate Cyclase Stimulators

PDE-5 inhibitors, nitrates, and sGC stimulators are expected to provide beneficial effects in HFpEF through activation of the NO and cGMP (NO-cGMP) pathway. The NO-cGMP pathway has been shown to play an important role in CV physiology, especially in vasodilation, pulmonary vascular tone, and cardiac remodeling. <sup>286</sup>

The expression of PDE-5 has been proposed to increase in patients with HF. Blockade of cGMP breakdown through PDE-5 inhibition may provide benefits for both vascular and myocardial remodeling, including attenuating hypertrophy, fibrosis, and impaired cardiac relaxation. A small clinical trial demonstrated that after 6 and 12 months, sildenafil significantly improved filling pressures and RV function in patients with HFpEF, defined as LVEF  $\geq \! 50\%$ , and pulmonary hypertension.  $^{287}$  Those promising results led to the RELAX trial, which failed to show any difference in exercise capacity or clinical status between sildenafil and placebo in patients with NYHA class II–IV HFpEF, defined as LVEF  $\geq \! 50\%$ , after 24 weeks of treatment.  $^{288}$ 

Following the neutral results of the RELAX trial, attention had turn to increasing NO availability through use of long-acting nitrates. Nitrates reduce intracardiac filling pressures by lowering both cardiac preload and afterload. Furthermore, high-dose nitrates are effective in improving symptoms and clinical status in patients with ADHF, irrespective of LV systolic function. The NEAT-HFpEF trial was performed on the premise that long-acting isosorbide mononitrate could improve daily activity level in patients with NYHA class II–III HFpEF, defined as LVEF  $\geq\!50\%$ . However, at a mean follow-up of 6 weeks, isosorbide mononitrate did not improve quality-of-life, submaximal exercise capacity, or NT-proBNP levels, but instead decreased overall activity levels when compared to placebo.

Although both RELAX and NEAT-HFpEF trials yielded disappointing results, they only observed the short-term effects of each drug in HFpEF patients and did not assess the effects on clinical outcomes. Current ACC/AHA HF guidelines do no recommend the

routine use of PDE-5 inhibitors or nitrates to increase activity or quality of life in patients with HFpEF. These recommendations, however, do not apply to patients with angina, for whom nitrates may provide symptomatic relief, or pulmonary arterial hypertension, for whom sildenafil is currently approved.

The oral sGC stimulator riociguat independently activates sGC, the central protein in the NO-cGMP pathway, and also sensitizes it to endogenous NO. The small-size DILATE-1 study tested the hemodynamic effects, safety, and pharmacokinetics of riociguat in patients with HFpEF, defined as LVEF >50%, and pulmonary hypertension.<sup>290</sup> While there was no change in the primary outcome of decrease in mean PAP 6 hours after administration, riociguat significantly improved SV and systolic BP without changing PVR or HR. Large randomized trials are required to confirm these observations.

# Other Medications

Contributing factors and comorbidities have an important impact on the clinical course of HFpEF patients. Treatment of hyperlipidemia is recommended for the primary and secondary prevention of CV disease. Besides their lipid-lowering properties, statins also have beneficial effects on LV fibrosis and hypertrophy, endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffness, and inflammation, all of which contribute to the pathophysiology of HFpEF. While observational data suggest that statins might be of benefit in patients with HFpEF, there are no randomized trials to support its routinely use in clinical practice. In the GISSI-HF trial, no benefit was observed with rosuvastatin in the 10% of patients enrolled with relatively preserved LVEF.<sup>245</sup> Current HF guidelines support the use of statin therapy for patients with known CAD, but do not recommended it for the treatment of HFpEF alone in the absence of other indications.

Ranolazine is a first-in-class anti-anginal drug that selectively inhibits the late sodium current and reduces sodium and calcium overload during ischemia. Data from an HF dog model suggested that ranolazine improves LV end-diastolic pressure. The RALI-DHF trial was a small proof-of-concept study evaluating the effect of ranolazine in patients with HFpEF, defined as LVEF 45%, administered intravenously for 24 hours.<sup>291</sup> Ranolazine showed modest improvement in some hemodynamic parameters but had no effect on relaxation. Also, after 14 days of oral administration, there were no significant changes in echocardiographic parameters, NT-proBNP, or exercise performance. Large randomized trials

are required to confirm these observations.

# Reverse Cardiac Remodeling: Remission Versus Recovery

Advances in medical and device therapies have demonstrated the capacity of the heart to reverse harmful remodeling. Patients who present with improved or recovered LVEF appear to be clinically different from those with persistently reduced or preserved LVEF and have a much better prognosis.<sup>5</sup> Cardiac magnetic resonance findings, specifically the late gadolinium enhancement and the myocardial edema ratio, together with a serial BNP testing may provide a better prediction of LV reverse remodeling than endomyocardial biopsy results or conventional methods of follow-up.292 Prediction of LV reverse remodeling has important clinical implications, including cost effectiveness of implantable cardioverterdefibrillators and optimal timing for cardiac transplantation referral.

Evidence on whether patients with LV reverse remodeling benefit from indefinite maintenance of therapy is rare, and there are no clear recommendations in guidelines. The TRED-HF trial was an open-label, randomized study of evidence-based medical treatment withdrawal following LV reverse remodeling in patients with a prior diagnosis of DCM taking at least one medication. The primary outcome of HF relapse was met in 44% of subjects in the therapy-withdrawal group compared with none in the control group over a follow-up period of 6 months.<sup>293</sup> During a crossover phase, in which subjects originally assigned to continued treatment underwent therapy withdrawal under the same protocol, the primary outcome was seen in 36% of subjects. Importantly, HF relapse was asymptomatic in all patients over the duration of follow-up. The TRED-HF suggests that, for many patients with LV reverse remodeling, improvement in cardiac function following treatment does not reflect complete recovery but rather reflects remission, which requires indefinite continuation of therapy. Thus, withdrawal of treatment should not be attempted routinely in patients with LV reverse remodeling.

# Drugs That Should Be Avoided or Used Cautiously in Heart Failure

Polypharmacy is a significant concern in patients with HF because of the burden of both CV and non-CV conditions. Below is a brief summary of drugs that should be avoided or used with caution in HF. A detailed description of all drug classes that may cause or exacerbate HF is beyond the scope of this document. A 2016 AHA Scientific Statement provides a comprehensive list of such drugs and can be found elsewhere.<sup>294</sup>

Traditional nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors are not recommended in patients with HF, as they increase the risk of HF precipitation and exacerbation. NSAIDs have the potential to trigger HF through sodium and water retention, increased SVR, and impaired responses to ACE inhibitors and diuretics. They are also associated with increased risk of renal dysfunction and hyperkalemia.

Most anesthetics interfere with cardiac performance either by direct myocardial depression or by impairing hemodynamic responses, such as HR, contractility, preload, afterload, and SVR. Although propofol has both vasodilatory and negative inotropic properties, myocardial depression at clinical doses is minimal. It can decrease BP, SVR, myocardial blood flow, oxygen consumption, and LV preload possibly through direct vasodilation. Such changes may be beneficial in the setting of elevated LV preload, but should be cautiously monitored. Ketamine has both negative inotropic and central sympathetic stimulation effects. In patients with advanced LV dysfunction, the sympathetic stimulation may not be sufficient to overcome its negative inotropic effects, resulting in CV instability.

The oral antidiabetic drugs metformin and thiazolidinediones pose particular risks in patients with HF. Although metformin should be considered the treatment of choice in patients with T2DM and HF, there is an increased risk of potentially lethal lactic acidosis. In 2016, the FDA published a safety warning recommending that metformin should be contraindicated in patients with renal function below 30 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> . Thiazolidinediones cause sodium and water retention, which may precipitate HF. The 2016 American Diabetes Association standards of medical care recommend avoiding thiazolidinediones in patients with symptomatic HF. There is also limited evidence suggesting that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, including sitagliptin, saxagliptin, alogliptin, and linagliptin, may increase the risk of HF hospitalization. The true mechanism of this potential risk remains unknown, but given their current popularity and growing use, randomized clinical trials in patients with established HF are needed.

Most antiarrhythmics have a negative inotropic activity that can precipitate HF. Some exert an additional proarrhythmic effect, particularly class I sodium-channel blockers and class III ibutilide, sotalol, and dofetilide, and should be contraindicated in patients with HF. Also, as previously discussed, the ANDROMEDA trial was terminated prematurely for increased mortality in the class III dronedarone-treated HF subjects. The latter PALLAS study was also terminated early due to an increase in CV death, stroke, and HF hospitalization associated with dronedarone. Thus, dronedarone is contraindicated in patients with symptomatic HF with recent decompensation requiring hospitalization, or NYHA class IV HF.

CCBs should generally be avoided in patients with chronic HFrEF. Some dihydropyridine CCBs, such as nifedipine, have both negative inotropic and vasodilating effects and have been associated with higher incidence of HF hospitalization and premature discontinuation of therapy due to clinical deterioration. By contrast, amlodipine, a dihydropyridine CCB without negative inotropic effect, appears to be safe in patients with HF and can be used to treat associated angina or hypertension. Of note, both PRAISE and PRAISE 2 trials assessing the effects of amlodipine in HF reported a higher incidence of peripheral edema and pulmonary congestion that should be considered when prescribing the drug. Nondihydropyridine CCBs, such as diltiazem and verapamil, cause less vasodilation but more contractility depression than dihydropyridine CCBs.

Some antifungal agents, such as itraconazole or amphotericin B, have been associated with reports of cardiotoxicity, premature ventricular contractions, ventricular fibrillation, hypertension, and new-onset cardiomyopathy or worsening HF. Other antimicrobial agents, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, should be avoided or used with caution in patients taking ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or MRAs, due to an elevated risk of hyperkalemia.

Limited data are available on the safety and efficacy of neurological and psychiatric medications in patients with HF. Considering the well-recognized risk of sympathetic stimulation in patients with serious cardiac disease, amphetamines should not be used in patients with HF. Among antiepileptic drugs, carbamazepine has been associated with hypotension, AV block, and HF symptoms in patients without CV disease, while pregabalin is possibly related to peripheral edema and HF exacerbation. Several antipsychotic medications have been associated with torsades de pointes secondary to QT prolongation. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) have numerous known adverse CV effects, including sinus tachycardia, postural hypotension, second- and third-degree block, QT prolongation, and direct myocardial depression. While selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) have a lower rate of adverse CV effects than TCAs, some SSRI, like citalopram, may present a dosedependent risk of QT prolongation, which could lead to torsades de pointes. The largest randomized study of depression in HFrEF, the SADHART-CHF trial, showed that although the use of the SSRI sertraline was safe, it did not provide greater improvement in depression or CV status when compared with nurse-facilitated support.295

Concerns have been raised about the safety of PDE inhibitors in patients with HF. Earlier experience with long-term oral milrinone was associated with increased risk of fatal arrhythmias compared with placebo, and thus, none of the currently available oral PDE-3 inhibitors are approved for use in patients with HF.<sup>296</sup> While it is not established if cilostazol, an oral PDE-3 inhibitor used in the treatment of intermittent claudication, impacts mortality in patients with HF, the FDA recommends against its use in HF of any severity. The PDE-5 inhibitors, including sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil, are used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction in men by increasing the amount of cGMP that relaxes the corpus cavernosum smooth muscle. They are potent vasodilators that can also lower pulmonary and systemic arterial pressure. The combined use of PDE-5 inhibitors with any form of nitrate therapy is contraindicated due to the risk of severe hypotension. Combination with other PDE inhibitors, such as milrinone, should be avoided as well.

Several antineoplastic chemotherapy agents are cardiotoxic and can lead to short- and long-term cardiac morbidity. Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity has been studied extensively and is associated in large part to the cumulative generation of free radicals leading to LV dysfunction and HF. Antimetabolites, such as 5-fluorouracil, and targeted therapies, including ErbB antagonists, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and monoclonal antibodies, also have shown to induce cardiomyopathy and myocardial ischemia. In contrast to anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity, trastuzumab-related cardiac dysfunction is most often reversible and does not appear to increase with cumulative dose, nor is it associated with ultrastructural changes in the myocardium. Cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension have been described with the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors and antimicrotubule agents, while pericarditis can happen with the use of bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, or cytarabine. Mediastinal radiation can also cause constrictive pericarditis, myocardial fibrosis, valvular lesions, and CAD. Iron-chelating agents that prevent generation of oxygen free radicals, such as dexrazoxane, may confer some cardioprotection in patients receiving anthracyclines. According to current ESC HF guidelines, chemotherapy should be discontinued and HFrEF therapy initiated in patients developing moderate to severe LV systolic dysfunction. If LV function improves, the risks and benefits of further chemotherapy need to be individualized.

# Pharmacological Treatment of Selected Cardiomyopathies

Cardiomyopathies are diseases of the heart muscle that may arise from a variety of underlying conditions including genetic abnormalities, myocyte injury, or infiltrative processes of the myocardial and interstitial tissues.297,298 The term is intended to exclude cardiac dysfunction that results from other structural heart disease, such as CAD, primary valve disease, severe hypertension, and congenital heart disease. The most common classification is based on structural and functional changes, including dilated, hypertrophic, and restrictive cardiomyopathies. The general goals of cardiomyopathy treatment are to manage signs and symptoms, prevent HF worsening, and reduce the risk of complications. In most cases, chronic HF should be treated according to current HF guidelines. However, specific treatment may differ according to underlying disease. Below is a brief summary of the current understanding and specific pharmacological treatment of selected cardiomyopathies. A 2016 AHA Scientific Statement on current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific cardiomyopathies provides a comprehensive review on the management of most cardiomyopathies.<sup>299</sup>

Cardiac amyloidosis usually starts as restrictive cardiomyopathy with mild LV systolic dysfunction and significant diastolic dysfunction but can progress to severe HF in advanced stages. The most common types of cardiac amyloidosis encountered in clinical practice, defined by their precursor proteins, are primary lightchain (AL) and familial or senile transthyretin (ATTR). Treatment is for the most part supportive. AL amyloidosis may have a very poor prognosis, especially when other organs are affected by progressive amyloid deposition. Patients with important clinical cardiac involvement in AL amyloidosis have been largely excluded from studies with melphalan and hematopoietic cell transplantation. ATTR cardiac amyloidosis is the most common form of cardiac amyloidosis and typically results from deposition of transthyretin, a transport protein that carries thyroxine and retinol-binding protein-retinol complex, in the myocardium. The randomized, placebo-controlled ATTR-ACT trial tested tafamidis, a transthyretin stabilizer, in patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy and showed a significant reduction in overall mortality and CV hospitalization at 30 months when compared to placebo.<sup>300</sup> Tafamidis was also associated with improvements in quality-of-life assessments and functional status. On the strength of those findings, the FDA granted tafamidis a "breakthrough therapy designation" in 2018.

In patients with cardiomyopathy related to substance abuse, total abstinence from cardiotoxic agents and drugs is recommended. There are no studies of specific pharmacotherapies in patients with alcoholic cardiomyopathy other than the standard therapy for HF. However, recovery of ventricular function has been observed in some patients following cessation of alcohol intake, largely in the early course of the disease.

Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is an uncommon form of HF that happens during the last month of pregnancy or up to 5 months postpartum. Guideline-recommended HF therapies should be considered, with special attention to specific classes of drugs that are contraindicated during pregnancy and/or breastfeeding. Preliminary data have suggested a potential benefit from prolactin blockade with bromocriptine on the basis of its proposed mechanistic role in PPCM. However, further studies are needed before recommendations on bromocriptine use can be issued.

Corticosteroids are considered the mainstay of therapy for autoimmune cardiomyopathic syndromes, such as cardiac sarcoidosis and eosinophilic endocarditis.<sup>301</sup> However, the optimal dose and duration of treatment have not been well recognized. Chagas cardiomyopathy is a major public health disease in Latin America and, due to migration, is becoming a worldwide health and economic burden. Antiparasitic therapy with benznidazole is recommended for acute and congenital disease, reactivated infections, and chronic disease in patients younger than 18 years, but its role in the chronic phase of Chagas cardiomyopathy remains controversial.<sup>302</sup>

Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy (TIC) is a rare but potentially reversible cause of HF, resulting from long-standing tachyarrhythmia or frequent ectopic beats. Although available data suggest that a HR>100 beats/min can lead to HF, the exact HR at which TIC occurs is not defined. Maintenance of sinus rhythm or control of ventricular rate is indicated in treating patients with TIC, as previously described.

The evidence supporting HF treatment in the pediatric population comes largely from adult studies and includes diuretics, βblockers, RAAS inhibitors, and other medications as previously described. Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are a group of about 50 rare inherited metabolic disorders that result from deficiencies in catabolic enzymes leading to pathogenic lysosomal accumulation. Each LSD is characterized by the accumulation of specific substrates. Some LSDs, such as Pompe and Fabry diseases, are known to cause cardiomyopathy. Other, like the Gaucher disease, rarely cause cardiac involvement, although allelic variants have been reported, with valvular disease and recurrent pericarditis resulting in constriction. Genetic testing occasionally enables the detection of LSDs for which replacement of defective enzymes is indicated and has been shown to produce substantial clinical benefit.

Iron-overload cardiomyopathy results from the accumulation of iron in the myocardium, and it is the leading cause of death in patients receiving chronic blood transfusion therapy.<sup>303</sup> Definitive treatment is centered on iron removal, usually through phlebotomy in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis or chelation therapy in those with secondary iron overload. The optimal chelation regime must be individualized and will vary according to the current clinical situation.

# Future Perspectives

Despite an overwhelming progress in the treatment of HFrEF, HF as a syndrome is still frequently associated with unacceptably high rates of rehospitalization and mortality. In addition, evidence-based medicine with respect to optimal treatment of ADHF and HFpEF remains scarce, with very limited direct data to support any specific drug regimen. The complexity of HF requires a widespread application of best-care practice standards aligned with new medical treatment options.

Research of molecules that modulate contractility accompanied by a growing appreciation of the role of pharmacogenomics may lead to further advances in the field of HFrEF.<sup>34</sup> Ongoing efforts to elucidate the pathobiology of individuals with HF will be better defined by specific expressed microRNAs, which may lead to a tailored therapy with RNA analogues, gene or cell therapy.<sup>304</sup>

To address the knowledge gap in ADHF, the AHA advocates for coordinated international efforts to identify research priorities, conduct clinical trials, and create large population-based registries.<sup>97</sup> Potential therapeutic targets for HFpEF are cardiometabolic abnormalities, microvascular inflammation, and cellular/extracellular structural changes. Ongoing studies are evaluating novel therapies including antiinflammatory drugs, mitochondrial activators, antifibrotic agents, and strategies to enhance the compliance of titin, the elastic sarcomeric protein that regulates cardiomyocytederived stiffness.<sup>266</sup>

#### Summary

1. Drug therapies for HF differ depending on the distinct phenotype and its presentation. Distinctive phenotypes of presentation have different management targets, ranging from acute HF to chronic HF with reduced or preserved ejection fraction.

- 2. Management of acute HF is largely based on clinical evidence of hypoperfusion or congestion and their combination: Diuretics and vasodilators are often chosen to relieve congestive symptoms. Inotropic agents, such as dobutamine and dopamine, should be considered in patients with low CO syndrome resulting in hypoperfusion, hypotension, and end-organ damage.
- 3. Cardiogenic shock: vasopressors, such as NE, high-dose dopamine, and high-dose epinephrine, should be reserved for patients with persistent hypotension, especially in the management of cardiogenic shock when persistent hypoperfusion is evident despite optimization of filling pressures.
- 4. Drugs for chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction: neurohormonal modulation targeting adrenergic, renin–angiotensin– aldosterone and NP systems has become the cornerstone of medical therapy in patients with chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction. β-Βlockers, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, MRAs, and angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors have been shown to improve outcomes and are recommended, unless contraindicated or not tolerated. The combination of nitrates and hydralazine is also a useful adjunct in self-identified blacks, while ivabradine and digoxin should be considered in select patients who remain symptomatic despite standard therapy. The SGLT-2 inhibitors, such as dapagliflozin, have demonstrated improved outcomes irrespective of underlying diabetes mellitus.
- 5. Associated conditions in chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction: therapeutic anticoagulation is the mainstay of risk reduction strategies in patients with HF and atrial fibrillation or a history of systemic or pulmonary emboli. Amiodarone is the ideal antiarrhythmic drug for rhythm control strategy and may improve the success of electrical cardioversion. Intravenous iron supplementation might be reasonable in subjects with iron deficiency, while erythropoiesis-stimulating agents are associated with an excess of thromboembolic events and should be avoided. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are generally safe and well tolerated, with modest improvements in clinical outcomes.
- 6. Drugs for chronic HF with preserved ejection fraction: at least half of all patients with HF have preserved ejection fraction. No treatment has yet been shown to reduce morbidity in this population. Large randomized clinical trials had conflicting or neutral results. Since these patients are often elderly with a poor quality of life, an important aim of therapy may be to alleviate symptoms and improve well-being.
- 7. Reverse cardiac remodeling: advances in medical and device therapies have demonstrated the capacity of the heart to reverse

- harmful remodeling. For many patients with reverse remodeling, improvement in cardiac function following treatment does not reflect complete recovery, but rather reflects remission, which requires indefinite continuation of therapy. Thus, withdrawal of treatment should not be attempted routinely in this population.
- 8. Drugs for selected cardiomyopathies: specific therapies for certain cardiomyopathies may differ according to underlying disease. Tafamidis, a transthyretin stabilizer, was associated with reductions in mortality and hospitalizations in patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy. Preliminary data have suggested a potential benefit from prolactin blockade with bromocriptine in patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy. Corticosteroids are considered the mainstay of therapy for autoimmune cardiomyopathic syndromes, such as cardiac sarcoidosis and eosinophilic endocarditis. Antiparasitic therapy with benznidazole is recommended for acute, congenital, and reactivated Chagas disease, but its role in the chronic phase of Chagas cardiomyopathy remains controversial. For pediatric patients with lysosomal storage diseases, enzyme replacement is indicated and has been shown to produce substantial clinical benefit.
