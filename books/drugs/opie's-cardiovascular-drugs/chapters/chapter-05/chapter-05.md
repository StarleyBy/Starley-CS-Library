# **Drugs for Obesity**

BENJAMIN M. SCIRICA

# **Drug Class Overview and Guidelines**

Obesity is a worldwide societal and medical problem. The most recent estimates suggest that more than 1.9 billion people in the world are overweight (body mass index [BMI] 25–29 kg/m²) and over 650 million are obese (BMI≥30 kg/m²).¹ In the United States, over 39% of the adult population are obese and 33% are overweight, and obesity rates have doubled over the last 20 years.² Globally, rates of obesity have tripled since 1975 with most of the global population living in countries where overweight and obesity kills more people than poor nutrition. There is a well-accepted relationship between BMI and overall mortality with a steady increase in risk starting at a BMI greater than 25. It is estimated that there are between and obesity-related deaths in the United States each year and over 2.8 million deaths attributable to obesity worldwide. The costs associated with obesity are estimated to be almost \$150 billion a year in the United States alone.

There is a consensus that losing weight is important to improve health, in particular for prevention of diabetes and other obesity-related diseases such as sleep apnea, fatty liver, and polycystic ovary disease.<sup>3</sup> Even relatively small weight loss (5%–10%) will result in favorable metabolic improvements. However, it has been challenging to identify either weight loss strategies or specific medical therapies that achieve meaningful and sustained weight loss. Moreover, the history of pharmacotherapy for weight loss includes many instances of drugs that caused serious side effects and therefore limited the interest in the clinical use of pharmacotherapy for the treatment of obesity. More challenging is the fact that no study of the weight loss strategy or therapy has definitively demonstrated cardiovascular benefit. While multiple weight loss studies have improved glycemic indices or reduced cardiac risk factors, none resulted in reductions in cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization, heart failure, or cardiovascular death. The absence to date of any study demonstrating cardiovascular benefit of weight loss has raised the question whether there is truly a causal relationship between obesity and cardiovascular outcomes, or whether obesity simply exacerbates other known cardiovascular risk factors, or is just a marker of worse metabolic health.

## **Weight Loss Intervention**

The clinical challenge in choosing weight loss therapies is that the most effective weight loss strategy is bariatric surgery, which is invasive and only available to a relatively small proportion of patients. Bariatric surgery tends to be used in younger patients with fewer comorbidities but significant burden of obesity-related risks. At the other end of the therapeutic spectrum for obesity therapy are the diet and lifestyle interventions, for which there are many different programs (some with better evidence than others) but that in general attain modest weight loss that is difficult to maintain over time. Pharmacologic therapy falls in between the ends of the therapeutic spectrum but historically provided only modest weight loss at relatively high cost and with treatmentlimiting side effects. There is therefore great clinical need to bridge this spectrum by discovering more effective weight loss pharmacotherapy that can achieve greater and sustained weight loss without safety concerns and therefore expand the potential patients population that could achieve significant and sustained weight loss (Fig. 5.1).

**Fig. 5.1 Obesity treatment options.** Currently, there is a large gap between diet/lifestyle/pharmacologic therapy on the left and bariatric surgery on the right in terms of effectiveness. Ideally, on the right, pharmacologic therapy will safely achieve greater weight loss and expand treatment options.

#### **Historical and Regulatory Perspective**

The past several decades unfortunately witnessed several notable failures among pharmacologic weight loss therapy. In 1997, the combination pill fenfluramine—phentermine, a nonselective serotonin agonist, was found to increase the risk of valvulopathy and pulmonary hypertension after a relatively short treatment duration, leading to its removal from the market. Rimonabant, a cannabinoid antagonist, received approval for use in Europe. A large randomized study subsequently demonstrated an unacceptable increase in neuropsychiatric side effects that led to its withdrawal. Another drug, Sibutramine, a sympathomimetic, facilitates weight loss; however, in a randomized trial, it increased myocardial infarction and stroke. A full list of drugs withdrawn or not approved in the United States is presented in Table 5.1.4

Based on this history, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provided new guidance for the industry developing products for weight management, which required that to achieve approval, a drug must first demonstrate efficacy for weight loss, defined as both greater than or equal to 5% weight loss compared to placebo, and that the proprotion of patients who achieve at least 5% weight loss must be overall greater than 35% and twice the rate of placebo. In addition, the FDA required that any new agent must demonstrate cardiovascular safety through a post-marketing cardiovascular outcome trial, where the trial must exclude an excess risk defined by a noninferiority boundary of the upper amount of the 95% confidence interval (CI) <1.4 for a composite major adverse cardiovascular endpoint. As in the diabetes area, this guidance has dramatically changed the development programs for obesity-related medications.

#### **Guidelines**

Weight loss treatment must be multimodal and address underlying medical, behavioral, and lifestyle conditions that can often prevent adequate and sustained weight loss. Guidelines recommend that all obese and overweight patients receive lifestyle therapy (reduced-calorie healthy meal plan/physical activity/behavioral interventions). For all obese patients (BMI  $\geq$  30 kg/m²) and those overweight patients (BMI  $\geq$  25 kg/m²) with adiposity-related complications, weight loss medications are recommended if lifestyle therapy does not achieve adequate weight loss. Bariatric surgery is recommended for those overweight and obese patients with at least one severe complication.  $^{6.9}$

# Pathophysiology and Mechanism of Action

The pathophysiology of obesity is a complex lifelong interplay between genetic, societal, cultural, behavioral, psychological, and medical factors, to name just a few, that result in the final heterogeneous manifestation of excess weight gain. The simplest calculation for obesity is the relationship between energy (caloric) intake and energy expenditure. However, each side of this balance becomes much more complicated based on nutritional content, central signaling, metabolic set points, and hormonal variations. Fig. 5.2 provides a broad overview of energy balance together with potential areas for prevention. In general, one can tilt this scale by blocking food uptake, suppressing appetite, increasing metabolism, or altering adiposity signaling.

### **Centrally Acting Drugs**

Centrally acting drugs affect a variety of pathways within the hypothalamus. Fig. 5.3 reviews the complex interplay between anorexigenic (loss of appetite) and orexigenic (appetite stimulant) signaling in the key areas such as the nucleus accumbens neuron, the dorsal vagal complex, paraventricular nucleus, lateral hypothalamic area, and the arcuate nucleus. Different therapeutic

agents will inhibit orexigenic or augment anorexigenic pathways, but the redundancy in the different pathways highlights why single agents are often ineffective in achieving significant weight loss.

## Lifestyle and Diet Interventions

ifestyle and diet can typically achieve a clinically relevant 5% to 10% weight loss, though it requires dedicated interventions to activate and sustain patients over time. Current guidelines recommend that a program have at least 14 direct patient–provider interventions to activate and sustain a patient in a program of calorie-reduced diet, increased exercise, and physical activity as well as the behavioral support. Most patients will achieve the greatest weight loss over the first 6 months; however, sustaining long-term weight loss is challenging and generally requires increased physical activity4,7,8

Schematic depiction of the regions of the brain involved in regulation of appetite and energy expenditure, showing the sites of action of US Food and Drug Administration-approved anti-obesity drugs. Red text indicates anti-obesity drugs. The primary brain region involved in the regulation of energy balance is the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. The dorsal vagal complex in the brainstem receives input from the vagus nerve. Several drugs modulate the activity of pro-opiomelanocortin neurons in the arcuate nucleus and in areas of the hypothalamus and other regions of the brain with the overall effect of reducing food intake and increasing energy expenditure. GLP-1 is made in the intestine and seems to act on vagal afferents, the brainstem, and also the hypothalamus. The nucleus accumbens is involved in rewarding aspects of food intake and responds to neural signals, including those regulating homoeostatic feeding to alter the perception of reward associated with food stimuli.

Several studies have evaluated the intermediate to long-term effect of diet and lifestyle on cardiovascular outcomes. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) randomized 3234 patients with impaired glucose tolerance and a mean baseline BMI of 34 kg/m² to placebo, metformin, or a lifestyle-modification program that included a goal of at least 7% weight loss and 150 minutes of physical activity per week. Over an average of 2.8 years of follow-up, the incidence of diabetes was 11.0, 7.8, and 4.8 cases per 100 person-years in the placebo, metformin, and the lifestyle groups, respectively. The lifestyle intervention was significantly more effective than metformin for preventing diabetes, though both strategies were superior to placebo. <sup>10</sup> After 15 years of follow-up, the incidences of diabetes were 55%, 56%, and 62%, respectively, though there was no difference in the aggregate rates of microvascular disease. <sup>11</sup>

One of the most rigorous lifestyle intervention study, the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) Study, randomized 5145 obese or overweight patients with type 2 diabetes to either an intensive lifestyle intervention or a control group report that received education only. 12 Over a median follow-up of almost 10 years, the intervention group achieved greater weight loss (8.6% versus 0.7% at 1 year; 6% versus 3.5% at study end), and had greater reductions in glycemic indices; however, much of this early benefit deteriorated over the subsequent years such that the early improvement was attenuated by year 3. There was no corresponding effect on the primary outcome of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke or hospitalization for angina (hazard ratio [HR] 0.95; 95% CI 0.83–1.09; P=0.51). Unfortunately, much of the early benefit in terms of weight loss, reductions in waist circumference, and improved physical fitness deteriorated after the first year such that one cannot tell if the absence of cardiovascular benefit was because weight loss does not affect cardiovascular events or if weight loss was not sustained sufficiently to assess benefit.

The longest follow-up of a randomized lifestyle and diet intervention is from the Da Qing Study, which started in 1986 in China. Five hundred seventy-seven adults with impaired glucose tolerance were randomized to either control or one of three interventions (diet, exercise, or diet plus exercise). The latest update is now 30 years from the start of the study, with 94% follow-up. The combined intervention group had a median delay of diabetes by 3.96 years, and fewer cardiovascular events (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.59–0.92, P=0.006), cardiovascular deaths (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.48–0.94; P=0.022), and all-cause deaths (0.74, 95% CI 0.61–0.89; P=0.0015), and an average increase in life expectancy of 1.44 years (95% CI 0.20–2.68; P=0.023) (Fig. 5.4).  $^{13}$ 

Lifestyle and diet will always be the cornerstone of the management of weight loss and a key component to an overall healthy

life, but multiple studies demonstrate that this alone is unlikely to meaningfully alter the major complications associated with obesity. Economic, societal, and regulatory interventions that encourage and support large populations to eat more healthily and increase overall physical activity are likely the only methods by which population-level weight loss management can be achieved and sustained, in particular among the younger population.

### **Bariatric Surgery and Medical Devices**

The two most common surgical interventions for weight loss are sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is the most effective weight loss therapy available, with up to 40% of weight loss at 1 year and sustained weight loss of over 25% by 5 years. The weight loss with sleeve gastrectomy is slightly less than Roux-en-Y, but still achieves up to 30% weight loss at 1 year and 20% over 5 years. Sleeve gastrectomy is a less complex surgery than the Roux-en-Y, with fewer complications, and therefore is performed more commonly.

There has been one randomized trial of bariatric surgery versus medical therapy together with several large observational studies. The Surgical Treatment and Medications Potentially Eradicate Diabetes Efficiently (STAMPEDE) study randomized 150 patients with diabetes to receive either intensive medical therapy alone or medical therapy plus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy. The primary outcome of the study was an achieved glycated hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1c) of less than 6% with or without the use of diabetes medications. After 5 years of follow-up only 2% of the medical therapy group achieved the primary endpoint compared to 29% of patients who had gastric bypass and 23% with sleeve gastrectomy. The absolute reduction in hemoglobin A1c was 2.1% with surgery versus 0.3% with medical therapy (P=0.003). Gastric bypass surgery resulted in the greatest weight loss (23.3 kg), followed by sleeve gastrectomy (18.6 kg), which was much more than medical therapy alone (5.3 kg, P<0.05 for all comparisons). <sup>14</sup> This study was not powered for clinical outcomes and the cardiovascular event rates were low; however, the favorable metabolic effects of sustained weight loss are clinically impressive.

Two large observational studies have reported an association between bariatric surgery and lower risk of cardiovascular events. The Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study was a prospective nonrandomized study of 4047 subjects who underwent either bariatric surgery or conventional standard of care. Over 15 years of follow-up, patients in the surgical group had 16% more weight loss, 78% lower risk of developing incident diabetes, a 33% lower risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke, and a 24% lower risk of all-cause mortality. <sup>15,16</sup> Another observational study, a cohort study of 2287 patients who underwent surgery and controls matched for diabetes and BMI, found that metabolic surgery was associated with almost 15% weight loss and more than 1% absolute reduction in hemoglobin A1c, 41% reduction in all-cause mortality,

and a 62% reduction in the risk of heart failure. <sup>17</sup> Despite the large numbers and extended follow-up, the studies were observational and cannot prove a causal association between surgery and outcomes. Bariatric surgery should be considered in obese patients with diabetes and is recommended in most guidelines for appropriate patients because of the improvement in glycemic indices, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and overall quality of life metrics.

There are several medical devices approved for the treatment of obesity that achieve weight loss through different mechanisms, including intragastric balloons, neural stimulation systems to increase satiety, and external drainage systems. These tend to lead to weight loss of less than 10% compared to placebo and have a variety of complications depending on the actual device. <sup>18</sup>

### **Pharmacologic Therapy**

Pharmacotherapy should be considered for either obese patients (BMI>30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) or overweight patients (BMI>25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) with a weight-related comorbidity such as diabetes, fatty liver, or sleep apnea. Unfortunately, there are very few head-to-head studies of weight loss drugs so that determining which agent is the most "effective" remains a clinical challenge. Moreover, most weight loss studies are performed in relatively young and healthy populations, are often not more than a year in duration, and are plagued by high rates of drug discontinuation (either due to lack of weight loss or side effects). In practice, if a patient does not achieve at least a 5% weight loss by 12 weeks, then they are unlikely to benefit from longer-term treatment. Pharmacotherapy has only been studied in addition to diet and lifestyle modification. Because obesity is a heterogeneous disease with multiple underlying pathophysiologic axes, individual patients may respond differently based on the drugs' mechanism of action. Thus it is common for patients to cycle through several different classes of agents to identify the most effective.

#### **Orlistat**

Orlistat inhibits gastric and pancreatic lipases, thus preventing fat hydrolysis and absorption and increasing fecal fat excretion. With a normal diet, orlistat inhibits the absorption of 25% to 30% of the calories from fat. The 1-year placebo-subtracted weight loss with orlistat is only about 3%, but in one randomized trial of 3304 obese or overweight patients, orlistat reduced the incidence of diabetes after 4 years (6.2% with orlistat versus 9% in the placebo). In another study of 892 subjects, orlistat 120 mg three times daily led to an 8 mg/dL reduction in fasting low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels compared to placebo. Patients must take multivitamins to compensate for the malabsorption of fat-soluble

vitamins. While there are no systemic side effects of orlistat because it is not absorbed, its mechanism of action will lead to fecal urgency, incontinence, and flatus, which often limits adherence. Oxalate-induced acute kidney injury has also been reported with orlistat and may be due to the binding of intraintestinal calcium leading to higher oxalate absorption.

#### Sympathomimetic Drugs

Sympathomimetic drugs induce weight loss by promoting early satiety through increased norepinephrine release or inhibiting its reuptake in the central nerve terminals that signal satiety in the hypothalamus. Because these drugs are all related to amphetamines, they also increase blood pressure and heart rate. There are four sympathomimetic drugs approved by the FDA for the short-term treatment (12 weeks) of obesity: phentermine, diethylpropion, benzphetamine, and phendimetrazine. Sibutramine, another sympathomimetic drug that also blocks serotonin reuptake, was withdrawn from the market because of the higher risk of myocardial infarction and stroke, despite promoting weight loss.<sup>21</sup> Long-term use of sympathomimetic drugs is discouraged because of side effects and potential for abuse. Phentermine is by far the most commonly prescribed drug in this class, and overall is the most commonly used weight loss drug in the United States. In short-term randomized control trials, phentermine 30 mg/day led to about 4% to 6% weight loss relative to placebo. In addition to increase in heart rate and blood pressure, this class of drugs can cause insomnia, nervousness, and dry mouth.

### Phentermine/Topiramate

In 2012, the FDA approved a combination capsule of phentermine and the extended-release antileptic drug topiramate for obese patients with a BMI>30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or with a BMI> 27 kg/m<sup>2</sup> with at least one weight-related comorbidity. Topiramate, an inhibitor of sodium and calcium channels that also inhibits the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), was noted to facilitate weight loss in other disease areas. In several dedicated weight loss studies, this combination appeared to be the most potent oral obesity therapy on the market, with placebo-subtracted 1-year weight loss from 8.6% to 9.3%. The CONQUER study randomized 2487 patients to placebo or the combination phentermine/topiramate for 56 weeks. <sup>22</sup> A total of 70% of patients in the higher-dose group achieved a 5% weight loss compared to 62% in the lower-dose group and 21% in the placebo group. The corresponding rates for 10% weight loss at 56 weeks were 48%, 37%, and 7%, respectively (Fig. 5.5). The most common side effects were dry mouth, constipation, insomnia,

and dizziness. Because of the sympathomimetic actions of phentermine, this combination increases heart rate and should be used cautiously in patients with established cardiovascular disease or hypertension. This combination is contraindicated in pregnancy because of an increased risk of cleft palate for infants exposed during the first trimester. Women of childbearing age are required to have a pregnancy test before starting and monthly thereafter. The drug should be prescribed within a Risk Evaluation and Medication Strategy (REMS), which requires formal training and certification for physicians and pharmacies.

#### Lorcaserin

Lorcaserin is a selective serotonin (5HT) C2 receptor agonist. It was approved in 2012 for the treatment of obesity in addition to a reduced calorie diet and exercise. In contrast to nonselective serotonergic agonists such as fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine, lorcaserin is highly selective for the 2C receptor, which is centrally located in the hypothalamus, as compared with the 2A and 2B receptors, which are present on cardiac valves which is thought to be the mechanism by which fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine precipitate valve disease and pulmonary hypertension.

Lorcaserin was evaluated in three dedicated weight loss randomized trials in patients with and without diabetes. In the Behavioral Modification and Lorcaserin for Overweight and Obesity Management (BLOOM) Study, 3182 obese or overweight subjects were randomized either to lorcaserin 10 mg twice daily or placebo. At 1 year 47.5% of the patients on lorcaserin and 23.3% of patients on placebo lost 5% or more body weight, which corresponded to an average loss of 5.8 kg for lorcaserin and 2.2 kg for placebo. There was no evidence of cardiac valvulopathy in 2472 patients with serial echocardiograms at 1 year and in 1127 patients at 2 years.<sup>23</sup> The BLOSSOM study randomized 4008 obese or overweight patients to lorcaserin twice daily, lorcaserin once daily, or placebo. More patients treated with lorcaserin achieved at least 5% weight loss compared to placebo (47.2%, 40.2%, and 25%, P < 0.001). The corresponding rates for at least 10% weight loss were 22.6%, 17.4%, and 9.7% (P<0.001). There was no evidence of an excess in FDAdefined valvulopathy with lorcaserin compared to placebo.<sup>24</sup> In a dedicated study of 604 patients with diabetes (BLOOM-DM) there was a 4.5% weight loss with lorcaserin 10 mg twice daily. 5.0% weight loss with lorcaserin once daily, and 1.5% with placebo (P < 0.001 for each). Corresponding reductions in hemoglobin Alc were 0.9%, 1.0%, and 0.4% (P < 0.001 for each).<sup>25</sup>

Lorcaserin is to date the only obesity drug to fulfill the FDA guidance for excluding excess of cardiovascular risk. The

Incidence is assessed in patients with prediabetes at baseline according to the intention-to-treat method. *HR*, Hazard ratio (From Bohula EA, Scirica BM, Inzucchi SE, et al. Effect of lorcaserin on prevention and remission of type 2 diabetes in overweight and obese patients (CAMELLIA-TIMI 61): a randomised, placebocontrolled trial. *Lancet* 2018;392: 2269–2279.)

CAMELLIA–TIMI 61 study randomized obese or overweight patients with established cardiovascular disease, or diabetes with other cardiovascular risk factors, to lorcaserin 10 mg twice daily or placebo. 26 The primary safety endpoint was the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. The coprimary efficacy endpoints were an expanded clinical endpoint that included cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, unstable angina, or coronary revascularization; and the incidence of type 2 diabetes in patients with prediabetes. At 12 months, there was a net weight difference of 2.8 kg between arms of the study. This led to a significant reduction in the incidence of diabetes in patients with prediabetes (8.5% versus 10.3%, HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.66–0.99, P=0.038) (Fig. 5.6). <sup>26</sup> Lorcaserin fulfilled the primary safety endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.85–1.14. P for noninferiority < 0.001), but did not demonstrate superiority for the expanded cardiovascular endpoint (12.8% in lorcaserin versus 13.3% in placebo, HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87–1.07, P=0.55). Lorcaserin also reduced the primary composite renal

end point, which included a combination of new or worsening albuminuria and evidence of other renal dysfunction (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79–0.96, P=0.006). In February 2020, the FDA requested that the manufacturer of lorcaserin voluntarily withdraw the weight loss drug from the U.S. market because a safety clinical trial shows an increased occurrence of cancer (462 patients [7.7%] with diagnosis of cancer in the lorcaserin group vs. 423 patients [7.1%] in placebo).

#### Naltrexone/Bupropion

The combination of naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, and bupropion, a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor and nicotinic receptor antagonist, was approved by the FDA in 2014 for the management of obesity. The Contrave Obesity Research I (COR-I) study randomized 1742 patients to two doses of naltrexone/bupropion versus placebo. <sup>28</sup> Only 50% of patients actually completed the 56 weeks of treatment. The main change in body weight was -1.3% for placebo, -6.1% for the high-dose combination group, and -5.0% for the low-dose combination group. A total of 16% of patients in the placebo group had a body weight decrease of 5% or more compared to 48% in the high-dose and 39% in the low-dose treatment arms (Fig. 5.7). The most common side effects were nausea, headaches, constipation, dizziness, vomiting, and dry mouth. There was also transient increase in systolic blood pressure by 1.5 mmHg.

Naltrexone/bupropion was evaluated in the LIGHT Study, a cardiovascular outcome trial that randomized 8910 patients to placebo or naltrexone/bupropion. Almost one-third of the patients had established cardiovascular disease and the majority had type 2 diabetes. The trial was adequately powered to exclude the FDAmandated upper bound of the 95% CI of 1.4 for a composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Unfortunately, during the trial, unblinded interim data was released publicly and thus compromised the scientific integrity of the study requiring its early termination. In the final analysis, the early benefit of active therapy noted after only 25% of the events attenuated to no treatment difference by the time the trial was completed. The rate of discontinuation of study drug exceeded 60% of the patients by 26 weeks, further compromising the scientific integrity of the study.<sup>29</sup> Because of these fundamental breaches of trial integrity. the FDA mandated that a new trial be performed, though it is unclear whether this will ever happen.

#### Glucose-Like Peptide (GLP)-1 Receptor Agonist

plus bupropion

GLP-1 is an incretin hormone secreted by the intestinal neuroendocrine L cells in response to food, and stimulates glucose-dependent insulin secretion. GLP-1 has a variety of actions in addition to increasing insulin release, including inhibition of glucagon release, slowing gastric emptying, decreasing central appetite satiety, and increasing heart rate. Several different GLP-1 receptor agonists are approved for the treatment of diabetes as daily or once-weekly injectable formulations, and most recently as a daily pill. Among the GLP-1 receptor agonists approved for diabetes, several (liraglutide, dulaglutide, semaglutide, and albiglutide) have been shown to reduce cardiovascular events, specifically cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke, in cardiovascular outcome trials of patients with diabetes. 30 Among GLP-1 receptor agonists, the degree of weight loss appears to be both drug and dose dependent, with some agents appearing to be more potent than others in terms of weight loss and hemoglobin A1c reduction in patients with diabetes.

One GLP-1 receptor agonist, liraglutide, has been approved for the treatment of obesity in patients with and without diabetes using a higher dose than used in the treatment of diabetes. The SCALE trial randomized 3731 overweight or obese patients without diabetes for 56 weeks to either liraglutide 3.0 mg daily or placebo. Liraglutide reduced weight by a placebo-subtracted reduction 5.6 kg and lowered blood pressure by 2.8 mmHg. More than 63% of patients in the liraglutide group lost at least 5% of body weight compared to 27.1% in placebo, with rates of 33.1% versus 10.6%, respectively, for >10% weight loss.<sup>31</sup>

The SCALE Diabetes trial randomized three regimens in addition to low-calorie diet—the 3.0 mg daily obesity dose, the 1.8 mg daily obesity dose, or placebo—in 846 patients with diabetes. Achieved weight loss was 6.0% with 3.0 mg, 4.7% with 1.8 mg, and 2.0% with placebo, resulting in estimated placebo-subtracted values of 4% and 2.7% for the two dosing regimens. Weight loss of greater than 5% occurred in 54.3% with 3.0 mg, 40.4% with 1.8 mg, and 21% with placebo. The corresponding numbers for 10% weight loss were 25.2%, 15.9%, and 6.7%. In general across several weight loss agents, patient with diabetes tend to achieve less weight loss than those patients without diabetes.<sup>32</sup>

In the SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes study, 2254 patients were randomized to the obesity dose of 3 mg daily versus placebo and followed for 160 weeks. After 3 years of follow-up, liraglutide reduced the incidence of diabetes by almost 80% (HR 0.21, 95% CI 0.13–0.34). Almost 50% of patients treated with liraglutide had a 5% weight loss compared to 24% with placebo, 25% had a 10% weight loss compared to 10% placebo, and 11% had greater than 15% weight loss compared to just 3% in placebo (Fig. 5.8).33 The most common side effects of liraglutide (and all GLP-1 receptor agonists) are nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and vomiting.

Several other GLP-1 receptor agonists are being evaluated for the treatment of obesity. In a dose-ranging study in 957 patients with or without diabetes, increasing doses of subcutaneous semaglutide resulted in more significant weight loss than placebo or liraglutide 3.0 mg. The highest dose of semaglutide resulted in a 16.3% change in body weight compared to 7.8% with liraglutide 3.0 mg and 2.3% in placebo. There was a corresponding increase in heart rate by approximately 4 to 6 bpm and a decrease in systolic blood pressure by 4 mmHg compared to placebo (Fig. 5.9).<sup>34</sup> The potential for cardiovascular benefit of once-weekly semaglutide in patients without diabetes is being tested in the patient Semaglutide Effects on Cardiovascular Outcomes in People With Overweight or Obesity (SELECT) trial [\(ClinicalTrials.gov](http://ClinicalTrials.gov) Identifier: NCT03574597).

Liraglutide 3.0 mg and glycemic status. (A) Kaplan-Meier estimates of the proportion of participants who received a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes during the course of the trial. Glycemic status was defined according to American Diabetes Association 2010 criteria. All individuals for whom diabetes was diagnosed had prediabetes at screening, except for one in the placebo group, who had normoglycemia. The numbers along the graph lines show the cumulative number of individuals who received a diagnosis of diabetes over the course of 172 weeks. (B) Proportion of participants with prediabetes at screening who regressed to having normoglycemia during the 172 weeks. (C) Changes in fasting plasma glucose and fasting serum insulin during the 172 weeks. Changes in fasting glucose translated into a similar corresponding pattern for glycated hemoglobin changes. Data shown are the observed means with least squares mean (fasting glucose) or with 95% CI (fasting insulin).

Lancet 2018;392:637–649.)

The compound LY3298176, a dual GLP-1/gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) agonist, was tested in a phase 2 dose-ranging study in 555 patients with diabetes and a BMI between 23 and 50 kg/m<sup>2</sup> . At 26 weeks the highest dose of LY3298176 led to a weight loss of 11.3% compared to 0.4% in placebo. In comparison, the active comparator of the GLP-1 receptor agonist dulaglutide had a 2.7% weight loss. The highest dose of LY3298176 reduced hemoglobin A1c by 2.4% compared to no change in placebo (Fig. 5.10).<sup>35</sup>

# Conclusion

There are multiple weight loss agents available, all with differing mechanisms of action, degrees of efficacy for weight loss, and side effects (Table 5.2). While no agent has yet demonstrated cardiovascular benefit in obese patients without diabetes, the extensive evidence of cardiovascular benefit of GLP-1 receptor agonist in

patients with diabetes (most of whom are also obese) positions GLP-1 receptor agonists as the most clinically appealing pharmacologic weight loss option at this time, especially for patients with diabetes or at higher cardiovascular risk.
