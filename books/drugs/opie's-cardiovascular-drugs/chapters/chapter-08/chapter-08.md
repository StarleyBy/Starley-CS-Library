## Introduction

Antithrombotic therapy represents a time-tested foundation for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease that is firmly rooted in an understanding of the pathophysiology of common clinical phenotypes, including acute coronary syndrome, acute ischemic stroke, venous thromboembolic disease, stent thrombosis, heart chamber thrombosis, and mechanical device thrombosis. In each case, one or more well-delineated abnormalities present within the vasculature, circulating blood cells, plasma and its constituents associated with local conditions that affect laminar blood flow, shear stress, and biochemical events is responsible for impaired circulation and organ perfusion that can be either lifethreatening or life-altering.

The development and wide-scale availability of effective antithrombotic drugs has substantially reduced the number and severity of cardiovascular events; however, several challenges remain, including cost, wide-scale availability, consistent and evidence-based utilization by clinicians, and the potential for adverse effects such as bleeding.

This chapter is dedicated to summarizing the best available evidence on antithrombotic drugs, their mechanisms of action, unique properties, approved indications for use in cardiovascular disease, side effects, potential drug interactions, and advances in the field that may pave the way for increasingly safe, effective, and affordable agents.

## Coagulation, Thrombosis, and Hemostasis

A chapter dedicated to cardiovascular drugs and antithrombotic therapy would not be complete without a brief summary of the distinguishing characteristics of coagulation, thrombosis, and hemostasis. Coagulation is a series of biochemical events that can occur in vitro and ex vivo if the conditions can support protease assembly, thrombin generation, and fibrin formation. By contrast, thrombosis occurs primarily on cellular surfaces within the circulatory system, requires platelets and derived particles, and is the end-result of localized injury or nonbiologic materials, impaired or nonlaminar blood flow, and systemic conditions that favor either platelet activation, coagulation protease assembly, or thrombin generation. Hemostasis is a complex, physiological state that requires vascular integrity and reparative capacity, distinct platelet populations with both autocrine and equally importantly paracrine system function, and regulatory pathways to limit clotting solely and specifically where and when needed to stem blood loss (Fig. 8.1).

## Thrombosis

## Arterial Thrombosis

The clinical expression of atherosclerotic vascular disease is determined by pathologic events leading to coronary thrombosis (or thromboembolism). There are two key factors: the propensity of plaques to rupture, and the thrombogenicity of exposed plaque components. Ischemic stroke differs with a much lower

incidence of plaque rupture and more commonly thrombosis *in situ*, artery-to-artery embolism and cardioembolism.

## **Thrombogenesis**

Pathologic events leading to coronary thrombosis (or thromboembolism) are the basis of clinical phenotypes. There are two key factors: the propensity of plaques to rupture, and the thrombogenicity of exposed plaque components.

The morphologic characteristics of plaques destined to rupture have been determined using necropsy and atherectomy tissue samples and show extracellular lipid and a lipid core occupying a large proportion of the overall plaque volume. The degree of cross-sectional narrowing of the vessel lumen is typically less than 50%. In addition to a large lipid core, vulnerable plaques are characterized by a thin fibrous cap and high macrophage density. Whereas individuals with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) exhibit a diversity of plaque types, most have a preponderance of one specific type (vulnerable or nonvulnerable), and patients with recurring symptoms frequently lack capacity for healing of the fibrous cap.

Under normal physiologic conditions, cellular blood components interact with the vessel wall for the purpose of vascular repair. The exposure of circulating blood to disrupted or dysfunctional surfaces initiates a series of integrated steps that give rise to the rapid deposition of platelets, erythrocytes, leukocytes, and insoluble fibrin establishing a mechanical barrier to blood loss.

Thrombosis occurring within the arterial circulatory system is composed of platelets and fibrin in a tightly packed network. By contrast, venous thrombi consist of a more loosely woven network of erythrocytes, leukocytes, and fibrin. Overall, the site, size, and composition of thrombi forming within the heart and arterial circulatory system are determined by alterations in blood flow and:

- thrombogenicity of vascular endothelial and endocardial surfaces;
- concentration and reactivity of plasma cellular protein and glycoprotein components;
- full functional capability of vascular physiologic protective mechanisms.

## **Platelet Deposition**

The role of platelets is to tether and attach to disrupted vascular surfaces and subsequently adhere firmly, activate, and aggregate to form a rapidly enlarging platelet mass. Under physiologic

conditions this sequence of events represents the primary step in hemostasis. By contrast, pathologic thrombosis is characterized by a robust and poorly regulated response to vessel wall injury that escalates to the point of circulatory compromise and impaired perfusion.

The biology of platelet deposition involves several processes:

- platelet attachment to collagen or exposed surface adhesive proteins;
- · platelet activation and intracellular signaling;
- the expression of platelet receptors for adhesive proteins;
- platelet aggregation; and platelet recruitment mediated by thrombin, thromboxane A<sub>2</sub>, adenosine diphosphate, and other mediators.

## **Platelet Response Capacity**

Platelets play an essential role in sensing and responding to perturbations in the blood and vasculature. Their reaction to environmental cues has both local and systemic consequences. As purveyors of the vascular space, they transmit information locally and systemically. Platelet function is tightly regulated within the vasculature, and several factors (e.g., nitric oxide [NO], prostacyclin, and adenosine diphosphase [ADPase] activity) present on the endothelial surface<sup>3</sup> maintain them in a normally resting state (Fig. 8.2). Platelets adhere to damaged, disrupted, dysfunctional or inflamed endothelial cells, exposed subendothelial tissue and nonphysiological shear flow. 4 Local generation of thrombin and other platelet activators augments intraplatelet signaling systems. Platelets themselves respond to these and other stimuli by secreting prothrombotic proteins from dense α-granules and by changing their shape through rearrangement of the cytoskeletal network. Secretion of prothrombotic proteins and signaling elicit a second wave of platelet activation and inside-out signaling to alter the configuration of integrins on the platelet surface and assume a high affinity state. Activation of integrin αIIbβ3 and subsequent binding of fibrinogen that bridges adjacent platelets is essential for platelet aggregation.<sup>5</sup>

## **Activation of Coagulation Proteases**

Thrombin is generated rapidly in response to vascular injury. It also plays a central role in platelet recruitment and formation of an insoluble fibrin network. The thrombotic process is localized, amplified, and modulated by a series of biochemical reactions driven by the reversible binding of circulating proteins (coagulation proteases)

to damaged vascular cells, elements of exposed subendothelial connective tissue (especially collagen), platelets (which express tissue factor (TF)-containing microparticles and receptor sites for coagulation proteases), and macrophages. These events lead to an assembly of enzyme complexes that increase local concentrations of procoagulant material; in this way, a relatively minor initiating stimulus can be greatly amplified to yield a thrombus (see Fig. 8.1).

#### **Coagulation on Cellular Surfaces**

A cell-based model of coagulation underscores the importance of TF-bearing cells and activated platelets serving as a scaffold for procoagulant proteins to assemble and ultimately form a localized fibrin clot. In this integrated model system, coagulation occurs in three overlapping stages: 1) *initiation*, *amplification*, and *propagation* (Fig. 8.3). *Initiation* occurs primarily after exposure of the TF/VIIa complex at a site of vascular injury. This complex activates localized human Factor (F)X, which then combines with FVa to form the prothrombinase complex and generate a small amount of thrombin; 2) Thrombin then primes the system for rapid *amplification* by activating platelets, FXI, FVIII, and additional FV; 3) In

Fig. 8.2, cont'd Schematic representation of contemporary platelet biogenesis and activation. Megakaryocytes derived from myeloid stem cells give rise to platelets. Several factors present or released from endothelial cells, including nitric oxide (NO), prostacyclin, and ADPase, act to keep circulating platelets in a resting state. Platelets are initially activated by several triggers, including (but not limited to) adhesion to collagen via glycoprotein VI (GPVI) and the  $\alpha$ 2 $\beta$ 1 integrin, von Willebrand factor (*vWF*) binding to GPIβ-IX-V complex, and generation of thrombin at or near the platelet surface that signals through protease-activated receptors (PAR). These pathways elicit downstream activation of phospholipase C (PLC) isoforms to generate second messengers inositol, 5triphosphate (not shown) and 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG), which in turn, link to pathways that drive secretion of alpha granule contents including prothrombotic proteins fibrinogen (Fg) and vWF, as well as the secretion of dense granules to release a number of soluble platelet agonists such as ADP and serotonin. Activation is reinforced by secreted ADP acting on P2Y1 and P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptors, as well as the activation of the thromboxane receptor (TP) from thromboxane A2 (TXA2) generated from arachidonic acid (AA) released during the initial wave of platelet activation. Platelet aggregation occurs through Fg-mediated integrin αllbβ3 interactions with adjacent activated platelets. ADP, Adenosine diphosphate. (Modified from Becker RC, Sexton T, Smyth SA.

Fig. 8.3 The cell-based model of coagulation describes an interaction between procoagulant surfaces and proteases essential for coagulation. Coagulation occurs on the surface of tissue factor (TF)-bearing cells and activated platelets in three overlapping steps: initiation of the pathway follows FVIIa binding to exposed TF, provoking the generation of a small amount of thrombin; thrombin then activates other coagulation proteases and platelets, facilitating coagulation protease assembly in the priming phase of coagulation and; the surface of activated platelets serves as the biological template for a burst of thrombin generation, with resulting thrombus propagation. vWF, von Willebrand factor.

the propagation stage, activated FIX, generated through both FXIa and TF/VIIa, combines with FVIIIa to form the tenase complex and generate FX on the platelet surface. Subsequent formation of the prothrombinase complex provokes a burst of thrombin, converting fibrinogen to stable fibrin monomers, which then polymerize and are covalently stabilized by FXIIIa.

#### Contact and Intrinsic Pathway-Mediated Coagulation

The contact system includes FXII, FXI, kallikrein, and high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK) and participates actively in inflammation (FXII, kallikrein, HMWK) and coagulation (FXII, FXI). The contact system is activated following exposure of FXII to a number of anionic surfaces, generating activated FXII (FXIIa) that triggers the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, beginning with FXI and followed by factors IX and VIII. Although it was previously believed that all coagulation factors play a similar role in hemostasis and thrombosis, evidence points to differing functions for FXI and FXII.

![](_page_7_Figure_2.jpeg)

Fig. 8.4 The contact-based model of coagulation plays a fundamental role for the interface of coagulation, immunity and inflammation.

Specifically, the contact activation proteins contribute to pathologic thrombus formation without being actively involved in normal hemostasis (Fig. 8.4).

## Human FXI

Human FXI is a 160-kDa serine protease glycoprotein that circulates as a homodimer of two identical 80 kDa polypeptides.7 Each individual polypeptide consists of a 35-kDa C-terminal light chain containing the catalytic domain, and an N-terminal 45 kDa heavy chain carrying four approximately 90 amino acid tandem repeats termed apple domains. The apple domains of FXI facilitate binding to other proteins: A1 contains binding sites to HMWK and thrombin, A3 to FIX, heparin, and glycoprotein Ibα (GP1bα), and A4 to FXI and FXII.8 Early observations revealed that FXI could be activated by thrombin as well as FXIIa and suggested that this route of bioamplification was favored in vivo over FXII-mediated activation.9 Subsequent experiments revealed that FXI-mediated activation of thrombin was essential for continued thrombin generation in the presence of low levels of TF, but not when higher levels of TF were present. In addition, the GP1bα receptor on the surface of platelets contains binding sites for FXII, thrombin, and FXI, bringing these proteins into close proximity on the platelet surface and allowing FXI to be activated and subsequently activate FIX in the presence of calcium ions, amplifying coagulation and thrombin generation.10

The effect of FXI concentration on thrombin kinetics varies widely among individuals,<sup>11</sup> likely reflecting the several unique functional characteristics of the protease and mirroring the variable bleeding phenotype seen in FXI-deficient patients. Even with severe FXI deficiency, tenase complexes can form via the extrinsic TF/VIIa complex and, in turn, lead to the formation of prothrombinase complexes on the platelet surface. In most instances, decreasing FXI concentrations steadily slow the rate of thrombin generation without affecting the total amount of thrombin formed. In a cell-based model system, as little as 5% of normal plasma levels of FXI led to some thrombin generation, with a maximal amount of thrombin generated at 50% of normal FXI levels.

The in vivo evidence suggests strongly that FXI contributes to fibrin formation and platelet activation, stabilizing occlusive thrombi under high-flow conditions. This differs from its participation in hemostasis, in which FXI-driven fibrin formation is not needed to prevent blood loss following vascular injury in most tissues;<sup>12</sup> however, it likely participates with major breaches of vascular integrity as encountered during complex surgery and severe trauma.<sup>13</sup>

## Human FXII

Human FXII is an 80-kDa glycoprotein consisting of an enzymatic light chain and a heavy chain comprised of several conserved domains that mediate binding to negatively charged surfaces and other proteins.<sup>14</sup> These domains include common structural elements found in several coagulant and fibrinolytic proteins, such as fibronectin type I and II, two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, and a kringle domain.<sup>14</sup>

FXII can be slowly autoactivated by binding to a negatively charged surface, such as kaolin or dextran sulfate, and initiate the contact activation pathway by activating FXI and the intrinsic pathway of coagulation or activating plasma prekallikrein and facilitating inflammatory responses.<sup>15</sup> A search for the primary (or dominant) activator in vivo has been challenging, as a number of negatively charged substances, such as polyphosphates, nucleic acids, sulfatides, fatty acids, protein aggregates, and activated platelets, have each been found to activate FXII in vitro.<sup>16</sup> The absence of FXII and FXI protect against polyphosphate-triggered thrombosis in animal models, suggesting that polyphosphate released from platelets activates the intrinsic pathway to exert its procoagulant effect. The distinct properties of proteins within the contact system has generated interest in drug development. <sup>17-19</sup>

#### **Venous Thrombosis**

Venous thrombi are characterized by layers of fibrin, platelets, red cells, and leukocytes and develop under conditions of stasis, lowered oxygen tension, oxidative stress, proinflammatory gene upregulation, and impaired endothelial-cell regulatory capacity. Although the relative proportion of platelets is low, they play a pivotal role by releasing polyphosphates, microparticles, and proinflammatory mediators and by interacting with neutrophils to generate DNA-histone-granule constituent complexes. These nuclear materials induce platelet adhesion, activation, and aggregation; the expression of factors V and Va and von Willebrand factor; prothrombinase assembly; and thrombin generation.

#### **Artificial Nonbiological Surfaces and Prosthetic Materials**

Several hundred years ago William Hewson made a landmark observation regarding the inherent thrombogenicity of artificial surfaces: he found that human blood remained in a fluid state for hours when contained within an isolated peripheral vein segment but clotted almost immediately when it was allowed to drain into a bowl. Subsequent experiments with glass, rubber, polymers, and other materials suggested that the thrombogenic properties of artificial surfaces differed widely according to surface topography, critical surface tension, chemistry, and physical structure. It has become increasingly clear, however, that the *surface* and bulk *interior* of an artificial material may be substantially different because of nonhomogeneity, contamination, or environmental exposure. The relationship between surface chemistry, physical structure, platelet activation, and coagulation is dynamic and complex.

### **Systemic and Local Influences**

#### Plasma Proteins

In general, positively charged surfaces favor thrombus formation whereas negatively charged surfaces are comparatively resistant to thrombus formation. Although these properties may reflect the normally negative charge of vascular endothelial cells, surface elements, circulating blood components, and plasma proteins likely

play an important role as well.22 Artificial surfaces with a net positive charge are highly adsorptive of plasma proteins (and blood cells), all of which have a negative charge of physiologic importance. The diffusive mobility and concentration of plasma proteins exceed those of platelets, which suggests that artificial surfaces are probably coated with proteins before platelets adhere and form a confluent monolayer. Electron microscopy has shown that a thin film of plasma components (primarily proteins) develops within several seconds on all artificial surfaces exposed to whole blood. As a result, it seems likely that the composition, concentration, and conformational characteristics of surface-bound protein molecules initially determine the thrombogenicity of the underlying artificial material.<sup>23</sup>

Fibrinogen, a prominent plasma protein readily available in high concentrations, is the first protein adsorbed to an artificial surface exposed to blood. Depending on the orientation of the molecules (either standing "on end" or horizontal in tightly packed layers), the surface concentration of fibrinogen may exceed that found normally in plasma by 100-fold,<sup>24</sup> and experimental evidence supports a direct role for surface-bound fibrinogen in determining relative thrombogenicity. The adsorption of other plasma proteins—including von Willebrand factor, fibronectin, and thrombospondin, as well as circulating coagulation factors—also contributes but predominantly in a secondary capacity.

The initial adsorption of plasma proteins to an artificial surface is often followed by a period of "prothrombosis," which may be followed by a relative state of thromboresistance. This metamorphosis, often referred to as "passivation," varies according to physical and chemical alterations of the surface proteins, their electrostatic potential, and perhaps most important an intrinsic capacity or inherent propensity to interact with platelets and coagulation factors.<sup>25</sup>

## Platelets

Platelet adherence to artificial surfaces is an early event that follows the adsorption of plasma proteins.<sup>26</sup> The presence of fibrinogen in high concentrations facilitates platelet aggregation, but only after activation has taken place. Interestingly, despite the common occurrence of platelet adhesion and surface monolayer development, not all materials promote or support platelet aggregates. The process of platelet activation is determined, as with plasma proteins, by surface properties including physical characteristics, electrical charge, and surface chemistry. In vivo, surface conditions (shear stress and surface tension) exert an important effect on platelet behavior through erythrocytes—a rich source of adenosine diphosphate (ADP). High-shear states, in addition to promoting interactions between plasma protein and artificial surfaces, can damage erythrocyte membranes (lysis), causing the release of ADP, a potent platelet agonist.<sup>27</sup> The process of platelet deposition involves six steps: platelet attachment, platelet adhesion, platelet activation, the expression of platelet receptors for adhesive proteins, platelet aggregation, and platelet recruitment.

## Coagulation

Artificial surfaces, particularly those carrying a negative charge, are capable of activating factors XII and XI and prekallikrein, initiating contact activation of the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Activation of the contact system is initiated by the binding of FXII to a negatively charged surface where "autoactivation" to an active serine protease occurs.<sup>28</sup> A small concentration of FXIIa leads to activation of its substrates—prekallikrein, FXI, and HMWK. Although prekallikrein and FXI can bind directly to artificial surfaces, activation of these enzymes does not occur in the absence of HMWK. In turn, adsorption of HMWK requires FXIIa-underscoring the importance of contact activation and its inhibition in the early stages of exposure of prosthetic materials to circulating blood.

## Emerging Construct and Future Targets for Antithrombotic Therapy Platelets and Neutrophil Extracellular Traps

In response to strong stimulation, neutrophils release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that consist of DNA and histones in a process that involves histone citrullination by peptidylarginine deiminase-4, chromatin unwinding, breakdown of nuclear membranes, and cytolysis.<sup>29</sup> A key function of the extracellular chromatin material is to entrap and confine microbes to promote their destruction.

Platelets can trigger NET formation and may also bind to histones to form platelet-NET attachments (Fig. 8.5). Von Willebrand factor is believed to be a linker molecule for binding of NETs to areas of vascular injury (Fig. 8.6). Histones activate platelets through toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent mechanisms to generate the release of polyphosphates,<sup>30</sup> which, in turn, amplify coagulation. Platelet–neutrophil interactions facilitate NET formation.

## Cardiovascular Drug Therapy

The management of atherothrombotic vascular disease involving the coronary, cerebral, and peripheral vascular beds includes a broad array of antithrombotic agents. It is important for clinicians in the field of cardiology to be familiar with these commonly used agents, their mechanisms of action, pharmacology, adverse effects, drug interactions, and evidence-based use in patient care.

## Platelet-Directed Therapies

The pivotal role of platelets in thrombosis provides a biology-based platform for targeted approaches to drug development, clinical trial testing, and employment in patient care (Table 8.1).

## Aspirin

Aspirin has been available for over a century and represents a mainstay both in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic vascular events including stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), pulmonary arterial disease (PAD), and sudden death. Accordingly, a majority of patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease will receive aspirin.

## Pharmacodynamics

Aspirin irreversibly acetylates cyclooxygenase (COX), impairing prostaglandin metabolism and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) synthesis. As a result, platelet aggregation in response to collagen, ADP, thrombin (in low concentrations), and TXA2 is attenuated.<sup>31</sup> Because aspirin more selectively inhibits COX-1 activity (found predominantly in platelets) than COX-2 activity (expressed in tissues following an inflammatory stimulus), its ability to prevent platelet aggregation is seen at relatively low doses, compared with the drug's potential antiinflammatory effects, which require much higher doses.32

## Pharmacokinetics

Aspirin is rapidly absorbed in the proximal gastrointestinal (GI) tract (stomach, duodenum), achieving peak serum levels within 15–20 minutes and platelet inhibition within 40–60 minutes of oral administration. Enteric-coated preparations are less well absorbed, causing an observed delay in peak serum levels and platelet

inhibition to 60 and 90 minutes, respectively. The antiplatelet effect occurs even before acetylsalicylic acid is detectable in peripheral blood, probably from platelet exposure in the portal circulation.

The plasma concentration of aspirin decays rapidly with a circulating half-life of approximately 20 minutes. Despite the drug's rapid clearance, platelet inhibition persists for the platelet's life span (7 2 days) due to aspirin's irreversible inactivation of COX-1. Because 10% of circulating platelets of circulating platelets are replaced every 24 hours, platelet activity returns toward normal (50% activity) within 5 to 6 days of the last aspirin dose.<sup>33</sup>

## Adverse Effects

The adverse-effect profile of aspirin in general and its associated risk for major hemorrhage (GI, urologic, intracranial) in particular are determined largely by: dose; duration of administration; associated structural (peptic ulcer disease, Helicobacter pylori infection) defects; hemostatic (inherited, acquired) abnormalities; concomitant use of other antithrombotic agents; and concomitant medical conditions or invasive procedures, including surgery. Enteric coating of aspirin may lessen dyspepsia, but it does not reduce the likelihood of adverse effects involving the GI tract. Patients with gastric erosions or peptic ulcer disease who require treatment with aspirin should concomitantly receive a proton pump inhibitor to minimize the risk of hemorrhage. An aspirin allergy, while not common, can occur with angioedema or overt anaphylaxis.

### Clinical Experience

Aspirin's beneficial effect is determined by a disease, condition, or clinical scenario–based absolute risk of vascular events. Patients at low risk (healthy individuals without predisposing risk factors for vascular disease) derive minimal benefit (see next section on primary prevention), while those at high risk (acute coronary syndrome, prior MI or percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] stroke) derive considerable benefit.<sup>34</sup> A risk-based approach to aspirin administration is recommended to avoid subjecting individuals who are unlikely to benefit from aspirin administration to its potential adverse effects.

## Primary Prevention of Vascular Events

Aspirin has been used for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic coronary vascular disease (ASCVD) for decades; however, additional information afforded by randomized clinical trials has changed the paradigm for clinicians and patients.

In the ASPREE (Aspirin and Cancer Prevention in the Elderly) study, men and women greater than 70 years of age or older (>65 years in African Americans or Hispanic Americans) who did not have a history of cardiovascular disease, dementia or disability received either aspirin 100 mg or placebo daily. After a median of 4.7 years of follow-up, the composite rate of death, dementia or persistent physical disability did not differ between groups. The prespecified secondary endpoint of fatal and nonfatal MI, fatal or nonfatal stroke, including intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) or hospitalization for heart failure was 10.7 events per 1000 patientyears in the aspirin group and 11.3 events per 1000 person-years in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.95; 95% CI, 0.83–1.08; P = ns). A major adverse cardiovascular event, defined as a composite of fatal coronary heart disease, nonfatal MI, or fatal or nonfatal stroke occurred in 7.8 per 1000 person-years and 8.8 per 1000 persons years, respectively (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77-1.03, P = ns). The major hemorrhage rate was 8.6 events per 1000 person-years and 6.2 events per 1000 person-years, respectively (HR 1.38; 95% CI 1.18–1.62;  $P \le 0.001$ ). 35

In the ASCEND<sup>36</sup> study, adults with diabetes mellitus without known cardiovascular disease were randomly assigned to either aspirin 100 mg daily or matching placebo. During a median follow-up of 7.4 years, serious vascular events occurred in 8.5% and 9.6% of patients, respectively (rate ratio [RR] 0.88; 95% CI, 0.79–0.97; P=0.01). By contrast, major bleeding events occurred in 4.1% and 3.2% of patients, respectively (RR 1.29; 95% CI, 1.09–1.52; P=0.003).

The benefit-to-risk ratio for aspirin at a dose of 75–100 mg daily becomes favorable with a 10-year ASCVD risk  $\geq$ 10%; however, bleeding risk must be considered carefully (e.g., history of peptic ulcer disease, thrombocytopenia, heritable or acquired hemostatic disorders). Aspirin in the primary prevention of MI and stroke should also be considered in patients who have not achieved optimal control of ASCVD risk factors. Prophylactic aspirin in adults  $\geq$ 70 years of age is not recommended. Last, the potential benefit of aspirin in persons  $\leq$ 40 years of age has not been studied. There may be a role in high-risk settings, to include high calcium score as determined by coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography and uncontrolled risk factors (Table 8.2).

#### **Stable Cardiovascular Disease**

In the COMPASS study, participants with stable atherosclerotic vascular disease (coronary artery or peripheral artery) were randomly assigned to receive rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus

aspirin 100 mg once daily, rivaroxaban 5 mg twice daily or aspirin 100 mg once daily. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, or MI. The study was stopped for superiority of the rivaroxaban plus aspirin group after a mean follow-up of 23 months. The primary outcome occurred in fewer patients in the rivaroxaban plus aspirin group than in the aspirin alone group (4.1% versus 5.4%; HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.66–0.86; P < 0.001);<sup>38</sup> however, there was a higher rate of major bleeding (3.1% versus 1.9%; HR 1.70, 95% CI 1.40–2.05; P < 0.001). There was no difference in either intracranial or fatal bleeding between groups. All-cause death was lower in the rivaroxaban plus aspirin group when compared with the aspirin alone group. Participants receiving rivaroxaban alone did not benefit compared to those treated with aspirin alone, but major bleeding rates were higher.

Additional analysis of the COMPASS study revealed a particularly marked effect of combined rivaroxaban and aspirin for the prevention of primary and secondary stroke.<sup>39</sup> Ischemic/uncertain strokes were reduced by nearly half as was the occurrence of fatal and disabling stroke. Independent predictors of stroke included prior stroke, hypertension, increased systolic blood pressure at baseline, age, diabetes mellitus, and Asian ethnicity. Prior stroke was the strongest predictor of incident stroke with a HR of 3.63.

#### **Secondary Prevention of Vascular Events**

The Antiplatelet Trialists Collaboration, <sup>40</sup> based on a comprehensive evaluation of existing data, provides convincing evidence in support of aspirin's ability to prevent vascular events (vascular death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke) in a wide variety of high-risk patients. Antiplatelet therapy (predominantly aspirin therapy) reduces nonfatal MI by approximately one-third, nonfatal stroke by one-third, and vascular death by one-quarter.

#### **Aspirin Dosing**

An updated meta-analysis of the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration provides additional information on the differential effects of aspirin dosing. 40 Among 3570 patients in three trials directly comparing aspirin (>75 mg daily versus aspirin <75 mg daily) there were significant differences in vascular events (two trials compared mg aspirin daily versus <75 mg daily and one trial compared 500–1500 mg aspirin daily versus < 75 mg daily). Considering both direct and indirect comparisons of aspirin dose, the proportional reduction in vascular events was 19% with mg daily. 26% with 160–325 mg daily and 32% with 75–150 mg daily. The effect of antiplatelet drugs other than aspirin (versus control) were assessed in 166 trials that included patients. Indirect comparisons provided no clear evidence of differences in reducing serious vascular events ( $\chi^2$  for heterogeneity between any aspirin regimen and other antiplatelet drugs = 10.8 ns). Most direct comparisons assessed the effects of replacing aspirin with another antiplatelet agent. While there remains interest in optimal dosing frequency for aspirin, particularly among individuals with diabetes mellitus, once-daily dosing is currently the standard of care.

## **Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG)**

#### **Aspirin Before CABG**

In the ATACAS study, \$^{41}\$ 2100 patients scheduled to undergo CABG received either aspirin 100 mg or placebo preoperatively. The primary outcome was a composite of death and thrombotic complications (nonfatal MI, stroke, pulmonary embolism [PE], renal failure or bowel infarction) within 30 days of surgery. The primary outcome occurred in 19.3% and 20.4% of patients, respectively (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.12; P=0.55). Major hemorrhage rates did not differ between groups. There are several limitations to the study that require consideration. The investigators chose to use an enteric-coated aspirin preparation that is known to have delayed absorption and peak effect. \$^{42}\$ Patients participating in the

"Continuing versus Stopping Aspirin" study were given a 100-mg enteric-coated aspirin 1–2 hours prior to surgery. Based on the well-known pharmacokinetics of aspirin, there is a high likelihood that there was not sufficient time to reach maximum concentration (Cmax) and maximum platelet inhibition prior to the start of the surgery. Once surgery begins and the patient is placed on cardiopulmonary bypass, local concentrations and related pharmacodynamics effects, i.e., at coronary sites of plaque of newly placed bypass conduits, would be quite low. This study had a higher than expected rate of MI in both groups. The ATACAS investigators speculate that this was the end-result of closer monitoring and increased troponin surveillance, i.e., higher detection rate. Could this actually be because aspirin was stopped in many patients at least 4 days prior to surgery, leading to a higher risk of complications? By stopping aspirin early, there could have also been patients who were excluded from participating in the study if they experienced a coronary event in the interim before CABG. This would have biased the outcomes. Perhaps there is a separate take-home message that applies to some high-risk patients: aspirin should not be stopped prior to CABG.

A number of clinical trials have been conducted to determine the effectiveness of antiplatelet therapy in preventing early (10 days) and late (6–12 months) saphenous vein graft occlusion. Ten of the trials investigated aspirin doses ranging from 100 mg to 975 mg daily. Several also evaluated patients receiving internal mammary artery coronary bypass grafts.43 Considered collectively, and aided by the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration overview, the data show improved saphenous vein graft patency with aspirin administration. Although a direct benefit on internal mammary bypass graft patency has not been established, treatment is recommended given the common coexistence of vascular disease (and the risk for thrombotic events).

#### Percutaneous Coronary Intervention

PCI, including plain old balloon angioplasty (POB), rotational atherectomy, and laser angioplasty, with or without stent placement, is associated with vascular injury, atheromatous plaque disruption, platelet activation, and coronary thromboembolism. Several studies have documented reduced periprocedural complications, including thrombus formation, abrupt closure, and MI, with antiplatelet therapy given prior to PCI (relative risk reduction [RRR], 60%).<sup>44</sup> The current recommendations for PCI include aspirin 81–325 mg prior to PCI and 81–325 mg daily after PCI for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. For patients unable to tolerate aspirin, pretreatment with clopidogrel (600 mg oral loading dose) followed by 75 mg daily is suggested.

#### **Peripheral Artery Disease**

Although proven to reduce cardiovascular mortality in CAD, there are modest data evaluating the efficacy of aspirin in patients with PAD. The 2002 Antiplatelet Trialists' meta-analysis demonstrated a significant 23% odds reduction in ischemic events when antiplatelet agents were compared to placebo. Two-thirds of the trials included in the meta-analysis evaluated agents other than aspirin. Since that time, three randomized, controlled trials have evaluated aspirin versus placebo in patients with PAD. Two of these studies enrolled asymptomatic patients with ABI < 0.99 and 0.95, respectively, and failed to show a benefit from aspirin use. 45 The third trial, the Critical Leg Ischemia Prevention Study (CLIPS), enrolled patients with either symptomatic PAD or ABI < 0.85 and demonstrated a risk reduction in cardiovascular and vascular ischemic events of 64% in patients randomized to aspirin. 46 By contrast, a 2009 meta-analysis of aspirin therapy in patients with PAD showed no significant change in cardiovascular events, all-cause mortality, or cardiovascular mortality. 47 The current recommendations from the AHA/ACC are as follows: antiplatelet therapy with aspirin alone (75-325 mg per day) or clopidogrel alone (75 mg per day) is recommended to reduce MI, stroke and vascular death in patients with symptomatic PAD (level IA).48

#### Left Ventricular Assist Device

Low-dose aspirin is *not* routinely discontinued prior to left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation; however, if it is, restarting is suggested postoperatively on day 2 or 3 and continued indefinitely unless bleeding occurs. The recommended aspirin dose for the HeartMate II is 81–325 mg daily, while a dose of 325 mg daily is recommended for the HeartWare LVAD.

#### Aspirin Response Variability

Aspirin's ability to inhibit platelet aggregation is variable and influenced by the population studied, conditions, and the methodology employed. <sup>52</sup> Laboratory response can also be affected by concomitant administration of Ibuprofen and by acute illness. <sup>53</sup> Given that there appears to be little or no variability in the level of COX-1-dependent platelet aggregation among patients compliant with recommended doses of aspirin, much of the variability in aspirin response is believed to be due to biological variability and heritability of COX-1-independent ADP, collagen, and epinephrine responses. <sup>54</sup>

The COX-2 enzyme prevalent in inflammatory cells may play a role in aspirin response variability.<sup>55</sup> Specifically, pharmacogenomic analyses have shown associations between polymorphisms

in PTGS2, the gene encoding COX-2, and the efficacy of aspirinmediated reduction in thromboxane B<sub>2</sub> production.<sup>55</sup>

The most convincing data supporting genetic determination of aspirin response variability exists for the Pl<sup>A</sup> polymorphism of the ITGB3 gene encoding GPIIIa. GPIIIa is pivotal for platelet binding of fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, fibronectin, and vitronectin. Carriers of Pl<sup>A2</sup> are more resistant to the antithrombotic effect of aspirin than carriers of Pl<sup>A1</sup>, and multiple studies have suggested a heightened increased risk of MI, cerebral vascular events, and venous thrombosis. Despite several interesting observations, the findings of multiple studies on the effect of Pl<sup>A</sup> polymorphisms have been divergent and several meta-analyses have drawn different conclusions. <sup>56</sup>

#### Clinical Impact of Aspirin Response Variability

Despite its proven benefit, aspirin does have inherent limitations, and the evidence compiled over several decades shows that patients receiving aspirin can still experience cardiovascular events. Although multiple studies and meta-analyses have documented increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients defined as in vitro nonresponders, <sup>57,58</sup> other studies have demonstrated no difference in clinical outcomes based on in vitro aspirin responsiveness or based on genetic polymorphisms associated with in vitro resistance. As a result, routine platelet function testing is not recommended.

### **Drug Therapy After Peripheral Artery Revascularization**

In contrast to the data for aspirin administration in asymptomatic PAD, there are data supporting its use as adjuvant therapy following lower extremity bypass. In a meta-analysis, the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration 40 demonstrated an odds reduction of 43% for the prevention of vascular occlusion with aspirin therapy compared to placebo. The analysis consisted primarily of patients who had undergone lower extremity bypass; however, two studies did assess the usefulness of aspirin as adjuvant therapy in patients undergoing lower extremity angioplasty. A subsequent randomized trial and two Cochrane systematic reviews support a more robust effect for aspirin in prosthetic grafts than in autologous conduits. 59

Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), often with stent insertion, is a common treatment approach for patients with aorto-iliac and superficial femoral artery obstructive disease. An early Cochrane review supported aspirin, 50–330 mg daily either with or without dipyridamole, initiated before femoro-politeal

endovascular treatment, as an effective and safe strategy to reduce reocclusion at 6 and 12 months as compared to placebo or VKA. The ACCF/AHA guidelines give aspirin a class I indication for patients undergoing lower extremity revascularization, either bypass grafting or endovascular intervention.

Based on the beneficial effect of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel for preventing coronary stent thrombosis, there has been significant interest in the effect of DAPT after lower extremity PTA with stenting. Ticlopidine has been shown to reduce loss of vessel patency (odds ratio [OR] 0.53; 95% CI 0.33–0.85) and amputation (OR 0.29; 95% CI 0.08–1.01). A strategy of aspirin plus clopidogrel for 24 hours *before* and 4 weeks *after* endovascular procedures has become a common approach to the reduction of acute and subacute thrombotic complications after endovascular procedures.

The clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid in bypass surgery for peripheral artery disease (CASPAR) trial randomized patients to either clopidogrel plus aspirin or placebo plus aspirin with a primary composite outcome of graft occlusion, revascularization, above ankle amputation or death. There was a nonsignificant difference in the primary endpoint in the overall population and venous graft subgroups; however, in the prosthetic graft subgroup, aspirin plus clopidogrel significantly reduced the primary endpoint (HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.45–0.95; P=0.025) without an increase in severe bleeding. <sup>62</sup> As a result, the ACCF/AHA guidelines give DAPT a class Ilb (may be considered) recommendation in patients previously revascularized who are at high risk for ischemic events.

#### **Venous Thromboembolism**

Becattini and colleagues reported a marked reduction in recurrent venous thromboembolism among 402 carefully selected patients with unprovoked events who were randomly assigned to either aspirin (100 mg daily) or placebo and were followed for 2 years (recurrence rate per year, 6.6% versus 11.2%; HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36–0.93). The adverse-event profile accompanying aspirin treatment was acceptable to most patients and physicians. A majority of the recurrences of venous thromboembolism occurred in the absence of known risk factors; death attributed to PE was infrequent, and major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was rare.

#### Contraindications to Aspirin

The major contraindications are aspirin intolerance, recent GI bleeding, active or recurring peptic ulcer, other potential sources of GI or genitourinary bleeding, and anaphylaxis. The risk of aspirin-induced GI bleeding is increased by alcohol, corticosteroid

therapy, and nonsteroid antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Hemophilia (A, B, or C) is not an absolute contraindication to aspirin when there are strong cardiovascular indications; however, working closely with the patient and a hematology specialist is suggested.

### Drug Interactions With Aspirin

Concurrent warfarin and aspirin therapy increases the risk of bleeding, especially with an aspirin dose above 75 mg daily. Among NSAIDs, those with dominant COX-1 activity (e.g., ibuprofen and naproxen), but not those with dominant COX-2 activity (e.g., diclofenac), may interfere with the cardioprotective effects of aspirin. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and aspirin have potentially opposing effects on renal hemodynamics, with aspirin inhibiting and ACE inhibitors promoting the formation of vasodilatory prostaglandins. Phenobarbital, phenytoin, and rifampin decrease the efficacy of aspirin through induction of the hepatic enzymes metabolizing aspirin. The effect of oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin may be enhanced by aspirin.

### Aggrenox

#### Pharmacodynamics

The dipyridamole component of aggrenox and cilostazol, both phosphodiesterase inhibitors, is used predominantly in patients with peripheral vascular and cerebrovascular disease. Aggrenox is a combination platelet antagonist that includes aspirin (25 mg) and dipridamole (200 mg extended-release preparation). It is typically taken twice daily. Aspirin's mechanism of action has been discussed previously. Dipyridamole inhibits cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-phosphodiesterase (PDE) and cyclic-3', 5'-GMP-PDE.<sup>63</sup> Dipyridamole inhibits platelet aggregation by two mechanisms. First, it attenuates adenosine uptake into platelets (as well as endothelial cells and erythrocytes). The resulting increase elicits a rise in cellular adenylate cyclase concentrations, resulting in elevated cAMP levels, which inhibit platelet activation to several stimuli, including ADP, collagen, and platelet-activating factor. Dipyridamole also inhibits PDE. The subsequent increase in cAMP elevates nitric oxide concentration, facilitating platelet inhibitory potential.<sup>64</sup>

#### Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetic profile of aspirin has been summarized previously. Peak dipyridamole levels in plasma are achieved within several hours of oral administration (400 mg dose of Aggrenox). Extensive metabolism via conjugation with glucuronic acid occurs in the liver. There are no significant pharmacokinetic interactions between aspirin and dipyridamole coadministered as Aggrenox.

#### **Adverse Effects**

The European Stroke Prevention Study-2<sup>65</sup> (ESPS) reported that 79.9% of patients experienced at least one on-treatment adverse event. The most common side effects were GI complaints and headache. Dipyridamole has vasodilatory effects and should be used with caution in patients with severe CAD in whom episodes of angina pectoris may increase. Patients receiving Aggrenox should not be given adenosine for myocardial perfusion studies.

#### **Administration in Older Patients**

Plasma concentrations of dipyridamole are approximately 40% higher in patients greater than 65 years of age compared with younger individuals.

#### **Clinical Experience**

Aggrenox has not been studied in patients with ACS. The European Stroke Study (ESPS)- $2^{65,66}$  included 6602 patients with ischemic stroke (76% of the total population) or transient ischemic attack who were randomized to receive aggrenox, dipyridamole alone, aspirin alone, or placebo. Aggrenox reduced the risk of stroke by 22.1% compared with aspirin and by 24.4% compared with dipyridamole. Both differences were statistically significant (P=0.008 and P=0.002, respectively).

Aggrenox is not considered inter changeable with its individual components, particularly aspirin, which may be required in larger doses among patients with CAD. In addition, the vasodilatory effects of dipyridamole can cause coronary "steal" and angina pectoris. Accordingly, Aggrenox should be used cautiously, if at all, in the setting of advanced CAD.

#### Cilostazol

#### **Pharmacodynamics**

Cilostazol, a guinolinone derivative, and several of its metabolites inhibit phosphodiesterase III activity and suppress cAMP degradation with a resultant increase in cAMP in platelets and blood vessels, leading to inhibition of platelet aggregation and vasodilation, respectively. <sup>66</sup> Increasing cAMP concentrations within endothelial cells causes vasodilation, whereas elevated levels in platelets impair their ability to aggregate.

#### Pharmacokinetics

Cilostazol is well absorbed after oral administration, particularly when given with a high-fat meal. Metabolism occurs via the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes, and most of the metabolites are excreted in the urine (75% of overall clearance). One of the two active metabolites is responsible for more than 50% of PDE III inhibition. Pharmacokinetics are approximately dose proportional. Cilostazol and its active metabolites have apparent elimination half-lives of about 11 to 13 hours. Cilostazol and its active metabolites accumulate about twofold with chronic administration and reach steady state blood levels within a few days.

#### Adverse Effects

The most common adverse effect associated with cilostazol administration is headache. Other relatively frequent causes of drug discontinuation include palpitations and diarrhea. Several PDE III inhibitors have been associated with decreased survival in patients with class III/IV congestive heart failure. Cilostazol is contraindicated in patients with heart failure of any severity. Cilostazol and several of its metabolites are inhibitors of phosphodiesterase III. Several drugs with this pharmacologic effect have caused decreased survival compared to placebo in patients with class III–IV heart failure.

#### Use in Older Patients

The clearance of cilostazol (and its metabolites) has not been determined in patients older than age 65.

#### Use in Patients With Renal Insufficiency

Moderate-to-severe renal impairment increases cilostazol metabolite levels and alters protein binding of the parent compound. Patients with advanced renal insufficiency have not been studied.

### Drug Interactions

#### Aspirin

Short-term (less than or equal to 4 days) coadministration of aspirin with Cilostazol increased the inhibition of ADP-induced ex vivo platelet aggregation by 22% to 37% when compared to either aspirin or Cilostazol alone. Short-term (less than or equal to 4 days) coadministration of aspirin with Cilostazol increased the inhibition of arachidonic acid-induced ex vivo platelet aggregation by 20% compared to Cilostazol alone and by 48% compared to aspirin alone.

#### **Clinical Experience**

Cilostazol is approved for the treatment of intermittent claudication. Across seven clinical trials, the improvement in walking distance (compared with placebo) was approximately 30 meters. <sup>67</sup> Although there is experience with cilostazol after coronary arterial stenting, its long-term administration to patients with CAD has not been studied. Short-term coadministration with aspirin reduced ADP-mediated platelet aggregation by 30% to 40% (compared with aspirin alone). The CILostazol-based triple antiplatelet therapy ON ischemic complication after drug-eluting stenT implantation trial (CILON-T) randomized 960 patients to DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel versus aspirin and clopidogrel plus 6 months of cilostazol. While the addition of cilostazol resulted in a reduction in platelet reactivity at 6 months  $(201.7 \pm 87.9 \text{ platelet reactivity units versus } 255.7 \pm 73.7 \text{ PRU},$ P < 0.001), there was no difference in the primary endpoint of cardiac death, nonfatal MI, ischemic stroke, or target lesion revascularization (8.5 versus 9.2%, P = 0.74). Cilostazol should not be considered a substitute for aspirin or clopidogrel in patients with ACS who have concomitant peripheral artery disease.

#### Vorapaxar

Vorapaxar is a tricyclic himbacine-derived selective inhibitor of protease activated receptor (PAR-1). By inhibiting PAR-1, a thrombin receptor expressed on platelets, vorapaxar prevents thrombin-mediated platelet activation and aggregation.

#### **Pharmacodynamics**

Vorapaxar inhibits platelet aggregation through the reversible antagonism of PAR-1, also known as thrombin receptor. PARs are a family of G-protein coupled receptors highly expressed on platelets and activated by serine protease activity of thrombin to mediate thrombotic response. By blocking PAR-1 activation, vorapaxar inhibits thrombin-induced platelet aggregation and thrombin receptor agonist peptide (TRAP)-induced platelet aggregation. Vorapaxar does not inhibit platelet aggregation induced by other agonists such as ADP, collagen, or a thromboxane mimetic.

#### **Pharmacokinetics**

After oral administration, vorapaxar is rapidly absorbed and peak concentrations occur at a median tmax of 1 hour under fasting conditions. The mean absolute bioavailability is 100%. Vorapaxar is primarily eliminated as its metabolite M19 through the feces (91.5%), and partially eliminated in the urine (8.5%). It has an effective half-life of 3–4 days with an apparent terminal half-life of 8 days.

#### **Adverse Effects**

Hemorrhagic complications were observed in the two large phase III clinical trials of vorapaxar. In TRA-2P,  $^{69}$  moderate or severe bleeding occurred in 4.2% of patients who received vorapaxar and 2.5% of those who received placebo (HR 1.66; 95% CI 1.43–1.93; P<0.001). There was an increase in the rate of intracranial hemorrhage in the vorapaxar group (1.0% versus 0.5% in the placebo group, P<0.001). In TRACER,  $^{70-71}$  rates of moderate and severe bleeding were 7.2% in the vorapaxar group and 5.2% in the placebo group (HR 1.35; 95% CI 1.16–1.58; P<0.001). Intracranial hemorrhage rates were 1.1% and 0.2%, respectively (HR 3.39; 95% CI 1.78–6.45; P<0.001). The trial was stopped by the data and safety monitoring committee. Rates of nonhemorrhagic adverse events were similar in the two groups.

#### **Clinical Experience**

In the TRA-2P study, <sup>69</sup> patients who had a history of MI, ischemic stroke, or PAD were randomized to receive vorapaxar (2.5 mg daily) or matching placebo and followed for a median of 30 months. The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of death from cardiovascular causes, MI, or stroke. After 2 years, the data and safety monitoring board recommended discontinuation of the study treatment in patients with a history of stroke owing to the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. At 3 years, the primary endpoint had occurred in 1028 patients (9.3%) in the vorapaxar group and in 1176 patients (10.5%) in the placebo group (HR 0.87; 95% CI 0.80-0.94; P < 0.001). Cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, or recurrent ischemia leading to revascularization occurred in 1259 patients (11.2%) in the vorapaxar group and 1417 patients (12.4%) in the placebo group (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.82–0.95; P = 0.001). Among the 3787 patients with PAD at study entry, there was no difference in the primary outcomes between treatment groups (11.3% and 11.9%, respectively; 0.94 [0.78, 1.14]; P = 0.22).

In the TRACER study, vorapaxar was compared with placebo in patients who had ACS without ST-segment elevation. The primary endpoint was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, MI, stroke, recurrent ischemia with rehospitalization, or urgent coronary revascularization. Follow-up in the trial was terminated early after a safety review. After a median follow-up of 502 days (interquartile range, 349–667), the primary endpoint occurred in 1031 of 6473 patients receiving vorapaxar versus 1102 of 6471 patients receiving placebo (Kaplan-Meier 2-year rate, 18.5% versus 19.9%; HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.85–1.01; P = 0.07). A composite of death from cardiovascular causes, MI, or stroke occurred in

822 patients in the vorapaxar group versus 910 in the placebo group (14.7% and 16.4%, respectively; HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.81–0.98; P=0.02). Among 936 patients with PAD at study entry, there were no differences in the primary outcome between groups (HR 0.85; 95% CI 0.67–1.08).

Vorapaxar is indicated for reducing the incidence of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with a history of MI or with peripheral artery disease.

# Platelet P2Y<sub>12</sub> Receptor Antagonists

The density of  $P2Y_{12}$  receptors on the platelet surface, coupled with its active role in the platelet activation and aggregation, makes it a highly attractive target for pharmacologic inhibition (Table 8.3).

## **Ticlopidine**

Ticlopidine was the first oral platelet P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor antagonist.

#### **Pharmacodynamics**

Ticlopidine hydrochloride, after oral ingestion, interferes with platelet membrane function by inhibiting ADP-induced platelet-fibrinogen binding and subsequent platelet-to-platelet interactions. The effect on platelet function is irreversible for the life of the platelet. Ticlopidine causes a time and dose-dependent inhibition of both platelet aggregation and release of platelet granule constituents.

#### **Pharmacokinetics**

After oral administration of a single 250 mg dose, ticlopidine is rapidly absorbed with peak plasma levels occurring at approximately 2 hours after dosing and is extensively metabolized. Absorption is greater than 80%. Administration after meals results in a 20% increase in the mean area under the concentration curve (AUC) of ticlopidine. The apparent half-life of ticlopidine after a single 250 mg dose is about 12.6 hours; with repeat dosing at 250 mg BID, the terminal elimination half-life rises to 4 to 5 days. Steady-state trough values in elderly patients (mean age 70 years) are about twice those in younger volunteer populations.

Ticlopidine is metabolized extensively by the liver; only trace amounts of intact drug are detected in the urine. Following an

oral dose of radioactive ticlopidine hydrochloride administered in solution, 60% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces.

#### Adverse Effects

Ticlopidine is associated with a risk of life-threatening blood dyscrasias, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), neutropenia/agranulocytosis, and aplastic anemia. Hemorrhagic events most often effecting the GI tract can also occur.

## Clinical Experience

#### Ticlopidine

Despite limited clinical use because of side effects such as neutropenia, agranulocytosis, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, ticlopidine has been proven effective in preventing MI, stroke, and transient ischemic attack (TIA) in patients with PAD. Specifically, in the randomized, double-blind Swedish Ticlopidine Multicentre Study (STIMS), ticlopidine reduced mortality by 29.1% as compared to placebo.<sup>71</sup> Ticlopidine may also be effective in reducing the progression of femoral atherosclerosis and be beneficial in maintaining patency of peripheral bypasses.<sup>59</sup> Among patients with a prior TIA or stroke, ticlopidine should be reserved for patients who are intolerant or allergic to aspirin therapy or who have failed aspirin therapy. Safer options are available.

## Clopidogrel

#### Pharmacodynamics

Clopidogrel, a thienopyridine derivative, is a platelet antagonist that is several times more potent than ticlopidine but associated with fewer adverse effects (described below). The important role of ADP-mediated platelet activation and aggregation in atherothrombotic vascular disease has made the surface P2Y12 receptor a favored target for drug development. Clopidogrel irreversibly inhibits the binding of ADP to its platelet receptor (P2Y12) and the subsequent G-protein linked mobilization of intracellular calcium and activation of the glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa complex.72 At steady state, the average inhibition to ADP is between 40% and 60%.

### Pharmacokinetics

Clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed following oral administration with peak plasma levels of the predominant circulating metabolite occurring approximately 60 minutes later. As a prodrug, it is extensively metabolized in the liver to an active compound with a plasma elimination half-life of 7.7  $\pm$  2.3 hours. Dose-dependent inhibition of ADP-mediated platelet aggregation is observed several hours after a single oral dose of clopidogrel, with a more significant inhibition achieved with loading doses ( $\geq\!300$  mg). A 600-mg oral loading dose achieves effective platelet inhibition in 2–3 hours. Repeated doses of 75 mg clopidogrel per day (without a loading dose) inhibit aggregation with steady state being reached between day 3 and day 7.

#### **Adverse Effects and Safety**

The available information suggests that clopidogrel offers safety advantages over ticlopidine, particularly with regard to bone marrow suppression and other hematologic abnormalities. Although Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and TTP have been reported with clopidogrel, 73 their occurrence is rare.

### **Clinical Experience**

#### **Peripheral Artery Disease**

The well-documented benefit derived from platelet inhibition in patients with vascular disease, coupled with a concerning adverse-effect profile observed ticlopidine, fostered the rapid development of clopidogrel. The Clopidogrel versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk for Ischemic Events (CAPRIE) Study<sup>74</sup> randomized patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease, defined as recent stroke, MI, or PAD, to either clopidogrel 75 mg per day or aspirin 325 mg daily. Patients treated with clopidogrel (by intention-to-treat analysis) had a 5.32% annual risk of ischemic stroke, MI, or vascular death compared with 5.83% among aspirin-treated patients (RRR 8.7%; 95% CI 0.3–16.5; P = 0.043). There was no major difference in safety between treatment groups; however, a greater proportion of patients receiving aspirin had the study drug permanently discontinued because of GI hemorrhage, indigestion, nausea, or vomiting. Approximately 1 out of every 1000 patients treated with clopidogrel experienced neutropenia ( $<1.2\times10^9$ cells/L) (similar to aspirin treatment).

The trial design employed in CAPRIE was not configured to answer the important question of benefit and risk for dual platelet inhibition (aspirin plus clopidogrel). Accordingly, an additional study was undertaken. The CHARISMA (Clopidogrel for High Atherothrombotic Risk and Ischemic Stabilization, Management, and Avoidance) study<sup>75</sup> randomly assigned patients with clinically evident cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors to receive clopidogrel plus aspirin or low-dose aspirin plus placebo.

Patients were subsequently followed for a median of 28 months. Respective rates for the principal secondary endpoint, which included hospitalization for ischemic events, were 16.7% and 17.9%, respectively (relative risk 0.92; 95% CI,0.86–0.995; P=0.04). Rates of severe bleeding were 1.7% and 1.3%, respectively. Among patients with clinically evident atherothrombosis, the secondary endpoint occurred in 6.9% of patients receiving combination therapy versus 7.9% of those given aspirin alone (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.77–0.998; P=0.046). By contrast, patients with multiple risk factors (but no documented atherothrombotic disease) experienced a primary endpoint rate of 6.6% with combination therapy versus 5.5% with aspirin alone (RR 1.2; 95% CI 0.91–1.59; P=0.2). The rate of death from cardiovascular causes was higher with combination therapy (3.9% versus 2.2%, P=0.01).

On the basis of data from CHARISMA, one should conclude that the combination of clopidogrel plus aspirin is *not* more effective than aspirin alone in reducing the rate of MI, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes among patients with *stable* cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors. By contrast, benefit may be expected among individuals with symptomatic atherothrombotic disease.

#### **Coronary Arterial Stenting**

A multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, Clopidogrel Plus aspirin vs Ticlopidine Plus aspirin in Stent Patients Study (CLASSICS)<sup>77,78</sup> included 1020 patients undergoing PCI who received either aspirin (325 mg qd) plus ticlopidine (250 mg BID), aspirin plus clopidogrel (75 mg daily), or aspirin plus front-loaded clopidogrel (300 mg as an initial dose followed by 75 mg qd). Treatment was continued for 28 days after stent placement. Intravenous (IV) GPIIb/IIIa antagonists were not administered to patients enrolled in the trial. The primary safety endpoint was a composite of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, bleeding, and drug discontinuation for adverse events (noncardiac). The secondary efficacy endpoint was a composite of MI, target vessel revascularization, and cardiovascular death. The primary endpoint was reached in 9.1% of ticlopidine-treated patients, 6.3% of clopidogrel-treated patients, and 2.9% of frontloaded clopidogrel-treated patients. Early drug discontinuation occurred in 8.2%, 5.1%, and 2.0% of patients, respectively. The most common adverse events prompting drug discontinuation were allergic reactions, GI distress, and skin rashes. The secondary cardiovascular endpoint was reached by 0.9%, 1.5%, and 1.3% of patients, respectively.

The importance of adequate platelet inhibition in patients undergoing PCI was confirmed in the PCI-CURE study.  $^{78}$  A total

of 2658 patients undergoing PCI were randomized to double-blind treatment with clopidogrel or placebo (aspirin alone) for, on average, 6 days before the procedure followed by 4 weeks of open-label thienopyridine (after which study drug was resumed for 8 months). The primary endpoint (cardiovascular death, MI, or urgent target vessel revascularization within 30 days) was reached in 4.5% of clopidogrel-treated patients and 6.4% of placebo-treated patients (30% relative risk reduction). Long-term administration of clopidogrel was associated with a lower rate of death, MI, or any revascularization with no increased bleeding complications.

## Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)

#### Non-ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) and Unstable Angina

The benefit of therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel was investigated in the Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Events (CURE) trial.79 A total of patients experiencing an ACS without ST-segment elevation received clopidogrel (300 mg immediately, 75 mg daily) plus aspirin (75–325 mg daily) or aspirin alone for 3–12 months. The composite of death, MI, or stroke occurred in 9.3% and 11.4 % of patients, respectively (RR reduction 20%). In hospital refractory ischemia, congestive heart failure, and revascularization procedures were also less frequent in clopidogreltreated patients. There was a greater risk of major hemorrhage with combination therapy (3.7% versus 2.7%, RR 1.38); however, lifethreatening bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke occurred at similar rates between groups.

#### Pre-PCI Treatment, Duration of Therapy, and Clinical Benefit

The CREDO (Clopidogrel for the Reduction of Events During Observation) trial<sup>80</sup> evaluated the long-term benefit (12 months) of treatment with clopidogrel after PCI as well as the potential benefit of initiating clopidogrel with a preprocedure loading dose (both in addition to aspirin therapy). A total of 2116 patients scheduled for elective PCI were randomly assigned to receive clopidogrel (300 mg) or placebo 3 to 24 hours before PCI. All patients received aspirin (325 mg). A majority of patients had either a recent MI or unstable angina as an indication for PCI. Thereafter, all patients received clopidogrel (75 mg daily) through day 28. From day 29 through 12 months, patients in the loading dose group received clopidogrel (75 mg daily) or placebo. Both groups continued to receive standard therapy including aspirin (81–325 mg daily). Pretreatment with clopidogrel was associated with a statistically nonsignificant 18.5% RRR for the combined endpoint of death, MI or target vessel revascularization at 28 days.

To better determine the optimal dosage for clopidogrel loading, the Antiplatelet therapy for Reduction of MYocardial Damage during Angioplasty (ARMYDA-2) trial randomized patients scheduled to undergo PCI to either a 300 mg or 600 mg loading dose of clopidogrel. The 600 mg loading dose was associated with a decrease in the primary endpoint of death, MI, or target vessel revascularization (4% versus 12%, P=0.041) without a significant increase in bleeding. 81

#### **Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy After PCI**

In the DAPT study<sup>82</sup> patients were enrolled after they had undergone a coronary stent procedure in which a drug-eluting stent (DES) was placed. After 12 months of treatment with a thienopyridine drug (clopidogrel or prasugrel) and aspirin, patients were randomly assigned to continue receiving thienopyridine treatment or to receive placebo for another 18 months; all patients continued receiving aspirin. The coprimary efficacy endpoints were stent thrombosis and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (CVEs) (a composite of death, MI, or stroke) during the period from 12 to 30 months. The primary safety endpoint was moderate or severe bleeding. A total of 9961 patients were randomly assigned to continue thienopyridine treatment (most were receiving clopidogrel) or to receive placebo. Continued treatment with thienopyridine, as compared with placebo, reduced the rates of stent thrombosis (0.4% versus 1.4%, HR 0.29; 95% CI 0.17-0.48; P < 0.001) and major adverse cardiovascular and CVEs (4.3% versus 5.9%, HR 0.71; 95% CI 0.59–0.85; P < 0.001). The rate of MI was lower with thienopyridine treatment than with placebo (2.1% versus 4.1%, HR 0.47; P < 0.001). The rate of death from any cause was 2.0% in the group that continued thienopyridine therapy and 1.5% in the placebo group (HR 1.36; 95%  $\overrightarrow{CI}$  1.00–1.85;  $\overrightarrow{P}$  = 0.05). The rate of moderate or severe bleeding was increased with continued thienopyridine treatment (2.5% versus 1.6%, P = 0.001). An elevated risk of stent thrombosis and MI was observed in both groups during the 3 months after discontinuation of thienopyridine treatment. DAPT beyond 1 year after placement of a drug-eluting stent, as compared with aspirin therapy alone, significantly reduced the risks of stent thrombosis and major adverse cardiovascular and CVEs but was associated with an increased risk of bleeding.

#### Clinical Decision-Making and Dual Antiplatelet Therapy

Complex PCI is associated with higher ischemic risk, which can be mitigated by long-term DAPT. However, concomitant high bleeding risk (HBR) may also be present, making it unclear whether short or long-term DAPT should be prioritized. A study by Costa and colleagues<sup>83</sup> investigated the effects of ischemic (by PCI complexity) and bleeding (by PRECISE-DAPT [PREdicting bleeding Complications in patients undergoing stent Implantation and SubsequEnt Dual AntiPlatelet Therapy] score) risks on clinical outcomes and on the impact of DAPT duration after coronary stenting. Complex PCI was defined as  $\geq$  three stents implanted and/or > three lesions treated, bifurcation stenting, and/or stent length >60 mm. and/or chronic total occlusion revascularization. Ischemic and bleeding outcomes in high ( $\geq$ 25) or nonhigh (<25) PRECISE-DAPT strata were evaluated based on randomly allocated duration of DAPT. Among a total of patients from eight randomized trials, 3118 underwent complex PCI and experienced a higher rate of ischemic, but not bleeding, events. Long-term DAPT in non-HBR patients reduced ischemic events in both complex (absolute risk difference: -3.86%; 95% CI -7.71 to +0.06) and noncomplex PCI strata (absolute risk difference: -1.14%; 95% CI -2.26 to -0.02), but not among HBR patients, regardless of complex PCI features. The bleeding risk according to the TIMI scale was increased by long-term DAPT only in HBR patients, regardless of PCI complexity.

### ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)

The CLARITY-TIMI 28 trial<sup>84</sup> and the Clopidogrel and Metoprolol in Myocardial Infarction Trial/Second Chinese Cardiac Study (COM-MIT/CCS-2-Clopidogrel) trial suggested a role for clopidogrel in the treatment of ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI).<sup>85</sup> In the CLARITY-TIMI 28 study, addition of clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose, then 75 mg/day) to a regimen of aspirin plus thrombolysis before angiography improved infarct-related artery patency and reduced ischemic complications in patients who presented within 12 hours of onset of STEMI. The primary efficacy endpoint (a composite of infarct-related arterial occlusion [TIMI grade 0/1], death or recurrent MI before angiography) was reduced by 36% with clopidogrel, with the effect being driven predominantly by a reduction in arterial reocclusion. There was no increase in major bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.

In the COMMIT trial, patients with STEMI or bundle branch block (93%) and ST-segment depression (7%) were randomized to clopidogrel 75 mg daily or placebo in addition to

aspirin 162 mg daily and usual care. Treatment with clopidogrel was associated with a 9% (95% CI 3%–14%) reduction in death, re-infarction, or stroke (2121 [9.2%] clopidogrel versus 2310 [10.1%] placebo, P=0.002). This was accompanied by a 7% reduction in all-cause mortality (1726 [7.5%] versus 1845 [8.1%], P=0.03). Similar to CLARITY-TIMI 28, there was no increase in overall bleeding, or bleeding among patients receiving fibrinolytic therapy.

#### Clopidogrel Pharmacodynamic Response Variability

High on-treatment platelet reactivity, defined as 1) platelet reactivity index >50% by vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation (VASP –P) analysis; 2) >235 to 240 P2Y<sub>12</sub> reaction units by VerifyNow P2Y<sub>12</sub> assay; 3) >46% maximal 5 μmol/l ADP-induced aggregation; and 4) >468 arbitrary aggregation units/min in response to ADP by Multiplate analyzer has been proposed to be a predictor of outcome following PCI. The Gauging Responsiveness with a VerifyNow assay-Impact on Thrombosis and Safety (GRAVITAS)<sup>87,88</sup> trial randomized 2214 patients with high ontreatment platelet reactivity (HPR) hours after PCI with drug-eluting stents to high dose clopidogrel (600 mg initial dose, 150 mg daily thereafter) versus standard dose clopidogrel (no additional loading dose, 75 mg daily thereafter). Although high-dose clopidogrel provided a 22% absolute reduction in on-treatment platelet reactivity at 30 days (62% absolute reduction, 95% CI 59%–65% versus 40%, 95% CI 37%–43%; P < 0.001), at 6 months there was no significant difference in death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal MI, or stent thrombosis. A secondary analysis of GRAVITAS determined the relationship between on-treatment platelet reactivity and cardiovascular outcomes. On-treatment reactivity of <208 P2Y12 reaction units was associated with a significantly lower risk of the primary endpoint at 60 days (HR 0.23; 95% CI 0.05–0.98; P = 0.047) even after adjustment for other predictors of outcome. Taken together, these data suggest that on-treatment platelet reactivity does correlate with the risk of adverse cardiac events; however, multiple randomized trials have failed to translate the initial observations to routine clinical practice that includes dose adjustment based on either platelet activity or genetic polymorphisms for the CYP 2C19 gene (see section on pharmacogenomics).

# MitraClip Implantation and Transcutaneous Mitral Valve Replacement (TMVR)

The administration of periprocedural antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents for patients receiving MitraClip implantation is important for reducing the risk of stroke, systemic embolism, and

device thrombosis. However, no evidence-based guidelines have yet addressed the choice or duration of antiplatelet and anticoagulant regimens; thus current choices remain contingent on the operators' experience and discretion. Many patients undergoing MitraClip or TMVR have coexisting morbidities such as atrial fibrillation requiring anticoagution. In the EVEREST trials, a regimen of aspirin 325 mg daily for 6–12 months was used. Clopidogrel at a dose of 75 mg daily was given for 1 month.<sup>89</sup>

#### Atrial Septal Defect / Patent Foramen Ovale (ASD/PFO) Percutaneous Closure

In patients undergoing ASD/PFO closure, a postprocedural antithrombotic therapy regimen typically includes a combination of aspirin 75–325 mg daily plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily for 1–3 months followed by aspirin monotherapy for an additional 3–5 months.90,91

#### Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) Closure

The patient population for whom left atrial appendage (LAA) closure (or exclusion) is recommended has a contraindication for long-term anticoagulation due to high risk of bleeding. A brief course of DAPT post procedure is generally administered followed by long-term aspirin monotherapy. The European Heart Rhythm Society consensus recommends using DAPT for up to 6 months after device implantation in patients with contraindications to OAC.<sup>92</sup> In patients with a prohibitive risk of bleeding, a single antiplatelet agent may be reasonable.

### Prasugrel

#### Pharmacodynamics

Prasugrel, a third-generation thienopyridine P2Y12 inhibitor, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 2009 for patients with ACS undergoing PCI.

#### Pharmacokinetics

Prasugrel, a prodrug, undergoes rapid deesterification to an intermediate thiolactone, which is then converted to the active metabolite via a single CYP-dependent step. Maximal plasma concentrations of prasugrel's active metabolite are reached within 0.5 hours after oral administration.Inhibition of ADP binding to the platelet P2Y12 receptor begins 15–30 minutes after administration of a 60 mg loading dose, and a maximal 60%–70% platelet inhibition is achieved at 2–4 hours. During maintenance therapy with 10 mg daily dosing, there is a steady state of 50% platelet inhibition. After discontinuation of prasugrel, platelet aggregation returns to pretreatment levels within 7–10 days.

When compared to clopidogrel, administration of prasugrel results in earlier production and greater concentration of the equipotent active metabolites. Subsequently, prasugrel produces a more rapid onset and more consistent and greater level of platelet inhibition than clopidogrel in healthy subjects and patients with CAD. 93

#### Safety

In the Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibition with Prasugrel–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TRITON–TIMI) 38 (n = 13608), major bleeding was observed in 2.4% of patients treated with prasugrel and 1.8% of patients receiving clopidogrel (HR 1.32; 95% CI 1.03–1.68; P=0.03). Prasugrel-treated patients experienced a higher incidence of life-threatening bleeding (1.4% versus 0.9%, P=0.01) and fatal bleeding, including ICH (0.4% versus 0.1%, P=0.002). Bleeding risks were greatest in patient's  $\geq$ 75 years old, those with a history of TIA or stroke, and those weighing <60 kg. As a result, prasugrel is *contraindicated* in patients with a history of TIA or stroke, and a dosage of 5 mg daily should be considered for patients <60 kg. In patient's  $\geq$ 75 years of age, prasugrel is generally *not* recommended and should be used only after careful consideration of the potential risks and benefits.

### **Clinical Experience**

#### **Acute Coronary Syndrome**

The benefit of prasugrel in patients with ACS was demonstrated in the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial. Moderate-to high-risk ACS patients scheduled to undergo PCI were randomized to either prasugrel (60 mg loading dose and 10 mg maintenance dose) or clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose and 75 mg maintenance dose) for 6–15 months. The primary endpoint of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke was observed in 9.9% of patients receiving prasugrel and 12.1% of patients receiving clopidogrel (HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.73–0.90; P < 0.001). There was also a decrease in the secondary endpoints of MI (7.4% versus 9.7%, P < 0.001), urgent target-vessel revascularization (2.5% versus 3.7%, P < 0.001), and stent thrombosis (1.1% versus 2.4%, P < 0.001) with prasugrel versus clopidogrel. 94

## **Ticagrelor**

#### **Pharmacodynamics**

Ticagrelor is a high-affinity ADP analogue that causes *reversible* inhibition of the  $P2Y_{12}$  receptor. Unlike the thienopyridines, ticagrelor does *not* require metabolic activation or conversion for platelet inhibition; however, an active metabolite exerts an equally potent effect.

#### **Pharmacokinetics**

Ticagrelor is rapidly absorbed and undergoes enzymatic degredation to an active metabolite, which has similar pharmokinetics to the parent compound. Due to its rapid absorption, plasma concentrations of ticagrelor peak 1–3 hours after oral administration in a dose-dependent manor. This results in an average of 60%–80% inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation 2–4 hours after a 180-mg loading dose. Plasma half-life is 6–13 hours, necessitating twice-daily administration.

As compared to clopidogrel, ticagrelor administration results in earlier, more robust, and more consistent and pronounced platelet inhibition. In patients with NSTEMI previously treated with clopidogrel, ticagrelor administration provided further platelet inhibition, regardless of the patient's level of responsiveness to clopidogrel. 95

#### **Adverse Effects**

In the Study of Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO) (n = 18,624), ticagrelor plus aspirin versus clopidogrel plus aspirin was associated with a higher rate of major bleeding not related to CABG (4.5% versus 3.8%, P=0.03). Fatal bleeding did not differ between groups. There was no significant difference in the rates of overall major bleeding between ticagrelor and clopidogrel (11.6% versus 11.2%, P=0.43). There was a numerically higher incidence of ICH among patients randomized to ticagrelor plus aspirin. Based on a comprehensive post hoc analysis of the US cohort of PLATO,  $^{97}$  a boxed warning was included in FDA approval stating that the use of ticagrelor with maintenance doses of aspirin above 100 mg daily decreased its effectiveness. Thus, an aspirin dose of  $\leq$ 100 mg daily is recommended.

### **Clinical Experience**

#### **Acute Coronary Syndrome**

The benefits of ticagrelor in ACS were established in the PLATO trial. Patients were randomized to either ticagrelor (180 mg loading

dose, 90 mg twice daily thereafter) or clopidogrel (300–600 mg loading dose, 75 mg daily thereafter). At 12 months, the primary composite endpoint of death from vascular causes, MI, or stroke occurred in 9.8% of the ticagrelor group and 11.7% of the clopidogrel group (HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.77–0.92; P < 0.001). Secondary endpoints, including MI (5.8% in the ticagrelor group versus 6.9% in the clopidogrel group, P=0.005) and death from vascular causes (4.0% versus 5.1%, P=0.001), were also reduced by ticagrelor. As a result of these data, ticagrelor has a class I, level of evidence B, recommendation in patients undergoing PCI after ACS.

### Long-Term Use of Ticagrelor

In the PEGASUS study, <sup>99</sup> patients who had experienced a MI 1 to 3 years earlier were randomized to ticagrelor at a dose of 90 mg twice daily, ticagrelor at a dose of 60 mg twice daily, or placebo. All patients received low-dose aspirin and were followed for a median of 33 months. The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke. The primary safety endpoint was TIMI major bleeding. The two ticagrelor doses each reduced, as compared with placebo, the rate of the primary efficacy endpoint, with Kaplan–Meier rates at 3 years of 7.85% in the group that received 90 mg of ticagrelor twice daily, 7.77% in the group that received 60 mg of ticagrelor twice daily, and 9.04% in the placebo group (HR for 90 mg of ticagrelor versus placebo 0.85; 95% CI 0.75– 0.96; P = 0.008; HR for 60 mg of ticagrelor versus placebo 0.84; 95% CI 0.74–0.95; P = 0.004). Rates of TIMI major bleeding were higher with ticagrelor (2.60% with 90 mg and 2.30% with 60 mg) than with placebo (1.06%) (P < 0.001 for each dose versus placebo); the rates of intracranial hemorrhage or fatal bleeding in the three groups were 0.63%, 0.71%, and 0.60%, respectively.

#### **Peripheral Artery Disease**

In the EUCLID trial,  $^{100}$ patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease were randomized to receive monotherapy with ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily) or clopidogrel (75 mg once daily). Patients were eligible if they had an ABI of 0.80 or less or had undergone previous revascularization of the lower limbs. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of adjudicated cardiovascular death, MI, or ischemic stroke. The primary safety endpoint was major bleeding. The median follow-up was 30 months. The mean baseline ABI in all patients was 0.71, 76.6% of the patients had claudication, and 4.6% had critical limb ischemia. The primary efficacy endpoint occurred in 751 of 6930 patients (10.8%) receiving ticagrelor and in 740 of 6955 (10.6%) receiving clopidogrel (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.92–1.13; P=0.65). In each group, acute limb ischemia

occurred in 1.7% of the patients (HR 1.03; 95% CI 0.79–1.33; P=0.85) and major bleeding in 1.6% (HR 1.10; 95% CI 0.84–1.43; P=0.49). The routine use of ticagrelor is not supported in the management of patients with PAD.

### ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction

The efficacy of ticagrelor in the long-term post STEMI treated with fibrinolytic therapy remains uncertain. To evaluate the efficacy of ticagrelor when compared with clopidogrel in STEMI patients treated with fibrinolytic therapy, an international, multicenter, randomized, open-label with blinded endpoint adjudication trial enrolled 3799 patients (age < 75 years) with STEMI receiving fibrinolytic therapy. 101 Patients were randomized to ticagrelor (180 mg loading dose, 90 mg twice daily thereafter) or clopidogrel (300-600 mg loading dose, 75 mg daily thereafter). The key outcomes were cardiovascular mortality, MI, or stroke, and the same composite outcome with the addition of severe recurrent ischemia, transient ischemic attack, or other arterial thrombotic events at 12 months. The combined outcome of cardiovascular mortality, MI, or stroke occurred in 129 of 1913 patients (6.7%) receiving ticagrelor and in 137 of 1886 patients (7.3%) receiving clopidogrel (HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.73–1.18; P = 0.53). The composite of cardiovascular mortality, MI, stroke, severe recurrent ischemia, transient ischemic attack, or other arterial thrombotic events occurred in 153 of patients (8.0%) treated with ticagrelor and in 171 of 1886 patients (9.1%) receiving clopidogrel (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.71–1.09; P = 0.25). The rates of major, fatal, and intracranial bleeding were similar between the ticagrelor and clopidogrel groups.

#### Platelet-Directed Therapies and Coronary Stent Thrombosis

Coronary stents improve outcomes in patients undergoing PCI, particularly those with ACS. However, stent thrombosis is a largely preventable and devastating complication associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality.  $^{102}$  A majority of events occur between 0 and 30 days after PCI and the expected rate of thrombosis during this time is <1%. Late stent thrombosis, defined as thrombosis occurring greater than 30 days after PCI, occurs at a 0.2%–0.6% rate.  $^{103}$  The overall incidence of stent thrombosis is lessening with time, operator experience, and stent materials and design.

While the most common cause of stent thrombosis is nonadherence to DAPT, contributing factors include increased platelet activation, thrombin generation, and inflammation associated with ACS. Drug eluting stents (DES) impair endothelial healing, helping to attenuate in-stent restenosis while also increasing the risk of

thrombus formation. Examination of necropsy samples from patients who underwent DES insertion revealed that the ratio of nonendothelial cell covered stent struts to total struts was the best predictor of subsequent thrombosis. Despite the fact that baremetal stents (BMS) are thought to develop an endothelial cell monolayer more completely than DES, there remains no discernable difference in the rates of stent thrombosis between DES and BMS within the first 12 months after PCI.<sup>104</sup>

Stent thrombosis typically presents as STEMI and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Accordingly, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) have established guidelines regarding the use and length of antiplatelet therapy in patients with ACS following PCI (see Table 8.4). Aspirin should be continued indefinitely and a P2Y12 inhibitor should be continued for at least 1 year unless the morbidity from bleeding risk outweighs the expected benefit.

#### On-Treatment Platelet Reactivity Testing

Although the mechanisms of clopidogrel dose-response variability are not yet completely elucidated, multiple lines of evidence strongly suggest that variable active metabolite generation is the primary explanation. Variable levels of active metabolite generation following clopidogrel administration may be explained by variable intestinal absorption affected by an ABCB1 gene polymorphism, functional variability in P450 activity due to drug-todrug interactions, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of specific CYP450 genes.105 Coadministration of clopidogrel with proton pump inhibitors, lipophilic statins, and calcium channel blockers metabolized via CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 causes a diminished pharmacodynamics response to clopidogrel. Controversy remains, however, as to the clinical consequences of these interactions with respect to ischemic events.

#### High On-Treatment Platelet Reactivity and Post-PCI Events

The first prospective study demonstrating the link between HPR and ischemic events in patients treated with stents was the PRE-PARE POST-STENTING study. In this study by Gurbel et al., of 192 patients undergoing elective PCI and 300 mg loading dose of clopidogrel plus 75 mg daily maintenance dose, those patients with the highest quartile of on-treatment platelet reactivity had an OR of 2.7 for 6 month post-PCI ischemic events.<sup>106</sup> Although this study employed light transmittance aggregometry, subsequent studies have used the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay, the VASP-phosphorylation assay, and the Multiplate analyzer to demonstrate that on-treatment

platelet reactivity is an independent risk factor for ischemic events after PCI.<sup>107</sup>

In order for platelet reactivity testing to be clinically useful, optimal cutpoints or "thresholds" must be established. In a majority of prior studies, cutpoints have been determined with receiveroperating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis in patients undergoing elective PCI. Despite the use of different ischemic endpoints (CV death, MI, stent thrombosis, and urgent revascularization), studies have suggested that the optimal cutpoint for VASP-PRI testing is between 48% and 53%.<sup>108</sup> Similar studies using the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay have demonstrated that a cutoff value below 240 P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) is prognostic for thrombotic events (CV death, stent thrombosis, and nonfatal MI). While the negative predictive value for these cutoffs is high, the positive predictive value is low for all assays, likely because on-treatment platelet reactivity is not the only determinant of post-PCI ischemic events. The consistency of the platelet reactivity cutoffs determined by multiple studies suggests that there may be a threshold level of platelet reactivity below which ischemic events may be prevented.<sup>109</sup> Given the bleeding risk associated with dual antiplatelet therapy after PCI, there may be a therapeutic window for P2Y12 receptor antagonist therapy associated with both a reduction in thrombotic events and a low rate of bleeding. Although there have been no large studies that have established a "cutpoint" for gauging bleeding risk, several observational studies have reported an association between low platelet reactivity on clopidogrel and increased in-hospital bleeding after PCI.<sup>110</sup>

## Pharmacogenomics and P2Y12 Inhibitor Therapy

Studies examining in vitro metabolism of clopidogrel and clinical outcomes have noted significant unfavorable variability in the production of its active metabolite related to genetic variation in patients. As a result, the FDA added a "boxed warning" to clopidogrel suggesting methods for testing for genetic differences and suggesting potential alternative drug therapies. No recommendations were made suggesting specific clinical scenarios in which genetic testing should be undertaken.104,111

Although genetic variation in the generation of clopidogrel's active metabolite is a function of heterogeneity in intestinal absorption, hepatic CYP metabolism, and P2Y12 receptor structure, it appears that variation in the CYP2C19 appears to be the most consistent determinant of differences in response to clopidogrel.105 Twenty-five SNPs lie within the CYP2C19 gene, of which the most clinically relevant variants are CYP2C19\*2, CYP2C19\*3, and CYP2C19\*17. Of these variants, the first two account for greater than 90% of cases of poor metabolism and the third is responsible for a gain of function that results in increased metabolism. Because of the differential prevalence of certain SNPs within the nonwhite population, the prevalence of the poor metabolizer genotypes ranges from 20%–30% in white individuals, from 30%–45% in African Americans, and up to 50%–65% in East Asians.<sup>112</sup>

The genetic variability in response seen with clopidogrel does not seem to extend to the newer P2Y12 agents, prasugrel and ticagrelor. Prasugrel undergoes metabolism to its active metabolite via rapid deesterification to an intermediate, thiolactone, which is then converted to active metabolite via a single CYP-dependent step that is more uniform, rapid, and complete than clopidogrel metabolism.113 As a result, prasugrel metabolism is not subject to variation in CYP2C19.114 Similarly, ticagrelor does not require CYP-dependent metabolism, and is thought to provide more consistent inhibition of P2Y12 receptors regardless of variation in CYP2C19.115 Multiple meta-analysis have correlated CYP2C19 genotype and clinical outcomes in post-PCI patients treated with clopidogrel. In pooling several studies of between 8000 and high-risk patients, these meta-analyses reported that adverse cardiac outcomes increased by 30% and there was a twofold-higher risk of stent thrombosis per reduced function variant.116 The risk of adverse outcomes and stent thrombosis increased in a step-wise fashion with an increasing number of reduced-function alleles. The risk may be particularly high in Asian populations where CYP2C19 polymorphisms are prevalent.

TAILOR-PCI is the largest genotype-based cardiovascular clinical trial randomizing participants to conventional DAPT or prospective genotyping-guided DAPT. Enrolled patients completed surveys before and 6 months after randomization.<sup>117</sup> A total of 1327 patients completed baseline surveys of whom 28%, 29%, and 43% were from Korea, Canada, and the US, respectively. Most patients (77%) valued identifying pharmacogenetic variants; however, fewer Korean (44%) as compared with Canadian (91%) and American (89%) patients identified pharmacogenetics as being important (P < 0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, and country, those who were confident in their ability to understand genetic information were significantly more likely to value identifying pharmacogenetic variants (OR 30.0; 95% CI 20.5–43.8). Only 21% of Koreans, as opposed to 86% and 77% of patients in Canada and the United States, respectively, were confident in their ability to understand genetic information (P < 0.001).

After clinical genotyping, each institution recommended alternative antiplatelet therapy (prasugrel, ticagrelor) in PCI patients with a loss-of-function allele. Major adverse cardiovascular events

(defined as MI, stroke, or death) within 12 months of PCI were compared between patients with a loss-of-function allele prescribed clopidogrel versus alternative therapy. Risk was also compared between patients without a loss-of-function allele and loss-offunction allele carriers prescribed alternative therapy. Cox regression was performed, adjusting for group differences with inverse probability of treatment weights. Among 1815 patients, 572 (31.5%) had a loss-of-function allele. The risk for major adverse cardiovascular events was significantly higher in patients with a loss-offunction allele prescribed clopidogrel versus alternative therapy (23.4 versus 8.7 per 100 patient-years; adjusted HR 2.26; 95% CI 1.18–4.32; P = 0.013). Similar results were observed among 1210 patients with acute coronary syndromes at the time of PCI (adjusted HR 2.87; 95% CI 1.35–6.09; P = 0.013). There was no difference in major adverse cardiovascular events between patients without a loss-of-function allele and loss-of-function allele carriers prescribed alternative therapy (adjusted HR 1.14; 95% CI 0.69–1.88; P = 0.60).

## What Is the Role of Platelet Function Testing in Routine Clinical Practice?

To establish the clinical utility of platelet function testing several criteria must be met. First, there must be a reproducible and standardized assay to measure genotype or platelet function. Second, studies must consistently link specific genotypes or platelet function measures with clinical outcomes. Third, recommendations for modification of pharmacotherapy must be established, and these management strategies must be validated in appropriately powered randomized trials to demonstrate their efficacy and safety.

In the TRIGGER-PCI trial, patients with stable CAD and high ontreatment platelet reactivity (HTPR) (>208 PRUs by the VerifyNow test) after elective PCI with at least one DES were randomly assigned to either prasugrel 10 mg daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily. Platelet reactivity of the patients on the study drug was reassessed at 3 and 6 months. The study was stopped prematurely for futility because of a lower than expected incidence of the primary endpoint. 118 In 212 patients assigned to prasugrel, PRU decreased from 245 (225–273 median [interquartile range]) at baseline to 80 (42–124) at 3 months, whereas in 211 patients assigned to clopidogrel, PRU decreased from 249 (225–277) to 241 (194–275) (P < 0.001 versus prasugrel). The primary efficacy endpoint of cardiac death or MI at 6 months occurred in no patient on prasugrel versus one patient who was on clopidogrel. The primary safety endpoint of noncoronary artery bypass graft TIMI major bleeding at 6 months occurred in three patients (1.4%) on prasugrel versus one patient (0.5%) on clopidogrel.

The ARCTIC investigators randomly assigned 2440 patients scheduled for PCI to a strategy of platelet-function monitoring, with drug adjustment in patients who had a poor response to antiplatelet therapy, or to a conventional strategy without monitoring and drug adjustment. The primary endpoint was the composite of death, MI, stent thrombosis, stroke, or urgent revascularization 1 year after stent implantation. For patients in the monitoring group, the VerifyNow P2Y<sub>12</sub> and aspirin point-of-care assays were used in the catheterization laboratory before stent implantation and in the outpatient clinic 2 to 4 weeks later. 119 In the monitoring group, high platelet reactivity in patients taking clopidogrel (34.5% of patients) or aspirin (7.6%) led to the administration of an additional bolus of clopidogrel, prasugrel, or aspirin along with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors during the procedure. The primary endpoint occurred in 34.6% of the patients in the monitoring group, as compared with 31.1% of those in the conventional-treatment group (HR 1.13; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.29; P = 0.10). The main secondary endpoint, stent thrombosis or any urgent revascularization, occurred in 4.9% of the patients in the monitoring group and 4.6% of patients in the conventional-treatment group (HR 1.06; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.52; P = 0.77). The rate of major bleeding events did not differ significantly between groups.

The ANTARCTIC investigators conducted a multicenter, 120 open-label, blinded-endpoint, randomized controlled superiority study in patients aged 75 years or older who had undergone PCI for ACS to prasugrel 5 mg daily with dose or drug adjustment in case of inadequate response (monitoring group; n = 442) or oral prasugrel 5 mg daily with no monitoring or treatment adjustment (conventional group; n = 435). Platelet function testing was performed 14 days after randomization and repeated 14 days after treatment adjustment in patients in the monitoring group. The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, stent thrombosis, urgent revascularization, and Bleeding Academic Research Consortiumdefined bleeding complications (types, or 5) at 12 months' follow-up. The primary endpoint occurred in 120 (28%) patients in the monitoring group compared with 123 (28%) patients in the conventional group (HR 1.003; 95% CI 0.78–1.29; P = 0.98). Rates of bleeding events did not differ significantly between groups.

# **Deescalation of Therapy Employing Platelet Function Tests**

The (TROPICAL-ACS) trial  $^{121}$  randomized patients with successful PCI to standard treatment with prasugrel for 12 months (control group; n=1306) or a step-down regimen (1 week prasugrel

followed by 1-week clopidogrel and platelet-function test-guided maintenance therapy with clopidogrel or prasugrel from day 14 after hospital discharge; guided deescalation group; n = 1304). The primary endpoint was net clinical benefit (cardiovascular death, MI, stroke or bleeding grade 2 or higher according to Bleeding Academic Research Consortium [BARC]) criteria) 1 year after randomization (noninferiority hypothesis; margin of 30%). The primary endpoint occurred in 95 patients (7%) in the guided deescalation group and in 118 patients (9%) in the control group  $(P_{\text{noninferiority}} = 0.0004; \text{ HR } 0.81; 95\% \text{ CI } 0.62-1.06; P_{\text{superiority}} =$ 0.12). Despite early deescalation, there was no increase in the combined risk of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke in the deescalation group (32 patients [3%]) versus in the control group (42 patients [3%];  $P_{\text{noninferiority}} = 0.0115$ ). There were 64 BARC 2 or higher bleeding events (5%) in the deescalation group versus 79 events (6%) in the control group (HR 0.82; 95% CI 0.59–1.13; P = 0.23).

# Periprocedural Management of Antiplatelet Therapy

It is estimated that up to 5% of patients will require surgery within the first year after stent implantation and that up to a third of all cases of stent thrombosis occur in the perioperative setting, often as a result of discontinuation of DAPT. 122

The risk of ischemic events in the periprocedural period varies with the anatomic location of the implanted stent and the time elapsed since stent placement. As always, ischemic risk must be balanced with bleeding risk, which varies by the type and anatomic location of the procedure being performed (Fig. 8.7). The periprocedural approach to patients with CAD and prior stent placement are summarized in Tables 8.5 and 8.6.

## Periprocedural Management of Antiplatelet Therapy and Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting

Perioperative management of antiplatelet therapy in the setting of urgent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) can be challenging. An assessment of ischemic/thrombotic risk must be gauged in the context of bleeding risk (Table 8.7). The BRIDGE trial randomized 210 patients with ACS or recent coronary stent on thienopyridine to either receiving cangrelor or placebo while awaiting CABG surgery.  $^{123}$  Cangrelor administered at a dose of 0.75  $\mu g/kg/min$  was associated with a greater proportion of patients with low levels of

**Fig. 8.7** An approach to optimal management of platelet-directed therapy in patients undergoing surgery. Clopidogrel and ticagrelor should be discontinued for 5 days and prasugrel for 7 days. Start cangrelor at bridging dose regimen 3–4 days after prasugrel discontinuation and 2–3 days of clopidogrel and ticagrelor discontinuation and discontinue 1–6 hours before surgery. After surgery, prasugrel and ticagrelor administration should be discouraged and clopidogrel should be resumed with a loading dose as soon as oral administration is possible, and the risk of severe bleeding is acceptable. If the use of oral P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibiting therapy is not possible, postsurgery bridging might be considered. (Data from Rossini R, et al. A multidisciplinary approach on the perioperative antithrombotic management of patients with coronary stents undergoing surgery: surgery after stenting 2. *JACC: Cardiovascular Inter 2018*;11:417–434.)

platelet reactivity (primary endpoint) during the treatment period as compared to placebo (PRU <240, 98.8% versus 19.0%; RR = 5.2; 95% CI 3.3–8.1; P < 0.001). Excessive CABG-related bleeding occurred in 11.8% versus 10.4% of patients in the cangrelor and placebo groups, respectively (RR = 1.1; 95% CI 0.5–2.5; P = 0.763). There were no significant differences in major bleeding prior to CABG. Although this trial was not powered to assess clinical endpoints such as stent thrombosis or mortality, it does suggest that bridging therapy with cangrelor may be useful in patients on thienopyridines at high risk for coronary events while awaiting CABG.

# Periprocedural Management of Antiplatelet Therapy and GI Procedures

As for any procedure, management of antiplatelet therapy periendoscopy is dependent on accurate assessment of the risk of bleeding and the risk of adverse coronary events. There is significant variation in the reported rates of cardiopulmonary complications

Use of P2Y12receptor inhibitors is to be considered in association with aspirin (ASA).

aEvaluate creatinine clearance and type of non-vitamin <sup>K</sup> antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC).

bAs soon as possible, once adequate hemostasis has been achieved (consider bridge therapy in patients in whom resumption of full-dose anticoagulation may carry <sup>a</sup> bleeding risk that could outweigh the risk of cardioembolism).

bCollegial discussion of risk, even with family or patient.

dAs soon as possible, once adequate hemostasis has been achieved (consider bridge therapy in patients in whom resumption of full-dose anticoagulation may carry <sup>a</sup> bleeding risk that could outweigh the risk of cardioembolism). From Rossini R, et al. A multidisciplinary approach on the perioperative antithrombotic management of patients with coronary stents undergoing surgery:

associated with endoscopy. In a prospective survey of gastroscopies, the 30-day complication rate was 0.2%. Eleven patients were diagnosed with pneumonia, resulting in 8 deaths, 3 patients with fatal pulmonary emboli, and 19 patients (14 deaths) with acute MI.124 Although not optimally defined, the mechanism of cardiopulmonary complications associated with endoscopymay be related to vagal stimulation (via air insufflation of a hollow viscus), catecholamine release secondary to dehydration, anxiety, or pain, and changes in serum electrolytes secondary to colonic purgative solutions.

Johnson and colleagues performed a retrospective longitudinal analysis to assess the diagnosis, procedure, and prescription drug codes in a United States commercial claims database.125 Data from patients at increased risk (n ¼ 82,025; defined as patients with pulmonary comorbidities or cardiovascular disease requiring antithrombotic medications) were compared with data from average-risk patients. In a 1:1 matched analysis, patients at increased risk undergoing colonoscopy were compared with matched (on the basis of age, sex, and comorbidities) patients at increased risk who did not undergo colonoscopy. Cardiac, pulmonary, and neurovascular events 1–30 days after colonoscopy were determined (Fig. 8.8).

Thirty days after outpatient colonoscopy, non-GI adverse events (AEs) were significantly higher in patients taking antithrombotic medications (7.3%; OR 10.75; 95% CI 10.13–11.42) or those with pulmonary comorbidities (1.8%; OR 2.44; 95% CI 2.27–2.62) versus average-risk patients (0.7%) and in patients 60–69 years old (OR 2.21; 95% CI 2.01–2.42) or 70 years or older (OR 6.45; 95% CI 5.89– 7.06), compared with patients younger than 50 years. The 30-day incidence of non-GI AEs in patients at increased risk who underwent colonoscopy was also significantly higher than in matched patients at increased risk who did not undergo colonoscopy in the anticoagulant group (OR 2.31; 95% CI 2.01–2.65) and in the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease group (OR 1.33;95% CI 1.13–1.56).

Taking into account the risk of bleeding associated with endoscopy in patients receiving DAPT and the risk of cardiovascular events associated with cessation of antiplatelet therapy, clinicians must employ a thoughtful approach based on ischemic/thrombotic and bleeding risk.126 In most instances, antiplatelet therapy can be continued unless the risk and potential impact of bleeding is very high (e.g., neurosurgery, major trauma with active bleeding).

peptide or nonpeptide molecules that have structural similarities to fibrinogen. There are currently three IV GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonists: abciximab, tirofiban, and eptifibatide (Table 8.8).

## Abciximab

### Pharmacodynamics

Abciximab is the Fab fragment of the chimeric human-murine monoclonal antibody c7E3. IV administration of abciximab, in doses ranging from 0.15 mg/kg to 0.3 mg/kg, produces a rapid

dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation in response to ADP. At the highest dose, 80% of platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptors are occupied within 2 hours and platelet aggregation, even with 20  $\mu M$  ADP, is completely inhibited. Sustained inhibition is achieved with prolonged infusions (12–24 hours) and low-level receptor blockade is present for up to 10 days following cessation of the infusion: however, platelet inhibition during infusions beyond 24 hours has not been well characterized. Platelet aggregation in response to 5  $\mu M$  ADP returns to  $\geq \! 50\%$  of baseline within 24 hours of drug cessation.

#### **Pharmacokinetics**

Following an IV bolus, free plasma concentrations of abciximab decrease rapidly with an initial half-life of less than 10 minutes and a second-phase half-life of 30 minutes, representing rapid binding to the platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptor. Abciximab remains in the circulation for 10–14 days in a dynamic, platelet-bound state.

#### **Clinical Experience**

In the EPIC trial, <sup>127</sup> 2100 patients undergoing either balloon coronary angioplasty or atherectomy at high risk for ischemic/thrombotic complications received a bolus of abciximab (0.25 mg/kg) followed by a 12-hour continuous infusion (10 µg/min). This treatment reduced the occurrence of death, MI, or the need for an urgent intervention (repeat angioplasty, stent placement, balloon

pump insertion, or bypass grafting) by 35%. At 6 months,<sup>128</sup> the absolute difference in patients with a major ischemic event or elective revascularization was 8.1% comparing patients who received abciximab (bolus plus infusion) with those given placebo (35.1% versus 27.0%; 23% reduction). At 3 years,<sup>129</sup> the composite endpoint occurred in: 41.1% of those receiving an abciximab bolus plus infusion; 47.4% of those receiving an abciximab bolus only; and 47.2% of those receiving placebo.

The Evaluation in PTCA to Improve Long-term Outcome with Abciximab GPIIb/IIIa Blockade (EPILOG) study<sup>130</sup> included 2792 patients undergoing elective or urgent percutaneous coronary revascularization who received either abciximab with standard, weight-adjusted unfractionated heparin (UFH) (initial bolus 100 U/kg, target activated clotting time [ACT] 300 seconds) or placebo with standard-dose, weight-adjusted heparin. At 30 days, the composite event rate was observed in both high-risk and low-risk patients.

The c7E3 Fab Antiplatelet Therapy in Unstable Refractory Angina (CAPTURE) study<sup>131</sup> was designed to investigate whether abciximab, given during the 18–24 hours before coronary angioplasty, could improve outcome in patients with refractory (myocardial ischemia despite nitrates, heparin, and aspirin) unstable angina. A total of 1265 patients were randomly assigned to abciximab or placebo. By 30 days, the primary endpoint (death, MI, urgent revascularization) occurred in 11.3% of abciximab-treated patients and in 15.9% of placebo-treated patients (n ¼ 0.012). The rate of MI was lower before and during coronary interventions in those given abciximab.

Patients participating in the Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Arteries (GUSTO) IV-ACS trial<sup>132</sup> had chest pain and either ST-segment depression or elevated troponin levels. They were randomized to receive placebo, abciximab for 24 hours, or abciximab for 48 hours with recommended avoidance of revascularization during the initial 48 hours. Neither abciximab group fared better than placebo with respect to death or MI at 30 days. In addition, early mortality rates were higher with a prolonged abciximab infusion, suggesting a prothrombotic (or other adverse) effect.

In the GUSTO V study,133,134 patients with acute STEMI received either reteplase (standard dose) or half-dose reteplase plus abciximab. Although the 30-day mortality rates did not differ significantly, there were fewer nonfatal ischemic complications of MI with reteplase plus abciximab compared with reteplase alone. Intracranial hemorrhage rates did not differ between treatments; however, moderate-to-severe bleeding was more likely with combined therapy, and patients >75 years of age were at increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke (OR 1.91).

## Tirofiban

#### Pharmacodynamics

Tirofiban, a tyrosine derivative with a molecular weight of 495 kDa, is a nonpeptide inhibitor (peptidomimetic) of the platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptor. Tirofiban, like other nonpeptides, mimics the geometric, stereotactic, and charge characteristics of the RDG (Arg-Gly-Asp) sequence (of fibrinogen), thus interfering with platelet aggregation.

### Clinical Experience

The Randomized Efficacy Study of Tirofiban Outcomes and Restenosis (RESTORE) trial<sup>135</sup> was a randomized double-blind, placebocontrolled trial of tirofiban in patients with ACS undergoing PCI. Patients (n ¼ 2139) received tirofiban as a 10 μg/kg IV bolus over a 3-minute period and a continuous infusion of 0.15 μg/kg/min over 36 hours. All patients received UFH and aspirin. The primary composite endpoint (death, MI, angioplasty, failure requiring bypass surgery or unplanned stent placement, recurrent ischemia requiring repeat angioplasty) at 30 days was reduced, from 12.2% in the placebo group to 10.3% in the tirofiban group (16% relative reduction).

The Platelet Receptor Inhibition in Ischemic Syndrome Management (PRISM) trial136 included 3231 patients with non–ST-segment elevation ACS. All patients received aspirin and were randomized to treatment with either UFH or tirofiban, given as a loading dose of 0.6 μg/kg/min over 30 minutes followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.15 μg/kg/min for 48 hours (angiography/revascularization was discouraged during the infusion period). The primary composite endpoint (death, MI, refractory ischemia) at 48 hours was 5.6% in tirofiban-treated patients and 3.8% in placebo (aspirin/heparin) treated patients (risk reduction 33%). Benefit was maintained but overall was more modest at 7 and 30 days.

The PRISM in Patients Limited by Unstable Singes and Symptoms (PLUS) trial<sup>137</sup> included 1915 patients with non–ST-segment elevation ACS who were treated with aspirin and UFH and subsequently randomized to either tirofiban (0.4 μg/kg/min x 30 min; then 0.1 μg/kg/min for a minimum of 48 hours and a maximum of 108 hours) or placebo (unfractionated heparin). Angiography and revascularization were performed at the discretion of the treating physician. Tirofiban treated patients had a lower composite event rate of 7 days than the placebo group, 12.9% versus 17.9%, with a risk reduction of 34%. The benefit was mainly due to a reduced incidence of MI (47% risk reduction) and refractory ischemia (30% risk reduction). The benefit was maintained at 30 days (22% risk reduction in composite event rate) and at 6 months. The trial originally included a tirofiban-alone arm (no heparin) that was dropped because of excess mortality at 7 days.

The importance of early PCI among patients with non–STsegment elevation ACS was underscored in the Treat Angina With Aggrastat and Determine Cost of Therapy With an Invasive or Conservative Strategy (TACTICS)— TIMI 18 trial<sup>138</sup> as was the benefit of aggressive pharmacologic therapy (GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist) in combination with PCI for patients at greatest risk for adverse ischemic outcomes (prior MI, ST-segment changes, elevated cardiac biomarkers).

## Eptifibatide

#### Pharmacodynamics

Eptifibatide (Integrilin®) is a nonimmunogenic cyclic heptapeptide with an active pharmacophore that is derived from the structure of barbourin, a platelet GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor from the venom of the southeastern pigmy rattlesnake. In a pilot study of PCI, patients were randomized to one of four eptifibatide dosing schedules: 180 μg/kg bolus, 1 μg/kg/min infusion; 135 μg/kg bolus, 0.5 μg/kg/min infusion; 90 μg/kg bolus, 0.75 μg/kg/min infusion; and 135 μg/kg bolus, 0.75 μg/kg/min infusion.139 All patients received aspirin and UFH and were continued on the study drug for 18–24 hours. The two highest bolus doses produced >80% inhibition of ADP-mediated platelet aggregation within 15 minutes of administration in a majority of patients (>75%). A constant infusion of 0.75 μg/kg/min maintained the antiplatelet effect, whereas an infusion of 0.50 μg/kg/min allowed gradual recovery of platelet function. In all dosing groups, plateletfunction returned to >50% of baseline within 4 hours of terminating the infusion.

#### Pharmacokinetics

The plasma half-life of eptifibatide is 10–15 minutes, and clearance is predominantly renal (75%) and, to a lesser degree, hepatic (25%). The antiplatelet effect has a rapid onset of action and is rapidly reversible.

#### Clinical Experience

The Integrilin to Minimize Platelet Aggregation and Coronary Thrombosis (IMPACT-II) trial140 enrolled 4010 patients undergoing elective, urgent, or emergent PCI. Patients were assigned to either placebo, a bolus of 135 μg/kg eptifibatide followed by an infusion of 0.5 μg/kg/min for 20 to 24 hours, or 135 μg/kg bolus with a 0.75-μg/kg/min infusion. By 30 days, the composite endpoint (death, MI, unplanned revascularization, stent placement for abrupt closure)

occurred in 11.4%, 9.2%, and 9.9% of patients, respectively. Although the benefit of treatment was maintained at 6 months, the differences between groups were not statistically significant.

The IMPACT-AMI Study141 was designed to determine the effect of eptifibatide on coronary arterial patency when used adjunctively with Alteplase (tPA). A total of 132 patients with MI received tPA, heparin, and aspirin, and were randomized to receive a bolus dose, followed by a continuous infusion of one of six eptifibatide doses or placebo. The doses ranged from 36–180 μg/kg (bolus) and 0.2–0.75 μg/kg/min (infusion). Study drug was started within 24 hours. The highest-dose eptifibatide groups had more complete reperfusion (TIMI grade 3 flow) and shorter mean time to ST-segment recovery than placebo-treated patients. The composite clinical event rate (death, reinfarction, revascularization, heart failure, hypertension or stroke) was relatively high in all groups: 44.8% in eptifibatidetreated patients and 41.8% in placebo-treated patients.

The Platelet Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in Unstable Angina Receptor Suppression Using Integrilin Therapy (PURSUIT) trial<sup>142</sup> included patients with non–ST-segment elevation ACS with symptoms within 24 hours and electrocardiographic changes within 12 hours (of ischemia). A total of patients were randomized to eptifibatide: 180 μg/kg bolus plus 1.3 μg/kg/min infusion, or 180 μg/kg bolus plus 2.0 μg/kg/min infusion or placebo for up to 3 days (in addition to UFH [in most patients] and aspirin). The 30-day event rate of death or nonfatal MI was 14.2% with eptifibatide and 15.7% with placebo (1.5% absolute reduction). A reduction in MI or death (composite) with eptifibatide was observed at later time points.

The Enhanced Suppression of the Platelet GPIIb/IIIa Receptor with Integrilin Trial (ESPRIT) was designed to test the hypothesis that a minimum threshold of 80% GPIIb/IIIa receptor blockade was required for benefit.<sup>143</sup> A total of 2064 patients received either eptifibatide (180 μg/kg boluses [x 2] 10 minutes apart plus a continuous infusion of 2.0 μg/kg/min for 18 to 24 hours) or placebo prior to PCI. The trial was terminated early for efficacy, as patients receiving eptifibatide had a 4.0% absolute reduction in death, MI, urgent target vessel revascularization, or "bailout" GPIIb/IIIa antagonist use within 48 hours compared with placebo. Major events were significantly lower at 30 days as well. The Early versus Delayed, Provisional Eptifibatide in Acute Coronary Syndromes (EARLY–ACS) trial randomized NSTEMI/UA patients to a strategy of early, routine administration of eptifibatide versus delayed, provisional administration in 9492 patients. The primary composite endpoint of death, MI, recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization, or thrombotic complication during PCI occurred at similar rates in both groups; however, there was significantly higher bleeding and transfusion requirements in the "early" group.<sup>144</sup>

#### **Agent-Specific Pharmacologic Properties**

Although considered collectively as GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonists, abciximab, tirofiban, and eptifibatide differ at several levels, including their molecular weight, binding characteristics, route of clearance, plasma half-life, platelet-bound and biologic half-life, potential reversibility approved indications, and use in clinical practice. The duration of platelet inhibition following drug discontinuation and the potential for reversing the pharmacologic effect are particularly important properties in cases of emergent surgery and major hemorrhagic complications. In general, a return of platelet function toward a physiologic state (<50% inhibition) occurs within 4 hours following the cessation of tirofiban and eptifibatide. In contrast, 12 hours are required for abciximab. Some of the delayed return of physiologic platelet function following abciximab termination may be counterbalanced by its low free plasma concentrations and drug-to-receptor ratio. These properties are responsible for the rapid return of hemostatic potential following platelet transfusions (and may also limit platelet inhibiting potential with marked mobilization of GPIIb/IIIa receptors from platelet storage pools). In contrast, the high plasma concentrations observed with the small-molecule inhibitors limit the effectiveness of platelet transfusions. Fibrinogen supplementation (fresh frozen plasma [FFP], cryoprecipitate) is the more logical choice for restoration of hemostatic potential, given the competitive nature of binding and relative availability of platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptors. 146

#### **Cangrelor**

Cangrelor is a rapid-acting, reversible, potent, competitive inhibitor of the  $P2Y_{12}$  receptor.

#### **Pharmacodynamics**

Given intravenously, cangrelor acts within 20 minutes to achieve 85% inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation. By whole

blood impedance aggregometry there is 98% inhibition of platelet aggregation.

#### **Pharmacokinetics**

Cangrelor is rapidly deactivated in circulation by dephosphorylation to its primary metabolite, which has negligible antiplatelet activity. It is excreted in urine (58%) and feces (35%) with an average half-life of 3–6 minutes.

#### **Adverse Events**

In the CHAMPION-PLATFORM study, there was no significant difference in the rate of blood transfusion (1.0% in the cangrelor group and 0.6% in the placebo group,  $P\!=\!0.13$ ); however, bleeding at femoral artery access sites was more common among patients receiving cangrelor than placebo.

#### **Clinical Experience**

In CHAMION-PLATFORM, 5362 patients who had not been treated with clopidogrel were randomly assigned to receive either cangrelor or placebo at the time of PCI, followed by 600 mg of clopidogrel. The primary endpoint was a composite of death, MI, or ischemia-driven revascularization at 48 hours. Enrollment was stopped when an interim analysis concluded that the trial would be unlikely to show superiority for the primary endpoint. <sup>147</sup> The primary endpoint occurred in 185 of 2654 patients receiving cangrelor (7.0%) and in 210 of 2641 patients receiving placebo (8.0%) (OR in the cangrelor group 0.87; 95% CI 0.71–1.07; P = 0.17) (by a modified intention-totreat population adjusted for missing data). In the cangrelor group, two prespecified secondary endpoints were significantly reduced at 48 hours: the rate of stent thrombosis, from 0.6% to 0.2% (OR 0.31; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.85; P = 0.02), and the rate of death from any cause, from 0.7% to 0.2% (OR 0.33; 95% CI 0.13–0.83; P = 0.02). The rates of adverse events related to the study treatment were low in both groups, though transient dyspnea occurred significantly more frequently with cangrelor than with clopidogrel (1.2% versus 0.3%).

In a subsequent trial, PHOÈNIX, <sup>148</sup> patients who were undergoing either urgent or elective PCI and were receiving guideline-recommended therapy were randomly assigned to receive a bolus dose followed by an infusion of cangrelor, or to receive a loading dose of 600 mg or 300 mg of clopidogrel. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of death, MI, ischemia-driven revascularization, or stent thrombosis at 48 hours after randomization; the key secondary endpoint was severe bleeding at 48 hours. The primary safety endpoint was severe bleeding at 48 hours. The rate of the primary efficacy endpoint was 4.7% in the cangrelor group and 5.9% in the clopidogrel group (adjusted

OR with cangrelor 0.78; 95% CI 0.66–0.93; P=0.005). The rate of the primary safety endpoint was 0.16% in the cangrelor group and 0.11% in the clopidogrel group (OR 1.50; 95% CI 0.53–4.22; P=0.44). Stent thrombosis developed in 0.8% of the patients in the cangrelor group and in 1.4% in the clopidogrel group (OR 0.62; 95% CI 0.43–0.90; P=0.01).

#### Transition to an Oral P2Y<sub>12</sub> Receptor Antagonist

When planning to transition from cangrelor to an oral  $P2Y_{12}$  receptor antagonist, it is important for the clinician to know that cangrelor occupies the platelet  $P2Y_{12}$  binding site, precluding the binding and pharmacodynamic effect of clopidogrel and prasugrel. Accordingly, these oral agents should be administered *after* cessation of cangrelor. By contrast, the binding site for ticagrelor is distinct allowing it to be administered during cangrelor administration.

# Bleeding Complications Associated With Platelet-Directed Therapy

#### **Clinical Impact**

The contribution of platelets to the clinical expression of atherosclerotic vascular disease and the well-documented benefit derived from their pharmacologic attenuation provides a strong rationale for use in routine clinical practice. It is not uncommon for more than one platelet antagonist to be administered concomitantly. Accordingly, the impact on hemostasis and the overall risk of bleeding must be weighed against benefit.

A meta-analysis of 50 randomized clinical trials, <sup>149</sup> including a total of patients with coronary and or peripheral artery disease, found a very low risk of hemorrhagic stroke (0.2%) with aspirin (up to 325 mg daily), thienopyridines, and IV GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonists. The risk of major hemorrhage was greater, ranging from 1.7% with aspirin to 3.6% in those receiving IV GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonists. The incidence of combined major and minor hemorrhagic events was 3.6% for low-intensity aspirin (<100 mg daily), 9.1% for moderate-intensity aspirin (100–325 mg daily), and 8.5% for clopidogrel.

#### **Bleeding and Clinical Outcomes**

In the PLATO trial, spontaneous ischemic events (MI or stroke) were determined in relationship to spontaneous major bleeding events (PLATO major, TIMI major, GUSTO severe) with a focus on risk of mortality using time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models. The comparison was performed using ratio of HRs for mortality increase after ischemic versus bleeding events. <sup>150</sup> A total of

822 patients (4.4%) had  $\geq 1$  spontaneous ischemic event; 485 patients (2.6%),  $\geq 1$  spontaneous PLATO major bleed, 282 (1.5%),  $\geq 1$  spontaneous TIMI major bleed; and 207 (1.1%),  $\geq 1$  spontaneous severe GUSTO bleed. In patients who had both events, bleeding occurred first in most patients. Overall, major bleeding events were associated with increased short- and long-term mortality. The association was similar to the increase associated with spontaneous ischemic events: ratio of HRs (95% CIs) for short- and long-term mortality after spontaneous ischemic versus bleeding events: 1.46 (0.98–2.19) and 0.92 (0.52–1.62) (PLATO major); 1.26 (0.80–1.96) and 1.19 (0.58–2.24) (TIMI major); and 0.72 (0.47–1.10) and 0.83 (0.38–1.79) (GUSTO severe) (all P > 0.05).

#### **Management of Bleeding Complications**

The initial management of bleeding is dictated by its severity and clinical impact. Minor bleeding may only require close observation and local measures, while more serious or life-threatening hemorrhage may dictate aggressive supportive measures, a change in or cessation of antithrombotic medication, blood replacement products or repletion of platelets, and prohemostatic substrate. There are currently no reversal agents for platelet antagonists. The risk of thrombosis must be carefully considered as should reinitiation of platelet-directed therapy once hemostasis has been achieved. <sup>151a</sup>

# Supporting Data for Attenuating P2Y<sub>12</sub> Antagonist Pharmacodynamic Effects

In the Antagonize P2Y<sub>12</sub> Treatment Inhibitors by Transfusion of Platelets in an Urgent or Delayed Timing After Acute Coronary Syndrome or Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Presentation-Acute Coronary Syndrome (APTITUDE-ACS)<sup>151b</sup> study patients presenting with ACS or for elective PCI who received loading doses of clopidogrel (600 mg, n = 13 or 900 mg, n = 12), prasugrel 60 mg (n = 10), or ticagrelor 180 mg (n = 10) were included. Platelet aggregation was assessed ex vivo by mixing platelet-rich plasma from blood sampling performed at baseline in increasing proportions with platelet-rich plasma sampled 4 hours after loading dose. The percentage restoration of residual platelet aggregation achieved was significantly decreased with increasing potency of P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor inhibitors (RI) (83.9%  $\pm$  11%, 73%  $\pm$  14%, 66.3%  $\pm$  15%, 40.9%  $\pm$ 19% for clopidogrel 600 mg, clopidogrel 900 mg, prasugrel, and ticagrelor, respectively; P for trend < 0.0001). In the APTITUDE-Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (APTITUDE-CABG) study, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein-platelet reactivity index, a specific marker of the P2Y<sub>12</sub> RI drug-effect, was assessed before and after in vivo prothrombin (PT) administered for excessive

bleeding in patients undergoing cardiac surgery while on a maintenance dose of aspirin and clopidogrel (n=45), prasugrel (n=6), or ticagrelor (n=3). When compared with baseline, there was a significant relative increase of 23.1% in platelet activation after platelet transfusion (42.2%  $\pm$  23.6% versus 56.6%  $\pm$  18.2%, P=0.0008). The overall effect was modest with increasing potency of P2Y12 inhibition

#### The Challenge of Attenuating Ticagrelor's Pharmacodynamic Effect

The dynamic equilibrium of ticagrelor plasma concentrations and platelet binding creates a unique scenario when attempting to attenuate its pharmacodynamics effect. Comparatively high plasma levels translate to binding and inhibiting transfused platelets. 152a Several other approaches have been tested. PRI-VASP was determined before and after in vitro platelet supplementation of platelet poor (PP) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) at increasing concentrations from 79 whole blood samples of patients treated with ticagrelor, prasugrel, or clopidogrel. Compared to prasugrel- and clopidogreltreated patients, the PRI-VASP of ticagrelor-treated patients showed no significant increase after in vitro administration of PP. PRI-VASP was performed in ticagrelor-treated samples after in vitro addition of centrifuged PRP platelets resuspended in PP buffer; PP with human serum or human serum alone. PP with human serum or human serum alone were able to significantly increase PRI-VASP in samples of ticagrelor-treated patients (11.7%  $\pm$  10.9%  $\rightarrow$  61.3%  $\pm$  $10.9\%, P = 0.006; 11.7\% \pm 10.9\% \rightarrow 54.1\% \pm 2.7\%, P < 0.001$ ). This effect could also be shown using human albumin (18.9%  $\pm$  5.1%  $\rightarrow$ 80 g/L human albumin:  $48.1\% \pm 8.3\%$ , P < 0.001), suggesting that serum protein binding of ticagrelor effectively reduces its availability to bind and inhibit platelets. 152b

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase I trial evaluated IV PB2452, a monoclonal antibody fragment that binds ticagrelor with high affinity, as a ticagrelor reversal agent. Platelet function was determined in healthy volunteers before and after 48 hours of ticagrelor pretreatment and again after the administration of PB2452 or placebo. Platelet function was assessed with the use of light transmission aggregometry, a point-of-care P2Y<sub>12</sub> platelet-reactivity test, and a vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein assay. Of the 64 volunteers who underwent randomization, 48 were assigned to receive PB2452 and 16 to receive placebo. After 48 hours of ticagrelor pretreatment, platelet aggregation was suppressed by approximately 80%. PB2452 administered as an initial IV bolus followed by a prolonged infusion (8, 12, or 16 hours) was associated with a significantly greater increase in platelet

function than placebo, as measured by multiple assays. Ticagrelor reversal occurred within 5 minutes after the initiation of PB2452 and was sustained for more than 20 hours. There was no evidence of a rebound in platelet activity after drug cessation.<sup>153</sup>

## Anticoagulants

The participation of coagulation proteases, particularly FXa and FIIa (thrombin), in several phases of cell-based coagulation form a biology-centered use of pharmacologic therapy in patients with cardiovascular disease. Among hospitalized patients, the antithrombin (AT) drugs (UFH, low-molecular-weight heparins [LMWH], pentasaccharide) and direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) are used frequently, often in combination with platelet antagonists (Tables 8.11 and 8.12).

## Parenteral Anticoagulant Drugs

### Heparins

#### Unfractionated Heparin

UFH achieves a rapid anticoagulant effect. UFH is a heterogeneous mixture of sulfated glycosaminoglycans of variable lengths and molecular weights. The anticoagulant effects and pharmacologic properties vary with the size of the molecules. UFH exerts its anticoagulant effects in three well-characterized and distinct ways. The major anticoagulant effect is the result of its high affinity for AT and the conformational change in AT that occurs from the binding of heparin and AT, inactivating FIXa, FXa, FXIa, and FXIIa. Thrombin and FXa are highly sensitive to inhibition by the heparin/AT complex. Inhibition of thrombin by UFH requires its binding to AT that occurs at a unique pentasaccharide sequence of the molecule and simultaneous binding of heparin to thrombin by 13 additional saccharide units. One-third of UFH molecules contain the high-affinity pentasaccharide required for its anticoagulant activity. The second mechanism of UFH's anticoagulant effect is inactivation of thrombin by heparin cofactor II.<sup>154</sup> The third mechanism that may not be clinically relevant at expected drug concentrations is through modulation of FXa generation achieved by UFH binding to factor IXa.

#### Low-Molecular-Weight Heparins

LMWHs are derived from UFH by chemical depolymerization. The overall process creates fragments that are approximately one-third the molecular weight of UFH.<sup>155</sup> LMWHs have a major role in catalyzing AT-mediated inhibition of coagulation factors; however, 50% to 75% of LMWH chains are too short to catalyze thrombin inhibition. These short chains do promote FXa inhibition, and accordingly LMWHs are comparatively more selective inhibitors of FXa than UFH. Other favorable features of LMWHs from UFH include reduced protein binding that improves their pharmacokinetic properties and results in a more predictable anticoagulant response and reduced interaction with platelets, which reduces the likelihood of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).

## Direct Thrombin Inhibitors

DTIs interact directly with thrombin and do not require AT (or heparin cofactor II) to achieve an anticoagulant effect. They specifically and reversibly inhibit free and clot-bound thrombin by binding to the active site of thrombin. Argatroban is a univalent direct thrombin inhibitor, binding only to the catalytic (active) site of thrombin as a competitive inhibitor of thrombin. Bivalirudin is a bivalent thrombin inhibitor, binding to both the catalytic (active) site and the substrate recognition (exosite 1) site of thrombin molecule.156 Inhibition of thrombin attenuates formation of fibrin, reduces thrombin generation, and may limit platelet activation and aggregation. The direct oral thrombin inhibitor dabigatran will be discussed in a separate section.

## Direct FXa Inhibitors

Fondaparinux, the first of a class of selective inhibitors of FXa, is a chemically synthesized sulfated pentasaccharide that specifically targets AT. After binding to AT, a permanent conformational change occurs in the molecule that causes an increased affinity for FXa. Fondaparinux does not inhibit thrombin directly, but inactivation of FXa by AT provides strong inhibition of thrombin generation.

## Clinical Experience: General Use

In the hospital setting, common clinical indications for anticoagulants include prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in acutely ill medical patients; prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism after surgical procedures, such as knee or hip replacement; thrombosis prophylaxis in patients with ACS; the treatment of acute venous and arterial thromboembolism; and periprocedural anticoagulation during coronary or other vascular interventions.

## Unfractionated Heparin

UFH is a heterogeneous, negatively charged mucopolysaccharide consisting of approximately 18–50 saccharide units (molecular weight 5000–30,000 daltons).

## Pharmacodynamics

UFH binds to AT and exerts its anticoagulant effects primarily through inhibition of thrombin and FXa.

## Pharmacokinetics

Following IV administration, UFH binds to several plasma proteins, endothelial cells, and macrophages, explaining the wide variability in anticoagulant effect seen for a given dose. It is cleared from the circulation through both a rapid saturable mechanism and a slower first-order mechanism. The primary site of metabolism is within the reticular endothelial system. As a result, there is a dose-dependent half-life ranging from 60 minutes after a dose of 100 U/kg to 180 minutes for a dose of 400 U/kg. <sup>157</sup> A metabolite, uro-heparin, with minimal anticoagulant properties is cleared renally.

#### **Adverse Effects**

Bleeding and HIT are the most common and feared complications of UFH administration. Other adverse effects include hypersensitivity reactions, adrenal hemorrhage with shock, and osteopenia (with long-term administration).

## **Clinical Experience**

Clinical trials have been conducted to compare the benefits of UFH and aspirin among patients with unstable angina and NSTEMI. The first trial, performed by Theroux and colleagues,  $^{158}$  compared aspirin (325 mg twice daily), heparin (5000 U bolus, 1000 U per hour by IV infusion), their combination, and placebo in 479 patients. This is the only large-scale study that compared heparin (alone) and aspirin (alone), as well as their combination. Refractory angina occurred in 8.5%, 16.5%, and 10.7% of patients, respectively (0.47 relative risk for heparin compared with aspirin [95% CI 0.21–1.05;  $P\!=\!0.06$ ]). MI occurred in 0.9%, 3.3%, and 1.6% of patients, respectively (0.25 RR; 95% CI 0.03–2.271;  $P\!=\!0.18$ ), and any event was observed in 9.3%, 16.5%, and 11.5% of patients, respectively (0.52 RR, 95% CI 0.24–1.14;  $P\!=\!0.10$ ). Serious bleeding, defined as a fall in hemoglobin concentration of 2 g or more, or the need for a transfusion, occurred in 1.7%, 1.7%, and 3.3% of patients, respectively. Most of these events followed cardiac catheterization.

Many subsequent trials investigated the potential advantages of combination therapy (heparin plus aspirin) compared with aspirin monotherapy. Although outcomes with these treatments were not statistically different, consistent trends observed across each study favored combined pharmacotherapy and its ability to reduce death or MI (combined endpoint). A pooled analysis of the Antithrombotic Therapy in Acute Coronary Syndromes (ATACS) trial, the Research Group on Instability in Coronary Artery Disease in Southeast Sweden (RISC) study, and the Theroux trial yielded a relative risk of 0.44 (95% CI 0.21–0.93) for death/MI, in favor of combination therapy. <sup>159-161</sup>

#### **HIT Therapy**

Lepirudin, argatroban, and bivalirudin can be used in the management of HIT. In patients with suspected or proven HIT who require

PCI, argatroban (direct thrombin inhibitor, 240 μg/kg bolus followed by 20 μg/kg/min infusion) can be used during the intervention, with or without a GPIIb/IIIa antagonist.<sup>162</sup> Bivalirudin is licensed for use when HIT or heparin induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis syndrome (HITTS) complicates PCI.

## Clinical Experience

#### Acute Myocardial Infarction

In acute MI STEMI, UFH can be administered with thrombolytic therapy or during primary PCI. In ACS, UFH can be administered and is most beneficial in the setting of an elevated troponin value (Table 8.13). Other anticoagulant options and specific dosing recommendations are summarized in Tables 8.13 and 8.14, respectively.

From Amsterdam EA et al. 2014 AHA/ACC guideline for the management of patients with non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes: <sup>a</sup> report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines. J Am Coll Cardiol 2014;64:e139–e228.

#### Elective PCI

In elective PCI, a standard regimen is 70–100 IU/kg, with additional weight-adjusted boluses to achieve and maintain an ACT of 200–250 seconds.163 If a GPIIb/IIIa antagonist is coadministered, the initial heparin dosage is reduced to 70 IU/kg (bolus), followed by additional bolus doses as needed to maintain an ACT of 200 seconds. Heparin should be discontinued immediately after PCI.

#### Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation

Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) has been critical for cardiac surgery and postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock. CPB provides heart-lung support during open heart surgeries while extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can provide short-term partial or total cardiac support for postcardiotomy syndrome and a wide spectrum of severe cardiogenic shock patients. In addition to full cardiac support, ECMO provides oxygenation through an artificial lung. Blood exposure to the large surface of the ECMO circuits disrupts normal hemostasis like other MCS devices but also induces a strong inflammatory response similar to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). In the absence of HIT, anticoagulation with UFH is necessary to prevent clotting of the ECMO circuit with a goal activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 1.5–2.0 times the upper limit of normal. As with other MCS devices that require anticoagulation, thrombotic and bleeding complications are common and occur in up to 50% of ECMO supported patients. Anticoagulation can be held during ECMO support if life-threatening bleeding occurs.<sup>164</sup>

#### Left Ventricular Device Thrombosis

The diagnosis of LVAD thrombosis is made by clinical exam and history, laboratory results, pump parameters, and echocardiographic imaging including ramp studies. Standard treatment for suspected or confirmed pump thrombosis is anticoagulation with IV UFH and the addition of antiplatelet therapy. Direct thrombin inhibitors, primarily bivalirudin, have been used as an alternative anticoagulant to UFH, but are more expensive and not clearly proven to be superior to UFH. Bivalirudin can be used in patients with HIT. DAPT with aspirin plus clopidogrel or dipyridamole can be considered to enhance antiplatelet effect.165 Pump exchange is usually performed for confirmed LVAD thrombosis not responsive to medical treatment especially in patients with hemodynamic compromise and end organ hypoperfusion. Heart transplantation is another option if a donor heart is available. Thrombolytic therapy is not recommended for either suspected or confirmed pump thrombosis in patients who are candidates for pump exchange due to high risk for intracranial hemorrhage. Clinical experience with direct thrombin inhibitors, GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, and thrombolytics has been summarized in comprehensive reviews. <sup>166,167</sup>

#### Transcatheter Valve and Structural Heart Interventions

Structural heart procedures are often associated with a significant risk of both thromboembolic and bleeding complications; hence in such context, the delicate balance between the thrombotic and bleeding risks must be carefully weighed. Although such procedures have been exceedingly associated with successful outcomes, the incidence of thromboembolic complications, particularly CVEs, has been generating ongoing concerns. <sup>168</sup> To date, the effectiveness of antiplatelet therapy and its optimal regimen before and after percutaneous valvular and structural heart interventions remain a subject of investigation.

#### Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR)

In the Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves (PARTNER) Trial, the incidence of stroke was higher in the TAVR group compared with surgical replacement at 1-year follow-up (5.1% versus 2.4%, P=0.07). Evaluation of the clinical impact of valve thrombosis and the role of oral anticoagulation therein, especially that of novel oral anticoagulant agents, requires additional investigations.

Current guidelines recommend the use of DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel for 3–6 months in patients undergoing TAVR (Table 8.15). <sup>169,170</sup> However, no evidence for clear benefit of DAPT over single antiplatelet therapy has yet been seen from clinical trials; and as such, it may be reasonable to adopt a strategy of a single antiplatelet therapy except for patients with concomitant atrial fibrillation.

# Indirect, Selective FXa Inhibitors Synthetic Pentasaccharide: Fondaparinux

Fondaparinux is a synthetic pentasaccharide that requires AT for selective FXa binding. Unlike heparin compounds, fondaparinux does not inhibit thrombin directly, nor does it interact with platelets (or platelet derived proteins). After subcutaneous (SQ) administration in healthy volunteers fondaparinux is nearly 100% bioavailable and the absorption is rapid ( $C_{\rm max}$  within 2 hours). <sup>171</sup> Clearance occurs by renal mechanisms with a terminal half-life of 17 +/-3 hours (slightly longer in elderly volunteers). Overall, drug clearance is 25% lower in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCl] 50–80 mL/min; approximately 40% lower with

## Clinical Experience

Fondaparinux is approved for the prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis in patients undergoing abdominal surgery, traumatic hip surgery, hip replacement, and knee replacement.

The Organization to Assess Strategies in Acute Ischemic Syndromes (OASIS)-5 Study<sup>172</sup> assigned patients with ACS to receive fondaparinux (2.5 mg daily SQ) or enoxaparin (1 mg per kilogram of body weight twice daily SQ) for a mean of 6 days and evaluated death, MI, or refractory ischemia at 9 days (the primary outcome measure), as well as major bleeding and a combination of the two. The numbers of patients with primary outcome events were similar in the two groups (fondaparinux, 5.8%, versus enoxaparin, 5.7%; HR in the fondaparinux group, 1.01; 95% CI 0.90–1.13), satisfying the noninferiority criteria. The rate of major bleeding at 9 days was markedly lower with fondaprinux than with enoxaparin (2.2% versus 4.1%; HR 0.52; P < 0.001). A composite of the primary outcome measure and major bleeding at 9 days favored fondaparinux (7.3% versus 9%; HR 0.81;P < 0.001). Fondaparinux was associated with a significant reduction in the number of patients with fatal bleeding and TIMI major bleeding. Regardless of treatment, patients who had major bleeding during hospitalization had significantly higher rates of death, reinfarction, or stroke at 30 days and at 180 days than did patients without major or minor bleeding. These higher event rates associated with bleeding persisted after adjustments were made for a number of clinical characteristics often associated with bleeding. Accordingly, almost the entire difference in mortality between fondaparinux and enoxaparin-treated patients could be attributed to the lower rate of bleeding associated with fondaparinux.

In a subgroup analysis, benefits and risks were consistently in favor of fondaprinux. Rates of bleeding were consistently lower with fondaprinux, regardless of whether UFH was administered before randomization. The proportions of patients undergoing PCI (39.5% in the fondaparinux group and 39.5% in the enoxaparin group) and coronary arterial bypass grafting (15.3% and 14.5%, respectively) were similar in the two groups. Rates of the combination of death, MI, and refractory ischemia were similar at 9 days, at 30 days, and at the end of the study. An increase in guiding catheter thrombus formation was observed with fondaprinux (0.9% versus 0.4%); however, rates of other complications, including pseudoaneurysm formation, large hematomas, major bleeding, and complications involving the vascular access site, were all less common with fondaparinux than with enoxaparin. Collectively, the rate of death, MI, stroke, major bleeding, or any procedural complication at 9 days was 16.6% with fondaparinux as compared with 20.6% with enoxaparin (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.73-0.90: P < 0.001)

The OASIS-6 study 173 was a randomized double-blind comparison of fondaparinux 2.5 mg once daily versus placebo for up to 8 days in patients with STEMI. The composite of death or reinfarction at 30 days served as the primary outcome measure, with secondary assessments at 9 days and at final follow-up (3– 6 months). Death or reinfarction at 30 days was significantly reduced from 11.2% in the control group to 9.7% among patients receiving fondaparinux; in a comparison of patients receiving fondaparinux versus those given UFH, fondaprinux was found to be superior in preventing death or reinfarction at 30 days (HR 0.82; 95% CI 0.66–1.02; P = 0.08) and at study end (HR 0.77; 95% CI 0.64-0.93; P=0.008). Significant benefit was observed among patients receiving fibrinolytic therapy (HR 0.83; 95% CI 0.73-0.94; P = 0.003), but not in those undergoing primary PCI. The use of a single fixed dose (2.5 mg once daily SQ) of fondaparinux without monitoring or dose adjustment for weight across a broad range of creatinine levels, coupled with simplicity, safety, and efficacy in ACS, may facilitate its use.

## Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin

Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is prepared by the depolymerization of porcine UFH. A variety of processes are used, giving distinctive products whose molecular weights range from 4000 to 6500 Da. Like UFH, approximately one-third of LMWH polysaccharide chains contain the pentasaccharide-binding site for antithrombin. The LMWH-AT complex (consisting of a predominance of shorter-chain polysaccharides) has relatively weak AT activity but retains the ability to inactivate FXa. The ratio of anti-Xa activity to anti-IIa (antithrombin) activity varies from 2:1 to 4:1. Similar to UFH, LMWH does not inhibit thrombin bound to fibrin.

### Pharmacokinetics

When LMWH is given in either fixed or weight-adjusted doses by the SQ route, greater than 90% of the dose is absorbed. By contrast to UFH, LMWH has minimal binding to cells or plasma proteins, resulting in persistence of free drug in the circulation and a longer half-life. While the half-life of UFH averages about 90 minutes, the half-life of LMWH averages about 180 minutes (the half-lives of three LMWHs range from 90 to 260 minutes).

## Safety

Thrombocytopenia is infrequently observed with LMWH administration, but antibodies directed against complexes of LMWH and platelet factor 4 have been detected in some patients. On rare occasion, the full-blown syndrome of HIT occurs. Equally rare is necrosis at the site of skin injections with LMWH, which may represent a form of local HIT.

## Clinical Experience

The original experience with LMWH174 included 205 patients with unstable angina who were randomized to either aspirin (200 mg daily), aspirin (200 mg daily) plus UFH (5000 U bolus, 400 U/kg per day infusion), or high-dose nadroparin (214 IU/kg twice daily by SQ injection) plus aspirin (200 mg daily). Patients underwent continuous ST-segment monitoring during the first 48 hours of treatment. Overall, 73% of patients receiving LMWH were free from ischemic events, compared with 39% of those receiving UFH and 40% of patients given aspirin alone. There were fewer silent ischemic events in the LMWH group (18%) compared with those receiving UFH (29%) or aspirin alone (34%). Recurrent angina occurred in 9%, 26%, and 19% of patients, respectively, and MIs were not observed in LMWH-treated patients (compared with 1% in the UFH and 6% in the aspirin alone groups). Major bleeding occurred infrequently in all treatment groups.

A larger study, FRagmin during InStability in Coronary artery disease (FRISC)-1,<sup>175</sup> included 1506 patients with unstable angina and NSTEMI randomized to LMWH (dalteparin, 120 IU/kg body weight subcutaneous [SQ] [maximum IU] twice daily for 6 days, then 7500 IU once daily for 35–45 days) or placebo. All patients received aspirin (300 mg first dose, 75 mg daily thereafter). Accordingly, FRISC I investigated the combination of LMWH plus aspirin versus aspirin alone. The risk of death or MI was reduced by 63% at day 6. The probability of death, MI, and need for revascularization remained lower in the LMWH-treated patients at 40 days; however, modest differences between groups was observed beyond the treatment period.

In the FRIC study,<sup>176</sup> 1482 patients with unstable angina and NSTEMI were assigned either twice-daily weight-adjusted SQ injections of LMWH (dalteparin 120 IU/kg) or dose-adjusted (target APTT 1.5 times the control) IV UFH for 6 days (acute treatment phase). Patients randomized to UFH received a continuous infusion for at least 48 hours and were given the option of either continuing the infusion or changing to a SQ regimen (12,500 U every 12 hours). In the double-blind comparison that took place from days 6 to 45 (prolonged treatment phase), patients received either LMWH (dalteparin, 7500 IU SQ once daily) or placebo. Aspirin (75–165 mg/day) was initiated in all patients as early as possible after hospital admission and continued throughout the study. During the first 6 days, the rate of death, recurrent angina, and MI was 7.6% in the UFH-treated patients and 9.3% in the LMWH-treated patients (RR 1.18; 95% CI 0.84–1.66). Revascularization was required in 5.3% and 4.8% (CI 0.57–1.35) of patients, respectively. Between days 6 and 45, the composite endpoint was reached in 12.3% of patients in both the LMWH and placebo groups.

The Efficacy and Safety of subcutaneous Enoxaparin in Non-Q Wave Coronary Events (ESSENCE) trial<sup>177</sup> randomly assigned 3171 patients with angina at rest or NSTEMI either LMWH (Enoxaparin, 1 mg/kg SQ twice daily) or IV UFH (target aPTT 55–85 seconds). Therapy was continued for a minimum of 48 hours (maximum 8 days). All patients received aspirin (100–325 mg daily). The median duration of therapy for both groups was 2.6 days. At 14 days, the risk of death, recurrent angina, or MI was 16.6% among patients receiving LMWH and 19.8% for patients given UFH (16% risk reduction). A similar risk reduction (15%) for the composite outcome was observed at 30 days. The benefit of LMWH treatment was maintained at 1 year.<sup>178</sup>

The TIMI IIB Study, compared enoxaparin and UFH in 3910 patients with unstable angina and NSTEMI. 179 The trial design had several unique features compared with ESSENCE. First, enoxaparin therapy was initiated with a 30-mg IV bolus, followed by 1.0 mg/kg SO twice daily. Second, UFH treatment was given according to a weight-adjusted dosing strategy (70 U/kg bolus, followed by 15 U/kg/h infusion to a target APTT 1.5-2.5 times control). Lastly, there was an out-of-hospital treatment phase comparing enoxaparin and placebo for approximately 6 weeks (patients >65 kg received <60 mg SQ BID; those <65 kg received 45 mg SQ BID for a total of 43 days). Treatment with enoxaparin was associated with a significant reduction in the composite outcome of death, MI or urgent revascularization compared with UFH at day 14 (14.2% versus 16.7%; RRR 15%, P = 0.03). Continued treatment beyond the initial hospital phase did not provide added benefit (17.3% versus 19.7%, RRR 12%, P = 0.051).

A meta-analyses of the ESSENCE and TIMI IIB trials, totaling 7081 patients with non–ST-segment elevation ACS, revealed a 20% reduction in the risk of any ischemic event 180 favoring enoxaparin over UFH. The differences were statistically significant at 48 hours and 43 days. The combined endpoint of death or MI was reduced by 20% at 48 hours (P=0.02) and 18% at 43 days (P=0.02). A significant treatment benefit for enoxaparin on the rate of death, nonfatal MI or urgent revascularization was observed at one year (HR 0.88, P=0.008, absolute difference 2.5%). A progressively greater treatment benefit was observed as the level of patient risk increased.

# **Combined Pharmacology and Coronary Interventional Strategies**

The FRagmin and fast revascularization during InStability in Coronary artery disease (FRISC II) <sup>181</sup> included 2267 patients with unstable coronary disease who received 5 days of dalteparin (120 IU/kg SQ q12h) and were then randomized to either an invasive or conservative treatment strategy. In a separate randomization, patients received either dalteparin (5000–7500 IU SQ q12h) or placebo injections for 3 months. By 30 days there was a significant reduction in death or MI favoring dalteparin-treated patients (3.1% versus 5.9%, P=0.002). The benefit decayed over the next 2 months. An invasive strategy (coronary angiography and revascularization) was associated with a significant reduction in death or MI at 6 months compared with ischemia-driven revascularization (9.4% versus 12.1%, P=0.03). The mortality rates were 1.9% and 2.9%, respectively (FRISC II Investigators, 1999). At 24-month follow-up, there were reductions in mortality (3.7% versus 12.7%, RR 0.72,

 $P\!=\!0.005$ ) and the composite endpoint of death or MI (12.1% versus 16.3%, RR 0.74,  $P\!=\!0.003$ ) in the invasive compared with the non-invasive group. The need for repeat hospitalizations and late revascularization procedures was lower in patients who underwent an early invasive strategy.

The Randomized Intervention Trial of unstable Angina (RITA) study randomized 1810 patients with non–ST segment elevation ACS who received enoxaparin (1 mg/kg SQ twice daily for 2 to 8 days) and aspirin to either an early intervention or conservative strategy.  $^{182}$  At 4 months, 9.6% of patients randomized to an early intervention had either died, experienced an MI, or experienced refractory angina compared with 14.5% in the conservative group (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.51, 0.85; P=0.001). Death or MI was similar in both treatment groups at 1 year (7.6% versus 8.3%, respectively, RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.67, 1.25; P=0.58). Fewer patients undergoing early intervention experienced symptoms of angina or required antianginal medications.

In the Superior Yield of the New Strategy of Enoxaparin, Revascularization and GPIIb/IIIa Inhibitors (SYNERGY) trial, <sup>183</sup> high-risk non–ST-segment elevation ACS patients were randomized to UFH or enoxaparin. Overall, 92% of patients underwent coronary angiography, 47% had PCI (in-hospital), and 57% received GPIIb/IIIa antagonists. The primary endpoint of death or nonfatal MI at 3 days occurred in 14.5% of patients assigned to UFH and 14.0% of those given enoxaparin (OR 0.956; 95% CI 0.869–1.063), fulfilling the noninferiority criteria. There were no differences in ischemic events during PCI between the antithrombins. Major bleeding was modestly increased with enoxaparin. Transfusion rates did not differ and there was a relationship between advancing age, reduced CrCl, and risk of hemorrhage.

In the Enoxaparin and Thrombolysis Reperfusion for Acute Myocardial Infarction Treatment (ExTRACT)-TIMI 25 study, 184 patients with STEMI who were scheduled to undergo fibrinolysis received enoxaparin throughout the index hospitalization or UFH for at least 48 hours. The primary efficacy endpoint, death or nonfatal recurrent MI through day 30, occurred in 12% of patients in the UFH group and 9.9% of those in the enoxaparin group (17%) reduction in RR, P < 0.001). Nonfatal reinfarction occurred in 4.5% of patients receiving UFH and 3% of those who were given enoxaparin (33% reduction in RR, P < 0.001). A nonstatistically significant reduction in death occurred (7.5% versus 6.9%, respectively, P =0.11). Major bleeding occurred in 1.4% and 2.1% of patients, respectively. The composite of death, nonfatal reinfarction, or nonfatal intracranial hemorrhage (a measure of net clinical benefit) occurred in 12.2% of patients administered heparin and 10.1% of those given enoxaparin (P < 0.001).

In the Acute Myocardial Infarction Treated with Primary Angio-plasty and Intravenous Enoxaparin or Unfractionated Heparin to Lower Ischemic and Bleeding Events at Short and Long-term Follow-up (ATOLL)<sup>185</sup> trial, 910 patients were randomized to treatment with enoxaparin or UFH before PCI. There was a nonsignificant reduction in the major endpoint of 30-day incidence of death, complication of MI, procedure failure, or major bleeding in the enoxaparin group (28% versus 34%; RR = 0.83; 95% CI 0.68–1.01; P=0.06). However, treatment with enoxaparin was associated with a significant reduction in the main secondary endpoint, death, recurrent ACS, or urgent revascularization (30 [7%] versus 52 [11%] patients; RR = 0.59; 95% CI 0.38–0.91; P=0.015).

## LMWH and Platelet GPIIb/IIIa Receptor Antagonist Combination Therapy

The available information, derived from clinical trials of PCI, suggest that anti-Xa activity >0.5 IU/mL is associated with a low incidence of ischemic/thrombotic and hemorrhagic events. 186 The potential benefit of enoxaparin (1 mg/kg every 12 hours) and the platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist, tirofiban (10 mg/kg bolus, 0.1 mg/kg/min for a minimum of 48 hours), compared with weight-adjusted UFH and tirofiban, was investigated in the A to Z trial 187—a prospective, open-label, randomized study of 3987 patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS. Death, recurrent MI, or refractory ischemia at 7 days occurred in 8.4% of enoxaparintreated patients and 9.4% of those receiving UFH (HR 0.88) (criteria for noninferiority satisfied). The RRs were of larger magnitude (favoring enoxaparin) among patients at highest risk and those treated conservatively. Major bleeding was more common in patients receiving enoxaparin (0.9% versus 0.4% with UFH; one excess major hemorrhagic event for every 200 patients treated); however, transfusion rates were low overall (0.9%) and did not differ between groups.

A meta-analysis of clinical trials comparing enoxaparin and UFH for the treatment of ACS was conducted by Murphy and colleagues. A total of 12 trials including patients was analyzed and revealed a numerical reduction in the net clinical endpoint of death or MI, or major bleeding by 30 days favoring enoxaparin (12.5% versus 13.5%, OR 0.9, P=0.051). Death or MI was significantly reduced with enoxaparin as compared to UFH (9.8% versus 11.4%, OR = 0.84, P<0.001), but major bleeding occurred more frequently with enoxaparin (4.3% versus 3.4%, OR = 1.25, P=0.019). The net clinical endpoint was significantly lower with enoxaparin in trials of STEMI (OR = 0.84, P=0.015), but there was no significant difference in NSTEACS trials. (OR = 0.97). <sup>188</sup>

In the Acute Catheterization and Urgent Triage Strategy (ACUITY) trial,<sup>189</sup> 13819 patients with ACS randomly received either bivalirudin plus a GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist, heparin (heparin or enoxaparin) plus a GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist, or bivalirudin alone. The primary outcome, which consisted of all-cause mortality, MI, or unplanned revascularization for ischemia at 30 days, did not differ significantly between groups. Bivalirudin alone was associated with a 50% reduction in major bleeding complications.

## Influence of Renal Function

FXa inhibition pharmacokinetics were studied in 445 patients receiving enoxaparin (1.0–1.25 mg/kg SQ q 12 hours).<sup>190</sup> The mean apparent clearance, distribution volume, and plasma half-life were 0.733 L/h, 5.24 L, and 5 hours, respectively. CrCl emerged as the most important factor affecting apparent clearance, area under the curve, and anti-Xa activity. Clearance was reduced by 22% in patients with CrCl 40 mL/min (compared to patients with normal renal function [CrCl >80 mL/min]). These patients had higher peak and trough anti-Xa activity and were also more likely to experience major hemorrhagic events. Renal performance may not influence pharmacokinetics following single-dose IV administration of enoxaparin.

## Direct Thrombin Inhibitors

The pivotal role of thrombin in all phases of coagulation, cellular proliferation, and cellular interactions involved centrally in inflammatory processes provides an attractive target for pharmacologic inhibition. The development of DTIs has evolved rapidly to include both IV and oral preparations.

## Hirudin

Hirudin is extracted from the parapharyngeal gland of the medicinal leech hirudo medicinalis. Several derivatives and recombinant preparations have been developed including the most widely used agent lepirudin. Hirudin binds to both the catalytic and fibrinogen-binding sites of thrombin and thus is considered a bivalent inhibitor.

## Pharmokinetics

The plasma half-life of hirudin is 50–65 minutes, with a biologic halflife of 2 hours. The properties of heparins, hirudin, and bivalirudin are highlighted in Table 8.11. The predominant renal clearance of hirudin must be emphasized for safe clinical use.

Hirudin forms a tight complex with thrombin, inhibiting the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin as well as thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. <sup>191</sup> These actions are independent of the presence of antithrombin, and also affect thrombin bound to fibrin. On the downside, the ability of thrombin to complex with thrombomodulin, activating protein C, is also inhibited. Hirudin does not bind to platelet factor 4, nor does it elicit antibodies that can cause platelet and endothelial cell activation; thus, it can be safely administered to patients with HIT. Hirudin does have weak immunogenicity, so that diminished (or rarely increased) responsiveness after repeated dosing is possible.

### **Clinical Experience**

In the GUSTO IIb trial, <sup>192</sup> patients with non–ST-segment elevation ACS received either UFH or hirudin (0.1 mg/kg IV bolus, 0.1 mg/kg/h infusion). At 24 hours the risk of death or nonfatal MI was reduced in hirudin-treated patients (1.3% versus 2.1%, P=0.001). The primary endpoint of death or nonfatal MI at 30 days was reached in 8.9% and 9.8% of patients, respectively (OR 0.89, P=0.06). The risk of moderate bleeding was increased with hirudin treatment (8.8% versus 7.7%, P=0.03).

The Organization to Asses Strategies for Ischemic Syndromes (OASIS-1)-1 study<sup>193</sup> included 909 patients with unstable angina or suspected MI without ST segment elevation who were randomized to receive UFH (5000 U bolus, 1000–1200 U/h infusion), low-dose hirudin (0.2 mg/kg bolus, 0.1 mg/kg/h infusion), or moderate-dose hirudin (0.4 mg/kg bolus, 0.15 mg/kg/h infusion). Doses of UFH and hirudin were titrated to a target APTT of 60–100 seconds. Hirudin, compared to UFH, reduced the composite incidence of cardiovascular death, MI, or refractory angina at 7 days (OR 0.57; 95% CI 0.32, 1.02) and a composite of death, MI, or refractory/severe angina requiring revascularization at 7 days (OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.27, 0.86). Overall event rates were lowest in the moderate-dose hirudin group.

The favorable results in OASIS-1 prompted a large phase III trial, OASIS-2, <sup>194</sup> which randomized patients with non–ST-segment elevation ACS to a 72-hour infusion of either moderate-dose hirudin (as defined in OASIS–1) or UFH. The primary outcome (composite of death or MI at 7 and 35 days) was reported in 3.6% and 4.2% of patients (OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.75, 1.01), respectively. Although statistically significant differences between groups were not observed, the combined OASIS-1 and OASIS-2 experience revealed a significant reduction in the likelihood of death or MI

at 35 days among hirudin-treated patients (OR 0.86; 95% CI 0.74–0.99).

Hirudin is almost exclusively excreted through the kidneys, and as a result, renal function must be considered carefully prior to administration. A majority of clinical trials excluded patients with a creatine of 2.0 mg/dl or greater. It is important to acknowledge that even in the setting of mild renal impairment (CrCl 50–80 mL/min), excessive levels of systemic anticoagulation (and accompanying risk for hemorrhage) can occur with nonmodified dosing. If hirudin is administered to patients with renal insufficiency, frequent APTT monitoring is highly recommended.

### Bivalirudin

Bivalirudin is a 20-amino-acid-long synthetic peptide with thrombin-specific anticoagulant properties. Bivalirudin reversibly binds thrombin, free as well as clot bound, at the catalytic site and the anion-binding exosite, thereby preventing the formation and activation of fibrin, FXIIIa, and other coagulation factors.

## Pharmacodynamics

Bivalirudin is an intravenous, direct, and reversible inhibitor of thrombin that acts through binding both to the catalytic and anion-binding exosite. It prolongs the thrombin, aPTT, and PT in a concentration-dependent manner.

## Pharmacokinetics

Following a 1-mg/kg IV bolus, peak concentration is achieved rapidly, with a plasma half-life of 25 minutes among patients with normal renal function. Drug elimination is reduced by 20% in the setting of moderate renal impairment, 50% in several renal impairment, and 80% in dialysis-dependent patients. The drugs pharmacokinetic characteristics translate to half-lives of 34 minutes, 57 minutes, and 3.5 hours, respectively.

### Clinical Experience

Bivalirudin is FDA approved for use in patients with non–STsegment elevation ACS undergoing PCI. The basis for approval stems from several large-scale clinical trials.<sup>195</sup> Among 4312 patients with new-onset, severe, accelerating or rest angina undergoing PCI, a 22% reduction in death, MI, or urgent revascularization at 7 days was observed in those given bivalirudin compared with UFH (6.2% versus 7.9%, <sup>P</sup> <sup>¼</sup> 0.03). The absolute and relative differences were maintained at 90 days. A marked reduction (62%) in bleeding complications among bivalirudin-treated patients was also reported.

In the Randomized Evaluation in Percutaneous coronary intervention Linking Angiomax to reduced Clinical Events (REPLACE-1) trial, <sup>196</sup> 1020 patients received either bivalirudin (0.75 mg/kg bolus, 1.75 mg/kg/h infusion) or UFH. Prior treatment with aspirin and a thienopyridine was encouraged in anticipation of stenting. A platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist was administered to 71% of patients. Bivalirduin was associated with a 19% reduction in the clinical endpoint of death, MI, urgent revascularization, and bleeding complications (minor, major, transfusions) at 48 hours.

REPLACE-2<sup>197</sup> randomized 6010 patients undergoing urgent or

elective PCI to bivalirudin plus provisional GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist (abciximab or eptifibatide) administration or UFH plus a GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist. Aspirin and clopidogrel pretreatment were recommended. Approximately 45% of patients had either unstable angina or MI (within the prior 7 days). The composite of death, MI, and urgent revascularization at 30 days occurred in 7.1% of heparin and 7.6% of bivalirudin-treated patients (OR 0.917; 95% CI 0.772, 1.089; P = 0.32). Major bleeding was documented in 4.1% and 2.4% of patients, respectively (P = 0.001). Minor bleeding (25.7% versus 13.4%, P = 0.001) and thrombocytopenia (<100,000)mm<sup>3</sup>) (1.7% versus 0.7%, P < 0.001) were also less common with bivalirudin treatment. GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist therapy was given to 7.2% of patients randomized to bivalirudin.

### **Bivalirudin in STEMI**

The HORIZONS-AMI<sup>198</sup> trial examined the use of bivalirudin in 3600 patients with STEMI. Patients were randomized to either heparin 60 U/kg IV, subsequently titrated to ACT of 200–250 seconds plus a GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor (abciximab or eptifibatide), or to bivalirudin monotherapy (0.75 mg/kg bolus; infusion 1.75 mg/kg/h) stopped at the end of the procedure plus provisional GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors for large thrombus or refractory no-flow. Net adverse clinical events, the primary endpoint, were 9.2% in the bivalirudin group and 12.1% in the UFH-GPIIb/IIIa group (P < 0.0001 for noninferiority, and P = 0.006 for superiority). In addition to the observed decrease in net adverse clinical events, there was a corresponding decrease in major bleeding with bivalirudin (4.9% versus 8.3%,  $P = \le 0.001$ for noninferiority and  $P \le 0.0001$  for superiority).

## **Impact of Renal Insufficiency**

Patients with moderate and severe renal impairment have reductions in bivalirudin clearance; however, analysis of data derived from 4312 patients with unstable angina showed increased bleeding risk for both bivalirudin and UFH-treated patients with progressive degrees of renal insufficiency. The incidence of major bleeding was, however, consistently less for bivalirudin than UFH at all levels of renal impairment.

The overall data suggest that a bivalirudin dose adjustment is indicated for patients with moderate or severe renal impairment. In a retrospective study of 73 patients with renal dysfunction treated with bivalirudin for HIT with or without ACS, the average bivalirudin dose (mg/kg/h) achieving a therapeutic aPTT was 0.07 0.04, 0.15 0.08, and 0.16 0.07 mg/kg/h for patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (by Cockcroft-Gault) between 15–30, 31–60, and >60 mL/min, respectively. When renal function was calculated by modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD), the average bivalirudin dose achieving a therapeutic APTT was 0.07 0.04, 0.12 0.07, and 0.20 0.07 mg/kg/h for patients with an eGFR between 15–30, 31–60, and >60 mL/min, respectively. Taken together, these data further suggest the bivalirudin dose adjustment should be considered in patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency.<sup>199</sup>

Alternatively, the encouraging results from REPLACE-2 may provide an opportunity for reducing hemorrhagic risk in patients with renal insufficiency by virtue of the short infusion length for bivalirudin administration and provisional use of GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonists (which may themselves increase the risk of hemorrhage in this high risk patient subset). The use of bivalirudin among individuals with and those at risk for HIT who require PCI is favored (over argatroban) by many interventional cardiologists based on experience in the angioplasty suite and comparative analyses among patients with ACS.

## Argatroban

Argatroban is a synthetic direct thrombin inhibitor derived from L-arginine that acts through binding reversely to the active site of thrombin. There was a linear relationship between argatroban plasma levels and prolongations of the thrombin time, aPTT, and PT.

## Pharmacokinetics

Peak concentrations of Argatroban are reached rapidly after IV injection, with a plasma half-life ranging between 39 and 51 minutes. Metabolism occurs in the liver by hydroxylation and aromotization via CYP3A4/5.

## **Clinical Experience**

Argatroban is approved for use among patients with HIT, including those with current HIT, previous HIT, and/or those with heparindependent antibodies.

# **Comparative Benefits of Direct Thrombin Inhibitors**

A meta-analysis of clinical trials was performed to obtain additional information and precise estimates of DTIs in the management of ACS. 200 A total of 11 randomized trials including patients were identified. Compared with UFH, DTIs were associated with a lower risk of death or MI at the end of treatment (up to 7 days) (4.3% versus 5.1%; OR 0.85; 95% CI 0.77 0.94; P = 0.001) and at30 days (7.4% versus 8.2%; OR 0.91; 95% CI 0.84, 0.99; P = 0.02). There were seven trials, including patients with either an ACS (unstable angina or NSTEMI) or undergoing PCI. In those with ACS, treatment with a direct thrombin inhibitor was associated with a reduction in death or MI compared to UFH (3.7% versus 4.6%; OR 0.80; 95% CI 0.70, 0.92). Similar reductions were observed in PCI trials (3.0% versus 3.8%; OR 0.79; 95% CI 0.59, 1.06). There was a statistically insignificant increased rate of major bleeding with DTIs in trials of ACS (1.6% versus 1.4%; OR 1.11; 95% CI 0.93, 1.34), but there was a significant difference in PCI trials (3.7% versus 7.6%; OR 0.46; 95% CI 0.36, 0.59). There were no differences in the rates of intracranial hemorrhage.

The risk reduction in death or MI at the end of treatment was similar in trials comparing hirudin or bivalirudin with UFH, but there was a slight excess with univalent inhibitors (4.7% versus 3.5%; OR 1.35; 95% CI 0.89, 2.05). When major bleeding outcomes were analyzed by agent, hirudin was associated with an excess of major bleeding compared with UFH (1.7% versus 1.3%; OR 1.28; 95% CI 1.06, 1.55), whereas both bivalirudin (4.2% versus 9.0%; OR 0.55; 95% CI 0.34, 0.56) and univalent inhibitors (0.7% versus 1.3%; OR 0.55; 95% CI 0.25, 1.20) were associated with lower rates of major bleeding.

# **Dosing Strategies: An Opportunity for Improved Safety**

In a prospective observational analysis of patients with non–ST-segment elevation ACS, 42% received an initial dose of either UFH, LMWH or a LMWH or a GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist outside the recommended range of dosing. Patient characteristics

associated with excess drug dosing including older age, female sex, low body weight, renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and congestive heart failure. Excess antithrombotic drug dosing was associated with major bleeding complication, increased hospital length, and higher mortality.<sup>201</sup>

## Bleeding and Outcomes in ACS

Although bleeding has always been considered an important safety concern for patients with ACS or undergoing PCI, only recently have the long-term effects of bleeding on mortality been explored. In a meta-analysis of four multicenter, randomized clinical trials of patients with NSTEMI demonstrated increases in 30-day mortality with increasing bleeding severity (HR for 30 day mortality by mild, moderate, or severe bleeding 1.6 [1.3–1.9], 2.7 [2.3–3.4], and 10.6 [8.3–13.6]).202 Six-month mortality by mild, moderate, and severe bleeding was also increased (HR by mild, moderate, or severe bleeding 1.4 [1.2–1.6], 2.1 [1.8–2.4], and 7.5 [6.1–9.3]). Subsequently, a study by Eikelboom et al. analyzing aggregate data from other ACS trials confirmed a dose-related association between bleeding and death in ACS patients.203 Although the exact contribution of bleeding to overall mortality in ACS remains undefined, the OASIS-5 trial, which investigated fondaparinux versus enoxaparin in ACS demonstrated a reduction in bleeding associated with fondaparinux. More importantly, this reduction in bleeding was associated with reduced overall mortality. The authors subsequently concluded that bleeding is an important predictor of outcomes in ACS. Although not fully understood, several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the association of bleeding with mortality in ACS. Certainly, the hemodynamic effects associated with massive bleeding might result in higher mortality. Likewise, mass effect from intracranial bleeding would be expected to cause higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Even lesser levels of bleeding, however, have been shown to increase levels of neurohormones, such as norepinephrine, angiotensin, endothelin-1, and vasopressin, in order to maintain blood pressure. These neurohormones have been associated with cardiac events.

In addition to the neurohormonal activation associated with bleeding, measures taken as a result of bleeding, including discontinuation of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy, may paradoxically increase mortality. In the GRACE registry of ACS patients, those with bleeding complications more frequently had antithrombotic therapy, including aspirin, thienopyridines, and heparin, discontinued. Discontinuation of aspirin, thienopyridines, or UFH in the setting of major bleeding resulted in higher in-hospital mortality rates.204 Given that patients with ACS and those undergoing PCI are in a heightened state of platelet activation and thrombosis, withholding antithrombotic therapy may result in activation of the coagulation system and potential stent thrombosis.

## Reversal and Replacement Therapy for Parenteral Anticoagulants

The approach to major or life-threatening hemorrhage among patients receiving parenteral anticoagulants requires an understanding of drug pharmacology, mechanism(s) or action, and potential risks of reversal or replacement therapy. For unfractionated heparin, protamine sulfate (12.5–50 mg IV) is the drug of choice (1 mg protamine sulfate will neutralize 100 units of UFH). For LMWH, protamine sulfate (0.5–1.0 mg for every 1 mg of LMWH given within the past 8 hours) is recommended. It is important to recognize that protamine sulfate will neutralize approximately 40%–50% of LMWH-specifically the factor IIa effect. Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) can be given for refractory bleeding. While andexanet alfa was designed as a universal FX anticoagulant reversal agent, potentially including fondaparinux, the current FDA labeling does not include either LMWH or very low MWH reversal.

The approach to parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors, in addition to supportive measures, includes PCC and recombinant FVII for refractory bleeding. The use of idarucizumab, a reversal agent specifically designed to reverse dabigatran's anticoagulant effect, is not recommended and would not be expected to have an effect.

## Oral Anticoagulant Drugs

Common indications for oral anticoagulant medications include stroke prophylaxis in patients with atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation, thrombosis prophylaxis in patients with mechanical heart valves, treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism, and thromboembolism prophylaxis in specific patient populations including those with a known heritable or acquired thrombophilias.

## Pharmacokinetics and Drug Disposition

#### Summary of pharmacokinetic properties and characteristics for oral direct thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors

- Dabigatran: Vd is 60–70 L consistent with moderate tissue distribution. Limited data available on extremes of body weight. Patients weighing 50 kg had notably higher trough concentrations compared to those weighing 100 kg in RE-LY. No current recommendations for dose modification based on body weight
- Rivaroxaban: Vd is 50 L, with moderate tissue distribution. Extremes in body weight (50 or 120 kg) did not (25%) influence exposure; no dosage adjustment recommended
- Apixaban: Vd is 21 L, small with limited distribution, primarily to blood. Extremes in weight (B50 and C120 kg) have a modest effect on apixaban exposure and do not alter the apixaban plasma concentration and anti-Xa activity relationship. Dose reduction is recommended only if weight is B 60 kg and pt is either C 80 years old or serum creatinine C 1.5 mg/dL
- Dabigatran has low oral bioavailability (6%–7%). High doses (150 mg) are administered to overcome low-bioavailability Tartaric acid present in dabigatran etexilate enhances absorption and minimizes variations in acidic environment Rivaroxaban has dose dependent oral bioavailability (80%–100%) at 10 mg, 66 % at 20 mg
- Oral bioavailability of apixaban is 50% for doses up to 10 mg
- Coadministration of dabigatran etexilate with food has no effect on the extent of dabigatran absorption; it may be administered with or without meals
- Rivaroxaban coadministration with a meal moderately improves bioavailability of the 15 and 20 mg doses; must be administered with a meal. Medications that alter gastric pH do not modify the PK of rivaroxaban, but gastric site of release is important for adequate drug exposure
- Apixaban displays prolonged absorption; food does not affect bioavailability. Absorption occurs throughout the GI tract
- Absorption (bowel): Until absorbed and bioconverted to dabigatran, dabigatran etexilate is a substrate for P-gp efflux transporter and should not be coadministered with inducers of P-gp
- Rivaroxaban is a substrate for efflux transporters P-gp and BCRP/ABCG2. Coadministration of inhibitors or inducers of these transporters may result in changes in rivaroxaban exposure
- Apixaban is a substrate for efflux transporters P-gp (minimal) and BCRP/ ABCG2
- Liver: Dabigatran undergoes hepatic phase II glucuronidation; up to 20% hepatic biotransformation. No significant CYP role, no interaction with drug transporters once bioconverted to parent compound. Large interpatient variability when administered in the presence of moderate hepatic impairment
- Rivaroxaban undergoes moderate hepatic biotransformation. Cautious use in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, contraindicated with

moderate hepatic impairment and coagulopathy. Rivaroxaban is a substrate for CYP 3A4/5, CYP 2J2, and efflux transporters P-gp and BCRP/ ABCG2. Avoid coadministration of rivaroxaban with combined P-gp and strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors. Affinity for influx (uptake transporters is unknown)

Hepatic biotransformation appears responsible for approximately one third of apixaban drug elimination. No clear understanding of the impact of moderate hepatic impairment; severe hepatic impairment not studied. Apixaban is a substrate for CYP 3A4, P-gp, and BCRP/ABCG2. Coadministration of apixaban with strong dual inducers of CYP 3A4 and P-gp is not recommended. Dose reduction is needed if administered with strong dual inhibitors

Kidney: Dabigatran: Important role of renal function for elimination. Dose reduction is necessary when CrCl is B 30 mL/min.

Limited clinical outcome data in this population. No recommendations for use when CrCl is 15 mL/min or in setting of HD. No anticipated interactions with efflux transporters (P-gp) at the kidney

Rivaroxaban: Important role of renal function for elimination of drug. Dose reduction is recommended when CrCl is 15–50 mL/min. Potential interactions with efflux transporters P-gp and BCRP/ABCG2 at kidney of unknown clinical consequence

Apixaban: Renal excretion accounts for elimination of approximately one-third of a dose. Recommendations include dose reduction if serum creatinine is C 1.5 mg/dL AND pt is either C 80 years age or B 60 kg body weight. Potential interactions with efflux transporters (P-gp and BCRP/ ABCG2) at kidney of unknown clinical consequence.

incorporates a balance of desired and undesirable medication effects. The magnitudes of both the desired response and toxicity are functions of drug concentration at the site or sites of action.<sup>205</sup> A thorough understanding of medication-specific pharmacokinetic features and potential interactions is essential for optimal prescribing and patient outcome. Medication-specific differences in anticoagulant absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination as well as disease-specific or condition-specific variations in these fundamental processes govern safe and effective use in clinical practice. Specifically, differences in bioavailability, distribution (including protein binding), metabolism (including CYP450), and route of elimination may significantly influence drug response. Membrane transporters have become recognized determinants of the pharmacokinetic disposition of many drugs. A growing number of membrane transporters have been characterized, with a clinically translatable focus on their expression in the epithelial tissue of intestine, liver, kidney, and blood-brain barrier and how they modulate bioavailability and anticoagulant activity. The full impact of the growing number of transporters (both efflux and uptake) is unknown at present; however, the role of efflux transporters, specifically permeability glycoprotein (P-gp), is routinely evaluated and documented for many medications in preclinical studies.<sup>206</sup> All oral anticoagulants presented in this review demonstrate that P-gp interactions to some extent have an impact on drug disposition, notably by interaction with other P-gp modulators. Drug substrates for both CYP450 3A4 isoenzyme and P-gp are more likely involved in major drug interactions than drugs that are substrates for only one system. Pertinent drug interactions related to P-gp and CYP450 are summarized in Table 8.18.

The bioavailability of the oral anticoagulants varies widely. For some drugs, the bioavailability changes with coadministration of food. For example, the bioavailability of rivaroxaban (20-mg dose) is 66%.<sup>207</sup> Coadministration of rivaroxaban with food increases the bioavailability of a 20-mg dose, as measured by mean AUC by 39% and Cmax by 76%. Accordingly, the 15-mg and 20-mg dosage strengths of rivaroxaban should be taken with food (typically the largest meal of the day), and current recommendations suggest administration with the evening meal. The bioavailability of the 10-mg dosage strength is 80% to 100% and does not require food to achieve sufficient concentrations for effective anticoagulation. As such, use of 10-mg rivaroxaban daily for reduction of risk of recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or PE in patients with continued risk, or for prophylaxis of DVT after hip or knee replacement, may be taken with or without food. By contrast, coadministration of food reduces the bioavailability of betrixaban. The oral bioavailability of betrixaban is 34%; however, consuming a highfat meal prior to betrixaban administration results in a reduction in both the AUC and Cmax by 50%, and a reduction in AUC and Cmax of 70% and 61%, respectively, for a low-fat meal. At this time, labeled administration recommendations are that betrixaban be taken at the same time each day with food.<sup>208</sup>

The volume of distribution (Vd) varies considerably across the oral anticoagulants. This parameter is a function of drug lipophilicity/tissue affinity, plasma and tissue protein binding affinity, and the presence of active drug transporters on barrier tissues (kidney and liver). The differences in Vd explain the extent of tissue distribution of different anticoagulants; however, insufficient

information is available at this time to estimate the clinical impact of this difference with respect to patient outcomes.

Finally, drug elimination represents a clinically important variable for consideration when initiating and monitoring anticoagulant therapy. Drug elimination is the process of irreversible removal of drug from the body by all routes of elimination, including biotransformation (metabolism) and drug excretion. Enzymes involved in biotransformation are located primarily in the liver where common routes of metabolism include oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, and conjugation.

The CYP450 system is a family of enzymes responsible for most drug metabolism oxidation reactions. Many isoenzymes within this family exist and their role in the metabolism of medications is well established. Although hepatic disease or impairment may result in loss of function that reduces metabolism or elimination of drugs, it is difficult to know when these changes are clinically important, and recommendations regarding modification of dosing in the setting of hepatic impairment are nonspecific and difficult to apply.<sup>209</sup> Understanding the primary route of metabolism and elimination may assist in the selection of preferred anticoagulant therapy.

In addition to metabolism and biotransformation, drugs are eliminated by excretion into bile or into urine. The processes by which a drug is excreted by the kidneys may include any combination of glomerular filtration, active tubular secretion, or tubular reabsorption. In the presence of renal disease, both glomerular filtration and renal tubular secretion can decrease, impairing the renal clearance of drugs and their metabolites. The degree to which impairment in these processes prolongs the presence or half-life of a drug, potentially extending the pharmacodynamics effect, is dependent on the proportion of drug excreted by the renal route of elimination and the extent of renal impairment. Knowledge of anticoagulant-specific reliance on the renal route of elimination can guide preferred treatment choices and tailor individualized monitoring plans.

## Detailed Summary of Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics

#### Dabigatran

Dabigatran has low oral bioavailability estimated to be 6%–7%. To overcome this potential barrier, high doses of its prodrug, dabigatran etexilate, are given. The chemical characteristics of the prodrug (less basic and less hydrophilic) facilitates intestinal absorption. In addition, to promote an acidic environment required for dabigatran etexilate absorption, the drug is packaged in capsules containing tartaric acid. Dabigatran is layered onto sealcoated spherical tartaric acid starter cores. While this feature improves drug dissolution and limits any role of variation in individual gastric pH, it may be the source of dyspepsia associated with dabigatran therapy. Removal of the drug pellets from the capsule shell results in a 75% increase in dabigatran etexilate bioavailability, compared to the intact capsule formulation. Modification of this delivery system (chewing, breaking, or opening the capsule) is not recommended. During and following absorption, dabigatran etexilate is converted to its active metabolite, dabigatran, by hydrolysis in the enterocytes, portal vein, and liver leaving minimal prodrug or intermediates detectable in plasma.<sup>210</sup> Dabigatran is not a substrate of any drug transporter investigated; however, dabigatran etexilate is a substrate with moderate affinity for P-gp transport system. Although minimal drug interactions are expected, the potential for clinically relevant drug interactions of dabigatran exists only during the absorption phase when administered with other modulators of P-gp activity. Coadministration of dabigatran with both inducers (rifampin) of P-gp and inhibitors of P-gp (ketoconazole, amiodarone, verapamil, quinidine) results in considerable changes in dabigatran exposure, Cmax and AUC. A population pharmacokinetic analysis of the Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy (RE-LY) trial demonstrated concomitant administration of proton pump inhibitors, amiodarone, and verapamil significantly affected oral bioavailability of dabigatran, however the result was only a moderate effect (23%) on change in steady state exposure (increased or decreased).<sup>211</sup> It is recommended that coadministration of dabigatran with rifampin should be avoided. Current US labeling for dabigatran recommends reducing the dose of dabigatran when coadministered with systemic ketoconazole, and to avoid its use completely in patients with severe renal impairment receiving inhibitors of P-gp.

#### Rivaroxaban

Rivaroxaban is administered as a film-coated tablet with a bioavailability that is dose-dependent. The effect of food on rivaroxaban absorption was evaluated in healthy male subjects.<sup>212</sup> In two interaction studies, subjects received either two 5 mg tablets (fasted and fed) and four 5 mg tablets (fasted), or one 20 mg tablet (fasted and fed). In this study, Cmax and AUC were increased, and interindividual variability decreased at higher doses of rivaroxaban in the presence of food.<sup>213</sup> In general, administration of medication with food prolongs residence time in the stomach secondary to reduced gastric motility after a meal, and possibly increases both solubility and dissolution. In the case of rivaroxaban, the improved rate and extent of absorption observed with food is likely attributable to lipophilicity and improved solubility from its baseline nearly insoluble form. Medications that alter gastric pH do not modify the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban; however gastric site of drug release is important for rivaroxaban absorption. Rivaroxaban exposure is reduced when the drug is released in the proximal small intestine, and even further reduced if released in the distal small intestine or ascending colon. Alternative strategies for oral administration (feeding tubes) of rivaroxaban that deliver drug to any site beyond the stomach should be avoided. Rivaroxaban is a substrate for P-gp and the ATP-binding cassette transporter protein, breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP), gene symbol ABCG2.214 Like P-gp, BCRP is a transporter protein with localized tissue distribution on the apical surface of epithelial cells, found at relatively high levels in the blood–brain barrier, placenta, liver, gut, and kidney, and is increasingly recognized for the ability to modulate absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of xenobiotics in these tissues. Existing interaction studies involving BCRP drug interactions have focused primarily on the multidrug resistance (MDR) effects in oncology; however, naturally occurring flavonoids have demonstrated inhibition of BCRP-mediated transport, particularly chrysin and biochanin A, found commonly in food sources of broccoli, celery, chili peppers, and soy products.<sup>215</sup> While inhibitors or inducers of this transporter protein (BCRP) may result in changes in rivaroxaban exposure, the overall clinical impact is unknown. Drug interaction studies evaluating the concomitant use of rivaroxaban with drugs that are combined P-gp and CYP 3A4 inhibitors have demonstrated an increase in rivaroxaban exposure. The pharmacodynamic effects (FXa inhibition and PT prolongation) of this exposure may increase bleeding risk, and concomitant administration of ketoconazole, itraconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir, indinavir/ ritonavir, and conivaptan is not recommended.

#### Apixaban

Apixaban has been studied in PK/PD studies and multiple clinical trials.<sup>216</sup> Existing pharmacokinetic studies of apixaban have demonstrated good oral bioavailability, with 50% of a dose absorbed in humans. Food does not affect the bioavailability of apixaban. After oral administration, apixaban is absorbed throughout the GI tract, with approximately half of the drug absorbed in the distal small bowel and ascending colon. In human liver and hepatocytes, apixaban demonstrates insignificant metabolic clearance. The primary metabolite identified is formed by CYP 3A4 in human liver microsomes, but there are nonactive circulating metabolites. Apixaban has low potential to inhibit or induce CYP, or to form reactive metabolites, and the drug interaction potential is accordingly low. Apixaban is a substrate of the transport proteins P-gp and BCRP (ABCG2). The identification of apixaban as a substrate for P-gp is consistent with observed changes in apixaban AUC and Cmax when coadministered with strong inhibitors (ketoconazole) and inducers (rifampin) of both P-gp and CYP 3A4. Current recommendations include a reduction in apixaban dose when coadministered with drugs that are strong dual inhibitors of CYP 3A4 and P-gp: ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin.

#### Edoxaban

The pharmacokinetics of edoxaban in healthy volunteers have been described in single- and multiple-dose administration studies.<sup>217</sup> Edoxaban tablets and powder for oral solution have been evaluated and demonstrated similar bioavailability. Coadministration of edoxaban with food results in a modest but clinically insignificant effect of food on edoxaban pharmacokinetics. The absolute bioavailability of edoxaban following a single oral dose is 60%. Edoxaban is a substrate for CYP 3A4 and also P-gp.218 Simulations based on PK/PD models support halving the prescribed dose of edoxaban for those patients taking strong inhibitors of P-gp, including ketoconazole, erythromycin, azithromycin, quinidine, verapamil, and dronedarone. In an exposure–response analysis of edoxaban administration to patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), coadministration of edoxaban with strong inhibitors of P-gp increased edoxaban exposure. In this analysis, the incidence of bleeding events increased significantly with increasing edoxaban exposure, which was best characterized by edoxaban minimum concentrations at steady state (Cmin,ss).

Absorption of drugs from the intestinal lumen is a complex process influenced by physiochemical properties of the medications, as well as physiological factors in the GI tract. Existing data suggest the presence of uptake and efflux transporters in the GI tract play an important role in drug absorption, display genetic variability, and should be considered in drug-to-drug interactions. In total, these factors may contribute to individual variation in drug absorption and, potentially, response.

#### Betrixaban

Betrixaban is an oral anticoagulant that exerts its action by preventing thrombin generation without having a direct effect on platelet aggregation. Betrixaban presents a rapid absorption at a dose of 80 mg. Its peak plasma concentration is registered within 3–4 hours after oral administration in healthy humans. The oral bioavailability is 34% and it can be reduced with consumption of high-fat food. Betrixaban is an orally active inhibitor of coagulation FXa (activated FX) with anticoagulant activity. Betrixaban is primarily excreted unchanged in the bile and has a half-life of about 19 hours.

#### Dabigatran

**Pharmacodynamics.** Dabigatran etexilate is a prodrug that undergoes conversion to dabigatran, a small molecule direct-thrombin inhibitor capable of reversibly binding thrombin. Gl absorption of the prodrug is dependent on a low pH, and peak plasma concentrations are achieved between 2 and 3 hours after ingestion.

#### **Pharmacokinetics**

The half-life of dabigatran is 12–17 hours and is 80% renally excreted. Because prodrug and drug metabolism is independent of CYP450, the drug is considered relatively safe in moderate liver disease but must be used with caution in patients with significant renal dysfunction.  $^{210}$ 

#### **Clinical Experience**

Venous thromboembolism. In the RE-Cover trial<sup>219a</sup> a randomized, double-blind, noninferiority trial involving patients with acute venous thromboembolism who were initially given parenteral anticoagulation therapy for a median of 9 days (interquartile range, 8-11), we compared oral dabigatran, administered at a dose of 150 mg twice daily, with warfarin that was dose-adjusted to achieve an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0-3.0. The primary outcome was the 6-month incidence of recurrent symptomatic, objectively confirmed venous thromboembolism and related deaths. Safety endpoints included bleeding events, acute coronary syndromes, other adverse events, and results of liver function tests. A total of 30 of the 1274 patients randomly assigned to receive dabigatran (2.4%), as compared with 27 of the 1265 patients randomly assigned to warfarin (2.1%), had recurrent venous thromboembolism; the difference in risk was 0.4 percentage points (95% CI - 0.8 - 1.5; P < 0.001 for the prespecified noninferiority margin). The HR with dabigatran was 1.10 (95% CI 0.65–1.84). Major bleeding episodes occurred in 20 patients assigned to dabigatran (1.6%) and in 24 patients assigned to warfarin (1.9%) (HR with dabigatran 0.82; 95% CI 0.45-1.48), and episodes of any bleeding were observed in 205 patients assigned to dabigatran (16.1%) and 277 patients assigned to warfarin (21.9%; HR with dabigatran 0.71; 95% CI 0.59–0.85). The numbers of deaths, acute coronary syndromes, and abnormal liver function tests were similar in the two groups. Adverse events leading to discontinuation of the study drug occurred in 9.0% of patients assigned to dabigatran and in 6.8% of patients assigned to warfarin (P = 0.05). For the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism, a fixed dose of dabigatran is as effective as warfarin and has a safety profile that is similar to that of warfarin.

In two double-blind, randomized trials (RE-MEDY and RE-SONATE studies<sup>219a,219b</sup>), dabigatran at a dose of 150 mg twice daily with warfarin (active-control study) was compared with placebo (placebo-control study) in patients with venous thromboembolism who had completed at least 3 initial months of therapy. In the activecontrol study, recurrent venous thromboembolism occurred in 26 of 1430 patients in the dabigatran group (1.8%) and 18 of 1426 patients in the warfarin group (1.3%) (HR with dabigatran 1.44; 95% CI 0.78–2.64; P = 0.01 for noninferiority). Major bleeding occurred in 13 patients in the dabigatran group (0.9%) and 25 patients in the warfarin group (1.8%) (HR 0.52; 95% CI 0.27–1.02). Major or clinically relevant bleeding was less frequent with dabigatran (HR 0.54; 95% CI 0.41-0.71). Acute coronary syndromes occurred in 13 patients in the dabigatran group (0.9%) and 3 patients in the warfarin group (0.2%) (P = 0.02). In the placebocontrol study, recurrent venous thromboembolism occurred in 3 of 681 patients in the dabigatran group (0.4%) and 37 of 662 patients in the placebo group (5.6%) (HR 0.08; 95% CI 0.02-0.25; P < 0.001). Major bleeding occurred in two patients in the dabigatran group (0.3%) and zero patients in the placebo group. Major or clinically relevant bleeding occurred in 36 patients in the dabigatran group (5.3%) and 12 patients in the placebo group (1.8%) (HR 2.92; 95% CI 1.52 –5.60). Acute coronary syndromes occurred in one patient each in the dabigatran and placebo groups.

#### **Atrial Fibrillation**

In the RE-LY study, a total of patients with nonvalvular AF and a mean CHADS $_2$  score of 2.1 were randomized to either of two doses of dabigatran (110 mg twice daily or 150 mg twice daily) versus open-label warfarin for the secondary prevention of stroke and thromboembolism. The trial had a 1.69% event rate of stroke or systemic embolism in the warfarin arm versus 1.53% in the 110 mg BID dabigatran arm (P < 0.001 for noninferiority) and 1.11% in the 150 mg BID dabigatran arm (P < 0.001) for superiority. The rate of major bleeding, defined as a reduction in hemoglobin of at least 20 g/L, transfusion of 2 units of blood, or symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, was lower in the 110 mg dabigatran arm (2.71% versus 3.36% per year with warfarin, P = 0.003) and

similar to warfarin in the 150 mg BID dabigatran arm (3.11% versus 3.36% per year with warfarin, P = 0.31).

Several subgroup analyses of RELY have been published. An analysis of 1270 patients undergoing cardioversion showed low stroke rates (0.8% for 110 mg BID, 0.3% for 150 mg BID, and 0.6% for warfarin, respectively). Transesophageal echocardiograms (TEEs) performed in conjunction with cardioversion showed a similarly low incidence of atrial thrombi (1.8% for 110 mg BID, 0.3% for 150 mg BID, and 0.6% for warfarin). Dabigatran has been FDA-approved in both a 150-mg dose and, based solely on pharmacodynamics studies, a 75-mg dose for use in patients with CrCl of 15–30 mL/min.

#### **Ablation**

In RE-CIRCUIT, <sup>222</sup> patients scheduled for catheter ablation (CA) for paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation were randomly assigned to receive either dabigatran (150 mg twice daily) or warfarin (target INR, 2.0-3.0). Ablation was performed after 4–8 weeks of uninterrupted anticoagulation, which was then continued for 8 weeks after ablation. The primary endpoint was the incidence of major bleeding events during and up to 8 weeks after ablation; secondary endpoints included thromboembolic and other bleeding events. The trial enrolled 704 patients, and 635 patients underwent ablation. The incidence of major bleeding events during and up to 8 weeks after ablation was lower with dabigatran than with warfarin (5 patients [1.6%] versus 22 patients [6.9%]; absolute risk difference -5.3 percentage points; 95% CI -8.4 to -2.2; P < 0.001). Dabigatran was associated with fewer periprocedural pericardial tamponade events and access site hematomas than warfarin. One thromboembolic event occurred in the warfarin group.

#### Bleeding With Dabigatran in AF

Although treatment with dabigatran 110 mg, but not 150 mg, was associated with a significant reduction in the primary safety endpoint of major bleeding, both doses were associated with fewer intracranial bleeds than warfarin (warfarin 0.76% per year versus dabigatran 110 mg BID: 0.23% per year [RR 0.30; 95% CI 0.19–0.45], and dabigatran 150 mg BID: 0.32% per year [RR 0.41; 95% CI 0.28–0.60]). 223 Dabigatran 150 mg BID was associated with a significant increase in GI bleeding (1.56%) as compared to warfarin (1.07% per year; RR 1.48; 95% CI 1.18–1.85) and dabigatran 110 mg BID (1.15% per year: RR 1.36; 95% CI 1.09–1.70). 223 Renal insufficiency and combined administration with aspirin

increased bleeding risk, though this was independent of anticoagulant and dose.  $^{224}\,$ 

#### Rivaroxaban

**Pharmacodynamics.** Rivaroxaban exerts its anticoagulant effect by direct, reversible binding to FXa.

#### **Pharmacokinetics**

Oral administration results in 60%–80% bioavailability, and peak plasma concentrations occur at about 3 hours. In patients with normal renal and hepatic function, rivaroxaban's plasma half-life is between 5 and 9 hours.  $^{225}$ 

#### **Clinical Experience**

**Venous thromboembolism.** In the EINSTEIN DVT study, <sup>226</sup> oral rivaroxaban alone (15 mg twice daily for 3 weeks, followed by 20 mg once daily) was compared with SQ enoxaparin followed by a vitamin K antagonist (either warfarin or acenocoumarol) for, or 12 months in patients with acute, symptomatic DVT. In parallel, a double-blind, randomized, event-driven superiority study was undertaken that compared rivaroxaban alone (20 mg once daily) with placebo for an additional 6 or 12 months in patients who had completed months of treatment for venous thromboembolism. The primary efficacy outcome for both studies was recurrent venous thromboembolism. The principal safety outcome was major bleeding or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding in the initial-treatment study and major bleeding in the continuedtreatment study. 226 The study of rivaroxaban for acute DVT included 3449 patients: 1731 given rivaroxaban and 1718 given enoxaparin plus a vitamin K antagonist. Rivaroxaban had noninferior efficacy with respect to the primary outcome (36 events [2.1%] versus 51 events with enoxaparin-vitamin K antagonist [3.0%]; HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.44–1.04; P < 0.001). The principal safety outcome occurred in 8.1% of the patients in each group. In the continued-treatment study, which included 602 patients in the rivaroxaban group and 594 in the placebo group, rivaroxaban had superior efficacy (8 events [1.3%] versus 42 with placebo [7.1%]; HR 0.18:95% CI 0.09-0.39; P < 0.001). Four patients in the rivaroxaban group had nonfatal major bleeding (0.7%), versus none in the placebo group (P = 0.11).

In the EINSTEIN PE study, <sup>227</sup> 4832 patients who had acute symptomatic PE with or without DVT were randomly assigned to receive rivaroxaban (15 mg twice daily for 3 weeks, followed by 20 mg once daily) or standard therapy with enoxaparin followed by an adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist for, or 12 months. The primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent venous

thromboembolism. The principal safety outcome was major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding.

Rivaroxaban was noninferior to standard therapy (noninferiority margin, 2.0; P=0.003) for the primary efficacy outcome, with 50 events in the rivaroxaban group (2.1%) versus 44 events in the standard-therapy group (1.8%) (HR 1.12; 95% CI 0.75–1.68). The principal safety outcome occurred in 10.3% of patients in the rivaroxaban group and 11.4% of those in the standard-therapy group (HR 0.90; 95% CI 0.76–1.07; P=0.23). Major bleeding was observed in 26 patients (1.1%) in the rivaroxaban group and 52 patients (2.2%) in the standard-therapy group (HR 0.49; 95% CI 0.31–0.79; P=0.003). Rates of other adverse events were similar in the two groups.

A fixed-dose regimen of rivaroxaban alone was noninferior to standard therapy for the initial and long-term treatment of PE and had a potentially improved benefit-risk profile.

#### **Atrial Fibrillation**

In the Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct FXa Inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET-AF) trial, <sup>228</sup> patients with nonvalvular AF were randomly assigned to either fixed-dose rivaroxaban (20 mg daily or 15 mg daily in patients with a CrCl of mL/min) or dose-adjusted warfarin. In the perprotocol analysis, the primary endpoint of stroke or systemic embolism occurred in 188 patients on rivaroxaban (1.7% per year) and 241 patients on warfarin (2.2% per year, HR for the rivaroxaban group = 0.79, 95% CI 0.66-0.96, P < 0.001 for noninferiority). Major and nonmajor clinical bleeding occurred in 1475 patients receiving rivaroxaban (14.5% per year, HR 1.03; 95% CI 0.96-1.11; P = 0.44). There was a significant reduction in intracranial hemorrhage (0.5% versus 0.7%, P = 0.02) and fatal bleeding (0.2% versus 0.5%, P =0.003) in the rivaroxaban group. In contrast, major GI bleeding was more common in the rivaroxaban group (224 events, 3.2%) when compared with warfarin (154 events, 2.2%, P < 0.001). On the basis of these data, the FDA approved rivaroxaban for stroke and thromboembolic prophylaxis in nonvalvular AF.

#### **Atrial Fibrillation and PCI**

In the PIONEER-AF-PCI trial,  $^{229}$  2124 participants with NVAF who had undergone PCI with stenting were randomized to receive, in a 1:1:1 ratio, low-dose rivaroxaban (15 mg once daily) plus a P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitor for 12 months (group 1), very-low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) plus DAPT for, or 12 months (group 2), or standard therapy with a dose-adjusted vitamin K antagonist (once

daily) plus DAPT for, or 12 months (group 3). The primary safety outcome was clinically significant bleeding (a composite of major bleeding or minor bleeding according to TIMI criteria or bleeding requiring medical attention). The rates of clinically significant bleeding were lower in the two groups receiving rivaroxaban than in the group receiving standard therapy (16.8% in group.0% in group 2, and 26.7% in group 3; HR for group 1 versus group.59; 95% CI 0.47–0.76; P < 0.001; HR for group 2 versus group.63; 95% CI 0.50-0.80; P < 0.001). The rates of death from cardiovascular causes, MI, or stroke were similar in the three groups (Kaplan-Meier estimates, 6.5% in group.6% in group 2, and 6.0% in group 3; P values for all comparisons were nonsignificant). In participants with atrial fibrillation undergoing PCI, the administration of either low-dose rivaroxaban plus a P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitor for 12 months or very-low-dose rivaroxaban plus DAPT for, or 12 months was associated with a lower rate of clinically significant bleeding than was standard therapy with a vitamin K antagonist plus DAPT for, or 12 months.

#### **Heart Failure**

The COMMANDER HF randomized clinical trial<sup>230</sup> evaluated the effects of adding low-dose rivaroxaban to antiplatelet therapy in patients with recent worsening of chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction, CAD, and sinus rhythm. The trial randomized 5022 patients postdischarge from a hospital or outpatient clinic after treatment for worsening HF. Patients were required to be receiving standard care for HF and CAD and were excluded for a medical condition requiring anticoagulation or a bleeding history. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio. Although the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality, MI, or stroke did not differ between rivaroxaban and placebo, there were numerical advantages favoring rivaroxaban for MI and stroke. Accordingly, a post hoc analysis of the COMMANDER HF placebo-controlled trial in patients with CAD and worsening HF was undertaken. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 2.5 mg of rivaroxaban given orally twice daily or placebo in addition to their standard therapy. For this post hoc analysis, a thromboembolic composite was defined as either MI, ischemic stroke, sudden/unwitnessed death, symptomatic PE, or symptomatic DVT or all of the previous components except sudden/unwitnessed deaths because not all of these are caused by thromboembolic events. Of 5022 patients, 3872 (77.1%) were men, and the overall mean (SD) age was 66.4 (10.2) years. Over a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 19.6 (11.7–30.8) months, fewer patients assigned to rivaroxaban compared with placebo had a thromboembolic event including sudden/unwitnessed deaths: 328 (13.1%)

versus 390 (15.5%) (HR 0.83; 95% CI 0.72–0.96; <sup>P</sup>¼0.01). When sudden/unwitnessed deaths were excluded, the results analyzing thromboembolic events were similar: 153 (6.1%) versus 190 patients (7.6%) with an event (HR 0.80; 95% CI 0.64–0.98; <sup>P</sup>¼0.04).<sup>231</sup>

#### Stable Cardiovascular Disease

In the COMPASS study, participants with stable atherosclerotic vascular disease (coronary artery or peripheral artery) were randomly assigned to receive rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus aspirin 100 mg once daily, and 5 mg twice daily or aspirin 100 mg once daily. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, or MI. The study was stopped for superiority of the rivaroxaban plus aspirin group after a mean follow-up of 23 months. The primary outcome occurred in fewer patients in the rivaroxaban plus aspirin group than in the aspirin alone group (4.1% versus 5.4%; HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.66–0.86; P < 0.001),<sup>38</sup> but, there was a higher rate of major bleeding (3.1% versus 1.9%; HR 1.70; 95% CI 1.40–2.05; P < 0.001). There was no difference in either intracranial or fatal bleeding between groups. All-cause death was lower in the rivaroxaban plus aspirin group when compared with aspirin alone. Participants receiving rivaroxaban alone did not experience fewer events than aspirin alone, but major bleeding rates were higher.

Additional analysis of the COMPASS study revealed a particularly marked effect of combined rivaroxaban and aspirin for the prevention of primary and secondary stroke.<sup>39</sup> Ischemic/uncertain strokes were reduced by nearly half, as were the occurrence of fatal and disabling stroke. Independent predictors of stroke were prior stroke, hypertension, elevated systolic blood pressure at baseline, age, diabetes mellitus, and Asian ethnicity. Prior stroke was the strongest predictor of incident stroke with a HR of 3.63.

#### Ablation

VENTURE-AF was a prospective randomized trial of uninterrupted rivaroxaban and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in patients with NVAF undergoing CA. Patients (n ¼ 248) were assigned to uninterrupted rivaroxaban (20 mg once daily) or to an uninterrupted VKA prior to CA and for 4 weeks afterwards. The primary endpoint was major bleeding events after CA. Secondary endpoints included thromboembolic events (composite of stroke, systemic embolism, MI, and vascular death) and other bleeding or procedureattributable events. Patients were 59.5 10 years of age, 71% male, 74% paroxysmal AF, and had a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1.6. The average total heparin dose used to manage ACT during the procedure was slightly higher (13,871 versus units; P < 0.001) and the mean ACT level attained slightly lower (302 versus 332 units; P < 0.001) in rivaroxaban and VKA arms, respectively. The incidence of major bleeding was low (0.4%; one major bleeding event). Similarly, thromboembolic events were low (0.8%; one ischemic stroke and one vascular death). All events occurred in the VKA arm and all after CA. The number of any adjudicated events (26 versus 25), any bleeding events (21 versus 18), and any other procedure-attributable events (5 versus 5) were similar.  $^{232}$ 

#### Rivaroxaban-Associated Bleeding

The management of bleeding complications among patients receiving rivaroxaban has been investigated. In a rabbit bleeding model, recombinant activated factor VII and PCC partially improved coagulation laboratory parameters but did not reduce rivaroxaban associated bleeding. <sup>233</sup> Unlike dabigatran, rivaroxaban is 95% plasma protein bound, so hemodialysis is not expected to be useful. Activated charcoal may be useful if given within 8 hours of oral ingestion. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of PCC in 12 healthy male volunteers on rivaroxaban, PCC immediately and completely reversed the prothrombin time and endogenous thrombin potential; however, no clinically relevant bleeding complications occurred during treatment. <sup>234</sup> See reversal and replacement section below.

#### **Apixaban**

Apixaban is a direct oral anticoagulant that binds the active site of FXa.

#### **Pharmacodynamics**

Apixaban is a potent, direct, oral, reversible, and highly selective inhibitor of FXa (inhibitory constant=0.08 nM) that does not require AT for antithrombotic activity. Apixaban inhibits free and clot-bound FXa, as well as prothrombinase activity, which inhibits clot growth. By inhibiting FXa, apixaban decreases thrombin generation and thrombus development. It has no direct effect on platelet aggregation, but indirectly inhibits platelet aggregation induced by thrombin.

#### **Pharmacokinetics**

Apixaban has an oral bioavailability of 50%. Peak plasma drug concentrations are achieved at  $\sim$ 3 hours after administration and the half-life is 9–14 hours. Like rivaroxaban, metabolism is dependent on CYP450 activity. Apixaban exposure increases dose

proportionally for oral doses up to 10 mg. Elimination occurs via multiple pathways including metabolism, biliary excretion, and direct intestinal excretion, with approximately 27% of total apixaban clearance occurring via renal excretion. The pharmacokinetics of apixaban are consistent across a broad range of patients, and apixaban has limited clinically relevant interactions with most commonly prescribed medications, allowing for fixed dosages without the need for therapeutic drug monitoring.<sup>236</sup>

#### Clinical Experience

Venous thromboembolism. In the AMPLIFY study,<sup>237</sup> 5395 patients with acute venous thromboembolism were randomized to apixaban (at a dose of 10 mg twice daily for 7 days, followed by 5 mg twice daily for 6 months) or conventional therapy (SQ enoxaparin, followed by warfarin). The primary efficacy outcome was recurrent symptomatic venous thromboembolism or death related to venous thromboembolism. The principal safety outcomes were major bleeding alone and major bleeding plus clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 59 of 2609 patients (2.3%) in the apixaban group, as compared with 71 of 2635 (2.7%) in the conventional therapy group (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.60–1.18; difference in risk [apixaban minus conventional therapy], -0.4 percentage points; 95% CI -1.3–0.4). Apixaban was noninferior to conventional therapy (P < 0.001) for predefined upper limits of the 95% CIs for both RR (<1.80) and difference in risk (<3.5 percentage points). Major bleeding occurred in 0.6% of patients who received apixaban and in 1.8% of those who received conventional therapy (RR 0.31; 95% CI 0.17–0.55; P < 0.001 for superiority).

#### Atrial Fibrillation

In a double-blind study,<sup>238</sup> 5599 patients with atrial fibrillation who were at increased risk for stroke, but in whom vitamin K antagonist therapy was considered unsuitable by their primary provider, were randomly assigned to receive apixaban (at a dose of 5 mg twice daily) or aspirin (81–324 mg per day). The primary outcome was the occurrence of stroke or systemic embolism. The data and safety monitoring board recommended early termination of the study because of a clear benefit in favor of apixaban. There were 51 primary outcome events (1.6% per year) among patients assigned to apixaban and 113 (3.7% per year) among those assigned to aspirin (HR with apixaban 0.45; 95% CI 0.32–0.62; P < 0.001). The rates of death were 3.5% per year in the apixaban group and 4.4% per year in the aspirin group (HR 0.79;95% CI 0.62–1.02; <sup>P</sup> <sup>¼</sup> 0.07).

The ARISTOTLE trial<sup>239</sup> randomized patients with AF and at least one other risk factor for stroke to either warfarin or apixaban 5 mg twice daily. The rate of the primary outcome, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or systemic embolism, was 1.27% per year in the apixaban group and 1.60% per year in the warfarin group (HR with apixaban 0.79, 95% CI 0.66–0.95, P < 0.001 for noninferiority; P = 0.01 for superiority).

#### Atrial Fibrillation and PCI

The AUGUSTUS trial<sup>240</sup> was a two-by-two factorial, randomized, controlled trial that compared a vitamin K antagonist to apixaban, and aspirin to placebo, on a background of a P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitor in a population of patients with atrial fibrillation and either ACS or PCI (or both). Inclusion criteria were: 1) age  $\geq$  18 years; 2) previous atrial fibrillation with planned use of an oral anticoagulant; and 3) planned use of a  $P2Y_{12}$  inhibitor for >6 months. Exclusion criteria were: 1) severe renal insufficiency; 2) history of intracranial hemorrhage; 3) other indications for anticoagulation; 4) coagulopathies; and 5) recent or planned coronary artery bypass surgery. Randomization of 4614 patients was performed within 14 days of ACS or PCI, with the median time at 6 days. In 92.6%, clopidogrel was the P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitor used. Median percentage of time in therapeutic range for those assigned to a vitamin K antagonist was 59%. No significant interaction was found between the two randomization factors for death or ischemic events (P = 0.28 for interaction). At 6 months, 154 patients (6.7%) who had been assigned to receive apixaban had died or had experienced an ischemic event, including MI, definite or probable stent thrombosis, stroke, or urgent revascularization as compared with 163 (7.1%) who had been assigned to receive a VKA. In the antiplatelet-regimen comparison, 149 patients (6.5%) who had been assigned to receive aspirin died or had an ischemic event, as compared with 168 (7.3%) who had been assigned to receive placebo. This difference was not significant, but more ischemic events occurred in the placebo group.

#### **Ablation**

In AXAFA-AFNET continuous apixaban (5 mg BID) was prospectively compared to VKA (INR 2–3) in atrial fibrillation patients at risk of stroke. <sup>241</sup> Primary outcome was a composite of death, stroke, or bleeding (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium 2–5). Overall, 674 patients (median age 64 years, 33% female, 42% nonparoxysmal atrial fibrillation) were randomized and 633 received study drug. The primary outcome was observed in 22/318 patients randomized to apixaban, and in 23/315 randomized to VKA (difference -0.38% [90% CI -4.0%, 3.3%], noninferiority P=0.0002 at the prespecified absolute margin of 0.075), including two (0.3%)

deaths, two (0.3%) strokes, and 24 (3.8%) ISTH major bleeds. Acute small brain lesions were detected by MRI in a similar number of patients in each arm (apixaban 44/162 [27.2%]; VKA 40/161 [24.8%]; P=0.64). Cognitive function increased at the end of follow-up (P=0.005) without differences between study groups.

#### **Apixaban-Associated Bleeding**

In the AMPLIFY trial, <sup>237</sup> the composite outcome of major bleeding and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding occurred in 4.3% of the patients in the apixaban group, as compared with 9.7% of those in the conventional-therapy group (RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.36–0.55; P < 0.001). In AVEROUS, <sup>238</sup> there were 44 cases of major bleeding (1.4% per year) in the apixaban group and 39 (1.2% per year) in the aspirin group (HR with apixaban 1.13; 95% CI 0.74–1.75; P =0.57); there were 11 cases of intracranial bleeding with apixaban and 13 with aspirin. The rate of major bleeding was 2.13% per year for apixaban and 3.09% per year for warfarin (HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.60– 0.80; P < 0.001) in the ARISTOTLE. <sup>240,242</sup> Major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was noted in 10.5% of the patients receiving apixaban, as compared with 14.7% of those receiving a vitamin K antagonist (HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.58–0.81; P < 0.001 for both noninferiority and superiority) in the AUGUSTUS trial, and in 16.1% of the patients receiving aspirin, as compared with 9.0% of those receiving placebo (HR 1.89; 95% CI 1.59–2.24; P < 0.001). The percentage of patients with a primary bleeding outcome event was highest among those receiving a vitamin K antagonist and aspirin (18.7%) and lowest among those receiving apixaban and placebo (7.3%).

#### Edoxaban

Edoxaban, a once-daily nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant, is a direct, selective, reversible inhibitor of FXa. In healthy subjects, single oral doses of edoxaban result in peak plasma concentrations within 1–2 hours of administration, followed by a biphasic decline. Exposure is approximately dose proportional for once daily doses of 15–150 mg. Edoxaban is predominantly absorbed from the upper GI tract, and oral bioavailability is approximately 62%. Food does not affect total exposure to edoxaban. The terminal elimination half-life in healthy subjects ranges from 10 to 14 hours, with minimal accumulation upon repeat once daily dosing up to doses of 120 mg. <sup>243</sup> The steady state Vd is approximately 107 L, and total clearance is approximately 22 L/h; renal clearance accounts for approximately 50% of total clearance, while metabolism and biliary secretion account for the remaining 50%. Intrinsic factors, such as age, sex, and race, do not affect edoxaban pharmacokinetics after renal function is taken into account. Oral

administration of edoxaban results in rapid changes in anticoagulatory biomarkers, with peak effects on anticoagulation markers (such as anti-FXa), the prothrombin time, and the aPTT occurring within  $1{\text -}2$  hours of dosing.  $^{244}$ 

Drug interaction studies were nonetheless performed to investigate the effects of CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of edoxaban. Additionally, the effects of other drugs that could be dosed concomitantly with edoxaban were evaluated. Since edoxaban is a substrate of the efflux transporter P-gp, several drug interaction studies were conducted with P-gp inhibitors, substrates, and inducers

Venous thromboembolism. In Hokusai-VTE the patients with acute venous thromboembolism, who had initially received heparin, were randomly assigned to receive edoxaban at a dose of 60 mg once daily, or 30 mg once daily (in patients with CrCl of 30–50 mL/min or a body weight below 60 kg), or to receive warfarin. Patients received the study drug for 3 to 12 months. The primary efficacy outcome was recurrent symptomatic venous thromboembolism. The principal safety outcome was major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. A total of 4921 patients presented with DVT and 3319 with a PE. Among patients receiving warfarin, the time in the therapeutic range was 63.5%. Edoxaban was noninferior to warfarin for the primary efficacy outcome, which occurred in 130 patients in the edoxaban group (3.2%) and 146 patients in the warfarin group (3.5%) (HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.70–1.13; P < 0.001 for noninferiority).

#### **Atrial Fibrillation**

The ENGAGE study<sup>246</sup> compared two once-daily regimens of edoxaban with warfarin in patients with moderate-to-high-risk atrial fibrillation (median follow-up, 2.8 years). The primary efficacy endpoint was stroke or systemic embolism. The principal safety endpoint was major bleeding. The annualized rate of the primary endpoint during treatment was 1.5% with warfarin (median time in the therapeutic range, 68.4%) and 1.18% with high-dose edoxaban (HR 0.79; 97.5% CI 0.63-0.99; P < 0.001 for noninferiority) and 1.61% with lowdose edoxaban (HR 1.07; 97.5% CI 0.87-1.31; P = 0.005 for noninferiority). In the intention-to-treat analysis, there was a trend favoring high-dose edoxaban versus warfarin (HR 0.87; 97.5% CI 0.73-1.04; P = 0.08) and an unfavorable trend with low-dose edoxaban versus warfarin (HR 1.13; 97.5% CI 0.96–1.34; P = 0.10). The annualized rates of death from cardiovascular causes were 3.17% versus 2.74% (HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.77–0.97; P = 0.01), and 2.71% (HR 0.85; 95% CI 0.76-0.96; P=0.008), and the corresponding rates of the key secondary endpoint (a composite of stroke, systemic embolism, or death

from cardiovascular causes) were 4.43% versus 3.85% (HR 0.87; 95% CI 0.78–0.96; P=0.005), and 4.23% (HR 0.95; 95% CI 0.86–1.05; P=0.32).

#### **Edoxaban-Associated Bleeding**

In the Hokusai-VTE study, <sup>245</sup> the safety outcome occurred in 349 patients (8.5%) in the edoxaban group and 423 patients (10.3%) in the warfarin group (HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.71–0.94; P=0.004 for superiority). In the ENGAGE study, <sup>246</sup> rates of adverse events were similar in the two groups. The annualized rate of major bleeding was 3.43% with warfarin versus 2.75% with high-dose edoxaban (HR 0.80; 95% CI 0.71–0.91; P<0.001) and 1.61% with low-dose edoxaban (HR 0.47; 95% CI 0.41–0.55; P<0.001).

#### Betrixaban

Betrixaban is an oral anticoagulant that exerts its action by preventing thrombin generation without having a direct effect on platelet aggregation. Betrixaban presents a rapid absorption at a dose of 80 mg. Its peak plasma concentration is registered within 3–4 hours after oral administration in healthy humans.

#### **Pharmacodynamics**

Betrixaban is an oral, selective FXa inhibitor that binds the active site of FXa and inhibits free FXa. Direct FXa inhibition decreases prothrombinase activity and, therefore, thrombin generation. Betrixaban dosed at 40–80 mg daily has no clinically relevant effect on activated partial thrombin time, prothrombin time, or INR. <sup>247</sup>

#### **Pharmacokinetics**

Betrixaban has a half-life of hours, 248 which is longer than values for the rest of the agents in its class. Betrixaban has a quick onset of action, and the time it takes for the drug to reach maximum plasma concentration is hours; thus, a patient is fully anticoagulated relatively quickly after therapy initiation. Betrixaban is about 35% bioavailable. There is no published information on how crushing or chewing can affect bioavailability, and the package insert suggests that betrixaban should be administered with food. Furthermore, betrixaban is about 60% protein bound. Unlike other FXa inhibitors, betrixaban does not undergo extensive hepatic metabolism. Because the CYP450 isozyme system does not play a major role in the metabolism of betrixaban, drug interactions through this pathway are not a major concern. On the other hand, betrixaban is a substrate of P-gp; therefore, decreased or increased levels should be expected when betrixaban is administered with strong P-gp inducers or inhibitors, respectively.

#### Clinical Experience

Betrixaban is indicated for prophylaxis of VTE in adults hospitalized for acute medical illness who are at risk for thromboembolic complications owing to moderate or severe restricted mobility and other risk factors for VTE. Dose modifications are recommended for patients with severe renal disease (CrCl  $\geq\!15$  to  $<\!30$  mL/min).

APEX was a randomized, double-blind, multinational clinical trial comparing extended duration betrixaban (35-42 days) to short duration of enoxaparin (6–14 days) in the prevention of VTE in an acutely medically ill hospitalized population with risk factors for VTE. 249 The trial randomized 7513 patients to either betrixaban or enoxaparin treatment. Patients receiving betrixaban took an initial dose of 160 mg orally on day 1, then 80 mg once daily for 35 to 42 days, and received a placebo injection once daily for 6 to 14 days. Patients in the enoxaparin arm received 40 mg subcutaneously once daily for 6 to 14 days and took a placebo pill orally once daily for 35 to 42 days. A total of 7441 patients participated with a composite outcome comprised of either the occurrence of asymptomatic or symptomatic proximal DVT, nonfatal PE, or VTE-related death. Fewer events were observed in patients receiving betrixaban (4.4%) compared with those taking enoxaparin (6%) (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.61, 0.91). At 35–42 days, extended betrixaban reduced the risk of VTE (4.27% versus 7.95%, P=0.042)without causing excess major bleeding (1.14% versus 3.13%, P=0.07). Both VTE (3.32% versus 8.33%, P=0.013) and major bleeding (0.00% versus 3.26%, P=0.003) were decreased in the full-dose stratum. Patients who received betrixaban had more nonmajor bleeding than enoxaparin (overall population: 2.56% versus 0.28%, P=0.011; full-dose stratum: 3.32% versus 0.36%, P=0.010). Mortality was similar at the end of study (overall population: 13.39% versus 16.19%, P = 0.30; full-dose stratum: 13.65% versus 16.30%, P=0.39). 250

#### **Betrixaban-Associated Bleeding**

The most common adverse reactions ( $\geq$ 5%) with betrixaban in the Apex Trial were related to bleeding. Overall, 54% of patients receiving betrixaban experienced at least one adverse reaction compared with 52% taking enoxaparin. The frequency of patients reporting serious adverse reactions was similar between betrixaban (18%) and enoxaparin (17%). The most frequent reason for treatment discontinuation was bleeding, with an incidence rate for all bleeding episodes of 2.4% and 1.2% for betrixaban and enoxaparin, respectively. The incidence rate for major bleeding episodes was 0.67% and 0.57% for betrixaban and enoxaparin, respectively.

#### **Drug Interactions**

The dose of betrixaban should be reduced if it is coadministered with P-gp inhibitors, owing to increased bleeding risk. Betrixaban should be avoided in patients with severe renal impairment receiving concomitant P-gp inhibitors.

## **Vitamin K Antagonists**

#### Warfarin

Warfarin, while available in an IV form, is predominantly administered orally.

#### **Pharmacodynamics**

Warfarin exerts its anticoagulant activity through inhibition of the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X-specifically, their carboxylation. Carboxylation of the N-terminal region of coagulation proteins II, VII, IX, and X is required for their biological activity and reduced vitamin K is required as a cofactor for the carboxylation step.

#### **Pharmacokinetics**

Warfarin interferes with clotting factor synthesis by inhibition of the C1 subunit of vitamin K epoxide reductase enzyme complex, reducing the regeneration of vitamin  $K_1$  epoxide. Warfarin (and other coumarin derivatives) inhibit the reductase enzymes responsible for vitamin K recycling, indirectly slowing the rate of synthesis of clotting functionally active factors. <sup>251</sup> Therapeutic doses of warfarin reduce the total amount of active vitamin K–dependent clotting factors produced by the liver by 30% to 50%.

#### **Clinical Experience**

**Dosing.** A standard approach to initiating warfarin is to begin with 5 mg/day for 3 days, checking the INR daily and titrating the dose accordingly until it is in the lower threshold of anticoagulation (INR 2.0) is surpassed. Lower starting doses are preferred in older adults, those with increased risk of bleeding, concomitant liver disease, and in the presence of concomitant medications known to increase warfarin response. Genetic variations in hepatic enzymes explain lower dose requirements for persons of Asian descent and higher doses for black and some Jewish populations. In patients transitioning from parenteral anticoagulation, warfarin should be initiated 4–5 days before heparin (UFH, LMWH) is discontinued to

allow for the inactivation of all circulating vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors; the heparin can be discontinued once the INR has been in the therapeutic range for 2 days.

#### Therapeutic INR Range

The INR, representing a prothrombin time according to an international reference thromboplastin, is recommended for warfarin management. In fact, the INR was developed solely for this purpose-acknowledging the complexity of warfarin and a need to obtain consistency across laboratories and for clinicians worldwide. An INR range of 2.0 to 3.0 is recommended for patients who have DVT, PE, those at risk of thromboembolism, including AF. Patients with *prosthetic heart valves* require a greater intensity of anticoagulation, and the recommended INR range is 2.0 to 3.5, with lower values for those with bioprosthetic valves and mechanical valves in the aortic position. <sup>254</sup> Once the steady-state warfarin requirement is known, the INR can be checked once every weeks. Importantly, variation in INR control and variation in warfarin requirements may be influenced in individual patients by dietary changes, comorbid illness, changes in medication or doses, activity, and alcohol intake.

#### **Self-Monitoring and Self-Guided Warfarin Therapy**

Selected patients who can both self-monitor, using a home point-of-care coagulation device and self-guide according to a clinician-developed dosing algorithm have less thromboembolic events and lower mortality than those who only self-monitor. Patient selection, education, communication, and a follow-up strategy are keys to safety and efficacy.

#### **Pharmocogenetic-Guided Dosing**

Bleeding risks are highest within the first 3 months of initiating warfarin therapy. In the CoumaGen-II study of VKORC genotype-guided warfarin dosing, the prior analysis of VKORC gave the genetically appropriate first dose. The result was 10% absolute reduction in the out-of-range INRs, 66% lower rate of DVT, and a reduction in serious adverse events at 90 days from 9.4% in controls to 4.5%. These data support a pharmacogenetic-based approach, if available and if rapid and affordable, prior to the initiation of warfarin. 256

#### **Dose Modifications**

The dose of warfarin should be reduced in the presence of congestive heart failure; liver damage from any source, including alcohol;

renal impairment (which increases the fraction of free drug in the plasma); and malnutrition (which leads to vitamin K deficiency). Thyrotoxicosis enhances the catabolism of vitamin K, reducing the dose of warfarin needed, whereas myxedema has the opposite effect. In older adults, the dose should be reduced because the response to warfarin increases with age. A variable intake of dietary vitamin K (e.g., green vegetables such as broccoli) increases INR variability. Patients should receive education and suggestions for maintaining a consistent amount of vitamin K in their food

#### **Drug Interactions With Warfarin**

Warfarin interacts with many drugs through varying mechanisms. It is inhibited by drugs such as barbiturates or phenytoin that accelerate warfarin degradation in the liver. Potentiating drugs include allopurinol and amiodarone, and cephalosporin antibiotics that inhibit the generation of vitamin K. Drugs that decrease warfarin degradation and increase the anticoagulant effect include a variety of antibiotics such as metronidazole (*Flagyl*) and cotrimoxazole (*Bactrim*). Antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin, clopidogrel, and NSAIDs may potentiate the risk of bleeding. Clinicians should avoid combination therapy unless there is a strong indication.

#### **Contraindications**

Contraindications include a recent ischemic stroke with a high-risk for hemorrhagic conversion, hemorrhagic stroke, uncontrolled systemic hypertension, and hepatic cirrhosis with impaired synthetic capacity. If anticoagulation is essential, the risk-benefit ratio must be evaluated carefully. Older age is not in itself a contraindication to anticoagulation.

#### **Pregnancy and Warfarin**

Warfarin is contraindicated in the first trimester because of its teratogenicity, and 2 weeks before birth because of the risk of fetal bleeding.

### Warfarin-Associated Bleeding Risk

The most common complication is bleeding with increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage, especially in older adults. <sup>257</sup> A serious complication is *warfarin-associated skin necrosis*. The cause likely involves depletion in protein C, a natural anticoagulant. The best approach to prevention is to start with lower doses of warfarin while the patient is concomitantly on heparin; this is particularly important in patients with known protein C deficiency.

#### Mitral Stenosis or Regurgitation

In patients with mitral valve disease, the risk of thromboembolism is greatest in those with AF, marked left atrial (LA) enlargement, or previous embolic episodes; anticoagulation should be considered. By contrast, anticoagulation is not indicated in patients with mitral stenosis in sinus rhythm. *Percutaneous mechanical LA appendage closure* with the Watchman device is widely used in patients who are not good candidates for long-term anticoagulation. In a comparison with warfarin in AF patients and a CHADS<sub>2</sub> score of 1 or more, <sup>258</sup> the Watchman was noninferior to warfarin therapy for the prevention of stroke, systemic embolism, and cardiovascular death.

#### **Heart Failure and Cardiomyopathy**

Routine anticoagulation in patients with HF (whether HFpEF or HFrEF) is not recommended in the absence of AF or other specific indication. A number of trials failed to show a benefit for warfarin anticoagulation in patients with LV systolic dysfunction or HFrEF in sinus rhythm. Long-term anticoagulation with Coumadin with target INR 2–3 or a novel oral anticoagulant has a class I indication for patients with chronic HF with permanent or paroxysmal AF and one additional risk factor for cardio-embolic stroke (HTN, DM, previous stroke/TIA, age >75 years). Chronic anticoagulation is reasonable (class II indication) for patients with chronic HF and permanent or paroxysmal AF but without any additional risk factor.

Other cardiomyopathies associated with increased thromboembolic risk are amyloid and LV noncompaction (LVNC). Anticoagulation is recommended in patients with amyloid CMP and AF in the absence of any other risk factor and should be considered even in the absence of AF especially in those with AL type. <sup>262</sup> Similarly, anticoagulation should be considered in patients with LVNC with AF without additional risk factors and in those with LVEF < 40%.

#### **Ventricular Assist Devices**

All durable LVADs require long term anticoagulation with warfarin to prevent pump thrombosis. Warfarin is typically started after removal of chest tubes, but timing may vary depending on clinical setting and/or surgeon clinical judgement. A retrospective noncontrolled study of 418 HM2 patients reported similar risk for thrombotic events with reduced postoperative bleeding in patients who receive warfarin without heparin bridging and concluded that IV heparin for transition to warfarin may not be necessary in patients with low thrombotic risk. This approach needs to be investigated and is not currently recommended.

### Heart Transplant

Due to availability of donors and longer time, many currently transplanted patients have LVADs implanted. Warfarin is typically reversed with IV vitamin K (2.5–10 mg) depending on INR. Oral vitamin K is a safer option due to small risk of anaphylaxis reported with IV route and can be used when transplantation is not expected within 24–48 hours. Other options to quickly reverse anticoagulation include FFP or PCC. Kcentra contains inactive forms of factors II, VII, IX, X and is frequently used in the operating room for quick reversal of VKAs. In the absence of bleeding, aspirin 81 mg daily is started within the first few days post heart transplant to prevent coronary artery vasculopathy, although the evidence for primary prevention is limited and based on retrospective data.

#### Prosthetic Heart Valves

Warfarin is recommended in patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves, typically titrated to an INR of 2.5 to 3.5 (Table 8.19). In patients with bioprosthetic mitral valves, the risk of thromboembolism is highest in the first 6–12 weeks, when warfarin is recommended. Thereafter, aspirin may be given, or antithrombotic therapy may be discontinued if there are no other indications. There is firm evidence supporting continued warfarin administration when mitral bioprosthetic valves are combined with AF, a large left atrium, or LV failure. In patients with bioprosthetic aortic valves the risk is low, and aspirin for 6–12 weeks is appropriate.264,265

#### **Peripheral Artery Disease**

A number of trials have been conducted to determine the utility of oral anticoagulants in patients with peripheral artery disease. The Warfarin Antiplatelet Vascular Evaluation (WAVE) trial investigators conducted a meta-analysis of nine trials involving 4889 patients and found that, compared to aspirin, oral anticoagulant therapy did not change mortality (OR = 1.04; 95% CI 0.55–1.29) or graft occlusion (OR = 0.91; 95% CI 0.77–1.06), but did increase major bleeding (OR = 2.13; 95% CI 1.27–3.57).  $^{266}$  The current data do not support routine anticoagulant therapy in patients with PAD.  $^{267\ 268}$ 

## Anticoagulant Management in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation and PCI

Among the most challenging scenarios for clinicians is the management of antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation who require PCI. The emergence of data from randomized trials as summarized previously offers guidance (Figs. 8.9 and 8.10).

#### Treatment of VKA-Associated Bleeding

Management of bleeding while on VKA is dictated by both the severity of bleeding, the intensity of anticoagulation as gauged by the INR, and the risk of thromboembolism associated with either cessation of drug treatment or reversal of anticoagulation. While minor bleeding associated with an elevated INR can be managed with temporary cessation of warfarin and administration of oral vitamin K, serious bleeding usually requires administration of IV vitamin K supplemented with FFP, PCC, or recombinant factor VIIa as needed. For life-threatening bleeding, immediate normalization of the INR is required. Although FFP can be used for this purpose, the use of factor concentrates is preferred because the volume of FFP required to correct the INR may be considerable and require hours to infuse. 269 Yasaka et al. found that a dose of 500 IU of PCC was optimal for rapid reversal of an INR <5 but that higher doses may be needed for higher INRs.<sup>270</sup> Finally, although not specifically approved for INR reversal, recombinant factor VIIa has been shown effective in reversing excessively prolonged INRs and bleeding in patients on warfarin at varying doses. Unfortunately, both PCCs and recombinant factor VIIa carry a risk of thromboembolic events,<sup>271</sup> which must be considered prior to use.

Four-factor PCC is the replacement agent of choice for warfarin-associated, acute, life-threatening hemorrhage and is dosed according to the baseline INR. A dose of 25–50 units/kg and maximum doses of, and 5000 units for INR values of 2.0–3.9, 4.0–5.9, and greater than 6.0, respectively.

## Reversal and Replacement of Direct Oral Anticoagulant Drugs

## Targeted Reversal Drugs

#### Idarucizumab

Idarucizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody fragment (FAB, molecular weight is 47.8 kDa) that tightly binds and irreversibly inhibits dabigatran in a 1:1 ratio. The affinity of idarucizumab to dabigatran is 350 times the affinity of dabigatran to thrombin. In vitro and in vivo animal studies revealed an immediate and complete reversal of dabigatran's anticoagulant activity at equimolar concentrations after single bolus dose of idarucizumab. The drug did not interact with other thrombin substrates, coagulation factors or impact platelet activity.<sup>272</sup> In addition and despite its molecular

Idarucizumab is 100 times larger than dabigatran and the Vd of the former or idarucizumab-dabigatran complex is significantly lower than dabigatran alone. The half-life is 45 minutes in healthy volunteers, and elimination occurs primarily by a renal route. The efficacy and safety in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease are unknown.

No serious adverse events were reported among healthy volunteers in a double blinded placebo controlled phase II trial.<sup>273</sup> The median serum dabigatran concentrations in this study were similar to levels reported in the RE-LY trial. An infusion (over 5 minutes) of, and 4 g resulted in a reduction of dilute thrombin time by 74%, 94%, and 98%, respectively. Similar responses were observed as determined by aPTT, ecarin clotting time and thrombin time measurements. Reversal was maintained over 72 hours with 2 g or higher doses of idarucizumab. Serum dabigatran concentrations remained elevated albeit inactive and in a bound state to the FAB fragment. Minor adverse reactions included skin irritation and erythema at the site of drug administration, dizziness, asthenia and flu-like symptoms. Idarucizumab vials contain sorbitol, and there is a potential risk of adverse events, including hypoglycemia, vomiting, and metabolic acidosis, in patients with hereditary fructose intolerance.

The safety and efficacy of idarucizumab as a reversal agent specifically for dabigatran were demonstrated in the Reversal Effects of Idarucizumab on Active Dabigatran (RE-VERSE AD) trial of 503 patients, 301 of whom had serious or life-threatening hemorrhage.274,275 The median maximum percentage reversal of dabigatran, on the basis of either the diluted thrombin time or the ecarin clotting time, was 100%. Nearly half of the study patients had GI bleeding, and one-third presented with ICH. The median time to the cessation of bleeding was 2.5 hours. At 90 days in RE-VERSE AD, thromboembolic events had occurred in 6.3% of the patients reversed for hemorrhage. Over 90% of these complications occurred in patients who did not have reinitiation of anticoagulant therapy. There were no serious adverse safety signals (Tables 8.20 and 8.21).

### Andexanet Alfa

Andexanet alfa is a recombinant modified FX molecule (FX decoy) that possesses a specific binding site for FX/Xa inhibitors. It lacks the membrane binding g-carboxyglutamate domains and catalytic site, and therefore does not exert a procoagulant effect.276 The drug can reverse the anticoagulant activity of direct FXa inhibitors in a

## Recommended dosing for idarucizumab Drug Potential reversal agent/therapy

#### Dabigatran Idarucizumab 5 g IV (administered as two separate infusions of 2.5 g over 5 to 10 minutes, total administration should be completed within 15 minutes)

#### Redosing:

- a. The prescribing information for idarucizumab allows for redosing with 5 g 12–24 hours after initial dose if the patient has clinically relevant bleeding or need for second surgery/procedure with elevated coagulation parameters. There is no clinical data to support redosing at this time.
- b. Redosing at physician's discretion if the following criteria are met:
- c. 12–24 hours after first 5 g dose AND
  - ii. Clinically relevant bleeding OR require a second emergency surgery/ urgent procedure; AND
  - iii. Reelevation of coagulation parameters (aPTT and TT)

dose-dependent manner. And exanet alfa also retains its ability to bind AT and is designed to reverse antithrombin-mediated indirect FXa inhibitors, including LMWHs and fondaparinux. Additional studies will be required before the current labeling is expanded.

Several randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in healthy volunteers investigated the efficacy and safety of various andexanet alfa doses in reversal of direct and indirect FXa inhibitors. ANNEXA-A and ANNEXA-R trials included older healthy volunteers after treatment with apixaban or rivaroxaban, respectively. AntiFXa activity of apixaban and rivaroxaban was immediately reversed after a bolus injection of 400 mg and 800 mg, respectively. Thrombin generation increased to normal without a rebound effect in the andexanet alfa arm. There were no thrombotic events in these trials. Reversal was maintained for 2 hours after a bolus injection and for a longer duration with a continuous infusion of 4 mg/min for rivaroxaban and 8 mg/min for apixaban. 277

The ANNEXA-4 trial evaluated 352 patients<sup>278</sup> who had acute major bleeding within 18 hours after administration of a FXa inhibitor. The patients received a bolus of andexanet, followed by a 2hour infusion. The coprimary outcomes were the percent change in antiFXa activity after and exanet treatment and the percentage of patients with excellent or good hemostatic efficacy at 12 hours after the end of the infusion, with hemostatic efficacy adjudicated on the basis of prespecified criteria. Efficacy was assessed in the subgroup of patients with confirmed major bleeding and baseline antiFXa activity of at least 75 ng/mL (or ≥0.25 IU/mL for those receiving enoxaparin). Patients had a mean age of 77 years, and most had substantial cardiovascular disease. Bleeding was predominantly intracranial (in 227 patients [64%]) or GI (in 90 patients [26%]). In patients who had received apixaban, the median anti-FXa activity decreased from 149.7 ng/mL at baseline to 11.1 ng/mL after the and exanet bolus (92% reduction; 95% CI 91-93); in patients who had received rivaroxaban, the median value decreased from 211.8 ng/mL to 14.2 ng/mL (92% reduction, 95% CI 88-94). Excellent or good hemostasis occurred in 204 of 249 patients (82%) who could be evaluated. Within 30 days, death occurred in 49 patients (14%) and a thrombotic event in 34 (10%) (Tables 8.22 and 8.23).

## **Achieving Good Hemostasis**

An ability to achieve good hemostasis is the goal of reversal or replacement therapy (Fig. 8.11). In addition, we will emphasize that the management of patients receiving anticoagulant therapy in whom major or life-threatening bleeding occurs must be

multidimensional to achieve favorable outcomes (Fig. 8.12).<sup>279</sup> In addition, there must be a step-wise approach that includes initial stabilization and supportive care (Fig. 8.13) as well as a decision tree for resumption of anticoagulant therapy (Fig. 8.14).

## Conclusions

Antithrombotic therapy is a mainstay in the management of patients with cardiovascular disease. Intensive investigation and exceptional progress over the past several decades have provided many therapeutic options that include platelet-directed antagonists and anticoagulants. Clinicians must always follow the best available evidence when making decisions on behalf of their patients. Management guidelines and frequent updates as new data emerge will remain a key component to optimal patient care. In addition to understanding the pharmacology, clinical use and potential adverse effects, clinicians must equally understand the approach to treatment for major or life-threatening hemorrhage, the most common complication of antithrombotic therapy. The future of antithrombotic therapy will be defined by optimal use and discernment by informed clinicians and patients and, as in the past, an increasing knowledge of biology and pathophysiology will open the door to new drug development (Table 8.24).
