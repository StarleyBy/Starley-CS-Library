Figure 68 The inner aspect of the right ventricular inlet and apex.1

The heart is viewed from the antero-superior direction. The free wall of the right ventricle, the right ventricular outflow tract, and the pulmonary root are removed. The posterior attachment of the right ventricle is where the right ventricular outflow tract starts to separate from the left ventricle. Behind the posterior attachment, the major septal branch enters into the basal superior ventricular septum. The moderator band arises from the septomarginal trabeculation from the supero-septum at the mid-ventricular level. The morphology of the moderator band is variable with mean thickness and length of 4.5 mm and 16.2 mm, respectively.2 It traverses the mid-right ventricle toward the base of the anterior papillary muscle. The medial papillary muscle is located at the base of the septomarginal trabeculation, just anterior to the right coronary aortic sinus. The medial papillary muscle anchors the medial part of the antero-superior tricuspid leaflet.3 The

medial papillary muscle, septomarginal trabeculation, moderator band, and the base of the anterior papillary muscle are important as they are related to the course of the right bundle branch.4 Endocardial activation of the right ventricle starts near the insertion of the anterior papillary muscle approximately 5 to 10 ms after the onset of the left ventricular activation.5 The moderator band is connected with multiple trabeculations. The anterior papillary muscle anchors the commissure between the antero-superior and inferior tricuspid leaflets. Septal tricuspid leaflet is anchored by the chordae tendineae attaching directly to the ventricular septum. The inferior papillary muscle anchors the commissure between the septal and inferior tricuspid leaflets.

Figure 69 The right ventricular apical trabeculations.1

The heart is viewed from the anterior direction. The free wall of the right ventricle is removed. The medial papillary muscle is located at the base of the septomarginal trabeculation, at the bifurcation of the superior and inferior limbs of the septomarginal trabeculation, at its inferior limb side. The medial papillary muscle anchors the medial part of the antero-superior tricuspid leaflet. The superior limb directs toward the left adjacent pulmonary sinus, and the inferior limb directs toward the membranous septum. The supraventricular crest arises from the bifurcation of the superior and inferior limbs. It runs along the superior tricuspid annulus. Thus, the supraventricular crest is in orthogonal relationship to the septomarginal trabeculation. The supraventricular crest is also referred to as the ventriculo-infundibular fold, forming the postero-lateral

free wall of the infundibulum that lifts the pulmonary valve away from the tricuspid valve. Coarse and dense apical and basal trabeculations are noted, which actually extend over the lateral free wall. On the contrary, the subpulmonary region shows a smooth endocardial surface, except the septoparietal trabeculation, which arises from the superior limb of the septomarginal trabeculation, coursing on the medial infundibulum. The anterior papillary muscle is supported by the mid-lateral trabeculations and anchors the commissure between the antero-superior and inferior tricuspid leaflets. The inferior papillary muscle anchors the commissure between the inferior and septal tricuspid leaflets. The septal leaflet is anchored by multiple chordae tendineae attaching to the ventricular septum.

Figure 70 Open image of the right ventricle.1

The free wall of the right heart is cut and opened (left) then viewed from the left posterior oblique direction. The main specimen (right) is viewed from the right anterior oblique direction. At the right ventricular free wall, the coarse and dense trabeculations extend from apical to basal regions. Only the right atrial vestibule shows the smooth endocardial surface sandwiched between the trabeculations of the right ventricle and pectinate muscles of the right atrial appendage. The moderator band and the body of the anterior papillary muscle is left on the main specimen. The anterior papillary muscle anchors the commissure between the antero-superior and inferior tricuspid leaflets. The close proximity of the right atrial vestibule and the right coronary artery running in the right atrioventricular groove can be recognized at both superior

and inferior tricuspid annulus. The average minimum distance between the endocardium at the inferior right atrial vestibule to the distal right coronary artery is 3 mm,6 which suggests the potential risk of inadvertent injury to the right coronary artery during catheter ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus.7 The supraventricular crest extends superior to the tricuspid annulus to lift up the pulmonary valve. In other words, this structural anatomy renders the superior atrioventricular groove as deeply wedged between the right atrial appendage and supraventricular crest. This peculiar shape suggests the need for the U-turn approach if the superior tricuspid annulus is related to the accessory pathways or ventricular arrhythmias. Refer to Figure 51.

Figure 71 Rotational observation of the right ventricle.

The free wall of the right heart is removed, except for the right atrioventricular groove. The heart is viewed from the right posterior oblique 105-degree (upper image on the left page), right anterior oblique 75-degree (lower left image on the left page), 45-degree (lower right image on the left page), 15-degree (upper left image on the right page) directions, and left anterior oblique 15-degree (upper right image on the right page), 45-degree (lower image on the right page) directions. The moderator band traverses the middle part of the right ventricle. Dense and coarse apical trabeculations are left by only removing the thin right ventricular free wall. The endocardial surface of the basal-mid septum and right ventricular outflow tract is smooth, except for the septoparietal trabeculations originating from the superior limb of the septomarginal trabeculation. The septoparietal trabeculations on the medial infundibulum directs toward the anterior free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract. The septomarginal trabeculation is less prominent in this heart. *En face* and tangential views of the atrial and ventricular septum are obtained at right anterior oblique 45-degree view (lower right image on the left

page), and left anterior oblique 45-degree view (lower image on the right page), respectively.8 Therefore, in this heart, a right anterior oblique 45-degree view provides optimal separation of the structures on the atrial or ventricular septa. On the contrary, every structural relationship on the atrial and ventricular septa are foreshortened in the left anterior oblique 45-degree view. Therefore, the left anterior oblique view cannot secure the precise septal approach.9 If the right anterior oblique angulation is shallower, it is insufficient for optimal separation of the septal structures.10 Less right anterior oblique angulation, relative to the *en face* view of the ventricular septum, makes the right-hand margin of the cardiac silhouette increasingly occupied by the left ventricle (upper left image on the right page). X-shaped crisscrossing of the right and left ventricular outflow tracts between the both atrial appendages are best shown in the left anterior oblique 45-degree view (lower image on the right page), as the optimal separation of the left and right ventricles is achieved. The supraventricular crest, also referred to as the ventriculo-infundibular fold composing the postero-lateral free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract covers the aortic root at its crossing point.

Figure 72 The ablation catheter placed at each papillary muscle of the right ventricle.

The images are viewed from the left anterior oblique direction. Right ventricular trabeculations11 and papillary muscles12 can be the substrate for idiopathic ventricular arrhythmia. The catheter is placed on the medial papillary muscle (upper image on the left page), moderator band (upper image on the right page), anterior papillary muscle (lower image on the left

page), and inferior papillary muscle (lower image on the right page). Any injury to the moderator band and these papillary muscles, except the inferior papillary muscle, has a potential risk to damage the right bundle branch.

Figure 73 The ablation catheter placed at medial right ventricle viewed from the left anterior oblique direction.

The catheter is placed on the medial free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract superior to the moderator band and septomarginal trabeculation (left) using superior approach. Even though this region looks like septal direction, it is actually not the muscular ventricular septum but the medial free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract (infundibulum) superior to the anterior attachment of the right ventricle. Thus, it has a potential risk of cardiac perforation toward the anterior interventricular groove. On the contrary, the catheter is placed on the middle ventricular septum inferior to the moderator band and septomarginal trabeculation (right). This region is the true muscular ventricular septum, and it has

![](_page_12_Picture_0.jpeg)

much less risk of cardiac perforation and inadvertent injuries to the right bundle branch, septal tricuspid leaflet, and its chordae tendineae. Therefore, endomyocardial biopsy for diffuse myocardial disease13 is recommended from this region, the mid-septum of the mid-right ventricle inferior to the septomarginal trabeculation. The right anterior oblique view is useful to confirm the safe region.14 During the endomyocardial biopsy, general risk of perforation is less than 1% by the skilled hand.15

Figure 74 The ablation catheter placed at the right ventricular outflow tract viewed from the right anterior oblique direction.

The images are viewed from the right anterior oblique 30-degree direction. The membranous septum is transilluminated. The catheter is placed on the antero-medial free wall of the low right ventricular outflow tract at the anterior attachment of the right ventricle (left). The tip of the catheter is located at the base of the septoparietal trabeculation originating from the superior limb of the septomarginal trabeculation. Although the distance from the tip to the cardiac contour is secured, this region is not the ventricular septum but the medial free wall adjacent to the anterior interventricular groove. Therefore, catheter ablation or misplacement of the septal pacing lead into this region has the potential risk of cardiac perforation,16 unexpected anterior free wall pacing,9 and injury to the left anterior descending artery, including occlusion17 or extravasation.18 If the catheter tip is bent back on the septomarginal trabeculation (right), this region is the superior ventricular

septum. The septomarginal trabeculation itself is not prominent in this heart. Smooth endocardial surface is recognized, indicating the technical difficulty to keep this position. While the cardiac perforation is less likely at this region as this is the true ventricular septum, procedure on the septomarginal trabeculation has a potential risk of injury to the right bundle branch. The right bundle branch generally passes just inferior to the base of the medial papillary muscle, then runs within the septomarginal trabeculation, and travels through the moderator band to reach the base of the anterior papillary muscle.19 The depth of the right bundle branch measured from the endocardial surface is variable.19 In some cases, the right bundle branch can be observed macroscopically on the endocardial surface (arrowheads on the inset image on the left page recorded from another heart with the prominent septomarginal trabeculation).

Figure 75 The ablation catheter placed at the right ventricular apex.

The images are viewed from the right anterior oblique direction, corresponding roughly 30 degrees. Even though the apical trabeculation is dense, the myocardial wall thickness of the right ventricle is thin. This increases the risk of perforation during invasive procedures within the right ventricle, including catheter ablation and implantation of cardiac rhythm management device.20 From this view, the tip of the catheter placed at the very apical region is still distant from the right-hand margin of the apical cardiac contour. This is simply because the right ventricle does not represent the cardiac contour. The left ventricular anterior wall and apex, as well as epicardial adipose tissue, composes the right-hand apical cardiac contour in shallow right anterior oblique view. Thus, when using shallow right anterior oblique view, the finding that the tip of the catheter or lead is within the cardiac silhouette does not exclude the perforation of the right ventricular anterior wall or apex. In other words, it is not a safe approach to use the cardiac contour to estimate the right ventricular apical orientation. It is also true for frontal21 and left anterior oblique views. The tip within the cardiac silhouette does not secure the intracardiac location, even if the image indicates no extensive displacement of the catheter or lead. In this regard, deeper right
