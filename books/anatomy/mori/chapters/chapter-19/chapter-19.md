Figure 128 Sagittal section of the left ventricular outflow tract viewed from the left direction.1

In contrast to the right ventricular outflow tract that is uniformly encircled by the ventricular muscle, the component of the left ventricular outflow tract is not uniform.2 Two-fifths of the circumference of the virtual basal ring is composed of the myocardial support, whereas the rest component is composed of fibrous support.3 The muscular support involves the crest of the ventricular septum and free wall. The crest of the ventricular septum supports the right coronary aortic sinus, and the free wall supports the anterior half of the left coronary aortic sinus. The fibrous support involves the membranous septum, right fibrous trigone, aortic-to-mitral (aortomitral) continuity, and left fibrous trigone. In this section, the medial part of the left ventricular outflow tract is observed. The reversed, triangular-shaped left ventricular outflow tract is

observed. This anatomy is also referred to as the infero-septal recess, demarcated by the crest of the ventricular septum anteriorly, membranous septum and right fibrous trigone (central fibrous body) medially, and aortic-to-mitral continuity posteriorly. The infero-septal commissure of the mitral valve is located at the inferior apex of this infero-septal recess. The postero-lateral free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract, corresponding to the supraventricular crest, lies anterior to the right coronary aortic sinus. The primary septum at the floor of the fossa ovalis is transilluminated. The paired section of this image is Figure 76.

Figure 129 Sagittal sections of the left ventricular outflow tract.1

The bisected heart is viewed from the right (left) and left (right) directions. In this section, the left ventricular outflow tract is not a circular-shaped space, demarcated by the left coronary aortic leaflet superior, the left ventricular free wall supporting the left coronary aortic sinus antero-superior, ventricular septum anterior, membranous septum, right fibrous trigone (central fibrous body) medial (right), and aortic-to-mitral (aortomitral) continuity/anterior mitral leaflet posterior. Note the beakshaped, thin myocardium of the basal superior left ventricular free wall supporting the left coronary aortic sinus.3 During systole, due to the consequence of the systolic bulging of the aortic-to-mitral continuity, the shape of the left ventricular outflow tract becomes more circular than during diastole.4 In the left image, the aortic root, the membranous septum, and

the primary septum at the floor of the fossa ovalis are transilluminated. The membranous septum is the medial partition of the distal left ventricular outflow tract. The mitral annular disjunction is observed at the attachment of medial (P3) scallop.5 The posterior free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract starts to separate from the left ventricle anterior to the left coronary aortic sinus. Therefore, the fibro-adipose tissue plane on the left ventricular summit separates the left ventricular free wall from the posterior free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract. The pulmonary root, specifically the left adjacent pulmonary sinus, overrides the left coronary aortic sinus. The pulmonary trunk then lies superior to the left main trunk of the left coronary artery. Refer to Figures 87 and 100.

Figure 130 The horizontal plane at the level of the left ventricular outflow tract viewed from the superior direction.1

The posterior (lateral) and anterior (septal) wall of the left ventricular outflow tract is demarcated by the anterior mitral leaflet and crest of the ventricular septum, respectively. The left ventricular outflow tract is located posterior to the right ventricular outflow tract. No discrete structure can be defined at the bottom of the left ventricular outflow tract. It is wide open toward the basal infero-septum—in other words, the infero-septal process of the left ventricle. The interleaflet triangle between the right and non-coronary aortic sinuses is a part of the aortic root, but it is hemodynamically part of the left

ventricular outflow tract.6 The left ventricular outflow tract is angled relative to the left ventricular longitudinal axis. The difference in the distance from the left inferior pulmonary vein to the lateral mitral annulus and the distance from the right inferior pulmonary vein to the medial mitral annulus is remarkable. The flap valve of the primary septum and atrial septal pouch is observed at the atrial septum. Note the superior part of the right atrial appendage is divided into basal and apical rooms by the sagittal bundle.7 The paired section of this image is Figure 131.

The posterior (lateral) and anterior (septal) wall of the left ventricular outflow tract is demarcated by the anterior mitral leaflet and the crest of the ventricular septum, respectively. The left ventricular outflow tract is located posterior to the right ventricular outflow tract. The medial and superior roof of the left ventricular outflow tract is the crest of the ventricular

septum supporting the right coronary aortic sinus and left ventricular free wall supporting the left coronary aortic sinus, respectively. The interleaflet triangle between the left and right coronary aortic sinuses is a part of the aortic root, but it is hemodynamically part of the left ventricular outflow tract.2 The paired section of this image is Figure 130.

Figure 132 The anterior mitral leaflet and its relationship to the left ventricular outflow tract viewed from the left anterior oblique direction.1

In this section, the left ventricular outflow is the surrounded by the left ventricular free wall (supero-lateral side), aorticto-mitral (aortomitral) continuity/anterior mitral leaflet (lateral side), right fibrous trigone (basal side), atrioventricular portion of the membranous septum and infero-septal process of the basal medial left ventricle8 facing to the right atrium (medial side). The bottom of the left ventricular outflow tract is wide open to the base of the infero-septal process. The right fibrous trigone is the fibrous tissue supporting the medial part of the anterior mitral leaflet, between the nadir of the non-coronary aortic sinus and the infero-septal commissure. As seen in this image, three-dimensional shape of the left ventricular outflow tract is not a simple tube and not consistent throughout the cardiac cycle. The rest of the free wall (superior side) and crest of the ventricular septum and interventricular portion of the membranous septum (medial to supero-medial side) are necessary to close this left ventricular outflow tract.
