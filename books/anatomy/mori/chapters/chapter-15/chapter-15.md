Figure 99 The transilluminated left and right atria viewed from the antero-superior direction.1

The Bachmann's bundle, the thick subepicardial interatrial muscular connection, is facing toward the transverse sinus between the arterial trunks and anterior wall of the atria.2 The distal part of the bundle divides to surround the base of both appendages. At the right atrium, superior part of the Bachmann's bundle is confluent with the precaval bundle of the crista terminalis. At the left atrium, superior part of the Bachmann's bundle is in continuity with the fold between the left pulmonary veins and the left atrial appendage, also referred to as the left atrial ridge or warfarin (Coumadin) ridge.3

Inferior to the Bachmann's bundle, the anterior wall of the left atrium and right atrium divided by the antero-superior interatrial groove is so thin that the regions are transilluminated posterior to the aortic root. McAlpine referred to this thin region in the left atrium as the unprotected area.1 Both regions correspond to the right and left aortic mound observed in the antero-medial part of the right and left atrium, as the aortic imprint into the atrium.4 The subepicardial septopulmonary bundle and subendocardial septoatrial bundle is observed.5

Figure 100 The sagittal section of the heart viewed from the left lateral direction.1

The pulmonary bifurcation and the right pulmonary artery lie on the roof of the left atrium, after the pulmonary trunk overriding the left coronary aortic sinus and the left main trunk of the left coronary artery. This part of the left atrial roof, although variable, corresponds to the posterior hilum of the heart without pericardium between the transverse sinus and the oblique sinus.6 Refer to Figure 156. The fossa ovalis itself cannot be seen from the left side, but the flap valve can be observed at the left side atrial septum.7 The patent foramen ovale is commonly located at the antero-superior margin of the fossa ovalis,7 and the probe passing through the patent foramen ovale from the right atrium to the left atrium directs to the aortic

root via the opening of this flap valve. The orifices of the right pulmonary veins and left inferior pulmonary vein are visualized in this section. On this plane, the left inferior pulmonary vein is located most posterior. The mitral annular disjunction can be also appreciated at the attachment of the medial scallop of the posterior mitral leaflet.8 The posterior free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract is observed in this section, anterior to the left coronary aortic sinus, apart from the left ventricular free wall. Note the beak-shaped thin left ventricular free wall myocardium supporting the left coronary aortic sinus (black arrow).9 The paired section of this image is Figure 87.

Figure 101 The section corresponding to the parasternal left ventricular long-axis view.1

The heart is viewed from the left postero-superior direction, showing the section corresponding to the parasternal left ventricular long-axis image. The uneven thickness of the left atrial wall is noted. The Bachmann's bundle is observed at the thickening of the superior part of the left atrial anterior wall. The Bachmann's bundle faces to the ascending aorta. Inferior to the Bachmann's bundle, the left atrial anterior wall is thin, as is the postero-inferior wall of the left atrium. This

thin anterior wall is facing to the non-coronary and left coronary aortic sinuses, intervened by the transverse sinus. In contrast to the separated relationship of the pulmonary valve and tricuspid valve, the aortic valve and mitral valve are in fibrous continuity through the aortic-to-mitral (aortomitral) continuity. The infero-medial papillary muscle anchors the medial part of the mitral leaflets. The paired section of this image is Figure 102.

Figure 102 The paired section of the parasternal left ventricular long-axis view.1

The heart is viewed from the right antero-inferior direction. The thick muscle bundle at the superior part of the left atrial anterior wall is the Bachmann's bundle. The Bachmann's bundle traverses the both atria between the precaval bundle of the crista terminalis and the left atrial ridge. The left atrial ridge is also referred to as the warfarin (Coumadin) ridge between the left pulmonary veins and left atrial appendage.3 The right pulmonary artery lies on the left atrial roof, located

anterior to the right main bronchus. The orifice of the left atrial appendage is located between the mitral annulus and left pulmonary veins, posterior to the supero-lateral commissure. The orifice of the left atrial appendage is closer to the orifice of the left superior pulmonary vein than that of the left inferior pulmonary vein. The supero-lateral papillary muscle anchors supero-lateral commissure and the lateral part of the mitral leaflets. The paired section of this image is Figure 101.

Figure 103 The atrial septum viewed from the right anterior oblique direction.1

The right atrial components in the left image are removed in the right image. Red and blue beads mark the area where the right atrium faces the left atrium. Within this area, only the primary septum at the floor of the fossa ovalis and anteroinferior muscular buttress at the anterior limbus of the fossa ovalis is the true atrial septum. The antero-inferior muscular buttress is the muscular component of the atrial septum found between the fossa ovalis and central fibrous body. Anterior, superior, posterior, and inferior regions relative to the fossa ovalis are the interatrial grooves.4 The aortic root is transilluminated in the right image. The non-coronary aortic sinus is wedged into the antero-superior interatrial groove between

the right and left atria. As the aortic root is deeply wedged into the ventricular base, the left atrial roof is located way superior than the sinutubular junction.10 The floor of the left atrium is located superior to the floor of the right atrium. The right superior pulmonary vein is located posterior to the superior vena cava close to its junction to the right atrium. The right pulmonary artery lies on the left atrial roof under the aortic arch and directs posterior to the right superior pulmonary vein.

Figure 104 The transilluminated right and left atrium.

The hearts are viewed from right posterior (left) and left superior (right) directions. Compared to the extent of the pectinate muscles of the right atrial appendage surrounding the tricuspid annulus, except its medial side, the extent of the pectinate muscles of the left atrial appendage is confined at the supero-lateral region of the left atrial vestibule, left anterior to the left superior pulmonary vein (left). The epicardial interatrial muscle bundle bridges the posterior interatrial fold, between

the medial antrum of the right pulmonary veins and the sinus venarum. The subepicardial septopulmonary bundle descends the left atrial roof to the left atrial posterior wall between the pulmonary veins. In the right image, the left lateral end of the Bachmann's bundle continues to the fold between the left atrial appendage and left pulmonary veins.

Figure 105 The septopulmonary bundle.

The pulmonary venous component of the left atrium is viewed from the postero-superior direction. Transillumination (right) reveals the subepicardial septopulmonary bundle descending between the bilateral pulmonary veins. The septopulmonary bundle is confluent with the subepicardial circumferential band surrounding the inferior part of the left atrial

Figure 106 The left atrium viewed from the posterior direction.1

The heart is viewed from the posterior direction. The left atrial appendage is located left anterior to the left superior pulmonary vein, lateral to the pulmonary root. The inferior pulmonary veins are located infero-posterior to the superior pulmonary veins, reflecting the anterior tilt of the pulmonary venous component at the left atrial dome/roof. The posterior interatrial fold is not aligned in vertical fashion but tilts toward the right direction. Thus, the orifice of the superior vena cava is lateral to the orifice of the inferior vena cava. The atrial branch of the circumflex artery runs on the left atrial posterior wall located inferior to the pulmonary venous component. Whereas the pulmonary venous component surrounded by the four pulmonary veins, corresponding to the left atrial dome/roof, is nearly parallel to the frontal plane except its slight anterior tilt, the mitral orifice faces left antero-inferior direction as it is parallel to the atrioventricular plane. Thus, septal distance between the right pulmonary veins to the medial mitral orifice is longer than lateral distance between the left pulmonary veins to the lateral mitral orifice. The coronary sinus orifice is located at the inferior crux of the heart. Anterior to the coronary sinus orifice, the atrioventricular nodal artery ascends within the inferior pyramidal space toward the central fibrous body.11
