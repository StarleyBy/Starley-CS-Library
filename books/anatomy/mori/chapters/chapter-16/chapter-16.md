Figure 107 The relationship between the left atrial appendage, left coronary artery, left ventricular summit, and the pulmonary root and trunk.1

The heart is viewed from the left lateral direction. The left atrial appendage is located lateral to the pulmonary root/trunk, covering the proximal left coronary artery running on the left ventricular summit.2 The left atrial appendage guards the

left lateral entrance/exit of the transverse sinus. The proximal-mid left anterior descending artery and infero-lateral branch show myocardial bridge. Refer to Figure 88.

Figure 108 The location of the left atrial appendage.1

The hearts are viewed from the left lateral direction. The left atrial appendage is located superior to the supero-lateral region of the basal left ventricle. Posterior to the left atrial appendage, the left superior pulmonary vein, left main bronchus, and the left pulmonary artery overriding the left main bronchus are aligned in order (left). This is not the case in the right side, where the right pulmonary artery is located anterior to the right intermediate bronchus. Refer to Figure 94. The apex of the left atrial appendage is free within the pericardial space. The superior vena cava, brachiocephalic veins, distal pulmonary artery, and trachea and bronchus are removed in the right image. When the atrial appendage is lifted

up by the pin stuck on the left ventricular summit, the proximal coronary artery lying on the left ventricular summit can be observed. The left circumflex artery runs beneath the left atrial appendage. As shown in this image, the proximal left coronary artery is located in the compartment surrounded by the pulmonary root/trunk antero-superior, aortic root medially, left ventricular summit inferior, and the left atrial appendage supero-lateral. This compartment is filled with the epicardial adipose tissue that is removed in this heart. This region is also the left-side entrance/exit of the transverse sinus. Refer to Figures 88 and 107.

Figure 109 Segmentation of the atrial component as opposed to the ventricular and arterial components.1

The heart is separated into atrial components (left) and ventricular/arterial components (right). The orifice of the left atrial appendage is narrower than the orifice of the right atrial appendage. It is superior to supero-lateral part of the left atrial vestibule. The right and left atrial appendages cover the proximal aorta and pulmonary root/trunk, respectively. The medial

anterior wall of the left atrium is thin at the region adjacent to the antero-superior interatrial groove. This unprotected area1 has a paucity of muscle fibers, posterior to the aortic root and inferior to the Bachmann's bundle. Refer to Figure 99.

Figure 110 The left anterior oblique view of the left atrial appendage.

The left and right images show the sections at the tricuspid valve and mitral valve levels, respectively. When viewed from this direction, the left atrial appendage extends from the left superior to supero-lateral epicardial region at the basal left ventricle. The supero-medial part of the left atrial appendage is adjacent to the lateral pulmonary root/trunk, covering the

proximal left coronary artery. The infero-lateral part of the left atrial appendage attaches to the supero-lateral basal left ventricle. Regarding the relationship with the mitral valve leaflet, the left atrial appendage extends at the direction between the supero-lateral commissure and lateral scallop of the posterior mitral leaflet.

Figure 111 The left anterior oblique view of the catheter placed in the left atrial appendage.

The left image is the section at the left atrioventricular groove level. The catheter is placed in the left atrial appendage via transseptal puncture. The entrance of the appendage is located in front of the fold between the left atrial appendage and left pulmonary veins, referred to as the left atrial ridge or warfarin (Coumadin) ridge.3 The right image is the internal aspect of the left atrial appendage viewed from its orifice. The dense pectinate muscle jungle and complicated lobulations with narrow entrances do not always allow the catheter to reach the apical part of each lobulation. This complicated anatomy

can explain why sometimes an endocardial approach is ineffective to ablate an atrial arrhythmia originating from the left atrial appendage. In such cases, an alternative approach involves the epicardial ablation4 or surgical option to treat the atrial arrhythmia originating from the left atrial appendage.5 When ablating the left atrial appendage, care for the left phrenic nerve is necessary,6 as it generally descends alongside the pericardium close to the left atrial appendage.7

Figure 112 Morphological variation of the left atrial appendage.1

The shape, lobulation, and size of the left atrial appendage, as well as its spatial relationships with the pulmonary root/ trunk, left pulmonary veins, left coronary artery, and left ventricular base, are quite variable.8
