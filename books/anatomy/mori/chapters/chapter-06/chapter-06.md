Figure 30 The internal aspect of the fossa ovalis viewed from the anterior direction.1

The primary septum is located at the floor of the fossa ovalis. The atrial septum physiologically tilts toward the right atrium. The extent of this tilting is affected by the multiple factors, including age, body shape, size of the left atrium, tilting of the aortic root, shape of the heart, and rotation of the heart along its longitudinal axis. Generally, young and lean patients with vertical hearts show less tilting, compared to elderly and obese patients with horizontal hearts. This physiological tilt brings the fossa ovalis superior to the orifice of the inferior vena cava like a roof. However, as this roof is not horizontal but oblique, the majority of the transseptal punctures are eventually created at the site near the superior rim of the fossa ovalis.2 The pushing force applied to the system causes the needle tip to slip superiorly, when using conventional needle via transfemoral venous approach. A less-tilted primary septum increases the difficulty of the puncture. In that case, it requires additional curve to the needle to prevent superior slip of the system. The radiofrequency needle is a promising alternative to avoid the superior shift of the puncture site and facilitate safe and smooth procedure.3 The primary septum at the floor of the fossa

ovalis is surrounded by the interatrial fold, except the anterior limbus. This anterior limbus is a muscular component of the atrial septum, referred to as the antero-inferior muscular buttress derived from the vestibular spine.<sup>4</sup> The buttress connects the primary septum to the central fibrous body at the bottom of the non-coronary aortic sinus. This antero-inferior muscular buttress and the primary septum at the floor of the fossa ovalis are the only anatomical true atrial septum, defined as the non-folding single partition between both atria.<sup>5</sup> Chiari's network is observed in continuity with the Eustachian valve. It is found in approximately one-tenth of the dissected hearts.<sup>6</sup> The non-coronary aortic sinus is located left anterior to the fossa ovalis. Therefore, conventionally, the pig-tail catheter placed in the non-coronary aortic sinus<sup>7</sup> or His catheter<sup>8</sup> can be used as a good indicator to facilitate safe transseptal puncture. However, the relationship between the fossa ovalis and the aortic root varies according to the extent of wedging of the aortic root.<sup>9</sup> The paired section of this image is Figure 122.

Figure 31 The medial aspect of the right atrium viewed from the right anterior oblique direction.

The lateral wall of the right atrial appendage is removed. The right posterior edge of this sectional line corresponds to the anterior margin of the crista terminalis. Nearly *en face* views of the fossa ovalis,10 the orifice of the coronary sinus, and Thebesian valve are observed; although, the fossa ovalis tilts inferior. The fossa ovalis is built up like an oblique roof against the orifice of the inferior vena cava. In contrast, the Eustachian valve/ridge is seen tangentially guarding the anterior orifice of the inferior vena cava. The light source from the left atrium (right) transilluminates the primary septum, antero-inferior muscular buttress, coronary sinus, and floor of the triangle of Koch. The right aortic mound

shows a negative transillumination left anterior to the fossa ovalis and superior to the coronary sinus orifice. As it is the imprint of the anterior half of the non-coronary aortic sinus bulging into the right atrium, this medial free wall of the right atrial appendage should not be deemed as the high atrial septum. The proximity of the fossa ovalis and this aortic mound is important to estimate the potential risk of injuring the aortic root during the implantation of an occlusion device to the *ostium secundum* defect or patent foramen ovale.11,12 Refer to Figure 10.

Figure 32 The fossa ovalis viewed from the left anterior oblique direction.

The heart is cut at the level of the left atrioventricular junction. Transillumination (right) enhances the thin wall of the inferior sinus venarum/inferior vena cava that is adjacent to the inferior rim of the fossa ovalis. Thus, any approaches inferior to the fossa ovalis is not dealing with the left atrium; rather it is accessing into the epicardial adipose tissue within the

inferior interatrial groove. In some patients with aortic elongation, the descending aorta runs close to this region.12 The hole created by transseptal puncture is observed at the superior part of the primary septum at the floor of the fossa ovalis.

Figure 33 The ablation catheter placed on the primary septum close to the superior rim of the fossa ovalis.

The fossa ovalis is surrounded by the interatrial fold/groove antero-superior, superior, posterior, and inferior. Only the primary septum at the floor of the fossa ovalis and anterior limbus, also referred to as the antero-inferior muscular buttress, is the true atrial septum.5 Thus, the wall inferior to the fossa ovalis and posterior to the Eustachian ridge is not the true atrial septum, even if it is referred to as the lower atrial septum.13 On the contrary, it is the medial thin free wall of the sinus venarum/inferior vena cava itself facing to the inferior interatrial groove.12 The antero-inferior buttress is the muscular component of the true atrial septum. It anchors the primary septum to the central fibrous body. As the fossa ovalis tilts inferior, it is located supero-medial relative to the orifice of the inferior vena cava. When using the transfemoral venous approach, the common location of the transseptal puncture is close to the superior rim of the fossa ovalis as the pushing force makes the centrally placed tip slip superiorly within the area of the primary septum. Common location of the patent foramen ovale is the antero-superior margin of the fossa ovalis,14 found in one-sixth15 to one-fourth of the dissected hearts.16 Refer to Figure 9.

Figure 34 Transseptal approach viewed from the left anterior oblique direction.

The image is displayed from the left anterior oblique direction to obtain the short axis image of the heart cut at the level of the left atrioventricular junction. The puncture site at the fossa ovalis is located right postero-superior to the coronary sinus orifice, posterior to the antero-inferior muscular buttress, and right postero-inferior to the non-coronary aortic sinus. The tip is placed on the posterior surface of the warfarin (Coumadin) ridge.
