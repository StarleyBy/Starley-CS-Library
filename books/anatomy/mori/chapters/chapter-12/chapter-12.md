Figure 76 Sagittal section of the right ventricle viewed from the right direction.1

The septomarginal trabeculation and moderator band demarcate the boundary between the right ventricular outflow tract (infundibulum) and the rest of the right ventricle, involving the inflow and apical components. The small medial papillary muscle is located at the base of the septomarginal trabeculation, anterior to the right coronary aortic sinus, commonly anchoring the antero-superior tricuspid leaflet. The right bundle branch runs just inferior to this medial papillary muscle coursing within the septomarginal trabeculation and moderator band.2 The pulmonary valve is lifted up over the aortic valve by the right ventricular outflow tract. Thus, the postero-lateral free wall of the infundibulum covers the substantial part of the right coronary aortic sinus anteriorly. The pulmonary root directs toward the postero-superior direction. In

![](_page_2_Picture_0.jpeg)

contrast to the aortic root, the base of the pulmonary root has encircling muscular support by free-standing subpulmonary infundibulum.3 Although the coarse trabeculations are found in the right ventricular apical and lateral walls, the endocardial surface of the right ventricular outflow tract and inflow septum is relatively smooth, except for the septoparietal trabeculation located medial within the outflow tract. This medial wall of the right ventricular outflow tract facing toward the observer is not the septum but the free wall. The anterior wall of the right ventricle faces to the chest wall along the left sternal boarder. The superior part of the basal muscular ventricular septum separates the right ventricular inflow from the left ventricular outflow.4 The paired section of this image is Figure 128.

Figure 77 The inner aspect of the right ventricle viewed from the left anterior oblique direction.1

The right ventricular free wall is removed, except for the inferior wall. The membranous septum is transilluminated. The posterolateral free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract is also removed, which covers substantial part of the right coronary aortic sinus. Although the aortic root is adjacent to the right ventricular outflow tract and pulmonary root, they are separated each other by the thin fibrous tissue plane.5 Within such tissue plane, the so-called tendon of the infundibulum or conus tendon6 is generally illustrated in the figures showing fibrous skeleton of the heart7,8 as the firm, fibrous structure connecting the aortic and pulmonary roots. However, this structure is rarely found consistently.6 The base of the right coronary aortic sinus is directly supported by the crest of the ventricular septum,9 referred to as the myocardial crescent.10 The superior margin of this myocardial crescent corresponds to the ventriculo-arterial junction,11 identical to the postero-lateral attachment of the right ventricle at the inferior margin of the ventriculo-infundibular fold. Until reaching this ventriculo-arterial junction, the dissector can easily divide the right ventricular outflow tract from the right coronary aortic sinus. Due to this close anatomical relationship between the postero-lateral free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract and the right coronary aortic sinus, ventricular arrhythmias showing earliest activation at the right coronary aortic sinus12 also requires detailed mapping from the

![](_page_4_Picture_0.jpeg)

adjacent right ventricular outflow tract at its postero-lateral part, corresponding to the medial part of the supraventricular crest. The insulated preferential conductions connecting the right/left coronary aortic sinuses and right ventricular outflow tract/ para-Hisian region have been reported in the setting of the ventricular arrhythmias ablated from the aortic sinuses. Those reports reveal the remote exit at the right ventricular outflow tract,13 or connection to the His-Purkinje system14,15 that can be ablated from the right or left coronary aortic sinuses. The substrate of this insulated preferential conduction is considered to be the dead-end tract.16 The dead-end tract is the remnant of the aortic ring,17,18 which is the conducting tissues initially encircling the developing interventricular communication and eventually surrounding the aortic root.19 The superior limb of the septomarginal trabeculation directs toward the left adjacent pulmonary sinus, which is located the most postero-inferior among the three pulmonary sinuses. From the superior limb, several septoparietal trabeculations originate running toward the left anterior direction at the medial infundibulum. The proximal part of this superior limb is the superior limit of the ventricular septum in the right ventricular outflow tract. At the bifurcation of the superior and inferior limbs of the septoparietal trabeculation, medial papillary muscle is located at its inferior limb side, anchoring the medial part of the antero-superior tricuspid leaflet.

Figure 78 The crisscross relationship between the right ventricular outflow tract and the aortic root.1

The pulmonary valve is lifted up from the tricuspid valve by the right ventricular outflow tract. The right ventricular outflow tract and the aortic root show crisscross relationship each other. The postero-lateral free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract and pulmonary root override the right and left coronary aortic sinuses. The left main trunk of the left coronary artery is located distal to the sinutubular junction of the pulmonary root. Thus, it is the pulmonary trunk that overrides the left main trunk. The encircling myocardium of the free-standing subpulmonary infundibulum supports the base of the all three pulmonary sinuses. Therefore, ventriculo-arterial junction is located above the virtual basal ring in constant fashion in the pulmonary root. In contrast, the ventriculo-arterial junction is only seen at the base of the right and left coronary aortic sinuses in the aortic root,3 as the rest of the aortic root is supported by the fibrous tissue, including right and left fibrous trigones, aortic-to-mitral (aortomitral) continuity, and membranous septum. The apex of the

![](_page_6_Picture_0.jpeg)

interleaflet triangle between the right and left coronary aortic sinuses is close to the apex of the interleaflet triangle between the right and left adjacent pulmonary sinuses. The close anatomical relationship between the postero-lateral free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract and the right coronary aortic sinus suggests the necessity of thorough mapping of the right ventricular outflow tract and pulmonary root in the setting of ventricular arrhythmias seemingly originating from the right coronary aortic sinus or the interleaflet triangle between the right and left coronary aortic sinuses. The region of the interleaflet triangle between the right and left coronary aortic sinuses is also referred to as the *junction* of both sinuses.20 As both facing interleaflet triangles are located proximal to the semilunar attachment of arterial leaflets, both facing *junctions* are hemodynamically outflow tracts facing to the thin fibro-adipose tissue plane between both arterial roots. Refer to Figure 79.

Figure 79 Removal of the free wall of the right ventricle.1

The free-wall components of the right ventricle are removed, except the encircling free-standing subpulmonary infundibulum supporting the pulmonary root. The two images on the right page show a part removed from the left iamge. In contrast to the left heart, the atrioventricular and arterial valves are distant separated by the postero-lateral free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract (infundibulum). This curved part is also referred to as the ventriculo-infundibular fold. The endocardial side of this ventriculo-infundibular fold corresponds to the supraventricular crest. This postero-lateral free wall

![](_page_8_Picture_0.jpeg)

is adjacent to the right coronary aortic sinus separated by the thin fibrous tissue plane.21 In the image on the left page, the moderator band is sectioned. In the left image on the right page, the *en face* view of the postero-lateral free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract is shown. In the right image on the right page, the red, yellow, and blue beads indicate the moderator band, anterior papillary muscle, and inferior papillary muscle, respectively. Refer to Figure 78.

Figure 80 Removal of the free wall of the right ventricle viewed from the anterior direction.1

The free wall component of the right ventricle is removed, except the encircling free-standing subpulmonary infundibulum. It is the presence of this encircling free-standing subpulmonary infundibulum that permits the entirety of the pulmonary root to be removed and used as an aortic autograft in the Ross procedure.22 Only the superior attachment (white dotted lines) is left connected in this specimen to leave the pulmonary root *in situ*. The postero-lateral free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract covering the right coronary aortic sinus is removed. The posterior free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract beneath the pulmonary valve is left intact, covered by the superior limb of the septomarginal trabeculation directing toward the left adjacent pulmonary sinus. The free wall of the right ventricle has five attachments: anterior, postero-lateral, inferior, tricuspid (posterior), and pulmonary (superior). They correspond to the anterior interventricular groove, inferior border of the ventriculo-infundibular fold (ventriculo-arterial junction), inferior interventricular groove, right atrioventricular groove, and posterior border of the free-standing subpulmonary infundibulum, respectively. Within the right ventricular outflow tract, the anterior, postero-lateral, and pulmonary attachments are related to medial, postero-lateral, and posterior free wall

![](_page_10_Picture_0.jpeg)

of the infundibulum, respectively. The medial free wall of the infundibulum is close to the proximal-mid left anterior descending artery. The postero-lateral free wall of the infundibulum is adjacent to the right coronary aortic sinus. The posterior free wall of the infundibulum is related to the left coronary aortic sinus and left ventricular summit. A substantial part of the right coronary aortic sinus is covered by the postero-lateral free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract, intervened by the thin fibrous tissue plane. The cutting line at the postero-lateral attachment demarcates the ventriculo-arterial junction at the base of the aortic root. By the crest of the ventricular septum at this region, the bottom of the right coronary aortic sinus is firmly supported. The ventriculo-arterial junction of the aortic root is only found at the base of the right and left coronary aortic sinuses, whereas it is found at every sinus of the pulmonary root.3 In these regions, the ventriculo-arterial junction located superior to the virtual basal ring of the arterial roots is a normal structural anatomy. Therefore, it should not be deemed as the myocardial sleeve or extensions.23 Similarly, the postero-lateral free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract covering the right coronary aortic sinus should not be deemed as the myocardial sleeve or extensions of the aortic root.

Figure 81 Five attachments of the right ventricle viewed from the right antero-superior direction.1

The five attachments of the right ventricle are shown. At the pulmonary (superior) attachment of the right ventricle, the posterior free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract detaches from the ventricular mass to elevate the pulmonary valve. At this elevated posterior free wall, the right ventricular outflow tract starts to override the left coronary aortic sinus and left coronary artery. Refer to Figure 135. Therefore, the superior attachment demarcates the margin between the ventricular septum of the right ventricular outflow tract and the basal superior left ventricular free wall, referred to as the left ventricular summit.24 Thus, the septal region of the right ventricular outflow tract is located antero-inferior relative to the posterior free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract, and it is located medial relative to the postero-lateral free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract covering the right coronary aortic sinus. In the context of the entire right ventricular outflow tract, this septal region is located postero-inferior.4 The interleaflet triangle between the right and left coronary aortic sinuses is located close to the junction between the pulmonary and postero-lateral attachments. The postero-lateral attachment corresponds to the ventriculo-arterial junction, that is, the superior margin of the crest of the ventricular septum. Thus, the base of the right coronary aortic sinus is related to the crest of the ventricular septum, and the base of the anterior half of

![](_page_12_Picture_0.jpeg)

the left coronary aortic sinus is related to the left ventricular free wall.10 In addition, the right coronary aortic sinus and the interleaflet triangle between the right and left coronary aortic sinuses are, in part, covered by the postero-lateral free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract, separated by the thin fibro-adipose tissue plane. Considering these structural relationships, the crest of the ventricular septum supporting the right coronary aortic sinus, the basal superior left ventricular free wall at the left ventricular summit supporting the left coronary aortic sinus, and the postero-lateral free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract covering the right coronary aortic sinus can all be substrates of the ventricular arrhythmias ablated from the right or left coronary aortic sinuses or their so-called *junction*, corresponding to the interleaflet triangle.20 In this situation, these ventricular arrhythmias do not actually originate from the sinuses of Valsalva, *junction*, or something like myocardial sleeve or extensions,23 but they should be deemed as originating from ventricular myocardium of each location. Thus, detailed and thorough mapping of the adjacent ventricular myocardium based on the structural anatomy shown in Figure 81 is required when treating the ventricular arrhythmia seemingly originated from the right and left coronary aortic sinuses or their *junction*.

Figure 82 The ablation catheter placed at the right postero-lateral wall of the right ventricular outflow tract (supraventricular crest).

The images are viewed from the right anterior oblique (left) and left anterior oblique (right) directions. The catheter is placed at the right postero-lateral free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract, located anterior to the right coronary aortic sinus. This region is also referred to as the supraventricular crest or ventriculo-infundibular fold. At the medial part of the

![](_page_14_Picture_0.jpeg)

supraventricular crest, the thin fibrous tissue plane intervenes between the aortic root (right coronary aortic sinus) and right ventricular outflow tract. The endocardial surface of this region is smooth.

Figure 83 The ablation catheter placed at the medial free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract.

The images are viewed from the right anterior oblique (left) and left anterior oblique (right) directions. The catheter is placed at the medial free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract, close to the base of the septoparietal trabeculation. This region, often referred to as the anterior attachment or antero-septal attachment, is a common substrate of idiopathic ventricular tachyarrhythmia originating from the right ventricular outflow tract.25 Although the catheter appears to be directed

![](_page_16_Picture_0.jpeg)

toward the septal direction when viewed from the left anterior oblique direction (right), it is above the anterior attachment of the right ventricle to the ventricular septum. Therefore, this region is not the ventricular septum, but a thin medial free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract facing to the anterior interventricular groove. This indicates the potential risk of perforation26 and damage to the left anterior descending artery.

Figure 84 The superior approach to the right ventricular outflow tract using a large, U-turn curve catheter.

The images are viewed from the right anterior oblique direction. The superior approach using a large, U-turn curve is demonstrated.27 The light source in the aortic root transilluminates the postero-lateral free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract via the right coronary aortic sinus posterior to it. The catheters are placed below the level of the pulmonary (superior) attachment of the right ventricle. In the left image, the tip is located at the medial free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract at the base of the septoparietal trabeculation. In the right image, the tip is located at the crest of the ventricular septum supporting the right coronary aortic sinus. It is just beneath the ventriculo-arterial junction of the right coronary aortic sinus, corresponding to the postero-lateral attachment of the right ventricle, which can be determined as

![](_page_18_Picture_0.jpeg)

the inferior margin of the transillumination. The tip is also close to the base of the medial papillary muscle. Compared to the inferior approach, which generally needs to apply double directional (sigmoid) curve on the catheter, superior approach requires single directional curve. Therefore, manipulation of the catheter is straightforward. Also, the tip can be placed less perpendicular to the medial free wall to achieve *touch ablation* rather than *push ablation*. Refer to Figure 83. Changing the bend of the catheter enables to scan left anterior (left image) and right posterior (right image) directions. Counterclockwise and clockwise rotation enables mapping to the medical and lateral directions respectively.

Figure 85 Transilluminated heart viewed from the anterior direction.

The postero-lateral free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract is transilluminated through the aortic root (right coronary aortic sinus). The posterior free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract and the crest of the muscular ventricular septum are not transilluminated. The inferior margin of the transillumination corresponds to the postero-lateral attachment of the right ventricle (white dotted line). This line also corresponds to the ventriculo-arterial junction supporting the right coronary aortic sinus, and the basal limit of the crest of the ventricular septum at the right coronary aortic sinus. The incorporated myocardium supporting the arterial root is also called as the myocardial crescent.10 The membranous septum, fossa ovalis, and inferior sinus venarum are also transilluminated.
