Figure 1 Appropriate directional terminology to describe three-dimensional cardiac anatomy.1

The left and right images show the heart viewed from the anterior and superior directions, respectively. The direction indicators show the appropriate standard terminology to describe the direction related to the heart. According to the general rule to describe the human body, anterior, posterior, superior, inferior, right, and left are used to indicate the direction toward ventral, dorsal, cranial, caudal, right, and left, respectively. The cardiac axis, the line connecting the aortic root and cardiac

apex (white dotted lines), directs toward left antero-inferior direction.2 This left antero-inferior direction is also described as the apical direction, with opposite direction being described as the basal direction. The atrial and ventricular septa are aligned along this cardiac axis. Thus, the right anterior and left posterior directions are also described as lateral, relative to the septal or medial structures close to the atrial and ventricular septa.

Figure 2 En-bloc resection of the thoracic organs viewed from the anterior direction.1

The heart is located in the center of the thorax, covered bilaterally by the lung lobes except the anterior wall of the right ventricle and mid-apical anterior wall of the left ventricle. The anterior part of the pericardium and pleura are removed. The right atrioventricular groove extends between the right middle lobe and left upper lobe. Thus, the right atrioventricular groove and basal anterior wall of the right ventricle are located just posterior to the sternum. The apical anterior left ventricle is adjacent to the lingular segment of the left lung. The cardiac apex points to the left antero-inferior direction. This regional anatomy makes it feasible to observe the heart from the left parasternal and apical echocardiographic windows.3

Figure 3 Anterior view of the heart with epicardial adipose tissue.

The apex of the right atrial appendage is located adjacent to the ascending aorta. The apex of the left atrial appendage is adjacent to the pulmonary root. Rich epicardial adipose tissue is distributed along the coronary vessels, including the right atrioventricular groove, anterior interventricular groove, and acute margin. Localized regions in the right ventricular anterior free wall, left ventricular apical anterior wall, and left ventricular supero-lateral free wall at the mid-ventricular level also lack the epicardial adipose tissue.

Figure 4 The heart viewed from the anterior direction.1

The directional indicator shows the appropriate standard terminology to describe the direction related to the heart. The right ventricle is located most anterior, and the left atrium is located most posterior. Both chambers are midline structures located between the sternum and vertebral column, rather than being described as right- and left-side structures. The anterior view is the best *en face* view of the posterior wall of the left atrium. This view can separate both the left and right pulmonary veins. The bottom of the left atrium is located superior to that of the right atrium. The right border of the cardiac contour is composed of the superior vena cava and the right atrial appendage. The left border of the cardiac contour is composed of the aortic arch, left pulmonary artery overriding the left main bronchus, left atrial appendage, and left ventricle.4 The apices of the right and left atrial appendages are adjacent to the ascending aorta and pulmonary root, respectively. The aortic root is wedged centrally between the right and left atrioventricular junctions.5 The aortic root is located posterior to the right ventricular outflow tract, also referred to as the infundibulum, and right postero-inferior to the pulmonary root.6 The left pulmonary artery is located superior relative to the right pulmonary artery, as it needs to override

the left main bronchus.7 The pulmonary bifurcation and right pulmonary artery lie superior to the left atrial roof. The right pulmonary artery passes inferior to the aortic arch toward the right direction. The proximal part of the left coronary artery is located postero-inferior to the pulmonary root and trunk. The mid- to distal part of the left anterior descending artery literally descends anterior, after emerging at the left border of pulmonary root after skirting the left and non-adjacent pulmonary sinuses.8 The orifice of the right coronary artery is posterior to the right ventricular outflow tract. The proximal right coronary artery is directed toward the right anterior direction to run along the right atrioventricular groove. In case of deep aortic wedging, the proximal right coronary artery directs toward right antero-superior direction, showing the shepherd's crook appearance.5 In such case, the left atrial roof and fossa ovalis are located superior relative to the aortic root.5

Figure 5 Frontal section of the heart at the level of the aortic root viewed from the anterior direction.1

The atrioventricular portion of the membranous septum is observed inferior to the right coronary aortic sinus. It separates the right atrium from the left ventricular outflow tract.9 The crest of the ventricular septum inferior to the membranous septum is the general location of the atrioventricular conduction axis. Thus, the angle created between the membranous septum and the crest of the ventricular septum (yellow arrow) is where the His-bundle catheter is fixed.10 The noncoronary aortic sinus is located most infero-posterior compared to other two coronary aortic sinuses.11 The fossa ovalis is located to the right and posterior to the non-coronary aortic sinus. The primary septum at the floor of the fossa ovalis tilts toward the right antero-inferior direction. The left coronary aortic sinus is supported by the left ventricular free wall. This muscular support has less than half the thickness of the other part of the left ventricular free wall.12 This region, when complicated with annular calcification, is vulnerable to free wall rupture during transcatheter aortic valve implantation.13 The epicardial part of this basal superior left ventricular free wall related to the left coronary aortic sinus is

referred to as the left ventricular summit.1,14 The proximal left coronary artery and coronary venous tributaries are located superior to the left ventricular summit within the thick epicardial adipose tissue of the left atrioventricular groove. Thus, the proximal left coronary artery and coronary venous tributaries running this region are surrounded in the compartment created by the left coronary aortic sinus, left ventricular summit, pulmonary root and trunk, and left atrial appendage.15 Based on this structural anatomy, radiofrequency catheter ablation of the left ventricular summit is feasible via the coronary venous system. Also, dilatation of the pulmonary root and pulmonary trunk can compress the proximal left coronary artery.16 The anterior mitral leaflet is in continuity with the interleaflet triangle between the left and non-coronary aortic sinuses. Papillary muscles of the left ventricle are related to the left ventricular free wall, not to the ventricular septum. Tricuspid annular disjunction is also noted.17

Figure 6 Frontal section of the heart at the level of the inferior pyramidal space viewed from the anterior direction.1

The inferior pyramidal space is the epicardial adipose tissue wedging toward the central fibrous body, also referred to as the right fibrous trigone,1,18,19 from the diaphragmatic surface of the heart. The inferior pyramidal space arises from the crux created between the inferior regions of both atrioventricular grooves, inferior interatrial groove, and inferior interventricular groove. Inferior pyramidal space intervenes between the right atrium and basal left ventricle. Therefore, this region is not the atrioventricular septum, but the atrioventricular sandwich10 according to the anatomical definition of the septum, which is the partition between the cardiac chamber that can be penetrated without exiting to the extracardiac space. The middle cardiac vein and atrioventricular nodal artery are observed within this space. The primary septum at the floor of the fossa ovalis and antero-inferior muscular buttress (anterior limbus of the fossa ovalis) is the membranous and muscular

components of the true atrial septum.20 The secondary septum superior to the fossa ovalis is not the true septum, but the superior interatrial fold located right atrial side relative to the flap valve of the primary septum. The circumflex artery and coronary venous tributary are observed within the left atrioventricular groove sandwiched between the left atrial appendage and the left ventricular summit. The distal pulmonary trunk, pulmonary bifurcation, and right pulmonary artery are located at the roof of the left atrium, with the intervening transverse sinus. Superior extension of the transverse sinus between the ascending aorta and superior vena cava is the superior aortic recess, also referred to as the aorto-caval recess.21 The Eustachian and Thebesian valves guard the orifice of the inferior vena cava and coronary sinus,22 respectively.
