Figure 140 The septal branches.1

The heart is viewed from the anterior direction. The septal branches are dissected from the right ventricular septal surface. The first septal branch runs close to the medial papillary muscle, that is located close to the proximal right bundle branch. The first septal branch enters into the basal superior ventricular septum from the pulmonary (superior) attachment of the right ventricle, where the posterior free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract (infundibulum) starts to separate from the left ventricle to override the left coronary aortic sinus and proximal left coronary artery. Refer to Figure 80. After

running nearly horizontally behind the left adjacent pulmonary sinus to skirt the pulmonary root, the left anterior descending artery changes its course toward the antero-inferior direction along the anterior interventricular groove. Thus, the base of the pulmonary root is located between the aortic root and this bending point of the left anterior descending artery. Multiple septal branches are seen in the superior half of the ventricular septum that is related to the region of the superior fascicle,2 also conventionally referred to as the anterior fascicle of the left bundle branch.

Figure 141 The coronary orifices.1

The coronary orifice of the right coronary artery is located at the right side of the right coronary aortic sinus near the sinutubular junction with the separated orifice of the conus branch (left). The orifice of the left coronary artery is located at the center of the sinus near the sinutubular junction (right).3 The aortic valvular leaflets in the right case show

fenestration.4 Fenestration matters clinically only if it extends beyond the zone of coaptation, or the fibrous cords tear.5 Average height of the orifices of the right and left coronary arteries from the virtual basal ring plane are 17.7 mm and 14.8 mm, respectively.3

Figure 142 The right and left coronary arteries.1

In the left image, the heart is viewed from the posterior direction. The left and non-coronary aortic sinuses are located posterior, in contrast to the anteriorly located right coronary aortic sinus. The right coronary artery is dominant in this heart, which runs along the right atrioventricular groove, gives rise to the atrioventricular nodal artery at the inferior crux of the heart, and distributes to the inferior and infero-lateral region of the left ventricle. Refer to Figure 114. In the right image, the heart is viewed from the left anterior oblique and cranial direction, which shows the heart in the Valentine

position;2 the heart standing on its apex. This left anterior oblique and cranial view, and the left anterior oblique and caudal view are the best angulation to separate the proximal part of the left coronary artery in each dorsal/vertical and ventral/ horizontal hearts, respectively. The *en face* view of the left ventricular summit can be also obtained from this direction, with deep cranial angulation.

Figure 143 The left coronary artery and left ventricular summit.1

The proximal left coronary artery covers the basal superior free wall of the left ventricle. The epicardial side of this basal superior free wall supporting the left coronary aortic sinus is referred to as the left ventricular summit.1,6 Refer to Figure 135. McAlpine refers to the angled myocardium found at the left fibrous trigone as the left ostial process.1 It is this left ostial process, at the postero-inferior part of the left ventricular summit, that is mistakenly termed as aortic-to-mitral

(aortomitral) continuity in the field of electrophysiology.7,8 Actually, the aortic-to-mitral continuity is the region between the interleaflet triangle and anterior mitral leaflet. After running horizontally behind the pulmonary root, the left anterior descending artery turns its course toward the anterior interventricular groove. The small, high-lateral branch enters into the left ventricular summit.

Figure 144 The progressive dissection showing the course of the coronary arteries.1

The hearts are viewed from the superior direction. From the heart with intact cardiac chambers (upper image on the left page), the left atrium and the right atrium are progressively removed in the lower image on the left page and image on the right page, respectively. The left atrial appendage covers the diagonal branch, high-lateral branch, and circumflex artery.

![](_page_10_Picture_0.jpeg)

The right atrial appendage covers the right coronary artery and sinuatrial nodal artery. The right coronary artery directs toward the right anterior oblique direction. The orifices of the right and left coronary arteries are separated by 150-degree angulation on average.3

Figure 145 The variation in the course of the sinuatrial nodal artery.1

The sinuatrial nodal artery commonly originates from either right coronary artery or the left circumflex artery. The course of the artery as well as its final relationship between the superior vena cava are variable.9 Dual supply is not infrequent.10 The sinuatrial nodal artery is also common arterial supply for the Bachmann's bundle.11 The left image shows the Y-shaped terminal of the right sinuatrial nodal artery originating from the proximal right coronary artery, running medial to the right atrial appendage. The red bead indicates the location of the sinuatrial node. The upper image on the right page shows the left sinuatrial nodal artery emerging from the just proximal circumflex artery, running anterior to the orifice of the left

atrial appendage, left atrial anterior wall within the Bachmann's bundle, and anterior to the superior vena cava to reach the sinuatrial node. The lower image on the right page shows the left sinuatrial nodal artery originating from the proximal circumflex artery, running posterior to the orifice of the left atrial appendage within the fold between the left pulmonary veins, which is the location of the vein of Marshall. Then, it runs anterior to the left atrial anterior wall on the Bachmann's bundle and the superior vena cava to reach the sinuatrial node on the terminal groove. When the right or left sinuatrial nodal artery has anastomosis with the atrioventricular nodal artery,12 that anastomosis is referred to as the Kugel's artery.13

Figure 146 The conus branch.1

The heart is viewed from the anterior direction. The conus branch, also referred to as the conal artery,14 perfuses anterior right ventricular outflow tract corresponding to the area right beneath the third to fourth intercostal space along the left sternal border.15 The isolated acute occlusion of this artery induces isolated right ventricular infarction, which is known to show ST-segment elevation prominent in the V2 lead,15 similar to the characteristic coved-type ST-segment elevation in Brugada syndrome. When the right conus branch forms anastomosis with the left conus branch originating from the proximal left anterior descending artery, it is referred to as the Vieussens' ring.16 The Vieussens' ring can work as the critical collateral source in the setting of occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending artery or the left main trunk.17

Figure 147 The myocardial bridges.1

The mid-left anterior descending artery shows the myocardial bridge. The diagonal and high-lateral branches also show the intra-mural course, rendering the lateral epicardial wall to look avascular. The myocardial bridge is likely to be usually benign anatomical variation found in normal individuals and not necessarily lead to coronary artery ischemia.18 With improved imaging modalities, it is increasingly and readily recognized.19,20 The left sinuatrial nodal artery takes a posterior course relative to the left atrial appendage. Small atrial branches are found anterior to the orifice of the left atrial appendage.

Figure 148 The atrioventricular nodal artery.1

The right atrial wall at the floor of the triangle of Koch is removed to show the inferior pyramidal space involving the atrioventricular nodal arteries.21 The inferior pyramidal space is the epicardial adipose tissue wedging deeply from the inferior crux of the heart.21 The inferior pyramidal space (removed in this specimen) lies on the epicardial surface of the basal infero-medial left ventricular mass, referred to as the infero-septal process.22 The red bead at the apex of the triangle

of Koch marks the location of the atrioventricular node. The blue beads denote the septal attachment of the septal tricuspid leaflet. These atrioventricular nodal arteries as well as the atrioventricular node are thus epicardial structures, sandwiched between the right atrium and the left ventricle.23 Multiple atrioventricular nodal arteries are common.24

Figure 149 The left and right atrioventricular nodal arteries.1

The left and right images show the left and right atrioventricular nodal arteries. The atrioventricular nodal artery originates from the right coronary artery in nine-tenths of the patients.9 Regardless of its origin from the distal left circumflex artery or distal right coronary artery, the atrioventricular nodal artery is located within the inferior pyramidal space at

the epicardial side of the infero-septal process, and ascends toward the central fibrous body located at the bottom of the non-coronary aortic sinus.25

Figure 150 Anomalous origin of the left circumflex artery from the right coronary aortic sinus.1

The heart is viewed from the right posterior direction. The abnormal left circumflex artery originates from the right coronary aortic sinus with a common orifice with the right coronary artery. It runs right postero-inferior to the aortic root, crossing the bottom of the non-coronary aortic sinus and interleaflet triangle above the aortic-to-mitral (aortomitral) continuity. In this particular anomaly, the medial anterior wall of the right and left atria, corresponding to the right and left aortic mounds,26 are in close contact with this anomalous artery. The right atrioventricular nodal artery ascends toward the central fibrous body on the epicardial side of the infero-septal process.
