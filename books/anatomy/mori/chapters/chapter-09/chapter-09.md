Figure 46 The tricuspid annulus viewed from the right lateral direction.1

The right atrium, coronary sinus, and epicardial adipose tissue of the atrioventricular groove and inferior pyramidal space are removed. The red and blue beads demarcate the atrial septum, involving the area surrounded by the interatrial fold. The septal tricuspid leaflet divides the membranous septum into the atrioventricular and interventricular portions. The septal tricuspid leaflet is directly anchored to the ventricular septum by multiple chordae tendineae. The firm and thick fibrous tissue at the bottom of the non-coronary aortic sinus, referred to as the right fibrous trigone,1,2 connects the aortic root, atrial septum, ventricular septum, and infero-septal process. The membranous septum, septal tricuspid leaflet, and anterior mitral leaflet is in fibrous continuity with the right fibrous trigone.1 The right fibrous trigone itself is also referred to as the central fibrous body.1,2 Sometimes, the central fibrous body is used to indicate both the right fibrous trigone and the adjacent atrioventricular portion of the membranous septum,3,4 as it is hard to define distinct boundary between them. The central fibrous body is the central piece of the cardiac skeleton3 and the key structure to locate the atrioventricular conduction axis. The medial tricuspid annulus is located apical to the mitral annulus, allowing the triangular shaped offset

of the left ventricular base, referred to as the infero-septal process. At this region, the epicardial side of the infero-septal process faces the right atrium at the floor of the triangle of Koch. This infero-septal process is covered by the wedging epicardial adipose tissue referred to as the inferior pyramidal space, containing the atrioventricular nodal artery.4 The atrioventricular nodal artery ascends toward the central fibrous body. On the apex of the inferior pyramidal space, the atrioventricular node is located on the right side of the central fibrous body. Thus, the atrioventricular node is sandwiched between the central fibrous body and the medial right atrium at the apex of the triangle of Koch.5 Therefore, the atrioventricular node is an epicardial structure.6 To enter into the heart, the penetrating bundle corresponding to the bundle of His needs to penetrate the central fibrous body from the right posterior side at the postero-inferior part of the atrioventricular portion of the membranous septum. Then, the axis emerges at the inferior margin of the membranous septum on the crest of the ventricular septum. Refer to Figure 67.

Figure 47 The tricuspid valve viewed from the atrial and ventricular direction.1

The tricuspid valve is demonstrated from the atrial (left) and ventricular (right) side. The septal, antero-superior, and inferior tricuspid leaflets are shown with an accessory leaflet at the commissure between the septal and antero-superior tricuspid leaflets. The septal tricuspid leaflet divides the membranous septum into atrioventricular and interventricular portions. The septal tricuspid leaflet is anchored by multiple chordae tendineae on the ventricular septum. The accessory leaflet and medial part of the antero-superior tricuspid leaflet are anchored by the chordae tendineae originating from the medial papillary muscle located on the inferior limb of the septomarginal trabeculation. The commissure between the antero-superior and inferior tricuspid leaflets is anchored by the chordae tendineae originating from the anterior papillary

muscle. The commissure between the inferior and septal tricuspid leaflet is anchored by the chordae tendineae originating from the inferior papillary muscle. The relationships between these papillary muscles and leaflets are not consistent, but are rather variable.7 The superior and ventricular parts of the tricuspid annulus is the supraventricular crest corresponding to the postero-lateral free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract located anterior to the right atrioventricular groove and the right coronary aortic sinus. This structure is also referred to as the ventriculo-infundibular fold.

Figure 48 The atrioventricular valves viewed from the ventricular side.

The orifice of the tricuspid valve shows a characteristic morphology as if the medial corner of the orifice is pulled up toward the superior septal direction. This is because the medial part of the antero-superior tricuspid leaflet is anchored by the chordae tendineae originating from the medial papillary muscle. The medial papillary muscle originates from the septomarginal trabeculation that is located at the superior septum. The chordae tendineae of the anterior papillary muscle anchor the commissure between the antero-superior and inferior tricuspid leaflets. The medial part of the supraventricular crest, the postero-lateral free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract, is located in front of the right coronary aortic sinus. Compared to the endocardial surface of this supraventricular crest and the right-side ventricular septum, the lateral and inferior free wall of the basal right ventricle has rich trabeculations extending to the level of the tricuspid valve attachment.

Figure 49 The tricuspid valve viewed from the anterior direction.

The membranous septum is transilluminated. The medial part of the antero-superior tricuspid leaflet is anchored by the chordae tendineae arising from the medial papillary muscle. The chordae tendineae from the anterior papillary muscle anchors the commissure between the antero-superior and inferior tricuspid leaflets. The chordae tendineae from the inferior papillary muscle anchor the inferior tricuspid leaflet. The septal tricuspid leaflet is anchored by the multiple septal chordae tendineae. The septal tricuspid leaflet divides the membranous septum into the atrioventricular and interventricular portions.

Figure 50 The catheter placed at the inferior margin of the membranous septum.

The left image is viewed from the anterior direction, and the right image is viewed from the left anterior oblique direction. The membranous septum is transilluminated (left). The membranous septum tilts toward the right anterior direction along with the tilting of the aortic root. The catheter is fixed at the angle created by this tilting at the inferior margin of the membranous septum, where is the location of the bundle of His. Refer to Figure 5. The location is close to the commissure between the septal and antero-superior tricuspid leaflets, commonly on its septal tricuspid leaflet side. When viewed from the left anterior oblique view, reflecting the width of the orifice of the inferior vena cava, the catheter directs toward the septal direction. It does not show tangential straight shape, which is perfectly foreshortened, even though the ventricular

septum is seen tangentially. If the optimal left anterior oblique angulation is defined as the view showing the ventricular septum tangentially, this indicates that setting the left anterior oblique angulation based on the shape of the His-catheter could be far left anterior oblique than the optimal angulation. Insufficient or excessive left anterior oblique angulation relative to the optimal angulation would complicate the procedure related to the ventricular septum. For example, if the left anterior oblique angulation is insufficient relative to the optimal angulation, the septal direction is readily feasible even if the catheter actually directs toward the anterior free wall. On the other hand, excessive left anterior oblique angulation could hardly allow the catheter to point the septal direction even if the catheter is actually placed on the ventricular septum.8

The left image is viewed from the right anterior oblique direction, and the right image is viewed from the left anterior oblique direction. The catheter is fixed at the superior tricuspid valve attachment. This U-turn approach can theoretically

avoid direct injury to the antero-superior tricuspid leaflet,9 compared to the conventional ablation of the tricuspid annulus, sandwiching the leaflet between the catheter tip and annulus.

Figure 52 The horizontal section showing the four-chamber image viewed from the superior direction.1

The commissure between the inferior and septal tricuspid leaflets is anchored by the inferior papillary muscle. Due to deeply wedged bilateral atrioventricular groove, lateral annulus of the mitral and tricuspid valve is located medial relative to the basal-lateral free wall. Thus, the basal free wall of the right ventricle shows a right-angled bending, suggesting the need for the U-turn approach if this region is related to the accessory pathways or ventricular arrhythmias. The space between the antero-medial right atrium and the basal ventricular septum is the inferior pyramidal space. In this heart, the

epicardial fibro-adipose tissue filling the inferior pyramidal space is removed. This basal infero-septal left ventricle found at the offset between the mitral and tricuspid annulus is referred to as the infero-septal process.10 Refer to Figure 46. Thus, the inferior pyramidal space is sandwiched between the infero-septal process and the floor of the triangle of Koch at the antero-medial right atrium. This inferior pyramidal space allows the atrioventricular nodal artery to ascend toward the atrioventricular node located at the right-side of the central fibrous body. The paired section of this image is Figure 53.

Figure 53 The horizontal section showing the four-chamber image viewed from the inferior direction.1

The inferior and septal tricuspid leaflet is cut on this plane. The antero-superior tricuspid leaflet is observed along the supraventricular crest away from the observer. The tricuspid annulus is located apical to the mitral annulus. The offset between the tricuspid and mitral annuli at the basal inferior ventricular septum corresponds to the region of the inferoseptal process and inferior pyramidal space. Refer to Figure 46. The epicardial adipose tissue filling the inferior pyramidal

space is removed. The antero-medial right atrium close to the septal tricuspid leaflet, corresponding to the floor of the triangle of Koch, is facing to the infero-septal process10 intervened by the inferior pyramidal space.11 The trabeculation is apparently coarse and extensive in the right ventricle compared to the fine trabeculation in the left ventricle. The paired section of this image is Figure 52.

Figure 54 The ablation catheter placed around the tricuspid annulus.

The tricuspid annulus is a substrate for idiopathic ventricular arrhythmia with septal region predominance.12 The catheter is placed at the basal-lateral right ventricle (upper), infero-lateral tricuspid annulus with the U-turn approach (lower left), and basal infero-medial right ventricle (lower right) via the inferior vena cava. The tricuspid valve is located apical relative to the mitral valve. Rich trabeculations are observed around the lateral and inferior tricuspid annulus. On the contrary, the endocardial surface is much smoother around the superior and septal tricuspid annulus.
