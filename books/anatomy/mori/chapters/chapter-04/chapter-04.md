Figure 22 The heart and standard electrocardiographic electrodes viewed from the anterior direction.1

The standard limb (upper right) and precordial (left) electrodes are overlaid on the heart viewed from the anterior direction. Generally, the V1 and V2 electrodes are located anterior to the right atrial appendage and right ventricular outflow tract, respectively.2 The V4 electrode is located left anterior to the cardiac apex. The limb leads I, II, and III are bipolar recordings using the right arm, right arm, and left arm as a negative, or reference, inputs, respectively. Bipolar recordings measure the difference in potential between two electrodes, showing the relative electrical potential as the vector. The precordial leads are unipolar recordings using the Wilson central terminal, the compound outputs of the left arm, right arm, and left leg, as a reference inputs. aVR, aVL, and aVF limb leads are augmented unipolar recordings using the compound outputs from left arm and leg, right arm and left leg, and left and right arm, as a negative inputs, respectively. Unipolar recordings measure absolute electrical potential at a single site relative to the potential at reference site that is deemed to be zero. Individually variable cardiac and thoracic anatomy are the major determinants to affect QRS complex, including the location of the heart, conduction tissue around the heart, shape of the heart, anatomy of the conduction system,3 in addition to electrical features, including complicated propagation of the excitation4 and cancellation of electrical forces.5 Any simple frontal plane as well as horizontal or sagittal plane cannot precisely represent the three-dimensional anatomical axis of the ventricular mass directing from the right postero-superior direction toward the left antero-inferior direction. In addition, there are significant individual variations in the orientation of the heart6 and its three-dimensional relationship between the electrodes. Therefore, three-dimensional anatomical axis does not necessarily show the good correlation with electrical QRS-axis evaluated on the selected frontal or horizontal planes.7 Precise appreciation of individual three-dimensional anatomical relationship between the heart and electrodes is fundamental. However, considering significant individual variations in anatomy and complex three-dimensional electrical forces,8 full understanding of the individual electrocardiogram still requires further sophisticated approach.

Figure 23 The whole heart and precordial electrodes viewed from the superior direction.1

The precordial electrodes are overlaid on the heart viewed from the superior direction. Although this kind of horizontal two-dimensional image is frequently illustrated with all precordial electrodes, it is axiomatic that the electrodes are not located on the same flat horizontal plane. The plane involving the V3 electrode, the plane involving the V4–V6 electrodes are different from the plane involving the V1 and V2 electrodes. The V1, V2, and V4 electrodes are located anterior to the right atrial appendage, right ventricular outflow tract (infundibulum), and cardiac apex, respectively. The V5 and V6 electrodes are commonly distant from the heart with the left lung intervening.

Figure 24 The heart and precordial electrodes: The horizontal plane at the level between the V1–V2 and V3 electrodes.1

The precordial electrodes are overlaid on the heart viewed from the superior direction. As this horizontal section shows the level between the V1–V2 and V3 electrodes, V4–V6 electrodes located inferior to this sectional plane are masked. The V1 and V2 electrodes are located anterior to the right atrial appendage and right ventricular outflow tract (infundibulum), respectively. The V3 electrode is located on the extending line of the superior ventricular septum. The right ventricular outflow tract is located anterior to the left ventricular outflow tract and left anterior to the aortic root. When viewing the left posterior direction from the V1, the basal-lateral wall of the right ventricular outflow tract is the closest, followed by the basal superior ventricular septum, and the supero-lateral free wall of the left ventricle. The supraventricular crest at the superior tricuspid annulus directs toward the V1 from the region anterior to the nadir of the right coronary aortic sinus. Similarly, when viewing the posterior direction from the V1, the right atrial appendage is the closest, followed by the precaval bundle, also referred to as the arcuate ridge, the superior vena cava, the superior interatrial fold superior to the fossa ovalis, and the right superior pulmonary vein.

Figure 25 The heart and precordial electrodes: The horizontal plane at the level of the V4–V6 electrodes.1

The heart shows an apical four-chamber image. The precordial electrodes are overlaid on the heart viewed from the superior direction. As this section is the level of the V4–V6 electrodes, V1–V3 electrodes located superior to this sectional plane are masked. The V4 electrode is located left anterior to the cardiac apex on the extending line of the inferior ventricular septum. Compared to V1 to V4 electrodes, the distance from the V5 and V6 electrodes to the heart is greater because of the intervening left lung. Generally, when considering the QRS-wave morphology of the ventricular arrhythmia, the difference in the vertical location between the V1–V2 and V4–V6 electrodes are not well appreciated and tend to be described as if they are located on the same flat plane in many simplified illustrations. However, this vertical difference matters as the electrical current should propagate three-dimensionally. For example, ventricular arrhythmia originating from the basal ventricular septum on this inferior plane,9 corresponding to the infero-septal process10 or infero-septal mitral annulus,11 generally demonstrates R-wave predominance in every V1–V6 electrode as the region is distant from the V1–V6 electrodes. On the contrary, ventricular arrhythmia originating from the basal ventricular septum on the previous superior plane, corresponding to the septal left ventricular outflow tract12 and the crest of the ventricular septum supporting the right coronary aortic sinus,13 generally demonstrates S-wave predominance in V1 and V2 electrodes, as the focus gets closer to the V1 and V2 in the plane. To achieve R-wave predominance in every V1–V6 electrode on/above this superior plane, the arrhythmogenic foci need to be located away from the V1 and V2 electrodes toward the left posterior direction along the left ventricular outflow tract and mitral annulus. These foci correspond to the left ventricular basal superior free wall supporting the anterior half of the left coronary aortic sinus,14 left ventricular summit,15 and superior and supero-lateral mitral annulus;11 all the regions are known to show precordial R-wave predominance. This focus shift from the basal superior ventricular septum toward the basal supero-lateral free wall has less effect on R-wave predominance observed in the V4–V6 electrodes, as the V4–V6 electrodes are located on the different inferior plane consistently distant from these superior foci. However, due to this focus shift from the basal superior ventricular septum toward the supero-lateral (left posterior) direction, the V5 and V6 electrodes show s waves combined with a decrease in R-wave amplitude.16,17
