Figure 35 The coronary sinus viewed from the atrial side.1

The coronary sinus is located inferior to the left atrial vestibule around the attachment of the posterior mitral leaflet. The inferior half of the coronary sinus orifice is guarded by the Thebesian valve. The Thebesian valve is found in the ninetenths of the dissected hearts,2 and it covers more than 50% of the coronary sinus orifice in one-third of the dissected hearts3 with various morphologies.4 The non-coronary aortic sinus wedges on the antero-superior interatrial groove between the supero-medial wall of the right and left atrium. This wedging of the non-coronary aortic sinus creates the left and right

aortic mound into each atrium, the imprint of the aortic root bulging into the atria. Between the orifice of the coronary sinus and the non-coronary aortic sinus, the antero-inferior muscular buttress (also referred to as the anterior limbus of the fossa ovalis) is working as the muscular component of the true atrial septum. The paired section of this image is Figure 41.

When the Thebesian valve is prominent, it can work as the anatomical obstacle to the procedure related to the coronary venous system.5 Right anterior oblique (left) and left anterior oblique (right) views show further

forced pushing maneuvers do not resolve this situation to insert the catheter into the coronary sinus. Refer to Figure 37.

Figure 37 The ablation catheter avoiding the Thebesian valve.

Right anterior oblique (left) and left anterior oblique (right) views show the optimal curve and course of the catheter to avoid entrapment by the Thebesian valve guarding the inferior orifice of the coronary sinus. Unless the patients have coronary sinus atresia, the catheter can be slid from the superior side of the coronary sinus orifice, with the catheter tip

scanning the supero-medial direction. The right image also shows that the height of the Eustachian ridge becomes prominent in the medial portion. From the superior approach, clockwise torque makes the catheter tip direct toward anterior wall of the coronary sinus and vice versa. Refer to Figure 36.

Figure 38 The ablation catheter located at the septal isthmus viewed from the right anterior oblique direction: Right atrial image.

The left image shows the catheter tip location during a slow pathway modification at the septal isthmus just anterior to the coronary sinus orifice. The septal isthmus is the potential location of the right inferior nodal extension.6 In some cases, with left variant atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia using the left inferior nodal extension, an intra-coronary sinus approach is required (right) to ablate anterior wall of the coronary sinus.7 When viewing from the right anterior oblique direction, the septal isthmus and anterior wall of the coronary sinus orifice is not a simple flat plane facing to the operator

as shown by some illustrations. Rather, the septal isthmus shows a funnel-shaped slope leaning away from the observer toward the coronary sinus orifice.8 Optimal contact and fixation of the tip requires fine torque adjustments of the catheter to trace this funnel shaped anatomy, in addition to push/pull maneuvers. Left anterior oblique view is useful to adjust the clockwise/counterclockwise torque, as well as to estimate the proximity to the mid-septum region to avoid inadvertent injury to the compact atrioventricular node (yellow arrow). Refer to Figure 39.

Figure 39 The ablation catheter located at the septal isthmus viewed from the right anterior oblique direction: Open heart image.

The left image shows the common location of the slow pathway modification, corresponding to the right inferior nodal extension. The membranous septum is transilluminated. The right image shows the deeper section with the removal of the muscular ventricular septum, showing the close relationship between the anterior wall of the coronary sinus orifice and the left ventricular basal infero-medial wall, referred to as the infero-septal process. Epicardial ablation via the coronary sinus9

is an alternative approach to the transaortic retrograde or transseptal antegrade approaches to treat the ventricular arrhythmia originating from the infero-septal process.10 At this region, thin epicardial fibro-adipose tissue containing the atrioventricular nodal artery, referred to as the inferior pyramidal space, intervenes between the right atrium and the left ventricle.8 Refer to Figure 38.

Figure 40 The sequential images of the ablation catheter tracing the cavotricuspid isthmus viewed from the right anterior oblique direction: Right atrial image.

The ablation catheter is pulled back from the tricuspid annulus to the inferior vena cava. The surface of the cavotricuspid isthmus is irregular due to the variable course and thickness of the pectinate muscles,11 sub-Thebesian recess, also referred to as the sub-Eustachian pouch12 and Eustachian valve. These structures are the anatomical obstacles that prevent optimal attachment of the catheter tip to the isthmus floor. The prominent Eustachian valve acts as a fulcrum for the catheter

(lower right image on the left page and upper left image on the right page), preventing the tip from optimal contact to the region even if full deflection is applied.11 The lower image on the right page shows the U-turn approach to reach the potential lesion gaps. To secure the optimal contact, use of the deflectable long sheath, or lateral shift of the ablation line is also effective as the Eustachian ridge becomes less prominent in the lateral portion. Refer to Figure 37.
