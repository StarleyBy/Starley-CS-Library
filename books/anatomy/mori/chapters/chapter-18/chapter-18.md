Figure 120 The left ventricle divided into septal and lateral parts.1

The right image on the left page shows the left ventricular specimen viewed from the anterior direction showing the sectional plane. The septal part (left image on the left page) involves no papillary muscles, and related to the right coronary aortic sinus and anterior half of the non-coronary aortic sinus. The lateral part (left image on the right page) involves both infero-medial and supero-lateral papillary muscles and mitral annulus, and related to left coronary aortic sinus and

posterior half of the non-coronary aortic sinus.2 The right image shows the illustration of the left image on the right page. The infero-medial and supero-lateral papillary muscles are located in vertical fashion rather than horizontal fashion.3 Each infero-medial and supero-lateral papillary muscles give multiple chordae tendineae to the medial and lateral part of both anterior and posterior mitral leaflets, respectively. The images on the right page show the infero-septal process inferior to the central fibrous body, also referred to as the right fibrous trigone. Refer to Figure 12.

Figure 121 Septal and lateral surface of the left ventricle.1

The left and right images show the bisected left heart viewed from the left posterior oblique and right anterior oblique directions, respectively. The septal section has no papillary muscles, only showing fine apical trabeculation with smooth surface at the basal ventricular septum. The membranous septum between the right and non-coronary aortic sinuses is

transilluminated. The free wall section involves mitral leaflets and both infero-medial and supero-lateral papillary muscles arising from the middle region of the left ventricle. The left and non-coronary aortic sinuses are observed. The trabeculations are extensive compared to the septal section.

Figure 122 The frontal section of the heart viewed from the posterior direction.1

The heart is viewed from the posterior direction. Both papillary muscles are related to the left ventricular free wall, being located in vertical fashion. Left ventricular trabeculations are prominent in the lateral free wall rather than the septal endocardial surface. The infero-septal process of the left ventricle4 faces to the right atrium intervened by the inferior pyramidal space.5 The atrioventricular portion of the membranous septum tilts toward the right atrium along with the tilting of the

aortic root. This angulation is where the His catheter is fixed,6 corresponding to the location of the penetrating bundle, the bundle of His.7 The basal superior left ventricular muscle supports the left coronary aortic sinus. The width of the myocardium directly supporting the left coronary aortic sinus (black arrow), corresponding to the myocardial crescent, is thin.8 The paired section of this image is Figure 30.

Figure 123 The catheter placed at the supero-lateral and infero-medial papillary muscles.

The heart is sectioned at the mid-ventricular level and viewed from the left anterior oblique direction. The catheter is placed at the supero-lateral (left) and infero-medial (right) papillary muscles using the transaortic retrograde approach.

Figure 124 The catheter placed at the supero-lateral papillary muscle.

The heart is viewed from the right anterior oblique direction. The muscular ventricular septum is removed to observe the left ventricular free wall. The catheter is placed at the supero-lateral papillary muscle using the transaortic retrograde approach (lower left image on the left page), retrograde U-turn approach (upper image on the left page), and transseptal

antegrade approach (image on the right page). Note the parallel alignment to the supero-lateral papillary muscle is readily feasible using the antegrade approach, whereas the retrograde approach is not feasible unless the U-turn approach is used.

Figure 125 The catheter placed at the infero-medial papillary muscle.

The heart is viewed from the right anterior oblique direction. The muscular ventricular septum is removed to observe the left ventricular free wall. The catheter is placed at the infero-medial papillary muscle using the transaortic retrograde

approach (left) and transseptal antegrade approach (right). Note the parallel alignment to the infero-medial papillary muscle is readily feasible using the retrograde approach, whereas the antegrade approach is not.

Figure 126 The left ventricular apical thinning.1

The four-chamber cut section viewed from the superior direction (left) shows the physiological localized apical thinning of the left ventricle. When viewed from the apex (right), the clockwise vortex of the myocardial alignment is appreciated. A light source placed in the left ventricle transilluminates the localized apical thinning at the center of the vortex, lateral to

the distal left anterior descending artery. This anatomy suggests the potential risk of apical perforation.9 Generally, the apical thickness is less than 3.0 mm with average area of 5.0 mm2 , 10 equivalent to the cross-section area of 7.5-French catheter. Thin wall of the right ventricular apex is also appreciated.

Figure 127 The catheter placed at the left ventricular apex.

The heart is viewed from the right anterior oblique direction. The muscular ventricular septum is removed to observe the left ventricular free wall. The catheter is placed at the left ventricular apex using the transaortic retrograde approach (left) and transseptal antegrade approach (right). When using the retrograde approach, the catheter runs along the infero-medial papillary muscle to reach the apex. Thus, the initial direction of the catheter toward the base of the infero-medial papillary

muscle corresponds to the mid-infero-lateral wall of the left ventricle. Therefore, during any procedures using bulky system via the retrograde approach, the brunt of rough and direct force increases the risk for harming this infero-lateral region. This is because of the physiological angulation created between the left ventricular axis and aortic axis, which are not parallel. When using the transseptal approach, the catheter runs along the supero-lateral papillary muscle to reach the apex.
