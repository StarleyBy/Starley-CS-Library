Figure 55 The atrioventricular junction viewed from the atrial side.1

The light source placed within the left ventricular outflow tract transilluminates the interleaflet triangles between the aortic sinuses, anterior mitral leaflet, and the atrioventricular portion of the membranous septum. The less transilluminated thick and firm fibrous tissue located at the bottom of the non-coronary aortic sinus is the right fibrous trigone, also referred to as the central fibrous body.1 This firm, fibrous tissue connects the aortic root (non-coronary aortic sinus), anterior mitral leaflet, atrial septum (antero-inferior muscular buttress), ventricular septum, infero-septal process, the membranous septum, and the septal tricuspid leaflet. The interleaflet triangle between the non-coronary and right coronary aortic sinuses is located superior to the membranous septum. It is separated from the membranous septum by the ventriculo-infundibular

fold.2 Thus, the membranous septum is the anatomically true septum between the right atrium/ventricle and the left ventricular outflow tract. On the contrary, the interleaflet triangle above the membranous septum is not the septum, but it just separates the distal end of the left ventricular outflow tract from the right-side transverse sinus. As all of three interleaflet triangles incorporated into the aortic root are located beneath the semi-lunar hingelines of the aortic valve leaflets, they are hemodynamically the components of the left ventricular outflow tract.3 These interleaflet triangles are structurally the components of the aortic root extending between the virtual basal ring and sinutubular junction,4 though. The atrioventricular nodal artery ascends toward the central fibrous body, posterior to the infero-septal process. Refer to Figure 46.

Figure 56 Progressive dissection of the right heart viewed from the anterior direction.1

The whole heart is viewed from the anterior direction (upper left). The progressive dissection of the right heart (lower left and right) reveals the deep and central location of the membranous septum inferior to the aortic root. The membranous septum is located on the crest of the ventricular septum, inferior to the interleaflet triangle between the non-coronary and right coronary aortic sinuses. The membranous septum composes supero-medial part of the right ventricular inflow. The black line in the image on the right page shows the postero-lateral attachment of the right ventricle, corresponding to the inferior margin of the ventriculo-infundibular fold.1 The membranous septum is separated from the interleaflet triangle by this line. The nadir of the right coronary aortic sinus is located inferior to this line. In other words, this line is located superior to the virtual basal ring at the base of the right coronary aortic sinus. Thus, this line corresponds to the

![](_page_4_Picture_0.jpeg)

ventriculo-arterial junction at this region. This means the part of the crest of the ventricular septum is incorporated at the base of the right coronary aortic sinus.5 This structural anatomy is also referred to as the myocardial crescent supporting the right coronary aortic sinus.5 This myocardial crescent is the potential substrate of ventricular arrhythmia ablated from the right coronary aortic sinus.6 Left antero-superior to the membranous septum, the medial papillary muscle is located anterior to the nadir of the right coronary aortic sinus. The medial papillary muscle is generally found close to the bifurcation of the superior and inferior limbs of the septomarginal trabeculation, at its inferior limb side. The superior limb of the septomarginal trabeculation ascends toward the left adjacent pulmonary sinus. The proximal part of the superior limb is the superior limit of the ventricular septum in the right ventricular outflow tract. Refer to Figure 81.

Figure 57 Left ventricular aspect of the membranous septum.1

The heart is viewed from the left postero-superior direction. The atrial septum is sectioned almost tangentially. Transillumination reveals the location of the membranous septum (right), infero-apical to the interleaflet triangle between the right and non-coronary aortic sinuses.7 The crest of the ventricular septum just apical to the inferior margin of the membranous septum, corresponding to the origin of the left bundle branch, bulges toward the left ventricular outflow tract.

![](_page_6_Picture_0.jpeg)

The extent of this bulging varies among individuals.8 The muscular ventricular septum shows many fine apical trabeculations without papillary muscles. The location of the membranous septum relative to the virtual basal ring plane of the aortic root is variable.2

Figure 58 The horizontal section at the level of the membranous septum viewed from the superior direction.1

The horizontal section is made at the level of the atrioventricular portion of the membranous septum below the bottom of the non-coronary aortic sinus. The membranous septum is located between the crest of the muscular ventricular septum and the atrial septum, corresponding to the antero-inferior muscular buttress. The septal tricuspid leaflet divides the membranous septum into the atrioventricular and interventricular portions in unequal fashion. Therefore, the membranous septum separates the right atrial vestibule and right ventricular inflow from the left ventricular outflow tract. The right fibrous trigone is the triangular-shaped, firm, fibrous thickening continuing from the bottom of the non-coronary aortic sinus toward the infero-septal commissure to support the medial part of the anterior mitral leaflet.9 The septal tricuspid leaflet, anterior mitral leaflet, and the membranous septum are connected to this thick fibrous tissue. This fibrous tissue

![](_page_8_Picture_0.jpeg)

also connects the aortic root (non-coronary aortic sinus), ventricular septum, atrial septum (antero-inferior muscular buttress), and infero-septal process of the left ventricle. The right fibrous trigone is also referred to as the central fibrous body,1,9,10 which is the keystone of the fibrous cardiac skeleton.11 Sometimes, the central fibrous body is described as the concept involving both the right fibrous trigone and the atrioventricular portion of the membranous septum.11 Macroscopically, even using the transillumination, clear demarcation between the right fibrous trigone and the membranous septum is difficult. The atrioventricular node is generally located on the right atrial side of the central fibrous body9 at the apex of the inferior pyramidal space. The bundle of His penetrates the central fibrous body to emerge to the inferior rim of the atrioventricular portion of the membranous septum. The paired section of this image is Figure 59.

Figure 59 The horizontal section at the level of the membranous septum viewed from the inferior direction.1

The membranous septum is located between the crest of the muscular ventricular septum and the atrial septum (anteroinferior muscular buttress). The membranous septum is in continuity with the right fibrous trigone, which is the firm fibrous thickening extending inferiorly from the bottom of the non-coronary aortic sinus.9 The right fibrous trigone is also referred to as the central fibrous body.1,9,10 The central fibrous body is the keystone of the cardiac skeleton,11 connecting the

![](_page_10_Picture_0.jpeg)

membranous septum, septal tricuspid leaflet, and anterior mitral leaflet. It also supports the aortic root (non-coronary aortic sinus), atrial septum (antero-inferior muscular buttress), crest of the ventricular septum, and infero-septal process of the left ventricle. The non-coronary and right coronary aortic sinuses are located superior to the membranous septum. The paired section of this image is Figure 58.

Figure 60 The catheter placed at the inferior margin of the membranous septum.

The heart is viewed from the left anterior oblique direction. The catheter is placed at the approximate location of the atrioventricular conduction axis, at the inferior margin of the membranous septum. The tip is on the superior septal attachment of the septal tricuspid leaflet. Transillumination from the left ventricular outflow tract (right) reveals the

![](_page_12_Picture_0.jpeg)

membranous septum. The membranous septum tilts toward the lateral direction against the muscular ventricular septum, along with the lateral tilting of the aortic root.

Figure 61 The ablation catheter placed at the superior paraseptal region.12

The images are viewed from the right anterior oblique (left) and left anterior oblique (right) directions. The membranous septum is transilluminated in the left image. The catheter is placed on the infero-medial part of the supraventricular crest. This region corresponds to the supero-medial tricuspid annulus. It is superior and lateral to the membranous septum. The ventricular aspect of this region is the supraventricular crest adjacent to the right coronary aortic sinus. The atrial aspect of

![](_page_14_Picture_0.jpeg)

this region is the right atrial vestibule. If the tip is pulled back medially closer to the superior margin of the atrioventricular portion of the membranous septum, the region corresponds to the right aortic mound adjacent to the anterior half of the non-coronary aortic sinus. Refer to Figures 9 and 10. These regions are safe in terms of the injury to the atrioventricular conduction axis.

Figure 62 The ablation catheter placed at the septal region.12

The images are viewed from the right anterior oblique (left) and left anterior oblique (right) directions. The membranous septum is transilluminated in the left image. The catheter is placed at the membranous septum, which is the true anatomical septum between the right atrium/ventricle and left ventricular outflow tract. Thus, this approach has a potential risk

![](_page_16_Picture_0.jpeg)

to create iatrogenic Gerbode-type atrioventricular shunt,13 or interventricular shunt depending on the location of the tip relative to the attachment of the septal tricuspid leaflet.14

Figure 63 The ablation catheter placed at the bundle of His.12

The images are viewed from the right anterior oblique (left) and left anterior oblique (right) directions. The membranous septum is transilluminated in the left image. The catheter is placed at the inferior margin of the atrioventricular portion of the membranous septum. This is exact location of the penetrating bundle of the atrioventricular conduction axis, referred

![](_page_18_Picture_0.jpeg)

to as the bundle of His. Therefore, any invasive approach should be withheld at this region except the His-bundle pacing or intentional blockade of the atrioventricular conduction.

Figure 64 The ablation catheter placed at the mid-paraseptal region.12

The images are viewed from the right anterior oblique (left) and left anterior oblique (right) directions. The membranous septum is transilluminated in the left image. The catheter is placed at the mid-paraseptal region, the floor of the triangle of Koch between the membranous septum and the coronary sinus orifice. In the left image, the tip is located at the inferior part of the mid-paraseptal region slightly away from the main body of the atrioventricular node. The compact atrioventricular node is commonly located between this tip location and infero-posterior margin of the membranous

![](_page_20_Picture_0.jpeg)

septum. Therefore, any invasive approach to the mid-paraseptal region should be withheld to protect the compact atrioventricular node. On the contrary, atrioventricular nodal ablation can be tried within this mid-paraseptal region between the membranous septum and coronary sinus orifice.15 As estimated from the left image, the compact atrioventricular node should be located slightly to the atrial and inferior side relative to the bundle of His. Refer to Figure 67.

Figure 65 The ablation catheter placed at the inferior-paraseptal region.12

The images are viewed from the right anterior oblique (left) and left anterior oblique (right) directions. The membranous septum is transilluminated in the left image. The catheter is placed at the inferior-paraseptal region, corresponding to the septal isthmus between the septal attachment of the septal tricuspid leaflet and the coronary sinus orifice. This is the common site to modify the slow pathway that is related to the right inferior nodal extension.16 The septal isthmus is not a simple, flat plane facing toward the observer viewing from the right anterior oblique direction. Rather, the plane involving the septal isthmus is almost perpendicular relative to the plane involving the membranous septum.12 Therefore, the

![](_page_22_Picture_0.jpeg)

catheter tip has to trace this funnel-like anatomy continuing to the coronary sinus orifice to modify the slow pathway. This means that a pull-back manipulation requires concomitant clockwise torque to keep the tip attach to the region. Therefore, to successfully perform the slow pathway modification during radiofrequency catheter ablation, delicate clockwise rotation torque combined with intermittent counter torque needs to be applied referring to the left anterior oblique view, in addition to the careful pull-back manipulation referring to the right anterior oblique view.

Figure 66 The ablation catheter placed at the cavotricuspid isthmus.12

The images are viewed from the right anterior oblique (left) and left anterior oblique (right) directions. The catheter is placed at the cavotricuspid isthmus between the tricuspid annulus and inferior vena cava. The pectinate muscles radiating from the crista terminalis run within this isthmus in oblique fashion. The sub-Thebesian recess,17 also referred to as the sub-Eustachian pouch,18 is noted infero-lateral to the coronary sinus orifice. The Eustachian valve is guarding the orifice

![](_page_24_Picture_0.jpeg)

of the inferior vena cava. The height of the Eustachian valve is higher in medial attachment and less prominent in the lateral portion. The Eustachian valve continues to the anterior limbus of the fossa ovalis. Along the septal attachment of the Eustachian valve, the tendon of Todaro runs within the anterior limbus to the left antero-superior direction to eventually fuse with the central fibrous body. Refer to Figure 40.

Figure 67 The macroscopic image of the atrioventricular node and conduction axis with progressive dissection.

The images are viewed from the right anterior oblique direction. The atrioventricular conduction axis is dissected using stereoscopic microscope. Transillumination of the membranous septum (upper left) reveals the predominant interventricular portion, compared to the small atrioventricular portion. The proportion of each portion is variable depending on the location of the attachment of the septal tricuspid leaflet. The small part of the septal tricuspid leaflet, as well as the right atrial myocardium at the apex of the triangle of Koch are removed (upper right). The compact atrioventricular node is found at the postero-inferior corner of the membranous septum,19 lying on the thick central fibrous body. Beneath the right atrial myocardium, the node is covered by the thin epicardial adipose tissue of the apex of the inferior pyramidal space. The bundle of His (penetrating bundle) cannot be observed, as it is covered by the central fibrous body. The central fibrous body covering the bundle of His as well as the thin fibrous tissue at the inferior rim of the membranous septum is further carefully removed (lower) to reveal the atrioventricular conduction axis. The location of the bundle of His relative to the membranous septum20,21 and relative to the crest of the ventricular septum22 is variable.
