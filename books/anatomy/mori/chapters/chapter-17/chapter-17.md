Figure 113 The atrioventricular junction viewed from the right posterior direction.1

The aortic root, specifically the non-coronary aortic sinus, wedges between the mitral and tricuspid valves. The tricuspid annulus is located apical relative to the mitral annulus. Thus, the triangular left ventricular free wall between the mitral and tricuspid annuli faces to the right atrium, intervened by the inferior pyramidal space.2 This part of the basal medial left ventricle is referred to as the infero-septal process of the left ventricle.3 The anterior mitral leaflet, also referred to as the aortic leaflet of the mitral valve, is in continuity with the aortic root via the aortic-to-mitral (aortomitral) continuity, specifically with the interleaflet triangle between the left and non-coronary aortic sinuses. Although there is no anatomical boundary between them when viewed from the ventricular side, the attachment of the left atrial anterior wall divides the interleaflet triangle from the aortic-to-mitral continuity when viewed from the atrial side. In this regard, the interleaflet triangle faces to the left ventricular outflow tract and transverse sinus, but the aortic-to-mitral continuity faces to the left

ventricular outflow tract and internal left atrium. The posterior mitral leaflet, also referred to as the mural leaflet of the mitral valve, arises from the basal left ventricular free wall mass. The supero-lateral commissure is close to the nadir of the left coronary aortic sinus, whereas the infero-septal commissure is close to the nadir of the non-coronary aortic sinus. The strong fibrous tissues supporting the lateral and medial part of the anterior mitral leaflet are the left and right fibrous trigones, respectively.4 The left fibrous trigone extends from the nadir of the left coronary aortic sinus toward the supero-lateral commissure. The right fibrous trigone extends from the nadir of the non-coronary aortic sinus toward the infero-septal commissure. The right fibrous trigone is more extensive than the left fibrous trigone,1 rendering the infero-septal commissure distant from the aortic root, compared to the distance between the aortic root to the supero-lateral commissure. The right fibrous trigone is also referred to as the central fibrous body.1,4

Figure 114 Atrioventricular nodal artery and the mitral valve.1

The atrioventricular nodal artery ascends toward the compact atrioventricular node located at the right atrial side of the central fibrous body, also referred to as the right fibrous trigone.1,4 Thus, from the left atrial side, medial mitral annulus close to the infero-septal commissure is adjacent to the atrioventricular nodal artery and compact atrioventricular node, intervened by the central fibrous body. The atrioventricular nodal artery is located within the inferior pyramidal space, which is the sandwiched epicardial adipose tissue wedging from the inferior cardiac crux.5 The epicardial adipose tissue is, however,

removed in this heart. The inferior pyramidal space is located between the mitral annulus and tricuspid annulus, posterior to the infero-septal process of the left ventricle.3 When viewed from the right atrial side, the inferior pyramidal space corresponds to the floor of the triangle of Koch.6 Neither the supero-lateral nor the infero-septal commissure reaches to the level of the mitral annulus. The proportion of the posterior mitral leaflet within the entire circumference of the mitral annulus is larger than that of the anterior mitral leaflet, occupying two-thirds to three-fourths of the entire mitral annulus.7

Figure 115 The mitral valve showing the mitral annular disjunction.<sup>1</sup>

The interleaflet triangle between the left and non-coronary aortic sinuses, anterior and posterior mitral leaflets, and mitral annular disjunction are transilluminated. The mitral annular disjunction is a separation between the atrial wall-mitral valve junction and the basal left ventricular myocardium.<sup>8</sup> The mitral annular disjunction was initially illustrated by J. Henle with the German term meaning *fibrous ring*.<sup>9</sup> McAlpine refers to disjunction as the subvalvular segment of the aorto-ventricular membrane or subvalvular membrane.<sup>1</sup> The mitral annular disjunction is generally prominent at the attachment of the lateral (P1) and medial (P3) scallops in continuity with bilateral fibrous trigones,<sup>7</sup> and rarely encircles entire circumference of the attachment of the posterior mitral leaflet as demonstrated in this image.<sup>10</sup> It is exclusively related to the posterior mitral leaflet at its attachment, as the one of the thin fibrous anatomical structures within the normal left ventricle.<sup>7</sup> Thus, it should be a high-risk area during any invasive approach performed involving this region, including radiofrequency catheter ablation of the accessory pathway<sup>11</sup> or ventricular arrhythmia originating from the mitral annulus,<sup>12</sup> mitral valve surgery,<sup>13</sup> and transcatheter mitral valve replacement. Potential relationships between the mitral annular disjunction and mitral valve prolapse

or ventricular arrhythmia14 have been suggested. The aortic-to-mitral (aortomitral) continuity refers to the fibrous structure extending at the base of the anterior mitral leaflet between the right and left fibrous trigone. Thus, the aortic-to-mitral continuity is generally devoid of ventricular myocardium. It is the component of the virtual basal ring of the aortic root, known as the annulus of the aortic root. It extends between the superiorly located interleaflet triangle and inferiorly located anterior mitral leaflet. The left atrial attachment divides the interleaflet triangle from the aortic-to-mitral continuity. However, the aortic-to-mitral continuity is hardly distinguishable from the anterior mitral leaflet.15 The functional differentiation of the aortic-to-mitral continuity from the anterior mitral leaflet can be made by the hingeline of the anterior mitral leaflet, as the aortic-to-mitral continuity is a not mobile structure. Thus, the height of the aortic-to-mitral continuity is seldom more than 10 mm.15 The aortic-to-mitral continuity is also referred to as the intervalvular fibrous body,15 or aortomitral curtain by cardiac surgeons16 as the potential region to intervene when enlarging the annulus of the aortic root.

Figure 116 The transaortic retrograde approach ablating the endocardial side of the left ventricular summit near the supero-lateral commissure.

The heart is viewed from the right anterior oblique (left) and left anterior oblique (right) directions. The left ventricular free wall supports the anterior half of the left coronary aortic sinus. The epicardial side of the left ventricular free wall is the left ventricular summit. The catheter is placed at the superior mitral annulus, corresponding to the endocardial region of the left ventricular summit. This region is located slightly apical to the supero-lateral commissure and lateral to the left fibrous trigone and aortic-to-mitral (aortomitral) continuity.17 To reach this region, acute bend with small curve and strong counterclockwise torque is necessary. In the left image, the muscular ventricular septum is removed. The basal superior margin of the section involves the inferior margin of the membranous septum. Confusingly, in the field of electrophysiology,

ventricular arrhythmia originating from the aortic-to-mitral continuity generally refers to this region18 that is close to the left fibrous trigone and left ventricular summit.19 In fact, this region is the basal superior left ventricular free wall, or the endocardial side of the left ventricular summit, and also identical to the superior mitral annulus. This region should not be referred to as the true anatomical aortic-to-mitral continuity, which is the fibrous structure extending at the base of the anterior mitral leaflet between the right and left fibrous trigone, and between the interleaflet triangle and anterior mitral leaflet. The aortic-to-mitral continuity is generally devoid of ventricular myocardium.20 The thickness of the left ventricular free wall myocardium supporting the left coronary aortic sinus is generally less than 3.0 mm in average.21

Figure 117 The transaortic retrograde approach to map the subvalvular region of the mitral valve and the inferoseptal recess.

These are the sections showing the mitral valve. As the tricuspid valve is located apical to the mitral valve, the right atrium is sectioned on this plane. The mitral annulus is a potential substrate for atrial arrhythmia,22 accessory pathway,23 and ventricular arrhythmia.24 Approximately, the supero-lateral commissure is located at 12 o'clock and the infero-septal commissure is located at the 9 o'clock. Description is made from the upper left image to lower right image. For the first six images, the catheter is placed at the superior, supero-lateral, lateral, infero-lateral, inferior, infero-medial mitral annulus,

respectively. The superior mitral annulus corresponds to the endocardial side of the left ventricular summit. The last two images show mapping within the infero-septal recess, the space within the inferior left ventricular outflow tract surrounded by the membranous septum and crest of the ventricular septum medially, right fibrous trigone basally, and the aorticto-mitral (aortomitral) continuity and anterior mitral leaflet laterally. The infero-septal process, and the membranous septum is mapped. The latter position has a risk to create the infra-Hisian block by injuring the non-branching or branching portions of the atrioventricular conduction axis, or to injure the fascicles of the left bundle branch.

Figure 118 The mitral valve complex viewed from the right anterior oblique direction.1

From the ventricular septal direction, a nearly *en face* view of the opened anterior mitral leaflet is observed in front of the mitral valve orifice and the posterior mitral leaflet hidden behind the anterior mitral leaflet. The anterior mitral leaflet is related to the interleaflet triangle between the left and non-coronary aortic sinuses, connected by the aortic-to-mitral (aortomitral) continuity. From the endocardial side, no anatomical boundary can be detected between them. Lateral and medial sides of the anterior mitral leaflet are supported by the left and right fibrous trigones,4 respectively. The infero-septal process of the left ventricle, corresponding to the basal infero-medial left ventricular wall, ascends toward the right fibrous

trigone, also referred to as the central fibrous body. The septal isthmus anterior to the coronary sinus orifice is adjacent to the infero-septal process.3 However, the septal isthmus and the infero-septal process is intervened by the inferior pyramidal space, the epicardial fibro-adipose tissue carrying the atrioventricular nodal artery.2 The light source in the left atrium transilluminates the mitral leaflet (right).

Figure 119 The *en face* view of the atrioventricular junction.1

The *en face* view of the atrioventricular junction viewed from the ventricular side, corresponding the left antero-inferior view. The anterior mitral leaflet is located right antero-superior direction, and the posterior mitral leaflet is located in the left postero-inferior direction. Thus, the zone of coaptation is not located horizontally, but it extends supero-lateral to the infero-septal direction. Therefore, the alignment of the supero-lateral and infero-septal commissures shows the nearly parallel relationship to the alignment of supero-lateral and infero-medial papillary muscles.25 At this sectional level, both the right and left ventricular septal surfaces show fewer trabeculations compared to both the ventricular lateral free walls. The aortic root is located behind the crest of the ventricular septum and medial part of the supraventricular crest of the right ventricle.
