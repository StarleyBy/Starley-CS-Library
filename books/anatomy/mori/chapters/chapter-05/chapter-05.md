Figure 26 The internal aspect of the sinus venarum viewed from the right anterior oblique direction.1

The sinus venarum extends between the superior and inferior vena cava vertically. The crista terminalis is approximately 5 mm thick and 8 mm wide.2 It demarcates the lateral margin of the sinus venarum, separated from the right atrial appendage. It shows a characteristic arcuate-shape anterior to the orifice of the superior vena cava.3 This transverse part of the crista terminalis is referred to as the precaval bundle, or the arcuate ridge. The precaval bundle is then confluent with the Bachmann's bundle medially.2 The Bachmann's bundle traverse on the anterior wall of the left atrium,4 posterior to the

aortic root and the transverse sinus. From the endocardial side, no discrete boarder is discerned to define the medial extent of the sinus venarum. The smooth endocardial surface of the sinus venarum continues toward the posterior rim of the fossa ovalis. The posterior rim of the fossa ovalis is not the septum but the posterior interatrial fold/groove, also referred to as the secondary septum. The anterior orifice of the inferior vena cava is guarded by the Eustachian valve.

Figure 27 The external aspect of the sinus venarum visualized with transillumination.

The hearts are viewed from the right posterior (left) and right lateral (right) directions. The sinus venarum lacks pectinate muscle. It extends between the superior and inferior vena cava vertically. From the external side, the horizontal extent of the sinus venarum can be determined between the posterior interatrial fold/groove and terminal groove. Thus, the sinus venarum is a free wall. The superior and posterior interatrial fold is referred to as the Waterston's groove or Sondergaard's groove.5 This groove is one of the access routes to the left atrium during mitral valve surgery without entering into the right atrium. This posterior interatrial fold is not exactly a vertical structure, but generally tilts toward the right atrium. Therefore, the left atrium leans against the right atrium. Thus, the orifice of the inferior vena cava is

located medial relative to the orifice of the superior vena cava. The thickness of the wall of the sinus venarum is not uniform. The wedge-shaped thinning region is observed superior to the orifice of the inferior vena cava.6 The superior to middle part of the crista terminalis gives rise to multiple pectinate muscles running orthogonally toward the right atrial vestibule. Inferiorly, the crista terminalis ramifies into several pectinate muscles in a fan-like fashion. At the middle part of the sinus venarum, interatrial muscle bundle bridges the posterior interatrial fold. This epicardial bundle connects the sinus venarum with the anterior antrum of the right pulmonary veins.7

Figure 28 The internal aspect of the sinus venarum viewed from the left anterior oblique direction.

From this direction, the *en face* view of the sinus venarum extending between the crista terminalis and posterior interatrial fold is observed. Superior to the orifice of the inferior vena cava, the right posterior wall of the sinus venarum shows a wedge-shaped thinning where it is transilluminated. Laterally, the crista terminalis descends and ramifies into multiple fan-like pectinate muscles toward the infero-lateral to infero-medial right atrial vestibule. Therefore, the pectinate muscles run within the cavotricuspid isthmus in an oblique fashion. This alignment creates non-uniform feature of the isthmus,5 in terms of direction of pectinate muscles and wall thickness. The orifice of the inferior vena cava is located medial just next to the atrial septum. It is guarded by the Eustachian valve anteriorly. The atrial septum tilts toward the right atrium.

Figure 29 The ablation catheter placed on the middle part of the crista terminalis viewed from the left anterior oblique direction.

The catheter is placed on the middle part of the crista terminalis running vertically at the lateral margin of the sinus venarum. The crista terminalis, when viewed and mapped using this direction, is located medial relative to the lateral border of the cardiac silhouette, with the tip directing away from the observer. From the right atrial appendage, counterclockwise rotation torque of the catheter is necessary to reach the crista terminalis.8 Further torque enables one to trace the right posterior wall of the sinus venarum, when using transfemoral venous approach. When ablating the lateral to posterior sinus venarum, care for the phrenic nerve is necessary.9 The right phrenic nerve generally descends on the pericardium close to the crista terminalis and sinus venarum, anterior to the right pulmonary hilum.10
