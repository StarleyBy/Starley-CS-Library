Figure 14 The heart viewed from the left anterior oblique direction.1

The view corresponds roughly to the left anterior oblique 60-degree view. As the atrial and ventricular septa directs toward the left antero-inferior direction, the left anterior oblique direction is optimal angulation to separate the right heart from the left heart. The directional indicator shows the appropriate standard terminology to describe the direction related to the heart (cross bar). In addition, the use of directional terms as lateral and medial or septal (dotted circle) is appropriate for atria and apical/inlet components of the ventricles.2 This rule is not the case for the outlet component of the ventricles. As the right ventricular outflow tract crosses over the left ventricular outflow tract, the ventricular septum at this outflow component is not located vertically. Rather, it tilts toward the left posterior direction. Thus, during the procedure within the right ventricular outflow tract, the septum is located postero-inferior within the infundibulum (refer to Figure 11). Thus, left posterior direction relative to the right ventricular outflow tract should not be deemed as the septal direction, as it can be the medial free wall of the free-standing subpulmonary infundibulum. Even though this view is appropriate to obtain the *en face* view of the both atrioventricular valves, it is not appropriate to obtain the *en face* view of the left atrial posterior wall. The posterior wall of the left atrium is basically located parallel to the frontal plane with some anterior tilting at its roof. Therefore, to

separate the right and left pulmonary veins, the more appropriate direction is the anterior view rather than this left anterior oblique view. The apices of the right and left atrial appendages are adjacent to the ascending aorta and pulmonary root, respectively. They guard the entrance/exit to the transverse sinus located posterior to the both arterial trunks. The physiological tilting of the atrial septum is illustrated along with the tilting of the proximal aorta to the right anterior direction. Therefore, the bottom of the left atrium is located superior to that of the right atrium, and the left atrium looks as if it rides on the right atrium. Due to this tilting, the orifice of the inferior vena cava is located medially compared to the orifice of the superior vena cava. Deep left anterior oblique direction is optimal direction to see the *en face* view of the aortic arch to separate the ascending aorta from the descending aorta. Beneath the arch, the right pulmonary artery runs away from the observer toward the right pulmonary hilum, running posterior to the right superior pulmonary vein and anterior to the right main bronchus. On the other hand, beneath the arch, the left main bronchus comes toward the observer to reach to left pulmonary hilum, running posterior to the left superior pulmonary vein. As the left pulmonary artery overrides the left main bronchus, it is eventually located posterior to the left main bronchus. Refer to Figure 93.

Figure 15 Plane section of the heart at the level of the medial papillary muscle viewed from the left anterior oblique direction.1

In the right ventricle, the medial part of the antero-superior tricuspid leaflet is anchored by the medial papillary muscle. The medial papillary muscle arises from the inferior limb of the septomarginal trabeculation located at the basal superior part of the ventricular septum. The inferior papillary muscle anchors the septal and inferior tricuspid leaflets. The commissure between the antero-superior and inferior tricuspid leaflets is anchored by the anterior papillary muscle.3 The septal tricuspid leaflet attaches to the ventricular septum by its multiple small septal papillary muscles or the chordae tendineae originating from the ventricular septum. The supraventricular crest, corresponding to the ventriculo-infundibular fold or postero-lateral free wall of the infundibulum, separates the tricuspid valve from the pulmonary valve. The medial part of the supraventricular crest is located anterior to the right coronary aortic sinus. The superior part of the ventricular septum between the right and left ventricular outflow tract, corresponding to the location of the septomarginal trabeculation, tilts toward left posterior direction. Thus, superior to this basal supero-septum, medial side of the right ventricular outflow tract is not the septum,

but the thin medial free wall adjacent to the anterior interventricular groove, including the left anterior descending artery and anterior interventricular vein.4 In the left ventricle, multiple heads of the infero-medial and supero-lateral papillary muscles are observed. Each infero-medial and supero-lateral papillary muscle gives chordae tendineae to infero-medial and supero-lateral half of the mitral valves, respectively. The coaptation line of the anterior and posterior mitral leaflet is located nearly parallel to the alignment of both papillary muscles. The anterior and posterior mitral leaflets are also referred to as the aortic and mural leaflets of the mitral valve, respectively. This coaptation line is not horizontal as observed during transthoracic echocardiography; rather, it significantly tilts toward the vertical direction.5 Therefore, the anterior mitral leaflet is located medial and superior relative to the posterior mitral leaflet, which is located lateral and inferior. The apex of the left atrial appendage is a free-floating structure within the pericardial space covering the superior to supero-lateral basal left ventricle.6 It is independent of the epicardial adipose tissue of the left atrioventricular and anterior interventricular grooves.

Figure 16 Progressive dissection images of the heart viewed from the left anterior oblique direction: Midventricular level.

In the right ventricle, the moderator band arises from the septomarginal trabeculation as it traverses toward the free wall. The anterior papillary muscle arises from both the moderator band and free wall trabeculations. The anterior papillary muscle anchors the commissure between the antero-superior and inferior tricuspid leaflets. The medial papillary muscle anchors the medial part of the antero-superior tricuspid leaflet. The inferior papillary muscle anchors the commissure between the inferior and septal tricuspid leaflets. Adjacent to the anterior interventricular groove, thin medial free wall

of the right ventricular outflow tract is observed. In the left ventricle, the bodies of the infero-medial and supero-lateral papillary muscles are sectioned. The predominant supero-lateral papillary muscle is located laterally, anchoring the middle part of the mitral leaflets. Another discrete small supero-lateral papillary muscle is located superior, anchoring the supero-lateral commissure. The infero-septal commissure is anchored by the infero-medial papillary muscle.

Figure 17 Progressive dissection images of the heart viewed from the left anterior oblique direction: Basal ventricular level.

In the right ventricle, *en face* view of the tricuspid valve can be seen. The chordae tendineae of the medial papillary muscle located at the inferior limb of the septomarginal trabeculation anchor the medial part of the antero-superior tricuspid leaflet. The septomarginal trabeculation is observed as the localized bulging of the superior ventricular septum toward the right ventricle. The chordae tendineae of the anterior papillary muscle anchor the commissure between the antero-superior and inferior tricuspid leaflets. The supraventricular crest, corresponding to the postero-lateral free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract or ventriculo-infundibular fold, lies along the superior margin of the tricuspid valve annulus. Thus, it is located perpendicular to the septomarginal trabeculation. Its surface is smooth without trabeculations. The medial part of the supraventricular crest lies anterior to the right coronary aortic sinus. The supraventricular crest is

the part of inner curvature of the developing right heart. This separates the tricuspid valve from the pulmonary valve.2 The medial part of the right ventricular outflow tract is not the septum, but the free wall adjacent to the left anterior descending artery running in the anterior interventricular groove. The apex of the left atrial appendage is adjacent to the pulmonary root, covering the superior to supero-lateral part of the basal left ventricle. In the left heart, multiple heads of the infero-medial and supero-lateral papillary muscles gives rise to chordae tendineae to infero-medial and supero-lateral halves of the both anterior and posterior mitral leaflets. The mitral annular calcification is observed at the attachment of the middle scallop of the posterior mitral leaflet.

Figure 18 Progressive dissection images of the heart viewed from the left anterior oblique direction: Right atrioventricular junction level.

As the tricuspid valve is located apical to the mitral valve, the right atrium is sectioned in this plane that shows the mitral valve annulus and basal left ventricle. In the right ventricle, the supraventricular crest is sectioned tangentially to show the right coronary aortic sinus located behind its medial part. The interventricular portion of the membranous septum separates the right ventricular inflow tracts from the left ventricular outflow tract. The infundibulum superior to the right coronary aortic sinus lacks trabeculations. The pulmonary root is located left antero-superior to the aortic root. The left adjacent pulmonary sinus is located most postero-inferior among the three pulmonary sinuses.<sup>7</sup> In the left ventricle, anterior and posterior mitral leaflets along with its infero-septal and supero-lateral commissures are observed. The interleaflet triangle between the left and non-coronary aortic sinuses is located central relative to the anterior mitral leaflet. Both commissures of the mitral leaflets do not reach the annulus. The aortic-to-mitral (aortomitral) continuity is the region between this interleaflet triangle and the hingeline of the anterior mitral leaflet, approximately corresponding to the line connecting both commissures. At the bilateral end of the aortic-to-mitral continuity, the right and left fibrous

trigones support the anterior mitral leaflet. The right and left fibrous trigones extend toward the infero-septal and superolateral commissures, respectively. Transillumination (right) shows the three coronary aortic sinuses/leaflets. Although the right and left coronary aortic sinuses are separated, this view is not appropriate to separate the non-coronary aortic sinus from the left and right coronary aortic sinuses.8 The non-coronary aortic sinus is located most postero-inferior. Bulging of the non-coronary aortic sinus toward the right atrium is also transilluminated, which is referred to as the right aortic mound (torus aorticus).9 The right aortic mound is, therefore, not the atrial septum, and it is located superior to the triangle of Koch. The basal superior part of the left ventricle supports the anterior half of the left coronary aortic sinus. The epicardial side is referred to as the left ventricular summit.1,10 It is located superior to the supero-lateral commissure of the mitral valve. The left anterior descending artery and anterior interventricular vein is located within the epicardial adipose tissue on the left ventricular summit, covered by the left atrial appendage and pulmonary root.

Figure 19 Progressive dissection images of the heart viewed from the left anterior oblique direction: Coronary sinus orifice level.

In the right atrium, the inferior end of the crista terminalis ramifies the pectinate muscles in fan-like fashion toward the Eustachian valve and right atrial vestibules. Due to the coronary sinus courses along the left atrioventricular groove inferior to the left atrium, the bottom of the left atrial vestibule is located superior relative to the bottom of the right atrial vestibule. The aortic root is located on the antero-superior interatrial groove. Thus, the non-coronary aortic sinus wedges between the both right and left atrial supero-medial free wall. The antero-inferior muscular buttress, also referred to as the anterior limbus of the fossa ovalis, is observed between the non-coronary aortic sinus and coronary sinus. This buttress is the true muscular atrial septum,9 anchoring the primary septum at the floor of the fossa ovalis with the central fibrous body. The right and left coronary aortic sinuses are adjacent to the right and left adjacent pulmonary sinuses, respectively. The left anterior

descending artery is located adjacent to the left pulmonary aortic sinus overriding the aortic root. The Thebesian valve is located orthogonal to the Eustachian valve, guarding the orifice of the coronary sinus.11 Transillumination (right) of the left atrial posterior wall enhances the existence of the warfarin ridge that is not transilluminated. This warfarin ridge, also referred to as the Coumadin ridge or left atrial ridge, is found between the left atrial appendage and the left pulmonary veins. The fold creating this ridge contains the vein of Marshall arising between the coronary sinus and the great cardiac vein. Transillumination reveals the paper-thin wall of the right atrial appendage between the pectinate muscles. Transillumination also reveals the thin posterior wall of the inferior sinus venarum (smooth) portion of the right atrium located superior to the orifice of the inferior vena cava.

Figure 20 Progressive dissection images of the heart viewed from the left anterior oblique direction: Opening the coronary sinus and great cardiac vein.

The hole created by transseptal puncture is observed at the superior part of the primary septum at the floor of the fossa ovalis. When the coronary sinus and great cardiac vein are open, the Vieussens' valve is observed at infero-lateral part of the left atrioventricular junction,<sup>12</sup> which demarcates the anatomical margin between the coronary sinus and the great cardiac vein. The orifice of the oblique vein (vein of Marshall) is located at the bottom of this valve.<sup>13</sup> As the coronary venous flow drains to the right atrium, the free margin of the valve is located at the coronary sinus side. Distal to the valve

is the great cardiac vein. At the superior part of the left atrioventricular junction, inferior to the left atrial appendage, the vein runs inferior to the proximal circumflex artery, then overrides it from the atrial side. Then it becomes the anterior interventricular vein running toward the left ventricular summit along with the left anterior descending artery. Transillumination (right) shows the thin and smooth posterior wall of the inferior sinus venarum continuing to the orifice of the inferior vena cava.14

Figure 21 Left anterior oblique view of the heart with epicardial adipose tissue.

The right ventricular outflow tract crosses over the left ventricular outflow tract from the right antero-inferior direction to the left postero-superior direction. Rich epicardial adipose tissue is distributed along the coronary vessels, including the atrioventricular groove, anterior interventricular groove, and acute and obtuse margins. Localized regions in the right ventricular anterior free wall, left ventricular apical anterior wall, left ventricular basal-mid supero-lateral wall, and left ventricular basal-lateral wall lack the epicardial adipose tissue. The right and left atrial appendages are generally not covered by thick epicardial adipose tissue. Although the apex of the left atrial appendage is closely related to the basal superior left ventricle, it is independent of the adipose tissue of the left atrioventricular and anterior interventricular grooves, freely floating in the pericardial space.
