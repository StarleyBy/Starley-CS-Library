Figure 151 The coronary sinus.1

The heart is viewed from the inferior direction. The coronary sinus and its tributaries are opened. The coronary sinus runs to the atrial side relative to the distal right coronary artery running along the right and left atrioventricular junction. The

Vieussens' valve is located at infero-lateral portion,2 which is used to define the anatomical border between the coronary sinus and the great cardiac vein.

Figure 152 The great cardiac vein and anterior interventricular vein.1

The great cardiac vein runs along the left circumflex artery covered by the left atrial appendage. The relationship between the coronary veins and coronary arteries,3 coronary veins and mitral annulus,4 coronary veins and the phrenic nerve on the pericardium,5 and branching pattern of the coronary veinous tributaries,6,7 are highly variable. In the left image, the anterior interventricular vein runs along the left anterior descending artery on its lateral side. The great cardiac vein is located apical

to the left circumflex artery. The anterior interventricular vein-great cardiac vein junction crosses over the proximal obtuse marginal artery. In the right image, the thick septal branch of the anterior interventricular vein overrides the left anterior descending artery. The anterior interventricular vein-great cardiac vein junction is located beneath the high-lateral branch. In both hearts, multiple small veins are detected on the left ventricular summit (yellow, fan-shape areas).

Figure 153 The illustration showing the variable course of the coronary veins.1

Distal anastomosis is common among coronary venous tributaries. The communicating vein is illustrated as the vein running between the pulmonary and aortic roots (image on the left page).8 Several other veins on the left ventricular summit and septal veins9,10 are also illustrated (images on the right page), which can be the potential route for ethanol ablation for the ventricular arrhythmias originating from the left ventricular summit11 or intraventricular septum.12,13 Several Thebesian

veins14 are also common that directly drain back to the right atrium from the medial or lateral free wall of the right atrial appendage, as illustrated as the retro-aortic communicating vein, conus vein, right ventricular vein, and acute marginal vein (image on the left page). The topographic relationship between the coronary veins and the coronary artery is also variable (images on the right page). The angulation of the junction of the anterior interventricular vein-great cardiac vein and its distance from the aortic root are also variable.11

Figure 154 The Thebesian veins draining into the lateral right appendage.1

The heart is viewed from the right anterior oblique direction. The coronary venous tributaries draining the region of the infundibulum (conus vein) and acute margin (acute marginal vein) return directly to the lateral right atrial appendage after crossing over the right coronary artery. These Thebesian veins, the coronary veins directly returning to the right atrium

without joining into the coronary sinus, are normal anatomical findings. However, in the setting of coronary sinus stenosis/ atresia, prominent Thebesian veins can be found as the alternative route for venous drainage.15 Conversely, incidental observation of a prominent or unusual Thebesian vein suggests the coronary sinus stenosis/atresia.

Figure 155 The Vieussens' valve.

The heart is sectioned along the left atrioventricular groove. The coronary sinus and the great cardiac vein are opened and viewed from the left anterior oblique direction. At the infero-lateral segment, the Vieussens' valve is observed (left), demarcating the margin between the coronary sinus and the great cardiac vein.2 At the inferior orifice of the coronary sinus, the Thebesian valve is also observed.16 When the Vieussens' valve is removed (right), the orifice of the oblique vein of the left

atrium, also referred to as the vein of Marshall,17 appears at the nadir of the attachment of the Vieussens' valve. The warfarin (Coumadin) ridge is observed between the left pulmonary veins and the orifice of the left arial appendage.18 Epicardial side of the warfarin ridge, the fold between the left pulmonary veins and left atrial appendage, is the route for the vein of Marshall or persistent left superior vena cava draining into the coronary sinus.
