Figure 133 The structural relationship surrounding the aortic root.1

The heart is viewed from the superior direction. The aortic root wedges into the superior crux of the heart between the bilateral atrioventricular junctions. The aortic root directs toward the right antero-superior direction, whereas the pulmonary root directs toward the postero-superior direction. The pulmonary root is located left antero-superior to the aortic root. The right atrial appendage is located right anterior to the aortic root, covering the right atrioventricular groove involving the right coronary artery. The superior vena cava is located right posterior to the aortic root.2 The left atrium is located posterior to the aortic root. The right coronary aortic leaflet is located anterior, whereas the left and non-coronary aortic leaflets are located left posterior and right posterior, respectively. The postero-lateral free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract (infundibulum) is located anterior to the right coronary aortic sinus. The apex of the interleaflet triangle between the right and left coronary aortic sinuses is adjacent to the apex of the interleaflet triangle between the right and left adjacent pulmonary sinuses. The myocardium supporting the anterior half of the left coronary

aortic sinus is the basal superior left ventricular free wall, the epicardial side of which is referred to as the left ventricular summit,1,3 carrying the proximal left coronary artery on it. The posterior half of the non-coronary aortic sinus and posterior half of the left coronary aortic sinus are adjacent to the left atrium, and the anterior half of the non-coronary aortic sinus is adjacent to the right atrium. The interleaflet triangles between the right coronary and non-coronary aortic sinuses, non-coronary and left coronary aortic sinuses, and left and right coronary aortic sinuses face to the right-side transverse sinus medial to the right atrial appendage, the transverse sinus, and the fibrous tissue plane between the aortic and pulmonary root, respectively. Thus, all of the interleaflet triangle is facing toward the extracardiac plane.4 Against the central axis of the aortic root, the orifices of the both coronary arteries are not located opposite each other, but they are located approximately 150 degrees apart on average.5

Figure 134 The *en face* view of the aortic valvular orifice and non-coronary aortic sinus/leaflet.1

The heart is viewed from the right antero-superior direction (left). The pulmonary valve is not on the same plane with the aortic valve. Its orifice tilts posterior relative to the orifice of the aortic valve. The right image is the *en face* endocardial view of the non-coronary aortic leaflet. The commissures are located at the level of the sinutubular junction plane. On the

![](_page_4_Picture_0.jpeg)

contrary, the central zone of coaptation is lower than the plane of the sinutubular junction,6 approximately at half of its height.7 Each leaflet has semilunar attachment to the aortic root, creating the interleaflet triangle between each sinus.8 The nodule of Arantius is found at the central zone of coaptation.

Figure 135 The posterior view of the aortic root.1

The interleaflet triangle between the non-coronary and left coronary aortic sinuses is in continuity with the anterior mitral leaflet, divided by the attachment of the left atrial anterior wall. This triangle faces to the transverse sinus. The posterior free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract (infundibulum) starts to separate from the left ventricle anterior to the left coronary aortic sinus (left). Then, the pulmonary root/trunk overrides the left coronary aortic sinus and the proximal left

coronary artery. The left ventricular free wall myocardium supports the anterior half of the left coronary aortic sinus.4 The epicardial side of this region corresponds to the left ventricular summit.1,9 The pulmonary valve is not on the same plane with the aortic valve (right). The pulmonary root is located left antero-superior to the aortic root and tilts posterior relative to the aortic root.

Figure 136 Progressive dissection of the ventricular mass.1

The dissection shows the ventricular mass with the semilunar hingelines and interleaflet triangles (left). The aortic root is located central to the ventricular mass. In the right image, the aortic root, the mitral valve, and the membranous septum in the left image are removed to show the left ventricular ostium.1,10 The left ventricular ostium is the anatomical concept involving the basal left ventricular myocardium1 that surrounds inflow and outflow of the left ventricular cone. This dissection is feasible as there is no ventricular myocardium intervening between the mitral orifice and the left ventricular outflow tract. In contrast, in the right ventricle, the inflow and outflow tracts are separated by the infundibulum. The

yellow beads denote the left ventricular free wall supporting the left coronary aortic sinus. The red beads show the crest of the ventricular septum supporting the right coronary aortic sinus, which is extensive (14 mm) than the yellow beads (4 mm). The crest of the ventricular septum also supports the base of the membranous septum. Refer to Figure 85. White beads indicated the left fibrous trigone. The green beads are the septal attachment of the septal tricuspid leaflet. The blue beads are the location of the atrioventricular node. The membranous septum is located between the blue and red beads.1

Figure 137 The pair of the parasternal left ventricular long-axis sections.1

The left image corresponds to the parasternal long-axis section, and the right image is the paired section. The membranous septum and fossa ovalis in the left image, and the left atrial appendage in the right image are transilluminated. The aortic valve is bisected between the center of the right coronary aortic sinus and interleaflet triangle between the non-coronary and left coronary aortic sinuses.11 This is the section that can bisect the anterior and posterior mitral leaflets. The crest of the ventricular septum supports the anterior base of the right coronary aortic sinus. This part corresponds to the

postero-lateral attachment of the right ventricle, identical to the ventriculo-arterial junction at the right coronary aortic sinus. The ventriculo-arterial junction is the inferior limit of the postero-lateral free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract (infundibulum) located anterior to the right coronary aortic sinus. The membranous septum extends at the base of the right and non-coronary aortic sinuses. The relationship with the virtual basal ring and the membranous septum shows the individual variation.12 Refer to Figures 101 and 102.

Figure 138 The pair of the frontal section cut at the level of the left coronary artery orifice.1

The left and right images are viewed from the posterior and anterior directions, respectively. The right coronary aortic sinus is supported by the crest of the ventricular septum. Refer to Figure 136. The left ventricular free wall supports the anterior half of the left coronary aortic sinus. The left ventricular summit is the epicardial region of this left ventricular free wall. The myocardial thickness supporting the left coronary aortic sinus is thin,5 indicating the distance between the virtual basal ring and the ventriculo-arterial junction at this region is short. This distance corresponds to the thickness of the myocardial crescent incorporated at the base of the left coronary aortic sinus.5 The average value of the thickness of the myocardial crescent is 6.4 mm at the right coronary aortic sinus supported by the crest of the ventricular septum,

whereas it is 2.9 mm at the left coronary aortic sinus supported by the free wall.5 The left main trunk of the left coronary artery is located within the epicardial adipose tissue on the left ventricular summit. The pulmonary root/trunk overrides the left coronary aortic sinus and the left main trunk. The interleaflet triangle between the left and non-coronary aortic sinuses are in continuity with the anterior mitral leaflet. The thick fibrous tissue supporting the nadir of the non-coronary aortic sinus, between the right atrium and the left ventricular outflow tract is the part of the central fibrous body, also referred to as the right fibrous trigone.1,13 The compact atrioventricular node is located on the right atrial side of this fibrous tissue.

Figure 139 The left ventricular cone and three-pointed coronet of the aortic root.1

As the interleaflet fibrous triangle within the aortic root is a part of the left ventricular outflow tract hemodynamically, this is the shape of the hemodynamic left ventricle. The infero-septal process directs to the right fibrous trigone (central fibrous body) at the nadir of the non-coronary aortic sinus. The left ventricular free wall located at the left ventricular summit supports the nadir of the left coronary aortic sinus.4 McAlpine terms this part of the free wall as the left ostial process1 in relation with the extent of the left fibrous trigone at the nadir of the left coronary aortic sinus. The interleaflet triangle between the non-coronary and left coronary aortic sinuses is in continuity with the anterior mitral leaflet. The aortic-to-mitral (aortomitral) continuity extends approximately between the level of the virtual basal ring to the hingeline of the anterior mitral leaflet between the supero-lateral and infero-septal commissures. The aortic-to-mitral continuity is hardly distinguishable from the anterior mitral leaflet,14 as there is no specific boundary. The attachment of the left atrial anterior wall divides the interleaflet triangle from the aortic-to-mitral continuity.
