Figure 7 The heart viewed from the right anterior oblique direction.1

The directional indicator shows the appropriate standard terminology to describe the direction related to the heart. The right anterior oblique direction is optimal angulation to separate the atria from the ventricles, or to obtain an *en face* view of the atrial and ventricular septa. The atrioventricular groove intervenes between the atrium and ventricle. During fluoroscopic procedure, the atrioventricular groove can be appreciated as the radiolucent band.2 Although the right and non-coronary aortic sinuses are separated, this view cannot separate the left coronary aortic sinus from the right and non-coronary aortic sinuses.3 The bottom of the left heart is located superior to the bottom of the right heart. In contrast to the vertically aligned superior vena cava, the orifice of the inferior vena cava is located posterior relative to the orifice of the superior vena cava, and its axis directs toward the apex of the right atrial appendage. In this right anterior oblique image, corresponding roughly to the right anterior oblique 30-degree view, the right-hand border of the cardiac contour is not composed of the right ventricle. The mid-apical superior and supero-lateral wall of the left ventricle composes this part of the contour.3 Thus, the right-hand part of the cardiac silhouette relative to the left anterior descending artery is the region of the left ventricle, where is perfused by the diagonal branches. The left-hand part of the cardiac silhouette relative to the

left anterior descending artery is the right ventricle. This knowledge is important to avoid inadvertent damage of the right ventricular anterior free wall during the procedure targeting the right side of the ventricular septum, including ablation, pacing, and biopsy. Relative to the basal superior left ventricle, the pulmonary valve is lifted up by the encircling free-standing subpulmonary infundibulum. Thus, at the level just beneath the pulmonary valve, even facing direction away to the observer is not the septum, but a medial and posterior free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract. The yellow regions roughly demarcate the safe region that is true atrial and ventricular septa.2 The right atrioventricular junction is shifted apical to the left atrioventricular junction, rendering the basal medial part of the left ventricular myocardium being adjacent to the floor of the triangle of Koch, intervened by the inferior pyramidal space.4 The right coronary aortic sinus is located antero-superior relative to the non-coronary aortic sinus, which is located most postero-inferior. The pulmonary valve is located most superior among the all-cardiac valves.5 The right superior pulmonary vein is located posterior to the superior vena cava just superior of its junction with the right atrium.

Figure 8 Progressive dissection images of the heart viewed from the right anterior oblique direction: Outer aspect of the right heart.

In this right anterior oblique image, corresponding to 45-degree to 50-degree views, shows an *en face* view of the right heart. In contrast to the vertical axis of the superior vena cava, the axis of the inferior vena cava tilts toward the apex of the right atrial appendage. The apex of the right atrial appendage covers the right side of the ascending aorta and superior part of the right atrioventricular groove, involving the proximal right coronary artery. Transillumination (right) clarifies

the location of the crista terminalis that demarcates posterior margin of the right atrial appendage. The crista terminalis gives rise to multiple pectinate muscles traversing the free wall of the right atrial appendage directing toward the right atrial vestibule, the encircling smooth right atrial wall continuing to the attachment of the tricuspid valve.

Figure 9 Progressive dissection images of the heart viewed from the right anterior oblique direction: Removal of the right heart free wall.

Right atrial and ventricular free wall are removed except the right atrioventricular groove. These images show the medial aspect of the right atrium as well as trabeculations of the right ventricle. The anterior papillary muscle anchors the commissure between the antero-superior and inferior tricuspid leaflets. The medial part of the antero-superior leaflet is anchored by the medial papillary muscle located anterior to the right coronary aortic sinus. Transillumination (right) enhances the primary septum at the floor of the fossa ovalis, ascending aorta, aortic root, and membranous septum. The supero-medial aspect of the right atrial appendage, corresponding to the right aortic mound (torus aorticus), is also transilluminated through the aortic root. This indicates that this part of the right atrium is not the atrial septum, but

![](_page_6_Picture_0.jpeg)

the medial free wall of the right atrium facing to the aortic root, and specifically, the anterior half of the non-coronary aortic sinus. The ring-like negative transillumination surrounding the fossa ovalis corresponds to the secondary septum or interatrial fold/groove, except the anterior limbus of the fossa ovalis. The secondary septum is not the true septum, but the interatrial fold/groove, surrounding the fossa ovalis antero-superior, superior, posterior, and inferior. The anterior limbus corresponds to the antero-inferior muscular buttress, that connects to the central fibrous body at the bottom of the non-coronary aortic sinus. Only the primary septum at the floor of the fossa ovalis and the antero-inferior muscular buttress are the true anatomical atrial septum.6

Figure 10 Progressive dissection images of the heart viewed from the right anterior oblique direction: Focus on the medial structures of the right heart.

Further progressive dissection was performed by removing the lateral right atrioventricular groove, apex of the right atrial appendage, postero-lateral free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract (infundibulum), and anterior papillary muscle of the right ventricle. The membranous septum is located at the commissure between the antero-superior and septal tricuspid leaflets. The septal tricuspid leaflet is mainly anchored by multiple small septal papillary muscles or the chordae tendineae directly arising from the ventricular septum. The chordae tendineae from the inferior papillary muscle also anchor the septal leaflet. The sectional plane of the moderator band is observed. Transillumination (right) shows the relationship between the non-coronary aortic sinus (seen through the right atrium), right coronary aortic sinus (seen through the right atrioventricular groove and supraventricular crest), and the membranous septum. The non-coronary aortic sinus and right posterior part of the ascending aorta is adjacent to the supero-medial wall of the right atrial appendage with the intervening right-side transverse sinus. The right coronary aortic sinus is adjacent to the postero-

lateral free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract, also referred to as the ventriculo-infundibular fold. The endocardial side of this region corresponds to the supraventricular crest covering the right coronary aortic sinus with its medial part.7 The base of the right coronary aortic sinus is supported by the crest of the ventricular septum, corresponding to the septal part of the left ventricular ostium,1 which is not transilluminated.8 The medial papillary muscle is located at the base of the septomarginal trabeculation, anterior to the right coronary aortic sinus. The morphology of the septomarginal trabeculation varies among hearts, and it is not prominent in this particular heart. The medial papillary muscle is also referred to as the muscle of Lancisi, muscle of Luschka, and papillary muscle of the conus.9 The medial papillary muscle commonly anchors the medial part of the antero-superior tricuspid leaflet with its prominent chordae tendinea.10 The proximal right bundle branch runs close to the base of this medial papillary muscle before coursing within the septomarginal trabeculation and moderator band.11

Figure 11 Progressive dissection images of the heart viewed from the right anterior oblique direction: Removal of the ventricular septum.

The substantial part of the muscular ventricular septum is removed to show the left ventricle. The basal superior part of the section is made along the inferior margin of the membranous septum, where is the location of the atrioventricular conduction axis and proximal right bundle branch. The substantial part of the ventricular septum is observed in *en face* fashion from this direction. However, the ventricular septum located anterior to the right coronary aortic sinus lies superior relative to the left ventricular outflow tract as the right ventricular outflow tract overrides the left ventricular outflow tract. Therefore, *en face* view of the ventricular septum at this region cannot be obtained from this right anterior oblique direction. It is the right anterior oblique and cranial view that can show the *en face* view of this part of the ventricular septum. Therefore, so-called antero-septal region of the right ventricular outflow tract (infundibulum) facing the observer, is actually not the septum, defined as a structure that separates two chambers, but it is the medial free wall of the infundibulum. The ventricular surface of the anterior mitral leaflet is observed from this direction. Both the inferomedial and supero-lateral papillary muscles are also observed, indicating that they are related to the left ventricular free

wall,5 aligned in a vertical fashion rather than horizontal fashion. The basal infero-medial left ventricular wall located anterior to the coronary sinus extends toward the central fibrous body at the base of the non-coronary aortic sinus. This basal infero-medial left ventricular muscle ascending toward the central fibrous body is referred to as the infero-septal process.12 As this infero-septal process is adjacent to the septal isthmus, left ventricular arrhythmia originating from the epicardial side of this infero-septal process can be ablated from the septal isthmus.13 Successful traversal of this region from the right atrium to the left ventricle has been reported.14 However, it is important to appreciate that this region is the atrioventricular sandwich. The inferior pyramidal space, the wedging epicardial fibro-adipose tissue carrying the atrioventricular nodal artery, intervenes between the right atrium and the left ventricle.15 The membranous septum is divided by the septal attachment of the septal tricuspid leaflet unequally into the atrioventricular and interventricular portions with various proportions of each portion.16 Refer to Figure 67.

Figure 12 The left ventricle viewed from the right anterior oblique direction.1

In this section, the basal infero-medial left ventricle shows a peculiar shape. This is the region referred to as the infero-septal process.12 It is in continuity with the right fibrous trigone, also referred to as the central fibrous body,1,17 at the base of the non-coronary aortic sinus. The infero-medial and supero-lateral papillary muscles belong to the left ventricular free wall.18 The interleaflet triangle between the right and left coronary aortic sinuses is supported by the basal left ventricular free

wall.7 This interleaflet triangle is close to the posterior attachment of the right ventricle, where the free-standing subpulmonary infundibulum separates from the left ventricle to lift up the pulmonary valve. Refer to Figure 81. The epicardial surface of this basal superior left ventricular free wall is referred to as the left ventricular summit.1,19 The interleaflet tringle between the left and non-coronary aortic sinuses is in continuity with the anterior mitral leaflet. Refer to Figure 120.

Figure 13 Right anterior oblique view of the heart with epicardial adipose tissue.

The right atrial appendage is generally not covered with thick epicardial adipose tissue. Rich epicardial adipose tissue is distributed along the atrioventricular groove, anterior interventricular groove, and acute margin. Localized region in the right ventricular anterior free wall lacks epicardial adipose tissue.
