Figure 92 The pulmonary veins viewed from the posterior direction.1

The pulmonary venous component lies superior relative to the posterior wall of the left atrium, creating the dome or roof of the left atrium.2 The left atrial dome/roof, posterior wall, and inferior pulmonary veins in the left image are removed in the right image. The pulmonary bifurcation lies on the left atrial dome/roof above the orifice of the left superior pulmonary vein. The pulmonary venous component tilts anterior. Thus, compared to the orifices of the superior pulmonary veins, the orifices of the inferior pulmonary veins are located posterior, which is commonly prominent feature in the right pulmonary veins. Therefore, the inferior half of the pulmonary venous component and the posterior wall of the left atrium are commonly closer to the structures at the posterior mediastinum, including the esophagus, descending aorta, and the vertebral column.3 The anterior antrum of the right pulmonary veins is adjacent to the posterior interatrial groove, also referred to as the Waterston's groove or Sondergaard's groove.4 On the other hand, the anterior antrum of the left pulmonary veins is

adjacent to the fold created between the left atrial appendage and the left pulmonary veins, corresponding to the left atrial ridge or warfarin (Coumadin) ridge.5 The mitral orifice, when compared to the plane involving four pulmonary veins, is located left antero-inferior. The orifice tilts left antero-inferior to face the cardiac apex. Because of this tilting, the distance between the pulmonary veins and the mitral annulus is significantly shorter at the left (lateral) side than the right (septal) side. Furthermore, the orifice of the left atrial appendage is located closer the orifice of the left superior pulmonary vein than the orifice of the left inferior pulmonary vein. Reflecting these anatomical relationships, the mitral isthmus, or the left atrial isthmus, is the narrowest between the left inferior pulmonary vein and the lateral mitral annulus.6 The azygos vein is located superior to the right pulmonary artery. Refer to Figure 89.

Figure 93 Structural extracardiac anatomy around the pulmonary vein.1

The heart is viewed from the posterior direction (left). The direction of the orifice of the inferior vena cava is not vertical; rather, it has a postero-inferior direction. The aortic arch and the left pulmonary artery override the left main bronchus. Thus, the left main bronchus is described as the hyparterial long bronchus. In contrast, the right pulmonary artery does not override the right main bronchus; it is only the azygos vein that overrides the right main bronchus. Thus, the right main bronchus is referred to as the eparterial short bronchus.7 Reflecting this difference, the initial part of the left pulmonary artery directs left postero-superior compared to the horizontal course of the right pulmonary artery directing toward the right. Due to this bilateral non-uniformity, the left superior pulmonary vein is located just anterior to the left

main bronchus. In contrast, the right pulmonary artery intervenes between the right superior pulmonary vein and the right intermediate bronchus. The tracheal carina is located superior relative to the pulmonary venous component of the left atrium. The proximity of the descending aorta to the left inferior pulmonary vein, posterior wall of the left atrium, coronary sinus, and basal infero-lateral left ventricle is noted.8 The orifices of the right intercostal arteries at the descending aorta are also adjacent to the pulmonary venous component and posterior wall of the left atrium. The right image is the heart viewed from the left postero-superior direction.

Figure 94 Structural anatomy around the pulmonary vein.1

Posterior to the superior vena cava, the right superior pulmonary vein is located followed by the right pulmonary artery and the right intermediate bronchus. The left main bronchus is located under the aortic arch and the left pulmonary artery, as they override the left main bronchus. The left main bronchus lies just posterior to the orifice of the left superior pulmonary vein. This structural anatomy explains why thermal bronchial injury is common at the left superior pulmonary venous

isolation compared to the right superior pulmonary venous isolation.9 The pericardial reflection at the apex of the oblique sinus is shown inferior to the tracheal carina and right pulmonary artery. Thus, the bilateral pulmonary arteries are extra-pericardial structures, above the oblique sinus.10 The extracardiac space between the tracheal carina and pulmonary bifurcation is the location of the deep cardiac plexus of the autonomic nerves innervating to the heart. Refer to Figure 168.

Figure 95 The pulmonary veins viewed from the postero-superior direction.1

The trachea and bronchi in the left image are removed in the right image. In the setting of normal arrangement, the left pulmonary artery overrides the left main bronchus whereas the right pulmonary artery does not override the right main bronchus.11 Thus, the right pulmonary artery is located anterior to the right bronchus. The tracheal carina is commonly located superior to the left atrial roof. The pulmonary bifurcation and the right pulmonary artery lie on the left atrial roof.

Reflecting this anatomy, the left bronchus is located posterior to the orifice of the left superior pulmonary vein, whereas the right pulmonary artery is located posterior to the orifice of the right superior pulmonary vein. The esophagus descends posterior to the trachea. The pericardial reflection at the apex of the oblique sinus is observed at left atrial dome/roof, inferior to the tracheal carina and right pulmonary artery.

The images are viewed from the left anterior oblique direction. The catheter is placed at the posterior antrum of the left superior pulmonary vein (left) and anterior antrum (right) posterior to the warfarin (Coumadin) ridge between the left pulmonary vein and left atrial appendage.

Figure 97 The inner aspects of the orifices of the right and left pulmonary veins.

The images are viewed from the left anterior oblique direction (left) and right lateral direction (right). Between the left pulmonary veins and left atrial appendage, the fold creates the left atrial ridge, also referred to as the warfarin (Coumadin) ridge.11 Within this fold, the vein/ligament of Marshall, patent left superior vena cava, and sinuatrial nodal artery originating from the left circumflex artery with posterior course12 run through. Anterior antrum of the right pulmonary veins is in

continuity with the posterior interatrial fold, corresponding to the Waterston's groove, or Sondergaard's groove.8 Due to this close proximity, the epicardial interatrial muscle bundle bridging the posterior interatrial fold can connect the sinus venarum with the anterior antrum of the right pulmonary veins.13 The orifice of the left atrial appendage is closer to the orifice of the left superior pulmonary vein than that of the left inferior pulmonary vein.

Figure 98 The posterior view of the heart.1

The pulmonary venous component, the area surrounded by the four pulmonary veins, is located superior within the entire left atrium.2 Therefore, this pulmonary venous component corresponds to the dome or the roof of the left atrium, relative to the true posterior wall of the left atrium extending inferior. The left atrial dome/roof is located inferior to the aortic arch and pulmonary arteries. The orifices of the inferior pulmonary veins are located infero-posterior relative to the orifices of the superior pulmonary veins. This is because the left atrial dome/roof tilt anterior. As the pulmonary trunk is located left to the ascending aorta, it is the right pulmonary artery that runs through the space beneath the aortic arch on the dome/roof of the left atrium. The V-shaped dimple (arrowhead) occasionally found at the left atrial roof between the bilateral superior pulmonary veins14 corresponds to the location where the right pulmonary artery sits. The phrenic nerves descend anterior to the pulmonary hila.15 Thus, in addition to the crista terminalis and postero-lateral sinus venarum, the anterior regions of the right pulmonary veins are close to the right phrenic nerve.16 Ablation to the right pulmonary veins can induce transient or persistent right phrenic nerve injury.17
