Figure 166 The stellate ganglia. Anaglyphs 22 and 23.

The right (left) and left (right) stellate ganglia are dissected focusing on their superior halves, referred to as the inferior cervical ganglion. In the left image, the pleura and subclavian artery are removed to show the inferior half of the stellate ganglion, corresponding to the Th1 ganglion, and the continuing thoracic sympathetic trunk. The subclavian ansa, also referred to as the Vieussens' ansa/loop,1 as well as vertebral ganglion can be observed. In the right image, the pleura and subclavian artery is preserved. The pleura is transilluminated by the light source placed within the pleural cavity. The

stellate ganglion is located on the apex of the pleura outside the pleural cavity. The superior half of the stellate ganglion, the inferior cervical ganglion, is located in front of the first rib close to its costotransverse joint. The inferior cervical ganglion gives rise to many branches like a star,2 combined with the middle cervical and vertebral ganglia. Those branches include the subclavian ansa,1 multiple middle and inferior cardiac nerves,3 gray rami to the brachial plexus,4 and vertebral nerves.5 The size and shape of the stellate ganglion are variable.6

Figure 167 The anterior view of cardiac innervation.

Bilateral vagus nerves, sympathetic trunks, and phrenic nerves are isolated with the heart, esophagus, trachea, bronchi, thyroid/cricoid cartilages, and thyroid gland. The part of the trachea is removed to show the esophagus behind. The pericardium is kept intact.7

Figure 168 The posterior view of cardiac sympathetic innervation.

Bilateral vagus nerves, stellate ganglia, and phrenic nerves are isolated with the heart. The esophagus, trachea, bronchi, thyroid/cricoid cartilages, and thyroid gland in the Figure 167 are removed. The deep cardiac plexus behind the aortic arch and pulmonary bifurcation is shown. The pericardium is kept intact.7
