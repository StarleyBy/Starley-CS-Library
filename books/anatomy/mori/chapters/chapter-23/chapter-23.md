Figure 156 The posterior hilum of the heart.1

The heart is viewed from the postero-superior direction. The bar passes through the transverse sinus. The posterior hilum of the heart, mainly located at the pulmonary venous component of the left atrium (left atrial dome/roof), is the venous pole of the heart. It is surrounded by the pericardial reflection around the pulmonary veins and both superior and inferior vena cavae. Compared to the superior hilum, which is the arterial pole of the heart around the arterial trunks, the posterior

hilum has more complicated shape due to the multiple recesses and oblique sinus.2 The posterior hilum is directly adjacent to the mediastinal space. Both hila of the heart work as the entrances/exits for the extracardiac nerves and vessels. Refer to Figure 163.

Figure 157 The illustration showing the pericardial reflections and hilum of the heart.1

The heart is viewed from the anterior (left) and posterior (right) directions. The superior and posterior hila (areas surrounded by thick lines in the left image) involve arterial and venous poles, respectively. The shape of the posterior hilum is complicated and variable due to the recesses, deep oblique sinus, and vestigial fold.3 The posterior hilum is close to the

pulmonary bifurcation, right pulmonary artery, tracheal carina, and bronchus. The entrance of the oblique sinus opens in oblique fashion between the inferior vena cava and the left inferior pulmonary vein. The transverse sinus is located between the superior hilum and posterior hilum of the heart.

Figure 158 The left lateral view showing the transverse sinus and vestigial fold.1

The heart is viewed from the left lateral direction. The vestigial fold is sandwiched by the anteriorly located transverse sinus and the posteriorly located left pulmonic recess. In contrast to the transverse sinus, the left pulmonic recess and the left pulmonary venous recess are the blind-end.

Figure 159 The frontal section showing the structural anatomy anterior to the transverse sinus.1

The heart is viewed from the anterior direction. The arrow in the right image indicates the transverse sinus. The transverse sinus is located posterior to the arterial trunks. The lateral entrances are guarded by bilateral atrial appendages. The transverse sinus has deep superior and inferior extension right posterior to the aortic root. They are referred to as the superior and

![](_page_8_Picture_0.jpeg)

inferior aortic recesses, respectively. The inferior aortic recess extends close to the nadir of the non-coronary aortic sinus. The superior aortic recess extends to the aortic arch. The superior aortic recess is also referred to as the aorto-caval recess.

Figure 160 The frontal section showing the transverse sinus and vestigial fold.1

The heart in Figure 159 is further dissected by removing arterial trunks and viewed from the anterior direction. The vestigial fold is sandwiched between the anteriorly located transverse sinus and the posteriorly located left pulmonic recess.

The transverse sinus is located inferior to the pulmonic bifurcation, anterior to the left atrial anterior wall, posterior to the arterial trunks.

Figure 161 The inner aspect of the right pericardial recesses.

Perfused fixed heart with the remained posterior pericardium shows the right lateral aspects of the entrance/exit of the pericardial recesses and sinuses. In contrast to the transverse sinus, the right pulmonic recess and right pulmonary venous recess are generally blind-ended without communication with the transverse or oblique sinuses.

Figure 162 The inner aspect of the left pericardial recesses.

Perfused fixed heart with the remained posterior pericardium shows the left lateral aspects of the entrance/exit of the pericardial recesses and sinuses. In contrast to the transverse sinus, the left pulmonic recess and left pulmonary venous recess

are generally blind-ended. The left pulmonic recess is located posterior to the vestigial fold, separated from the anteriorly located transverse sinus.

Figure 163 The outer aspect of the pericardial recesses, sinuses, and hila of the heart. Anaglyphs 19 and 20.

The heart is dissected with the pericardium remaining intact. The pericardial space is replaced with blue-colored agar. The heart is viewed from the posterior (left) and right postero-superior (right) directions, respectively. The red and blue strings mark the pericardial reflections of the superior (arterial) hilum and posterior (venous) hilum, respectively. The superior hilum encircles the ascending aorta and pulmonary trunk. The posterior hilum encircles pulmonary and both superior and inferior vena cavae. Both of the hila are separated by the transverse sinus.2 Both of the hila serve as the exclusive entrances/

exits for the extracardiac nerves and vessels. The pulmonary venous component of the left atrium, corresponding to the left atrial dome/roof is the exact location of the posterior hilum directly facing to the mediastinum. The distance between the transverse and oblique sinuses, corresponding to the width of the posterior hilum is 18.5 mm in this particular heart, which is variable.3

Figure 164 The phrenic nerve.

The heart with intact pericardium is viewed from the right lateral (left), and left lateral (right) directions. Fluid fills the pericardial space. Both phrenic nerves typically arise from the C4 cervical root, then descend on the anterior scalenus muscle, which is located anterior to the subclavian artery. Then, it descends behind the clavicula to enter the thoracic cavity, and continues descending between the pericardium and parietal pleura to reach the diaphragm. Both phrenic nerves are identically located anterior to both pulmonary hila.4 In contrast, both vagus nerves are identically located posterior to the

![](_page_18_Picture_0.jpeg)

both pulmonary hila. The right phrenic nerve is commonly related to the postero-lateral portion of sinus venarum and anterior portion of right pulmonary veins. The left phrenic nerve is commonly related to the left atrial appendage and basal-mid left ventricular lateral wall.5 However, this spatial relationship is affected by the variation in the size and rotation of individual hearts within the pericardium. Note the closer relationship the right pulmonary hilum and right phrenic nerve have in this heart compared to the left side.

Figure 165 Epicardial access using the anterior and inferior approaches.

The hearts are viewed from the left anterior oblique direction. Epicardial access using the anterior (left) and inferior (right) approaches are replicated.6,7 The pericardial window is created to show the infundibulum, pulmonary root, and left atrial appendage. Anterior and medial free wall of the infundibulum is partially removed in part, as well as the corresponding

left anterior part of the pulmonary root involving the non-adjacent pulmonary sinus. In the anterior approach (left), note the catheter takes a sigmoid shape. In the inferior approach (right), the tip of the catheter is placed on the left atrial appendage after passing around the inferior and infero-lateral region of the left ventricle.
