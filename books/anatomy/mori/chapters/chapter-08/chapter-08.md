Figure 41 The right atrial appendage viewed from the ventricular side.1

The pectinate muscles originate from the crista terminalis and direct toward the right atrial vestibule running on the lateral and inferior free wall of the right atrial appendage. The arrangement of the pectinate muscles is variable and non-uniform, especially around the cavotricuspid isthmus.2 At its inferior end, the crista terminalis ramifies into several pectinate muscles. The wall of the right atrial appendage between the pectinate muscle is paper thin. The medial part of the right atrial

appendage faces to the aortic root intervened by the right-side transverse sinus. The sinuatrial nodal artery originating from the proximal right coronary artery runs on the epicardial side of the medial right atrial appendage.3 The paired section of this image is Figure 35.

Figure 42 The free wall of the right atrial appendage viewed from the medial direction.1

The superior part of the crista terminalis continues to the precaval bundle, also referred to as the arcuate ridge. Multiple pectinate muscles originate from the crista terminalis directing toward the right arial vestibule. The right atrial vestibule has the smooth endocardial surface, continuing to the tricuspid annulus. The crista terminalis does not extend to reach the orifice of the inferior vena cava, but it splits into several pectinate muscles radiating toward the Eustachian valve and cavotricuspid isthmus. Some pectinate muscles have a uniform parallel arrangement, whereas others show irregular crossover

patterns.2 From the precaval bundle, the sagittal bundle (also referred to as the septum spurium) originates running anterior across the body of the right atrial appendage from the medial to lateral side.2 Superior to this sagittal bundle, at the middle portion on the superior ridge of the right atrial appendage, the saddle-like bend is created.4 Transillumination (right) shows the paper-thin free wall of the right atrial appendage between the pectinate muscles. The trabeculations on the right ventricular free wall extends to the level of the atrioventricular junction.

Figure 43 The isolated right atrium.1

The upper and lower pairs of images are viewed from the right posterior and right lateral directions, respectively. The sinus venarum is not a straight structure. The proximal superior and inferior vena cava are aligned in an angled fashion to each other, with the axis of the inferior vena cava directing toward the left antero-superior direction. In contrast, the axis of the superior vena cava is nearly vertical. Therefore, the catheter inserted from the inferior vena cava in parallel fashion to its axis is delivered into the apex of the right atrial appendage. Transillumination (right) enhances the crista terminalis and pectinate muscles. The inferior part of the crista terminalis ramifies into multiple pectinate muscles in fan-like fashion. One of those pectinate muscles runs along the Eustachian valve from lateral to medial side. Others running into the cavotricuspid isthmus in oblique fashion. In addition to the free wall of the right atrial appendage between the pectinate muscles, the infero-posterior wall of the sinus venarum is thin4 and also transilluminated.

Figure 44 The ablation catheter placed at the medial wall of the right atrial appendage viewed from the right anterior oblique direction.

This site is adjacent to the aortic root/ascending aorta intervened by the right-side transverse sinus. On the medial epicardial surface of this site, right sinuatrial nodal artery may run toward superior terminal groove in two-thirds of cases.5 This medial free wall of the right atrial appendage should not be deemed as the high atrial septum. Intervention around this region has a potential risk to injure the right sinuatrial nodal artery and aortic root/ascending aorta.6

Figure 45 The transilluminated right atrium in isolation1 and *in situ*.

The right atrium is viewed from the right anterior oblique direction (left) and right superior direction (right). Ramification of the pectinate muscles from the crista terminalis and paper-thin free wall of the right atrial appendage are observed. The superior part of the crista terminalis continues to the precaval bundle, also referred to as the arcuate ridge. From the precaval bundle, the sagittal bundle runs toward the lateral wall of the right atrial appendage. Superior to the sagittal bundle, the saddle-like bend is created at the middle portion at the superior ridge of the right atrial appendage.4 The aortic root is deeply wedged into the center of the heart, surrounded by the left atrium, right atrial

appendage, and right ventricular outflow tract (infundibulum). The apex of the right atrial appendage covers the proximal aorta and the right atrioventricular groove, intervened by the right-side transverse sinus. Since the apex of the right atrial appendage is a free structure, the right-side entrance/exit of the transverse sinus can be approached either anteromedially from the medial side of the apex of the right atrial appendage, or postero-laterally over the superior ridge of the right atrial appendage.7
