Figure 86 Relationship between the pulmonary valve and the aortic root.1

The heart is viewed from the left postero-superior direction. The four cardiac valves are not all located on a single flat plane.2 The pulmonary valve is located at left antero-superior relative to the aortic valve.3 The pulmonary root and the aortic root are in a crisscross relationship. The apex of the interleaflet triangle between the right and left coronary aortic sinuses is adjacent to the apex of the interleaflet triangle between the right and left adjacent pulmonary sinuses, reflecting the development of the arterial valves within the myocardial turret.4 In the context of the correct anatomical coordinates,5 the right adjacent and non-adjacent pulmonary sinuses are located right antero-superior and left antero-superior,

respectively, whereas the left adjacent pulmonary sinus is located most postero-inferior among the three pulmonary sinuses.6 Therefore, the left adjacent pulmonary sinus is the closest to the left ventricular summit, where the left ventricular free wall is supporting the anterior half of the base of the left coronary aortic sinus.7 Encircling myocardium of the right ventricular outflow tract, referred to as the free-standing subpulmonary infundibulum, supports the bases of the three pulmonary sinuses.8

Figure 87 The sagittal section of the heart viewed from the right lateral direction.1

The posterior free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract is located anterior to the lateral left coronary aortic sinus. At this region, the right ventricular outflow tract separates from the ventricular mass.9 This site corresponds to the pulmonary (superior) attachment of the right ventricle. The posterior free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract is apart from the left ventricular free wall muscle, corresponding to the left ventricular summit. The epicardial adipose tissue on the left ventricular summit, which is removed in this specimen, intervenes the space between the left coronary aortic sinus, left ventricular summit, and posterior free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract. The basal limit of this left ventricular free wall muscle, which is beak-shaped and thin (black arrow), supports the anterior half of the left coronary aortic sinus.10 The

pulmonary root and pulmonary trunk override the left coronary aortic sinus and left coronary artery. The left adjacent pulmonary sinus is located right postero-inferior to the non-adjacent pulmonary sinus, and left antero-superior to the left coronary aortic sinus. In the medial free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract, multiple septoparietal trabeculations arise from the superior limb of the septomarginal trabeculation. The superior limb of the septomarginal trabeculation directs toward the left adjacent pulmonary sinus. This section also shows how the left atrial appendage guards the left side entrance/exit of the transverse sinus. Refer to Figure 81. The paired section of this image is Figure 100.

Figure 88 Relationship between the pulmonary trunk and the left coronary artery viewed from the left lateral direction.1

In the right image, the pulmonary root and pulmonary trunk are removed from the left image, except the semilunar attachments of the pulmonary leaflets. The proximal left main trunk of the left coronary artery is located just beneath the proximal pulmonary trunk, which is distal to the sinutubular junction of the pulmonary root, corresponding to the plane involving

three commissures of the pulmonary leaflets. The relationship between the pulmonary root and left coronary artery shows the individual variation.1,11 The proximal left anterior descending artery skirts the left and non-adjacent pulmonary sinuses postero-infero-laterally to them toward the anterior interventricular groove.

Figure 89 Relationship between the pulmonary trunk and the left coronary artery viewed from the posterior direction.1

In the right image, the pulmonary arteries and pulmonary trunk are removed from the left image. The right pulmonary artery runs inferior to the aortic arch from the left to right direction just above the roof of the left atrium (left). The proximal left coronary artery is located just beneath the proximal pulmonary trunk. The proximal left anterior descending artery runs

postero-infero-laterally to the left adjacent pulmonary sinus, skirting the sinus toward the anterior interventricular groove (right). Small diagonal, high-lateral, and obtuse marginal branches are observed on the left ventricular summit (right). Refer to Figure 92.

Figure 90 Relationship between the pulmonary trunk and the aortic root viewed from the right and left anterior oblique directions.1

When viewed from the right anterior oblique direction (left), the pulmonary valve is located left antero-superior to the aortic valve. The pulmonary root directs to the supero-posterior direction. The right and non-adjacent pulmonary sinuses are located superior to the proximal left anterior descending artery when viewed from this direction. When viewed from the left anterior oblique direction (right), the pulmonary valve is overlapped with the proximal aorta located behind. Although the aortic root commonly directs toward the right antero-superior direction, the pulmonary root directs toward the postero-superior direction. The proximal left anterior descending artery runs on the left ventricular summit behind

the left adjacent pulmonary sinus. After it skirts the pulmonary root, it changes course along the anterior interventricular groove toward the cardiac apex. Thus, the proximal left anterior descending artery and its bending portion are the useful markers to locate the pulmonary root. The proximal-mid left anterior descending artery shows the myocardial bridge. The orifice of the left atrial appendage is located infero-lateral to the distal pulmonary trunk. This proximity between the pulmonary trunk and the left atrial appendage is important to estimate potential risk of injury to the pulmonary trunk during implantation of a left atrial appendage closure device.12

Figure 91 The pulmonary valves.1

The relationship between the pulmonary root, left atrial appendage, left coronary artery, and the aortic root is shown in the left image. The left adjacent pulmonary aortic sinus faces to the proximal left coronary artery. The left atrial appendage covers the left and non-adjacent pulmonary sinuses. Encircling myocardium of the right ventricular outflow tract supports the bases of the three pulmonary sinuses (right images). When viewed from the pulmonary trunk, these myocardial supports are observed as the crescent of the myocardium incorporated at the base of each sinus.7 The distal margin of this myocardial crescent corresponds to the ventriculo-arterial junction. In the pulmonary root, the ventriculo-arterial junction

is consistently located distal to the virtual basal ring. These myocardial crescents can be the substrate of the ventricular arrhythmia ablated from the pulmonary sinuses. The U-turn approach is an alternative option to map and ablate these myocardial crescents.13 The fibrous wall of the pulmonary sinuses of Valsalva is removed, while the semilunar attachments of the pulmonary leaflet and myocardial crescents remain, as shown in the lower image on the right page. The proximal left anterior descending artery skirting the pulmonary root is observed adjacent to the interleaflet triangle between the left and non-adjacent pulmonary sinuses.
