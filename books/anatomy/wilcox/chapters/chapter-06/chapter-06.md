Systems for describing congenital cardiac malformations have frequently been based upon embryological concepts and theories. As useful as these systems have been, they have often had the effect of confusing the clinician, rather than clarifying the basic anatomy of a given lesion. As far as the surgeon is concerned, the essence of a particular malformation lies not in its presumed morphogenesis, but in the underlying anatomy. An effective system for describing this anatomy must be based upon the morphology as it is observed. At the same time, it must be capable of accounting for all congenital cardiac conditions, even those that, as yet, might not have been encountered. To be useful clinically, the system must be not only broad and accurate, but also clear and consistent. The terminology used. therefore, should be unambiguous. It should be as simple as possible. The sequential segmental approach provides such a system<sup>1</sup>, particularly when the emphasis is placed on its surgical applications<sup>2</sup>. The basis of the system is, in the first instance, to analyse individually the architectural make-up of the atrial chambers, the ventricular mass, and the arterial segment<sup>3</sup>. Emphasis is thus given to the nature of the junctional arrangements (Figure 6.1). Still further attention is devoted to the interrelationships of the cardiac structures within each of the individual segments. This provides the

basic framework within which all other associated malformations can be catalogued<sup>4</sup>.

### **ATRIAL ARRANGEMENT**

The first step in analysing any malformed heart is to determine the arrangement of the chambers within the atrial mass. When distinction is based on the anatomy of the appendages, which are the most constant components of the atriums, and specifically on the extent of the pectinate muscles relative to the atrial vestibules<sup>5</sup>, atrial chambers can be of only morphologically right or morphologically left type. The morphologically right appendage is broad and triangular (Figure 6.2), whereas the morphologically left appendage is fingerlike, and has a much narrower neck (Figure 6.3). In most instances, it is possible to identify the appendages simply on the basis of their shape (Figure 6.4). Only in circumstances of uncertainty will it prove necessary to inspect the extent of the pectinate muscles (Figures 6.5, 6.6). This feature, of course, is readily visible to the surgeon once the atrial chambers have been opened.

When judged on the extent of the pectinate muscles, there are only four topological ways in which the appendages can be arranged within the atrial mass (Figure 6.7). Almost always, the atrium

possessing the appendage in which the pectinate muscles extend to the crux is right-sided, while the one with a smooth inferoposterior vestibule is left-sided. This usual arrangement is often called 'situs solitus'. Rarely, the appendages can be disposed in mirror-image fashion, so-called 'situs inversus'. More common than the mirror-imaged topological arrangement, but still relatively rare, is the situation in which the appendages of both chambers in the atrial mass have the same morphology. This can occur in two forms, with either morphologically right (Figure 6.8) or morphologically left (Figure 6.9) appendages on both sides. These bilaterally symmetrical topological patterns, or isomeric arrangements, have traditionally been named according to the arrangement of the abdominal organs, particularly the spleen. This is because they usually exist with a jumbled up abdominal arrangement, an arrangement also termed visceral heterotaxy<sup>6</sup>. It is far more convenient, as well as more accurate, to designate them in terms of their own intrinsic morphology<sup>8</sup>, particularly as this can be determined readily by the surgeon in the operating room. Isomerism of the right appendages is usually, but not always, found with absence of the spleen. It is most often associated with right bronchial isomerism. Isomerism of the left appendages is typically found, but again not always, with multiple spleens. The

**Fig. 6.1** The cartoon shows the three segments of the heart. These are the atriums, the ventricular mass, and the arterial trunks. The segments are joined together at the atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial junctions.

association with left bronchial isomerism is more constant.

The anticipated topological arrangement of the atrial appendages can be predicted preoperatively with a high

degree of accuracy by studying the relationships of the abdominal great vessels as determined with cross-sectional ultrasonography10. When identified, knowledge of isomerism of the atrial

appendages is of value in two additional ways. Firstly, it alerts the surgeon to unusual dispositions of the sinus node11. In right isomerism, the sinus node, being a morphologically right atrial structure, is

**Fig. 6.4** This operative view, taken through a median sternotomy, shows the differences between the broad triangular morphologically right atrial appendage, and the narrow finger-like morphologically left atrial appendage.

**Fig. 6.5** The computed tomogram shows the extensive pectinate muscles found in the roof of the morphologically right atrium. When assessed relative to the vestibule of the atrioventricular junction, they extend to the crux of the heart.

duplicated. A node is found laterally in each of the terminal grooves<sup>12</sup>. In left isomerism, there are no terminal grooves (Figure 6.9). In this situation, the sinus node is a poorly formed structure, without

a constant site. Usually the node is found in the anterior interatrial groove, close to the atrioventricular junction<sup>12</sup>.

The second advantage of recognising isomeric appendages is that the

arrangements are known to be harbingers of complex intracardiac lesions. Hearts with isomerism of either type tend to have bilateral superior caval veins, an effectively common atrial chamber, albeit with two

![](_page_3_Picture_2.jpeg)

Fig. 6.6 As shown in this computed tomogram, the pectinate muscles of the morphologically left appendage are confined within the tubular component, which has a very narrow junction with the body of the atrium (black double-headed arrow).

![](_page_3_Picture_4.jpeg)

Fig. 6.7 The cartoon shows the four possible arrangements of the atrial appendages, which cannot always be distinguished on the basis of their shape. The best means of distinguishing between them is to establish the extent of the pectinate muscles. These muscles extend all the way to the crux in the morphologically right atrial appendage, but are confined around the mouth of the appendage in the morphologically left atrial appendage, leaving a smooth posterior vestibule. Using this criterion, all congenitally malformed hearts have appendages fitting within one of the four groups shown in the cartoon.

isomeric appendages, and common atrioventricular valves. Right isomerism is always associated with a totally anomalous pulmonary venous connection, even if the pulmonary veins are joined to one or other atrium. It is also seen most frequently with pulmonary stenosis or atresia, and in association with a univentricular atrioventricular connection, typically a double-inlet ventricle through a common valve. Left isomerism, in the majority of cases, is associated with interruption of the

inferior caval vein, with continuation of the venous drainage from the abdomen through the azygos system of veins.

# THE ATRIOVENTRICULAR JUNCTIONS

Having established the arrangement of the atrial appendages, the next step in sequential analysis is to determine the morphology of the atrioventricular

junctions. For this, the surgeon needs to know how the atrial chambers are, or are not, connected to the chambers present within the ventricular mass. Most often, there are two such chambers, which can be of only right or left morphology. The morphological distinction is based on the nature of the apical trabeculations. In the morphologically right ventricle, these trabeculations are coarse, in contrast to the fine criss-crossing trabeculations that characterise the morphologically left

![](_page_4_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 6.8** This surgical view through a median sternotomy shows a left-sided atrial appendage of morphologically right pattern. The right-sided appendage is also of right morphology, so the patient has isomerism of the right atrial appendages. Note the crest of the appendage in relation to the left superior caval vein and the terminal groove. When examined internally, pectinate muscles encircled both atrioventricular junctions.

**Fig. 6.9** This surgical view through a median sternotomy shows a right-sided atrial appendage of morphologically left pattern. The left-sided appendage is also of left morphology, so the patient has isomerism of the left atrial appendages. Note the absence of any terminal groove. Internal inspection confirmed the presence of smooth bilateral posterior vestibules.

ventricle (Figure 6.10). It is the interrelationships between the two ventricles that permit the description of ventricular topology. When analysed according to the way that the palmar surfaces of the hands can be placed on the

septal surface of the morphologically right ventricle such that the thumb is within the inlet component, and the fingers in the ventricular outlet, the patterns reflect either right-hand or left-hand topology (Figure 6.11). Having assessed ventricular

morphology, it is possible to determine the way in which the atrial chambers are connected, or not connected, to the ventricular mass. In most instances, there are two atrioventricular junctions, although one of the junctions can be absent. Also

Right-hand topology Left-hand topology

![](_page_5_Picture_6.jpeg)

Fig. 6.11 The cartoon shows how the patterns of ventricular topology can be described, figuratively speaking, in terms of the way that the palmar surface of the hands can be placed on the septal surface of the morphologically right ventricle. The fingers point up the outlet, and the thumb lies in the inlet, giving right-hand and left-hand patterns. In the arrangements shown, the atrioventricular connections are concordant, but the ventriculoarterial connections can also be discordant, with the aorta arising from the morphologically right ventricle (see Figure 6.29).

important is the morphology of the valves that guard the atrioventricular junctions, because the paired junctions can be guarded by a common atrioventricular valve. This shows that junctional and valvar morphology are separate and independent features.

There are five distinct and discrete ways in which the atrial chambers may be connected to the ventricular mass, the final one having two subtypes, along with an

intriguing further variation. Most often, the atrial chambers are connected to their morphologically appropriate ventricles. This pattern is called concordant atrioventricular connections. When each atrium is connected in this way to its own ventricle, there is rarely any difficulty in distinguishing the morphology of the ventricles, even when the ventricles themselves are unusually related one to the other. In the second pattern, which

represents discordant connections, each atrium is connected with a morphologically inappropriate ventricle.

Concordant and discordant connections can exist with either the usual or mirror-imaged arrangement of the atrial appendages (Figure 6.12), but not with isomeric appendages. When the appendages are isomeric, and each atrium is connected to its own ventricle, then of necessity one junction will be

![](_page_6_Picture_2.jpeg)

Fig. 6.12 The cartoon shows how the atrial chambers can be connected to the ventricles in concordant or discordant fashion, with each pattern existing in usual and mirror-imaged variants.

Left-hand topology Left-hand topology

Fig. 6.13 The cartoon demonstrates the mixed and biventricular atrioventricular connections found when there are isomeric atrial appendages, and each atrium is connected to its own ventricle. In each pattern, half of the heart is concordantly connected, and the other half is discordant. It is essential in these settings, therefore, to describe both the type of isomerism, and the specific ventricular topology.

concordantly connected, but the other junction will be discordantly connected (Figure 6.13). This will occur irrespective of the topological pattern of the

ventricular mass (see later). The arrangement produces a third discrete pattern, namely biventricular and mixed atrioventricular connections.

In the three connections described thus far, each atrium is connected to its own ventricle. This means that the atrioventricular connections themselves are biventricular. The essential feature in the remaining two types of atrioventricular connection is that the atrial chambers, with one exception, connect to only one ventricle. In one of these patterns, both atrial chambers connect to the same ventricle. This is a double-inlet atrioventricular connection (Figure 6.14). In the other variant, one of the atrial chambers is connected to a ventricle, but the other atrium has no connection with the ventricular mass. This latter arrangement can be divided into two subtypes, depending on whether absence of the connection is right-sided (Figure 6.15) or left-sided (Figure 6.16). An intriguing variation is seen when one

of the atrioventricular connections is absent, be it right-sided or left-sided, namely when the atrioventricular valve guarding the solitary connection straddles the septum, being attached in both ventricles. The end result is a uniatrial, but biventricular, atrioventricular connection (Figure 6.17).

There has been much controversy concerning the description of the hearts in which the atrial chambers connect to only one ventricle. It became conventional to describe them in terms of single ventricle, common ventricle, or univentricular hearts. It is exceedingly rare, however, to find patients with solitary ventricles. Almost always, in patients

described as having univentricular hearts, the ventricular mass contains more than one chamber. By focusing on the fact that the atrioventricular connection is, in reality, joined to only one ventricle, we are able to achieve a satisfactory solution for this dilemma. Thus, the hearts can logically and accurately be described in terms of being functionally univentricular. It follows that, in some patients with biventricular atrioventricular connections, imbalance between the ventricles can again produce a functionally univentricular arrangement13. In those with univentricular atrioventricular connections, however, one of the ventricles must be incomplete, while the other

Fig. 6.14 When both atriums are connected to only one ventricle, the atrioventricular connection is univentricular. In this heart, showing a four-chamber section in anatomical orientation, there is a double inlet to a dominant left ventricle. The black braces show the segments of atrial vestibular myocardium, connected to the dominant left ventricle through separate atrioventricular valves.

Fig. 6.15 This anatomical specimen, seen in four-chamber orientation, shows the absence of the right atrioventricular connection, with the fibroadipose tissue of the right atrioventricular (AV) groove interposing between the right atrial floor and the base of the ventricular mass. This arrangement produces another form of univentricular atrioventricular connection. In this case, the morphology is that of classical tricuspid atresia, with the left atrium connected to a dominant left ventricle. Note the presence of the base of the incomplete right ventricle (arrow), which has no connection with the atrial chambers.

Fig. 6.16 This anatomical specimen, again seen in four-chamber orientation (compare with Figures 6.14 and 6.15), shows the absence of the left atrioventricular connection (red dotted line), giving the third variant of univentricular atrioventricular connection. In this example, the right atrium is connected to a dominant left ventricle through a right-sided atrioventricular valve.

ventricle is dominant. The dominant ventricle, which supports the atrioventricular junction or junctions, can take one of three morphologies: right, left, or indeterminate (Figure 6.18). Most frequently, as judged from the pattern of its apical trabecular component, the dominant ventricle will be morphologically left. There will be a complementary right ventricle, perforce incomplete because it will lack its atrioventricular connection, and hence its inlet component. Such

incomplete right ventricles are always found anterosuperiorly relative to the dominant left ventricle, irrespective of whether there is a double inlet, or an absent right or absent left atrioventricular connection. They can, however, be

Fig. 6.17 This cartoon illustrates the arrangement when there is an absence of the right atrioventricular (AV) connection, but with the solitary atrioventricular valve straddling the ventricular septum.

positioned either to the right (Figure 6.19), or to the left (Figure 6.20) relative to the dominant ventricle.

More rarely, the atrial chambers can be connected to a dominant right ventricle. This happens most frequently in the absence of the left atrioventricular

connection (Figure 6.21), but can be found with a double inlet or, rarely, with an absence of the right atrioventricular connection. When only the right ventricle is connected to the atrial chambers, and hence dominant, it is the left ventricle that is incomplete, lacking its atrioventricular

connection and its inlet portion. The incomplete left ventricle will always be found in a posteroinferior position. Usually it is left-sided, although rarely it can be right-sided.

or, exceedingly rarely, with an absence of either atrioventricular connection, is when the atrial chambers connect to a solitary ventricle. Such solitary

ventricles have indeterminate apical trabecular morphology (Figure 6.22). Incomplete second ventricles are never found in this variant of

univentricular atrioventricular connection, in which the only septal structure in the ventricle is that separating the outflow tracts.

## VALVAR MORPHOLOGY

The atrioventricular valvar morphology is independent of the way in which the atrial chambers connect with the ventricles. Valvar morphology, therefore, constitutes a separate feature of the atrioventricular junctions. When there are concordant, discordant, mixed, or double-inlet connections, then both atrial chambers are connected, actually or potentially, to the ventricular mass. The two atrioventricular junctions can be

guarded by two separate atrioventricular valves (Figure 6.23), or by a common valve (Figure 6.24). When there are two valves, either of them can be imperforate, blocking a potential atrioventricular connection. An imperforate valve, therefore, needs to be

![](_page_12_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 6.23** This normal heart, sectioned in four-chamber orientation, shows the right and left atrioventricular junctions (black dotted lines with double-headed arrows) guarded by separate atrioventricular valves.

**Fig. 6.24** This section, again in four-chamber orientation (compare with Figure 6.23), shows that the right and left atrioventricular junctions (black dotted line with double-headed arrow) are guarded by a common atrioventricular valve in the setting of an atrioventricular septal defect.

distinguished from absence of an atrioventricular connection, as either can produce atrioventricular valvar atresia. The essence of the imperforate valve is that the atrioventricular connection has formed, but is blocked by the conjoined valvar leaflets (Figure 6.25). In the setting of absence of the connection, the floor of the atrium involved is completely separated from the ventricular mass by the fibroadipose tissue of the atrioventricular groove (see Figures 6.15, 6.16).

![](_page_13_Picture_2.jpeg)

Fig. 6.25 This section of a heart, cut in four-chamber orientation, shows an imperforate right atrioventricular valve connecting to a hypoplastic right ventricle. The atrioventricular connections remain concordant, even though the right valve (arrow) is imperforate.

![](_page_13_Picture_4.jpeg)

Fig. 6.26 This section of a heart, seen in four-chamber orientation, shows how the tension apparatus of the right atrioventricular valve (arrows) is attached to both sides of the ventricular septum (star), while the orifice of the right atrioventricular junction (white brace) is overriding the septal crest (star).

Either of two valves, or a common valve, can also straddle a septum within the ventricular mass. Straddling of the tension apparatus of a valve should be distinguished from overriding of its supporting atrioventricular junction. Straddling exists when the valvar tension apparatus is

attached to both sides of the ventricular septum (Figure 6.26). Overriding is present when the junction is connected to both ventricles. The degree of override, which usually coexists with straddling, determines the precise atrioventricular connection present. So as to adjudicate the connection

in the presence of overriding, the overriding valve is assigned to the ventricle connected to its greater part (Figure 6.27).

The possible arrangements are much more limited when one atrioventricular connection is absent. In this situation, the solitary valve can either be committed in its

![](_page_14_Picture_2.jpeg)

Fig. 6.27 In the presence of an overriding junction, whether it is a straddling tricuspid valve as shown in Figure 6.26 or ventriculoarterial, the overriding junction (black braces) is assigned to the ventricle supporting its greater part. In the situation illustrated with the straddling tricuspid valve, the atrioventricular connections are defined accordingly. There is a spectrum between the illustrated extremes (doubleheaded arrow). The left-hand panel shows the situation with the junction connected primarily to the right ventricle (large arrow), the lesser part joining the left ventricle (small arrow). Hence, the atrioventricular connections are deemed to be concordant. In the right-hand panel, the larger part of the overriding junction is committed to the left ventricle, so that the connection is deemed to be a double inlet. This is the essence of the 50% rule. RA, LA, right and left atriums; RV, LV, right and left ventricles.

entirety to one ventricle, or it can straddle and override. When the valve straddles and overrides in this setting, then the atrioventricular connection itself is uniatrial but biventricular (Figure 6.17).

## VENTRICULAR MORPHOLOGY AND TOPOLOGY

The nature of the atrioventricular connections is inextricably linked with the architectural arrangement of the ventricular mass. Biventricular atrioventricular connections, for example, cannot be diagnosed without knowledge of ventricular morphology. Double-inlet and absent connections can all be identified without mention of ventricular morphology, although in this setting it is always necessary to give more information concerning the arrangement of the ventricular mass. In the case of mixed and biventricular atrioventricular connections, it is important to describe the pattern in which the morphologically right ventricle is structured relative to the morphologically left ventricle. This feature can take only one of two topological arrangements. This is because, when the connections are mixed, the right-sided atrium, with either a morphologically right or left appendage, can be connected to either a morphologically right or a morphologically left ventricle (see Figure 6.13). When there is right isomerism, and the right-sided atrium is connected to a morphologically right ventricle, the ventricular mass typically is seen as in hearts with concordant atrioventricular connections and the usual atrial arrangement. In contrast, when there is right isomerism, and the right-sided atrium is connected to a morphologically left ventricle, the ventricular mass is usually found in the presence of discordant atrioventricular connections and the usual atrial arrangement.

As we have discussed already, these two basic patterns of ventricular topology can conveniently be described according to the way in which the hands, figuratively speaking, can be placed palm downwards upon the septal surface of the morphologically right ventricle. The other hand will then fit in the morphologically left ventricle in similar fashion, but it is the arrangement of the morphologically right ventricle that is chosen for the purposes of description (Figure 6.11). In the hearts with biventricular and mixed atrioventricular connections, it is this ventricular topology that determines the disposition of the atrioventricular

conduction tissues11. When the atrial chambers connect to only one ventricle, the morphology of that ventricle must always be described. This is because the dominant ventricle can be of left ventricular, right ventricular, or solitary and indeterminate pattern. It is also necessary to describe the relationships of the dominant and incomplete ventricles.

## VENTRICULAR RELATIONSHIPS

Ventricular relationships, as opposed to ventricular topology, generally should be described as a separate feature of the heart. Where each atrium is connected to its own ventricle, the relationships are almost always in harmony with both the connection and topology present. When the atrial chambers are in their usual position with concordant atrioventricular connections, the relationships described in the setting of the heart within the chest are almost always for the morphologically right ventricle to be right-sided, anterior, and inferior to the morphologically left ventricle. In mirror-imaged atrial arrangement, with concordant atrioventricular connections, the morphologically right ventricle is almost invariably left-sided and relatively anterior,

![](_page_15_Picture_2.jpeg)

Fig. 6.28 The left side of the heart is shown from a patient with discordant atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial connections; in other words, congenitally corrected transposition. It is the palmar surface of the left hand only that can be placed on the septal surface of the morphologically right ventricle so that the fingers occupy the ventricular outlet, and the thumb goes in the tricuspid valve guarding the inlet component.

![](_page_15_Picture_4.jpeg)

Fig. 6.29 The computed tomogram shows the right side of the heart from a patient having congenitally corrected transposition in the setting of a mirror-imaged atrial arrangement. The morphologically left atrium is right-sided, but connects to a morphologically right ventricle with right-hand topology, the palmar surface of the right hand fitting on the septal surface so that the fingers are in the subaortic outlet and the thumb in the inlet component.

but frequently more side-by-side relative to its neighbour.

With the atrial chambers in their usual arrangement, and discordant atrioventricular connections, there is almost always the lefthand pattern of ventricular topology. The usual relationship is for the morphologically

right ventricle to be left-sided (Figure 6.28). When discordant atrioventricular connections accompany mirror-imaged atrial arrangement, there is usually right-hand topology (Figure 6.29). The ventricular relationships are thus similar to those seen in the normal heart, although the two chambers tend to be more side-by-side. When the relationships are as anticipated, it is unnecessary to describe them. Very occasionally, the relationships of the ventricles are not as anticipated for the connections present. This disharmony between connections and relationships

arterial trunk

Solitary arterial trunk

Fig. 6.30 This cartoon shows the patterns that identify the morphology of the arterial trunks. When there is absence of the intrapericardial pulmonary arteries, there is no way of knowing if, had there been an atretic pulmonary trunk, it would have originated from the base of the heart or from the aorta. This pattern, therefore, is best described as a solitary arterial trunk.

underscores the anomaly known as the crisscross heart14. With these hearts, and also those with superoinferior ventricles, connections and relationships must be described separately, using as much detail as is necessary to achieve unambiguous categorisation. The essence of the criss-cross heart, and those with superoinferior ventricles, is that the ventricular relationships are not as expected for the atrioventricular connection present. Even more rarely, the ventricular topology may be disharmonious with the atrioventricular connection15. All features must then be described.

In hearts with a univentricular atrioventricular connection, it is the relationship of the incomplete ventricle to the dominant ventricle that must be described. When the left ventricle is dominant, the incomplete right ventricle is always anterosuperior, but can be right- or left-sided. The sidedness of the ventricle does not affect the basic disposition of the atrioventricular conduction tissues in these hearts. With a dominant right ventricle, the incomplete and rudimentary left ventricle, if present, is always posteroinferior, but again can be right- or left-sided. In this case, the sidedness of the incomplete ventricle will affect the disposition of the atrioventricular conduction tissue.

When considering the atrioventricular junctions, therefore, there are four different features to take into account. These are, firstly, the way the atrial myocardium is connected to the ventricular mass; secondly, the morphology of the atrioventricular valves guarding the junctions; thirdly, the ventricular morphology and topology; and finally, the

ventricular relationships. All are of importance to the surgeon because they influence the disposition of the atrioventricular conduction axis.

# VENTRICULOARTERIAL JUNCTIONS

Analysis of the ventriculoarterial junctions proceeds as described for the atrioventricular junctions, with the morphology of the connections, the valvar morphology, and the relationships of the arterial trunks being different facets requiring separate description in mutually exclusive terms. It is also necessary to take account of infundibular morphology.

## Ventriculoarterial connections

There are four discrete ways in which the arterial trunks can take their origin from the ventricular mass; namely, in concordant, discordant, double-outlet, and single-outlet fashion. Concordant ventriculoarterial connections exist when the arterial trunks arise from morphologically appropriate ventricles. Discordant connections account for the trunks being connected with morphologically inappropriate ventricles. Double-outlet connections exist when both great arteries take origin from the same ventricle, which may be of right, left, or indeterminate morphology. A single-outlet arrangement is seen when only one arterial trunk is connected to the heart. This may be a common trunk, directly supplying the systemic, pulmonary, and coronary

arteries, or it may be an aortic or pulmonary trunk when the complementary arterial trunk is atretic, and its connection to a known ventricle cannot be established (Figure 6.30). Rarely, in the absence of intrapericardial pulmonary arteries, it may be more accurate to describe an arterial trunk as solitary rather than common (Figure 6.30).

# Arterial valvar morphology

The morphological arrangement of the arterial valves is limited because they have no tension apparatus. Furthermore, a common valve can exist only with a common trunk. The different patterns, therefore, involve one or two arterial valves. Usually both valves are perforate, but either or both may override the ventricular septum. When a valvar orifice is overriding, the valve is assigned to the ventricle supporting its greater part, thus avoiding the need for intermediate categories. The other pattern of valvar morphology is when one of the arterial valves is imperforate. As with the atrioventricular junctions, an imperforate arterial valve must be distinguished from absence of one ventriculoarterial connection, as both can produce arterial valvar atresia.

# Infundibular morphology

Describing the morphology at the ventriculoarterial junctions also involves the arrangement of the musculature within the ventricular outflow tracts. This is infundibular morphology. Although the outlet regions are integral parts of the

ventricular mass, it is traditional to consider them in concert with the great arteries. The two outflow tracts together make a complete cone of musculature,

which has parietal and septal components, along with a component adjacent to the atrioventricular junction (Figure 6.31). The parietal components make up the

anterior free wall of the outflow tracts. The septal component is the outlet, or infundibular, septum. This has a body, with septal and parietal insertions, best

seen in the setting of tetralogy of Fallot (Figure 6.32). The component adjacent to the atrioventricular junction is the ventriculoinfundibular fold. It separates the leaflets of arterial from atrioventricular valves (Figure 6.33). It is the inner heart curvature16. The fold may be attenuated to give arterial-atrioventricular valvar fibrous continuity (Figure 6.34).

The infundibular structures never contain or overlie conduction tissue<sup>17</sup> . They should be distinguished from another structure, namely the septomarginal trabeculation, or septal

band. This latter structure is part of the ventricular septum, reinforcing its right ventricular aspect. It has a body that continues apically as the moderator band, and two limbs (Figure 6.35). The anterocephalad limb, in the normal heart, extends to the pulmonary valve,

**Fig. 6.35** The septal surface of the normal right ventricle is photographed to show the extent of the septomarginal trabeculation, or septal band, as shown by the white Y. In the normal heart, the supraventricular crest inserts between the limbs of the trabeculation. The star shows the moderator band, one of the series of septoparietal trabeculations that take origin from the anterior surface of the marginal trabeculation.

overlying the outlet septum. The posterocaudal limb runs beneath the interventricular membranous septum. This posterocaudal limb usually overlies the branching part of the atrioventricular bundle, with the right bundle branch passing down to the apex of the right ventricle within the body of the trabeculation.

Although each outflow tract is potentially a complete muscular structure, in most hearts it is only the outflow tract of the right ventricle that is a complete muscular cone. This is because, within the left ventricle, part of the ventriculoinfundibular fold is usually attenuated to permit fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the arterial and atrioventricular valves. In the normal heart, therefore, there is a muscular subpulmonary infundibulum in the right ventricle, and fibrous valvar continuity in the roof of the left ventricle. In congenitally malformed hearts, three other patterns may be found. These are, firstly, a muscular subaortic infundibulum with pulmonary-atrioventricular continuity; secondly, a bilaterally muscular infundibulum; and thirdly, bilateral deficiency of the infundibulums.

In the presence of a common arterial trunk, there may be a complete muscular subtruncal infundibulum, but more often there is truncal-atrioventricular valvar continuity.

# Arterial valvar and truncal relationships

The final feature of consideration at the ventriculoarterial junctions is the relationship of the arterial valves and arterial trunks. Valvar relationships are independent of both ventriculoarterial connections and infundibular morphology. Of the many methods of description, our preference is to describe the aortic relative to the pulmonary valve as viewed from below in right-left. anteroposterior and, when necessary, superoinferior coordinates. This can be done as precisely as required. In our experience, eight coordinates combining lateral and anterior to posterior positions suffice (Figure 6.36). When describing the relationship of the arterial trunks, it is sufficient to account for trunks that spiral around each other as they ascend, and to distinguish them from trunks that ascend in parallel fashion<sup>18</sup>.

### **POSITION OF THE HEART**

The system discussed in this chapter establishes the cardiac template. Irrespective of the internal architecture, it is well known that the heart itself can occupy many and varied positions (see Chapter 10), particularly when there are complex intracardiac malformations. To describe the position of the heart in unambiguous fashion, account should be taken separately of its site within the thorax, and the orientation of its apex. We describe the heart as being in the left or right side of the chest, or in the midline. Apical orientation is described as being to the left, to the middle, or to the right.

# CATALOGUE OF MALFORMATIONS

Having described the template of the heart, and its position, finally it is necessary to catalogue all intracardiac malformations. In most cases, it is these lesions which will require surgical attention. Any lesion, nonetheless, cannot be presumed to be the only lesion present until the rest of the

heart has been established as normal. It is these associated lesions that will be emphasised in subsequent chapters, taking particular note, as before, of the features of surgical significance.
