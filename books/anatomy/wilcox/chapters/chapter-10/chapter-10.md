The surgical problems posed by cardiac malformations may be considerably increased when the heart itself is in an abnormal position. This is, in part, due to the unusual anatomical perspective presented to the surgeon because of the malposition, and also to the abnormal locations of the cardiac chambers, which may necessitate approaches other than those already discussed. Cardiac malposition itself, nonetheless, does not constitute a diagnosis. Any normal or abnormal segmental combination can be found in a heart that, itself, is abnormally located. The heart may be normal, despite its abnormal location, but extremely complex anomalies are frequently present. Consequently, the very presence of an abnormal cardiac position emphasises the need for a full and detailed segmental analysis of the heart. All the rules enunciated in Chapter 6 apply should the heart not be in its anticipated position. In this chapter, we confine ourselves to a description of abnormally positioned hearts, giving a more detailed discussion for specific types of malposition. We conclude with a review of the surgical significance of isomerism of the atrial appendages, which is generally agreed to be one of the major harbingers of abnormal

cardiac position. We emphasise the need to segregate the syndromes, preferably into the subsets of right versus left isomerism, as the prognosis is markedly different for the two variants.

### THE ABNORMALLY POSITIONED HEART

Account should be taken of not only an abnormal position of the heart within the chest, but also the direction of its apex. These are independent features. In the normal individual, the heart is positioned with its apex to the left, and with twothirds of its bulk to the left of the midline. A mirror-imaged atrial arrangement is usually accompanied by a mirror-imaged cardiac arrangement. The expected arrangement is for the cardiac apex to point to the right, with the greater part of the cardiac mass in the right hemithorax. In the setting of isomerism of the atrial appendages, there is no norm. Thus, for all patients with isomerism, and equally for those with the usual or mirror-imaged atrial arrangements and abnormally positioned hearts, it is necessary to have a system that permits a simple and straightforward description of the abnormal

cardiac position. In the past, formidable conventions were constructed, using terms such as dextrocardia, dextroposition, dextrorotation, or arcane variants such as pivotal dextrocardia<sup>1</sup> . In practice, the only requirement is for a system that accounts for the two major features in independent fashion, namely the position of the cardiac mass relative to the silhouette of the chest, and the direction of the cardiac apex. In the past, we have defined dextrocardia as the situation in which the heart is in the right chest, with the apex pointing to the right (Figure 10.1). But what happens on the rare occasion when the heart is in the right chest, but its apex is pointing to the left? This situation is readily, and unambiguously, described as the heart located in the right chest, with its apex pointing to the left. Those who wish to give nominative definitions to the arrangement are free to do so, but the descriptive approach is entirely adequate, and much less liable to misconstruction. Thus, the heart can be described as being mostly in the left chest, mostly in the right chest, or symmetrical. The apical orientation can be to the left, to the right, or to the middle.

Fig. 10.1 This operative view through a median sternotomy shows a patient with a mirror-imaged arrangement of the organs. The heart is mostly in the right chest, with the apex pointing to the right (arrow).

### **EXTERIORISATION OF THE HEART**

The description given earlier does not account for the most severe cardiac malposition, namely exteriorisation of the heart, or ectopia cordis. It has been said that the heart can protrude from the thoracic cavity in cervical, thoracic, thoracoabdominal, or abdominal positions. A previous review<sup>2</sup> questioned the existence of the cervical and abdominal

variants, arguing that all cases can be described as thoracic or thoracoabdominal. In the thoracic type, which is the most common, there is a sternal defect and absence of the parietal pericardium. The heart protrudes directly from the thorax<sup>3</sup>. There is usually an associated omphalocele, and the thoracic cavity is small.

In the thoracoabdominal type, the sternal defect is usually confluent with deficiencies of the abdominal wall and diaphragm, so the heart and various abdominal organs are displaced into an omphalocele. A variant of this abnormality is seen in patients with Cantrell's syndrome<sup>4</sup>. These patients have a cleft of the lower sternum. The heart is beneath the skin in the upper epigastrium, and is associated with an omphalocele (Figure 10.2). When the skin was opened in the patient shown in Figure 10.2, the heart was seen to occupy a position in the midline (Figure 10.3),

**Fig. 10.2** This picture, taken from the right side of the epigastrium with the patient supine, shows the heart bulging through the skin (star) because of a cleft in the lower sternum and diastasis of the rectus muscles. An associated abdominal hernia is collapsed.

extending towards the omphalocele through a diaphragmatic defect. These patients frequently have complex intracardiac defects, often including a diverticulum of the left ventricle.

### **RIGHT-SIDED HEART**

Our descriptive system provides no information as to whether the abnormal location of the heart is the result of congenital malformation. The heart may be in the right chest secondary to a pulmonary defect, or because of gross enlargement of its right-sided chambers. In either case, the problems of surgical access are similar. Indeed, there is no reason why, in a patient with a lesion such as congenitally corrected transposition, the heart should not be positioned in the right chest because of pulmonary problems or right-sided hypertrophy.

There are certain lesions, nonetheless, that spring to mind when the heart is located in the right chest with the usual atrial arrangement, or when the heart is left-sided in patients with mirror-imaged atrial chambers. The most notable of these is, indeed, congenitally corrected transposition. In this lesion, of course, not all the cardiac chambers are in their expected positions. In all patients with

abnormally positioned hearts, therefore, it is essential that the surgeon establish the locations of the chambers within the abnormally located organ so that the operation can be planned appropriately.

## CRISS-CROSS AND SUPEROINFERIOR VENTRICLES

With the sophistication of modern diagnostic techniques, it is unlikely that the surgeon will be presented with a patient having an abnormally located heart without a full preoperative diagnosis. Particular arrangements of the cardiac chambers can still give major difficulties in diagnosis, notably the arrangements known as crisscross hearts, or superoinferior ventricles. In these anomalies, the ventricular relationships, or more rarely the ventricular topology, when topology is defined as proposed in Chapter 6, are not as anticipated for the given atrioventricular connections<sup>5</sup>. In a patient with congenitally corrected transposition and the criss-cross arrangement, the morphologically right ventricle will be predominantly right-sided rather than in its anticipated left-sided position<sup>6</sup>. This is a consequence of rotation of the ventricular mass in its long axis (Figure 10.4). The distribution of the coronary arteries is of considerable help in determining the position of the ventricles

because, in congenitally corrected transposition, the anterior interventricular coronary artery arises from the right-sided coronary artery. Thus, in a heart that at first sight appears to represent simple transposition, finding the anterior interventricular artery arising from the right-sided coronary artery should alert the surgeon to the possible diagnosis of discordant atrioventricular connections and congenitally corrected transposition. The criss-cross arrangement, perhaps better described as twisted atrioventricular connections<sup>7</sup>, can also be found in the setting of concordant atrioventricular connections, when the morphologically right ventricle will be left-sided (Figures 10.5, 10.6). When the atrioventricular connections are twisted so as to produce the criss-crossing arrangement, usually there is an additional superior-inferior relationship of the ventricles. This is a consequence of the cardiac mass being tilted as well as rotated (Figure 10.7), so that both criss-crossed and superoinferior arrangements are present. Again, the interventricular coronary arteries are useful because they indicate the plane of the ventricular septum, serving as excellent guides to the position of the ventricular cavities. The distribution of the conduction tissue in these bizarre hearts, however, is governed

Fig. 10.4 The cartoon, drawn in anatomical orientation, illustrates the rotational abnormality around the long axis (inset) that produces the socalled criss-cross abnormality. The left-hand panel shows a heart with congenitally corrected transposition in the absence of rotation around the long axis. The morphologically left ventricle is right-sided. Subsequent to rotation (right-hand panel), the morphologically right ventricle occupies a right-sided position, although still connected discordantly to the morphologically left atrium. The arrows in the right-hand panel show the crossing atrioventricular valves, the dotted line depicting the posterior connection to the morphologically left ventricle, which has rotated to a left-sided position.

Fig. 10.5 The reconstructed three-dimensional magnetic resonance image, shown in cross-section, illustrates the twisted atrioventricular connections (arrows) that produce the criss-cross heart. In this patient, there are concordant atrioventricular connections, so the twisting of the ventricular mass places the morphologically right ventricle (Morph. RV) in a left-sided position relative to the morphologically left ventricle (Morph. LV). As shown in Figure 10.6, both arterial trunks arose from the morphologically right ventricle.

Morph. RV Fig. 10.6 The reconstructed three-dimensional magnetic resonance image is from the patient shown in Figure 10.5, but viewed from the right side. The morphologically right ventricle (Morph. RV) is superiorly located relative to the morphologically left ventricle (Morph. LV), but as shown by the black arrows, it retains its right-hand topology despite being left-sided. Both arterial trunks arise from the right ventricle, with the aorta in a leftsided position. The pulmonary trunk has been divided and oversewn, and a conduit placed from the inferior caval vein to the pulmonary arteries so as to create the Fontan circulation.

by the connections between the chambers, and not by their position. These hearts are often further complicated by the presence of straddling and overriding

atrioventricular valves. These abnormal relationships can be found with any combination of atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial connections, with a

double-outlet right ventricle and left-sided aorta being present in the heart shown in Figure 10.6. Even in these rare situations, the topological arrangement of the

Fig. 10.7 The cartoon, drawn in anatomical orientation, shows the tilting along the long axis of the ventricular mass in a heart with congenitally corrected transposition, which usually has side-by-side ventricles (central panel). The tilting produces a superoinferior relationship of the ventricles, almost always in association with twisting of the atrioventricular connections (see Figures 10.4 to 10.6). Depending on the direction of tilting, either the morphologically (Morph.) left ventricle (left-hand panel) or the morphologically right ventricle (right-hand panel) can be positioned uppermost. Most usually it is the right ventricle that assumes the superior location. As shown in Figure 10.6. superoinferior ventricular relationships can also be found when the atrioventricular connections are concordant.

![](_page_4_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Fig. 10.8** In the heart shown in Figure 10.6, the right ventricle with a double outlet showed right-hand topology despite the twisted atrioventricular connections. In this image, the morphologically right ventricle exhibits left-hand topology (black arrows), again with a double outlet from the ventricle. The atrioventricular valve, however, is morphologically tricuspid, and connects the right ventricle to the usually positioned right atrium. Despite the left-hand topology, the atrioventricular connections in this heart are concordant. This is a very rare example of segmental disharmony<sup>5</sup>. Pulm., pulmonary.

ventricular mass is as anticipated for the atrioventricular connections. Thus, when there is rotation of the ventricular mass sufficient to produce crossing of the atrioventricular connections, this does not disturb the intrinsic relationships of the two ventricles<sup>7</sup>. In exceedingly rare

circumstances, however, the ventricles can not only occupy unusual positions, but the topology is not as expected for the existing atrioventricular connections. Hence, when the usual atrial arrangement coexists with concordant atrioventricular connections, the ventricular topology is usually righthanded (Figure 10.6). On occasion, nonetheless, the right atrium can be joined to a morphologically right ventricle that shows left-hand ventricular topology, with the right ventricle being additionally left-sided (Figure 10.8). This situation is one of the rare occasions when it is necessary to

describe ventricular topology in addition to accounting for the atrioventricular connections<sup>5</sup>.

# HEARTS WITH ISOMERIC ATRIAL APPENDAGES

The problems occurring in hearts with isomeric atrial appendages have been mentioned already. Hearts with this arrangement are not only found in unusual positions, but are almost always associated with an abnormal arrangement of the thoracoabdominal organs; hence the popular rubric of visceral heterotaxy. Many will continue to classify these patients in terms of 'asplenia' and 'polysplenia'8. It is of greater value for the surgeon to base any system of categorisation on the morphology of the atrial appendages. Splenic morphology does not always correspond to the atrial anatomy, itself based on the extent of the pectinate muscles relative to the atrial vestibules. There is a greater correspondence between the anatomy of the appendages as thus determined and what is expected of the 'splenic syndromes' than between these syndromes and splenic morphology<sup>9,10</sup>. More important, it is of little consequence to the cardiac surgeon at the time of operation whether his or her

patient has one spleen, multiple spleens, or no spleen at all. Determining the morphology of the appendages brings attention directly to the heart, enabling the surgeon working in the operating room to make the diagnosis of isomerism immediately, even if this had not been predicted by the preoperative studies.

The surgeon can readily distinguish the appendages as being either morphologically right or left (Figure 10.9). The surgeon should always confirm whether the patient possesses lateralised atrial appendages. The finding of isomeric left (Figure 10.10) or right (Figure 10.11) appendages should immediately alert the surgeon to potential problems over and above those anticipated in the patient with the usual or a mirror-imaged atrial arrangement. It is now also possible to distinguish directly the presence of isomeric atrial appendages using computed tomography (Figures 10.12–10.15), while use of other three-dimensional techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging will readily reveal the arrangement of the bronchial tree and the abdominal organs. There should be no problem, therefore, in distinguishing those patients having isomeric right as opposed to isomeric left appendages. In hearts from patients with

isomeric right appendages (Figures 10.16– 10.18), it is the rule to find complex intracardiac anomalies, usually with the absence of the spleen. The pulmonary veins will be connected in a totally anomalous fashion even when they are joined to the heart (Figure 10.19). Most frequently, there are major anomalies of systemic venous drainage. A common atrioventricular valve is usually present (Figures 10.16 - 10.18), often with a double-inlet ventricle (Figure 10.19). Pulmonary stenosis or atresia is frequently found, and there are bilateral sinus nodes. Increasing operative experience now shows that even the most complex combinations can be treated surgically.

Although isomerism of the morphologically right appendages is almost always accompanied by severe intracardiac malformations, this is not necessarily the case when there are isomeric left appendages (Figures 10.20–10.22). Thus, the surgeon is more likely to be confronted with an undiagnosed case in the setting of left isomerism. Therefore, it becomes important to know that the sinus node is in an anomalous position. It is usually hypoplastic. If it can be found, it will be located close to the atrioventricular

Fig. 10.10 This operative view, taken through a median sternotomy, shows that the appendage on the right side of the heart has left morphology. In this patient, the left-sided appendage was also morphologically left, so the patient had isomerism of the morphologically left atrial appendages.

Fig. 10.11 In this patient, the left-sided atrial appendage is broad-based, with a wide junction to the body of the atrium. Note that the left-sided superior caval vein joins to the atrial roof, and that there is a left-sided terminal groove. The right-sided appendage was also of right morphology. The patient has isomerism of the right atrial appendages.

Both appendages (stars) are broad-based (black double-headed arrows), with pectinate muscles extending to the crux (white arrows; see also Figure 10.18). There is obvious isomerism of the right atrial appendages (compare with Figure 10.15).

Fig. 10.15 The computed tomogram in this patient, seen from the front, shows the presence of two narrow appendages (stars) with narrow necks (black double-headed arrows). This patient has isomerism of the morphologically left atrial appendages (compare with Figure 10.14).

junction11–13. Interruption of the inferior caval vein, with return through the azygos venous system, is a frequent accompaniment. In the more severely

affected cases, there may be a common atrioventricular valve14. Pulmonary stenosis or atresia is not usually a feature, nor is the presence of univentricular

atrioventricular connection, but there is frequently aortic coarctation.

Whatever the types of isomerism, when there is a common atrioventricular valve

and each atrium is connected to its own ventricle, it is frequent to find a left-hand pattern of ventricular topology. In this setting, the patient may well have been

diagnosed as having congenitally corrected transposition. The presence of isomeric appendages, however, makes it highly likely that there will be a sling of ventricular conduction tissue joining dual atrioventricular nodes (Figure 10.22, righthand panel)11. This places the entire edge of the ventricular septum at risk should

Fig. 10.22 The cartoon, drawn in anatomical orientation, shows the disposition of the axis of atrioventricular conduction tissue in hearts with isomerism of the atrial appendages, biventricular atrioventricular connections, and a common atrioventricular valve. The arrangement varies depending on whether there is right-hand ventricular topology (lefthand panel), when there is only a posterior connection of the ventricular conduction tissues, or left-hand topology (right-hand panel), when the ventricular conduction tissues are connected by both posterior and anterior atrioventricular nodes, producing a sling of conduction tissue along the crest of the muscular ventricular septum.

surgical correction be attempted. When isomerism of the appendages is found with biventricular atrioventricular connections and a right-hand pattern of ventricular topology, the atrioventricular conduction axis should be expected in its usual posterior position (Figure 10.22, left-hand panel). This entire discussion emphasises the significance of full sequential segmental analysis of any patient presented for cardiac surgery.
