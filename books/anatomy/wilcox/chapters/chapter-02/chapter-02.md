Regardless of the surgical approach, once having entered the mediastinum, the surgeon will be confronted by the heart enclosed in its pericardial sac. In the strict anatomical sense, this sac has two layers, one fibrous and the other serous. From a practical point of view, the pericardium is essentially the tough fibrous layer; the serous component forms the lining of the fibrous sac, and is reflected back onto the surface of the heart as the epicardium. It is the fibrous sac, therefore, which encloses the mass of the heart. By virtue of its own attachments to the diaphragm, it helps

support the heart within the mediastinum. Free-standing around the atrial chambers and the ventricles, the sac becomes adherent to the adventitial coverings of the great arteries and veins at their entrances to and exits from it, these attachments closing the pericardial cavity. The cavity of the pericardium is limited by the two layers of serous pericardium, which are folded on one another to produce a double-layered arrangement. The outer or parietal layer is densely adherent to the fibrous pericardium, while the inner layer is firmly attached to the

myocardium, and is the epicardium (Figure 2.1). The pericardial cavity, therefore, is the space between the inner parietal serous lining of the fibrous pericardium and the surface of the heart (Figure 2.2). There are two recesses within the cavity that are lined by serous pericardium. The first is the transverse sinus, which occupies the inner curvature of the heart (Figure 2.3). Anteriorly, it is bounded by the posterior surface of the great arteries. Posteriorly, it is limited by the right pulmonary artery and the roof of the left atrium. There is a further recess

from the transverse sinus that extends between the superior caval and the right upper pulmonary veins, with its right lateral border being a pericardial fold between these vessels (Figure 2.4). When exposing the mitral valve through a left atriotomy, incisions through this fold, along with mobilisation of the superior

caval vein, provide excellent access to the superior aspect of the left atrium and the right pulmonary artery. This fold is also incised when a snare is placed around the superior caval vein. Laterally, on each side, the ends of the transverse sinus are in free communication with the remainder of the pericardial cavity.

The second pericardial recess is the oblique sinus. This is a blind-ending cavity behind the left atrium (Figure 2.5), with its upper boundary formed by the reflection of serous pericardium between the upper pulmonary veins. The right border is the reflection of pericardium around the right pulmonary veins and the inferior caval

vein, while the left border is the reflection of pericardium around the left pulmonary veins (Figure 2.6).

With the usual surgical approach through a median sternotomy, the fibrous pericardium is opened more-or-less in the midline and retracted laterally, exposing the anterior sternocostal surface of the heart and great vessels. The pulmonary trunk and aorta are seen leaving the base of the heart and extending in a superior direction, with the aortic root in the posterior and rightward position (Figure 2.2). Should the aortic root not be in this expected relationship, the ventriculoarterial connections will almost always be abnormal (see Chapter 8). The atrial appendages are usually seen one to either side of the

prominent arterial pedicle. The morphologically right appendage is more prominent. It has a blunt triangular shape, and possesses a broad junction with the atrial cavity (Figure 2.7). The morphologically left appendage may not be seen immediately. When found at the left border of the pulmonary trunk, it is a tubular structure, having a narrow junction with the rest of the atrium (Figure 2.8). The presence of the two appendages on the same side of the arterial pedicle is an anomaly in itself, which is called juxtaposition. This arrangement is most often associated with additional malformations within the heart (see Chapter 8). Inspection of the left border of the heart should always include a search for persistence of the left superior caval vein. When present, the venous channel will be found by following the course of the left pulmonary artery. The vein crosses anterior to the pulmonary artery and is seen superiorly within the pericardial cavity, with the left atrial appendage located anteriorly and laterally (Figure 2.9). Within the pericardial cavity, it extends down the posterior aspect of the left atrium, passing through the inferior left atrioventricular groove to reach the right atrial orifice of the coronary sinus (Figure 2.10).

The ventricular mass extends from the atrioventricular grooves to the apex, and

usually extends into the left hemithorax. An anomalous position of the ventricular mass, or its apex, is again highly suggestive of the presence of congenital cardiac

malformations (see Chapter 10). In shape, the ventricular mass is a three-sided pyramid, having inferior diaphragmatic, anterior sternocostal, and posterior

pulmonary surfaces (Figure 2.11). The margin between the first two surfaces is sharp. Because of this, it is described as the acute margin. The angulations of the

**Fig. 2.11** The heart has been removed from the chest and is viewed from its apex, showing the surfaces of the ventricular cone.

margins between the pulmonary and the sternocostal surfaces anteriorly, and the pulmonary and diaphragmatic surfaces posteriorly, are much more obtuse. The surgeon encounters these obtuse marginal areas when the apex of the heart is tipped out of the pericardium. They are supplied by the obtuse marginal branches of the circumflex coronary artery. The greater part of the anterior surface of the ventricular mass is occupied by the morphologically right ventricle, with its left border marked by the anterior interventricular or descending branch of the left coronary artery. This artery curves onto the ventricular surface between the left atrial appendage and the basal origin of the pulmonary trunk. The right border of the morphologically right ventricle is marked by the right coronary artery, which runs obliquely in the atrioventricular groove. Unusually prominent coronary arteries coursing on the ventricular surface should always raise the suspicion of significant cardiac malformations.

The surface anatomy of the heart is helpful in determining the most appropriate site for an incision to gain access to a given cardiac chamber. For example, the relatively bloodless outlet portion of the right ventricle just beneath the origin of the pulmonary trunk affords ready access to the cavity of the subpulmonary infundibulum (Figure 2.8). The important landmark for

the right atrium is the terminal groove, or sulcus terminalis. This marks the junction between the appendage and the systemic venous component of the right atrium (Figure 2.12). The sinus node is located within this groove, usually laterally and inferiorly relative to the superior cavoatrial junction (Figures 2.13, 2.14), but occasionally extending over the crest of the appendage (Figure 2.15). The clinically significant artery to the sinus node can also be seen on occasion, either as it crosses the crest of the right appendage, or as it courses behind the superior caval vein to enter the terminal groove between the orifices of the caval veins. Posterior to, and parallel with, the terminal groove is a second, deeper groove, which interposes between the cavity of the right atrium and the right pulmonary veins. The surgeon can use this interatrial groove, known as Waterston's or Sondergaard's groove, to gain access to the left atrium (Figure 2.16), either by making an incision in the floor of the groove, or through the left atrial roof. The latter area is seen behind the aorta, to the left of the superior cavoatrial junction (Figure 2.12).

# MORPHOLOGICALLY RIGHT ATRIUM

The right atrium has three basic parts, the appendage, the venous component receiving the systemic venous return, and

the vestibule of the tricuspid valve. It also has a small body, but the boundaries of this part usually cannot be distinguished from the venous sinus. It is separated from the left atrium by the septum. The junction of the appendage and the systemic venous sinus is identified externally by the prominent terminal groove (Figure 2.12). Internally, the groove corresponds with the terminal crest, which gives origin to the pectinate muscles of the appendage (Figure 2.17). In shape, the appendage is blunt and triangular, having a wide junction to the venous sinus across the terminal groove. The venous sinus is much smaller when viewed externally, with only that part extending between the terminal and Waterston's grooves being visible to the surgeon. It receives the superior and inferior caval veins at its extremities. Superiorly and anteriorly, the appendage has a particularly important relation with the superior caval vein. Here, the appendage terminates in a prominent crest (Figure 2.13). This forms the summit of the terminal groove, and is continuous in the transverse sinus behind the aorta with the interatrial groove (Figure 2.14). Absence of such a right-sided crest should alert the surgeon to the presence of isomerism of the left atrial appendages (see Chapter 6). As already discussed, the sinus node almost always lies immediately subepicardially within the terminal groove.

Cigar-shaped, it usually lies to the right of the crest as seen by the surgeon; in other words, lateral and inferior to the superior cavoatrial junction (Figure 2.13). In about

one-tenth of cases, the node extends across the crest into the interatrial groove. It is then draped across the cavoatrial junction in horseshoe fashion (Figures 2.14, 2.15)<sup>1</sup> .

Also of significance is the course of the artery to the sinus node (Figure 2.18). This artery is a branch of the right coronary artery in about 55% of individuals, and a

![](_page_7_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 2.14** Operative view through a median sternotomy demonstrating the usual site of the sinus node. The node can often be seen as a pale cigar-shaped area located anterolaterally in the terminal groove. This anticipated site is highlighted in the photograph by the white cross-hatched area.

branch of the circumflex artery in the remainder<sup>2</sup>. Irrespective of its origin, it usually courses through the anterior interatrial groove towards the superior cavoatrial junction (Figure 2.19), frequently running within the atrial myocardium. The artery usually takes its origin from the proximal segment of its parent coronary artery (Figure 2.20). A significant variant is found when the artery

originates from either coronary artery some distance from the aorta. If taking origin from the right coronary artery, it courses over the lateral surface of the appendage to reach the terminal groove (Figure 2.21). If originating from the circumflex artery, it crosses the roof of the left atrium (Figure 2.22). Such lateral origin is rare in normal hearts<sup>3,4</sup>, but more frequent in association with congenital malformations<sup>5</sup>.

Irrespective of its origin, as it enters the sinus node, the artery may cross the crest of the appendage, course retrocavally (Figure 2.23), or even divide to form an arterial circle around the junction (Figure 2.24). All these variations should be taken into account when planning the safest right atrial incision, particularly when the nodal artery crosses the lateral margin of the right appendage, or courses

over the roof of the left atrium. Although it might seem obvious, care should be taken to ensure that the incision cuts across neither the terminal crest nor the right coronary artery (Figure 2.25).

Opening the atrium through the most appropriate incision shows that the terminal groove is the external counterpart of a prominent internal muscle bundle, the terminal crest. This separates the pectinate muscles of the appendage from the smooth walls of the systemic venous sinus (Figure 2.17). The cardiomyocytes are aligned along the long axis of the crest, which is one of the major routes for conduction from the sinus node towards the atrioventricular node. Anteriorly, the crest curves in front of the orifice of the superior caval vein, with its medial extension forming the border between the

appendage and the superior rim of the oval fossa. The crest continues through the superior interatrial groove as Bachmann's bundle, the major route for conduction into the left atrium. On first sight, when inspecting the right atrium through this incision, there appears to be an extensive septal surface between the openings of the caval veins and the orifice of the tricuspid valve (Figure 2.26). The apparent extent of

The right-hand panels show a proximal origin from the circumflex artery, found in around 45% of the population, with the rare variant of a distal origin with coursing across the dome of the left atrium. The middle panels show the variation relative to the superior cavoatrial junction. The sinus node is shown in green.

this septum is spurious<sup>6,7</sup>. The true septum<sup>7,8</sup> is confined to the floor and the anteroinferior margin of the oval fossa (Figures 2.27 and 2.28). The extensive superior rim of the fossa is produced by the folds of the interatrial groove, which

separate the mouth of the superior caval vein and the entrance of the pulmonary veins to the left atrium (Figures 2.28). The posteroinferior rim is another fold, this time formed by reflection of the musculature forming the mouth of the

coronary sinus and the orifice of the inferior caval vein (Figure 2.29). These muscular structures continue anteriorly within the atrium as the Eustachian ridge. This is seen to advantage when the floor of the oval fossa is itself deficient

(Figure 2.30). Because of the limited extent of these septal components, it is an easy matter for the surgeon to pass outside the heart when attempting to gain access to the left atrium through a right atrial approach.

In addition to the position of the sinus node, and the extent of the atrial septum, the other major area of surgical significance within the right atrium is the site of the atrioventricular node. This is contained within the triangle of Koch<sup>9</sup>. This important landmark is bounded by the tendon of Todaro, the attachment of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve, and the orifice of the coronary sinus (Figure 2.31). The tendon of Todaro<sup>9</sup> is a fibrous

structure formed by the junction of the Eustachian valve, the valve of the inferior caval vein, and the Thebesian valve, the valve of the coronary sinus. The fibrous continuation of these two valvar structures buries itself in the anterior continuation of the Eustachian ridge. It then runs medially as the tendon of Todaro before inserting

into the atrioventricular part of the membranous septum (Figure 2.32). The entire atrial component of the axis of atrioventricular conduction tissues is contained within the confines of the triangle of Koch. If, in hearts with normal segmental connections, this area is

scrupulously avoided during surgical procedures, the atrioventricular conduction tissues will not be damaged. Should the node need to be identified more precisely, it should be remembered that the attachment of the tricuspid valve is some way down the surface of the septum relative

to that of the mitral valve (Figure 2.33). The relationship between the atrial and ventricular muscular walls within the triangle of Koch is complex. At first sight, because of the off-setting of the attachments of the mitral and tricuspid valves, the entire muscular area seems to

interpose between the cavities of the right atrium and the left ventricle. Indeed, in earliest editions of the book, we described this area as representing an atrioventricular muscular septum. In the floor of the triangle, however, the atrial musculature is separated from the underlying ventricular myocardium by an extension of the inferior atrioventricular groove, with the fibrofatty tissue in this area insulating the atrial from the ventricular muscular layers<sup>10</sup> . The extent of this insulating layer can be

demonstrated by dissecting away the superficial atrial musculature, at the same time revealing the location of the artery supplying the atrioventricular node (Figure 2.34). The larger part of Koch's triangle as seen by the surgeon, therefore, is

formed by the atrial layer of an atrioventricular muscular sandwich, rather than a true muscular atrioventricular septum.

Much was written in the latter part of the twentieth century concerning the role of allegedly specialised pathways of myocardium in conducting the sinus impulse to the atrioventricular node<sup>11,12</sup>. Molecular biologists are currently showing that, during development, it is possible to recognise areas of the atrial myocardium on

the basis of their genetic lineage. Subsequent to birth, however, all of the atrial myocardium, apart from the nodal components, has achieved a working phenotype. There is no anatomical evidence, therefore, to support suggestions that surgical operations should be specially modified to avoid presumed specialised internodal tracts<sup>13</sup>. The anatomical paradigm of tracts of myocardium modified for conduction in the heart is provided by the ventricular conduction system, which is

additionally insulated from the adjacent working ventricular myocardium<sup>14</sup>. There are no such insulated and isolated tracts within the atrial walls<sup>15,16</sup>. The major muscle bundles of the atrial chambers, nonetheless, serve as preferential pathways

of conduction, with the location of these preferential pathways dictated by the overall geometry of the chambers (Figure 2.35). Ideally, therefore, prominent muscle bundles, such as the terminal crest, the superior rim of the oval fossa, the

myocardium of the Eustachian ridge, and the superior interatrial fold, should be preserved during atrial surgery. Even if they cannot be preserved, the surgeon can rest assured that internodal conduction will continue as long as some strand of viable

atrial myocardium interposes between the nodes, providing that the arterial supply to the nodes, or the nodes themselves, are not traumatised. The key to avoiding postoperative atrial arrhythmias, therefore, is the fastidious preservation of the sinus

and atrioventricular nodes and their arteries, rather than concern about nonexistent tracts of purportedly specialised atrial myocardium. Much is also written about the fibrous skeleton of the heart. The strongest part of this skeleton is the central fibrous body. This area of fibrous tissue touches on three of the four cardiac chambers, but is seen most clearly by the surgeon when working from the right atrium (Figure 2.36). Rather than being considered as a specific body, it

Its extent is best seen from the left side, albeit that this aspect is rarely, if ever, seen by the surgeon (Figure 2.38).

as the right fibrous trigone, joins with the membranous septum to form the basis of the fibrous body (Figure 2.39). This view also emphasises the intimate relationship of the fibrous body to many other important structures within the heart, particularly the

fibrous triangle between the hinges of the right and non-coronary leaflets of the aortic valve. The central fibrous body, therefore, serves as an anatomical focal point for the cardiac surgeon. Operations involving valvar replacement or repair, closure of septal defects, and control of arrhythmias require the surgeon to understand its anatomical relationships implicitly, from both the obvious right (Figure 2.36), and also the usually invisible left (Figure 2.38) sides. Knowledge of the location of the

**Fig. 2.40** This operative view through a right atriotomy, seen in surgical orientation, shows the vestibule of the right atrium and the three leaflets of the tricuspid valve.

atrioventricular component of the membranous septum is also the key to understanding the occurrence of the so-called Gerbode septal defect<sup>17</sup>, which produces a direct shunt from the left ventricular outflow tract to the right atrium (see Figure 2.37).

The final atrial component, the vestibule to the right ventricle, surrounds the orifice of the tricuspid valve, and is contiguous with both the systemic venous component and the appendage of the right atrium. The anterior junction of these two parts of the atrium overlies the peripheral attachment of the anteroseptal commissure of the tricuspid valve and the supraventricular crest of the right ventricle (Figure 2.40). The posterior junction is at the orifice of the coronary sinus, where there is usually an extensive inferior trabeculated diverticulum. Although usually called the post-Eustachian sinus, it is sub-Thebesian when the heart is viewed relative to the anatomical position (Figure 2.35).

## MORPHOLOGICALLY LEFT ATRIUM

As with the right atrium, the left atrium possesses an appendage, an extensive venous component, and a vestibule. Unlike the situation with the right atrium, it is also

possible to recognise the extensive body of the left atrium (Figure 2.41). The chamber, of course, is separated from its neighbour by the septum. The body of the atrium is confluent with the venous component. Unlike in the right atrium, the narrow junction between these parts and the appendage is unmarked by either a terminal groove or crest (Figure 2.41). Because of the posterior position of the left atrium, and its firm anchorage by the four pulmonary veins, it can be difficult for the surgeon to gain direct access to the left atrium, so knowledge of the salient anatomy can help best exposure of the cavity. Probably the most popular route is provided by an incision made just posterior to the right lateral aspect of the interatrial groove (Figure 2.42). This groove, the extensive infolding between the right pulmonary veins and the venous sinus of the right atrium, produces the superior rim of the oval fossa (Figure 2.28). A posteriorly directed incision within this groove takes the surgeon directly into the left atrium. If necessary, the incision can be extended to the superior aspect of the left atrium by incising the pericardial fold between the superior caval vein and the right pulmonary artery (Figure 2.4). Because the infolding of the interatrial groove also forms the superior border of the oval fossa,

much the same access can be gained by approaching through the right atrium, and incising just superiorly within the fossa. It must be remembered that an extensive incision may take the surgeon out of the confines of the atrial chambers and into the pericardial space. Perhaps more importantly, it should be noted that such an incision may damage the artery to the sinus node, either in the interatrial groove or on the roof of the left atrium. The left atrium can also be entered superiorly by incising directly through its roof. If the aorta is pulled anteriorly and to the left, an extensive trough is seen between the two atrial appendages (Figure 2.43), with an incision through the floor of this trough entering the left atrium directly. When making such an incision, it must again be remembered that the artery to the sinus node may be coursing through this area when it takes origin from the circumflex artery (Figure 2.43). In other instances, this artery may pass through the infolding of the interatrial groove to reach the terminal groove.

Once access is gained to the left atrium, the small size of the opening of the appendage is apparent (Figure 2.44). The mouth of the appendage lies to the left of the mitral orifice as viewed by the surgeon. Anatomically, it is positioned above the superior end of the zone of apposition

between the valvar leaflets. The greater part of the pulmonary venous sinus, confluent with the smooth-walled atrial body, will usually be located inferiorly, away from the operative field. It is the vestibule of the mitral orifice that dominates the picture (Figure 2.45). The septal aspect will be anterior, exhibiting the typically roughened flap—valve aspect of its left side (Figure 2.46). The large sweep of tissue between the flap valve of the septum and the opening of the appendage is the internal aspect of the deep anterior interatrial groove.

## MORPHOLOGICALLY RIGHT VENTRICLE

The musculature of the right ventricle extends from the atrioventricular to the ventriculoarterial junctions.

Understanding of ventricular morphology

Fig. 2.44 The left atrium is photographed from behind to show the relations of the mouth of the left atrial appendage. All components of the atrial chamber can be seen. Note the isthmus formed by the vestibular myocardium, and the extensive fold between the mouth of the appendage and the origin of the left pulmonary veins from the pulmonary venous component (star).

in general is greatly aided by considering the ventricles in terms of three components17. These are the inlet, apical trabecular, and outlet parts, respectively

(Figure 2.47). The inlet portion of the right ventricle contains, and is limited by, the tricuspid valve and its tension apparatus. Although not always easy, it is generally

possible to distinguish three leaflets in the valvar orifice. They lie in anterosuperior, septal, and inferior or mural locations (Figures 2.48, 2.49). When seen in the

closed position, their boundaries are clearly marked by their zones of apposition, which extend to the centre of the valvar orifice. The entirety of the zones of apposition could, logically, be defined as the commissures. It is the peripheral parts of the zones of apposition that are usually described as the commissures18, albeit that in the atrioventricular valves these areas do not abut directly on the valvar annulus. The zones of apposition between the leaflets in these commissural areas are usually tethered by fan-shaped cords arising atop prominent papillary muscles. We discuss the details of this valvar and commissural anatomy in our next chapter. In anatomical terms, the most constant distinguishing morphological feature of the tricuspid valve is the direct attachments to the septum of the cords tethering its septal leaflet (Figure 2.49).

The trabecular component of the right ventricle extends to the apex, where its wall is particularly thin, being especially vulnerable to perforation by cardiac catheters and pacemaker electrodes. When compared to those of the left ventricle, the

right ventricular apical trabeculations are uniformly coarse. The outlet component of the right ventricle is a complete muscular sleeve, the infundibulum, which extends from the ventricular base to support the leaflets of the pulmonary valve. The leaflets of the valve are attached to the infundibular musculature in semilunar fashion. These hinges cross the circular anatomical ventriculoarterial junction so as to incorporate triangles of arterial wall within the ventricle, and crescents of ventricular

muscle in the bases of the pulmonary valvar sinuses (Figure 2.50). Another distinguishing morphological feature of the right ventricle is the prominent muscular shelf that interposes between the tricuspid and pulmonary valvar orifices.

Fig. 2.50 In this heart, shown in anatomical orientation, the leaflets of the pulmonary valve have been removed. Note how the semilunar attachment of the pulmonary valvar leaflets crosses the anatomical ventriculoarterial junction, the dotted lines and crosshatchings emphasising the crescents of ventricular muscle incorporated in the valvar sinus and the triangles of arterial wall within the ventricle.

This is the supraventricular crest. At first sight (Figure 2.51), it has the appearance of a thick muscle bundle, but its larger part is no more than the infolded inner heart curve (Figure 2.52). Incisions, or deep sutures, through this part run into the transverse sinus and right atrioventricular groove, and can jeopardise the right coronary artery19. Only a small portion of

the most medial part of the crest can be removed so as to create a hole between the subpulmonary and subaortic outflow tracts (Figure 2.52). This part is a true muscular outlet septum, but cannot be distinguished from the remainder of the crest by gross inspection (Figure 2.51). The crest continues distally as the freestanding infundular muscular sleeve

(Figure 2.53). It is the presence of this sleeve that permits the valve itself to be removed as an autograft for use in the Ross procedure (Figures 2.54, 2.55). Considered as a whole, the supraventricular crest inserts between the limbs of an equally prominent and important right ventricular septal trabeculation. This structure, described

Fig. 2.51 In this anatomical specimen, viewed in surgical orientation, the prominent muscular supraventricular crest is seen between the leaflets of the tricuspid and pulmonary valves. Note the medial papillary muscle arising from the septomarginal trabeculation.

Fig. 2.52 Dissection of the specimen shown in Figure 2.43 shows here that most of the supraventricular crest is the inner curvature of the heart, or the ventriculoinfundibular fold. Note the location of the right coronary artery. The site occupied by the outlet septum has been resected.

by us as the septomarginal trabeculation, but also known as the septal band, has anterosuperior and posteroinferior limbs that clasp the septal attachment of the crest (Figure 2.56). The anterosuperior

limb runs up to the attachment of the leaflets of the pulmonary valve, while the posteroinferior limb extends backwards, extending inferior to the interventricular component of the membranous septum,

and reinforcing the muscular septum. The medial papillary muscle usually arises from this posteroinferior limb. The body of the septomarginal trabeculation itself extends towards the apex of the ventricle,

breaking up into a sheath of smaller trabeculations. Some of these mingle into the apical trabecular portion, and some support the tension apparatus of the tricuspid valve. Several of these trabeculations are often particularly

prominent. One becomes the anterior papillary muscle, while another extends from the septomarginal trabeculation to the anterior papillary muscle, being termed the moderator band. Additional significant right ventricular trabeculations arise from the anterior margin of the septomarginal trabeculation. Variable in number, these are the septoparietal trabeculations (Figure 2.56).

It is the uniformly coarse apical trabeculations that, for the morphologist,

Fig. 2.55 In the heart shown in Figure 2.54, again viewed from above and from the right, the pulmonary infundibulum has been removed from the base of the heart, revealing the free-standing myocardial sleeve that 'lifts' the valvar leaflets away from the left ventricle. Note the site of the first septal perforating artery.

serve as the most constant anatomical feature of the morphologically right ventricle. Taken overall, there are a number of morphological differences between the ventricles that permit their distinction. These include the arrangement of the leaflets of the atrioventricular valves and their tension apparatus, the ventricular shape, the thickness of the ventricular walls, and the configuration of the outflow

tracts. These features, however, can be altered or lacking in the congenitally abnormal heart. In final arbitration of ventricular morphology, therefore, the morphologist relies on the contrast, in the same heart, between the coarse trabeculations of the right ventricle, and the much finer trabeculations seen in the apical part of the left ventricle (Figure 2.57).

### MORPHOLOGICALLY LEFT VENTRICLE

As with the right ventricle, the musculature of the left ventricle extends from the atrioventricular to the ventriculoarterial junctions. It is again conveniently considered in terms of inlet, apical trabecular, and outlet components (Figure 2.58). In the left ventricle, there is

![](_page_30_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 2.59** This specimen, viewed from behind, and opened through a cut in the left atrioventricular junction adjacent to the septum, demonstrates the marked differences in the arrangement of the aortic and mural leaflets of the mitral valve.

![](_page_30_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Fig. 2.60** This specimen, viewed from behind after the parietal wall of the left ventricle has been removed, is dissected to show the adjacency of the anteroinferior and posterosuperior papillary muscles of the mitral valve.

marked overlapping of the inlet and outlet components. The inlet component surrounds, and is limited by, the mitral valve and its tension apparatus. Its two leaflets, supported by two prominent papillary muscles and their tendinous cords, have widely differing appearances (Figure 2.59). The anterosuperior leaflet is short, squat, and relatively square. This leaflet, in fibrous continuity with the aortic valve, is best termed the aortic leaflet. The other leaflet is narrower, and its junctional attachment more extensive, being supported by the parietal part of the left

atrioventricular junction. Positioned posteroinferiorly, it is accurately termed the mural leaflet. Because the aortic leaflet of the mitral valve forms part of the outlet of the left ventricle, the boundary between the inlet and outlet is somewhat blurred. The papillary muscles of the valve, located in anteroinferior and posterosuperior positions, are close to each other at their origin (Figure 2.60). It is incorrect to describe the muscles as being anteroseptal and posterolateral, these terms reflecting the bad habit of morphologists of removing the heart from the body and describing it as

positioned on its apex<sup>20</sup>. Unlike the tricuspid valve, the leaflets of the mitral valve have no direct septal attachments, because the deep posteroinferior diverticulum of the subaortic outflow tract displaces the aortic leaflet of the valve away from the muscular ventricular septum (Figure 2.61). The trabecular component of the left ventricle extends to the ventricular apex and has characteristically fine trabeculations (Figure 2.57). As in the right ventricle, the myocardium is surprisingly thin at the apex. This feature is important to the cardiac surgeon, who may

have reason to place catheters and electrodes in the right ventricle, or drainage tubes in the left side. Immediate perforation, or delayed rupture, may occur. This may be a particular problem should catheters stiffened by hypothermia be pushed against the apical endocardium as the heart is manipulated during surgery on the coronary arteries<sup>21</sup>.

The outlet component of the left ventricle supports the aortic valve. Unlike its right ventricular counterpart, it is not a complete muscular structure. The septal wall is composed largely of muscle, but in this area the membranous septum is found, forming part of the central fibrous body in the subaortic outflow tract (Figure 2.39). The posterolateral portion of the outflow tract is composed exclusively of fibrous tissue, namely the fibrous curtain joining the leaflets of the aortic valve to the aortic leaflet of the mitral valve. The left lateral quadrant, continuing around to the septum, is a muscular structure representing the lateral margin of the inner heart curvature, and separating the cavity of the left ventricle from the transverse sinus. The muscular septal surface of the outflow tract is characteristically smooth, with the fan-like left bundle branch cascading down from the septal crest. The

landmark of its descent is the membranous septum immediately beneath the zone of apposition between right coronary and non-coronary leaflets of the aortic valve (Figure 2.62). The bundle descends, initially, as a relatively narrow solitary fascicle, but soon divides into three interconnected fascicles that radiate into anterior, septal, and posterior divisions. The interconnecting radiations do not fan out to any degree until the bundle itself has descended to between one-third and onehalf the length of the septum. As with the pulmonary valve, the leaflets of the aortic valve are not attached in circular fashion to a supporting ring of fibrocollagenous tissue. Instead, the leaflets are attached in semilunar fashion, with the hinge lines crossing the anatomical ventriculoaortic junction (Figure 2.63). This arrangement again means that crescents of ventricular muscle are incorporated into the bases of two of the aortic sinuses, while three triangles of fibrous tissue are created beneath the sinutubular junction<sup>22</sup>.

#### **THE AORTA**

The ascending aorta begins at the distal extremity of the three aortic sinuses, the sinutubular junction, which lies at the line of opening of the free edge of the leaflets of the aortic valve (Figure 2.64). The ascending aortic trunk runs its short course, passing superiorly, and obliquely to the right, and slightly forwards, towards the sternum. It is contained within the fibrous pericardial sac, so its surface is covered with serous pericardium. Its anterior surface abuts directly on the pulmonary trunk, which is also covered with serous pericardium. The two vessels together make up the vascular pedicle of the heart (Figure 2.65). The ascending aorta is related anteromedially to the right atrial appendage, and posterolaterally to the right ventricular outflow tract and the pulmonary trunk. Extrapericardially, the thymus gland lies between it and the sternum. The medial wall of the right atrium, the superior caval vein, and the right pleura relate to its right side. On the left, its principal relationship is with the pulmonary trunk. Posterior to the ascending aorta lies the transverse sinus of the pericardium (Figure 2.3), which separates it from the roof of the left atrium and the right pulmonary artery. The arch of the aorta begins at the superior attachment of the pericardial reflection just proximal to the origin of the brachiocephalic artery. It continues

Fig. 2.62 This specimen, orientated in the anatomical position, demonstrates the relationship of the zone of apposition between the right and non-coronary leaflets to the membranous septum and the interleaflet triangle between the right coronary and noncoronary leaflets of the aortic valve.

Fig. 2.63 This dissection demonstrates that, as in the pulmonary valve (see Figure 2.50), the attachments of the leaflets of the aortic valve (black dotted line) cross the anatomical ventriculoarterial junction (black dashed line), incorporating crescents of ventricular tissue into the arterial valvar sinuses, and triangles of arterial tissue into the ventricular base.

superiorly for a short distance, before coursing posteriorly and to the left, crossing the lateral aspect of the distal trachea, and finally terminating on the lateral aspect of the vertebral column. Here, it is tethered by the parietal pleura and the arterial ligament. During its course, it gives off the brachiocephalic, the left common carotid, and the left subclavian arteries (Figure 2.66). Bronchial arteries arise from the underside of the arch (Figure 2.67). They can be particularly troublesome

if not carefully identified in the presence of aortic coarctation. The left phrenic and vagus nerves run over the anterolateral aspect of the arch just beneath the mediastinal pleura. The left recurrent laryngeal nerve takes origin from the vagus. It curls superiorly around the arterial ligament before passing on to the posteromedial side of the arch. Here, the arch relates to the tracheal bifurcation and oesophagus on its medial border, but also to the left main bronchus and the left pulmonary artery inferiorly.

The descending or thoracic aorta continues from the arch, running an initial course lateral to the vertebral bodies, and reaching an anterior position at its termination. It gives off many branches to the organs of the thorax throughout its course, as well as the prominent lower nine pairs of intercostal arteries. These latter vessels are of critical concern for the cardiac surgeon (see Chapter 9). In coarctation of the aorta, they serve as primary collateral vessels to bypass the obstructed aorta, accounting for the rib notching seen in

older children with this lesion. These vessels, and their branches to the chest wall, can be a source of troublesome bleeding if not properly secured when operating on such patients. The surgeon must also remember that the dorsal branches of the intercostal vessels contribute a spinal branch that is important in supplying blood to the spinal cord.

Because it is difficult to predict exactly the site of origin of these vital branches, the surgeon must make every attempt to protect their origin from permanent occlusion. The important bronchial arteries (Figure 2.67) also arise from the descending segment of the thoracic aorta. These vessels can become dilated in the presence of pulmonary atresia, when

they serve as a source of pulmonary vascular supply.

### THE PULMONARY ARTERIES

The pulmonary trunk is a short vessel, usually less than five centimetres in length in the adult (Figure 2.68). It is completely contained within the pericardium

(Figure 2.69) and, similar to its running mate, the ascending aorta, it is covered with a layer of serous pericardium except where the two vessels abut each other in the

vascular pedicle. It takes origin from the most anterior aspect of the heart, lying just behind the lateral edge of the sternum and the second left intercostal space. Initially,

the pulmonary trunk overlies the aorta and left coronary artery, but it soon moves to a side-by-side relationship with the ascending aorta. The left coronary artery

turns abruptly anteriorly to lie between the left atrial appendage and the pulmonary trunk. The arterial ligament extends from the aorta to the very end of the pulmonary trunk as the latter divides into left and right pulmonary arteries. The left pulmonary artery then courses laterally in front of the

descending aorta and the left main-stem bronchus before it sends branches to the hilum of the lung. Posteroinferiorly, the left pulmonary artery is connected to the left superior pulmonary vein by a fold of serous pericardium that contains a ligamentous remnant of the left superior

caval vein, the ligament of Marshall (Figure 2.69). The right pulmonary artery is somewhat longer than the left, having to traverse the mediastinum beneath the aortic arch, and then behind the superior caval vein, to reach the hilum of the lung (Figure 2.70). It lies in a posteroinferior

position relative to the azygos vein, and is anterior to the left main bronchus. The right pulmonary artery often branches before reaching the lateral wall of the superior caval vein posterior to the transverse sinus of the pericardium. In this situation, a large upper lobar branch may be mistaken for the right pulmonary artery itself.
