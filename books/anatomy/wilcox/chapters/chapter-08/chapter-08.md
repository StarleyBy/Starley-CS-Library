In the previous chapter, we paid attention to those hearts in which the associated cardiac malformation existed in the setting of normal connections between the cardiac segments. All those associated lesions, of course, can also be found in hearts with abnormal segmental connections. It is these abnormal connections that will be our focus in this chapter, emphasising the associated anomalies that are particularly frequent with a given abnormal segmental arrangement. We conclude the chapter with a brief discussion of those hearts in which the relationships of the arterial trunks are abnormal in the setting of concordant ventriculoarterial connections, as these combinations still produce problems in understanding and description.

## DOUBLE-INLET VENTRICLE

Over the years, hearts with a double-inlet ventricle have represented one of the greater challenges to surgical correction. They have also posed significant problems in adequate description and categorisation. Even these days, many continue to describe the lesions in terms of single ventricles, or univentricular hearts, despite the fact that almost all patients with a double-inlet atrioventricular connection have two chambers within their ventricular mass, one being large and the other small1–<sup>3</sup> . The semantic problems with description can now be resolved by the simple expedient of describing functionally univentricular hearts<sup>4</sup> , this approach also accounting for the other lesions dominated by ventricular imbalance. At this point, we describe the relevant anatomical characteristics of all those hearts unified by the presence of the double-inlet atrioventricular connection, irrespective of whether they contain one or two ventricles, although almost all do have one big and one small ventricle. The previous problems with description centred on whether the small chamber in hearts with ventricular imbalance deserved ventricular status. We now describe all chambers possessing characteristic apical components as ventricles, recognising them as being complete or incomplete depending on their component make-up. This form of analysis greatly simplifies the description of the communications

between dominant and incomplete ventricles, which are no more and no less than ventricular septal defects.

In basic terms, hearts exhibit a doubleinlet atrioventricular connection whenever the greater parts of both atrioventricular junctions, which belong to the right-sided and left-sided atrial chambers, are connected to the same ventricle. This definition holds good irrespective of whether the connections are guarded by two separate atrioventricular valves, as is usually the case (Figure 8.1), or by a common valve (Figure 8.2). The doubleinlet connection can also be found in the presence of overriding and straddling atrioventricular valves, but only when the degree of overriding is such as to leave the greater part of both junctions connected to the same ventricle, again either through two valves (Figure 8.3) or a common valve. When there is a straddling common valve, it becomes moot as to whether the hearts should also be considered as possessing atrioventricular septal defects with gross ventricular imbalance. In all these instances, it is the precise atrioventricular connections that determine the surgical

Fig. 8.1 This specimen, prepared by slicing the heart in four-chamber projection,shows the essence of the double-inlet atrioventricular connection. Note that the cavity of only one ventricle is visible. It possesses fine crisscrossing apical trabeculations, identifying it as a dominant left ventricle. There is a second ventricle, albeit incomplete because it lacks its inlet component, positioned anterosuperiorly, and thus is not sectioned in this cut. In this heart, both atrioventricular junctions (black braces) are connected to the dominant ventricle through separate atrioventricular valves.

Fig. 8.2 This specimen is also prepared by making a section in the fourchamber plane. It shows a double inlet to a dominant right ventricle, as both atrioventricular junctions (white braces) drain to the dominant ventricular chamber (compare with Figure 8.1). Note, however, that there is a common atrioventricular valve (white double-headed arrow). The section also demonstrates the incomplete left ventricle, which lacks its inlet component.

.

approach. Whenever patients are found with a double-inlet connection as defined here, their hearts will perforce be functionally univentricular. The chosen

surgical therapeutic option will, almost certainly, be to create the Fontan circulation although, rarely, it can be possible to septate the dominant ventricle<sup>5</sup>

It will be exceedingly rare for patients to be encountered with a truly solitary ventricle. Most usually, there will be two ventricles in the setting of a double-inlet, one being

dominant and the other incomplete, the smaller ventricle lacking at least the greater part of its inlet component<sup>4</sup>.

Although the surgical options are the same for all patients with the double-inlet atrioventricular connection<sup>5</sup>, the hearts themselves can show marked anatomical variation. They can exist with any arrangement of the atrial chambers, with one of three ventricular morphologies, with the variations in valvar morphology discussed above, with any ventriculoarterial connection, and with varied associated malformations<sup>6</sup>. From the anatomical stance, and probably from the stance of long-term follow-up, the most important differentiating feature is the morphology of the dominant ventricle. There are three possibilities<sup>7</sup>. The first, and most common, is the arrangement in which the atrial chambers are connected to a dominant left ventricle in the presence of an incomplete right ventricle. The second group comprises those with a dominant right and an incomplete left ventricle. The final small set is made up of those patients having a solitary ventricle of indeterminate morphology. These three variants must be distinguished from other hearts that, in essence, represent huge ventricular septal defects.

A potential means of correcting these hearts with a double inlet surgically is to

septate the dominant or solitary ventricle<sup>5</sup>. The overall morphological arrangement, however, usually conspires to defeat this option. The most frequent surgical tactic, therefore, is to use the Fontan procedure or one of its modifications<sup>8–10</sup>. We will concentrate, therefore, on those anatomical features influencing the Fontan procedure, although we will discuss the morphologies that lend themselves to, or compromise, septation.

In most instances, both atrioventricular junctions are connected to a dominant left ventricle, in the presence of an incomplete morphologically right ventricle (Figure 8.4). The chamber lacks its inlet component, either completely when the atrial chambers are exclusively connected to the dominant left ventricle (Figures 8.1. 8.4, 8.5), or for the greater part when there is overriding of one (Figure 8.6), or rarely both, atrioventricular junctions. The incomplete ventricle can be positioned to the right (Figure 8.7) or the left (Figure 8.8) of the dominant ventricle, but it is always located anterosuperiorly, with the atrioventricular connections opening posteriorly to the hypoplastic ventricular septum (Figures 8.4, 8.9). The morphology of the incomplete ventricle is markedly different when it supports the pulmonary trunk (Figures 8.6, 8.10), the

ventriculoarterial connections being concordant, compared to the more usual arrangement with discordant ventriculoarterial connections when the aorta arises from the incomplete ventricle (Figures 8.4, 8.7, 8.8). In all instances, nonetheless, the incomplete chambers possess an apical component of morphologically right ventricular pattern. They are separated from the dominant ventricle by the hypoplastic muscular ventricular septum (Figure 8.4), which carries the atrioventricular conduction axis, and which is nourished by septal perforating arteries <sup>11</sup>.

The crucial feature in terms of surgical correction is the dimensions of the ventricular septal defect, as this must be of adequate size to support the systemic circulation irrespective of the precise surgical tactics to be adopted. If it is restrictive (Figure 8.4), it may need to be surgically enlarged, although more frequently the option is to by-pass the restrictive area by opting for the Norwood approach, or performing a Damus-Kave-Stansel procedure. Should the surgeon opt to enlarge the ventricular septal defect, the major anatomical feature of concern is the course of the axis of atrioventricular conduction tissue<sup>12</sup>. Although always originating from an anomalously located

**Fig. 8.4** The reconstructed computed tomographic angiogram shows, in exemplary fashion, the essential anatomy of a double-inlet left ventricle. Both atrioventricular junctions (white arrows) open into the dominant left ventricle, which gives rise to the pulmonary (pulm.) trunk. The aorta arises from the incomplete right ventricle, which is separated from the dominant ventricle by the apical ventricular septum (star). The hole between the ventricles (double-headed black arrow) is a ventricular septal defect, which is restrictive in this example.

Fig. 8.6 In this specimen with a double-inlet left ventricle, the incomplete right ventricle is photographed from the front with the heart positioned anatomically. The ventriculoarterial connections are concordant, with the pulmonary trunk seen supported by an infundibulum and arising from the incomplete right ventricle. The right atrioventricular valve straddles and overrides, but its greater part remains connected within the dominant left ventricle, so the connection remains one of a double inlet.

atrioventricular node (see later), irrespective of its relationship relative to the dominant left ventricle, the axis always extends posteroinferior to the defect when viewed from the incomplete right ventricle, being carried on the left ventricular aspect of the septal crest (Figure 8.5). When the ventriculoarterial connections are discordant, the incomplete right ventricle usually has a very short outlet portion (Figures 8.7, 8.8), making it difficult to remove any tissue cephalad to the defect. The safest way to enlarge the defect surgically, therefore, is to remove a wedge of the muscular ventricular septum closest to the obtuse margin of the heart (Figure 8.11)<sup>12</sup> .

In a small proportion of patients with a double-inlet left ventricle, the ventriculoarterial connections may be concordant<sup>7</sup> , or there can be a double outlet from the dominant left or incomplete right ventricle. The variant with concordant ventriculoarterial connections is of significant anatomical interest. The lesion is described eponymously as the Holmes heart13. In this setting, the incomplete right ventricle, when seen in isolation, can be virtually indistinguishable from the incomplete right ventricle seen in hearts with tricuspid atresia (compare Figures 8.9 and 8.12). The ventricular septal defect is often restrictive in this form of double-inlet left ventricle (Figure 8.9), and the same

rules pertain should it require surgical enlargement. This is unlikely to be performed, however, unless a septation is also attempted. The more likely approach will be to perform a Fontan procedure. The incomplete right ventricle will then be excluded from the circulation.

Taken overall, the Fontan procedure, or one of its modifications, will be the likely operation of choice for most patients with a double-inlet left ventricle. It can be used successfully for all the various anatomical variants, providing that the haemodynamic criterions are satisfactory14. Almost always, the procedure includes connecting the systemic venous returns, in one way or another, to the pulmonary arteries. This is

usually achieved now by either creating a conduit within the right atrium to produce a so-called total cavopulmonary connection15, or inserting an extracardiac conduit that connects the inferior caval

vein to the pulmonary arteries, combining this with a Glenn procedure16. In the past, the roof of the right atrium at its junction with the appendage was often connected directly to the pulmonary trunk. Such an

atriopulmonary connection still remains a surgical option. When there is juxtaposition of the atrial appendages, a not infrequent associated malformation with a double-inlet left ventricle, this anastomosis

Fig. 8.13 In this heart, photographed in the operating room, the artery to the sinus node, arising from the right coronary artery, is seen coursing through the interatrial groove to cross the cavoatrial junction at the crest of the right atrial appendage. The sinus node is visible as a pale area within the terminal groove.

becomes even simpler. If the atrium is to be connected to the pulmonary arteries, either directly or by construction of an internal conduit, it is crucial for the surgeon to avoid the sinus node and its arterial supply. In this respect, the key area is the superior interatrial groove, through which courses

the artery to the sinus node irrespective of its arterial origin (Figure 8.13). Use of an internal or external conduit obviously obviates the need to isolate the systemic venous return from the right atrioventricular valve surgically, an added manoeuvre that is essential if attempting an atriopulmonary connection. If this has to be done, there are at least two options open to the surgeon. It can be done by securing a patch across the vestibule of the valve. It can also be achieved by deviating the atrial septum to the parietal border of the right atrium, thus leaving both valves draining to the dominant ventricle. With both of these options, it is important to avoid the atrioventricular node, which in a doubleinlet left ventricle is no longer located at the apex of the triangle of Koch<sup>17</sup>. This is because the muscular ventricular septum, carrying the ventricular conduction tissues, does not reach the crux of the heart, rising instead to the acute margin of the ventricular mass (Figure 8.5). The atrioventricular node, therefore, is located within the quadrant of the junction related to the mouth of the right atrial appendage (Figure 8.14). This area is the major site of danger. Irrespective of its precise location, nonetheless, the node can be avoided by securing the patch at least one centimetre above the attachments of the leaflets of the right atrioventricular valve (Figure 8.14).

The features discussed above, however, are less pertinent to the modern-day surgeon, as it is now the rule to insert an extracardiac conduit so as to direct the inferior caval venous blood to the lungs or to the superior caval vein. Like an internal baffle, this procedure produces the total cavopulmonary connection <sup>16</sup> with the extracardiac conduit also having advantages in terms of the pattern of flow into the pulmonary arteries. Should it be decided to construct an internal baffle, the major areas to be avoided are again the

sinus node and its arterial supply. Such problems are avoided when inserting an extracardiac conduit.

Very few surgeons now choose septation for patients with a double-inlet left ventricle, even though it is perhaps the most logical surgical option<sup>5</sup>. Relatively few patients, however, have anatomy suitable for successful septation. Both atrioventricular valves must be competent structures, and the relationships of dominant and incomplete ventricles must permit the construction of a patch to channel flow from the left atrioventricular valve to the ventricular septal defect. This means that the incomplete right ventricle should be left-sided (Figures 8.4, 8.8) or, at worst, directly anterior. The dominant ventricle also needs to be of good size. which means that septation is unlikely to be attempted in infancy. If the pulmonary circulation is not protected by naturally occurring stenosis, this must be achieved immediately after birth by banding the pulmonary trunk. Banding itself tends to promote hypertrophy of the ventricular myocardium, and narrowing of the ventricular septal defect. It may also be necessary, therefore, to combine enlargement of the defect (Figure 8.11) with septation. The presence of naturally occurring subpulmonary stenosis may

dictate the insertion of a conduit from the dominant ventricle to the pulmonary arteries. Remarkably few patients will match all these criterions, and become suitable candidates for septation. In those that are, the major consideration during surgery will be to avoid the axis of atrioventricular conduction tissue, thus avoiding iatrogenic heart block. It is also necessary, of course, to preserve the sinus node and its arterial supply (Figure 8.13).

The atrioventricular conduction axis in hearts with a double-inlet left ventricle takes its origin from an anomalous node located anterocephalad within the right atrioventricular junction, beneath the mouth of the atrial appendage (Figure 8.14). From this anterior node, the atrioventricular bundle penetrates the lateral end of the area of fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the pulmonary and the right atrioventricular valves. When the incomplete right ventricle is left-sided, as it will be in most cases suitable for septation. the non-branching atrioventricular bundle encircles the anterior quadrants of the pulmonary orifice to reach the rightwards margin of the muscular ventricular septum (Figure 8.5). The left bundle branch then cascades down the left ventricular aspect of the septum, the axis of conduction tissue itself being located anterocephalad to the

ventricular septal defect when viewed either through a fish-mouth incision in the dominant left ventricle (Figure 8.15), or through the right atrioventricular valve (Figure 8.16). Unless a conduit is also placed from the dominant left ventricle to the pulmonary arteries, the line of sutures used to septate the dominant ventricle must cross this course of the axis of conduction tissues (Figure 8.15). The axis itself is

relatively narrow as it emerges from the area of fibrous continuity between the pulmonary and right atrioventricular valves. If this site is known with precision, the sutures can be placed so as to avoid the axis. All of these considerations, taken together, indicate that septation is a formidable surgical procedure if the pathways through the dominant ventricle are to be separated without insertion of a

conduit, or involuntary induction of atrioventricular dissociation. Septation can be a potentially feasible option for patients with a double-inlet left ventricle and concordant ventriculoarterial connections. If attempted, the same rules hold good for the disposition of the axis of conduction tissue, but a potential caveat is that the ventricular septal defect is most frequently restrictive or obstructed (Figures 8.4, 8.9).

The potential line for complete septation, placing the pulmonary trunk in communication with the systemic venous return (blue dashed line), crosses the conduction axis. To avoid the conduction axis (green dashed line), it is necessary to deviate the site of septation so that both outflow tracts remain in communication with the pulmonary venous return through the left atrioventricular valve.

Fig. 8.17 This specimen with a double-inlet and double-outlet right ventricle is photographed in anatomical orientation. Both atrioventricular valves connect exclusively to the dominant right ventricle, while the extensive outlet septum (white double-headed arrow) separates the origins of the two arterial trunks. RAVV and LAVV, right and left atrioventricular valves.

The other variants of the double-inlet ventricle are much more rare, and hardly ever are suitable for septation. The doubleinlet right ventricle (Figure 8.17) is seen most frequently with a double outlet from the dominant right ventricle, often with straddling and overriding of the left atrioventricular valve (Figure 8.3)18. The incomplete left ventricle, usually found in the left-sided position, although sometimes found to the right, is nothing more than a pouch with left ventricular apical trabeculations (Figure 8.18). It is always found posteroinferiorly, and is dorsal to the atrioventricular valves, in the diaphragmatic surface of the ventricular mass. The Fontan procedure is the most likely therapeutic surgical option, in which case the landmarks within the atrial chambers, together with the surgical caveats, are as discussed for the doubleinlet left ventricle. Sometimes, a doubleinlet right ventricle can be found with concordant ventriculoarterial connections (Figure 8.19), usually with a common valve guarding the atrioventricular junctions (Figures 8.3, 8.20). The axis of atrioventricular conduction in this setting descends from a node located within its

usual position in the triangle of Koch. The exception is when the incomplete left ventricle is right-sided, the conduction axis arising from an anomalous node19, as in congenitally corrected transposition (see later).

Those rare hearts with a double inlet to a solitary and indeterminate ventricle usually coexist with isomerism of the atrial appendages, when the multiple associated malformations, particularly the anomalous venoatrial connections, dominate the picture. Rare examples can be found with the usual arrangement of the atrial appendages. In this setting, the crossing of the tension apparatus from the atrioventricular valves, along with the particularly coarse indeterminate apical trabeculations, tend to conspire against septation (Figure 8.21). Patients with solitary ventricles, therefore, are also most likely to undergo repair by means of the Fontan option, and the same rules apply as discussed earlier.

Hearts with huge ventricular septal defects (Figure 8.22) can sometimes be confused with a double inlet to a solitary and indeterminate ventricle. Even in those hearts with huge septal defects, septation

remains a formidable undertaking. In these rare patients, it is the persisting rim of muscular septum separating the apical trabecular components, together with the inlet septum rising to the crux, that provide the anatomical landmarks. The axis of conduction tissue descends from the regular atrioventricular node when the atrioventricular connections are concordant in this setting (Figure 8.22).

# TRICUSPID AND MITRAL ATRESIA

In most instances, tricuspid atresia is produced by complete absence of the right atrioventricular connection (Figure 8.23). Many hearts with mitral atresia exist because of the absence of the left atrioventricular connection (Figure 8.24). In these hearts, because of the absence of one of the atrioventricular connections, and hence with only one of the atrioventricular junctions making contact with the ventricular mass, the ventricular morphology is comparable to that seen in those with a double inlet (see Figure 8.2). All three atrioventricular connections are univentricular. The solitary atrioventricular valve, nonetheless, can

Ant. Post. Fig. 8.19 In this picture, again in anatomical orientation, an example is seen of a double-inlet right ventricle in which the incomplete left ventricle gives rise to the aorta.

**Fig. 8.20** This is another picture of the dominant right ventricle from the heart shown in Figure 8.19. Both atriums drain to the dominant ventricle through the common atrioventricular (AV) valve.

straddle and override (Figure 8.25). This produces a uniatrial, but biventricular, atrioventricular connection<sup>20</sup>.

Although the variations in terms of ventricular morphology when one atrioventricular connection is absent are the same as for the double-inlet ventricle, most examples fall into what can be considered to represent classical types of atrioventricular valvar atresia. We will concentrate our attention, therefore, on these anticipated variants, while drawing attention to the less familiar formats.

In tricuspid atresia, it is the morphologically right atrium that is blindending, usually with no vestige of the tricuspid valve in its floor (Figure 8.26).

The right atrioventricular valve (RAVV) is connected within the right ventricle, hence the concordant nature of the atrioventricular connections.

Fig. 8.23 The heart has been sectioned to replicate the fourchamber echocardiographic view. It shows complete absence of the right atrioventricular (AV) connection, the atrioventricular groove being filled with adipose tissue, and containing the right coronary artery.

The section passes mostly through the dominant left ventricle (LV) (compare with Figure 8.1), but the posterior part of the incomplete right ventricle is just visible (star).

Because of the absent connection, the right ventricle is incomplete, lacking its inlet component21. The apical trabecular part of the incomplete ventricle, as with the doubleinlet left ventricle (Figures 8.4, 8.10), is separated from the dominant ventricle by the apical muscular ventricular septum (Figure 8.27). As in the double-inlet left

ventricle, the apical ventricular septum does not extend to the crux, but rather extends to the acute margin of the ventricular mass (Figure 8.28). Surgical palliation involves the

Fontan operation, or one of its modifications. In hearts with concordant ventriculoarterial connections, attempts were often made during the early period of evolution of the Fontan procedure to incorporate the

incomplete right ventricle into the pulmonary circulation22. Presently, most surgeons have shifted to constructing total cavopulmonary connections, now mostly using external conduits. If the conduit is to be constructed within the right atrium, the architecture of its muscular walls, and the arterial supply, should be disturbed as little as possible. Preservation of the sinus node and its blood supply is particularly

**Fig. 8.28** This dissection of a specimen with tricuspid atresia with concordant ventriculoarterial connections, viewed in anatomical orientation, shows that the right delimiting coronary artery descends at the acute margin of the ventricular mass from the right coronary artery, rather than the crux. The other delimiting artery is the anterior interventricular (ant. intervent.) artery. Note the anterosuperior location of the incomplete right ventricle. VSD, ventricular septal defect.

important, as atrial arrhythmia is a recognised life-threatening postoperative complication, particularly in the long term. The rules for avoidance of these structures are as described earlier for the double-inlet ventricle (Figure 8.9). Whenever a wellformed Eustachian valve is encountered, it should be preserved. Such a valve can be incorporated in an internal baffle. Creation of such an internal baffle requires the surgeon to make a direct and wide connection between the right atrium and the pulmonary arteries. In such circumstances, the artery to the sinus node can be at risk as it traverses the interatrial groove. This potential complication is avoided when inserting an extracardiac conduit.

When the Fontan procedure is performed in hearts with discordant ventriculoarterial connections, it may be necessary to resect the margins of the ventricular septal defect should it be restrictive. This must be done in a way that avoids the atrioventricular conduction axis on the left ventricular aspect of the septum<sup>12</sup>. When seen from the right ventricle, this runs posteroinferior to the septal defect as in the double-inlet left ventricle (Figure 8.29). The rare exception is when the typical muscular ventricular septal defect is atretic, and an apical trabecular

defect provides the interventricular communication (Figure 8.29).

In very rare cases, tricuspid atresia may be produced because an imperforate valvar membrane is interposed between the right atrium and ventricle. This can be seen as part of pulmonary atresia with an intact ventricular septum (Figure 8.30). An imperforate valve can also be found when there are concordant atrioventricular connections and a ventricular septal defect (Figure 8.31), albeit very rarely, or as part of Ebstein's malformation (Figure 8.32)<sup>23</sup>. We are unaware of any patient in whom the junction blocked by the imperforate membrane has been of sufficient size to permit resection of the valve, and replacement with a valvar prosthesis.

Operative treatment of mitral atresia is complicated because of its usual association with aortic atresia. This, of course, is one of the typical combinations producing hypoplasia of the left heart<sup>24</sup>. Direct surgical correction involves reconstruction of the arterial pathways as an initial procedure, employing the Norwood protocol<sup>25</sup> or one of its modifications. This is followed by a subsequent modified Fontan procedure. The options in these procedures are dictated by the anatomy of

the aortic pathways rather than the ventricular morphology, with the key features being the relations of the arterial duct (Figures 8.33, 8.34), and the size of the aortic root (Figures 8.35-8.38). In some patients having atresia of the left atrioventricular valve, however, the aortic outflow tract is patent. Mitral atresia may not be the best term for description of all these patients. This is because, in many, the morphology suggests that, had the left atrioventricular connection been formed, it would have been guarded by a morphologically tricuspid valve. The right atrium in this setting is connected to a morphologically left ventricle, with the incomplete right ventricle being anterior and left-sided, usually with discordant ventriculoarterial connections (Figure 8.39). In this setting, there is no direct route for the pulmonary venous return to reach the dominant left ventricle. The blood must cross an atrial septal defect and traverse the right-sided atrioventricular valve. Initial survival in these cases, therefore, depends on the state of the atrial septum. Should the septum be restrictive, it will need to be enlarged. Some sort of modified Fontan procedure will then be the final option, usually a

**Fig. 8.29** The cartoon, drawn in surgical orientation, shows the route of the axis of the atrioventricular conduction tissue, illustrated in green, relative to the usual ventricular septal defect in tricuspid atresia, and to a defect opening between the apical trabecular component of the incomplete right ventricle and the dominant ventricle. In the latter situation, the axis is superior relative to the defect.

cavopulmonary connection. As with tricuspid atresia, left-sided atresia can be produced by an imperforate atrioventricular valve rather than being due to the absence of the left atrioventricular connection. The imperforate valve can be found with biventricular (Figure 8.40) or double-inlet (Figure 8.41) atrioventricular connections. Irrespective of the specific morphology, the only surgical option will be to create a functionally univentricular connection, the Fontan circulation being constructed following one of the options discussed earlier.

#### **TRANSPOSITION**

A particularly important lesion is represented by the combination of concordant atrioventricular with discordant ventriculoarterial connections. Most clinicians refer to the combination simply as transposition. This usage, although widespread, is less than precise. In the past, disagreements were frequent as to whether the term transposition should be used only to describe hearts with discordant ventriculoarterial connections<sup>26</sup>, or for description of any heart with an anterior aorta<sup>27</sup>. More significantly, when transposition is used to describe discordant ventriculoarterial connections, the term is not restricted to the combination with concordant atrioventricular connections. Transposition, if defined simply on the basis of discordant ventriculoarterial connections, can also coexist with discordant atrioventricular connections. with a double-inlet ventricle, with an

absence of one atrioventricular connection,

or with isomerism and biventricular but mixed atrioventricular connections. In all these circumstances, it is the arrangements at the atrioventricular junctions that become the dominant features. There is, therefore, a need for a term that describes only the combinations of concordant atrioventricular and discordant ventriculoarterial connections (Figure 8.42). Previously, our preferred term had been complete transposition. We now recognise that this term itself is less than perfect. Complete, as an adjective, was first used to indicate that both arterial trunks were transposed across the ventricular septum, thus distinguishing the arrangement from the presumed partial arrangement, in which only the aorta was transposed across the septum. The latter anomaly is universally described now as a double-outlet right ventricle, although as

we will discuss, problems also remain in defining this entity. This does not alter the fact that, in the strictest sense, all examples of discordant ventriculoarterial connections represent complete

transposition28. We suggest, therefore, that the combination of discordant ventriculoarterial with concordant atrioventricular connections be considered the default option for use of the term

transposition. If discordant ventriculoarterial connections are found in other settings, we describe them as congenitally corrected transposition, or tricuspid atresia with transposition, and so on.

It is less than appropriate, however, to use d-transposition as the same default option. This latter term fails to account accurately for all patients having the usual atrial arrangement with concordant

atrioventricular and discordant ventriculoarterial connections. An important subset of these patients can have a left-sided aorta (Figure 8.43). Nor does d-transposition describe accurately

the majority of patients with the combinations of mirror-imaged atrial arrangement, concordant atrioventricular, and discordant ventriculoarterial connections (Figure 8.44). All these

patients, nonetheless, can be described accurately as having transposition. However, discordant ventriculoarterial connections, as we have already

emphasised, can also occur in the setting of isomerism of the atrial appendages. The anomalies at the venoatrial and atrioventricular junctions then dominate the anatomical and clinical considerations. We exclude these cases, therefore, from the category of transposition as described here.

From the surgical standpoint, the two major subgroups of hearts with transposition are those without any major additional complicating lesions, usually described as simple transposition, and those with additional malformations sufficiently severe to complicate the clinical picture. The morphological aspects of the complicating lesions will be dealt with in turn, but the atrial

anatomy is comparable within the whole group.

Now, corrective surgical procedures are almost always performed at the arterial level. Operations designed to redirect

Fig. 8.39 As shown by this specimen, in anatomical orientation viewed from the left, mitral atresia is not always part of hypoplasia of the left heart. In this example, there is absence of the left atrioventricular connection, but the right atrium is connected to a dominant ventricle with left ventricular trabeculations (not seen). The incomplete right ventricle, supporting the aorta, is left-sided and anterior. Had the left atrioventricular valve been formed, it would almost certainly have been of tricuspid morphology.

venous blood at the atrial level should not be forgotten, however, particularly as these manoeuvres are an integral part of double switch procedures. When planning these operations, known as the Mustard and Senning options, it is the disposition of the cardiac nodes and their blood supply that is probably the most important factor. The presence of discordant ventriculoarterial connections does not affect the position of the sinus node in any way, so the rules enunciated in Chapter 2 for avoidance of this node, and discussed earlier in the setting of the Fontan procedure, are

equally applicable in the setting of transposition. The entire terminal groove should be avoided, as should the crest of the atrial appendage, because the node can extend in horseshoe fashion across the crest, although it is usually in a lateral position. The nodal artery may

enter the groove across the crest of the appendage, or after it has taken a retrocaval course. Of more importance is the course taken by the nodal artery as is ascends the interatrial groove. The artery frequently burrows into the atrial musculature,

running across the superior border of the oval fossa, usually described as being the septum secundum (Figure 8.45). It is at risk in this position when incising the septum for either a Senning or Mustard procedure, or during a Blalock–Hanlon

septostomy. A lateral course across the atrial appendage is also significant (Figure 8.46).

Other considerations remain significant when carrying out a venous switch procedure. Cannulation of the superior

caval vein should be performed a good distance from the cavoatrial junction, incising the right atrium well clear of the terminal groove. Traction, suction, or

suturing should be avoided in the area of the superior border of the groove. If an incision is required across the terminal groove to widen the newly constructed

pulmonary venous atrium in Mustard's operation, it can be made between the right pulmonary veins without fear of damaging the sinus node or its artery.

![](_page_25_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 8.47** This dissection is made in a normal heart, orientated anatomically, by removing the endocardium from the inner surface of the right atrium. It shows the non-uniform anisotropic arrangement of the aggregated cardiomyocytes making up the atrial walls. There is preferential conduction along the major axis of muscle bundles such as the terminal crest, but no insulated tracts within the atrial musculature. The site of the atrioventricular node, at the apex of the triangle of Koch, is shown by the star.

This discussion is also pertinent to the genesis of arrhythmias after Mustard's operation or the Senning procedure. It had been suggested that the arrhythmias are due to damage to purported specialised internodal pathways<sup>29</sup>. As we have explained in Chapter 2, there are no insulated tracts to be found within the atrial myocardium. Instead, the atrioventricular impulse is conducted from the sinus node through the thicker muscles of the right atrial wall and septum, with the anisotropic aggregation of the cardiomyocytes favouring preferential conduction (Figure 8.47). It is advantageous, therefore, to preserve at least one of these routes. If the terminal crest is to be divided to enlarge the new pulmonary venous atrium, this is a further reason to preserve the superior border of the oval fossa. These procedures, together with scrupulous avoidance of the sinus node and its blood supply, mean that arrhythmias can be reduced considerably, if not totally avoided, after atrial redirection procedures.

It is always important to avoid the atrioventricular node. The landmarks to this vital structure are the same as in the normal heart. Providing all surgery is performed outside the triangle of Koch, injury to the node will be avoided. The technique of cutting back the coronary

sinus should be carefully considered. It is possible to perform this procedure without damaging the node and its zones of transitional cells, but the incision will undoubtedly cross one of the preferential routes of conduction. For this reason, it is safer to place the inferior suture line so as to avoid the triangle of Koch completely.

It is also important to place the interatrial baffles so as to minimise the risk of subsequent venous obstruction, either in the pulmonary or venous pathways. Although it was suggested that venous obstruction was less likely to complicate the Senning procedure, those who became skilled in the Mustard procedure were able to achieve excellent results with a minimal incidence of late venous obstruction<sup>30</sup>. Almost certainly, therefore, it is the surgical technique that determines the likelihood of postoperative venous obstruction.

The major complicating lesion in transposition is the presence of a ventricular septal defect, with or without obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract. Any other lesion can coexist if anatomically possible. The anatomy of the additional lesions is then as described for the lesion found in isolation.

It follows, therefore, that ventricular septal defects, when found in patients with

transposition, can be just as variable as when found in isolation (Figure 8.48). The majority of defects open between the outlet components of the ventricular mass, but have their own peculiar characteristics. In such settings, typically with malalignment of the outlet septum, they can extend to become perimembranous when there is fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the tricuspid and pulmonary valves (Figure 8.49), or have a muscular posteroinferior rim (Figure 8.50). The distinguishing feature, as in tetralogy of Fallot, is whether the posterocaudal limb of the septomarginal trabeculation, or septal band, fuses with the ventriculoinfundibular fold. If there is fusion (Figure 8.50), the resultant muscle bar will buttress the conduction axis, and there will be discontinuity between the leaflets of the tricuspid and pulmonary valves. If there is no fusion of the muscular bars, the defect will be perimembranous. The penetrating atrioventricular bundle will thus be at risk in this area of fibrous continuity (Figure 8.49).

These defects have other features of surgical significance. The tension apparatus of the tricuspid valve tends to course over the defect, attaching itself to the outlet septum or to the ventriculoinfundibular fold. This makes

Fig. 8.48 The cartoon shows how the ventricular septal defect in hearts with transposition, as in the normal heart, can be perimembranous, muscular, or doubly committed and juxtaarterial.

closure of the defect difficult without producing damage to the tricuspid valve, albeit that this is of less significance when the tricuspid valve is in the pulmonary

circuit after an arterial switch. Of more significance is the divergence of the margins of the parietal and anterior heart walls. In hearts with concordant

ventriculoarterial connections, the anterior margin of a ventricular septal defect is usually well circumscribed. In the setting of transposition, the muscular outlet septum

is frequently malaligned relative to the rest of the muscular ventricular septum as it inserts into the anterocephalad wall of the right ventricular outflow tract. The defect, therefore, is more difficult to close at this anterior margin (Figures 8.49, 8.50).

Defects can open into the inlet of the right ventricle, and again be perimembranous (Figure 8.51) or muscular (Figure 8.52). Some muscular defects open centrally, while others open apically, often being multiple. Defects opening into the

ventricular inlet, which are also perimembranous, are the harbingers of straddling and overriding of the tricuspid valve. This should always be suspected when the right ventricle is hypoplastic. Straddling and overriding of the tricuspid

valve markedly increases the risks of surgery, not least because of the abnormal disposition of the conduction tissues (Figures 8.53, 8.54). Doubly committed

and juxta-arterial defects can also be found, but are the rarest variant (Figure 8.55).

Subpulmonary obstruction in transposition (Figure 8.56) can be produced by any lesion which, in the normal heart, would produce subaortic obstruction. Valvar stenosis often accompanies the subvalvar abnormalities.

More rare lesions, such as anomalous insertion of the tension apparatus of the atrioventricular valve, are probably beyond surgical repair. Aneurysm of the membranous septum, or similar fibrous tissue tags (Figure 8.57) should be readily amenable to removal, although a subpulmonary fibrous shelf poses more problems as it directly overlies the left

bundle branch. The lesion also typically extends on to the pulmonary leaflet of the mitral valve, and can coexist with a ventricular septal defect (Figure 8.58). The difficulties are compounded when the fibrous obstruction is more extensive, because it can form a subvalvar tunnel. The other quadrants of the outflow tract are also vulnerable because of their proximity to the

left coronary artery, or because they are formed by the pulmonary leaflet of the mitral valve. The safest area for resection is beneath the remnant of the left margin of the ventriculoinfundibular fold. When subpulmonary obstruction coexists with a ventricular septal defect, there is frequently posterocaudal deviation of the outlet septum, which is inserted in the left

ventricle (Figure 8.59). This usually means that the aortic valve overrides the septum. When the septal defect is substantial with this combination, the scene is set for an operative procedure such as the Rastelli or Nikaidoh operations. When placing the aortic outlet into the left ventricle during these procedures, it is possible to resect the outlet septum safely, which never harbours conduction tissue. Such resection of the

outlet septum is also part of the REV procedure. Should the defect be situated other than between the ventricular outlets, the chances of successfully transferring the aortic infundibulum into the left ventricle are considerably reduced.

Thus far, we have devoted attention exclusively to the segmental anatomy of transposition. There is further variation to be found in terms of arterial relationships

and infundibular anatomy. These variations do not alter the intracardiac anatomy, and are of relatively minor surgical significance. For example, the aorta is usually anterior and to the right in complete transposition (Figure 8.60) but as already illustrated, the aorta may be anterior and to the left. This is the rule when the atrial chambers are mirrorimaged (Figure 8.44), but left-sided and

![](_page_31_Picture_2.jpeg)

Fig. 8.59 This specimen of transposition, seen from the left ventricle in anatomical orientation, has posterocaudal deviation of the outlet septum through a coexisting ventricular septal defect. VSD, ventricular septal defect.

transposed aortas can also be encountered when there is usual atrial arrangement (Figure 8.43). In even more rare cases, the aorta can be posterior and to the right of the pulmonary trunk (Figure 8.61). These different relationships do not alter the basic anatomy. They do show why it is inadvisable to use the term d-transposition as a unifying terminology, as it makes little sense to use this term for description of the patient in whom the aorta is left-sided when there is usual atrial arrangement.

![](_page_32_Picture_2.jpeg)

Fig. 8.60 This heart is shown in anatomical orientation, demonstrating the usual relationship of the aorta in the setting of transposition, namely anterior and to the right of the pulmonary trunk. Note the parallel arrangement of the arterial trunks as they extend into the mediastinum.

![](_page_32_Figure_4.jpeg)

Fig. 8.61 In this specimen of transposition, shown in anatomical orientation from the front, the aorta is positioned posteriorly and in a rightwards position relative to the pulmonary trunk, with spiralling of the arterial trunks. This is the normal relationship of the arterial trunks, but still with discordant ventriculoarterial connections. The arrows show that the right ventricle supports the aorta, while the left ventricle gives rise to the pulmonary (pulm.) trunk.

There are some clues to associated lesions to be drawn from these unexpected arterial relationships. When the aorta is left-sided with the usual atrial

arrangement, any coexisting ventricular septal defect is frequently doubly committed and juxta-arterial. This arrangement is convenient for direct

connection of the aorta to the left ventricle. When the aorta is posterior and the arterial trunks are normally related, there is usually a subpulmonary infundibulum, with the

**Fig. 8.62** This heart, photographed through the left ventricle in anatomical orientation, shows a large subpulmonary infundibulum (white double-headed arrow) separating the leaflets of the pulmonary and mitral valves.

leaflets of the aortic valve in fibrous continuity with the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve through the roof of a perimembranous septal defect. This unusual anatomy can create difficulty both at initial diagnosis and at subsequent surgery. Variations in infundibular morphology in themselves are unlikely to give problems. The expected subaortic muscular infundibulum in the right ventricle is encountered most frequently along with fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the pulmonary and mitral valves in the left ventricle. Rarely, there may be a complete muscular infundibulum in both ventricles (Figure 8.62). Even more rarely, as described earlier, there may be a subpulmonary infundibulum with continuity between the leaflets of the aortic and mitral valves, particularly when the discordantly connected aorta is in a posterior position.

The feature currently of greatest surgical importance in patients with transposition is the morphology of the coronary arteries. This is because of the universal acceptance of the arterial switch procedure as the surgical treatment of choice. This operation involves transecting the ascending aorta and pulmonary trunk, and reconnecting them to their

morphologically appropriate ventricles. The significant morphological feature is that, thus far without reported exception, the coronary arteries arise from the aortic sinuses that are adjacent to the pulmonary trunk (Figure 8.63). When performing the arterial switch, therefore, the surgeon is required to transfer the origins of the coronary arteries across a relatively short distance (Figure 8.64). This holds true irrespective of the relationship of the aorta to the pulmonary trunk.

The variable relationships between the aorta and the pulmonary trunk, however, produce problems in naming the aortic sinuses and, hence, the origin of the coronary arteries. Truly formidable conventions are created if attempts are made to catalogue each and every pattern<sup>31</sup>. while use of simple alphabetical codes<sup>32</sup> is self-evidently procrustean. As suggested by the group from Leiden<sup>33</sup>, it is best to name the aortic sinuses as viewed from the stance of the observer standing in the nonadjacent sinus of the aorta and looking towards the pulmonary trunk (Figure 8.65). Thus, one sinus is always to the observer's right-hand side. This is designated as sinus no.1. The other sinus is to the left-hand side, and is called sinus no.2. The three major coronary arteries can arise from either of these sinuses, giving only eight potential patterns of sinusal origin, including the arrangements in which both arteries arise from the same aortic sinus (Figure 8.66). Thus far, only seven have been seen in the setting of transposition<sup>34</sup>. Transfer of the arteries during the switch procedure can be compromised by an anomalous course of the coronary arteries themselves in relation to the vascular pedicle (Figure 8.67), albeit that such variations can be suitably accommodated by appropriate surgical technique. An intramural course of the origin of the coronary artery across a valvar commissure (Figure 8.66), or through the aortic wall because of a high origin (Figures 8.68, 8.69), creates greater problems, but these can also be resolved now with appropriate surgical technique. The origin of the artery to the sinus node can be very close to the origin of one coronary artery from an aortic sinus, or the sinus nodal artery can originate separately from the sinus. Also of note is mismatch between the commissures of the aortic and pulmonary valves (Figure 8.70)<sup>35</sup>. Despite all these anatomical variations, surgeons now find it possible to perform the arterial switch procedure with remarkable success.

# CONGENITALLY CORRECTED TRANSPOSITION

We describe the combination of discordant atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial connections as congenitally corrected transposition (Figure 8.71). When defined

in this fashion, as with transposition itself (Figure 8.42), the entity can exist with the atrial chambers in their usual arrangement, or in mirror-imaged position (Figures 8.72–8.74). Furthermore, like transposition, it cannot exist when there is isomerism of the atrial appendages,

although hearts with isomeric appendages can have left-hand ventricular topology in association with discordant ventriculoarterial connections.

The complexities of congenitally corrected transposition reflect the fact that, with the usual atrial arrangement, there is

malalignment between the inlet part of the muscular ventricular septum and the atrial septum. These two septal structures are in line at the crux but, when traced forwards, they diverge markedly. This produces a gap, into which is wedged the subpulmonary outflow tract from the morphologically left ventricle

(Figure 8.75). This abnormal feature accounts for the most important surgical aspect of congenitally corrected transposition, namely the unusual disposition of the atrioventricular conduction tissues36. Because of the septal malalignment, it is not possible for the normal atrioventricular node, positioned at the apex of the triangle of Koch, to penetrate through the fibrous atrioventricular junction and make contact with the ventricular conduction tissues. Instead, an anomalous atrioventricular node, found in an anterolateral position (Figure 8.76), as in the double-inlet left ventricle (see Figure 8.14), gives rise to the

penetrating atrioventricular bundle. The bundle penetrates the insulating plane of the atrioventricular junction lateral to the area of fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the pulmonary and mitral valves. A long non-branching bundle then runs around the anterior quadrants of the subpulmonary outflow tract, crossing the characteristic anterior recess of the morphologically left ventricle, before descending onto the muscular ventricular septum (Figure 8.77). Having branched, the fan-like left branch is distributed in the right-sided morphologically left ventricle,

while the cord-like right branch of the bundle penetrates the septum to reach the left-sided morphologically right ventricle<sup>36</sup>. The discordantly connected aorta arises from this morphologically right ventricle, typically above a complete muscular infundibulum, and usually in a

left-sided position (Figure 8.78). When congenitally corrected transposition is found in the mirror-imaged variant, however, it is the rule for the aorta to be located in an anterior and right-sided position (Figure 8.74). This is why it is

less than ideal to use d-transposition as an alternative term for regular transposition.

When congenitally corrected transposition exists without any other anomaly, the circulation of the blood is normal. This situation is very much the exception. Usually, one or more of three associated lesions are found. These are a ventricular septal defect, pulmonary stenosis, or anomalies of the left-sided atrioventricular valve37. It is these

A ventricular septal defect is present in up to three-quarters of patients. As in the

patient with concordant atrioventricular connections, it may be perimembranous, muscular, or doubly committed and juxtaarterial (Figure 8.79). Usually it is of the

perimembranous type, and opens between the ventricular inlets. Because of the wedged position of the pulmonary valve, the pulmonary trunk tends to override the

then runs around the subpulmonary outflow tract to descend on the anterosuperior margin of the defect (Figure 8.77).

The safest way of closing the defect without damaging the conduction system is to place sutures from the left-sided morphologically right ventricular aspect (Figure 8.82)38. Although the defect opens mostly between the ventricular inlets, it can extend to become doubly committed and juxta-arterial. It is then roofed by the conjoined leaflets of the aortic and pulmonary valves (Figure 8.83). When it is perimembranous and juxta-arterial, the conduction tissue remains in an anterior position. In some patients, however, there can be a muscular inferior rim

between the leaflets of the pulmonary and mitral valves. It is still likely that the conduction tissue remains in an anterosuperior position relative to the defect. A comparable case has been seen with both a perimembranous and a muscular outlet defect. The conduction axis descended along the muscle bar between them.

As with transposition, any of the lesions that produces obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract will produce pulmonary stenosis when the transposition is congenitally corrected (Figure 8.84).

Valvar stenosis in isolation is rare, but frequently coexists with subvalvar obstructive lesions. Particularly significant in this respect are fibrous tissue tags (Figure 8.85). Fibrous diaphragmatic lesions (Figure 8.86), or muscular obstruction, are also encountered<sup>39</sup>. The overwhelming consideration in all of these types of stenosis is the presence of the non-branching bundle

Note the anterior position of the conduction axis, shown in yellow. As with transposition, the same lesions produce subaortic obstruction in the setting of concordant ventriculoarterial connections.

running around the anterior quadrants of the outflow tract. Apart from tissue tags, this relationship makes it very difficult to resect these various lesions. Placement of a conduit may be the safest means of avoiding postoperative heart block.

Ebstein's malformation is the lesion that most frequently afflicts the left-sided morphologically tricuspid valve, involving downwards displacement of the septal and mural leaflets (Figure 8.87). Only rarely is the inlet part of the ventricle dilated and thinned, as occurs so frequently in

Ebstein's malformation with concordant atrioventricular connections. Should replacement of the valve become necessary, the location of the conduction tissues in the right-sided atrioventricular junction takes them out of the area of danger.

The other anomaly that affects the left valve, and that can also affect the right valve40, is straddling of its tension apparatus and overriding of the valvar orifice (Figure 8.88). These anomalies do not alter the origin of the conduction

tissues from an anterolateral node, but will increase the risks of surgery markedly. Indeed, in the presence of straddling atrioventricular valves, some may opt for functionally univentricular rather than biventricular surgical correction. Those

who use biventricular correction have observed disappointing results subsequent to simple correction of the associated lesions, because these manoeuvres leave the morphologically right ventricle supporting the

Note the hypoplastic nature of the morphologically right ventricle.

systemic circulation. Because of this, the trend now is to correct the defects using the so-called double switch procedure, combining atrial redirection with either an arterial switch<sup>41</sup> or use of an interventricular tunnel to the aorta, placing a conduit from the morphologically right ventricle to the pulmonary atrium42. This also makes it possible to make corrections in patients with coexisting pulmonary atresia.

Some patients with discordant atrioventricular connections will have ventriculoarterial connections other than discordant ones. We will discuss the options for a double outlet from the morphologically right ventricle in the next section, but our emphasis there will be on patients with concordant atrioventricular connections. The variability to be described can also be found when the atrioventricular connections are discordant, but then the atrioventricular conduction axis will arise from an anterolateral atrioventricular node, as described for congenitally corrected transposition. In patients with discordant atrioventricular connections and a doubleoutlet right ventricle, nonetheless, it is also possible to find a sling of conduction tissue running along the crest of the muscular ventricular septum and joining anterior and regular atrioventricular nodes36. This possibility should be borne in mind for all patients having discordant atrioventricular connections and a double outlet from the morphologically right ventricle.

Some patients also have a single outlet in association with discordant atrioventricular connections, most frequently because of pulmonary atresia (Figure 8.89). In this situation, there is typically a perimembranous ventricular septal defect. If the defect is large, then, as we have discussed, it is possible to achieve biventricular repair by channelling the morphologically left ventricle to the aorta, placing a conduit from the morphologically right ventricle to the pulmonary arteries, and performing an atrial redirection procedure42. The defect, however, is not always large enough to permit channelling of the morphologically left ventricle to the aorta (Figure 8.90). If restrictive, the decision must be made as to whether the defect can be enlarged, or whether the better option is to create the Fontan circulation. The anterocephalad location of the atrioventricular conduction axis in the

setting can make enlargement of the defect a daunting procedure (Figure 8.90). Exceedingly rarely, it is possible to find pulmonary atresia with an intact ventricular septum and an imperforate right-sided atrioventricular valve. When seen from the right atrium, the arrangement can be indistinguishable from pulmonary atresia with an intact ventricular septum (compare Figure 8.91 with Figure 8.31). The significant difference is that, unlike regular pulmonary atresia with an intact ventricular septum, it is the morphologically right ventricle that must drive the systemic circulation when the atrioventricular connections are discordant (Figure 8.92). Aortic atresia, or common arterial trunk, can also rarely be found with discordant atrioventricular connections. A more important combination is that found with concordant ventriculoarterial connections. We will discuss this arrangement in greater detail below. The significant surgical feature is that the combination produces the ideal situation for employment of an atrial redirection procedure, because this restores the morphologically left ventricle to pumping the systemic circulation.

Fig. 8.90 The image shows the left-sided ventricle from the heart illustrated in Figure 8.89. The atrioventricular connections are discordant, and the aorta is supported by the left-sided morphologically (morph.) right ventricle. The perimembranous ventricular septal defect (VSD) is restrictive. The dotted red line shows the course of the atrioventricular conduction axis, which is carried on the right side of the ventricular septum. Its anterocephalad location relative to the defect would make enlargement difficult, if not impossible, to achieve without producing atrioventricular block if the decision were made to attempt biventricular repair by channelling the morphologically left ventricle to the aorta, and then performing an atrial redirection procedure.

# DOUBLE-OUTLET VENTRICLE

It is a well-known fact that spectrums of malformation exist in the settings of both tetralogy of Fallot and transposition when there is overriding of the aortic and pulmonary roots, respectively. It remains controversial as how best to describe the ends of these spectrums when the greater part of the overriding arterial root arises

from the ventricle that is also supporting the other arterial root. Our approach to this dilemma is to argue that, when the greater part of both arterial roots arises from the same ventricle, then the ventriculoarterial

When viewed in isolation, it is not possible to distinguish the morphological nature of the valve. As shown in Figure 8.92, however, the atrioventricular connections were discordant, so the valvar membrane is morphologically mitral. SCV, superior caval vein.

Fig. 8.92 The image shows the left-sided ventricle in the heart shown in Figure 8.91. The ventricle is coarsely trabeculated, and receives the morphologically (morph.) tricuspid valve. The heart had pulmonary atresia with an intact ventricular septum, but in the setting of discordant atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial connections.

connection is that of a double outlet. On this basis, we define a double-outlet ventricle whenever more than half of the circumference of both arterial valves takes its origin from the same ventricle43. In many patients, this problem does not arise, as both arterial trunks arise unequivocally from the one ventricle. An additional problem arises in this situation, because it was initially considered that, to justify the diagnosis of a double-outlet right ventricle, not only did both arterial trunks need to be supported exclusively from the right ventricle, but also that each arterial valve needed to have a completely muscular infundibulum, or conus. This approach, however, is inconsistent with the morphological method, which states that

one variable feature, in this instance the ventriculoarterial connection, should not be defined on the basis of another feature that is itself variable, namely the infundibular morphology. It is now accepted, therefore, that a double-outlet right ventricle can exist in the absence of bilateral infundibulums<sup>44</sup>. As we will show, many hearts do indeed exist when the arterial trunks arise from the right ventricle, but with fibrous continuity between the leaflets of an arterial and an atrioventricular valve. Furthermore, even when there is overriding of an arterial root, there is usually little question as to the anatomical assignment of the abnormal valve, because rarely does it appear to be equally committed to both chambers. In situations still creating difficulty, the decision regarding commitment of the overriding root should be made according to the connection of the leaflets as seen in short axis, rather than on the basis of the alignment of the long axis of the ventricular septum (Figure 8.93). Making designations on the basis of long-axis views can be misleading because of the motion of the heart during the cardiac cycle. This does not alter the arbitration as based on the

short axis. The 50% rule is simply a pragmatic convention for distinguishing between double-outlet and one-to-one ventriculoarterial connections. When based on such an approach, the topic of the double-outlet ventricle becomes straightforward, if not even simple.

The double-outlet ventriculoarterial connection, defined as discussed previously, accounts only for an anatomical arrangement of the ventriculoarterial junctions. Hearts with this feature, therefore, can exist with such a wide variety of configurations that the possible combinations seem almost limitless. The cases to be illustrated in this section are those with both arteries arising from the right ventricle in the setting of concordant atrioventricular connections. The principles to be established are equally applicable in the setting of the other atrioventricular connections, remembering that when the atrioventricular connections are discordant, or there is left-hand topology in the setting of isomerism, there is likely to be an anomalously located atrioventricular node, or even dual atrioventricular nodes. Almost always, there is a coexisting interventricular communication in the presence of the double outlet 45. It is thus the anatomical relationship

between the great arteries and the defect in the ventricular septum that is important to the surgeon. Naming the hole between the ventricles creates an additional difficulty. In patients having a ventricular septal defect in the setting of one-to-one ventriculoarterial connections, the ventricular septal defect is typically defined as the place of space limited caudally by the crest of the muscular ventricular septum, and cranially by the undersurface of the muscular outlet septum (Figure 8.94, left-hand panel). When both arterial trunks are supported within the right ventricle, the muscular outlet septum is exclusively a right ventricular structure (Figure 8.94, right-hand panel). The analogous plane of space to the regular ventricular septal defect would be the locus over which a patch is placed to tunnel one or the other arterial trunk into the left ventricle. this being the therapeutic option usually taken by the surgeon to restore biventricular circulations. This plane, however, is not the hole that is commonly defined as the ventricular septal defect in this setting. Instead, it is the exit from the left ventricle that is typically considered to represent the ventricular septal defect. Therefore, to avoid confusion, we prefer to name the hole as the

Fig. 8.93 The cartoon shows how overriding arterial valves are assigned to one or the other ventricle on the basis of their connection as judged in the short axis (left-hand panel), in which it is possible to assess the tangent drawn by the ventricular septum (X–Y) relative to the short axis of the overriding arterial trunk, rather than the long axis of the ventricular septum (A–B in the right-hand panel), which can change depending on the motion of the heart.

Fig. 8.94 The cartoon illustrates the significant difference between the plane of space identified as the ventricular septal defect when there are concordant or discordant ventriculoarterial connections (one-to-one connections) as opposed to a double outlet from the right ventricle. The left-hand panel illustrates the situation with discordant ventriculoarterial connections, but the concept is equally valid when the connections are concordant. As shown in the right-hand panel, the hole usually identified as the ventricular septal defect is better considered to be the interventricular communication.

**Fig. 8.95** This specimen, shown in anatomical orientation from the front, has a double outlet from the right ventricle with the interventricular communication in subaortic position. The great arterial trunks spiral in normal relationships as they leave the base of the heart.

interventricular communication.
Recognition of this fact also helps the surgeon to determine whether a given patient has a double-outlet ventriculoarterial connection. Should it be considered necessary to place a patch so as to tunnel the communication to an arterial root, then the

patient will have had a double outlet. In contrast, if the surgeon considers that it was possible simply to close the septal defect, then the patient will have had concordant or discordant ventriculoarterial connections.

The relationship of the arterial trunks is another variable in patients with a double

outlet from the right ventricle. In many, the aorta and the pulmonary trunk are related more or less normally. The aortic valve, therefore, is posterior and to the right of the pulmonary valve, and the pulmonary trunk spirals around the aorta as it extends towards its bifurcation (Figure 8.95). In the

**Fig. 8.96** In this specimen, seen in anatomical orientation from the front and with a double outlet from the right ventricle, the interventricular communication was in a subpulmonary position. The arterial trunks rise in parallel fashion (black arrows) as they exit from the base of the heart (compare with Figure 8.95).

![](_page_51_Figure_4.jpeg)

**Fig. 8.97** The cartoon, drawn in anatomical orientation, shows the three typical orientations of the arterial trunks to be found in hearts with a double-outlet right ventricle. The arrangements with spiralling and parallel arterial trunks with the aorta to the right have been shown in Figures 8.95 and 8.96. The rarest variant, shown in the right-hand panel, is for the arterial trunks to rise in parallel fashion, but with the aorta in the left-sided position. Ao, aorta; PT, pulmonary trunk.

remainder, the arterial trunks arise from the base of the heart in parallel fashion, as anticipated when the ventriculoarterial connections are discordant. For a good proportion of these, the arterial valves are side-by-side (Figure 8.96); otherwise, the aortic valve is anterior. In a few cases, the aorta is posteriorly located because the pulmonary trunk is enlarged. Almost always, the aorta is to the right but, in a small number of cases, the aorta can be left-sided relative to the pulmonary trunk (Figure 8.97). Although the interventricular

communication is most usually subaortic when the arterial trunks are spiralling, and subpulmonary when they extend into the mediastinum in parallel fashion, there is no direct correlation between these features. It is always necessary, therefore, to determine precisely the location of the interventricular communication relative to the arterial roots, and to establish whether it can be channelled safely to one or the other arterial root in an unobstructed fashion so as to achieve a biventricular surgical repair.

In the light of these discussions, it is evident that the anatomy of the interventricular communication needs to be considered in two ways. The first feature of significance is its proximity to the great arteries <sup>45</sup>. The second feature concerns its own intrinsic morphology. When combining these two approaches, it must be remembered that, when there is a double outlet from the right ventricle, the muscular ventricular septum itself separates only the inlet and apical trabecular components of the ventricles. As

![](_page_52_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 8.98** In this specimen, shown in anatomical orientation from the front, the interventricular communication (star) is cradled within the limbs of the septomarginal trabeculation (SMT). Note that the posterocaudal limb of the trabeculation fuses with the ventriculoinfundibular fold. The muscular buttress thus formed protects the atrioventricular conduction axis. There is fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the aortic and mitral valves in the roof of the interventricular communication, so that it is directly adjacent to the aortic root.

we have emphasised, the outlet septum, or its fibrous remnant, is found between the two outlets from the right ventricle, and does not form the roof of the interventricular communication.

Except when non-committed, the interventricular communication is cradled between the limbs of the septomarginal trabeculation, or septal band. Its other borders vary depending on several features. The first is whether the caudal limb of the septomarginal trabeculation fuses with the ventriculoinfundibular fold. If it does, there is a muscular inferior rim to the defect. This protects the conduction tissue axis as in tetralogy of Fallot or transposition (Figure 8.98). If it does not, there is continuity between the leaflets of the atrioventricular valves, and the defect is perimembranous (Figure 8.99). The second feature is the extent of the ventriculoinfundibular fold. It is the presence of well-formed folds bilaterally that produces bilateral muscular infundibulums, or the bilateral conuses that were initially considered to be part-andparcel of the definition of the double-outlet right ventricle. The significant surgical aspect of this feature is that the infundibulums move the arterial valves

some distance away from the margins of the interventricular communication (Figure 8.100). Even in the setting of bilateral infundibulums, the interventricular communication can still be perimembranous, as there can be continuity between the leaflets of the mitral and tricuspid valves (Figures 8.100, 8.101). When the ventriculoinfundibular fold is attenuated, the leaflets of one of the arterial valves are able to achieve fibrous continuity with an atrioventricular valve (Figure 8.99).

The final feature is the relationship of the muscular outlet septum to the other structures. When attached to the anterior limb of the septomarginal trabeculation, the defect is subaortic (Figures 8.98–8.101). When, in contrast, the outlet septum is attached to the ventriculoinfundibular fold, or to the posterior limb of the septomarginal trabeculation, the defect is placed beneath the left-sided great artery, which is almost always the pulmonary trunk (Figure 8.102). When the outlet septum is absent, the defect is doubly committed and juxta-arterial (Figure 8.103).

From this potential for variation, two groups of patients can be collected from

those having a double outlet from the right ventricle. The most frequent configuration is when the aortic valve is posterior and to the right of the pulmonary trunk (Figure 8.95), usually with the interventricular communication in a subaortic position (Figures 8.98–8.102). This arterial relationship can also be found with a doubly committed and juxtaarterial defect (Figure 8.103). The second group comprises hearts in which the aorta ascends parallel to the pulmonary trunk (Figure 8.96), usually with its valve in either an anterior or side-by-side position, and to the right relative to the pulmonary valve, and with the septal defect in a perimembranous or muscular but subpulmonary position (Figure 8.102). This is the Taussig-Bing variant<sup>46</sup>.

The surgeon should be particularly wary when the interventricular communication is non-committed <sup>47</sup>. Almost always, when it is subaortic, subpulmonary, or doubly committed, it is possible to place a patch within the right ventricle so as to channel the interventricular communication to one or the other outflow tract, thus achieving biventricular circulations. This may not

pathways are blocked by structures such as valvar tension apparatus (Figure 8.104). Anatomical non-commitment is most usually found when the interventricular

communication is between the ventricular inlets (Figure 8.104), or is the ventricular component of an atrioventricular septal defect in patients with a common

Fig. 8.101 In this specimen, seen in anatomical orientation, there is extensive fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the tricuspid and mitral valves, making the interventricular communication perimembranous despite the presence of bilateral infundibulums (black dotted line). Note that the subpulmonary infundibulum (black brace) is narrowed by a squeeze between the outlet septum and hypertrophied septoparietal trabeculations. Thus, the heart has the phenotypical features of tetralogy of Fallot in addition to a double-outlet connection and bilateral infundibulums. The star shows the interventricular communication.

atrioventricular junction (Figure 8.105). The surgeon may be able to overcome these impediments and still achieve biventricular repair48. In this situation, however, there may be arguments as to

whether the defect is truly non-committed (Figure 8.106). There is no question but that the defect is non-committed both anatomically and surgically when it is encased within the muscular septum and

opens into the inlet of the right ventricle (Figure 8.107).

It is also important for the surgeon to identify any other abnormalities in the extremely heterogeneous group of

malformations linked together because of a double-outlet ventriculoarterial connection. By far the most common set of anomalies relates to obstruction of the arterial outlets, such as infundibular

stenosis, valvar stenosis, coarctation, or interruption of the aortic arch. The presence of subpulmonary infundibular stenosis is a particularly frequent finding when the septal defect is subaortic, often producing the morphology of tetralogy of Fallot, even in the setting of bilateral infundibulums (Figure 8.101).

valve, are frequent accompaniments of the Taussig–Bing variant46. Common atrioventricular valves also occur in a significant number of cases. Unusual

coronary arterial anatomy, including the intramural arrangement, is found most frequently when the aorta is in an anterior or side-by-side position. In this situation, special consideration is needed when performing either a right ventriculotomy or an arterial switch procedure.

Fig. 8.108 The cartoon, illustrating a double-outlet right ventricle with a subaortic interventricular communication, shows the major components of the outflow tracts, and illustrates the salient surgical features relating to each individual muscular component. The conduction axis is shown in red, and the first septal perforating artery as the red dotted line. The ventriculoinfundibular fold is shown in green, the outlet septum in blue, and the septomarginal trabeculation in yellow.

Surgical and anatomical considerations for the potential corrective procedures relate to the particular combination of defects. It is possible, nonetheless, to establish some basic rules (Figure 8.108)<sup>49</sup> . The outlet septum, almost always present, serves as a guide to the arterial valves and

their relationships to each other, and to the interventricular communication. As described previously, in cases with subaortic defects the outlet septum usually inserts into the anterocephalad limb of the septomarginal trabeculation. With subpulmonary defects, it usually inserts

into the ventriculoinfundibular fold, or into the posterior part of the muscular ventricular septum. The outlet septum is always devoid of any vital structure, so it can be resected, or used as a secure site for anchorage of sutures. In contrast, the ventriculoinfundibular fold is not a solid

bar of muscle. Care must be taken to avoid extensive dissection or resection of this structure, as the right coronary artery lies within its fold.

Knowledge of the type of interventricular communication, as in isolated ventricular septal defects, will give accurate guidance to the disposition of the conduction tissue. Obstruction of the subpulmonary outflow tract requires the same attention to detail as when dealing with tetralogy of Fallot. Other cardiac anomalies will have to be dealt with in the context of the particular cardiac configuration present.

It may not have passed unnoticed that discussion thus far of the group of hearts unified because of their double-outlet ventriculoarterial connections has paid little attention to bilateral conuses. This is because, as explained in our introductory comments, we do not take this feature as an integral component of the group. To us, the term double outlet logically pictures a specific ventriculoarterial connection, and that is what we have described. The presence or absence of bilateral infundibular musculature depends simply on whether the ventriculoinfundibular fold interposes completely between the hinges

of the atrioventricular and arterial valvar leaflets, or is attenuated at some point to permit fibrous continuity between them. Either arrangement can exist when the ventriculoarterial connection is one of a double outlet.

A double outlet from the left ventricle is very much more rare than a double-outlet right ventricle. It can present with similar variations in the position of the arterial trunks, and their relationship to the interventricular communication, as we have described for the double-outlet right ventricle. As with the double-outlet right ventricle, the double-outlet left ventricle can be found with any atrioventricular connections. The rules for the disposition of the conduction tissue will thus change accordingly.

## **COMMON ARTERIAL TRUNK**

A common arterial trunk is one that supplies the systemic, pulmonary, and coronary arteries directly (Figure 8.109)<sup>50</sup>. The phenotypical feature of the lesion, however, is the commonality of the ventriculoarterial junction, which is guarded by a common arterial valve (Figure 8.110)<sup>51</sup>. In this way, the anomaly

is distinguished from the other types of ventriculoarterial connection producing a single outlet from the heart, namely a solitary aortic trunk with pulmonary atresia, a solitary pulmonary trunk with aortic atresia, or a solitary arterial trunk <sup>52</sup>. The presence of the common truncal valve also distinguishes the entity from hearts with a large aortopulmonary window, which can effectively produce a common intrapericardial arterial component.

While the difference between a common trunk and an aortopulmonary window is anatomical, the distinction between common and solitary arterial trunks is more semantic. We define an arterial trunk as being solitary rather than common when it is not possible to find any evidence of intrapericardial pulmonary arteries<sup>52</sup>. Description in this fashion resolves the controversy as to whether the pulmonary arteries, had they been present, would have arisen from the arterial trunk or from the heart (Figure 8.111). In patients with a solitary trunk as thus defined, it is the arterial supply to the pulmonary circulation that is the key to surgical treatment. Such patients are best considered along with tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia (see page 236; Figure 7.159).

![](_page_58_Figure_11.jpeg)

**Fig. 8.109** The specimen, shown in anatomical orientation, illustrates the essence of a common arterial trunk. A solitary trunk leaves the base of the heart and directly supplies the systemic, pulmonary, and coronary arteries.

![](_page_59_Picture_2.jpeg)

Fig. 8.110 The specimen, photographed in anatomical orientation, shows how the phenotypical feature of the common arterial trunk is the common ventriculoarterial junction, guarded in this heart by a valve with three leaflets. The common trunk is supported predominantly by the right ventricle, with a potentially restrictive interventricular communication (star).

![](_page_59_Picture_4.jpeg)

Fig. 8.111 The cartoon illustrates the dilemma in defining the nature of an arterial trunk in the absence of the intrapericardial pulmonary arteries (dotted channels). There is no way of knowing whether the pulmonary arteries, had they existed, would have originated directly from the heart (left-hand panel) or from the arterial trunk itself (right-hand panel). Had they originated from the heart, the patent arterial trunk would have been an aorta. Had the trunk itself given rise to atretic pulmonary arteries initially, however, it initially would have been a common trunk. In this situation, therefore, it is better to describe the arterial trunk simply as a solitary structure.

The anatomical features that underscore the options for, and success of, surgical treatment for a common arterial trunk are its connection to the ventricular mass, the state of the truncal valve, the morphology of the interventricular communication, the presence of associated anomalies, and the arrangement of the systemic and pulmonary arterial channels arising from the common trunk. The lesion can exist with any atrioventricular connection, but it is very rare to find other than concordant ones. The trunk itself usually overrides the ventricular septum, being more or less equally committed to the right and left ventricles (Figure 8.112), although it can take origin predominantly (Figure 8.110) or exclusively (Figure 8.113) from the morphologically right ventricle. When the trunk arises entirely from the right ventricle, problems can be produced should the interventricular communication

be restrictive. This problem does not occur when the trunk is committed predominantly or exclusively to the left ventricle. Right ventricular origin, however, is frequently associated with the presence of an atrioventricular septal defect and a common atrioventricular junction (Figure 8.114)53. This adds to the surgical complexity, because not only is the septal defect more distant from the arterial trunk, but the left ventricular component of the

common atrioventricular valve is trifoliate. The need to secure a competent left valve adds to the problems of surgical repair significantly.

The common ventriculoarterial junction, which is the essence of the common trunk, exists because of failure of septation of the developing outflow

tract54. Although the truncal valve can be supported by a complete infundibulum when it arises exclusively from the right ventricle (Figure 8.113),

![](_page_61_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 8.114** The heart, photographed from the front, the right ventricle having been opened, has a common arterial trunk supported exclusively by the right ventricle. The interventricular communication, however, is an atrioventricular septal defect. The bridging leaflets of the common atrioventricular valve are seen extending into the left ventricle. The left atrioventricular valve was trifoliate.

![](_page_61_Figure_4.jpeg)

**Fig. 8.115** This heart, shown in anatomical orientation as seen from the right ventricle, has a common arterial trunk overriding an interventricular communication with a muscular posteroinferior rim formed by fusion of the ventriculoinfundibular fold with the posterocaudal limb of the septomarginal trabeculation (SMT). The muscular rim protects the atrioventricular conduction axis. Note the fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the truncal and mitral valves in the roof of the left ventricle (black dotted line).

more usually the interventricular communication is directly juxta-arterial, and there is typically fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the truncal and mitral valves in the roof of the left ventricle (Figure 8.115). When viewed from the right ventricle, the septal defect is cradled between the limbs of the septomarginal trabeculation. In most patients, the posterocaudal limb of the trabeculation fuses with the ventriculoinfundibular fold to produce a

![](_page_62_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 8.116** This heart with a common arterial trunk, viewed in anatomical orientation, has an interventricular communication (star) that is perimembranous, with fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the truncal and tricuspid valves (black dotted line), because the ventriculoinfundibular fold stops short of the caudal limb of the septomarginal trabeculation (SMT). There is also fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the tricuspid and mitral valves. The atrioventricular conduction axis is at risk in the posteroinferior rim of the defect.

muscular posteroinferior rim (Figures 8.110, 8.112, 8.115). As with other defects of this type, the muscular structure thus formed serves to buttress the axis of atrioventricular conduction tissue from potential surgical damage. More rarely, there can be fibrous continuity between the truncal and tricuspid valves. The defect is thus perimembranous, and the conduction axis is much more at risk during closure when connecting the common trunk to the left ventricle (Figure 8.116). Should it be deemed necessary to enlarge a restrictive interventricular communication, this can be achieved by resecting along its anterosuperior margins (Figure 8.113). Sometimes, a second muscular defect coexists with the juxta-arterial defect. If present, such defects must be identified and closed. Cases have also been described in which the ventricular septum has been considered intact. This was because the leaflets of the truncal valve closed on the septal crest during ventricular diastole<sup>55</sup>. The juxta-arterial defect in this setting, however, is readily evident when the valvar leaflets open during diastole. It is possible to have a truly intact ventricular

septum should the arterial trunk arise exclusively from the right ventricle, and there is spontaneous closure of a pre-existing interventricular communication. The latter cases are unlikely to come to surgical attention.

After surgical repair of a common trunk following the Rastelli technique, the truncal valve effectively becomes the aortic valve. Valvar incompetence or stenosis, if present, is therefore of considerable significance. This typically reflects dysplasia of the leaflets (Figure 8.117). The truncal valve itself usually has three leaflets (Figure 8.118). Quadrifoliate valves are also relatively frequent, although the leaflets are often of unequal size (Figure 8.119). In such circumstances, the surgeon may choose to convert the valve into a trifoliate pattern<sup>56</sup>. Valves with two leaflets are also found.

There are two classifications currently in use for the description of the variations to be found in the arrangement of the pulmonary and systemic channels taking origin from the common trunk. Both employ procrustean numerical categorisations. The classical study of Collett and Edwards<sup>50</sup> was based on the mode of origin of the pulmonary arteries.

The possibilities initially described were for the arteries to arise from a short confluent channel, to arise separately and directly from the left posterior aspect of the trunk, or to arise separately from either side of the trunk. The initial classification also included a fourth category, but those fitting in this grouping are recognised as representing examples of tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia, with pulmonary arterial supply via systemic-to-pulmonary collateral arteries. The second classification was proposed by Van Praagh and Van Praagh<sup>57</sup>. They initially divided the cases into groups with or without an interventricular communication. As we have discussed, it is exceedingly rare to find patients having a common arterial trunk and an intact ventricular septum; therefore, it is their first group that is of most significance. They also described four subtypes, and grouped together the first two categorisations of Collett and Edwards, retaining the third grouping as their second type. The importance of their approach was that it highlighted cases with obstruction of the systemic circulation, identified as a fourth grouping, and also emphasised the possibility for a separate origin of discontinuous pulmonary arteries,

with one fed by a persistently patent arterial duct, which could then become ligamentous, these examples making up their third group. Van Praagh and Van Praagh<sup>57</sup>, however, also pointed out that the overall collection of patients with a common arterial trunk could be divided into those with aortic as opposed to

pulmonary dominance within the trunk itself. It is this notion of aortic as opposed to pulmonary dominance that simplifies categorisation and description<sup>51</sup>,

recognising that on rare occasions it may be possible to find patients in which the intrapericardial common trunk divides into aortic and pulmonary components of

comparable dimensions. In most instances, it is the aortic component of the trunk that is dominant. The pulmonary arteries usually arise adjacent to one another from

the leftwards component of the trunk (Figures 8.120, 8.121). If there is a confluent pulmonary component, it is usually very short (Figures 8.122, 8.123).

![](_page_65_Picture_2.jpeg)

Fig. 8.121 The computed tomographic angiogram, viewed from above, shows how, in the setting of common arterial trunks, the pulmonary arteries usually arise adjacent to one another from the leftwards and posterior component of the trunk (white doubleheaded arrow). Note the crossing of the left pulmonary artery (LPA) over the origin of the right pulmonary artery (RPA). This is exaggerated when the pulmonary arteries take a more anterior origin (see Figure 8.124).

![](_page_65_Picture_4.jpeg)

Fig. 8.122 In this example of a common arterial trunk, the pulmonary arteries take origin from a small confluent component arising from the leftwards and posterior part of the common trunk, which itself predominantly supplies the systemic circulation. The interventricular communication (star) is perimembranous, as there is fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the truncal and tricuspid valves (black dotted line), reinforced by a membranous flap (arrow).

The pulmonary arteries can arise more anteriorly, and are typically crossed at their origins (Figure 8.124). More rarely, the pulmonary arteries can arise within a truncal valvar sinus (Figure 8.117)<sup>58</sup> , or can take separate origins from the posterior component of the dominant aortic trunk (Figure 8.118). All of these patterns facilitate connection to a right ventricular conduit during complete repair. The less

common pulmonary dominant trunk is found when the aortic component of the trunk is hypoplastic, in association with either coarctation or interruption of the aortic arch (Figures 8.125, 8.126). It is in

pulmonary arteries arise from the anterior part of the trunk, which is aortic dominant. The left and right pulmonary arteries cross as they extend towards the hilums of the lungs (red arrows).

this arrangement that the pulmonary arteries arise from the sides of the trunk, which continues through a persistently patent arterial duct to feed the descending aorta51. On occasion, however, the

pulmonary arteries can be crossed when there is pulmonary dominance (Figure 8.127). The cases with pulmonary dominance produce greater problems for surgical correction. Apart from these

cases, or when the pulmonary arteries are discontinuous, with one fed via an arterial duct, it is rare to find persistence of the duct. It is in the instances where there is persistence of the duct that the

Fig. 8.125 In this heart, the pulmonary component of the common arterial trunk is dominant (red double-headed arrow). It gives rise to the arterial duct, and to the right and left pulmonary arteries (RPA, LPA), the latter arising from the sides of the pulmonary component. The aortic component of the trunk is grossly hypoplastic, supplying the right common carotid artery (RCCA), but then interrupted beyond the origin of the left common carotid artery (LCCA). There is a retro-oesophageal origin of the right subclavian artery (RSCA), which arises from the descending aorta along with the left subclavian artery (LSCA), the descending aorta itself being fed by the arterial duct.

It shows crossing of the pulmonary arteries as they arise from the posterior aspect of the common trunk. Note the right and left pulmonary arteries that have been banded (white arrows), and the stented arterial duct, which feeds the descending aorta in the setting of the interrupted aortic arch.

systemic and pulmonary components are more balanced as they divide from the common trunk within the pericardial cavity.

The surgeon should also take care to identify the origins of the coronary arteries<sup>59</sup>. When the truncal valve has four sinuses, then the arteries typically arise from the right- and left-sided sinuses. There is less uniformity when, as is most frequently the case, the truncal root has three sinuses. It is unusual, nonetheless, for coronary arteries to arise from the anterior sinus<sup>60</sup>. Solitary coronary arteries are frequent<sup>59</sup>. When there are two coronary arteries, the left coronary artery often takes an origin above the sinutubular junction, which on occasion can be very high, with transmural passage through the truncal wall (Figure 8.128). The left coronary artery can also be closely related to the origin of the pulmonary arteries, particularly when the pulmonary arteries themselves take a truncal origin (Figure 8.117). In all these settings, the coronary arteries are at risk if unrecognised when the surgeon separates the pulmonary arteries from the common trunk.

# Concordant ventriculoarterial connections with parallel arterial trunks

Hearts with this combination do not necessarily have abnormal segmental combinations, because if the atrioventricular connections are concordant, the segmental junctions will be normal despite the unexpected relationships of the arterial trunks. It is also the case that patients with this arrangement will be exceedingly rare, and it is possible that the unusual position of the aorta could go unnoticed. The same arrangement at the ventriculoarterial junctions, nonetheless, can be found with all the other possibilities for atrioventricular connections: thus it is appropriate to consider the combinations in a separate section of this chapter, the more so as they have been remarkably difficult to understand. They are also currently described with the most arcane of terminologies by some, including such spectacular phrases as isolated ventricular inversion, and anatomically corrected malposition. The essence of understanding is to appreciate that, although the arterial

trunks arise from the morphologically appropriate ventricles, they extend towards the mediastinum in parallel rather than spiralling fashion<sup>61,62</sup>. It is necessary, therefore, to appreciate that the direction of spiralling should be related to the topology of the ventricular mass, and not the position of the atrial chambers, the latter being the approach taken by those who produce terms such as isolated ventricular inversion.

Thus, in the normal heart, the pulmonary trunk, as it emerges from the right ventricle, spirals in counter-clockwise fashion around the aortic root as the pulmonary arteries extend into the hilums (Figure 8.129). In the mirror-imaged arrangement, when there is left-hand ventricular topology, the pulmonary trunk spirals around the aortic root in clockwise fashion (Figure 8.130). In the arrangement of parallel trunks found with concordant atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial connections and the usual atrial arrangement, the aorta arises from the ventricular mass in a left-sided and anterior position (Figure 8.131). In most instances, the aortic valve is also supported within the

left ventricle by a complete muscular infundibulum (Figure 8.132). It is not essential, however, for there to be discontinuity between the leaflets of the aortic and the atrioventricular valves. It is the insistence of the presence of bilateral infundibulums that creates the need to invent the arcane terms like isolated

ventricular inversion. We can illustrate the simplicity of recognising parallel but concordantly connected arterial trunks by reference to the arrangement as seen in the

presence of a double-inlet left ventricle. In the most common variant of a doubleinlet left ventricle with concordant ventriculoarterial connections, the lesion known as the Holmes heart, the pulmonary trunk, arising from the incomplete right ventricle, spirals around the aortic root in counter-clockwise fashion, as in the normal heart (Figure 8.133). In the variant with concordant connections but parallel arterial trunks, although rare, the incomplete right ventricle is usually left-sided. The pulmonary trunk is thus also left-sided, but enters the mediastinum in parallel fashion to the arterial trunk, rather than

spiralling as would be expected were there normal but mirror-imaged relations (Figure 8.134). Furthermore, the leaflets of the aortic valve, arising from the dominant

left ventricle, are usually in fibrous continuity with the leaflets of the atrioventricular valves (Figure 8.135). A similar arrangement can be found when the incomplete right ventricle is right-sided, the pulmonary trunk then entering the mediastinum in a right-sided position parallel to the aorta. These patterns can also

with a double-inlet right ventricle, although we are not aware of any such descriptions.

Perhaps the most important subset of patients with concordantly connected but parallel arterial trunks are those with discordant atrioventricular connections. This arrangement is a close cousin to congenitally corrected transposition, as

The atrioventricular connections are discordant, but the aorta arises from the morphologically left ventricle, with infundibular musculature interposed between the leaflets of the aortic and mitral valves. Because of the discordant atrioventricular connections, the conduction axis is anterior to the arterial valve (red star), and descends (red dotted line) cephalad relative to the perimembranous ventricular septal defect (white star) . The combination of discordant atrioventricular and concordant ventriculoarterial connections produces the haemodynamics of transposition, but correction with an atrial redirection procedure will restore the morphologically left ventricle to a systemic role.

discussed earlier in this chapter. The combination of discordant connections at the atrioventricular junction, but concordant ventriculoarterial connections, produces the haemodynamics of transposition. In addition, as in the usual

form of transposition, the aorta is typically anterior and right-sided. It is important, however, to recognise that there is lefthand topology (Figure 8.136) in this setting, as the optimal therapeutic approach is to perform an atrial redirection

procedure, thus restoring the morphologically left ventricle to its appropriate systemic role. It is also important, of course, to recognise and deal with any associated malformations, such as a ventricular septal defect (Figure 8.137).

Because the atrioventricular connections are discordant in this combination, the conducting tissue will arise from an anomalous anterolateral node, and descend anterocephalad relative to the expected perimembranous defect (Figure 8.137). In such hearts, there may be a subaortic infundibulum, but the presence of fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the aortic and mitral valves in the roof of the morphologically left ventricle in no way alters the diagnosis. Indeed, the hearts with concordant ventriculoarterial connections but parallel arterial trunks are exemplary in serving to demonstrate the importance of analysing, separately, the arterial relationships and infundibular morphology from the origin of the aterial trunks from the ventricular mass.
