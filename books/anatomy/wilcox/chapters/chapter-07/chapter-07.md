### SEPTAL DEFECTS

Understanding the anatomy of septal defects is greatly facilitated if the heart is thought of as having three distinct septal structures: the atrial septum. the atrioventricular septum, and the ventricular septum (Figure 7.1). The normal atrial septum is relatively small. It is made up, for the most part, by the floor of the oval fossa. When viewed from the right atrial aspect, the fossa has a floor, surrounded by rims. The floor is derived from the primary atrial septum, or septum primum. Although often considered to represent a secondary septum, or septum secundum, the larger parts of the rims, specifically the superior, anterosuperior, and posterior components, are formed by infoldings of the adjacent right and left atrial walls. Inferoanteriorly, in contrast, the rim of the fossa is a true muscular septum (Figure 7.2). This part of the rim is contiguous with the atrioventricular septum, which is the superior component of the fibrous membranous septum. In the normal heart, this fibrous septum is also contiguous with the atrial wall of the

triangle of Koch (Figure 7.3). In the past, we considered this component of the atrial wall, which overlaps the upper part of the ventricular musculature between the attachments of the leaflets of the tricuspid and mitral valves, as the muscular atrioventricular septum. As we discussed in Chapter 2, we now know that it is better viewed as a sandwich<sup>1</sup>. This is because, throughout the floor of the triangle of Koch, the fibroadipose tissue of the inferior atrioventricular groove separates the layers of atrial and ventricular myocardium (Figure 7.4). From the stance of understanding septal defects, nonetheless, it is helpful to consider the entire area comprising the fibrous septum and the muscular sandwich as an atrioventricular separating structure, as it is absent in the hearts we describe as having atrioventricular septal defects.

The ventricular septum is usually seen by the surgeon only from its right ventricular aspect. For this and other reasons we will discuss, holes between the ventricles are best considered in terms of their right ventricular landmarks. Taken overall, the ventricular septum is made up of a small fibrous element, specifically the interventricular part of the membranous septum, and a much larger muscular part. The muscular part. which is significantly curved, is more complex geometrically than the other septal structures, which lie almost completely in the coronal plane. At first sight, it seems possible to divide the muscular septum into inlet, apical trabecular, and outlet components, each of these parts seemingly corresponding with the components of the right ventricle, and abutting centrally on the membranous septum (Figure 7.5). Closer inspection shows that such analysis is simplistic. By virtue of the deeply wedged location of the subaortic outflow tract, much of the septum delimited on the right ventricular aspect by the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve separates the inlet of the right ventricle from the outlet of the left (Figure 7.6). The muscular wall forming the back of the subpulmonary infundibulum is, at first sight, an outlet septum. Only a small part of this wall, however, interposes between the cavities of the right and left ventricles. This is because most of the subpulmonary infundibulum is a freestanding muscular sleeve, which forms part

**Fig. 7.1** The four-chamber section through the heart, in anatomical orientation, shows the atrial and ventricular septal components, along with the location of the muscular structures that separate the cavities of the right atrium and left ventricle. We had previously considered the latter area to be an atrioventricular (AV) muscular septum. We now recognise it to be a sandwich of fibroadipose tissue, located between the layers of atrial and ventricular musculature (see Figure 7.3). It is this area that is deficient in the setting of a common atrioventricular junction. Note also that the superior rim of the oval fossa (arrow) is an infolding between the right and left atrial walls.

Sup. Fig. 7.2 The heart has been sectioned in the four-chamber plane, showing that the superior rim of the oval fossa is a deep infolding (arrow) between the origin of the superior caval vein from the right atrium (red star), and the entry of the right superior pulmonary vein into the left atrium (white star). It is the floor of the oval fossa, along with the anteroinferior muscular buttress, which are the components of the atrial septum.

of the supraventricular crest (Figure 7.7). The small septal component interposing between the ventricular outlets is inextricably linked with the more extensive component of the crest, the

ventriculoinfundibular fold, or inner heart curvature (Figure 7.8). It is the muscular wall separating the apical trabecular components, therefore, which forms the greater part of the muscular ventricular

septum. This part extends to the apex in curvilinear fashion, reflecting the interrelationships of the banana-shaped right ventricle and the conical left ventricle. Reinforcing the right ventricular aspect of

Note the adipose tissue interposed between the right atrial wall and the crest of the ventricular septum, which forms the 'meat' in the atrioventricular muscular sandwich.

Fig. 7.5 The dissection, seen in anatomical orientation, shows how the ventricular septum can be separated from the remainder of the heart, and divided into fibrous and muscular parts. The muscular part has been further divided into segments corresponding to the components of the right ventricle. Apart from the apical part, however, these parts of the right ventricle do not correlate with comparable components on the left side of the heart.

this part of the septum is the septomarginal trabeculation, or septal band. This muscular strap has a body and limbs, the latter extending to the base of the heart to clasp the supraventricular crest. A series of septoparietal trabeculations extend from its anterocephalad surface and reach the parietal ventricular wall. One of these, the

moderator band, is particularly prominent. It crosses from the septomarginal trabeculation to join the anterior papillary muscle (Figure 7.9).

**Fig. 7.8** The dissection, seen in anatomical orientation, shows how most of the supraventricular crest is formed by the ventriculoinfundibular fold. Only a small part of crest, where it inserts between the limbs of the septomarginal trabeculation (star), can be removed so as to provide a communication with the left ventricle. The area has no obvious anatomical boundaries. Note that the distal part of the crest becomes continuous with the free-standing muscular infundibular sleeve.

**Fig. 7.9** The septal surface of the right ventricle has been displayed by making a window in the anterior wall to show the septomarginal trabeculation, or septal band (black Y). The supraventricular crest inserts between its basal limbs. The moderator band takes origin from the apical part of its body, crossing the cavity of the ventricle to become continuous with the anterior papillary muscle. The band is but one of a series of septoparietal trabeculations that arise from the anterior margin of the major septomarginal trabeculation.

### Interatrial communications

There are several lesions that permit interatrial shunting (Figure 7.10). Although collectively termed atrial septal defects, not all are within the confines of

the normal atrial septum<sup>1</sup>. Only the holes within the floor of the oval fossa<sup>2</sup>, and the much more rare vestibular defects found within the muscular anteroinferior buttress<sup>3</sup>, are true

deficiencies of the septal components (Figure 7.2). The ostium primum defect is the consequence of deficient atrioventricular septation. Its cardinal feature is the commonality of the

**Fig. 7.10** The cartoon shows the various holes that permit interatrial shunting. Only the holes in the oval fossa and the rare vestibular defects are true deficiencies of atrial septal structures.

atrioventricular junction<sup>4</sup>. It will be considered in our next section. Sinus venosus defects, representing an anomalous connection of a pulmonary vein, which has retained its left atrial connection<sup>5</sup>, are found at the mouths of the caval veins<sup>5–8</sup>. The rare defect found at the mouth of the coronary sinus is the consequence of the disappearance of the muscular walls that usually separate the component of the coronary sinus running through the left atrioventricular junction from the cavity of the left atrium<sup>9</sup>.

Defects within the oval fossa are often called secundum defects. Because they represent persistence of the secondary atrial foramen, rather than deficiencies of the secondary atrial septum, they should properly be called ostium secundum defects. We prefer to consider them as defects within the oval fossa. They are, by far, the most common type of interatrial communication. They can be caused by deficiency (Figure 7.11), perforation (Figure 7.12), or absence (Figure 7.13) of the floor of the fossa. The floor is formed by the flap valve of the oval foramen, itself derived from the primary atrial septum. When the haemodynamics of the shunt across such a defect dictate surgical closure, the hole is rarely likely to be small enough

to permit direct suture. Now, all but very large defects within the oval fossa are likely to be closed by the interventional cardiologist. If attempts are made to close, directly, defects large enough to justify surgical intervention, the results may so distort atrial anatomy as to result in dehiscence. Irrespective of the size of the septal deficiency, it is always possible to secure a patch to the margins of the oval fossa. When placing sutures, the likeliest potential danger relative to the rims is to the artery supplying the sinus node (Figure 7.14). This artery can course intramyocardially through the anterior margin of the oval fossa, or lie deep within the superior interatrial fold. There is also a remote chance of damaging the aorta when placing stitches anteriorly, as this part of the rim is related on its epicardial aspect to the aortic root (Figures 7.14, 7.15). On occasion, deficiency of the posteroinferior rims of the oval fossa permits holes within the fossa to extend into the mouth of the inferior caval vein (Figure 7.16). In these circumstances, care must be taken not to mistake a well-formed Eustachian valve for the posteroinferior margin of the defect. A patch attached to the Eustachian valve would connect the inferior caval vein to the left atrium. It is always prudent, therefore,

to ensure continuity of the inferior caval vein and right atrium following placement of a patch used to close a deficiency of the floor of the oval fossa.

Sinus venosus defects are more rare than defects within the oval fossa, and present greater problems in repair. The defect adjacent to the inferior caval vein (Figure 7.17) is relatively rare<sup>5</sup>. It opens into the mouth of the inferior caval vein posterior to the confines of the oval fossa. Usually the fossa itself is intact, but it can be deficient or probe patent. The essence of the defect is an anomalous connection of the right inferior pulmonary vein to the inferior caval vein, the pulmonary vein retaining its left atrial connection<sup>5</sup>. It is much more frequent to find sinus venosus defects adjacent to the mouth of the superior caval vein<sup>6,8</sup>. These defects, again, are due to an anomalous connection of one or more of the right pulmonary veins to the superior caval vein, the pulmonary veins retaining their left atrial connection<sup>6</sup>. The defects are outside the confines of the oval fossa, and hence are interatrial communications rather than atrial septal defects (Figure 7.18)<sup>1,2</sup>.

When sinus venosus defects are found in relation to the superior caval vein, the orifice of the vein usually overrides the

superior rim of the oval fossa (Figures 7.19, 7.20). More rarely, such defects can be found when the caval vein is committed exclusively to the right atrium (Figure 7.21)<sup>6</sup>. All the defects are

associated with anomalous connections of the right superior pulmonary veins, which drain into the superior caval vein (Figures 7.22, 7.23), often through more than one orifice (Figure 7.19), while retaining their left atrial connection (Figure 7.20). The difficulty encountered during surgical repair reflects the need to reconstruct the anatomy so as to reroute the venous return and, at the same time, close

the interatrial communication. This must be done without obstructing venous flow or, in the case of a superior defect, damaging the sinus node. The sinus node is related to the anterolateral quadrant of the cavoatrial junction. It lays immediately subepicardially within the terminal groove (Figure 7.23). Its location should be considered both when making the atriotomy, and when placing sutures in the atrial walls. Problems arise should it be necessary either to suture in the area of the

node when rerouting the pulmonary venous return, or if there is need to enlarge the orifice of the caval vein. The former risk can be minimised with judicious superficial placement of the sutures. The latter problem is much greater. Because the

artery to the sinus node may pass either in front of or behind the caval vein, the entire cavoatrial junction is a potentially dangerous area. Incisions across the cavoatrial junction carry a high risk of damaging the artery, or even the node

itself. Should it be deemed necessary to cut across the junction, a much better option is to perform the Warden operation <sup>10</sup>. This involves detaching the superior caval vein, and reattaching it to the excised tip of the right atrial appendage <sup>11</sup>.

Another defect that permits interatrial shunting, but which is outside the confines of the true atrial septum, is part of a constellation of lesions termed unroofing of the coronary sinus (Figure 7.24)<sup>9</sup>. In this setting, a persistent left superior caval vein

Fig. 7.17 The specimen, viewed in anatomical orientation, shows the features of an inferior sinus venosus defect. The margins of the oval fossa are intact.

usually drains directly to the left atrial roof (Figure 7.25), entering the chamber between the appendage and the left pulmonary veins. Because of the unroofing of the coronary sinus into the cavity of the left atrium, the mouth of the coronary sinus functions as an

interatrial communication (Figure 7.26). Evidence is frequently seen of the walls of the coronary sinus and left atrium along the anticipated course of the left superior caval vein into and through the left atrioventricular groove (Figure 7.24).

Sometimes the mouth of the coronary sinus can seem to open normally to the right atrium, but in the absence of its component usually occupying the left atrioventricular groove, and without persistence of a left superior caval vein draining to the left atrial

roof. In this setting, the left ventricular coronary veins drain directly into the cavity of the left atrium. In these circumstances, the mouth of the coronary sinus again functions as an interatrial communication. This lesion is the extreme form of the spectrum of

fenestration of the walls of the coronary sinus, providing communications with the cavity of the left atrium (see Chapter 9).

Surgical treatment of interatrial communications through the mouth of the coronary sinus is dictated by the presence,

and connections, of the left superior caval vein. If it is present, and in free communication with the right superior caval vein, or if there is no left-sided superior caval vein, the mouth of the coronary sinus can simply be closed. If the

right atrial mouth of the sinus is to be closed, decisions must be made concerning the treatment of the left superior caval vein. In the presence of an adequate venous channel communicating with the brachiocephalic vein, the left caval vein can be ligated. If, in contrast, the left-sided

channel has no anastomoses with the right side, consideration should be given to construction of a left-sided cavopulmonary anastomosis, the Glenn shunt. Alternatively, a channel can be constructed

along the posteroinferior wall of the left atrium, connecting the left atrial opening of the left-sided vein with the mouth of the coronary sinus.

absent because the unifying feature of the group is the commonality of the atrioventricular junction (Figure 7.27)<sup>4</sup>. The optimal title for the group, therefore, would be atrioventricular septal defect with common atrioventricular junction. This is

because, on rare occasions, defects of the membranous atrioventricular septum can be found in the setting of separate right and left atrioventricular junctions. These defects, first described by Gerbode and colleagues<sup>13</sup>, and often called Gerbode

defects, can take two forms. The more frequent variant exists when shunting across a ventricular septal defect enters the right atrium through a deficient tricuspid valve (Figure 7.28). The more rare variant is a true deficiency of the atrioventricular

component of the membranous septum (Figures 7.29–7.32)14. The key to differentiating the true defects from those involving passage via a deficient ventricular septum is to demonstrate the competence of the tricuspid valve (Figure 7.32).

Although atrioventricular septal defects do exist in the form of the Gerbode defect

right and left atrioventricular junctions (compare Figures 7.27 and 7.33).

Because of the lack of the membranous and muscular atrioventricular structures,

there is no septal atrioventricular junction. Instead, the leading edges of the atrial septum and the ventricular septum, the latter usually covered by the

atrioventricular valvar leaflets, meet at the superior and inferior margins of the common atrioventricular junction (Figure 7.34). These meeting points of the septal structures typically divide the common junction into more-or-less equal right and left sides. An eccentric location of

the septal structures relative to the junction produces ventricular imbalance, or a double-outlet atrium.

It is the overall anatomy produced by the common atrioventricular junction that distorts the disposition of the atrioventricular conduction axis. An

analogue of the triangle of Koch can be seen within the leading edge of the atrial septum15. Because of the common atrioventricular junction, however, the atrial septal myocardium makes contact with the ventricular myocardium only superiorly and inferiorly (Figure 7.34).

Fig. 7.34 The specimen, seen in anatomical orientation, has been prepared to show the right side of the heart with deficient atrioventricular septation and separate right and left atrioventricular orifices, the lesion also known as an ostium primum defect. It is the conjoined bridging leaflets that produce the separate valvar orifices. The septal defect occupies the site of the normal atrioventricular separating structures. Note that the atrial septum itself is virtually normal, and the oval fossa is intact, although the leading edge of the septum is bowed from the atrioventricular junction in the margin of the septal defect. The stars show how the meeting points of the septal structures divide the common junction into its right and left sides.

Usually the atrioventricular node is displaced inferiorly. It typically lies in a nodal triangle, but not the triangle of Koch. When seen by the surgeon, the nodal triangle has the coronary sinus at its base, with the atrial septum to the left-hand side, and the attachment of the leaflets of the

effectively common atrioventricular valve to the right-hand side (Figures 7.35, 7.36). The atrioventricular conduction axis penetrates the apex of the triangle. It then courses on the crest of the muscular ventricular septum, covered by the inferior bridging leaflet of the atrioventricular valve

(Figure 7.37). The proximity of the coronary sinus to the apex of the nodal triangle is pertinent to surgical closure of the septal defect. Ideally, the surgeon will place a patch so as to leave the coronary sinus draining to the systemic venous atrium. The best option is to deviate the

but place the suture line within the mouth of the coronary sinus so as to reach the edge of the atrial septum (yellow line in Figure 7.35). The safety of this approach depends on the margin between the

mouth of the coronary sinus and the apex of the nodal triangle (compare Figures 7.35 and 7.36). A further alternative is to keep the suture line to the right of the mouth of the coronary sinus,

placing the sinus to the left of the atrial patch (blue lines in Figures 7.35 and 7.36). Occasionally, the inferior portion of the atrial septum itself can be deficient. The coronary sinus then opens more posteriorly and medially through the left

atrial wall. The conduction axis, however, follows the course of the muscular ventricular septum, with the node formed at the site of its union with the inferior atrioventricular junction (Figure 7.38)<sup>16</sup> .

The feature that distinguishes between the various forms of atrioventricular septal defects is the morphology of the leaflets of the atrioventricular valve that guard the common atrioventricular junction, together with their relationship to the

**Fig. 7.39** This atrioventricular septal defect, positioned anatomically and viewed from above, and with a common valvar orifice, has been dissected to show the arrangement of the five leaflets that guard the common atrioventricular junction. The white double-headed arrow shows the zone of apposition between the two bridging leaflets.

septal structures bordering the defect<sup>17</sup>. In any heart that lacks the separating atrioventricular structures, the common atrioventricular valve has five leaflets. The arrangement is seen most readily when the valve itself has a common orifice (Figure 7.39). Two of the leaflets extend across the ventricular septum, with their tension apparatus attached in both ventricles. These are the superior and inferior bridging leaflets. Two other leaflets are contained entirely within the right ventricle. They are the anterosuperior and inferior mural leaflets. The fifth leaflet is contained exclusively within the left ventricle, and is also a mural leaflet. Although the two leaflets found within the right ventricle are comparable to similar leaflets of the tricuspid valve seen in the normal heart, the left ventricular leaflets of the common atrioventricular valve (Figure 7.40) bear no resemblance to a normal mitral valve. In the normal mitral valve, found with separate atrioventricular junctions, the ends of the solitary zone of apposition between the leaflets, and the papillary muscles supporting them, are situated inferoanteriorly and superoposteriorly within the left ventricle (Figure 7.41). With this arrangement, the

extensive mural leaflet guards two-thirds of the circumference of the valvar orifice. The left ventricular outflow tract then interposes between the aortic leaflet of the mitral valve and the ventricular septal surface. In atrioventricular septal defects with a common atrioventricular junction, in contrast, the left ventricular papillary muscles are deviated laterally, being positioned superiorly and inferiorly <sup>12,17</sup>. Because of this, the mural leaflet is relatively insignificant, and guards much less than one-third of the circumference of the left atrioventricular orifice. The left orifice, in effect, is guarded by a valve possessing three leaflets, these being the small mural leaflet, and the more extensive left ventricular components of the superior and inferior bridging leaflets (Figure 7.42).

It had originally been suggested by Rastelli and colleagues<sup>18</sup> that the common valve possessed four rather than five leaflets. They argued that the differing morphology to be found in the setting of a common valvar orifice reflected the morphology of the anterior common leaflet, which is now usually described as the superior bridging leaflet. In the arrangement they described as Type A, they considered the anterior common

leaflet to be divided, with the two components both attached to the ventricular septum. They considered their Type B variant again to have a divided anterior common leaflet, but with both parts attached to an anomalous papillary muscle in the right ventricle. In their Type C malformation, they interpreted the arrangement in terms of an undivided common anterior leaflet, which was freefloating and attached in the right ventricle to an apical papillary muscle. In reality, the purported division of the anterior common leaflet is the site of coaptation between the right ventricular part of the superior bridging leaflet and the anterosuperior leaflet of the right ventricle (Figure 7.43). In the Rastelli Type A variant, the point of coaptation is supported by the medial papillary muscle of the right ventricle. The variation noted by Rastelli and his colleagues<sup>18</sup> is then readily explained on the basis of increased commitment of the superior bridging leaflet to the right ventricle, with concomitant diminution in size of the anterosuperior leaflet of the right ventricle (Figure 7.44). As the superior bridging leaflet becomes increasingly committed to the right ventricle, its site of coaptation with the anterosuperior leaflet

**Fig. 7.40** This operative view through a right atriotomy shows the typical trifoliate formation of the left atrioventricular valve in a heart with a deficient atrioventricular septation and common atrioventricular junction. It bears no resemblance to the formation of the leaflets as seen in the normal mitral valve. Note the extensive zone of apposition between the two leaflets that bridge the ventricular septum (dashed white double-headed arrow).

moves towards the right ventricular apex (Figures 7.45, 7.46)<sup>17</sup>. A further difference between the hearts at either end of the spectrum identified by Rastelli and colleagues<sup>18</sup> is that, with minimal bridging, the superior bridging leaflet is tethered by cords to the crest of the ventricular septum (Figure 7.43). With extreme commitment of the supporting papillary muscle to the right ventricle, in contrast, the superior bridging leaflet is always free-floating. The variation noted by Rastelli and colleagues reflected the changing morphology of the superior bridging leaflet. There is also variation in the arrangement of the inferior bridging leaflet. This does not, however, reflect its commitment to the two ventricles, which is usually balanced. The leaflet is often divided along the inferior edge of the ventricular septum, with the attachments of the two components providing a relatively clear zone of separation. The edges are most frequently attached to the septal crest, but there can be a ventricular component to the defect through intercordal spaces. Such potential for shunting beneath the inferior bridging leaflet is almost always found when the superior bridging leaflet is free-floating.

It is the morphology of the bridging leaflets themselves that accounts for much

of the remaining variability in atrioventricular septal defects with a common atrioventricular junction. The overall valvar morphology is comparable in all hearts with this specific phenotype. The variability depends on the relationship of the two bridging leaflets to each other, or their relationships, on the one hand, to the lower edge of the atrial septum and, on the other hand, to the crest of the muscular ventricular septum. If these two features are described separately, there is no need to use terms such as 'complete', 'partial', and 'intermediate' when seeking to subdivide the group. It is the use of these terms that, in the past, has created most confusion in description. From the surgical stance, if it is possible to visualise a bare area at the midportion of the ventricular septal crest; this would constitute a complete lesion. If the crest of the septum is covered by a tongue of tissue that joins the bridging leaflets together, then the lesion is considered either partial or intermediate. The intermediate variant is characterised by the presence of shunting at both atrial and ventricular levels, but with separate valvar orifices within the common atrioventricular junction.

The partial variant, with no ventricular shunting, is also well described as the

ostium primum variant. The bridging leaflets are joined to each other along the crest of the ventricular septum by a connecting tongue of leaflet tissue (Figure 7.47). The essence of the ostium primum defect, therefore, is the presence of separate valvar orifices for the right and left ventricles within the common atrioventricular junction. Because the heart of necessity possesses a common atrioventricular iunction, the left valve has three leaflets, with an extensive zone of apposition between the left ventricular components of the superior and inferior bridging leaflets. This area, in the past, was frequently described as a cleft. It has no morphological similarity to the cleft found in the aortic leaflet of the mitral valve in hearts with normal atrioventricular septation and separate right and left atrioventricular junctions<sup>19</sup>. It is necessary surgically to close part, or all, of this zone of apposition when repairing ostium primum defects (Figure 7.48). The resulting closure, nonetheless, does not recreate a leaflet comparable to the aortic leaflet of the normal mitral valve (Figure 7.49).

Fig. 7.42 This view of the left atrioventricular valve and the outflow tract in a heart with an atrioventricular septal defect is taken in comparable fashion to the normal heart seen in Figure 7.41, showing the short axis of the left ventricle. Note that the left valve in the heart with deficient atrioventricular septation has three leaflets, with papillary muscles positioned directly superiorly and inferiorly, rather than being obliquely positioned as in the normal heart. There is an extensive zone of apposition between the bridging leaflets (dashed white double-headed arrow). Note also the way that the outflow tract is squeezed between the superior bridging leaflet and the superior margin of the left ventricle (star).

Fig. 7.43 The image shows the location of the line of coaptation between the superior bridging and anterosuperior leaflet of the common atrioventricular valve as seen from the atrial aspect in an atrioventricular septal defect with a common valvar orifice (white arrow). This arrangement, with minimal bridging of the superior leaflet, produces the so-called 'Rastelli Type A' malformation. The star shows the atrial component of the septal defect. Note that there is the potential for multiple shunts through intercordal spaces to occur at the ventricular level beneath the superior bridging leaflet. Note also the presence of anterosuperior and inferior leaflets in the right ventricle. The white arrow shows the zone of apposition between the leftward margin of the anterosuperior leaflet and the right ventricular component of the superior bridging leaflet. It is a mistake to consider this arrangement to represent a divided common anterior leaflet.

It shows the spectrum of bridging of the superior leaflet in hearts with an atrioventricular septal defect and common orifice that underlies the classification introduced by Rastelli and his colleagues<sup>18</sup>. As the superior bridging leaflet (pink) extends further into the right ventricle, there is concomitant diminution in size of the anterosuperior leaflet (pink, crosshatched), and fusion of the anterior and medial papillary muscles of the right ventricle, which increasingly are attached towards the right ventricular apex.

features, depend upon the relationship of the bridging leaflets to the septal structures<sup>4</sup>. When there is a common valvar orifice, it is extremely rare for the

leaflets to be attached directly to the crest of the ventricular septum, although the extent of their tethering by tendinous cords can vary markedly. When the bridging leaflets lack direct attachments to the septal structures, the potential exists for shunting at both atrial and ventricular levels, the magnitude of the shunts depending on the

Fig. 7.45 The image is taken in the same orientation as in Figure 7.43. It shows how, in the Rastelli Type B variant of the common valvar orifice, the line of coaptation between the superior bridging leaflet and the anterosuperior leaflet of the right ventricle (white arrow) is displaced into the right ventricle. The papillary muscle supporting the zone of coaptation has moved down the ventricular septum towards the apex of the right ventricle. The anterosuperior leaflet itself is smaller than in the Rastelli Type A variant, but there is also an inferior leaflet in the right ventricle, displaced upwards because of the opened right atrioventricular junction. The star shows the atrioventricular septal defect.

prevailing haemodynamic conditions, together with the extent of the tethering. If the leaflets are firmly attached to the ventricular septum, shunting will be

confined at atrial level. This is the arrangement found most frequently in the typical ostium primum defect, with separate right and left valvar orifices within

the common junction, but with both bridging leaflets firmly fused to the crest of the ventricular septum (Figure 7.50). Much less frequently, the bridging leaflets

This is because a tongue of leaflet tissue (star) joins together the facing surfaces of the bridging leaflets (compare with Fig. 7.39).

produces the true ventricular septal defect of atrioventricular canal variety, as the valve guarding the common atrioventricular junction will have the

characteristics of a common atrioventricular valve, rather than tricuspid and mitral valves (Figures 7.51–7.55). The potential also exists, nonetheless, for the

leaflets to be free-floating even in the presence of separate valvar orifices (Figure 7.56). Most would consider the lesion shown in Figure 7.56 as an

intermediate defect. If the variability in terms of attachment of the bridging leaflets is described, along with information concerning the presence of a common

valvar orifice or separate right and left orifices, there is no need to introduce the concept of intermediate or transitional variants. We recognise, nonetheless, the

value of the shorthand terms of partial, intermediate, and complete variants, providing that all working on the same team understand the definitions used for the different types.

Thus, in many patients with so-called partial defects, with separate right and left valvar orifices within the common junction, echo Doppler interrogation reveals the potential for interventricular shunting

beneath the tongue that joins together the bridging leaflets, or otherwise through intercordal spaces tethering the bridging leaflets themselves. Such patients are well described as having separate valvar

orifices, with predominantly atrial shunting, but with the potential for minimal ventricular shunting. The basic morphology of the deficient ventricular septum, therefore, is comparable in all patients having atrioventricular septal

defects with a common atrioventricular junction12. As already emphasised, it is this disposition that determines the course of the ventricular conduction pathways (Figure 7.34)13,20. Although the hallmark of the malformation is the

common atrioventricular junction, coupled with the absence of the atrioventricular muscular and membranous separating structures, there is also hypoplasia of the muscular ventricular septum to a greater or lesser extent. This

involves disproportion between the inlet and outlet dimensions of the ventricular septum when compared to the normal heart (compare Figures 7.57 and 7.58). The degree of septal hypoplasia also varies with regard to the extent of scooping of the septum (Figure 7.58). The scooping is greater in hearts with a common valvar orifice than in those with separate right and left orifices. Although the scooping is

greater in hearts with a common valvar orifice, thus increasing the likelihood of there being a ventricular component to the defect, variability is still found among these hearts. When there is minimal scooping, it

Fig. 7.58 The valvar leaflets have been removed from the ventricular mass in this heart with deficient atrioventricular septation and a common atrioventricular junction. The heart is viewed from the left side and shown in anatomical orientation. Because the leaflets have been removed, there is no way of knowing whether, originally, there was a common atrioventricular orifice, or separate valvar orifices for the right and left ventricles. Note the scooping of the ventricular septum (yellow doubleheaded arrow), and the disproportion between inlet (blue doubleheaded arrow) and outlet (red double-headed arrow) dimensions of the ventricular mass.

is certainly possible to close the ventricular component of the septal defect by attaching the bridging leaflets directly to the right ventricular aspect of the ventricular septum<sup>21</sup>. This manoeuvre, in fact, is feasible in all patients with a common valvar orifice<sup>22,23</sup>, although not all are

convinced of its utility. Thus, the use of the modified single patch approach remains controversial. Some consider that the technique creates potential narrowing of the left ventricular outflow tract. There may be subtle technical differences that produce the different results.

If the technique is used, care must be taken not to damage the exposed conduction tissues along the septal crest. The non-branching bundle runs down the crest of the scooped-out septum, and is covered by the inferior bridging leaflet. The inferior leaflet itself is often divided by

a midline raphe immediately above the vulnerable non-branching bundle. The branching component of the conduction axis is found astride the midportion of the septal crest. This is usually covered by the connecting tongue and leaflet tissue in hearts with separate right and left valvar orifices. It is exposed in the presence of a common orifice and free-floating leaflets. The right bundle branch then runs towards the medial papillary muscle. Anterior to this point, the septum is devoid of conduction tissue (Figures 7.59, 7.60)<sup>15</sup>.

Although not readily evident to the surgeon during operation, the left ventricular outflow tract in atrioventricular septal defects is intrinsically narrow<sup>24</sup>. It is much longer in hearts with separate orifices. This is because of the attachment of the superior bridging leaflet to the ventricular septal crest (compare

**Fig. 7.62** In this heart, again shown in anatomical orientation from the left side (compare with Figure 7.61), the outflow tract (black double-headed arrow) is much shorter in the presence of a common atrioventricular valvar orifice. The star shows the zone of apposition between the bridging leaflets.

Figures 7.61 and 7.62). The area is prone to postoperative obstruction, and surgical enlargement may be necessary. Obstruction may be due to naturally occurring lesions<sup>25</sup>, or to injudicious placement of a prosthesis used to replace the left atrioventricular valve. If a prosthesis must be employed, the anatomy dictates

insertion of a model with low profile, otherwise resection of the shelf that exists between the hingepoint of the superior bridging leaflet and the attachment of the aortic valve<sup>24</sup>. The superior bridging leaflet can also be liberated from the septal crest, inserting a gusset to enlarge the outflow tract (Figures 7.63 and 7.64).

Further variability is found in the commitment of the common atrioventricular junction to the ventricular mass. Usually it is shared equally, giving a balanced arrangement (Figure 7.27). Should the common junction favour one or other ventricle, producing so-called right or left ventricular

dominance, the other ventricle is often severely hypoplastic. This can have a major influence on the outcome of surgery, and should always be assessed preoperatively.

In the setting of right ventricular dominance, there is usually alignment between the atrial and ventricular septal structures at the crux. The essence of left ventricular dominance, in contrast, is malalignment between the atrial septum and the muscular ventricular septum (Figure 7.65). This produces an

![](_page_34_Picture_2.jpeg)

Fig. 7.65 In this specimen from a patient with an atrioventricular septal defect and common atrioventricular junction, shown in anatomical orientation, there is gross malalignment between the muscular ventricular septum (red dotted double-headed arrow) and the atrial septum (black double-headed arrow). As a consequence, the atrioventricular conduction axis originates from an anomalous node (star) in the inferior aspect of the right atrioventricular junction, rather than at the crux of the heart.

arrangement analogous to straddling of the tricuspid valve<sup>26</sup>. As with straddling the tricuspid valve, this has major consequence for the disposition of the atrioventricular conduction axis<sup>27</sup>. Because of the septal malalignment, the connecting atrioventricular node is no longer to be found at the crux. It continues to be formed

at the point where the malaligned muscular ventricular septum meets the atrioventricular junction (Figure 7.66). This particular arrangement must be identified preoperatively, as it can be exceedingly difficult to recognise during surgery. If unrecognised, it is likely that a standard repair will damage the conduction

axis. Septal malalignment, therefore, should be excluded in all cases of atrioventricular septal defect with left ventricular dominance. This arrangement should also be distinguished from those hearts in which the atrial septum is absent, and the coronary sinus terminates in the left atrium<sup>16</sup>.

### Ventricular septal defects

When asked to close a clinically significant hole between the ventricles, the primary concern of the surgeon is to ensure that the task can be achieved in a safe and secure fashion. The important anatomical considerations reflect the location of the defect relative to the landmarks of the right ventricle. These features determine the proximity of the defect to the atrioventricular conduction axis, and to the leaflets of the atrioventricular and arterial valves. One categorisation of the defects<sup>28</sup> was designed specifically to focus the attention of the surgeon on these pertinent features. The essence of the system was that, according to the anatomical features of the margins of the defects as seen from the morphologically right ventricle, all the holes fitted into one of three groups.

The first group included all those holes that, when viewed from the right ventricle, had exclusively muscular borders (Figure 7.67). The phenotypical feature of the second group was that part of the right ventricular border was composed of fibrous continuity between the leaflets of an atrioventricular valve and an arterial valve (Figure 7.68). The patients falling in the

third group were unified because part of their right ventricular borders was made up of fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the aortic and pulmonary valves (Figure 7.69), with holes of this third type showing additional variability depending on whether the fibrous continuity extended to include the leaflet of an atrioventricular valve. The defects in the patients making up the third group, of necessity open between the outflow tracts of the ventricles. Defects within the other groups, however, need further description depending on whether they open primarily to the inlet, to the apical, or to the outlet components of the right ventricle. There is thus an additional feature that always requires description, if present, namely malalignment between the septal components.

There are, of course, other categorisations available for distinguishing between types of holes between the ventricles. One time-honoured system identified four variants, and grouped them in numerical fashion<sup>29</sup>. Another popular system used developmental considerations so as to distinguish between the different holes<sup>30</sup>. We prefer the system designed specifically to emphasise the

surgical considerations (Figure 7.70). When using this system, nonetheless, the borders of the holes between the ventricles must be assessed as seen by the surgeon working through the morphologically right ventricle (Figures 7.67–7.69).

The essence of the largest group of defects requiring surgical closure is that part of the central fibrous body, specifically the area of fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the mitral, aortic, and tricuspid valves, that forms a direct part of the rim of the defect as seen from the right ventricle (Figure 7.68). This fibrous area incorporates the atrioventricular component of the membranous septum, which retains its integrity when ventricular septation is incomplete, being an integral part of the central fibrous body. The defects, therefore, surround the membranous part of the septum, and are described, justifiably, as being perimembranous. In many instances, the interventricular component of the membranous septum is found as a fold of fibrous tissue in the posteroinferior margin of the defect (Figure 7.71).

The defects themselves represent the unclosed embryonic interventricular

Fig. 7.68 This view, again through a right atriotomy with retraction of the leaflets of the tricuspid valve, shows the fibrous tissue of the atrioventricular septum forming part of the right ventricular border, as viewed by the surgeon.

communication (Figure 7.72). They presumably result from a deficiency of the muscular ventricular septum forming the apical and cranial rims of the persisting hole. Defects requiring surgical closure will always be considerably larger than the area occupied by the interventricular membranous septum of the normal heart. The degree of septal deficiency has important consequences for the disposition of the axis of atrioventricular conduction tissue31. In the normally formed heart, the axis penetrates the atrioventricular membranous septum to reach the crest of the muscular septum. Having penetrated, it

is sandwiched between the muscular septum and the interventricular component of the membranous septum (Figure 7.73). In perimembranous defects, when the atrioventricular connections are concordant, so as to reach the crest of the

muscular ventricular septum, the axis penetrates the area of continuity between the leaflets of the aortic and tricuspid valves (Figure 7.74). When a remnant of the interventricular membranous septum is present, it lies immediately on top of the

atrioventricular bundle (Figure 7.74). If such a remnant is seen at operation (Figure 7.71), and is substantial, it may safely be used for anchorage of sutures placed superficially to anchor a surgical patch.

The only exceptions to this rule are the defects associated with straddling and overriding of the tricuspid valve<sup>27</sup>. The proximity of the conduction tissues to the leaflets of the aortic and atrioventricular valves, however, varies depending upon the precise area of

Fig. 7.75 This hole between the ventricles, shown in anatomical orientation, is viewed from its right ventricular aspect.

Note that the axis lies directly beneath a membranous flap. The septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve has been retracted.

deficiency of the muscular septum. It is likely that all parts are deficient to a certain extent. It can usually be determined, nonetheless, which part is most affected. When a perimembranous defect extends to

open mostly into the inlet of the right ventricle, its atrial margin, as viewed through the tricuspid valve, is an area of fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the aortic and tricuspid valves, but the

fibrous continuity also extends to involve the leaflets of the mitral valve (Figure 7.75). The apex of the triangle of Koch is usually deviated inferiorly towards the coronary sinus. It is thus to the right-hand side of the surgeon working through the atrium. The axis of atrioventricular conduction tissue penetrates this corner of the defect. Usually, the non-branching and branching bundles are carried on the left ventricular aspect of the muscular septum as they descend the right-hand margin of the defect. The right bundle branch then courses intramvocardially, surfacing beneath the medial papillary muscle, which is usually at the left-hand margin of the defect. The non-coronary leaflet of the aortic valve is more to the left, and usually distant from the rim of the defect, although it often maintains fibrous continuity with the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve (Figure 7.76).

When perimembranous defects requiring surgical closure are located so as to open mostly towards the ventricular apex, they are large. They typically open additionally towards the inlet and outlet components, and hence are confluent defects. The triangle of Koch is not deviated as far towards the coronary sinus in such defects as when they open primarily to the right ventricular inlet, but the right-hand rim is still the major area at risk. The medial papillary muscle tends to be at the apex of such defects, and the non-coronary leaflet of the aortic valve is more closely

related to the atrial margin. The septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve is often cleft or deficient, an arrangement that may permit shunting from the left ventricle to right atrium, and hence producing an indirect Gerbode defect (see Figure 7.28)<sup>14</sup>. If the cleft in the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve requires surgical closure, it should be remembered that the penetrating atrioventricular bundle is located at its apex.

The third type of perimembranous defect extends mostly so as to open into the outlet of the right ventricle. The outlet septum, along with the free-standing subpulmonary infundibulum, can thus be recognised separating the leaflets of the aortic and pulmonary valves, being malaligned relative to the rest of the septum (Figure 7.77). It is this type of defect that others describe as being conoventricular<sup>30</sup>. In the presence of anterocephalad malalignment of the muscular outlet septum, the aortic root overrides the crest of the muscular ventricular septum (Figures 7.78, 7.79). The medial papillary muscle is on the right-hand margin of the defect, and the axis of atrioventricular conduction tissue is more distant from the edge, being carried well down on the left surface of the ventricular septum. The

non-coronary and right coronary leaflets of the aortic valve are much more closely related to the left-hand margin (Figure 7.79), and may prolapse towards the right ventricle<sup>32</sup>.

The essential feature of muscular defects is that, when viewed from the right ventricle, they have exclusively muscular borders (Figure 7.67). They can open into the inlet, apical, or outlet parts of the right ventricle. Always, nonetheless, ventricular musculature will interpose between the edges of the defect and the attachments of the leaflets of the valves. When a muscular defect opens into the inlet of the right ventricle (Figure 7.80), it is inferior to the atrioventricular axis of conduction tissue. When viewed by the surgeon through the tricuspid valve (Figures 7.81, 7.82), the conduction axis is located on the left-hand margin of the defect. The proximity of the axis to the edge depends upon the adjacency of the defect to the intact membranous septum. The basal margin of the muscular septum, interposing between the edge of the defect and the atrial septum, separates the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve from the mitral valve, preserving the off-setting of the valvar hinges. Its size will determine whether it is suitable to be an anchorage for sutures.

It is malaligned relative to the muscular ventricular septum, and attached anterocephalad relative to the septomarginal trabeculation.

Right Left Fig. 7.78 This is the heart shown in Figure 7.77 prior to making the section to correlate with the echocardiographic plane. The ventricular septal defect opens into the outlet of the right ventricle, with the aortic valve overriding the crest of the ventricular septum.

Defects opening through the apical part of the septum can be single (Figure 7.83), double, or multiple (Figure 7.84). They are unrelated to the proximal parts of the

conduction tissue axis, but may be related to ramifications of the distal bundle branches. The right ventricular aspect of such defects is frequently obscured by the coarse apical trabeculations. Multiple defects, if small, may not be visible through a right ventriculotomy. The septal deficiencies are much more readily

identified from the left ventricular aspect. Inspection from the left side will often demonstrate that the defect is a solitary hole (Figure 7.85). The multiple right

ventricular openings (Figure 7.84) simply reflect crossing of the solitary defect by the right ventricular apical trabeculations<sup>33</sup>. Multiple small defects, nonetheless, can

involve the entirety of the apical ventricular septum. This produces the 'swiss-cheese' septum, an arrangement that can be notoriously difficult to close surgically.

Fig. 7.82 This view of the heart shown in Figure 7.81, again seen through a right atriotomy and the orifice of the tricuspid valve, shows the musculature of the ventricular septum interposing between the basal margin of the defect (star) and the hinge of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve. The triangle of Koch (crosshatched triangle) is to the left-hand side of the surgeon relative to the defect.

Muscular defects opening into the outlet of the right ventricle are relatively rare in patients with concordant atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial connections. If small, the endocardium may appear to be heaped up at the edges to produce a fibrous rim (Figure 7.86). Larger defects opening into the right ventricular outlet typically show malalignment of the muscular outlet septum (Figure 7.87). Close inspection will show whether the posterocaudal limb of the septomarginal trabeculation is fused with the ventriculoinfundibular fold to form a

muscular posteroinferior rim to the defect, thus distinguishing the hole from a perimembranous defect with outlet extension. When present, the fusion of these muscle bars separates the edge of the defect from the axis of atrioventricular conduction tissue. The superior rim is

the muscular outlet septum, combined with the free-standing subpulmonary infundibulum. These tissues separate the leaflets of the pulmonary valve from the right coronary leaflet of the aortic valve, the latter attached to its left ventricular surface. If this superior muscular rim is attenuated, the leaflet of the aortic valve may again prolapse through the defect (Figure 7.87).

The third type of ventricular septal defect is the one that is doubly committed and juxta-arterial. The phenotypical feature of this defect is absence of both the muscular outlet septum, and the posterior

aspect of the free-standing subpulmonary infundibulum. Because of the absence of these structures, the facing leaflets of the aortic and pulmonary valves are in fibrous continuity, producing a fibrous raphe that forms the superior rim of the defect (Figures 7.69, 7.88). The leaflets can be attached at the same level, albeit that in

some hearts part of the aortic sinus may interpose between them, producing valvar off-setting. In either event, sutures can be secured in the region of fibrous continuity.

Fig. 7.87 In this heart, viewed in anatomical orientation, the right coronary leaflet of the aortic valve prolapses minimally through a muscular defect that opens into the outlet of the right ventricle.

![](_page_46_Picture_4.jpeg)

Fig. 7.88 In this heart, the defect opening into the outlet of the right ventricle (star) is doubly committed and juxta-arterial, due to failure of muscularisation of the subpulmonary infundibulum. The roof of the defect is made up of a fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the aortic and pulmonary valves (black dotted line). Note the extensive muscular posteroinferior rim to the defect that protects the atrioventricular conduction axis.

The doubly committed defect can also be found with overriding of the orifice of the aortic valve (Figure 7.89). In most instances, the inferior rim of the defect is

similar to that found in the muscular defect that opens into the outlet part of the right ventricle, the posterocaudal limb of the septomarginal trabeculation fusing with the ventriculoinfundibular fold (Figure 7.88). When present, this muscular rim separates the axis of atrioventricular conduction tissue from the edge of the defect.

![](_page_47_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 7.89** This heart, photographed in anatomical orientation, also has a doubly committed and juxta-arterial ventricular septal defect opening into the outlet of the right ventricle in the absence of muscularisation of the muscular subpulmonary infundibulum. There is fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the arterial valves (blue dotted line). Note the extensive overriding of the orifice of the aortic valve.

![](_page_47_Figure_4.jpeg)

**Fig. 7.90** This doubly committed and juxta-arterial ventricular septal defect (star), shown in anatomical orientation, extends so that its posteroinferior margin is formed by a fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the aortic and tricuspid valves, making it additionally perimembranous. The pathognomonic feature is the fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the aortic and pulmonary valves.

Occasionally, the muscular bundles do not fuse. The defect then extends to be bordered by fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the aortic and tricuspid valves, making it perimembranous as well as doubly committed (Figure 7.90). The conduction axis, therefore, is much closer to its inferior corner. It is the doubly committed variant that is particularly prone to set the scene for prolapse of the leaflets of

the aortic valve<sup>32</sup>. Such defects are also much more frequent in oriental as opposed to occidental populations<sup>34</sup>.

Although the descriptions thus far have related to ventricular septal defects in

patients having concordant atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial connections, this topology, and the guidance it gives to the site of the conduction axis, is equally valid for patients with concordant atrioventricular connections, but abnormal ventriculoarterial connections (see Chapter 8). The only exception to the rules we have described for recognition of the location of the atrioventricular conduction axis is produced by overriding and straddling of the tricuspid valve (see later). This arrangement results in a particular type of defect that opens into the inlet of the right ventricle. As we have described, defects with markedly different phenotypical features, and with markedly different dispositions of the atrioventricular conduction axis, can open towards the inlet of the morphologically right ventricle. This is why it is insufficient simply to describe them as inlet defects<sup>35</sup>. The commonest defects opening into the right ventricular inlet are probably the ones that are perimembranous (Figure 7.74). These, and the ones associated with straddling and overriding of the tricuspid valve, have been described as being of the atrioventricular canal type. It is certainly the case that hearts with a common

atrioventricular iunction can exist with shunting exclusively at the ventricular level (Figure 7.52). Patients with this morphology, however, need to be distinguished from those with either perimembranous defects opening into the right ventricular inlet, or those associated with straddling and overriding of the tricuspid valve, as both the latter variants are found in the setting of separate atrioventricular junctions. All of these variants must be distinguished from muscular defects opening into the inlet of the right ventricle (Figure 7.80). There is similar phenotypical variability among defects opening into the right ventricular outlet, but the major feature of surgical significance in this latter setting is to determine whether a muscular bar is interposed between the caudal rim of the defect and the atrioventricular conduction axis (compare Figures 7.88 and 7.90).

# MALFORMATIONS OF THE ATRIOVENTRICULAR VALVES

The pathological lesions that affect atrioventricular valves, both acquired and congenital, are legion. Not all are amenable to surgical repair. We will concentrate on features of immediate surgical relevance.

The anatomy of atrioventricular valves themselves indicates that problems may be encountered at the atrioventricular junction, which is contiguous with the valvar annulus, in the leaflets, or in the tension apparatus. Sometimes all the components of the valve, along with the entire atrioventricular connection, are totally absent. This produces the commonest variant of atrioventricular valvar atresia, which is discussed in Chapter 8. The lesions to be considered in this section can involve either the morphologically tricuspid or mitral valves. Because the tricuspid valve usually functions in an environment of low pressure, the lesions are more frequently manifest when affecting the mitral valve. We will deal with the respective lesions in turn, indicating their proclivity towards one or the other valve.

Of considerable surgical significance is overriding of the atrioventricular junction. This means that the valvar orifice is looking into both ventricles, positioned astride a septal defect (Figure 7.91)<sup>27</sup>. Almost always, this is

![](_page_48_Picture_9.jpeg)

Fig. 7.91 This heart has been sectioned to replicate the 'four-chamber' echocardiographic view, and is shown in anatomical orientation. There is overriding of the orifice of the tricuspid valve (white double-headed arrow), and straddling of its tension apparatus (white arrows). Note the gross malalignment between the atrial and ventricular septal structures, the star marking the crest of the muscular ventricular septum.

associated with straddling of the valvar tension apparatus, with the tendinous cords attached to both sides of the muscular ventricular septum (Figure 7.91)27. Although it is the mode of insertion of the tension apparatus across the septum that determines the surgical options, the degree of override is also important. Overriding of the tricuspid valve typically is associated with malalignment between the atrial and ventricular septums, and this has major consequences in terms of arrangement of the conduction tissues. Straddling and overriding, nonetheless, can affect either valve, and can occur in various segmental combinations<sup>27</sup> . Straddling in the setting of a double-inlet ventricle, and with discordant atrioventricular connections, is considered in Chapter 8. Here, the concern is with straddling valves coexisting with concordant atrioventricular connections.

When the mitral valve straddles, it does so through an interventricular communication that opens into the outlet of the right ventricle (Figure 7.92)27. This

arrangement does not produce atrioventricular septal malalignment, so that the muscular ventricular septum is normally related to the atrial septum at the crux, and the atrioventricular conduction axis is normally disposed. It is the superior papillary muscle of the mitral valve that is abnormally attached within the right ventricle. It typically arises from the septomarginal trabeculation alongside, but separate from, the anterior papillary muscle of the tricuspid valve. This arrangement, seen with either discordant ventriculoarterial connections, or a doubleoutlet right ventricle with a subpulmonary defect, producing the Taussig–Bing malformation, can seriously compromise surgical repair. We discuss the problems in greater detail in Chapter 8.

Straddling of the tricuspid valve is found when the ventricular septal defect opens into the inlet of the right ventricle (Figure 7.93)27. It can exist as an isolated lesion, or be found with tetralogy of Fallot, or other abnormal ventriculoarterial connections such as transposition. The phenotypical feature is that the muscular ventricular septum is

malaligned relative to the atrial septum, no longer inserting at the crux (Figure 7.91). The conduction axis, which is carried on the muscular ventricular septum, originates from an anomalous node in the inferolateral margin of the right atrioventricular junction27, found at the point where the muscular septum comes into contact with the junction (Figures 7.94, 7.95). There is a rudimentary node found within the regular triangle of Koch, but it makes no contact with the ventricular musculature. The septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve is usually tethered to the enlarged inferoseptal papillary muscle of the mitral valve (Figure 7.96). A miniseptation procedure is often necessary for complete ventricular repair, which carries a high risk of producing heart block36. It is possible, nonetheless, to place a patch by sewing the stitches exclusively in the straddling leaflet of the tricuspid valve (Figures 7.97, 7.98). This ensures avoidance of the conduction tissues. An alternative option is to convert the patient to the Fontan circulation.

Fig. 7.93 The heart is photographed in anatomical orientation. It showsthe right atrial aspect of a straddling and overriding tricuspid valve in the setting of concordant atrioventricular connections. There is gross malalignment between the muscular ventricular septum, which carries the atrioventricular conduction axis (black dotted line), and the atrial septum. Because of this, the connecting atrioventricular node is formed inferiorly in the atrioventricular junction (star), and is not in the regular triangle of Koch (triangle).

Fig. 7.94 The image shows an operative picture through a right atriotomy in a patient with concordant atrioventricular connections complicated by straddling and overriding of the tricuspid valve with basically concordant atrioventricular connections. Note the malalignment of the muscular ventricular septum, which carries the atrioventricular conduction axis (white dotted line). The axis arises from an anomalous posteroinferior atrioventricular node (star).

Dilation of the atrioventricular junction occurs almost exclusively as an acquired lesion. A dilated mitral valvar orifice is most frequently secondary to

myocarditis. When surgical narrowing of the orifice is indicated, it can be accomplished using various annuloplasty techniques, without resorting to

replacement of the valve. Dilation of the tricuspid valvar orifice is seen most frequently as a result of right heart failure.

**Fig. 7.95** The cartoon shows the anomalous location of the atrioventricular conduction axis, as seen by the surgeon operating through a right atriotomy in the setting of straddling and overriding of the tricuspid valve.

**Fig. 7.96** This picture, taken in anatomical orientation, shows the left ventricular aspect of the heart shown in Figure 7.93. Note the straddling part of the tension apparatus supporting the tricuspid valve.

More of a challenge surgically is the dilation that accompanies Ebstein's malformation<sup>37</sup>. The crucial feature of this anomaly is the attachment of the hingepoint of the septal and mural leaflets of the tricuspid valve towards the junction of the

inlet and apical trabecular components of the right ventricle, rather than at the atrioventricular junction (Figure 7.99)<sup>38</sup>. The displacement is usually described as being downwards. In reality, there is rotational displacement of the valvar orifice around the area of the central fibrous body. The anterosuperior leaflet is less affected in terms of its junctional attachment, but shows important variations in its distal attachments<sup>39</sup>. These can be focal (Figure 7.100). In more severe cases, the

(Compare with Figure 7.96.)

leading edge of the leaflet is attached in linear fashion, severely restricting antegrade flow into the pulmonary trunk (Figure 7.101). In the most severe form, the anterosuperior leaflet completely blocks this junction, producing tricuspid atresia in the

setting of Ebstein's malformation (see also Chapter 8).

Ebstein's malformation requires surgical treatment when there is significant dilation of the true atrioventricular junction, and when the wall of the inlet component of the right ventricle is both dilated and thinned. Reparative operations often require placement of sutures in the area of thinning. Particular care should be taken to avoid the right coronary artery and its branches. In the septal area, the triangle of Koch remains

Ebstein's malformation involving the left-sided morphologically tricuspid valve when the atrioventricular connections are discordant is discussed in Chapter 8. Rarely, the normally located morphologically mitral valve can show Ebstein's malformation. It is the hinge

of the mural leaflet that is displaced away from the atrioventricular junction.

Malformations of the leaflets can be summarised in terms of dysplasia, prolapse,

and clefting. Dysplastic valves show thickening and heaping up of the substance of the leaflets, usually with obliteration of the intercordal spaces. A dysplastic valve may pose a significant surgical problem. It is seen frequently with atresia of the outflow tract, and is an integral part of Ebstein's malformation<sup>42</sup>. Isolated dysplasia (Figure 7.103) is exceedingly rare except in neonatal life<sup>43</sup>, when it is often a fatal lesion.

Prolapse occurs more frequently, and usually involves the mitral valve (Figure 7.104). It is usually associated with deficiency of the tension apparatus<sup>44</sup>,

particularly elongation of the tendinous cords (Figure 7.105). It may be sufficiently severe to warrant valvar replacement, but the prolapsing leaflets can be repaired by various techniques, including cordal shortening (Figure 7.106), and insertion of annular rings (Figure 7.107).

Fig. 7.104 This surgical view of the mitral valve, taken through the dome of the left atrium, shows prolapse of the aortic leaflet.

The true cleft of the aortic leaflet of the mitral valve can be repaired simply by reconstituting its edges. Such an isolated cleft of the aortic leaflet (Figure 7.108) has to be distinguished from the lesion often described as a cleft in the setting of

atrioventricular septal defects19. The latter entity (Figure 7.109) is the zone of apposition between the left ventricular components of the bridging leaflets of the common atrioventricular valve. Along with the short mural leaflet, the bridging leaflets

guard the left side of the common atrioventricular junction in trifoliate fashion.

or leaflets, such as straddling tension apparatus. Of those which remain, the so-called parachute deformity is probably the most worrisome lesion, apart from rare anomalies such as arcade lesions<sup>45</sup>. Some confusion exists about the definition of a parachute valve. It is considered logically as fusion of the papillary muscle groups

(Figure 7.110), so that all the cords insert into a common muscle mass<sup>46</sup>. In the original description<sup>47</sup>, in contrast, the parachute lesion was defined on the basis of

gross hypoplasia of one end of the zone of apposition between the leaflets, together with an absence of its supporting papillary muscle. Irrespective of how the lesion is defined, surgical reconstruction is difficult, and valvar replacement is likely to be necessary<sup>48</sup>. Parachute deformity of the mitral valve may be complicated further by other lesions, such as a supravalvar left atrial stenosing ring, and coarctation of the aorta. The combinations are known as Shone's syndrome<sup>47</sup>. Parachute malformation of the tricuspid valve can occur, but is rarely of clinical significance<sup>49</sup>.

# MALFORMATIONS OF THE ARTERIAL VALVES AND OUTFLOW TRACTS

In this section, we consider the surgical aspects of subvalvar obstruction of the ventricular outflow tracts, valvar stenosis, and atresia of the outflow. In the normally connected heart, obstruction in the left ventricular outflow tract produces subaortic stenosis. It must be remembered that the same anatomical lesions will produce subpulmonary obstruction in the patient with discordant ventriculoarterial connections. Similarly, obstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract produces subpulmonary obstruction in the heart with normal segmental connections, but subaortic stenosis when the ventriculoarterial connections are discordant. When both outflow tracts are connected to the same ventricle, the anatomical problems are more discrete. These are considered separately in Chapter 8.

Stenosis of the aortic valve can occur at valvar, subvalvar, and supravalvar levels. Aortic regurgitation is ultimately a valvar problem, and the perivalvar anatomy is often of great importance. To understand the substrates for stenosis and regurgitation

across the arterial valves fully, it is essential to have a firm grasp of the arrangement of the valvar leaflets at the ventriculoarterial junction. As described in Chapters 2 and 3, the arterial valves do not possess an annulus in the sense of a circular ring of collagen that supports the leaflets in the fashion of a circle. The only ring within the valvar complex, aside from the sinutubular junction, is the circular area over which the fibrous wall of the great arterial trunk is supported by the underlying ventricular structures<sup>50</sup>. Surgeons do not define this ring, however, as the annulus<sup>51</sup>. The junctions are partly muscular and partly fibrous in the left ventricle (Figure 7.111)<sup>52</sup>, but exclusively muscular at the right ventriculoarterial junction (Figure 7.112)<sup>50</sup>. The attachments of the leaflets are arranged as half moons, with the bases of the leaflets attached to ventricular muscle, but the apex of the leaflets attached to the fibrous wall of the arterial trunk at the sinutubular junction. When seen in the closed position, the three leaflets coapt snugly along their zones of apposition, which extend from the circumferential margins of the arterial wall to the centre of the valve (Figure 7.113). It is on the basis of perturbation of this coaptation of the leaflets under pressure of the diastolic

column of blood that stenosis or regurgitation occurs within the valvar complex.

Valvar aortic stenosis may occur with unicuspid, bicuspid, tricuspid and, rarely, even quadricuspid configurations. Dysplastic lesions are also seen in the aortic valve, but only rarely can surgery provide the answer to this problem. The unicuspid valve has two raphes at the ends of abortive zones of apposition (Figure 7.114). The leaflets are also abnormally attached in linear rather than semilunar fashion (Figure 7.115). Surgical opening of the raphes in the conjoined leaflets typically results in valvar incompetence. The creation of new interleaflet triangles, supplementing the leaflet tissue so as to create new semilunar hinges, is likely to produce greater clinical success.

A valve with two effective leaflets is seen most frequently in the adult patient. Perhaps this is because such a bicuspid valve, in itself, is not usually intrinsically stenotic. It is only with the effects of time and turbulence that the bifoliate valves become manifestly obstructive. If the valvar morphology has not been totally obscured by calcific deposits, a bicuspid valve seen at operation will take one of two forms. Occasionally the two leaflets are of

equal size, the solitary zone of apposition between them bisecting the aortic root (Figure 7.116). This type of valve is frequently found in patients with coarctation of the aorta. In the other form, the leaflets are unequal, with the large, or conjoined, leaflet usually exhibiting a raphe, which can be eccentrically placed (Figure 7.117) or centrally positioned (Figure 7.118) within the conjoined leaflet. If the conjoined leaflet is produced by fusion of the leaflets guarding the aortic

sinuses giving rise to the coronary arteries, then both arteries will arise from the conjoined sinus. Alternatively, when the conjoined sinus is formed from the right coronary and non-coronary aortic sinuses, the coronary arteries will be

positioned so that one coronary artery arises from the conjoined sinuses, and the other from the third sinus53. It is increasingly recognised that the two phenotypes carry significant differences with regard to anticipated problems during follow-up. When the conjoined leaflet is made up of the right and non-coronary aortic leaflets, it is common to find degenerative disease of the aortic walls. If valves with two effective leaflets are seen before they become rigid and distorted by calcification, some relief from the stenosis can be obtained by careful enlargement of the ends of the solitary zone of apposition. Careful follow-up is essential, especially when the phenotype points towards degenerative disease.

**Fig. 7.117** This picture, taken in the operating room through an aortotomy, shows a bicuspid aortic valve with a raphe (star) in one of the leaflets.

Aortic stenosis also occurs in patients with valves having three leaflets, but is not usually seen until later in life. A possible cause of such stenosis is the unequal size of the leaflets in the otherwise normal aortic valve. This, coupled with the high pressure

in the aortic root, may lead to the development of calcification and stenosis in the elderly (Figure 7.119)<sup>54</sup>.

Subvalvar stenosis may be fibrous, fibromuscular, or muscular, reflecting the fact that the left ventricular outflow tract is

partly muscular and partly fibrous. The muscular portion comprises the ventriculoinfundibular fold anterolaterally, the small outlet component of the muscular septum anteriorly, and the upper edge of the apical part of the muscular septum

posteriorly. The fibrous part comprises the central fibrous body, the area of continuity between the leaflets of the aortic and mitral valves, and the left fibrous trigone. Subvalvar stenoses may also be either fixed or dynamic in nature.

Of the variants producing fixed stenosis, a subvalvar fibrous shelf is perhaps most easily approached surgically. It appears circular when viewed through the usually normal aortic valve (Figure 7.120). Indeed, it can be

circular. This is not always the case. A relatively thin shelf of tissue sometimes runs from beneath the non-coronary leaflet of the aortic valve, originating over the site of the penetrating bundle, then extending to the septal musculature,

**Fig. 7.120** This view, taken in the operating room through the aortic valve, shows a circular fibrous shelf producing subaortic stenosis.

eventually coursing over the ventriculoinfundibular fold. The shelf can also extend laterally to involve the aortic leaflet of the mitral valve (Figure 7.121). If dissection is performed carefully<sup>55</sup>, taking

particular care where the shelf intimately overlies the conduction tissues, a circumferential lesion can be removed completely (Figure 7.122). Too vigorous an attack on the side of the mitral valve

may lead to detachment of that structure. In cases where the ventricular septum appears to be playing a part in causing the stenosis, it may be prudent to remove a segment of muscle (Figure 7.123).

![](_page_65_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 7.122** This specimen is the subaortic shelf shown in Figure 7.120 subsequent to its surgical removal. Note the horseshoe configuration.

**Fig. 7.123** This view, taken in the operating room through the aorta, shows how a segment of ventricular muscle (arrow) can be removed safely to relieve shelf-like fibrous obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract.

In cases where complete removal proves difficult, interruption of the fibrous shelf in the safe area over the ventriculoinfundibular fold will result in a safe and satisfactory relief of the stenosis. The same rules apply when resecting the variant of aortic stenosis producing a fibromuscular tunnel. Surgical correction, however, may be less successful than with a simple shelf, because the tunnel extends farther into the left ventricle, making the obstruction it produces more difficult to relieve.

A much more rare form of fixed subaortic obstruction is produced by hypertrophy of the usually inconspicuous anterolateral muscle bundle<sup>56</sup>. This muscle runs down the outflow tract from the ventriculoinfundibular fold to the

ventricular septum. In its course over the parietal wall, it would not be expected to involve the conduction tissues.

Anomalous attachment of the left atrioventricular valve can also cause fixed obstruction, as can a deviated muscular outlet septum. The former is usually seen with atrioventricular septal defect. The latter occurs only in the presence of a ventricular septal defect (Figure 7.124).

The fixed type of subaortic obstruction is also produced by so-called tissue tags. These can herniate from any adjacent fibrous tissue structure, but are exceedingly rare as an isolated lesion in the normally connected heart<sup>57</sup>. They can produce significant obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract in hearts with an atrioventricular septal defect (Figure 7.125), or with discordant ventriculoarterial connections (see Chapter 8).

![](_page_66_Picture_7.jpeg)

**Fig. 7.124** This anatomical specimen shows the left ventricle opened in clam-shell-like fashion, and viewed from the apex of the left ventricle. There is a fixed subaortic obstruction produced by the posterior deviation of the muscular outlet septum through a ventricular septal defect.

**Fig. 7.125** This heart is opened through the subaortic outflow tract, and photographed in anatomical orientation. There is an atrioventricular septal defect with a common atrioventricular junction, with subaortic obstruction due to tissue tags (arrows).

Dynamic subvalvar obstruction is a result of thickening of the septal musculature abutting the aortic leaflet of the mitral valve during ventricular systole. This usually creates a ridge of thickened endocardium, easily seen through the aortic valve. If an operation becomes necessary, the hypertrophied muscle bundle can be resected, offering satisfactory relief of the obstruction<sup>58</sup>. Again the surgeon must scrupulously avoid the conduction tissue as it emerges beneath the zone of apposition between the right and non-coronary leaflets and descends on the muscular ventricular septum (Figure 7.126). Interventionists are now able to offer alternative therapy by injecting alcohol into the first septal perforating artery.

Supravalvar aortic stenosis occurs in hourglass, membranous, and more diffuse tubular variants. All forms are rare. Fortunately, the severe tubular type is extremely unusual. Two problems are shared by all three varieties because of narrowing of the aorta at the junction of the sinuses with the ascending tubular aorta<sup>59</sup>. Firstly, the aortic sinuses, which usually contain the coronary arteries, may be converted into high pressure zones, in which the arteries provide the only run-off other than through the distal stenosis. This can produce marked dilation of both the

sinuses and the coronary arteries. Secondly, the circumferential narrowing at the sinutubular junction (Figure 7.127) tends to tether the three aortic leaflets at the ends of their zones of apposition in such a way that it is rarely enough to perform a simple aortoplasty <sup>60</sup>. If possible, all three sinuses should be opened to release the tethering of the leaflets. This can be accomplished by resecting the thickened sinutubular junction, and inserting pericardial patches in each sinus (Figures 7.128–7.131).

Aortic valvar insufficiency may be due to congenital malformation of the valve (Figure 7.132), its supporting structures (Figure 7.133), or both. It may also be secondary to an infectious process in the aortic root (Figure 7.134), or to degenerative disease of the aortic walls. Occasionally, aortic insufficiency may be due to trauma. Its frequent association with the doubly committed and juxtaarterial ventricular septal defect suggests that deficiency in the structures supporting the leaflets plays some role in these problems. Prolapse of the leaflets, and insufficiency, may occur with other types of ventricular septal defect (Figure 7.135). Prolapse can be found even when the ventricular septum is intact, the latter situation usually being associated with a bicuspid aortic valve.

The critical importance of the anatomy of this region perhaps is best demonstrated by the problems exhibited by patients with endocarditis of the aortic valve<sup>61</sup>. Because the valve is the keystone to all the other valves and chambers of the heart (Figure 7.136), an eroding abscess in the aortic root may lead to formation of a fistula involving any of these adjacent structures. The patient may present with findings of left heart failure, left-to-right shunting, complete heart block, or any combination of these, in addition to the usual signs of sepsis. Surgical management requires a detailed knowledge of this area, as the surgeon may be faced with virtual disruption of the ventriculoarterial connection<sup>61</sup>. A similar problem can occur when the aortic root, or the fibrous coronet, is severely damaged by dissection or marked degeneration of its fibrous structure.

As with aortic stenosis, stenosis of the right ventricular outflow can occur at the valvar, supravalvar, or subvalvar levels. The latter is discussed in association with tetralogy of Fallot (see later). Dysplasia of the valvar leaflets is most often seen as marked distortion and thickening, although three discrete leaflets can sometimes be recognised (Figure 7.137). It can be associated with insufficiency as well as stenosis.

Fig. 7.127 In this specimen, photographed in anatomical orientation, there is severe narrowing at the level of the sinutubular junction (arrows). Although usually termed 'supravalvar', the obstruction involves the attachment of the valvar leaflets (stars) at the sinutubular junction.

Isolated pulmonary stenosis typically is found in the form of a dome-shaped valve with three well-developed but fused commissures (Figure 7.138)50. Typically, the leaflets are attached to the wall of the pulmonary trunk along the peripheral ends of the zones of apposition between them, leaving only a restricted central

opening (Figure 7.139).The arterial root is narrowed at the sinutubular junction. This is an integral part of the valvar mechanism, although such narrowing is

**Fig. 7.129** In the patient shown in Figure 7.128, the surgeon has made an extensive vertical incision into the non-coronary sinus or the aortic root, revealing the marked constriction at the sinutubular junction, with a particularly narrow entry to the left coronary aortic sinus, which is guarded by the edge of the valvar leaflet.

often described as being supravalvar. These areas of tethering can be dissected from the arterial wall and incised, providing a particularly satisfactory relief of the obstruction. The effectiveness of surgery is best measured six to nine months after operation, as significant secondary muscular

obstruction at the subvalvar level may maintain a pressure gradient across the outflow tract. This muscular hypertrophy will almost always regress with time<sup>62</sup>.

Despite the excellent results of surgery, treatment of congenital pulmonary valvar stenosis has become largely the province of the interventional cardiologist. It is

doubtful, however, whether inflation of a balloon will ever rival the anatomical precision achieved by the competent surgeon.

True supravalvar stenosis usually takes the form of a waist-like narrowing of the pulmonary trunk distal to the sinutubular junction (Figure 7.140),

although it may occur at the sinutubular junction, or anywhere at one or more locations within the pulmonary arterial tree. Narrowing has also been reported within collateral

arteries supplying the lung directly from the aorta in cases of tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia63. Very rarely, the obstructions may be membrane-like, but the usual lesion is more akin to a segment of tubular hypoplasia. These lesions, if anatomically accessible, are amenable to enlargement using a simple patch.

## TETRALOGY OF FALLOT

One form of obstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract is so clearly demarcated that it constitutes an entity in its own right, namely tetralogy of Fallot.

When there is extreme overriding of the aortic valvar orifice, it can also show the abnormal ventriculoarterial connection of a double-outlet right ventricle, but it is convenient to discuss the entity at this point of our narrative. Its anatomical

hallmark is anterocephalad deviation of the insertion of the muscular or fibrous outlet septum, combined with subpulmonary obstruction due to hypertrophy of septoparietal trabeculations64. In the normal heart

![](_page_75_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 7.141** The normal right ventricle is photographed in anatomical orientation, showing the septal aspect. The supraventricular crest inserts between the limbs of the septomarginal trabeculation. Although when, using dissection, it is possible to create a direct communication with the left ventricular outflow tract through the muscle inserted between the limbs of the septomarginal trabeculation, it is not possible, in the normal heart, to distinguish where the septal component finishes, and where the musculature becomes that of the parietal ventricular wall.

(Figure 7.141), the muscular outlet septum is inconspicuous, being the small area of the supraventricular crest inserted between the limbs of the septomarginal trabeculation. In this position, it is fused with the much more extensive ventriculoinfundibular fold, the crest itself supporting the distal free-standing infundibular sleeve.

In tetralogy of Fallot, the outlet part of the septum is malaligned anterocephalad to the anterior limb of the septomarginal trabeculation, becoming recognisable in its own right. The deviated position of the septum, combined with hypertrophy of the septoparietal trabeculations, serves to narrow the subpulmonary outflow tract. At the same time, it leaves an interventricular communication that is overridden by the leaflets of the aortic valve (Figure 7.142).

The interventricular communication, therefore, is positioned beneath the ventricular outlets in association with malalignment of the muscular outlet septum. Therefore, it is the rightwards margin of the cone of space subtended by the overriding valvar leaflets that should be defined as the ventricular septal defect. There can be fibrous continuity between

the leaflets of the aortic and tricuspid valves in the inferocaudal quadrant of the defect thus defined, making it perimembranous (Figure 7.143). Alternatively, the inferocaudal rim can be muscular when the ventriculoinfundibular fold fuses with the caudal limb of the septomarginal trabeculation (Figure 7.144)<sup>65</sup>. These features have the same implications for protection of the axis of atrioventricular conduction tissue as they do in isolated ventricular septal defects (see earlier). When the inferocaudal margin is fibrous, the atrioventricular conduction axis penetrates beneath the atrioventricular membranous septal component of this area (Figure 7.145). Often this is overlain by the membranous flap, or pseudoflaps derived from the tricuspid valve<sup>66</sup>. Usually, in tetralogy of Fallot, the nonbranching and branching components of the atrioventricular bundle are carried down the left ventricular side of the septum, being positioned some distance from the septal crest. In a minority of cases, the bundle can branch directly astride the septum<sup>67,68</sup>. It can then be traumatised (Figure 7.146) by sutures placed directly through the septal crest (Figure 7.147).

The cases in which the posterior limb of the septomarginal trabeculation has fused with the ventriculoinfundibular fold superior to an intact interventricular membranous septum (Figure 7.144), thus protecting the atrioventricular conduction tissues, account for about one-fifth of the overall population with this lesion. In this setting, superficial sutures can be placed along the entire muscular margin of the right ventricular aspect of these defects without fear of traumatising the conduction axis.

In rare cases, more frequently encountered in Asia or South America<sup>69,70</sup>, the outlet septum is fibrous rather than muscular, with failure of formation of the posterior aspect of the free-standing subpulmonary infundibular sleeve. The defect is thus doubly committed and juxta-arterial (Figure 7.148). The significant surgical feature in these cases is again the relationship of the conduction axis in the inferior border of the defect, which may be either muscular or perimembranous.

While it is clearly important to close the ventricular septal defect securely in patients with tetralogy of Fallot, patching the aorta into the left ventricle,

The star shows the deviated muscular outlet septum, which supports a sleeve of free-standing subpulmonary infundibular musculature (arrow).

probably the most important feature for a successful surgical outcome, is relief of the subpulmonary obstruction. One of the major determinants of this

success is the size of the pulmonary trunk. Tables are available for preoperative evaluation to select those patients who can be corrected

successfully without incising across the ventriculoarterial junction71,72. Such incisions are usually described as being transannular.

An understanding of the precise anatomy of the subpulmonary outflow tract is also vital if the surgeon is to plan a reproducible operation for successful relief of the muscular obstruction accurately. This is the consequence of formation of a constrictive muscular ring at the mouth of

the subpulmonary infundibulum, with its parietal segment produced by hypertrophy of free-standing septoparietal trabeculations. Knowledge of this feature is important to the surgeon when deciding which muscle to resect so as to widen the narrowed outflow tract. The major limiting structure is always the hypertrophied septal insertion of the outlet septum, which can be incised without fear of damaging vital structures. At the same time, any free-standing septoparietal trabeculations should be identified and removed (Figures 7.149, 7.150). They, too, never

contain vital structures. The body of the outlet septum usually contributes to obstruction, and it is tempting to resect this structure. Excessive resection, however, may lead to damage to the leaflets of the

aortic valve arising from its left ventricular aspect.

It is also usual to resect the parietal insertion of the outlet septum (Fig. 7.151). This fuses with the ventriculoinfundibular fold, which is the inner curvature of the heart. Care must be taken not to perforate to the right-sided atrioventricular groove in this region. Dissection, or injudicious placement of sutures, can damage the

right coronary artery<sup>73</sup>. It is very unusual for the septomarginal trabeculation itself to contribute to the subpulmonary obstruction. Thus, it is usually unnecessary to resect its limbs. Its body, and the moderator band, nonetheless, may be

hypertrophied, particularly when the latter structure has a high take-off. Severe hypertrophy produces a two-chambered right ventricle<sup>74</sup>, when the intervening muscle band may require resection (Figure 7.152). The anterior papillary

muscle of the tricuspid valve often arises from the inlet aspect of the obstructing shelf. Care must be taken, therefore, not to damage this muscle during resection.

The final variable in tetralogy of Fallot is the connection of the leaflets of the

overriding aortic valve. Depending on this feature, the aorta can be connected mostly to the left ventricle, making the ventriculoarterial connection concordant, or connected mostly to the right ventricle, and hence producing a double-outlet connection. The degree of override should not affect the surgical procedure markedly. With greater commitment of the aorta to the right ventricle, nonetheless, the placement of the patch tunnelling the aorta to the left ventricle, and closing the ventricular septal defect, becomes more important. The internal conduit constructed from the left ventricle to the aorta may complicate relief of the obstruction to the right ventricular outflow tract further, because it is always necessary to ensure an adequate outlet from the left ventricle.

Although the primary obstruction in tetralogy of Fallot is at the infundibular level, the pulmonary valve is frequently stenotic, being bifoliate in the majority of patients. Any stenosis must be relieved during operative repair. The sequels of postoperative pulmonary regurgitation only now are becoming evident. It could be that, in the long term, they will be just as troublesome as residual pulmonary stenosis, and less easy to relieve.

Patients with tetralogy of Fallot can have multiple associated lesions, such as straddling and overriding of the tricuspid valve, or deficient atrioventricular septation. The end point is then a combination of the anatomical lesions already discussed. One of the most important associated lesions is the presence of pulmonary atresia rather than pulmonary stenosis. This combination is often described as pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect, which is not an incorrect designation. The variant found with the intracardiac anatomy of the tetralogy, however, is so distinctive that it should be described as tetralogy of Fallot with valvar or infundibular pulmonary atresia75. The intracardiac anatomy includes deviation of the muscular outlet septum sufficient to block the subpulmonary infundibulum completely (Figure 7.153). The anatomy of the ventricular septal defect can vary as in tetralogy of Fallot, with the same surgical connotations. The feature that dominates the surgical options is the morphology of the pulmonary arteries. Exceedingly rarely, the pulmonary arteries may be supplied through a persistent fifth arch76, an aortopulmonary window, or coronary arterial fistulas77. In most instances, nonetheless, the lungs are supplied either through a persistently patent arterial duct (Figure 7.154), or through major aortopulmonary collateral arteries78. It is rare to find such collateral arteries supplying the pulmonary circulation except when the intracardiac anatomy is that of tetralogy of Fallot. Additionally, only very rarely, will a duct and collateral arteries supply the same lung, although these two sources of flow can supply separate lungs (Figure 7.155). When a duct is present, and the pulmonary arteries are confluent, the arteries supply the entirety of the lung parenchyma (Figure 7.155), although they may be variably developed. The degree of hypoplasia determines whether total correction is feasible.

When the right and left pulmonary arteries are not confluent, or when major aortopulmonary collateral arteries are present, the situation is more complex. Non-confluent pulmonary arteries can be supplied independently by bilateral ducts, or one lung can be supplied by a duct and the other through collateral arteries (Figure 7.156). It is more usual for

collateral arteries to supply both lungs with no duct being present.

Well-developed confluent pulmonary arteries usually coexist within the pericardial sac even when there are

collateral arteries (Figure 7.157). It is important to establish how much of the pulmonary parenchyma is connected to the intrapericardial pulmonary arteries, and how much is supplied directly by collateral arteries. It is known that collateral arteries can anastomose with the pulmonary arteries at the hilum (Figure 7.158), or extend into the parenchyma to supply lobar or segmental arteries directly.

Fig. 7.155 In this specimen of tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia, viewed from behind, the pulmonary arteries are discontinuous. The left pulmonary artery was initially supplied by an arterial duct, which has become ligametous (star). The right lung is supplied through systemic-to-pulmonary collateral arteries (arrows).

Fig. 7.156 The pulmonary arteries in the heart shown in Figure 7.153, fed by the arterial duct (star), have a normal segmental distribution.

Intersegmental anastomoses also occur. The object of preoperative evaluation, therefore, should be to establish precisely how much of each lung is supplied by the intrapericardial pulmonary arteries, as

this is the ultimate determinant of the success of any attempted total correction. Cases can be found with supply exclusively from collateral arteries (Figure 7.159). In this setting, the arterial trunk is best described as a solitary structure (see later).

In contrast to tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia, where initial survival is good, and the results of surgery are

continually improving, attempted surgical correction of patients with pulmonary atresia and an intact ventricular septum continues to be disappointing. The anatomy of the lesion itself accounts for the dismal outcome<sup>79–81</sup>.

The atresia can be due either to an imperforate pulmonary valvar membrane (Figure 7.160), or to muscular infundibular atresia. In the latter situation, the pulmonary trunk is blind-ending, with no vestiges of

leaflets of the pulmonary valve (Figure 7.161). The cavities of the outlet and trabecular component parts of the right ventricle are more-or-less completely obliterated by gross hypertrophy of the

ventricular wall. In consequence, the cavity is effectively represented by only the hypoplastic inlet portion (Figure 7.162). This cavity is unlikely ever to perform a

useful function, particularly when fistulous communications extend to the coronary arteries. The right ventricle probably should be disregarded when deciding surgical

treatment. When there is a pulmonary valve present, but its leaflets are imperforate, a spectrum is seen in terms of the size of the right ventricular cavity82. In some hearts,

Fig. 7.161 In this heart from a patient with pulmonary atresia and an intact ventricular septum, there is no evidence of valvar tissue in the blind-ending pulmonary root (compare with Figure 7.160).

Fig. 7.162 In this heart from a patient with pulmonary atresia and an intact ventricular septum, viewed anatomically, the cavity of the right ventricle is effectively represented by the inlet component alone, due to gross hypertrophy of the walls of the apical trabecular and outlet components. Note the fistulous communication extending through the wall to the anterior interventricular coronary artery (white arrow).

hypertrophy of the right ventricular myocardium obliterates the apical trabecular part of the cavity (Figure 7.163). It is questionable if these ventricles will ever grow and become useful, although attempts have been made to resect apical trabeculations and rehabilitate the ventricle83. In the most favourable situation, the cavity is less hypoplastic, and has well-developed inlet, apical, and outlet components (Figure 7.164). These cases are those which are most amenable to total operative

correction, although increasingly they are treated by the interventional cardiologist, who will perforate the valvar membrane before dilating it with balloons.

Whatever the intracardiac anatomy, it is rare that one finds the thread-like

pulmonary arteries seen so frequently with tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary atresia. Furthermore, the flow of pulmonary blood is almost always duct dependent. With prostaglandins now available to improve ductal flow, the pulmonary arteries are almost always of sufficient size to permit construction of a systemic-pulmonary shunt. Other options, such as the need for pulmonary valvotomy, should be decided after assessment of the precise anatomy of the individual case.

Pulmonary valvar insufficiency may be congenital or acquired, the latter usually secondary to surgical intervention or pulmonary hypertension. Congenital pulmonary valvar insufficiency may be associated with marked deformity of the valvar tissue, as in valvar dysplasia, or with purported absence of the valvar tissue altogether. In reality, rudimentary leaflets

combination with a ventricular septal defect (Figure 7.165). It is another of the associated lesions found in combination with tetralogy of Fallot.

While gross pulmonary valvar insufficiency may be relatively well tolerated by the right heart, it can result in marked enlargement of the

pulmonary trunk and arteries, and usually is associated with an absence of the arterial duct85. Compromise of the tracheobronchial tree by these grossly enlarged vessels

(Figures 7.166–7.169) results in most patients presenting with symptoms of respiratory distress. Because only a limited number of cases have come to surgical correction, the

efficacy of replacement of the valve with or without arterial plication has not been proved. Perhaps fortunately, socalled absence of the pulmonary valvar leaflets is a rare condition.
