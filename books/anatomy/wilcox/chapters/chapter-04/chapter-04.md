The coronary circulation consists of the coronary arteries and veins, together with the lymphatics of the heart. Because the lymphatics, apart from the thoracic duct, are of very limited significance to operative anatomy, they will not be discussed at any length in this chapter. The veins, relatively speaking, are similarly of less interest. In this chapter, therefore, we concentrate upon those anatomical aspects of arterial distribution that are pertinent to the surgeon, concluding with a brief discussion of the cardiac venous drainage and the cardiac lymphatics.

## THE CORONARY ARTERIES

The coronary arteries are the first branches of the ascending portion of the aorta. They take their origin from the sinuses within the aortic root, immediately above its attachment to the heart (Figure 4.1). There are three sinuses within the aortic root, but only two coronary arteries. The sinuses can be named, therefore, according to whether they give rise to an artery, the normal arrangement being a right coronary, left coronary, and non-coronary aortic sinus

(Figure 4.2). When described in this fashion, the terms 'right' and 'left' refer to the aortic sinuses giving rise to the right and left coronary arteries, rather than to the position of the sinuses relative to the right-to-left coordinates of the body (Figure 4.3). In the normal heart, the aortic root is situated obliquely, while in malformed hearts, the root is frequently positioned abnormally. Whatever the position of the aortic root, however, the two coronary arteries, when two are present, almost always take origin from those aortic sinuses that are adjacent to the sinuses of the pulmonary trunk. Because of this, it is more convenient, and more accurate, to consider these sinuses as being to the left-hand and the right-hand side of the observer standing, figuratively speaking, within the non-adjacent sinus and looking towards the pulmonary trunk (Figure 4.4). This approach to distinguishing the aortic sinuses giving rise to the coronary arteries, introduced by the group from Leiden<sup>1</sup>, holds true irrespective of the relationships of the arterial trunks. It is now conventional to describe the right-hand sinus as 'no. 1', and to distinguish the left-hand sinus as 'no. 2'. The convention becomes

particularly valuable when considering coronary arterial origins in malformed hearts (see Chapter 8).

Irrespective of the specific sinus from which they arise, the coronary arteries usually take their origin beneath the sinutubular junction (Figure 4.5). The junction is the discrete transition between the aortic root and the tubular component of the ascending aorta, and is the most obvious annular structure within the aortic root. Deviations of origin of the coronary arteries relative to the junction are not uncommon<sup>2</sup>. They are considered abnormal, in adults, when arising more than one centimetre distal to the sinutubular junction, a feature said to occur in almost one-twentieth of normal hearts<sup>3</sup>. The arterial opening can be deviated either towards the ventricle, so that the artery arises deep within the aortic sinus, or towards the aortic arch, so that the origin is outside the sinus (Figure 4.6). The displacement is of greater significance when combined with the artery taking an oblique course through the aortic wall and originating above or within an inappropriate aortic sinus. This arrangement, now known as an anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery<sup>4</sup>, is

**Fig. 4.2** The heart is photographed from above in anatomical orientation after removal of the atrial myocardium and the arterial trunks. Two sinuses of the aortic valve give rise to coronary arteries, permitting them to be named as the right and left aortic coronary sinuses. The other sinus is the non-coronary sinus, which is also non-adjacent relative to the pulmonary trunk.

typically associated with the proximal part of the artery crossing the attachment of the zone of apposition between adjacent leaflets, and is also considered to represent one variant of the intramural arrangement (Figure 4.7). It can involve either the right

coronary artery arising from the left coronary aortic valvar sinus (Figures 4.7, 4.8), an arrangement which occurs in one of every 500 individuals, or the left coronary artery arising from the right coronary aortic valvar sinus, found in one of 2000 individuals<sup>5</sup>. Both variants introduce the potential for luminal narrowing, and may provoke disturbances in myocardial perfusion<sup>6</sup>.

The left coronary artery almost always takes origin from a single orifice within the

![](_page_2_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 4.4** The cartoon demonstrates the basis of the so-called Leiden convention. The surgeon stands, figuratively speaking, in the non-coronary sinus, and looks towards the pulmonary trunk. Of the sinuses adjacent to the pulmonary trunk, one is thus to the lefthand side. This is sinus no. 2. The other sinus, to the right-hand side, is sinus no. 1. Almost without exception, the coronary arteries take origin from one or both of these sinuses. In the usual arrangement, the right coronary artery arises from sinus no. 1, and the main stem of the left coronary artery from sinus no. 2.

![](_page_2_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Fig. 4.5** The computed tomogram shows the right and left aortic sinuses as viewed from behind. It shows the usual situation in which the coronary arteries arise within the sinuses, proximal to the sinutubular junction (red dashed line).

left-hand facing sinus. In contrast, in about half of all hearts, there are two orifices within the right coronary aortic sinus (Figure 4.9). In such instances, the orifices are unequal in size, the larger giving rise to the main trunk of the right coronary artery, while the considerably smaller second orifice usually gives rise to an infundibular artery, or rarely to the artery supplying the

sinus node. In one large series<sup>7</sup>, two orifices were found in the right-hand facing sinus in almost half the cases, three orifices in 7%, and four orifices in 2%. In contrast, multiple orifices in the left coronary aortic sinus (Figure 4.10) are considerably more rare<sup>7</sup>. If unrecognised, they may create problems in the interpretation of coronary angiograms. The presence of dual orifices

in the same sinus, of course, is of far greater significance in the setting of an anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery, when one of the orifices gives rise to an artery taking an intra-arterial and intramural course, as shown in Figures 4.7 and 4.8.

Although rare, the coronary arteries, on occasion, can arise from a solitary orifice in the aortic root. This is usually within the

**Fig. 4.7** The computed tomogram, in the same orientation as in Figure 4.5, shows an intramural course of the right coronary artery. The artery crosses the peripheral attachment of the zone of apposition between the valvar leaflets guarding the right and left aortic sinuses, and takes its origin, along with the left coronary artery, from the left aortic sinus (no. 2).

right coronary aortic sinus. The artery originating from the solitary orifice can take one of two patterns. It can divide immediately into right and left coronary arteries. The left artery then passes either in front of the pulmonary trunk (Figure 4.11), between it and the aorta, or behind the arterial pedicle, before dividing

into anterior interventricular and circumflex branches. The solitary artery can also arise from the left coronary aortic sinus, branching so that the right coronary artery passes in front of the pulmonary trunk (Figure 4.12), runs between the arterial trunks, or extends behind the arterial pedicle, running through the

transverse sinus. It is the variants involving a course between the great arterial trunks that are of most significance, as they can be harbingers of sudden cardiac death<sup>6,8</sup>. There are subtle variations in the course taken by the artery as it passes between the trunks<sup>9</sup>. There are three possibilities (Figure 4.13). In the first, the artery runs

Fig. 4.8 The tubular aorta has been removed at the level of the sinutubular junction to show an anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the left aortic valvar sinus, which also gives rise to the left coronary artery. Note that the right coronary artery crosses the points of attachment of the valvar leaflets to the sinutubular junction. This is the essence of the intramural arrangement.

between the aorta and the pulmonary trunk at the level of the aortic sinutubular junction, as shown in Figures 4.7 and 4.8. The second possibility is for the artery to extend deeply within the musculature of the ventricular septum (Figure 4.14). The third possibility is for the artery to track within the tissue plane between the

pulmonary infundibular sleeve and the aortic root (Figure 4.15). This course is below the level of the hinges of the pulmonary valvar leaflets, yet not buried within the muscular ventricular septum. The fact that the artery is not within the septum may not readily be appreciated when seen from the lateral aspect (Figure 4.16). It is likely that compression on the arterial lumen will be greatest when the artery is buried within the musculature of the septum, an important consideration when assessing the need for surgical correction of the anomalous course. A still further alternative course for a solitary coronary artery, although less frequent, is when

the single artery initially follows the path of the normal right coronary artery. It then continues beyond the crux, encircling the left atrioventricular junction through the territory usually supplied by the circumflex artery, before terminating as the anterior interventricular coronary artery.

Fig. 4.12 In this heart, there is a solitary coronary artery arising from the left aortic valvar sinus. It divides into circumflex and anterior interventricular (ant. intervent.) arteries, but also gives rise to the right coronary artery, which courses across the subpulmonary infundibulum to reach the right atrioventricular groove.

grooves, the left-sided artery giving rise to two major branches. The right coronary artery emerges from the right aortic sinus and immediately enters the right

atrioventricular groove (Figure 4.17). It then encircles the tricuspid orifice, running in the right atrioventricular groove (Figure 4.18). In approximately

nine-tenths of cases, the right coronary artery gives rise to an inferior interventricular artery at the crux, albeit that the artery is usually said to be

Fig. 4.14 The computed tomogram shows the main stem of the left coronary artery arising from a solitary coronary artery, which itself arises from the right coronary aortic sinus.

Fig. 4.15 This reconstructed computed tomogram shows the anterior interventricular artery arising from the right coronary aortic sinus, and extending between the aortic root and the subpulmonary infundibulum.

posterior. Computed tomographic images now leave no doubt that the artery is inferior and interventricular (Figure 4.19). In a good proportion of these cases, the artery continues beyond the crux, where it supplies downgoing branches to the diaphragmatic surface of the left ventricle (Figure 4.20). This is right coronary arterial dominance. As the artery encircles the tricuspid orifice, it is most closely

related to the origin of the leaflets of the tricuspid valve near the take-off of its acute marginal branch. Other important branches also take origin from this encircling segment of the artery.

**Fig. 4.16** The computed tomogram shows the course of the anterior interventricular artery between the infundibulum and the aortic root previously shown in the reconstruction as Figure 4.15. It is difficult from the lateral projection to appreciate that the artery runs within the adipose tissue plane between the infundibulum and the aortic root, rather than within the musculature of the ventricular septum (see Figure 4.14).

![](_page_8_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Fig. 4.17** The operative view, seen through a median sternotomy, shows the right coronary artery as it emerges from its sinus into the right atrioventricular groove.

Immediately after its origin, the artery lies within the rightward extent of the transverse sinus, with the adjacent muscular wall representing the ventriculoinfundibular fold of the supraventricular crest. In this course, the right coronary artery gives rise to downgoing infundibular branches, which may also arise by separate orifices within the right aortic sinus. In just over half the

cases, the right coronary artery gives rise to the artery supplying the sinus node (Figure 4.21). This artery typically arises from the proximal part of the right coronary artery, but on occasion the nodal artery can arise more distally, coursing over the lateral margin of the appendage to reach the terminal groove. This is of major surgical significance (Figure 4.22)<sup>10</sup>.

The left coronary artery has a short confluent stem, usually called the left main artery by the surgeon. It emerges from the left coronary aortic sinus, and enters the left margin of the transverse sinus, being positioned behind the pulmonary trunk and beneath the left atrial appendage. It is a very short structure, rarely extending beyond one centimetre in length before bifurcating into its anterior interventricular

and circumflex branches (Figure 4.23). In some hearts, the left main artery trifurcates, with an intermediate branch present between the two major branches (Figure 4.24). The intermediate branch supplies the pulmonary surface and obtuse

margins of the left ventricle. The anterior interventricular or descending artery runs inferiorly within the anterosuperior interventricular groove, giving off diagonal branches to the pulmonary surface of the left ventricle (Figure 4.25), and the

important perforating branches that pass inferiorly into the septum (Figures 4.26, 4.27). The first septal perforating branch (Figure 4.26) is particularly important, as it is at major risk when the pulmonary valve is removed for use as a homograft. The

interventricular artery then continues towards the apex, frequently curving under the apex onto the diaphragmatic surface of the ventricles.

The circumflex branch of the left coronary artery passes backwards to run in relation to the mitral orifice. Its relationship to the orifice is most extensive when it gives rise to the inferior interventricular artery at the crux. In this circumstance, the left coronary artery is said to be dominant (Figures 4.28, 4.29). A dominant left

coronary artery, however, is found in only about one-tenth of cases. When the left coronary is not dominant, the circumflex artery usually terminates by supplying branches to the obtuse margin of the left ventricle. In almost half of normal

individuals, the circumflex artery also gives rise to the artery that supplies the sinus node.

Throughout much of their epicardial course, the arteries and their accompanying veins are encased in epicardial adipose

tissue. In some hearts, the myocardium itself may form a bridge over segments of the artery (Figure 4.30). The role of these myocardial bridges in the development of coronary arterial disease is not clear. They certainly can be an

impediment to the surgeon in efforts to isolate the artery.

We have already emphasised the significance of the origin of the important artery supplying the sinus node. This, the largest of the atrial arteries, originates

from the right coronary artery in just over half of individuals, and from the circumflex artery in the remainder (Figure 4.31). There are, however, rare variants that must also be recognised when present10. A lateral origin from the right coronary artery, with a course across the appendage, is an obvious potential danger for the standard atriotomy (Figure 4.22). The artery to the sinus node, rarely, may also take a lateral or terminal origin from the circumflex artery

(Figure 4.31). Although rare in normal individuals, our experience suggests that these variants are more frequent in congenitally malformed hearts11. In addition, the artery to the sinus node takes a variable course relative to the cavoatrial

junction. There are three possibilities (Figure 4.31). Usually, the artery courses anterocavally across the crest of the appendage to reach the node. Alternatively, it runs deeply within Waterston's groove, and passes retrocavally. It is thus intimately related to the superior rim of the oval fossa. The third possibility is for the artery to

significance. The atrioventricular nodal artery arises from the dominant coronary artery at the crux, usually from a U-turn of this artery beneath the floor of the coronary sinus. The nodal artery then passes towards the central fibrous body, running within the fibrofatty plane forming the 'meat' in the atrioventricular muscular sandwich. Having traversed the node in some hearts,

it perforates the fibrous atrioventricular junction to supply a good part of the branching atrioventricular bundle. The septal perforating arteries from the anterior interventricular artery (Figures 4.26, 4.27) always supply the anterior parts of the ventricular bundle branches. Occasionally, they also supply the greater part of the inferior ventricular conduction tissues.

## THE CORONARY VEINS

The coronary veins drain blood from the myocardium to the right atrium. The smaller anterior, and the smallest cardiac veins, drain directly to the cavity of the atrium. They are not of surgical significance. The larger veins accompany the major arteries, and drain into the

The left-hand panels show the usual arrangement with the origin from the right coronary artery, found in 55% of the population, with the rare variant of a distal origin with coursing across the appendage (lower left-hand panel). The right-hand panels show a proximal origin from the circumflex artery, found in around 45% of the population, with the rare variant of a distal origin with coursing across the dome of the left atrium. The middle panels show the variation relative to the superior cavoatrial junction. The sinus node is shown in green.

coronary sinus (Figure 4.32). The great cardiac vein runs alongside the anterior interventricular artery. It becomes the coronary sinus as it encircles the mitral orifice to enter the inferior and leftward margin of the atrioventricular groove. The coronary sinus then runs within the groove (Figure 4.33), lying between the left atrial wall and the ventricular myocardium (Figure 4.34), before draining into the right atrium between the sinus septum and the sub-Eustachian sinus. At the crux, the sinus receives the middle cardiac vein, which has ascended with the inferior

interventricular artery, and the small cardiac vein, which has encircled the tricuspid orifice in company with the right coronary artery. Occasionally, these latter two veins drain directly to the right atrium. The orifice of the coronary sinus is guarded by the Thebesian valve

(Figure 4.35), which, on very rare occasions, may be imperforate. A prominent valve is also found in the great cardiac vein where it turns around the obtuse margin of the left ventricle. This is the valve of Vieussens<sup>12</sup>. Some consider that the valve marks the transition from the great cardiac vein to the coronary sinus. An alternative view is that the coronary sinus commences at the site of drainage of the oblique vein of the left atrium (Figure 4.36).

## THE CARDIAC LYMPHATICS

Little is known about the surgical implications of the lymphatic drainage of the heart itself, although lymphatic structures exist as superficial, myocardial, and subendocardial networks<sup>13</sup>. The most important lymphatic channel within the thorax, however, is both well recognised and of particular importance. This is because, on occasion, the surgeon may need to ligate this vessel, the thoracic duct,

in patients suffering with problems in lymphatic drainage subsequent to their conversion to the Fontan circulation. The thoracic duct originates within the abdomen in the confluence of lymphatic channels known as the cysterna chyli, this structure lying on the second lumbar vertebra. It enters the right paravertebral gutter of the thorax through the aortic opening of the diaphragm, and runs within the gutter to the level of the fourth thoracic vertebra. Within the lower part of the

gutter, running beneath the arch of the aorta (Figure 4.37). It then continues superiorly and anteriorly, curving over the aortic arch between the left common carotid and subclavian arteries, to

terminate in either the left subclavian or internal jugular vein as these structures join to form the left brachiocephalic vein. The duct has a fibromuscular coat, and contains several valves along its course, with a

bifoliate valve characteristically present at its termination in the brachiocephalic vein.
