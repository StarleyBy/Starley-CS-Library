The disposition of the conduction system in the normal heart has been emphasised already (see Chapter 2). In that earlier chapter, we pointed to the importance, during surgical procedures, of avoiding the cardiac nodes and ventricular bundle branches, and scrupulously protecting the vascular supply to these structures. In this chapter, we will consider the anatomy of these tissues relative to the treatment of intractable problems of cardiac rhythm. The abnormal dispositions of the conduction tissue to be found in congenitally malformed hearts, features of obvious significance to the congenital cardiac surgeon, will be discussed in the sections devoted to those lesions in the chapters that follow. In this chapter, nonetheless, we will discuss surgical procedures performed to treat arrhythmias that develop in the setting of the Fontan circulation.

## LANDMARKS TO THE ATRIOVENTRICULAR CONDUCTION AXIS

In patients with intractable tachycardia, it may be necessary to ablate the

atrioventricular bundle. Although this sometimes occurs inadvertently, it can be surprisingly difficult to divide this structure intentionally. The landmark to penetration of the atrioventricular conduction axis through the fibrous insulating plane is the apex of the triangle of Koch (Figure 5.1). The apex is marked by the point at which the tendon of Todaro inserts into the central fibrous body (Figure 5.2). Just inferior to the apex of this triangle, the components of the atrioventricular node gather themselves together, and enter the insulating tissues of the fibrous body (Figures 5.3, 5.4). Once insulated from the atrial myocardial mass, the conduction axis becomes the penetrating atrioventricular bundle, better known as the bundle of His. This part of the overall atrioventricular conduction axis is short, but extends leftwards as it pierces the fibrous body. As the axis passes through the fibrous tissue, and divides into its branches, the fibrous tissue, which forms the membranous septum, is crossed by the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve, dividing it into atrioventricular and interventricular components. The interventricular component of the septum is often occupied by the non-branching component of the conduction axis. Further anteriorly, the axis reaches the crest of the muscular septum, immediately beneath the fibrous membranous septum (Figure 5.5). It divides here, with the branches of the left bundle cascading down the smooth left surface of the muscular ventricular septum. When viewed from the left, the branching bundle is intimately related to the subaortic outflow tract, with the fibrous triangle separating the non-coronary and right coronary leaflets of the aortic valve marking the take-off of the left bundle branches (Figure 5.6). Sometimes, the branching bundle lies below the septal crest, being carried on the left ventricular aspect of the septum<sup>1</sup>. Having given rise to the left bundle branches, the right bundle branch takes origin from the axis, burrowing intramyocardially to reach the right side of the septum, and surfacing beneath the medial papillary muscle. The axis itself continues beyond the origin of the right bundle branch, entering the aortic root as the dead-end tract<sup>2</sup>. Often unrecognised. this rudimentary structure may prove to be significant as a substrate for outflow tract tachycardias. Taken together, the site of the conduction axis can be determined by taking a line from the apex of the triangle of Koch to the medial papillary muscle (Figure 5.7). In terms of the atrial

components of the axis, the compact atrioventricular node, located within the triangle of Koch, is positioned some distance posterior to the attachment of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve. It is well superior to the orifice of the coronary sinus.

### **VENTRICULAR PRE-EXCITATION**

Ventricular pre-excitation is a frequent problem of cardiac rhythm that necessitates knowledge of the pertinent anatomy for its optimal treatment. The arrhythmia occurs when all, or part, of the ventricular myocardium is excited earlier than would be expected had the impulse reached the ventricles by way of the normal atrioventricular conduction system<sup>3</sup>. There are various anatomical pathways, proven

and hypothetical, that can produce this phenomenon. Essentially, they are pathways that short circuit part, or all, of the normal delay induced within the atrioventricular conduction axis. Most of this delay occurs within the atrioventricular node and its zones of transitional cells, but an increment of delay reflects the time

taken for the impulse to traverse the ventricular bundle branches, as these structures are insulated from the septal myocardium. Accessory pathways can exist between the atrium and the atrioventricular bundle, producing atrio-Hisian tracts, and between the conduction axis and the crest of the ventricular septum, the latter

arrangement first being described by Mahaim as paraspecific connections<sup>4</sup> . These are not amenable to surgical division. In contrast, the accessory atrioventricular pathways that produce the Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome, probably the most common form of pre-excitation, are very much amenable to

surgical division<sup>5</sup> . Now, however, if division is necessary, the pathways will almost certainly be ablated in the catheter laboratory. Surgical treatment of this

arrhythmia, nonetheless, constituted an important step in the evolution of cardiac surgery. When treatment was first mooted, the bundles were called, inappropriately,

bundles of Kent<sup>5</sup> . The atrioventricular muscular strands that are part of the circuit responsible for the abnormal rhythm join together the atrial and ventricular

myocardial muscle masses outside the area of the specialised conduction tissues (Figure 5.8). The best initial description of the bundles was given by Ohnell<sup>6</sup> . His illustration (Figure 5.9) shows that the structures, which typically extend through the fat pad on the epicardial aspect of the valvar annulus, bear no resemblance to the node-like remnants described by Kent, and inappropriately considered by him to be part of the normal conduction system (Figure 5.10). In reality, they are remnants of a ring of specialised conducting tissue that surrounds the atrioventricular canal of the developing heart. They are found as complete rings in animals such as the mouse or rat<sup>7</sup> , and the remnants can be found by careful examination of human hearts<sup>8</sup> . Only in abnormal situations, however (see later), do the node-like remnants give rise to anomalous muscular atrioventricular connections. The abnormal accessory muscular bundles that are the substrate for

![](_page_5_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 5.10** The illustration is taken from one of Kent's demonstrations to the Society of Physiology, and relabelled by us. It shows the structure of remnants of conduction tissue found adjacent to the right atrioventricular junction. The node-like structure bears no resemblance to the accessory connections that produce Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome (see Figures 5.8 and 5.9), but can rarely give rise to an anomalous connection (see Figure 5.16).

the Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome (Figure 5.8) can be found anywhere around the atrioventricular junctions. They are best described as being left-sided, right-sided, and paraseptal. The anatomy of each group shows significant differences.

Left-sided pathways are found at any point around the mural component of the mitral valvar orifice. Pathways can extend through the area of aortic-mitral valvar fibrous continuity, but are exceedingly rare. The pathways almost always cross from the atrial to the ventricular muscle masses outside a well-formed fibrous annulus, with the fibrous structure supporting the hinge of the mural leaflet of the mitral valve (Figure 5.8). The atrial origins of the connections are very close to the fibrous junction<sup>9</sup>. The bundles themselves usually skirt very close to the fibrous tissue, often branching into several roots, which then insert into the ventricular mvocardium. The bundles are rarely thicker than one to two millimetres in diameter, and are made up of ordinary working cardiomyocytes. On occasions, there may be more than one bundle in the

same patient<sup>9</sup>. If approached from within the atrium, incisions that divide the atrial myocardium, or ablative lesions placed above the origin of the leaflets of the mitral valve, are unlikely to divide the accessory muscle bundles themselves. In order to ablate the accessory connection surgically, it was usually necessary to dissect within the fat pad on the epicardial aspect of the annulus, or to approach the pathway from the epicardium. If approached endocardially, it was necessary to reflect the coronary vessels to expose the accessory muscle bundles. When treated in the catheter laboratory, lesions are usually placed on the ventricular aspect of the hingepoint of the mitral valve.

Right-sided accessory pathways may also pass through the fat pad to connect the atrial and ventricular myocardial masses. More frequently, bundles on the right side are found some distance away from the attachment of the leaflets of the tricuspid valve, which is rarely a firm and well-formed fibrous junction, as is usually the case on the left side. Right-sided connections can be multiple, and can

coexist with left-sided pathways. They are frequently associated with Ebstein's malformation, and may need to be treated concomitantly with repair or replacement of the abnormal tricuspid valve. They can be found at any point within the parietal aspect of the tricuspid orifice, from the site of the membranous septum to the mouth of the coronary sinus (Figure 5.11). The same rules for their ablation apply as discussed for left-sided connections.

It is connections in the paraseptal position that constitute the greatest clinical challenge<sup>10</sup>. When viewed from the right atrium, they can cross from the atrial to the ventricular myocardium (Figure 5.12) at any point between the mouth of the coronary sinus and the supraventricular crest. They present problems for ablation, firstly, because they may run deep within the floor of the triangle of Koch as viewed from the right atrium. The second problem is that the atrioventricular node and bundle are also found within this area. The anatomy of the area is best illustrated by dissections

that have removed the atrial walls from the base of the ventricular mass (Figure 5.13). Such dissections reveal the cranial continuation of the inferior atrioventricular groove, which extends as

a layer of fibroadipose tissue between the atrial and ventricular muscle masses, reaching the central fibrous body when traced cranially. The artery to the atrioventricular node courses forwards

within this tissue plane (Figure 5.13). The atrioventricular node itself occupies the superior part of the atrial layer of this triangular sandwich, with the fibroadipose tissue representing the

The artery to the atrioventricular (AV) node runs within the adipose tissue, in this case from a dominant left coronary artery.

'meat' between the muscular layers of the sandwich. Accessory muscular connections may cross through this insulating layer at any point from the attachment of the mitral and tricuspid valves at either side of the muscular ventricular septum. Indeed, the only connection that has been identified morphologically within this area was located at the insertion of the tricuspid valve (Figure 5.12)<sup>9</sup>. If necessary, the fibroadipose tissue plane can be entered surgically from the cavity of the right atrium, or can be reached by dissection from the epicardial aspect. Incisions within the atrial component of this atrioventricular sandwich, interrupting the muscular approaches to the atrioventricular node, have also been shown to interrupt reciprocating atrioventricular nodal tachycardias<sup>11</sup>. Treatment of these latter arrhythmias is also accomplished now with efficiency and safety using catheter ablation (Figure 5.14). When treating these arrhythmias, either surgically or by

catheter ablation, it should be remembered that the triangle of Koch contains both the atrioventricular node and its nutrient artery. Unless performed with care, there is always the danger that intervention can produce complete atrioventricular dissociation.

Surgeons and catheter ablationists, when attempting to treat arrhythmias, have conventionally referred to the floor of the triangle of Koch as being septal. They also describe an anterior septum in the region cranial to the membranous septum<sup>12</sup>. By this, they mean the area of the right atrioventricular junction that lies adjacent to the supraventricular crest. It is a mistake to describe this part of the right atrioventricular junction as being septal, just as it is incorrect to consider the atrial aspect of the triangle of Koch as representing a septal structure. In reality, the so-called anterior septum is the medial margin of the ventriculoinfundibular fold. If muscular atrioventricular connections exist in this area, they will join the atrial wall to the supraventricular crest of the right ventricle

(Figure 5.15). Experience has also shown that muscular connections running to the most lateral margin of the supraventricular crest at the acute margin of the right ventricle can produce the electrocardiographic pattern initially attributed to the so-called Mahaim connections<sup>13</sup>. Such connections, when removed surgically from the acute margin, were shown to resemble the tissues of the atrioventricular node histologically. We had previously identified such a pathway running across the right atrioventricular junction (Figure 5.16)<sup>9</sup>. The atrial component of these connections is remarkably reminiscent of the illustrations provided by Kent (Figure 5.10). Kent had argued, incorrectly, that the nodal remnants were pathways for normal atrioventricular conduction<sup>14</sup>. Under abnormal circumstances, nonetheless, these node-like remnants are able to function as the atrial origin of specialised muscular accessory connections<sup>15</sup>. It is these connections that now are known to produce ventricular preexcitation of the Mahaim type.

## SUBSTRATES FOR OTHER SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIAS

The attention of both surgeons and interventionists has focused on the

substrates of other supraventricular tachycardias, particularly atrial flutter and fibrillation. Atrial flutter of the commonest type has shown itself to be especially amenable to interventional therapy. The usual flutter circuit is known to pass in

counter-clockwise fashion (Figure 5.17), running down the terminal crest before ascending through the septal isthmus of the tricuspid valvar vestibule <sup>16</sup>. The most inferior part of the circuit passes through another muscular isthmus, this time

The tricuspid valve was deformed by Ebstein's malformation. An accessory muscular connection was identified taking origin from a nodal remnant as identified by Kent, and crossing the insulating plane to run within the muscularised leaflet of the tricuspid valve.(Section reproduced by kind permission of Professor Anton Becker, University of Amsterdam.)

**Fig. 5.17** The right atrium has been opened and photographed in anatomical orientation to show the circuit (arrows) known to be responsible for the common variant of atrial flutter.

limited by the orifice of the inferior caval vein and the hinge of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve (Figure 5.18). The isthmus has three discrete areas, containing various combinations of fibrous and muscular tissue (Figure 5.19)<sup>17</sup>. Interventionists now

are able to construct lines of block with great facility so as to divide the circuit. Care should be taken in the vestibular area to avoid damage to the right coronary artery (Figure 5.19). Such lines obviously would be made surgically with equal facility. This

is the reasoning behind the surgical manoeuvres performed as part of the treatment of patients with the Fontan circulation, known as the Fontan conversion<sup>18</sup>, to be discussed in greater detail later.

**Fig. 5.19** This histological section, prepared by Professor Siew Yen Ho, shows the structure of the three components of the inferior cavotricuspid isthmus. Note the adjacency of the right coronary artery to the vestibular musculature in the anterior compartment.

The other arrhythmia now becoming increasingly amenable to interventional therapy is atrial fibrillation. It has long been known that surgical techniques that create mazes<sup>19</sup> or corridors<sup>20</sup> can certainly ameliorate, if not cure, this troublesome entity. The operative procedures are complex and time consuming. The maze procedure, for example, has undergone many modifications<sup>21</sup>, details of which are beyond the context of our description, although we describe the third iteration

designed by Cox when considering treatment of postoperative arrhythmias (see later). More recently, interventionists have shown that it is feasible to construct lines of block within both the left and right atriums, lesions which can provide successful treatment for atrial fibrillation <sup>22,23</sup>. It has also been shown that a proportion of cases of fibrillation can be cured by making focal lesions in the mouth of the pulmonary veins <sup>24</sup>. This is because the atrial myocardium extends for variable

distances along the pulmonary veins from the venoatrial junctions (Figure 5.20). These sleeves of myocardium contain bundles of cardiomyocytes running in different directions, along with separating sheaths of fibrous tissue, which set the scene for the focal triggering that produces the fibrillation<sup>25,26</sup>. It has been suggested that the cardiomyocytes within the sleeves are histologically specialised<sup>27</sup>. This is a spurious claim. The cardiomyocytes are all of working myocardial origin, with the

**Fig. 5.20** The dissection, made by Professor Damien Sanchez-Quintana, shows the dome of the left atrium, the epicardium having been removed to illustrate the organisation of the myocardial fibres. Sleeves of myocardium (arrows) can be seen to extend onto the pulmonary veins for varying distances. These sleeves are now known to be the sources of focal activity in some variants of atrial fibrillation.

pulmonary venous myocardium never having had the characteristics of conduction tissues<sup>28</sup>.

### SUBSTRATES FOR OUTFLOW TRACT TACHYCARDIAS

Experience shows that some ventricular tachycardias can be cured by placing lesions in the region of the bases of the arterial valvar sinuses<sup>29</sup>. Such lesions are placed most frequently in the adjacent sinuses of the aorta and pulmonary trunk. As we have shown in Chapter 3, these sinuses, at their bases, contain crescents of

ventricular muscle, as the semilunar hinges of the valvar leaflets cross the anatomical ventriculoarterial junctions (Figures 5.21. 5.22). It is most likely that the abnormal rhythms producing the outflow tract tachycardias take their origin within these myocardial crescents. It is also known, however, that abnormal rhythms can rarely be cured by ablative lesions placed in the non-adjacent sinus of the aortic root<sup>29</sup>. It is rare to find myocardium within the base of this non-adjacent sinus. Sometimes the aortic valve, like the pulmonary valve, can be supported by a complete muscular infundibulum<sup>30</sup>. If present, such infundibular musculature would produce a crescent within the non-adjacent sinus. In the absence of such musculature, however, it must be presumed that the abnormal rhythm has an extraventricular origin. It is also known that, sometimes, the outflow tract tachycardias are ablated by lesions placed distal to the ventriculoarterial junction<sup>31</sup>. During their development, the arterial roots are encased within turrets of outflow tract myocardium, which then regress as part of the normal developmental process<sup>32</sup>. Persistence of parts of this sleeve of outflow tract myocardium provides the best explanation for the origins of those arrhythmias originating distal to the ventriculoarterial junctions.

**Fig. 5.22** The aortic root has been opened, and the valvar leaflets removed. There is muscle at the base of the two aortic valvar sinuses giving rise to the coronary arteries (stars), but not in the non-adjacent sinus.

# ARRHYTHMIA SURGERY IN PATIENTS WITH CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE

As patients get older, subsequent to surgical correction of congenital cardiac lesions, increasing numbers present with arrhythmic problems<sup>33</sup>. The enhanced understanding of the macro-re-entrant circuits responsible for the abnormal rhythms has led to modifications of surgical techniques. Advances in the design of pacemakers and

implantable cardiac defibrillators have also contributed to improved treatments<sup>33</sup>, but such details are beyond the scope of our current discussion. Knowledge of the anatomical background for the created therapeutic lines of block, nonetheless, now achieves increasing significance. The commonest arrhythmias requiring treatment are macro-re-entrant atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and ventricular tachycardia. Such problems are themselves encountered most frequently in postoperative patients

with functionally univentricular hearts, and those who have undergone surgical treatment of tetralogy of Fallot or transposition. The reasoning behind the therapeutic approach is to transform areas of slow conduction to areas of no conduction<sup>34</sup>. This is achieved by interrupting myocardial corridors or isthmuses between obstacles or scars, while preserving sinus rhythm and normal atrioventricular conduction.

The commonest operations are the right atrial maze, typically performed for

Fig. 5.25 The cartoon shows the lesions producing the right atrial maze procedure as part of the Fontan conversion procedure.

those with macro-re-entrant tachycardia, and the Cox maze III procedure for patients with atrial fibrillation. The right atrial maze procedure involves the resection of the tip of the right atrial appendage, and part of its anterior surface if the appendage is significantly enlarged, as is often the case in patients with failed Fontan circulations. Lines of block are

then created from the edge of the resected appendage to the oval fossa, from the oval fossa across the terminal crest, and then a series of lines to divide the cavotricuspid isthmus (Figure 5.23). The lines dividing the isthmus run from the edge of the oval fossa to the margin of the coronary sinus (Figure 5.24), from the mouth of the coronary sinus to the mouth

of the inferior caval vein, and from the inferior caval vein to the hinge of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve. The last lesion is obviously not possible in those with tricuspid atresia due to absence of the right atrioventricular connection, but the other lines can easily be created in this setting (Figure 5.25).

![](_page_14_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 5.26** The cartoon shows the lesions produced in the third iteration of the Cox maze procedure for treatment of atrial fibrillation.

In the third iteration of the series of procedures designed by Cox for treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation (Figure 5.26)<sup>21</sup>, the lines of block can be produced either by surgical incisions, or by cryoablation. An extensive line is created within the roof of the left atrium, encircling the orifices of all pulmonary veins. A line of block is then created to the mouth of the left atrial appendage, which can be excised, or alternatively encircled by another line. A linear lesion is then made from the line encircling the pulmonary veins to the annulus of the mitral valve in the region of the third scallop of the mural leaflet. The final lesion is placed epicardially across the coronary sinus as it runs within the left atrioventricular groove. If using cryoablation, the final lesion is maintained for two minutes, while the other requires only one minute of freezing at minus 160 degrees Celsius.
