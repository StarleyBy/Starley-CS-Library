It is axiomatic that a thorough knowledge of valvar anatomy is a prerequisite for successful surgery, be it valvar replacement or reconstruction. The surgeon will also require a firm understanding of the arrangement of other aspects of cardiac anatomy to ensure safe access to a diseased valve or valves. These features were described in the previous chapter. Knowledge of the surgical anatomy of the valves themselves, however, must be founded on appreciation of their component parts, the relationships of the individual valves to each other, and their relationships to the chambers and arterial trunks within which they reside. This requires understanding of, firstly, the basic orientation of the cardiac valves, emphasising the intrinsic features that make each valve distinct from the others. This information must be supplemented by attention to their relationships with other structures that the surgeon must avoid, notably the conduction tissues and the major channels of the coronary circulation. For this chapter, throughout our narrative we will presume the presence of a normally structured heart, lying in its usual position, and without any coexisting congenital cardiac malformations.

#### THE VALVAR COMPLEXES

When considering the valves, we distinguish between the atrioventricular valves, which guard the atrioventricular iunctions, and the arterial valves, which guard the ventriculoarterial junctions (Figure 3.1). The atrioventricular valves are best analysed in terms of the valvar complex, made up of the annulus, the leaflets, the tendinous cords, the papillary muscles, and the supporting ventricular musculature (Figure 3.2). All of these components must work in harmony so as to achieve valvar competence<sup>1</sup>. The leaflets of the atrioventricular valves are supplied with a complex tension apparatus, as they must withstand the full force of ventricular systole, so as to retain their competence when in their closed position. The arterial valves are also a combination of complex anatomical parts. Often named the semilunar valves, it is the leaflets that are semilunar, being hinged within the overall valvar complex, which extends from the proximal ventriculoarterial orifice, a virtual ring constructed at the nadir of the hinges of the leaflets, to the sinutubular junction (Figure 3.3). The components of the

valvar complex are the leaflets, their supporting arterial sinuses, and the fibrous interleaflet triangles. In the right ventricle, the arterial sinuses are supported at the ventricular base exclusively by infundibular myocardium. The junction between the myocardial walls and the fibroelastic walls of the sinuses, the anatomical ventriculoarterial junction, forms one of the two true anatomical rings to be found within the pulmonary root (Figure 3.4). The other obvious anatomical ring is the sinutubular junction. In the left ventricle, only the two coronary arterial valvar sinuses are supported by ventricular musculature, with the sinus and leaflet of the noncoronary aortic sinus being contiguous with one of the leaflets of the mitral valve (Figure 3.5). It is still possible, nonetheless, to recognise the ring formed at the junction between the ventricular supporting structures and the fibroelastic walls of the sinuses, and to recognise the fibrous interleaflet triangles extending distally to the level of the sinutubular junction. As in the pulmonary root, the sinutubular junction is the other obvious anatomical ring to be found within the aortic root (Figures 3.4, 3.5). In both of

the roots, the distal margins of the semilunar hinges of the leaflets are attached at the sinutubular junctions (Figures 3.4, 3.5).

When comparisons are made between the overall arrangement of the atrioventricular and arterial valvar complexes, one fundamental difference is that the leaflets of the atrioventricular valves are suspended in true annular fashion at the atrioventricular junctions (Figure 3.2), whereas in the arterial valves,

Fig. 3.4 The ventriculoarterial junction of the right ventricle has been cut anteriorly, and opened out. The valvar leaflets have been removed, their remnants revealing their initial semilunar attachments. Note how these hinges cross the circular anatomical junction between the muscular infundibulum and the walls of the pulmonary valvar sinuses (white dashed line). All the leaflets are supported by muscle, which therefore forms the basal part of each of the sinuses of Valsalva. The distal attachments, however, are at the sinutubular junction.

![](_page_2_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Fig. 3.5** The ventriculoarterial junction of the left ventricle has been opened and splayed in comparable fashion to that in Figure 3.4, and again the leaflets of the aortic valve have been removed, revealing the semilunar attachments. In the left ventricle, because of the fibrous continuity with the aortic leaflet of the mitral valve, only two of the aortic valvar leaflets have muscular support. The semilunar hinges, however, still cross the circular anatomical ventriculoarterial junction.

the leaflets are hinged in semilunar fashion, with the attachments crossing the anatomical ventriculoarterial junctions (Figures 3.4, 3.5). It is these differences that underscore the problems currently existing in the use of the word 'annulus' when describing the morphology of the cardiac valves<sup>2</sup>. Indeed, the fashion in which the same words have been used in

different ways to describe the components of the various valves has led to much of the confusion surrounding their specific anatomy, as was evidenced in a recent questionnaire answered by cardiac surgeons working in worldwide centres<sup>3</sup>. Thus, some consider that, while the atrioventricular valves possess leaflets, the moving components of the arterial valves

should be considered as cusps. Our preference is to achieve uniformity by describing these working parts in both the atrioventricular and arterial valves as the leaflets<sup>2</sup>. As we have already discussed, it is the individual leaflets of the arterial valves that are semilunar, reflecting the shape of the attachments of the hinges. The overall anatomical complexes guarding the

![](_page_3_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 3.6** The aortic valve has been photographed from above, with the leaflets in their closed positions. As can be seen, the zones of apposition between the leaflets (red double-headed arrows) extend from the peripheral sinutubular junction to the valvar centroid (white circle). In anatomical terms, these zones are the commissures between the leaflets. Conventionally, however, it is the peripheral attachments (stars) that are usually defined as the commissures.

ventriculoarterial junctions, therefore, are best considered as being arterial rather than semilunar. With regard to the leaflets, nonetheless, it follows that, because of their semilunar shape, they are supported in crown-like fashion within the arterial roots. There is often a degree of fibrous thickening that reinforces these attachments, the fibrous thickenings being more obvious in the aortic than the pulmonary valve (compare Figures 3.4 and 3.5), but becoming more marked in the pulmonary valve with ageing. When considered as a unit, the semilunar attachments are not strictly circular, and hence not annular. The remnants of the leaflets are often described during surgical procedures as representing the valvar 'annulus'3. Echocardiographers, in contrast, measure the virtual ring marking the entrance to the valvar complex as the annulus, and report this dimension to the surgeon<sup>2</sup>. This discrepancy must harbour the potential for confusion<sup>4</sup>. Consensus is now growing, therefore, that surgeons should also consider this virtual ring as representing the valvar annulus<sup>2–4</sup>. It would be optimal if the entrance to the roots was simply described as the valvar diameter, but this might be too much to hope for.

Further potential difficulties arise with the use of the word 'commissure'. When

used anatomically, a commissure describes a line of junction between adjacent structures, as in the evelids or lips. These structures, with two moving parts, have a solitary commissure, which has two ends. An alternative definition for 'commissure', however, is the end-point of a zone of apposition<sup>2</sup>. This is the fashion in which 'commissure' has been used traditionally when describing the cardiac valves, and such usage is unlikely to change<sup>3</sup>. But, in addition to taking note of the ends of the zones of apposition, it is also important to acknowledge the structure of the zones of apposition themselves, which extend from the commissures to the valvar centroid<sup>4</sup>. There are three such zones of apposition to be found in the arterial valves (Figure 3.6), and also in the tricuspid valve. In the mitral valve, in contrast, there is a solitary zone of apposition (Figure 3.7).

# POSITION AND SUPPORT OF THE VALVES WITHIN THE HEART

In the left heart, the leaflets of the atrioventricular and arterial valves are in close proximity to each other within the atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial junctions (Figure 3.1), but their hinges are well separated within the right heart. These differences, and the overall arrangement of

the four cardiac valves, are best appreciated by examining the short axis cylindrical section of the heart (Figure 3.8). The leaflets of three of the valves are in fibrous continuity with one another within this cylinder, although descriptions of a fibrous skeleton providing support for the leaflets within the atrioventricular junctions are grossly exaggerated. The arterial sinuses of the pulmonary valve are supported exclusively by ventricular muscle, specifically by the free-standing right ventricular infundibulum (Figures 3.3, 3.9). More distally, the valvar leaflets are hinged from the arterial wall rather than the infundibular muscle, with the distal attachments being at the sinutubular junction, where they form the commissures, a similar arrangement pertaining for the aortic valve (Figure 3.10). When considered in attitudinally appropriate fashion, the pulmonary valve is the most anterior and superior valve, the tricuspid valve is the most inferior, with the mitral valve being the most posterior of the four. The aortic valve is centrally located relative to its neighbours, and is rightwards and posterior to the pulmonary valve, even though it guards the exit of the left ventricle.

The concept of an extensive fibrous skeleton supporting the leaflets of all four

There is a solitary zone of apposition (white dashed line) between the aortic and mural leaflets, but conventionally it is the ends of this zone of apposition (white circles) that are defined as the valvar commissures.

valves within the muscular cylinder forming the base of the ventricular mass, appealing as it may be, is far from reality. The pulmonary valvar leaflets have no direct relationship to the leaflets of the other valves (Figures 3.9, 3.11). The leaflets of the two atrioventricular valves have limited fibrous support within the atrioventricular junctions, but it is the

relationships of the aortic leaflet of the mitral valve that underscore the presence of the greatest fibrous support within the cardiac base. This leaflet of the mitral valve is in direct fibrous continuity with two of the leaflets of the aortic valve, with the continuity producing the aortic-mitral curtain which forms the roof of the left ventricle. The area of fibrous continuity is

thickened at both its ends, serving to anchor the aortic-mitral valvar unit to the ventricular musculature across the short axis of the left ventricle (Figure 3.11). These thickenings are called the right and left fibrous trigones, respectively. The right fibrous trigone is itself continuous with the membranous septum, with the conjunction of these two fibrous

components forming the strongest part of the fibrous support. The conjoined structure is called the central fibrous body. The fibrous area formed by the membranous septum continues cranially to the level of the sinutubular junction. This wall of the aortic root, interposing between two of the valvar sinuses, is one of the interleaflet fibrous triangles (Figure 3.12).

Included in the central fibrous body, therefore, is this interleaflet fibrous

Fig. 3.11 To produce this picture, the heart has been dissected to parallel the parasternal long axis echocardiographic plane (compare with Figure 3.1). The arterial roots, however, have been left intact in this specimen, as has the mitral valve, albeit with the arterial roots cleaned to show the free-standing sleeve of subpulmonary infundibular musculature that lifts the leaflets of the pulmonary valve away from the base of the ventricular mass. Note the area of fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the aortic and mitral valves forming part of the roof of the left ventricle. The ends are thickened to form the right and left fibrous trigones.

Fig. 3.12 To produce this image, the interleaflet triangle between the right and non-coronary aortic leaflets has been removed, and the heart has been photographed from the right side. The base of the triangle is formed by the interventricular component of the membranous septum. The white asterisks show the cut edge of the ventriculoinfundibular fold, which forms the greater part of the supraventricular crest. The most apical part of the removed triangle, however, encroaches on the transverse sinus, showing that this area was initially part of the parietal wall of the left ventricle.

triangle, which fills the gap between two of the semilunar hinges of the leaflets of the aortic valve, in this instance the space between the non-coronary and right coronary leaflets (Figure 3.10). The location of the fibrous triangle can best be perceived from the right side, the fibrous tissue forming its floor having been removed (Figure 3.12). The triangle is seen to extend superiorly to the level of the aortic sinutubular junction, thus separating the most distal part of the left ventricular cavity from the right side of the transverse sinus.

Similar small triangles of fibrous tissue form the most distal parts of the spaces between the other leaflets of the aortic valve<sup>5</sup>. The triangle between the noncoronary and the left coronary leaflets is itself confluent with the area of fibrous continuity between the aortic and mitral valves (Figure 3.13). When the triangle is removed, and the heart photographed from behind, it can be seen how the fibrous tissue separates the left ventricular outflow tract from the middle part of the transverse sinus (Figure 3.14). The much smaller triangle separating the two coronary leaflets of the aortic valve separates the left ventricular outflow tract from the tissue

plane that runs between the aortic root and the free-standing right ventricular infundibulum (Figure 3.15). Taken overall, therefore, the fibrous components of the aortic root form a three-pronged crown extending to the level of the sinutubular junction (Figure 3.16). The fibrous tissue forming the crown-like aortic root continues into the left atrioventricular junction, where it supports the hinge of the mural leaflet of the mitral valve (Figure 3.17). The extent of this support. however, varies markedly from heart to heart<sup>6</sup>. It is rare to find a complete cord of fibrous tissue (Figure 3.18) encircling the mitral valvar orifice. In many places the hinge of the leaflet is supported by a fibrous shelf, or in some instances only by the fibrofatty tissues of the left atrioventricular groove, which also serve to insulate the atrial from the ventricular myocardium. The arrangement in which the fibrofatty tissues insulate the atrial from the ventricular muscle masses (Figure 3.19) is the rule around the orifice of the tricuspid valve. It is very rare to find the valvar leaflets supported by a fibrous annulus. Paradoxically, the solitary normal area of atrioventricular muscular continuity. namely the penetrating bundle of His,

pierces the strongest part of the fibrous skeleton, specifically through the atrioventricular component of the membranous septum. This point is conveniently marked for the surgeon by the attachment to the central fibrous body of another fibrous structure, the tendon of Todaro. This fibrous cord extends through the muscle of the right atrial wall, attaching to the right-sided aspect of the membranous septum, and forming the atrial boundary of the triangle of Koch (Figure 3.20).

It follows from the above discussion that it is incorrect to speak of either an aortic or a pulmonary valvar 'ring' in the sense of a collagenous structure supporting the valvar leaflets. Rather than being hinged in uniplanar circular fashion, the leaflets of the arterial valves have semilunar attachments within the arterial roots (Figures 3.4, 3.5). True uniplanar rings, two of them, do exist within the structure of each arterial root, but neither is confluent with the semilunar attachments of the leaflets, and neither is taken by surgeons to represent the valvar annulus. The most obvious anatomical ring, the anatomical ventriculoarterial junction. becomes evident only when the valvar

leaflets themselves have been removed, being best seen in the pulmonary valve (Figure 3.4). The semilunar attachments of the leaflets cross this ring so that the upper extremity of each leaflet is attached to another obvious anatomical ring, namely the sinutubular junction (Figure 3.3).

There is a third 'ring' within the arterial roots, but this one is a virtual rather than an anatomical structure. It is formed by joining together the most proximal parts of the valvar hinges (Figure 3.3). The virtual ring, however, has particular clinical significance, as this is the ring identified by

echocardiographers as the valvar annulus<sup>2</sup>. As now suggested by the German Working Group concerned with surgical treatment of the aortic valve<sup>3</sup>, the overall situation would become much clearer if surgeons also accepted this virtual ring as representing the valvar annulus.

These are the fibrous components of the annuluses of the atrioventricular valves.

There is minimal extension, however, around the orifice of the tricuspid valve (stars). The red dotted line and the white triangles show the continuity between the leaflets of the aortic and mitral valves.

# BASIC MORPHOLOGY OF THE ATRIOVENTRICULAR VALVES

The mitral and tricuspid valves, as we have seen, have several important features in

common, which permit their collective description in terms of a valvar complex (Figure 3.1)<sup>1</sup>. The first feature is the attachments of the valvar leaflets to the atrioventricular junctions. As discussed

earlier, this is appropriately termed the annulus of the atrioventricular valves, albeit that it is not always a firm and continuous collagenous cord. A second feature is the arrangement of the leaflets.

![](_page_10_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 3.18** This histological section is through the mural leaflet of the mitral valve. Note that, at this particular part of the junction, there is a cord-like annulus anchoring the leaflet at the atrioventricular junction. It is the exception rather than the rule, however, to find such cords supporting the full length of the mural leaflet<sup>6</sup>.

![](_page_10_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Fig. 3.19** The histological section across the right atrioventricular junction shows that it is the fibrofatty tissue of the atrioventricular groove that, at all points except the penetration of the bundle of His, insulates the right atrial from the right ventricular myocardium. There is no fibrous 'annulus' supporting the hinge of the tricuspid valve.

Histologically, these structures have a spongy atrial and a fibrous ventricular layer. The atrial myocardium inserts for varying distances between the endocardium and the spongy layer. On rare occasions, fronds of ventricular

musculature may extend into the fibrous layer. In normal valves, blood vessels are found only within the segment of leaflet containing muscular fronds. The leaflets are supported by the tendinous cords, which themselves insert into the papillary

muscles, or directly into the ventricular myocardium. These cordal attachments are the third feature common to both tricuspid and mitral valves, although there are fundamental differences in the way each of the cordal units is arranged. This is also the

Fig. 3.20 This picture, taken in the operating room, shows how the continuation of the Eustachian valve, inserting as the tendon of Todaro into the membranous septum (white dashed circle), demarcates the atrial border of the triangle of Koch. The star marks the site of the atrioventricular node, located at the apex of the triangle.

case with the fourth feature, namely the papillary muscles. The differences in these various features readily permit the morphological differentiation of the valves. Before describing these differences, it is important to emphasise again those features of the leaflets and their tension apparatus that are common to both valves.

Considered as a whole, the leaflets form a continuous skirt that hangs from the atrioventricular junction. The skirt itself is divided into discrete components, with these individual sections representing the individual leaflets. Sadly, there is no current consensus as to how many leaflets there are in each valve, nor as to what constitutes the point of separation of one leaflet from the other. Traditionally, the tricuspid valve, as indicated by its name. has been considered to have three leaflets. Some have argued that the valve has only two leaflets<sup>7</sup>, albeit that our studies lend no support to this concept<sup>8</sup>. The alternative name for the mitral valve is the bicuspid valve. Yet it has been suggested that this valve is best considered as having four<sup>9</sup>, or even six leaflets<sup>10</sup>. These ongoing arguments illustrate the difficulties that exist in defining individual leaflets. Some

have sought to achieve such definition by identifying the so-called commissures between them. This necessitates defining a commissure. Surgeons usually take the commissures as the peripheral attachments of a breach in the skirt of valvar tissue. For the atrioventricular valves, these breaches are supported by fan-shaped commissural cords, such cords then inserting into a major papillary muscle or papillary muscle group (Figure 3.21). This concept depends on defining one variable structure in terms of another, which is itself variable. In terms of philosophy, this is a poor principle. So as to define commissures in this fashion, the valve is also assessed in the opened position. Yet, as all surgeons know, in order to function properly, the leaflets of the valve must fit together snugly when closed. Because of this, we prefer to define the extent of the leaflets according to the location of the zones of apposition between them. It is thus the peripheral extents of these zones of apposition that become the commissures, and the areas of the skirt between them that represent the leaflets.

The leaflets themselves are supported by tendinous cords. The ends of the zones of apposition between the adjacent leaflets are usually supported by fan-shaped cords, and these are defined as commissural cords (Figure 3.21). In addition to the fan-shaped cord, the entire free edges of the leaflets are normally uniformly supported by cords (Figure 3.22). As was indicated by Frater<sup>11</sup> when discussing the exquisitely complex categorisation of cords proposed by the group from Toronto<sup>12</sup>, if any of these cords supporting the free edge are cut, the valve may become regurgitant. We agree with Frater<sup>11</sup> that, for the purposes of categorisation, it is sufficient simply to distinguish those cords supporting the free edge (Figure 3.22) from those supporting the rough zone (Figure 3.23). The detailed classification proposed by the Toronto group 12 has little, if any, surgical utility.

The cords from the rough zone are prominent structures that extend from the papillary muscles to the ventricular aspect of the leaflets. Some of the cords to the rough zone are particularly prominent in the mitral valve, and are called strut cords (Figure 3.23). There is a third type of cord that extends from the ventricular wall close to the atrioventricular junction, and again inserts into the ventricular aspect of the leaflet. These are the basal cords

![](_page_12_Picture_2.jpeg)

Fig. 3.21 This surgical view of a rheumatic mitral valve, taken through a left atriotomy, shows a fan-shaped cord arising from the tip of its papillary muscle. This is the type of cord traditionally considered to represent a 'commissural' cord.

Fig. 3.22 This anatomical specimen, viewed from the inlet aspect, shows the aortic leaflet of the mitral valve, with tendinous cords supporting the entirety of the free edge of the valve.

(Figure 3.24). There is little point in characterising the pattern of branching and the generations of these cords further, as long as it is appreciated that, normally, all parts of the leaflets receive good cordal support. Lack of uniform cordal support is very likely a mechanism leading to prolapse of a leaflet13,14 .

The different components of the atrioventricular valve making up the overall valve complex (Figure 3.1) must function in concert so as to produce a competent

valvar mechanism. The reason that the atrioventricular valves have such a complex tension apparatus is that, while in their closed position, they must withstand the full brunt of systolic ventricular pressure. A lesion of any of the valvar components

Fig. 3.23 Some cords to the rough zone of the ventricular aspect of the aortic leaflet of the mitral valve are particularly prominent, as shown in this illustration, and are defined as strut cords.

can result in regurgitation. Thus, it is essential that the atrioventricular junction be of normal size and not overly dilated. The leaflets must coapt snugly. This

demands an area of overlap. Often, particularly in aged valves, this point of closure is marked by a series of nodules. The point of closure away from the free

edge gives a margin of safety for dilation of the valvar orifice. Equally significant to competent closure, however, is the support of the leaflet by cords attached to the free

edge. As discussed previously, this feature is highly significant to the mechanism of prolapse of the valve leaflets. It has been suggested<sup>15</sup> that prolapse of the leaflets of the mitral valve is one of the most common congenital lesions. As yet, there is no consensus as to the aetiology of such prolapse. Morphological observations<sup>11,12</sup> certainly suggest that lack of cordal support to the free edge of the leaflets can contribute to prolapse, along with lengthening of the persisting cords: uniform support of the free edges of the leaflets is an integral part of a normal valve. Also important in the maintenance of competence is the correct action of the papillary muscles and the ventricular myocardium. Not only must the papillary muscles be viable, but they must also be in their appropriate position of mechanical advantage relative to the axis of the valve. Taken together, all parts of the valvar unit are significant in the normal function of the valve<sup>1</sup>.

#### THE MITRAL VALVE

The mitral valve has two major leaflets, which are supported by paired papillary muscles. The two leaflets have widely dissimilar circumferential lengths

(Figure 3.25). The ends of the solitary zone of apposition between them, traditionally labelled as the commissures, together with the papillary muscles, are positioned in the inferoanterior position adjacent to the septum, and superoposteriorly arising from the posterior ventricular wall, although they are usually described incorrectly as being posteroseptal and anterolateral. The advent of computed tomographic imaging, which relates the location of the heart to the coordinates of the body, reveals the inappropriate nature of the current description (Figure 3.26). The tomographic images also clearly show the angle existing between the axis of opening of the valve and the plane of the inlet component of the muscular ventricular septum (Figure 3.26). The posterior extension of the subaortic outflow tract is wedged into this angle. As we will see, this arrangement is key to the disposition of the axis of atrioventricular conduction tissue (see Chapter 5). The two leaflets of the mitral valves themselves are frequently described as being 'anterior' and 'posterior'. Strictly speaking, they are anterosuperior and posteroinferior, again because of the oblique axis of opening of the valve relative to the anatomical axes of the body (Figure 3.26). We prefer to describe the leaflets as being aortic and

mural, this description accounting for both their morphology and their usual location within the body.

The aortic leaflet is attached to only one-third of the annular circumference. It is trapezoidal, or more semicircular, in shape than the mural leaflet (Figure 3.27). The mural leaflet, attached to two-thirds of the annulus, is a long, rectangular structure, although its middle component can also be somewhat semicircular. It is the segments of the mural leaflet adjacent to the ends of the zone of apposition with the aortic leaflet that show the most variation in morphology. Often these segments are almost completely separate from the central component, producing the so-called scallops of the mural leaflet. Carpentier 16 has coded these scallops in alphanumeric fashion, along with the facing segments of the aortic leaflet, and this convention has widespread surgical use (Figure 3.28). Yacoub<sup>9</sup> has gone so far as to nominate the scallops as separate leaflets of a quadrifoliate valve. Others<sup>10</sup> point out that the parts of the leaflet adjacent to the ends of the zone of apposition can also take a 'scallop-like' appearance (Figure 3.29). All these categorisations are artificial. Because of the marked variability that occurs normally in the valve, the mural leaflet can be comprised of four, five, or even more

![](_page_14_Picture_8.jpeg)

Fig. 3.25 The mitral valve is viewed from above in a closed position, as it might be seen by the surgeon. There is a solitary zone of apposition between its two major leaflets, with slits in the mural leaflet producing a number of potential subcomponents in the mural leaflet (stars). Note that the ends of the zone of apposition do not extend to the atrioventricular junction (bold red braces). (The original photograph of the mitral valve was kindly sent to us by Dr Van S. Galstyan, from Armenia, and we thank him for permitting us to use it in our book.)

The tomographic section clearly shows the angle between the line of the zone of apposition between the leaflets of the mitral valve and the plane of the inferior part of the muscular ventricular septum (white dotted lines). Note that, contrary to the usual descriptions, the papillary muscles are positioned inferoanteriorly and superoposteriorly when considered in attitudinally correct orientation (see orientation box).

components. It is better to recognise that there are a variable number of slits in the mural leaflet, and that these slits act as pleats so that the normal valve can close snugly17. In the setting of prolapse, nonetheless, individual components of the divided mural leaflet may be deformed in isolation, and must then be recognised as such.

The supporting cords attach the leaflets either to the papillary muscles, in the form of the cords to the free edge and rough zone, or directly to the wall of the ventricle, as with the basal cords. The cords at the ends of the zone of apposition attach adjacent sides of both the leaflets to the apex of each of the papillary muscles. Supplementary heads of both papillary

muscles then support other cords running to the free edge, which usually attach uniformly along the leading edge of the leaflets, although, as we have discussed, the degree of support can be quite variable. The cords supporting the divisions between the scallops of the mural leaflet also often have a fan-shaped appearance. When attached to a prominent

**Fig. 3.28** The classification of Carpentier<sup>16</sup> recognises three major scallops in the mural leaflet (P1 to P3), and also names the facing segments of the aortic leaflet in alphanumeric fashion (A1 to A3). This classification, however, ignores the potential subcomponents of the leaflet at the ends of the solitary zone of apposition (see Figure 3.29).

![](_page_16_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Fig. 3.29** Kumar and colleagues<sup>10</sup>, in their suggested classification, also took into account the components of the mural leaflet adjacent to the ends of the solitary zone of apposition between the two major leaflets (stars), giving six rather than four potential subcomponents for the entire valvar skirt (compare with Figure 3.28).

supplementary head of a papillary muscle, they can be markedly similar to the cords supporting the commissures. The cords to the rough zone run from the papillary muscles to the ventricular aspect of the leaflets. As already emphasised, several of these cords, running from each papillary muscle to the undersurface of the aortic leaflet, are particularly prominent, and are called strut cords (Figure 3.23). The basal cords attach to the ventricular aspect of the mural leaflet, running directly from miniature muscle heads on the parietal wall of the ventricle (Figure 3.24).

The papillary muscles of the mitral valve are almost always prominent paired

structures, located on the inferoanterior and superoposterior aspects of the parietal ventricular wall (Figure 3.26). Although there can be considerable variation in the precise morphology of either muscle<sup>13</sup>, neither arises from the septum, in contrast to the attachments of the tricuspid valve within the right ventricle. When the valve is dissected in its natural position within the left ventricle (Figure 3.30), the muscles are seen to be adjacent to each other at the junction of the apical and middle thirds of the parietal ventricular wall.

It is the area of the valvar orifice related to the right fibrous trigone and central fibrous body that is most vulnerable in terms of the conduction tissues. The atrioventricular node and the penetrating atrioventricular bundle are adjacent to these areas (Figures 3.31, 3.32). The area of the orifice between the two trigones, more or less the midportion of the aortic leaflet, is directly related to the commissure between the non-coronary and left coronary leaflets of the aortic valve. At this point, the aortic root is tented up, and an incision apparently through the atrial wall will extend into the subaortic outflow tract. If the incision is continued superiorly, it will pass into the transverse sinus of the pericardial cavity, which overlies the aortic-mitral curtain (Figure 3.13). The

deep inner curvature of the heart overlies and runs to either side of the curtain, and is lined by the transverse sinus. Encircling the mural leaflet of the valve are the circumflex coronary artery from below and to the left, and the coronary sinus from below and to the right (Figure 3.32). The atrioventricular nodal artery also runs in close proximity to the right side of the mitral orifice, particularly when arising from a dominant circumflex artery. Indeed, the extent of the margin directly related to the circumflex artery depends on coronary arterial disposition. When the left coronary artery is dominant, an arrangement found in one-tenth of the population, the entire attachment of the mural leaflet is intimately related to the coronary artery, including its branch supplying the atrioventricular (AV) node (Figure 3.33).

#### THE TRICUSPID VALVE

As judged on the basis of its pattern of closure<sup>8</sup>, the tricuspid valve has three major leaflets (Figures 3.34, 3.35). They are positioned septally, anterosuperiorly, and inferiorly (Figure 3.36), albeit that the

inferior, or mural, leaflet is usually described as being posterior. This is yet another example of the description of cardiac structures as seen in the autopsy or dissecting room, the heart having been removed, rather than using the bodily coordinates for reference. The septal leaflet is supported between the relatively inconstant inferior papillary muscle, and the much more constant medial papillary muscle. Also known as the muscle of Lancisi, or the papillary muscle of the conus, it arises from the posterior limb of the septomarginal trabeculation (Figure 3.37). The attachment of the septal leaflet crosses the membranous septum, dividing it into atrioventricular and interventricular components (Figure 3.38). The distal extent of the leaflet is attached by multiple cords running from the free edge directly to the septum (Figure 3.39). It is this feature that serves to distinguish the tendinous support of the tricuspid valve from that of the mitral valve, the mitral valvar leaflets lacking any septal attachments. In the area where the septal leaflet extends across the membranous septum, the leaflet may be

divided, resulting in a discrete cleft that extends towards the central fibrous body.

The anterosuperior leaflet descends from the underside of the ventriculoinfundibular fold, hanging like an extensive curtain between the inlet and outlet parts of the ventricle. Its medial and superior end is supported by cords from the medial papillary muscle (Figure 3.37). There is more variability in the arrangement of its lateral and inferior component. On occasion, its zone of apposition with the inferior leaflet is supported by the prominent anterior papillary muscle, which takes origin from the apical portion of the septomarginal trabeculation. More often, the anterior muscle supports the midportion of the anterosuperior leaflet. The leaflet is well supported by cords to its free edge, but also by rough-zone and strut cords, in a fashion comparable with that seen in the aortic leaflet of the mitral valve. When the anterior papillary muscle supports the midpoint of the anterosuperior leaflet, the muscle supporting its zone of apposition with the inferior leaflet is relatively indistinct. Frequently, there are extensions of

Note that the inferior interventricular artery, and the artery to the atrioventricular (AV) node, take their origin from the circumflex artery.

**Fig. 3.34** This picture, taken in the operating room, shows the arrangement of the three leaflets of the tricuspid valve, which are positioned septally, anterosuperiorly, and inferiorly or murally. The latter leaflet is usually described, incorrectly, as being positioned posteriorly.

muscle from either the papillary muscles or the ventriculoinfundibular fold directly into the anterosuperior leaflet. The third leaflet of the tricuspid valve is the inferior or mural one. It is less constant than the other two, as the inferior papillary muscle is often indistinct and variable. The leaflet is attached to the parietal part of the atrioventricular junction, being supported distally by several cords to the free edge, attached either to small heads of muscle, or directly into the

![](_page_20_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 3.35** The anatomical specimen has been photographed to replicate the arrangement as seen in the operating room, as shown in Figure 3.34, confirming that the leaflets are located septally, anterosuperiorly, and inferiorly. Note the relationship of the septal leaflet to the landmarks of the triangle of Koch (white dotted lines).

ventricular wall. There are usually also basal cords supporting the inferior leaflet (Figure 3.40).

The entire parietal attachments of the leaflets of the tricuspid valve are

encircled by the right coronary artery running in the atrioventricular groove (Figure 3.41). It is rare to find a well-formed collagenous tricuspid 'annulus'. Instead, the atrial and ventricular myocardial masses are separated almost exclusively by the adipose tissue within the groove, with the leaflets of the valve hinged from the endocardial surface of the ventricular wall (Figure 3.20).

# BASIC ARRANGEMENT OF THE ARTERIAL VALVES

The arterial valves, although much simpler structures than the atrioventricular valves, as they do not need an intricate arrangement of tension apparatus to ensure their competence, are still best analysed in terms of a valvar complex (Figure 3.3). Their design is simplicity itself. The three

semilunar leaflets open into the supporting arterial sinuses during ventricular systole, and then collapse together during diastole, being held in their closed position by the hydrostatic pressure of the column of blood

![](_page_22_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 3.39** This operative view through a right atriotomy shows the cordal attachments (arrows) to the septum of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve. The patient also has a defect in the oval fossa.

**Fig. 3.40** The inferior leaflet of the tricuspid valve has been reflected away from the ventricular wall to show the basal cords (arrows).

they support (Figure 3.42). In terms of histological structure, the leaflets have a fibrous core with an endothelial lining (Figure 3.43). The fibrous core is thickened at the free edge, particularly at the central portion short of the free edge where, with age, a distinct fibrous thickening, the nodule of Arantius, becomes evident. The leaflets of

the valve do not close at their free edge. The line of closure is some distance from the free edge, towards the semilunar attachment. Not infrequently, the leaflets may be perforated beyond the line of closure in this outer component. Such perforations are a normal finding, and do not affect valvar function. It is the hinge line of the individual leaflets that

is of half-moon, or semilunar, shape (Figures 3.4, 3.5). When the three semilunar hinges are considered in terms of their overall structure, the seating of the leaflets takes the form of a coronet (Figure 3.44). The attachments of the leaflets at the apex of their zones of apposition are significantly higher than the attachments at their

![](_page_23_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 3.41** This view of the heart, also shown in Figure 3.66, with a dominant right coronary artery, photographed in anatomical orientation from above and behind, shows the intimate relationship of the artery to the orifice of the tricuspid valve.

Fig. 3.42 This image of the closed aortic valve from above shows the three valvar leaflets coapting snugly, held together by the diastolic pressure of the column of blood they support. The stars mark the commissures, which are the peripheral attachments of the zones of apposition to the sinutubular junction.

midportion. In light of these arrangements, it is less than ideal to describe the hinges of the valvar leaflets in terms of the annulus, albeit that many surgeons still consider this to be an appropriate term<sup>3</sup>. There are two

true rings within the extent of the arterial root, but paradoxically neither has attracted attention from surgeons for description as the valvar annulus. Perhaps the most obvious is the sinutubular junction, this being the plane of attachment of the valvar commissures (Figure 3.45). The most obvious ring anatomically is the locus over which the fibrous walls of the arterial trunks are attached to the supporting ventricular

![](_page_24_Picture_2.jpeg)

![](_page_25_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 3.45** The cartoon shows the relationship of the semilunar hinges of the aortic valvar leaflets (yellow) relative to the rings within the root. The superiorly located green ring is the sinutubular junction. The blue ring shows the ventriculoarterial junction, while the red ring is a virtual structure, formed by joining together the proximal attachments of the valvar hinges.

![](_page_25_Picture_4.jpeg)

Fig. 3.46 The cartoon shows the plane of space measured by echocardiographers as representing the arterial valvar annulus. It is the virtual plane constructed by joining together the nadirs of the hinges of the leaflets (blue double-headed arrow). It is a virtual anatomical ring, however, rather than a true anatomical entity. The anatomical rings in the arterial roots are formed by the sinutubular junction (red double-headed arrow), and the anatomical ventriculoarterial junction (plane indicated by dotted line). Note that the widest part of the root is at the midsinusal level (green double-headed arrow).

structures, thus constituting the anatomical ventriculoarterial junction, and best seen in the right ventricular outflow tract with the valvar leaflets having been removed (Figure 3.4). There is a marked discrepancy between this ring-like anatomical junction and the

haemodynamic junction, the latter being marked by the semilunar attachment of the leaflets. By virtue of this arrangement, part of the arterial wall, haemodynamically, is a ventricular structure. Part of the ventricle at the base of each sinus is, in contrast, within the arterial trunk (Figure 3.46). Thus, despite the simple nature of the valvar structure, the overall arterial roots are complex structures. The sinuses themselves are arranged in clover-like fashion, permitting the valvar leaflets to close in the fashion of a Mercedes-Benz sign (Figure 3.42). It is the nadirs of attachment of the valvar leaflets, however, that are taken as the point of measurement of the echocardiographic valvar annulus (Figure 3.46). This plane, therefore, does not correspond to any anatomical structure, albeit that consensus among surgeons is now moving towards accepting it as representing the valvar annulus<sup>3</sup>. In

reality, it is no more than the diameter of the entrance to the arterial roots.

### **THE AORTIC VALVE**

The semilunar leaflets of the aortic valve are attached in part to the area of fibrous continuity with the aortic leaflet of the mitral valve, and in part to the muscular outlet portion of the left ventricle (Figure 3.47). When naming the leaflets of the valve, advantage can be taken of the fact that, almost without exception, the major coronary arteries take origin from two of the aortic sinuses, but not the third. Thus, the aortic leaflets can accurately be described as being right coronary, left coronary, and non-coronary (Figure 3.48).

![](_page_26_Picture_7.jpeg)

**Fig. 3.47** The aortic root has been displayed by removing the leaflets of the aortic valve, the outflow tract between the left coronary and the non-adjacent aortic leaflets having been opened. The two sinuses giving rise to the coronary arteries have septal musculature at their bases (inner red arrows), while part of the left coronary sinus, along with the non-coronary sinus, is supported by a fibrous continuity with the aortic leaflet of the mitral valve (outer red arrows).

![](_page_26_Picture_9.jpeg)

**Fig. 3.48** The heart has been photographed from above, the tubular aorta having been removed to reveal the valvar sinuses. The origins of the coronary arteries permit two sinuses to be named as right and left coronary aortic sinuses. The third sinus is non-adjacent relative to the pulmonary trunk. In almost all instances, it does not give rise to a coronary artery. In those circumstances, it can also be called the non-coronary sinus.

![](_page_27_Picture_2.jpeg)

Fig. 3.49 The image is an enlargement of the heart shown in Figure 3.47. It shows how the bases of the sinuses supporting the coronary aortic leaflets are made up of the musculature of the ventricular septum (dotted black lines), because the semilunar hinges extend apically beyond the anatomical ventriculoarterial junction. The red triangle enclosing a white cross-hatched area shows the region of aortic wall that forms the distal extent of the outflow tract between the coronary aortic leaflets, running to the level of the sinutubular junction.

However, because the so-called noncoronary sinus can rarely give rise to one of the coronary arteries, it can more accurately be described as the non-adjacent sinus. It is the right and left coronary aortic leaflets that have a predominantly muscular origin from the left ventricular wall, the base of the myocardium being incorporated within the supporting aortic sinus (Figure 3.49). These are the leaflets that are adjacent to the pulmonary trunk. Their more distal adjacent parts take origin from the free aortic wall, with the small interleaflet fibrous triangle between them separating the cavity of the outflow tract from the tissue plane between the aortic root and the subpulmonary infundibulum (Figures 3.15, 3.50).

As the attachment of the right coronary leaflet is traced from its zone of apposition with the left coronary leaflet, it drops towards the crest of the muscular part of the septum in the area of the membranous septum. It then rises again to the apex of the zone of apposition with the non-adjacent leaflet (Figure 3.51). The attachment of this posterior part of the right coronary leaflet is an integral part of the fibrous skeleton. All of the non-adjacent leaflet has a fibrous origin, and is

incorporated in the fibrous skeleton. Half of it, extending from the zone of apposition with the right coronary leaflet, is attached to the area of the membranous septum (Figure 3.51). The triangle between these leaflets has important relationships to both right atrium and right ventricle (Figure 3.52). The extensive posterior extension, or diverticulum, of the left ventricular outflow tract lies beneath the non-adjacent leaflet, limited anterolaterally by the atrioventricular component of the membranous septum. Reaching its nadir at the attachment to the right fibrous trigone, the non-adjacent leaflet then rises to the apex of its zone of apposition with the left coronary leaflet. The adjacent parts of both leaflets in this area are attached to the free aortic wall distally, and proximally are continuous with the aortic leaflet of the mitral valve. In this way, they form the aortic-mitral curtain, which separates the left ventricular outflow tract not from the left atrium, but from the transverse sinus of the pericardium (Figure 3.53). Beyond this area, the left coronary leaflet adjoins a short segment of parietal myocardium before extending anteriorly to reach the zone of apposition with the right coronary leaflet. The precise attachments of the aortic

leaflets vary from heart to heart, particularly with regard to that portion of the zone of apposition between the non-coronary and left coronary leaflets that is related to the aortic-mitral curtain. The length of the subaortic fibrous curtain also varies from heart to heart. In a small percentage of normal hearts, the aortic valve in this area is supported by a complete muscular infundibulum or sleeve<sup>18</sup>. These individual variations do not distort the basic anatomical relationships as described earlier.

Appreciation of the anatomy of the valvar hinges brings into focus the important surgical danger areas related to the aortic valve. The ascending part of the non-coronary aortic leaflet is positioned directly above the part of the atrial wall containing the atrioventricular node, while the zone of apposition with the right coronary aortic leaflet is above the penetrating atrioventricular bundle and the membranous septum (Figures 3.54, 3.55). The zone of apposition between the right coronary and left coronary leaflets is usually positioned opposite the corresponding zone of apposition between the facing leaflets of the pulmonary valve. The adjacent parts of the two aortic

coronary leaflets, therefore, are directly related to the infundibulum of the right ventricle, albeit that a discrete extracardiac tissue plane interposes between them (Fig. 3.50). Incisions through the right

ventricular outflow tract at this site lead directly into the subaortic region (Figure 3.56). This is the basis of the right ventricular approach for relief of subaortic obstruction, as in the Konno, or modified Konno, procedure. Beyond this point, the lateral part of the left coronary leaflet is the only part of the aortic valve that is not intimately related to another cardiac chamber. This is the part of the

valve that takes origin from the lateral margin of the inner heart curvature. It is in relationship externally with the free pericardial space.

#### THE PULMONARY VALVE

The pulmonary valve in the normal heart has exclusively muscular attachments to

the infundibulum of the right ventricle (Figure 3.57). Because of its oblique position, there is difficulty in naming the pulmonary leaflets according to the body

**Fig. 3.55** The cartoon shows the relationships of the atrioventricular node and penetrating bundle as they would be seen by the surgeon working through the aortic valve.

coordinates. It is better to describe them according to their relationship to the aortic valve (Figure 3.58). The two leaflets of the aortic valve that are attached to the septum are always adjacent to two leaflets of the pulmonary valve. These two leaflets of the pulmonary valve, therefore, can simply be called the right and left adjacent leaflets. The third leaflet is then described,

appropriately, as the non-adjacent leaflet. When looked at from the stance of the observer positioned within the non-adjacent sinus, the two adjacent sinuses are to his or her right- and left-hand sides<sup>19</sup>. The right-hand leaflet as seen from the pulmonary trunk, however, is positioned leftwards and posteriorly in space, while the left-hand leaflet is adjacent to the right

coronary artery. Our preference, therefore, is to account for their anatomical location. The zone of apposition between the two adjacent leaflets has traditionally been considered to be attached to the muscular outlet septum immediately above the anterior limb of the septomarginal trabeculation. In reality, it is attached to a free-standing sleeve of infundibular

![](_page_31_Picture_2.jpeg)

Fig. 3.56 The cartoon shows how, in the Konno operation, an incision through the posterior wall of the subpulmonary infundibulum takes the surgeon into the subaortic outflow tract, the incision in the infundibular wall being carried into the muscular ventricular septum, and entering the left ventricular outflow tract between the two aortic sinuses giving origin to the coronary arteries. The two stars show how the wall has been folded open.

Fig. 3.57 This heart, shown in anatomical orientation, is opened along the parietal wall of the right ventricle. It shows how all leaflets of the pulmonary valve are supported by infundibular musculature.

musculature (Figure 3.50). As the right adjacent leaflet drops down from the apex of its zone of apposition with the other adjacent leaflet, it is supported by the inner heart curve, which separates it from the tricuspid valve. This muscular mass is the supraventricular crest of the right ventricle. The particular part separating

the hinges of the atrioventricular and arterial valves is the ventriculoinfundibular fold. The zone of apposition between the right and non-adjacent leaflets is thus towards the parietal extent of this fold, with the non-adjacent leaflet being supported by the anterior parietal wall of the infundibulum. The zone of apposition

between the non-adjacent and left adjacent leaflets extends from the parietal attachment back towards the septum, so that the left adjacent leaflet runs from the parietal wall to the area of the septum. When considered as a whole, the valve can be liberated from the right ventricle, together with its infundibular sleeve

Fig. 3.58 The image shows the components of the developing aortic and pulmonary roots, as seen in the mouse at 12.5 days of embryonic life. The cushions will excavate so as to give rise to the valvar leaflets and their supporting sinuses. The components retain their relationships, so that two of the sinuses of the pulmonary valve are always adjacent to the sinuses of the aortic valve that, eventually, will give rise to the coronary arteries. The other sinus is non-adjacent. This provides a logical means of describing the valvar sinuses and leaflets, as shown by the labels in this figure.

(Figure 3.59) without damaging any vital structures, although the left adjacent leaflet is closely related to the first septal perforating artery (Figure 3.60). Preservation of this artery is one of the features that underscores the success of the Ross procedure<sup>20</sup> .

## RELATIONSHIPS OF THE VALVES TO OTHER VITAL CARDIAC STRUCTURES

Positioned as they are within the ventricular base, the tricuspid, mitral, and aortic valves are intimately related to two

vital cardiac subsystems, namely the atrioventricular conduction system and the coronary circulation. It is mandatory to avoid damage to these structures during surgery, so it is important to know their precise locations. This must be learned relative to landmarks within the valves

themselves, as the conduction tissues are largely invisible, while the course of the coronary vessels is likely to be hidden as the surgeon approaches the valves. Although we have mentioned these landmarks when discussing the individual valves, their importance is such that they justify a collective review.

# THE SPECIALISED MUSCULAR AXIS FOR ATRIOVENTRICULAR CONDUCTION

In the normal heart, the penetrating atrioventricular bundle is the only muscular communication between the atrial and ventricular muscle masses. The bundle penetrates the membranous septal component of the central fibrous body. It is, therefore, intimately related to the leaflets of the mitral, tricuspid, and aortic valves. The axis takes its origin from the atrioventricular node and its atrial zones of transitional cells. These atrial components of the conduction axis are contained

exclusively within the triangle of Koch. The inferior extent of the triangle is the junctional attachment of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve. As the axis penetrates the septum, it immediately enters the subaortic region of the left ventricle (Figure 3.61). The point of penetration is related to the anteroinferior end of the zone of apposition between the leaflets of the mitral valve. In this area, the atrioventricular node lies within five to 10 millimetres of the atrial attachment of the medial scallop of the mural leaflet (Figure 3.32). Having reached the left ventricular outflow tract, the conduction axis begins to branch, either on the crest of the muscular ventricular septum, sandwiched between it and the interventricular membranous septum (Figure 3.52), or on the left ventricular aspect of the septum. This area is immediately beneath the zone of apposition between the non-adjacent and right coronary leaflets of the aortic valve (Figure 3.54), but the height of the

interleaflet fibrous triangle separates the valvar attachments from the conduction axis. When seen from the left ventricle, the left bundle branch fans out as a continuous sheet on the smooth left septal surface beneath the zone of apposition, splitting into its three divisions as it approaches the ventricular apex. The right bundle branch takes origin from the axis beyond the takeoff of the left bundle branches. It courses back across the septum as a thin, insulated cord, which emerges on the right ventricular aspect in the area of the medial papillary muscle. It then runs, usually intramyocardially, within the structure of the septomarginal trabeculation, to ramify at the ventricular apex. When considered from the right side, the site of the branching segment of the conduction axis can be imagined as a line joining the apex of the triangle of Koch to the medial papillary muscle (Figure 3.62). Care must be taken when placing sutures in this area, because the overall axis is within five millimetres of the right ventricular septal surface.

![](_page_34_Picture_2.jpeg)

Fig. 3.61 This dissection is through the membranous septum (white dotted line). The atrioventricular conduction axis penetrates this septum to reach the crest of the muscular ventricular septum. As can be seen, the point of penetration is directly adjacent to the right end of the area of continuity with the mitral valve, which is thickened to form the right fibrous trigone (white dotted area).

The red line shows the course of the atrioventricular conduction axis as it penetrates from the atrioventricular node (star) to reach the left ventricular outflow tract. The right bundle branch re-emerges on the right side beneath the medial papillary muscle.

# THE VULNERABLE CORONARY CIRCULATION

On the venous side of the circulation, the coronary sinus is the only noteworthy structure related to the valves. The great

cardiac vein runs within the left atrioventricular groove, receiving the oblique vein as it turns into the inferior part of the groove (Figures 3.63, 3.64). This confluence marks the beginning of the coronary sinus, which proceeds in the fatty tissue of the inferior atrioventricular groove to empty into the right atrium (Figure 3.65). In its course in an adult, it may approach to within five to 15 millimetres of the medial attachment of the mural leaflet of the mitral valve. Deeply

Fig. 3.63 This cast shows the location of the great cardiac vein in the left atrioventricular groove (white dotted line). The vein does not become the coronary sinus until it receives the oblique vein of the left atrium.

Fig. 3.64 The heart has been removed from the body, and the diaphragmatic surface is photographed to show the course of the coronary sinus within the inferior left atrioventricular groove. The great cardiac vein becomes the coronary sinus at the point where it receives the oblique vein of the left atrium.

placed sutures in this area during replacement of the mitral valve may lead to damage to the coronary sinus. This can cause extremely troublesome bleeding. In addition, when removing a previously

placed mitral valvar prosthesis, care must be taken not to enter the sinus with scalpel or suture. The normal anatomy may well have been distorted by the earlier operation.

The coronary arteries are intimately related to both the mitral and tricuspid valves, as much of their course is within the atrioventricular grooves. The main stem of the left coronary artery branches in the

**Fig. 3.66** The heart in this image, also shown in Figure 3.41, has a dominant right coronary artery, which gives rise to the inferior interventricular artery, and the artery to the atrioventricular node. As can be seen, the circumflex artery is only marginally related to the mural leaflet of the mitral valve in this setting.

angle of the margin of the left-sided ventriculoinfundibular fold immediately above the left fibrous trigone. The anterior interventricular artery moves away from the valves, although its septal perforating branches extend into the septum immediately beneath the left-facing leaflet of the pulmonary valve. This important artery could be damaged by extensive dissection in this area. It is the circumflex branch of the left coronary artery that is most intimately related to the mitral valve, particularly when the left coronary artery is dominant. When the right coronary artery is dominant, that is, gives rise to the inferior interventricular artery, as it does in about 90% of cases, the circumflex artery (a.) is related only to the area around the lateral scallop of the mural leaflet of the mitral valve (Figure 3.66). When the circumflex branch becomes the inferior

interventricular artery, its entire course is intimately related to the entirety of the mural leaflet (Figure 3.33).

The right coronary artery always runs a circumferential course around the mural attachments of the tricuspid valve. The initial course of the artery is through the right atrioventricular groove (Figure 3.41), where it lies on the epicardial aspect of the ventriculoinfundibular fold. It can be damaged by deeply placed sutures in this area<sup>21</sup>. The artery encircles the attachment of the mural leaflet of the tricuspid valve before, in the majority of cases, turning to become the inferior interventricular artery. Just prior to its descent, the right coronary artery, when dominant, takes a prominent U-loop beneath the floor of the coronary sinus, giving off the artery to the atrioventricular node at the apex of the loop. In cases where the circumflex artery gives rise to the inferior interventricular artery, the atrioventricular nodal artery originates from the circumflex artery (Figure 3.33). Whether arising from a dominant left or right coronary artery, this small but important vessel is related to the inferior aspect of the annular attachment of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve.
