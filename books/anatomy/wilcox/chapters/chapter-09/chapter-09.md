## ANOMALOUS SYSTEMIC VENOUS DRAINAGE

Abnormal systemic venous connections are usually of little surgical significance, as their clinical consequences are limited. The anomalies are apt to be encountered as the surgeon pursues a more complex associated intracardiac anomaly. They are of most significance in the setting of isomeric atrial appendages, which we discuss in Chapter 10, showing how socalled visceral heterotaxy is best considered in terms of right versus left isomerism. In this chapter, we consider the features of the anomalous systemic venous connections in their own right. They may be grouped into the categories of absence or abnormal drainage of the right superior caval vein, anomalies of the inferior caval vein, persistence or abnormal drainage of the left superior caval vein, and abnormal hepatic venous connections. Abnormalities of the coronary sinus usually fall into one of these groups, although unroofing, which produces an interatrial communication through the right atrial orifice of the sinus, has been discussed in Chapter 7.

## Abnormalities of the right superior caval vein

These are extremely rare. The vein may be diminished in size. Alternatively, it may be completely absent when the venous return from the head, neck, and arms passes through a persistent left superior caval vein to the right atrium by way of the coronary sinus (Figure 9.1) or, rarely, directly into the left atrium. Only this last situation requires surgical intervention. The other conditions, if encountered during an open-heart operation, would require some adjustment from the usual technique used for cannulation. Although there is no definite evidence to this effect, we would not expect these abnormalities to affect the location of the sinus node.

## Abnormalities of the inferior caval vein

The inferior caval vein has been described to connect directly to the morphologically left atrium<sup>1</sup>, producing right-to-left shunting, although we have never seen such a lesion. When the inferior caval vein does drain to the left atrium, this is usually because a persistent Eustachian valve directs flow from the right atrium through the oval fossa

(Figure 9.2). Such right-to-left shunting can also be an iatrogenic phenomenon. occasionally observed when low-lying atrial septal defects are improperly closed (see Chapter 7). The more frequent anomaly involving the inferior caval vein is interruption of its terminal segment, with return of the venous blood from the lower body through the azygos or hemiazygos venous systems (Figure 9.3)<sup>2</sup>. The malformation is seen most frequently with isomerism of the left atrial appendages<sup>3</sup>. The hepatic veins usually drain independently into the right-sided or left-sided atrium, although there can be a confluent suprahepatic channel, as is usually the case when interruption and azvgos continuation is found with usual or mirror-imaged atrial chambers (Figure 9.4).

## Persistence of the left superior caval vein

Persistence of the left superior caval vein is the most common malformation involving the caval veins (Figure 9.1). In about three-fifths of reported cases<sup>4</sup>, the persisting left vein is joined to the right superior caval vein by a brachiocephalic vein. When arranged in this fashion, the left caval vein

**Fig. 9.2** The cartoon shows the most frequent mechanism by which the venous return through the inferior caval vein drains to the left atrium. It is deflected across a defect within the oval fossa (red arrow) due to persistence of the Eustachian valve.

can simply be clamped or ligated, so as to avoid flooding the field when the heart is opened. If connections with the right vein are not apparent, a trial period of occlusion will usually indicate whether venous hypertension will give problems. A left superior caval vein is found not infrequently in patients with cyanotic heart disease, being reported in up to one-fifth of patients with tetralogy of Fallot, and one-twelfth of patients with Eisenmenger's syndrome<sup>5</sup>. The venous channel can be the route of partially or totally anomalous pulmonary venous connection. It can also empty directly into the left atrium, as in the constellation described as unroofing of the coronary sinus (see Chapter 7). Much more frequently, the vein persists as an isolated venous channel, which usually receives the hemiazygos vein before penetrating the pericardium and passing between the left atrial appendage and the left pulmonary veins (Figure 9.5). It then

connects with the coronary sinus, traversing the inferior left atrioventricular groove to empty into the right atrium through a larger than normal orifice (Figure 9.6). In such hearts, the Thebesian valve is often attenuated or absent. There are also reports of the persistent vein obstructing flow from the pulmonary veins towards the atrial vestibule<sup>6</sup>. It is certainly the case that the venous channel could bulge into the cavity of the left atrium.

#### Levoatrial cardinal vein

Another anomaly that, although rare, warrants consideration is the levoatrial cardinal vein<sup>7,8</sup>. This channel connects the left atrium to the systemic venous system. It is found with associated lesions such as mitral atresia, where it functions as the only route for pulmonary venous return (Figures 9.7, 9.8). In this case, although the pulmonary

veins are normally connected to the morphologically left atrium, the pattern of venous return is comparable to the 'snowman' types of anomalous pulmonary venous connection (see later). A variant of the levoatrial cardinal vein is found when there is atresia of the right atrial orifice of the coronary sinus (Figure 9.9). A vertical vein can drain the coronary venous blood to the brachiocephalic vein and thence to the right atrium via the superior caval vein (Figure 9.10).

## ANOMALOUS PULMONARY VENOUS CONNECTION

Very rarely, the pulmonary veins may be obstructed or totally atretic at their atrial junction<sup>9</sup>. This is unlikely to be a surgically remedial situation. Much more commonly, the pulmonary venous system, either totally or in part, has an anomalous

It enters the right atrium through the enlarged coronary sinus (see Figure 9.6.) Note that, as it passes through the left atrioventricular groove, it potentially obstructs pulmonary venous flow to the mitral valvar vestibule.

**Fig. 9.7** This specimen, from a patient with hypoplasia of the left heart, photographed in anatomical orientation, shows the course of the so-called levoatrial cardinal vein.

Thus, there are normal venous connections, but anomalous drainage (arrows).

connection. There is a plethora of possibilities for abnormal pulmonary venous connections<sup>10</sup>. The arrangements should be described as specifically and as unambiguously as possible (Figure 9.11). The pulmonary veins connect anomalously when they are not joined to the

morphologically left atrium. Consequently, if all the veins from one lung connect to a site other than the left atrium, the arrangement can be described as a unilateral totally anomalous pulmonary venous connection. If all the veins from both lungs connect to sites other than the

morphologically left atrium, there is a totally anomalous pulmonary venous connection. This, of necessity, implies a bilateral totally anomalous connection.

Any combination can readily be described by treating each lung as an entity. The unifying feature in all of these

This situation is analogous to the levoatrial cardinal vein providing pulmonary venous egress in the setting of an obstructed left atrium.

combinations is the connection of one or more pulmonary veins to the systemic venous system or to the right atrium. It is equally important, therefore, that the site of drainage be identified. Historically, this has been described as supradiaphragmatic or infradiaphragmatic (Figure 9.12). Supradiaphragmatic drainage can further

be subdivided into supracardiac and cardiac patterns. Supracardiac connection may be to a right or left superior caval vein, the brachiocephalic or innominate vein, or

Fig. 9.11 This cartoon, in anatomical orientation, shows how an anomalous connection of the pulmonary veins can be well accounted for by describing the connection of the veins from each lung as separate entities, and then describing partially as opposed to totally anomalous drainage on each side. The site of drainage needs to be specified separately (see Figure 9.12).

Fig. 9.12 This cartoon, in anatomical orientation, shows the potential sites for an anomalous connection of the pulmonary veins. LSCV, left superior caval vein.

even the azygos vein. Connection to the brachiocephalic vein is most frequent. The combination of drainage via a left-sided vertical vein, and thence via the brachiocephalic vein to the superior caval vein (Figures 9.13, 9.14), produces the typical 'snowman' configuration as seen on chest radiography. The drainage can be

obstructed when the vertical vein crosses in front of the left bronchus, but obstruction is more usually produced when the venous channel is caught in a vice between the left pulmonary artery and the left bronchus (Figure 9.15). When the route of drainage involves the azygos vein, the left pulmonary veins tend to cross vertically

beneath the heart, ascending in the right paravertebral gutter and receiving the right pulmonary veins, before draining to the superior caval vein via the azygos vein (Figure 9.16). More bizarre patterns of drainage can occur when the right-sided veins cross to the left, join with the left-sided veins, and make their connection

to the azygos vein adjacent to the diaphragm<sup>11</sup>.

Drainage directly to the right atrium is typically through the coronary sinus (Figure 9.17). In our experience, a totally anomalous connection to the right atrium other than through the coronary sinus has

been seen only in the setting of isomerism of the right atrial appendages (Figure 9.18). The pulmonary veins, even when they return to the heart, are always connected in anatomically anomalous fashion when both of the atrial appendages are of right morphology. An infradiaphragmatic connection is usually total except when there is a partially right-sided connection to the inferior caval vein. This latter arrangement is the so-called scimitar syndrome, a name taken from its likeness to a Turkish sword when seen in the chest radiograph<sup>12</sup>. In the usual infradiaphragmatic connection, the

common channel connecting both lungs lies outside the pericardium posterior to the left atrium (Figure 9.19). A vertical vein drains through the diaphragm as a single channel to enter the portal vein or the venous duct (Figures 9.20, 9.21). The return from the lungs becomes obstructed

subsequent to closure of the venous duct. Occasionally, the channel breaks up into a series of branches that connect to the gastric veins (Figure 9.22). It is very rare to find an infradiaphragmatic connection directly to the inferior caval vein. The totally anomalous pulmonary venous

connection can also drain to a mixed site. In the image shown in Figure 9.23, the upper pulmonary veins drain in supracardiac fashion to the superior caval vein, while the inferior pulmonary veins drain to the coronary sinus. Any combination should be anticipated.

The salient anatomical features relating to surgical repair of anomalous pulmonary connections include the type of abnormal connection, the site of the anomalous connection, and the proximity of the anomalous veins to the left atrium. As pointed out in Chapter 7, an interatrial communication in the

mouth of the superior caval vein, the so-called sinus venosus defect, is always accompanied by an anomalous connection of the right pulmonary

veins to the superior caval vein. The need to safeguard the sinus node and its blood supply has already been emphasised.

Other sites of connection, or potential sites of anastomosis, often require construction of an extensive atrial junction to guard postoperatively against pulmonary venous obstruction. The appropriate landmarks must be borne in mind. Two types of anomalous connection pose particular problems. The first is when the

![](_page_12_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 9.23** The reconstructed dataset prepared from a computed tomographic angiogram shows mixed totally anomalous pulmonary venous drainage as viewed from behind. The left superior pulmonary vein drains to the brachiocephalic vein, and thence to the superior caval vein, while the left inferior and the right pulmonary veins drain to the coronary sinus.

anomalous venous return is by way of the coronary sinus (Figures 9.17, 9.23). We initially thought that the myocardium between the coronary sinus and the left atrium was common to both structures. We now know that the sinus has its own myocardial wall, separate from that of the left atrium<sup>13</sup>. It is possible, nonetheless, to incise both walls so as to unroof the sinus. At the same time, the orifice of the coronary sinus can be made confluent with the atrial septal defect, which is typically within the oval fossa. It is important to remove enough of the walls to ensure that the patch placed across the orifice of the coronary sinus and oval fossa does not produce obstruction at the site of the incised sinus septum. Ideally, the incised walls of the atrium and coronary sinus should also be repaired, because the incisions create a route to the inferior atrioventricular groove. Thus far, however, we are unaware of any reports of tamponade following such procedures. The surgeon should be aware, nonetheless, that a potential opening is created to the extracardiac spaces. When incising the coronary sinus, it is also important to avoid the atrioventricular node at the apex of the triangle of Koch.

The second problematic type of connection is the infradiaphragmatic variant. The extrapericardial common

pulmonary venous trunk is further from the posterior left atrial wall than might be expected (Figure 9.19). Because of this, the anastomosis constructed between the trunk and left atrium is vulnerable to obstruction, particularly at its lateral extreme. This may become evident only when bypass is discontinued and the heart fills with blood.

#### **ANOMALIES OF THE AORTA**

The congenital anomalies of the thoracic aorta that are of interest to the surgeon include coarctation, the spectrum of partial to complete interruption of the aorta, and vascular rings and slings.

#### Aortic coarctation

Coarctation is a congenitally derived discrete shelf-like (Figure 9.24) or waist-like (Figure 9.25) lesion within the aorta, which causes obstruction to the flow of blood. It is most often found adjacent to the opening of the persistently patent arterial duct (Figure 9.26), or the arterial ligament if the duct has closed, but can occur proximally or more distally, and even in the abdominal aorta. It is usually accompanied by some degree of tubular hypoplasia of the

aorta, but is anatomically independent of the hypoplasia. It can coexist with other lesions that diminish left-sided flow, but coarctation can, and does, occur independently. Tubular hypoplasia, when involving the isthmic segment of the aortic arch, can then be considered as part of a spectrum leading to atresia or interruption of the aortic arch.

Much has been made of the role of ductal tissue in the aetiology of coarctation. Although there was a time when some doubted its significance, the evidence supporting its inclusion in the coarctation shelf (Figure 9.24) is now unequivocal. The surgeon, therefore, needs to be aware of the importance of removing all the ductal tissue during repair. The significance of the duct itself devolves upon its patency. If the duct is patent, typically there is an associated congenital anomaly that promotes increased flow of blood through the pulmonary trunk, and diverts blood away from the proximal aorta. In these circumstances, the associated anomaly tends to dominate the picture, and will determine the most appropriate surgical therapy. On the other hand, coarctation with a closed duct is very likely to be an isolated lesion (Figure 9.25), except for the occasional association with a bifoliate aortic valve<sup>17</sup>.

![](_page_13_Picture_2.jpeg)

Fig. 9.24 This specimen, viewed in anatomical orientation, shows the ductal tissue that forms the shelf lesion of aortic coarctation. Note the coexisting hypoplasia of the aortic isthmus.

Ant. Post. Fig. 9.25 The reconstructed dataset prepared from a computed tomographic angiogram shows a waist-like constriction (arrows) between the aortic isthmus and the descending aorta. In this patient, the arterial duct has closed.

The chief concerns of the surgeon relate to the specific anatomy of the coarctation. The nature of the collateral circulation is of particular significance. With welldeveloped collateral arteries (Figure 9.27), there is little danger of cross-clamping the

aorta during repair. If the collateral arteries are less well developed (Figure 9.28), however, clamping the aorta may have several deleterious consequences. These include strain on the left ventricle due to proximal hypertension, which may also

induce a cerebrovascular accident secondary to rupture of a berry aneurysm. There may be distal aortic hypotension, at pressures of less than 50 mmHg, which endangers the splanchnic and spinal vascular beds. Irrespective of the nature

of the collateral arteries, the spinal circulation is best preserved by interrupting none, or as few as possible, of the intercostal vessels. Temporary occlusion of the intercostal vessels adjacent to the operative field seems to be a reasonable compromise in this difficult situation. Other noteworthy features include the position of the thoracic duct (Figure 9.29), and the occasional presence of an anomalous artery (Figure 9.30), sometimes referred to

as Abbott's artery. When present, this artery arises from the posteromedial aspect of the proximal descending aorta. Whether it is an enlarged bronchial artery, or persistence of the evanescent fifth arch, as initially suggested by Hamilton and Abbott<sup>18</sup>, is irrelevant. What is important is that the surgeon is aware of the existence of this

anomalous vessel that, if not properly managed, can lead to substantial bleeding during the repair<sup>19</sup>.

### Interruption of the aortic arch

Discontinuity of the aorta, as opposed to coarctation, has been variously referred to

as absence, atresia, or interruption of the arch. Included in this group are those cases with a fibrous cord or bridge of tissue (Figure 9.31), as well as those with a gap, or absolute discontinuity, at some point in the arch (Figures 9.32, 9.33). Interruption can occur at one of three positions: at the isthmus, between the left subclavian and

left common carotid arteries, and between the left common carotid and brachiocephalic arteries (Figure 9.34). These lesions typically are found in the setting of a unilateral left aortic arch but,

rarely, a right arch can be affected similarly20. As patients with discontinuity of the aorta are unlikely to survive without surgical treatment, they are a particular challenge to the clinician. The associated

cardiovascular malformations are of critical importance, for they affect the operative outcome as much as does an interrupted arch itself. Almost always, there is a patent connection to the distal

resulting in subaortic stenosis (Figure 9.35). Any type of defect, nonetheless, can be found. Abnormal ventriculoarterial connections are not

unusual, and present their own particular problems for operative reconstruction<sup>21</sup>.

A less lethal but fairly frequently associated arterial abnormality is the aberrant origin of a retro-oesophageal right subclavian artery from the distal aorta (Figure 9.32). Because the arch is interrupted, symptoms of a vascular ring are unlikely, unless a ring is created while reconstructing the arch. Conversely, if the aberrant artery is brought forward, it can be useful in repairing the aorta. This

emphasises the importance of defining clearly the nature and effect of associated abnormalities. Successful anatomical correction is as dependent on appropriate management of these accompanying lesions as it is on establishing aortic continuity.

### Vascular rings

Aortic rings are malformations associated with abnormal regression of part of a double aortic arch. Knowledge of the

development of the aortic arches is a genuine aid to understanding the morphology of these anomalies. Initially, the arterial system is bilaterally symmetrical, with five sets of arches encircling the gut, and on occasion the remnants of a fifth set being evident for short periods (Figure 9.36). Of these, only the third, fourth, and sixth arches remain recognisable in the postnatal heart. Remnants of the third arch supply the head. The left fourth arch becomes part of

The arrows show the seventh segmental arteries, which will become the subclavian arteries. Initially they are distal to the insertion of the sixth aortic arch. Ao, aorta; PT, pulmonary trunk.

Fig. 9.37 This cartoon shows how the definitive system of aortic arches is derived from the embryological primordiums depicted in Figure 9.36.

the definite aortic arch. The left sixth arch becomes the arterial duct (Figure 9.37). The subclavian arteries, which are the seventh cervical intersegmental arteries, come to take origin from the fourth arch between the third and sixth arches when the heart migrates inferiorly22. Thus, normally during early development, most of the right-sided structures regress, leaving a left arch and a left-sided aorta (Figure 9.37). It is failure of this normal regression that leaves the double arch,

which then forms a ring around the trachea and the oesophagus. The so-called hypothetical double aortic arch<sup>23</sup> is a concept that explains malformations encircling the tracheo-oesophageal pedicle on the basis of incomplete regression. The hypothetical pattern comprises a midline anterior aorta, continued anteriorly on each side by the fourth arches to bilateral posterior aortic segments, which join to form a midline descending aorta. Common carotid and subclavian arteries arise from

each fourth arch in the hypothetical system, while an arterial duct connects each arch to its companion pulmonary artery (Figure 9.38). Persistent patency of the entire double arch obviously will cause problems (Figures 9.39, 9.40), while inappropriate interruption or atresia at any part of the ring can produce multiple variations of abnormal anatomy24. Such situations are illustrated in Figures 9.41 and 9.42, which show a left aortic arch with an aberrant right subclavian artery. Stewart

analysis rather than alphanumeric notation24. It should be noted that, as in the latter example of focal atresia, the atretic segment may not persist as a fibrous cord,

and may not necessarily cause compression of the trachea or oesophagus. In addition, the size of the component parts of the ring is at least as important in producing

symptoms as the particular anatomical arrangement. This accounts for the high incidence of symptoms associated with a double aortic arch. When only a fibrous cord is found, compression is not always apparent. Figures 9.43 and 9.44 show a duct taking origin from the left subclavian artery, which arises from a right arch. The considerable tracheo-oesophageal compression is not obvious until the duct is divided, and its ends are allowed to spring apart (Figure 9.45).

A right-sided aortic arch can exist aside from its association with vascular rings. The arch is right-sided when it crosses over the main stem of the right-sided bronchus. It may then connect to the descending aorta on either the right or left side of the vertebral column. Such a right-sided aortic arch is considered abnormal with the usual atrial arrangement, but is normal in patients with the mirror-imaged arrangement. In either case, it may or may not produce clinical problems. Its chief

In this instance, however, the left subclavian artery continues as the left-sided arterial duct, creating a vascular ring. The trachea, but not the oesophagus, is seen in the reconstruction. The potentially double arch is divided between the left subclavian and left common carotid (LCCA) arteries.

Fig. 9.44 This operative view, taken through a left thoracotomy, shows, as already seen in Figure 9.43, an arterial duct that arises from an aberrant left subclavian artery (LSCA), itself coursing in a retro-oesophageal position from a right aortic arch. The arrangement produces a vascular ring, as shown in Figure 9.43. The duct has been doubly ligated prior to its division. Note the size and location of the vagus nerve and its recurrent laryngeal branch.

surgical significance lies in its association with about one-quarter of cases of tetralogy of Fallot, and approximately half of all patients with common arterial trunks.

Patients with a right aortic arch usually have a mirror-imaged arrangement of the brachiocephalic arteries. This fact can be significant when contemplating

construction of a subclavian-to-pulmonary arterial shunt. With mirror-imaged branching, the first branch of the aorta beyond the coronary arteries is the

brachiocephalic trunk, which subsequently gives rise to the left subclavian and common carotid arteries. Under such circumstances, the surgeon may elect to perform a left-sided anastomosis so as to avoid kinking of the right subclavian artery as it is turned down into the mediastinum. The duct, however, usually remains a left-sided structure, connecting the brachiocephalic trunk to the left pulmonary artery. When arising from a retrooesophageal left subclavian artery, the presence of the left-sided duct will produce a vascular ring (Figures 9.42, 9.43, 9.46)<sup>24</sup>.

The hypothetical double arch, as proposed by Stewart and his colleagues<sup>23</sup>, also accounts for isolation of the brachiocephalic arteries. In these anomalies, which can involve either the brachiocephalic artery itself, or the common carotid or subclavian arteries, and which can be associated with either the usual left-sided aortic arch or a right aortic arch, the isolated artery arises from a pulmonary artery via a persistently patent arterial duct. In the example shown in Figure 9.47, there is persistence of both the right-sided and left-sided arterial ducts. The aortic arch is interrupted between the

left common carotid and left subclavian arteries, with the isolated right subclavian artery arising via a right-sided arterial duct from the right pulmonary artery.

## PULMONARY ARTERIAL ANOMALIES

By far the most common malformation of the pulmonary arteries, excluding atresia or stenosis, is for either the right or left pulmonary artery to have an aortic origin. Most frequently the anomalous artery arises via the arterial duct. Although seen in the presence of pulmonary atresia, usually with the other lung supplied by major systemic-to-pulmonary collateral arteries (Figure 9.48), it can be found with the other pulmonary artery connected to the patent pulmonary trunk. In this arrangement, the duct will often close with time. There will then be apparent unilateral absence of that pulmonary artery that was initially fed through the duct. This is common in tetralogy of Fallot or a double-outlet right ventricle, but about half of the patients thus afflicted have otherwise normal hearts. In our experience, it is rare to find true absence of the hilar pulmonary artery.

Less frequently, the anomalous pulmonary artery, usually the right, can arise directly from the ascending aorta (Figure 9.49). This is sometimes termed a hemitruncus, but we do not recommend use of this term, because almost always there are two normally formed arterial valves. Rarely, the right pulmonary artery may take an unusually high origin from the right side of the ascending portion of a common arterial trunk. Even in this setting, the descriptive title of common trunk with anomalous origin of the right pulmonary artery is preferable to hemitruncus.

When the anomalously connected pulmonary artery arises directly from the aorta, surgical repair consists simply of detachment from the aorta and reattachment to the pulmonary trunk. This is somewhat more difficult in the presence of a common trunk, but the same basic principle is followed for repair. When the anomalous pulmonary artery is fed through a duct, or connected by a ligament, it will arise from the aortic arch or a brachiocephalic artery. Care must be taken during surgical reconstruction to ensure that ductal tissue is not incorporated with the anastomosis, as it may subsequently

**Fig. 9.46** The specimen shows a potential double aortic arch that is interrupted between the left common carotid artery (LCCA) and the left subclavian artery (LSCA), the latter arising in a retro-oesophageal fashion from the right-sided aortic arch. Despite the incomplete nature of the double arch, the presence of the arterial duct, running from the left subclavian artery to the left pulmonary artery, produces a vascular ring around the tracheooesophageal pedicle. The right common carotid (RCCA) and right subclavian (RSCA) arteries arise from the right aortic arch.

![](_page_24_Figure_4.jpeg)

**Fig. 9.47** In this heart, there is interruption of the aortic arch between the left common carotid (LCCA) and left subclavian (LSCA) arteries. The ascending aorta, however, gives rise to the two common carotid arteries only, the right subclavian artery (RSCA) being isolated, and arising from the right pulmonary artery via the right-sided arterial duct (white star). The descending aorta and the left subclavian artery are fed by the left-sided arterial duct (red star).

constrict and produce stenosis at the site of repair. In cases with unilateral absence of a pulmonary artery, it is usual to find pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertensive vascular disease in the normally connected lung, probably because of its being disproportionately small and having to receive the entire right ventricular output<sup>25</sup>.

A much more rare anomaly is when the left pulmonary artery arises from the right pulmonary artery. The abnormal left pulmonary artery originates within the right chest (Figures 9.50, 9.51), and passes between the trachea and oesophagus to the left pulmonary hilum, creating the vascular sling (Figs. 9.52)<sup>26</sup>. This may result in repeated

respiratory problems, requiring division and transplantation of the offending artery. As discussed earlier, the right pulmonary artery may arise anomalously from the aorta or brachiocephalic artery, but an abnormal right pulmonary vessel arising from the left pulmonary artery has not, to our knowledge,

been reported. The reason for this is not clear.

into the right chest may create a ring-like disposition that can obstruct the left bronchus. The displaced heart, pulling on the left pulmonary artery, draws the ligament and descending aorta across the left bronchus, compressing the

bronchus against the spinal column. Division of the ligament, and grafting of the aorta, may be necessary to allow the pulmonary trunk and aorta to spring apart and unroof the constricting circle27–<sup>29</sup> .

the study of cardiovascular disease, as it was the first congenital malformation to be cured by operative intervention<sup>30</sup>. Although now the duct can be closed

safely by techniques of interventional catheterisation<sup>31,32</sup>, its interruption remains a paradigm of the best of surgical science. The anatomy is almost

always predictable, and the operative results uniformly excellent.

Because the arterial system develops with bilateral symmetry, a persistent duct

Fig. 9.54 This operative view through a median sternotomy shows the origin of a persistently patent arterial duct from the distal extent of the pulmonary trunk.

may be either right- or left-sided, although the latter is overwhelmingly more common. Because the duct can persist on either side, or bilaterally, then as discussed earlier, it may be important as part of a vascular ring, or in providing the origin of an isolated brachiocephalic artery (Figure 9.47). Persistent patency may also play an important physiological role when it accompanies other complex congenital cardiovascular anomalies, such as interruption of the aortic arch, aortic or pulmonary valvar atresia, or discordant ventriculoarterial connections. In this section, we confine our discussion to the primary congenital condition of an isolated left-sided persistently patent arterial duct.

Although it is possible to approach the patent duct anteriorly, and sometimes necessary to use this route (Figure 9.54), the normal operative approach is through a left lateral thoracotomy (Figure 9.55). The duct arises from the posterosuperior aspect of the junction of the pulmonary trunk and left pulmonary artery. It courses posteriorly and slightly leftwards to join the junction of the aortic arch and descending aorta just distal to and opposite the origin of the left subclavian artery. Its pulmonary end is covered by a fold of pericardium, and its aortic end by parietal pleura. It may be

confused with the aortic isthmus, particularly in the infant, and it is possible to identify the left pulmonary artery as a patent duct. Even under the best conditions, these other structures may be mistakenly ligated in place of the duct. The caveats of this procedure have been elegantly reviewed33. Approached laterally, the best anatomical guide to the duct is the vagus nerve and its recurrent laryngeal branch. The vagus nerve passes along the subclavian artery, crossing over the aortic arch before heading in a posterior direction to disappear behind the hilum. Just at the level of the duct, it gives off the recurrent nerve (Figure 9.55), which then curves beneath the inferomedial wall of the duct before ascending along the posteromedial aspect of the aorta into the groove between the trachea and oesophagus.

Access to the duct may be achieved by incising the mediastinal parietal pleura, either between the phrenic and vagus nerves, or more posteriorly over the aorta itself. With either approach, the recurrent nerve must be visualised to guard against direct trauma or injury by traction. The fold of pericardium extending over the pulmonary end of the duct may be lifted away by sharp dissection. The posteromedial wall of the duct is firmly

attached by another more fibrous fold to the bronchus. It is this firm fibrous fold that prevents easy circumscription of the duct with a right-angled clamp. To minimise the risk of tearing the wall of the duct, this tissue must be divided by sharp dissection. This can be done through a superior approach over the aortic end of the duct, or by freeing the aorta and retracting it medially. In the latter instance, small but potentially troublesome bronchial vessels may be encountered, arising from the posterior wall of the aorta. Another anatomical note of caution involves the thoracic duct and its tributaries in the area of the origin of the subclavian artery (Figure 9.29). Division of any of these major lymph vessels is liable to lead to chylothorax and its attendant difficulties. Should the lymphatic trunks be inadvertently divided, they must be ligated to avoid chylothorax. The duct in an infant or small child can measure from one to 15 millimetres in length and diameter. Rarely, it can be aneurysmally dilated (Figure 9.56)34. These may be aneurysms of a truly patent duct, or may simply be a dilated ductal diverticulum with a closed pulmonary end. In general, the short and fat duct should be cross-clamped, divided, and oversewn to minimise the chances of

incomplete ligation or tearing of the vessel wall. For the longer thin duct, a triple ligation technique has proved to be safe and effective<sup>35</sup> .

The clinical presentation of an aortopulmonary window is often similar to that of a common arterial trunk. The anatomical distinction lies in the mode of

ventriculoarterial connection. Where, in a common trunk, there is a solitary arterial valve, an aortopulmonary window is always associated with separate aortic and

**Fig. 9.57** This specimen, shown in anatomical orientation, the aorta having been opened, shows an aortopulmonary window. Note the presence of the separate arterial trunks and valves proximal to the defect (see also Figure 9.46).

The heart is sectioned to replicate the left anterior oblique subcostal echocardiographic section. In this heart, the window (open double-headed arrow) has some length. Note also the separate walls of the arterial trunks proximal to the window (closed arrow).

pulmonary valves (Figure 9.57). Although the ventricular septum is usually intact, this defect frequently is associated with additional congenital cardiovascular anomalies<sup>36</sup>. The defect itself is located usually in the right lateral wall of the pulmonary trunk anterior and opposite to the origin of the right pulmonary artery, which frequently overrides the window, or arises directly

from the aorta (Figure 9.58). This means that its opening into the left side of the ascending aorta is just distal to the sinutubular junction. The window can also be associated with the origin of one of the

coronary arteries from the pulmonary trunk. The defect itself can take the form of a well-demarcated short tubular channel, or present as an extensive fenestration. Surgical repair is best accomplished through an incision in the ascending aorta using standard cardiopulmonary bypass techniques. As a general rule, closed methods are not advisable, not even for the more tubular defects. When the window supplies a vital part of the circulation, it cannot be closed without providing an alternate source of blood for the dependent segment of the circulation.

## ANOMALIES OF THE CORONARY ARTERIES

Congenital malformations of the coronary arteries in otherwise normally structured hearts have, traditionally, been categorised as major or minor. This approach was rooted in the belief that the so-called major anomalies were those that produced symptomatology, whereas the minor lesions were thought to be of no clinical relevance<sup>37</sup>. The potential danger of such a classification became evident when it was realised that some lesions categorised as minor within this concept could be a cause of sudden cardiac death<sup>38</sup>. Because of this

discrepancy between presumed anatomical and revealed clinical significance, it now seems preferable to account for these malformations on a descriptive basis. Within such a descriptive categorisation, the anomalies can be grouped into those with an anomalous origin of the coronary arteries from the arterial roots, those with an anomalous course of the epicardial coronary arteries, those with anomalous communications between the coronary arteries and other structures within the heart, or combinations of such findings.

# Anomalous origin of the coronary arteries

The coronary arteries can arise anomalously either from the pulmonary trunk or, rarely, from the right or left pulmonary artery. They can also take an anomalous origin from the aorta itself. It is the anomalous origin from the pulmonary trunk that is of most clinical significance. Often described as the Bland–White–Garland syndrome, the anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary trunk (Figures 9.59–9.61) usually presents in infancy with ischaemia of the left ventricle (Figure 9.62). If there is a well-developed collateral circulation, presentation can be

markedly delayed, some cases not presenting until childhood or even adolescence. The clinical problems are produced by the extent of ischaemia of the left ventricular myocardium, which can be extreme. It is important to reattach the artery to the aorta as soon as the diagnosis is made. In most instances, the artery arises from the left sinus of the pulmonary trunk, to the right-hand side of the observer standing, figuratively speaking, in the non-adjacent sinus<sup>39</sup>. It is relatively easy to transfer the arterial origin, together with a button of pulmonary sinus, back to the left-hand adjacent sinus of the aorta. It is rare now to create an aortopulmonary tunnel in order to reconnect the artery to the aorta<sup>40</sup>. Either of these procedures, nonetheless, is usually preferable to simple ligation of the coronary artery. The pattern that may create problems in transfer is when the artery arises from a branch of the pulmonary trunk rather than from the trunk itself. Other patterns, such as the anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the pulmonary trunk, do not produce the same degree of symptomatology, and often do not come to the attention of the surgeon. If encountered, an anomalous right coronary artery can be transferred back to the aortic root readily.

We have already discussed the significance of an anomalous origin of one coronary artery from the aorta itself in Chapter 4. As we showed, the coronary

arteries usually arise from the two aortic sinuses that are adjacent to the pulmonary trunk. In the normal heart, the left coronary artery arises from the left-hand

facing sinus, while the right coronary artery arises from the right-hand facing sinus. Accessory orifices supplying either the infundibular artery, the artery to the sinus

node, or an artery supplying the walls of the arterial trunks, are by no means uncommon. These accessory branches should not be interpreted as representing anomalies. The circumflex and anterior descending branches of the left coronary artery can also rarely take separate origins from the left-hand facing sinus in an otherwise normal heart. Usually the arteries arise within the coronary aortic sinuses, but origin at the sinutubular junction, or just above it, should not be considered abnormal. High origin, however, or an oblique course of a coronary artery through the wall, particularly when crossing the peripheral end of a zone of apposition between the valvar leaflets, should be considered anomalous, as should the origin of either coronary artery from an inappropriate sinus or, as occurs very rarely, from the non-facing aortic sinus<sup>41</sup> . The origin from an inappropriate sinus is of greatest importance, as this is now well established to be a harbinger of sudden cardiac death42. As we showed in Chapter 4, either coronary artery can arise from an inappropriate sinus. The artery then courses between the arterial trunks, typically crossing the peripheral end of the zone of apposition between the leaflets

guarding the two aortic coronary sinuses. This is described as an intramural arrangement (Figure 9.63). Surgical unroofing is not difficult, but whether such relief is always necessary has still to be determined.

The finding of a single coronary artery also represents an anomalous origin from the aortic root. This can be found in two patterns. In the first, all three coronary arteries arise from the same aortic sinus, with one, two, or three orifices within the sinus. Usually it is the right-hand sinus that gives origin to the coronary arteries. There is then an associated anomalous epicardial course of the branches of the left coronary artery as they reach the anticipated locations. As discussed in Chapter 4, this can involve the anterior interventricular branch tracking between the aorta and the pulmonary trunk, with the potential for its constriction. Alternatively, the main stem of the left coronary artery can run across the subpulmonary infundibulum, tracking towards the left atrial appendage before dividing into the circumflex and anterior interventricular arteries (Figure 9.64). The solitary coronary artery can also arise from the left aortic sinus, and the right coronary artery can then course between the aortic root and the subpulmonary infundibulum to reach the right atrioventricular groove (Figure 9.65). Yet another pattern is for the right coronary artery to take its normal origin from the right-hand facing sinus, but then to continue beyond the crux as the circumflex artery, and to terminate at the obtuse margin as the anterior interventricular artery (see Chapter 4). This pattern probably has no clinical significance. In addition to an anomalous origin, congenital malformations can also afflict normally attached arteries, producing the effect of an anomalous origin. Particularly important in this respect is congenital atresia of the main stem of the left coronary artery (Figure 9.66). This can be another substrate for sudden death in an adolescent or young adult43. Unfortunately, this anomaly is unlikely to be diagnosed prior to the event, when it could readily be treated by surgical manoeuvres.

structured hearts, it is seen more frequently in hearts that are themselves malformed, such as those with discordant ventriculoarterial connections or a common arterial trunk. The clinical significance of these anomalies has yet to be fully determined. Some are found as

chance observations at autopsy, such as the origin of the circumflex coronary artery from the right coronary artery, with passage through the transverse sinus to reach the left atrioventricular groove (Figure 9.67). Others may be of significance for sudden death, such as the passage between the aorta and the pulmonary trunk as discussed in Chapter 4. In this respect, muscular bridging of the epicardial coronary arteries (Figure 9.68) may also be of relevance, although the significance of this finding has still to be established.

### Anomalous communications of the coronary arteries

Fistulous communications between the coronary arteries and the ventricles are seen most frequently when atresia of an outflow tract is seen in the setting of an intact

ventricular septum, notably in pulmonary atresia with an intact ventricular septum (see Chapter 7, page 235 and Figure 7.157). Such communications can also be found in otherwise normally structured hearts, and the anomalous artery can be joined to any other cardiac structure. The right

coronary artery is most frequently involved, and it may connect to the right atrium (Figures 9.69, 9.70), the superior caval vein, the coronary sinus, the right ventricle, the pulmonary trunk, a pulmonary vein, or the left ventricle. The fistulas can also take origin from the

![](_page_36_Picture_2.jpeg)

left coronary artery (Figure 9.71). The communication itself can be a large solitary orifice, or a complex worm-like aneurysmal cavity. When the communication is simple and large, shunting across it can be considerable and the artery itself can be markedly dilated. Steals can also result, with consequent ischaemia in the area of

myocardium from which the steal has occurred.

#### Aortoventricular tunnels

These tunnels are rare lesions. The anatomical arrangement is difficult to understand, as the essence of the lesions is to bypass the hinge of an aortic valvar leaflet (Figure 9.72). Typically, the tunnels extend between the aorta and the left ventricle, although aorto-right ventricular tunnels do exist (Figure 9.73). It is the ones communicating with the left ventricle that are most frequent44. The anomalous

channel, coursing from the left ventricle between the base of the afflicted aortic sinus and the leaflet it

supports, extends through the tissue plane that separates the aortic and pulmonary roots. The base of the tunnel is supported by the ventricular myocardium, while its roof is made up of arterial wall.
