A thin, well-defined linear structure representing an *inferior accessory fissure*. An inferior accessory fissure segregates the medial basal segment of either lower lobe from the remaining basal segments. This variation is a common finding in the population and generally of no clinical significance.

A thin, curvilinear structure extends through the medial right upper lobe, representing an *azygos fissure*—the lung subtended by the azygos fissure is referred to as the *azygos lobe*. The azygos vein courses through the azygos fissure. This anomaly is formed when the azygos vein extends into the right upper lobe during fetal development. The azygos fissure consists of 4 layers of pleura: 2 of visceral pleura and 2 of parietal pleura. This finding is a usually an incidentally detected anomaly, without clinical significance, and is found in 0.3% to 0.5% of the population.

An anomalous bronchus originating directly from the right lateral trachea wall—this anomaly is known as a *tracheal bronchus.* A tracheal bronchus supplies all or a portion of the apical segment of the right upper lobe and is found in 0.1% of the population.
