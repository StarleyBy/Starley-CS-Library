ne of the most frequent hospital-acquired infections encountered in critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation is *ventilator-associated pneumonia* (*VAP*). VAP is defined as pneumonia that develops 48 hours after a patient has been placed on mechanical ventilation. It is an important subset of **hospital-acquired pneumonia** (HAP), which is pneumonia that occurs 48 hours or longer after admission to the hospital and results from an infection that was not incubating at the time of admission. HAP is differentiated from **health care—associated pneumonia** 

(HCAP), which afflicts patients who have resided in a long-term care facility or received acute care in an acute-care hospital for a specified time before developing pneumonia (i.e.,  $\geq 2$  days within 90 days of the infection) (Key Point 14.1).

Most often VAP is caused by bacterial infections, but it can be caused by fungal infections or may be associated with viral epidemics (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]) (Box 14.1). VAP that develops between 48 and 72 hours after

**Key Point 14.1** VAP is one of the most frequent hospital-acquired infections in critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation.

tracheal intubation is usually classified as **early-onset pneumonia**, whereas pneumonia that develops later than 72 hours is considered **late-onset pneumonia**. <sup>1,2</sup>

Despite major advances in the management of ventilator-dependent patients, VAP continues to complicate the course of treatment of a significant number of patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation.<sup>3</sup> Development of VAP is associated with prolonged hospital stays, increased health care cost, and mortality rates that range from 25% to 50%.<sup>3-7</sup>

Guidelines for the management of patients with VAP focus on early diagnosis, appropriate antibiotic treatment, and various strategies to prevent the transmission of pathogenic organisms to patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Although there has been considerable debate among clinicians regarding the most effective means of diagnosing and treating VAP, it is agreed that successful management of VAP requires early diagnosis and appropriate use of antibiotic therapy to avoid the emergence of multidrugresistant (MDR) microorganisms (Key Point 14.2). Effective infection control procedures and surveillance techniques are also necessary to prevent the transmission of nosocomial infections. Careful handwashing with antimicrobial agents, proper disinfection and sterilization of respiratory therapy equipment, along with the adherence to standard and disease-specific precautions, and

implementation of clinical protocols, such as "VAP bundles," can significantly reduce the incidence of VAP.

It is beyond the scope of this text to review every clinical study that has been conducted on VAP. A list of selected articles is provided at the end of the chapter for readers interested in further detail on specific studies about the management of patients with VAP, HAP, and HCAP.

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

VAP is one of the most common **nosocomial infections** encountered in the intensive care unit (ICU).<sup>5</sup> The highest risk for the development of VAP occurs early in the course of the hospital stay. Cook and colleagues estimated that the risk for development of VAP is about 3% per day during the first 5 days of receiving mechanical ventilation, 2% per day for days 5 through 10, and 1% thereafter.<sup>9</sup>

The incidence of VAP ranges from 8% to 28% for all intubated patients. <sup>3,5,10</sup> Clinical studies have consistently demonstrated that critically ill patients with VAP have significantly higher mortality rates than mechanically ventilated patients without pneumonia. The overall attributable mortality rate for VAP ranges from 5% to 48%, depending on the infecting organism(s), underlying disease, comorbidities, and prior antimicrobial therapy. <sup>3,11-15</sup>

The prognosis for patients with early-onset VAP is generally better than those who develop pneumonia later in the course of treatment. The reason for the better prognosis for early-onset VAP is related to the fact that these patients are typically infected with antibiotic-sensitive bacteria, whereas patients with late-onset VAP (i.e., >5 days) are more likely to be infected with MDR pathogens.

#### **Causes and Risk Factors**

VAP has been linked to the aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions and esophageal/gastric contents, direct inoculation of infectious material into the trachea and lungs during endotracheal intubation, inhalation of infected aerosols, embolization of biofilm that can be found in the endotracheal tubes (ETs) of patients receiving prolonged mechanical ventilation, exogenous penetration from the pleural space, and the hematogenous spread of extrapulmonary infections to the lung. <sup>5,16</sup>

Box 14.1 lists the most prevalent aerobic gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria that have been identified as potential pathogens responsible for VAP. Historically, aerobic gramnegative bacilli have accounted for nearly 60% of all VAP infections with *Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Escherichia coli*, and *Acinetobacter* occurring at the highest frequency (Key Point 14.3).<sup>17</sup> More recent studies have shown that gram-positive bacteria are becoming increasingly more common in VAP, with methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA) being the predominant gram-positive organism isolated.<sup>3,7,18</sup> **Polymicrobial infections** (i.e., infection by multiple pathogenic

**Key Point 14.3** Aerobic gram-negative bacilli have accounted for the majority of all VAP infections.

microorganisms) constitute nearly 50% of all VAP infections, although pathogenic anaerobic infections are not typically found in these mixed-type infections.<sup>3</sup>

Various independent factors contribute to the development of VAP or may increase the frequency of complications in these patients. Box 14.2 lists several host-related factors and therapeutic interventions that have been identified as risk factors for VAP. Notice that these factors are generally related to the characteristics of the patient populations affected (e.g., age of the patient, diagnosis at admission, severity of the illness, presence of comorbidities) and the effect of using various pharmacological interventions and respiratory therapy modalities in the treatment of ventilator-dependent patients.

Older patients are at greater risk for developing VAP than are younger patients. Patients treated for trauma, burns, multiple organ failure, or impaired levels of consciousness typically have the highest risk for development of VAP. The presence of comorbidities may actually predispose patients to infections with specific

organisms. For example, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have increased risk for *Haemophilus influenzae*, *Streptococcus pneumonia*, and *Moraxella catarrhalis*, whereas patients with cystic fibrosis are susceptible to *P. aeruginosa* and *S. aureus* infections.<sup>3</sup> MRSA is particularly prevalent in patients with diabetes or head trauma and those who have been hospitalized for prolonged periods in the ICU.<sup>7</sup> VAP is also recognized as a major complication of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It has been estimated that 35% to 70% of patients with ARDS develop pneumonia, which can lead to sepsis and multiple organ failure. The mortality rate for ARDS patients with VAP is significantly higher than in patients without VAP.<sup>3,19</sup>

Therapeutic interventions are generally categorized as pharmacological and nonpharmacological. Examples of pharmacological interventions that can lead to the development of VAP or complicate the course of treatment for these patients include concurrent steroid therapy, inappropriate antimicrobial therapy, overuse of sedatives and paralytics for mechanically ventilated patients, and the use of histamine-2 antagonists and gastro-protective agents, such as antacids.

Inappropriate use of antibiotics in the hospital setting is particularly troublesome because it has been associated with the selection of MDR pathogens (Key Point 14.4). It has been suggested that prolonged antibiotic administration to ICU patients for a primary infection may favor selection and subsequent colonization with resistant pathogens responsible for superinfections. This is an important issue for patients with late-onset VAP because, as mentioned previously, these patients are at a higher risk for being infected with MDR pathogens. Imprudent use of sedatives and paralytics can also increase the incidence of VAP by impairing the patient's level of consciousness, which can ultimately blunt the patient's cough reflex and increase the chances of aspiration. Box 14.3 lists the most common risk factors for MDR infections.

**Key Point 14.4** Inappropriate use of antibiotics in the hospital setting has been associated with an increased emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens.

# BOX **14.3**

### Common Risk Factors for Multidrug-Resistant Infections<sup>7</sup>

- · Antimicrobial therapy in the preceding 90 days
- · Current hospitalization for 5 or more days
- High frequency of antibiotic resistance in the community or a specific hospital unit
- Presence of risk factors for health care—associated pneumonia
- Hospitalization for 2 or more days in the preceding 90 days
- Residence in a nursing home or extended care facility
- · Home infusion therapy (including antibiotics)
- Chronic dialysis within 30 days
- · Home wound care
- · Family member with multidrug-resistant pathogen
- Immunosuppressive disease and/or therapy

Nonpharmacological interventions associated with the increased risk for VAP include the need for an ET or tracheostomy tube (TT) during ventilation; routine care of ventilator circuits, humidifiers, and nebulizers; and the use of respirometers, reusable electronic ventilator probes and sensors, bronchoscopes, and endoscopes. The most important of these nonpharmacological factors that has been found to be associated with VAP is the use of an ET or TT during mechanical ventilation. The incidence of VAP is 6- to 21-fold higher in patients who are intubated receiving mechanical ventilation compared with the incidence in patients receiving noninvasive mechanical ventilation. This has led some clinicians to suggest that "endotracheal intubation—associated pneumonia" might be a more appropriate name for this type of pneumonia.

Respiratory therapy equipment has long been implicated as a source of nosocomial infections. Indeed, epidemics of HAP and VAP are most often associated with contamination of respiratory therapy equipment, bronchoscopes, and endoscopes. Instituting stringent infection control procedures can reduce the incidence of nosocomial infections in hospitals and other health care facilities; however, ensuring that all of the clinical staff members adhere to the prescribed infection control policies remains a formidable task. Surveillance of ICU patients at high risk for bacterial pneumonia also can be an important part of determining trends and identifying outbreaks.<sup>21</sup> Additional details on various non-pharmacological strategies that can be used to reduce the incidence of VAP are presented later in this chapter.

# PATHOGENESIS OF VENTILATOR-ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA

The pathogenesis of VAP most often involves colonization of the aerodigestive tract with pathogenic bacteria and aspiration of contaminated secretions into the lower airways, followed by colonization of the normally sterile lower airways and lung parenchyma with these infectious microrganisms.<sup>15</sup> The upper airways of healthy individuals typically contain nonpathogenic bacteria, such as the viridans group of streptococci, *Haemophilus* spp., and anaerobes.<sup>5</sup> Aerobic gram-negative bacilli, most notably virulent forms of *P. aeruginosa* and *Acinetobacter*, are rarely found in the respiratory tract of healthy individuals because of anatomical barriers, the cough reflex, mucociliary clearance mechanisms, and innate cellular and humoral immune factors (e.g., leukocytes, immunoglobulins).

During critical illnesses, particularly in patients with an ET and receiving mechanical ventilation, there is a dramatic shift in the flora of the oropharyngeal tract to gram-negative bacilli and *S. aureus.* <sup>5,7</sup> This shift in flora may be attributed to factors that compromise host defense mechanisms, including comorbidities, malnutrition, reduced levels of mucosal immunoglobulin A, increased production of proteases, exposed and denuded mucous membranes, elevated airway pH, and an increased number of airway receptors for bacteria as a result of acute illness and prior antimicrobial use. <sup>5,22-24</sup> Aspiration of the contaminated oropharyngeal secretions and, in some cases, gastroesophageal contents can occur because the patient is unable to protect the lower airways. Impaired level of consciousness, gastroesophageal reflux, a blunted gag reflex, and abnormal swallowing can all contribute to

the risk for aspiration.  $^{15}$  After these offending organisms penetrate and colonize the lower airways, they can overwhelm already compromised pulmonary cellular and humoral immune defense mechanisms and eventually lead to VAP.  $^{15}$ 

# DIAGNOSIS OF VENTILATOR-ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA

The lack of a precise definition for the diagnosis of VAP has caused considerable debate among clinicians.<sup>25-27</sup> It has been suggested that clinical criteria involving patient symptoms and signs, chest radiographs, and baseline hematologic studies can be effective for starting empirical antibiotic therapy; however, simply relying on clinical findings to guide therapeutic interventions can be subjective (i.e., high interobserver variability), resulting in a failure to accurately diagnose VAP and leading to inappropriate antibiotic therapy if the infection is polymicrobial in origin or if a drug-resistant organism is present.

The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) presented recommendations in 2005 to address these concerns regarding the management of VAP. The ATS/IDSA recommendations provided a list of clinical criteria that could be used in the diagnosis of VAP. The guidelines further advised that invasive microbiological procedures, such as quantitative cultures of lower respiratory secretions obtained by bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) or protected specimen brush (PSB) procedure, are often necessary to ensure effective treatment of patients with VAP.

In 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and National Healthcare Safety Network proposed an updated definition that was designed to improve the reporting criteria for VAP used by institutions. Although the CDC surveillance definition incorporates the general features of the ATS/IDSA definition, several points are noteworthy. For example, the CDC surveillance definition uses the term ventilator-associated event to describe a range of conditions and complications that occur in mechanically ventilated patients, including VAP.<sup>27</sup> As Table 14.1 shows, a ventilator-associated event can be categorized as a ventilatorassociated condition, an infection-related ventilator-associated complication, and possible pneumonia or probable pneumonia. The CDC surveillance definition relies on the use of only objective data, clearly defined time criteria, and the exclusion of radiographic imaging to diagnose the presence of pneumonia in ventilated patients.26,27

## **Clinical Diagnosis**

VAP should be suspected when a patient on mechanical ventilation demonstrates radiographic evidence of new or progressive infiltrates and one or more of the following findings: fever, leukocytosis, purulent tracheobronchial secretions, decreased oxygenation, increased minute ventilation, decreased tidal volume, and increased respiratory rate. Table 14.2 provides a list of clinical criteria that can be used in the clinical diagnosis of VAP. Fever and the presence of pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiographs are nonspecific findings that can be associated with numerous other conditions, including chemical and radiation pneumonitis, atelectasis, pulmonary embolism and infarction, lung contusion, ARDS, and drug or hypersensitivity reactions.

Some clinicians emphasize certain findings over others using a "weighted" approach to clinical diagnosis. The Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) is an example of this type of approach. The CPIS includes six clinical assessments, with each item given a score of 0 to 2 points (see Table 14.2). Assessment criteria include fever, leukocyte count, quantity and purulence of tracheal secretions, oxygenation status, type of radiographic abnormality, and results of a tracheal aspirate culture and Gram

stain. (Note that a modified CPIS in which the endotracheal aspirate culture and Gram stain results are excluded is also available. In this case the score will range from 0 to 10 instead of 0 to 12). When all six criteria are used, a score greater than 6 is considered evidence of the presence of VAP. It is generally accepted that measurements of CPIS should be performed at the beginning of antibiotic therapy and after 2 to 3 days to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment course. Although some investigators

# Case Study 14.1

#### Patient Case-VAP

A 65-year-old man is admitted to the intensive care unit after thoracic surgery. He has an endotracheal tube and has been receiving pressure-controlled mechanical ventilation for 48 hours. The attending physician suspects that the patient may have ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The following clinical data were obtained during an initial assessment. What is his Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score and does he demonstrate enough evidence of VAP to warrant the initiation of antibiotic therapy?

Temperature =  $39.5^{\circ}$ C White blood cell count = cells/mm<sup>3</sup> Localized infiltrates on chest radiograph Purulent secretions  $P_aO_2/F_1O_2 = 300$ 

have found considerable interobserver variability and a lack of specificity to guide antibiotic therapy, a case can be made that measurement of the CPIS may reduce the mortality rate associated with VAP.<sup>28,29</sup> The measurement of CPIS may also provide information that can allow the clinician to aggressively treat patients with VAP while limiting the course of antibiotic therapy and thus controlling for the development of bacterial resistance<sup>25</sup> (Case Study 14.1).

# **Bacteriological (Quantitative) Diagnosis**

As mentioned, many clinicians have concerns about simply using clinical findings to guide antibiotic therapy in VAP. They think this approach can result in the unnecessary use of broad-range antibiotics, which in turn can lead to the emergence of MDR strains of microorganisms and higher mortality rates for patients afflicted with VAP. Numerous studies have shown that obtaining quantitative cultures of specimens from the lower respiratory tract by conventional **fiberoptic bronchoscopy** or nonbronchoscopic techniques can significantly improve the diagnosis of VAP and facilitate decision making regarding the management of these patients. <sup>3,30,31</sup>

Fiberoptic bronchoscopy allows the clinician to have direct access to the lower airways. The most common bronchoscopic techniques used to obtain samples from the lower airways and the lung parenchyma involve BAL and PSB sampling. Selection of the sampling site is usually based on the location of the infiltrate on chest radiographs or by direct visualization of inflammation and purulent secretions in the airway. Note that relying on chest radiographs when selecting the appropriate sampling area can be challenging if diffuse pulmonary infiltrates are present.

A variety of nonbronchoscopic techniques have been described.<sup>32</sup> The most commonly used nonbronchoscopic techniques include mini-BAL, blinded bronchial sampling, and blinded PSB. The advantages of using these techniques over conventional bronchoscopy are that nonbronchoscopic techniques are noninvasive and less expensive than bronchoscopy and can be performed by individuals not qualified to perform fiberoptic bronchoscopy.<sup>3</sup> These techniques also typically do not result in compromised gas exchange, which often occurs during fiberoptic

bronchoscopy. The primary disadvantage of using the non-bronchoscopic techniques is that samples are obtained blindly and can therefore increase the chances of a sampling error because of lack of direct visualization of the sampling site.<sup>33</sup>

Once the sample is obtained, it should be processed without delay according to clearly defined procedures for bacteriological analysis to prevent the loss of viability of the pathogenic organisms or overgrowth by contaminants. Bacteriological studies include quantitative culture techniques and microscopic analysis of the cultures using an appropriate stain (e.g., Gram stain) to differentiate pathogens from oropharyngeal contaminants.<sup>3</sup> In patients with VAP, pathogens are usually present at concentrations of 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> colony-forming units (CFU)/mL, whereas contaminants are generally present in concentrations of less than 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/mL. (Baselski has provided a complete description of the standard laboratory procedures for processing bronchoscopic samples in suspected cases of VAP.)<sup>31</sup> Direct microscopic and histological examinations of BAL and PBS samples can be used to identify the presence or absence of bacteria in the lower respiratory tract.

# TREATMENT OF VENTILATOR-ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA

Treatment of VAP can be challenging, even under the best of conditions. It should be apparent from the aforementioned issues related to diagnosing VAP that developing an effective strategy for the management of these patients ultimately depends on establishing a reliable diagnosis. Initiating empirical antibiotic therapy should be based on whether the patient has any of the risk factors for MDR pathogens. The ATS/IDSA Guidelines for the Management of Adults with HAP and VAP provide a series of pathways to guide clinicians on the initiation of empirical antibiotic therapy in addition to strategies that can be used to reduce the emergence of MDR pathogens. Information that should also be reviewed when designing an antibiotic regimen includes the predominant pathogens identified for the specific clinical setting and local patterns of antibiotic susceptibility, cost and availability of the antibiotics used, and any formulary restrictions.<sup>7</sup>

The algorithm shown in Fig. 14.1 is a summary of current management strategies recommended for patients with suspected VAP. De-escalation of antibiotic therapy or, more specifically, focusing the types and duration of antibiotics used (i.e., broadrange antibiotics vs. limited-spectrum antibiotics) can be accomplished once quantitative data on lower respiratory tract and blood cultures are available (Key Point 14.5). It is important to understand that successful treatment of patients with VAP requires serial clinical and microbiological assessments. More specific information about the use of various antibiotic dosing schedules, including combination therapy, can be found in the ATS/IDSA Guideline listed in the references at the end of this chapter (Case Study 14.2).

# STRATEGIES TO PREVENT VENTILATOR-ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA

Implementing an effective infection control program in the ICU is essential to reduce the incidence of VAP. The first step in the development and implementation of an effective program is

**Key Point 14.5** De-escalating antibiotic therapy can be accomplished once quantitative data on lower respiratory tract and blood cultures are available. De-escalation of antibiotic therapy is an important method that can be used to reduce the incidence of MDR pathogens because it reduces unnecessary use of antibiotics.

# Patient Case—Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus

A 55-year-old woman with a 35-pack-year history of smoking cigarettes is admitted into the intensive care unit after a cholecystectomy. She has a history of diabetes mellitus and has been mechanically ventilated via an endotracheal tube for 5 days. Her chest radiograph demonstrates localized infiltrates in the right middle lobe. Her white cell count is cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, and the results of bronchoalveolar lavage show the presence of methicillinresistant *S. aureus*. Briefly describe the appropriate antibiotic course that should be initiated for this patient.

recognition that it is a high-priority task. Ensuring that everyone on the clinical staff is familiar with the established infection control policies and procedures is critical. Staff must consistently follow these procedures for all patients and recognize the consequences of lapses in continuity of care. Adequate physical and human resources must be provided to establish surveillance mechanisms to track the local incidence of VAP and other nosocomial infections. The findings of the surveillance team must be effectively communicated to the clinical staff on a regular basis, and the program must be updated to reflect the most current evidence-based clinical studies, the use of new technology, and changing patterns of disease in the local environment.<sup>2</sup>

Box 14.4 lists strategies that can be implemented to prevent VAP. Many of these strategies are incorporated into *ventilator bundles*, which are viewed as evidence-based practices that can significantly reduce the incidence of VAP. As mentioned, these strategies are generally categorized as nonpharmacological and pharmacological procedures.<sup>34-37</sup> The following is a brief discussion of each of these strategies that can be used to reduce the incidence of VAP.

# **Nonpharmacological Interventions** *Handwashing*

Routine handwashing with soap and water and alcohol-based hand rubs is the most important prevention strategy to reduce the risk for clinicians transmitting infectious microorganisms from one patient to another or from a contaminated site to a clean site on the same patient <sup>38</sup> (Key Point 14.6). Hand decontamination should be done before and after contact with an intubated patient and before and after performing any procedure in which handling

BOX **14.4** 

# Methods to Reduce the Risk for Nosocomial Pneumonias in Mechanically Ventilated Patients<sup>34-37</sup>

#### **Nonpharmacologic**

- Noninvasive ventilation
- Handwashing and use of accepted infection control procedures and practices
- Semirecumbent positioning of patient
- Appropriate circuit changes (when grossly contaminated)
- Consider using silver-coated antimicrobial endotracheal tubes
- · Heat-moisture exchanges when possible
- Continuous aspiration of subglottic secretions (CASS)
- Appropriate disinfection and sterilization techniques
- Kinetic beds
- Identifying a dedicated person/group for monitoring nosocomial ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) rates
- Use of closed-suction catheters and sterile suction technique
- Avoiding large gastric volumes
- Extubating and removing nasogastric tube as clinically indicated
- Avoiding contamination with ventilator circuit condensate
- Use single patient items such as monitors, O<sub>2</sub> analyzers, resuscitation bags
- · Careful use of inline small-volume nebulizers
- · Consider use of expiratory-line gas traps or filters
- · Oral rather than nasal intubation
- Daily screening of patients for discontinuation of invasive mechanical ventilation and endotracheal extubation

#### **Pharmacological**

- Stress ulcer prophylaxis with sucralfate instead of histamine-2 antagonists in high-risk patients for prevention of stress ulcers (still controversial)
- Possible prophylactic intestinal decontamination (antimicrobial administration)
- Avoid central nervous system depressants
- · Implementation of a sedation interruption protocol

#### **Methods to Improve Host Immunity**

- · Maintain nutritional status
- Avoid agents that impair pulmonary defenses (aminophylline, anesthetics, certain antibiotics, corticosteroids, sedative narcotics, and antineoplastic agents)
- · Minimize use of invasive procedures when possible
- Remove or treat disease states that affect host defenses when possible (acidosis, dehydration, hypoxemia, ethanol intoxication, acid aspiration, stress, thermal injury, diabetic ketoacidosis, liver failure, kidney failure, heart failure)

**Key Point 14.6** Routine handwashing with soap and water and alcohol-based hand rubs is the most important prevention strategy to reduce the risk for nosocomial infections.

items contaminated with respiratory secretions can occur.<sup>32</sup> Wearing gloves and gowns reduces the rate of nosocomial infections, but this practice appears to be most effective when used with patients with specific antibiotic-resistant pathogens.<sup>2</sup>

# Semirecumbent Patient Positioning and Enteral Feeding

Enteral feeding may predispose a patient to VAP by elevating the gastric pH, which can lead to gastric colonization with pathogenic bacteria and cause gastric distention. This in turn can lead to an increased risk for reflux and aspiration. Following some basic guidelines can reduce aspiration of gastric contents. Routine verification of the proper placement of the enteral feed tube is important.<sup>39,40</sup> Intermittent feedings may also be preferable to continuously feeding because preventing overdistention of the stomach can limit gastropulmonary colonization.<sup>35</sup>

Aspiration occurs more often in patients placed in the supine position than in patients in the semirecumbent position (i.e., 30–45 degrees from the horizontal position). When it is feasible and the patient can tolerate it, placing a patient in semi-recumbent position is a low-cost, low-risk procedure effective in reducing the aspiration of gastric contents compared with the supine position.

#### **Noninvasive Ventilation**

Clinical studies have clearly demonstrated that endotracheal intubation is a modifiable risk factor for the development of VAP. Avoiding ET intubation and use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV) has been shown to significantly lower the nosocomial pneumonia rate in select groups of patients (e.g., acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or immunocompromised patients with pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxemic respiratory failure). Using NIV is also associated with a lower rate of other nosocomial infections such as urinary tract infections and catheter-related infections. When it is clinically appropriate, NIV should be preferentially used over invasive ventilation. 36

#### Selection, Changing, and Suctioning of the Endotracheal Tube

It is important to recognize that the type of ET selected and site of insertion are important factors to consider when initiating invasive mechanical ventilation. Advances in ET construction have resulted in the development of different cuff materials and shapes that attempt to reduce leakage of secretions around an inflated cuff. Polyurethane and silicon ET cuffs decrease the formation of longitudinal channels, which can occur with standard polyvinyl cuffs. Changing the shape of the ET cuff also has been shown to reduce leakage. Tapered or cylindrical designs have been shown to reduce fluid leakage compared with ET tubes with the standard globular cuff design. 43

Maintaining adequate ET cuff pressure is also an important factor that must be considered to avoid aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions. There appears to be a higher risk for aspiration pneumonia among patients with persistent intracuff pressures below 20 cm  $\rm H_2O.^{44}$  Increasing the cuff pressure (e.g., to  $\rm 20{-}25~cm~H_2O$ ) decreases but does not completely eliminate this aspiration. Furthermore, it is important to recognize that using higher cuff pressure is not without its own problems of potential airway injury (see Chapter 8).

The use of oral rather than nasal intubation is recommended because sinusitis is a particular concern in nasally intubated patients and is associated with VAP. Furthermore, there is an increased risk for VAP when patients are reintubated. The risk and benefits of reintubation should be considered before changing an ET. If the tube is changed, it is important to avoid contamination of the lower airways with oropharyngeal secretions by properly suctioning around the ET cuff before deflating the cuff or replacing the ET. The CDC recommends using a new suction catheter with each open-suction procedure and using sterile water to rinse the catheter when suctioning is performed. The use of sterile gloves is also appropriate for this procedure.

Recent studies have demonstrated that antimicrobial-coated ET tubes can reduce the incidence of VAP by delaying bacterial colonization and **biofilm** formation on the tube's inner lining. Laboratory studies have suggested that silver is an ideal coating because it is nontoxic and antimicrobial, and it has antiadhesive properties. It is important to mention, however, that although these devices can delay biofilm formation, the antibacterial efficacy of the coating decreases over time. In addition, removal of the biofilm can be difficult because routine tracheal suctioning is not effective. Berra and colleagues introduced a novel device called the *Mucus Shaver* to overcome this limitation. The Mucus Shaver consists of an expandable silicon rubber balloon with shaving rings that adhere to the surface of the ET. This device has been shown to be effective in the removal of biofilm and thus allows the ET tube to retain its antimicrobial efficacy.

# **Continuous Aspiration of Subglottic Secretions (CASS)**

Secretions that pool around the ET cuff are reservoirs of potentially pathogenic bacteria (Key Point 14.7). Efforts to reduce silent aspiration of secretions above and below the ET cuff have led to the development and use of specialized ETs (Fig. 14.2). These specialized ETs have a dorsal lumen above the ET cuff that allows for continuous or intermittent suction of tracheal secretions that accumulate above the patient's subglottic area. CASS has been shown to reduce the incidence of nosocomial pneumonias. 46 Early studies by Valles and colleagues reported that continuous aspiration of subglottic secretions reduced the incidence of VAP by nearly 50%. 50 Interestingly, these investigators also found that episodes of VAP occurred later in patients receiving continuous aspiration (12.0  $\pm$  7.1 days than in the control patients (5.9  $\pm$ 2.1 days).<sup>50</sup> Rello and colleagues also showed a five times greater likelihood of VAP when continuous aspiration of subglottic secretions was not used.46

At present, the CDC makes no specific recommendation about how often continuous inline suction catheters should be changed. Studies have not shown differences in VAP rates between oncedaily and no routine changes in closed-suction catheters. It may be appropriate to leave the catheter inline until it is visibly contaminated or no longer functional.

## Care of the Tracheostomy Tube

TTs placed by the percutaneous route can predispose the patient to the development of pneumonia, possibly from contamination

during the insertion procedure. In cases in which the patient has a TT, the caregiver should wear a gown, use aseptic technique, and replace the tube with one that has been sterilized or given highlevel disinfection. These types of pneumonia are associated with prolonged ventilation and ICU stay but not increased mortality. A common pathogen associated with percutaneous tracheotomy is *Pseudomonas* spp. The service of the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a TT, the patient has a

#### **Ventilator Circuit Management Strategies**

Manipulation of the ventilation circuit may increase the risk for patient aspiration and VAP. Most clinicians agree that reducing ventilator circuit changes is cost-effective and, more important, lessens the risk for VAP. Circuits do not need to be changed unless they are nonfunctional or if they are visibly soiled with secretions or blood.

Using certain types of humidifiers during mechanical ventilation can be another potential source of pathogenic bacteria. Heatmoisture exchangers have the ability to filter bacteria and may be a more effective method of reducing VAP during mechanical ventilation than heated-wire circuits and heated humidifiers. It is important to recognize that patients with thick, tenacious secretions are not good candidates for using these devices because heat-moisture exchangers might not provide adequate

humidification and increase the risk for endotracheal occlusions causing asphyxiation.  $^{36,44,53}$ 

For heated wick or pass-over humidifiers, the CDC recommends the use of sterile water. <sup>47</sup> (NOTE: Although bubble humidifiers are now used only rarely during mechanical ventilation, it is safe to assume that the same advice would be appropriate for these devices, too. <sup>53</sup>) Draining of condensate in the ventilator circuits that use heated humidifiers should be performed in a manner that avoids accidentally allowing circuit condensate from spilling into the patient's ET.

Small-volume nebulizers (SVNs) are sometimes used in the ventilator circuit for the administration of medications. The CDC recommends that between treatments, the SVN be disinfected, rinsed with sterile water, and air-dried.<sup>44</sup> Only sterile solutions should be used to fill SVNs, and whenever possible, unit-dose vials of medication should be used<sup>44</sup> (Key Point 14.8).

#### **Kinetic Therapy**

Immobility in critically ill patients can lead to atelectasis and reduced bronchopulmonary secretion clearance. Several investigators have suggested that **kinetic therapy** or the use of automated rotating beds may be effective in reducing the incidence of VAP, particularly in surgical patients or patients with neurological problems.<sup>39</sup> Whether kinetic beds offer significant advantages over standard ICU patient-turning strategies will require additional studies.<sup>39,44,47</sup> At present, the CDC has no recommendation regarding "kinetic" therapy or continuous lateral rotational therapy.

# **Pharmacological Interventions** *Oropharyngeal Decontamination*

The CDC currently recommends the development and implementation of an oral hygiene program for patients in acute care and long-term care facilities that are at high risk for nosocomial pneumonias. Although there has been a debate regarding the benefits of oral hygiene in preventing VAP, studies have demonstrated that using an oral cleansing agent such as chlorhexidine can modulate oropharyngeal colonization and ultimately decrease the incidence of VAP.<sup>54</sup>

## Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis

Gastrointestinal bleeding and stress ulcers in critically ill patients are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Use of prophylactic treatment, such as H<sub>2</sub>-antagonists and antacids, may reduce the risk for stress ulcers. However, as the acidity of gastric contents decreases, gastric colonization by potentially pathogenic organisms increases (Key Point 14.9). The use of sucralfate may be beneficial in reducing gastric colonization. Sucralfate is a prophylactic agent that does not affect gastric pH.<sup>36</sup> Current findings are controversial, and the use of sucralfate is not recommended at this time for patients at high risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.<sup>37</sup> In patients with ARDS, sucralfate was associated with an increased risk for VAP.<sup>37</sup> The CDC currently has no specific recommendations about the use of sucralfate, H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonists, or antacids for stress-bleeding prophylaxis.<sup>47</sup>

**Key Point** 14.8 Ventilator circuits do not need to be changed unless they are nonfunctional or if they are visibly soiled with secretions or blood.

**Key Point** 14.9 Administering type histamine-2 antagonists and antacids may reduce the risk for stress ulcers, but they can also increase the risk for gastric colonization by potentially pathogenic organisms.

analgesics.) Although strategies used to administer these drugs vary considerably, it has been suggested that implementing a routine of daily sedative infusion interruption can lead to a reduction in the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation and length of stay in the ICU and therefore reduce the risk for  $VAP.^{57,59,60}$ 

# **Selective Digestive Tract Decontamination**

There is substantial interest in topically treating the oropharynx and stomach of patients on mechanical ventilation with antibiotics. The goal is reducing the number of potentially pathogenic organisms that may colonize the stomach. This, in turn, might reduce the incidence of VAP. Selective digestive tract decontamination may reduce VAP and ICU mortality when a combination of topical and intravenous prophylactic antibiotics is used. However, this is not without the long-term risk for the development of antibiotic-resistant organisms.<sup>36</sup>

# **Prophylactic Antibiotics**

The use of both topical and systemic prophylactic antibiotics may reduce respiratory infections and overall mortality rates in critically ill patients.<sup>36</sup> Inadequate and delayed initial treatment contributes to the risk for VAP and is often associated with a delay in writing the medical order.<sup>55,56</sup>

Antibiotics have a "bimodal" effect in the development of VAP. Within the first days of mechanical ventilation, antibiotics protect against pneumonia development, especially against types caused by endogenous flora. But exposure to antibiotics has a significant risk factor for colonization and infection with nosocomial, MDR pathogens that are associated with significant mortality, such as  $P.\ aeruginosa$  and MRSA.  $^{40,55,56}$ 

There are currently no recommendations from the CDC regarding the routine use of systemic antimicrobial agents to prevent VAP or nosocomial pneumonias. On the other hand, judicious use of appropriate antibiotics may reduce patient colonization and subsequent infections with MDR bacteria. 40

## Sedation Interruption and Daily Assessment of Readiness for Endotracheal Extubation

Reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay are important outcomes in the care of critically ill patients. <sup>57,58</sup> Pain and anxiety experienced by patients receiving mechanical ventilation often require sedation and analgesia. (See Chapter 15 for more details regarding the use of sedative and

# SUMMARY

- Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is defined as pneumonia that develops 48 hours after a patient has been placed on mechanical ventilation.
- VAP is the most common nosocomial infection encountered in the ICU.
- Guidelines for the management of VAP focus on early diagnosis, appropriate antibiotic treatment, and various strategies to prevent the transmission of pathogenic organisms to patients receiving mechanical ventilation.
- The prognosis of patients with early-onset VAP is better than those patients with late-onset VAP.
- The most prevalent microorganisms in VAP are gram-negative bacilli. Recent studies have shown an increased incidence of MDR infections, particularly MRSA.
- Several host-related risk factors can contribute to the development of VAP. These factors are related to the age of the patient, diagnosis at admission and severity of the illness, and presence of comorbidities.
- Overuse of sedatives and paralytics, in addition to the use of gastroprotective medications for stress ulcers, can increase the risk for VAP.
- Inappropriate use of antibiotics is associated with the emergence of MDR pathogens.
- Nonpharmacological interventions, such as ETs and routine care of ventilator circuits, are potential sources of infectious material.
- Avoiding ET intubation and using noninvasive mechanical ventilation have been shown to lower the incidence of VAP.
- Ventilator circuits do not need to be changed unless they are nonfunctional or if they are visibly soiled with secretions or blood.
- Including a routine of daily sedative infusion interruption in ventilator bundles can lead to a reduction in the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation and length of stay in the ICU and therefore reduce the risk for VAP.
