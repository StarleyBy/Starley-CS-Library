#### **LEARNING OBJECTIVES**

On completion of this chapter, the reader will be able to do the following:

- 1. Identify ventilator variables (e.g., target variable, trigger variable) and ventilator parameters and their values (e.g., peak inspiratory pressure, plateau pressure) using pressure, flow, and volume scalars generated with various modes of mechanical
- 2. Identify ventilator variables and ventilator parameters and their values from flow-volume and pressure-volume loops.
- 3. Use ventilator scalars and loops to detect changes in lung compliance and airway resistance, inappropriate sensitivity settings, inadequate inspiratory flow, autopositive endexpiratory pressure (auto-PEEP), leaks in the ventilator circuit, active exhalation during pressure support ventilation, and an
- inspiratory pressure overshoot during pressure support
- 4. Describe how changes in airway resistance and lung compliance affect scalars and loops during volume-targeted and pressuretargeted ventilation when airway resistance increases and lung compliance decreases.
- 5. Recognize periods of patient-ventilator asynchrony using scalars and loons
- 6. Determine the presence of auto-PEEP using ventilator graphics.
- Explain the phases of ventilation during airway pressure release ventilation using pressure and flow scalars.
- Describe the relationship between airway and esophageal pressure changes using ventilator graphics.

odern mechanical ventilators (e.g., Dräger v500 [Dräger Medical Inc., Telford, PA], CareFusion AVEA [Care-Fusion, Viasys Corp, San Diego, CA, Maquet Servo-i [Maquet Inc. Wayne, NJ], Puritan Bennett 840 [Covidien-Nellcor and Puritan Bennett, Boulder, CO], and Hamilton G5 [Hamilton Medical, Bonzduz, Switzerland]) incorporate graphic displays into their ventilator interfaces to provide instantaneous displays of pressure, flow, and volume. These graphic displays allow clinicians to obtain real-time measurements of the patient-ventilator interaction, which can provide insight into a patient's mechanics of breathing. Thus ventilator graphics offer valuable information for clinicians making adjustments to ventilator settings.<sup>1-3</sup>

Becoming proficient in the use of ventilator graphics typically requires dedicated time and practice. Once this skill is mastered, however, it can greatly enhance a clinician's ability to assess patient-ventilator interactions and improve patient care. Indeed, ventilator graphics can alert the clinician to abnormalities even before clinical signs are obvious and provide a graphic record of the pathophysiological changes that can lead to patient-ventilator asynchrony and respiratory distress.

Proprietary software programs offered by the ventilator manufacturers allow for flow, pressure, and volume measurements to be displayed as different types of waveforms. The term scalar is used to specify the flow, pressure, and volume waveforms that are graphed relative to time (i.e., pressure, flow, and volume scalars).<sup>5</sup> Basically, six shapes (waveforms) are produced with scalars during mechanical ventilation (Fig. 9.1 and Box 9.1)<sup>4-6</sup> The term loop is used to describe a graph of two variables plotted on the x and y coordinates, such as pressure-volume and flow-volume loops (these are discussed later in the chapter).

Fig. 9.1 Examples of waveforms for pressure, volume, and flow. Pressure waveforms are usually the rectangular or rising exponential (similar to an ascending ramp) type. Volume waveforms are usually the ascending ramp or sinusoidal type. Flow waveforms can take various forms; the rectangular, ramp (ascending or descending), sinusoidal, and decaying exponential waveforms are seen most often.

#### RELATIONSHIP OF FLOW, PRESSURE, VOLUME, **AND TIME**

Flow, pressure, volume, and time must be determined to produce the various waveforms and loops. The following principles explain the basic interrelationship of volume, pressure, flow, and time as they are used to create a waveform display:

- 1. The flow of gas into the lungs depends on the difference between the pressure from the power source (the ventilator) and the pressure inside the lungs. The greater the pressure gradient, the higher is the flow of gas, and the faster the lungs fill. Flow is measured as a volume change per unit of time, where time is the inspiratory time (Flow =  $V/T_I$ ).
- 2. The amount of pressure ( $\Delta P$ ) required to inflate the lungs depends on the patient's lung compliance and airway resistance. If the lungs are compliant and easy to inflate, relatively low pressures are required. If the lungs are stiff (low compliance), considerably higher pressures are required to inflate them  $(\Delta P = \Delta V/C_L)$ . For airway resistance, the most important factor affecting the degree of resistance is the diameter of the airways (or more specifically the radius according to Poiseuille's law). Airway resistance decreases as the diameter of the airway increases, resulting in an increased flow. Conversely, airway resistance increases as the diameter of the airway is reduced, causing a decreased flow (Key Point 9.1). Note that the ventilator's microprocessor can calculate both compliance and resistance using the measured data.

**Key Point 9.1** The amount of pressure ( $\Delta P$ ) required to inflate the lungs depends on the patient's lung compliance and airway resistance.

3. The volume (V) delivered depends on the amount of flow and inspiratory time  $(T_I)$   $(V = Flow \times T_I)$ .

#### A CLOSER LOOK AT SCALARS, CURVES, AND **LOOPS**

#### **Scalars**

Fig. 9.2 shows a typical set of scalars for volume-controlled continuous mandatory ventilation (VC-CMV). Note the directional arrows indicating the movement of flow into the lungs and the corresponding rise in airway pressure and resulting delivered volume. Also, notice that flow rises to its peak value and remains constant throughout inspiration.

Fig. 9.3 presents a closer look at a flow scalar. At point A, the inspiratory valve opens, allowing gas flow into the lungs. Keep in mind that this is also the point at which expiration ends. Flow rises quickly to point B, which is the peak inspiratory flow set on the control panel of the ventilator. What is the inspiratory flow setting in this example? At point C, inspiratory flow delivery stops. Has an inspiratory pause been set on the ventilator? What is the length of T<sub>I</sub>? What is the flow during the pause period?

In this example, as the expiratory valve opens at point D, gas leaves the patient and the ventilator circuit and passes through the ventilator's expiratory valve. Flow during exhalation is graphed below the baseline, as specified by the software program. Look at the expiratory flow curve. What is the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR)?\*

Continue to follow the expiratory flow curve. Note that at point E, expiratory flow ends; however, the total expiratory time (T<sub>E</sub>) lasts from point D to point F, and the  $T_E$  continues until the next

<sup>\*</sup>PEFR is 80 L/min. (Even though the graph indicates minus [-] 80 L/min, the value is read without the minus sign.)

inspiration begins (point *F*). How long is the  $T_E$ ? How much of the  $T_E$  is represented by a period of no gas flow?

continuous mandatory ventilation (PC-CMV) breath? (Hint: Look at the contour of the pressure scalar.)

Scalars also can be used to identify how a ventilator breath is initiated (i.e., time triggered or patient triggered). In Fig. 9.5 arrow A indicates a time-triggered breath and arrow B shows a patient-triggered breath. Notice that for breath B there is a slight drop in baseline pressure, indicating a patient effort. Can you determine whether this is a PC or VC breath? (Hint: Look at the flow scalar.) Additional information about PC versus VC breaths is presented in the following section on the comparison of pressure-controlled ventilation and volume-controlled ventilation.

As described in Chapter 5, intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) is a mode of ventilation that allows spontaneous breaths interspersed with mandatory breaths. Fig. 9.6 shows an example of a VC-IMV breath. Notice the minimal rise in pressure and tidal volume  $(V_T)$  for each spontaneous breath and the contour

 $<sup>^{\</sup>dagger}T_E=1.5$  seconds. 1.5 to 2.25 seconds (0.75-second total) is the interval during exhalation when no more gas leaves the patient.

difference in flow, pressure, and volume between the mandatory and spontaneous breaths. The elevated baseline pressure (see the *arrow* on the pressure scalar) indicates that the patient is receiving positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).

During PC-CMV, the flow and pressure patterns differ from those of VC-CMV breaths. As shown in Fig. 9.7, the flow pattern for PC-CMV is decelerating with a constant (square) pressure pattern. PC-CMV breaths always generate a decelerating flow pattern, whereas the flow pattern for VC-CMV can be changed from square to decelerating. Notice also the change in peak flow that occurs with changes in patient demand during PC-CMV (dashed line).

Mandatory pressure-targeted breaths can also be delivered with PC-IMV as shown in Fig. 9.8. Compare the difference in the flow and pressure scalars for the mandatory breaths and spontaneous breaths in this graphic with those in Fig. 9.6. The spontaneous breaths have a flow and pressure pattern typically associated with a pressure-targeted breath and are representative of a pressure support breath.

### Comparison of Pressure-Controlled Ventilation and Volume-Controlled Ventilation

When pressure and volume breaths are compared, the pressure and flow curves demonstrate the most distinct differences. Volume-controlled ventilation with constant flow produces a rectangular flow curve, which can be changed by selecting a different flow waveform.

During pressure-controlled ventilation, the flow waveform is a descending curve that varies with both lung characteristics and patient flow demand; therefore it is referred to as a *continuously variable decelerating waveform* (Key Point 9.2).

**Key Point 9.2** Volume-controlled ventilation with constant flow produces a rectangular flow curve, which can be changed by selecting a different flow waveform. During pressure-controlled ventilation the flow waveform is a descending curve that varies with both lung characteristics and patient flow demand.

During volume-controlled ventilation, the pressure scalar resembles an ascending ramp, or a *rising exponential curve*. During pressure-controlled ventilation, it is rectangular, assuming  $T_{\rm I}$  is long enough. (See the section on monitoring pulmonary mechanics for additional information.)

#### **Determining the Mode of Ventilation**

Scalars can also be used to identify the mode of ventilation being used. By carefully examining the pressure and flow scalars, it is possible to determine whether mandatory, spontaneous, or IMV is being used. Fig. 9.9 illustrates the flow, pressure, and volume scalars for mandatory and spontaneous breaths during IMV. Fig. 9.10 also demonstrates flow, pressure, and volume scalars during IMV; however, careful examination of the spontaneous breaths shows that the spontaneous breaths are not being pressure supported. (Case Study 9.1 provides an example illustrating how ventilator graphics can be used to identify the mode of ventilation being used.)

#### **Components of the Pressure-Volume Loop**

Pressure-volume (P-V) loops can be used to monitor changes in lung compliance ( $C_L = \Delta V/\Delta P$ ) and airway resistance. Fig. 9.11 shows a typical P-V loop generated during a positive pressure

![](_page_4_Figure_3.jpeg)

Fig. 9.7 Flow, pressure, and volume. Scalars seen during pressure-controlled continuous mandatory ventilation (PC-CMV).

breath. This breath is time triggered by the ventilator rather than patient triggered. It is important to recognize that the P-V loop is drawn in a counterclockwise direction when a ventilator breath is delivered. Notice also that the inspiratory and expiratory curves are not perfect arcs. The maximum pressure shown on the x axis is the peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), and the maximum volume reached on the y axis is the  $V_T$ .

Fig. 9.12 provides additional information regarding pressure gradients that can be determined using a P-V loop. The *solid line* of the loop in Fig. 9.13 represents pressure at the airway opening ( $P_{awo}$ ) during a  $V_T$ . The *dashed line* represents the static P-V line, which reflects the alveolar pressure ( $P_{alv}$ ) under no-flow conditions. The transairway pressure ( $P_{TA}$ ), or flow-resistive pressure, is the difference between the  $P_{alv}$  and  $P_{awo}$ .  $P_{TA}$  is represented by a *double-headed arrow* in this figure. Try to determine the values for PIP,  $V_T$ ,  $P_{TA}$ , and peak  $P_{alv}$  for the P-V loop shown in Fig. 9.12.

![](_page_4_Figure_7.jpeg)

#### Spontaneous Breaths and Pressure-Volume Loops

The clinician can learn to distinguish mandatory breaths from spontaneous breaths by observing the way the P-V loop is generated during breath delivery. When a patient makes a spontaneous inspiration, the P-V loop tracks in a clockwise fashion (Fig. 9.13). This is the reverse of a positive pressure breath, which creates a counterclockwise tracing (as shown in Fig. 9.11).

Now look at Fig. 9.14, which shows the P-V loop for a patient-triggered mandatory breath. When the patient breathes in spontaneously, the curve moves to the left (clockwise), reflecting the patient's effort. As the positive pressure from the ventilator is triggered, the curve crosses to the right and is traced in a counterclockwise fashion, which indicates that the machine is doing the work.

#### **Components of the Flow-Volume Loop**

Fig. 9.15 illustrates a typical flow-volume (F-V) loop recorded during a positive pressure breath. Inspiratory flow appears above the baseline, and expiratory flow is below the baseline. (NOTE: This is the reverse of the way F-V loops are usually reported for spirometry obtained during a standard laboratory pulmonary function test.) PEFR is the highest value on the expiratory flow curve. What is the PEFR in Fig. 9.15? What type of flow waveform is the ventilator delivering? What is the set inspiratory flow?\*

#### **Summary: Normal Scalars, Loops, and Curves**

With the diagnostic use of scalars, P-V, and F-V loops, several key points should be reiterated:

 Scalars can be used to identify the phases and characteristics of mechanical ventilatory breaths including PIP, PEEP, peak flow,

<sup>\*</sup>PEFR is approximately 70 L per minute (LPM), flow pattern is square, and inspiratory flow is approximately 55 LPM.

#### **USING GRAPHICS TO MONITOR PULMONARY MECHANICS**

Most intensive care unit (ICU) ventilators have the capability of measuring and displaying digital calculations of pulmonary compliance and airway resistance. Fig. 9.16 illustrates the flow, pressure, and volume scalars obtained during an inspiratory pause with a patient on VC-CMV.

Look first at the inspiratory portion of the pressure-time curve. Notice that the baseline pressure is 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, indicating that 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O of PEEP is being used. (It is important to recognize that although the baseline pressure is positive, the flow and volume curves start from a zero baseline and end at a zero baseline.) Now observe the flow scalar during the inspiratory pause. Compare the flow and volume scalars at the same moment in time. Notice that when no flow occurs, there is no volume delivery. The volume curve also looks as if it has a pause, or plateau (Key Point 9.3).

P-V loops can be used to assess changes in pulmonary mechanics. In Fig. 9.17, line AB (peak Palv) represents the pressurevolume relationship of the normal lung under static (no-flow) conditions; that is, it is the Palv during static conditions. C represents the elastic component of the lungs and chest wall (see Fig. 9.17). Triangle ABE represents the amount of mechanical work required to overcome the elastic resistance of the lungs and

**Key Point 9.3** When flow drops to zero at the end of inspiration, an inspiratory pause is present. When flow is zero, the pressure gradient between the ventilator and the patient's lungs is the same.

**Fig. 9.17** P-V loop for a normal lung. Line AB represents compliance or the pressure-volume relation of the lung under static (no flow) conditions. Curve ACB is inspiration. Curve BDA is expiration. Blue shaded area ABE denotes work to overcome the elastic resistance of the lungs alone. Cross-hatched area ACB represents work performed to overcome nonelastic airflow resistance during inspiration. Area ABD represents airflow resistance during exhalation. The sum of the latter two areas represents the resistive work of breathing in one breath. Note that work is not performed during a normal exhalation.  $P_{A}$ , Alveolar pressure.

chest wall. For a given amount of pressure applied to the lungs, a certain volume results. When flow is present, the direct (*straight-line*) relationship no longer exists; rather, as seen in previous P-V loops, the line curves during inspiration and expiration.

A certain amount of pressure is required during inhalation (see curve ACB in Fig. 9.17 and exhalation (curve BDA) to overcome the resistance of the airways and the tissues. These curves represent the nonelastic (frictional) forces opposing ventilation. Force (pressure) is applied to the lung by the action of the ventilator, but a slight lag time elapses before the volume actually increases. The area between curves ACB (the inspiratory curve) and ADB (the expiratory curve) is the result of hysteresis (Box 9.2). For any given lung volume, the elastic recoil in the lungs is less during exhalation than during inhalation.

The total mechanical work of breathing (WOB) is the sum of triangle *ABE* and curve *ACB*. Recall from physics that work equals

### BOX **9.2** Hysteresis

*Hysteresis* can be thought of as a lagging of one of two associated phenomena; that is, two associated phenomena fail to coincide or occur simultaneously. An example of hysteresis is the difference between the inspiratory and expiratory curves in a pressure-volume loop for the lungs, as shown in Fig. 9.12.

force times distance. (In respiratory physiology, force is expressed as pressure and distance is expressed as volume.) In the lungs this translates to WOB, which approximately equals the pressure required to ventilate the lungs times the volume the lungs accumulate (WOB = P  $\times$  V). The inspiratory work resulting from airway resistance (Raw) and partly from tissue resistance is curve ACB. The expiratory work is represented by curve ADB. Chapter 10 provides more information on the monitoring of WOB; it also reviews the pressure-time product and the use of transdiaphragmatic pressure monitoring as a technique for estimating WOB.  $^{24}$ 

During positive pressure ventilation for less compliant (stiffer) lungs, greater pressure is required to achieve a given volume. The P-V loop therefore tends to flatten (Fig. 9.18). Examples of lung conditions demonstrating reduced compliance include fibrotic diseases of the lung and conditions that flood the alveoli with fluids (e.g., pulmonary edema, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]). Reduced compliance is also seen in conditions in which the alveoli are deflated (e.g., atelectasis). It is important to understand that as compliance decreases, airway pressure increases, but volume delivery remains constant during volume-targeted ventilation.

Compared with volume-targeted ventilation, lung volume decreases, whereas pressure remains at the preset level during a pressure-targeted breath as compliance changes (Fig. 9.19).

Pressure-volume curves can also reflect changes in airway resistance. Notice in the P-V curve in Fig. 9.17, the *dashed line* dividing the curve into an inspiratory and expiratory component. The width of each component reflects the resistive forces during the respective phase of ventilation. Now compare the width of the P-V curve shown in Fig. 9.20 with that of a P-V curve with normal resistance (see Fig. 9.17). Note how the width of the curve increases but the compliance (*slope of the isoflow line*) remains normal.

Flow-volume loops are routinely used in a pulmonary function laboratory to assess changes in airway resistance. Fig. 9.21 illustrates one of the most valuable uses of the F-V loop, evaluating  $R_{\rm aw}$ . Loop A in Fig. 9.21 reflects normal  $R_{\rm aw}$  during volume

Note the increased nonelastic inspiratory and expiratory work (widening of the loop) and the shift of the dynamic compliance curve (P-V loop) upward and to the left. PIP, Peak inspiratory pressure.

ventilation with a constant flow and a normal compliance. Loops B and C show the effects of increasing  $R_{aw}$ . The inspiratory F-V curve is not significantly affected because the ventilator is set to deliver a constant flow (50 L/min) and volume (about 530 mL). However, PEFR progressively decreases as  $R_{aw}$  increases.

A reduction in PEFR is most often associated with airway obstruction (e.g., secretions and bronchospasm). Fig. 9.22 shows examples of F-V curves that would be obtained in patients with increased airway resistance, such as in a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Note the scooped-out appearance of the expiratory curve.

The F-V loops are helpful for evaluating a patient's response to bronchodilator therapy. Fig. 9.23 shows two flow-volume loops that reflect a patient's response to an aerosol treatment with a

 $\beta$ -adrenergic agent (e.g., albuterol). Note the improvement in expiratory flow. In the inner loop, a high expiratory flow can be seen at the start of expiration; this spike in flow is an artifact that reflects the release of gas trapped in the patient circuit during inspiration. The clinician can confirm this finding clinically by noting whether the corrugated tubing of the patient circuit "exhales" at the start of expiration.

# ASSESSING PATIENT-VENTILATOR ASYNCHRONY

Patient-ventilator asynchrony has been identified as one of the major issues in the management of patients on ventilation. As discussed in Chapter 18, asynchrony can be simply defined as a

![](_page_10_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 9.23** Two F-V loops produced during volume ventilation (constant flow waveform). The inner loop indicates increased airway resistance. The outer loop represents the patient's response to bronchodilator therapy. Note the improvement in expiratory flow. (NOTE: The high expiratory flow spike in the lower right corner of the inner loop results from gas decompression of the patient circuit. The initial expiratory flow spike is an artifact and represents release of the volume of gas trapped in the patient circuit at the beginning of the breath.) (Redrawn from Nilsestuen JO, Hargett K: Managing the patient-ventilator system using graphic analysis: an overview and introduction to Graphics Corner, Respir Care 41:1105—1122, 1996.)

mismatching between the patient's ventilatory drive and the response of the ventilator (Key Point 9.4). One type of asynchrony may occur at the onset of breath when the ventilator either delivers a premature breath or fails to recognize a patient effort. These situations are often referred to as trigger asynchrony (Fig. 9.24).

Trigger asynchrony can also be assessed using a P-V loop. Fig. 9.25A shows how the patient's inspiratory effort results in a considerable reduction in pressure below the PEEP level, creating the characteristic "fish tail" appearance. In Fig. 9.25B, trigger sensitivity has been adjusted, resulting in an improved trigger synchrony.

In Fig. 9.26 the arrows are pointing at a premature initiation of a breath independent of time or patient effort. This is often referred to as "autotriggering" and may be caused by too sensitive a trigger setting or a leak in the patient-ventilator circuit. A convenient method to differentiate an inappropriately set trigger sensitivity resulting in autotriggering from a leak is to observe the P-V and F-V tracings as shown in Fig. 9.27A and B.

Asynchrony can also occur when inspiratory flow from the ventilator does not match the patient's demands (i.e., flow asynchrony) or when the patient wants inspiration to end but the ventilator fails to cycle to exhalation (i.e., cycle asynchrony). Flow asynchrony can occur when the set flow rate, as in volume control ventilation, is insufficient to meet the patient's inspiratory demands. Notice the deflection (arrows) in the pressure scalar midway through inspiration, which creates an M-shaped pressure pattern associated with flow asynchrony (Fig. 9.28A). Remedies for flow asynchrony may include increasing the set flow in

Notice how the delivered flow rate changes between the first and second breaths in response to patient demand and flow asynchrony is avoided (see Fig. 9.28B).

#### **ADVANCED APPLICATIONS**

#### **Auto-PEEP and Air Trapping**

Auto-PEEP, sometimes referred to as *intrinsic PEEP* or *air trapping*, occurs when the patient does not complete exhalation before

![](_page_12_Figure_3.jpeg)

Fig. 9.30 Pressure and flow scalars demonstrating auto-PEEP. The *arrows* on the flow scalar show how flow does not return to baseline before the beginning of the next breath.

the onset of the next breath. Chapter 17 discussed the causes, occurrence, and remedy in detail. Fig. 9.30 indicates pressure and flow scalars for a patient demonstrating auto-PEEP.

Auto-PEEP initially can be observed on a P-V curve (Fig. 9.31A) and F-V loop (see Fig. 9.31B). The characteristic finding is the appearance of an incomplete exhalation with the expiratory portion of the loop not returning to baseline (arrow). It is interesting to note that an air leak would look similar to auto-PEEP.

#### **Titrating PEEP**

Several methods can be used to correctly set PEEP, including observing changes in P-V loops as PEEP levels are changed. As previously discussed, the slope of the isoflow line reflects lung-thorax

**Fig. 9.31** (A) Pressure-volume loop demonstrating the presence of auto-PEEP. (B) Flow—volume loop demonstrating the presence of auto-PEEP. Notice that the expiratory portion of the P-V loop and the F-V loop does not return to baseline.

compliance (see Fig. 9.19). As shown in Fig. 9.32, the slope of loop A is less than loop B, indicating that B represents a more compliant lung-thorax unit. Careful examination of these two curves shows that the curve B has a higher baseline (PEEP) level than curve A, demonstrating that the application of a higher PEEP level results in improved compliance.

#### **APRV Settings**

Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) is often used as lung recruitment mode of ventilation. One of the unique features of this mode is the inversing of high-pressure time to that of low pressure. Graphics can be useful in determining the setting of high-pressure and low-pressure times to create a period of static flow (see Chapter 23). Additionally, this mode by design is often configured to generate auto-PEEP (Fig. 9.33).

Upper and lower inflection points can be used to determine the high and low PEEP settings in APRV. Fig. 9.34 provides an example of how the upper and lower inflections points affect the pressure scalar and P-V loop for during APRV.

#### **Integrated Ventilator and Esophageal Graphics**

Several ventilators provide an auxiliary pressure monitoring port that can be connected to an esophageal catheter. Esophageal pressure measurements may be employed to determine transpulmonary pressure ( $P_{TP}$ ), which can then be used to set plateau and PEEP pressures. Additionally, esophageal manometry is often

**Fig. 9.33** Pressure and flow scalars for a patient receiving airway pressure release ventilation (APRV). Note the extended high-pressure time, short low-pressure period, and resulting auto-PEEP. The *arrows* are pointed to the period of constant pressure with zero flow. This period is thought to promote recruitment of low compliant alveolar units.

used in conjunction with scalars to further identify patient-ventilator asynchrony, as shown in Fig. 9.35.

#### Assessing Overdistention During Pressure-Controlled Ventilation

Determining the appropriate amount of pressure to use with PC-CMV or PC-IMV can often be a challenging procedure. Although  $V_{\rm T}$  delivery should be a primary criterion when setting the rise in pressure above baseline (PC + PEEP), often a secondary criterion can be used to avoid overdistention of the lung. Fig. 9.36 illustrates how ventilator graphics can be used to set ventilation parameters. Just as graphics can be used to set baseline pressures, they also can aid in determining the appropriate pressure level

**Fig. 9.36** Pressure-volume loop showing the effects of overdistention of the lung during pressure-controlled intermittent mandatory ventilation (PC-IMV).

when a pressure-controlled breath is delivered. Notice in Fig. 9.36 how at the end of inspiration the P-V loop flattens out, creating a pressure overshoot sometimes referred to as a "bird beak." Compare the  $V_T$  delivery at 15 cm  $H_2O$  of pressure with that of 18, and notice that there is little difference between the two pressure levels. When administering ventilation to a premature infant, keeping the peak pressures at a minimum is critical. In this case the PC level could be dropped to 15 with little effect on  $V_T$  delivery.

Fig. 9.37 was obtained from an adult patient receiving PC-CMV. Again, notice the pressure overshoot creating a "bird beak" appearance on the P-V loop. Point B represents the peak inspiratory pressure, and point A indicates the pressure at which  $V_T$  delivery is optimized in terms of pressure. Note the difference in lung compliance between the two pressure levels indicating that pulmonary mechanics would be optimized at 20 cm  $H_2O$  of ventilating pressure.

**Fig. 9.35** Flow, air pressure (P<sub>aw</sub>), and esophageal pressure (P<sub>es</sub>) in a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) during PSV. *Dotted lines* indicate the beginning of an inspiratory effort that triggers ventilator gas flow. *Black arrows* in the P<sub>es</sub> curve indicate patient efforts that did not trigger ventilatory flow. Note the time delay between the beginning of the effort and ventilator triggering. Ineffective efforts occur during both mechanical inspiration and expiration. During inspiration, the *flow scalar* can be used to identify ineffective patient efforts and a rise in the inspiratory flow. During expiration, ineffective efforts are identified by *open arrows* showing a small convex shape in the flow curve. Note how no apparent change occurs in P<sub>aw</sub>.

# Inspiratory Rise Time Control: Sloping or Ramping

A pressure breath produces a high flow at the beginning of inspiration. With small-diameter endotracheal tubes (i.e., increased  $R_{aw}$ ), the high flow through the narrow opening creates turbulence. As a result, a pressure overshoot can occur at the beginning of the pressure curve before the pressure adjusts to the set value.

If the flow and pressure delivery are tapered at the start of inspiration, the waveform can be adjusted to reduce this overshoot. Most current acute care ventilators have a function that can taper the flow during pressure ventilation. When tapering is used, the pressure curve may no longer be constant but may be tapered at the beginning of the breath.

Inspiratory flow delivery during PC-CMV can therefore be adjusted with an inspiratory rise time control, also called a *slope control* (Fig. 9.38).

# Flow Cycling During Pressure Support Ventilation

The normal flow-cycling mechanism of pressure support ventilation (PSV) is discussed in Chapters 3 and 5. Flow cycling occurs when the ventilator detects a decreasing flow, which represents the end of inspiration. The ventilator's software determines the point at which flow cycling occurs; in most ventilators this point is a percentage of the peak flow measured during inspiration.

Unfortunately, no single flow cycle percentage is ideal for all patients. Patients with COPD or increased  $R_{\rm aw}$  have a slower flow rate drop-off during inspiration with pressure ventilation than do patients with normal  $R_{\rm aw}.$  Because flow does not drop normally, patients with COPD are more comfortable with a higher flow cycle percentage (e.g., 40%). The clinician can determine the appropriate cycling criterion by evaluating the P-T curve during PSV. If an active rise in pressure occurs at end inspiration, the flow cycle percentage may be increased to reduce the amount of expiratory work the patient must perform.

The graphics in Fig. 9.39 show two flow cycle percentages. What is the peak flow in A? What is the flow value where inspiratory flow ends? What is the approximate flow cycle percentage?\* What is the peak flow in B? What is the flow value at which inspiratory flow ends? What is the approximate flow cycle percentage in B?

#### Case Study 9.2

A patient receiving PC-CMV demonstrates auto-PEEP on several breaths on the flow scalar (see arrow in Fig. 9.40, A). The therapist recommends a change in the inspiratory time setting to increase expiratory time. After 5 minutes on the new settings the following flow scalar was seen (see Fig. 9.40, B). Does the flow scalar show any evidence that the change reduced the level of auto-PEEP? Note that the expiratory flow now reaches the zero (see arrow) before the onset of the next breath, indicating that the change reduced the level of auto-PEEP.

## **SUMMARY**

- Ventilator graphics can be used to monitor ventilator function, evaluate a patient's response to the ventilator, and help the clinician adjust ventilator settings.
- It is important to comprehend how the ventilator measures, computes, and displays various parameters. Clinicians must also study actual ventilator graphics to fully understand the usefulness of this application.
- The scalars most often displayed on the ventilator screen are Pawo, flow, and V.
- Pressure and flow scalars can provide an effective tool for identifying the PIP, PEFR, and presence of leaks in the patient circuit and auto-PEEP during VC-CMV.
- The flow waveform during volume-targeted ventilation may be set as rectangular or descending, although it is by default a descending waveform in pressure-targeted ventilation.
- The pressure waveform varies with changes in static lung compliance (C<sub>S</sub>) and R<sub>aw</sub> during volume-targeted ventilation.

During pressure-targeted ventilation, changes in C<sub>8</sub> and R<sub>aw</sub> will affect the flow and volume waveforms.

- As lung characteristics deteriorate, the pressure delivered to a patient during PVS remains constant but the delivered volume may decrease.
- Pressure-volume loops can alert the clinician to changes in a patient's lung compliance, airway resistance, and work of breathing.
