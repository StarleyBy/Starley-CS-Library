he primary indication for hemodynamic monitoring is the management of critically ill patients who demonstrate evidence of compromised cardiovascular function.

Hemodynamic monitoring can therefore be used for the diagnosis and treatment of life-threatening conditions, such as shock, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, complicated myocardial infarction, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chest trauma, severe burn injury, severe dehydration, and after cardiac surgery.

Invasive hemodynamic monitoring requires the insertion of arterial and intracardiac catheters. Measurements typically include systemic arterial pressure, central venous pressure, pulmonary artery (PA) pressures, arterial and mixed venous blood gases, and cardiac output. Once obtained, these measurements can be used to calculate a series of derived variables, including oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) delivery (DO<sub>2</sub>), cardiac index (CI), stroke index (SI), vascular resistance, and cardiac work, which in turn can be used to better define abnormalities in cardiopulmonary function and ultimately guide therapeutic interventions.

The efficacy and potential risks of hemodynamic monitoring have been the subject of considerable debate. Although the frequency of using invasive techniques has significantly decreased with the introduction of noninvasive technology (e.g., pulse oximetry, cardiac ultrasound), most agree that the benefits outweigh the risks in critically ill patients who require continuous invasive hemodynamic monitoring. A consensus statement released in 2000 by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration suggested that more randomized clinical studies should be performed to better determine which patients would benefit most from hemodynamic monitoring.<sup>1</sup> Furthermore, it was agreed that all clinicians involved in hemodynamic monitoring should have a working knowledge of cardiovascular physiology and the technical problems most often encountered with this type of monitoring. This chapter presents information that will help clinicians avoid many of the technical problems associated with hemodynamic monitoring. It also provides a concise description of the measurements and derived variables that are most often used and explains how they can be applied to patient treatment.

#### **REVIEW OF CARDIOVASCULAR PRINCIPLES**

It is important to understand the sequence of mechanical events occurring during the cardiac cycle to appreciate fully the various factors that influence hemodynamic measurements. Fig. 11.1 is a Wiggers diagram that illustrates the pressure and volume events that occur in the left atrium, left ventricle, and aorta during a single heartbeat. A more detailed description of these events can be found in the references listed at the end of this chapter.<sup>2,3</sup>

#### **Factors Influencing Cardiac Output**

The outputs of the right and left ventricle are ultimately influenced by four main factors: heart rate, preload, contractility, and afterload. An individual's heart rate, which is simply the number of times the heart beats per minute, can vary considerably, depending on the patient's age and body habitus, core temperature, level of activity, and even psychological state. Indeed, heart rates can range from 50 to 200 beats per minute in a normal healthy adult.

The **preload**, which is typically defined as the filling pressure of the ventricle at the end of ventricular **diastole**, is estimated by measuring the end-diastolic pressures (EDPs). The amount of blood present in the ventricle at the end of ventricular diastole depends on the level of venous return and compliance of the ventricle. Ultimately, preload reflects the length of the ventricular muscle fibers and thus the ability of these fibers to generate

the necessary tension in the next ventricular contraction. This is a basic principle of cardiovascular physiology (sometimes called the Frank-Starling mechanism or length-tension relationship). This principle states in basic terms that the heart pumps what it receives. This relationship holds until one reaches relatively high ventricular volumes, when the muscle fibers are overstretched and unable to generate the necessary tension to elicit a contraction that will adequately eject the required stroke volume (SV). The end result at these higher ventricular volumes is ventricular dilation and failure.

The right ventricular end-diastolic pressure (RVEDP) is typically used as an indicator of the right ventricular preload, and the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) is used to estimate the left ventricular preload. Because both of these intracardiac pressures are difficult to measure in the critical care setting, clinicians rely on measurements of right atrial (RAP) or central venous pressure (CVP) and PA occlusion pressure (PAOP; which for practical purposes is equivalent to pulmonary capillary wedge pressure [PCWP]) to estimate the RVEDP and LVEDP, respectively. It is important to understand that CVP and PAOP can accurately reflect the RVEDP and LVEDP only when the former measurements are made at the end of ventricular diastole and if there is no evidence of valve dysfunction because they are registering **retrograde**\* pressures in the right and left atria.

Contractility, which is related to the force that the ventricle generates during each cardiac cycle, can be estimated using the ejection fraction, which is calculated as the ratio of the SV to the ventricular end-diastolic volume. For example, a 154-lb (70-kg) adult man typically has an SV of about 70 mL and an end-diastolic volume of about 140 mL. His ejection fraction would be 0.5 (70 mL/140 mL). Alternatively, contractility can be estimated by calculating the slope of ventricular pressure time interval during the initial period of contraction. This change in pressure relative to time (dP/dT) is thought to be a practical way of estimating the force of ventricular muscle contraction.

Afterload is usually defined as the impedance that the left and right ventricles must overcome to eject blood into the great vessels. Clinically, this impedance is better expressed as systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances. The systemic vascular resistance (SVR) is used to describe the afterload that the left ventricle must overcome to eject blood into the systemic circulation. The pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) reflects the afterload that the right ventricle must overcome to eject blood into the pulmonary circulation. Increases in afterload are generally associated with reductions in cardiac output, whereas decreases in afterload are associated with increases in cardiac output. For example, systemic hypertension and pulmonary hypertension lead to increases in SVR and PVR, respectively. In both cases, the cardiac output will be reduced. Administering a systemic vasodilator (e.g., nitroprusside) or a pulmonary vasodilator (e.g., tolazoline) will reduce the SVR and PVR, respectively, and result in an increase in cardiac output.

<sup>\*</sup>Retrograde means moving in the opposite direction. In this case, the catheter is measuring pressures downstream from the catheter tip. Measurements made at the end of diastole will occur when the atrioventricular valves are open. Any type of valve dysfunction that alters the path between the atria and the ventricles will therefore lead to erroneous measurements.

The transducer is connected to an amplifier and recording device and monitor. (The transducer pictured is an older model used here for easier visualization.)

#### **OBTAINING HEMODYNAMIC MEASUREMENTS**

Clinicians who perform hemodynamic monitoring must understand the physical and technical factors that can influence intravascular measurements and thus determine the likelihood of obtaining meaningful data. The following sections first describe how hemodynamic measurements are obtained and then discuss how various pathophysiological events can alter pressure, volume, and flow tracings.

#### **Hemodynamic Monitoring Systems**

Hemodynamic monitoring systems consist of equipment that detects small physiological signal (vascular pressure) changes and converts them to electrical impulses, which can then be amplified and recorded on a computer monitor or strip chart recorder. As shown in the invasive vascular monitoring system in Fig. 11.2, a catheter is inserted into a peripheral artery, a central vein, or PA. The catheter transmits pressure changes within the vessel or cardiac chamber through a hollow plastic tubing filled with a heparinized solution of saline to a transducer, which converts these fluid pressure changes to a digital signal for display.

A strain gauge pressure transducer (Fig. 11.3) uses an electrical circuit known as a *Wheatstone bridge*.<sup>3</sup> The operating principle for this type of device is fairly straightforward. Fluid enters the dome portion of the transducer by way of the fluid-filled plastic line (see Figs. 11.2 and 11.3). A diaphragm separates the fluid-filled compartment from the electronic portion of the transducer. Pressure transmitted to the fluid-filled dome portion of the transducer causes movement of the diaphragm, which alters the length of the wires of the Wheatstone bridge. Changes in the length of the wires result in changes in resistance to the current

![](_page_3_Picture_10.jpeg)

flow through the Wheatstone bridge (i.e., an increase in the length of the wires results in an increased electrical resistance; decrease in length results in a decrease in resistance to electron flow). Thus the pressure changes are directly proportional to the change in current flow through the circuit and inversely proportional to the resistance offered by the circuit.

#### Fluid Pressures

Fluid can exert pressure while it is in motion (hydrodynamic pressure) or while at a standstill (hydrostatic pressure). These pressures play integral roles when using hemodynamic monitoring systems. Two factors affect fluid-filled systems:

- 1. Dynamic pressure element
- 2. Static pressure head

The *dynamic pressure element* is pressure applied to fluid inside a system by fluid outside a system. It has to do with catheter position in relation to the flow of the blood within the vessel. For example, for an arterial line placed in a radial artery to accurately measure pressures that are the direct result of the work of the left heart, it must be placed with the end of the catheter facing the source of blood flow ("looking" upstream toward the left ventricle). A PA catheter, which measures pressures within a vessel (e.g., pulmonary capillaries) or left heart chamber, must be placed so that the tip of the catheter is facing downstream of the flow of blood (i.e., right ventricle) to estimate blood pressures filling the left side of the heart.

Static pressure head refers to the pressure placed on the transducer as related to the tip of the catheter. To measure pressure accurately, the transducer must be at the same height or level as the catheter tip. If the catheter tip is higher than the transducer, the monitor will read higher than the actual pressure as a result of the fluid "pushing" downstream (because of gravity) from the catheter tip to the transducer. If the catheter tip is placed below the level of the transducer, the fluid will flow away from the transducer toward the catheter tip and produce a reading lower than the actual pressure. The degree of error is about 1.86 mm Hg for each centimeter of distance from the reference point (e.g., if the transducer is 5 cm above the reference point, the corrected measurement should be 9.3 mm Hg [5  $\times$  1.86 = 9.3]). This adjustment can be avoided by positioning the transducer at the level of the midthoracic line of the patient—the epistatic line—to measure CVP accurately. This is about 5 cm behind the sternal angle (the angle of Louis). Once the epistatic line has been determined, it is important to zero-balance the transducer to this reference point. Zero-balancing the transducer references the transducer to atmospheric pressure, which is usually read as 0 mm Hg.

#### **Systemic Artery Catheterization**

Direct measurement of the systemic arterial pressure requires the insertion of a catheter into a peripheral artery, such as the radial, brachial, or femoral arteries. Note that the radial artery is the most commonly used site because of easy accessibility and collateral circulation to the hand from the ulnar artery. Either a percutaneous technique or a surgical cutdown technique can be used to insert the catheter. The percutaneous approach is most often used in the critical care setting; the surgical cutdown procedure is used when the percutaneous technique is unsuccessful.<sup>4,5</sup> Box 11.1 summarizes the recommended technique for inserting and maintaining a systemic arterial line (Key Point 11.1).

After the catheter has been positioned in the artery, a surgical dressing is applied and the catheter is secured with tape or sutured to the skin. Maintenance of the arterial line requires the use of a continuous pressurized flush mechanism to irrigate the catheter with a heparinized solution at a low flow (e.g., mL/h). The

#### Insertion and Maintenance of Arterial **Catheters**

- Aseptically assemble, flush, and test tubing and catheter.
- Perform a modified Allen test to ensure ulnar artery refill time of 5 to 10 seconds.
- Prepare and drape the area of insertion (sterile technique is
- If necessary, infiltrate the skin around the insertion site with a local anesthetic (e.g., lidocaine).
- Percutaneously insert the catheter at approximately 30degree angle. (If pulse is weak or otherwise inaccessible, surgical cutdown may be necessary.)
- Advance the catheter into the artery while holding the
- Remove the needle and secure the catheter.
- Attach tubing for drip solution and observe monitor for proper waveform.
- Frequently monitor:
  - Insertion site for signs of infection
  - Extremity distal to insertion site for adequate circulation
- Catheter should be removed if:
  - · There is clot formation as evidenced by difficulty with blood sampling or a persistently damped waveform
  - Extremity distal to insertion site becomes ischemic
  - Insertion site becomes infected

irrigating solution of 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl) containing 1 to 2 units of heparin per milliliter of normal saline (i.e., units of heparin/dL). Commercially available arterial line sets also have a rapid flush mechanism for quickly clearing the catheter. Prolonged or frequent flushing of the arterial line should be avoided because this can lead to the inadvertent administration of large amounts of flush volume to the patient. This latter point is a particularly important issue for neonatal and pediatric patients who weigh less than 44 lb (20 kg).

Daily inspection of the insertion site for signs of infection, ischemia, and bleeding is essential to avoid serious complications. The following factors can increase the risk for infections in patients with arterial lines:

- Insertion of the arterial line by surgical cutdown
- Prolonged cannulation (>4 days)
- Altered host defense

Distal ischemia should be suspected when pallor distal to the insertion site occurs, particularly if it is accompanied by pain and paresthesia in the affected limb. The most common cause of decreased perfusion is thrombus formation, which occludes the catheter tip. Other risk factors for acute distal ischemia include hypotension, severe peripheral vascular disease, and the use of vasopressor drugs.4,

Fever in any patient with an intravascular line should alert the clinician to infectious complications. The catheter is removed if there is evidence of local infection or the presence of distal ischemia. Difficulty withdrawing blood or persistence of damped

tracings should also alert the clinician to possible complications, such as the presence of air bubbles in the line or occlusion of the catheterized artery.

Bleeding can occur if the line becomes disconnected or is improperly handled. Hemorrhage is a distinct possibility if the line is left open; therefore the clinician should stabilize the catheterized site by taping the patient's arm to a board and placing it above the bed linen for easy observation. Another common problem encountered with the insertion of arterial lines is hematoma formation, which can develop if bleeding occurs under the skin during or immediately after the catheterization procedure. Hematoma typically occurs more often when the catheter is placed through a large-gauge needle.

#### **Central Venous Lines**

Catheters placed in the vena cava or right atria are generally called central venous lines. Although these lines are most often used to administer fluids, drugs, and nutritional solutions, they can also be used to monitor right heart pressures. During ventricular systole or atrial diastole, when the tricuspid valve is closed, the pressure measured in the right atrium or vena cava reflects the RAP. At the end of ventricular diastole and atrial systole, when the tricuspid valve is open, the pressure measured in the right atrium reflects the right ventricular pressure. Thus the CVP measured at the end of ventricular diastole can be used to monitor intravenous (IV) fluid administration and estimate the filling pressure or preload of the right ventricle (i.e., RVEDP).

CVP catheters are usually inserted percutaneously into a large central vein, such as the internal jugular, or peripherally through the medial basilic or lateral cephalic vein. Pressure measurements are usually performed during exhalation and when the patient is supine. The transducer is zeroed at the level of the right atrium. A normal value for CVP is 2 to 6 mm Hg.

The most common problems encountered with insertion of CVP catheters are pneumothorax, hemothorax, and vessel damage. Other potential complications include infection, thrombosis, and bleeding. Placement of the catheter usually is confirmed using radiography.

#### **Pulmonary Artery Catheterization**

Bedside catheterization of the right heart and PA became possible when Swan and colleagues introduced a balloon-tipped, flow-directed catheter in the early 1970s. The balloon-tipped, flow-directed catheter (also referred to as the Swan-Ganz catheter or pulmonary artery catheter) (Fig. 11.4) is a multiple-lumen catheter constructed of radiopaque polyvinylchloride. The standard adult catheter is 110 cm in length and is available in 7- and 8-French (Fr) sizes. Remember that the French size divided by  $\pi$ , or 3.14, equals the external diameter of the catheter in millimeters. Pediatric catheters are 60 cm in length and available in 4- and 5-Fr sizes. Both adult and pediatric catheters are marked at 10-cm increments. As with systemic arterial catheters, a pressurized flush solution must be run through the catheter at a rate of 1 to 5 mL/h (except when making pressure measurements) to prevent clot formation within the catheter's lumen.

Dual-lumen catheters have one lumen that connects to a balloon located near the tip of the catheter and a second lumen that runs the length of the catheter and terminates at a port at the distal end of the catheter. Triple-lumen catheters have an additional proximal port that terminates approximately 30 cm from the tip of the catheter, or at the level of the right atrium. This third lumen can be used to measure right atrial pressures or for administrating intravenous medications.

Thermodilution catheters incorporate a thermistor connector, which contains electrical wires that connect to a thermistor located approximately 1.5 inches (3 cm) from the tip of the catheter. When measuring cardiac output using the thermodilution technique, a bolus of saline or 5% dextrose (cold or room temperature) is injected through the catheter's third (proximal) lumen, which is positioned at the level of the right atrium. The cardiac output is calculated by integrating the change in temperature that is sensed by the thermistor near the tip of the catheter as the injected saline (or dextrose) solution mixes with the patient's pulmonary blood flow.

Pacing catheters with bands for atrial, ventricular, and atrioventricular (AV) cardiac pacing are also available. The bands,

Fiberoptic filaments used for mixed venous oxygen saturation  $(S\overline{v}O_2)$  monitoring and the balloon are also located at the tip. The thermistor bead is located 1.5 inches from the tip and is connected by a wire through the catheter to the connector for the thermodilution cardiac output computer. The proximal lumen located 30 cm back from the tip opens into the right atrium. Catheters are available for ventricular, atrial, or atrioventricular sequential pacing using either pacemaker bands positioned on the catheter or pacing leads, which are passed through the lumen. Ventricular bands or lumens are located 20 cm from the tip and atrial located 30 cm from the tip.

which are located approximately 20 cm from the tip of the catheter, have external leads that connect to a pacemaker.

As with CVP catheters, PA catheters can be inserted using a percutaneous approach or via surgical cutdown technique. The subclavian, internal jugular, external jugular, femoral, or antecubital veins are usually used for percutaneous insertion; surgical cutdown is often necessary when the subclavian or antecubital veins are used. The clinician must consider a number of potential complications when choosing an insertion site, including pneumothorax, arterial lacerations, venous thrombosis or phlebitis, and air embolism (Table 11.1).

Positioning the catheter can be accomplished by fluoroscopy or by monitoring the pressure tracings generated as the catheter is slowly advanced into the right side of the heart and PA.

Fluoroscopy is typically reserved for the catheterization laboratory, whereas continuous pressure monitoring with electrocardiography is routinely used in the critical care setting.

Fig. 11.5 shows a series of tracings obtained during PA catheter placement.<sup>8,9</sup> The catheter is introduced into the peripheral vein and slowly advanced until it enters the intrathoracic vessels (i.e., superior or inferior vena cava). When the catheter enters the intrathoracic vessels, venous pulse waveforms with characteristic respiratory fluctuations are recorded. If these respiratory fluctuations are absent, the results obtained will be erroneous. Loss of these respiratory fluctuations may indicate that the stopcock is closed between the catheter and pressure transducer. It can also occur if the catheter is kinked or a blood clot or air is present in the tubing. Once the catheter enters the intrathoracic vessels, the balloon is inflated with air so that it can be flow-directed by the blood through the right atrium and right ventricle into the PA. (NOTE: It is important to fully inflate the balloon to avoid endocardial or PA damage or induce ventricular arrhythmias.) Pediatric (4-5 Fr) catheters have a balloon volume of 0.8 mL; the balloon volume for adult (7-8 Fr) catheters is 1.5 mL. The catheter is slowly advanced until it wedges in a small PA.

As shown in Fig. 11.5, the wedged position can be easily identified because the PA occlusion pressure (PAOP) is characteristically lower than or equal to the PA diastolic pressure. An overdamped tracing (i.e., loss of a distinctive PAOP waveform) usually indicates a mechanical problem, such as the presence of an air bubble in the catheter tubing or protrusion of the balloon over the catheter tip. The mean PAOP may exceed the PA diastolic pressure in patients with mitral stenosis or mitral regurgitation. The PAOP can be identified by another means; when the catheter occludes a small PA, a continuous column of blood equilibrates between the left atrium and distal port of the catheter and the

pressure tracing will register a left atrial waveform (i.e., a, c, and v waves).

The catheter must be wedged in a zone 3 position in the lung to reflect the pulmonary venous pressure accurately. As illustrated in Fig. 11.6, if the catheter is positioned in zone 1 or zone 2, the alveolar pressure will exceed the pulmonary venous pressure and cause the vessels distal to the balloon to collapse (Table 11.2). The intravascular pressure reading will reflect the intravalveolar pressure rather than the pressure transmitted from the left atrium. This problem is accentuated by the application of positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) during mechanical ventilation (i.e., the alveolar pressure rises) or by hemorrhage when the pulmonary venous pressure is reduced. We discuss this problem in more detail later in this chapter (Key Point 11.2).

**Key Point** 11.2 The PA catheter must be wedged in a zone 3 position in the lung to reflect the pulmonary venous pressure accurately.

Table 11.3 lists the most common complications associated with right heart catheterization using a balloon-tipped, flow-directed catheter. Ventricular arrhythmias are fairly common during catheter insertion and are often self-limiting. Electrolyte disturbances, hypoxemia, and acidosis increase the risk for developing ventricular ectopy. Careful monitoring of the patient's

**Fig. 11.6** The position of the pulmonary artery (PA) catheter tip in relation to West's zone of the lung. For PA occlusion pressure to be a valid estimate of left heart pressures, a continuous column of blood needs to be present between the catheter tip and left atrium. In zones I and II, the pulmonary vessels may be partially or completely compressed by adjacent pulmonary alveolar pressures. (See text for additional information.)

# Risk Factors for Catheter-Associated Pulmonary Artery Rupture

- Age >60 years
- · Pulmonary hypertension
- · Improper balloon inflation
- · Improper catheter positioning
- Cardiopulmonary bypass surgery
- · Anticoagulation therapy

electrocardiogram during catheter placement can alert the clinician of the development of arrhythmias and reduce chances of provoking a potentially lethal complication such as ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation.

Box 11.2 lists the risk factors most often associated with PA infarction and rupture. Pulmonary artery infarction and rupture can be minimized by preventing thrombus development, which is accomplished by instilling a continuous flushed solution containing heparin. Pulmonary infarction and rupture can also be reduced by ensuring that the catheter balloon is deflated after wedge pressure measurements are made. Furthermore, it is important that the balloon is inflated for only 15 to 30 seconds when measuring the PAOP, particularly in patients with pulmonary hypertension. Balloon rupture is most often associated with prolonged duration of catheterization because the balloon will typically lose its elasticity with exposure to blood.

#### **INTERPRETATION OF HEMODYNAMIC PROFILES**

As mentioned previously, accurate interpretation of hemodynamic data requires a working knowledge of cardiovascular physiology. The hemodynamic profile ultimately focuses on factors that influence cardiac output: that is, heart rate, preload, contractility, and afterload.

The information in this section provides an overview of basic measurements and derived variables used in a standard hemodynamic profile. A list of excellent references related to the use of hemodynamic monitoring in critical care can be found at the end of this chapter for more detailed information about this area of clinical physiology.

#### **Heart Rate**

The resting heart rate of a healthy adult is typically 60 to 100 beats/min. The heart rates for neonates and infants are considerably higher. Although the resting heart rates for toddlers and adolescents are higher than for adults, the difference is minimal by the end of the first decade of life. Table 11.4 compares the mean and normal range for heart rate at various stages of life.

**Bradycardia** (heart rates <60 beats/min) is associated with increases in parasympathetic tone or decreases in sympathetic tone. **Tachycardia** (heart rates >100 beats/min) is associated with increases in sympathetic tone or decreases in parasympathetic tone.

The typical adult can maintain an adequate cardiac output at heart rates of 40 to 50 beats/min as long as SV increases proportionally. (Well-trained athletes are good examples of this concept.) Cardiac output will increase with heart rates up to about 200 to 220 beats/min, assuming that the patient responds normally to sympathoadrenal

stimulation.<sup>15</sup> Heart rates above 220 beats/min cause a decrease in cardiac output because diastolic filling time is reduced (i.e., decreased ventricular filling from reduced venous return).

#### **Systemic Arterial Pressure**

Fig. 11.7 illustrates a typical systemic arterial pressure tracing. Normal systemic arterial pressure (systolic/diastolic pressures) for adults range from 90 to 140 mm Hg/60 to 90 mm Hg with a normal mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 70 to 100 mm Hg.\* Fig. 11.8 shows the effect of age on systolic and diastolic pressure in adult subjects. It is generally accepted that systemic hypertension exists when the systolic arterial pressure is greater than 140 mm Hg and the diastolic pressure is greater than 90 mm Hg. Systemic hypotension is associated with systolic pressures less than 100 mm Hg and diastolic pressures less than 60 mm Hg. It is important to recognize that systemic arterial pressures in children, particularly very young children, are significantly different from those in adults (see Table 11.4). It

Although it may not be apparent, the systemic arterial pressure waveform will change in shape and magnitude, depending on the site of the measurement and the age of the patient. For example, systolic pressure increases as the site of measurement moves away from the heart. This effect is more obvious in young patients than in older patients. Diastolic pressure, on the other hand, is affected by vascular tone. An increase in diastolic pressure is associated with vasoconstriction, whereas a decrease in diastolic pressure is associated with vasodilation.

Changes in vascular tone can also cause the **incisura** to shift on the downslope of the arterial pressure tracing. <sup>16,17</sup> Vasodilation will cause it to shift closer to the baseline. The dicrotic notch also becomes less distinct as the site of measurement is moved farther from the heart. Indeed, it may not be present in arterial pressure tracing obtained from the femoral artery.

**Pulse pressure**, which is the difference between the systolic and diastolic pressures, is influenced primarily by the stroke volume and the arterial compliance. A wide pulse pressure is associated with an increased SV and a decreased arterial compliance; a

<sup>\*</sup>The MAP can be calculated in two ways. MAP = diastolic pressure + 1/3 (pulse pressure). Alternatively, MAP can be estimated using the formula (systolic pressure + 2[diastolic pressure])/3.

narrow pulse pressure is associated with a decreased SV and an increased arterial compliance.

#### **Right Atrial and Pulmonary Artery Pressures**

Proper positioning of the balloon flotation catheter allows for continuous monitoring of RAP and PA pressure and intermittent measurements of the PAOP. The RAP can be continuously monitored through the proximal lumen of a PA catheter or through a CVP

line. Pulmonary artery pressures can be monitored continuously through the distal lumen of a PA catheter. Left atrial and ventricular pressures can be measured intermittently during PAOP determinations. PAOP determinations represent retrograde pressure measurements that are obtained by inflating the balloon of the PA catheter until it occludes a small PA and wedges to block blood flow past the catheter tip. As mentioned previously, PAOP measured at the end of ventricular diastole reflects LVEDP because the mitral valve is open and the pressure in the left ventricle is transmitted backward into the pulmonary circulation to the catheter tip.

Direct measurements of right ventricular pressures are usually obtained only during insertion of the catheter. Identification of the right ventricular pressure waveform during continuous monitoring indicates that the catheter has slipped into the right ventricle. It should be repositioned by reinflating the balloon and allowing the blood flow to carry the catheter back into the PA. The balloon should be deflated after the catheter is repositioned in the PA. As mentioned, the balloon should be inflated for short periods when measuring PAOP.

#### **Atrial Pressures**

The RAP and left atrial pressure (LAP) are reported as mean values rather than as systolic and diastolic values. The RAP (more specifically CVP) normally ranges from 2 to 6 mm Hg; the LAP, as estimated from PAOP, ranges from 5 to 12 mm Hg. CVP and PAOP measurements are commonly used to determine overall fluid balance. A low CVP or PAOP suggests hypovolemia, whereas elevations of either of these pressures indicate hypervolemia or ventricular failure (Key Point 11.3).

The PAOP also plays an important role in assessment of pulmonary hydrostatic pressure in the formation of pulmonary edema. PAOP can help distinguish cardiogenic pulmonary edema (increased pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure) from non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (normal pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure) as occurs in ARDS. For example, the finding of bilateral infiltrates on chest radiographs coupled with a PAOP

**Key Point** 11.3 It is important to remember that CVP and PAOP reflect right and left ventricular pressures and volumes, respectively, only when the measurements are made at the end of ventricular diastole. Also, tricuspid and mitral valve disease (e.g., stenosis or regurgitation) can alter the retrograde transmission of pressure from the right ventricle to the right atrium (CVP) or from the left ventricle to the left atrium and ultimately the pulmonary circulation (PAOP).

greater than 25 mm Hg suggests the presence of cardiogenic pulmonary edema resulting from left-sided heart failure. This is in contrast to a finding of bilateral infiltrates on chest radiography with a normal PAOP, which would indicate the presence of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema resulting from damage to the alveolar-capillary membrane and suggests the presence of ARDS.

Box 11.3 lists several other conditions that can adversely affect RAP and PAOP values and waveforms. Some conditions affect the magnitude of the RAP and LAP, whereas other pathophysiological events alter the contour of these atrial waveforms.

#### **Pulmonary Artery Pressure**

The PA pressure waveform resembles the systemic arterial waveform discussed previously. However, the PA systolic and diastolic pressures are considerably lower than the systemic pressures (e.g., the PA systolic pressure for a healthy adult is 15—35 mm Hg and the PA diastolic pressure is 5—15 mm Hg). As does the systemic arterial pressure tracing, the PA pressure tracing shows a rapid rise to peak pressure during systole followed by a gradual tapering to the dicrotic notch (which in this case represents closure of the pulmonic valve) and eventual descent to the end-diastolic level.

The baseline of the PA pressure tracing shows characteristic respiratory fluctuations arising from changes in the intrathoracic pressure (Fig. 11.9).<sup>17</sup> With spontaneous breathing, the intrapleural pressure decreases during inspiration, causing the PA wave

(B) PA pressure response during mechanical ventilation. Notice that the PA pressure rises during inspiration and falls during expiration.

pattern to descend. Conversely, with spontaneous expiration, intrapleural pressure increases and the wave rises. With positive pressure breathing, the curve rises as intrapleural pressures become positive and falls during the expiratory phase. <sup>19</sup> The intrapleural pressure is the same for spontaneous (negative pressure) and positive pressure breathing at the end of expiration as long as PEEP is not used. For this reason, PA pressure, by convention, is measured at end expiration.

The mode of mechanical ventilation used can significantly affect measured hemodynamic parameters. <sup>19,20</sup> It has been shown that the lower mean inspiratory pressures present with IMV and pressure support ventilation (PSV) minimize the hemodynamic effects of positive intrathoracic pressure and help maintain right heart preload and cardiac output. <sup>20</sup> Pressure-controlled ventilation has about the same effect on hemodynamic values as does volume-controlled ventilation. However, pressure control inverse ratio ventilation (PC-IRV) decreases CI and thus DO<sub>2</sub>. <sup>20-23</sup>

Use of PEEP, either applied or inadvertent (e.g., auto-PEEP), at levels greater than 15 cm  $H_2O$ , can produce erroneously elevated pressure readings. The pressures in the thoracic circulation will rise when using PEEP therapy because of compression of the vessels by the increased lung volumes (increased functional residual capacity [FRC]). PAOP, which reflects preload of the left side of the heart, is a valuable parameter to monitor when performing an optimum PEEP study. If PAOP increases significantly during the study, it could indicate overinflation of the alveoli. Actual blood flow through the vessels might not be affected because the transmural pressure (the pressure difference between inside and outside a vessel) may not have actually decreased.

It is recommended that a patient not be taken off the ventilator, nor should PEEP be discontinued to measure PAOP, if it is desirable to assess cardiac filling during mechanical ventilation.<sup>20</sup> If the patient requires high levels of ventilatory support or PEEP or both, discontinuing this support for the time it would take to

measure PAOP accurately could produce hypoxemia and hypoventilation, from which the patient would recover slowly.

Some practitioners calculate an airway pressure transmission ratio (APTR) and correct the PAOP obtained during ventilation by this ratio. APTR is calculated by measuring the airway pressure change during a breath and the respiratory variation in PAOP. This procedure is performed with the catheter in the wedge position and evaluated over several breaths. Change in pressure ( $\Delta P$ ) equals the plateau pressure ( $P_{plat}$ ) minus the end-expiratory pressure (EEP). The respiratory-induced change in PAOP is the maximum mean PAOP minus the minimum mean PAOP (during a ventilator breath). The transmission ratio is the PAOP divided by the change in airway pressure. The resulting "true" PAOP is

$$PAOP = EEP \times (1 - PT_{PAOP} \times PAOP)$$

where PT<sub>PAOP</sub> is the PAOP pressure transmission ratio.<sup>20</sup>

It may not be appropriate to correct PAOP relative to the PEEP level because the practitioner does not know what effect lung zones and lung compliance actually have on PAOP. It may be prudent to trend the patient data rather than try to obtain an absolute value. It is interesting to note that right atrial pressure (i.e., CVP) may be a more accurate indicator of left ventricular end-diastolic volume than estimating APTR when a total PEEP of  $10~\rm cm~H_2O$  or greater is present.<sup>20</sup>

Fig. 11.10 shows both airway pressures and PA pressure during positive pressure breathing. Fig. 11.11 shows the effect of varying levels of PEEP on PA pressure measurements.

#### Case Study 11.1

#### **Evaluation of Pressure Tracing**

The following vascular pressure-time waveform is recorded on a patient on mechanical ventilation. Answer the following questions:

- 1. In what vessel or heart chamber is this catheter located?
- 2. What is the most accurate estimate of systolic and diastolic pressure?

Pathological conditions and pharmacological interventions can significantly affect PA pressure. Pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary embolus, and congestive heart failure are associated with increased PVR, which in turn leads to increased PA systolic pressure. In contrast, inhaled nitric oxide, which selectively dilates the pulmonary vasculature, decreases PVR and PA systolic pressure (Case Study 11.1).

#### **Cardiac Output**

Cardiac output  $(\dot{Q})$  is the volume of blood that is pumped by the heart per minute, and it is usually expressed in liters per minute (L/min) or milliliters per minute (mL/min). Cardiac output normally ranges from 4 to 8 L/min. It can be calculated by multiplying the heart rate by the SV. The SV is the volume of blood pumped by the heart per beat; it can be expressed in liters per beat (L/beat) or milliliters per beat (mL/beat). In many cases, the cardiac output and the SV may be reported relative to the person's body surface area (BSA), which can be easily obtained using a Dubois chart such as the one found in Fig. 6.1. This indexing technique allows the clinician to compare an individual's cardiac output or stroke output with that of normal healthy individuals of the same weight and height (BSA is calculated using these two anthropometric values).

CI is calculated by dividing the cardiac output by the BSA, or

$$CI = \frac{Cardiac\ Output}{BSA} = \frac{\dot{Q}}{BSA}$$

Similarly, stroke index (SI) is calculated by dividing SV by BSA, or

$$SI = \frac{SV}{BSA}$$

A normal CI for an adult is about 2.5 to 4.0 L/min/m<sup>2</sup>. The SI normally ranges from 35 to 55 mL/beat/m<sup>2</sup> (Case Study 11.2).

Decreases in either heart rate or SV can cause reductions in cardiac output. Decreases in the effective ventricular rate are usually associated with the following:

• A decrease in sympathetic tone as occurs with the use of  $\beta\text{-}adrenergic$  blockade or

![](_page_12_Picture_19.jpeg)

#### Case Study 11.2

#### Cardiac Index and Stroke Index

A patient has a BSA =  $1.7 \text{ m}^2$ , a heart rate of 110 beats/min, and  $\dot{Q}$  of 3 L/min. Calculate CI and SI. How do this patient's values compare with normal values?

- An increase in parasympathetic tone, and
- The presence of various types of bradyarrhythmias

Decreases in SV are associated with reduced preload or contractility of the heart or with an abnormally high afterload. Note that tachyarrhythmias associated with high heart rates can lead to decreases in ventricular filling, which can ultimately result in reductions in cardiac output.

In contrast, increases in cardiac output are associated with increases in heart rate or SV. Increases in heart rate associated with either an increase in sympathetic tone or a decrease in parasympathetic tone will lead to an increased cardiac output. Increases in SV are associated with increases in preload and contractility and with reductions in afterload.

#### Fick Principle and Cardiac Output Measurements

Most experts agree that the gold standard for determining cardiac output involves direct measurements of  $\mathrm{O}_2$  consumption and arterial and mixed venous  $\mathrm{O}_2$  contents. Once these measurements are made, cardiac output can be calculated using the Fick principle,

$$\dot{Q} \, = \, \dot{V}O_2/_{[(C_aO_2 - C\bar{v}O_2) \times 10]}$$

where  $\dot{Q}$  is cardiac output,  $\dot{V}O_2$  is  $O_2$  consumption,  $C_aO_2$  is the  $O_2$  content of arterial blood, and  $C\bar{v}O_2$  is the  $O_2$  content of mixed venous blood.

Oxygen consumption ( $\dot{V}O_2$ ) can be derived from measurements of the fractional concentration of inspired and expired  $O_2$  and minute ventilation. If these measurements are not available, many clinicians use an  $O_2$  consumption of 3.5 mL/kg/min as an estimate of the person's  $\dot{V}O_2$ . For example, a 154-lb (70-kg) individual would have a  $\dot{V}O_2$  of about 250 mL/min in the calculation of cardiac output. As you might expect, this practice may lead to erroneous results, particularly in critically ill patients.

Calculation of  $O_2$  content requires the measurement of  $O_2$  partial pressures and saturations for  $O_2$  of arterial and mixed venous blood. Arterial samples can be obtained from a peripheral artery; mixed venous blood samples can only be obtained during right heart catheterization by withdrawing blood from the PA (i.e., the distal port of the PA catheter). The  $O_2$  saturation of arterial blood  $(S_aO_2)$  is normally about 98%, and the arterial  $O_2$  content  $(C_aO_2)$  of a normal healthy individual is approximately 20 vol% (200 mL/L of whole blood). The mixed venous  $O_2$  saturation  $(S\bar{v}O_2)$  is normally about 75%, and the mixed venous  $O_2$  content  $(C\bar{v}O_2)$  is about 15 vol% (150 mL/L of whole blood). Critical Care Concept 11.1 provides a sample calculation of cardiac output using the Fick principle.

#### CRITICAL CARE CONCEPT 11.1

#### **Fick Principle**

A 70-kg man receiving volume-targeted mechanical ventilation at an  $F_1O_2$  of 0.35 has an  $O_2$  consumption of 300 mL/min, a  $C_aO_2$  of 18 vol%, and a  $C\overline{v}O_2$  of 13 vol%. What is his cardiac output  $(\dot{Q})$ ?

See Appendix A for the answer.

![](_page_13_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 11.12** Rebreathing circuit used by the Philips NM3 Monitor to estimate cardiac output using measurements of rebreathed carbon dioxide. (Courtesy Philips Respironics, Eindhoven, The Netherlands.)

#### **Indirect Fick Method**

A variation on this method of determining cardiac output is the indirect Fick method, which involves the collection and analysis of exhaled gas in place of arterial and mixed venous blood gas samples. With the indirect Fick method of calculating cardiac output, carbon dioxide production ( $\dot{V}O_2$ ) is used in place of  $\dot{V}O_2$ . Arterial and mixed venous  $O_2$  difference is replaced with arterial  $CO_2$  content and mixed venous  $CO_2$  content, respectively.  $\dot{V}O_2$  is obtained from continuous measurements of the fractional expired  $CO_2$  ( $F_ECO_2$ ) and minute ventilation ( $\dot{V}_E$ ). The arterial  $CO_2$  content is calculated from measurements of the partial pressure of mixed expired  $CO_2$  ( $P_ECO_2$ ), which are obtained while the patient intermittently rebreathes a fixed volume (at 10- to 15-second intervals). Cardiac output is therefore calculated as

$$\dot{\mathbf{Q}} = \dot{V} \ \mathbf{CO}_2 / (\mathbf{P}_{\bar{\mathbf{v}}} \mathbf{CO}_2 - \mathbf{P}_{\mathrm{ET}} \mathbf{CO}_2)$$

The application of CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring to estimate cardiac output is currently available with the NM3 monitoring system (Philips Respironics, Eindhoven, The Netherlands; see Fig. 10.12 and Fig. 11.12).

#### **Mixed Venous Oxygen Saturation**

If the  $\dot{V}O_2$  and cardiac output remain constant, the difference between the arterial  $O_2$  content and the mixed venous  $O_2$  content also remains constant. Mixed venous  $O_2$  values decline when arterial oxygenation is decreased. They also decrease when cardiac output is reduced. With a reduced cardiac output, more time is available for the extraction of  $O_2$  from blood delivered to the tissues. Reductions in  $S\bar{v}O_2$  are also associated with increases in metabolic rate in patients with limited cardiac output. Mixed venous  $O_2$  values can be higher than normal in patients with histotoxic hypoxia (e.g., cyanide poisoning) and in situations in which intrapulmonary shunting occurs (i.e., ventilation-perfusion mismatching).

With recent advances in fiberoptic reflectance oximetry, continuous recordings of  $S\bar{v}O_2$  can be obtained.<sup>23</sup> Reflectance oximetry technology has been incorporated into specialized balloon-flotation catheters that are used for right heart

#### Case Study 11.3

#### Application of the Fick Principle

A patient has a constant  $\dot{V}O_2$  of 350 mL/min. At 13:00 hours  $C_aO_2$  is 20 vol% and  $C\bar{v}O_2$  is 14 vol%. At 15:00 hours  $C_aO_2$  is 20 vol% and  $C\bar{v}O_2$  is 12 vol%. What is one possible cause in the drop in  $C\bar{v}O_2$ ?

Calculate the cardiac output for both times.

catheterization. Although the potential for this type of monitoring is promising, additional studies will be required to delineate more clearly the indications for its use in critical care (Case Study 11.3).

#### **Oxygen Delivery**

 $DO_2$  is the product of cardiac output and arterial  $O_2$  content. It represents the total amount of  $O_2$  that is carried in the blood to the tissues each minute. Under normal circumstances,  $DO_2$  is approximately 1000 mL/min or about 550 to 650 mL/min/m<sup>2</sup> (Key Point 11.4).<sup>24</sup>

**EXECUTE:**  $Key Point 11.4 DO_2$  represents the total amount of  $O_2$  that is carried in the blood to the tissues each minute.

 $\mathrm{DO}_2$  is increased in situations in which cardiac output or arterial  $\mathrm{O}_2$  content is elevated. A reduced  $\mathrm{DO}_2$  indicates a decrease in cardiac output or arterial  $\mathrm{O}_2$  content. For example,  $\mathrm{DO}_2$  is increased in hyperdynamic states (increased cardiac output) such as septic shock. Conversely,  $\mathrm{DO}_2$  is decreased following hemorrhage in which there is a decrease in arterial  $\mathrm{O}_2$  content.

#### **Shunt Fraction**

A *shunt* is defined as that portion of the cardiac output that does not participate in gas exchange with alveolar air (i.e., *perfusion without ventilation*). Shunts are usually identified as anatomical shunts, intrapulmonary shunts, and physiological shunts, with the latter being the sum of anatomical and intrapulmonary shunts.

Normal anatomical shunts exist because venous blood that would ideally return to the right side of the heart (deoxygenated blood) drains into vessels served by the left side of the heart (oxygenated blood). This venous admixture includes deoxygenated blood from bronchial veins, pleural veins, and Thebesian veins, and it typically only represents about 2% to 3% of the normal cardiac output. Abnormal anatomical shunts can occur when blood is allowed to bypass the pulmonary circulation and enter directly into the left atrium or left ventricle, as occurs with atrial and ventricular septal wall defects.

Intrapulmonary shunts occur when blood passes through pulmonary capillaries that are not ventilated. Shuntlike states can exist in either poorly ventilated alveolar units that are well perfused or in alveolar-capillary units if  $O_2$  diffusion is impaired. Intrapulmonary shunts can be caused by disorders such as atelectasis, pulmonary edema, pneumonia, pneumothorax, complete airway obstruction, consolidation of the lung, ARDS, and on rare occasions by arterial-to-venous fistulas.

The total shunt fraction or, more specifically, **physiological** shunt, can be determined by the following classic shunt equation:

$$\frac{\dot{Q}_S}{Q_T} = \frac{\left(C_c O_2 - C_a O_2\right)}{C_c O_2 - C \overline{v} O_2} \label{eq:QT}$$

where  $\dot{Q}_S$  is the shunted portion of the cardiac output,  $\dot{Q}_T$  is total cardiac output,  $C_cO_2$  is the content of  $O_2$  of the pulmonary end-capillary following oxygenation of the blood,  $C_aO_2$  is the arterial  $O_2$  content, and  $C\bar{v}O_2$  is the mixed venous  $O_2$  content (i.e., pulmonary capillary blood before oxygenation).  $C_cO_2$  is calculated based on the assumption that pulmonary end-capillary  $PO_2$  is the same as  $P_AO_2$ . Mixed venous blood can be obtained from a PA catheter. As discussed later in this text, calculation of shunt fraction can be useful in the differential diagnosis of hypoxemia.

#### **Vascular Resistance**

As mentioned earlier, the vascular resistance represents the impedance or opposition to blood flow offered by the systemic and pulmonary vascular beds, and it influences the force that the ventricular muscle must generate during cardiac contractions. Although SVR and PVR have been reported historically as dyne  $\times$  seconds  $\times$  cm $^{-5}$ , recent publications have tended to use the units of mm Hg/L/min. In this text, we use the units of dyne  $\times$  seconds  $\times$  cm $^{-5}$  for the sake of continuity.

Taking a simple way to approach the calculation of SVR or PVR (R in the following equation),  $\Delta P$  represents the pressure gradient across the vascular bed and cardiac output is the blood flow through the vascular bed, or

$$R \, = \frac{\Delta P}{\dot{Q}}$$

Thus SVR can be calculated as follows:

$$SVR \,=\, (\frac{[MAP-MRAP]}{SBF}) \times 80$$

where MAP is the mean aortic or arterial blood pressure, expressed in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), MRAP is the mean right atrial pressure (in mm Hg), and SBF is the systemic blood flow or cardiac output (in L/min). Multiplying the equation by 80 is routinely used by clinicians to convert the units of mm Hg/L/min to dyne  $\times$  second  $\times$  cm<sup>-5</sup>. Note that CVP may be substituted for MRAP. When CVP is used, the formula can be written as

$$SVR \,=\, (\frac{[MAP-CVP]}{\dot{Q}})\times 80$$

Similarly, PVR can be calculated as

$$PVR = (\frac{[MPAP - MLAP]}{PBF}) \times 80$$

where MPAP is the mean PA pressure, MLAP is the mean left atrial pressure (both measured in mm Hg), and PBF is the pulmonary blood flow or cardiac output (CO) (in L/min). In the critical care setting, the PAOP may be used instead of MLAP, and the formula becomes

$$PVR = \left(\frac{[MPAP - PAOP]}{C.O.}\right) \times 80$$

The normal SVR ranges from 900 to 1500 dyne  $\times$  seconds  $\times$  cm<sup>-5</sup>, and the PVR ranges from 100 to 250 dyne  $\times$  seconds  $\times$  cm<sup>-5</sup>. The two most important factors that influence vascular resistance are the caliber of the blood vessels and viscosity of the

blood. The SVR is therefore increased in left ventricular failure and hypovolemia arising from vasoconstriction caused by stimulation of the baroreceptor reflex.  $^{16}$ 

The SVR may also be increased if blood viscosity increases, as occurs in polycythemia. SVR decreases during systemic vasodilation, such as occurs with moderate hypoxemia or after the administration of systemic vasodilators such as nitroglycerin or hydralazine.<sup>20</sup>

The PVR increases during periods of alveolar hypoxia or in cases in which high intraalveolar pressures are generated, such as during positive pressure ventilation. A low cardiac output can increase PVR by causing derecruitment of pulmonary vessels. PVR is reduced by the administration of pulmonary vasodilator drugs such as tolazoline and prostacyclin.<sup>25</sup>

#### **Ejection Fraction**

The ejection fraction (EF) is a derived variable that provides an estimate of ventricular contractility. It is calculated by dividing the SV by the end-diastolic volume. The EF shows a positive correlation with the CI in most cases and is a valuable measurement in the prognosis of heart failure. Note that the correlation between EF and CI may be inaccurate in cases of mitral regurgitation. EF values of 0.5 to 0.7 are considered normal for healthy adults. EF values lower than 0.30 are associated with compromised cardiovascular function and imminent heart failure.

#### **Cardiac Work**

In physics, *work* is defined as the product of a force acting on an object to move it a certain distance. In calculations of **cardiac work**, or more specifically **stroke work**, the pressure generated by the heart during a ventricular contraction is used to quantify the amount of force developed; the SV represents the distance portion of the equation. The amount of work performed by each ventricle during the cardiac cycle is determined by applying the following formulas:

$$LVSW = ([MAP \times SV] \times 0.0136)$$

$$RVSW = ([MPAP \times SV] \times 0.0136)$$

where LVSW and RVSW are left ventricular stroke work and right ventricular stroke work, respectively; MAP is the mean arterial pressure; MPAP is the mean PA pressure; SV represents stroke volume; and 0.00136 is a factor to convert millimeters of mercury (mm Hg)-milliliters (mL) to gram-meters (g-m). In most clinical situations, stroke work measurements are indexed to BSA. Therefore the left ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI) and right ventricular stroke work index (RVSWI) are calculated as follows:

$$LVSWI = \frac{LSW}{BSA}$$
$$RVSWI = \frac{RSW}{BSA}$$

LSWI normally ranges from 40 to 60 g-m/m $^2$  (0.4–0.6 kg-m/m $^2$ ), and RSWI ranges are normally between 7 and 12 g-m/m $^2$  (0.07–0.12 kg-m/m $^2$ ).\* Conditions that increase the SV and/or

<sup>\*</sup>Alternative methods for calculation of LVSW and RVSW are LVSW = SV  $\times$  (BPsys – PAOP)  $\times$  0.0136; RVSW = SV (PAsys – CVP)  $\times$  0.0136, where BPsys is systolic blood pressure (systemic) and PAsys is PA systolic pressure.

mean pressure generated by the ventricles will increase the amount of work the ventricle must perform (Case Study 11.4).

#### Hemodynamic Monitoring: After Open-Heart Surgery

#### Case Study 11.7

#### **ICU** and Hemodynamic Assessment

A 72-year-old man is admitted to the ICU, after stabilization in the emergency department (ED), on a nasal cannula at 2 L/min. Arterial blood gases (ABGs) drawn in the ED revealed pH = 7.47,  $P_aCO_2 = 30$  mm Hg, and  $P_aO_2 = 31$  mm Hg. The patient was immediately placed on a nonrebreathing mask, and ABGs and vital signs were assessed, with the following results:

- pH = 7.48,  $P_aCO_2$  = 32 mm Hg,  $P_aO_2$  = 56 mm Hg
- f = 34 breaths/min, heart rate = 116 beats/min
- Blood pressure = 175/58 mm Hg
- The patient was placed on mechanical ventilatory support with the following settings:
  - $V_T = 850$  mL, VC-CMV with rate = 12 breaths/min
  - $F_1O_2 = 0.5$ ,  $PEEP = +10 \text{ cm } H_2O$

Hemodynamic monitoring, after successful insertion of a pulmonary artery catheter in the subclavian artery, revealed the following data:

 Cardiac output = 7.98 L/min, CI = 4.41 L/min/m<sup>2</sup>, HR = 81 beats/min

- BP (systolic) = 159 mm Hg, BP (diastolic) = 64 mm Hg, BP (mean) = 92 mm Hg
- PAP (systolic) = 52 mm Hg, PAP (diastolic) = 18 mm Hg, PAP (mean) = 33 mm Hg
- PAOP = 13 mm Hg, CVP (mean) = 12 mm Hg
- SV = 98.5 mL, SI = 54.4 mL/m<sup>2</sup>, SVR = 802 dynes  $\times$  cm  $\times$  s<sup>-5</sup>
- PVR = 201 dynes  $\times$  cm<sup>-5</sup>  $\times$  s
- Hemoglobin = 14.5 g, temperature =  $37^{\circ}$  C
- Arterial blood gases (ABGs): pH = 7.362, PO $_2$  = 80 mm Hg, PCO $_2$  = 46.2 mm Hg, HCO $_3^-$  = 26.5 mEq/L, S $_a$ O $_2$  = 95.2%
- Mixed venous blood gases: pH = 7.339, PO<sub>2</sub> = 40 mm Hg, PCO<sub>2</sub> = 50.3 mm Hg, HCO<sub>3</sub> = 27.4 mEq/L,  $S\bar{v}O_2$  = 71.2%
- $C_aO_2 = 18.5 \text{ vol\%}$ ,  $C\bar{v}O_2 = 13.8 \text{ vol\%}$ ,  $C(a-\bar{v})O_2 = 4.7 \text{ vol\%}$
- $O_2$  transport = 1476 mL/min,  $O_2$  consumption = 375 mL/min How would you interpret these findings?

- Hemodynamic monitoring can provide a window to observe the effects of various physiological and pharmacological interventions on cardiovascular function.
- The effective use of hemodynamic monitoring requires knowledge of the basic principles of cardiovascular physiology and an understanding of the physical and technical factors that can influence the measurement conditions.
- Cardiac output is primarily influenced by heart rate and ventricular preload, contractility, and afterload.
- CVP and PAOP can be used to assess right and left ventricular preload, respectively.
- Ejection fraction is a valuable clinical indicator of ventricular contractility.
- The SVR and PVR are used clinically to describe the afterload to the left and right ventricles, respectively.
- Positioning of a PA catheter can be accomplished by fluoroscopy or by monitoring the pressure tracing generated as the catheter is advanced into the right heart and PA.
- Accurate measurements of the PAOP require wedging of the PA catheter in the zone 3 portion of the pulmonary vasculature.

- Pulse pressure is the difference between the systolic and diastolic pressure and is influenced by the stroke volume and arterial compliance.
- Cardiac index and stroke index allow the clinician to compare an individual's cardiac output and stroke output with those of healthy individuals of the same weight and height.
- Cardiac index and ejection fraction are important variables used in determining the prognosis of heart failure.
- Cardiac work is primarily influenced by stroke volume and systolic arterial pressure.
- Calculation of O<sub>2</sub> contents requires the measurement of O<sub>2</sub> partial pressures and saturations in arterial and mixed venous blood.
- Oxygen delivery to the tissues is increased in situations in which the cardiac output and arterial  $\mathrm{O}_2$  content are elevated. It is typically decreased when either of these variables is reduced.
- SVR and PVR represent the impedance or opposition to blood flow offered by the systemic and pulmonary vascular beds, respectively. Vascular resistance influences the force that the ventricular muscle must generate during cardiac contractions.
- Cardiac work provides an estimate of the amount of force that must be generated by the ventricles to achieve a given stroke output.
