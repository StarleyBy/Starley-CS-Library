## **Graphics Exercises**

### **GRAPHING VENTILATOR WAVEFORMS**

This exercise is designed to help the reader understand graphic waveforms produced by a microprocessor-controlled ventilator. By performing these graphing exercises and calculations, the reader will also gain a better understanding of the interrelationship of flow, volume, pressure, and time waveforms generated during mechanical ventilation.

#### **Problem 1**

Assume you have a patient who is receiving ventilation using volume-controlled continuous mandatory ventilation (VC-CMV) set to deliver a constant flow of gas during inspiration until it reaches the volume ordered by the physician. You are given the following information about the patient's lung characteristics and ventilator parameters:

- Compliance (C) is 0.2 L/cm H<sub>2</sub>O
- Airway resistance (Raw) is 15 cm H<sub>2</sub>O/L/s
- Flow rate is constant at 40 L/min
- Ordered tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>) is 1 L (1000 mL)
- End-expiratory pressure is zero (no positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP])

Perform the following steps using the preceding information:

- Calculate the flow rate in L/s.
- Record under variable (Fig. C.1A) the flow at each quartersecond of time that will be present during inspiration. Graph the flow at quarter-second intervals (see Fig. C.1A).
- Calculate and graph the volume delivered at each quartersecond interval during inspiration: Volume (V) = Time (T) × Flow (see Fig. C.1B).

Note that the ordered  $V_T$  of 1 L (1000 mL) was delivered in about 1.5 seconds. A volume-cycled ventilator would stop the inspiratory phase at this point. For all graphs from this point on, calculations need to be made only for times up to 1.5 seconds.

- Using the volume, calculate and graph the alveolar pressure. Recall that  $C = \Delta V/\Delta P$ ;  $\Delta P = P_{alv} EEP$  and EEP = 0;  $P_{alv} = \Delta V/C$ . The volume is taken from the calculations of volume in step 3 for each quarter-second interval (see Fig. C.1C).
- Calculate and graph the transairway pressure  $(P_{TA})$ . Recall that  $R_{aw} = P_{TA}/Flow$ . Therefore  $P_{TA} = R_{aw} \times Flow$ ,  $P_{TA} = 15 \times 0.67 = 10$  cm  $H_2O$ . Both  $R_{aw}$  and flow have constant values.  $P_{TA}$  will have the same value for each quarter-second interval (see Fig. C.1D).
- Add the values of  $P_{alv}$  and  $P_{TA}$  to determine the airway opening pressure ( $P_{awo}$ ) at each quarter-second interval. Graph these

values. Note that at the zero point on the x and y axes, the  $P_{awo}$  will not go to zero. The pressure rises rapidly as the flow begins to go to the patient because the gas flow encounters the resistance of the circuit, the endotracheal tube (ET), and the patient's airways. The  $P_{awo}$  value just near zero on the x axis is approximately equal to the  $P_{TA}$  just to the right of the y axis (see Fig. C.1E).

- Compare the curves produced in the preceding exercise; the graph for flow has the same waveform as the graph for:
  - P<sub>alv</sub>
  - PIP
  - P<sub>TA</sub>

# CHANGES IN WAVEFORMS WITH CHANGES IN LUNG CHARACTERISTICS

#### **Ventilator Working Pressure**

A ventilator that can generate pressures that greatly exceed those reached at the upper airway can deliver any waveform pattern for flow, volume, or pressure. These waveforms do not change regardless of changes in lung characteristics. Some ventilators deliver pressures of 400 to 700 cm  $H_2O$ , far greater than what is needed for ventilation of the human lung (10–35 cm  $H_2O$ ).

The following sections discuss how pressure waveforms change during volume ventilation (constant flow) and how volume and flow waveforms change during pressure ventilation (constant pressure) with changes in lung characteristics.

### Constant-Flow Volume Ventilation With High Working Pressure

During volume ventilation (constant flow), the volume waveform increases linearly and volume delivery is constant. Inspiration is usually time cycled or volume cycled (Fig. C.2). As a patient's lungs become less compliant or  $R_{aw}$  increases, the pressure waveforms are affected; however, the volume and flow curves remain the same. Clinically, a decrease in compliance increases peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) and  $P_{plat}$  (Fig. C.3). An increase in  $R_{aw}$  also increases PIP, whereas alveolar pressure ( $P_{plat}$ ) remains fairly constant. The difference between the two ( $P_{TA}$ ) increases (Fig. C.4). The ventilator provides a constant volume, even with changes in lung characteristics, as long as the ventilator is time cycled or volume cycled. If it prematurely pressure cycles as a result of reaching the set pressure limit, volume decreases.

Using other types of flow waveforms produces changes similar to those seen for  $P_{plat},\ P_{TA},\ and\ P_{awo}.$  Reduced compliance increases PIP and  $P_{plat}.$  Increased  $R_{aw}$  increases  $P_{TA}.$

(A) Flow is constant at 0.5 L/s. (B) Volume increases at a constant rate during inspiration, achieving a tidal volume (V<sub>I</sub>) of 1 L. (C)  $P_{alv}$  increases at a constant rate, as does volume, to a maximum of 10 cm  $P_{alv}$  increases flow is constant,  $P_{TA}$  is constant; this assumes that resistance and flow do not change.

**Fig. C.3** (A) Flow is constant at 0.5 L/s.  $T_l=2$  seconds. The volume coming from the ventilator remains the same at 1 L even though compliance (C) is reduced.  $P_{alv}$  has doubled (20 cm  $H_20$ ) in this situation because compliance is half its previous value. The dashed line represents the curve for normal compliance (C = 0.1 L/cm  $H_20$ ), and the solid line represents the curve for reduced compliance (C = 0.05 L/cm  $H_20$ ). (B) Because flow and airway resistance ( $P_{alw}$ ) are constant, the pressure lost to the airways is constant ( $P_{TA}=1$  cm  $P_{TA}=1$ ).  $P_{TA}=1$  is the shaded area. The upper airway pressure is much higher than normal because compliance is reduced.  $P_{alw}=1$  Alveolar pressure;  $P_{TA}=1$ 0 upper airway pressure;  $P_{TA}=1$ 1 pressure lost to airways.

### Constant-Flow Volume Ventilation With Low Working Pressure

Under normal lung conditions, a constant-flow ventilator with low to moderate working pressure (40-120 cm  $H_2O$ ) creates a constant-flow waveform similar to that shown in Fig. C.5A.

When compliance is significantly reduced and resistance is increased, PIP rises and flow decreases during inspiration because of the decrease in pressure gradient between the ventilator and alveoli. When the driving mechanism no longer generates an adequate working pressure, the ventilator no longer provides a constant flow. This is not necessarily a disadvantage. The resulting modified descending ramp waveform may actually be more desirable for improving gas distribution in the lungs, but it can alter inspiratory time (T<sub>I</sub>) (see Fig. C.5B).

**Fig. C.4** Constant-flow ventilator. The following inspiratory curves are produced when airway resistance  $(R_{aw})$  is increased to 4 cm  $H_2O/L/s$  and compliance is normal  $(C=0.1\ L/cm\ H_2O)$ . (A) Pressure lost to the airways  $(P_{TA})$  is the product of flow and airway resistance (Flow  $\times$   $R_{aw}$ ). With an increase in  $R_{aw}$ ,  $P_{TA}$  increases to 2 cm  $H_2O$  (solid line) compared with normal at 1 cm  $H_2O$  (dashed line). (B) Upper airway pressure  $(P_{awo})$ , the sum of alveolar pressure  $(P_{alv})$  and  $P_{TA}$ , increases to a maximum of 12 cm  $H_2O$  because  $P_{TA}$  is increased (shaded area). The difference between the peak and plateau, or  $P_{alv}$ , increases.

**Fig. C.5** Inspiratory curves represent the changes in flow that can occur using constant flow in a ventilator with moderate to low pressure-generating capabilities. (A) Under normal conditions, flow is constant. (B) As compliance decreases and resistance increases significantly, flow decreases slightly. If the ventilator is volume cycled, volume is delivered from the ventilator but inspiratory time ( $T_i$ ) may increase. This affects the inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio (I/E). These changes in lung characteristics increase  $P_{alv}$  and  $P_{awo}$  as long as the ventilator is not pressure cycled out of inspiration by reaching the preset pressure limit.
