roubleshooting, in the context of mechanical ventilation, involves the identification and resolution of technical malfunctions in the patient-ventilator system. Troubleshooting can be thought of as purposeful resolution of inappropriate and potentially dangerous situations.

Previous chapters have reviewed key concepts used in the management of patients receiving mechanical ventilation. This chapter discusses common technical problems encountered during mechanical ventilation and presents basic problem-solving strategies to ensure patient safety.

### **DEFINITION OF THE TERM PROBLEM**

A problem can be defined as a situation in which a person finds discord or is uncomfortable with a matter that cannot be immediately resolved. Interestingly, a situation that might be uncomfortable for one person may not appear to be a problem for another person. For example, a respiratory therapist in the intensive care unit (ICU) may note that audible and visual alarms have activated for the intravenous pump. Unless it is part of this person's job function, the respiratory therapist might not perceive this as a problem that must be resolved and may simply contact the nurse. In contrast, if a ventilator alarm were activated, the same respiratory therapist would accept the responsibility of going to the patient's bedside to assess the situation and finding a solution to the problem. Therefore individuals must perceive an event as a problem and want to find a meaningful solution; that is, a situation must create discomfort that forces someone perceiving it to take action toward a resolution.

The ability to define a problem is particularly important to clinicians caring for critically ill patients. The lives of patients receiving ventilatory support may ultimately depend on the mechanical ventilator. Indeed, a matter of minutes can mean life or death. Because potential mishaps can occur with the patient-ventilator system, it is essential that clinicians develop the ability to identify and correct associated problems.

### **Solving Ventilation Problems**

The first step in solving any problem is to assess the situation at hand carefully. The next step is to gather and analyze pertinent data, which should point to a number of viable solutions.

When a solution is attempted, the clinician's observations of the patient's response are critical. If the response is positive and leads to the correct remedy, the problem is resolved. If not, the clinician must undo what was attempted and try to determine the reason the particular solution failed before attempting another approach. If the problem cannot be resolved, the clinician should seek help.

Determining the cause of the problem can help prevent its recurrence. Note the steps taken to solve the problem shown in Box 18.1 and Fig. 18.1. Which individual or individuals first perceived it as a problem? What steps were taken to determine the cause? What was the final resolution?

- Make recommendations about ventilator parameters for a patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome.
- Recommend adjustment of flow-cycle criteria during pressure support ventilation based on ventilator graphics.

Notice that the volume delivered by the ventilator (the inspiratory portion of the volume curve) is smaller than the volume exhaled, possibly because the patient is actively exhaling. A patient evaluation reveals that this is not the case.

The respiratory therapist, unable to explain the cause immediately, uses a respirometer to measure the volume coming from the volume delivery port, patient, and exhalation valve. The three volumes are equal. Still unable to determine the cause, the respiratory therapist contacts the individual who performs the maintenance checks on the ventilator. The respiratory therapist learns that the expiratory transducer was calibrated for a heated humidifier; however, a heat-moisture exchanger (HME) is being used with this patient. Although recalibrating the transducer would resolve the issue, it is not a life-threatening situation and therefore no immediate action is required.

### **PROTECTING THE PATIENT**

It is important to understand that ensuring patient safety is the foremost obligation of the clinician. Whenever an alarm activates on a ventilator or monitoring device, the clinician should first make sure that the patient is receiving adequate ventilation and oxygenation. Initially, this can be accomplished by visually assessing the patient's level of consciousness, use of accessory muscles, and chest

### BOX **18.1**

## Troubleshooting a Problem Using Ventilator Graphics

While doing rounds in the intensive care unit, a pulmonologist notices a ventilator graphic display showing the expiratory portion of the volume curve dropping below baseline (see Fig. 18.1). He contacts the respiratory therapist and inquires about possible causes.

![](_page_1_Figure_24.jpeg)

**Fig. 18.1** Curve *A* shows a normal volume-time curve. Curve *B* shows the expiratory portion of the volume below the zero baseline.

wall movements. During this initial assessment, the alarm should be checked and silenced. Auscultation of the chest can establish the presence of adequate breath sounds, and checking the  $S_pO_2$  can provide information about the patient's heart rate and oxygen  $(O_2)$  saturation. If the patient is in acute distress, demonstrating labored breathing, pallor, diaphoresis, and apparent anxiety, along with deterioration of breath sounds and a decreasing  $S_pO_2$ , immediate action is required. When a serious problem is detected, the patient may need to be disconnected from the ventilator and receive manual ventilation with a resuscitation bag. (After the patient is stabilized, the clinician can review the cause of the alarm activation and obtain help from other personnel if necessary.)

A self-inflating resuscitation bag can be used temporarily for ventilation of a distressed patient. When it is used properly, the resuscitation bag allows for the assessment of lung characteristics, because the clinician can check ("feel") a patient's lung and chest wall compliance and airway resistance manually. Manual ventilation must be performed cautiously to avoid inappropriate patterns of ventilation, excessive pressures (i.e., above 40 cm H<sub>2</sub>O), and barotrauma. Additionally, ventilator disconnection of a patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who is ventilated with a high level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) (15-25 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) can cause derecruitment of the lung, resulting in O2 desaturation. Manual ventilation must also be used judiciously because disconnecting the patient from the ventilator can also result in contamination of the patient's airway, which in turn can increase the patient's risk for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (see Chapter 14).

## **IDENTIFYING THE PATIENT IN SUDDEN DISTRESS**

The term *patient-ventilator asynchrony* is typically used to describe the phenomenon that occurs when patients are unable to breathe comfortably with the mechanical ventilator. The phrase "fighting the ventilator" is sometimes used to describe an individual who is apparently doing well while receiving mechanical ventilation but suddenly develops acute respiratory distress.<sup>3,4</sup> This situation is particularly challenging for most clinicians because the patient is unable to verbalize his or her discomfort (Key Point 18.1). (Sometimes clinicians can gain valuable information from patients simply by asking direct ["yes" or "no"] questions.<sup>5</sup>)

The sudden onset of dyspnea can be identified by observing the physical signs of distress (Fig. 18.2), including tachypnea; nasal flaring; diaphoresis; accessory muscle use; retraction of the suprasternal, supraclavicular, and intercostal spaces; paradoxical or abnormal movement of the thorax and abdomen; abnormal findings on auscultation; tachycardia; arrhythmia; and hypotension. Pulse oximetry, capnograph readings, ventilator graphics, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), plateau pressure (Pplat), and exhaled volumes may have changed and may provide information to help identify the cause of the problem.

Patient-ventilator **asynchrony** can be caused by a number of factors. Box 18.2 lists the most common causes of sudden respiratory distress in patients receiving mechanical ventilation. (See

### BOX **18.3**

### Management of Sudden Severe Respiratory Distress in a Patient on Mechanical Ventilation

- 1. Disconnect the patient from the ventilator.
- 2. Begin manual ventilation using a self-inflating resuscitation bag containing 80% to 100%  $O_2$ ; maintain normal ventilating pressures, and use a PEEP attachment if the patient has been on high PEEP ( $\geq$ 10 cm  $H_2O$ ).
- Manually evaluate compliance and resistance through bag ventilation.
- 4. Perform a rapid physical examination and assess monitored indexes and alarms.
- 5. Check the patency of the airway by passing a suction catheter.
- 6. If death appears imminent, treat the most likely problems: pneumothorax and airway obstruction.
- Once the patient's condition has stabilized, perform a more detailed assessment and provide any additional treatment required.

the section in Chapter 17 on steps to reduce the work of breathing [WOB] during mechanical ventilation.)

Evaluation of the ventilator graphics and settings can be used to resolve most of these problems. For example, autotriggering of breaths can occur if the sensitivity setting (inspiratory trigger) is too sensitive, resulting in an excessive number of triggered breaths. Patient-ventilator asynchrony is often associated with a patient's feelings of panic, which can be relieved by encouraging the patient to not "fight the ventilator" and relax while breathing with the ventilator. Selection of the appropriate mode and correct adjustment of the ventilator can eliminate most problems and reduce the need for sedation. (See Chapter 17 for more detailed information on patient-ventilator asynchrony.)

Identifying the cause of patient-ventilator asynchrony can be accomplished using a relatively simple approach (Box 18.3). If the patient is in *severe* distress, the first step is to disconnect the patient from the ventilator and carefully ventilate the patient using a manual resuscitation bag (i.e., avoiding excessive airway pressure). If the patient's distress resolves immediately, the problem is with the ventilator; if the distress does not resolve, the problem is typically because of the patient experiencing anxiety or pain (Key Point 18.2).

**Key Point** 18.2 In cases in which patient-ventilator asynchrony is identified, the clinician should disconnect the patient from the ventilator and carefully provide ventilation to the patient using a manual resuscitation bag.

### **PATIENT-RELATED PROBLEMS**

The most common patient-related problems encountered during mechanical ventilation involve the placement and patency of the artificial airway or the presence of a pneumothorax, bronchospasm, and excessive secretions (see Box 18.2).

### BOX **18.4**

### Causes of Airway Problems That Can Lead to Sudden Respiratory Distress

- Tube migration (flexion and extension of the head and neck can move the endotracheal tube [ET] in the airway an average of 2 cm down and up, respectively)
- · Migration of the ET above the vocal cords
- · Migration of the ET into the right mainstem bronchus
- · Rupture or leakage of the ET cuff
- Kinking of the ET
- · Patient biting the ET
- · Airway secretions and mucous plugging of airways
- · Impingement of the ET on the carina or airway
- Cuff herniation over the end of the ET (less of a problem with the current endotracheal cuffs)
- · Development of a tracheoesophageal fistula
- · Rupture of the innominate artery

### BOX **18.5**

## **Emergency Treatment for Rupture of the Innominate Artery**

Rupture of the innominate artery is a potentially serious airway complication, and the mortality rate for this condition is high. It is usually seen in the first 3 weeks after a tracheostomy. The immediate indication is blood spurting from the tracheotomy site.

To stop the hemorrhage, the cuff should be overinflated or pressure should be applied internally with a finger inserted through the stoma. The finger is inserted as far as possible toward the carina and then pulled forward in an attempt to compress the artery against the posterior aspect of the sternum.

### **Airway Problems**

Examples of acute airway problems include kinking of the endotracheal tube (ET), impingement of the tube on the carina, and displacement of the tube upward, above the vocal cords or into the right mainstem bronchus (Box 18.4). Rupture of the innominate artery can also occur (this is usually seen with tracheostomy tubes) (Box 18.5).<sup>4</sup> An unusual case study reported a fatal tracheal-innominate artery fistula caused by fixed positioning of the Hi-lo Evac tube to the left upper molar.<sup>6</sup> (This type of ET is used for continuous aspiration of the subglottic secretions.) Apparently, the continuous suction pressure against the soft tissue of the trachea for an extended period resulted in erosion of the tissue and, eventually, exposure of the innominate artery. This catheter has been redesigned to reduce the risk for this complication.

A quick check of the patient's oral cavity can sometimes reveal whether the ET is kinked or the patient is biting it. The clinician can easily determine whether the tube has been inserted too far or if it is too shallow in the airway by looking at the tube's centimeter markings at the airway opening. A properly positioned oral ET typically shows a centimeter marking at the teeth at approximately 23 cm for men (range, 22–24 cm) and 21 cm for women (range, 20–22 cm). If the centimeter markings are less than the ranges cited, the tube is too high in the airway. If the marking is greater than the ranges cited, the tube has migrated deeper into the airway.

If a serious airway problem cannot be resolved quickly, the clinician should provide ventilation of the patient manually to assess airway patency. If ventilation of the patient cannot be provided in this manner, an appropriately sized suction catheter should be passed through the artificial airway. If the catheter does not pass freely (and the patient is not biting on the ET), the tube is most likely obstructed. The cuff should then be deflated, which may allow some air to move around the tube in spontaneously breathing patients. If the obstruction cannot be cleared, the tube must be removed immediately and the patient ventilated with a resuscitation bag until reintubation is possible.<sup>7,8</sup>

### **Pneumothorax**

Pneumothorax is another possible problem that must be detected during positive pressure ventilation and treated quickly. Pneumothorax can be recognized as increased WOB if a patient is conscious. For example, the patient may demonstrate nasal flaring, use of accessory muscles, uneven chest wall movement, and absence of breath sounds on the affected side. Auscultation and percussion of the chest, cardiovascular assessment, and ventilating pressure evaluations usually can distinguish a pneumothorax from other problems. Table 8.1 provides physical and radiological findings commonly seen in patients with pulmonary disorders such as pneumothorax, asthma, emphysema, pneumonia, and pleural effusion.

If a tension pneumothorax is strongly suspected and cardiopulmonary arrest is imminent, a 14- or 16-gauge needle is inserted into the second intercostal space at the midclavicular line, over the top of the rib on the affected side. If the patient's condition is stable, a confirming chest radiograph can be obtained with chest tube placement and pleural drainage. The following case study describes the case of a patient with sudden respiratory distress.

### Clinical Scenario: A Case of Sudden Respiratory Distress

A 45-year-old woman has been receiving ventilation for 3 weeks for respiratory failure arising from severe asthma. Treatment has included administration of sedatives, antidepressants, and corticosteroids and bronchodilator therapy. Several attempts at weaning her from the ventilator, including a course of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, have been unsuccessful. At 36 hours after successful placement of a tracheostomy tube, the patient's ventilator high-pressure alarm activates. The respiratory therapist performs an assessment and suctions the patient's airway, which is determined to be patent. Breath sounds are diminished but present bilaterally. Within 10 minutes the high-pressure alarm activates again. The respiratory therapist returns to the room and notes that the patient appears to be coughing forcefully. The patient suddenly develops ventricular tachycardia and loses consciousness. The respiratory therapist finds it extremely difficult to apply ventilation through the tracheostomy tube. The tube is pulled, and the patient is immediately and successfully reintubated with an oral ET. Unfortunately, the resuscitation effort fails, and a postmortem chest radiograph shows bilateral pneumothoraxes.

The clinicians conclude that thickened secretions had blocked the airways, causing air trapping distally, and that increased pressures in the thorax from the patient's forceful coughing caused the bilateral pneumothoraxes.

### Bronchospasm

Bronchospasm may be manifested as dyspnea, wheezing, evidence of increased WOB (i.e., such as heightened use of accessory muscles); lack of coordination of chest or abdominal wall movement; retraction of the suprasternal, supraclavicular, and increased spaces; and increased airway resistance ( $R_{aw}$ ) (as evidenced by increased PIP and transairway pressure [PIP —  $P_{plat}$ ]). Wheezing associated with increased  $R_{aw}$  from airway hyperreactivity, such as occurs with asthma, can be treated with bronchodilators and parenteral corticosteroids. Wheezing can also be associated with cardiogenic problems and pulmonary emboli.

### **Secretions**

Evaluation of the patient's secretions can be useful in differentiating a variety of problems. (See Table 12.2 for a list of sputum findings and possible associated problems.) Drying of secretions is most often associated with inadequate humidification (Key Point 18.3). Copious amounts of secretions can occur with pulmonary edema and certain pulmonary disorders (e.g., cystic fibrosis). Depending on their characteristics, secretions may also suggest the presence of a respiratory infection; however, this is not usually a problem with a sudden onset. It is essential that the patient is provided appropriately warmed and humidified air. Suctioning should be performed only when indicated rather than according to a fixed schedule. Bronchial hygiene may include postural drainage and percussion and therapeutic bronchoscopy. (See Chapter 12 for additional information about airway clearance techniques.)

**EXECUTE: Key Point 18.3** Drying of secretions is most often associated with inadequate humidification.

### **Pulmonary Edema**

Pulmonary edema can be either cardiogenic or noncardiogenic in origin and should be managed accordingly. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema can occur suddenly and often manifests with thin, frothy, white to pink secretions. In cases in which cardiogenic pulmonary edema is suspected, the clinician should check for additional evidence of a cardiac problem, such as electrocardiographic findings, elevated blood pressure, evidence of neck vein distention, a history of heart disease, and data from a pulmonary artery catheter, if available (see Chapter 11). Cardiogenic pulmonary edema and heart failure can often be managed successfully with medications that reduce preload, increase contractility, and reduce afterload, such as furosemide (Lasix), digoxin (Lanoxin), enalapril maleate (Vasotec), and morphine.

Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema or pulmonary edema that is caused by an increase in pulmonary capillary permeability (e.g., ARDS usually develops over a day or two and is not a sudden-onset problem. The management of ARDS is discussed in Chapter 13.

### **Dynamic Hyperinflation**

Dynamic hyperinflation of the lungs that occurs with auto-PEEP can lead to difficulty with ventilator triggering. Auto-PEEP can also cause cardiovascular problems, such as hypotension and reduced cardiac output. One of the best ways to detect the presence of auto-PEEP is through the evaluation of the ventilator waveforms.

Auto-PEEP should be suspected whenever flow does not return to baseline in either a flow-time scalar or a flow-volume loop. Efforts to reduce auto-PEEP can be aided by reducing the inspiratory time ( $T_I$ ), minute ventilation ( $\dot{V}_E$ ), and  $R_{aw}$ . As previously mentioned, auto-PEEP hinders a patient's ability to trigger the ventilator (see Fig. 7.1). (See Chapter 7 for a discussion of how raising the applied PEEP [extrinsic PEEP] can be used to ease breath triggering in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] when auto-PEEP cannot be completely eliminated.)

### **Abnormalities in Respiratory Drive**

Inadequate output from the respiratory centers of the brain can occur as a result of heavy sedation, acute neurological disorders, or neuromuscular blockage. However, these conditions are more likely to reduce respiratory function than to produce sudden respiratory distress. Increased output from the respiratory centers is associated with pain, anxiety, increased peripheral sensory receptor stimulation, medications, increased ventilatory needs, and inappropriate ventilator settings.

### **Change in Body Position**

Changes in the patient's position can be associated with accidental extubation, bending and twisting of the patient circuit, and in some cases alterations in the patient's level of oxygenation. Reductions in oxygenation can occur with repositioning of the patient so that the diseased lung is placed in a dependent position. It can also occur with sudden airway obstruction by a mucous plug, secretions, or clot migration that leads to a pulmonary embolus. (Changing the patient's body position can cause a thrombus to dislodge and migrate, causing a pulmonary embolus.)

### **Drug-Induced Distress**

It is important to recognize that when acute respiratory distress develops in a patient on ventilation in the ICU and the cause cannot be readily identified, possible causes may be related to medications the patient takes or possible chemical dependency. For example, intravenous morphine, which is commonly used to relieve pain, can cause nausea, hypotension, disorientation, hallucinations, fever, constipation, and respiratory arrest. This may be especially true in older patients, whose ability to metabolize and clear medications may be diminished.

Patients with chemical dependency (alcohol, drug, or tobacco) present additional clinical management issues, particularly if the ICU staff is unaware of a patient's chemical dependency. Sudden interruption of use of the chemical by the patient may cause symptoms of withdrawal syndrome, such as anxiety, restlessness, irritability, insomnia, and inability to focus attention.

### **Abdominal Distention**

Abdominal distention can be associated with air being introduced into the stomach (e.g., via a nasogastric tube) and with a number of disorders, including ascites, abdominal bleeding or obstruction, and liver or kidney disorders. Some of these conditions have a slower onset than others, but all cause an upward pressure on the diaphragm, restricting its downward movement. This restriction of diaphragm movement can lead to atelectasis in the basilar areas of the lungs, ventilation-perfusion abnormalities, and hypoxemia.

### **Pulmonary Embolism**

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is another acute-onset problem that can lead to patient-ventilator asynchrony. The rapid onset of

hypoxemia from a large embolus leads to all the signs of distress previously described. The patient typically demonstrates the presence of bilateral breath sounds, indicating that both lungs are receiving ventilation (i.e., PE interferes with perfusion, not ventilation). With PE the heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate are elevated. Even with high ventilator rates and flows, the patient may use accessory muscles to breathe and may become pale. Checking airway patency and ventilating pressures and increasing the  $F_{\rm I}O_2$  may not reverse the arterial  $O_2$  desaturation  $(S_aO_2)$ . Disconnection from the ventilator and manual ventilation also will not help relieve the distress.

PE is an emergency that often leaves the clinician feeling helpless to determine the cause and treatment (Case Study 18.1). Capnography findings can, however, provide a clue to the presence of a PE. A decrease in the end-tidal carbon dioxide ( $P_{et}CO_2$ ) value compared with previous readings and a widening of the arterial-to—end-tidal partial pressure  $CO_2$  gradient ( $P_{(a-et)}CO_2$ ) may suggest the presence of an embolus. Demonstration of the presence of a PE usually requires a **pulmonary angiogram** and computed tomography. **Thrombolytic therapy**, such as the use of alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator [tPA]; Actilyse) or reteplase (Retavase), may be appropriate.

### **VENTILATOR-RELATED PROBLEMS**

Clinicians typically rely on algorithms to identify problems with the patient-ventilator circuit. A relatively quick way to identify whether the problem is a ventilator-related problem is to determine whether the patient's respiratory distress is relieved by manual ventilation with  $100\%~O_2$  via a self-inflating resuscitation bag. If the intervention relieves the respiratory distress, the problem is probably associated with the ventilator or applied ventilator-management strategy.

![](_page_5_Picture_19.jpeg)

### Case Study 18.1

## **Evaluating Severe Respiratory Distress in a Ventilated Patient**

While performing a patient-ventilator check, the respiratory therapist notes that the patient suddenly develops signs of severe respiratory distress. The low O<sub>2</sub> saturation alarm on the pulse oximeter activates. Breath sounds are equal bilaterally with no change from previous findings. The respiratory therapist disconnects the patient and performs manual ventilation using 100% O2. A suction catheter passes through the patient's ET without difficulty; however, the patient's distress continues and O<sub>2</sub> saturation remains low. The therapist notes that the capnometer reading for PetCO2 has changed from its previous value of 35 mm Hg to 27 mm Hg. Arterial blood gas analysis indicates that the PaCO2 has not changed but the PaO2 decreased to 20 mm Hg. The  $P_{(a-et)}CO_2$  has increased from 6 to 14 mm Hg. What is the cause of the patient's respiratory distress?

### Leaks

Activation of low-pressure, low-volume, or low- $\dot{V}_E$  alarms typically indicates a leak in the patient-ventilator circuit is present. (As discussed later in this chapter, the presence of a leak can be verified by analyzing the various ventilator graphics available on most ICU ventilators.) Leaks are commonly caused by disconnection of the patient from the ventilator; if this is the problem, the ventilator circuit simply needs to be reconnected to the patient's artificial airway.

Leaks can also occur around the cuff of the ET. To determine whether this is the problem, the clinician should auscultate over the tracheal area for abnormal breath sounds during inspiration. To correct a cuff leak, the cuff is reinflated and the cuff pressure is rechecked. If a minimum leak technique is used, the cuff leak and tracheal air sounds should be present at peak inspiration under normal conditions. (See Chapter 8 for more detailed information on checking the circuit and evaluating for leaks.) Small ETs, such as those used with neonates, do not have cuffs and therefore allow for a minimum amount of air to leak around the tube. Migration of the ET into the upper airway, above the vocal cords, is another possible cause of a leak associated with the ET.

Circuit leaks can also occur at junctions in the patient circuit where connections exist. These may include connections at water traps, humidifiers, and HMEs; inline closed-suction catheters; temperature probes; inline metered-dose inhaler chambers; proximal airway pressure lines; capnograph ( $\rm CO_2$ ) sensors; and unseated or leaking exhalation valves. Another, less common source of leaks is a pleural drainage system. In this situation, compensation for pleural leaks can sometimes be accomplished by increasing volume delivery to the patient. The amount of air leaking through the pleural drainage system can be determined by comparing the inspiratory and expiratory tidal volume ( $\rm V_T$ ).

Leak checks are typically performed when equipment is prepared for patient use, but these checks can also be performed while the equipment is in use (e.g., if a patient circuit is changed). Newer ICU ventilators can automatically perform the patient-ventilator circuit test. A leak check can also be performed manually if a leak develops during patient ventilation. While the patient is ventilated manually, the clinician changes the ventilator mode to volume-controlled ventilation (VC-CMV) and sets the V<sub>T</sub> to 100 mL, the flow to 20 L/min, the inspiratory pause to 2 seconds, and the pressure limit to maximum. The patient Y-connector is occluded with sterile gauze, and the ventilator is cycled manually. The circuit pressure that develops during inspiration should plateau and hold at that level, falling no more than 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O during a 2-second pause. If the pressure falls more than this, a significant leak is present and must be corrected. If the leak cannot be corrected quickly and easily, a change of equipment may be necessary.

### **Inadequate Oxygenation**

A condition of inadequate oxygenation is usually signaled by activation of a low  $S_pO_2$  alarm. Patients typically demonstrate tachycardia (although bradycardia may also occur) along with other signs of hypoxemia. (See Table 4.1 for the signs and symptoms of hypoxia.) Note that arterial blood gas analysis is required to confirm the presence of hypoxemia. It is important to recognize that worsening hypoxemia can be an ominous sign of deteriorating lung function.

### **Inadequate Ventilatory Support**

Inappropriate  $\dot{V}_E$  and ventilator settings can cause increased WOB, which can ultimately lead to patient-ventilator asynchrony. Respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia may also be seen in cases in which the patient experiences an increased WOB. (Chapter 17 contains more information on the effects of increased WOB.)

### **Trigger Sensitivity**

As previously mentioned in Chapter 17, setting an appropriate trigger sensitivity is important to ensuring effective ventilatory support that minimizes the WOB for the patient. Autotriggering is a sign that the trigger sensitivity is set too low. Lack of ventilator response to a patient's inspiratory efforts may be the result of incorrect sensitivity settings, low-flow settings, or a poorly responsive internal demand valve. Trigger sensitivity may also be altered when a nebulizer is being used that is powered by an external gas source, which can blunt the machine's ability to sense a patient breath. Other causes are water in the inspiratory line and the presence of auto-PEEP.

Inappropriate sensitivity settings can often be corrected by simply increasing or decreasing the sensitivity setting. If these changes do not solve the problem, each of the other causes mentioned must be addressed.

### **Inadequate Flow Setting**

A low inspiratory gas flow can be corrected by increasing the flow setting or changing the flow pattern, such as using a descending ramp rather than a rectangular flow pattern. A concave inspiratory pressure scalar during VC-CMV indicates active inspiration with inadequate flow (Fig. 18.3). Changing the mode of ventilation may also be an effective means of providing adequate flow to the patient. For example, switching from VC-CMV to pressure ventilation with a volume target (e.g., pressure-regulated volume control) can change the flow pattern and sometimes relieve distress.

## Other Examples of Patient-Ventilator Asynchrony

In addition to an inappropriate sensitivity setting and inadequate flow, other types of patient-ventilator asynchrony can occur. For example, auto-PEEP, an increased ventilatory drive, or the need for sedation may manifest as patient-ventilator asynchrony. In such cases the airway pressure ( $P_{aw}$ ) usually fluctuates dramatically; the respiratory therapist must determine the cause and correct the problem (Box 18.6). For example, with auto-PEEP the patient may have trouble triggering a breath. For patients with COPD with airflow obstruction, setting low levels of PEEP may alleviate the problem (see Box 7.1 and Fig. 7.1A and B).

Asynchronous breathing may also be seen in patients with COPD when pressure support ventilation (PSV) is used. COPD patients often show active short inspirations and active long expirations. <sup>14</sup> If the patient begins to exhale actively during the inspiratory phase of PSV, the flow may not drop to the necessary cycling value to end inspiration on the pressure-supported breath, resulting in a sudden rise in the scalar at the end of the breath. <sup>15</sup> This problem can be avoided by having these patients use a ventilator with adjustable flow-cycling characteristics.

During PSV, another problem may occur in patients with a highflow demand when pressures are set too low. In markedly distressed patients, the transition to exhalation may be affected by the ventilator's ability to respond quickly and open the exhalation valve. <sup>16</sup>

Fig. 18.3 Before the delivery of a mandatory breath (constant flow, volume-controlled continuous mandatory ventilation [VC-CMV]), patient effort reaches the trigger threshold, and a normal breath is delivered (breath on left). The second breath (right) is patient triggered, but the pressure curve (arrow) is concave because of the patient's active attempt to inhale.

### BOX **18.6**

### **Resolution of Various Types of Ventilator** Asynchrony\*

- Trigger asynchrony: Confirm that the sensitivity level has been set appropriately, air trapping (auto-PEEP) is not present, and the patient is not agitated.
- Flow asynchrony: Ensure the flow is adequate and the flow delivery curve is appropriate.
- Cycle asynchrony: With pressure support ventilation (PSV), ensure that the patient is not exhaling actively; with pressure control ventilation (PC-CMV), make sure the duration set for the T<sub>i</sub> is not too long.
- · Mode asynchrony: Occurs when more than one type of breath is delivered, such as with intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV); another mode may be more appropriate for the patient.
- PEEP asynchrony: Causes include overdistention from excess PEEP and atelectasis and atelectrauma from a PEEP setting that is too low; make sure PEEP is set at an appropriate
- · Closed-loop ventilation asynchrony: Closed-loop mode may not be performing as needed for a particular patient. Make sure current settings are appropriate. Consider selecting another mode.

\*See Chapter 17 for additional information.

If all efforts have been made to resolve a patient-ventilator asynchrony problem and a solution cannot be found, medications may be necessary. Sedatives, used either alone or with neuromuscular blocking agents, may be the most effective method to relieve severely distressed patients (see Chapter 15). However, the clinician must make a systematic attempt to find the cause of the problem and correct it as quickly as possible before recommending medications.

### **COMMON ALARM SITUATIONS**

Ventilators and monitoring equipment have a number of alarms to notify the practitioner of changes in a patient's status. Appropriate use of these alarms is essential for patient safety (see Chapter 7).<sup>17</sup>

### **Low-Pressure Alarm**

As already discussed, low-pressure alarms are most often activated by leaks (Box 18.7). When a low-pressure alarm activates, the clinician should first check to ensure the patient is receiving ventilation. If the alarm occurs because the patient is inadvertently disconnected from the ventilator, the patient should simply be reconnected. Otherwise, the patient may need ventilation with a manual resuscitator until the source of the leak is identified. Once the problem has been identified, the clinician should reset the alarm, making sure that it is set about 5 to 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O below PIP.

### BOX **18.7**

### **Common Causes of Low-Pressure Alarms**

- · Patient disconnection
- · Circuit leaks
- Disconnection of the inspiratory or expiratory tubing of the ventilator circuit
  - Humidifiers
  - Filters
  - · Water traps
  - · Inline metered-dose inhalers
  - Inline nebulizers
  - · Proximal pressure monitors
  - · Flow monitoring lines
  - · Exhaled gas monitoring devices
  - · Inline closed-suction catheters
- · Temperature monitors
- · Exhalation valve leaks
  - Cracked or leaking valves
  - Unseated valves
  - · Improperly connected valves
- · Airway leaks
  - · Use of minimum leak technique
  - · Inadequate endotracheal tube (ET) cuff inflation
  - · Leak in pilot balloon or cut pilot balloon
  - · Rupture of ET cuff
  - · Migration of ET into upper airway above the vocal cords
- Chest tube leaks

### **High-Pressure Alarm**

High-pressure alarms are incorporated into all current ICU ventilators (Box 18.8). High-pressure limits are usually set about 10 cm  $\rm H_2O$  above PIP. Conditions leading to activation of high-pressure alarms can be categorized as airway problems, changes in the patient's lung characteristics or patient-related conditions, and problems related to the patient-ventilator circuit.

Audible and visible high-pressure alarms are typically activated when a patient coughs or bites on the ET. High-pressure alarms also will become activated when secretions build up in the patient's airway. Coughing usually is self-limited and does not require treatment. Use of a bite block or oropharyngeal airway may help prevent unresponsive patients from biting on the ET. Some commercially available ET holders have built-in bite blocks. Conscious and responsive patients can be instructed not to bite on the tube; sometimes they listen. Secretions can often be removed by suctioning.

Conditions that adversely affect a patient's lung characteristics (e.g., increased airway resistance  $[R_{aw}]$  or decreased lung compliance  $[C_L]$ ) or spontaneous breathing efforts can also trigger high-pressure alarms. Examples of conditions that increase  $R_{aw}$  are bronchospasm, secretions, and mucosal edema. Conditions most often seen in the ICU that are associated with decreased  $C_L$  include ARDS, pneumonia, pneumothorax, pleural effusions, abdominal distention, and ascites. Identifying  $R_{aw}$  and  $C_L$  changes can be identified on physical examination by listening to breath sounds and evaluating changes in the PIP and  $P_{plat}$  (see Table 18.1) and by interpreting ventilator graphics (Case Studies 18.2 and 18.3; Fig. 18.4).

### BOX 18.8

### **Common Causes of High-Pressure Alarms**

### **Conditions Related to the Airway**

- Coughing
- · Secretions or mucus in the airway
- · Patient biting on the ET (oral intubation)
- Kinking of the ET inside the mouth or in the back of the throat
- · Impingement of the ET on the trachea or carina
- Changes in the position of the ET (i.e., migration of the tube into the right mainstem bronchus)
- · Herniation of the ET cuff over the end of the tube

### **Conditions Related to the Lungs**

- Increased airway resistance (e.g., secretions, mucosal edema, bronchospasm)
- Decreased compliance (e.g., pneumothorax, pleural effusion)
- · Patient-ventilator asynchrony

### **Changes in the Ventilator Circuit**

- · Accumulation of water condensate in the patient circuit
- · Kinking in the inspiratory circuit
- · Malfunction in the inspiratory or expiratory valves

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>a</sup>The plateau pressure has not changed in Case 1; therefore an airway problem should be suspected.

From Tobin MJ: What should a clinician do when a patient "fights the ventilator"? *Respir Care* 36:395–406, 1991.

A high-pressure alarm may also be triggered when a patient actively breathes out of synchrony with the ventilator. PIP rises if the patient actively exhales while the ventilator is in the inspiratory phase, and this can activate the high-pressure alarm. A change in a ventilator setting or in the patient's condition that results in air trapping in the lungs (i.e., auto-PEEP) also causes the PIP to rise and may trigger an alarm.

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>b</sup>The plateau pressure has increased in Case 2, but no increase is seen in the gradient between the peak pressure and the plateau pressure; therefore a pneumothorax, mainstem intubation, or atelectasis should be suspected.

### Case Study 18.2

## Evaluating Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP) and Plateau Pressure ( $P_{\rm plat}$ ) in Volume-Controlled (VC) Ventilation

A 28-year-old man is receiving ventilatory support with VC-CMV. A high-pressure alarm has activated on several occasions over the past 4 hours. The following parameters were noted:

| Time  | Volume (L) | PIP (cm H <sub>2</sub> O) | P <sub>plat</sub> (cm H <sub>2</sub> O) |
|-------|------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 12:00 | 0.5        | 25                        | 19                                      |
| 14:00 | 0.5        | 34                        | 29                                      |
| 16:00 | 0.5        | 39                        | 33                                      |

The patient had been admitted 72 hours earlier after a motor vehicle crash in which he sustained chest trauma without pneumothorax. He has been receiving ventilatory support for the past 36 hours because of severe hypoxemia and increased WOB that progressed to acute respiratory failure.

At 16:00 hours the respiratory therapist notes bilateral crackles, particularly in the lung bases, where the percussion note was dull. A chest radiograph shows bilateral infiltrates. What caused the increase in PIP and P<sub>plat</sub>? Suggest a possible diagnosis for this patient based on the clinical findings.

### Case Study 18.3

## **Evaluating PIP and Volume in Pressure Control Ventilation**

A patient with a history of asthma is receiving mechanical ventilation in the PC-CMV mode after open heart surgery. Occasionally the high-pressure alarm is activated when the patient coughs or appears to try to exhale forcibly. The low  $V_T$  alarm is also activated several times. The following values were obtained while monitoring the patient:

| Time  | Volume (L) | PIP (cm H <sub>2</sub> O) | f (breaths/min) |
|-------|------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| 09:00 | 0.75       | 25                        | 8               |
| 10:00 | 0.68       | 25                        | 9               |
| 11:00 | 0.6        | 25                        | 11              |

Fig. 18.4 shows the flow-volume loop measured on the patient at 11:00 hours. Breath sounds reveal bilateral scattered wheezes. What caused the change in volume delivery? What therapy would you recommend?

It is important to recognize that PIP may also be elevated if problems arise in the patient-ventilator circuit. Accumulated water from condensation can lead to oscillations in the gas flow through the circuit and subsequent fluctuations in  $P_{aw}$ . Water in the circuit can lead to autotriggering, increased PIP, and sometimes activation of a high-pressure alarm. Kinks in the circuit can also lead to an increased PIP and alarm activation.

![](_page_9_Figure_17.jpeg)

**Fig. 18.4** Flow-volume loop. Inspiration occurs below the *x*-axis, and expiration occurs above it. *Arrow A* indicates the peak expiratory flow. *Arrow B* indicates increased expiratory resistance with reduced expiratory flow (*solid line*). The *dashed line* represents the predicted expiratory flow loop for this patient.

Several possible problems should be considered when circuit pressures are rising. For example, nebulized medications can accumulate on the expiratory filter or the exhalation valve, leading to increased resistance to gas flow through the filter or valve. Consequently, the exhalation valve may be unable to open completely. If the valves are malfunctioning, they should be cleaned or replaced and the sensor should be recalibrated to correct the problem. HMEs also can accumulate excessive secretions, which can lead to increased flow resistance. Notice how slowly the expiratory flow and expiratory volume return to baseline in Fig. 18.3. This is a graphic example of increased expiratory resistance. (NOTE: A partly obstructed HME can also produce this type of expiratory feature.)

Regardless of the cause of a high-pressure alarm, the patient's safety must always be the clinician's first priority (Key Point 18.4). The clinician must ensure that the patient has a patent airway and is receiving ventilation and oxygenation.

**EXECUTE: Key Point 18.4** Whenever a problem arises, the clinician's first priority always must be the patient's safety.

### **Low-PEEP/CPAP Alarms**

Low-PEEP/continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) alarms activate when the airway pressure falls below the desired baseline during PEEP or CPAP. This may occur when the ventilator cannot compensate for a leak in the circuit. Another possible cause of a low-pressure alarm is active inspiration by the patient. Active inspiration can cause the pressure to drop below the alarm setting. The machine sensitivity may not be responsive enough to the patient's effort, or the ventilator demand valve may not open quickly enough in response to flow demand. For example, if inspiratory gas flow is set too low and the demand valve does not respond to the patient's inspiratory effort, the PEEP level drops, which may activate the alarm.

### **Apnea Alarm**

Activation of an apnea alarm may indicate patient apnea or patient disconnection, system leaks, inadequate machine sensitivity, or inappropriately set apnea parameters. An apnea alarm may also be accompanied by a low-pressure or low  $\dot{V}_E$  alarm. Some ventilators have a preset apnea period of 20 seconds, whereas others allow the operator to set the apnea period. Ventilators are designed to detect spontaneous and mandatory breaths. Thus, when an apnea alarm sounds, the most obvious cause is patient apnea. After ensuring that the patient is receiving ventilation, the clinician should check the mandatory breathing rate and the machine's sensitivity. The clinician should also check for possible leaks or patient disconnection. In cases in which auto-PEEP is present, patient triggering may be more difficult, resulting in undetected efforts. A ventilator set in a spontaneous mode (e.g., PSV or CPAP) could misinterpret this as apnea.

Some ventilators provide a backup mode of ventilation when the apnea alarm is activated. Backup modes generally provide a minimum safe level of ventilation for the patient until the operator can respond to the alarm and correct the problem. Some ventilators cancel the backup mode once a patient effort is detected (e.g., PB 840, Medtronics Minimally Invasive Technologies, Minneapolis, MN).

### **Low-Source Gas Pressure or Power Input Alarm**

A low-source gas alarm activates if the gas source fails or the high-pressure line becomes disconnected from the gas source. With ventilators equipped with an air compressor, the operator must ensure that the compressor is operating. (NOTE: Earlier-generation ventilators, such as the CareFusion Bear 1000, used an on/off switch that had to be turned on; current ICU ventilators, such as the Medtronics PB 840 and 980 ventilators, are designed with compressors that automatically turn on when there is a loss of pressure in the patient-ventilator circuit.) The operator must, however, ensure that the air and  $O_2$  lines are connected to an active gas supply, such as a wall outlet.

Modern microprocessor-controlled ventilators require an electrical power source. If a power-loss alarm activates, the clinician should first confirm that the unit is connected to an active electrical outlet and has not been unplugged. If the electrical outlet is working and the unit fails to start, the line fuse or circuit breaker may need to be replaced or reset. Most ICU ventilators have a reset button near the "power on" switch. In the event of an overall power outage, the ventilator should be plugged into a red electrical outlet (these outlets are connected to emergency generator power supplies). Many ICU ventilators have backup battery power sufficient to operate a unit for 30 minutes to 4 hours, depending on the ventilator and the battery source.

## Ventilator Inoperative Alarm and Technical Error Message

With microprocessor-controlled ventilators, an inoperative alarm or a technical error message is displayed if an internal malfunction is detected by the ventilator's self-testing systems. This most often occurs when the ventilator is first turned on. Sometimes simply turning the machine off and then back on corrects the error. If it does not, it may be necessary to replace the ventilator and contact the manufacturer's representative.

## **Operator Settings Incompatible With Machine Parameters**

An error message or alarm (or both) is triggered if the operator tries to select a setting that is outside the range for that parameter or is incompatible with the other selected settings. For example, if the clinician tries to set a  $V_T$  of 50 mL and the  $V_T$  range for the ventilator is 200 to 2000 mL, the ventilator will indicate that that setting cannot be selected. Another example of an incompatible setting can occur when using volume control ventilation. If the operator sets an inspiratory gas flow that cannot deliver the set  $V_T$  within an acceptable time based on the set  $f_r$  the machine produces an error message asking the operator to correct the flow or reduce the  $V_T$ .

## Inspiratory-to-Expiratory Ratio Indicator and Alarm

Most current ICU ventilators do not allow the inspiratory-to-expiratory (I/E) ratio to exceed 1:1 unless the operator specifically wants to use an inverse I/E ratio. This generally requires activation of a separate control or touch pad or some similar function that alerts the operator that the ratio is being inverted.

An inverse-ratio alarm may activate if a change occurs in the patient lung's characteristic (i.e., increased  $R_{\rm aw}$  or decreased  $C_{\rm L}$ ), resulting in a lower inspiratory flow. This does not happen often, however, because most ventilators have enough power to maintain the desired gas flow. Another possibility is a flow setting that is too low for the desired  $V_{\rm T}$  delivery. The I/E ratio can also change when the selected waveform is changed. For example, changing from a constant flow to a descending ramp waveform may lengthen the  $T_{\rm I}$  in a volume-targeted ventilation. Selection of an inspiratory pause can also lengthen  $T_{\rm I}$ . In pressure-controlled ventilation, a long  $T_{\rm I}$  (depending on the set f) may activate the I/E ratio indicator.

### **Other Alarms**

Additional alarms may be available on many ICU ventilators, including high-PEEP/CPAP alarms, low- and high- $V_T$  alarms, low- and high- $\dot{V}_E$  alarms, a high-f alarm, and low- and high- $F_IO_2$  alarms. High-PEEP/CPAP alarms are often activated by the same problems that lead to high-pressure alarms. Low- $V_T$  and low- $\dot{V}_E$  alarms usually activate in situations that cause low-pressure alarms or when the patient's spontaneous ventilation has decreased for some reason. Flow-sensor disconnection, leaks, or malfunction can also cause activation of these alarms.

High- $V_T$ , high-f, and high- $\dot{V}_E$  alarms can activate if the patient's  $\dot{V}_E$  has increased, or when the ventilator is too sensitive to patient effort (i.e., autotriggering). High- $\dot{V}_E$  alarms also may be activated if a nebulizer powered by a separate external gas source is in line with the main circuit. These problems may be caused by inappropriate calibration, contamination, or malfunction of flow sensors.

Box 18.9 and Fig. 18.5 present several clinical situations that can be associated with alarm activation. It is important that clinicians become familiar with the types of equipment used in their facilities and the various alarm systems available.

## USE OF GRAPHICS TO IDENTIFY VENTILATOR PROBLEMS

Ventilator graphic displays can provide valuable information that clinicians can use to evaluate the integrity of the patient-ventilator system (Key Point 18.5). A detailed review of ventilator graphics

### **BOX 18.9** Ventilator Troubleshooting: Response to Alarms and Abnormal Waveforms

If an alarm activates or an abnormal waveform appears:

- 1. Assess the patient's appearance to evaluate for distress.
- 2. Ensure the patient is receiving adequate ventilation and oxygenation.
- 3. If necessary, and if the patient is suffering severe distress, disconnect the patient from the ventilator and manually ventilate, adding PEEP (if needed, and increase the F<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.)
- 4. Reassess the patient.
- 5. Check the activated alarm, and make sure alarm parameters have been set appropriately.
- 6. Once the cause of problem has been determined, resolve it.
- 7. If the problem cannot be resolved, change the ventilator or call for help.

### **Common Alarm Situations**

### Low-Pressure Alarm

- 1. Check for patient disconnection.
- 2. Check for leaks in the patient circuit related to the artificial airway and through chest tubes.
- 3. Confirm that the proximal pressure line is connected and unobstructed.
- 4. Low-pressure alarm may be accompanied by a low minute ventilation  $(\dot{V}_E)$  or low tidal volume  $(V_T)$  alarm.

### **High-Pressure Alarm**

- 1. If the patient is coughing, check to determine whether secretions have built up in the airway or the patient is biting the endotracheal tube (ET).
- 2. Check for kinking or displacement of the ET; also check the tube's position in the airway (i.e., ensure that the ET is not inserted too far into the trachea).
- 3. Check whether  $R_{aw}$  has increased or  $C_L$  has decreased.
- 4. Ensure that the main inspiratory or expiratory lines are not kinked or obstructed.
- 5. Check that the patient is breathing synchronously with the
- 6. Determine whether air trapping (auto-PEEP) has developed.
- 7. Ensure that the expiratory filter and expiratory valve are functioning properly.

### Low Positive End-Expiratory or PEEP/CPAP Alarms

- 1. Check to determine whether the low-PEEP alarm is set below the applied PEEP level.
- 2. Determine whether the patient is actively inspiring below
- 3. Determine whether a leak is present.
- 4. Confirm that the patient has not become disconnected from
- 5. Ensure that the proximal airway pressure (Paw) line is not occluded.

### Apnea Alarm

- 1. Determine whether the patient is apneic.
- 2. Check for leaks.
- 3. Check the sensitivity setting to be sure the ventilator can detect patient effort.
- 4. Check the alarm-time interval and the volume setting, when appropriate.

### Low-Source Gas Pressure or Power Input Alarm

- 1. Check the 50-psi gas source (e.g., wall connection, cylinder, or air compressor).
- 2. Check high-pressure hose connections to the ventilator.
- 3. Check ventilator's electrical power supply and whether it is plugged into the electrical outlet that is connected to the emergency backup system.
- 4. Check the line fuse or circuit breaker.
- 5. Try using the reset button.
- 6. If alarms continue, replace the ventilator.

### Ventilator Inoperative Alarm or Technical Error Message

- 1. If an internal malfunction message is present and the ventilator is turned on, try turning the ventilator off and restarting it.
- 2. If alarm continues, follow message instructions or replace the ventilator.

### Operator Settings Incompatible With Machine **Parameters**

- 1. Error message usually indicates that a parameter must be reset (e.g., flow is not high enough to deliver  $V_T$  within an acceptable T<sub>1</sub> to keep the inspiratory-to-expiratory (I/E) ratio below 1:1 [based on f,  $V_T$ , and flow]).
- 2. Adjust the appropriate controls.

### Inspiratory-to-Expiratory Ratio Indicator and Alarm

- 1. Usually indicates an I/E ratio greater than 1:1.
- 2. If inverse I/E ratio is a goal, disable the I/E ratio limit or ignore the audible warning.
- 3. If normal I/E ratios are a goal, check alarm causes:
  - If increased R<sub>aw</sub> or decreased C<sub>L</sub> has resulted in a lower flow, treat the cause.
  - If the flow setting is too low for the desired  $V_T$  delivery, increase flow or change the flow waveform.

### Other Possible Alarms

was presented in Chapter 9, and examples of ventilator-associated problems have been discussed throughout the text. The following discussion provides a summary of how ventilator graphics can be used to identify problems encountered with the patient-ventilator interface.

### Leaks

As previously discussed, inadvertent patient disconnection and leaks in the patient-ventilator circuit are common during mechanical ventilation. When these situations arise, low-pressure, low-volume, low- $\dot{V}_E$ , or apnea alarms usually become activated. Volume-time scalars are one means of identifying leaks, as are pressure-volume and flow-volume loops (see Chapter 9 for more details). In each graphic representation, the most important indicator of a leak can be found using the expiratory volume curve. If the expiratory volume does not return to zero in any of these waveforms, a leak is present in the system (Figs. 18.6 and 18.7;

### **Problem Solving Using Ventilator Graphics**

The respiratory therapist hears a low-pressure ventilator alarm for a patient receiving VC-CMV. She evaluates the patient and finds that the individual is not in distress and is being ventilated and oxygenated. She checks the activated alarm (i.e., low  $\dot{V}_E$ ), silences it, and saves the graphics display. Fig. 18.7 shows the saved graphs. What do these waveforms indicate?

Case Studies 18.4 and 18.5). In some cases, the volume tracing may drop below zero; this finding indicates that the equipment needs to be recalibrated (see Fig. 18.1). This can also occur if the patient is actively exhaling.

### **Inadequate Flow**

Patient-ventilator asynchrony can occur if a ventilator provides only a fixed flow or an inadequate flow during mechanical ventilation. In such cases the pressure-time graphic is concave and the flow curve is constant (see Fig. 18.3).

**CHAPTER 18**

Fig. 18.5, cont'd

### **Inadequate Sensitivity Setting for Patient Triggering**

The ventilator's trigger sensitivity can be set too low for a patient. An inappropriately set sensitivity, such as an inadequate flow setting, increases WOB.

### **Overinflation**

Pressure-volume loops that produce a duck-bill, or "beak," appearance can be used to identify alveolar overinflation (see Fig 13.6).

### **Auto-PEEP**

Ventilator graphics can be used to detect auto-PEEP. If expiratory flow does not return to zero on a flow-volume loop before the next mandatory breath, auto-PEEP is present (Fig. 18.8).

### **Inadequate Inspiratory Time During Pressure** Ventilation

One goal of pressure-controlled ventilation (PC-CMV) may be to provide a T<sub>I</sub> long enough to achieve a slight plateau effect so that the inspiratory flow drops to zero before the end of inspiration (see Fig. 5.2C). Sometimes this plateau is not present because of changes in the patient's lung characteristics or a short T<sub>I</sub>. The T<sub>I</sub> may need to be adjusted, depending on the clinical situation.

### **Waveform Ringing**

When flow and pressure delivery are high at the beginning of a breath, particularly during a pressure breath, a phenomenon known as ringing, spiking, or overshoot can result from the oscillation of air in the patient-ventilator circuit and upper airway at

![](_page_14_Figure_3.jpeg)

Fig. 18.5, cont'd

the beginning of inspiration (Fig. 18.9). This situation, although not life-threatening, does not represent a smooth breath delivery. Current ICU ventilators allow adjustment of gas flow and pressure delivery at the beginning of a breath to help taper flow and pressure delivery and reduce overshoot. This feature commonly is labeled the inspiratory rise time. Oscillation can also occur if condensation is present in the patient circuit. This latter situation can be easily remedied by draining of the circuit.

### **Expiratory Portion of Volume-Time Curve Below Baseline**

As discussed earlier in this chapter, active exhalation may cause the expiratory portion of the volume-time curve to drop below baseline. Notice that the volume graphic may also descend below baseline if the expiratory flow sensor is out of calibration (see Fig. 18.1).

### **Patient-Ventilator Asynchrony**

Figs. 18.3 and 18.10 show graphics for a patient breathing out of synchrony with the ventilator. As mentioned earlier, patientventilator asynchrony can occur when the flow and sensitivity settings are inadequate or when auto-PEEP is present. Adjustment of these parameters or switching to a servo-controlled mode (e.g., pressure-regulated volume control) or to pressure-controlled ventilation may help alleviate the problem. In some cases, the patient may also need to be sedated.

### Case Study 18.5

### **Evaluating a Ventilator Problem**

During ventilation of a patient with VC-CMV and 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O of PEEP, the respiratory therapist notices the volumetime graphic shown in the following figure. During exhalation the respiratory therapist feels an uninterrupted flow of a small amount of air from the exhalation valve, even though the patient has had no previous evidence of air trapping. What do these findings suggest?

![](_page_15_Figure_9.jpeg)

Volume-time curve in which the volume curve descends at the beginning of exhalation and then slowly rises until the start of the next inspiratory phase.

### **UNEXPECTED VENTILATOR RESPONSES**

Problems in some microprocessor-controlled ventilators can result from inappropriate use of or idiosyncrasies associated with the machine. The following section discusses a few noteworthy situations; the intent is not to criticize any particular ventilator but rather to make the reader aware of situations that have been reported, including unseating of the exhalation valve, excessive CPAP/PEEP levels, changes in sensitivity, inability to trigger a pressure-supported breath, and altered alarm function.

### **Unseated or Obstructed Expiratory Valve**

The expiratory valve can be unseated if it is blocked to obtain a static compliance (C<sub>S</sub>) reading. (This is generally a problem only if the ventilator does not have an inspiratory pause control.) The valve is unseated because a pressure buildup during this procedure causes the exhalation valve to disengage. An unseated expiratory valve may be the cause if the ventilator inoperative alarm, a lowpressure alarm, or a low CPAP/PEEP alarm activates and the patient has difficulty breathing. It is important to mention that these same alarms can be activated by other factors; therefore the actual cause must be established.

Expiratory valves may also malfunction if they become obstructed or their mobility is impaired by an accumulation of residue from medications delivered by small-volume nebulizers.

**Fig. 18.8** Flow-volume loop reflecting the presence of auto—positive end-expiratory pressure. The *arrow* indicates the amount of flow at the end of exhalation.

The valves can be protected by placing bacterial filters in line, before the exhalation valve. Expiratory filters must be changed frequently to avoid increased expiratory resistance.

### **Excessive CPAP/PEEP**

Excessive CPAP/PEEP levels (i.e., above those set by the operator) can occur in certain clinical situations. For example, a potential problem that can occur with PSV is a sudden accidental delivery of high flow and pressure because of a leak in the breathing circuit. Application of high flow to maintain CPAP/PEEP levels can cause the airway pressure to rise, and the patient may develop dyspnea, tachypnea, and tachycardia. This problem can typically be solved by eliminating the leak.

Another problem that involves patient-circuit leaks can occur during PSV. This problem was initially reported by Fiastro and colleagues with the Puritan Bennett 7200 ventilator. If a leak of more than 5 L/min develops around the cuff of the ET or somewhere in the patient circuit, the set PSV level will be maintained throughout the cycle, causing CPAP to develop in the circuit. A decrease in flow to 5 L/min is the normal mechanism that stops the PSV inspiratory phase in this ventilator. All ventilators with PSV now have a safety mechanism. If the  $T_{\rm I}$  exceeds a preset time (approximately 3–5 seconds), the ventilator will cycle into expiration.

## Nebulizer Impairment of Patient's Ability to Trigger a Pressure-Supported Breath

During PSV the patient must create a slightly negative pressure or drop in flow in the circuit to initiate a breath. When a

**Fig. 18.10** Wide fluctuations can be seen in the pressure-time curve when the patient is actively breathing during mechanical ventilation, but the ventilator is not set up to respond to patient demand; the result is patient-ventilator asynchrony.

continuous-flow nebulizer is placed between the patient and the sensing mechanism, the patient often finds it more difficult to generate the effort to trigger the ventilator. Devices that sense ventilator triggering are usually on the inspiratory side of the ventilator. Triggering difficulty is especially apparent in older patients with COPD and weak inspiratory efforts. (NOTE: This problem may arise with microprocessor-controlled ventilators when a nebulizer powered by an external gas source is used.)

Triggering difficulty may also occur with patients during the VC-CMV when an external nebulizer is added in line. It may not be a significant clinical problem because the set rate and volume ensure the patient will receive an adequate  $\dot{V}_E$ , even if the patient does not trigger the breath. Unfortunately, there is not a backup rate with PSV and volume support ventilation.<sup>26</sup> Therefore clinicians should use only the nebulizer provided by the ventilator's manufacturer. If one is not provided, the practitioner should use an inline metered-dose inhaler with a spacer, an ultrasonic nebulizer, or a vibrating mesh nebulizer.

### **High Tidal Volume Delivery**

High  $V_T$  delivery can occur when externally powered small-volume nebulizers are used for aerosol delivery. Flow meters add flow to the patient circuit, which can increase the delivered  $V_T$  and result in artificially high readings of exhaled  $\dot{V}_E$ . Although this is not a significant problem in most situations with adults, it can be significant in neonates, and these devices should not be used for medication delivery during neonatal mechanical ventilation.

High  $V_T$  delivery can also occur in a ventilator that allows the patient to receive additional flow during inspiration on demand. Current ICU ventilators (e.g., Servo-i) provide additional flow if the airway pressure drops by 2 cm  $H_2\mathrm{O}$ . This results in a higher  $V_T$  delivery than the set value. Set values therefore actually represent minimum  $V_T$  delivery; patients can receive the volume of air they want.

### **Altered Alarm Function**

Some monitoring devices and ventilator controls operate on optical detectors. When exposed to intense light, such as sunlight through a window, the alarms may sound even though no change has occurred in the patient's status. This may happen with volume monitors, pulse oximeters, and other light-sensitive devices.

### **Electromagnetic Interference**

Electrical devices that emit radio frequencies, such as cell phones, can interfere with the operation of medical equipment. Hospitals generally prohibit the use of cell phones, two-way radios, and similar equipment in locations such as the ICU, where problems are likely to occur. These devices have been known to interfere with the function of mechanical ventilators, infusion pumps, smoke detectors, and telemetry equipment. Other medical devices that can be affected include electrocardiograph monitors and machines,  $O_2$  and apnea monitors, defibrillators, blood warmers, and dialysis units.<sup>27</sup>

When the purchase of a piece of equipment such as a mechanical ventilator is under consideration, the hospital should determine what built-in safeguards the manufacturer has provided to prevent electromagnetic interference.

### **Operator's Manuals**

The operator's manuals provided by manufacturers of microprocessor-controlled ventilators typically include valuable information that can be used to address common troubleshooting problems. These manuals are a good resource of information for troubleshooting situations that are unique to the particular ventilator being used.

### **SUMMARY**

- Problem solving can be simply defined as determining a solution to a challenging situation. The first step in solving any problem is to carefully analyze the situation at hand. The next step is to gather and assess pertinent data, which should point to a number of viable solutions.
- The sudden onset of dyspnea can be identified by observing the physical signs of respiratory distress, including tachypnea, nasal flaring, diaphoresis, use of the accessory muscles of breathing, retraction of the suprasternal, supraclavicular, and intercostal spaces, paradoxical or abnormal movement of the thorax and abdomen, and abnormal findings on auscultation.

- Identifying the cause of patient-ventilator asynchrony can be accomplished using a relatively simple approach. If the patient is in *severe* distress, the first step is to disconnect the patient from the ventilator and carefully provide ventilation to the patient using a manual resuscitation bag. When a resuscitation bag is used properly, these devices allow for the assessment of lung characteristics.
- The most common patient-related problems encountered during mechanical ventilation involve the artificial airway or the presence of a pneumothorax, bronchospasm, and excessive secretions.
- Evaluation of the patient's secretions can be useful in differentiating a variety of patient-related problems.
- Changes in the patient's position can be associated with accidental extubation, bending and twisting of the patient circuit, and in some cases alterations in the patient's level of oxygenation.
- $\bullet$  Activation of low-pressure, low-volume, and low- $V_E$  alarms typically indicates that a leak in the patient-ventilator circuit is present.
- Circuit leaks typically occur at the level of the ET and at junctions in the patient circuit where tube connections exist.
- In addition to an inappropriate sensitivity setting and inadequate flow, other types of patient-ventilator asynchrony can be associated with auto-PEEP, an increased ventilatory drive, or the need for sedation.
- Activation of an apnea alarm may indicate patient apnea or patient disconnection, system leaks, inadequate machine sensitivity, or inappropriately set apnea parameters.
- A low-source gas alarm activates if the gas source fails or the high-pressure line becomes disconnected from the gas source.
- Conditions leading to activation of high-pressure alarms can be categorized as airway problems, changes in lung characteristics or patient-related conditions, and problems related to the patient-ventilator circuit.
- An error message or alarm (or both) is triggered if the operator tries to select a setting that is outside the range for that parameter or is incompatible with the other selected settings.
- Ventilator graphic displays can provide valuable information that clinicians can use to evaluate the integrity of the patientventilator system.
- Careful analysis is required to solve patient-ventilator system problems and troubleshoot malfunctions.
- Experience is an important part of the learning process. By using the knowledge gained through experience, practitioners can expand their ability to solve a particular problem.

The patient is admitted to the ICU, and ventilatory support is provided using volume control ventilation (VC-CMV) with 100% O<sub>2</sub>. The PIP has been increasing progressively over the past 4 hours. Auscultation of the patient's chest reveals an absence of breath sounds over the left lung and distant breath sounds over the right lung.
