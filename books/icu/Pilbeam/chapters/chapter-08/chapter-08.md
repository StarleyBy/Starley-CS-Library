On completion of this chapter, the reader will be able to do the following:

- 1. Understand the importance of performing an operational verification procedure.
- 2. State the recommended times when an oxygen analyzer is used to measure the fractional inspired oxygen concentration (F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) during mechanical ventilation.
- 3. Identify various pathophysiological conditions that alter a patient's transairway pressure, peak pressure, and plateau
- 4. Use pressure-time and flow-time curves obtained during pressure-controlled continuous mandatory ventilation to determine the plateau pressure.
- 5. Identify a system leak from a volume-time curve.
- 6. Use physical examination and radiographic data to determine whether pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, flail chest, pneumothorax, asthma, pleural effusion, or emphysema is
- 7. Determine whether a lung compliance problem or an airway resistance problem is present, using the ventilator flow sheet and

- time, volume, peak inspiratory pressure, and plateau pressure
- 8. Evaluate a static pressure—volume curve for static compliance and dynamic compliance to determine changes in compliance or resistance.
- 9. Estimate a patient's alveolar ventilation based on ideal body weight, tidal volume, and respiratory rate.
- 10. Detect a cuff leak by listening to breath sounds.
- 11. Recognize inappropriate endotracheal tube cuff pressures and an inappropriate tube size and recommend measures to correct these problems.

ssessing a patient's oxygenation status, respiratory rate, breathing pattern, use of accessory muscles, chest movement, and breath sounds, along with estimates of work of breathing (WOB) and evaluation of the patient's level of consciousness, can provide valuable information about a patient's physiological status. These observations, along with information derived from ventilator displays and hemodynamic monitoring, are among the first assessments the clinician records for a patient who is undergoing mechanical ventilation.<sup>1</sup>

This chapter reviews assessment and documentation of patient-ventilator interactions after a patient has been placed on a mechanical ventilator. The first step in this process involves verification of the physician's orders for initiating mechanical ventilator support (Box 8.1). Once the physician's orders have been verified, the respiratory therapist ensures that the designated ventilator has passed an **operational verification procedure** (OVP). The OVP process is typically described in the respiratory therapy department's policies and procedures manual.

It is important that the respiratory therapy department maintains records showing the OVP history for each ventilator. In addition, a label or form should be attached to each ventilator showing when the OVP was performed, by whom, and whether the ventilator passed the multiple-part test. Newer microprocessor-controlled ventilators are designed to perform a series of automated self-tests once the operator initiates the self-test process. This self-test record may be part of the OVP.

The equipment evaluation process should also involve checking the integrity of the ventilator circuit and humidifier system and ensuring that related equipment has been correctly attached and tested to ensure that the system is free of leaks (Box 8.2).

# DOCUMENTATION OF THE PATIENT-VENTILATOR SYSTEM

In addition to documentation of the OVP, patient information and ventilator settings should be documented regularly when a patient

# BOX **8.1**

### **Physician's Orders for Mechanical Ventilation**

The orders written by the physician for mechanical ventilation settings vary among institutions. In some instances the physician's orders may be specific, with little flexibility for respiratory therapist involvement. More commonly, the physician orders simply request a particular protocol for mechanical ventilation, which is then followed by the respiratory therapist, nurse, and other staff members involved with the care of the patient.<sup>2</sup>

The orders or protocol should include at least one (and preferably both) of the following:

- Desired range for the arterial CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure (P<sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>) or end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure (P<sub>ET</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>), and/or for the arterial oxygen partial pressure (P<sub>a</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), arterial oxygen saturation (S<sub>a</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry (S<sub>p</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), or transcutaneous oxygen partial pressure (P<sub>1r</sub>O<sub>2</sub>).
- Ventilator variables to be initiated or manipulated to achieve the desired arterial blood gases (e.g., mode, tidal volume [V<sub>T</sub>], respiratory rate [f], set pressure, and fractional inspired oxygen [F<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub>]) while protecting the lung.

is receiving ventilatory support. These data can be recorded on a computer software program with specific entry fields or kept as a paper record. Regardless of the form it takes, the document often is called a **ventilator flow sheet**.

The frequency of patient-ventilator system checks depends on the institution's policy. They are generally performed every 1 to 4 hours. In addition to this schedule, patient-ventilator system checks are performed as follows:

- Before an arterial blood gas (ABG) sample is drawn
- When the physician has entered new orders
- Before hemodynamic data or bedside pulmonary function data are measured
- After a ventilator change has been made
- If an acute change occurs in the patient's condition (such changes should be documented as soon as possible after the event)
- After a patient returns from testing (e.g., x-ray or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI])
- Whenever the ventilator's performance is questionable

It is important to recognize that **patient-ventilator system checks** represent a documented evaluation of the ventilator's function and the patient's response to ventilatory support. The following points regarding patient-ventilator system checks should be emphasized:

- Data relevant to the patient-ventilator system check are recorded on the appropriate hospital form and are part of the patient's medical record.
- The patient-ventilator system check includes observations of ventilator settings at the time of the check.
- The record should include the physician's order for mechanical ventilator settings.
- The patient-ventilator system check includes a brief narrative of the clinical observations of the patient's response to mechanical ventilation at the time of the check.

Fig. 8.1 shows a typical ventilator flow sheet used to record patient-ventilator system check data. The top of the form contains

# **BOX 8.2** Simple Verification of Ventilator Operation

A simple ventilator check should be performed:

- Before connecting a patient to a ventilator for the first time.
- Before reconnecting the patient to a ventilator if the circuit has been changed or disassembled for any reason.

The operational verification procedure should also include checking the system for leaks before the patient is connected to the ventilator. To check for leaks, the operator should:

- Set the tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>) at 500 mL, the gas flow low (e.g., 20 L/min), the maximum pressure limit high (e.g., 100 -120 cm H<sub>2</sub>O), and an inspiratory pause of 1 to 2 seconds.
- Occlude the Y-connector, cycle the ventilator, and observe the airway pressure rise and pause on the pressure manometer; if no leak is present, the circuit will hold the pressure steady.
- Change the ventilator settings to those appropriate for the patient before connecting the patient to the ventilator.
- Newer microprocessor-controlled ventilators automatically perform a test to check for leaks in the patient-ventilator circuit. This test can be performed at any time, but the patient must be disconnected from the ventilator to perform the test.

basic patient information, including the patient's name and anthropometric data (e.g., age, weight, height, ideal body weight [IBW], body surface area), medical record identification number, patient's diagnosis, name of the attending physician along with the physician's orders, date of intubation, ventilator start date, and ventilator day (number of days on the ventilator).

The form will typically include spaces for entering current information about the patient and measurements of ventilator parameters. These may include the following:

- Date
- Time
- · Mode of ventilation

- Minute ventilation (V<sub>E</sub>)
- Respiratory rate (f)
- Tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>)
- Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP)
- Plateau pressure (Pplat)
- Static compliance (C<sub>s</sub>)
- Airway resistance (Raw)
- Fractional inspired oxygen (F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)
- · Temperatures of inspired gases
- Inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio
- Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP)
- · Inspiratory and end-expiratory positive airway pressures
- Arterial blood gases (ABGs)
- Alveolar-to-arterial partial pressure of oxygen (P<sub>[A-a]</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) or ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (P<sub>a</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/F<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)
- Vital capacity (VC)
- · Maximum inspiratory pressure
- Vital signs
- · Alarm settings

Volumes, pressures, temperature, vital signs, and  $F_1O_2$  are measured during each patient-ventilator system check. Most intensive care unit (ICU) ventilators have  $O_2$  analyzers that provide continuous monitoring of  $F_1O_2$ . In cases in which continuous  $F_1O_2$  measurements are not available on a particular ventilator, intermittent measurements of  $F_1O_2$  are usually sufficient for adult patients.  $F_1O_2$  should be continuously monitored, however, for infants receiving mechanical ventilation. Alarms should be regularly checked to ensure they have been set appropriately. ABGs, shunt fraction,  $P_{(A-a)}O_2$ , and  $P_aO_2/F_1O_2$  should be determined when the patient's condition or the ventilator settings change significantly.

Regular, accurate documentation of patient-ventilator system checks are essential for the effective use of mechanical ventilation and for maintaining patient safety.<sup>2-4</sup> Case Study 8.1 provides a clinical scenario illustrating the importance of maintaining accurate patient-ventilator records.

# Case Study 8.1

### The Importance of Documentation

A 38-year-old woman is intubated for respiratory failure secondary to severe pneumonia. After 24 hours her status improves. The endotracheal tube is kept in place to allow suctioning, because she has large amounts of secretions. On the third day after intubation, her respiratory status declines. She has a cardiac arrest and is resuscitated but suffers brain injury as a result. She dies several weeks later.

The family hires an attorney. At issue is the fact that in the medical record, the respiratory therapist's notes with the ventilator flow sheet indicate that the patient had been suctioned about every 2 hours for large amounts of thick, yellow secretions. However, during the 8 hours before the arrest, nowhere did the notes state that the patient had been suctioned. The therapist states that he had suctioned the patient but had not recorded it in the chart. Was the therapist negligent and did his actions lead to the wrongful death of the patient?

**Key Point 8.1** Positive pressure ventilation can reduce venous return to the heart, cardiac output, and blood pressure. (See Chapter 16 for more information on the cardiovascular effects of mechanical ventilation.)

#### THE FIRST 30 MINUTES

Immediately after the patient is connected to a mechanical ventilator, the clinician should perform auscultation of the patient's chest to confirm adequate volume delivery and proper placement of the endotracheal tube (ET). The patient's vital signs are checked, making particular note of heart rate and blood pressure, because mechanical ventilation may affect these parameters (Key Point 8.1). The alarms (e.g., apnea, low pressure, low  $V_T$ , and high pressure limit) are activated. An arterial blood sample is obtained about 15 minutes after mechanical ventilation is initiated for evaluation of the effectiveness of ventilation and oxygenation. <sup>5,6</sup> If not already done, a chest radiograph is obtained to confirm proper placement of the ET. Box 8.3 lists other clinical laboratory tests a physician might order to assess the patient's status when mechanical ventilation is initiated. <sup>3</sup>

Once the patient assessment shows the individual is stable, the respiratory therapist then performs the first ventilator check.

#### Mode

The mode of ventilation is recorded in the appropriate space on the ventilator flow sheet. It may be recorded as follows:

- Volume-controlled continuous mandatory ventilation (VC-CMV)
- Pressure-controlled continuous mandatory ventilation (PC-CMV)
- Intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV), using either volume-controlled ventilation (VC-IMV) or pressurecontrolled ventilation (PC-IMV), with or without pressure support ventilation (PSV)
- Pressure-regulated volume control (PRVC)\*
- Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV)
- PSV, volume support (VS), CPAP, unsupported spontaneous ventilation (these are spontaneous modes)
- Bilevel positive airway pressure (bilevel PAP; noninvasive positive pressure ventilation [NIV])

# Clinical Laboratory Tests for Initial Assessment

The following clinical laboratory tests may be included in the initial evaluation of the patient:

- · Complete blood count
- Blood chemistries (glucose, sodium, potassium, chloride, CO<sub>2</sub>, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, phosphate, magnesium)
- Prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio (PT/PTT/INR), and platelet count
- · Blood, sputum, and urine cultures

<sup>\*</sup>Other names associated with this mode include *AutoFlow* (Dräger V500) and *VC*+ (Medtronics Puritan Bennett 840 and 980 ventilators).

**Fig. 8.2** Measurement of tidal volume (VT) at the endotracheal tube (ET). The respirometer is attached to the ET so that the patient's actual exhaled air can be measured. The respirometer can also be attached at the exhalation valve, but those readings would include compressible volume from the ventilator circuit in addition to volume from the patient's lungs.

# **Sensitivity**

If a patient-triggered mode is used (i.e., inspiration is initiated by patient effort), the pressure or flow required to trigger the ventilation should be checked; no more than -1 or -2 cm  $H_2O$  should be required. If the ventilator is flow triggered, the sensitivity should be set so that the ventilator will trigger at a flow change of 2 to 3 L/min. The ventilator should be checked for autotriggering, and the patient's ability to trigger a breath should be assessed. Adjustments are made as needed.

As discussed previously, when auto-PEEP is present, the patient has more difficulty triggering breaths. The presence of auto-PEEP should be suspected if the patient is using his accessory muscles of inspiration or demonstrates labored breathing. Ventilator graphics that show failure of the expiratory flow to return to zero before the next breath are also an indicator of auto-PEEP (see Chapter 9).

If auto-PEEP is present, a number of strategies can be used to reduce its effects, including increasing the flow (reducing the inspiratory time  $[T_I]$ ), reducing  $V_T$ , or reducing the rate [i.e., reducing  $\dot{V}_E$ ]), suctioning the patient, or changing modes to allow for more spontaneous breaths. It is important to recognize that it may not always be possible to eliminate auto-PEEP, particularly in patients with increased flow resistance and airway closure. The addition of extrinsic PEEP (PEEP<sub>E</sub>) in these cases may make triggering easier (see Fig. 7.1). PEEP<sub>E</sub> is increased progressively during VC-CMV until the patient's use of accessory muscles diminishes or until PIP and  $P_{plat}$  begin to rise. (Additional information about treatment of auto-PEEP can be found in Chapter 17.)

### Tidal Volume, Rate, and Minute Ventilation

 $V_T$ , f, and  $\dot{V}_E$  are typically displayed digitally on the front panel of the ventilator in the data display window. Most ventilators display the set  $V_T$  ( $V_{Tset}$ ) and the exhaled  $V_T$  ( $V_{Texh}$ ). Newer microprocessor-controlled ventilators provide excellent, reliable flow and pressure monitoring. If this information is not available,

BOX **8.4** 

# Respirometer Technique for Measuring Tidal Volume (VT) and Minute Ventilation (VE)

Modern microprocessor-controlled ventilators provide digital displays for the clinician to monitor a patient's tidal volume and minute ventilation. Before the introduction of these devices, clinicians typically relied on handheld respirometers to measure these variables. The procedure for measuring  $V_{\text{T}}$  and  $\dot{V}_{\text{E}}$  with a respirometer is relatively easy to accomplish.

- The respirometer is connected directly to the patient's endotracheal tube and Y-connector of the ventilator circuit (see Fig. 8.2). This allows easy measurement of the V<sub>T</sub> that does not have to be corrected for compressible volume from the ventilator circuit. (NOTE: In cases in which the V<sub>T</sub> was measured at the expiratory port, the compressible volume [volume lost to C<sub>T</sub>] must be subtracted from the V<sub>T</sub> reading on the respirometer.)
- Gas exhaled from the lungs is measured for 1 minute, and the f is simultaneously counted.  $\dot{V}_E$  can be calculated ( $\dot{V}_E = V_T \times f$ ) or measured directly. If the patient is receiving intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV), the total  $\dot{V}_E$  is measured. Mandatory  $V_T$  and f can be measured separately, and mandatory  $\dot{V}_E$  can be subtracted from the total  $\dot{V}_E$  to determine a patient's spontaneous  $\dot{V}_E$ .

 $V_{T}$  can be measured using a handheld bedside pulmonary function device or other volume-measuring device (e.g., respirometer) and a watch or clock with a sweep second hand. Although this technique is generally used only with older ventilators, it can also be used to verify digital readouts if a question arises about the machine's reliability (Fig. 8.2 and Box 8.4).

# **Correcting Tubing Compliance**

Accurate reporting of volumes requires correction for volume loss within the patient circuit because of the effects of tubing compliance (also called *compressible volume*). As discussed in Chapter 6, tubing compliance ( $C_T$ ) for most ventilator circuits ranges from about 1.5 to 2.5 mL/cm  $H_2O$ .

Most microprocessor-controlled ventilators (e.g., Medtronics Puritan Bennett 840 [Medtronics Minimally Invasive Therapies], Servo-i [Getinge, Göteborg, Sweden]) do not require calculation of tubing compliance because these machines automatically compensate for this factor. As discussed previously, ventilators that perform this function typically increase the delivered volume so that the set volume is the amount provided to the patient (i.e., the digital readout indicates the  $V_{\rm T}$  actually delivered to the patient's airway). With older ventilators, the operator can set the value for the circuit's  $C_{\rm T}$  and the ventilator will add volume to the  $V_{\rm Tset}$  to compensate for volume loss because of tubing compliance.

## **Alveolar Ventilation**

Monitoring of alveolar ventilation ( $\dot{V}_A$ ) has declined in popularity in recent years because many acute care facilities do not include this variable on the ventilator flow sheet. Unfortunately, its importance is often overlooked when using low  $V_T$  strategies. Inline heat-moisture exchangers (HMEs), closed suction systems, and other circuit adapters and equipment can add mechanical dead space ( $V_{Dmech}$ ) to the ventilator circuit and affect the  $V_D/V_T$ . Knowledge of the effect of dead space on alveolar volume delivery can be particularly important in infants, children, and smaller adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\*

The following two factors must be considered in determining alveolar ventilation:

- 1. Anatomical dead space
- 2. Mechanical dead space

## **Dead Space**

Normal anatomical dead space ( $V_{Danat}$ ) is about 1 mL/lb IBW. Bypassing the upper airway with an artificial airway reduces  $V_{Danat}$  by about half. Using a Y-connector, additional flex tubing between the Y-connector and the ET, or an HME adds mechanical dead space.

# **Added Mechanical Dead Space**

Because HMEs or other adapters attached to the ET (Fig. 8.3) add to  $V_{\rm Dmech}$ , the volume of these devices, along with the  $V_{\rm Danat}$ , must be subtracted from the  $V_{\rm T}$  to determine actual alveolar ventilation (Box 8.5). For example, if a 150-lb adult has a  $V_{\rm T}$  of 500 mL and the added  $V_{\rm Dmech}$  is 100 mL, the alveolar ventilation for each breath would be:

 $VT - V_{Dmech} - V_{Danat} = 500mL - 100 - 150mL = 250mL \text{ (Key Point 8.2)}$ 

**Key Point 8.2** The volume of mechanical dead space can be easily measured for any device added to a ventilator circuit. The device is simply filled with water and then emptied into a graduated container; the volume measured is the volume of mechanical dead space for the device. (A piece of equipment [i.e., tubing] similar to that being placed on the patient should be used for this type of measurement.)

![](_page_6_Figure_18.jpeg)

**Fig. 8.3** Airway pressure waveform during volume control ventilation. An endinspiratory breath hold and an end-expiratory breath hold are applied to measure the plateau pleasure and auto-PEEP, respectively. Note the difference between the peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) and plateau pressure ( $P_{plat}$ ); this is the transairway pressure ( $P_{TA}$ ), which is produced by the interaction of the set flow and airway resistance. The  $V_T$  is the product of the pressure difference between  $P_{plat}$  and total PEEP (set PEEP and auto-PEEP) and lung compliance. (From Hess DR, MacIntyre NR, Mishoe SC, et al: *Respiratory care principles and practice,* Philadelphia, PA, 2002, WB Saunders.)

# BOX **8.5**

# **Added Mechanical Dead Space**

Some patient situations require the addition of a small amount of mechanical dead space. For example, in Fig. 7.3 a small circuit has been added at the Y-connector to allow for intermittent use of a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) without removing the heat and heat-moisture exchanger (HME) or disconnecting the circuit.

Excessive turbulence at the upper airway and Y-connector can sometimes produce a pressure spike at the beginning of a breath during pressure-targeted ventilation. This has been noted with Vyaire LTV-1000 ventilator in a clinical situation. Autotriggering occasionally occurs in this same ventilator. These two phenomena can be prevented in most cases by adding about 2 inches of corrugated tubing between the Y-connector and endotracheal tube (or between the HME and the endotracheal tube) but must be accounted for as additional V<sub>Dmech</sub>.

# Final Alveolar Ventilation

During VC-CMV (A/C),  $\dot{V}_A$  is calculated by multiplying the number of breaths counted for 1 minute by the corrected  $V_T$ :  $\dot{V}_A = (V_T - V_{Danat} - \text{Added } V_{Dmech}) \times \text{f.}$  When a patient is on VC-IMV, the mandatory rate and volume delivery must be calculated separately from the patient's spontaneous rate and volume; these values are then added to determine the total  $\dot{V}_E$  (Box 8.6).

#### **MONITORING AIRWAY PRESSURES**

All positive pressure ventilators have a pressure monitor or display that continuously shows the upper airway pressure. The pressure monitor is probably most accurate when it shows pressures

<sup>\*</sup>Physiological dead space is reviewed in Appendix B.

# BOX **8.6**

## Calculation of Alveolar Ventilation in VC-IMV

Calculations are made using the following data:

- Intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) rate = 5 breaths/ min
- Tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>) = 600 mL
- Anatomical dead space (V<sub>Danat</sub>) = 100 mL
- Added mechanical dead space (V<sub>Dmech</sub>) = 50 mL
- Mandatory alveolar ventilation per minute ( $\dot{V}_A$ ) = 5 × [600 100 50] = 2250 mL or 2.25 L/min
- Patient spontaneous rate = 10 breaths/min
- Spontaneous  $V_T = 350 \text{ mL}$
- Spontaneous alveolar ventilation = 10  $\times$  [350 100 50] = 2000 mL or 2 L
- Total alveolar ventilation = 2.25 + 2 = 4.25 L/min

measured near the patient's upper airway, because this eliminates the effects of the humidifying device and the breathing circuit on the measurement. Proximal pressure measurements are obtained by connecting the monitor tubing (usually a small-diameter plastic tube) to the Y-connector of the patient circuit. If the tubing is not visible on the circuit, pressures are detected through the main patient circuit and not at the upper airway. Although these values are not measured at the proximal airway, p ventilators are generally accurate and clinically useful<sup>1</sup> (Key Point 8.3).

**Key Point 8.3** Proximal pressure and flow monitor lines must be free of moisture and secretions to provide accurate readings.

Pressure monitoring allows the clinician to assess pressure delivery to the upper airway. It ensures that a minimal pressure is maintained (low-pressure limit) and that high-pressure limits are not exceeded during mechanical ventilation. Intermittent readings of PIP,  $P_{\text{plat}}$ , set pressure (for pressure-targeted modes such as PCCMV and pressure support), transairway pressure ( $P_{\text{TA}} = \text{PIP} - P_{\text{plat}}$ ), mean airway pressure  $P_{\text{aw}}$ , and end-expiratory pressure (EEP) can provide valuable information about the patient's condition.

### **Peak Inspiratory Pressure**

PIP (or  $P_{peak}$ ), which is the highest pressure observed during inspiration, can be used to calculate dynamic compliance ( $C_D$ ; also called *dynamic characteristic*). A fairly constant  $V_T$  with an increasing  $P_{peak}$  may indicate a reduction in lung compliance ( $C_L$ ) or an increase in  $R_{aw}$ . Conversely, a declining PIP may indicate a leak or may be a sign of improvement in compliance or resistance.

### **Plateau Pressure**

A  $P_{plat}$  reading can be obtained by using the ventilator's inspiratory pause control or setting a pause time of about 0.5 to 1.5 seconds. Remember that the static pressure is read when no gas flow is occurring. Traditionally,  $P_{plat}$  was determined by occluding the ventilator's expiratory port at the end of inspiration and reading the pressure registered on the ventilator's pressure manometer. After PIP is reached, the manometer needle or pressure indicator shows a drop of a few centimeters from peak and then briefly remains in a plateau (static) position before dropping

**Key Point 8.4** Current practice strongly recommends keeping P<sub>plat</sub> below 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O to avoid ventilator-induced lung injury.

to zero (see Fig. 8.3). It is important to remember that  $P_{plat}$  cannot be measured accurately if the patient makes active respiratory efforts, has a high f, or resists extending  $T_{\rm I}$ ; therefore, measurement of  $P_{plat}$  is difficult, if not impossible, to obtain in spontaneously breathing individuals.

 $P_{plat}$  is most often used to calculate  $C_{S}$ , which reflects the elastic recoil of the alveoli and thoracic cage against the volume of air in the patient's lungs. Current practice strongly recommends keeping  $P_{plat}$  below 30 cm  $H_2O$  (Key Point 8.4). Notice that during either pressure or volume ventilation, if a condition of no gas flow occurs near the end of inspiration (i.e., the flow—time waveform graphic shows a reading of zero), the corresponding pressure on the pressure-time curve is an indicator of  $P_{plat}$  (Fig. 8.4 and Key Point 8.5).

**Key Point 8.5** Remember that flow occurs because of a pressure difference between two points. If the pressure is the same at any two points within a tube or conductive airway, no flow will occur between those points.

#### **Set Pressure**

During PC-CMV, PC-IMV, and PSV the operator sets a target pressure to be delivered to the patient. As shown in Fig. 8.1, many institutions include a separate space on the flow sheet for entering the target pressure.

# Transairway Pressure: PIP Minus Pplat

The difference between the PIP and  $P_{plat}$  readings (PIP –  $P_{plat}$ ) is the transairway pressure ( $P_{TA}$ ).  $P_{TA}$  is the amount of pressure required to overcome  $R_{aw}$  ( $R_{aw} = P_{TA}/Flow$ ). Notice that  $P_{TA}$  includes the resistance of the ET. A higher than expected difference between PIP and  $P_{plat}$  suggests an increased  $R_{aw}$ .  $R_{aw}$  most often increases when the patient's airway requires suctioning, the patient is biting the tube or it is kinked, or the patient has mucosal edema or bronchospasms (or both). It may also increase if the HME is partially occluded by accumulation of moisture or secretions.

# **Mean Airway Pressure**

Many of the newer microprocessor-controlled ventilators automatically calculate and display  $\overline{P}_{aw}$ .  $\overline{P}_{aw}$  is affected by PIP, endexpiratory pressure, the duty cycle ( $T_I$ /total cycle time [TCT]), and f. Inspiratory flow patterns and modes can also influence  $\overline{P}_{aw}$ . Monitoring  $\overline{P}_{aw}$  can be useful when examining the benefits and side effects of positive pressure ventilation because it closely parallels the mean alveolar pressure. As discussed later in Chapter 13, the  $\overline{P}_{aw}$  influences tissue oxygenation and affects both lung volumes and cardiac output. (See Chapter 13 for additional information for the calculation of  $\overline{P}_{aw}$ .)

# **End-Expiratory Pressure**

End-expiratory pressure (EEP) is the lowest pressure measured during the expiratory phase of a breath. The EEP is above atmospheric pressure when PEEP $_{\rm E}$  or CPAP is administered. EEP is also elevated when auto-PEEP occurs.

**Fig. 8.4** (A) VC-CMV with an inspiratory pause set. *Top curve,* Flow-time curve. *Middle curve,* Volume-time curve. *Bottom curve,* Pressure-time curve. After PIP, P<sub>max</sub> is reached and the pressure drops to a plateau (begins at P<sub>1</sub> and ends at P<sub>2</sub>). At the same time, inspiratory flow delivery ends and the flow drops to zero. The exhalation valve does not open until the end of the pause time. Expiratory flow does not occur until then. (B) PC-CMV in which flow drops to zero during inspiration before the exhalation valve opens. The pressure measured during the no-flow period is an indicator of P<sub>plat</sub>. (NOTE: For a plateau to be visible in PC-CMV, T<sub>1</sub> must be long enough to allow ventilator pressure and lung pressure to equilibrate. If no pressure difference exists, no flow occurs.) (A from Pelosip P, Cereda M, Foti G, et al.: Alterations of lung and chest wall mechanics in patients with acute lung injury: effects of positive end-expiratory pressure, *Am J Respir Crit Care Med* 152:531—537, 1995. B from MacIntyre NR, Branson RD: *Mechanical ventilation*, ed 2, Philadelphia, PA, 2009, Saunders.)

An expiratory pause maneuver can be used to measure auto-PEEP, and most ventilators have a control for this purpose. The expiratory pause typically lasts 0.5 to 1.5 seconds, but some ventilators allow a pause of up to 15 to 20 seconds. As with the  $P_{plat}$  measurement, the EEP reading is accurate only if the patient is *not* actively breathing.

Sometimes the total PEEP (PEEP $_{TOT}$ ), which is the sum of the PEEP $_{E}$  and auto-PEEP, is recorded on the flow sheet. It is important to understand that PEEP $_{TOT}$  must be subtracted from P $_{plat}$  to calculate  $C_{S}$  and from PIP to calculate  $C_{D}$  (Key Point 8.6).

An airway pressure slightly greater than zero can occur at the upper airway during exhalation if a constant gas flow is moving through the circuit. This constant flow is referred to as *bias flow* or *base flow*. It is used to help the ventilator detect flow changes during exhalation and allow flow triggering (see Chapter 3).

In most modern ventilators, bias flow occurs only at the end of exhalation; consequently, no resistance to flow exists at the

**Key Point 8.6** PEEP<sub>TOT</sub> must be subtracted from  $P_{plat}$  to calculate  $C_{S_r}$  and from PIP to calculate  $C_{D_r}$ .

beginning of exhalation. (Microprocessor-controlled ventilators include software that corrects for bias flow, which does not appear in the graphics for the pressure-time and flow-time curves.) For example, the Vyaire LTV 1000 ventilator (Vyaire Medical Inc.) has a constant bias flow of gas during exhalation of 10 L/min. Note that a flow of 10 L/min is the current base flow for the LTV 1000. The manufacturer may change this value in the future. The presence of bias flow is usually not clinically significant and does not cause increased resistance to exhalation except in small infants, in whom it can increase WOB.

### **Driving Pressure**

Driving pressure is the pressure difference between P<sub>plat</sub> and total PEEP (PEEP plus auto-PEEP). It has been proposed that the driving pressure represents the distending pressure and therefore reflects the amount of energy applied to the lung. Thus, the higher the distending pressure applied to the lung, the greater the potential for lung injury. It has been suggested that the driving pressure should be maintained below 15 cm H<sub>2</sub>O as part of lung protective strategies used in the treatment of ARDS (see Chapter 13 for additional information related to the treatment of ARDS).

### **Pressure Limit**

Audible and visual alarms are activated if PIP exceeds a set limit (this setting usually is about 10 cm  $\rm H_2O$  above PIP). Activation of the high-pressure limit alarm ends inspiration. Some newer ventilators have an alarm delay that allows the limit to be exceeded for two or three breaths before the audible portion of the alarm is activated. It is worth noting, however, that in instances in which the pressure limit is exceeded, the breath ends and flow to the patient stops for that breath.

It is important to recognize that although high-pressure alarms are frequently activated when the patient coughs, activation of the alarm may indicate an increase in  $R_{aw}$  or a decrease in  $C_L$ . As mentioned earlier, increases in  $R_{aw}$  may signal that the patient's

# BOX **8.7**

# **False Pressure Readings or Alarm Failure**

False pressure readings can occur if the tubing leading to the pressure indicator (whether digital or an analog manometer) is twisted or plugged with water or secretions. This is especially true for ventilators with plastic monitoring tubes that attach close to the Y-connector (proximal pressure lines). These monitoring lines measure pressure and may also detect flow, which in some cases is used to trigger the ventilator.

Manufacturers typically use air purging to maintain the patency of these monitoring lines. They also recommend that connection tubes are mounted above the endotracheal connection to prevent entry of water and secretions. Regardless of the setup, respiratory therapists should be vigilant about checking this type of monitoring system.

![](_page_9_Picture_10.jpeg)

## Case Study 8.2

#### **Circuit Disconnect**

The cardiac monitor on a mechanically ventilated patient suddenly activates. The patient demonstrates sinus tachycardia. The nurse and respiratory therapist check the patient but do not immediately find the cause of the tachycardia. The nurse pulls back the bedding sheet covering the patient's upper chest and discovers that the patient is disconnected from the ventilator. What probably prevented the ventilator's low-pressure alarm from activating?

airway needs suctioning, that bronchospasm is occurring, or that the patient is biting the tube. Decreased  $C_L$  is associated with a number of conditions, such as pulmonary edema, pneumonia, pleural effusion, and pneumothorax.

### **Low-Pressure Alarm**

Audible and visual alarms alert the clinician when PIP falls below a designated level (this setting is usually 5—10 cm  $\rm H_2O$  below PIP). These alarms indicate that the pressure has fallen significantly and are usually associated with a leak in the patient-ventilator circuit. The most common cause of a leak is patient disconnection from the ventilator, which typically can be easily seen and quickly corrected. If a leak in the patient-ventilator circuit is not obvious, the patient must be manually ventilated with a resuscitation bag until the respiratory therapist can identify the cause of the leak (Box 8.7 and Case Study 8.2).

# **Checking the Circuit: Checking for Leaks**

Evaluation of the integrity of the ventilator circuit is part of a standard ventilator check. It includes checking for leaks, disconnected tubing, and other circuit problems.

A leak can be identified in a number of ways. The simplest way is to note whether the peak pressure and exhaled volume are lower than previous measurements. The volume-time waveform can also be checked; if it resembles an igloo, the inspired  $V_T$  is greater than the expired  $V_T$  (Fig. 8.5).

To find a leak, the practitioner first should check the patient's airway by listening over the trachea with a stethoscope to determine whether the ET or tracheostomy tube cuff is adequately inflated. (If the cuff is not adequately inflated, abnormal breathing sounds will be heard as air leaks around the ET.) The clinician should then check for leaks in the ventilator circuit, starting at the point where the patient circuit attaches to the ventilator outlet and working toward the exhalation valve. Before beginning the test, it is prudent to hyperventilate and hyperoxygenate the patient. The patient is then disconnected from the ventilator and his or her lungs are manually ventilated with a resuscitation bag by another respiratory therapist or a nurse (Key Point 8.7).

**Key Point 8.7** Disconnecting a patient from the ventilator can result in hypoventilation, hypoxemia, bradycardia, and/or hypotension. Before disconnecting the patient, it is prudent to hyperventilate and hyperoxygenate to reduce the risk for these complications.<sup>2</sup>

![](_page_9_Figure_22.jpeg)

**Fig. 8.5** Volume-time waveform during VC-CMV. Note that inspired tidal volume ( $V_{Tinsp}$ ) is greater than expired  $V_T$  ( $V_{Texh}$ ). All the volume measures are the same; therefore the leak is constant. Note that the software program for this waveform causes the line to drop to baseline before another breath is delivered.

The procedure for identifying the origin of a leak is fairly straightforward. First, the Y-connector is occluded and the ventilator is cycled. If the high-pressure limit is not reached, a significant leak is present. Second, the main inspiratory tubing on the distal side of the humidifier (the side farthest from the ventilator) is pinched closed. If the PIP alarm sounds, a leak does not exist in the humidifier system between the respiratory therapist's hand and the ventilator. If the alarm does not sound, the leak is in the humidifier assembly or at the point where the circuit attaches to the ventilator or to the humidifier. Third, the large-bore expiratory line is pinched shut and the ventilator is cycled manually. If the PIP limit alarm fails to activate, the leak is located near the Yconnector. This technique works well for large leaks but may not be as useful for identifying smaller leaks.

Leaks most often occur around the humidifier, through humidifier water-feed lines, at water traps, or anywhere tubing connections join. Other possible sources are closed-suction catheters, in-line thermometers, and end-tidal carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) monitors. A normal leak may be present around the ET if the minimum leak technique (MLT) is used to inflate the cuff (Box 8.8<sup>10,11</sup> and Case Study 8.3). The leak associated with the MLT is usually insignificant, and little volume is lost with adult patients. A chest tube may be another source of leaks. A pleural drainage system is a likely source if a leak is detected with the volume-time waveform but cannot be found in the circuit.

# BOX 8.8 Minimum Leak and Minimum Occlusion **Techniques for Cuff Inflation**

Two techniques are commonly used to inflate tube cuffs:

- 1. Minimum occlusion technique (MOT). The cuff is inflated during positive pressure ventilation until no leak is heard at end inspiration. The leak is detected by listening with a stethoscope over the suprasternal notch or lateral neck. With MOT, just enough measured volume is injected into the cuff to stop all leakage around the cuff, resulting in the lowest cuff pressure needed to create a seal. The required volume is then recorded. (NOTE: Increasing the volume to slightly above that needed to occlude the airway can significantly increase cuff pressure.)
- 2. Minimum leak technique (MLT). The cuff is inflated during positive pressure ventilation until a leak is no longer heard on inspiration. A small amount of air is removed from the cuff so that the leak can just be heard at end inspiration. Some clinicians prefer MOT because of concerns about aspiration with MLT. Although MLT can provide low cuff pressures in some situations, it cannot do so if the cycling pressure necessary to achieve tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>) delivery is too high. This occurs in patients with low lung compliance (C<sub>1</sub>) or high airway resistance (R<sub>aw</sub>), in which case a significant amount of volume may be lost. A solution may be simply to increase the set volume on the ventilator to compensate for the volume loss. During VC-CMV, the amount of the leak that occurs with MLT changes as the peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) changes. If MLT is used when PIP is high and PIP gradually decreases, cuff volume eventually becomes higher than necessary. The leak actually may be eliminated, and MLT would have to be performed again. Conversely, if MLT is used at low PIP, the leak becomes too great if P<sub>peak</sub> increases (see Case Study 8.3).

![](_page_10_Picture_10.jpeg)

# Case Study 8.3

# **Cuff Inflation Techniques**

The minimum leak technique (MLT) has been used to establish cuff inflation with a cuff pressure of 20 mm Hg. At this same time (13:00), the respiratory therapist records a ventilator peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 28 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, a set volume of 520 mL, and a measured exhaled volume of 500 mL. At 21:00 the PIP is 23 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and the exhaled volume is 520 mL. What might account for an increase in volume while the pressure is decreasing?

A system leak can prevent flow cycling during PSV. For example, during PSV with the Servo-i ventilator, inspiration is adjusted to end when the flow falls below 5% of the peak inspiratory flow. If a leak in the system allows flow out of the circuit greater than 5% of the peak flow rate, the ventilator continues inspiratory gas flow to the patient. Most microprocessorcontrolled ventilators have a backup cycling time of 1.5 to 3 seconds to end inspiration, if flow does not drop the set amount.

It is critical that no leaks exist in the ventilating system when expired gas is collected for measurements of the dead space-totidal volume ratio (V<sub>D</sub>/V<sub>T</sub>), oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) consumption per minute  $(\dot{V} O_2)$ , and carbon dioxide  $(CO_2)$  production per minute  $(\dot{V} CO_2)$ (see Chapter 10). In these situations, it is necessary for the cuff to be sufficiently inflated to occlude the airway completely. Once the measurements have been obtained, the cuff should be reinflated using MLT or reinflated to the previous low pressure.

# **VITAL SIGNS, BLOOD PRESSURE, AND** PHYSICAL EXAMINATION OF THE CHEST

Observing and recording a patient's vital signs (i.e., systemic arterial blood pressure [BP], heart rate [HR], temperature [T], breathing frequency (f), O<sub>2</sub> saturation measured by pulse oximetry [S<sub>p</sub>O<sub>2</sub>], and physical appearance) can help staff members evaluate possible changes in the patient's overall condition. In mechanically ventilated patients, f, HR, and  $S_pO_2$  are monitored continuously. Temperature and arterial BP may also be monitored continuously, but more often they are measured intermittently. It is important for the clinician to remember that alarms are activated only by critical changes. Moderate changes in vital signs during hourly or bihourly checks should alert the practitioner to the possibility of hypoxemia, impending cardiovascular collapse (decreased or increased BP and HR), or infection (elevated temperature).

#### **Heart Rate**

An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a noninvasive means of continuously monitoring HR and heart rhythm. All hospitalized patients receiving ventilatory support must be continuously monitored with a three-lead ECG. The ECG provides minimum and maximum HR alarms (audible and visual) and therefore can alert the ICU staff if significant bradycardia or tachycardia occurs.

The ECG leads are generally placed on the chest, one near each clavicle and one near the fourth intercostal space at the left midaxillary line. It is important to place the leads so that a clearly discernible QRS complex can be displayed on the monitor (a standard lead II configuration is typically used for monitoring ICU patients).

The ECG monitor is viewed or scanned by a computer for changes in HR and rhythm. Activation of an audible alarm alerts personnel when a potentially dangerous event has occurred. Activation of the HR alarm may simply indicate that the ECG electrodes have become disconnected from the patient, or it may signal a more critical event (e.g., the patient has become disconnected from the ventilator and is experiencing severe hypoxemia, hypercapnia, or both). Other factors that can affect HR include pathological changes in the myocardium (e.g., infarction, hypoxia, and drug reaction), anxiety, pain, and stress. An initial 12-lead ECG should be obtained when mechanical ventilation is initiated in patients older than 21 years with acute respiratory failure.<sup>3</sup>

# **Temperature**

A patient's temperature can be measured orally (by mouth), aurally (by ear), or by an axillary technique (from the armpit). Core temperature measurements are typically obtained using rectal, esophageal, or pulmonary artery temperatures. A number of factors can affect body temperature.<sup>12</sup> For example, hyperthermia can be caused by infection, tissue necrosis, late-stage carcinoma, Hodgkin disease, leukemia, and metabolic abnormalities, such as hyperthyroidism. Low-grade fever can be a result of accidental or surgical trauma, atelectasis, fistulas, hematomas, or foreign bodies.

can result from metabolic Hypothermia (e.g., hypothyroidism), central nervous system disorders, drugs (e.g., phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and benzodiazepines), and other substances (e.g., alcohol, heroin, carbon monoxide).12

# **Systemic Arterial Blood Pressure**

A patient's BP should be checked intermittently with a stethoscope and sphygmomanometer or an automatic BP cuff. It can also be measured continuously with invasive intravascular arterial catheters. Invasive arterial pressure monitoring is typically used after open heart surgery and for critically ill patients requiring continuous, direct measurements of BP (see Chapter 11).

Arterial catheters are usually placed in a peripheral vessel, such as the radial artery, where collateral circulation exists. A modified Allen's test (Box 8.9) should be performed whenever a radial artery catheter is placed.

#### **Central Venous Pressure**

Indwelling venous catheters placed in the superior vena cava or right atrium can be used to monitor central venous pressure (CVP), myocardial function, and fluid status in critically ill

# **BOX 8.9** The Modified Allen Test

The modified Allen test for collateral circulation is performed by holding a patient's hand with the palm up, occluding the radial and ulnar arteries, and having the patient open and close the hand. The hand is opened to make sure it is drained of blood (blanched), and the pressure over the ulnar artery is then released. The palm flushes with blood in 15 seconds or less if collateral circulation to the hand through the ulnar artery is present. The process is repeated with the radial artery to demonstrate perfusion in this vessel. Note that the modified Allen test results are not always reliable and the results must be interpreted with caution.

patients (see Chapter 11). CVP measurements reflect right arterial pressure and right ventricular end-diastolic pressure and therefore can provide valuable information about venous return and right heart function.

Because CVP is elevated during a positive pressure breath, it is measured at the end of expiration when intrapleural pressure returns to normal or its lowest value during the respiratory cycle.

# **Pulmonary Artery Pressure**

Pulmonary artery pressure can be monitored continuously with a balloon-tipped, flow-directed, pulmonary artery (PA) catheter that is connected to a monitor by a transducer. PA catheters are typically used to monitor the hemodynamic status of critically ill patients with severe cardiopulmonary complications and problems with fluid management (see Chapter 11).

# **Physical Examination of the Chest**

Ideally, physical examination of a patient should be performed at least once every shift. This examination should include inspection, palpation, percussion, and auscultation of the chest. The results are recorded on the chart and compared with previous findings. Abnormal findings or significant changes must be evaluated and treated promptly.

Different conditions can produce a variety of physical findings (e.g., hyperresonance occurs on chest percussion of a patient with severe asthma and air trapping). Additionally, breath sounds and chest excursion are diminished, accessory muscle use is increased, and high-pitched wheezes are present. For patients with pneumonia, the chest is dull to percussion, breath sounds are decreased, and crackles (rales) occur late in inspiration over the affected area. With pleural effusion, the affected area produces a dull percussion note, breath sounds are absent, and a pleural friction rub may be audible on auscultation. Patients with a large pneumothorax show a shift in their tracheal position away from the affected side. Chest percussion in these patients is hyperresonant over the affected area, and breath sounds are absent. Table 8.1 presents a list of the physical changes associated with various pulmonary disorders.

Auscultation of the chest that reveals low-pitched breath sounds with a rattle-like quality (rhonchi) may indicate secretions in the larger airways and the need for suctioning. The presence of wheezes often suggests the need for bronchodilator therapy, although wheezes can also occur when secretions are retained in the small airways and with some cardiac conditions. Absence of breath sounds may indicate a pneumothorax, complete airway obstruction, complete lung collapse, improper placement of the ET, or a pleural effusion. Evaluation of both the physical and ventilatory findings (e.g., increased PIP, chest radiograph results) can confirm the presence of abnormal findings and point to appropriate treatments.

Patient assessment should also include evaluation of respiratory muscle use. Increased use of the accessory muscles of inspiration or paradoxical breathing (retraction of the abdomen during inspiration and protrusion during exhalation) indicates an increased WOB and the potential for respiratory muscle fatigue.<sup>13</sup>

Abdominal distention suggests several problems, including postoperative intestinal accumulation of gas, air swallowing, bleeding, or ascites (fluid in the abdominal space). Regardless of the cause, abdominal distention can impair ventilation by applying upward pressure on the diaphragm, creating restrictive breathing difficulties. The cause must be determined and the problem should be corrected if possible (Case Study 8.4).

# Case Study 8.4

#### **Patient Assessment Cases**

#### Problem 1

Physical examination of a patient on mechanical ventilation reveals bilateral low-pitched lung sounds and normal resonance to percussion. The patient has a temperature of 39° C. Heart rate is 122 beats/min and blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg. What is the possible cause of this patient's abnormal breath sounds? What therapeutic procedure is indicated?

#### **Problem 2**

On chest auscultation, the practitioner hears no breath sounds on the left but distant breath sounds on the right. The percussion note on the left is hyper-resonant, and the note on the right has normal resonance. The trachea is deviated to the right. During the past hour, cardiac output has dropped from 6 L/min to 4.5 L/min. What is the most likely problem?

#### **Problem 3**

A female patient has been intubated for 4 hours and is receiving 100% oxygen. Auscultation of the patient's chest reveals normal breath sounds on the right but no breath sounds on the left. The percussion note is normal on the right and dull on the left. The oral endotracheal tube indicates a 26-cm marking at the teeth. What is the most likely problem?

# MANAGEMENT OF ENDOTRACHEAL TUBE AND TRACHEOSTOMY TUBE CUFFS

During the initial assessment of a ventilated patient, the respiratory therapist evaluates endotracheal and tracheostomy tube position, in addition to cuff integrity and pressures. The following section reviews the procedures for measuring cuff pressures and for dealing with inappropriate cuff pressures and cuff leaks.

#### **Cuff Pressure Measurement**

The endotracheal or tracheostomy cuff pressure is typically checked during the initial evaluation of the patient and once every 8 to 12 hours to ensure that cuff pressures do not exceed 20 to 25 mm Hg (27-34 cm H<sub>2</sub>O). It is generally accepted that maintaining the cuff pressure below 34 cm H<sub>2</sub>O (25 mm Hg) reduces the risk for tracheal damage associated with overinflated tube cuffs. Although the pressure transmitted to the tracheal wall is generally lower than the pressure in the cuff, some clinicians contend that using a low cuff pressure reduces the risk for tracheal damage and necrosis associated with tube cuffs. Tracheal damage and necrosis can occur if the cuff pressure transmitted to the trachea is greater than the perfusion pressure. This is particularly important in hypotensive patients, in whom even an ET and tracheostomy cuff pressure of only 34 cm H<sub>2</sub>O (25 mm Hg) can exceed the perfusion pressure to the trachea, resulting in significant tracheal damage.

Cuff pressure measuring devices are a convenient means of monitoring cuff pressure and for adding or removing air from the cuff. These devices have either an analog (gauge) or a digital readout (Fig. 8.6). A small volume of air is lost when the cuff pilot balloon is

**Key Point 8.8** Suctioning the area around the ET above the upper limits of the ET cuff before deflating it can reduce the risk for the patient aspirating secretions that have accumulated above the cuff. These secretions, if aspirated into the lower airways, increase the risk for the patient developing a ventilator-associated pneumonia.

# Improving the Accuracy of Cuff Pressures Measured With a Cuff Inflation Device

Modified from Blanch PB: Laboratory evaluation of 4 brands of endotracheal tube cuff inflator, *Respir Care* 49:166–173. 2004.

- 1. Place a stopcock into the pilot valve of the endotracheal tube (ET).
- 2. Set the stopcock to the closed-in-all-directions position.
- 3. Attach a cuff inflator and a syringe to the two open ports of the stopcock. (NOTE: The Cuffalator and the Endotest have their own bulbs, which can be used in place of a syringe.)
- 4. Turn the stopcock to the syringe or bulb to prepressurize the cuff inflator. (NOTE: If the device has a built-in inflator bulb, the stopcock can remain in the closed-in-all-directions position.)
- 5. Pressurize the cuff to 27 cm  $\rm H_2O$  (20 mm Hg) using the syringe or bulb.
- 6. Once the cuff has been pressurized, rotate the position of the stopcock to connect the cuff inflator to the ET cuff.
- 7. If the cuff pressure is not approximately 27 cm  $H_2O$  (20 mm Hg), it will rise or fall, depending on the difference. The range should be 27 to 34 cm  $H_2O$  (20–25 mm Hg) or less.

connected to the device, because these devices use short connecting tubes. The pressure may be shown in centimeters of water (cm  $\rm H_2O$ ) or millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), depending on the device. Unfortunately, these devices are often inaccurate, and clinicians may find it advisable to use an alternative method for measuring cuff inflation pressures (Box 8.10 and Key Point 8.8).  $^{15}$ 

ET and tracheostomy cuff pressures can also be measured using a mercury column manometer, like those used to measure BP. A three-way or four-way stopcock between the cuff pilot balloon and manometer should be used to pressurize the manometer before the cuff pressure is measured. If this is not done, a significant amount of the cuff volume or pressure will be lost in the connecting tube. Air is injected into the manometer with a syringe to pressurize it. The amount of pressure added must equal previous pressure readings or must be approximately 20 to 25 mm Hg (27–34 cm  $\rm H_2O).^{16}$  The cuff and manometer can be pressurized simultaneously if the cuff is being inflated or was deflated before measurement (Fig. 8.7).

The following five-step protocol was developed to minimize the risk for tracheal necrosis associated with cuff overinflation:

- 1. MLT should be used whenever possible.
- 2. A reasonable MLT should be established, one in which only 50 to 100 mL of  $V_T$  is lost during inspiration. For example, in VC-CMV with a 600 mL  $V_T$  setting and delivery, the exhaled  $V_T$  is 500 to 550 mL.
- A high-volume/low-pressure cuff should not require more than 5 mL for inflation. If it does, the tube probably is too small.
- 4. If a minimal leak cannot be maintained with a cuff volume of less than 5 mL, the practitioner should make sure the cuff pressure is less than 25 mm Hg and that the

Fig. 8.7 A syringe, manometer, and three-way stopcock can be used to measure cuff pressure. (See text for explanation of procedure.)

- cuff-to-tracheal diameter ratio checked on chest radiograph is 1:1.5 or less.
- 5. If steps 1 through 4 cannot be achieved, the patient should be followed for tracheal stenosis for at least 1 year after discharge.

# **High Cuff Pressure**

The most common cause of an excessively high cuff pressure is simply an overinflated tube cuff. Occasionally cuff pressures are high because a low-volume/high-pressure cuff is used. However, most cuffs currently used are the high-volume/low-pressure type unless a specialty tube is used.

Occasionally, a higher than acceptable cuff pressure is required to maintain a minimum occlusion, and none of the problems

![](_page_14_Picture_8.jpeg)

previously mentioned are present. There are two reasons why this may occur. First, the cuff and artificial airway may have moved up (cephalad) in the patient's airway and become lodged in the larynx or pharynx. The markings at the lips or teeth may indicate the depth of the tube in the airway. In this situation, the tube should be moved farther into the airway. Second, the ET may be too small for the patient; in this situation, a large volume is required to seal the tube in the trachea. This is a particularly difficult problem because the clinician may be reluctant to change to a larger tube. However, if the ET will be needed for several days, changing it is the wise course. This can be done using a tube changer (Fig. 8.8). The tube changer is inserted into the current ET, which is removed while the changer is left in place. A larger ET is inserted over the tube changer and into the trachea, and the tube changer is then withdrawn.

On rare occasions a high cuff pressure may be required to maintain either a minimum leak or minimum occlusion because the patient's trachea is dilated at the level of the cuff (Fig. 8.9). Occasionally, the cuff can be repositioned, but a dilated trachea suggests that the cuff has been in place and overinflated for quite some time, resulting in the tracheal injury (see Case Study 8.3).

### **Nonexistent or Low Cuff Pressure**

If the cuff pressure is low or nonexistent, the respiratory therapist should first check that the cuff has been properly inflated and is in the appropriate position in the airway. If the pressure is still low (or absent) or continues to drop after inflation and positioning, the most common cause is a leak in the ET cuff or pilot system. Fig. 8.10 presents an algorithm for determining the cause of a cuff leak and loss of pressure. <sup>17,18</sup>

The location of the leak must be determined. First, the cuff is inflated to an appropriate pressure and the pilot tube is clamped. The clinician then listens for an air leak in the upper airway. For example, if a leak is present during a positive pressure breath, air can be heard over the neck area or may even be escaping from the patient's mouth. If the cuff continues to lose pressure with the pilot tube clamped, the leak is probably in the cuff itself.

**Fig. 8.10** Algorithm for resolution of a cuff leak in an artificial airway. (Modified from Hess DR: Managing the artificial airway, *Respir Care* 44:759—772,1999.)

If the leak is not in the cuff, it may be in the pilot balloon or the valve. To detect these types of leaks, the cuff is inflated and a stopcock is attached to the pilot balloon. The stopcock is turned to the off position. If the leak is still present, it is located in the pilot balloon. This problem can be solved temporarily by clamping the pilot line. If the stopcock on the pilot balloon resolves the leak, the valve is not working. Simply leaving the stopcock on the pilot balloon temporarily solves this problem. The tube should be changed if possible.

A 2-year study of massive airway leaks produced an important finding: a large number of ETs that were removed for apparent

defects or damage were actually flawless. Tube malposition was the most likely explanation for these results. Careful investigation of a leaking airway should precede any decision to change the tube to solve the problem. <sup>19,20</sup>

#### **Cut in the Pilot Tube**

An accidental cut in the pilot tube is a common occurrence. This often happens when clinicians change the tape that secures the tube. This problem can be remedied by positioning a three-way stopcock between a blunt-tipped needle inserted into the cut

![](_page_16_Picture_3.jpeg)

pilot tube and a syringe (Fig. 8.11). Some manufacturers specifically design blunt-tipped needle devices with pilot balloons. The blunt-tipped needle can be inserted into the cut pilot tube, and the cuff of the ET can be inflated (Fig. 8.12).

#### **Tube and Mouth Care**

About once every shift (approximately 8–12 hours) the ET must be repositioned in the mouth and retaped if needed. Repositioning the ET helps prevent pressure injuries to the gums, mouth, lips, or nose that can occur as a result of the constant pressure of the tube. Oral hygiene should also be performed routinely. Although oral

![](_page_16_Picture_8.jpeg)

hygiene is typically the responsibility of the patient's nursing staff, respiratory therapists are often involved. The process of retaping and repositioning the tube is a two-person procedure. One practitioner holds the tube in place while the other person secures the tube with surgical tape.

# MONITORING COMPLIANCE AND AIRWAY RESISTANCE

# **Static Compliance**

Normal  $C_S$  is approximately 70 to 100 mL/cm  $H_2O$  ( $C_S = V_T/[P_{plat} - EEP]$ ). When  $C_S$  is less than 25 mL/cm  $H_2O$ , WOB is very high. The accuracy of the  $C_S$  calculation depends on the accuracy of the actual delivered  $V_T$  and  $P_{plat}$  measurements.

Chest wall recoil and the elastic recoil of the patient circuit remain fairly constant in most patients. A change in  $C_\delta$  readings over time is usually considered a result of change in the patient's alveolar elastic recoil.

In cases in which chest wall compliance does change,  $C_S$  readings can be used to identify the presence of a significant problem. For example, air trapping, pulmonary edema, atelectasis, consolidation, pneumonia, pneumothorax, hemothorax, and pleural effusion will cause a decrease in  $C_S$ . Reductions in chest wall compliance can also occur with flail chest, changes in chest wall muscle tension, pneumomediastinum, and abdominal distention (e.g., peritonitis, ascites, herniation, abdominal bleeding). Note that clinicians can also detect many of these conditions by evaluating breath sounds and percussion notes, palpating the chest and abdominal wall, obtaining a chest radiograph, and studying laboratory data.

Regardless of the method used to determine that an abnormal condition exists, appropriate medical intervention must be initiated and the problem corrected. Reduced  $C_S$  implies that ventilation is less effective. In PC-CMV, pressure remains constant, whereas the delivered  $V_T$  decreases. In VC-CMV, PIP and  $P_{plat}$  increase while the delivered  $V_T$  remains fairly constant (Table 8.2A and B). In PC-CMV, pressure must be increased when compliance decreases to maintain  $V_T$  delivery. Reduced  $C_S$  can result in a decreased  $P_aO_2$  and an increased arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure ( $P_aCO_2$ ); therefore determining the cause of the condition and treating it are important.

# **Dynamic Characteristic (Dynamic Compliance)**

The dynamic characteristic ( $C_D$ ), often called dynamic compliance or dynamic effective compliance, is the volume delivered by the ventilator divided by (PIP - EEP):  $C_D=$  Volume/PIP - EEP).  $^{21}$   $C_D$  is measured during airflow; therefore it is influenced by the patient's lung and chest wall elastic recoil and by airway resistance, the ET, and the ventilator circuit. Because  $C_D$  includes both compliance and resistance components, it is more accurately described as an impedance measurement; however, most practitioners still refer to it as dynamic compliance.

The  $C_D$  decreases whenever  $C_S$  decreases or  $R_{aw}$  increases. Decreases in lung elasticity can be easily differentiated from airway problems simply by monitoring changes in PIP,  $P_{plat}$ , and the difference between them  $(P_{TA})$ . If both PIP and  $P_{plat}$  are increasing with the same volume delivery and the  $P_{TA}$  is fairly constant,  $C_S$  is decreasing (see Table 8.2B and C). If PIP increases along with  $P_{TA}$ ,  $P_{Aw}$  is increasing (see Table 8.2D). Calculation of  $P_{CD}$  and  $P_{CS}$  confirms these findings.

With VC-CMV, volume delivery remains nearly constant regardless of changes in C<sub>D</sub>; however, delivery pressures may

become dangerously high. In PC-CMV, a decrease in  $C_D$  will result in a reduction in the delivered  $V_T$ . Pressure must therefore be increased to maintain the delivered  $V_T$ . During VC-CMV, a decreasing PIP with a constant delivered  $V_T$  may signal improvement in compliance or  $R_{aw}$  (see Table 8.2E). It is important to measure the delivered  $V_T$  because a decreasing pressure might also indicate a leak. Remember, if extrinsic PEEP (PEEP<sub>E</sub>) and/or auto-PEEP is present, it must be subtracted from  $P_{plat}$  and PIP readings to calculate  $C_S$  and  $C_D$  (see Table 8.2F).

During PC-CMV, increased  $V_T$  delivery with the same pressure indicates an improvement in compliance or a decrease in  $R_{aw}$  (or both) (Case Study 8.5).

# **Airway Resistance**

Total resistance is the sum of  $R_{aw}$  and tissue resistance, although tissue resistance remains relatively constant in most cases. (NOTE: Tissue resistance can increase in conditions such as ascites and pleural effusion.)  $R_{aw}$  normally ranges from 0.6 to 2.4 cm  $H_2O/L/s$ ;

it can be estimated for patients on ventilation patients by measuring  $P_{TA}$  and using the inspiratory flow and a constant flow waveform. Although this is not an accurate flow measurement, it can be used over time to indicate relative changes in  $R_{aw}$ . For example, if PIP is 35 cm  $H_2O$ ,  $P_{plat}$  is 34 cm  $H_2O$ , and flow is 30 L/min (0.5 L/s),  $R_{aw}$  is calculated as follows:

$$\begin{split} R_{aw} &= \frac{P_{TA}}{Flow} \bigg(\frac{L}{sec}\bigg) \\ R_{aw} &= \bigg(\frac{PIP - P_{plateau}}{Flow}\bigg) \\ R_{aw} &= \frac{(35 - 34cmH_2O)}{\bigg(\frac{0.5L}{sec}\bigg)} \\ R_{aw} &= \frac{2cmH_2O}{sec} \end{split}$$

# Case Study 8.5

#### **Exercises**

#### Problem 1

While checking the ventilation parameters during VC-CMV, you notice the following changes in positive inspiratory pressure (PIP) and plateau pressure (P<sub>plat</sub>):

| Time  | Volume (L) | PIP (cm H <sub>2</sub> O) | P <sub>plat</sub> (cm H <sub>2</sub> O) |
|-------|------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 01:00 | 0.7        | 23                        | 15                                      |
| 03:00 | 0.7        | 28                        | 16                                      |
| 05:00 | 0.7        | 35                        | 17                                      |

What is the likely cause of the problem? How would you assess the patient to determine the appropriate treatment?

#### **Problem 2**

During PC-CMV, the following changes are noted:

| Time  | Volume (L) | Set Pressure (cm H <sub>2</sub> O) |
|-------|------------|------------------------------------|
| 01:00 | 0.65       | 20                                 |
| 03:00 | 0.60       | 20                                 |
| 05:00 | 0.55       | 20                                 |

What is the likely cause of the problem? How would you assess the patient to determine treatment?

Many microprocessor-controlled ventilators use software programs that can calculate and display compliance and resistance values. Some of the values are taken from measurements of pressure, expired flow, and volume.

Treatment for increased  $R_{\rm aw}$  must be directed at the specific cause of the increase. For example, suctioning the airway, clearing an obstruction, or giving a bronchodilator treatment may correct the problem.

# **Bedside Measurement of Pressure-Volume Curves**

The pressure-volume relationships for  $C_D$  and  $C_S$  can be plotted by ventilating the lung at different volumes and recording the PIP and  $P_{\rm plat}$ . Bone and colleagues first described a bedside measurement technique for drawing static pressure-volume (P-V) curves more than 40 years ago.  $^{20,22,23}$  Plotting of P-V curves is still a valuable tool (Fig. 8.13). Box 8.11 explains the procedure for obtaining static P-V. Current ICU ventilators are equipped with computer software and graphic displays that can automatically generate P-V loops and save a reference loop to make comparisons over time. Daily evaluation of the pressure-volume relationship (either static or dynamic) is recommended to track progression of lung compliance and  $R_{\rm aw}$  changes. (Chapters 9 and 13 contain additional information on P-V curves.)

Fig. 8.13 shows changes in the graphic waveforms that are often associated with patients demonstrating sudden hypoxemia caused by airway problems, lung parenchymal problems, and pulmonary

**Fig. 8.13** Pressure-volume curves reflecting changes in  $C_S$  and  $C_D$  during mechanical ventilation. Under normal conditions, the  $C_S$  and  $C_D$  curves are similar. Because pulmonary emboli do not affect resistance or compliance, neither curve changes with this condition. With mucus plugging or bronchospasm, airway resistance increases, the  $C_D$  curve shifts to the right and flattens (more pressure is required), and the  $C_S$  curve remains unchanged. With conditions that reduce  $C_D$ , both curves shift to the right and flatten. (From Bone RC: Monitoring ventilatory mechanics in acute respiratory failure, *Respir Care* 28:597—603, 1983.)

emboli.<sup>22-24</sup> For example, conditions that affect the lung elasticity and airway resistance shift the dynamic compliance curve to the right and flatten it. If neither curve changes position but the patient develops hypoxemia, pulmonary embolus should be suspected. Table 8.3 correlates P-V curve data with clinical findings to aid evaluation of the patient's pulmonary condition.

Figs. 9.18 and 9.19 provide examples of  $C_D$  curves or P-V loops graphed by newer ventilators such as the Hamilton Galileo

# **Technique for Obtaining Pressure-Volume Curves**

- The patient is normally placed in the supine position, or the head of the bed is slightly elevated and the patient is relaxed. The person cannot be spontaneously breathing because the P<sub>plat</sub> measurements will be inaccurate. (Use of sedation may be necessary.) Explain the procedure to the patient if appropriate.
- 2. Inflate the airway cuff to eliminate leaks; check the system for leaks and remove all of them.
- Select the inspiratory pause control for each volume measurement.
- 4. Select a series of tidal volume ( $V_T$ , such as, and 14 mL/kg or, and 1250 mL. Do not let  $P_{\rm plat}$  become excessively high.)\*
- For each volume setting, record the peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), P<sub>plat</sub>, end-expiratory pressure (EEP), and V<sub>T</sub>. (Subtract EEP from PIP and P<sub>plat</sub> before recording.)
- Closely monitor the patient's hemodynamic status during the procedure.
- 7. Allow return to normal settings for several breaths between each test volume setting.
- 8. Remove the inspiratory pause.
- Return cuff pressures to minimum leak or initial pressure or volume.
- 10. Perform a complete patient-ventilator system check.
- 11. Plot the data (see Fig. 8.14).

Some ventilators, such as the Hamilton G5, can graph a slow dynamic P-V loop using slow flows and preset PEEP levels. A software program manages the maneuver and draws the resulting graph. Slow P-V loops may have value for establishing inflection points on the curve (see Chapter 13).

Fig. 8.14 shows a static P-V curve for a patient with normal lungs and a P-V curve for a patient with ARDS. Notice that the contour of the graph for the patient with ARDS has a sigmoid shape (S shape). The **lower inflection point** marks a significant change in the slope of the curve and may indicate the pressure at which large numbers of alveoli are recruited. The **upper inflection point** indicates a point at which large numbers of alveoli are becoming overinflated. Attempts should be made to provide ventilation to the patient between these two points.

Graphic displays of pressure-volume relationships have been shown to be useful in the treatment of patients with ARDS.  $^{24-27}$  During the procedure for obtaining a P-V curve, the patient is typically heavily sedated and short-acting paralytic agents may be required. Lung inflation can be accomplished with the ventilator if it has the appropriate software. Alternatively, lung inflation can be accomplished with a super syringe (i.e., a L syringe). With the syringe technique, a graduated, super syringe is attached to the ET (Fig. 8.15). Precise volumes of gas (e.g., mL) are pushed into the lung and held for 2 seconds or long enough to allow measurement of  $P_{\text{plat}}$ . The pressure is measured after the delivery of each volume, and the P-V curve is then manually plotted by the respiratory therapist. It is worth mentioning that obtaining P-V measurements using the syringe technique is generally well tolerated by patients; however, the procedure can cause significant

**Key Point 8.9** Dynamic P-V loops reflect changes in compliance during gas flow. Static P-V loops represent changes in compliance when no gas flow is present.

changes in the patient's hemodynamic and oxygenation status. It is therefore prudent to closely monitor the patient during the procedure.  $^{28}$ 

Setting PEEP above the lower inflection point on the curve may help prevent inflated alveoli from collapsing and having to reexpand with each breath. Setting the  $V_T$  low enough so that PIP remains below the upper inflection point may reduce the risk for ventilator-induced lung injury. Assessment of the clinical data and analysis of the P-V curve can help the clinician establish the cause of a change in the patient's condition and determine the appropriate treatment.

Chapter 9 includes an overview of ventilator graphics along with examples of graphic displays typically encountered in ventilated patients. Additional information about the assessment of respiratory system mechanics is presented in Chapter 10. Chapter 13 provides details regarding specific procedures for obtaining and using P-V curves in the treatment of patients with ARDS.

# COMMENT SECTION OF THE VENTILATOR FLOW SHEET

The patient-ventilator system check sheet includes a section for comments. The respiratory therapist can use this section to comment on any of the following:

- Patient assessment (e.g., breath sounds, chest wall movement, percussion note, presence of cyanosis, cutaneous perfusion, level of consciousness)
- · Changes in ventilator settings
- · Changes in the physician's orders
- · Description of any equipment problems

Some medical centers use a separate patient assessment sheet in which subjective findings, objective findings, the assessment, and the treatment plan (SOAP notes) can be summarized.

- Before connecting a patient to a mechanical ventilator, the respiratory therapist should verify that the designated ventilator has passed an operational verification procedure (OVP).
- The initial assessment of a patient receiving mechanical ventilation should include evaluation of the patient's physical appearance, vital signs, ABGs,  $S_pO_2$ , and ventilator settings (e.g., f, sensitivity,  $F_1O_2$ , volumes, pressures).
- The ventilator flow sheet is a necessary and valuable record of measured and observed patient and ventilator clinical values.
- Volumes, pressures, temperature, vital signs, and F<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub> are measured during each patient-ventilator system check.
- Initial assessment of the position of the ET and cuff pressure measurements establishes that the ET is positioned properly and cuff pressures have been set correctly.
- Calculation of V<sub>D</sub>/V<sub>T</sub>, compliance and resistance, and evaluation of P-V curves/loops help determine the baseline condition of the lung mechanics and can serve as a means to monitor changes.
- Evaluation of the integrity of the ventilator circuit is part of a standard ventilator check. It includes checking for leaks, disconnected tubing, and other circuit problems.
- Visual and auditory alarms are essential components of the patient-ventilator system.
- Computerized ventilator graphics included on most ICU ventilators have extended the clinician's ability to perform bedside assessment of the patient-ventilator interaction.

- 9. Which of the following statements about these conditions is correct?
  - C<sub>L</sub> is improving.
  - C<sub>D</sub> has not changed.
  - R<sub>aw</sub> is improving.
  - R<sub>aw</sub> is getting worse.
- 10. A static P-V curve for C<sub>S</sub> and C<sub>D</sub> reveals a widening gap between the two curves. What does this probably represent?
- **11.** A patient has an IBW of 150 lb, a  $V_T$  of 0.55 L, and an f of 8 breaths/min. What is the estimated alveolar ventilation?
- **12.** While listening with a stethoscope over the trachea during VC-CMV, the respiratory therapist hears a slight leak at the end of inspiration in an orally intubated patient. What change should the therapist make?
  - A. Increase cuff pressure until no sound is heard

- B. Check cuff pressure and delivered volume
- C. Check cuff volume
- D. Recommend changing the artificial airway
- **13.** A 6-ft, 4-in, 215-lb man has a size 7 oral ET in place. Cuff pressure is 35 mm Hg. The set  $V_T$  is 600 mL (0.6 L), and the delivered  $V_T$  is 500 mL (0.5 L). The patient is likely to need mechanical ventilation for at least a week. What would you recommend?
  - A. Increase the set  $V_{\mathsf{T}}$
  - B. Reduce the cuff pressure to 20 mm Hg
  - C. Change the ET to a size 8
  - D. Make no changes at this time
- **14.** The following data were obtained for a patient on PC-CMV: What do you think is causing the change in  $V_T$  and what should the respiratory therapist evaluate?

| Time  | Set Pressure (cm H <sub>2</sub> O) | V <sub>T</sub> (mL) |
|-------|------------------------------------|---------------------|
| 21:00 | 20                                 | 550                 |
| 23:00 | 20                                 | 575                 |
| 01:00 | 20                                 | 620                 |

- **15.** A high-volume/low-pressure cuff has a pressure of 15 mm Hg as measured with a BP manometer technique. The respiratory therapist does not hear a leak when listening over the tracheal area with a stethoscope. What should the respiratory therapist do?
  - A. Reevaluate the cuff pressure because this technique is not trustworthy
  - B. Increase the cuff pressure to 20 to 25 mm Hg
  - C. Maintain the current pressure because this will augment tracheal perfusion
  - D. Be concerned about high cuff pressures damaging the airway
- **16.** While changing the tape on the ET, the respiratory therapist accidentally cuts the pilot balloon line. This problem can be corrected by:
  - A. Using a stopcock, blunt-tipped needle, and syringe to reinflate the cuff and keep it inflated
  - B. Changing the ET
  - C. Clamping the pilot line with a hemostat
  - D. Increasing the flow on the ventilator
