#### **EFFECTS OF POSITIVE PRESSURE VENTILATION** ON THE HEART AND THORACIC VESSELS

The physiological effects of mechanical ventilation are well documented. Laboratory and clinical studies have demonstrated that

positive pressure ventilation can significantly alter cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological, renal, and gastrointestinal (GI) function. (See Chapter 17 for information on the pulmonary effects and complications of mechanical ventilation.) Thus every attempt should be made to minimize its adverse effects. Understanding the physiological effects and potential complications of positive pressure ventilation is therefore essential for clinicians involved with ventilator management.

## ADVERSE CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS OF POSITIVE PRESSURE VENTILATION

Positive pressure ventilation can significantly change physiological pressures in the thorax. The extent of these changes depends on the amount of positive pressure applied to the airways and a patient's cardiopulmonary status (Key Point 16.1).

## The Thoracic Pump Mechanism During Normal Spontaneous Breathing and During Positive Pressure Ventilation

It has been known for several decades that positive pressure ventilation can reduce cardiac output. This phenomenon can be understood in part by comparing intrapleural (i.e., intrathoracic) pressure changes that occur during normal spontaneous or negative pressure breathing with those occurring during positive pressure ventilation.

During spontaneous breathing, the fall in intrapleural pressure that draws air into the lungs during inspiration also draws blood into the major thoracic vessels and heart (Fig. 16.1). With this increased return of blood to the right side of the heart and the stretching and enlargement of the right heart volume, the right ventricular (RV) preload increases, resulting in an increased RV stroke volume (SV; i.e., Frank-Starling mechanism). Conversely,

**Key Point 16.1** The physiological effects of positive pressure ventilation depend on the amount of pressure applied to the airways and the patient's cardiopulmonary status.

![](_page_1_Figure_10.jpeg)

**Fig. 16.1** The negative intrapleural pressures that occur during spontaneous inspiration are transmitted to the intrathoracic vessels. A reduction in pressure in the vena cava increases the pressure gradient back to the heart, and venous return increases.

during a spontaneous (passive) expiration, intrapleural pressure rises (i.e., becomes less negative), causing a reduction in venous return and RV preload, which in turn leads to a decrease in RV SV). Note that these pressure changes affect left heart volumes in a similar fashion.

The effects on intrathoracic pressures and venous return are quite different when positive pressure is applied to the airway (Fig. 16.2). During inspiration, increases in airway pressure are transmitted to the intrapleural space and the great vessels and other structures in the thorax. As the airway pressure rises, the intrapleural pressure rises and intrathoracic blood vessels become compressed, causing the central venous pressure (CVP) to increase. This increase in CVP reduces the pressure gradient between systemic veins and the right side of the heart, which reduces venous return to the right side of the heart and thus RV filling (preload). As a result, RV SV decreases.

Notice that vascular pressures within the thorax generally increase in proportion to increases in mean airway pressure  $(\overline{P}_{aw})$  and intrapleural pressure (i.e., the higher the  $\overline{P}_{aw}$ , the greater the effects). This phenomenon is particularly evident when one considers the effect of adding positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) during positive pressure ventilation. Because PEEP further increases  $\overline{P}_{aw}$  during positive pressure ventilation, it is reasonable to assume that reductions in venous return and cardiac output are greater during positive pressure ventilation with PEEP than with positive pressure ventilation alone. Furthermore, the addition of PEEP during an assisted breath decreases cardiac output more than when PEEP is used with intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) or continuous positive airway pressure alone.

## Increased Pulmonary Vascular Resistance and Altered Right and Left Ventricular Function

During inspiration with high tidal volumes ( $V_T$ s) or when high levels of PEEP are used, the pulmonary capillaries that interlace the alveoli are stretched and narrowed. As a result, resistance to blood flow through the pulmonary circulation increases (Fig. 16.3). This increases RV afterload (i.e., pulmonary vascular resistance [PVR] and the resting volume of the right ventricle). In normal healthy individuals, RV SV is maintained in the face of increased PVR because RV contractile function is not severely impaired. However,

![](_page_1_Figure_17.jpeg)

**Fig. 16.2** Positive pressure ventilation increases lung and intrapleural (intrathoracic) pressures. This positive pressure is transmitted to the intrathoracic vessels. A rise in the pressure in the vena cava reduces venous return to the heart.

![](_page_2_Picture_3.jpeg)

Fig. 16.3 Overfilling of an alveolus. The result is thinning and compression of the pulmonary capillary. Pulmonary vascular resistance is increased.

in patients with compromised RV function, the right ventricle cannot overcome these increases in PVR, and overdistention of the right ventricle occurs, resulting in a decrease in RV output.

Dilation of the right ventricle can also force the interventricular septum to move to the left. This phenomenon usually occurs when high  $\overline{P}_{aw}$  values (>15 cm  $H_2O$ ) are used and the patient's blood volume is depleted.³ When this occurs, the left ventricular end-diastolic volume is encroached upon and LV SV may decrease because its ability to fill is limited. Septal shifting can significantly decrease cardiac output in patients with compromised LV function or in patients who are volume depleted.³ In this latter group of patients, intravascular volume expansion may help restore output from the left side of the heart by returning LV preload to normal.

The LV output may also be decreased when high  $V_{\rm T}s$  are used during positive pressure ventilation, because the heart is compressed between the expanding lungs (i.e., cardiac tamponade effect). The distensibility of the left side of the heart appears to be directly related to the transmission of positive pressures to the heart from the lung.<sup>2</sup> This effect increases when long inspiratory times and high peak pressures are used.

## **Coronary Blood Flow With Positive Pressure Ventilation**

In addition to reduced venous return and alteration in ventricular function, lower cardiac output may be caused by myocardial dysfunction associated with reduced perfusion of the myocardium and the resultant myocardial ischemia. The flow of blood into the coronary vessels depends on the coronary perfusion pressure. The coronary artery perfusion pressure gradient for the LV is the difference between mean aortic diastolic pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure; the perfusion pressure gradient for the right ventricle is the difference between mean aortic pressure and RV end-diastolic pressure.

Reductions in coronary vessel perfusion can result from any factor that decreases this perfusion pressure gradient. Thus reductions in cardiac output or blood pressure (BP), coronary vasospasms, or direct effect of compression of the coronary vessels caused by increases in intrathoracic pressure during positive pressure ventilation can decrease coronary perfusion and ultimately lead to myocardial ischemia.

## FACTORS INFLUENCING CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS OF POSITIVE PRESSURE VENTILATION

The level of reduction in cardiac output that occurs with positive pressure ventilation depends on several factors, including lung and chest wall compliance, airway resistance ( $R_{aw}$ ), and the duration and magnitude of the positive pressure.

## Compensation in Individuals With Normal Cardiovascular Function

Because of compensatory mechanisms, systemic hypotension rarely occurs in individuals with normal cardiovascular function receiving positive pressure ventilation. Decreases in SV normally result in an increase in sympathetic tone, which leads to tachycardia and an increase in systemic vascular resistance and peripheral venous pressure from arterial and venous constriction, respectively. In addition, some peripheral shunting of blood away from the kidneys and lower extremities occurs. The net effect is maintenance of BP even with a decrease in cardiac output (Key Point 16.2).

It is important to understand that the effectiveness of these compensatory mechanisms in maintaining arterial BP depends on the integrity of the individual's neuroreflexes. Vascular reflexes can be blocked or impaired in the presence of sympathetic blockade, spinal anesthesia, moderate levels of general anesthesia, spinal cord transection, or severe polyneuritis. In a patient in whom positive pressure ventilation is being initiated or the ventilatory mode is being changed, it is prudent to measure the BP early to ensure that normal vascular reflexes are intact. The presence of normal vascular reflexes increases the probability that the patient will not experience a significant drop in cardiac output and BP if positive pressure ventilation is initiated. For example, it is unusual to see a reduction in cardiac output in normovolemic patients when low levels of PEEP are used (i.e., cm H<sub>2</sub>O of PEEP). However, decreases in cardiac output can occur in this group of patients if higher levels of PEEP are used (>15 cm  $H_2O$ )<sup>4</sup> (Case Study 16.1).

**Key Point 16.2** Systemic hypotension rarely occurs in normal individuals receiving positive pressure ventilation because of compensatory mechanisms.

#### Case Study 16.1

## The Effects of Ventilator Changes on Blood Pressure

A patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is receiving volume-controlled continuous mandatory ventilation (VC-CMV). The set  $V_T$  is increased from 700 to 900 mL, and the rate is increased from 10 to 18 breaths/min. The respiratory therapist notices a progressive rise in peak airway pressures. Immediately after the change, the patient's blood pressure drops from 145/83 mm Hg to 102/60 mm Hg. What is the most likely cause of this problem and what should the respiratory therapist recommend?

#### Effects of Lung and Chest Wall Compliance and **Airway Resistance**

Patients with very stiff lungs, such as those with acute respiratory distress syndrome or pulmonary fibrosis, are less likely to experience hemodynamic changes with high pressures because less of the alveolar pressure (P<sub>alv</sub>) is transmitted to the intrapleural space. On the other hand, patients with compliant lungs and stiff (noncompliant) chest walls are more likely to have higher intrapleural pressures with positive pressure ventilation and experience more pronounced cardiovascular effects.

In patients with increased R<sub>aw</sub>, although peak pressures may be high, much of the pressure is lost to the poorly conductive airways. As a consequence, high peak airway pressures may not be transmitted to the intrapleural space and alveoli.

#### **Duration and Magnitude of Positive Pressures**

One way to reduce the deleterious effects of positive pressure ventilation is to control the amount of pressure exerted in the thorax. Maintaining the lowest possible P<sub>aw</sub> helps minimize the reductions in cardiac output that can occur during mechanical ventilation. It is therefore important to understand how peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), inspiratory flow, inspiratory-to-expiratory (I/E) ratios, inflation hold, and PEEP affect Paw and, ultimately, cardiac output.

#### BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF POSITIVE PRESSURE **VENTILATION ON HEART FUNCTION IN PATIENTS WITH LEFT VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION**

Although the discussion so far has focused on the adverse effects of positive pressure ventilation, it is important to recognize that positive pressure can also be beneficial for patients with LV dysfunction and elevated filling pressures. For example, PEEP may improve cardiac function by raising the PaO2 and improving myocardial oxygenation and performance if the LV dysfunction is a result of hypoxemia. Reductions in venous return decrease the preload to the heart and thus improve length-tension relationships and SV in patients with ventricular overload. Additionally, by raising the intrathoracic pressure, positive pressure ventilation decreases the transmural LV systolic pressure and thus the afterload to the left heart (Critical Care Concept 16.1). Box 16.1 lists some potential effects of PEEP on heart function.<sup>5,6</sup>

#### MINIMIZING THE PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS AND COMPLICATIONS OF MECHANICAL **VENTILATION**

As previously stated, the harmful effects of positive pressure ventilation on cardiovascular function occur when high positive pressures are applied to the lungs and transmitted to the intrapleural space. Ventilatory strategies that reduce intrapulmonary pressures during positive pressure ventilation will therefore also reduce the harmful effects on cardiovascular function. Although it may not be obvious, the amount and duration of the pressure applied to the airway, or more specifically the  $\overline{P}_{aw}$ , ultimately influences the extent of these harmful effects. Thus the lower the  $\overline{P}_{aw}$ , the less marked the cardiovascular effects. Fig. 16.4 illustrates

![](_page_3_Picture_12.jpeg)

#### ( Critical care Concept 16.1

#### Calculating Cardiac Transmural Pressure

The effective filling and emptying of the heart is determined, in part, by the pressure difference between the inside of the heart and the intrathoracic pressure. This is called the cardiac transmural pressure  $(P_{TM})$ . The more positive the P<sub>TM</sub> is during diastole, the greater the filling of the heart (preload). The more positive the  $P_{TM}$  is during systole, the higher the workload is for the heart (afterload). Keeping this in mind, calculate the  $P_{TM}$  during a positive pressure breath and during a spontaneous breath and compare their values.

#### **Problem 1: Positive Pressure Breathing**

If intrapleural pressure  $(P_{pl})$  is +10 cm  $H_2O$  and intraventricular pressure is 150 mm Hg, what is the  $P_{TM}$ ?

#### **Problem 2: Spontaneous Inspiration**

If  $P_{pl}$  is -10 cm  $H_2O$  and intraventricular pressure is 150 mm Hg, what is the P<sub>TM</sub>?

#### BOX **16.1**

#### **Potential Effects of PEEP in Left Ventricular Dvsfunction**

- Increased airway pressure ( $\overline{P}_{aw}$ ) and intrathoracic pressure lead to decreased venous return that can reduce preload to a failing heart and improve function.
- Increased FRC that occurs with the application of PEEP leads to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and increased afterload to the right heart, which may shift the intraventricular septum to the left. This does not seem to alter RV contractility until values for PAP are critical.
- Left shift of the intraventricular septum reduces LV volume and decreases the load it must pump. On the other hand, it also may affect LV compliance and either increase or decrease LV function (the response varies).
- The mechanical compression of the heart and aorta by the positive pleural pressure can alter ventricular function. Vascular pressure in the heart and thoracic aorta are transiently increased relative to the extrathoracic aorta (i.e., LV afterload decreases). This response is not always consistent, and cardiac tamponade from PEEP can negatively alter myocardial compliance as well.
- Improper ventilator settings may lead to increased work of breathing and O<sub>2</sub> demand, which can affect myocardial O<sub>2</sub> supply and result in myocardial ischemia and reduced LV compliance.

the airway pressure changes that occur during one respiratory cycle.

Notice in Fig. 16.4 that the  $\overline{P}_{aw}$  is the area enclosed between the curve and the baseline for one respiratory cycle, divided by the duration of the cycle. Although most of the newer microprocessor ventilators measure, calculate, and display  $\overline{P}_{aw}$  with the simple

Fig. 16.4 Vertical lines under the pressure curve represent frequent readings of pressure over the total respiratory cycle. The sum of these pressure readings (i.e., the area under the curve) divided by the cycle time will give the  $\overline{P}_{aw}$ .

Fig. 16.5 Slower inspiratory flow may reach a lower peak pressure compared with a rapid flow rate, but it may also produce a higher airway pressure (Paw). Note the number of boxes under each curve.

push of a button, it is important to understand how  $\overline{P}_{aw}$  is actually calculated. In a constant flow, volume-limited breath, the pressure rise is nearly linear with time and produces essentially a triangular pressure waveform (Fig. 16.5).  $\overline{P}_{aw}$  can be estimated by using the following equation:  $\overline{P}_{aw}=1/2$  (PIP [inspiratory time/total respiratory cycle]). In this same ventilator mode with PEEP added, the equation is as follows:

$$\overline{P}_{aw} = \frac{1}{2(PIP - PEEP)} \times \left(\frac{Inspiratorytime}{Total cycletime}\right) + PEEP$$

The  $\overline{P}_{aw}$  generated during positive pressure ventilation varies and may exhibit different waveforms (pressure curves) depending on the ventilator employed, mode of ventilation used, and patient's pulmonary characteristics. For example, techniques such as inverse ratio ventilation (IRV) and PEEP produce higher  $\overline{P}_{aw}$  compared with conventional positive pressure ventilation.

#### Mean Airway Pressure and PaO2

It should be apparent that  $\overline{P}_{aw}$  has clinical importance. For a specific  $V_T$ , the  $P_aO_2$  will be predominantly affected by  $\overline{P}_{aw}$  and, to a lesser extent, the ventilator parameters used to achieve the  $\overline{P}_{aw}$ . This is probably related to an increase in functional residual

capacity (FRC) with increased  $\overline{P}_{aw}$ . Thus changes in FRC are of importance to increased oxygenation in some pulmonary disorders such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. (NOTE: The amount of  $\overline{P}_{aw}$  required to achieve a certain level of oxygenation may indicate the severity of a patient's lung disease.)

#### **Reduction in Airway Pressure**

High  $\overline{P}_{aw}$  values suggest the presence of increased intrapleural pressures and the associated problems previously discussed. It cannot be overstated that the level of positive pressure should never be maintained higher or longer than is necessary to achieve adequate ventilation and oxygenation. In the sections that follow, we will discuss how  $\overline{P}_{aw}$  can be affected by inspiratory gas flow and pattern, I/E ratio, inflation hold, PEEP, IMV, and the ventilator mode used.

#### **Inspiratory Flow**

Although rapid inspiratory flows tend to increase PIP, higher inspiratory flows allow for the delivery of the desired  $V_T$  in a shorter time, which in turn produces a lower  $\overline{P}_{aw}$  in patients with normal conducting airways (see Fig. 16.5). Three points must be kept in mind, however, when using high inspiratory flows. First,

more pressure will be lost to the patient circuit with higher PIP. Second, more pressure will be required to overcome  $R_{aw}$  ( $R_{aw} =$  $\Delta$ P/flow). And third, uneven ventilation is more likely to occur with high inspiratory flow. If, for example, the right bronchus is partially obstructed, most of the gas flow would go to the left lung because gas flow will follow the path of least resistance. Consequently, a larger volume enters the left lung, creating higher airway pressures in the left lung compared with the right lung. This situation can lead to uneven distribution of gas and contribute to ventilation-perfusion  $(\dot{V}/\dot{Q})$  mismatching by creating higher intraalveolar pressures in the left lung. These higher intraalveolar pressures may lead to increased dead space ventilation resulting from the high alveolar volume; the elevated Paly can also reduce capillary blood flow. Additionally, the high volume delivered to the left lung may increase the risk for alveolar rupture.

The goal should be to use an inspiratory flow that is not too high for the reasons just outlined but also not too low, which may lead to increased work of breathing (WOB) and auto-PEEP. Careful monitoring of the effects of flow changes on volume delivery,  $V_D/V_T$ ,  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$ , and transairway pressure (P<sub>TA</sub>) can help identify the appropriate inspiratory flow setting. (See Chapter 6 for additional information on setting inspiratory flow.)

#### **Inspiratory-to-Expiratory Ratio**

Another point to consider is the duration of inspiration in relation to expiration. Shorter inspiratory time (T<sub>I</sub>) and longer expiratory time (T<sub>E</sub>) typically lead to the fewer harmful effects of positive pressure. A range of I/E ratios of 1:2 to 1:4 or less in adult patients is considered acceptable. Values of 1:1, 2:1, and higher may result in significant increases in  $\overline{P}_{aw}$ , air trapping, and significant hemodynamic complications (Key Point 16.3).

In patients with poor airway conductance, a longer T<sub>E</sub> also allows for better alveolar emptying and less chance of developing auto-PEEP. Using a short I/E of 1:6 or smaller in an apneic patient receiving volume control ventilation may increase physiological dead space because of a  $T_I$  that is too short (i.e.,  $T_I < 0.5$  seconds). It is the responsibility of the clinician to balance the patient's

**Key Point** 16.3 Shorter inspiratory times and longer expiratory times will usually help minimize the adverse effects of positive pressure ventilation on cardiovascular function.

response to variations in I/E ratio and flow rates to achieve the most effective ventilation for that individual.

#### **Inflation Hold**

Inflation hold, or inspiratory pause, was initially proposed as a method to improve oxygenation and distribution of gas in the lungs during volume-targeted ventilation. It was subsequently realized that the inflation hold maneuver could lead to severe consequences if it is used for extended periods because it increases  $T_I$  and  $\overline{P}_{aw}$  (Fig. 16.6). Inflation hold is now used almost exclusively to measure plateau pressure (Pplat), which is required to calculate static lung compliance (Cs). It should be kept in mind, however, that because the inflation hold maneuver raises the  $\overline{P}_{aw}$ and can potentially cause undesirable hemodynamic side effects, it should be used judiciously.

#### **Positive End-Expiratory Pressure**

PEEP increases FRC and improves oxygenation, but it also increases  $\overline{P}_{aw}$  (Fig. 16.7). As mentioned earlier, inappropriate levels of PEEP that cause overdistention of the lungs can result in a reduction in cardiac output. It is important to understand, however, that in cases in which a patient demonstrates reduced lung compliance (i.e., "stiff" lungs) and a reduced FRC, increased  $\overline{P}_{aw}$ with PEEP will not always lead to a decreased cardiac output. In these situations, the application of relatively high levels of PEEP to reestablish a normal FRC does not cause detrimental effects on intrathoracic blood vessels and will therefore have minimal effects on cardiac output.

#### **High Peak Pressures From Increased Airway** Resistance

Although high PIP may indicate an increase in  $\overline{P}_{aw}$ , this increased  $\overline{P}_{aw}$  may not always be transmitted to the intrapleural space. For example, increased amounts of pressure are needed to provide ventilation to patients with elevated Raw caused by bronchospasm, mucus plugging, and mucosal edema; however, not all of this increased pressure will reach the alveoli because the majority will be transmitted to the conducting airways. Thus high PIP measured at the upper airway does not always reflect Palv. Pplat will be low, and the increase in Paw in this case may not result in an improvement in oxygenation. If increased resistance leads to air trapping from inadequate expiratory time or from loss of normal expiratory resistance maneuvers such as pursed-lip breathing, hazardous cardiovascular side effects are likely to occur (Fig. 16.8). Ventilators that calculate  $\overline{P}_{aw}$  can show inaccurate  $\overline{P}_{aw}$  values in the presence of air trapping (auto-PEEP).

Note that PIP is also higher with increased  $R_{hw}$ .

Fig. 16.9 Balancing the benefits and hazards. The top figure shows the balance between the benefits and hazards of increasing the gas flow rate and decreasing the I/E ratio to reduce the  $\overline{P}_{aw}$ . The bottom figure shows the balance between the benefits and hazards of increasing the  $\overline{P}_{aw}$  to increase alveolar ventilation (by increasing  $\dot{V}_A$  and/or respiratory rate) and achieve alveolar recruitment with PEEP and improve gas distribution (by using a slow inspiratory flow rate and a descending waveform). All factors must be considered when treating patients on mechanical ventilatory support.

#### **Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation**

Another mode of ventilation that can reduce  $\overline{P}_{aw}$  in patients requiring positive pressure ventilation is IMV. The cardiovascular complications of high  $\overline{P}_{aw}$  can be minimized by reducing the frequency of mandatory breaths and allowing spontaneous breathing to occur at ambient pressure or with PEEP/continuous positive airway pressure between those breaths. It is important to recognize, however, that IMV requires the patient to assume a certain percentage of the WOB. It must be used with caution because IMV can increase the risk for fatigue and add stress to those patients who may require full ventilatory support.

If the patient's spontaneous respiratory rate between machine breaths is rapid and accompanied by low  $V_T$  values, the patient's WOB is increased and fatigue may result. If the patient's spontaneous respiratory rate is rapid and  $V_T$  values are deep in the presence of normal  $P_aCO_2$ , the patient may have some underlying cause for an increased  $V_D/V_T$  ratio or increased  $\dot{V}CO_2$ . It is not uncommon for acutely ill patients, such as those with sepsis, multiple organ failure, severe burns, or trauma, to have higher than normal metabolic rates leading to increased  $\dot{V}CO_2$  and  $\dot{V}CO_2$  and requiring a higher minute ventilation  $(\dot{V}_E)$ . The clinician must decide whether the patient can continue to work this hard or the mandatory rate must be increased. The answer depends on the

clinical situation and the ventilatory requirements for each patient. In this situation, pressure-supported ventilation at appropriate levels may help solve the problem.

In summary, the most serious complications associated with positive pressure ventilation include alterations in cardiac function, interference with gas exchange, and increased risk for lung injury from overdistention. Procedures that decrease  $\overline{P}_{aw}$  may decrease cardiovascular effects, but they may also contribute to uneven ventilation and vice versa (Fig. 16.9). The clinician must evaluate each aspect of the patient's condition and choose the most effective ventilation mode.

# EFFECTS OF MECHANICAL VENTILATION ON INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE, RENAL FUNCTION, LIVER FUNCTION, AND GASTROINTESTINAL FUNCTION

## Effects of Mechanical Ventilation on Intracranial Pressure and Cerebral Perfusion

The amount of blood flowing to the brain is determined by the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), which is calculated by subtracting the intracranial pressure (ICP) from the mean systemic arterial blood pressure (MABP). Because positive pressure

ventilation (with or without PEEP) can decrease cardiac output and MABP, it is reasonable to assume that CPP would also decrease during positive pressure ventilation. Consider the following example. If MABP drops from 100 to 70 mm Hg and the ICP is 15 mm Hg, the CPP would decrease from 85 mm Hg (100-15=85 mm Hg) to 55 mm Hg (70-15=55 mm Hg).

Positive pressure ventilation can also reduce CPP by increasing the CVP. In this situation, CPP is reduced because a reduction in venous return from the head increases ICP. This can be observed clinically by noting an increase in jugular vein distention. The net result is a potential for cerebral hypoxemia from a reduced perfusion to the brain and an increase in cerebral edema from increased ICP.

With normal intracranial dynamics, patients do not typically develop increased ICP with positive pressure ventilation.<sup>6</sup> The greatest risk for decreased cerebral perfusion occurs in patients who already have an increased ICP and who may develop cerebral edema, such as patients with closed head injuries, patients with cerebral tumors, or patients who have undergone neurosurgery. Some clinicians advocate using mechanical ventilation to hyperventilate patients with severe, uncontrollable increased ICP. The idea was that the respiratory alkalosis that results from lowering the P<sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> to 32 to 35 mm Hg can constrict cerebral arterial vessels and reduce the ICP, thus increasing the CPP gradient and augmenting cerebral perfusion. As previously discussed, this effect is temporary and should be used for short periods when ICPs are spiking. It is important to note that the actual benefit of using hyperventilation in patients with closed head injury remains controversial and is not always recommended as a standard practice for these patients.

Some patients with traumatic brain injuries require PEEP to treat refractory hypoxemia caused by increased shunting and decreased FRC. When PEEP is used in these patients, it is important to recognize that it can potentially limit CPP by raising ICP. On the other hand, if PEEP is needed to maintain oxygenation, it may be lifesaving and should be used. Regardless of the situation, it is imperative to monitor ICP in this patient group.<sup>4</sup>

#### **RENAL EFFECTS OF MECHANICAL VENTILATION**

It has been known for nearly half a century that pressurized breathing can induce changes in renal function.<sup>7-9</sup> These changes can be divided into three areas:

- Renal responses to hemodynamic changes resulting from high intrathoracic pressures
- Humoral responses, including antidiuretic hormone (ADH), atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone changes occurring with positive pressure ventilation
- · Abnormal pH, PaCO2, and PaO2 affecting the kidney

#### **Renal Response to Hemodynamic Changes**

Although urinary output remains fairly constant over a wide range of arterial pressures, it becomes severely reduced as the renal arterial pressure decreases below 75 mm Hg. Indeed, urinary output can actually stop in the presence of profound hypotension. Therefore it would be reasonable to assume that the initiation of positive pressure ventilation would cause a decrease in cardiac output, which in turn would lead to a decrease in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rates and ultimately a decrease in urine output. However, decreases in urine production seen during

positive pressure ventilation may not be caused entirely by a decrease in cardiac output because returning cardiac output to adequate levels is not accompanied by a proportional increase in urinary output. Also, because the arterial BP is usually compensated when positive pressure ventilation is used, decreased BP is probably not a significant factor leading to decreased urinary output during mechanical ventilation.

Redistribution of blood inside the kidney may actually be an important factor that is responsible for changes in kidney function. Flow to the outer cortex decreases, whereas flow to the inner cortex and outer medullary tissue (juxtamedullary nephrons) increases. The net result is that less urine, creatinine, and sodium are excreted. This occurs because the juxtamedullary nephrons near the medulla of the kidney are more efficient at reabsorbing sodium than are those at the outer cortex. As a result of this shift in blood flow, more sodium is reabsorbed, which in turn is accompanied by an increased reabsorption of water. Another possible explanation for this effect may be related to an alteration in renal venous pressure resulting from inferior vena cava (IVC) constriction, changes in IVC BP, or congestive heart failure.

#### Endocrine Effects of Positive Pressure Ventilation on Renal Function

Several different types of hormones may also influence urine output during mechanical ventilation. Specifically, these include ADH, ANF, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone cascade. Increases in the release of ADH, also called arginine vasopressin, from the posterior pituitary can reduce urine production by inhibiting free water excretion. The major determinant of ADH release is plasma osmolality. Reductions in BP can also cause increased ADH release. BP changes during positive pressure ventilation may precipitate ADH release through the following mechanism. Within the left atrium are volume receptors that send nerve impulses over a vagal pathway to the hypothalamus, which in turn can stimulate increases or decreases in ADH production and secretion. Baroreceptors in the carotid bodies and along the aortic arch sense changes in pressure and can also raise or lower ADH levels. 10 Because both of these areas are exposed to change in intrathoracic pressures, it follows that positive pressure ventilation can potentially affect ADH secretion. An interesting finding is that negative pressure ventilation inhibits ADH release and produces a diuretic effect, in contrast to positive pressure ventilation, which enhances ADH release and results in oliguria.

Atrial natriuretic factor (also known as atrial natriuretic peptide [ANP]) is another hormone that appears to be intimately involved in fluid and electrolyte balance during positive pressure ventilation. ANF is normally released when the atria are distended. When it is released, it causes an increased secretion of sodium (natriuresis) and water (diuresis) in an attempt to reduce the blood volume and stretch on the atria. Positive pressure ventilation and PEEP can reduce atrial filling pressure by either causing mechanical compression of the atria or decreasing right atrial stretch from low venous return. Reducing atrial stretch leads to decreased secretion of ANF. Reduced ANF levels contribute to water and sodium retention during positive pressure ventilation.<sup>5</sup>

Increased sympathetic tone is associated with increases in plasma renin activity. This appears to be another major factor in sodium and water retention during positive pressure ventilation and PEEP. The increased plasma renin activity activates the reninangiotensin-aldosterone cascade and results in retention of sodium (antinatriuresis) and water (antidiuresis). Renal synthesis of

prostaglandin tends to offset these effects but is probably insufficient to completely correct them<sup>8,9</sup> (Key Point 16.4).

**New Point 16.4** Neural and humoral factors play a critical role in fluid and electrolyte balance.

#### **Arterial Blood Gases and Kidney Function**

Changes in  $P_aO_2$  and  $P_aCO_2$  contribute to the effects of mechanical ventilation on renal function. Decreasing  $P_aO_2$  values in patients with respiratory failure have been shown to cause a reduction in renal function and a decrease in urine flow. In fact,  $P_aO_2$  levels below 40 mm Hg (severe hypoxemia) can dramatically interfere with normal renal function. Similarly, acute hypercapnia (i.e.,  $P_aCO_2 > 65$  mm Hg) can also severely impair renal function.

#### **Implications of Impaired Renal Effects**

In seriously ill, mechanically ventilated patients, administering positive pressure increases water and sodium retention, resulting in weight gain and in some cases pulmonary edema. To compound this problem, reduced renal function in these patients can complicate fluid and electrolyte management. Additionally, many drugs (e.g., sedatives and neuromuscular blocking agents) and their metabolites are excreted by the kidney. Altered renal function can prolong the effects of these drugs and affect patient care.

## EFFECTS OF MECHANICAL VENTILATION ON LIVER AND GASTROINTESTINAL FUNCTION

Some patients on positive pressure ventilation and PEEP show evidence of liver malfunction as reflected by a rise in serum bilirubin (>2.5 mg/100 mL), even when no evidence of preexisting liver disease is present. This may be a result of a drop in cardiac output, an increased diaphragmatic force against the liver, a decrease in portal venous flow, or an increase in splanchnic resistance. Regardless of the mechanism, these changes lead to hepatic ischemia and impaired liver function.

Positive pressure ventilation increases splanchnic resistance, decreases splanchnic venous outflow, and may contribute to gastric mucosal ischemia, which can increase the risk for GI bleeding and gastric ulcers. Both of these are complications frequently seen in critically ill patients. These changes are associated with increased permeability of the gastric mucosal barrier. Many patients are treated with antacids or histamine-2 blocking agents (e.g., cimetidine) to avoid GI bleeding from acute stress ulceration. However, because these agents increase gastric pH, they may increase the risk for nosocomial pneumonias. As discussed in Chapter 14, several studies have suggested that oral sucralfate may reduce gastric mucosal bleeding without altering gastric pH, thus reducing the risk for developing nosocomial pneumonias in mechanically ventilated patients. Clinical findings are, however, controversial, and the use of sucralfate is not recommended at this time for patients at risk for GI bleeding.<sup>12</sup>

Another problem that is often encountered with patients receiving positive pressure ventilation involves gastric distention. Gastric distention can result from swallowing air that leaks around endotracheal tube cuffs or when positive pressure ventilation is

delivered by mask. Use of a gastric tube can remove this air and decompress the stomach.

## NUTRITIONAL COMPLICATIONS DURING MECHANICAL VENTILATION

The nutritional status of patients must be carefully monitored and maintained if they are to recover from their illness and be weaned from mechanical ventilation. Both medical and surgical patients are subject to malnutrition during serious illness because of inadequate intake of food and increased metabolic rate associated with fever and wound healing<sup>13</sup> (Key Point 16.5). Many patients who develop respiratory failure already exhibit some form of malnutrition before admission to the hospital, usually caused by a preexisting chronic disease.<sup>14</sup> Furthermore, patients receiving ventilatory support are generally unable to take oral feedings because of the endotracheal tube. Unless special routes for nutritional support are provided, such as nasogastric feedings or intravenous hyperalimentation, these patients will inevitably develop severe malnutrition.

Nutritional depletion can cause several deleterious effects on patients (Box 16.2). <sup>14</sup> Malnutrition alters a patient's ability to respond effectively to infection, impairs wound healing, and severely reduces the ability to maintain spontaneous ventilation from weakened respiratory muscles. It is important to understand that overfeeding can also lead to problems by increasing oxygen consumption ( $\dot{V}O_2$ ), carbon dioxide production ( $\dot{V}CO_2$ ), and the need for increased  $\dot{V}_E$ , resulting in an increase in the WOB. Feedings must be of the appropriate type and in the appropriate amount. <sup>14</sup>

**Key Point 16.5** Critically ill patients are subject to malnutrition because of inadequate intake of food and hypermetabolism associated with fever and wound healing.

### BOX **16.2**

## Effects of Malnourishment on Mechanically Ventilated Patients

- Reduced response to hypoxia and hypercapnia
- Muscle atrophy from prolonged bed rest and lack of use; includes respiratory muscles, especially if the patient is apneic and on controlled ventilation
- Muscle wasting, including the respiratory muscles, from lack of nutrition
- Respiratory tract infections from impaired cell immunity and reduced or altered macrophage activity
- Decreased surfactant production and development of atelectasis
- Reduced ability of the pulmonary epithelium to replicate, which slows healing of damaged tissue
- Lower serum albumin levels, which affect colloid oncotic pressures and can contribute to pulmonary edema formation (colloid oncotic pressures <11 mm Hg with normal left atrial pressure)

#### **BOX 16.3** Assessment of Nutritional Status

- Body composition
- · Actual versus predicted body weight
- · Anthropometric measurements (limb circumference and skin fold measurements)
- · Fat versus lean muscle mass
- · Protein deficiencies
- · Creatinine/height index (24-hour urine creatinine excreted to patient's height in centimeters) < 6.0 considered critical protein deficiency
- Visceral protein malnutrition
- Serum albumin <3.5 g/dL</li>
- Transferrin <300 mg</li>
- Immunodeficiency
- · Decreased skin test response to known recall antigens

Assessment of a patient's resting energy expenditure provides information about a patient's daily caloric requirements. Box 16.3 lists parameters for assessing nutritional status. Once these have been evaluated, a correct feeding schedule can be instituted. Resting energy expenditure can be calculated using standard (e.g., Harris-Benedict) equations or measured using indirect calorimetry (see Chapter 10 for a discussion of indirect calorimetry). Indirect calorimetry involves measuring inspired and expired volumes,  $\dot{V}O_2$ , and  $\dot{V}CO_2$ . Many current-generation intensive care unit ventilators have incorporated the technology for obtaining indirect calorimetry measurements into their designs. Nutritional supplements should always be delivered by the most natural route possible. Oral feedings are the first choice, followed by nasogastric feedings and catheters introduced into the GI tract. If enteral (through the gut) feedings are not possible, parenteral (through a vein) nutrition is provided. Intravenous feedings can be administered via a peripheral vein or a central vein. Feedings should be given in adequate doses to restore the

nutritional status of the patient without overfeeding. One final note: Intravenous feedings are a potential vehicle for transmitting nosocomial infections and should therefore be carefully handled.

## SUMMARY

- Positive pressure ventilation can significantly alter cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological, renal, and gastrointestinal function.
- The degree to which positive pressure ventilation impairs cardiac output depends on the patient's lung and chest wall compliance, airway resistance ( $R_{aw}$ ), and the  $\overline{P}_{aw}$ .
- During positive pressure ventilation, the use of high V<sub>T</sub> or high levels of PEEP may cause the pulmonary capillaries to be stretched and narrowed, resulting in an increased resistance to blood flow through the pulmonary circulation. This in turn leads to an increased RV afterload and ultimately an increase in the resting volume of the right ventricle.
- Reductions in cardiac output that occur with positive pressure ventilation may be caused by myocardial dysfunction and are associated with reduced perfusion of the myocardium and the resultant myocardial ischemia.
- Positive pressure ventilation can alter cerebral perfusion by causing a decrease in cardiac output and mean arterial BP or by causing an increase in CVP, which can cause an increase
- Changes in renal function associated with positive pressure ventilation can be attributed to hemodynamic changes resulting from high intrathoracic pressures and humoral responses, including ADH, ANF, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone changes occurring with positive pressure ventilation and abnormal pH, PaCO2, and PaO2.
- Malnutrition alters a patient's ability to effectively respond to infection, impairs wound healing, and severely reduces the ability to maintain spontaneous ventilation from weakened respiratory muscles.
