echanical ventilation has been shown to be an effective method of treating patients unable to achieve effective gas exchange. Selecting an appropriate tidal volume

 $(V_T)$  and respiratory rate or frequency (f) to achieve a desired minute ventilation  $(\dot{V}_E)$  is important when initiating volume-controlled mechanical ventilation. This chapter examines how

VE and related variables are set during the initiation of volume ventilation and then focuses on the settings required to initiate positive pressure ventilation.

### **DETERMINING INITIAL VENTILATOR SETTINGS DURING VOLUME-CONTROLLED VENTILATION**

Initiating volume control ventilation for a patient requires an understanding of the interaction of several key variables, including V<sub>E</sub> settings (V<sub>T</sub> and f), inspiratory gas flow, flow waveform, inspiratory-to-expiratory (I/E) ratio, pressure limit, inflation hold (inspiratory pause), inspiratory pressure, and positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP).

The design characteristics of mechanical ventilator control panels can vary. For example, many have V<sub>T</sub> and rate settings, such as the Medtronics Puritan Bennett 840 and 980 ventilators (Medtronic Minimally Invasive Therapies), whereas other ventilators, such as the Servo-i (Getinge, Göteborg, Sweden), also allow the operator to set  $\dot{V}_E$  and f. Some ventilator manufacturers provide time cycling and have controls for inspiratory time percentage, and still others control total cycle time (TCT).

It is important for clinicians charged with the responsibility of instituting mechanical ventilation to have a fundamental understanding of the various control variables available on intensive care unit (ICU) ventilators. Then, regardless of the ventilator involved, they will possess enough information to make an informed decision about how to proceed. The following discussion begins with the basics:  $\dot{V}_{\rm F}$ ,  $V_{\rm T}$ , and f. A more detailed discussion of initial ventilator setting for patients with specific cardiopulmonary and neuromuscular disorders is provided in Chapter 7.

### **INITIAL SETTINGS DURING VOLUME-CONTROLLED VENTILATION**

### **Setting Minute Ventilation**

The primary goal of volume-controlled continuous mandatory ventilation (VC-CMV) is to achieve a  $\dot{V}_E$  that matches the patient's metabolic needs. A typical healthy person at rest has a total oxygen consumption (V O2) of about 250 mL/min and a carbon dioxide production (V O2) of about 200 mL/min. As the patient's metabolic rate increases, ventilation must change to meet the need for increased O<sub>2</sub> uptake and CO<sub>2</sub> removal (Box 6.1).

Metabolic rate is directly related to body mass and surface area in humans. Measurements of heat production (i.e., direct calorimetry) provide a reliable method to quantify metabolic rate; however, direct calorimetry requires a considerable amount of space and time commitment and is typically reserved for research purposes. Indirect calorimetry, which uses measurements of inspired and expired O2 and CO2 to estimate energy expenditure, can be accomplished with significantly less time and effort. Indeed, advances in computer technology have made it relatively easy to perform indirect calorimetry in the clinical setting. (See Chapter 10 for more information about indirect calorimetry.)

A more commonly used method to estimate metabolic rate and caloric intake involves using equations that were derived from laboratory studies performed in the early part of the 20th century.

BOX 6.1

Determining Pressure, Tidal Volume, Respiratory Frequency, and Minute Ventilation to Establish Initial Ventilator **Settings for Volume and Pressure Ventilation** 

### Volume Control Ventilation

### Minute Ventilation (V<sub>F</sub>)

Men  $\dot{V}_E = 4 \times \text{body surface area (BSA)}$ Women  $\dot{V}_E = 3.5 \times BSA$ 

#### Increase This by

5%/° F above 99° F or 10%/° C above 37° C

20% for metabolic acidosis

50% to 100% if resting energy expenditure is equally increased

#### Decrease This by

10%/° C between 35° C and 37° C

#### Tidal Volume (V<sub>T</sub>)

Minimum of 4 mL/kg ideal body weight (IBW) (consider sigh or lung recruitment maneuver and high PEEP)\*

Maximum of 8 mL/kg IBW (do not use sigh)

Maintain transpulmonary pressure (P<sub>1</sub>) <30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O

#### Respiratory Frequency (f)

 $f = f = \dot{V}_F/V_T$ 

Respiratory rate typically ranges from 12 to 18 breaths per

#### Pressure Ventilation

### Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV)

To overcome system resistance in the spontaneous mode (PSV or continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP]) or in the intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) mode, set pressure at peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) - (Pplat), where Pplat is measured in a volume breath or at approximately 5 to 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. To provide ventilatory support, set pressure to achieve a target  $V_T$  as described for VC-CMV.

### Pressure-Controlled Ventilation (PC-CMV)

Set pressure to achieve  $V_T$  as described for VC-CMV. Set frequency to achieve the same  $V_F$ .  $f = V_F / V_{T_F}$ 

Set inspiratory percentage to achieve an inspiratory/expiratory (I/E) ratio of greater than or equal to 1:2.

\*For patients being treated for ARDS, lower tidal volumes (e.g., 4 mL/ kg) may be necessary to ensure that the  $P_{plat}$  <30 cm  $H_2O$ . See Chapter 13 for additional information regarding the use of lung recruitment maneuvers in lung protective strategies used for the treatment of

 $^\dagger$ In patients with neuromuscular disorders or cerebral disorders, a V $_{\sf T}$  of >10 mL/kg might be required, but P<sub>plat</sub> should still be maintained at 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O

With these equations, metabolic rate is estimated on the basis of an individual's gender and body surface area (BSA).1,2 BSA can be calculated using the DuBois BSA formula: BSA =  $0.007184 \times 10^{-2}$  $Ht^{0.725} \times W^{0.425}$ , where BSA = body surface area in square meters, Ht = body height in centimeters, and W = body weight in kilograms. (It can also be determined using a nomogram such as the one shown in Fig. 6.1. Notice that this nomogram is based on the aforementioned DuBois BSA formula.)

![](_page_2_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 6.1** Dubois body surface chart. To determine the body surface area (BSA), locate the height in inches or centimeters on scale I and weight in pounds or kilograms on scale II. Connect these two points with a straight line. Where the line intersects scale III determines BSA in square meters. (From Boothby WM, Sandiford RB: Nomographic charts for the calculation of the metabolic rate by the gasometry method, *Boston Med Surg J* 185:337, 1921.)

As shown in Box 6.1,  $\dot{V}_E$  can also be estimated using a patient's BSA.  $\dot{V}_E$  is approximately equal to four times the BSA in men and three and a half times the BSA in women. For example, the estimated  $\dot{V}_E$  for an adult male patient with a BSA of 2.1 m² would be:

$$\dot{V}_{E} \text{ for a male } = 4 \times BSA \, = \, 4 \times 2.1 \; m^{2} \, = \, 8.4 \frac{L}{min} \label{eq:velocity}$$

Notice that this calculation of  $\dot{V}_E$  assumes that the individual is a typical healthy adult. The  $\dot{V}_E$  must be adjusted for abnormal conditions, such as the presence of hypothermia or hyperthermia, a hypermetabolic state, and metabolic acidosis. Lung disorders that increase physiological dead space will also require an increase in  $\dot{V}_E$ . For example, suppose that the patient already mentioned requires an initial  $\dot{V}_E$  of 8.4 L/min but has a temperature of 39° C.

 $\dot{V}_E$  would have to be increased by 10% for each degree above 37° C: a total increase of 20% of 8.4 = 1.68; therefore the new  $\dot{V}_E$  would be 8.4 + 1.68 = 10.08 L/min.

Settings for  $V_T$  and f should therefore be derived from the initial calculation of  $\dot{V}_E$  (4  $\times$  BSA for men and 3.5  $\times$  BSA for women) and adjusted if the patient demonstrates a pathological condition like those mentioned previously.  $V_T$  can be determined by the method described in the discussion that follows. To determine breathing frequency (f), divide the  $\dot{V}_E$  by the  $V_T$  ( $\dot{V}_E/V_T=f$ ) (Case Study 6.1).

In many cases, physicians order settings for mechanical ventilation that include volume and rate and do not typically specify  $\dot{V}_E$ . The respiratory therapist must keep in mind that the ordered rate and volume must reflect the  $\dot{V}_E$  needs of the patient.

### Case Study 6.1

### Minute Ventilation (V<sub>E</sub>) Needs

A physician orders a tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>) of 500 mL and a rate of 12 breaths/min for a 25-year-old woman with a body surface area of 2.0 m². The estimated  $\dot{V}_E$  will be 3.5  $\times$  2.0 =7.0 L/min. What is the ordered  $\dot{V}_E$  compared with the estimated  $\dot{V}_{\text{E}}$  needed? If you were the respiratory therapist in this situation, how would you address the discrepancy between the physician's order and the actual  $\dot{V}_E$  required?

### BOX 6.2

### Calculating Ideal Body Weight (IBW) for Women and Men

Women: IBW(Ib) = 105 + 5(H - 60),

where H is height in inches.

For example, the IBW of a 66-in-tall woman is 105 + 5(66 - 10)60) = 105 + 5 = 135 lb (61.4 kg). (To convert to kilograms, divide by 2.2.)

Men IBW(Ib) = 106 + 6(H - 60).

For example, the IBW of a 66-in-tall man is 106 + 6(66 - 10)60) = 106 + 6 = 142 lb (64.5 kg).

### **Tidal Volume and Rate**

The normal spontaneous V<sub>T</sub> for a healthy adult is about 5 to 7 mL/ kg with a spontaneous respiratory rate of 12 to 18 breaths/min.  $\dot{V}_E$ is approximately 100 mL/kg of ideal body weight (IBW). Box 6.2 provides formulas that can be used to calculate IBW.3

When determining V<sub>T</sub> for ventilated patients, a range of 6 to 8 mL/kg of IBW is typically used for adults and 4 to 8 mL/kg IBW for infants and children. Lower V<sub>T</sub> rates (e.g., 4 mL/kg IBW) have been successfully used for ventilation of the lungs of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). These lower V<sub>T</sub> rates are described as lung protective ventilatory strategies that minimize the damaging effects associated with overdistention of the alveoli.

It is important to understand that an adult's lungs do not get larger as he or she gains weight. For example, a male 5-ft, 6-in adult weighing 100 kg would require the same V<sub>T</sub> as a male 5-ft, 6-in adult weighing 65 kg. Remember, however, that a heavier patient would have a higher metabolic rate and thus a higher V<sub>E</sub>. Critical Care Concept 6.1 provides an example of how to estimate tidal volumes based on IBW (Key Point 6.1). (It is interesting to note that the Radford nomogram [Fig. 6.2], which was used in the past by clinicians to estimate the set  $V_T$ , is based on a  $V_T$  range of about 5 to 7 mL/kg IBW.8) (Box 6.3 and Case Study 6.2.)

An alternative method for calculating initial V<sub>T</sub> settings is to use predicted values for body weight rather than calculations of IBW. The predicted body weight of male patients can be calculated using the equation 50 + 0.91 (centimeters of height -152.4). For

### CRITICAL CARE CONCEPT 6.1

### Tidal Volume (V<sub>T</sub>) and Ideal Body Weight (IBW)

What is the lowest and highest estimated V<sub>T</sub> for a 5-ft, 6-in man (IBW = 65 kg)? What would the lowest and highest estimated  $V_T$  be for a 5-ft, 6-in woman?

**Key Point 6.1** A person's tidal volume increases linearly with body weight up to that person's ideal body weight.

female patients, the predicted body weight can be determined using the equation 45.5 + 0.91 (centimeters of height  $\times$  152.4).

Recommended V<sub>T</sub>s for patients on ventilation vary depending on the lung pathologic conditions. For patients with normal lungs, such as patients with a drug overdose or patients with the postoperative effects of anesthesia, an initial V<sub>T</sub> of 6 to 8 mL/kg IBW and a rate of 10 to 20 breaths/min is generally accepted.3 For patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, in which airway obstruction and resistance are high, an initial V<sub>T</sub> of 6 to 8 mL/kg IBW with a rate of 8 to 12 breaths/min is acceptable.3,12-14 In patients with chronic or acute restrictive disease, such as pulmonary fibrosis or ARDS, an initial V<sub>T</sub> of 4 to 6 mL/kg IBW with a rate of 15 to 25 breaths/min is indicated. As suggested in restrictive disease, lower V<sub>T</sub> and higher rates are used. However, high rates may not provide sufficient time for exhalation (short T<sub>E</sub>) and air can be trapped in the lungs at the end of exhalation, resulting in intrinsic PEEP (auto-PEEP). The V<sub>T</sub> should be adjusted to maintain plateau pressure less than 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and rates adjusted to minimize auto-PEEP.

A V<sub>T</sub> of more than 9 to 10 mL/kg IBW is not recommended because of the risk for high pressures and accompanying overdistention and trauma to the lung, in addition to other complications. Low-volume settings (4-8 mL/kg IBW) are beneficial in restrictive disease and may help prevent high pressures and alveolar overdistention. It is worth mentioning that using volumes as low as 4 mL/kg may contribute to atelectasis. Using V<sub>T</sub>s this low may require a recruitment maneuver or sigh breaths to avoid atelectasis. Use of lower V<sub>T</sub> may be especially important in patients receiving PEEP therapy to avoid high pressures and overdistention<sup>16,17</sup> (Key Point 6.2). Box 6.3 provides important background on how initial V<sub>T</sub> settings were selected for this text.<sup>3,7,9-14</sup>

It is important to mention that use of lung protective ventilatory strategies also includes avoiding use of excessive transpulmonary pressures (P<sub>L</sub> <30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O),\* as well as using driving pressures (i.e., P<sub>plat</sub> – PEEP) of 15 cm H<sub>2</sub>O or less. Additional information about the use of lung protective ventilatory strategies with various pathological conditions is presented in Chapters 7 and 13.

### **Tubing Compliance**

The V<sub>T</sub> set on the ventilator control panel represents the amount of gas sent to the ventilator circuit; however, not all of this volume

<sup>\*</sup>Transpulmonary pressure is the difference between alveolar pressure and pleural pressure  $(P_L = P_{alv} - P_{pl})$ .

Daily activity (patient not in a coma): add 10%; fever: add 5% per degree Fahrenheit (F) above 99° F (rectal) or add 10% per degree centigrade (C) above 37° C (rectal); altitude: add 5% for every 2000 feet above sea level; artificial airway: subtract the volume equal to half the body weight in pounds or subtract 1 mL/kg of body weight; add equipment dead space volume; metabolic acidosis: add 20%. (From Radford EP, Ferris BG Jr, Driete BC: Clinical use of a nomogram to estimate proper ventilation during artificial respirations, *N Engl J Med* 21:877, 1954.)

reaches the patient. Some of the gas volume will not be delivered to the patient because of leaks and the effects of tubing compliance.

The tubing compliance  $(C_T)$ , or system compressibility, reflects the volume (in milliliters) of gas compressed in the ventilator circuit for every centimeter of water pressure generated by the ventilator during the inspiratory phase:  $C_T = \text{change in volume}$  divided by change in pressure  $(\Delta V/\Delta P)$  in mL/cm H<sub>2</sub>O.

As pressure builds in the ventilator circuit during inspiration, the circuit expands along with the patient's lungs; therefore the total volume that goes to the circuit never reaches the patient. As expiration begins, the volume of gas trapped under pressure in the patient circuit flows out the expiratory valve with the air that leaves the patient's lungs. This volume (exhaled volume from the ventilator tubing and the patient's lungs) is often referred to as the exhaled  $V_{\rm T}$ .

The volume of gas in the circuit is referred to as the compressible volume, or the volume lost as a result of  $C_T$ . The compressible volume varies depending on the type of circuit used and is determined for each ventilator system before its use. Calculating compressible volume is especially important in infants, children, or petite patients because of the small  $V_T$  they require. A slight change in  $V_T$  may be insignificant for an adult, but it can be critical for an infant during mechanical ventilation. Thus practitioners routinely use small-bore, rigid circuits with infants because

these types of circuits are less compliant. These ventilator circuits typically have low  $C_{T}$ s and therefore have low compressible volumes. (NOTE:  $C_{T}$  for a patient's circuit changes slightly as the circuit warms, but this amount is usually not significant.)

Current ICU ventilators (e.g., Hamilton G5 [Hamilton Medical, Switzerland], Maquet Servo-i [Getinge, Göteborg, Sweden], Dräger 500 [Dräger Medical Inc., Telford, PA], Medtronics Puritan Bennett 980 [Medtronics Minimally Invasive Therapies], and Care-Fusion AVEA [CareFusion, Yorba Linda, CA]) have the capability of measuring and correcting for C<sub>T</sub>. During start-up tests of the system, these ventilators calculate the compressibility of the ventilator circuit. The operator can choose to use this correction or simply ignore it. If correction for C<sub>T</sub> is accepted, the ventilator measures the peak pressure during ventilation, calculates the volume lost to the patient circuit, and adds that volume to the set V<sub>T</sub>. When the data are displayed on the ventilator, the exhaled V<sub>T</sub> measured again corrects for C<sub>T</sub>. For example, if the set V<sub>T</sub> is 500 mL and the loss of volume is 50 mL, the ventilator actually delivers 550 mL, although it displays 500 mL as V<sub>T</sub> inspired and 500 mL of V<sub>T</sub> expired. The operator never actually "sees" the correction being made. It is important to recognize that ventilators perform this function in different ways. Therefore the clinician should understand how this function operates for the ventilator being used.

### BOX 6.3 Tidal Volume (V<sub>T</sub>) Settings

More than 50 years ago, Radford conducted an extensive study to determine normal V<sub>T</sub> and rates in human subjects.<sup>8</sup> Radford's findings influenced early recommendations on setting tidal volumes during mechanical ventilation. V<sub>T</sub>s derived from Radford's nomogram are low (range, mL/ kg). For example, a 190-lb, 6-ft man breathing at a rate of 10 breaths/min would have a V<sub>T</sub> setting of 600 mL (7.4 mL/kg ideal body weight [IBW]) based on Radford's nomogram.

Early studies in anesthesia, however, showed that using low V<sub>T</sub> very rapidly resulted in atelectasis, particularly in the lung bases. An often-cited study by Bendixon and colleagues, published in 1964, further demonstrated that a sustained high-pressure inspiration or "sigh" breath could help reverse atelectasis caused by breathing low V<sub>T</sub>. Interestingly, the actual V<sub>T</sub> rates were not reported in this study. The study defined a sigh breath as a sustained high-pressure breath, not just as a single breath with a large V<sub>T</sub>.

Beginning in the 1970s and continuing until the 1990s it was common practice for clinicians to use high V<sub>T</sub> settings (e.g., mL/kg of IBW) for all patients. This practice may have resulted from the fear that using a low V<sub>T</sub> would cause atelectasis. Unfortunately, clinicians at that time were unaware of the potential of lung injury and were more concerned with achieving an appropriate V<sub>T</sub> and maintaining acceptable arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) and arterial oxygen (PaO2) values. Their focus, although intended for the good of the patient, was nevertheless wrong.

Preliminary laboratory studies conducted in the 1990s, however, showed that high volumes along with high pressures could cause significant damage to lung tissue (see Chapter 17). In 2000, a landmark multicenter clinical trial conducted involving more than 800 patients with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome found conclusive evidence that using a V<sub>T</sub> setting of 6 mL/kg based on the predicted IBW had a lower mortality rate for this patient population than a V<sub>T</sub> of 12 mL/kg IBW.<sup>7</sup> A number of more recent clinical studies have been conducted to better define the most effective lung protective ventilatory strategies to use during mechanical ventilation. These clinical studies have corroborated previous findings and shown that there are significant benefits associated with using lower a V<sub>T</sub>.

Regardless of the method used for selecting the  $V_T$  for a patient, it is important for clinicians to be aware of the following four risks during the setup of V<sub>T</sub>:

- 1. Overdistention of lung tissue
- 2. Repeated opening and closing (recruitment/derecruitment) of alveoli
- 3. Atelectasis formation
- 4. Inadequate V<sub>T</sub> setting

![](_page_5_Picture_14.jpeg)

### Case Study 6.2

### Minute Ventilation $(\dot{V}_E)$ , Tidal Volume $(\dot{V}_T)$ , and **Respiratory Rate**

A 6-ft (72-in)-tall man weighs 190 lb and has a normal metabolic rate, temperature, and acid-base status. What is his body surface area and ideal body weight? What V<sub>E</sub>, V<sub>T</sub>, and rate would be appropriate for this patient?

If a ventilator without this capability is being used, calculation of C<sub>T</sub> can be determined during initial setup by doing the following procedure before connecting the patient to the ventilator.

- 1. Confirm there are no leaks in the circuit.
- 2. Set a low V<sub>T</sub> (100-200 mL), set PEEP at 0 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, and set inspiratory pause at 2 seconds.
- 3. Place the high-pressure limit on the highest possible setting (e.g., 120 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) so that the breath does not pressure cycle.
- 4. Manually trigger the ventilator into inspiration while occluding the Y-connector.
- 5. Record the static or plateau pressure (P<sub>plat</sub>).
- 6. Measure the volume at the exhalation valve using a respirometer.
- 7. Calculate C<sub>T</sub> by dividing measured volume by measured static pressure.

Box 6.4 provides a practice problem for calculating volume lost to C<sub>T</sub>.

### **Mechanical Dead Space Considerations**

Another consideration when setting the V<sub>T</sub> is the effects of mechanical dead space. Mechanical dead space (VDmech) is defined as the volume of gas rebreathed during ventilation. For example, to add flexibility to the patient-ventilator connection, clinicians sometimes add a 6-inch piece of corrugated tubing between the Yconnector and the tracheostomy tube connector. When the patient exhales, some of the exhaled gas will occupy the 6 inches of tubing. As the patient inhales during the next breath, the first part of the breath will contain end-expiratory gas from the previous breath, which has a lower O2 level and a higher CO2 level.

A number of devices can decrease or increase the amount of V<sub>Dmech</sub> added to the breathing circuit. For example, the use of an endotracheal tube slightly reduces V<sub>Dmech</sub> by about 1 mL/kg IBW because the tube bypasses the upper airway (mouth and nasal passages). In contrast, the addition of a Y-connector between the ventilator and patient may add about 75 mL of V<sub>Dmech</sub>.

**New Point 6.2** When setting tidal volume  $(V_T)$  and rate, the goal is not to focus so much on the exact  $V_T$  and rate, but to focus on using settings that do not harm the patient. Maintaining plateau pressure lower than 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O is very important. In some cases it even may be necessary to let P<sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> rise and pH fall outside the patient's normal values to avoid lung injury.

### BOX **6.4**

### Calculating Volume Lost to Tubing Compliance

A patient's estimated tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>) is 400 mL. Her peak pressure reading during inspiration is 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and tubing compliance ( $C_T$ ) is 2.9 mL/cm  $H_2O$ . What is the actual  $V_T$  delivery to the patient?

Volume lost = 2.9 mL/cm  $H_2O \times 30$  cm  $H_2O = 87$  mL; actual volume received by the patient = 400 - 87 mL = 313 mL. To compensate, set V<sub>T</sub> is increased to about 487 mL to deliver the desired 400 mL. As mentioned earlier, C<sub>T</sub> is important when V<sub>T</sub> settings are very low (<300 mL), such as when setting the  $V_T$ for infants and small children.

Interestingly, these two factors tend to balance each other. A heatmoisture exchanger (HME) inserted between the endotracheal tube and Y-connector adds  $V_{\rm Dmech}$  to the circuit (20–90 mL). Fortunately, the low dead space volume associated with these devices (HME of 20 mL) is usually not of clinical significance for adult patients. (This is a small dead space volume in relation to an adult  $V_{\rm T}$  and usually does not alter  $P_{\rm a}CO_2$ . However, with a higher-volume HME [90 mL],  $P_{\rm a}CO_2$  may increase above previous values.)<sup>13</sup> The addition of mechanical dead space  $V_{\rm Dmech}$  is a significant concern in patients on ventilation with lung protective ventilatory strategies (i.e.,  $V_{\rm T}$ s of 4–6 mL/kg).

# Relationship of Tidal Volume, Flow, Total Cycle Time, and Inspiratory-to-Expiratory Ratio

Each ventilator has specific settings to select for VC-CMV. As previously mentioned, the Medtronics PB 840 and 980 (Medtronics Minimally Invasive Therapies, Minneapolis, MN) allows the operator to set  $V_T$ , f, and flow, whereas the Maquet Servo-i allows the operator to set the rate and inspiratory time, or I/E ratio.

An understanding of the interrelation of inspiratory flow, inspiratory time ( $T_I$ ), expiratory time, TCT, and I/E ratio will help the clinician provide effective ventilation to a patient regardless of the type of equipment being used. Box 6.5 includes the equations that describe a variety of these interrelations. Fortunately, most modern ventilators automatically perform these calculations and display them as measured and calculated values.

### **Calculating Total Cycle Time and Respiratory Rate**

Some ventilators use  $T_I$  and  $T_E$  or TCT to determine the respiratory rate (or ventilator frequency). To determine these values, calculate the length of the respiratory cycle or the TCT (TCT =  $T_I + T_E$ ) and determine the number of cycles that occur in 1 minute (see Box 6.5, I, II, and IV). For example, if the  $T_I$  is 2 seconds and the  $T_E$  is 4 seconds, then:

$$TCT = T_1 + T_E = 2$$
 seconds  $+4$  seconds  $=6$  seconds 
$$60 \; s/TCT = f$$
 
$$60 \; s/6 \; s = 10 \; breaths/min$$

### **Calculating Inspiratory-to-Expiratory Ratio**

Some ventilators allow the clinician to set either a fixed  $T_I$  and rate or a fixed I/E.\* For example, the Servo-i ventilator requires the respiratory therapist to set a  $T_I$ . If the rate is set at 10 breaths/min, the TCT is 6 seconds (60 s/[10 breaths] = 6 s/breath). If the  $T_I$  is set at 2 seconds, the expiratory time is 4 seconds ( $T_E$  will be TCT –  $T_I$  = 6 seconds – 2 seconds = 4 seconds). The resultant I/E ratio will therefore be 1:2 ( $T_I/T_E$  = 2 s/4 s = 2:4 or 1:2) (see Box 6.5, I through V).

The I/E ratio is typically expressed so that the  $T_I$  is equal to 1. For example, if the I/E ratio is 2:3, it is expressed as 1:1.5. Dividing the numerator and denominator by  $T_I$  reduces the expression to 1:X (see Box 6.5, V).

I/E ratios of 2:1 or 3:1 are called inverse I/E ratios. When I/E ratios are inversed (I greater than E),  $T_E$  takes on the value of 1. For example, if the  $T_I$  is 3 seconds and the  $T_E$  is 2 seconds, the I/E ratio is 3:2 or 1.5:1 (see Box 6.5, VI). (NOTE: In previous-generation

### Interrelation of Tidal Volume, Flow Rate, Inspiratory Time, Expiratory Time, Total Cycle Time, and Respiratory Rate

I. Total cycle time (TCT) equals inspiratory time (T<sub>I</sub>) plus expiratory time:

$$TCT = T_1 + T_E$$

II. Respiratory rate (f) equals 1 minute (60 seconds) divided by TCT.

$$f = \frac{1min}{TCT} = \frac{60s}{TCT(\textit{s})} = breaths/min$$

Calculate TCT from f.

$$TCT = 60 \text{ s/f}$$

III. Inspiratory-to-expiratory (I/E)ratio equals inspiratory time divided by expiratory time.

$$I/E = T_I/T_E$$

Remember:  $TCT = T_I + T_E$  and  $TCT - T_I = T_E$  IV. To calculate  $T_E$  from f and  $T_I$ :

$$\begin{array}{l} f \,=\, 60 \text{ s/TCT and TCT} \,=\, T_I + T_E \\ T_E \,=\, TCT - T_I \end{array}$$

V. Reducing the I/E ratio to its simplest form: Divide the numerator and denominator by T<sub>I</sub>.

$$I/E = \frac{\frac{T_I}{T_I}}{\frac{T_E}{T_I}}$$

VI. Determine the I/E when inverse ratio ventilation is used: I/E for inverse ventilation equals the division of both the numerator and the denominator by the expiratory time.

$$I/E = \frac{\frac{T_I}{T_E}}{\frac{T_E}{T_E}}$$

VII. Calculate T<sub>I</sub>, T<sub>E</sub>, and TCT from I/E and f.

$$\begin{split} TCT &= T_I + T_E \text{ and } f = 60 \text{ s/TCT} \\ f &= 60 \text{ s/}(T_I + T_E) \\ T_I + T_E &= 60 \text{ s/f} \end{split}$$

VIII. Calculate  $T_I$  from  $V_T$  and flow  $(\dot{V})$ 

$$T_1 = V_T/V$$

IX. Calculate  $V_T$  from  $T_I$  and  $\dot{V}$ .

$$V_T = \dot{V} \times T_I$$

X. Calculate V from  $V_T$  and  $T_I$ .

$$\dot{V} = V_T/T_I$$

<sup>\*</sup>Because ventilation software can be updated frequently, users should check their equipment updates to determine actual function.

ventilators [e.g., Puritan Bennett 7200], the digital display of I/E was expressed as 1:X; thus inverse ratios will appear, e.g., as 1:0.5, rather than 2:1.)

Using inverse ratios can cause significant complications, such as increases in mean airway pressure (Paw) and physiological dead space, decreases in venous return and cardiac output, and increased air trapping (auto-PEEP). For this reason, I/E ratios are usually set at 1:1.5 to 1:4 so that expiration is longer than inspiration, and the adverse effects of positive pressure are reduced. (NOTE: Inverse I/E ratios have been successfully used in some circumstances, such as to improve oxygenation in patients with ARDS.)

### Inspiratory Time, Tidal Volume, and Flow

T<sub>I</sub> can be determined if V<sub>T</sub> and flow are known, and the flow pattern is a constant or square waveform. If V<sub>T</sub> is 0.5 L and flow is 2 L/s, T<sub>I</sub> equals 0.5 L/2 L/s, or 0.25 seconds. The flow control on adult ventilators is usually calibrated in liters per minute, so the value for flow needs to be converted to liters per second. For example, a flow of 30 L/min equals 30 L/60 s or 0.5 L/s.

Conversely, V<sub>T</sub> can be determined when T<sub>I</sub> and flow are known and flow is constant: ( $V_T = \text{flow} \times T_I$ ). If  $T_I$  is 1 second and flow is 0.5 L/s,  $V_T = (1 \text{ second}) \times (0.5 \text{ L/s}) = 0.5 \text{ L (see Box 6.5, VII and })$ VIII).

### Flow, Tidal Volume, and Inspiratory Time

Flow can be determined whether V<sub>T</sub> and T<sub>I</sub> are known. For example, if  $V_T$  is 500 mL and  $T_I$  is 1 second, the flow equals  $V_T/T_I$ , which is 500 mL/1 s, or 0.5 L/([1/60]th of a minute), or 30 L/min (multiply numerator and denominator by 60 to convert to minutes) (see Box 6.5, IX). These examples assume that flow is constant (Case Study 6.3 and Critical Care Concept 6.2).

### **Inspiratory Flow and Flow Patterns**

During VC-CMV, the clinician may have the option to select a variety of ventilator flows and flow patterns. These selections are reviewed in this section.

### Rate of Gas Flow

As previously discussed, the flow setting on a mechanical ventilator determines how fast the inspired gas will be delivered to the

### Case Study 6.3

### Inspiratory/Expiratory Ratio (I/E) and Flow

You are asked to place a 63-year-old woman who is diagnosed with severe congestive heart failure on ventilation. She is 5-ft, 8-in tall and weighs 185 lb. She is orally intubated with a 7.5-mm endotracheal tube. Her arterial blood gases on a nonrebreathing mask are pH = 7.18,  $P_aCO_2 = 83 \text{ mm Hg}, P_aO_2 = 98 \text{ mm Hg}, HCO_3^- = 31 \text{ mEq/L}.$ What recommendations would you make regarding her initial ventilator settings of V<sub>T</sub>, f, I/E, and flow?

patient. During controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV), high flows shorten T<sub>I</sub> and may result in higher peak pressures and poor gas distribution. Conversely, slower flows may reduce peak pressures, improve gas distribution, and increase Paw at the expense of increasing T<sub>I</sub>. Unfortunately, shorter T<sub>E</sub> can lead to air trapping, and using a longer T<sub>I</sub> may also cause cardiovascular side effects. 18 In reality, actual normal inspiratory times have never been measured, and much of clinical practice involved in setting appropriate T<sub>I</sub> requires clinician observation of the patient's response to set values. These may require adjustments.

In general, the goal should be to use the shortest T<sub>I</sub> possible. Achieving a short T<sub>I</sub> usually is not difficult to attain in patients with normal lungs. As a beginning point, flow is normally set to deliver inspiration in about 1 second (range 0.8-1.2 seconds).<sup>3,13</sup> An I/E ratio of 1:2 or less (usually about 1:4) is also recommended. This can be achieved with an initial peak flow setting of about 60 L/min (range L/min). It is important to remember that the flow must be set to meet a patient's inspiratory demand so that the spontaneously breathing patient is not trying to breathe in without the ventilator supplying adequate gas flow (see Fig. 5.4). 19

When patient-triggered breaths are present during VC-CMV, the patient's respiratory rate may actually vary depending on flow and T<sub>I</sub> setting. For example, if V<sub>T</sub> is constant and the flow setting is increased, T<sub>I</sub> will be shorter and the patient may begin to increase the rate at which he or she triggers the ventilator. Thus T<sub>I</sub> can affect breath frequency when patient triggering is present.<sup>20</sup> The reason this occurs is not known at this time, but clinicians should be aware of this phenomenon.

A long T<sub>I</sub> (requiring time constants) has been shown to improve ventilation in nonhomogeneous lungs such as those seen in ARDS.<sup>21</sup> Fast flows (i.e., requiring fewer time constants to fill the lungs) may benefit patients with increased airway resistance (Raw), as in COPD, providing longer TE, which in turn will reduce or prevent the risk for air trapping (long T<sub>E</sub> of time constants). Tobin and colleagues reported that using flow rates up to 100 L/min can improve gas exchange in patients with COPD by providing a longer T<sub>E</sub>. <sup>22</sup> It is important to recognize that flows that are set too high can result in uneven distribution of inspired air in the lung and also cause immediate and persistent tachypnea, in addition to increased peak inspiratory pressures<sup>23</sup> (Key Point 6.3).

### Inspiratory Flow in a Time-Cycled Ventilator

A time-cycled ventilator is set with the following parameters:  $V_T = 500$  mL (0.5 L), f = 12 breaths/min, and I/E = 1:4. If a constant flow waveform is used, what is the inspiratory gas flow?

**Key Point** 6.3 The clinician must carefully adjust the flow and flow pattern to suit the patient's ventilatory needs.

![](_page_8_Figure_3.jpeg)

Fig. 6.3 Flow-time waveforms can take on a variety of forms. The most common are constant (square or rectangular) and descending ramp (decelerating ramp).

### BOX **6.6**

# Tidal Volume (V<sub>T</sub>), Rate, Inspiratory Time (T<sub>I</sub>), and Flow on the LTV 1200

The CareFusion LTV 1200 ventilator has controls for  $V_T$ , rate, and a  $T_I$  setting. Flow is determined by the set  $V_T$  and  $T_I$ . (Flow =  $V_T/T_I$ .) Inspiratory flow is a descending ramp during volume-targeted mandatory breaths. The peak flow is determined by the ventilator so that  $V_T$  is delivered during the set  $T_I$ . Inspiration ends when flow decreases to 50% of peak or 10 L/min, whichever is highest.

Total cycle time (TCT) can be calculated using the following equation: TCT = 60/f.  $T_E$  becomes TCT minus  $T_I$  ( $T_E = TCT - T_I$ ). Suppose, for example, that the inspiratory time is set at 1.0 seconds and the rate is set at 12. The TCT will equal 60/12 or 5 seconds.  $T_E$  equals 5 seconds — 1 second, or 4 seconds, and the I/E is therefore 1:4.

rate depends on the patient's lung condition. For example, postoperative patients recovering from anesthesia may have modest flow demands, whereas a young adult with pneumonia and a strong hypoxemic drive would have a high flow demand. The most common flow patterns used clinically are the constant flow and descending (decelerating) flow waveforms.

**Constant flow.** Constant flow patterns are often used by clinicians because it is most familiar to them or it is the only flow pattern available on the ventilator in use. Constant flow patterns are also called rectangular and square waveforms. When initiating ventilation, a rectangular (constant) flow pattern is acceptable. Generally a constant flow pattern provides the shortest  $T_{\rm I}$  of all the available flow patterns with an equivalent peak flow rate setting.

**Descending ramp.** The amount of gas flow delivered at the beginning of the breath is probably the major determinant of patient effort and work of breathing (WOB). A descending (decelerating) flow waveform has a distinct advantage compared with other waveform patterns. With a descending pattern, flow is greatest at the beginning of inspiration, when patient flow demand is the highest. The descending waveform occurs naturally in pressure ventilation. Box 6.6 shows an example in which the ventilator automatically sets the flow at a descending ramp and calculates the flow rate based on  $V_T$  and  $T_I$  during VC-CMV.

**Ascending ramp.** The ascending ramp provides a progressive increase in flow. The ascending ramp is currently not used by most clinicians and is available only on a few older-generation ventilators. There are no compelling studies that support the use of the ascending flow ramp.<sup>6</sup>

**Sine flow.** The sine flow pattern produces a tapered flow at the end of the inspiratory phase. Although it has been suggested that this type of flow pattern may contribute to a more even distribution of gas in the lungs than the flow of the constant flow ventilator, it is not commonly used clinically, and additional clinical studies will be required to verify its efficacy.  $^{24}$   $P_{aw}$  and peak pressures are similar to those seen with the sine and square wave patterns, although peak pressures are higher with the sine wave than the square flow when airway resistance is increased, such as in acute asthma.  $^{25}$ 

Comparison of descending ramp and constant flow. Most clinical studies designed to investigate the effects of using various ventilator waveforms have compared the constant waveform with the descending (decelerating) ramp. As one changes from a constant to a descending ramp, peak pressure is lower and  $P_{aw}$  is higher.\* Studies comparing the descending flow pattern with the constant flow pattern suggest that the descending flow pattern improves the distribution of gas in the lungs, reduces dead space, and increases oxygenation by increasing mean and plateau airway pressures.  $^{3,13,21,25-27}$  It is important to remember that in situations in which plateau pressure ( $P_{\rm plat}$ ) is critical, changing to a descending ramp to reduce peak pressures may increase the  $P_{\rm aw}$ .

Concerns about high peak inspiratory pressure and mean airway pressure. The clinician must decide when selecting a particular waveform whether  $P_{aw}$  is more important for the patient than are concerns of high peak inspiratory pressure (PIP). When  $R_{aw}$  and flows are high, peak pressures will be high if an ascending flow pattern is used. Much of this pressure is dissipated in overcoming the  $R_{aw}$  and may not reach the alveolar level. Thus high peak pressures do not always increase the risk for damage to lung parenchyma. An example of a patient population in which this can occur involves patients with acute asthma experiencing severe bronchospasm, mucosal edema, and increased secretion production. It is important to recognize, however, that there is a risk that some of the high pressures may reach normal lung areas, which could be damaging in this group of patients.  $^{14}$ 

 $<sup>{}^{*}</sup>T_{I}$  will also be longer unless the ventilator is time cycled.

**Effects of changing flow pattern in time-cycled versus volume-cycled ventilators.** For time-cycled machines (e.g., Hamilton Galileo G5 [Hamilton Medical, Switzerland], Servo-i, Dräger Evita Infinity V500 [Dräger, Inc., Telford, PA]), changing from constant flow to another flow pattern does not change the I/E ratio. However, it does change the peak flow required to deliver the volume in the time provided (T<sub>I</sub>). With any ventilator, changing from one waveform to another can vary the peak flow delivery and distribution of flow. Table 6.1 shows an example of how peak flow varies between four different flow patterns in a time-cycled situation.

In volume-cycled ventilators, changing from a constant flow to a descending flow pattern does not change the peak flow selected. It does, however, change the  $T_{\rm I}$  and I/E ratio (Fig. 6.4). Consequently, the clinician may have to change the peak flow setting to accomplish volume delivery at a better I/E ratio. Table 6.2 shows an example of what occurs with the Medtronics PB 840 ventilator, which cycles based on volume (i.e., flow/time).

With the Maquet Servo-i ventilator, there is no flow waveform selector or peak flow control. During VC-CMV the machine provides a constant (rectangular) waveform. The amount of flow delivered is based on the  $V_T$  selected and  $T_I$ . The flow also varies with patient demand regardless of the method of ventilation. When the patient's inspiratory needs exceed the flow provided and pressure begins to drop by 2 cm  $H_2O$  below the measured airway pressure, the ventilator provides additional flow to the patient. Therefore volume delivery is not the set value, but rather it is influenced by the patient's flow demands. The volume set by the operator becomes the minimum volume. Most current ICU ventilators also provide this feature.

In summary, clinicians must understand how ventilator function is affected when selecting peak flow and waveform pattern. It is reasonable to suggest that there is not one set prescribed pattern or rate of flow that is best for all patients. Rather, it is important to match the pattern and rate of gas flow to the patient's needs. Box 6.7 summarizes basic findings in flow waveform studies. The following points can provide some guidance when selecting a flow waveform:

- Flow pattern selection is not a critical issue in ventilation in patients with normal lung function; descending and constant flow patterns are effective.
- A descending flow pattern may be beneficial for patients with hypoxemia and low lung compliance  $(C_L)$  by maintaining low peak pressures and high  $P_{aw}$  and improving gas distribution.  $^{27,28}$

and the inspiratory-to-expiratory (I/E) ratio becomes greater than 1:1, the ventilator will give a visual warning and a message to "decrease the rate." The alarm becomes audible when the I/E is 3:1 (displayed as "1:0.3").

V<sub>T</sub> is constant. Peak flow does not exceed its set value.

BOX **6.7** 

### Summary of Findings From Flow Waveform Studies

When initiating mechanical ventilation, most clinicians will choose to start with a descending (decelerating) ramp or a constant (rectangular) waveform for the following reasons:

- The mean airway pressure is higher with descending flow waveforms.
- The peak inspiratory pressure is higher with ascending flow waveforms and lower with descending flow waveforms.
- · Descending waveforms improve gas distribution.
- Descending waveforms improve arterial oxygenation.
- A constant (rectangular) flow pattern produces a lower P<sub>aw</sub> compared with a descending flow pattern and may be useful in ventilation in patients with severe hypotension and cardiac instability.<sup>25</sup>
- For patients with high R<sub>aw</sub>, a descending pattern is more likely to deliver a set V<sub>T</sub> at a lower pressure and provide for better distribution of air through the lung than a constant flow.<sup>26-29</sup>

# SETTING THE MINUTE VENTILATION: SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Practical considerations for setting a desired  $\dot{V}_E$  have been discussed, but a few precautions should be considered before implementing these procedures. Although an optimum inspiratory flow and flow pattern may exist for every patient, there is no prescribed formula that can be applied to ensure the best possible results for all patients. The variability in results related to setting these parameters is influenced by the condition of the patient's lungs and conductive airways and the patient's changing metabolic needs.

Consider a situation in which a patient's  $P_aO_2$  falls, his  $P_aCO_2$  rises, and his  $\dot{V}_E$  increases. Several reasons could account for this type of situation, including the presence of auto-PEEP, poor

**Key Point 6.4** Plateau pressure can be accurately measured only if the patient is not actively breathing so that a stable pressure reading can be obtained.

ventilation/perfusion  $(\dot{V}/\dot{Q})$  matching in the nonhomogeneous lung, and changes in venous return. Resolution of this situation may require changing gas flow and/or pattern,  $V_T$ , f, or I/E ratio. Using a mode of ventilation that allows some spontaneous breathing may also benefit the patient in this type of situation by allowing the spontaneously breathing patient to have some control over ventilation. There is no "bottom line" and no easy prescription. Management of the patient on mechanical ventilation is both an art and a science requiring the use of sound judgment.

# INSPIRATORY PAUSE DURING VOLUME VENTILATION

The inspiratory pause or inflation hold (also called *end-inspiratory pause*) is a maneuver that can be performed by preventing the expiratory valve from opening for a short time at the end of inspiration, when the inspiratory valve is also closed. Most ICU ventilators have an inspiratory pause button or control. As mentioned in Chapter 1, the inspiratory pause maneuver is used to obtain measurements of plateau pressure  $(P_{plat})$ , which allows estimation of the alveolar pressure  $(P_{alv})$  for the calculation of static compliance (Key Point 6.4).

Inspiratory pauses can also be selected for use with each mandatory breath to improve the distribution of air throughout the lungs regardless of the type of flow pattern used. It has been proposed that an inspiratory pause provides a longer inspiratory time, which in turn provides improved  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  matching and reduces dead space to tidal volume ratios  $(V_D/V_T \text{ ratios})^{.31,32}$ . Inspiratory pause with each breath is not commonly used in clinical practice because it may significantly increase  $P_{aw}$  and the risk of impeding venous return and cardiac output. This is particularly true when treating patients whose condition is hemodynamically unstable (i.e., hypovolemic or hypotensive).

### Clinical Scenario: Ventilatory Support Post Myocardial Infarction

After admission to a hospital for myocardial infarction, a 55-year-old man is intubated and placed on ventilatory support. The patient's IBW is 70 kg and BSA is 1.5 m². The physician requests the VC-CMV mode. What  $\dot{V}_E$ ,  $V_T$ , rate, flow, and flow pattern would be appropriate? A  $\dot{V}_E$  of 4  $\times$  1.5 = 6.0 L/min is an appropriate starting point. A  $V_T$  of 6 mL/kg would equal 420 mL for this patient. A minimum rate setting would be the  $\dot{V}_E$  divided by the  $V_T$  or 6.0 L/0.42 L = 14.2 or 14 breaths/min. Because no changes in body metabolism such as a fever are evident, we assume these initial settings would be appropriate.

No chronic pulmonary disease was mentioned, so we assume a moderate rate setting would be adequate. A flow of 40 L/min or 40 L/60 s or 0.67 L/s using a descending flow pattern would provide sufficient time for exhalation to occur. What is the  $T_{\rm I}$  in this case? Because the  $V_{\rm T}$  is 0.42 L,  $T_{\rm I}=V_{\rm T}/{\rm flow}$  or  $T_{\rm I}=0.42$  L/ (0.67 L/s) =0.63 second. The TCT is 60 s/(14 breaths/min) =4.3 s/breath.  $T_{\rm E}={\rm TCT}-T_{\rm I}=4.3$  seconds -0.63 second =3.67 seconds.  $T_{\rm I}$  is 0.63 second and  $T_{\rm E}$  is 3.67 seconds, which is an adequate time for exhalation. Note that this is a fairly short  $T_{\rm I}$  for an adult patient and may need to be increased.

### ( Clinical Scenario: Ventilator Required?

A 45-year-old man receiving VC-CMV ventilation has a V<sub>T</sub> of 800 mL and a set rate of 8 breaths/min. The actual total rate is 15 breaths/min because the patient is triggering additional breaths. Flow is set at 40 L/min using a constant flow waveform. Inspiratory pressure actually stays in the negative range (below baseline) during most of inspiration and finally peaks at 60 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. The respiratory therapist is unable to obtain an inspiratory pause maneuver to determine Pplat because the patient is actively breathing.

Using the actual rate (15 breaths/min), determine T<sub>I</sub>. TCT is 60 s/(15 breaths/min) = 4 s/breath. Flow is 40 L/min or 40 L/60 s = 0.67 L/s.  $T_I = V_T / \text{flow or } 0.8 \text{ L/} (0.67 \text{ L/s}) = 1.19 \text{ second}$ .  $T_E = TCT - T_I = 4 \text{ seconds} - 1.19 \text{ second} = 2.81 \text{ seconds}$ . The I/E ratio is about 1:3, which should be an adequate amount of time for exhalation.

The C<sub>T</sub> is 3 mL/cm H<sub>2</sub>O and was determined when the ventilator was set up. How much volume is lost to tubing compliance? The peak pressure is 60 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, so the lost volume is  $C_T \times PIP = 3$  mL/cm  $H_2O \times 60$  cm  $H_2O = 180$  mL. Of the 800 mL V<sub>T</sub>, 180 mL is lost in the circuit and is not delivered to the patient. What is the volume of gas delivered to the patient? 800 mL - 180 = 620 mL is delivered to the patient. How can the respiratory therapist correct for this loss of volume delivery to the patient? The respiratory therapist can either set the ventilator to automatically compensate for C<sub>T</sub>, if it has that feature, or manually adjust the set volume. For example, adding about 200 mL to the set volume would help compensate this loss. It is important to remember that making these adjustments will increase the set V<sub>T</sub> and also increase the patient's PIP.

In this example, the patient's problem occurs during inspiration. Why does the pressure waveform demonstrate a negative deflection during inspiration? Perhaps the flow is not adequate to meet the patient's demand. The respiratory therapist readjusted the flow to 100 L/min, but this change did not improve the situation, and the therapist reports that occasionally "he seems to trigger two tidal volumes during one inspiratory effort." What would you suggest?

There are several possible solutions. Switching to PC-CMV and adjusting the pressure to achieve the original V<sub>T</sub> or even a slightly higher volume might be appropriate. Pressure ventilation modes are more likely to deliver a flow that meets the patient demands because the ventilator can provide all the flow needed to maintain the set pressure. Another option would be to place the patient on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for a trial of spontaneous breathing and see what flow and volume the patient can achieve on his own. (This patient actually achieved a spontaneous volume of 1.2 L.) Other possible solutions are to increase the ventilator rate or V<sub>T</sub> to meet patient need or switch to pressure support ventilation (PSV) and possibly VC-IMV or pressure-controlled intermittent mandatory ventilation (PC-IMV) and use PSV for spontaneous breaths. The original ventilator settings did not provide adequate flow or volume to meet the patient ventilatory demands. (NOTE: With spontaneous V<sub>T</sub> this high, one wonders if the patient needs the ventilator.)

### **DETERMINING INITIAL VENTILATOR SETTINGS DURING PRESSURE VENTILATION**

As previously defined, pressure-targeted ventilation provides a set pressure to the patient during breath delivery, whereas V<sub>T</sub> can vary from breath to breath (see Chapter 5). There are several methods to provide a pressure breath that should be considered. This discussion begins with baseline pressure and then includes PSV, pressure-controlled ventilation, bilevel positive airway pressure, and dual-control modes (pressure-regulated volume control [PRVC] and volume support [VS]). Each of these modes has specific controls that are set by the operator (Table 6.3). Less frequently used pressure-targeted modes, such as pressure control inverse ratio ventilation, are discussed in Chapter 13, and airway pressure release ventilation is reviewed in Chapter 23.

Volume-targeted ventilation has the advantage of guaranteeing volume delivery; however, it has the disadvantage of increasing PIP as C<sub>L</sub> decreases or R<sub>aw</sub> increases. Overinflation is also a risk. Pressure-targeted breaths have the advantages of providing flow on demand and potentially limiting pressures to avoid overinflation. With pressure-targeted breath delivery, rapid initial flows may cause frictional forces (shearing) between adjacent alveoli with differing lung inflation characteristics (time constants). In addition, V<sub>T</sub> varies as lung characteristics change. Currently, there are no definitive studies that have demonstrated a clear advantage of one method over the other.34

### SETTING BASELINE PRESSURE: PHYSIOLOGICAL POSITIVE END-EXPIRATORY PRESSURE

Functional residual capacity (FRC) frequently decreases when a patient is intubated or placed in a supine position.<sup>35,36</sup> In most situations it is appropriate to use minimum levels of PEEP (3-5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) to help preserve a patient's normal FRC.\* Because only a modest amount of pressure is applied with this minimum level of PEEP, it is not considered a problem in terms of causing

<sup>\*</sup>Sometimes called compensating PEEP.

complications. In fact, not using a low level of PEEP may result in atelectasis. Use of low levels of PEEP may also be beneficial in patients with COPD who would normally pursed-lip breathe but cannot do so with an artificial airway in place (Box 6.8).

## **Determining Tidal Volume Delivery in Pressure Ventilation**

In any pressure-targeted breath the difference in pressure ( $\Delta P$ ) between baseline (PEEP + auto-PEEP) and PIP determines what is

set to establish  $V_T$  delivery. Volume delivery will also be affected by the patient's lung characteristics and any patient effort present.

There are two ways to set the pressure in pressure-targeted breaths to provide the desired  $V_T$ . One way is to deliver a volume-targeted breath to the patient at the desired  $V_T$  and measure plateau and baseline pressures. Using the same baseline pressure, the breath can be switched to pressure-targeted breath using a set pressure equal to the  $P_{\text{plat}}$ . The resulting  $V_T$  will be approximately equal to the  $V_T$  during the volume breath, as long

### BOX **6.8**

### **Factors Affecting Expiratory Gas Flow**

During normal expiration, gas flow from a lung unit (acinus) is the result of the elastic recoil of the alveolus (+2 cm  $H_2O$ ) plus the force (pressure) from recoil of the chest wall (+3 cm  $H_2O$ ) acting on the alveolar gas volume to produce a pressure gradient between the alveoli and the mouth (see figure below, part A). Notice that the total pressure (+5 cm  $H_2O$ ) at the alveolar level is greater than that at the mouth, so the air moves out of the lung.

As the exhaled air moves across the conductive airways, some of the driving pressure is lost to airway resistance,  $R_{aw}$  (-1 cm  $H_2O$ ). In normal lungs, this pressure loss is small because the intrathoracic forces exert pressure on both the alveoli and the conductive airway. In a patient with normal airways, the resilience of the airway combined with the gas pressure in the airway lumen prevents airway collapse in most regions of the lung during most phases of the respiratory cycle. The pressure in the alveolus minus the pressure drop across the airway equals the pressure in the airway lumen (+5 cm  $H_2O$  -1 cm  $H_2O$  =+4 cm  $H_2O$  intraluminal).\*

The pressure gradient changes in patients with weakened airways caused by loss of supportive connective tissue. (Loss of lung elasticity occurs with aging and in patients with pulmonary emphysema.) Part B of the figure shows an example of an alveolus with lower than normal lung elastic recoil forces (+1 cm  $H_2O$ ). The intrathoracic forces (+3 cm  $H_2O$ ) will not be affected, but the total force providing gas flow out of the lungs is lower (+4 cm  $H_2O$ ). When gas flows through an airway where  $R_{aw}$  is increased, the pressure drop is greater than in normal airways (-2 cm  $H_2O$ ). As a result, the intraluminal pressure is lower (+4 cm  $H_2O - 2$  cm  $H_2O = +2$  cm  $H_2O$ ). Because chest wall elastic recoil pressures are greater than intraluminal pressures in the small airways weakened by loss of elastic recoil forces, these small airways tend to collapse from dynamic compression. Pursed-lip breathing is an effective maneuver that helps prevent airway collapse by resisting expiration, thus raising pressures across the entire length of the airway.

For patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), it is not possible to pursed-lip breathe with an artificial airway in place and air trapping (auto-positive end-expiratory pressure [auto-PEEP]) is common. Early-generation ventilators offered an expiratory retard control, which slowed the rate of exhalation by applying resistance to the expired gas flow. Older expiratory and PEEP valves actually increased resistance to exhalation whether resistance was desired or not. Newer microprocessor ventilators do not provide an expiratory retard option, and resistance through current expiratory valves is very low. Some practitioners consider that using low levels of PEEP ( $\leq$ 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) offers a means to provide a similar effect.

### Case Study 6.4

### Tidal Volume (TV) During Pressure Control **Continuous Mandatory Ventilation (PC-CMV)**

A patient is set on 12 cm H<sub>2</sub>O of pressure during PC-CMV. If the measured  $V_T$  is 350 mL and the desired  $V_T$  is 550 mL, how would you adjust the pressure to achieve the desired  $V_T$ ?

as inspiratory time is set appropriately. Then the pressure can be adjusted as needed to obtain the desired volume delivery. The V<sub>T</sub> should then be continually monitored.

A second method to initiate pressure ventilation is to start at a low pressure (10-15 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) and check the V<sub>T</sub> before readjusting the pressure to attain the desired volume. (Box 5.4 includes a list of factors that affect volume delivery during pressure-targeted breaths.) Case Study 6.4 offers an exercise to illustrate this concept.

### **Initial Settings for Pressure Support Ventilation**

PSV is typically initiated after the patient has been on full ventilatory support and is being changed to partial support to begin the process of discontinuing ventilation. PSV is used to support spontaneous breaths in a patient with an artificial airway when IMV or spontaneous/CPAP modes are used. The pressure is set at a level sufficient to prevent respiratory muscle fatigue associated with an increased inspiratory workload.

Some clinicians recommend calculating the level of pressure support based on an estimation of total ventilatory system resistance determined while the patient is receiving VC-CMV. The resistance of the patient and the ventilator circuit during VC-CMV with constant flow can be estimated with the equation R<sub>aw</sub> =  $(PIP - P_{plat})/flow.^{36-39}$  It is probably easier and effective to set the initial PSV level to equal the transairway pressure (PIP - Pplat) after establishing these values with VC-CMV. The level of PSV can be adjusted once it has been initiated to an adequate level. Sometimes simply asking the patient if he or she feels it is easy to breathe and if he or she is getting enough air can help when adjusting initial PSV. (NOTE: Another way to determine whether an adequate amount of pressure support is being provided involves observing the patient's use of the accessory respiratory muscles [e.g., sternocleidomastoid muscle] during inspiration. Increased use of the accessory muscles of inspiration may indicate that the level of PSV is inadequate.)

The goal of adjusting PSV is threefold:

- 1. To help increase V<sub>T</sub> (4-8 mL/kg)
- 2. To decrease respiratory rate (to fewer than 30 breaths/min)
- 3. To decrease the WOB associated with breathing through an artificial airway

For patients with lung disease, levels of 8 to 14 cm H<sub>2</sub>O are typically used to compensate for additional work associated with breathing through a tube and ventilator system. For patients without lung disease, about 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O should be adequate to compensate for the additional WOB.

When patients, particularly infants, are receiving CPAP through a ventilator, it is recommended that pressure support is added if a high level of CPAP (10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) is being used. CPAP by

itself may increase WOB, and adding pressure support reduces this workload.40

As previously discussed in this chapter, V<sub>T</sub> selection varies depending on the patient's lung condition. Low-volume and highfrequency alarms must be set appropriately because a number of factors can change the  $V_T$  and  $\dot{V}_E$ . If a backup ventilation mode is available on the ventilator, it is also appropriate to set the backup ventilation parameters for the patient, particularly if PSV is being used by itself.

When patients with COPD are placed on ventilation with PSV, it may be prudent to use graphic displays of pressure and flow versus time to monitor their status. These patients often have active short inspirations. In addition, if the patient begins to exhale actively during flow delivery from the ventilator, the flow may not drop to the necessary cycling value. Consequently, the ventilator breath may not end as normally expected, resulting in a sudden rise in the pressure curve at the end of the breath<sup>41</sup> (Fig. 6.5). The breath may actually pressure cycle. This situation can also occur in other patients when a low-flow criterion for ending inspiration is used. This can also induce expiratory muscle activity.<sup>42</sup> The problem can be avoided by using a ventilator with adjustable flowcycling characteristics for patients demonstrating expiratory muscle activity. A cycle criterion of 40% of peak flow is an appropriate starting point for a patient with COPD. (NOTE: Using a low-flow cycling value [10%] may be appropriate for patients with restrictive disorders [Case Study 6.5].)

### **Initial Settings for Pressure Control Ventilation**

Rate, inspiratory time, and I/E ratio are set in PC-CMV as they are with VC-CMV. The pressure gradient (PIP - PEEP, including auto-PEEP) is adjusted to establish volume delivery on the basis of patient lung characteristics and effort. Initial pressure is set at the P<sub>plat</sub> value determined during VC-CMV and must be adjusted as needed to achieve V<sub>T</sub>. If P<sub>plat</sub> is not available, the peak pressure from VC-CMV minus 5 cm  $H_2O$  (PIP – 5 cm  $H_2O$ ) can be used as a starting point.

If volume readings are not available, an initial pressure of 10 to 15 cm H<sub>2</sub>O with simultaneous volume measurement and

### Case Study 6.5

### Inspiratory Flow Termination in Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV)

### **Problem 1**

During PSV, a patient's peak flow is 50 L/min. At what flow level will inspiration end if the ventilator has a 25% flow cycle criterion?

### **Problem 2**

A patient on PSV has an endotracheal tube cuff that is not inflated, preventing the ventilator from reaching the flow cycle criterion to end inspiration. What will terminate inspiration?

#### **Problem 3**

At the end of inspiration, a patient on PSV actively exhales before the ventilator detects the drop in flow required to cycle the breath. How will this affect the pressure/time waveform of the ventilator?

adjustment is appropriate. The pressure limit must be set because in some ventilators, pressure can be higher than the set pressure control level if the patient actively coughs. Low  $V_T$  and high f alarms are also necessary.

An important advantage of PC-CMV is that  $P_{alv}$  usually will not exceed the applied pressure. Setting a PIP of less than 30 cm  $H_2O$  can therefore help avoid alveolar overinflation. Because it is not possible to measure  $P_{alv}$  in all situations, PIP is maintained less than this set pressure. The patient's  $P_{alv}$  can be estimated by observing the flow curve. If the flow drops to zero before inspiration ends, the applied pressure is reaching the alveolar level by the end of inspiration (see Fig. 5.2). If inspiration ends before the flow reaches zero,  $P_{alv}$  is less than applied pressure but is not measurable. In this case,  $T_I$  may need to be adjusted (increased) depending on patient need and  $V_T$  delivery.

Normally PC-CMV provides a descending ramp waveform. As with PSV, current-generation ventilators (e.g., the CareFusion AVEA) are able to adjust the inspiratory rise time, which is the amount of the  $T_{\rm I}$  required for the ventilator to reach the set pressure at the beginning of inspiration. The practitioner can adjust the rise to meet patient needs as with PSV (Fig. 5.9). It is advisable to use graphic monitoring to help make adjustments in pressure,  $T_{\rm I}$ , and flow taper. If  $T_{\rm I}$  is too long and the patient starts to actively exhale, a slight rise will occur at the end of the breath on the pressure curve.

Compared with similar settings on VC-CMV, PC-CMV has been shown to improve oxygenation and gas exchange, increase  $P_{aw}$ , and facilitate lung healing. PC-CMV also reduces the PIP, amount of applied PEEP,  $V_E$ , respiratory work, need for sedation, and duration of mechanical ventilation. Pressure-targeted ventilation is safe and well tolerated as an initial mode of ventilation in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and may result in greater patient comfort.  $^{43,48}$ 

### Initial Settings for Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure Ventilation

Bilevel positive airway pressure (or BiPAP) can be used for intubated patients or nonintubated patients, although it is most often used as noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV). Initial settings include an inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) of about 5 to 10 cm  $\rm H_2O$ . The level of IPAP is increased in increments of 3 to 5 cm  $\rm H_2O$  until a rate of 25 breaths/min or lower is achieved and the  $\rm V_T$  is 4 to 8 mL/kg or more, depending on the patient's pathological processes. Expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) or PEEP is initiated at 2 to 5 cm  $\rm H_2O$  and increased in increments of 3 to 5 cm  $\rm H_2O$ . The initial  $\rm F_{IO_2}$  is set to ensure adequate oxygenation. It is important to recognize that initiating NIV may require a considerable amount of time to achieve patient compliance.

For patients with COPD experiencing air trapping (auto-PEEP), EPAP is typically set at 80% to 90% of the level of auto-PEEP, which is usually about 3 to 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. Observing the patient's use of accessory muscles (e.g., sternocleidomastoid muscles) during inspiration can assist in the titration of EPAP when auto-PEEP is present. For patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure, a PEEP/CPAP level greater than 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O is often required. (NOTE: The application of PEEP to help a patient trigger the ventilator is also used in other modes of ventilation besides NIV.) If no improvement is seen after about 2 hours of treatment, this mode of ventilation is probably not benefiting the patient and a more aggressive intervention may be necessary. Additional information on noninvasive ventilation can be found in Chapter 19.

# Initial Settings for Pressure Ventilation Modes With Volume Targeting

Pressure ventilation with volume targeting, which is also called adaptive pressure control (APC) ventilation, provides the benefits of pressure breaths along with targeting a set volume. The following is a brief description of the two modes in which volume is targeted for each breath: pressure-regulated volume control (PRVC) and volume control plus (VC+).

### Initial Settings of Pressure-Regulated Volume Control

PRVC is a mode of ventilation that provides closed-loop pressure breaths and targets the pressure to achieve the set volume. PRVC is a pressure-limited, time-cycled mode that uses the set  $V_T$  as a feedback control. PRVC was originally available only with the Servo 300 ventilator, but it has now been incorporated into a number of other ventilators. Table 6.4 lists various names used by ventilator manufacturers to describe PRVC on their respective devices.

With PRVC, the operator sets a  $V_T$  to be delivered that is appropriate for the patient. The baseline pressure and the maximum pressure limit are also set. The ventilator delivers one or more test breaths. For example, the Servo-i produces a test breath, which is a volume-targeted breath with an inspiratory pause. The test breaths allow the ventilator to calculate static compliance and  $R_{\rm aw}$  of the patient and system to determine the pressure required to achieve the set  $V_T$ . The first pressure level delivered in PRVC

### **TABLE 6.4**

### Names for Pressure-Regulated Volume Control (PRVC) and Volume Support on Different Ventilators

| PRVC Name         |  |
|-------------------|--|
| Adaptive pressure |  |
| ventilation       |  |
| PRVC              |  |
| Autoflow          |  |
| PRVC              |  |
| VC+               |  |
| VS Name           |  |

equals the plateau pressure measured during the test breath. The ventilator progressively adjusts the pressure level until the set  $V_T$  is achieved. The operator can evaluate volume and pressure graphics to ensure these parameters are set appropriately (see Fig. 5.10). (NOTE: The exact maximum level of pressure delivery may differ among ventilators, but the ventilator relies on the upper pressure limit to determine how high to go when increasing pressure delivery to deliver the set  $V_T$ .)

It is important to set the upper pressure limit for two reasons:

- 1. It provides the upper limit for the ventilator to use in adjusting the pressure breath. (Pressure will not exceed a fixed amount, usually 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O below the upper pressure limit.)
- 2. If the patient coughs or forcibly exhales during the inspiratory phase, the ventilator will not permit pressure to exceed the upper pressure limit.

Current-generation ventilators with floating exhalation valves can actually release pressure during a forceful cough. This helps maintain the inspiratory pressure without prematurely ending inspiration as a result of pressure cycling when circuit pressures reach the upper pressure limit.

The following example illustrates how the ventilator adjusts pressure during PRVC. Suppose that the tidal volume is set at 600 mL, the baseline pressure is +5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O of PEEP, and an upper pressure limit of 35 cm H<sub>2</sub>O is set. Imagine that the patient begins ventilation with the PRVC mode using a pressure of 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O to achieve the 600-mL volume target. Then suppose the patient suddenly develops a pneumothorax. This would reduce the patient's compliance, thus requiring a higher pressure to deliver the desired V<sub>T</sub> of 600 mL. (The ventilator reaches 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O but is unable to deliver the 600 mL.) Circuit pressure is now within 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O of the upper pressure limit, and the ventilator's alarm will activate. This will be an audible alarm and perhaps a digital message that might say, "Pressure limited, please evaluate." The clinician must evaluate the patient and determine whether ventilator changes are required (Case Study 6.6).

### **Initial Settings of Volume Support**

Volume support is a purely spontaneous mode (see Fig. 5.11). In addition to setting the ventilator sensitivity, the operator sets the  $V_{\rm T}$  and upper pressure limit. The selection of  $V_{\rm T}$  is based on the

### Case Study 6.6

### Pressure-Regulated Volume Control (PRVC)

A patient on PRVC has a set volume of 550 mL. The upper pressure limit is set to 30 cm  $H_2O$ . Initially, 19 cm  $H_2O$  is required to deliver the volume. The pressure is now at 13 cm  $H_2O$ . What should the therapist do in this situation?

same criteria used in VC-CMV. The advantage of VS is that spontaneously breathing patients can establish their own respiratory rate and  $V_T$ . (NOTE: In volume support, the set  $V_T$  is the minimum  $V_T$ . A patient can obtain a higher  $V_T$  if desired.) As lung characteristics improve, less pressure is required from the ventilator to deliver the volume, which automatically reduces pressure delivery. At the same time, if the patient becomes apneic, volume support modes provide a "safety net," usually as a backup mode that can provide a set rate and volume. Table 6.4 lists various names used by ventilator manufacturers to describe the volume support mode on their respective devices.

### SUMMARY

- The primary goal of VC-CMV is to achieve a  $\dot{V}_E$  that matches the patient's metabolic needs and ensures adequate gas exchange.
- Initiation of VC-CMV requires several considerations, including  $\dot{V}_E$  settings ( $V_T$  and f), inspiratory gas flow, flow waveform, I/E ratio, pressure limit, inflation hold (inspiratory pause), and inspiratory and expiratory pressure (PEEP).
- Settings for  $V_T$  and f should reflect a  $\tilde{V_E}$  that is derived from the initial calculation based on patient gender, BSA, and pathology.
- Regardless of the method used for selecting the  $V_T$  for a patient, it is important for clinicians to be aware of potential risks of causing lung injury, such as overdistention of lung tissue and atelectasis.
- The tubing compliance, or system compressibility, reflects the volume of gas compressed in the ventilator circuit during the inspiratory phase.
- A number of devices can decrease or increase the amount of V<sub>Dmech</sub> added to the breathing circuit.
- An understanding of the interrelation between inspiratory flow, inspiratory time (T<sub>I</sub>), expiratory time (T<sub>E</sub>), TCT, and I/E ratio is necessary for the clinician to provide effective ventilation to a patient.
- $\bullet$  During VC-CMV where patient-triggered breaths are present, the patient's respiratory rate may actually vary, depending on flow and  $T_{\rm I}$  setting.
- The most common flow patterns used during mechanical ventilation are constant and descending ramp patterns.
- Clinicians must be familiar with how the ventilator functions when selecting peak flow and waveform pattern.
- A constant flow pattern generally provides the shortest T<sub>I</sub> of all the available flow patterns with an equivalent peak flow rate setting. Descending flow pattern may improve the distribution

- of gas in the lungs, reduce dead space, and increase oxygenation by increasing mean and plateau airway pressures.
- PSV is used to support spontaneous breaths in a patient with an artificial airway when the IMV or spontaneous/CPAP modes are used.
- PRVC provides closed-loop pressure breaths and targets the pressure to achieve the set volume.
- In volume support, the set V<sub>T</sub> is the minimum V<sub>T</sub>. A patient can obtain a higher V<sub>T</sub> if desired.
