oninvasive ventilation (NIV) is defined as the delivery of mechanical ventilation to the lungs using techniques that do not require an endotracheal airway. Before 1960, nearly all patients requiring mechanical ventilation were treated with devices that relied on negative pressure ventilators (i.e., the use of a tank respirator or chest-wrap device) that were able to apply subatmospheric pressure to the body or chest area to ventilate the lungs.

Groundbreaking studies by researchers beginning in the 1950s found that the survival rate for invasive positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) delivered via an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube was higher than that for negative pressure ventilation. As a result, IPPV became the standard of practice for the support and management of patients with acute and chronic respiratory failure.

Invasive ventilation has been shown to be an effective and often necessary method to support alveolar ventilation; however, there are associated risks that often can result in increased mortality and morbidity and a higher financial cost. Advances in technology and results of numerous clinical trials during the past 25 years have demonstrated that NIV is a viable modality for the treatment of acute respiratory failure (ARF) in selected patients. Indeed, clinical application of NIV via a nasal mask, mouthpiece, or full-face mask has been shown to reduce the need for intubation and its related complications, reduce mortality rates, and shorten the hospital stay for selected groups of patients requiring mechanical ventilatory support.<sup>2-7</sup>

# TYPES OF NONINVASIVE VENTILATION TECHNIQUES

Three basic methods of applying NIV have been successfully used in the treatment of patients. These methods include negative pressure ventilation and positive pressure NIV, and

abdominal-displacement ventilation, which will be discussed in Chapter 21.

#### **Negative Pressure Ventilation**

Use of negative pressure ventilators peaked during a worldwide polio epidemic in the 1950s.<sup>8</sup> Negative pressure ventilators, or *body ventilators*, operated on the principle of increasing lung volumes by intermittently applying negative pressure to the entire body below the neck or just to the upper region of the chest. The negative pressure was transmitted across the chest wall, into the pleural space, and into the intraalveolar space. The resulting increase in transpulmonary pressure caused air to enter the lungs. Exhalation was passive and simply depended on the elastic recoil of the lung and chest wall.

The first successful negative pressure ventilator, commonly referred to as the **iron lung**, was designed in 1928 by engineer Phillip Drinker and Dr. Charles McKhann. It consisted of a large metal cylinder that enclosed the patient's entire body below the neck, leaving the head protruding through an airtight rubber neck seal. A simpler and less expensive version of this tank device, which was developed by J. H. Emerson in 1931, became the ventilator that was predominantly used to treat patients paralyzed by polio.

The bulk and lack of portability of the iron lung, along with the difficulty in providing routine nursing care for patients, led to the development of smaller, portable negative pressure devices. The chest cuirass, or *shell ventilator*, gained wide popularity during the 1950s. Two versions of this device were primarily used to apply negative pressure to the thorax and upper abdomen. In one version, the patient's chest was covered by a metal shell, which had an air-filled rubber edge that sealed the thorax. Subsequent models used a shell made of plastic, which allowed it to be easier to mold and fit to a patient's chest. Another variation of the chest cuirass used a wraparound piece of plastic over a shell that was powered by a vacuum cleaner motor (Fig. 19.1).

#### **Positive Pressure Ventilation**

The use of positive pressure ventilation can be traced as far back as 1780, when the first bag-mask apparatus was designed for resuscitative efforts. Positive pressure ventilation with a mask was first used clinically in the mid-1940s by Motley and colleagues to treat patients with ARF. **Intermittent positive pressure ventilation** (IPPV), which used a pressure-targeted ventilator (PTV) and a mask, was later used primarily to treat ARF complicated by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma.

Intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB), which used a mask or mouthpiece, became a means of simply delivering aerosolized medication periodically with positive pressure breaths. Clinical studies in the 1980s began to show that the benefits of IPPB were often overstated and could be accomplished using other simpler and more cost-effective therapies. As the routine use of IPPB diminished in clinical practice, nasal-mask continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) began to emerge as a highly effective therapy in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Researchers found that application of low levels of continuous airway pressure through a mask interface created a pneumatic splint that prevented airway collapse during sleep.

The use of NIV was soon reported to be successful in the treatment of chronic ventilatory insufficiency and muscle weakness in patients with various neuromuscular illnesses. <sup>13-15</sup> In 1989, Meduri and colleagues<sup>16</sup> successfully treated a small sample of patients with ARF using pressure support ventilation through a face mask.

These early successes stimulated the production of a variety of interfaces and small pressure- and volume-targeted ventilators that were lightweight, easy to operate, and ideal for home use. Over the past two decades, the use of NIV has significantly increased and it has been used to treat both acute and chronic respiratory failure in a variety of clinical settings.

# GOALS OF AND INDICATIONS FOR NONINVASIVE POSITIVE PRESSURE VENTILATION

The goals of **noninvasive positive pressure ventilation** (NIV) and the indications for its use are derived from clinical experiences and systematic research. The following sections review the evidence that supports the use of NIV in various disorders associated with acute and chronic respiratory failure.<sup>17</sup>

#### **Acute Care Setting**

NIV is considered by most clinicians to be a lifesaving application for ARF. It offers a number of benefits over IPPV (Box 19.1). The most significant benefit is the avoidance of intubation. Endotracheal intubation is associated with complications such as airway trauma, increased risk for aspiration, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and considerable patient discomfort, typically requiring the use of sedatives. Such complications can lead to a longer hospital stay, higher mortality rate, and increased health care costs. Evidence has established that NIV can safely support ventilation, without endotracheal intubation, until the condition leading to the ARF has been reversed. In addition, evidence strongly indicates that NIV reduces the mortality rate, reduces the duration of ventilator use, and shortens the hospital stay in appropriately selected patients. As such, the primary goal of NIV in the acute care setting is to avoid the need for endotracheal intubation and invasive ventilation.

#### BOX **19.1**

#### **Clinical Benefits of Noninvasive Ventilation**

#### **Acute Care Setting**

- · Reduces the need for endotracheal intubation
- · Reduces incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia
- · Shortens stay in the intensive care unit
- Shortens hospital stay
- Reduces mortality
- Preserves physiological airway defenses
- Improves patient comfort
- Reduces need for sedation

#### **Chronic Care Setting**

- · Alleviates symptoms of chronic hypoventilation
- Improves duration and quality of sleep
- · Improves functional capacity
- · Prolongs survival

The physiological goal of NIV in ARF is to improve gas exchange by resting the respiratory muscles and increasing alveolar ventilation. NIV reduces diaphragmatic pressure swings, which suggests that the respiratory muscles are being rested. In addition, when positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is applied during pressure support ventilation (PSV), PEEP helps offset auto-PEEP, thereby reducing the work required to initiate inspiration. Likewise, pressure support facilitates inspiration, thus increasing the tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>). Resting of the respiratory muscles and improved V<sub>T</sub> lead to a lower arterial partial pressure of  $CO_2$  ( $P_aCO_2$ ), better oxygenation, and decreased respiratory rates.

# Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

During an acute exacerbation of COPD (i.e., acute-on-chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure), increased airway resistance and an increased respiratory rate lead to hyperinflation, development of auto-PEEP (air trapping), and alveolar hypoventilation. As hyperinflation worsens, respiratory muscle activity increases, significantly increasing the O2 cost of breathing. This becomes a vicious circle of increased demand for ventilation, further air trapping, hypoventilation, and muscle fatigue. Without intervention, ventilatory failure and death may occur. Conventional medical therapy for these patients has included bronchodilators, anti-inflammatory agents, judicious use of supplemental O2, and antibiotics. If these measures failed, endotracheal intubation and invasive ventilation were the next therapeutic steps. Studies of patients with COPD who have experienced acute exacerbations have shown that NIV reduces inspiratory muscle activity and the respiratory rate and increases V<sub>T</sub> and minute volume, allowing for better gas exchange and respiratory muscle rest. NIV may help reverse the acute condition when used in conjunction with conventional medical therapy. 18

The use of NIV in the treatment of ARF caused by COPD exacerbation has been successful and has been studied more than any other disorder leading to ARF. The strongest evidence from randomized control trials (RCTs) has confirmed that use of NIV with a face mask significantly reduces the need for intubation, shortens the duration of mechanical ventilation, shortens the

patient's stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), and reduces complications and the mortality rate.<sup>2-7</sup>

Compared with patients receiving only conventional medical therapy (e.g., bronchodilators, anti-inflammatory agents, supplemental O2, antibiotics), patients receiving NIV have shown significant improvement in vital signs, pH and blood gas values, respiratory rate, and breathlessness within the first hour of application. These results have been compelling enough that NIV is considered a standard of care for the treatment of COPD exacerbation in selected patients.,19-21 Indeed, a recent European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society clinical practice guidelines for the use of NIV for ARF recommended bilevel NIV as a viable intervention to treat ARF leading to acute or acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis (i.e., pH <7.35) because of COPD exacerbation.<sup>21</sup> Additionally, these guidelines recommend that a trial of bilevel NIV should be considered in these COPD patients who require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation unless immediate deterioration is imminent<sup>21</sup> (Key Point 19.1).

**Key Point** 19.1 Clinical evidence supports the use of NIV as the standard of care for patients with moderate-to-severe exacerbations of COPD who meet selection criteria.

#### **Asthma**

The efficacy of NIV in the treatment of severe asthma is inconclusive at this time. The European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society guideline for the use of NIV for the treatment of acute respiratory failure did not provide specific criteria for the selection of asthma patients to receive NIV due to lack of evidence.<sup>21</sup> Several RCTs have shown that patients with status asthmaticus complicated by CO<sub>2</sub> retention demonstrate positive outcomes when treated with a trial of NIV. The benefits observed in one study included improved gas exchange, decreased PaCO2, and rapid improvement in vital signs within the first 2 hours of NIV treatment.<sup>22</sup> Results from another study found that NIV reduced the need for endotracheal intubation and the associated complications and resulted in fewer hospital admissions for the patients studied.<sup>23</sup> In another RCT involving subjects with severe airway obstruction and respiratory distress, subjects receiving NIV were compared with those who received conventional therapy with supplemental oxygen. The subjects receiving NIV tended to show a decreased requirement for inhaled bronchodilator compared with subjects receiving conventional medical therapy and supplemental oxygen.<sup>24</sup>

Given the need for additional studies to better define the efficacy of NIV in the treatment of patients experiencing severe asthma episodes, caution should be exercised when using NIV for patients who do not need immediate invasive mechanical ventilation or do not have substantial impairment of gas exchange. Patients with severe asthma should be carefully monitored because these patients can deteriorate rapidly and develop severe airway obstruction, which can be difficult to treat even with invasive mechanical ventilation.<sup>25</sup>

#### Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure

There is conflicting evidence of the efficacy of NIV in the treatment of hypoxemic respiratory failure, probably because of the wide variety of non-COPD parenchymal processes that can cause hypoxemic respiratory failure. Several examples include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, trauma, and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. These conditions usually result in severe impairment of gas exchange characterized by refractory hypoxemia, an arterial partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub> to fractional inspired O<sub>2</sub> concentration (PaO<sub>2</sub>/F<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) ratio less than 200, and a respiratory rate greater than 35 breaths/min. In several clinical studies, patients who received conventional medical care for hypoxemic ARF were compared with patients who received NIV plus the usual medical care.<sup>26</sup> In these studies, NIV significantly improved gas exchange, reduced the need for intubation, and reduced the mortality rate in these patients. NIV can be as effective at improving oxygenation within the first hour as invasive ventilation and is associated with fewer complications and a shorter ICU stay.<sup>27</sup> In contrast, other researchers have found no significant improvement in patients' overall condition with NIV unless the patients were also hypercapnic.<sup>28</sup> Although many studies have shown promising results with the use of NIV in hypoxemic respiratory failure, the different causes of hypoxemic respiratory failure make it difficult to apply all of these findings to individual patients.

#### **Community-Acquired Pneumonia**

Of the various causes of hypoxemic respiratory failure treated with NIV, pneumonia appears to be one of the most challenging and least consistent for successful outcomes. In a study of patients with COPD and ARF, 38% of the unsuccessful attempts with NIV were associated with the presence of pneumonia.<sup>29</sup> On the other hand, the intubation rate, ICU stay, and mortality rate were reduced when NIV was used to treat patients with severe communityacquired pneumonia (CAP). In the case of CAP, most of the favorable results were from the subgroup of COPD patients who had pneumonia. In a study by Jolliet and colleagues, 22 of the 24 non-COPD patients with severe CAP and ARF who received NIV showed initial improvement in oxygenation and a reduced respiratory rate. However, despite the improvement, nearly twothirds of the patients eventually required intubation and mechanical ventilation. 30 Those patients who continued to receive NIV had shorter ICU and hospital stays. Because of the mixed results produced in studies, the current suggestion is that patients with COPD and pneumonia receive an initial trial of NIV. However, caution should be used when non-COPD patients with pneumonia are treated with NIV.

#### Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema

Bilevel NIV and mask CPAP has been shown to be effective in the treatment of acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ACPE). <sup>16,21,31</sup> When patients with ACPE do not respond to conventional pharmacological and O<sub>2</sub> therapy, the use of NIV and mask CPAP with O<sub>2</sub> may expand fluid-filled alveoli, resulting in the following:

- Increased oxygenation
- Increased functional residual capacity (FRC)
- Improved lung compliance
- Reduced work of breathing (WOB)
- Reduced need for invasive ventilation

Several studies have reported similar success in treating ACPE with NIV by mask using PSV plus PEEP.<sup>32-34</sup> In these studies, rapid improvement in gas exchange and pH were noted, along with reduced intubation rates. Patients who were already hypercapnic responded best. A comparison of NIV and CPAP in the

treatment of ACPE showed that although patients treated with NIV demonstrated more rapid improvements in PaCO2 and pH, the mortality and intubation rates were not significantly different.<sup>35</sup> It is worth mentioning that although NIV and CPAP are equally effective in treating respiratory failure associated with ACPE, patients with ACPE are treated initially with CPAP. If the patient remains hypercapnic and dyspneic with CPAP, a trial of NIV may be indicated<sup>36</sup> (Key Point 19.2).

Key Point 19.2 Patients with ACPE are treated initially with CPAP. If the patient remains hypercapnic and dyspneic with CPAP, a trial of NIV is indicated

#### **Chronic Care Setting**

In chronic respiratory failure, NIV is considered to be a supportive therapy rather than a lifesaving treatment. Most of the clinical disorders that require this level of support are characterized by chronic hypoventilation, nocturnal desaturation, respiratory muscle fatigue, and poor sleep quality. As the disease process progresses, daytime gas exchange worsens and patients often show classic symptoms of chronic hypoventilation (Box 19.2).

Nocturnal use of NIV (4-6 hours) can have certain clinical benefits for patients with chronic hypoventilation disorders (see Box 19.1). The most significant of these are improvement of symptoms associated with chronic hypoventilation and an improved quality of life. Although the physiological mechanism underlying these benefits is not well understood, investigators have hypothesized that NIV benefits these patients in one or all of the following ways<sup>38-40</sup>:

- · It provides intermittent rest for the respiratory muscles, resulting in less muscle fatigue and more efficiency of function.
- It reduces the frequency and severity of sleep-disordered breathing, leading to longer sleep and better sleep quality.
- It eliminates nocturnal hypoventilation, making the respiratory centers more responsive to increases in CO2 and leading to improvement in daytime ventilation.
- It may eliminate auto-PEEP, which would reduce WOB required to trigger a breath during NIV.

#### **Restrictive Thoracic Disorders**

Restrictive thoracic disorders include chest wall deformities and neuromuscular conditions that result in progressive muscle weakness, hypoventilation, and eventually respiratory failure. Patients with neuromuscular disorders were the first group of patients studied to be successfully converted from invasive ventilation (tracheostomy) to NIV (mouthpiece interface).<sup>37</sup> These

#### BOX 19.2 Symptoms of Chronic Hypoventilation

- **Fatigue**
- Morning headache
- Daytime hypersomnolence
- Cognitive dysfunction
- Dyspnea

patients required continuous support; however, NIV can also benefit patients who require ventilatory support only at night or intermittently during the day. In the short-term use group, daytime gas exchange and respiratory muscle strength improve and symptoms of hypoventilation are alleviated.<sup>38-40</sup> Nocturnal use of NIV also eliminates OSA and O2 desaturation at night, which are common in patients who use negative pressure ventilatory support.41

Quality of life appears to improve for patients with neuromuscular disorders who use NIV. A high degree of satisfaction, along with improved mental well-being and psychosocial function, has been noted for patients with restrictive thoracic disorders.<sup>42</sup> Long-term follow-up of these patients has shown significantly shortened hospital stays and an overall increased survival time compared with patients who did not receive ventilatory support.<sup>43</sup> For these reasons, the consensus is that NIV is the ventilator mode of choice for chronic respiratory failure caused by restrictive thoracic disorders in patients who can protect their airway<sup>44,45</sup> (Key Point 19.3).

**Key Point** 19.3 NIV is the ventilator mode of choice for chronic respiratory failure caused by restrictive thoracic disorders in patients who can protect their airways.

#### **Chronic Stable Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease**

Evidence of the efficacy of long-term nocturnal NIV is limited and often contradictory in severe stable COPD. Early studies of patients with severe stable COPD focused on the use of intermittent negative pressure ventilation to rest the muscles of respiration.<sup>46,47</sup> Some investigators reported potential benefits, but most patients could not tolerate the devices used, and the benefits were only temporary. In addition, negative pressure ventilation actually collapsed upper airway structures during sleep and induced OSA.

A number of studies have since been performed on patients with severe stable COPD who used nocturnal NIV. Results from these studies included reduced daytime PaCO2, reduced nocturnal O<sub>2</sub> desaturation and hypoventilation, improved sleep quality, and improved quality of life. Other studies have found minimal or no benefit with nocturnal NIV in these patients.<sup>51,52</sup> The discrepancy in these findings could be the result of differing patient selection, methods, or ventilator settings. Closer examination of baseline characteristics of the study participants reveals an important finding: the greatest benefits from NIV were seen in individuals who had more severe CO2 retention and more episodes of nocturnal desaturation.

A recent clinical practice guideline published by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) suggested on the basis of evidence to date that patients diagnosed with chronic stable COPD with hypercapnia may benefit and should be considered for nocturnal NIV.<sup>50</sup> The guideline also suggested that barriers to implementation will require attention from physicians, as well as payors and other stakeholders.

#### **Cystic Fibrosis**

The role of NIV in the treatment of advanced cystic fibrosis has not been precisely defined. In general, NIV increases V<sub>T</sub>, reduces diaphragmatic activity, and improves oxygenation in some patients with cystic fibrosis who have acute exacerbations.<sup>53</sup> Intermittent use of NIV could help support these patients for several months while they await lung transplantation.<sup>54-56</sup>

#### **Nocturnal Hypoventilation**

Several other disorders associated with **nocturnal hypoventilation** include central sleep apnea, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and OSA combined with COPD or congestive heart failure. These disorders may also lead to daytime CO<sub>2</sub> retention. If nocturnal hypoventilation is severe, symptoms will be severe and will manifest during the daytime (see Box 19.2). Without intervention, these symptoms can then progress to overt respiratory failure.

The therapy of choice for OSA is CPAP. However, if these patients continue to hypoventilate despite CPAP therapy, NIV may improve daytime gas exchange and symptoms associated with chronic hypoventilation.<sup>57</sup> Likewise, patients with central hypoventilation or obesity hypoventilation syndrome who do not respond to first-line therapies (e.g., O<sub>2</sub>, respiratory stimulants, weight loss, supplemental O<sub>2</sub>, CPAP) should be considered for treatment with NIV (Key Point 19.4).

**Key Point** 19.4 Patients with OSA are typically treated initially with CPAP therapy. NIV is indicated if these patients continue to experience hypoventilation and nocturnal desaturation.

# OTHER INDICATIONS FOR NONINVASIVE VENTILATION

# Facilitation of Weaning From Invasive Ventilation

Reducing the number of days that a patient receives invasive mechanical ventilation reduces the risk for infection and other complications, lowers the mortality rate, and reduces health care costs. Many respiratory care departments in acute care facilities have devised weaning protocols for discontinuing ventilation and extubating patients as soon as possible. However, many weaning protocols depend on patient tolerance of daily spontaneous breathing trials to determine the likelihood of successful extubation. (See Chapter 20 for information on weaning and spontaneous breathing trials.) After extubation, the excessive WOB that spontaneous breathing places on the respiratory muscles can lead to fatigue and ultimately reintubation.

NIV provides a viable weaning alternative for patients who demonstrate respiratory muscle fatigue post extubation. It has been suggested that NIV reduces the WOB and maintains adequate gas exchange as effectively as invasive ventilation.<sup>61</sup> NIV can also shorten the duration of invasive ventilation.<sup>62,63</sup> In one study of a group of patients for whom 3 days of spontaneous breathing trials failed, NIV was shown to reduce the spontaneous WOB, maintain adequate gas exchange, and reduce ICU and hospital stays.<sup>64</sup> NIV has also been shown to reduce the likelihood that patients will need a tracheotomy.<sup>62</sup> Most patients who appear to benefit from NIV during weaning from invasive ventilation suffer from chronic illness (e.g., COPD). Therefore, it is questionable whether the benefits of NIV would apply to patients with other disease processes. Nonetheless, the evidence is strong enough to warrant consideration of NIV in patients for whom spontaneous breathing trials fail and who meet appropriate NIV selection criteria.

#### "Do Not Intubate" Patients

Patients with terminal or advanced disease who develop ARF are not viewed as good candidates for endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. NIV may be a viable alternative therapy for these patients, although its use with this group of patients remains controversial. Previous studies involving primarily end-stage COPD patients in whom endotracheal intubation was contraindicated found that most of these patients were successfully supported with NIV and eventually weaned from ventilatory support. Many of these patients would not have survived the acute process had they not been placed on NIV. Patients with acute pulmonary edema may also benefit from support with NIV. However, survival was not improved in patients with ARF arising from other causes such as pneumonia or cancer.

The argument for using NIV in patients who have "do not intubate" status is that NIV may relieve severe dyspnea, reduce sedation requirement, and preserve patient comfort. It may also reverse the acute process in disorders such as COPD or pulmonary edema and allow these patients to live longer.<sup>68</sup> The argument against using NIV in these patients is that it can prolong the dying process, add to patient discomfort, and consume valuable resources.<sup>69</sup> When NIV is used in these cases, the patient and family members should be informed that NIV is a form of life support that can be uncomfortable but that may be removed at any time.<sup>19</sup>

#### **PATIENT SELECTION CRITERIA**

Success of NIV and avoidance of major complications depend on appropriate selection of patients in both acute and chronic care settings. Evidence gained from the use of NIV in various patient populations and clinical settings has led to the development of guidelines that promote the highest chance of success (Table 19.1).

- 4. Excessive secretions
- 5. Agitated and confused patients
- Facial deformities or conditions that prevent mask from fitting

#### **Acute Care Setting**

In the acute care setting, the selection process must be based on the patient's diagnosis, clinical characteristics, and risk for failure. The assessment process may be viewed as a two-step process. The first step involves establishing the need for ventilatory assistance according to clinical and blood gas criteria. The consensus of studies is that patients who need ventilatory assistance show signs and symptoms of distress, including tachypnea (respiratory rate greater than 24 breaths/min), use of accessory muscles, and paradoxical breathing. Blood gas criteria should reveal a moderate to severe respiratory failure (i.e., a pH <7.35 and  $P_aCO_2 > 45$  mm Hg  $\sigma$ r a  $P_aO_2/F_1O_2 < 200$ ). It is also important to know when NIV is not appropriate. For example, NIV may be unnecessary for patients with mild respiratory distress. NIV may also not be appropriate for a patient who has already deteriorated to severe respiratory failure because it may delay lifesaving intubation and ventilation.

Once the need for ventilatory support is established, the second step is to exclude patients at increased risk for failure and complications (Box 19.3). Such patients include individuals with respiratory arrest, hemodynamic instability, or other major organ involvement; patients with excessive secretions; and patients unable to protect their airway because of impaired cough or swallowing ability. Patients with any of these disorders are at highest risk for aspiration. Finally, agitated and confused patients or those with facial burns or deformities that preclude a good mask fit are excluded.

A final consideration in the selection of patients with ARF is the potential reversibility of the disease process. It has been clearly established that NIV is effective in the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD. Supportive ventilatory assistance allows time for conventional therapies (e.g., bronchodilators, O<sub>2</sub>, antibiotics) to reverse the acute process so that intubation may be avoided. Other causes of ARF may not be treated as successfully as COPD, but a trial of NIV may be warranted if the patient meets the selection criteria. All patients should be monitored closely so that intubation, if necessary, is not unduly delayed (Key Point 19.5).

**Key Point** 19.5 The reversibility of the disease process must be considered before NIV is initiated.

#### **Chronic Care Setting**

Establishing the need for intermittent ventilatory assistance in patients with chronic respiratory failure begins with the

recognition of typical symptoms of nocturnal hypoventilation and poor sleep quality. These most commonly include the following:

- Excessive fatigue
- Morning headache
- Daytime hypersomnolence
- Cognitive dysfunction
- Dyspnea

Objective criteria, such as blood gases, depend on the rate of progression of the disease process. For patients with restrictive thoracic or central hypoventilation disorders, institution of NIV is recommended when PaCO2 is 45 mm Hg or higher or when sustained nocturnal desaturation occurs, as evidenced by an O saturation by pulse oximeter (S<sub>D</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) under 88% for longer than 5 consecutive minutes.<sup>44</sup> NIV may also be indicated if a patient with restrictive thoracic disease is symptomatic and has severe pulmonary dysfunction (vital capacity [VC] <50% of the predicted level), even if CO<sub>2</sub> retention is absent.<sup>44</sup> Patients with nocturnal hypoventilation or OSA may require only nocturnal CPAP for splinting the airway open to overcome hypoventilation. However, NIV should be initiated if patients with moderate to severe OSA do not respond to CPAP therapy. Patients who recover from episodes of ARF or who are hospitalized repeatedly for exacerbations of their condition should also be considered for noninvasive ventilatory assistance (Key Point 19.6).

**Key Point** 19.6 NIV should be considered for patients with severe stable COPD who are symptomatic despite optimal treatment. NIV should also be considered for COPD patients who demonstrate evidence of OSA and are unresponsive to CPAP therapy.

The conflicting findings of studies regarding the use of NIV for severe stable COPD have limited the development of evidencebased selection guidelines. Studies have demonstrated that COPD patients with severe hypercapnia are likely to benefit from NIV. A consensus of medical experts recommended the use of nocturnal NIV in symptomatic yet medically stable patients with COPD whose daytime P<sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> is 55 mm Hg or higher.<sup>44</sup> The term medically stable in this instance means that the patient is being optimally treated, and OSA and CPAP therapy have been considered and ruled out.<sup>44</sup> The consensus statement also recommended a trial of NIV for COPD patients receiving long-term O<sub>2</sub> administration (2 L/min or more) if the P<sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> is 50 to 54 mm Hg and the patient demonstrates evidence of frequent hypopnea episodes and sustained nocturnal desaturation. A history of frequent hospitalizations for acute exacerbations also helps justify the use of NIV in COPD patients.

As for any patient requiring NIV, the ability to protect the airway is crucial. This is especially important for patients with chronic respiratory failure because most of these individuals live at home or in an extended care setting and may not be monitored closely. Patients with neuromuscular disorders may present an even greater challenge as their disease progresses and they begin to lose oropharyngeal muscle strength and the ability to generate an effective cough. Cough-assisting devices or airway clearance techniques may help these individuals remove secretions and maintain a patent airway.

Patient motivation must also be considered with NIV in the chronic care setting. Few, if any, therapeutic results are realized if the patient does not comply with the prescribed therapy.<sup>71</sup> This

latter point emphasizes the importance of selecting patients who are symptomatic and motivated by the desire for relief of those symptoms. Table 19.2 summarizes the symptoms and selection criteria for chronic respiratory failure disorders.

# **EQUIPMENT SELECTION FOR NONINVASIVE VENTILATION**

The equipment required for NIV generally includes ventilators, humidifiers, and interfaces or masks.

#### **Types of Ventilators**

Successful application of NIV has been achieved using portable homecare ventilators, adult acute care ventilators, and portable pressure support (pressure-targeted) ventilators. The choice of ventilator should be based on the level of support required and the advantages and disadvantages of the appropriate machines.<sup>72</sup>

#### **Pressure-Targeted Ventilators**

Portable pressure-targeted ventilators (PTVs) are also known as bilevel CPAP ventilators, pressure support ventilators, or bilevel pressure ventilators. These ventilators are microprocessor-controlled, electrically powered units that use a blower to regulate gas flow into the patient circuit to maintain the preset pressure levels at the patient connection. PTVs have a single-circuit gas delivery system that uses an intentional leak port for patient exhalation instead of a true exhalation valve; this allows the continuous flow of gas through the small leak port to help maintain pressure levels and flush exhaled gases from the circuit.

PTVs are pressure-limited, flow- and time-triggered, flow- and time-cycled ventilators. These devices are designed to increase minute ventilation and improve gas-exchange capabilities using

the delivery of an **inspiratory positive airway pressure** (IPAP) and an **expiratory positive airway pressure** (EPAP). The calibrated pressure range for IPAP typically is 2 to 30 cm  $H_2O$ ; the range for EPAP typically is 2 to 20 cm  $H_2O$ .<sup>72</sup>

Manufacturers of PTVs use variable mode nomenclature, which is often confusing, but most of these units offer the following modes of ventilatory support:

- CPAP (spontaneous)
- PSV (IPAP/EPAP)
- Spontaneous/timed (S/T)

In the CPAP mode the patient breathes spontaneously at a set baseline pressure. The patient controls both the rate and depth of breathing. Flow sensors and pressure transducers respond to the patient's inspiratory and expiratory effort and increase or decrease flow through the circuit to maintain a stable level of pressure.

With the PSV (bilevel) mode, the difference between two pressure levels (IPAP and EPAP) determines the level of pressure support for each assisted breath. A change to the set IPAP occurs only in response to the patient's inspiratory effort. When the patient reaches a predetermined flow threshold, the breath is terminated and the patient exhales to the set EPAP level. There is no set rate; the patient must initiate each breath.

In the S/T mode (older models may use the term A/C), the clinician sets the IPAP and EPAP, a respiratory rate, and an inspiratory time (e.g., IPAP%). The patient may initiate breaths that are supported to the IPAP level, as in the PSV mode, but if the patient fails to make an inspiratory effort within a set interval, the machine triggers inspiration to the set IPAP level. IPAP then cycles to EPAP based on the IPAP% period. In all modes, the patient's delivered  $V_T$  depends on the gradient between the IPAP level and the EPAP, the inspiratory time, patient inspiratory effort, and the patient's lung characteristics (airway resistance and lung compliance) (Key Point 19.7).

**Key Point** 19.7 In all modes of bilevel positive pressure ventilation, the patient's delivered  $V_T$  depends on the gradient between the IPAP and EPAP, the inspiratory time, and the patient's inspiratory effort and lung characteristics.

Average volume-assured pressure support (AVAPS) is a relatively new technology available on the Philips Respironics Healthcare V60 ventilator (Eindhoven, The Netherlands) (Fig. 19.2). AVAPS devices automatically adapt pressure support to match a patient's ventilatory needs by delivering an average  $\rm V_T$  (V $_T$  range = 200–1500 mL) based on the patient's condition. AVAPS may be useful in the treatment of patients with COPD, neuromuscular diseases, obesity hypoventilation, and chronic hypoventilation.

AVAPS devices operate with several modes of ventilation, including CPAP, S/T, spontaneous, timed, and PCV. The Respironics V60 ventilator continually calculates and compensates for the total leak rate (i.e., intentional and unintentional patient leak). The clinician enters the known intentional leak value specific to the mask—patient interface and the circuit's exhalation port so that the ventilator can accurately calculate and display the patient leak using an Auto-Trak sensitivity system. The Auto-Trak—option allows the clinician to further adjust thresholds that manage trigger and cycling and the level of Auto-Trak sensitivity. The manufacturer's suggested setting for initiating AVAPS include a target  $V_T$  of 8 mL/kg, ideal body weight (IBW), maximum IPAP of 25 cm  $H_2O$  (depending on the patient's pathology), minimum EPAP of +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4 cm +4

A PTV's ability to deliver flow in response to patient demand is equivalent and often superior to that of ICU adult ventilators and portable homecare ventilators. Flow sensors in the PTV system

continuously monitor and adjust flow (variable up to 180 L/min) based on the set pressure, the patient's inspiratory and expiratory efforts, and the difference between the intentional leak in the leak port and unintentional leaks that might occur around the patient-ventilator interface. The PTV's ability to compensate for leaks makes it easier for the patient to flow-trigger the unit into inspiration and to reach the inspiratory flow threshold necessary to terminate each pressure-supported breath.

Most units now have adjustable inspiratory and expiratory sensitivity controls that improve synchronization between the patient and ventilator. PTVs also allow adjustment of the amount of time required to reach the IPAP (i.e., rise-time control). Use of the rise-time control may enhance patient comfort, reduce WOB, and improve patient—ventilator synchrony. Two other features of portable PTVs that can enhance patient comfort are the ramp and delay-time controls. Ramp allows positive pressure to increase gradually over a set interval (delay time). The ramp rate generally can be set in increments of, or 3 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, and the delay time can be set in 5-minute increments between 5 and 30 minutes. The ramp and delay-time controls are more likely to be used in homecare or chronic care NIV.

Portable PTVs have certain limitations that may restrict their use in ARF. For example,  $O_2$  delivery is not standard on most portable PTVs. When supplemental  $O_2$  is required, it must be bled into the system via the mask or into the circuit near the machine outlet. Therefore, the  $F_1O_2$  can vary and is affected by four factors:

- 1. O<sub>2</sub> flow rate
- 2. Type of leak port in the system
- 3. Site where O<sub>2</sub> is bled into the circuit
- 4. IPAP and EPAP

Higher  $O_2$  flow rates result in higher  $O_2$  concentrations. Lower IPAP and EPAP levels also yield higher  $O_2$  concentrations.  $^{73,74}$  In addition,  $F_1O_2$  is affected by the type of leak port and the site where  $O_2$  is added to the circuit. If the leak port is located in the circuit, higher  $F_1O_2$  values are obtained if the  $O_2$  is bled into the patient's mask. If the leak port is located in the mask, higher  $F_1O_2$  values are obtained if the  $O_2$  is bled into the circuit at the machine outlet. The lowest levels of  $O_2$  are obtained when the leak port is in the mask and  $O_2$  is bled into the mask.) Because the  $O_2$  concentration delivered is the result of a complex interaction between these variables, a ventilator with an  $O_2$  blender should be used for patients who require a high or precise  $F_1O_2$ .

Rebreathing of  $CO_2$  is a concern with any PTV that uses a single-circuit gas delivery system because exhalation occurs through the intentional leak port and depends on the continuous flow of gas in the circuit. If gas flow is inadequate, exhaled gases may not be adequately flushed from the system, resulting in the patient rebreathing exhaled  $CO_2$ . The flow of gas through the leak port depends on the EPAP setting and the patient's inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio. At low EPAP settings ( $<4~\rm cm~H_2O$ ) and with fast respiratory rates, flow may not be adequate to flush  $CO_2$  from the circuit. Studies have shown that use of an EPAP of  $4~\rm cm~H_2O$  or higher improves continuous flow of gas through the system and minimizes  $CO_2$  rebreathing. To some have considered adding an isolation-type exhalation valve to the circuit to eliminate  $CO_2$  rebreathing, but these valves tend to increase expiratory airway resistance significantly and increase WOB.

Pressure support ventilators initially were designed for use in the home or in noncritical areas of patient care. Their simple design and ease of operation make them ideal for home or subacute care. However, most of these units have few monitoring **Key Point 19.8** To prevent  $CO_2$  rebreathing, the EPAP level should be set at 4 cm  $H_2O$  or higher so that adequate gas flows can flush  $CO_2$  from the breathing circuit.

capabilities or alarms. With the increased use of NIV to treat ARF and to avoid intubation, PTVs have been developed with alarms that can detect large leaks, patient disconnection, and mechanical failure. Monitoring capabilities have improved such that the respiratory rate and  $V_T$  are measured and displayed. Pressure support ventilators, such as the BiPAP Vision (Phillips Respironics), provide graphic waveforms, which allow the practitioner to monitor for patient—ventilator asynchrony and make necessary adjustments (Key Point 19.8).

#### **Portable Homecare Ventilators**

Portable homecare ventilators were originally designed for invasive ventilation in the home or extended care facility for patients who required long-term assisted ventilation. The advantages of these electrically powered, microprocessor-controlled ventilators included compact size and the use of three power sources: A/C current, internal D/C battery, and external D/C battery. They were capable of providing patient- or time-triggered, pressure-limited, and volume- or pressure-cycled ventilation. Unlike adult critical care ventilators, early portable ventilators had no graphic displays and basic audible and visual alarms, which included low battery, power loss, low pressure, high pressure, power switchover, apnea, and microprocessor malfunction. PEEP could be obtained by attaching an external threshold resistor to the patient circuit exhalation valve. These units were not equipped with internal blenders, and therefore precise O2 concentrations are not possible. As with portable PTVs, O2 had be bled into the system through an adaptor from a separate O2 source. Older portable volume ventilators, if used for NIV, are more likely to be used in patients with chronic respiratory failure resulting from neuromuscular disorders. These patients require higher ventilating pressures that cannot be obtained with portable PTVs.

With the increased use of NIV, portable homecare ventilators have undergone a radical change in design and function. They now include different modes, alarms, and graphic capabilities similar to those of acute care ventilators and portable PTVs. Early portable ventilators were strictly volume ventilators; newer ventilators (e.g., LTV2 Ventilator [Vyaire Medical, Irvine, Calif.] [Fig. 19.3]) now have both volume- and pressure-targeted modes of ventilation, flow triggering, and PEEP capabilities (see Fig. 19.3). <sup>69</sup> These ventilators are more responsive to patient flow needs and can be used for either invasive ventilation or NIV. Thus, they are ideal for achieving a seamless transition from the extended care facility to the home.

#### **Adult Acute Care Ventilators**

Ventilators used in adult critical care units offer additional ventilatory support options and alarms, a precise  $F_1O_2$ , and more monitoring features than portable PTVs. These extra features may be advantageous for patients in ARF who require close monitoring and supervision during NIV. Although the pressure support mode is most commonly used to administer NIV, volume- or pressure-controlled modes combined with PEEP can also be administered via mask interface.

The most significant disadvantage of using acute care ventilators is the inability of some machines to compensate for leaks. Leaks at the patient interface interfere with triggering and cycling functions of the ventilator and result in patient—ventilator asynchrony and increased WOB. In the pressure support ventilation mode, air leaks cause gas flow to increase during delivery of the breath, making the cycle threshold difficult to achieve. This may prolong the inspiratory phase or cause the patient to exhale actively against the flow in an effort to terminate the breath. Most ICU ventilators have a flow-cycled mechanism that can be adjusted to terminate the breath sooner if air leaks increase the inspiratory time. The increased flow in the circuit may also cause some ventilators to autotrigger into inspiration or impair the patient's ability to flow-trigger the machine into inspiration (trigger asynchrony), resulting in increased muscle activity on inspiration.

When significant leaks are present around the interface, the patient may be more comfortable in a pressure-targeted, time-cycled mode, such as pressure-controlled continuous mandatory ventilation. In this mode, a rate and inspiratory time can be set according to the patient's rate and inspiratory time during spontaneous breathing. Cycling to exhalation then is a function of time rather than flow, which may improve synchronization with the ventilator and reduce patient respiratory effort.<sup>78</sup>

Although studies have demonstrated no significant differences in gas exchange between volume- and pressure-targeted modes,  $^{78,79}$  volume control modes are seldom used to deliver NIV in the acute care setting. This is most likely because of the leakage around the interface, which may cause a loss of volume delivery to the patient, resulting in hypoventilation.  $V_{\rm T}$  can be increased to compensate for leaks, but ventilating pressures often increase as well. Volume control modes are more likely to be used in the chronic care setting for patients with neuromuscular disorders who have been taught to "stack" breaths to achieve larger  $V_{\rm T}$  to enhance coughing and secretion clearance.  $^{80}$ 

Because of the increased use of NIV in the acute care setting, many ventilator manufacturers have incorporated specific noninvasive modes of ventilation into their acute care ventilators. These noninvasive modes allow for leak compensation in a manner similar to that of portable PTVs. Difficulties with triggering and cycling have improved, but considerable variation in the efficiency of this leak compensation exists between acute care ventilators. <sup>81,82</sup> As the amount of leakage increases, many of these ventilators require adjustments of trigger sensitivity and cycling function to maintain patient—ventilator synchrony.

#### **Humidification During Noninvasive Ventilation**

Excessive drying of nasal mucosa from the administration of nasal CPAP or NIV has been associated with nasal congestion and increased nasal resistance, which can cause patient discomfort and noncompliance. Use of a heated humidifier during administration of nasal CPAP can significantly reduce drying of the nasal mucosa and lead to improved patient comfort and compliance during NIV. Passover-type heated humidifiers are often used because heated bubble humidifiers and heat-moisture exchangers can increase airway resistance in the ventilator circuit and interfere with patient triggering (Key Point 19.9). <sup>86</sup>

**Key Point** 19.9 Passover heated humidifiers should be used to treat or prevent nasal congestion and improve patient comfort. Bubble humidifiers and heat-moisture exchangers increase airway resistance and will increase inspiratory WOB.

#### **Patient Interfaces**

The effectiveness of NIV is greatly influenced by the interface chosen to deliver positive pressure to the airway. A variety of interfaces are available, including nasal masks, oronasal masks, total face masks, helmets, nasal pillows, and mouthpieces with lip seals. All interfaces have advantages and disadvantages (Table 19.3). Therefore, the clinician must choose one that optimizes patient comfort and compliance with NIV.

#### **Nasal Interfaces**

Nasal masks are widely used for both CPAP and NIV (Fig. 19.4). Although nasal masks are available in many sizes and shapes from a number of manufacturers, the basic design is a small translucent, triangular device with a plastic shell and a cushion of soft, supple material that helps provide a seal around the patient's nose. The mask is secured to the patient's head and face by a harness composed of hook-and-loop fastening straps or a soft polyester head cap.

A nasal mask may offer several advantages over a full-face mask. It is much easier to fit and secure to the patient's face, and it may be more tolerable than a face mask to patients who feel claustrophobic. Because the nasal mask covers only the patient's nose, it allows the patient to cough and clear secretions, speak, and possibly eat. Nasal masks have considerably less mechanical dead space than full-face masks and therefore reduce the potential for rebreathing CO<sub>2</sub>.

The two most common disadvantages of the nasal mask are air leaks and skin irritation. Leaks occur to some degree in all patients receiving NIV with any mask. Nasal masks are more prone to leakage, especially in patients who are primarily mouth-breathers. For these patients, a chin-strap may help hold the mouth closed

during administration of NIV. Air leaks around the nasal mask often result in eye irritation. The strap tension required to maintain a snug fit between the nasal mask and the face often creates intolerable skin pressure, especially over the bridge of the nose. If the headgear straps are too tight, leakage may worsen, as does the pressure exerted over the nose. This can lead to redness and irritation of the skin and the potential for ulceration. Clinicians must ensure the tension on the headgear straps is not excessive. The clinician should be able to slip at least one finger between the straps and the patient's face.

Leaks and discomfort commonly occur because the mask is too large for the patient. Most manufacturers now provide mask-specific sizing gauges to aid sizing (Fig. 19.5). For nasal masks, the smallest mask that comes closest to the following contact points should be used:

• The point just above the junction of the nasal bone and cartilage (nasal bridge)

![](_page_11_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Fig. 19.5** A fitting gauge is used to ensure correct fitting of nasal mask. (Courtesy Philips Respironics, Eindhoven, The Netherlands.)

- The skin on the sides of both nares
- The area just below the lowest point of the nose, above the upper lip

Several manufacturers have modified the standard nasal mask to minimize leakage and to enhance patient comfort for chronic use of NIV. One such modification is a mask with gel-filled cushions that seal better and with less pressure exerted over the nose (Fig. 19.6). Other modifications include the use of forehead spacers or an extra-thin plastic flap around the cushion of the mask to permit better sealing of the mask with less pressure and discomfort.

A recently introduced minimask incorporates a small light-weight cushion that sits on the tip of the nose, eliminating both the pressure over the bridge of the nose and air leakage into the eyes (Fig. 19.7). For patients who cannot tolerate any of the commercially available masks, a custom-molded mask may be contoured to the patient's face enhancing comfort and reducing air leaks.

Patients who cannot tolerate nasal masks may use nasal pillows or nasal-sealing cushions. These consist of soft rubber or silicone pledgets that fit directly into the patient's nares (or seal the opening) and are held in place by a plastic shell attached to adjustable headgear (Fig. 19.8).

#### Full (Oronasal) and Total Face Mask and Helmet

The oronasal mask, or full-face mask, covers the nose and the mouth and may be used in NIV for patients who cannot tolerate nasal masks because of large air leaks through the patient's mouth (Fig. 19.9). This mask has become popular for the treatment of patients with ARF because acutely dyspneic patients tend to breathe more through the mouth as dyspnea increases.

Several concerns arise with the use of the full-face mask. Two important concerns are the potential for aspiration if vomiting occurs and the risk for asphyxia if the ventilator malfunctions. Commercially available masks are now equipped with quick-release mechanisms for simple removal and entrainment valves

that open to allow breathing of room air if the ventilator malfunctions. A typical adult full-face mask has an average dead space volume of 250 mL. The presence of dead space raises the concern of possible  $\rm CO_2$  rebreathing. In addition, the full-face mask does not allow the patient to eat or communicate well or to cough and

expectorate secretions without removing the mask. Patients may also have a greater tendency to feel claustrophobic with this type of mask. As with the nasal mask, proper size and fit help ensure patient safety, comfort, and compliance with the therapy. Using a sizing gauge for oronasal masks, the clinician should choose the smallest-size mask that comes closest to the following contact points:

- The area just outside the sides of the mouth
- The area just below the lower lip
- The bridge of the nose (Fig. 19.10)

**Fig. 19.10** Sizing gauge used to determine proper size of full-face mask. (Courtesy Philips Respironics, Eindhoven, The Netherlands.)

Other alternatives for patients who cannot tolerate nasal or oronasal masks may be the total face mask or helmet. The total face mask consists of a clear, lightweight, plastic faceplate surrounded by a soft inflatable cushion that seals the perimeter of the face and does not obstruct vision (Fig. 19.11). When the mask is connected to a ventilating system, air circulates throughout the entire mask, providing for more comfortable breathing. The incidence of pressure sores is lower because the mask seals the entire face.

The concerns discussed for the full-face mask (aspiration, asphyxiation, and rebreathing) also apply to the total face mask. Like the full-face mask, the total face mask is equipped with a quick-release feature and entrainment valve for room air breathing in case of ventilator malfunction.

The helmet is a transparent cylinder of polyvinyl chloride that fits over the patient's entire head. A metallic ring enclosed within a soft silicone collar seats the cylinder at the patient's neck and shoulders and is further secured by straps under each armpit

(Fig. 19.12). Two hoses attach to the cylinder to allow for gas entering and leaving the hood. Although this device is not currently approved for use in the United States, it has been used successfully in other countries for the treatment of ARF.

The helmet has several advantages compared with the full-face mask: less resistance to gas flow, less need for patient cooperation, less interference with speech or coughing, and less skin breakdown. The primary concern with the use of the helmet is potential for  $\text{CO}_2$

rebreathing as a result of the large volume of the cylinder.<sup>89,91</sup> Studies comparing the use of the helmet with the full-face mask have also shown that the helmet is less efficient in decreasing the inspiratory WOB and increases patient—ventilator asynchrony.<sup>91,92</sup>

#### **Oral Interfaces**

Mouthpieces and lip seals have been used to provide NIV for many years in patients with chronic respiratory failure (Fig. 19.13). Mouthpieces provide an effective means of ventilation for patients with neuromuscular disorders and may provide an alternative for patients who cannot control mouth leakage during nasal ventilation. Mouthpieces have the advantages of facilitating communication, secretion clearance, and oral intake, and they minimize the problem of  $\mathrm{CO}_2$  rebreathing.

Mouthpieces do not usually require the use of headgear or straps. They can often be held in place with the hands or held in the mouth with an orthodontic appliance, especially during day-time hours. Patients with neuromuscular disorders who are confined to a wheelchair often secure their mouthpiece to a gooseneck clamp attached to the chair. It is important to recognize that nasal air leakage is a concern when using mouthpieces and may compromise NIV efficacy. Nose clips may help alleviate this problem. If the mouthpiece is used nocturnally, lip seals can be added over the mouthpiece to prevent leakage during sleep. Also, custom-fitted mouthpieces can prevent leakage and add to the comfort and efficacy of NIV.

# SETUP AND PREPARATION FOR NONINVASIVE VENTILATION

After selecting the ventilator and interface or interfaces, the respiratory therapist is responsible for initiating NIV (Box 19.4). Effective ventilation absolutely requires patient cooperation and tolerance; therefore the respiratory therapist must gain the patient's trust and

#### BOX **19.4**

#### **Steps for Initiating Noninvasive Ventilation**

- Place patient in an upright or sitting position. Carefully explain the NIV procedure, including goals and possible complications.
- Using a sizing gauge, make sure a mask that is the proper size and fit is chosen.
- Attach the interface and circuit to ventilator. Turn on the ventilator and adjust it initially to low-pressure settings.
- 4. Hold or allow the patient to hold the mask gently to the face until the patient becomes comfortable with it. Encourage the patient in proper breathing technique.
- 5. Monitor oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) saturation; adjust the fractional inspired O<sub>2</sub> (F<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) to maintain O<sub>2</sub> saturation above 90%.
- 6. Secure the mask to the patient. Do not make the straps too tight.
- Titrate the inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) and expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) to achieve patient comfort, adequate exhaled tidal volume, and synchrony with the ventilator. Monitor the peak airway pressure delivered.
- 8. Check for leaks and adjust the straps if necessary.
- Monitor respiratory rate, heart rate, level of dyspnea, O<sub>2</sub> saturation, minute ventilation, and exhaled tidal volume.
- 10. Obtain blood gas values within 1 hour.

compliance. Carefully explaining the process and repeating the explanations as the process continues can significantly improve patient compliance. The purpose of the interface, goals of the therapy, expected results, and possible complications should be explained clearly using terms the patient can understand.

The respiratory therapist may want to have several types and sizes of interfaces at the patient's bedside. If a mask is chosen, a fitting gauge can aid in ensuring the proper size and fit. After selecting the appropriate interface, the respiratory therapist turns on the ventilator, attaches the interface to the circuit, and sets initial low-pressure settings. Most often, these include an EPAP pressure of 4 to 5 cm  $\rm H_2O$  and an IPAP pressure of 8 to 10 cm  $\rm H_2O$ .<sup>6</sup> At this point, the alarms are silenced and the patient is allowed to hold the mask to the face before the headgear is secured.

During the setup, the respiratory therapist should reassure the patient and coach the person in the proper breathing pattern. A different interface or mask size may be necessary if excessive leakage or discomfort occurs. Once the patient is comfortable and his or her breathing has become synchronized with the ventilator, the headgear straps are adjusted to ensure a snug, secure fit. The straps should not be too tight because this increases leakage from the mask (as mentioned previously, if the interface has been properly secured, the respiratory therapist should be able to slip at least one finger under the straps). Once ventilation has been established and the patient's comfort is ensured, the respiratory therapist can further assess the patient and the effectiveness of the patient-ventilator system.

# MONITORING AND ADJUSTMENT OF NONINVASIVE VENTILATION

Several studies have identified potential indicators of success for patients on NIV in both the acute and chronic care setting

### BOX **19.5**

### Predictors of Success With Noninvasive Ventilation

- · Higher level of consciousness
- · Younger age
- · Less severe illness; no comorbidities
- Less severe gas exchange abnormalities (pH 7.10-7.35; arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide [P<sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>] <92 mm Hq)</li>
- · Minimal air leakage around the interface
- Intact dentition
- · Synchronous breathing efforts with ventilator
- · Lower quantity of secretions
- · Absence of pneumonia
- · Positive initial response to NIV within 1 to 2 hours
  - Correction of pH
  - · Decreased respiratory rate
  - Reduced P<sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>

(Box 19.5). In the acute care setting, NIV is more likely to be successful in patients who are alert and cooperative, can protect the airway, and have not yet developed severe acid—base or gas exchange abnormalities than it is in patients who are limited in any of these. The patient's initial response to NIV may be the most significant indicator of success or failure. For this reason, close bedside monitoring of the patient's vital signs and respiratory status begins as soon as NIV is instituted and continues until the patient's respiratory status has stabilized (Case Study 19.1).

Patient tolerance and comfort with the system are important to ensuring the effectiveness of NIV at alleviating respiratory distress. Clinically, improvement in patient comfort is indicated by a decrease in respiratory rate, reduced inspiratory muscle activity, and synchronization with the ventilator. If these indicators are absent, the respiratory therapist must take steps to ensure the patient's comfort, such as refitting or changing the mask to reduce air leakage, encouraging and coaching the patient in the proper breathing pattern, or adjusting ventilator settings (Key Point 19.10).

**Key Point** 19.10 Improvement in patient comfort is indicated by a decreased respiratory rate, decreased inspiratory muscle activity, and synchronization with the ventilator.

#### Case Study 19.1

#### **Patient Selection for Noninvasive Ventilation**

A 72-year-old woman with a history of COPD is receiving NIV for ventilatory failure secondary to postoperative pneumonia. The patient is wearing a full-face mask but is having difficulty swallowing and coughing. She appears weak and has become more agitated and confused in the past hour. The respiratory rate is 24 breaths/min, and the  $S_pO_2$  is 92%.  $O_2$  is being bled into the patient's mask at the rate of 5 L/min. What action should be taken at this time?

### 9

#### Case Study 19.2

#### **Monitoring and Adjusting Noninvasive Ventilation**

A 71-year-old, 176-lb (80-kg) man is admitted to the ICU for an acute exacerbation of COPD. On admission he was tachypneic and dyspneic, as evidenced by a respiratory rate of 30 beats/min and the use of accessory muscles of respiration. Arterial blood gas values with nasal  $O_2$  at 2 L/m were as follows: pH = 7.31,  $P_aCO_2$  = 56 mm Hg,  $P_aO_2$  = 49 mm Hg. The attending physician ordered NIV in an attempt to normalize the pH. The respiratory therapist initiates NIV with a full-face mask at the following settings: A/C mode; respiratory rate (f) = 12 breaths/min; IPAP = 10 cm  $H_2O$ ; EPAP = 4 cm  $H_2O$ ; and  $O_2$  at 3 L/min bled into the circuit at the machine outlet.

After 1 hour on NIV, the patient complains of some dyspnea and discomfort and has a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min. The average exhaled tidal volume is approximately 310 mL. The full-face mask appears to fit well, and no significant leaks are detected. Arterial blood gases at this time are pH = 7.32,  $P_aCO_2 = 53$  mm Hg,  $P_aO_2 = 59$  mm Hg, and  $S_aO_2 = 90\%$ . What changes, if any, should be made in the current settings to make the patient more comfortable and help normalize pH?

Insufficient IPAP levels often result in sustained or increased respiratory rates caused by inadequate  $V_T$  delivery. Patient—ventilator synchrony may be improved by adjusting rise time, inspiratory sensitivity, and expiratory flow cycling percentage (if available) and by carefully increasing EPAP to offset possible intrinsic PEEP. If EPAP is increased, IPAP may also need to be increased to maintain the same gradient between IPAP and EPAP and thus ensure adequate  $V_T$  delivery. Low doses of sedative may also be necessary to assist patient compliance (Case Study 19.2).

Oxygenation and heart rate are monitored continuously with pulse oximetry. The  $F_{\rm I}O_2$  is adjusted to maintain  $S_pO_2$  at 90% to 92%. Shortly after initiation of NIV (1–2 hours), the adequacy of ventilatory support is determined by arterial blood gas (ABG) measurements. Patients showing an improved pH and  $P_aCO_2$  are more likely to avoid intubation. However, the  $P_aCO_2$  may take longer to decrease in some patients, particularly those with chronic hypercapnia. This should not cause alarm as long as the patient is showing clinical improvement in oxygenation and a decrease in respiratory distress.

A patient in ARF is closely observed in an acute care setting (ICU, emergency department) so that if NIV is unsuccessful, other means of support are readily available. Attempts at NIV are terminated in favor of invasive measures if the pH and  $P_aCO_2$  continue to worsen or show no improvement and are accompanied by respiratory distress, worsening level of consciousness, hemodynamic instability, or worsening oxygenation. Other measures of support may be necessary if the patient cannot tolerate any of the types or sizes of interfaces or is unable to clear secretions and protect the airway (Box 19.6).

Some patients require NIV on a long-term, intermittent basis (e.g., as for OSA). The focus of monitoring in these patients is to alleviate the signs and symptoms associated with chronic hypoventilation and impaired sleep, such as fatigue, daytime somnolence, morning headache, and dyspnea. In some cases, signs and

#### Case Study 19.3

#### **Common Complications of Noninvasive Ventilation**

A 68-year-old man with severe stable COPD and OSA has been receiving NIV via nasal mask for approximately 3 months. Follow-up ABG analysis and continuous nocturnal oximetry do not show any significant improvement in gas exchange or the frequency of sleep-related events. When questioned about his use of the NIV system, the patient admits he uses the system only for about 2 hours because of uncomfortable nasal dryness and sinus pain. The respiratory therapist examines the patient's NIV equipment and notes that it includes an unheated passover humidifier and that the nasal mask appears to fit well without significant leakage. What can be done to increase the patient's comfort and tolerance with the NIV system?

symptoms of **cor pulmonale** associated with chronic hypoxemia may also be present, such as distended neck veins, enlarged liver, and peripheral edema. Alleviation of these signs and symptoms may take several days or weeks and depend mainly on the patient's comfort, tolerance, and compliance with the NIV system. Efforts are made to maximize patient comfort by choosing a well-fitting and comfortable interface and headgear and by initiating short trials of NIV and slowly increasing the patient's time on the system. Once a patient can tolerate the NIV system for 4 to 6 hours per 24 hours, signs and symptoms are likely to improve.

Objective evidence (e.g., continuous nocturnal oximetry, ABGs) may reveal an improvement in gas exchange and a decrease in or complete cessation of the number of sleep-related respiratory events. If no improvement is seen after about 4 to 6 weeks, the clinician should attempt to determine the reasons for failure. These may include lack of motivation and compliance because of discomfort, advanced age, the existence of comorbidities and cognitive defects, or the need for additional therapeutic efforts<sup>72</sup> (Case Study 19.3).

# AEROSOL DELIVERY IN NONINVASIVE VENTILATION

The administration of aerosolized bronchodilators is often necessary for patients receiving NIV, especially those with obstructive airway disease. Patients may be removed from the ventilator and given

### BOX **19.7**

### Factors Affecting Aerosol Delivery During Noninvasive Ventilation

- 1. Type of aerosol generator (SVN vs. VMN vs. MDI)
- 2. Position of the leak port
- 3. Synchronization of MDI actuation with inspiration
- 4. IPAP and EPAP levels
- 5. Presence or absence of a humidifier in the circuit

aerosolized medications via nebulizer or pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) with a spacer in the traditional manner, but this may cause rapid deterioration of the patient's condition.

Medications (e.g., bronchodilators) can be administered in line with the NIV using a small-volume nebulizer (SVN), a vibrating mesh nebulizer (VMN), or pMDI with a spacer. A number of studies have shown that each device can be an effective means of delivering medications to patients, but clinicians should be aware of the factors that affect the efficiency of aerosol delivery (Box 19.7). These factors include the type of circuit and ventilator settings used, the position of the aerosol generator in relation to the leak port, and the type of aerosol generators and interface used during the treatment.

Ventilator settings affect delivery and response to bronchodilators during NIV, with higher peak inspiratory pressure associated with greater deposition as opposed to an increase in expiratory pressure, which leads to a decrease in aerosol delivery. Previous studies had shown that the efficiency of aerosol delivery was similar for either a nebulizer or an MDI when the leak port is located in the circuit and the aerosol device is placed between the leak port and mask <sup>98</sup> (Fig. 19.14). If the leak port is located in the mask, aerosol delivery from a pMDI is more efficient than from a nebulizer provided the MDI is actuated at the beginning of inspiration. When NIV is delivered through a conventional ventilator circuit and mask with no leak, aerosol methods used with continuous mechanical ventilation apply.

It is also worth noting that studies indicate that the percentage of drug delivery is lower with SVN compared with pMDI or VMN and that the amount of drug delivered with the vibrating mesh nebulizer is greater than with either an SVN or a pMDI.

Aerosol delivery to the lower airways is less effective when administered through a humidified circuit during invasive ventilation. It is reasonable to suggest that the use of a humidified circuit with NIV would likely give similar results, although this effect has not been studied with NIV.

Nasal masks or full-face masks present additional problems during aerosol delivery. Air leaks in the mask or circuit cause continuous flow in the circuit to increase, which may potentially increase aerosol loss. The volume of the mask itself increases the potential for a larger portion of the aerosol dose to deposit on the face or in the eyes of the patient. For this reason, aerosol therapy is not recommended when a total face mask or helmet is being used to administer NIV. <sup>101</sup>

# COMPLICATIONS OF NONINVASIVE VENTILATION

NIV is considered much safer than invasive mechanical ventilation. Complications with NIV are usually related to mask

discomfort, air pressures, or gas flows. Serious complications can occur, such as aspiration pneumonia, pneumothorax, and hypotension, but they are unlikely if patient selection guidelines are closely followed. If the NIV is to be successful, the respiratory therapist must be knowledgeable about all potential complications and take the proper course of action to prevent or minimize their occurrence.

Mask discomfort is the most common complication of NIV. Air leaks around the mask often result in eye irritation. In addition, the strap pressure required to maintain an airtight fit often creates excessive pressure over the bridge of the nose and cheek area. Pressure sores may develop, leading to skin breakdown and ulceration of the nasal bridge. To correct this problem, the respiratory therapist first checks the mask for proper size and fit, making sure that the mask is not too large and that headgear tension has been minimized as much as possible. Forehead spacers or wound-care dressing or both may alleviate pressure on the nasal bridge and protect the skin. A change to a different style of mask or headgear system or a complete change of interface may be required in some cases. Nasal gel masks, bubble-type masks, and masks with added plastic flaps are designed to facilitate a better seal with lower headgear strap tensions.

Nasal pillows or nasal seals can also be used to relieve pressure on the nasal bridge, but they can become uncomfortable because of pressure on the nares. If this occurs, alternating between interface styles may help, especially when NIV is to be used long term.

Another common complaint from patients who use nasal masks is nasal and oral dryness or nasal congestion from high flows through the mask and air leakage through the mouth. Adding or increasing humidification or irrigating the nasal passages with saline may prove helpful. If congestion persists, topical nasal decongestants or steroids can be used. A chinstrap may help with oral dryness because of air leakage through the mouth for patients who have nasal masks. These straps keep the patient's mouth closed and minimize leakage, thus reducing the airflow to the mask. If chinstraps are not effective at reducing leakage through the mouth, a change to an oronasal mask may be better because it covers both the nose and mouth. However, oronasal

masks are subject to the same skin contact problems as nasal masks and may also increase claustrophobic reactions.

Oral interfaces (mouthpieces and lip seals) are associated with minor complications, such as oral discomfort, hypersalivation, and leakage of air from the nose. Most of these problems diminish with fitting adjustments and patient adaptation. If leakage is sufficient to compromise the efficacy of NIV, nose clips may alleviate the problem. Patients who prefer mouthpieces for NIV probably will invest in a custom-made mouthpiece. These may prove to be more tolerable for chronic long-term use of NIV.

Regardless of the interface used, gastric insufflation is a common occurrence in about 50% of all patients using NIV; however, it is rarely intolerable. Gastric insufflation is more likely to occur in patients using volume ventilation.  $^{102}$  In such cases, gas in the stomach is probably the result of the higher pressure needed for  $V_T$  delivery. For the most part, gas insufflation does not cause major problems and usually diminishes in time or with the administration of simethicone agents.

A serious potential complication of NIV is aspiration pneumonia, which is most likely to occur if vomitus is retained in the mask when an oronasal mask is used. Some clinicians recommend that a nasogastric tube be used with an oronasal mask, particularly in patients with excessive gastric distention, nausea, and vomiting. As mentioned previously, aspiration is best prevented through careful selection of patients who are able to cough and protect the airway.

Other major complications of NIV include mucus plugging, hypoxemia, hypotension, and respiratory arrest. Mucus plugging is more likely to occur if the patient is dehydrated or has difficulty expectorating secretions or if humidification is inadequate. High O<sub>2</sub> flow rates (up to 40 L/min) have been associated with life-threatening airway obstruction caused by **inspissated secretions**. The risk for mucus plugging can be minimized if patients are kept well hydrated and appropriate adjunct therapies are applied to assist with secretion removal. Patients with neuromuscular disorders who have impaired cough mechanisms may benefit from cough-assistive techniques. Inline aerosolized bronchodilators and heated humidity may also aid secretion removal in most patients.

Hypoxemia is more likely to occur in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure who require high  $O_2$  concentrations. Most portable PTVs cannot achieve consistent  $F_1O_2$  levels above 50% unless  $O_2$  is bled into the system at abnormally high flow rates, which may interfere with patient synchrony and alter the pressure and flow delivery from the ventilator. Mucus plugging, agitation, and failure to keep the mask on the patient's face also have been linked to hypoxemia. The appearance of any of these contributing factors may be an indication to change to invasive mechanical ventilation.

Hemodynamic complications rarely occur during the administration of NIV or CPAP because low inflation pressures are used with these techniques. Hypotension, when it occurs, is usually seen in patients with low intravascular fluid volume or underlying cardiac disease. Hypotension rarely occurs in patients with COPD but may result if high levels of auto-PEEP develop.

Patients with ACPE may benefit from increased intrathoracic pressures, which reduce venous return and subsequently ventricular preload. However, if ventricular preload declines markedly, organ perfusion may be compromised. Careful selection of initial pressures and close monitoring may reduce the risk for cardiac ischemia in these patients. Table 19.4 summarizes the complications associated with CPAP and NIV.

#### **DISCONTINUING NONINVASIVE VENTILATION**

The duration of ventilatory assistance with NIV depends on how quickly the cause of respiratory failure can be reversed. In most patients with ARF, successful weaning from NIV may occur within hours or a few days. 45 Standard weaning techniques have not been established, but the most common approach involves increasing periods off mask ventilation.

Once the patient's condition is stabilized, the mask may be removed for short periods according to the patient tolerance. Supplemental O<sub>2</sub> is administered as needed during these times off the ventilator. The patient is closely monitored for signs of respiratory distress and fatigue.

If signs of respiratory distress occur, the patient is placed back on mask ventilation immediately. Prolonging these periods of ventilator interruption when the patient is experiencing respiratory distress may lead to rapid decompensation and the need for emergency intubation.

In the same manner as spontaneous breathing trials, periods off the ventilator lengthen as the underlying condition improves and the patient shows acceptable vital signs, good gas exchange, and no respiratory distress. (See Chapter 20 for information on spontaneous breathing trials.)

Another approach to NIV weaning is applied in the same manner as weaning from pressure support ventilation during invasive ventilation. IPAP is gradually reduced to a minimum level, allowing the patient to assume more of the WOB. Once the minimum level has been reached, NIV can be discontinued.

Regardless of the weaning method used, the reversibility of the disease process that caused ARF is the most important consideration for successful weaning. Some patients, especially those with chronic hypercapnia and impaired ventilatory function, may continue to use NIV nocturnally after recovering from an acute exacerbation.

#### **PATIENT CARE TEAM CONCERNS**

The success of NIV depends on time and commitment from the members of the patient care team. All members of this team must thoroughly understand the indications, benefits, and complications of NIV. As a critical member of this team, the respiratory therapist often must commit considerable time to initiating and monitoring NIV. Studies have shown that more time is required during an initial 8-hour shift to institute NIV than to establish conventional invasive ventilation. The extra time is required to fit the patient properly with an interface and to monitor and adjust ventilator settings. Time and patience are also required to remain at the bedside and to instruct patients carefully to obtain their full cooperation. Once the patient's condition has stabilized, this time requirement usually decreases.

### SUMMARY

- NIV is an important option for patients requiring mechanical ventilation.
- The three basic methods of applying NIV are negative pressure ventilation, abdominal-displacement ventilation, and positive pressure ventilation.

- The physiological goal of NIV in ARF is to improve gas exchange by resting the respiratory muscles and increasing alveolar ventilation.
- The most significant benefit of using NIV in treating ARF caused by COPD is the avoidance of intubation, which in turn can lead to longer hospital stays, higher mortality, and increased health care costs.
- NIV may improve daytime gas exchange and symptoms associated with chronic hypoventilation for patients who continue to hypoventilate despite CPAP therapy.
- NIV can be used to reduce the WOB and maintain adequate gas exchange in patients who show fatigue after extubation.
- Patients with terminal or advanced disease who develop ARF are not good candidates for endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. NIV may relieve severe dyspnea in these patients and help ensure patient comfort.
- In the acute care setting, the selection process for NIV must be based on the patient's diagnosis, clinical characteristics, and the risk for failure.

- Establishment of the need for intermittent ventilatory assistance in patients with chronic respiratory failure should begin with the recognition of the typical symptoms of nocturnal hypoventilation and poor sleep quality.
- NIV should be initiated if patients with moderate to severe OSA do not respond favorably to CPAP.
- Excessive drying of nasal mucosa is a common complaint of patients receiving nasal CPAP or NIV. Proper humidification can prevent or improve mucosal dehydration.
- The type of interface used to deliver positive pressure to the airway can influence the effectiveness of NIV. Nasal masks have considerably less mechanical dead space than full-face masks, thus reducing the potential for rebreathing CO<sub>2</sub>.
- NIV is more likely to be successful in the acute care setting for
  patients who are alert and cooperative, can protect the airway,
  and have not yet developed severe acid—base or gas exchange
  abnormalities.
- Potential complications of NIV include aspiration pneumonia, mucus plugging, hypoxemia, hypotension, and respiratory arrest.
