# PHYSIOLOGICAL TERMS AND CONCEPTS RELATED TO MECHANICAL VENTILATION

The purpose of this chapter is to provide a brief review of the physiology of breathing and a description of the pressure, volume, and flow events that occur during the respiratory cycle. The effects of changes in lung characteristics (e.g., respiratory compliance and airway resistance) on the mechanics of breathing are also discussed.

# NORMAL MECHANICS OF SPONTANEOUS VENTILATION

# **Ventilation and Respiration**

The primary function of the respiratory system is gas exchange (i.e., the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between an organism and its environment). Two terms that are used to describe this movement of air into and out of the lungs are ventilation and respiration. Spontaneous ventilation or breathing is typically defined as the movement of air into and out of the lungs. The driving force required to accomplish a spontaneous breath involves establishing a pressure difference between the atmosphere and the pressure inside of the lungs. As discussed in the following section on gas flow and pressure gradients, it is important to recognize that establishing this pressure gradient during a spontaneous inspiration is not a passive event but rather an active event involving "work" performed by the respiratory muscles. Specifically, it is the contraction of the muscles of inspiration during a spontaneous breath that causes expansion of the thorax, which in turn produces a decrease in the intrapulmonary pressure. It is important to recognize that establishing this pressure gradient during spontaneous inspiration is not a passive event but rather an active event involving "work" performed by the respiratory muscles due to the elastic properties of the lungs and chest wall surrounding the lungs.

During a quiet inspiration, the diaphragm descends and enlarges the longitudinal length of the thoracic cavity while the external intercostal muscles raise the ribs slightly, increasing the circumference of the thorax. Contraction of the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles provides the energy to move air into the lungs and therefore perform the work of breathing required to overcome the impedance offered by the lungs and chest wall. Note that during a maximal spontaneous inspiration, the accessory muscles of inspiration must also be recruited to increase the volume of the thorax.

During a quiet expiration, the inspiratory muscles simply relax, the diaphragm moves upward, and the ribs return to their resting position. The volume of the thoracic cavity decreases, and air is forced out of the alveoli. To achieve a maximum expiration (below the end-tidal expiratory level), the accessory muscles of expiration must be used to compress the thorax. Box 1.1 lists the various accessory muscles of breathing.

Respiration involves the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between an organism and its environment. Respiration is typically divided into two components: **external respiration** and **internal respiration**. External respiration involves the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the alveoli and the pulmonary capillaries. Oxygenated blood leaving the pulmonary capillaries is carried by the pulmonary veins to the left heart and distributed to

the cells of the body via the systemic arteries and capillaries. Simultaneously, carbon dioxide dissolved in blood returning via the systemic veins from the systemic organs diffuses from the pulmonary capillaries into the alveoli and is ultimately exhaled to the atmosphere during expiration.

Internal respiration occurs at the cellular level and involves the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the systemic capillaries and the cells of the body. At the cellular level, oxygen diffuses into the cells, where it is used in the oxidation of available substrates (e.g., carbohydrates and lipids) to produce energy. Carbon dioxide, which is a major by-product of aerobic metabolism, diffuses out of the cells into the systemic capillaries and is returned by bulk flow via the systemic veins back to the right heart, the pulmonary arteries, and the pulmonary capillaries.

# Gas Flow and Pressure Gradients During Ventilation

For air to flow through a tube or airway, a **pressure gradient** must exist (i.e., pressure at one end of the tube must be higher than pressure at the other end of the tube). Air will always flow from the high-pressure point to the low-pressure point.

Consider what happens during a normal quiet breath. Lung volumes change as a result of gas flow into and out of the airways caused by changes in the pressure gradient between the airway opening and the alveoli. During a spontaneous inspiration, contraction of the inspiratory muscles causes enlargement of the thorax resulting in a decrease (more negative) in intrapleural and alveolar pressure. The alveolar pressure therefore becomes less than the pressure at the airway opening (i.e., the mouth and nose), and gas flows into the lungs. Conversely, during a quiet expiration, relaxation of the inspiratory muscles results in a decrease in thoracic volume (i.e., diaphragm and external intercostal muscles return to their resting position) and an increase in alveolar pressure. Gas flows out of the lungs during expiration because the pressure in the alveoli is higher than the pressure at the airway opening. It is important to recognize that when the pressure at the airway opening and the pressure in the alveoli are the same, as occurs at the end of expiration, bulk gas flow does not occur because the pressures across the conductive airways are equal (i.e., there is no pressure gradient).

# **Units of Pressure**

Ventilating pressures are commonly measured in centimeters of water pressure (cm H<sub>2</sub>O) or mm of mercury pressure (mm Hg). These pressures are referenced to atmospheric pressure, which is assigned a baseline value of zero. In other words, although atmospheric pressure is 760 mm Hg or 1034 cm H<sub>2</sub>O (1 mm Hg = 1.36 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) at sea level, atmospheric pressure is designated as 0 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. For example, when airway pressure increases by +20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O during a positive pressure breath, the pressure actually increases from 760 mm Hg to 780 mm Hg (1034 to 1054 cm H<sub>2</sub>O). Other units of measure that are becoming more widely used for gas pressures, such as arterial oxygen pressure (P<sub>a</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and arterial carbon dioxide pressure (P<sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>), are the torr (1 Torr = 1 mm Hg) and the kilopascal ([kPa]; 1 kPa = 7.5 mm Hg). The kilopascal is used in the International System of Units. (Box 1.2 provides a summary of common units of measurement for pressure.)

# **Definitions of Pressures and Gradients in the**

Airway opening pressure (Pawo) is most often called mouth pressure (P<sub>M</sub>) or airway pressure (P<sub>aw</sub>) (Fig. 1.1). Other terms that are often used to describe the airway opening pressure include upper-airway pressure, mask pressure, and proximal airway pressure. Unless pressure is applied at the airway opening, P<sub>awo</sub> is zero or atmospheric pressure.

A similar measurement is the pressure at the body surface (Pbs) equal to zero (atmospheric pressure) unless the person is placed in a pressurized chamber (e.g., hyperbaric chamber) or a negative pressure ventilator (e.g., iron lung).

Intrapleural pressure (Ppl) is the pressure in the potential space between the parietal and visceral pleurae. Ppl is normally about -5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O at the end of expiration during spontaneous breathing. It is about -10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O at the end of inspiration. Because P<sub>pl</sub> is often difficult to measure in a patient, a related measurement is used, the esophageal pressure (Pes), which is obtained by placing a specially designed balloon in the esophagus; changes in the balloon pressure are used to estimate pressure and pressure changes in the pleural space. (See Chapter 10 for more information about esophageal pressure measurements.)

Another commonly measured pressure is alveolar pressure (Palv). This pressure is also called intrapulmonary pressure or lung pressure. Alveolar pressure normally changes as the intrapleural pressure changes. During spontaneous inspiration, Paly is about -1 cm  $H_2O$ , and during exhalation it is about +1 cm  $H_2O$ .

Four basic pressure gradients are used to describe normal ventilation: transairway pressure, transthoracic pressure, transpulmonary pressure (or transalveolar pressure), and transrespiratory pressure (Table 1.1; see also Fig. 1.1).

# **Transairway Pressure**

Transairway pressure (P<sub>TA</sub>) is the pressure difference between the airway opening and the alveolus:  $P_{TA} = P_{awo} - P_{alv}$ . It is therefore the pressure gradient required to produce airflow in the conductive airways. It represents the pressure that must be generated to overcome resistance to gas flow in the airways (i.e., airway resistance).

#### **Transthoracic Pressure**

Transthoracic pressure (P<sub>W</sub> or P<sub>TT</sub>) is the pressure difference between the alveolar space or lung and the body's surface (Pbs): PW (or  $P_{TT}$ ) =  $P_{alv} - P_{bs}$ . It represents the pressure required to expand or contract the lungs and the chest wall at the same time.

#### **Transpulmonary Pressure**

Transpulmonary pressure or transalveolar pressure (P<sub>L</sub> or P<sub>TP</sub>) is the pressure difference between the alveolar space and the pleural space  $(P_{pl})$ :  $P_L$  (or  $P_{TP}$ ) =  $P_{alv} - P_{pl}$ .  $P_L$  is the pressure required to maintain alveolar inflation and is therefore sometimes called the alveolar distending pressure.<sup>2-4</sup> (NOTE: An airway pressure measurement called the plateau pressure [Pplat] is sometimes substituted for Palv. Pplat is measured during a breath-hold maneuver during mechanical ventilation, and the value is read from the ventilator manometer. (Pplat is discussed in more detail later in this chapter.)

All modes of ventilation increase P<sub>TP</sub> during inspiration, by either decreasing Ppl (negative pressure ventilators) or increasing P<sub>alv</sub> by increasing pressure at the upper airway (positive pressure ventilators). During negative pressure ventilation, the pressure at

the body surface  $(P_{bs})$  becomes negative and this pressure is transmitted to the pleural space, resulting in a decrease (more negative) in intrapleural pressure  $(P_{pl})$  and an increase in transpulmonary pressure  $(P_L)$ . During positive pressure ventilation, the  $P_{bs}$  remains atmospheric, but the pressures at the airway opening  $(P_{awo})$  and in the conductive airways (airway pressure, or  $P_{aw}$ ) become positive. Alveolar pressure  $(P_{alv})$  then becomes positive, and transpulmonary pressure  $(P_L)$  is increased.\*

# **Transrespiratory Pressure**

Transrespiratory pressure ( $P_{TR}$ ) is the pressure difference between the airway opening and the body surface:  $P_{TR} = P_{awo} - P_{bs}$ . Transrespiratory pressure is used to describe the pressure required to inflate the lungs during positive pressure ventilation. In this situation, the body surface pressure ( $P_{bs}$ ) is atmospheric and usually is given the value zero; thus  $P_{awo}$  becomes the pressure reading on a ventilator gauge ( $P_{aw}$ ).

Transrespiratory pressure has two components: transthoracic pressure (the pressure required to overcome elastic recoil of the lungs and chest wall) and transairway pressure (the pressure required to overcome airway resistance). Transrespiratory pressure can therefore be described by the equations  $P_{TR} = P_{TT} + P_{TA}$  and  $(P_{awo} - P_{bs}) = (P_{alv} - P_{bs}) + (P_{aw} - P_{alv})$ .

Consider what happens during a normal, spontaneous inspiration (Fig. 1.2). As the volume of the thoracic space increases, the pressure in the pleural space (intrapleural pressure) becomes more negative in relation to atmospheric pressures. (This is an expected result according to Boyle's law. For a constant temperature, as the volume increases, the pressure decreases.) The intrapleural pressure drops from about -5 cm  $H_2O$  at end expiration to

about -10 cm  $\rm H_2O$  at end inspiration. The negative intrapleural pressure is transmitted to the alveolar space, and the intrapulmonary, or alveolar ( $\rm P_{alv}$ ), pressure becomes more negative relative to atmospheric pressure. The transpulmonary pressure ( $\rm P_L$ ), or the pressure gradient across the lung, widens (Table 1.2). As a result, the alveoli have a negative pressure during spontaneous inspiration.

The pressure at the airway opening or body surface is still atmospheric, creating a pressure gradient between the mouth (zero) and the alveolus of about -3 to -5 cm  $H_2O$ . The transairway pressure gradient ( $P_{TA}$ ) is approximately (0-[-5]), or 5 cm  $H_2O$ . Air flows from the mouth or nose into the lungs and the alveoli expand. When the volume of gas builds up in the alveoli and the pressure returns to zero, airflow stops. This marks the end of inspiration; no more gas moves into the lungs because the pressure at the mouth and in the alveoli equals zero (i.e., atmospheric pressure) (see Fig. 1.2).

During expiration, the muscles relax and the elastic recoil of the lung tissue results in a decrease in lung volume. The thoracic volume decreases to resting, and the intrapleural pressure returns to about -5 cm  $\rm H_2O$ . Notice that the pressure inside the alveolus during exhalation increases and becomes slightly positive (+5 cm  $\rm H_2O$ ). As a result, pressure is now lower at the mouth than inside the alveoli, and the transairway pressure gradient causes air to move out of the lungs. When the pressure in the alveoli and mouth is equal, exhalation ends.

#### **LUNG CHARACTERISTICS**

Normally, two types of forces oppose inflation of the lungs: elastic forces and frictional forces. Elastic forces arise from the elastic properties of the lungs and chest wall. Frictional forces are the result of two factors: the resistance of the tissues and organs as they become displaced during breathing and the resistance to gas flow through the airways.

Two parameters are often used to describe the mechanical properties of the respiratory system and the elastic and frictional forces opposing lung inflation: *compliance* and *resistance*.

The definition of transpulmonary pressure varies in research articles and textbooks. Some authors define it as the difference between airway opening pressure and pleural pressure, whereas others define transpulmonary pressure as the pressure difference between airway pressure and pleural pressure. This latter definition implies that airway pressure is the pressure exerted by the lungs during a breath-hold maneuver, that is, under static (no-flow) conditions.<sup>4</sup>

# **Compliance**

The **compliance** (C) of any structure can be described as the relative ease with which the structure distends. It can be defined as the inverse of **elastance** (e), where *elastance* is the tendency of a structure to return to its original form after being stretched or acted on by an outside force. Thus C = 1/e or e = 1/C. The following examples illustrate this principle. A balloon that is easy to inflate is said to be compliant (it demonstrates reduced elasticity), whereas a balloon that is difficult to inflate is considered not compliant (it has increased elasticity). In a similar way, consider the comparison of a golf ball and a tennis ball. The golf ball is more elastic than the tennis ball because it tends to retain its original form; a considerable amount of force must be applied to the golf ball to compress it. A tennis ball, on the other hand, can be compressed more easily than the golf ball, so it can be described as less elastic and more compliant.

In the clinical setting, compliance measurements are used to describe the elastic forces that oppose lung inflation. More specifically, the compliance of the respiratory system is determined by measuring the change ( $\Delta$ ) of volume (V) that occurs when pressure (P) is applied to the system:  $C = \Delta V/\Delta P$ . Volume typically is measured in liters or milliliters and pressure in centimeters of water pressure. It is important to understand that the compliance of the respiratory system is the sum of the compliances of both the lung parenchyma and the surrounding thoracic structures. In a spontaneously breathing individual, the total respiratory system compliance is about 0.1 L/cm H<sub>2</sub>O (100 mL/cm H<sub>2</sub>O); however, it can vary considerably, depending on a person's posture, position, and whether he or she is actively inhaling or exhaling during the measurement. It can range from 0.05 to 0.17 L/cm H<sub>2</sub>O (50 to 170 mL/cm H<sub>2</sub>O). For intubated and mechanically ventilated patients with normal lungs and a normal chest wall, compliance

# **CRITICAL CARE CONCEPT 1.1**

#### Calculate Pressure

varies from 40 to 50 mL/cm  $H_2O$  in men and 35 to 45 mL/cm  $H_2O$  in women to as high as 100 mL/cm  $H_2O$  in either gender (Key Point 1.1).

Changes in the condition of the lungs or chest wall (or both) affect total respiratory system compliance and the pressure required to inflate the lungs. Diseases that reduce the compliance of the lungs or chest wall increase the pressure required to inflate the lungs. Acute respiratory distress syndrome and kyphoscoliosis are examples of pathological conditions associated with reductions in lung compliance and thoracic compliance, respectively. Conversely, emphysema is an example of a pulmonary condition in which pulmonary compliance is increased as a result of a loss of lung elasticity. With emphysema, less pressure is required to inflate the lungs.

Critical Care Concept 1.1 presents an exercise in which students can test their understanding of the compliance equation.

For patients receiving mechanical ventilation, compliance measurements are made during static or no-flow conditions (e.g., this is the airway pressure measured at end inspiration; it is designated as the plateau pressure). Thus these compliance measurements are referred to as static compliance or static effective compliance. The tidal volume used in this calculation is determined by measuring the patient's exhaled volume near the patient connector (Fig. 1.3). Box 1.3 shows the formula for calculating static compliance (C<sub>S</sub>) for a ventilated patient. Note that although this calculation technically includes the recoil of the lungs and thorax, thoracic compliance generally does not change significantly in a ventilated patient. (NOTE: It is important to understand that if a patient actively inhales or exhales during measurement of a plateau pressure, the resulting value will be inaccurate. Active breathing can be a particularly difficult issue when patients are tachypneic, such as when a patient is experiencing respiratory distress.)

# Resistance

**Resistance** is a measurement of the frictional forces that must be overcome during breathing. These frictional forces are the result of the anatomical structure of the airways and the tissue viscous resistance offered by the lungs and adjacent tissues and organs.

As the lungs and thorax move during ventilation, the movement and displacement of structures such as the lungs, abdominal

**Fig. 1.3** A volume device (bellows) is used to illustrate the measurement of exhaled volume. Ventilators typically use a flow transducer to measure the exhaled tidal volume. The functional residual capacity is the amount of air that remains in the lungs after a normal exhalation.

organs, rib cage, and diaphragm create resistance to breathing. Tissue viscous resistance remains constant under most circumstances. For example, an obese patient or one with fibrosis has increased tissue resistance, but the tissue resistance usually does not change significantly when these patients are mechanically ventilated. On the other hand, if a patient develops ascites, or fluid accumulation in the peritoneal cavity, tissue resistance increases.

The resistance to airflow through the conductive airways (airway resistance) depends on the gas viscosity, the gas density, the length and diameter of the tube, and the flow rate of the gas through the tube, as defined by Poiseuille's law. During mechanical ventilation, viscosity, density, and tube or airway length remain fairly constant. In contrast, the diameter of the airway lumen can change considerably and affect the flow of the gas into and out of the lungs. The diameter of the airway lumen and the flow of gas into the lungs can decrease as a result of bronchospasm, increased secretions, mucosal edema, or kinks in the endotracheal tube. The rate at which gas flows into the lungs also can be controlled on most mechanical ventilators.

At the end of the expiratory cycle, before the ventilator cycles into inspiration, normally no flow of gas occurs; the alveolar and mouth pressures are equal. Because flow is absent, resistance to flow is also absent. When the ventilator cycles on and creates a positive pressure at the mouth, the gas attempts to move into the lower-pressure zones in the alveoli. However, this movement is impeded or even blocked by having to pass through the endotracheal tube and the upper conductive airways. Some molecules are slowed as they collide with the tube and the bronchial walls; in

doing this, they exert energy (pressure) against the passages, which causes the airways to expand (Fig. 1.4); as a result, some of the gas molecules (pressure) remain in the airway and do not reach the alveoli. In addition, as the gas molecules flow through the airway and the layers of gas flow over each other, resistance to flow, called *viscous resistance*, occurs.

The relationship of gas flow, pressure, and resistance in the airways is described by the equation for airway resistance,  $R_{aw}=P_{TA}/\text{flow}$ , where  $R_{aw}$  is airway resistance and  $P_{TA}$  is the pressure difference between the mouth and the alveolus, or the transairway pressure (Key Point 1.2). Flow is the gas flow measured during inspiration. Resistance is usually expressed in centimeters of water per liter per second (cm  $H_2O/[L/s])$ . In normal, conscious individuals with a gas flow of 0.5 L/s, resistance is about 0.6 to 2.4 cm  $H_2O/(L/s)$  (Box 1.4). The actual amount varies over the entire respiratory cycle. The variation occurs because flow during spontaneous ventilation is usually slower at the beginning and end of the cycle and faster in the middle portion of the cycle.  $^{\rm l}_{\star}$ 

Airway resistance is increased when an artificial airway is inserted. The smaller internal diameter of the tube creates greater resistance to flow (resistance can be increased to 5 to 7 cm  $\rm H_2O/[L/s]$ ). As mentioned, pathological conditions can also increase airway resistance by decreasing the diameter of the airways. In conscious, unintubated patients with emphysema and asthma, resistance may range from 13 to 18 cm  $\rm H_2O/(L/s)$ . Still higher values can occur with other severe types of obstructive disorders.

Several challenges are associated with increased airway resistance. With greater resistance, a greater pressure drop occurs in the conducting airways and less pressure is available to expand the alveoli. As a consequence, a smaller volume of gas is available for gas exchange. The greater resistance also requires that more force be exerted to maintain adequate gas flow. To achieve this force, spontaneously breathing patients use the accessory muscles of inspiration. This generates more negative intrapleural pressures and a greater pressure gradient between the upper airway and the pleural space to achieve gas flow. The same occurs during mechanical ventilation; more pressure must be generated by the

ventilator to try to "blow" the air into the patient's lungs through obstructed airways or a small endotracheal tube.

#### **Measuring Airway Resistance**

Airway resistance pressure is not easily measured; however, the transairway pressure can be calculated:  $P_{TA}=PIP-P_{plat}.$  This allows determination of how much pressure is delivered to the airways and how much to alveoli. For example, if the peak pressure during a mechanical breath is 25 cm  $H_2O$  and the plateau pressure (i.e., pressure at end inspiration using a breath hold) is 20 cm  $H_2O$ , the pressure lost to the airways because of airway resistance is 25 cm  $H_2O-20$  cm  $H_2O=5$  cm  $H_2O$ . In fact, 5 cm  $H_2O$  is about the normal amount of pressure  $(P_{TA})$  lost to airway resistance  $(R_{aw})$  with a proper-sized endotracheal tube in place. In another example, if the peak pressure during a mechanical breath is 40 cm  $H_2O$  and the plateau pressure is 25 cm  $H_2O$ , the pressure lost to airway resistance is 40 cm  $H_2O-25$  cm  $H_2O=15$  cm  $H_2O$ . This value is high and indicates an increase in  $R_{aw}$  (see Box 1.4).

Many mechanical ventilators allow the therapist to choose a specific constant flow setting. Monitors are incorporated into the user interface to display peak airway pressures, plateau pressure, and the actual gas flow during inspiration. With this additional information, airway resistance can be calculated. For example, let us assume that the flow is set at 60 L/min, the peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 40 cm  $H_2O$ , and the  $P_{plat}$  is 25 cm  $H_2O$ . The  $P_{TA}$  is therefore 15 cm  $H_2O$ . To calculate airway resistance, flow is converted from liters per minute to liters per second (60 L/min = 60 L/60 s = 1 L/s). The values are then substituted into the equation for airway resistance,  $R_{aw} = (PIP - P_{plat})/flow$ :

$$R_{aw} = \left[ \frac{40 - 25 \text{ cmH}_2 \text{O}}{1(\text{L/s})} \right] = 15 \text{ cm} \frac{\text{H}_2 \text{O}}{(\text{L/s})}$$

For an intubated patient, this is an example of elevated airway resistance. The elevated  $R_{aw}$  may be caused by increased secretions, mucosal edema, bronchospasm, or an endotracheal tube that is too small

Ventilators with microprocessors can provide real-time calculations of airway resistance. It is important to recognize that where

<sup>\*</sup>The transairway pressure  $(P_{TA})$  in this equation is sometimes referred to as  $\Delta P$ , the difference between peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) and  $P_{plat}$ . (See the section on defining pressures in positive pressure ventilation.)

# Case Study 1.1

# Determine Static Compliance (C<sub>S</sub>) and Airway Resistance (Raw)

An intubated, 36-year-old woman diagnosed with pneumonia is being ventilated with a volume of 0.5 L (500 mL). The peak inspiratory pressure is 24 cm  $\rm H_2O$ ,  $\rm P_{plat}$  is 19 cm  $\rm H_2O$ , and baseline pressure is 0. The inspiratory gas flow is constant at 60 L/min (1 L/s).

What are the static compliance and airway resistance values? Are these normal values?

pressure and flow are measured can affect the airway resistance values. Measurements taken inside the ventilator may be less accurate than those obtained at the airway opening. For example, if a ventilator measures flow at the exhalation valve and pressure on the inspiratory side of the ventilator, these values incorporate the resistance to flow through the ventilator circuit and not just patient airway resistance. Clinicians must therefore know how the ventilator obtains measurements to fully understand the resistance calculation that is reported.

Case Study 1.1 provides an exercise to test your understanding of airway resistance and respiratory compliance measurements.

# **TIME CONSTANTS**

Regional differences in compliance and resistance exist throughout the lungs. That is, the compliance and resistance values of a terminal respiratory unit (acinus) may be considerably different from those of another unit. Thus the characteristics of the lung are heterogeneous, not homogeneous. Indeed, some lung units may have normal compliance and resistance characteristics, whereas others may demonstrate pathophysiological changes such as increased resistance, decreased compliance, or both.

Alterations in C and  $R_{\rm aw}$  affect how rapidly lung units fill and empty. Each small unit of the lung can be pictured as a small, inflatable balloon attached to a short drinking straw. The volume the balloon receives in relation to other small units depends on its compliance and resistance, assuming that other factors are equal (e.g., intrapleural pressures and the location of the units relative to different lung zones).

Fig. 1.5 provides a series of graphs illustrating the filling of the lung during a quiet breath. A lung unit with normal compliance and airway resistance will fill within a normal length of time and with a normal volume (see Fig. 1.5A). If the lung unit has normal resistance but is stiff (low compliance), it will fill rapidly (see Fig. 1.5B). For example, when a new toy balloon is first inflated, considerable effort is required to start the inflation (i.e., high pressure is required to overcome the critical opening pressure of the balloon to allow it to start filling). When the balloon inflates, it does so rapidly at first. It also deflates quickly. Notice, however, that if a given pressure is applied to a stiff lung unit and a normal unit for the same length of time, a much smaller volume will be delivered to the stiff lung unit (compliance equals volume divided by pressure) compared with the volume delivered to the normal unit.

**Fig. 1.5** (A) Filling of a normal lung unit. (B) A low-compliance unit, which fills quickly but with less air. (C) Increased resistance; the unit fills slowly. If inspiration were to end at the same time as in (A), the volume in (C) would be lower.

# BOX 1.5 Calculation of Time Constant

$$\label{eq:constant} \begin{split} &\text{Time constant} = C \times R_{aw} \\ &\text{Time constant} = 0.1 \text{ L/cm H}_2\text{O} \times 1 \text{ cm H}_2\text{O}/\text{(L/s)} \end{split}$$

Time constant = 0.1 s
In a patient with a time constant of 0.1 s, 63% of inhalation (or exhalation) occurs in 0.1 s; that is, 63% of the volume is inhaled (or exhaled) in 0.1 s, and 37% of the volume remains to be exchanged.

Now consider a balloon (lung unit) that has normal compliance but the straw (airway) is narrow (high airway resistance) (see Fig. 1.5C). In this case the balloon (lung unit) fills slowly. The gas takes much longer to flow through the narrow passage and reach the balloon (acinus). If gas flow is applied for the same length of time as in a normal situation, the resulting volume is smaller.

The length of time lung units required to fill and empty can be determined. The product of compliance (C) and resistance ( $R_{aw}$ ) is called a **time constant**. For any value of C and  $R_{aw}$ , the time constant always equals the length of time (in seconds) required for the lungs to inflate or deflate to a certain amount (percentage) of their volume. Box 1.5 shows the calculation of one time constant for a lung unit with a compliance of 0.1 L/cm

![](_page_8_Figure_3.jpeg)

Fig. 1.6 The time constant (compliance × resistance) is a measure of how long the respiratory system takes to passively exhale (deflate) or inhale (inflate). (From Kacmarek RM, Stoller JK, Heuer AJ, editors: Egan's fundamentals of respiratory care, ed 12, St. Louis, MO, 2020, Elsevier.)

 $\rm H_2O$  and an airway resistance of 1 cm  $\rm H_2O/(L/s)$ . One time constant equals the amount of time it takes for 63% of the volume to be inhaled (or exhaled), two time constants represent that amount of time for about 86% of the volume to be inhaled (or exhaled), three time constants equal the time for about 95% to be inhaled (or exhaled), and four time constants are the time required for 98% of the volume to be inhaled (or exhaled) (Fig. 1.6).  $^{4-6}$  In the example in Box 1.5, with a time constant of 0.1 s, 98% of the volume fills (or empties) the lungs in four time constants, or 0.4 s.

After five time constants, the lung is considered to contain 100% of tidal volume to be inhaled or 100% of tidal volume has been exhaled. In the example in Box 1.5, five time constants would equal  $5 \times 0.1$  s, or 0.5 s. Thus in half a second, a normal lung unit, as described here, would be fully expanded or deflated to its end-expiratory volume (Key Point 1.3).

Calculation of time constants is important when setting the ventilator's inspiratory time and expiratory time. An inspiratory time less than three time constants may result in incomplete delivery of the tidal volume. Prolonging the inspiratory time allows even distribution of ventilation and adequate delivery of tidal volume. Five time constants should be considered for the inspiratory time, particularly in pressure ventilation, to ensure adequate volume delivery (see Chapter 2 for more information on pressure ventilation). It is important to recognize, however, that if the inspiratory time is too long, the respiratory rate may be too low to achieve effective minute ventilation.

An expiratory time of fewer than three time constants may lead to incomplete emptying of the lungs. This can increase the **Key Point** 1.3 Time constants approximate the amount of time required to fill or empty a lung unit.

functional residual capacity and cause trapping of air in the lungs. Some clinicians think that using the 95% to 98% volume-emptying level (three or four time constants) is adequate for exhalation.<sup>5,6</sup> Exact time settings require careful observation of the patient and measurement of end-expiratory pressure to determine which time is better tolerated.

In summary, lung units can be described as fast or slow. Fast lung units have short time constants and take less time to fill and empty. Short time constants are associated with normal or low airway resistance and decreased compliance, such as occurs in a patient with interstitial fibrosis. It is important to recognize, however, that these lung units will typically require increased pressure to achieve a normal volume. In contrast, slow lung units have long time constants, which require more time to fill and empty compared with a normal or fast lung unit. Slow lung units have increased resistance or increased compliance, or both, and are typically found in patients with pulmonary emphysema.

It must be kept in mind that the lung is rarely uniform across ventilating units. Some units fill and empty quickly, whereas others do so more slowly. Clinically, compliance and airway resistance measurements reflect a patient's overall lung function, and clinicians must recognize this fact when using these data to guide treatment decisions.

# TYPES OF VENTILATORS AND TERMS USED IN MECHANICAL VENTILATION

Various types of mechanical ventilators are used clinically. The following section provides a brief description of the terms commonly applied to mechanical ventilation.

# **TYPES OF MECHANICAL VENTILATION**

Three basic methods have been developed to mimic or replace the normal mechanisms of breathing: negative pressure ventilation, positive pressure ventilation, and high-frequency ventilation.

# **Negative Pressure Ventilation**

Negative pressure ventilation (NPV) attempts to mimic the function of the respiratory muscles to allow breathing through normal physiological mechanisms. A good example of negative pressure ventilators is the tank ventilator, or "iron lung." With this device, the patient's head and neck are exposed to ambient pressure while the thorax and the rest of the body are enclosed in an airtight container that is subjected to negative pressure (i.e., pressure less than atmospheric pressure). Negative pressure generated around the thoracic area is transmitted across the chest wall, into the intrapleural space, and finally into the intraalveolar space.

With negative pressure ventilators, as the intrapleural space becomes negative, the space inside the alveoli becomes increasingly negative in relation to the pressure at the airway opening (atmospheric pressure). This pressure gradient results in the movement of air into the lungs. In this way, negative pressure ventilators resemble normal lung mechanics. Expiration occurs when the negative pressure around the chest wall is removed. The normal elastic recoil of the lungs and chest wall causes air to flow out of the lungs passively (Fig. 1.7).

Negative pressure ventilators can provide several advantages. The upper airway can be maintained without the use of an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy. Patients receiving negative pressure ventilation can talk and eat while being ventilated. Negative pressure ventilation has fewer physiological disadvantages in patients with normal cardiovascular function than does positive pressure ventilation. In hypovolemic patients, however, a normal cardiovascular response is not always present. As a result, patients can have significant pooling of blood in the abdomen and reduced venous return to the heart. In addition, difficulty gaining access to the patient can complicate care activities (e.g., bathing and turning).

The use of negative pressure ventilators declined considerably in the early 1980s, and currently they are rarely used in hospitals. Other methods of creating negative pressure (e.g., chest cuirass, Poncho wrap, Porta-Lung) have been used in home care to treat patients with chronic respiratory failure associated with neuromuscular diseases (e.g., polio, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). More recently, these devices have been replaced with noninvasive positive pressure ventilators (NIVs) that use a mask, nasal device, or tracheostomy tube as a patient interface. Chapters 19 and 21 provide additional information on the use of NIV and NPV.

# **Positive Pressure Ventilation**

Positive pressure ventilation (PPV) occurs when a mechanical ventilator is used to deliver air into the patient's lungs by way of an endotracheal tube or positive pressure mask. For example, if

![](_page_9_Figure_15.jpeg)

Fig. 1.7 Negative pressure ventilation and the resulting lung mechanics and pressure waves (approximate values). During inspiration, intrapleural pressure drops from about -5 to -10 cm  $H_2O$  and alveolar (intrapulmonary) pressure declines from 0 to -5 cm  $H_2O$ ; as a result, air flows into the lungs. The alveolar pressure returns to zero as the lungs fill. Flow stops when pressure between the mouth and the lungs is equal. During exhalation, intrapleural pressure increases from about -10 to -5 cm  $H_2O$  and alveolar (intrapulmonary) pressure increases from 0 to about +5 cm  $H_2O$  as the chest wall and lung tissue recoil to their normal resting position; as a result, air flows out of the lungs. The alveolar pressure returns to zero, and flow stops.

the pressure applied at the mouth or upper airway is +15 cm  $H_2O$  and the pressure in the alveolus is zero (end exhalation), the gradient between the mouth and the lung is  $P_{TA} = P_{awo} - P_{alv} = 15 -$ , = 15 cm  $H_2O$ . Thus air will flow into the lung (see Table 1.1).

At any point during inspiration, the inflating pressure at the upper (proximal) airway equals the sum of the pressures required to overcome the resistance of the airways and the elastance of the lung and chest wall. During inspiration, the pressure in the alveoli progressively builds and becomes more positive. The resultant positive alveolar pressure is transmitted across the visceral pleura, and the intrapleural space may become positive at the end of inspiration (Fig. 1.8).

At the end of inspiration, the ventilator stops delivering positive pressure. Mouth pressure returns to ambient pressure (zero or atmospheric). Alveolar pressure is still positive, which creates a gradient between the alveolus and the mouth, and air flows out of the lungs. See Table 1.2 for a comparison of the changes in airway pressure gradients during passive spontaneous ventilation.

# **High-Frequency Ventilation**

High-frequency ventilation uses above-normal ventilating rates with below-normal ventilating volumes. Three types of high-frequency ventilation strategies are available: high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV), which uses frequencies from 4 to 10 Hz to provide rates between about 100 and 400 to 600 breaths/min; high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, which uses frequencies 3 to 15 Hz (180 to 900 cycles per/min); and high-frequency percussive ventilation (HFPV). In clinical practice, the various types of high-frequency ventilation are better defined by the type of ventilatory strategy used rather than the specific rates of each.

HFJV involves delivering pressurized jets of gas into the lungs at high frequencies (i.e., 4 to 11 Hz or cycles per second). HFJV is accomplished using a specially designed endotracheal tube adaptor and a nozzle or an injector; the small-diameter tube creates a high-velocity jet of air that is directed into the lungs. Exhalation is passive.

High-frequency oscillatory ventilation ventilators use either a small piston or a device similar to a stereo speaker to deliver gas in a "to-and-fro" motion, pushing gas in during inspiration and drawing gas out during exhalation. Ventilation with high-frequency oscillation has been used primarily in infants with respiratory distress and in adults or infants with open air leaks, such as bronchopleural fistulas.

HFPV was designed and developed by Forrest M. Bird, a pioneer in mechanical ventilation technology. Bird's intent was to incorporate the most effective characteristics of a conventional ventilator and a jet ventilator. The principle of operation is to provide high-frequency ambient pressure pulses (100 to 900 cycles/sec) superimposed on conventional positive pressure breaths (5 to 30 cycles/min). Although HFPV is most often used with a mask or mouthpiece as a therapeutic airway clearance device to mobilize secretions by percussing the chest internally, it also can be used as a continuous mode of ventilation in children. chapters 22 and 23 provide additional details on the unique nature of this mode of ventilation.

Fig. 1.8 Mechanics and pressure waves associated with positive pressure ventilation. During inspiration, as the upper airway pressure rises to about +15 cm  $H_20$  (not shown), the alveolar (intrapulmonary) pressure is zero; as a result, air flows into the lungs until the alveolar pressure rises to about +9 to +12 cm  $H_20$ . The intrapleural pressure rises from about 5 cm  $H_20$  before inspiration to about +5 cm  $H_20$  at the end of inspiration. Flow stops when the ventilator cycles into exhalation. During exhalation, the upper airway pressure drops to zero as the ventilator stops delivering flow. The alveolar (intrapulmonary) pressure drops from about +9 to +12 cm  $H_20$  to 0 as the chest wall and lung tissue recoil to their normal resting position; as a result, air flows out of the lungs. The intrapleural pressure returns to -5 cm  $H_20$  during exhalation.

#### **Baseline Pressure**

Airway pressures are measured relative to a baseline value. In Fig. 1.9, the baseline pressure is zero (or atmospheric), which indicates that no additional pressure is applied at the airway opening during expiration and before inspiration.

If the baseline pressure is higher than zero, such as when the ventilator operator selects a higher pressure to be present at the end of exhalation, this is called **positive end-expiratory pressure** (PEEP) (Fig. 1.10). When PEEP is set, the ventilator prevents the patient from exhaling to zero (atmospheric pressure). PEEP

During mechanical ventilation, proximal airway pressure is not typically measured at the airway opening because of accumulation of secretions and technical errors can alter sensor measurements. Current-generation intensive care unit mechanical ventilators measure airway pressure  $(P_{aw})$  using a sensor positioned proximal to the expiratory valve, which is closed during the inspiration.<sup>2</sup> The ventilator manometer pressure displayed on the user interface of the ventilator is typically designated as airway pressure  $(P_{aw})$ .<sup>2</sup>

therefore increases the volume of gas remaining in the lungs at the end of a normal exhalation; that is, PEEP increases the functional residual capacity. PEEP applied by the operator is referred to as extrinsic PEEP. Auto-PEEP (or intrinsic PEEP), which is a potential side effect of positive pressure ventilation, occurs when air is accidentally trapped in the lung. Intrinsic PEEP typically occurs when a patient does not have enough time to exhale completely before the ventilator delivers another breath.

# **Peak Pressure**

During positive pressure ventilation, the manometer rises progressively to a **peak pressure** ( $P_{Peak}$ ). This is the highest pressure recorded at the end of inspiration.  $P_{Peak}$  is also called **peak inspiratory pressure** (PIP) or **peak airway pressure** (see Fig. 1.9).

The pressures measured during inspiration are the sum of two pressures: the pressure required to force the gas through the resistance of the airways  $(P_{TA})$  and the pressure of the gas volume as it fills the alveoli  $(P_{alv})$ .\*

# **Plateau Pressure**

Another valuable pressure measurement is the plateau pressure. The plateau pressure is measured after a breath has been delivered to the patient and before exhalation begins. Exhalation is prevented by the ventilator for a brief moment (0.5 to 1.5 s). To obtain this measurement, the ventilator operator normally selects a control marked "inflation hold" or "inspiratory pause."

Plateau pressure measurement is similar to holding the breath at the end of inspiration. At the point of breath holding, the pressures inside the alveoli and mouth are equal (i.e., no gas flow). However, the relaxation of the respiratory muscles and the elastic recoil of the lung tissues are exerting force on the inflated lungs. This creates a positive pressure, which can be read on the ventilator manometer as a positive pressure. Because it occurs during a breath hold or pause, the manometer reading remains stable and "plateaus" at a certain value (see Figs. 1.9 through 1.11). It is important to note that the plateau pressure reading will be inaccurate if the patient is actively breathing during the measurement.

Plateau pressure is often used interchangeably with alveolar pressure  $(P_{alv})$  and intrapulmonary pressure. Although these terms are related, they are not synonymous. The plateau pressure reflects the effect of the elastic recoil on the gas volume inside the alveoli and any pressure exerted by the volume in the ventilator circuit that is acted on by the recoil of the plastic circuit.

# Pressure at the End of Exhalation

As previously mentioned, air can be trapped in the lungs during mechanical ventilation if adequate time is not allowed for exhalation. The most effective method to prevent this complication is to monitor the pressure in the ventilator circuit at the end of exhalation. If extrinsic PEEP has not been added and the baseline pressure is greater than zero (i.e., atmospheric pressure), air trapping, or auto-PEEP, is present (this concept is covered in greater detail in Chapter 17).

Plateau pressure End of inspiration before exhalation

**Fig. 1.11** At baseline pressure (end of exhalation), the volume of air remaining in the lungs is the functional residual capacity (FRC). At the end of inspiration, before exhalation starts, the volume of air in the lungs is the tidal volume ( $V_T$ ) plus the FRC. The pressure measured at this point, with no flow of air, is the plateau pressure.

# SUMMARY

- Spontaneous ventilation is accomplished by contraction of the muscles of inspiration, which causes expansion of the thorax, or chest cavity. During mechanical ventilation, the mechanical ventilator provides some or all of the energy required to expand the thorax.
- For air to flow through a tube or airway, a pressure gradient must exist (i.e., pressure at one end of the tube must be higher than pressure at the other end of the tube). Air will always flow from the high-pressure point to the low-pressure point.
- Several terms are used to describe airway opening pressure, including mouth pressure, upper-airway pressure, mask pressure, or proximal airway pressure. Unless pressure is applied at the airway opening, P<sub>awo</sub> is zero, or atmospheric pressure.
- Intrapleural pressure is the pressure in the potential space between the parietal and visceral pleurae.
- The plateau pressure, which is sometimes substituted for alveolar pressure, is measured during a breath-hold maneuver during mechanical ventilation, and the value is read from the ventilator manometer.
- Four basic pressure gradients are used to describe normal ventilation: transairway pressure, transthoracic pressure, transpulmonary pressure, and transrespiratory pressure.

 $<sup>^{\</sup>star}$ At any point during inspiration, gauge pressure equals  $P_{TA}+P_{alv}$ . The gauge pressure also will include pressure associated with PEEP.

- Two types of forces oppose inflation of the lungs: elastic forces and frictional forces.
- Elastic forces arise from the elastance of the lungs and chest wall.
- Frictional forces are the result of two factors: the resistance of the tissues and organs as they become displaced during breathing, and the resistance to gas flow through the airways.
- Compliance and resistance are often used to describe the mechanical properties of the respiratory system. In the clinical setting, compliance measurements are used to describe the elastic forces that oppose lung inflation; airway resistance is a measurement of the frictional forces that must be overcome during breathing.
- The resistance to airflow through the conductive airways (*flow resistance*) depends on the gas viscosity, gas density, length and diameter of the tube, and flow rate of the gas through the tube.
- The product of compliance (C) and resistance (R) is called a *time constant*. For any value of C and R, the time constant approximates the time in seconds required to inflate or deflate the lungs.
- Calculation of time constants is important when setting the ventilator's inspiratory time and expiratory time.
- Three basic methods have been developed to mimic or replace the normal mechanisms of breathing: negative pressure ventilation, positive pressure ventilation, and high-frequency ventilation.
