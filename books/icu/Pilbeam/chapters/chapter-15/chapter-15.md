edatives, analgesics, and paralytics are often required for the treatment of patients requiring mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU). The importance of these drugs in the management of critically ill patients requires critical care therapists to have a working knowledge of the indications and contraindications, mode of action, potential adverse effects, and most appropriate methods to monitor the effects of these drugs.

Sedatives are used to reduce anxiety and agitation and promote sleep and anterograde amnesia; analgesics are used to lessen pain; paralytics are used to facilitate invasive procedures (e.g., surgery, endotracheal intubation), prevent movement, and ensure the stability of artificial airways. Paralysis may also be used to facilitate less conventional mechanical ventilation strategies. (Key Point 15.1)

**Key Point 15.1** Sedatives are used to reduce anxiety and agitation and to promote sleep; analgesics are used to lessen pain. Paralytics are used to facilitate endotracheal intubation, prevent movement, and ensure the stability of artificial airways.

A variety of pharmacological agents are available for achieving sedation and paralysis of mechanically ventilated patients. The most common sedative drugs used in the ICU include benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam, midazolam, lorazepam), neuroleptics (e.g., haloperidol), anesthetic agents (e.g., propofol), and opioids (e.g., morphine, fentanyl). Paralysis can be achieved with neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) that are classified

as depolarizing and nondepolarizing, depending on their mode of action. Succinylcholine is the only example of a depolarizing NMBA in widespread use; the most commonly used non-depolarizing NMBAs include pancuronium, vecuronium, and atracurium.

Maintaining an optimal level of comfort and safety for the patient should be a primary goal when administering sedatives, analgesics, and NMBAs. It is important therefore to recognize that although these agents can dramatically improve patient outcomes in mechanically ventilated patients, they can also precipitate significant hemodynamic, autonomic, and respiratory consequences in these patients. As discussed in Chapter 12, appropriate use of sedation protocols can lead to improved outcomes in critically ill patients (e.g., continuous sedation interruption during weaning and discontinuation of mechanical ventilation can lead to a reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay).

#### **SEDATIVES AND ANALGESICS**

Sedation practices vary considerably because of institutional bias and because the requirements for sedation can vary greatly among patients. As mentioned, sedation is generally prescribed for critically ill patients to treat anxiety and agitation and prevent or at least minimize sleep deprivation. Agitation and sleep deprivation can result from a variety of factors, including extreme anxiety, delirium, pain, and adverse drug effects. Sedation is also often required for mechanically ventilated patients who are being treated with less conventional modes of ventilation, such as high-frequency ventilation, inverse inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio ventilation, and permissive hypercapnia.

The Joint Commission has defined four levels of sedation: minimal, moderate, deep, and anesthesia (Box 15.1). It is important to recognize that sedation needs may vary considerably during the course of a patient's stay in the ICU. For example, deeper levels of sedation and analgesia may be required during the initial phases of mechanical ventilation, especially in cases in which the patient is asynchronous or "fighting" the mechanical ventilatory mode being used. Conversely, minimal levels of sedation and analgesia are usually required during the recovery phase of an illness. Indeed, weaning a patient from mechanical ventilation can be severely hindered if the patient is oversedated. It should be apparent therefore that reliable and accurate methods for assessing the need and level of sedation and analgesia are essential for the successful management of critically ill patients.

## Monitoring the Need for Sedation and Analgesia

Several techniques have been proposed to assess the level of sedation in adults and children. Examples of scoring systems validated for use in critically ill patients include the Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS), the Sedation-Agitation Scale, and the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale. Although considerable debate exists over the best technique, it is generally agreed that patients should be assessed regularly to ensure they are relaxed and are not complaining of pain (Key Point 15.2).

The RSS is shown in Table 15.1.8 Notice that it is a graduated single-category scale. The grade assigned by the observer depends

## **BOX 15.1** Levels of Sedation

#### **Minimal Sedation**

Patients can respond to verbal commands, although cognitive function may be impaired. Ventilatory and cardiovascular functions are unaffected.

#### **Moderate Sedation (Conscious Sedation)**

The patient can perform purposeful response after repeated or painful stimulation. (NOTE: Reflex withdrawal from painful stimulus is not considered a purposeful response.) Spontaneous ventilation is adequate, and cardiovascular function is usually maintained.

#### **Deep Sedation**

The patient is not easily aroused but can respond to painful stimulation. Spontaneous ventilation and maintenance of patent airway may be inadequate. Cardiovascular function is usually maintained.

#### **Anesthesia**

This level involves general anesthesia, spinal, or major regional anesthesia; local anesthesia is not included. Patient cannot be aroused, even by painful stimulation. Ventilatory assistance is typically required (i.e., artificial airway and positive pressure ventilation). Cardiovascular function may be impaired.

**Key Point 15.2** Pain assessment and response to therapy should be performed regularly and systematically documented.<sup>7</sup>

## TABLE 15.1 Ramsay Sedation Scale

| Score | Description                                                                                         |

on the patient's response to stimuli. The advantages of using this type of single-category scale are that it is relatively easy to perform and provides a numerical value that can be used as a target for achieving adequate sedation. For example, a score of 2 to 4 on the

RSS indicates adequate sedation. There are several disadvantages associated with using this type of graded scale. Most notably, it does not provide guidance on selection of the most appropriate sedative and is a subjective, nonlinear scale that does not allow for consideration of changing physiological and psychological needs of a patient during the course of his or her illness.<sup>1</sup>

## Benzodiazepines

Benzodiazepines have been the drugs of choice for treatment of anxiety in critical care. Preferential use of these drugs by critical care physicians is probably related to their relatively low cost and the ability of these drugs to produce anxiolytic, hypnotic, muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant, and anterograde amnesic effects. Anterograde amnesia relates to preventing acquisition and encoding of new information that can potentially lead to memories of unpleasant experiences and post-traumatic stress disorder.

Benzodiazepines exert their effects through a nonspecific depression of the central nervous system (CNS). This is accomplished when these drugs bind to benzodiazepine sites on the  $\gamma$ -aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor complex on neurons in the brain. Binding of benzodiazepines to the GABA receptor complex increases the chloride permeability of the neuron, which in turn hyperpolarizes the neuron, making depolarization less likely.<sup>9</sup>

Benzodiazepines vary in potency, onset of action, uptake, distribution, and elimination half-life. The intensity and duration of action for the various benzodiazepines can be affected by a number of patient-specific factors, including age, underlying pathology, and concurrent drug therapy. Prolonged recovery from benzodiazepines typically occurs in patients with renal and hepatic insufficiency.<sup>7</sup>

Benzodiazepines generally produce only minimal effects on cardiovascular function; however, they can cause a significant drop in blood pressure when initially administered to hemodynamically unstable patients (e.g., patients with hypovolemic shock). Similarly, benzodiazepines normally do not adversely affect the respiratory system; however, they can produce hypoventilation or apnea by causing a reduction in ventilatory drive in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease when combined with opioids.

Reversal of the effects of benzodiazepines can be accomplished with flumazenil (Romazicon), which prevents the sedative effects of these drugs by competitively binding to benzodiazepine receptors. It is a short-acting drug that is administered intravenously. Administration of flumazenil is generally reserved for patients admitted to the emergency department for suspected benzodiazepine overdose. The most common side effects of flumazenil include dizziness, panic attacks, and cardiac ischemia, and it may lead to seizures in patients receiving long-term benzodiazepine or tricyclic antidepressant therapy.

#### Diazepam

Diazepam (Valium) has a rapid onset of action because of its high lipid solubility and ability to traverse the blood-brain barrier relatively quickly. The average onset of action for diazepam when it is administered intravenously is 3 to 5 minutes. It is metabolized in the liver to active metabolites that have relatively long half-lives (40–100 hours). These active metabolites are ultimately

eliminated by the kidney. Therefore diazepam elimination can be decreased in older patients, neonates, and patients with compromised hepatic and renal function, resulting in prolonged clinical effects and delayed recovery from sedation.<sup>10</sup>

Intravenous (IV) administration of diazepam is the most reliable method to maintain sedation in critically ill patients because absorption through the oral and intramuscular routes can vary considerably. Continuous infusion of diazepam is not recommended. Instead, a bolus dose of the drug is administered at the start of an infusion, followed by a series of smaller boluses with close titration to produce the desired plasma concentration of the drug.<sup>11</sup>

#### Midazolam

Midazolam (Versed) has a rapid onset of action and short half-life, making it an ideal sedative for the treatment of acutely agitated patients (Key Point 15.3). Note that although it does have a short half-life, prolonged sedation can occur as a result of the accumulation of the drug and its metabolites in the peripheral tissues when it is administered for longer than 48 hours.<sup>1</sup>

**Key Point 15.3** Midazolam and diazepam should be used for rapid sedation of acutely agitated patients.<sup>7</sup>

Midazolam causes a reduction in cerebral perfusion pressure, but it does not protect against increases in intracranial pressure for patients receiving ketamine.<sup>1</sup> Although midazolam does not cause respiratory depression in most patients, it depresses the sensitivity of upper respiratory reflexes and can reduce the ventilatory response in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and in patients receiving narcotics.<sup>12</sup>

Midazolam typically causes only minimal hemodynamic effects (e.g., lower blood pressure, reduction in heart rate) in euvolemic subjects and is usually well tolerated in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. It can produce significant reductions in systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure in patients who depend on increased sympathetic tone to maintain venous return.<sup>1</sup>

#### Lorazepam

Lorazepam (Ativan) is the drug of choice for sedating mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU for longer than 24 hours. It has a slower onset of action compared with diazepam and midazolam because of its lower lipid solubility and longer time required to cross the blood-brain barrier. Its lower lipid solubility coupled with decreased distribution in peripheral tissues may account for its longer duration of action in some patients compared with diazepam and midazolam.<sup>13</sup>

Potential adverse drug interactions are less likely with lorazepam than with other benzodiazepines because it is metabolized in the liver to inactive metabolites. Continual use of lorazepam, however, has been associated with several side effects, including lactic acidosis, hyperosmolar coma, and a reversible nephrotoxicity. These latter side effects have been attributed to the use of the

## Case Study 15.1

## Patient Case—Discontinuing Lorazepam

A 50-year-old man with moderately severe pulmonary fibrosis is admitted to the emergency department with an irregular heart rate and signs of agitation. He reports that he is exhausted and unable to get a good night's sleep. He has been treated with lorazepam (Ativan) for anxiety and insomnia for 6 months. He explains to the attending physician that he stopped taking his medication because "it makes me feel too tired to get anything done." What are some common side effects associated with abruptly discontinuing taking the lorazepam?

solvents (e.g., propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol) in the manufacture of lorazepam.<sup>9</sup> Lorazepam acts synergistically with other CNS depressants and should be administered with caution in patients receiving these drugs.<sup>13</sup> Case Study 15.1 provides more information about several potential harmful effects associated with long-term use of lorazepam.

#### **Dexmedetomidine**

Dexmedetomidine is an α<sub>2</sub>-adrenoreceptor agonist used for shortterm sedation and analgesia in the ICU. It has been shown to reduce sympathetic tone (i.e., sympatholytic activity), with attenuation of the neuroendocrine and hemodynamic response to anesthesia and surgery. It has been shown to reduce the need for anesthetic and opioid requirements.<sup>14</sup> In a randomized controlled study designed to determine the efficacy of dexmedetomidine versus midazolam and propofol (Dipravan) in ICU patients, Jakob and colleagues found that dexmedetomidine had effects similar to those of midazolam and propofol to maintain light to moderate sedation. They also showed that dexmedetomidine appeared to reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation compared with midazolam. Compared with midazolam and propofol, dexmedetomidine reduced the time to extubation. Another interesting finding was that it reduced delirium in patients compared with propofol and improved patients' ability to communicate pain compared with midazolam and propofol. The study did find, however, that more adverse effects were associated with dexmedetomidine compared with midazolam and propofol.<sup>15</sup>

## **Neuroleptics**

Neuroleptics are routinely used to treat patients demonstrating evidence of extreme agitation and delirium. Disorganized thinking and unnecessary motor activity characterize delirium; it is often seen in patients who have been treated in the ICU for prolonged periods (i.e., ICU syndrome) (Key Point 15.4).

**Key Point 15.4** The presence of delirium can delay liberation of patients from mechanical ventilation.

Haloperidol is a butyrophenone that causes CNS depression. Although it is the drug of choice for the treatment of delirium in ICU patients, it can cause some potentially serious side effects. It possesses antidopaminergic and anticholinergic effects. It can induce  $\alpha\text{-blockade}$ , lower the seizure threshold, and evoke Parkinson-like symptoms (i.e., extrapyramidal effects, such as muscle rigidity, drowsiness, and lethargy). Dose-dependent cardiac dysrhythmias, including QT prolongation and torsades de pointes, have also been reported to occur, particularly in patients receiving high-dose bolus administration of haloperidol.  $^{16}$ 

The onset of action of haloperidol is 3 to 20 minutes after an initial dose is administered intravenously. Additional doses of the drug can be administered if the patient continues to be agitated. Despite the potential side effects noted previously, haloperidol has been demonstrated to be a safe drug for the treatment of delirium in ICU patients.<sup>17</sup>

## **Anesthetic Agents**

Propofol is an IV, general **anesthetic** agent that possesses sedative, amnesic, and hypnotic properties at low doses, although it has no analgesic properties.

Propofol produces significant hemodynamic effects. Most notably, it causes reductions in systemic vascular resistance with a concomitant fall in blood pressure and bradycardia during the initial induction phase. Propofol reduces cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure (ICP), making it a useful sedative for neurosurgical patients. In fact, propofol has been shown to be more effective than fentanyl in reducing ICP in patients with traumatic brain injury. Additionally, propofol and morphine administered simultaneously allow greater control of ICP than does morphine alone.<sup>9</sup>

Propofol has a rapid onset and short duration of sedation once it is discontinued. The rapid awakening from propofol allows interruption of the infusion for neurological assessment. Slightly longer recovery times can occur with prolonged infusion. Clearance appears to be unaffected by renal and hepatic dysfunction (Key Point 15.5).

**Key Point 15.5** Propofol is an ideal sedative when rapid awakening is important, such as when neurological assessment is required, or for extubation.<sup>7</sup>

Adverse effects associated with propofol administration include hypotension, dysrhythmias, and bradycardia. It has also been shown to cause elevation of pancreatic enzymes. Propofol infusion syndrome in ICU sedation is characterized by severe metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, rhabdomyolysis, hepatomegaly, and cardiac and renal failure. Propofol is available as an emulsion in a phospholipid vehicle, which provides 1.1 kcal/mL. This fact is important to keep in mind because propofol is a source of triglycerides and supplemental calories in patients receiving parenteral nutrition. Prolonged use (>48 hours) has also been associated with lactic acidosis and lipedema in pediatric patients.

## **BOX 15.2** Side Effects of Opioids

- · Nausea, vomiting, constipation
- · Respiratory depression
- Bradycardia and hypotension
- Myoclonus (muscle twitching), seizures
- Histamine release, immunosuppression
- Physical dependence

## **Opioids**

Opioids (or opiates) are endogenous and exogenous substances that can bind to a group of receptors located in the CNS and peripheral tissues. Opioids are generally classified as naturally occurring, synthetic, and semisynthetic, or, as discussed later, may be classified on the basis of their activity at opioid receptors.1 Morphine sulfate is a naturally occurring opioid agonist; fentanyl citrate is a synthetic analog of morphine.

Although the primary pharmacological action of opioids is to relieve pain, these drugs can also provide significant secondary sedative and anxiolytic effects, which are mediated through two types of opioid receptors: mu ( $\mu$ ) and kappa ( $\kappa$ ) receptors. The  $\mu$ receptors are responsible for analgesia, and the κ-receptors mediate the sedative effects of these drugs.

It is well recognized that opioids can cause a number of serious side effects (Box 15.2). The severity of these side effects depends on the dosage administered in addition to the extent of the patient's illness and integrity of organ function (i.e., renal, hepatic, and hemodynamic function).

Reversal of the aforementioned side effects can be accomplished with the opioid antagonist naloxone hydrochloride (Narcan). Naloxone has a short onset of action (~30 seconds) and usually lasts about 30 minutes. When used to facilitate opioid withdrawal, a continuous IV infusion is required. It is important to understand that administering smaller doses of naloxone will reverse the respiratory depressant effects of opioids while not interfering with the analgesic effects of these drugs. Using larger doses will not only reverse respiratory depression but also reduce the analgesic effects.

#### Morphine

Morphine is a potent opioid analgesic agent that is the preferred agent for intermittent therapy because of its longer duration of action. It can produce significant effects on the CNS and alter the control of breathing even in normal healthy individuals. Some of the potential side effects of morphine include reductions in minute ventilation (VE), periodic breathing, and even apnea by altering respiratory activity of the pontine and medullary respiratory centers in the brainstem. Morphine's effects on the CNS also include reductions of cerebral blood flow, ICP, and cerebral metabolic activity, drowsiness and lethargy, miosis, and suppression of the cough reflex.18

The effects of morphine on the gastrointestinal tract include reduction of lower esophageal sphincter tone and propulsive peristaltic activity of the intestine, which in turn leads to constipation. Morphine can also increase the tone of the pyloric sphincter and ultimately lead to nausea and vomiting by delaying the passage of contents through the gastrointestinal tract.<sup>1</sup>

Morphine can alter vascular resistance by causing decreases in sympathetic tone and increases in vagal tone. Reduction in vascular tone can lead to significant hypotension in patients who rely on increased sympathetic tone to maintain blood pressure. Increases in serum histamine levels can also occur with the injection of morphine and ultimately add to the peripheral vasodilation and hypotension. Increased serum histamine levels are associated with pruritus and bronchospasm in patients with asthma and in individuals with hypersensitive airways.

In the ICU, the IV route of delivery is the most effective method of administering morphine for sedation. It can be delivered as a bolus or as a continuous infusion when prolonged sedation and analgesia are required. The onset of action of morphine is slower than that of other opioids because of its lower lipid solubility and slower transit time across the blood-brain barrier. It is metabolized to active metabolites, including morphine-6 glucuronide, which can result in prolonged clinical effects. The presence of renal or hepatic diseases can further impair the clearance of morphine and its metabolites.

#### **Fentanyl**

Fentanyl citrate (Sublimaze) is a synthetic opioid that is approximately 100 to 150 times more potent than morphine.<sup>19</sup> Its high lipid solubility and short transit time across the blood-brain barrier produce a rapid onset of action. Fentanyl has a longer half-life than morphine and can accumulate in the peripheral tissues after prolonged infusion. In cases of prolonged infusion, clearance can be delayed, resulting in long-lasting effects (e.g., respiratory depression), particularly in patients with renal failure.

Fentanyl is normally administered as a loading dose followed by a continuous infusion to maintain its analgesic effect because of its short duration of action. Fentanyl transdermal patches are available for patients who require long-term analgesia. Although these patches can provide consistent drug delivery in hemodynamically stable patients, the extent of absorption varies depending on the permeability, temperature, perfusion, and thickness of the patient's skin. Different sites should be used when reapplying patches. Fentanyl patches are not indicated for the treatment of acute analgesia because it takes approximately 12 to 24 hours to reach peak effect. Once the patch is removed, a similar lag period occurs before the effects completely disappear.

Fentanyl has minimal effects on the cardiovascular system and does not cause histamine release as does morphine. It also has minimal effects on the renal system compared with other opioids. Therefore fentanyl is the opioid of choice for patients with unstable hemodynamic status and renal insufficiency (Key Point 15.6). It can cause respiratory depression in some patients because of a biphasic elimination response that occurs when the drug is mobilized from peripheral tissues.

**New Point 15.6** Fentanyl is preferred for patients with hemodynamic instability and renal insufficiency.

Box 15.3 summarizes the agents discussed in this section (Case Study 15.2).

## Case Study 15.2

## Patient Case—Agitated Patient

A 30-year-old woman admitted to the intensive care unit after a motor vehicle accident is anxious and in obvious pain. She is listed as being in guarded condition because of fluctuation in her arterial blood pressure. She has become increasingly combative to the attending staff and made several unsuccessful attempts to remove her endotracheal tube. What would be an effective pharmacological agent to treat this patient's symptoms?

- Facilitation of less conventional mechanical ventilation strategies (e.g., inverse I/E ratios, high-frequency ventilation, permissive hypercapnia)
- Facilitation of intubation, ensuring stability of the airway during transport, or repositioning
- · Dynamic hyperinflation that cannot be corrected
- Adjunctive therapy for controlling raised ICP
- Reduction of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production<sup>1</sup>

As mentioned earlier, the two classes of NMBAs available for paralyzing patients on mechanical ventilation include depolarizing muscle relaxants and nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. **Depolarizing agents** (succinylcholine) resemble acetylcholine in their chemical structure. These drugs induce paralysis by binding to acetylcholine receptors and causing prolonged depolarization of the motor end plate. **Nondepolarizing agents** (pancuronium, vecuronium, atracurium, and cisatracurium) also bind to acetylcholine receptors but cause paralysis by competitively inhibiting the action of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction (Box 15.4 and Case Study 15.3).

Choosing the most appropriate muscle relaxant depends on a number of factors, such as its onset of action and how fast the patient can recover from its effects once it is discontinued, the patient's physical condition and organ function (particularly renal and hepatic function), and the pharmacodynamics and cost of the drug.

Regardless of the NMBA used, it is important to understand that these drugs do *not* possess sedative or analgesic properties

## Case Study 15.3

## Patient Case—Asynchrony

A respiratory therapist notes that a patient is using accessory muscles during mechanical ventilation. The ventilator graphics indicate the presence of patientventilator asynchrony. The respiratory therapist checks for appropriate settings of flow, sensitivity, and ventilator mode and rules out the presence of auto-PEEP. After talking with the physician, it is agreed that the patient may require the use of a pharmacological intervention. What would be appropriate for this patient?

(i.e., reduce anxiety or provide pain relief) and must therefore be used in conjunction with adequate amounts of sedatives and analgesics to ensure patient comfort. Furthermore, monitoring the effectiveness of neuromuscular blockade is essential to ensure patient safety (Key Point 15.8).

![](_page_6_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Key Point 15.8** Neuromuscular blocking agents do *not* possess sedative or analgesic properties.

## **Monitoring Neuromuscular Blockade**

Monitoring neuromuscular blockade can be accomplished using visual, tactile, and electronic assessment of the patient's muscle tone. Observing the patient's skeletal muscle movements and respiratory effort can provide an easy method to determine whether the patient is paralyzed; however, more sophisticated electronic monitoring is typically required to determine the depth of paralysis.

A common method used to assess the depth of paralysis is an electronic technique referred to as train-of-four (TOF) monitoring.<sup>20,21</sup> With this technique, two electrodes are placed on the skin along a nerve path, often near a hand, foot, or facial nerve. An electrical current consisting of four impulses is applied to the peripheral nerve over 2 seconds, and the muscle contractions (twitches) produced provide information about the level of paralysis (Box 15.5).

## BOX **15.5**

#### **Assessment of the Train-of-Four Response**

- · One or two twitches: The paralyzing agent is providing adequate effect.
- Three twitches: The paralyzing agent is moderately effective.
- Four twitches: The paralyzing agent needs to be readministered if continued paralysis is required.

From Mathewson HS: Prolonged neuromuscular blockade [editorial], Respir Care 38:522-524, 1993.

Although there has been considerable debate about how to perform the test and interpret the results (i.e., the number of twitches elicited with the TOF stimulation), the Society for Critical Care Medicine recommends that one or two twitches indicates that an adequate amount of NMBA is being administered.<sup>22</sup> It is important to recognize that TOF monitoring can provide valuable information to enable the clinician to maintain the desired depth of paralysis. Variability can occur among individuals performing the test and thus significantly affect the veracity of the result. When it is performed accurately and in a consistent manner, however, TOF monitoring can reduce the amount of NMBA administered to a patient and thus avoid complications such as the development of prolonged paralysis and muscle weakness.21

## **Depolarizing Agents** Succinvlcholine

Succinylcholine chloride (Anectine) is the only depolarizing NMBA in widespread use. It is a short-acting (5-10 minutes) depolarizing muscle relaxant that has an onset of action of approximately 60 seconds. Succinylcholine (diACh) is most often used to facilitate endotracheal intubation. Its use in the ICU has declined during recent years because of the introduction of newer paralyzing drugs that have minimal cardiovascular side effects. It is important to know, however, that diACh is the recommended drug for inducing paralysis in hemodynamically stable critically ill patients because of its relatively low cost, rapid onset of action, and short duration of action.

The most common side effects associated with diACh include transient hyperkalemia; cardiac dysrhythmias; anaphylactic reactions; prolonged apnea; postoperative myalgias; increased intragastric, intracranial, and intraocular pressures; myoglobinuria; and sustained skeletal muscle contraction. (Hyperkalemia induced by the injection of diACh can be particularly problematic in patients with congestive heart failure who are also receiving diuretics and digitalis.) diACh can also precipitate malignant hyperthermia in susceptible individuals. Malignant hyperthermia is a rare but potentially fatal disorder characterized by sustained skeletal muscle depolarization. It occurs at a rate of 1:50,000 in adults and 1:15,000 in the pediatric population.<sup>20-2</sup>

diACh is inactivated by the action of pseudocholinesterase. Therefore prolonged action of diACh can occur if the serum pseudocholinesterase concentration is low or inhibited. Low concentrations of the enzyme occur during pregnancy, chronic renal failure, or severe liver damage and after starvation. The enzyme can be inhibited by anticholinesterases, organophosphates, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors.13

## **Nondepolarizing Agents**

#### **Pancuronium**

Pancuronium (Pavulon) was one of the first nondepolarizing NMBAs used for prolonged paralysis of patients being mechanically ventilated in the ICU. Paralysis is achieved by administering a loading dose. Sustained muscle paralysis is accomplished by administering a maintenance dose.

Pancuronium is a quaternary ammonium compound—more specifically, an aminosteroid muscle relaxant that has a slow onset and prolonged duration of action. It is metabolized by the liver by acetylation and eliminated through the kidney. The most serious side effect attributed to pancuronium includes prolonged paralysis after discontinuation of the drug, particularly in patients with renal and hepatic failure. The prolonged duration of action may be partially explained by the fact that it is metabolized in the liver to an active 3-hydroxy metabolite that retains up to 50% of the activity of the parent compound.<sup>23</sup>

Other significant side effects associated with pancuronium, which result from its vagolytic effect, include tachycardia, increased cardiac output, and elevated mean arterial pressure. Its sympathomimetic activity can also lead to alterations in the ventilation-perfusion relationship as a result of pulmonary vasoconstriction.<sup>23</sup>

#### Vecuronium

Vecuronium bromide (Norcuron) is an intermediate-duration, nondepolarizing aminosteroid NMBA that does not possess the vagolytic properties of pancuronium.<sup>24</sup> The intermediate duration of action for vecuronium may be explained by its metabolism to minimally active metabolites.<sup>19</sup>

Initial data suggested that vecuronium was an effective means of producing prolonged paralysis in patients with renal insufficiency because of its hepatic and biliary elimination. Subsequent reports, however, suggested that prolonged paralysis may occur in patients with renal and hepatic insufficiency because of accumulation of vecuronium and its 3-desacetyl metabolite.<sup>25</sup>

#### **Atracurium and Cisatracurium**

Like vecuronium, atracurium besylate and its stereoisomer, cisatracurium besylate (Nimbex), are intermediate-duration, non-depolarizing muscle relaxants that do not have the hemodynamic side effects of pancuronium. Atracurium has been shown to cause mast cell degranulation and histamine release at higher doses, which in turn can lead to peripheral vasodilation and hypotension. Cisatracurium has been shown to cause only minimal mast cell degranulation and subsequent histamine release.<sup>22</sup> The lack of cardiovascular side effects may be explained on the basis that atracurium and cisatracurium are benzylquinolones that are metabolized to hemodynamically inactive metabolites in the plasma by ester hydrolysis and Hofmann elimination. One of the breakdown products of the Hofmann elimination of atracurium, laudanosine, has been associated with CNS stimulation and can precipitate seizures when it accumulates in the plasma.

The pharmacokinetic profiles of atracurium and cisatracurium make these drugs ideal NMBAs for patients with renal and hepatic insufficiency. Recovery from neuromuscular blockade typically occurs in 1 to 2 hours after continuous infusions are stopped. However, long-term use of these drugs can lead to the development of tolerance, which in turn may necessitate significant dosage increases. Additionally, muscle weakness can occur with prolonged use of these types of agents<sup>13</sup> (Case Study 15.4).

## Case Study 15.4

## Patient Case—Neuromuscular Blocking Agent

A 45-year-old man is admitted to the emergency department for injuries sustained from a fall that occurred while he was working to repair the chimney on his house. His admission diagnosis includes a fractured right radius and contusion to his right upper thorax. There is no evidence of head trauma. The patient's respiratory rate is 30 breaths per minute, his blood pressure is 140/85 mm Hg, and his pulse rate is 110 beats/min. The resident on-call physician requests that a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) is administered to accomplish intubation of this patient. Which NMBA would be appropriate for this patient?

#### **SUMMARY**

- Selection of the most appropriate drug for sedating or paralyzing a patient should be based on several criteria, including the patient's condition, the drug's efficacy and safety profile, and the cost of administering the drug over a prolonged period.
- Although historically the selection of sedatives, analgesics, and NMBAs has been based on personal preference, recent clinical practice guidelines have helped define more clearly the most appropriate drugs and strategies for clinicians treating ICU patients with these drugs.
- Sedation is generally prescribed for the treatment of anxiety and agitation and to prevent or at least minimize sleep deprivation.
- The ideal sedative should have a rapid onset, have a relatively short active effect, and be easily titrated. Its effects should be reversible and have minimal, if any, effects on vital organ function
- A common reason for using NMBAs is to alleviate patientventilator asynchrony that cannot be resolved with ventilator adjustment.
- Two classes of NMBAs are available for paralyzing patients on mechanical ventilation: depolarizing muscle relaxants and non-depolarizing muscle relaxants.
- Choosing the most appropriate NMBA depends on the patient's physical condition and the selected drug's onset of action and how fast the patient can recover from its effects once it is discontinued. NMBAs do not possess sedative or analgesic properties and therefore should be used in conjunction with adequate amounts of sedatives and analgesics to ensure patient comfort.
- Maintaining an optimal level of comfort and safety for the patient should be a primary goal when administering sedatives, analgesics, and NMBAs.
