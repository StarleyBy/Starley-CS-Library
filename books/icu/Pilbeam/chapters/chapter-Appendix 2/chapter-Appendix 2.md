# Review of Abnormal Physiological Processes

## MISMATCHING OF PULMONARY PERFUSION AND VENTILATION

Pathological pulmonary conditions can result in loss of perfusion and/or loss of ventilation to various areas of the lung. These abnormal conditions include dead space, intrapulmonary shunt, ventilation/perfusion abnormalities (also called  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  mismatching), and diffusion defects. Fig. B.1 illustrates an extreme case of uneven ventilation and uneven blood flow. Each of these various conditions will be reviewed.

## PHYSIOLOGICAL DEAD SPACE AND ITS CLINICAL MONITORING

Physiological dead space  $(V_D)$  is defined as ventilation of lung areas that are not perfused, resulting in no gas exchange (i.e., ventilation without perfusion). Physiological dead space  $(V_{Dphys})$  is divided into anatomical dead space  $(V_{Danat})$  (Fig. B.2A), which comprises the conductive airways down to the level of the respiratory bronchioles where gas exchange begins; and alveolar dead space  $(V_{Dalv})$ , where alveoli are ventilated but unperfused or underperfused, respectively. Physiological dead space is therefore the sum of the anatomical and alveolar dead space:  $V_{Dphys} = V_{Danat} + V_{Dalv}^{-1}$ 

 $V_{Danat}$  is about 1 mL/lb of ideal body weight (IBW) or about 2 mL/kg of IBW. In an average-sized, 150-lb adult, the anatomical dead space is about 150 mL per breath. In normal healthy individuals, physiological dead space and anatomical dead space are approximately equal and  $V_{Dalv}$  is not significant. Anatomical dead space seldom changes in clinical situations.  $V_{Danat}$  can be lower than normal when an endotracheal tube or a tracheostomy tube is in place, bypassing the upper airway.  $V_D$  can be artificially increased by adding mechanical dead space ( $V_{Dmech}$ ). (This is discussed in more detail later.)

Increased  $V_{Dalv}$  can occur with such conditions as pulmonary thromboemboli, pulmonary vascular injury, pulmonary vascular disorders, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and regional hypotension. Increases in  $V_{Dalv}$  cause  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  mismatching.  $V_{Dalv}$  can produce hypoxemia and hypercarbia. Patients with increased  $V_{Dalv}$  often have the following characteristic findings: normal lung volumes, normal lung mechanics, increased ventilation (hypoxemic response), normal distribution of ventilation in most cases, uneven distribution of capillary blood flow in the lungs, decreased diffusing capacity, hypoxemia, and normal or

increased partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide  $(P_aCO_2)$ . Pulmonary embolism is an example of a classic dead space disorder. Pulmonary embolism reduces pulmonary perfusion without necessarily altering ventilation (see Fig. B.2B).

Patients receiving mechanical ventilation can have increased  $V_{\rm Dalv}$  if high ventilating pressures cause overexpansion of the alveoli, which in turn exerts pressure on adjacent capillaries, reducing effective flow (see Fig. B.2C). Increased  $V_{\rm Dalv}$  also can be present with increased shunting. Suppose a patient had left lower lobe atelectasis. The perfusion to that area would likely be near normal, whereas ventilation to that area would be reduced. This would represent a shunt ( $\dot{Q}$  in excess of  $\dot{V}$ ). If this patient was being mechanically ventilated, the affected lobe might not be as well ventilated as other lung areas. Pressurized gas would favor uncompromised areas, reduce their perfusion, and cause a dead

**Fig. B.1** Extreme cases of uneven ventilation and uneven pulmonary perfusion. *Circles* represent groups of alveoli with their pulmonary capillary blood flow. *Gray areas* represent the conductive airways (anatomical dead space), and *arrows* represent the distribution of ventilation. The alveolus on the left receives all the ventilation but no perfusion, representing an extreme case of alveolar dead space. The alveolus on the right receives all of the blood flow but is not ventilated because of an obstructed airway. This represents an extreme case of intrapulmonary shunt.

**Fig. B.3** Schematic representation of the procedure for measuring inspired partial pressure of  $CO_2$  ( $P_1CO_2$ ), fraction of inspired  $CO_2$  ( $F_1CO_2$ ), partial pressure of  $CO_2$  in the alveolus ( $P_ACO_2$ ), partial pressure of mixed venous  $CO_2$  ( $PVCO_2$ ), mixed expired  $CO_2$  ( $P_ECO_2$ ), and arterial  $PCO_2$  ( $P_aCO_2$ ) for the calculation of  $V_D/V_T$ . See text for further explanation.

space effect to those areas. Thus a combined shunt and dead space condition would exist, as illustrated by the extreme case in Fig. B.1.

If a patient with COPD were given therapeutic oxygen  $(O_2)$ , the  $O_2$  might decrease the pulmonary artery pressure by opening up pulmonary capillaries that were previously constricted because of alveolar hypoxemia. However, these newly opened capillaries would allow blood to flow past unventilated alveoli and thus divert pulmonary blood flow away from areas of better ventilation. The result might cause an increased  $V_{\rm Daly}$ .

For these various reasons, it is beneficial to monitor  $V_D$  in critically ill patients and monitor for changes in  $V_{Dphys}$ . One way is to measure the ratio of dead space to tidal volume  $(V_D/V_T)$ . Normal  $V_D/V_T$  is about 0.25 to 0.40.  $V_D/V_T$  can be calculated from the Enghoff modification of the Bohr equation:

$$\frac{\mathrm{V_{D}}}{\mathrm{V_{T}}} = \left(\mathrm{P_{a}CO_{2}} - \mathrm{P_{E}CO_{2}}\right) / \,\mathrm{P_{a}CO_{2}}$$

where  $P_ECO_2$  is the mixed expired partial pressure of  $CO_2$ ,  $V_D$  is the physiological dead space,  $V_T$  is the tidal volume, and  $P_aCO_2$  is the arterial partial pressure for  $CO_2$ .

Fig. B.3 shows a classic representation of a procedure for determining  $V_{\rm D}/V_{\rm T}$ . In this example:

$$\begin{split} P_{\rm a} CO_2 \, = \, 40 \, mm \, \, Hg, & P_{\rm E} CO_2 \, mm \, \, Hg, \\ V_{\rm T} \, = \, 500, & and \, \, V_{\rm D}/V_{\rm T} \, = \, (40-20)/40 \, = \, 0.50 \end{split}$$

The amount of ventilation that is not involved in gas exchange (unperfused alveoli) is 50%. Because the  $V_T$  is 500 mL, the  $V_D$  will be 0.50  $\times$  500 mL, or 250 mL.

Use of end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring can also be useful in tracking changes in dead space. For example, when a pulmonary embolism occurs, there may be a significant decrease in the end-tidal PCO<sub>2</sub> and an increase in the arterial-to—end-tidal PCO<sub>2</sub> gradient (see Chapter 10). However, this finding by itself is not conclusive evidence of increased  $V_{\text{Dalv}}$  because end-tidal PCO<sub>2</sub> decreases with increased alveolar ventilation  $(\dot{V}_{\rm A})$  and an improvement in  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  matching.

#### Calculation of Mechanical Dead Space Volume Needed to Increase PaCO<sub>2</sub>

$$V_{\text{Dmech}} \,=\, \frac{P_{\text{a}}\text{CO}_{\text{2}}\text{-}P_{\text{a}}\text{CO}_{\text{2}}}{P_{\text{a}}\text{CO}_{\text{2}}\text{-}(P_{\text{a}}\text{CO}_{\text{2}})\text{-}P_{\text{A}}\text{CO}_{\text{2}}} \times (V_{\text{T}}\text{-}V_{\text{Danat}})$$

where  $V_{\mathsf{Dmech}} = \mathsf{mechanical}$  dead space to add

 $P_aCO_2 = actual P_aCO_2$   $P_aCO_2^I = desired P_aCO_2$  $P_ACO_2 = alveolar CO_2$ 

Assume that  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  is normal, then  $P_aCO_2 - P_ACO_2$ 

is <10 mm Hg. Use  $P_aCO_2 - P_ACO_2 = 5$  mm Hg

Example:  $P_aCO_2 = 40 \text{ mm Hg}$ 

 $P_aCO_2 = 30 \text{ mm Hg}$   $V_T = 900 \text{ mL}$  $V_{Danat} = 200 \text{ mL}$ 

$$V_{Dmech} = \frac{40 - 30}{40 - 5} \times (900 - 200) mL$$

Add 200 mL  $V_{Dmech}$  to achieve a  $P_aCO_2=40$  mm Hg. To determine the volume of a length of large-bore corrugated tubing:

- a. Fill the tubing with water and pour it into a graduated cylinder.
- b. Add the  $V_{\mbox{\scriptsize Dmech}}$  between the endotracheal tube and patient circuit Y-connector.
- c. Increase the patient's  $O_2$  percentage slightly to correct for the decreased  $F_lO_2$  brought on by using  $V_{Dmech}$ .

Another technique for determining physiological dead space is to use volumetric capnography, as described in Chapter 10.

## CALCULATION OF MECHANICAL DEAD SPACE VOLUME NEEDED TO INCREASE PaCO<sub>2</sub>

On rare occasions it may be beneficial to increase a patient's  $P_aCO_2$  when hypocapnia is associated with an increase in minute ventilation that cannot be controlled for some reason (see Chapter 6). When adding  $V_{Dmech}$  is desirable, the amount needed can be calculated using the equation in Box B.1. The dead space is added between the endotracheal tube and patient Y-connector on the ventilator circuit.

#### **SOME CAUSES OF HYPOXEMIA**

Changes in the lung that compromise the ability of  $O_2$  to transfer from the alveolus to the pulmonary capillary result in hypoxemia. This hypoxemia results in lower than normal partial pressure of arterial  $O_2$  ( $P_aO_2$ ) and a higher than normal  $P_{(A}-_a)O_2$  owing to one of three general causes: shunt,  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  V abnormalities ( $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  mismatching), and diffusion defects. Each of these is described.

#### Shunt

Shunt is defined as that portion of blood from cardiac output that does not participate in gas exchange with alveolar air, that is, perfusion without ventilation. There are three different types of shunts: anatomical shunt, capillary shunt, and perfusion in excess of ventilation.<sup>2</sup>

![](_page_2_Figure_23.jpeg)

**Fig. B.4** Normal alveolar gas exchange is presented by the exchange of gas between alveolar air (presented by the balloon-shaped alveolus) and the normal alveolar capillary (vessel adjacent to the alveolus). Shunted blood is represented by the blood vessel that is not in contact with the alveolus. Mixed venous  $O_2$  content ( $C_2O_2$ ), alveolar capillary content ( $C_2O_2$ ), arterial  $O_2$  content ( $C_3O_2$ ), cardiac output ( $O_3$ ), and the shunted portion of cardiac output ( $O_3$ ). See text for further explanation. (From Shapiro BA: *Clinical application of blood gases*, Chicago, 1973, Year Book Medical.)

Normal anatomical shunts are present in everyone. They are called *right-to-left shunts* because blood that would ideally return to the right side of the heart (deoxygenated blood) drains into vessels served by the left side of the heart (oxygenated blood). The normal anatomical shunt includes deoxygenated blood from bronchial veins, pleural veins, and thebesian veins, which all drain directly into the left heart (i.e., arterial blood). Normal anatomical shunt represents about 2% to 3% of normal cardiac output. Abnormal anatomical shunts can occur with vascular tumors in the lung or ventricular septal wall defects. In this latter case, blood flows from the right to left side of the heart, bypassing the pulmonary circulation. Any condition in which blood from the systemic circulation flows from the right heart to the left heart without entering the pulmonary circulation is therefore considered an anatomical shunt.

A capillary shunt is the result of blood flowing into the left heart from the pulmonary circulation without passing through ventilated regions of the lung. This intrapulmonary shunting causes hypoxemia that does not respond to  $O_2$  therapy. In other words, there is no significant improvement in  $P_aO_2$  with increases in fractional inspired  $O_2$  ( $F_1O_2$ ) (refractory hypoxemia). Fig. B.4 illustrates an example of a capillary shunt. Even if the partial pressure of alveolar  $O_2$  ( $P_AO_2$ ) is increased with administration of  $O_2$ , the increased  $P_AO_2$  never comes in contact with the shunted blood. Thus shunted blood mixing with normal arterial content results in a lower than normal  $P_aO_2$  and arterial  $O_2$  content ( $C_aO_2$ ).

Intrapulmonary shunts are associated with atelectasis, pulmonary edema, pneumonia, pneumothorax, complete airway obstruction, consolidation of the lung, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and, on rare occasions, arterial-to-venous fistulas. *True shunt* is the sum of anatomical and intrapulmonary capillary shunts.

Perfusion in excess of ventilation causes a *shunt effect*, which is also referred to as *venous admixture*. A shuntlike effect can occur in either poorly ventilated alveolar units that are well perfused or alveolar-capillary units, in which  $O_2$  diffusion is impaired. Blood leaving these poorly ventilated areas is low in  $O_2$ . Thus a shuntlike effect occurs because of a  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  inequality.  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  abnormalities can also cause dead space effects and are complex and variable. (See section on Ventilation/Perfusion Abnormalities for further explanation.)

#### **Calculation of Shunt**

Because cardiopulmonary disorders can cause either dead space or shunt abnormalities, it is important to be able to evaluate each of these characteristic disorders. Dead space has been described previously. Calculation of a pulmonary shunt relies on the Fick equation:

$$\dot{V}O_2 = Q \times (C_aO_2 - CvO_2),$$

which states that the total  $O_2$  consumption  $(\dot{V}O_2)$  expressed in milliliters per minute is equal to the cardiac output  $(\dot{Q}_V)$  expressed in 100 mL/min, multiplied by the arterial-to-venous  $O_2$  content difference  $(C_aO_2-CO_2)$  expressed in milliliters of  $O_2$  divided by 100 mL of blood (vol%).

Fig. B.4 illustrates how the total cardiac output is composed of that portion of cardiac output that participates in gas exchange with alveolar air  $(\dot{Q}_C)$ , and the shunted portion of the cardiac output that does not exchange with alveolar air  $(\dot{Q}_S)$ . <sup>2,3</sup> Calculation of the pulmonary shunt can be determined by the following classic shunt equation (the derivation of the shunt equation is not included in this discussion):

$$\mathrm{Q}\,/\,\mathrm{Q_T} = \left(\mathrm{C_cO_2} - \mathrm{C_aO_2}\right)/\left(\mathrm{C_cO_2} - CvO_2\right)$$

where  $\dot{Q}_S$  is the shunted portion of the cardiac output,  $\dot{Q}_T$  is total cardiac output,  $C_cO_2$  is the content of  $O_2$  of the pulmonary end-capillary after oxygenation of the blood,  $C_aO_2$  is the arterial  $O_2$  content, and  $_2$  is the mixed venous  $O_2$  content (i.e., pulmonary capillary blood before oxygenation).  $C_cO_2$  is calculated on the basis of the assumption that pulmonary end-capillary  $PO_2$  is the same as  $P_AO_2$ . Mixed venous blood can be obtained using a right heart balloon flotation catheter inserted into the pulmonary artery (see Chapter 11).

In many cases, clinicians often use a clinical shunt equation to estimate cardiac output and shunt. This equation, which is derived from the classic shunt equation, uses  $\rm O_2$  pressures rather than  $\rm O_2$  content values. The clinical shunt equation is

$$\dot{Q}_{S} \, / \, \dot{Q}_{T} = \frac{[(P_{A}O_{2} - P_{a}O_{2}) \times 0.003]}{[3.5 + (P_{A}O_{2} - P_{a}O_{2}) \times 0.003]}$$

Alveolar PAO2 is determined by the following equation:

$$\mathrm{P_{A}O_{2}} = \left[\left(\mathrm{F_{I}O_{2}}\right) \times \left(\mathrm{P_{B}} - \mathrm{PH_{2}O}\right)\right] - \left\{\mathrm{P}_{a}\mathrm{CO_{2}} \times \left[\mathrm{F_{I}O_{2}} + \left(1 - \mathrm{F_{I}O_{2}}\right) / \mathrm{R}\right]\right\}$$

where  $P_AO_2$  is the alveolar partial pressure of  $O_2$ ,  $F_IO_2$  is the fraction of inspired  $O_2$ ,  $P_B$  is the barometric pressure,  $PH_2O$  is water vapor pressure (at  $37^{\circ}C=47$  mm Hg), and R is the respiratory quotient ( $R=\dot{V}CO_2/\dot{V}O_2$ ). An R value of 0.8 is commonly substituted in the equation and represents a normal value.

The clinical shunt equation estimates  $O_2$  content by first assuming that the hemoglobin is the same in arterial, capillary, and mixed venous blood. It also assumes that if the  $P_aO_2$  is greater than 150 mm Hg, both the pulmonary and arterial hemoglobin is fully saturated ( $SO_2 = 100\%$ ). The  $PO_2$  of capillary, arterial, and mixed venous  $O_2$  is then multiplied by 0.003, which is the solubility coefficient of  $O_2$ . The equation also assumes that arterial and alveolar  $O_2$  tensions are equal. Because central venous blood samples are not commonly available, the previous equation makes another assumption. It assumes that the a- $O_2$  content difference is normal, if the clinician establishes that the following circumstances are true<sup>1</sup>:

- 1. The patient's cardiovascular status is basically normal (i.e., blood pressure, heart rate, pulse pressure, etc.)
- 2. The metabolic rate is basically normal (i.e., no fever is present and the patient is resting)
- 3. The perfusion is basically normal (i.e., the skin is warm and dry, capillary refill is good, urine output is normal, etc.)

Patients meeting these three criteria will typically have an arterial-to—mixed venous difference of about 3.5%. Thus an average arterial-to—mixed venous  $O_2$  difference of 3.5 is substituted into the equation.

Practitioners have often used the *clinical shunt equation*, assuming it provides useful information for patients on ventilation. However, it has been shown that the equation will be inaccurate at any  $F_IO_2$  because of all the assumptions made in its derivation. In addition, at  $F_IO_2$  values greater than 0.6, the equation will be as much as 10% to 12% inaccurate compared with the classic shunt equation. Clinicians are advised to not make the assumptions used in the clinical shunt equation but to try to determine as much information as possible and accurately apply the classic shunt equation. Other resources are also available for more accurately estimating pulmonary shunt.

#### **Ventilation/Perfusion Abnormalities**

Ideally, ventilation should be perfectly matched with pulmonary perfusion and  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  should be equal to 1.0. However, because of many factors,  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  varies throughout the lung even in normal individuals. Distribution of gas volume (ventilation) varies based on regional differences in resting lung volumes and transpulmonary pressure (i.e., the difference between alveolar and pleural pressures). Ventilation increases (in relation to overall ventilation) from the apex to the base of the lung in the upright individual. Distribution of pulmonary blood is affected primarily by gravity. Pulmonary blood flow also increases (relative to total pulmonary perfusion) from apex to base, and changes in perfusion are more dramatic than changes in ventilation as blood flow progresses toward the bases.  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  is much higher at the top of the lung (i.e., it is about 3.3). Ventilation and perfusion are nearly equal in the middle of the lung (i.e.,  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  is about 1). In the bases of the lungs both ventilation and perfusion are better than at the apex of the lung. In addition, the lung bases are better perfused than ventilated, so the  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  is considerably lower in the bases and equals about 0.66.6

A  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  abnormality ( $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  mismatching) is defined as an abnormal mismatching of gas exchange and pulmonary perfusion. A high  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  indicates that ventilation is greater than normal and perfusion is less than normal, or both. In cases in which a high

**Fig. B.5** The relationship between  $PO_2$  (mm Hg) and  $PCO_2$  (mm Hg) with changes in the ratio of ventilation and perfusion. See text for further explanation. (Redrawn from Deshpande VM, Pilbeam SP, Dixon RJ: *A comprehensive review in respiratory care*, Norwalk, CT, 1988, Appleton & Lange.)

 $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  ratio exists, the  $Po_2$  is higher and the  $Pco_2$  is lower than normal. With a low  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  ratio, ventilation is less than normal and perfusion is greater than normal, or both. With a low  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  ratio, the alveolar  $PO_2$  is lower and the alveolar  $PCO_2$  is higher than normal. The hypoxemia associated with a low  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  ratio (shunt effect) does not respond well to  $O_2$  therapy.

Fig. B.5 graphically illustrates the effect of regional lung changes of the  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  relationship on PO<sub>2</sub> and PCO<sub>2</sub> in the lung. At A of the graph, perfusion is present without ventilation, resulting in PO2 and PCO2 similar to venous blood (PCO2 is about 46 mm Hg, and PO2 is about 40 mm Hg). This represents a pulmonary shunt, and  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  will be zero. At B, perfusion is in excess of ventilation, representing a shunt effect. PO2 in this region of the lung is low. The  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  ratio will equal about 0.4 to 0.5. Many conditions can produce this effect, including hypoventilation, partial airway obstruction (e.g., COPD), and pulmonary interstitial disease. Pulmonary disorders with this type of  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  mismatching are more likely to respond to O2 therapy. Point C represents a normal V/Q relationship of 0.8, resulting in normal PO2 and PCO<sub>2</sub>. Point D illustrates ventilation in excess of perfusion. In this case the excess ventilation does not completely take part in gas exchange, producing a dead space effect. Pulmonary capillary blood from these areas is well oxygenated and may have a CO2 lower than normal (regional hyperventilation).  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  values will be in excess of 1.0. Conditions that might cause this type of  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$ mismatching are positive pressure ventilation and a decreased cardiac output. Point E illustrates ventilation without perfusion and is known as V<sub>Daly</sub>. A classic example of this type of  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$ mismatch is pulmonary embolism, which was described earlier in the section on dead space. With no perfusion, alveolar  $PO_2$  ( $P_AO_2$ ) for a person breathing room air will be about 150 mm Hg and alveolar  $PCO_2$  ( $P_ACO_2$ ) will be zero in affected areas. Resulting exhaled gases will contain lower than normal  $PCO_2$  values.  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  will approach infinity (i.e., 1 divided by 0).

In summary, the adequacy of gas exchange is a sum of the  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  distribution of gas throughout the lung. In general, inadequate ventilation relative to a normal perfusion (low  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  and shunt) has the greatest effect on  $O_2$  uptake by the lung and results in hypoxemia. On the other hand, an excessive amount of ventilation relative to perfusion affects  $CO_2$  elimination and can result in hypercapnia in severe cases.<sup>6</sup>

#### **Diffusion Defects**

A diffusion defect is a pathological condition resulting from impaired gas exchange across the alveolar-capillary membrane causing hypoxemia that is generally responsive to O<sub>2</sub> therapy. Diffusion defects occur through three possible mechanisms: a reduction of alveolar surface area, a thickened alveolar-capillary membrane, or a lower than normal O<sub>2</sub> pressure gradient.

A reduced surface area can occur after surgery in which, for example, a pulmonary lobe is removed (lobectomy). It can also occur in diseases that destroy alveolar tissue, such as emphysema. These structural changes to the lungs are not reversible.

Diffusion defects can occur as a result of an increase in the thickness of the alveolar-capillary membrane, which can occur with pneumonia, pulmonary or interstitial edema, pulmonary fibrosis, or any condition that thickens one or all of the components of the alveolar-capillary membrane.

A lower than normal alveolar-to-arterial  $O_2$  tension gradient usually results from a lower than normal  $P_AO_2$ . It is rare that  $PO_2$  is lower than normal with the exception of individuals residing at high altitudes (e.g., living at feet above sea level). With a low  $P_AO_2$ , the pressure gradient between the alveolus and pulmonary capillary will be lower than normal, thus reducing the rate of gas transfer across the alveolar-capillary membrane.<sup>1,6</sup>
