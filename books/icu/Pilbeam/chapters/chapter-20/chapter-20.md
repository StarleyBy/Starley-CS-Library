#### **WEANING TECHNIQUES**

Patients require mechanical ventilation when their ability to support ventilatory demands is outweighed by a disease process or when the respiratory drive is inadequate to maintain ventilation because of disease or medications (Fig. 20.1). Ventilation can be discontinued after the need for mechanical ventilation has been resolved. This is typically a straightforward maneuver for most patients. The ventilator is simply disconnected from the patient, and the endotracheal tube (ET) is removed. About 80% of patients requiring temporary mechanical ventilation do not require a gradual withdrawal process and can be disconnected within a few hours or days of initial support.<sup>3,4</sup> Examples of this type of temporary ventilation include postoperative ventilatory support for recovery from anesthesia, treatment of uncomplicated drug overdose, and exacerbations of asthma.<sup>3</sup> For patients who have undergone invasive mechanical ventilation for less than a week, discontinuation is typically a quick process. However, for some patients, the process can be lengthy and complex.<sup>5</sup>

The term weaning is frequently used to describe the gradual reduction of ventilatory support from a patient whose condition

**Fig. 20.1** Schematic of the balance between a patient's respiratory capabilities and demands. When demands outweigh capabilities, the balance shifts to the left and a higher level of ventilatory support is needed. As the patient's condition improves, the balance shifts to the right. The clinical challenges are twofold: to recognize when ventilatory assistance is no longer needed and to provide an appropriate level of assistance until that happens.  $C_{LT}$  Compliance of the lungs and thorax;  $R_{aw}$ , airway resistance;  $\dot{V}_A$ , alveolar ventilation;  $\dot{V}CO_2$ , carbon dioxide production;  $\dot{V}_D$ , dead space ventilation;  $\dot{V}CO_2$ , oxygen consumption.

is improving.,4-7 Some practitioners prefer terms such as discontinuation, gradual withdrawal, or liberation. Regardless of the terminology, the process is the same (Key Point 20.1).

Several facts must be taken into consideration if ventilation is to be discontinued successfully. First, patients may require ventilatory support during weaning. Second, supplemental oxygen  $(O_2)$  and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may be required to support oxygenation. Third, some individuals may require maintenance of the artificial airway even after ventilatory support has been discontinued. Fourth, many patients require more than one of these therapeutic interventions. Although each of the first three components mentioned can be treated separately, they are an integral part of the overall process of ventilator discontinuation  $(Box\ 20.1)$ .

Ventilatory support should be discontinued and the artificial airway removed as soon as possible to avoid the risks associated with mechanical ventilation, such as ventilator-induced lung injury, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), airway trauma from the ET, and unnecessary sedation. However, it is important to recognize that premature withdrawal of ventilatory support or of the airway can result in ventilatory muscle fatigue, compromised gas exchange, and loss of airway protection. Premature discontinuation is also associated with a higher mortality rate.

The decision to wean a patient from the ventilator depends on the patient's level of recovery from the medical problems that imposed the need for mechanical ventilation and the patient's overall clinical condition and psychological state. Therefore the patient's physiological capacity and mental and emotional status must be evaluated before an attempt is made to remove the patient from ventilatory support.

#### BOX **20.1**

### Components of Ventilatory Management and Discontinuation

- · Positive pressure ventilation (PPV) to support breathing
- Supplemental O<sub>2</sub> and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to improve oxygenation
- Artificial airway to protect the airway and provide invasive ventilation
- Airway management to maintain clear airways (i.e., suctioning; humidification and warming of inspired air; bronchial hygiene; and aerosolized medications)
- · Therapy directed at the primary disease process

This chapter reviews ventilator techniques used during weaning from ventilatory support, in addition to evidence-based recommendations for determining whether a patient meets the criteria for ventilator discontinuation. A discussion of the process of weaning, clinical conditions that may compromise a patient's ability to be weaned, and the introduction to long-term care when a patient cannot be weaned are also presented.

## METHODS OF TITRATING VENTILATOR SUPPORT DURING WEANING

Ventilatory support can be reduced as a patient becomes increasingly able to resume part of the work of breathing (WOB). Three approaches have been commonly used to reduce ventilatory support and gradually place more of the WOB on the respiratory muscles: intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV), pressure support ventilation (PSV), and T-piece weaning. Until the early 1990s, the three methods were considered equally effective. More recent studies have clearly shown that the weaning process was inordinately prolonged with IMV compared with other weaning techniques. Despite these findings, a substantial number of physicians continue to use IMV to wean patients from mechanical ventilatory support.

In addition to these traditional methods, more sophisticated forms of closed-loop ventilation have been introduced for weaning patients. These include volume-targeted PSV (e.g., volume support), automode, mandatory minute ventilation (MMV), automatic tube compensation, and artificial intelligence systems.

#### **Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation**

Intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) was first introduced in the 1960s as a method to provide ventilation to infants afflicted with idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome. The first IMV systems used to wean adult patients from mechanical ventilation were introduced in the 1970s. Fig. 20.2 shows a diagram of a volume ventilator with an added continuous-flow IMV circuit used for adult patients. A blended gas source is directed into a reservoir bag (3-L anesthetic bag). The IMV circuit connects this reservoir to the ventilator circuit by means of a one-way valve. The one-way valve prevents a positive pressure breath, generated by the machine, from entering the reservoir bag. This system allows a continuous flow of gas from the reservoir bag through the humidifier and the main inspiratory line to the patient. During a positive pressure breath, the high pressure closes the one-way valve, preventing machine air from entering the reservoir bag and allowing the mandatory ventilator breath.

Synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) was later introduced as a method to synchronize a patient's efforts with the mandatory breaths provided by the ventilator during IMV. The theory underlying IMV/SIMV is that the patient's respiratory muscles would work during spontaneous breathing intervals and rest during mandatory breaths. <sup>14</sup> (NOTE: Modern microprocessor ventilators have incorporated this technology into their devices and the term *IMV* is simply used to describe mechanical ventilators that offer either SIMV or IMV.)

A common weaning practice with IMV is to reduce the mandatory rate progressively, usually in steps of 1 or 2 breaths/min and at a pace that matches the patient's improvement. PSV can be added to unload the spontaneous breaths and reduce the patient's WOB through the ventilator system, circuit, and artificial airway, which in turn can help prevent excessive fatigue (Case Study 20.1). Use of pressure support is especially important when the IMV rate is low (i.e., less than 4—6 breaths/min). The level of PSV used during IMV typically ranges from 5 to 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O; the set pressure usually depends on assessment of the spontaneous

#### Case Study 20.1

#### **Evaluation of Weaning Attempt**

A patient who appears to be ready for discontinuation of ventilatory support is being weaned with IMV. The following data indicate the patient's progress. No pressure support ventilation or continuous positive airway pressure is used to support spontaneous breaths.

tidal volume ( $V_T$ ) achieved and the apparent WOB. PEEP of 3 to 5 cm  $H_2O$  is also used to help compensate for changes in functional residual capacity (FRC) associated with the use of an ET and the recumbent position.  $^{15,16}$ 

In reality, the respiratory muscles may perform significant work with both mandatory and spontaneous breaths during IMV (Fig. 20.3). Ventilator asynchrony may occur because the patient's respiratory center does not anticipate whether the next breath from the ventilator will be mandatory or spontaneous.<sup>15</sup> When the

mandatory rate is reduced to the point where it provides 50% or less of the required minute ventilation ( $\mathring{V}_E$ ), the WOB for the patient actually may be as much as when support is withdrawn completely. Consequently the patient's spontaneous respiratory rate (f) may increase significantly. (Additional information on IMV can be found in Chapter 5.)

#### **Pressure Support Ventilation**

With PSV, the patient controls the *f*, timing, and depth of each breath; in other words, PSV is patient triggered, pressure limited, and flow cycled. The sophisticated monitoring and alarm systems available with intensive care unit (ICU) ventilators make this nonvolume-oriented approach a safe and effective mode of weaning. Theoretically, PSV allows the clinician to adjust the ventilatory workload for each spontaneous breath to enhance endurance conditioning of the respiratory muscles without causing fatigue. <sup>17,18</sup>

The most practical method of establishing the level of PSV is to base the initial setting on the patient's measured airway resistance. In general, this is a pressure support level of 5 to 15 cm  $\rm H_2O$  for patients who meet weaning criteria. Another sound approach involves attempting to reestablish the patient's baseline respiratory rate (15–25 breaths/min) and  $\rm V_T$  (300–600 mL/min). An inappropriate pressure support setting can be identified by the presence of respiratory distress, which manifests as tachycardia, hypertension, tachypnea, diaphoresis, paradoxical breathing, respiratory alternans (altering use of the diaphragm to breath and the accessory muscles of respiration), and excessive accessory muscle use.

During weaning with PSV, the clinician gradually reduces the level of support as long as an appropriate spontaneous f and  $V_T$  are maintained and distress is not evident. When pressure support is reduced to about 5 cm  $H_2O$ , the pressure level is not high enough to contribute significantly to ventilatory support. However, this level of support is usually sufficient to overcome the work imposed

**Fig. 20.3** Measurements of flow, volume, airway pressure, and esophageal pressure in a patient ventilated with synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation. The esophageal pressure swings reflect the changes in pleural pressure and are the result of respiratory muscle contraction. These pressure swings are nearly as large during a mandatory breath as during spontaneous breaths.

by the ventilator system (i.e., the resistance of the ET, trigger sensitivity, demand-flow capabilities, and the type of humidifier used). (NOTE: Substantial air leaks [e.g., ventilator circuit leaks, around ET cuffs and chest tubes] can interfere with pressure-supported breath termination.)

#### **T-Piece Weaning**

T-piece weaning is the oldest of the available techniques. It originally involved removing the ventilator from the patient according to a predetermined schedule. The weaning process started when the patient was able to breathe spontaneously for brief periods without ventilatory support and the criteria for weaning had been met (these criteria are discussed later in the chapter). The original T-piece trial followed a schedule that progressively increased the length of time the patient was removed from ventilatory support. For example, the first period might have been 5 to 10 minutes, after which the patient was returned to the ventilator for the remainder of the hour. This process was repeated once an hour. The time off the ventilator was increased gradually until the patient was off the ventilator for 30 minutes and on for 30 minutes. The off time then was increased to 1 hour and so on.

The setup for a T-piece system includes a heated humidifier with a large reservoir. The humidifier is connected to a blended gas source (air/O<sub>2</sub>) that provides a high flow of gas (at least 10 L/min) at the desired fractional inspired O<sub>2</sub> (F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). The humidified gas source is connected to a T-piece (Briggs adapter) with large-bore tubing, which is attached to the patient's ET. Another piece of large-bore tubing is attached to the exhalation side of the T-piece (volume of about 120 mL) to provide a reservoir or, as some clinicians refer to it, an afterburner (Fig. 20.4). 19 If the patient inhales and the gas flow through the tubing from the humidifier is inadequate, some of the patient's inhaled air can be derived from this reservoir and still contain gas at the desired F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Patients are seated or semirecumbent for the procedure and should be continuously monitored by a clinician while disconnected from the ventilator. It is important to recognize that this method of weaning requires a high level of staff attention.

When T-piece weaning is accomplished through the ventilator, the ventilatory mode is set to spontaneous/continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP); that is, the mandatory rate is turned off. The advantage of using the ventilator is the availability of alarms; the disadvantage is that the patient's efforts to breathe through the ventilator system may result in an increased workload. However, current ICU ventilators typically provide a bias flow of gas through the system and flow triggering that supports any spontaneous breaths and reduces the patient's WOB. Basically, this is similar to a small amount of pressure support. Thus the T-piece trial using a

![](_page_4_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Fig. 20.4** Use of an open reservoir to enhance  $O_2$  delivery with a T-piece. When the patient inhales, gas at the set fractional inspired  $O_2$  ( $F_1O_2$ ) is drawn first through the inspiratory side of the circuit from the gas source (A). If the patient's flow demand exceeds the output, gas is inhaled from the open reservoir (B). Only after the reservoir volume is fully emptied by the patient is room air entrained, compromising  $F_1O_2$  delivery. (From Wilkins RL, Stoller JK, Scanlan CL, editors: *Egan's fundamentals of respiratory care*, ed 8, St. Louis, MO, 2003, Mosby.)

ventilator provides a means of continuously monitoring the patient. This approach also provides backup apnea alarms or backup ventilator modes to support patients who become apneic.

Patients less likely to tolerate T-piece weaning include those who have severe underlying heart disease, have severe muscle weakness, or who are inclined to panic because of psychological problems or preexisting chronic lung conditions.

#### **Comparison of Traditional Weaning Methods**

Studies comparing the IMV, PSV, and T-piece weaning techniques have produced conflicting results. <sup>10,12</sup> Each mode offers particular benefits to certain patients. If one procedure does not work well for a patient, another might work. Ventilator discontinuation is best accomplished when expert, caring staff members work with willing, cooperative patients.

## CLOSED-LOOP CONTROL MODES FOR VENTILATOR DISCONTINUATION

In a closed-loop control ventilatory mode, a set variable is compared with a measured control variable. The ventilator uses a feedback signal to adjust the output of the system. Closed-loop modes of ventilation range from simple techniques, such as volume support, to more complex ones, such as **adaptive support ventilation**. Advanced closed-loop control techniques that have been used for weaning include automatic tube compensation (ATC), volume-targeted PSV (e.g., volume support), MMV, adaptive support ventilation (ASV), and an artificial intelligence system for weaning.

#### **Automatic Tube Compensation**

The WOB may increase when a spontaneously breathing patient breathes unaided through an ET.  $^{20\text{-}22}$  The amount of the increase is directly related to the size of the artificial airway and the  $\dot{V}_E$ . Reducing the diameter or increasing the length of the tube increases the resistance to flow, as do kinks in the tube. These factors, coupled with high  $\dot{V}_E$ , increase the spontaneous WOB for the patient (see Chapter 17).

Clinicians often use low levels of pressure support (<10 cm  $\rm H_2O)$  to compensate for the increased resistance and WOB associated with breathing through an ET. $^{21-23}$  However, the clinician must always keep in mind that a fixed pressure, as with PSV, cannot accurately compensate for the variable flow through the ET because inspiratory flow demand can vary.  $^{24}$  Therefore a fixed level of pressure support can result in too little support when inspiratory flow is high or too much support when inspiratory flow is low.  $^{25}$  In fact, PSV can result in excessive  $V_{\rm T}$  and flow, which is uncomfortable for the patient.  $^{26}$ 

To overcome this problem, some ICU ventilators (e.g., Puritan Bennett 840/980 [Medtronics Minimally Invasive Technologies, Minneapolis, MN] and the Dräger Evita XL and V500 [Dräger Medical, Telford, PA]) are equipped with a feature called ATC. ATC was designed specifically to reduce the WOB associated with increased ET resistance. Theoretically ATC delivers exactly the amount of pressure required to overcome the resistive load imposed by the ET for the flow measured at the time. In a sense, this is providing variable PSV with variable inspiratory flow compensation. ATC targets pressure at the tracheal level, adjusting the delivered pressure to try to maintain tracheal pressure at a constant level (Fig. 20.5). Private Technologies, Puritan Bennett 840/980 [Dräger Medical ATC]

**Fig. 20.5** Airway pressure (P<sub>aw</sub>) and tracheal pressure (P<sub>trach</sub>) curves using inspiratory pressure support (*upper graphs*) and automatic tube compensation (ATC) (*lower curves*). Curves on the left are from a patient who had open heart surgery. Curves on the right are from a critically ill patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. *Bottom left*, Note that the ventilator lowers P<sub>aw</sub> during expiration. Control of the expiratory valve keeps P<sub>trach</sub> above or equal to the PEEP. *Bottom right*, Note that the patient with acute respiratory insufficiency using ATC generates an inspiratory flow greater than 2 L/s. This accounts for part of the difference between P<sub>trach</sub> and PEEP. (From Fabry B, Haberthur C, Zappe D, et al.: Breathing pattern and additional work of breathing in spontaneously breathing patients with different ventilatory demands during inspiratory pressure support and automatic tube compensation, *Intensive Care Med* 23:545—552, 1997.)

properties of the artificial airway are known, tracheal pressure changes can be determined by measuring inspiratory and expiratory flows.<sup>29</sup>

ATC functions by using a closed-loop control of the ventilator based on calculated tracheal pressures.<sup>27,30</sup> The pressure delivered to the upper airway during ATC increases by an amount equal to the continuously calculated pressure drop across the ET during inspiration.<sup>29</sup> The pressure change required to maintain the flow for a known resistance can be estimated using the following equation:

$$\Delta P \,=\, R \dot{V}_E$$

where  $\Delta P$  is the pressure change, R is resistance, and  $\dot{V}_E$  is flow. The equation for calculating tracheal pressure is:

 $Tracheal\ pressure = Proximal\ airway\ pressure - \left(Tubeco\ efficient \times Flow^2\right)^{31}$ 

In this equation, the tube coefficient relates to the size of the tube and its imposed resistance. (NOTE: ET resistance is a nonlinear function of flow, especially at higher flows.)<sup>29,32</sup>

To set ATC, the operator selects the ATC function on the ventilator and enters the type of tube (ET or tracheostomy) and the tube size. Some ventilators allow selection of both inspiratory and expiratory ATC. The causes premature closure of unstable airways in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or whether it may, in fact, eliminate dynamic hyperinflation. Further clinical studies are needed to evaluate this issue.

In relation to WOB, ATC may support spontaneous breathing without the overcompensation or undercompensation that occurs with PSV or CPAP. In addition to the benefit of reduced WOB, patients seem to find ATC more comfortable than PSV. The respiratory discomfort in PSV seems to be related to lung

### Potential Advantages of Automatic Tube Compensation

Automatic tube compensation may be useful for the following purposes:

- To support or overcome the work of breathing imposed by the artificial airway during spontaneous breathing by a ventilator-supported patient
- To improve patient—ventilator synchrony through variable compensation of inspiratory flow based on patient demand
- To reduce the risk for air trapping caused by expiratory resistance from the endotracheal tube
- To enhance patient comfort
- To preserve the natural, "noisy" breathing pattern
- To facilitate accurate prediction of readiness for extubation
- To unload the inspiratory muscles and increase alveolar ventilation without adverse cardiopulmonary side effects

overinflation.  $^{26,27,36}$ ) Box 20.2 lists the potential benefits of ATC.  $^{34,37,38}$ 

### Arguments Against the Use of Automatic Tube Compensation

Some clinicians question whether ATC is needed to support a spontaneously breathing, intubated patient. Until a patient's spontaneous  $\dot{V}_E$  exceeds 10 L/min, the effect of the ET may not be significant (see Fig. 17.13). <sup>15,20</sup> A high  $V_E$  is seldom required for an intubated patient who is breathing spontaneously; otherwise, the patient would receive ventilatory support.

When an appropriate-size ET is used, the imposed WOB may not be any greater through the tube than it is through the upper airway once the patient has been extubated. In several studies, ATC was found to be the equivalent of pressure support (5 cm  $\rm H_2O$ ) and CPAP (5 cm  $\rm H_2O$ ) in reducing WOB. In some cases, ATC can give the false impression that the patient is ready to be extubated, when in fact the person is dependent on the support supplied by ATC even though it is minimal. In addition, depending on the ventilator model, ATC may not provide sufficient compensation for WOB imposed by the ET.  $^{32,33}$ 

#### **Summary of Automatic Tube Compensation**

ATC may reduce resistive WOB and increase patient comfort, depending on the ventilator and the artificial airway used. Additional studies are required, however, to determine whether ATC provides all the benefits for which it was designed. Despite the concerns previously mentioned, ATC may represent another method that can be used successfully to extubate patients who are difficult to wean.

#### **Volume-Targeted Pressure Support Ventilation**

Volume-targeted PSV was briefly described in Chapter 6. This mode, which is also called volume support (VS) ventilation on the Servo-i ventilator (Maquet Inc., Wayne, NJ), is basically PSV with a volume target. Volume-targeted PSV provides a set  $V_T$  while using PSV criteria (patient triggered, pressure targeted, flow cycled). Although volume-targeted PSV has the advantage of maintaining a target volume, its value in weaning patients from mechanical ventilatory support has not been established. Furthermore, several drawbacks have been noted with using volume-targeted PSV (see Chapter 17 section on closed-loop ventilation asynchrony).

#### Automode and Variable Pressure Support/ Variable Pressure Control

Automode is available on the Servo-i ventilator. A similar mode, called variable pressure support/variable pressure control (VPS/VPC), is available on the Venturi ventilator (Cardiopulmonary Corp, Milford, CT).

When automode (or VPS/VPC) is activated, the ventilator can switch from a time-triggered mandatory breath to a patienttriggered support breath. For example, if a postoperative patient is still recovering from the effects of anesthesia and the ventilator operator has selected volume-controlled continuous mandatory ventilation with automode as the operating mode, all breaths are mandatory (time triggered, volume limited, and time cycled). If the patient begins to trigger breaths, the ventilator switches to VS (patient triggered, pressure limited, and flow cycled with a volume target) and remains in this mode as long as the patient is breathing spontaneously. If the patient becomes apneic again or if no patient effort is detected within a certain period, the ventilator switches back to the support mode (volume-controlled continuous mandatory ventilation). Automode can also be set to switch from pressure-controlled continuous mandatory ventilation to PSV and from pressure-regulated volume control to VS.

Automode has been shown to be an effective weaning technique that typically requires fewer ventilator manipulations than other techniques (e.g., IMV). $^{43,44}$  Additional clinical studies are needed to evaluate more completely the performance of automode as a weaning technique. $^{34}$ 

#### **Mandatory Minute Ventilation**

MMV was first described in 1977 by Hewlett and colleagues. MMV is available on the Dräger Evita XL ventilator. It is a closed-loop system in which the ventilator monitors set parameters and adjusts accordingly (i.e., the ventilator adjusts the pressure, frequency, or the  $V_T$  to maintain the desired  $\dot{V}_E$ ).

With traditional weaning methods (e.g., IMV and PSV), a constant level of ventilation is not guaranteed. In contrast, MMV automatically increases the level of support if the patient's spontaneous ventilation decreases, thus maintaining a consistent minimum  $\dot{V}_E$ . Patients who regain the ability to breathe spontaneously can increase their own  $\dot{V}_E$ , and the machine automatically lowers support without the clinician having to change any specific ventilator settings. Some of the potential benefits of MMV are listed in Box 20.3.  $^{45,46}$ 

Although few clinical studies address the use of MMV as a weaning technique, several guidelines should be kept in mind. The target  $\dot{V}_E$  is set slightly below the patient's total  $\dot{V}_E$ , which includes both mandatory and spontaneous breaths. If a patient is receiving CMV and is neither hypocapnic nor alkalotic, the  $\dot{V}_E$  can be appropriately set at 80% of the patient's previous level. A lower  $\dot{V}_E$  level (i.e., 75% or less) may be adequate if the patient is slightly alkalotic or hypocapnic. For patients on IMV, setting the  $\dot{V}_E$  at 90% of the mandatory IMV value may be adequate.

A potential problem with MMV is that a rapid, shallow respiratory pattern may provide the preset  $\dot{V}_E$  but in this situation may result in an increase in dead space ventilation. This type of pattern can result from a decrease in compliance associated with pulmonary congestion, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, fibrosis, atelectasis, and pneumonia. It can also be associated with abdominal distention or a decrease in ventilatory muscle strength. As a precaution, the high f and low  $V_T$  alarms must be set appropriately.

Other problems that can occur when using MMV include the development of auto-PEEP, delivery of very high  $V_{\rm T}$  (inappropriately set upper pressure limit), increased dead space ventilation, and inappropriate settings resulting from clinician misunderstanding or misapplication of the mode. Clinicians must be aware of the potential consequences of changing dead space, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) production, and patient WOB. The patient's breathing pattern and gas exchange can vary and therefore must be monitored regularly. Although MMV has been available for three decades, research data on the effectiveness of this mode are still lacking.

### Potential Advantages of Mandatory Minute Ventilation

- Mandatory minute ventilation may offer greater control of a patient's P<sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> than intermittent mandatory ventilation.
- Acute hypoventilation or apnea does not cause sudden hypercapnia.
- Acute hypoventilation is less likely after administration of sedatives, narcotics, or tranquilizers.
- MMV may provide a smooth transition from mechanical ventilatory support to spontaneous ventilation in patients recovering from a drug overdose or anesthesia.

#### **Adaptive Support Ventilation**

ASV is available on the Hamilton G5 ventilator (Hamilton Medical, Bonaduz, Switzerland). Both ASV and its predecessor, adaptive lung ventilation (ALV), were designed to make automatic adjustments from the time ventilation was initiated until ventilation could be discontinued. The technical aspects have been described elsewhere. ASV is a patient-centered method of closed-loop mechanical ventilation that increases or decreases ventilatory support based on monitored patient parameters.

Basically, ASV provides pressure-limited breaths that target a volume and f. The f and  $V_T$  are selected by the ventilator's algorithm to provide the minimum WOB for the patient.<sup>50</sup> ASV monitors variables, such as pressure, flow, inspiratory and expiratory time, compliance, resistance, and time constants, to ensure delivery of an acceptable VE based on practitioner settings. These settings include the patient's ideal body weight, the high-pressure limit, PEEP, F<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, rise time, flow cycle, and percentage of predicted VE desired. ASV is designed to minimize WOB and auto-PEEP. It is worth noticing that ASV has been shown to be an effective ventilator management strategy for a variety of patient situations, including during thoracic surgery.<sup>51</sup> It also has been studied as a strategy for ventilator discontinuation. ASV appears to be as safe and effective as traditional methods of weaning, and it has been suggested that it may find increased use in the future.34

#### **Artificial Intelligence Systems**

This method of weaning patients from ventilatory support relies on artificial intelligence technology. Presently the only commercial system that is available for clinical use is the SmartCare/PS system, which is offered on the Dräger XL and Evita Infinity V500 ventilators. The SmartCare/PS system uses predetermined ranges for volume (V), f, and end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> pressure (PetCO<sub>2</sub>) to adjust the inspiratory pressure automatically to maintain the patient in a respiratory "zone of comfort." The patient's readiness for extubation is based on achieving the predefined lowest level of inspiratory pressure, including the type of artificial airway (i.e., ET vs. tracheostomy tube [TT]), the type of humidifier (i.e., heatmoisture exchange [HME] vs. heated humidifier), and the use of ATC.

Once the lowest level of inspiratory pressure is achieved, a period of observation is initiated during which the patient's  $V_T$ , f, and  $P_{et}CO_2$  are monitored. If the patient successfully passes this modified spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), the system automatically displays a message suggesting that the clinician should consider separating the patient from the ventilator.<sup>23</sup> It has been suggested that this approach to weaning may be a viable alternative because it reduces the duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stays.<sup>56,57</sup> Additional clinical trials will be required to better define the use of these systems.

#### **EVIDENCE-BASED WEANING**

The challenge of successfully liberating a patient from a ventilator has been the subject of considerable debate. Solid evidence on identifying a patient's readiness to wean and ways to accomplish this task remain points of intense discussion among clinicians. In 1999, the federal Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research asked

the McMaster University Outcomes Research Unit to do a comprehensive review of the literature on ventilator withdrawal issues to establish the evidence on which ventilator weaning is based.<sup>58</sup> Using the results of the literature review, a task force of the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP), the Society for Critical Care Medicine (SCCM), and the American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC) created evidence-based guidelines for ventilator weaning for patients requiring more than 24 hours of ventilation.<sup>59</sup> These guidelines (Box 20.4) form the basis for the material presented in the remainder of this chapter. Additional information is provided from a recent clinical practice guideline produced by a collaborative effort between the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the ACCP.60 The ATS/ACCP clinical practice guidelines outline additional evidence-based recommendations to optimize liberation from mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients.

### **EVALUATION OF CLINICAL CRITERIA FOR WEANING**

The following three key points have evolved as criteria for weaning:

- 1. The problem that caused the patient to require ventilation must have been resolved.
- 2. Certain measurable criteria should be assessed to help establish a patient's readiness for discontinuation of ventilation.
- 3. An SBT should be performed to firmly establish readiness for weaning.

### Recommendation 1: Pathology of Ventilator Dependence

Although it is often overlooked, the primary pathological event that led to initiation of ventilatory support must be corrected. The clinician must determine whether this disease process or condition has improved or been reversed. If not, weaning attempts are unlikely to be successful.<sup>59</sup>

The ACCP/SCCM/AARC task force's first recommendation is that a search for all the causes that may be contributing to ventilator dependence should be undertaken for patients who require mechanical ventilation for longer than 24 hours. This recommendation is especially important for patients for whom attempts to be weaned from the ventilator have failed. Reversing all possible ventilator and nonventilator issues is a key part of the ventilator discontinuation process. Box 20.5 provides a summary of factors that must be evaluated to determine a patient's readiness for ventilator disconnection. Even if the disease process or condition that led to mechanical ventilation has improved or has been reversed, other factors must be considered such as the patient's overall medical condition, a physical assessment of cardio-pulmonary reserve and WOB, and the patient's psychological readiness (see Box 20.4).

Box 20.6 lists the clinical factors used to help evaluate a patient's overall condition. Any measured parameter that is out of the normal range may interfere with the patient's ability to breathe spontaneously without ventilatory support. However, occasionally one or more of these criteria may be slightly abnormal and the patient will still be able to support ventilation successfully. This type of situation presents the greatest challenge to clinicians trying to predict whether a patient is ready to be weaned.

BOX **20.4** 

Selected Recommendations From the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP)/American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC)/Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) Evidence-Based Weaning Guidelines Task Force

### Recommendation 1: Pathology of Ventilator Dependence

All factors that may be contributing to ventilator dependence should be identified for patients requiring mechanical ventilation for longer than 24 hours. This is particularly true if attempts to withdraw the mechanical ventilator have failed. Reversing all possible ventilatory and nonventilatory issues is an important part of the ventilator discontinuation process.

### **Recommendation 2: Assessment of Readiness Using Evaluation Criteria**

A formal patient assessment should be performed to determine whether the criteria have been met for discontinuation of ventilation. The following criteria are recommended:

- 1. Evidence of some reversal of the underlying cause of respiratory failure.
- 2. Adequate oxygenation: arterial partial pressure of  $O_2$   $(P_aO_2) \ge 60$  mm Hg with fractional inspired  $O_2$   $(F_lO_2) \le 0.4$ ; ratio of arterial partial pressure of  $O_2$  to fractional inspired  $O_2$   $(P_aO_2/F_lO_2) \ge 150$  to 200 mm Hg; required PEEP  $\le 5$  to 8 cm  $H_2O$ ;  $F_lO_2 \le 0.4$  to 0.5; and hydrogen ion concentration (pH) > 7.25.
- 3. Hemodynamic stability; that is, no clinically important hypotension and no requirement for vasopressors or a requirement only for low-dose vasopressor therapy (e.g., dopamine or dobutamine <5 mcg/kg/min).
- 4. Patient capable of initiating an inspiratory effort.

The decision to use these four criteria must be adapted for each patient. Some patients may not satisfy all the criteria (e.g., patients with chronic hypoxemia below the thresholds cited) but may be ready for attempts at discontinuation of mechanical ventilation.

### Recommendation 3: Assessment During Spontaneous Breathing

Formal discontinuation assessments should be done during spontaneous breathing rather than while the patient receives substantial ventilatory support. An initial brief period of spontaneous breathing can be used to assess the patient's ability to perform a formal spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). The criteria used to assess a patient's tolerance of an SBT are respiratory pattern, adequacy of gas exchange, hemodynamic stability, and subjective comfort. Patients who tolerate an SBT of 30 to 120 minutes should promptly be considered for ventilator discontinuation.

#### **Recommendation 4: Removal of the Artificial Airway**

For patients whose support from the ventilator has been successfully discontinued, the decision regarding removal of the artificial airway should be based on assessment of airway patency and the patient's ability to protect the airway.

#### **Recommendation 5: SBT Failure**

If SBT fails, the causes of the failure and the reasons the patient continues to require ventilatory support should be determined and corrected. Once the reversible causes of failure have been corrected, and if the patient still meets the criteria described in Recommendation 2, an SBT should be performed every 24 hours.

### Recommendation 6: Maintaining Ventilation With SBT Failure

Patients receiving mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure who fail an SBT should receive a stable, nonfatiguing, comfortable form of ventilatory support.

### Recommendation 7: Anesthesia and Sedation Strategies and Protocols

Anesthesia and sedation strategies and ventilator management should be directed toward early extubation for patients who have had surgery.

#### **Recommendation 8: Weaning Protocols**

Protocols for ventilation discontinuation that are designed for clinicians other than physicians should be developed and implemented by intensive care units (ICUs). These protocols should aim to optimize sedation.

#### **Recommendation 9: Role of Tracheostomy in Weaning**

When it becomes apparent that a patient will require prolonged ventilator assistance, tracheotomy should be considered. Tracheotomy should be performed after an initial period of stabilization on the ventilator and when the patient appears likely to benefit from the procedure.

### Recommendation 10: Long-Term Care Facilities for Patients Requiring Prolonged Ventilation

Unless evidence of irreversible disease is present (e.g., high spinal cord injury, advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), a patient who requires prolonged ventilatory support should not be considered permanently ventilator dependent until 3 months of weaning attempts have failed.

#### Recommendation 11: Clinician Familiarity With Long-Term Care Facilities

Critical care practitioners need to be familiar with facilities in their communities or units in their hospital that specialize in managing patients who require prolonged mechanical ventilation. Clinicians need to stay current with peer-reviewed data from long-term ventilation care units.

Patients who fail discontinuation attempts in the ICU should be transferred to long-term ventilation care facilities when they are medically stable. These long-term care facilities should have demonstrated competence, safety, and success in accomplishing ventilator discontinuation. These facilities are characterized by less staffing and less costly monitoring equipment; therefore they generate less cost per patient than do ICUs.

### Recommendation 12: Weaning in Long-Term Ventilation Units

Weaning of a patient who requires prolonged ventilation should be slow paced and include gradual lengthening of SBTs.

#### **BOX 20.5** Evaluation of Systems to Determine Etiology of Respiratory Failure

#### **Neurological Factors**

- · The brainstem (controller) should be structurally sound (e.g., absence of a history of cerebrovascular accident [CVA, also known as stroke] or central apnea).
- No electrolyte disturbances should be present, and no sedatives or narcotics should be required that might affect the function of the brain.
- Peripheral nerve failure may be present as a result of structural or metabolic problems or drug use.
- · Obstructive sleep apnea may be present and is often overlooked.

#### **Respiratory Factors**

- · Weakness of respiratory muscles (e.g., atrophy from lack of use or injury from overuse).
- Presence of neuropathy and myopathy (neuromuscular blocking agents, aminoglycosides, and corticosteroids can contribute to neuropathy and myopathy).
- · Excessive loads may be placed on the ventilatory muscles, possibly as a result of hyperinflation, compliance and resistance changes, and high minute ventilation demands (>10 L/min).
- Increased work of breathing (WOB) increases O<sub>2</sub> consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> production. Failure of withdrawal attempts may be related to capacity/load imbalance. These patients tend to have rapid, shallow breathing patterns.
- Wasted ventilation (increased dead space volume [VD] and arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide [PaCO2]) may be
- · Impaired gas exchange (e.g., ventilation/perfusion imbalances and shunt) may be a factor.

#### **Metabolic Factors and Ventilatory Muscle Function**

- Hypoxic ventilator response and hypercapnic ventilatory response deteriorate under conditions of inadequate nutrition (i.e., semistarvation).
- Overfeeding (i.e., increased carbohydrate load) may lead to increased CO<sub>2</sub> production.
- Electrolyte imbalances, especially phosphate and magnesium deficiencies, are associated with muscle weakness.
- · Severe hypothyroidism and myxedema directly impair diaphragmatic function; adequate O<sub>2</sub> delivery is also essential to this process.

#### **Cardiovascular Factors**

Patients with susceptible reserves may develop ischemia or heart failure when ventilator support is reduced. Possible causes include the following:

- · Increased metabolic demand with increased WOB as the patient transitions from mechanical ventilation to spontaneous
- · Increased venous return with spontaneous ventilation (negative intrathoracic pressure)
- Increased left ventricular afterload imposed by negative pleural pressure swings

#### **Psychological Factors**

- Fear of loss of life support
- Stress
- · Poor ambulation
- Loss of sleep

### BOX **20.6**

#### **Clinical Factors That Aid Evaluation of a** Patient's Overall Condition

- Acid-base balance
- · Anemia or abnormal hemoglobin
- Body temperature
- · Cardiac arrhythmias
- · Caloric depletion (malnutrition or protein loss)
- · Electrolytes
- Exercise tolerance (e.g., up in a chair)
- · Fluid balance
- · Hemodynamic stability (blood pressure, cardiac output, presence of shock)
- Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia
- Infection
- Pain (can be minimized without oversedation)
- Psychological condition
- Renal function
- · Sleep deprivation (an important and often overlooked problem)
- State of consciousness

#### **Weaning Criteria**

When a patient's medical condition is stable and the patient is breathing spontaneously, alert, and cooperative, clinicians typically evaluate certain ventilatory mechanics and gas exchange values to help assess readiness for ventilator discontinuation (see Box 20.4). These values are often called weaning criteria. About 75% of patients who meet certain weaning criteria tolerate an initial SBT in establishing readiness for ventilator discontinuation.<sup>64</sup> It should be mentioned that even among patients who never satisfy weaning criteria, about 30% eventually can be weaned from the ventilator.6

Considerable interest has focused on the establishment of specific, measurable criteria for predicting the success of attempts to wean patients from mechanical ventilation. Table 20.1 lists a number of physiological parameters that can be used for weaning and extubation in adults. However, no single measure has yet been established that is uniformly successful in predicting patient ability to be weaned and to have uncomplicated extubation. An ideal weaning index would involve several parameters and might include the requirements listed in Box 20.7.6

It is interesting to note that 462 potential weaning predictors have been identified. Of those identified, relatively few predictors

have been found to be reasonably consistent as weaning criteria (see Box 20.4). Although these variables provide information about the patient's potential for liberation from the ventilator, assessments made during a formal, carefully monitored 30- to 120-minute SBT may be the most useful guide for making decisions regarding discontinuation of the ventilation (Key Point 20.2).<sup>2</sup>

**Key Point 20.2** A properly monitored spontaneous breathing trial is safe and effective; therefore the other assessments listed under Recommendation 2 (see Box 20.4) and in Table 20.1 may generally be unnecessary.

## Patient Ventilatory Performance and Muscle Strength

For many years several simple measurements have been used to evaluate a patient's ventilatory muscle function before weaning

#### BOX **20.7**

#### Requirements of an Ideal Weaning Index

The ideal weaning index should include the following:

- Assessment of the pathophysiological determinants of weaning outcome, including ventilatory muscle function, pulmonary gas exchange (ventilation and oxygenation), and psychological problems
- Accurately evaluate physiological function as it relates to the degree of abnormality present
- · Ease of measurement and reproducible measurements
- · Minimum patient cooperation
- · High positive and negative predictive values

and extubation. These include vital capacity (VC),  $\dot{V}_E$ , f, spontaneous  $V_T$ , and the rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI). VC has not been shown to be a good predictor for ventilator discontinuation, probably because it requires patient cooperation, which is not always consistent. The f,  $V_T$ , and RSBI can be obtained using a bedside pulmonary function device, a respirometer, or directly through the ventilator. These measurements do not require patient cooperation (see Table 20.1).

The f is easy to count and is a fairly reliable guide to a patient's ability to tolerate a ventilatory load. <sup>67</sup> A spontaneous f greater than 35 breaths/min in an adult indicates that the patient is not ready to be weaned. Evaluation of the pattern of breathing is also valuable. The clinician should review the patient's sedation history when making these measurements because sedatives can alter breathing patterns. <sup>68</sup>

The RSBI is the most frequently studied and one of the more reliable tests for determining a patient's weaning status. It is calculated by dividing the respiratory frequency (in breaths/min) by the  $V_T$  (in liters):  $f/V_T$ . This measurement is taken 1 minute after disconnecting the spontaneously breathing patient from the ventilator and  $O_2$ . Successful weaning is more likely if the RSBI is less than 105 (normal range, 60-105). Values above 105 suggest that a patient is not ready for weaning and probably will fail a weaning trial (Case Study 20.2).  $^{63,69,70}$ 

Measurement of the maximum inspiratory pressure ( $P_{Imax}$  [or MIP]), also called negative inspiratory force (NIF), was described in Chapter 4 (see Fig. 4.2). For the purpose of weaning, this parameter must be measured with a specific technique to ensure consistency.  $P_{Imax}$  is measured in an occluded airway after 20 seconds.<sup>2</sup> (NOTE: The procedure should be stopped if  $O_2$  desaturation or arrhythmias occur.) A specific value of  $P_{Imax}$  that can be used as a predictor of weaning success or failure has not been firmly established. (NOTE: Trending a patient's maximal

Which of the following patients has an RSBI that suggests it is time to begin weaning from ventilatory support? *Patient 1:* Spontaneous  $V_T$  is 0.4 L; f is 10 breaths/min. *Patient 2:* Spontaneous  $V_T$  is 0.25 L; f is 30 breaths/min.

inspiratory force [i.e., MIF] measurements can provide information that can serve as an early indicator of impending respiratory weakness.) The ratio of the inspiratory pressure to  $P_{Imax}$  and the ratio of the airway occlusion pressure to  $P_{Imax}$  may provide other valuable weaning tools, but further study of these parameters is needed.  $^{63,71-73}$ 

#### **Measurement of Drive to Breathe**

The inspiratory drive to breathe is established by measurement of the airway occlusion pressure ( $P_{0.1}$  [or  $P_{100}$ ]). The  $P_{0.1}$  can be measured by adding special valve systems to a ventilator system; it is available on some ICU ventilators, such as the Dräger Evita Infinity V500 (Dräger Medical, Telford, PA).

To obtain the  $P_{0.1}$ , the airway is occluded during the first 100 msec of inspiration and the pressure at the upper airway is measured (Fig. 20.6). The  $P_{0.1}$  is thought to reflect both the drive to breathe and ventilatory muscle strength.<sup>2</sup> The normal range is 0 to -2 cm  $H_2O$ .

 $P_{0.1}$  is reported as an absolute value even though the pressure generated is below baseline. A value close to normal may indicate that the patient is breathing comfortably. However, a low value may indicate either a weak drive to breathe or muscle weakness, which are not good indicators for readiness to wean. Values below  $-6~{\rm cm}~{\rm H}_2{\rm O}$  may indicate a high drive to breathe and suggest that weaning is not likely to succeed. High occlusion pressures may indicate that the patient is uncomfortable. A high drive to breathe in these situations could lead to fatigue during a ventilator withdrawal challenge. On the other hand, a high  $P_{0.1}$  may reflect strong respiratory muscles and a vigorous respiratory drive, which are advantageous if the patient has an intact drive to breathe. Additional studies will be required to evaluate the effectiveness of  $P_{0.1}$  as a predictor of weaning success.

#### **Work of Breathing**

When a patient has received total ventilatory support for several days or weeks, the respiratory muscles may become weak from lack of use. Patients may also be undernourished. As with any other skeletal muscles, lack of nutrition weakens the diaphragm. Proper nutrition is therefore essential for maintaining respiratory

**Fig. 20.6** Graphic representation of pressure on inspiration measured at 100 milliseconds ( $P_{0,1}$ ). The airway is occluded after patient inspiration. Pressure at the mouth is measured at 100 msec, and the airway is then opened. The upper airway pressure at 100 msec is the  $P_{0,1}$  value, reported as an absolute number.

### BOX **20.8**

### Physical Signs and Measurements of Increased Work of Breathing

- Use of accessory muscles
- Asynchronous breathing (chest wall—diaphragm asynchrony)
- Nasal flaring
- Diaphoresis
- Anxiety
- Tachypnea
- · Substernal and intercostal retractions
- · Patient asynchronous with ventilator
- Measured WOB >1.8 kg/m/min or >0.8 J/L
- Measured WOB ≥15% of total O<sub>2</sub> consumption

muscle strength and ensuring successful weaning from the ventilator.

The WOB and ventilatory muscle fatigue are both important aspects of ventilator dependency. Unfortunately, a universally accepted normal value for the WOB has not been identified as a predictor of weaning success. In addition, measurement of WOB requires a great deal of expertise and can be both invasive and costly. <sup>2,77,78</sup> Box 20.8 lists signs and measures indicating a high WOB. <sup>78</sup>

Previously mentioned parameters, such as spontaneous f and the  $f/V_T$  ratio, allow the clinician to gauge a patient's spontaneous WOB. Less obvious contributors to an increased WOB are a high  $O_2$  cost of breathing, an elevated metabolic rate (high  $CO_2$  production  $[\dot{V}CO_2]$ ), a high ratio of dead space to tidal volume  $(V_D/V_T)$  ( $\geq 0.6$ ), high airway resistance  $(R_{aw})$ , and stiff lungs (low respiratory system compliance).<sup>79</sup> The first three factors require special equipment and are difficult to measure. These parameters are seldom used by clinicians because they require too much respiratory work for a patient to maintain for an extended period (Key Point 20.3).<sup>2,59</sup>

**Key Point 20.3** "More complex weaning parameters focused on physiological measurements, such as muscle strength, respiratory system mechanics, metabolic parameters, and work of breathing, add little to the assessment of individual patients for discontinuation potential." <sup>59</sup>

The index that evaluates compliance, respiratory rate, oxygenation, and inspiratory pressure (CROP index) may provide a good assessment of potential respiratory muscle overload and fatigue. The CROP index is calculated as follows:

$$\frac{\text{CROP} = (\text{CD} \times \text{P}_{\text{Imax}} \times [\text{P}_{\text{a}}\text{O}_{\text{2}}/\text{P}_{\text{A}}\text{O}_{\text{2}}])}{f}$$

where  $C_D$  is dynamic compliance,  $P_{Imax}$  is the maximum inspiratory pressure,  $P_aO_2$  is the arterial partial pressure of  $O_2$ ,  $P_AO_2$  is the alveolar partial pressure of  $O_2$ , and f is the respiratory rate. CROP values above 13 indicate the likelihood of successful ventilator withdrawal.<sup>2</sup>

#### **Adequacy of Oxygenation**

Invasive mechanical ventilation is rarely used specifically to treat hypoxemia. The notable exception to this is ventilation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (see Chapter 13). If a patient receiving mechanical ventilation requires a high F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and a high level of PEEP and has low arterial O2 levels, the underlying pulmonary disease that caused the need for ventilation probably has not resolved sufficiently to allow the patient to breathe without assistance. Several oxygenation parameters can be used to determine whether the underlying disease has resolved; these include the P<sub>a</sub>O<sub>2</sub>; the ratio of the arterial O<sub>2</sub> partial pressure to the fraction of inspired O<sub>2</sub> (P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/F<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub>); the ratio of arterial to alveolar O<sub>2</sub> partial pressure (PaO2/PAO2); shunt; and the alveolar-to-arterial  $O_2$  partial pressure  $(P_{(A-a)}O_2)$  (see Table 20.1).<sup>78</sup> Hemoglobin levels must also be sufficient to ensure that O2 transport is adequate before weaning. Assessment of the patient's hemodynamic status (e.g., blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac index [CI]) is an important part of the evaluation process.

### Recommendation 2: Assessment of Readiness for Weaning Using Evaluation Criteria

The ACCP/SCCM/AARC Task Force's Recommendation 2 states that a formal assessment of the patient should be performed to determine whether the criteria have been met for discontinuation of ventilation. Specific criteria for determining weaning readiness are listed in Box 20.4 and Table 20.1.

### Recommendation 3: Assessment During a Spontaneous Breathing Trial

Perhaps the best approach to determining a patient's readiness to wean is a carefully supervised SBT.<sup>1,2</sup> As stated under Recommendation 3 (see Box 20.4), a formal assessment is made during spontaneous breathing rather than while the patient is mechanically ventilated. An initial SBT is typically conducted when the basic assessment findings suggest that the patient is ready to be weaned, but the clinician nonetheless is uncertain about the patient's ability to sustain breathing without mechanical support. The patient is allowed to breathe spontaneously for a few minutes to determine his or her ability to perform a more extended SBT. This initial effort is considered a screening phase and is usually conducted before a decision is made to continue an SBT.

During the SBT the patient's ability to tolerate unsupported ventilation is determined by observing his or her respiratory pattern, adequacy of gas exchange, hemodynamic stability, and subjective comfort (see the next section). A patient is considered ready for ventilator discontinuation and assessment for extubation when the person can tolerate an SBT for 30 to 120 minutes (Key Point 20.4). Studies have demonstrated that 77% to 85% of patients who pass an SBT can be successfully weaned and extubated without requiring reintubation. <sup>59,63,80,81</sup>

**Key Point 20.4** "The best indicator of ventilator discontinuation potential is the clinical assessment of patients during the 30- to 120-minute spontaneous breathing trial (e.g., respiratory rate, blood pressure, heart rate, comfort/anxiety, oxygenation,  $S_0O_2$ )." <sup>59</sup>

SBTs typically last at least 30 minutes but not longer than 120 minutes. <sup>1,2,80</sup> The SBT can be accomplished using a low level

of CPAP (e.g., 5 cm  $\rm H_2O$ ), a low level of PSV (e.g., 5–8 cm  $\rm H_2O$ ), ATC, or simply a T-piece. <sup>81,82</sup> Although all these techniques have been shown to be effective for SBTs, it has been suggested that low levels of PSV shorten the length of time on the ventilator and ICU stays compared with a T-tube trial. <sup>83</sup>

The SBT is well established as a key index of a patient's ability to wean from the ventilator and of successful extubation. Studies have shown that successful completion of an SBT reduces ventilatory time, and therefore the cost of patient care, compared with cases in which the 2-hour SBT was not performed. Close monitoring of patients undergoing an SBT is critical. Unnecessary prolongation of a failed SBT can result in muscle fatigue, hemodynamic instability, discomfort, or worsening gas exchange. There are no studies suggesting that SBTs contribute to any adverse outcomes if the trial is terminated promptly when signs of failure are recognized. In short, the patient should not be allowed to experience extreme exhaustion during the trial.

A variety of signs, symptoms, and monitored parameters allow clinicians to evaluate patients during the SBT. Patients who are not tolerating the process may show signs of dyspnea, fatigue, pain, anxiety, diaphoresis, pallor or cyanosis, drowsiness, restlessness, or use of accessory muscles. Box 20.9 lists clinical signs and symptoms that should be monitored during an SBT. These physical findings provide evidence that some underlying problem is preventing a successful weaning process.

### Recommendation 4: Removal of the Artificial Airway

When a patient can breathe spontaneously (i.e., has performed an SBT successfully) and ventilator support has been discontinued, a decision must be made about removal of the artificial airway. This decision is based on assessment of airway patency and the patient's ability to protect the airway.<sup>59</sup>

### BOX **20.9**

#### Clinical Signs and Symptoms Indicating Problems During a Spontaneous Breathing Trial

- Respiratory rate exceeding 30 to 35 breaths/min (clinicians also should watch for increases of more than 10 breaths/ min or fewer than 8 breaths/min).
- 2. Tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>) decreasing below 250 to 300 mL.
- 3. Blood pressure changing significantly, as demonstrated by:
  - A drop of 20 mm Hg systolic or
  - A rise of 30 mm Hg systolic or
  - Systolic values above 180 mm Hg or
  - A change of 10 mm Hg diastolic (e.g., rise >90 mm Hg)
- 4. Heart rate increasing more than 20% or exceeds 140 beats/min.
- 5. Sudden onset of frequent premature ventricular contractions (more than 4–6/min).
- 6. Diaphoresis.
- Clinical signs that indicate deterioration of the patient's condition or that demonstrate the patient is anxious, not ready for weaning, and must be returned to ventilatory support.
- Deterioration of arterial blood gas values and O<sub>2</sub> saturation measured by pulse oximeter (S<sub>D</sub>O<sub>2</sub>).

Some practitioners equate ventilator liberation with extubation, which adds to the confusion of defining terms with regard to readiness for discontinuation of ventilation versus readiness for extubation. In most cases, discontinuation of ventilatory support and extubation are a single process. However, in some cases, such as a patient with upper airway burns or one with copious secretions and a weak cough, the artificial airway may need to be maintained for an extended period after discontinuation of mechanical ventilatory support.

Common risks associated with extubation include potential airway obstruction, aspiration, and inability to clear secretions. Successful extubation is likely if a patient has a strong cough and is able to mobilize secretions, does not have excessive secretions, and has a peritubular leak on cuff deflation (successful cuff leak test).<sup>86</sup>

The cuff leak test is a means of testing for postextubation airway patency. Note that to qualify for this test, the patient must no longer need ventilatory support. To perform this test, the patient is disconnected from the ventilator, the cuff is deflated, and the ET or TT is obstructed. A leak around the cuff (peritubular leak) during spontaneous breathing suggests that the airway caliber is adequate and successful extubation is likely. A leak of less than 110 mL (average of three values on six consecutive breaths) indicates a high risk for postextubation stridor. Recent guidelines suggest initiation of treatment with systemic steroids at least 4 hours before extubation is indicated for patients who fail the cuff leak test but otherwise are ready for extubation. It is important to recognize that a successful cuff leak test does not guarantee that postextubation difficulties will not arise. Patients without such leaks, however, must be watched more closely.

Some clinicians are concerned that their extubation attempts might have a high rate of failure and require reintubation. Reported reintubation rates range from as low 4% to as high as 33%. Higher reintubation rates are more common in patients who demonstrate mental status changes and neurological impairment. An acceptable reintubation rate has not been determined. A low reintubation rate (5%) might suggest that clinicians are too conservative in their attempts at extubation and overly exacting in their use of extubation criteria; this gives rise to the risks associated with prolonged intubation (e.g., VAPs, ventilator-induced lung injury, damage to the airway). Conversely, a high percentage of extubation failure (>30%) might indicate that clinicians are too aggressive and too liberal with extubation criteria; this presents the risks associated with reintubation. It has been suggested that an extubation failure rate of 10% to 19% may be clinically acceptable.<sup>62</sup> Box 20.10 lists some of the factors that contribute to extubation failure.

Reintubation is marked by an eightfold higher risk for the development of nosocomial pneumonia and a 6-fold to 12-fold increase in the mortality rate. <sup>55,80,91,92</sup> The risks of continued use of an artificial airway must be weighed against the risks for extubation and its possible failure (Key Point 20.5). Interestingly, up to 80% of patients who intentionally self-extubate do not require reintubation. <sup>62</sup>

**Key Point 20.5** Clinicians are often reluctant to remove an ET for fear of having to reintubate the patient.

Box 20.11 briefly outlines the extubation procedure and lists the required equipment. Box 20.12 summarizes some of the key

### BOX **20.10**

### Factors That May Contribute to Extubation Failure

- Type of patient (i.e., medical vs. surgical)
- Older age

- Duration of mechanical ventilation
- · Female gender
- Anemia (hemoglobin <10 mg/dL or hematocrit <30%)</li>
- · Need for transport out of the intensive care unit

- Protocol-directed weaning

points of the AARC Clinical Practice Guideline for removal of the ET. 96 Table 20.1 provides a list of physiological parameters that can be used to assess readiness for extubation.

#### **Postextubation Difficulties**

Hoarseness, sore throat, and cough are common after extubation. Other postextubation problems include subglottic edema, increased WOB from secretions, airway obstruction, and post-extubation laryngospasm.<sup>65</sup>

Postextubation glottal edema can result in partial airway obstruction, causing stridor. This potentially serious condition is commonly treated with a cool aerosol supplemented with O<sub>2</sub> and nebulized racemic epinephrine (0.5 mL, 2.25% epinephrine in 3 mL normal saline). Helium-oxygen mixtures (e.g., 70% He/30% O<sub>2</sub>), administered through a nonrebreathing mask, also reduce WOB through the partly obstructed airway. This technique, known as heliox therapy, provides a low-density gas that may aid spontaneous breathing, thus relieving the effects of stridor and temporarily supporting gas exchange. This may allow time for medical treatment (e.g., racemic epinephrine and steroids) to take effect and prevent reintubation.<sup>97</sup> Reintubation may be necessary to prevent the development of respiratory distress if postextubation edema and stridor are severe and refractory to treatment.

Postextubation laryngospasm may occur and is usually transient. Persistent laryngospasm may respond to positive pressure delivered with  $O_2$  (e.g., bag-mask device). If it continues, a neuromuscular blocking agent and reintubation may be necessary.  $^{91}$ 

The risk for aspiration is another potential problem after extubation. Aspiration is associated with an inability to protect the airway, and it is not unusual in patients with central neurological injury. (NOTE: In patients who have a neuromuscular or spinal cord injury, a peak cough flow greater than 160 L/min may predict successful extubation or decannulation [removal of the TT].)<sup>1,59</sup> Other factors that may increase the risk for aspiration after extubation include the following:

 Use of muscle relaxants (may also impair the ability to protect the airway)

#### **BOX 20.11** Extubation Equipment and Procedure

#### **Equipment**

- Electrocardiogram monitor
- Resuscitation bag, O<sub>2</sub> source, and O<sub>2</sub> mask
- Suctioning equipment, including suction kits and Yankauer
- Laryngoscope and additional endotracheal tubes for intubation (if necessary)
- · Racemic epinephrine and a small-volume nebulizer (in case postextubation stridor develops)
- A 5-mL unit dose of normal saline or 5-mL syringe for irrigation with normal saline during suctioning (if necessary)
- 10-mL syringe for deflating endotracheal (ET) tube cuff

- Position the patient in semi-Fowler or high Fowler position.
- Explain the procedure to the patient.
- Administer 100% O<sub>2</sub> to the patient with a manual resuscitation bag.
- Suction the patient's mouth and pharynx above the cuff. Oxygenate after suctioning.
- Suction the patient to clear the airway as much as possible, and then loosen the tape supporting the tube.
- · Squeeze the resuscitation bag while deflating the cuff to force secretions into the mouth from above the cuff for suctioning (some clinicians cut the pilot balloon). Having the patient cough also helps move the secretions into the mouth.
- · Oxygenate and hyperinflate the patient, withdrawing the ET tube when pressure is built up in the lungs at peak inspiration (maximum abduction of vocal cords). An alternative technique is to have the patient breathe in deeply and cough; the tube is removed as the patient coughs (coughing opens the vocal cords). A deep inspiration before cuff deflation, followed by a cough, also helps force secretions into the mouth.
- Have the patient cough after the tube has been removed.
- Administer the same fraction of inspired O<sub>2</sub> (F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) as before extubation. Some clinicians administer a cool mist after extubation and increase O2 delivery by 10% if the patient was weaned with PEEP in use.
- · Monitor the patient while encouraging coughing and deep breathing. Listen to the breath sounds, particularly in the neck area. Frequently measure the respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, and O<sub>2</sub> saturation by pulse oximeter  $(S_pO_2)$  for 30 minutes.
- · Monitor the patient for changes over the next hour. It may be desirable to obtain an arterial blood gas measurement at this time to confirm that the patient's oxygenation and ventilatory status is stable.
- · Presence of a gastric tube (feedings tubes must be discontinued for hours before extubation)
- · Abnormal paraglottic sensations (usually begin hours after extubation and can last as long as 8 hours after extubation)
- Inability to close the glottis mechanically (may be impaired after extubation)<sup>7</sup>
- Excessive amounts of secretions (e.g., cystic fibrosis)
- Inability to clear secretions effectively (e.g., inadequate neurological or muscular function)

#### Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation After **Extubation**

Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV) may be beneficial after extubation for patients who require some degree of ventilatory support to ease the transition from invasive mechanical ventilation to spontaneous breathing. NIV after extubation appears to have the following benefits 98-103:

- Improves survival
- Lowers the mortality rate
- Reduces the risk for VAP
- Lowers the incidence of septic shock
- Shortens the ICU and hospital stays

Box 20.13 lists potential criteria for the use of NIV after extubation for patients requiring transitional ventilator support. NIV can be administered temporarily for postextubation subglottic edema to give medications that reduce swelling (e.g., corticosteroids) time to take effect. It may also be useful for preventing reintubation when respiratory failure occurs after extubation.<sup>103</sup> However, patient cooperation is essential for successful use of this modality. Unfortunately, NIV tolerance cannot be safely predicted before extubation; therefore deliberate removal of the airway with the intent to switch to NIV carries a high risk for reintubation. (See Chapter 19 for additional information on NIV.)

#### **FACTORS IN WEANING FAILURE**

#### **Recommendation 5: Spontaneous Breathing Trial Failure**

As previously mentioned, if a patient fails an SBT, the causes of the failure must be determined and corrected before proceeding with liberation from mechanical ventilation. When the reversible causes of failure have been corrected, and if the patient still meets the criteria for discontinuation of ventilation, an SBT should be performed every 24 hours.<sup>59</sup> It is important to avoid pushing patients to the point of exhaustion during the weaning process because this ultimately can delay liberation from the ventilator. A failed SBT often reflects persistent mechanical abnormalities of the respiratory system, which may not reverse quickly.<sup>77</sup> Other causes or complications may be involved, such as compromised cardiovascular function (e.g., myocardial ischemia), impaired fluid status, acid-base disturbances, inadequate pain control, inappropriate sedation, the need for bronchodilator therapy, nutritional status, and psychological factors.

It is important that clinicians wait 24 hours before attempting another SBT in patients for whom it fails (Key Point 20.6). Frequent SBTs over a single day are not helpful and can lead to serious consequences. Even twice-daily SBTs offer no advantage over testing once a day.10

**New Point 20.6** Clinicians should wait 24 hours before attempting subsequent spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) in patients for whom SBT fails.

#### **NONRESPIRATORY FACTORS THAT MAY COMPLICATE WEANING**

The respiratory problems that can lead to unsuccessful weaning attempts are similar to those that often lead to respiratory failure

BOX 20.12 Summary of the American Association for Respiratory Care Clinical Practice Guideline: Removal of the Endotracheal Tube—2007 Revision and Update

#### **Indications**

- When airway control provided by the endotracheal (ET) tube is no longer necessary (the patient should be able to maintain a patent airway and generate adequate spontaneous ventilation to maintain normal gas exchange).
- When an acute obstruction of the ET tube cannot be cleared rapidly. Reintubation or other appropriate techniques must be used to maintain effective gas exchange.
- When further medical care of the patient is explicitly declared futile (tube removal is allowed).

#### Contraindications

· No absolute contraindications to removal of the ET tube have been reported.

#### **Hazards/Complications**

 Possible hazards and complications include hypoxemia and hypercapnia from airway obstruction, resulting from edema of the trachea, vocal cords, or larynx, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, aspiration, respiratory muscle weakness, hypoventilation, excessive work of breathing, development of atelectasis, and postextubation pulmonary edema.

#### **Limitations of Methodology**

· Predicting an extubation outcome is sometimes difficult. It is of significant clinical importance because both extubation delay and unsuccessful extubation are associated with poor patient outcomes. The literature on extubation readiness is limited by few validated objective measures to accurately predict the extubation outcome for an individual patient.

#### **Assessment of Extubation Readiness**

• Patients should be able to maintain spontaneous ventilation adequately and should not require high levels of positive pressure or oxygenation to maintain adequate arterial blood gas oxygenation  $(P_aO_2/F_1O_2 > \text{ on an } F_1O_2 \text{ of } < 0.4-0.5$ and low levels of PEEP <5-8 cm  $H_2O$ ; pH >7.25).

- Successful completion of 30- to 120-minute SBT performed with a low level of CPAP (e.g., 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) or a low level of pressure support (5-7 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) demonstrating adequate respiratory pattern and gas exchange.
- Other examples of measurements that can be used to assess extubation readiness include spontaneous respiratory rate, RSBI, vital capacity (VC), peak expiratory flow (PEF), transdiaphragmatic pressure gradient (Pdi), maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP), work of breathing (WOB), airway occlusion pressure (P<sub>0.1</sub>), maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV), and sustained maximal inspiratory pressures (SMIP).
- Adequate respiratory muscle strength.
- Patients with artificial airways in place to facilitate treatment of respiratory failure should be considered for extubation when they have met weaning criteria.

#### Assessment of Outcome

- Patient assessment and a physical examination should follow removal of the ET tube to ensure adequate spontaneous ventilation and adequate oxygenation through the natural airway and to ensure that reintubation is not necessary.
- Some patients may require postextubation support or intervention to maintain adequate gas exchange independent of controlled mechanical ventilation. These adjunctive measures may include noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, CPAP, aerosolized racemic epinephrine, heliox, and possibly diagnostic bronchoscopy.

#### **Monitoring**

- Appropriately trained personnel.
- Frequent evaluation of vital signs, assessment of neurological status, patency of airway, auscultatory findings, WOB, and hemodynamic status.

**BOX 20.13** Criteria for Instituting Noninvasive Ventilation After Failure to Wean From **Invasive Mechanical Ventilation in Extubated Patients** 

- · Resolution of problems leading to respiratory failure
- · Ability to tolerate a spontaneous breathing trial for 10 to 15 minutes
- Strong cough reflex
- · Hemodynamic stability
- Minimal airway secretions
- Low F<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub> requirements
- · Functioning gastrointestinal tract
- Optimum nutritional status

(see Fig. 20.1). Nonrespiratory factors also may contribute to failure of the SBT and are often neglected (Table 20.2).<sup>97</sup> The following sections review the common nonrespiratory factors that can delay or even prevent successful weaning of a patient from mechanical ventilation.

#### **Cardiac Factors**

Patients with abnormal cardiac function may develop acute congestive heart failure when abruptly disconnected from mechanical ventilation. The rapid drop in intrathoracic pressures causes two basic problems: sudden increases in negative intrapleural pressure with spontaneous breaths may increase the left ventricular transmural pressure and afterload and temporary redistribution of blood volume from the systemic venous system to the central veins, which can result in increased right, and subsequently left, ventricular filling. The increased venous return may alter the function and shape of the right and left ventricles, impair left ventricular function, and reduce the stroke volume.<sup>97</sup> With a preexisting heart condition, these acute changes can result in cardiac decompensation, thus contributing to problems in weaning (Case Study 20.3).

#### Case Study 20.3

#### **Failed Weaning Attempt**

A 76-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has been receiving ventilatory support for 4 days after an acute myocardial infarction. The ventilator settings are  $V_T$  500 mL, IMV rate 8 breaths/min,  $F_IO_2$  0.5, and PEEP/CPAP 5 cm  $H_2O$ . ABG results on these settings are pH 7.37,  $P_aCO_2$  36 mm Hg,  $P_aO_2$  78 mm Hg, and  $S_pO_2$  93%.

The patient currently meets all criteria for weaning and is placed on a T-piece. Within 10 minutes he develops restlessness, tachycardia, rapid, shallow breathing, and diaphoresis. The  $S_pO_2$  drops from 93% to 90%, and the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure rises from 12 to 17 mm Hg. The patient does not complain of chest pain and has no dysrhythmias.

What do you think is responsible for the failed weaning attempt?

#### **Acid-Base Factors**

A common reason that patients with chronic hypercapnia fail to wean is the presence of relative hyperventilation, respiratory alkalosis, and subsequent renal compensation, leading to a decrease in bicarbonate. Table 20.3 presents an example of this situation. As the table shows, after 3 days of mechanical ventilation, the blood gas values appear normal. However, these results are not normal for this patient. The original state of compensated respiratory acidosis must be restored in 2 to 3 days by gradually reducing ventilatory support before weaning can succeed in this patient.

Even patients without preexisting chronic  $CO_2$  retention can hyperventilate during controlled ventilation. When weaning is attempted, these patients remain apneic until  $CO_2$  levels rise high enough to trigger the respiratory drive. Consequently, maintaining a respiratory alkalosis in this type of patient can severely delay the weaning process.

Patients with metabolic acidosis may also not do well during weaning unless the underlying cause of the acidosis is removed. The normal compensatory mechanism for a metabolic acidosis is a respiratory alkalosis (i.e., increased ventilation). Without the ventilator to help support this increased work, the patient is unable to maintain increased  $\dot{V}_E$  and may not do well during weaning.

#### **Metabolic Factors**

Besides metabolic acidosis, three additional metabolic factors can affect ventilator weaning: hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypothyroidism. Hypophosphatemia, or phosphate deficiency, may contribute to muscle weakness and failure to wean. Values below normal (1.2 mmol/L) may impair respiratory muscle function.

Malnourished patients and those with chronic alcoholism often suffer from hypomagnesemia (low magnesium levels). Magnesium deficiency has also been associated with muscle weakness.

Patients with severe hypothyroidism may have impaired respiratory muscle function. This disorder also blunts the central response to hypercapnia and hypoxemia, which in turn may impair a patient's ability to wean.<sup>97</sup>

#### **Effect of Pharmacological Agents**

As discussed earlier in Chapter 15, the use of sedatives, opioids, tranquilizers, and hypnotic agents can all depress the central ventilatory drive. Use of these agents must be minimized for weaning to be successful. Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) (e.g., vecuronium bromide and atracurium besylate) cause paralysis and must clear the system before weaning can be initiated. Indeed, some patients demonstrate prolonged paralysis even after use of these agents is discontinued. The two primary reasons for prolonged paralysis after withdrawal of NMBAs are a reduced ability to metabolize and excrete these drugs and the development of an acute myopathy. In the former case, prolonged paralysis occurs as a result of interference with the normal renal or hepatic metabolism and elimination of the NMBAs. Prolonged paralysis occurs in severely ill patients with multiple organ failure secondary to critical illness, especially sepsis. 104 An acute myopathy can develop when high maintenance doses of corticosteroids and continuous nondepolarizing agents (e.g., vecuronium or pancuronium) are used. For example, this is seen in patients on ventilation who have a history of asthma. Muscle biopsies from affected individuals show evidence of muscle destruction. 106 The limbs of affected individuals appear atrophied, and deep tendon reflexes are reduced or absent. Limb paralysis may last from several weeks to months.

#### **Nutritional Status and Exercise**

Weakening of the respiratory muscles may occur in any patient who does not receive adequate nutrition or who was malnourished before admission. Underfeeding can lead to muscle wasting (including the diaphragm, heart, and other organ tissues), particularly in patients under the stress of an acute, severe illness. Other problems associated with malnutrition include a reduced central

Conversely, overfeeding, particularly with solutions using carbohydrates as the primary calorie source, can cause increases in O<sub>2</sub> consumption, CO<sub>2</sub> production, and minute ventilation. The increase in CO<sub>2</sub> production occurs during lipogenesis (i.e., the conversion of carbohydrates to lipids [fats]). Excessive carbohydrate feeding therefore may interfere with weaning from mechanical ventilation because of an increased CO<sub>2</sub> load that the patient must remove during ventilation. Monitoring the patient's metabolic rate and substrate utilization with indirect calorimetry can help minimize this type of problem with parenteral feeding (see Chapter 10).

Feedings must be carefully monitored. Nutritional solutions containing emulsified fats, proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals must be provided in appropriate proportions for each patient. Mixed solutions containing emulsified fats do not appear to elevate the metabolic rate and can be used to meet nutritional and high-carbohydrate solutions.

Strengthening of respiratory muscles that are weak from lack of use is also important to avoid muscle atrophy and fatigue. Two generally accepted principles apply: First, the clinician must make sure the patient is adequately nourished without being overfed. Second, periods of exercise (spontaneous breathing) are required to strengthen the respiratory muscles, followed by undisturbed rest with sufficient ventilatory support during the night. Periodic mobilization of patients (e.g., the patient is assisted to walk and sit in a bedside chair) can also aid in mobilization of secretions and prevention of atelectasis). Even following these principles, it is important to understand that muscle recovery is often unpredictable (see the following Clinical Scenario for an example).

### ( Clinical Scenario: Weaning

A child with C-1 quadriplegia received mechanical ventilation for 1 year. At that time, a phrenic nerve stimulator was inserted into the child's diaphragm. The phrenic nerve stimulator initially produced very low tidal volumes (V<sub>T</sub>s), which declined dramatically after a short period of diaphragm exertion. The stimulation was stopped, and 1 to 2 days of rest followed. It took at least 48 hours to recover the baseline V<sub>T</sub> after the initial exercise of the unconditioned diaphragm. After 2 to 3 weeks, however, the fatigue factor disappeared, and effective V<sub>T</sub> could be maintained during several hours of stimulation. This case study illustrates that the response to a well-controlled exercise program for strengthening and reconditioning the diaphragm was unpredictable. It could not be predicted that the initial fatigue problem would be corrected after 3 weeks. In this particular child, recovery was not linear but rather a continually varying process. Although the weaning process can often be unpredictable, respiratory failure that occurs early in weaning probably indicates that the patient needs more rest between spontaneous breathing trials.

#### **Psychological Factors**

Although the preceding discussion focused on physiological factors that can affect a patient's ability to be liberated from

ventilatory support, it is important to recognize that psychological factors can also influence the success of a weaning trial. Indeed, the role of psychological factors on evidence-based weaning protocols remains quite ambiguous. Two intangible important psychological factors must be considered during weaning. Patients who resist being mobilized and are reluctant to assume any responsibility for their recovery can hinder attempts of ventilator liberation. Weaning a patient from mechanical ventilation is typically more successful when the patient is optimistic about his or her illness, motivated to recover, and assists the health care team by being cooperative. Unmotivated patients therefore will probably take longer to wean than those patients who are optimistic about their recovery.

Psychological problems can manifest as fear, anxiety, delirium, ICU psychosis, depression, anger, denial, fear of shortness of breath, and fear of being left alone, among other symptoms. The use of sedatives and many other medications also tends to alter a patient's mental status (see Chapter 15). The attitudes of the nurse, physician, and therapist team and the patient's attitude toward the team can have a huge effect on the outcome of the weaning trial. Patients who are chemically dependent (e.g., tobacco, alcohol, pain medication) may also appear nervous and anxious after withdrawal from these chemical agents.

A number of disease-related issues can also contribute to psychological problems. Two important considerations are the severity and the duration of the illness. For example, older patients with debilitating diseases tend to be more depressed and anxious.<sup>67</sup> Another important issue is sleep deprivation, which is commonly associated with the ICU environment. Patients may report hallucinations and nightmares, express fear of dying or abandonment, and manifest heightened anxiety ascribed to their environment, medical treatment, lack of sleep, and the illness itself.

To allay some of these psychological fears, the clinician must focus on environmental and communication issues. In terms of environment, noise levels should be reduced and an adequate amount of time provided for undisturbed sleep. There are times when it is more important for the patient to receive a good night of sleep rather than obtaining routine vital signs during sleep hours, particularly because continuous monitoring is available. In terms of communication, eye contact, touching, and written or verbal communication efforts can be a valuable means for clinicians to connect with a patient. Health care workers often go into patient areas and perform a clinical procedure or check the equipment and never take the time to communicate with the patient. Establishing effective communication skills is critical for achieving successful clinical outcomes.

A delayed or failed weaning attempt can cause patients and staff to become depressed or anxious. Clinicians must have patience with the process and try to convey a feeling of calm and self-assurance to the patient.

## Recommendation 6: Maintaining Ventilation in Patients With Spontaneous Breathing Trial Failure

Patients for whom an SBT fails should receive a stable, nonfatiguing, comfortable form of ventilatory support (see Box 20.4).<sup>59</sup> The clinical focus for the 24 hours after a failed SBT should be on maintaining adequate muscle unloading, optimizing comfort (and thus sedation needs), and preventing complications, rather than on aggressive ventilatory support reduction.<sup>10</sup> The patient may participate in part of the WOB as long as the load is not fatiguing.

**CHAPTER 20** 

As previously mentioned, repeated SBT on the same day is of no benefit. Repetitive and ritualistic attempts at gradual reductions in ventilator settings are not worth the time or effort. 110 To date there is no evidence that a gradual support reduction strategy is better than providing full, stable support between once-daily SBTs. Some factors the respiratory therapist can adjust to improve patient comfort and minimize imposed ventilatory loads include the following:

- · Carefully set the sensitivity level (i.e., ventilator-triggering
- Adjust flow patterns to match patient demand
- Make sure ventilator settings are appropriate to prevent air trapping (auto-PEEP)<sup>1</sup>
- If auto-PEEP is present, use applied PEEP to facilitate breath triggering and counteract the auto-PEEP

An interesting finding of the ACCP/SCCM/AARC task force was how poorly clinicians assess the potential for ventilator discontinuation, especially in patients considered ventilator dependent for longer than several days. This finding emphasizes the need for more focused assessment strategies for these types of patients. The following Clinical Scenario provides an example of a case of weaning failure.5

#### Clinical Scenario: Weaning Failure

A 47-year-old man is admitted to the ICU with a severe asthma exacerbation. He is intubated and mechanical ventilation is instituted. After 3 weeks of ventilatory support, the medical staff is unable to wean the patient. He has a difficult ventilation history, including the use of sedatives, analgesics, anxiolytics, and multiple bronchodilators. A tracheotomy is performed. About 36 hours later the patient dies, apparently from mucus plugging. A heat-moisture exchanger (HME) had been used with this patient, in whom increased secretions were compounded by a fluid overload. Although no autopsy was performed, excessive, thick secretions may have obstructed the airway and therefore contributed to the potential for the development of mucus plugging.

#### FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

#### **Recommendation 7: Anesthesia and Sedation** Strategies and Protocols

Recommendation 7 states that anesthesia and sedation strategies and ventilator management should be aimed at early extubation in postoperative patients.<sup>59</sup> In these patients a depressed respiratory drive and pain are the main reasons for ventilator dependence. A lower anesthetic/sedation regimen may permit earlier extubation.<sup>59</sup> Ventilator modes that guarantee a certain breathing rate and  $\dot{V}_E$  (CMV modes, IMV, and MMV) are important for patients with unreliable respiratory drives. The immediate postoperative patient may be ideally suited for simple automatic feedback modes that provide a backup form of support (e.g., MMV or VS).<sup>47,52</sup>

#### **Recommendation 8: Weaning Protocols**

Protocols for ventilator discontinuation, which are designed for nonphysician clinicians, should be developed and implemented by ICU staff. They must also be aimed at optimizing sedation.<sup>5</sup>

Nonphysician protocols are often called therapist-driven protocols (TDPs) or nurse-driven protocols.

TDPs for weaning patients from ventilation have been found to be safe and to reduce hospital costs by shortening the time required for ventilatory support. A variety of protocols exist; although they can take the form of outlines, tables, and algorithms, their content tends to be similar. Fig. 20.7 presents an example of a TDP. 113 It has been suggested that protocols heighten staff awareness of the process and generally promote weaning success.<sup>112</sup>

Protocols implemented by respiratory therapists and associated ICU team members are recognized as efficient, effective approaches to discontinuation of ventilatory support. 54,114-116 Nurses, respiratory therapists, and physicians involved in the patient's care must be informed of the patient's progress so that they can all work toward the goal of successfully weaning the patient from ventilatory support (Key Point 20.7).

**New Point 20.7** Weaning protocols have been shown to be efficient and effective approaches to discontinuation of ventilatory support.

A significant reduction in extubation failures and shorter weaning times are noted when TDPs and nurse-driven protocols are used. Studies suggest that some physicians may be too conservative when considering whether a patient is ready for SBT or extubation or both.

The choice of a specific protocol is best left to the individual institution. Protocols should not replace clinical judgment but rather complement it. Protocols should be updated regularly to reflect current medical evidence and clinical practice patterns as they evolve. Institutions must commit the resources necessary to develop and implement protocols. Reduced staff levels or inadequate staff training can jeopardize clinical outcomes (Key Point 20.8).

**New Point 20.8** "I believe that a skilled clinician at the bedside does more to facilitate ventilator weaning than any ventilator mode."15

#### **Recommendation 9: Role of Tracheostomy in** Weaning

A tracheostomy is considered when it becomes apparent that the patient will require prolonged ventilator assistance.<sup>59</sup> A tracheotomy is performed after the patient is stable on the ventilator and when the person appears likely to benefit from the procedure. 118 The procedure should be performed as soon as possible after the need for extended intubation has been verified, and it should be based on the patient's disease and his or her wishes. The procedure is usually performed within 7 days of the onset of respiratory failure, or sooner in neurologically impaired patients. Patients who might benefit from a tracheostomy include the following:

- Those who require high levels of sedation to tolerate ETs
- Those with marginal respiratory mechanics and who may have tachypnea as a result
- Those in whom lower resistance (a potential benefit of TTs) may reduce the risk for muscle overload

- Those who may gain psychological benefit from the ability to eat, talk, and have greater mobility
- Those for whom increased mobility may aid physical therapy efforts \$^{120-122}\$
- Ultimately the most important beneficial outcome of a tracheostomy is the potential to facilitate discontinuation of mechanical ventilatory support.

Despite a lack of data, the general clinical consensus is that patients receiving long-term mechanical ventilation have less facial discomfort when a nasotracheal or orotracheal tube is removed and replaced with a TT. Reduction in WOB and dead space and more effective secretion removal are possible benefits. <sup>122</sup> Interestingly, clinical data do not indicate that the rate of VAP is lower or that the duration of ventilation is shorter for patients with tracheostomies.

A tracheostomy site typically requires 7 to 10 days to mature. If the TT is inadvertently displaced in the first 24 to 72 hours, successful blind tube replacement is highly unlikely.<sup>118</sup>

Removal of a TT is not difficult and can proceed just like extubation. After the tube is removed, the stoma is covered with one or two gauze pads held in place with tape. A stoma is like an open wound, and barring complications, it heals in a few days in most patients. Patients are taught to support the stoma when they cough by applying pressure to the gauze bandage with the flat surface of the hand. The secretions brought to the mouth can be expectorated. A tracheostomy button is recommended if the stoma must remain open because of excessive secretions or for some other reason. This short, hollow tube is inserted into the stoma and is held in place by its inner flanges. It can be capped to occlude the opening if desired. <sup>123</sup>

### Recommendation 10: Long-Term Care Facilities for Patients Requiring Prolonged Ventilation

Unless evidence of irreversible disease exists, a patient who requires prolonged ventilatory support should not be considered permanently ventilator dependent until 3 months have passed and all weaning attempts during that time have failed.<sup>59</sup> Those failing to wean may require placement in a long-term care facility.

### Recommendation 11: Clinician Familiarity With Long-Term Care Facilities

Critical care practitioners must be familiar with facilities in their communities or units in their hospitals that specialize in the management of patients who require prolonged mechanical ventilation.<sup>59</sup> Patients for whom weaning attempts in the ICU fail are transferred to long-term ventilatory care facilities when they are medically stable. These facilities should have demonstrated competence, safety, and success in accomplishing ventilator discontinuation. Often these facilities have fewer staff members and less costly monitoring equipment, which make them less expensive than ICUs.<sup>59</sup>

### Recommendation 12: Weaning in Long-Term Ventilation Units

Patients who are medically stable and able to leave the ICU but who have not been successfully weaned in that environment have several options.<sup>124</sup> Box 20.14 lists alternative sites where these patients can be weaned. The following are the goals for weaning in long-term care facilities<sup>124</sup>:

- To reduce the amount of ventilatory support
- To reduce the invasiveness of support
- To increase independence from mechanical devices
- To preserve and/or improve current function
- · To maintain medical stability

Weaning procedures in long-term care units are typically individually designed rather than designed according to a fixed protocol, as in the ICU. In addition, using a variety of techniques may be required because a method that works for one person might not work for another. For example, some patients may not need an artificial airway to maintain airway patency and may only require NIV during the night.<sup>125</sup>

Weaning is slow paced when a patient requires long-term ventilation. Daily SBTs are not performed because patients are unlikely to be weaned successfully in 24 hours. The medical staff in long-term facilities generally includes registered nurses and registered respiratory therapists who are experienced in the

assessment and management of these patients. Staff members understand the need for slow withdrawal of ventilator support and the importance of patience.

Patients with chronic conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, severe chronic lung disease, loss of the central drive to breathe, phrenic nerve damage or paralysis, cervical fracture leading to paralysis, and other types of neuromuscular or chronic disorders may require permanent mechanical ventilation. In these cases, long-term ventilation refers to a means of support for patients who are not acutely ill but who are presumed to have a permanent need for such support. Ventilator dependence can be challenging, but it does not have to be completely confining, and many patients have meaningful lives outside the hospital or medical facility. Chapter 21 discusses long-term ventilation for ventilator-dependent individuals.

# AMERICAN THORACIC SOCIETY/AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CHEST PHYSICIANS CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE: LIBERATION FROM MECHANICAL VENTILATION

A collaborative effort by representatives of the ATS and the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) produced a document outlining updated guidelines for the liberation from mechanical ventilation in critically ill adult patients. The recommendations included in this recent guideline focus on six areas:

- The use of inspiratory pressure augmentation during spontaneous breathing trials;
- The use of a liberation protocol for acutely hospitalized adults who have been mechanically ventilated for > 24 hours:
- The use of NIV after extubation for high-risk patients who have been receiving mechanical ventilation for greater than 24 hours:
- Utilization of protocolized rehabilitation strategies to increase early mobilization of acutely hospitalized adults who have been receiving mechanical ventilation for >24 hours;
- Use of sedation liberation protocols that attempt to minimize sedation of patients who have been receiving mechanical ventilation for >24 hours:
- Performance of an endotracheal cuff leak test in mechanically ventilated adults who meet extubation criteria and are at a high risk for the development of postextubation. This guideline also provides a recommendation for the management of adult patients who fail a cuff leak test but otherwise demonstrate that they are ready for extubation (i.e., administration of systemic corticosteroids before an extubation attempt). (See Box 20.15.)

## ETHICAL DILEMMA: WITHHOLDING AND WITHDRAWING VENTILATORY SUPPORT

The ethical and economic issues related to life support are becoming more important every day as the cost of medical care increases, the availability of payment declines, and the population ages. <sup>128</sup> Withholding and withdrawal of life support are important ethical issues related to death and dying.

### BOX **20.15**

### Summary of ATS/ACCP Clinical Practice Guideline: Liberation From Mechanical Ventilation in Critically III Adults

- For acutely hospitalized patients ventilated more than 24 hours, the panel suggest an initial daily spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) conducted with inspiratory pressure augmentation (5-8 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) rather than without (T-piece or continuous positive airway pressure). (Conditional recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence).
- Acutely hospitalized adults who have been mechanically ventilated for more than 24 hours be managed with a ventilator liberation protocol, rather than no protocol, (Conditional recommendation, Low certainty in the evidence).
- For patients at high risk for extubation failure who have been receiving mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours and who have passed a spontaneous breathing trial, recommend extubation to preventative NIV (Strong recommendation, Moderate certainty in the evidence).
- For acutely hospitalized adults who have been mechanically ventilated for >24 hours, use protocolized rehabilitation directed toward early mobilization (Conditional recommendation, Low certainty in the evidence).
- For acutely hospitalized patients who have been mechanically ventilated >24 hours it is suggested that be managed with

- protocols that attempt to minimize sedation (Conditional recommendation, Low certainty in the evidence).
- Performance of a cuff leak test in mechanically ventilated adults who meet extubation criteria and are deemed high risk for postextubation stridor (Conditional recommendation, Very low certainty in the evidence).
- For adults who have failed a cuff leak test but are otherwise ready for extubation, it is suggested administrating systemic steroid for at least 4 hours before extubation (Conditional recommendation, Moderate certainty in the evidence).

#### SUMMARY

- Weaning from mechanical ventilator support generally can be easily accomplished for most patients. For those who require more time, several methods are available, including the traditional techniques of IMV, PSV, and T-piece weaning and the more advanced closed-loop modes such as ATC, MMV, and ASV.
- The recommendations established by the ACCP/SCCM/AARC task force have provided a solid foundation on which clinicians can better approach ventilator discontinuation.
- Verification that the problems leading to mechanical ventilation have been resolved is the first step in successfully liberating a patient from ventilatory support.
- Evaluation of appropriate criteria and the use of therapist-driven protocols or nurse-directed protocols can facilitate the process.
- Long-term care facilities provide a less demanding and less costly approach for patients who require longer ventilatory support and a slower weaning process.
- A recent ATS/ACCP clinical practice guideline provides additional evidence-based recommendations to optimize liberation from mechanical ventilation for critically ill adult patients.
