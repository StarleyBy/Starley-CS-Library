#### **LEARNING OBJECTIVES**

On completion of this chapter, the reader will be able to do the following:

- Differentiate between acute respiratory failure (ARF) and respiratory insufficiency.
- 2. Describe three categories of disorders that may lead to respiratory insufficiency or ARF.
- 3. Compare normal values for the vital capacity, maximum inspiratory pressure, maximum expiratory pressure (MEP),

forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), peak expiratory flow, physiological dead space/tidal volume ( $V_D/V_T$ ) ratio, alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure difference ( $P_{[A-a]}O_2$ ), and arterial to alveolar partial pressure of oxygen ( $P_aO_2/P_AO_2$ ) ratio with abnormal values that indicate the need for ventilatory support.

he ability to recognize that a patient requires an artificial airway and mechanical ventilation is an essential skill for clinicians. Although ventilators have been used for more than half a century, surprisingly little evidence and few precise criteria are available to guide clinicians about when to initiate ventilatory support. Originally, mechanical ventilation was instituted because respiratory failure was seen as a "derangement" of gas exchange in the lungs. <sup>1,2</sup> Indeed, clinicians traditionally have relied heavily on arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis to identify the presence of respiratory failure and the need for ventilatory support. <sup>3</sup> More recently, clinicians have used ventilatory measurements (e.g., respiratory muscle strength) to support their decision to initiate mechanical ventilation. Interestingly, many of these

threshold measurements actually reflect criteria that clinicians use to determine when to wean a patient from ventilation.

Decisions made in the acute care setting must be supported by evidence-based criteria. The evidence should clearly demonstrate that a particular intervention is beneficial and is associated with effective outcomes, such as improved quality of life, reduced length of stay, or a lower mortality rate.<sup>3</sup> This chapter provides information to help clinicians recognize the signs of respiratory distress and respiratory failure. Specific pathological processes and methods used to identify the need for an artificial airway and mechanical ventilation are discussed. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV), an important alternative to invasive positive pressure ventilation, is also reviewed. Five patient case studies

are presented to demonstrate how clinicians can apply various criteria establishing the need for mechanical ventilation in patients with respiratory failure.

#### **ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE**

The primary purpose of ventilation is to maintain **homeostasis**. Mechanical ventilation is indicated when a person cannot achieve an appropriate level of ventilation to maintain adequate gas exchange and acid-base balance. Box 4.1 lists the physiological and clinical objectives of mechanical ventilation.<sup>4</sup>

#### **Recognizing the Patient in Respiratory Distress**

Left untreated, acute respiratory failure can lead to coma and eventually death. Early recognition of impending respiratory failure can significantly improve the outcomes for these patients. A number of simple and direct observations can be used to identify impending respiratory failure and guide the selection of an appropriate therapeutic strategy.

The initial assessment of the patient in respiratory distress should focus on several physical findings. First, determine the patient's level of consciousness. Is the patient awake or asleep? If the patient is asleep or unconscious, can the patient be awakened and, if so, to what extent? Second, assess the appearance and texture of the patient's skin. Do the nail beds or lips show evidence of cyanosis? Is the patient pale and diaphoretic (sweating)? Third, evaluate the patient's vital signs (e.g., respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, oxygenation status).

The sudden onset of dyspnea is typically accompanied by physical signs of respiratory distress. For example, patients experiencing respiratory distress appear anxious, the forehead is furrowed, and the nostrils flared. These patients may be diaphoretic and flushed. They may also try to sit upright or, if seated, lean forward with their elbows resting on a bedside table or their knees. Patients in respiratory or cardiac distress may appear ashen, pale, or cyanotic and using their accessory muscles of respiration (e.g., sternocleidomastoid, scalene, and trapezius muscles). In severe respiratory distress, the intercostal spaces and the supraclavicular notch may appear indented (retracted) during active inspiration. The patient may complain of shortness of breath. Paradoxical or abnormal movement of the thorax and abdomen

may be noted, and abnormal breath sounds may be heard on auscultation. Tachycardia, arrhythmias, and hypotension are common findings.<sup>5</sup> Pulse oximetry, which is a quick and costeffective method of assessing arterial oxygen saturation and pulse rate, can be used to assess the patient's oxygenation status (see Chapter 10). (NOTE: Anemia and reduced cardiac output can compromise oxygen delivery to the tissues. In such cases, reduced pulse pressures and blood flow may prevent the pulse oximeter from accurately estimating the patient's actual arterial oxygen saturation and heart rate.)

It is worth mentioning that in some cases, signs of respiratory distress are the result of the person experiencing a "panic attack." Simply calming the person and questioning him or her about the distress can usually relieve respiratory distress in this type of patient. (The use of both verbal and nonverbal communication with a patient is vital to effective patient assessment.)

#### **Definition of Respiratory Failure**

With acute respiratory failure (ARF), respiratory activity is absent or insufficient to maintain adequate oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide clearance, in spite of initial therapy. Clinically, ARF may be defined as the inability to maintain  $P_aO_2$ ,  $P_aCO_2$ , and pH at acceptable levels. ARF is generally considered to be present in a patient who demonstrates a  $P_aO_2$  below the predicted normal range for the patient's age under ambient (atmospheric) conditions, a  $P_aCO_2$  greater than 50 mm Hg and rising, and a falling pH of 7.25 and lower. <sup>1-3</sup>

Two forms of ARF have been described: hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypercapnic respiratory failure. Hypoxemic respiratory failure is a result of severe ventilation/perfusion ( $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$ ) mismatching. It can also occur with diffusion defects, right-to-left shunting, alveolar hypoventilation, aging, and inadequate inspired oxygen. A good working definition of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is acute life-threatening or vital organ—threatening tissue hypoxia. Hypoxemic respiratory failure can be treated with supplemental oxygen or in combination with positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (see Chapter 13). Mechanical ventilation may also be necessary if hypoxemic respiratory failure occurs along with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure and an increased work of breathing.

### BOX **4.1**

#### **Objectives of Mechanical Ventilation**

#### **Physiological Objectives**

- 1. Support or manipulate pulmonary gas exchange:
  - Alveolar ventilation: Achieve eucapnic ventilation or allow permissive hypercapnia (NOTE: Permissive hypercapnia is sometimes required in the ventilation of patients with a lifethreatening asthma exacerbation, acute lung injury [ALI], or acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS] to protect the lung by avoiding high ventilation volumes and pressures.)
  - Alveolar oxygenation: Maintain adequate oxygen delivery  $(C_aO_2 \times Cardiac\ output)$
- 2. Increase lung volume:
  - Prevent or treat atelectasis with adequate end-inspiratory lung inflation

- Restore and maintain an adequate functional residual capacity (FRC)
- 3. Reduce the work of breathing

#### **Clinical Objectives**

- 1. Reverse acute respiratory failure
- 2. Reverse respiratory distress
- 3. Reverse hypoxemia
- 4. Prevent or reverse atelectasis and maintain FRC
- 5. Reverse respiratory muscle fatigue
- 6. Permit sedation or paralysis (or both)
- 7. Reduce systemic or myocardial oxygen consumption
- 8. Minimize associated complications and reduce mortality

Acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, or acute ventilatory failure, occurs when a person cannot achieve adequate ventilation to maintain a normal  $P_aCO_2$ . The ventilatory pump consists of the respiratory muscles, thoracic cage, and nerves that are controlled by respiratory centers in the brainstem. The following types of disorders can lead to pump failure (Box 4.2):

- · Central nervous system disorders
- · Neuromuscular disorders
- Disorders that increase the work of breathing (WOB)

#### Recognizing Hypoxemia and Hypercapnia

As shown in Table 4.1, the clinical signs of hypoxemia and hypercapnia closely resemble the signs seen in patients with respiratory distress (Key Point 4.1). Tachycardia and tachypnea are early indicators of hypoxia. In some cases of hypoxemic respiratory failure, the patient's condition can be treated successfully by administering enriched oxygen mixtures. However, some hypoxemic conditions, such as severe shunting, are refractory to oxygen therapy (i.e., administering enriched oxygen mixtures does not significantly reduce the level of hypoxemia).

In patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure, P<sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> levels are elevated with accompanying hypoxemia unless the patient is receiving oxygen therapy. Elevation of P<sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> leads to an increase in cerebral blood flow as a result of dilation of cerebral blood vessels. Severe hypercapnia, if left untreated, eventually leads to CO<sub>2</sub> narcosis, cerebral depression, coma, and death.

Untreated hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and acidosis can lead to cardiac dysrhythmias, ventricular fibrillation, and even cardiac arrest. The potential for these consequences underscores the importance of recognizing that a patient is in acute or impending respiratory failure and the need to initiate therapy in

a timely manner. The elements required to achieve a successful outcome are use of supplemental oxygen therapy, maintenance of a patent airway, and continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilatory status with pulse oximetry and ABG analysis.

#### **PATIENT HISTORY AND DIAGNOSIS**

The various types of pathological conditions that increase the risk for a patient developing respiratory failure were mentioned previously (see Box 4.2). The following is a brief discussion of some of these conditions. Several case studies are presented to illustrate the clinical findings associated with respiratory failure.

#### **Central Nervous System Disorders**

Central nervous system (CNS) disorders that decrease respiratory drive, such as depression of the respiratory centers induced by drugs or trauma, can lead to significant reductions in minute ventilation  $(\mathring{V}/\mathring{Q}_E)$  and alveolar ventilation  $(\mathring{V}/\mathring{Q}_A)$  and, ultimately, to hypercapnia and hypoxemia. In otherwise normal individuals, an increase in  $P_aCO_2$  greater than 70 mm Hg has a CNS depressant effect, which reduces respiratory drive and ventilation. Hypoxemia, which accompanies this process, normally acts as a respiratory stimulant (through stimulation of the peripheral chemoreceptors) to increase breathing. However, because the CNS is already compromised, the body's response to hypoxemia is diminished.

Other CNS disorders associated with tumors, stroke, or head trauma can alter the normal pattern of breathing. For example, a head injury might result in cerebral hemorrhage and increased

#### BOX **4.2**

#### Disorders and Agents Associated With Hypoventilation and Possible Respiratory Failure

#### **Central Nervous System Disorders**

#### Reduced Drive to Breathe

- Depressant drugs (barbiturates, tranquilizers, narcotics, general anesthetic agents)
- Brain or brainstem lesions (stroke, trauma to the head or neck, cerebral hemorrhage, tumors, spinal cord injury)
- Hypothyroidism
- Sleep apnea syndrome caused by idiopathic central alveolar hypoventilation

#### Increased Drive to Breathe

- Increased metabolic rate (increased CO<sub>2</sub> production)
- Metabolic acidosis
- · Anxiety associated with dyspnea

#### **Neuromuscular Disorders**

- Paralytic drugs (e.g., curare, nerve gas, succinylcholine, insecticides, nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents [see Chapter 15])
- Drugs that affect neuromuscular transmission (e.g., aminoglycoside antibiotics, long-term adrenocorticosteroids, calcium channel blockers)

 Impaired muscle function (e.g., electrolyte imbalances, malnutrition, peripheral nerve disorders, atrophy, fatigue, chronic pulmonary disease with decreasing capacity for diaphragmatic contraction as a result of air trapping)

#### **Disorders That Increase the Work of Breathing**

- Pleura-occupying lesions (e.g., pleural effusions, hemothorax, empyema, pneumothorax)
- Chest wall deformities (e.g., flail chest, rib fracture, kyphoscoliosis, obesity)
- Increased airway resistance resulting from increased secretions, mucosal edema, bronchoconstriction, airway inflammation, or foreign body aspiration (e.g., asthma, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, croup, acute epiglottitis, acute bronchitis)
- Lung tissue involvement (e.g., interstitial pulmonary fibrotic diseases, aspiration, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, drug-induced pulmonary edema)
- Pulmonary vascular problems (e.g., pulmonary thromboembolism, pulmonary vascular damage)
- Other problems (e.g., increased metabolic rates with accompanying pulmonary problems)
- · Postoperative pulmonary complications
- Dynamic hyperinflation (air trapping)

intracranial pressure (ICP). If significant bleeding occurs with these types of injuries, abnormal breathing patterns such as Cheyne-Stokes respirations or Biot respirations may occur. In many cases, cerebral abnormalities can also affect normal reflex responses, such as swallowing. In these cases, endotracheal intubation may be required to protect the airway from aspiration or obstruction by the tongue (Case Study 4.1).

There is considerable debate about whether controlled hyperventilation should be used as a ventilatory technique in patients with a closed head injury. Controlled hyperventilation lowers the P<sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> and increases the pH, resulting in reduced cerebral perfusion and reduced ICP. It is important to understand that this effect is temporary, lasting only about 24 hours, because the body eventually adapts to the change through renal compensatory mechanisms.<sup>8</sup> Although controlled hyperventilation is still used by some clinicians to lower sudden increases

#### Case Study 4.1

#### **Stroke Victim**

A 58-year-old man is brought to the emergency department from his home after a suspected stroke (i.e., cerebrovascular accident). Vital signs reveal a heart rate of 94 beats/min, respirations of 16 breaths/min, normal temperature, and systemic arterial blood pressure of 165/95 mm Hg. The patient's pupils respond slowly and unequally to light. Breath sounds are diminished in the lung bases. A sound similar to snoring is heard on inspiration. The patient is unconscious and unresponsive to painful stimuli. What is the most appropriate course of action at this time?

in ICP, clinicians must keep in mind that the desire to use this technique for patients with traumatic brain injury is not by itself an indication for intubation and mechanical ventilation.<sup>3</sup> Furthermore, patients with traumatic brain injury have a better long-range outcome (3–6 months) when controlled hyperventilation is not used.<sup>8</sup>

#### **Neuromuscular Disorders**

Neuromuscular disorders that can lead to respiratory failure usually are the result of one of the following:

- Motor nerve damage
- Problems with transmission of nerve impulses at the neuromuscular junction
- · Muscle dysfunction
- CNS disorders
- Drugs that affect neuromuscular function

The onset of respiratory failure can vary considerably depending on the cause of the neuromuscular dysfunction. Druginduced neuromuscular failure usually has a rapid onset (Case Study 4.2), whereas the onset of respiratory failure in disease states such as myasthenia gravis may not occur for days or years or it might not happen at all. Regardless of the cause, intubation and mechanical ventilation are indicated if respiratory fatigue occurs rapidly in a patient with a neuromuscular disorder and ARF is imminent.<sup>9</sup>

The maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) and vital capacity (VC) can be used to assess respiratory muscle strength of patients with neuromuscular disorders. These measurements are noninvasive, relatively easy to obtain, and inexpensive. Respiratory therapists can measure MIP and VC every 2 to 4 hours to monitor changes in respiratory status. Commonly cited threshold values are an MIP of -20 to -30 cm  $H_2O$  or less (i.e., 0 to -20 cm  $H_2O$ ) and a VC lower than 10 to 15 mL/kg. Note that although these measures are often used, their effectiveness in improving outcomes has not been established (Table 4.2). (Techniques for measuring MIP and VC are discussed later in this chapter.)

#### Case Study 4.2

#### **Unexplained Acute Respiratory Failure**

A STAT arterial blood gas evaluation performed on a patient admitted through the emergency department reveals the following: pH = 7.15,  $P_aCO_2$ , = 83 mm Hg,  $P_aO_2$ , = 34 mm Hg,  $HCO_3^-$  = 28 mEq/L on room air. The patient was found unconscious in a nearby park. No other history is available. What is the most appropriate course of action at this time?

Determination of baseline ABG values, along with periodic measurement of oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry  $(S_pO_2)$ , is also appropriate when caring for patients with neuromuscular problems. Repeating the ABG analysis may be indicated if the patient's clinical status changes significantly. Furthermore, if the patient's condition progressively worsens, the practitioner should *not* wait until an acute situation develops to intervene (Case Study 4.3). Clinicians generally agree that invasive positive pressure ventilation should be initiated before acute respiratory acidosis develops.<sup>3</sup>

#### **Increased Work of Breathing**

An increase in the WOB can lead to respiratory failure secondary to respiratory muscle fatigue. WOB normally accounts for 1% to 4% of total oxygen consumption at rest. In patients experiencing respiratory distress, the WOB can increase to as much as 35% to 40% of total oxygen consumption. Increased WOB is usually associated with an increased rate or depth of breathing (or both).

#### Case Study 4.3

#### **Ventilation in Neuromuscular Disorders**

#### Case 1

A 68-year-old woman with a history of myasthenia gravis has been in the hospital for 12 days. She was admitted because her primary disease had worsened. The patient is unable to perform maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) and slow vital capacity (SVC) maneuvers properly because she cannot seal her lips around the mouthpiece. Her attempts produced the following values: MIP =  $-34\ cm$   $H_2O;$  SVC = 1.2 L. What should the clinician recommend at this time?

#### Case 2

A 26-year-old man who is recovering from mycoplasma pneumonia complains of tingling sensations and weakening in his hands and feet. He is admitted to the general medicine service for observation. Over several hours the patient becomes unable to move his legs. A respiratory therapist (RT) is called to assess him. What should the RT recommend at this time?

More work is required to move the same  $V_T$  when the patient has obstructed airways, a restrictive lung disorder, or both (Case Study 4.4). A patient's tolerance to maintain the increased WOB is limited by the eventual fatigue of respiratory muscles. Increased WOB can induce hypoventilation, respiratory insufficiency, and eventually respiratory failure.

An example of a condition that causes increased WOB is severe chest trauma. Flail chest, pneumothorax, and hemothorax can impair the mechanics of breathing and affect the patient's ability to breathe. A reduction in alveolar ventilation leads to  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  mismatching, an increased  $V_D/V_T$ , and, ultimately, hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and acidosis. Although the patient's respiratory centers may be intact and responsive to hypercapnia and hypoxemia, his or her ability to maintain the effort to breathe is seriously compromised. Even as the patient initially tries to respond by increasing minute ventilation (i.e., increased respiratory rate and  $V_T$ ), the  $P_aO_2$  may continue to fall, the  $P_aCO_2$  rises, and the pH decreases despite the patient's compensatory efforts.

In some patients, increased WOB eventually results in rapid, shallow breathing and paradoxical breathing.<sup>13</sup> With paradoxical breathing, the abdomen moves out during exhalation and moves in during inhalation while the chest wall moves out during inhalation and moves in during exhalation. This is the reverse of normal breathing, in which the chest wall and abdomen move outward together on inspiration and inward on exhalation. This asynchronous motion of the chest and abdomen is an ominous sign in patients with respiratory distress and usually indicates increased WOB and the onset of respiratory muscle fatigue.<sup>3</sup>

At one time physicians commonly used positive pressure to "splint" the chest and "internally stabilize" the chest wall in patients with flail chest. Current evidence suggests that better

#### Case Study 4.4

#### **Asthma Case**

A 13-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department for an acute exacerbation of asthma. Continuous nebulizer therapy with a  $\beta\text{-}2$  adrenergic bronchodilator is administered. The patient has been given a high dose of corticosteroids and is receiving oxygen. Four hours after admission, she is alert and responsive. Her respiratory rate is 20 breaths/min. Coarse crackles and end-inspiratory wheezes are heard clearly throughout both lung fields. What recommendation for continuous respiratory care should be made for this patient?

outcomes are achieved when patients with flail chest are managed without intubation or invasive positive pressure ventilation (IPPV). IPPV is used for flail chest only when it is associated with imminent respiratory failure.

# PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS IN ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE

Clinicians often use ventilatory mechanics measurements and ABG results to detect respiratory failure. Unfortunately, valid predictive threshold values for these measurements have not been substantiated.<sup>3</sup> The absence of guidelines can sometimes make it difficult for a novice clinician to know when to intubate or provide ventilation for a patient in distress.

Table 4.3 lists normal adult values for ventilatory mechanics and the suggested critical range that may indicate a need for mechanical ventilation when considered with other assessment criteria. It is worth mentioning that most of these parameters are probably better used as indications for discontinuing mechanical ventilation, with two exceptions: in patients with neuromuscular disorders, the MIP and VC may be beneficial in tracking respiratory muscle strength; in patients with reactive airway disease (e.g., asthma and some patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]), the forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and the peak expiratory flow (PEF) are helpful for quantifying the degree of airway resistance. FEV<sub>1</sub> is more useful to evaluate small airways function than is the PEF.

### Bedside Measurements of Ventilatory Mechanics

Abnormal ventilatory mechanics measurements should alert the clinician to the presence of a potentially serious respiratory problem. As mentioned previously, MIP and VC are the bedside measurements most often used to assess respiratory muscle strength in patients with neuromuscular disease. For patients with acute asthma, PEF is the most frequently used parameter to assess airway resistance.  $FEV_1$  is a better parameter, and bedside spirometry is readily available for measuring  $FEV_1$ .

#### **Maximum Inspiratory Pressure**

The MIP (or  $P_{Imax}$ ) is the lowest (i.e., most negative) pressure generated during a forceful inspiratory effort against an occluded airway. MIP is also called *negative inspiratory force (NIF)*. At the bedside, MIP is usually measured with a pressure manometer (Fig. 4.1).<sup>14</sup> The device is connected to the patient's airway by means of a mask, mouthpiece, or endotracheal tube adapter. The patient is instructed to inhale forcefully from the device while the

### BOX **4.3**

#### Alternative Technique for Measuring Maximum Inspiratory Pressure

For accuracy and reproducibility, measurement of the maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) must begin as closely as possible to the residual volume (RV). If the patient cannot perform a maximum exhalation, a one-way valve (see Fig. 4.1) may be used. This valve allows exhalation but prevents inspiration. To perform the technique, the clinician occludes the thumb port and watches the pressure gauge as the patient takes multiple breaths (because the patient cannot inspire air against the occluded valve, this brings lung volume close to the RV as the patient exhales over several breaths). MIP measurement stops when the lowest negative value is reached (this may take up to 20 seconds). Although the oneway valve technique can provide an accurate MIP value, this type of prolonged measurement is extremely uncomfortable for the patient. (Students can gain considerable insight into that discomfort by trying this technique as a laboratory exercise.)

respiratory therapist occludes the thumb port of the T-piece connector containing two one-way valves.

Values are most accurate and reproducible when MIP is measured from the **residual volume** (RV), that is, after a maximum exhalation.  $^{14\text{-}17}$  At least two measurements should be obtained if possible. Obtaining more than two or three MIP maneuvers from patients in distress may result in erroneous results because the procedure requires significant effort by the patient. MIP is normally -50 to -100 cm  $H_2O$ . An MIP of at least -20 cm  $H_2O$  is required to generate a  $V_T$  large enough to produce a good cough (Box 4.3).  $^{14\text{-}18}$ 

#### **Vital Capacity**

Vital capacity is the volume of air that can be maximally exhaled following a maximum inspiration. It can provide valuable information about ventilatory function because the patient must be able to take in a large volume of air to produce a cough strong enough to clear the airway. VC is typically 65 to 75 mL/kg of ideal body weight (IBW), but it may be as high as 100 mL/kg IBW. Values less than 10 to 15 mL/kg IBW are considered inadequate to maintain normal ventilation and produce an effective cough. (See Box 6.2 for calculation of IBW.) VC can be measured at the bedside using a pneumotachometer or respirometer. Obtaining reliable measurements requires the patient's cooperation, which typically occurs when the patient receives proper instructions from the clinician about how to perform the procedure (Key Point 4.2).

### Peak Expiratory Flow and Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second

The PEF is a good indicator of airway resistance and a patient's ability to maintain airway patency. Obtaining reliable measurements of PEF is a part of an effective asthma treatment plan for many asthma patients. A peak flowmeter like the one shown

in Fig. 4.2 can be used to measure PEF. Acceptable values range from 350 to 600 L/min. Low PEFs are most often seen in patients having an acute asthma episode. Values less than 75 to 100 L/min are cause for alarm and indicate severe airflow obstruction.

The FEV $_1$  is another pulmonary function parameter that can be used to assess airway resistance. FEV $_1$  is normally about 80% of the VC, or about 50 to 60 mL/kg IBW. An FEV $_1$  less than 10 mL/kg IBW is considered extremely low. Although several portable spirometers are available for measuring FEV $_1$  at the

**Key Point 4.2** MIP and VC are bedside measurements most often used to assess respiratory muscle strength of patients with neuromuscular disease.

bedside, it is *not* an appropriate measurement to perform on a patient who is severely short of breath and in acute respiratory distress.

#### Respiratory Rate and Minute Ventilation

Two other parameters often mentioned in the assessment of respiratory distress are the respiratory rate (f) and minute ventilation ( $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}_E$ ). The respiratory rate is normally about 12 to 20 breaths/min in adults. Respiratory rates exceeding 35 breaths/min for extended periods are a sign of inadequate alveolar ventilation or hypoxemia (or both). As mentioned previously, elevated respiratory rates are an indication of increased WOB, which eventually leads to respiratory muscle fatigue.

Minute ventilation is the product of tidal volume and respiratory rate  $(\dot{V}/\dot{Q}_E=\dot{V}/\dot{Q}_t\times f_b).$  A normal  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}_E$  is about 5 to 6 L/min, and this value is directly related to the patient's metabolic rate. A  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}_E$  above 10 L/min is cause for concern. In cases in which the patient demonstrates significant pulmonary dysfunction, the  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}_E$  required to maintain a stable  $P_aCO_2$  may become so high that the patient cannot sustain the required work of breathing. Although  $V_T$  and  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}_E$  can be measured in unintubated patients with respiratory distress, these measurements are seldom obtained.  $^3$ 

## Failure of Ventilation and Increased Dead Space

Clinicians generally agree that the best single indicator of adequate ventilation is the  $P_aCO_2$  (Key Point 4.3). A  $P_aCO_2$  of greater than 50 to 55 mm Hg with a decreasing pH (<7.25) indicates acute hypoventilation or acute hypercapnic respiratory failure.

An elevated  $P_aCO_2$  also suggests that dead space  $(V_D)$  is increased relative to  $V_T$ . The normal  $V_D/V_T$  range is 0.3 to 0.4 at normal tidal volumes. Values greater than 0.6 indicate a critical increase in dead space. For example, in a patient with a  $V_T$  of 500 mL and a  $V_D/V_T$  of 0.6 mL, for each breath taken, only 40% (200 mL) contacts pulmonary blood flow and contributes to alveolar gas exchange; 60% (300 mL) goes to areas of the pulmonary system that are not in contact with the pulmonary capillary bed. Under these conditions, the patient must increase the rate and depth of breathing (i.e., increase  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}_E$ ) to try to achieve adequate gas exchange. Increases in dead space are associated with  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  mismatching (i.e., dead space ventilation is defined as ventilation in excess of perfusion). Common causes of increased dead space ventilation include pulmonary thromboemboli, pulmonary vascular injury, and regional hypoperfusion.

In the past, measurement of the  $V_D/V_T$  required the collection of expired gases and simultaneous evaluation of arterial  $CO_2$  tensions. This procedure was time consuming and not well tolerated by patients in severe respiratory failure.  $V_D/V_T$  now can be estimated by using less cumbersome, noninvasive methods, such as volumetric capnometry (see Chapter 10).

**EXECUTE:** Key Point 4.3 The best single indicator of the adequacy of ventilation is the  $P_aCO_2$ .

#### **Failure of Oxygenation**

 $P_aO_2$  is a good indicator of oxygenation status, assuming that abnormal forms of hemoglobin (e.g., carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin) are not present. Normal  $P_aO_2$  is 80 to 100 mm Hg when an individual is breathing room air, but this value varies with age and body position. Monitoring  $S_pO_2$  can also provide an easy, noninvasive means of assessing trends in a patient's oxygenation status (Key Point 4.4). A  $P_aO_2$  less than 70 mm Hg (or  $S_pO_2 < 90\%$ ) on an oxygen mask ( $F_1O_2 \ge 0.6$ ) indicates refractory hypoxemia or hypoxemic respiratory failure. Additional information about a patient's total oxygen-carrying capacity can be derived from measurements or calculation of his or her arterial oxygen content ( $C_aO_2$ ) (Box 4.4).

As discussed later in this text (see Chapter 13), the  $P_{(A-a)}O_2$  can be used to determine the cause of altered oxygenation. The normal range for  $P_{(A-a)}O_2$  for patients breathing room air is 5 to 20 mm Hg; the normal range for patients breathing 100%  $O_2$  is 25 to 65 mm Hg. When  $P_aO_2$  is low and  $P_{(A-a)}O_2$  is high, hypoxemia is due to one of the other three general causes: shunt, diffusion defects, and  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  mismatching (see Appendix B). (NOTE: In these cases,  $P_aCO_2$  may even be lower than normal, indicating hyperventilation to compensate for hypoxemia.)

The  $P_aO_2/P_AO_2$  ratio is another approach that can be used to evaluate a patient's oxygenation status.  $P_aO_2/P_AO_2$  is normally about 0.75 to 0.95. This range indicates that 75% to 95% of the oxygen available in the alveoli is diffusing into the pulmonary capillaries. For example, a normal  $P_aO_2$  of 90 mm Hg divided by a normal  $P_AO_2$  on room air (100 mm Hg) gives a ratio of 0.90. A value of 0.15 or less is critical (i.e., only 15% of available oxygen is getting into the artery).

Using a  $P_aO_2/F_IO_2$  ratio eliminates the need to calculate the alveolar  $PO_2$  ( $P_AO_2$ ). Normal values can be calculated as follows: 90 mm Hg/0.21 = 428 (about 430; range, 350–450). A  $P_aO_2$  of 40 mm Hg with an  $F_IO_2$  of 1.0 (40 mm Hg/1.0 = 40) is an example of an extremely severe abnormality (i.e., refractory hypoxemia).<sup>20</sup>

The treatment for hypoxemia is based on its etiology (Table 4.4). For example, when hemoglobin and hematocrit values are low as a result of hemorrhage, the arterial  $O_2$  content is reduced and a blood transfusion is required to improve oxygen content and transport. In some cases, refractory hypoxemic

respiratory failure can be treated with PEEP or CPAP (see Chapter 13). When hypoxemia is accompanied by an increase in WOB or a rising P<sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> and a falling pH, mechanical ventilation is required. <sup>3,22</sup> Mask CPAP and oxygen alone are not considered effective treatments for hypoxemia in patients with acute lung injury, and intubation is usually required (Key Point 4.5). <sup>23</sup>

## OVERVIEW OF CRITERIA FOR MECHANICAL VENTILATION

The standard criteria for instituting mechanical ventilatory support are listed in Box 4.5. Apnea and impending respiratory failure and arrest are the most obvious indications for invasive ventilation. Current indications for invasive ventilation are shown in Box 4.6.<sup>3</sup>

Reversibility of the underlying disease should always be a consideration. The clinician must consider the patient's medical history, physical assessment, ABG evaluation, lung mechanics measurements, prognosis, and advanced directives (i.e., patient's wishes) when deciding whether to intubate and ventilate a patient's lungs. Thoughtful clinical judgment is essential, as is attention to

where Hb is hemoglobin in grams per deciliter of whole blood (g%),  $S_aO_2$  is arterial oxygen saturation, and  $P_aO_2$  is the partial pressure of arterial oxygen in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).

- · Acute ventilatory failure
- · Impending ventilatory failure
- Refractory hypoxemic respiratory failure with increased work of breathing or an ineffective breathing pattern

#### BOX 4.6 Indications for Invasive Mechanical Ventilation in Adults With Acute Respiratory Failure

Invasive mechanical ventilation is indicated in any of the following circumstances:

- 1. Apnea or impending respiratory arrest
- 2. Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\* with dyspnea, tachypnea, and acute respiratory acidosis (hypercapnia and decreased arterial pH) plus at least one of the following:
  - Acute cardiovascular instability
  - · Altered mental status or persistent uncooperativeness
  - Inability to protect the lower airway
  - · Copious or unusually viscous secretions
  - · Abnormalities of the face or upper airway that would prevent effective noninvasive positive pressure ventilation
- 3. Acute ventilatory insufficiency in cases of neuromuscular disease accompanied by any of the following:
  - · Acute respiratory acidosis (hypercapnia and decreased
  - Progressive decline in vital capacity to below 10 to 15 mL/kg
  - Progressive decline in maximum inspiratory pressure to below -20 to -30 cm  $H_2O$
- 4. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with tachypnea, respiratory distress, and persistent hypoxemia despite administration of a high fraction of inspired oxygen (F<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) with high-flow oxygen devices or in the presence of any of the following:
  - Acute cardiovascular instability

- · Altered mental status or persistent uncooperativeness
- Inability to protect the lower airway
- 5. Need for endotracheal intubation to maintain or protect the airway or manage secretions, given the following factors:

\*Also applies to life-threatening asthma if respiratory acidosis or airflow obstruction has worsened despite aggressive management with bronchodilators and other therapy.

**New Point 4.6** Protecting the patient's airway is critical with conditions such as stroke, drug overdose, cerebral damage, and copious or viscous secretions

the goals of therapy for a mechanically ventilated patient<sup>3,4</sup> (Key Point 4.6):

- 1. Support the pulmonary system so that it can maintain an adequate level of alveolar ventilation
- 2. Reduce the work of breathing until the cause of respiratory failure can be identified and treated
- 3. Restore arterial and systemic acid—base balances to levels that are normal for the patient
- 4. Increase oxygen delivery to and oxygenation of body organs
- 5. Prevent complications associated with mechanical ventilation

#### **POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES TO INVASIVE VENTILATION**

In some cases, using a more conservative approach may avoid the need for invasive ventilation. Providing supplemental oxygen through standard oxygen therapy devices or through more specialized respiratory therapy devices (e.g., high-flow nasal cannula) may help relieve hypoxemia. For example, high-flow nasal cannula therapy allows the delivery of high gas flows through a narrow tube (e.g., nasal or transtracheal cannula).<sup>18</sup>

Placing the patient in an upright or Fowler position and providing appropriate medications can also be used to avoid the need for mechanical ventilation. However, the clinician must always keep in mind that hypoxemia can arise from a variety of causes, and these causes should be the focus of therapy. Oxygen therapy, repositioning the patient, and administration of medications such as bronchodilators and mucolytics are palliative measures that usually provide only transient relief of hypoxemia. They do not eliminate the cause.

#### **Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation**

In some patients, NIV is a viable alternative to invasive positive pressure ventilation and may be a means of avoiding endotracheal intubation.<sup>23</sup> NIV is the treatment of choice for acute-on-chronic respiratory failure unless cardiovascular instability is also a factor. The use of NIV for acute-on-chronic respiratory failure has been shown to reduce the need for intubation, reduce complications of ventilation, shorten the hospital stay, and reduce hospital mortality rates. It is important to recognize that the patient must meet the criteria for NIV and must not have any of the exclusionary factors (Box 4.7). 21,26-29 Invasive ventilation with intubation is indicated if any of the contraindications for NIV listed in Box 4.7 are present.27,2

Although this approach is controversial, NIV may be beneficial for patients with ARF associated with cardiogenic pulmonary edema.<sup>26</sup> Acute-on-chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure in patients with musculoskeletal problems (e.g., kyphoscoliosis and postpolio syndrome) may be well suited to NIV. NIV is also an alternative to invasive ventilator support for patients with hypercapnic acute exacerbation of COPD and considered a standard of

#### BOX **4.7**

#### Indications and Contraindications for Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation in Adults<sup>29,30</sup>

#### Indications

At least two of the following factors should be present:

- Respiratory rate >25 breaths/min
- Moderate to severe acidosis: pH, 7.25 to 7.30; PaCO<sub>2</sub>, 45 to 60 mm Hg
- Moderate to severe dyspnea with use of accessory muscles and paradoxical breathing pattern

#### **Contraindications**

Any of the following factors alone is a contraindication.

#### **Absolute Contraindications**

- Respiratory arrest
- Cardiac arrest
- Cardiovascular instability (hypotension, dysrhythmias, acute myocardial infarction)

- Nonrespiratory organ failure (e.g., severe encephalopathy, severe gastrointestinal bleeding or surgery, hemodynamic instability with or without unstable cardiac angina)
- · Patent tracheoesophageal fistula
- Inability to protect the airway or high risk for aspiration (or both)
- Uncooperative patient (impaired mental status, hypersomnolence)
- · Facial or head surgery or trauma

#### **Relative Contraindications**

- · Copious or viscous secretions
- · Fixed nasopharyngeal abnormalities
- · Extreme obesity

### BOX **4.8**

### Circumstances in Which Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation Should Be Changed to Invasive Ventilation

- · Respiratory arrest
- Respiratory rate >35 breaths/min
- Severe dyspnea with use of accessory muscles and possibly paradoxical breathing
- Life-threatening hypoxemia:  $PaO_2$  <40 mm Hg or  $PaO_2$ /  $FIO_2$  <200
- Severe acidosis (pH <7.25) and hypercapnia (PaCO $_2$  >60 mm Hg)
- Hypersomnolence, impaired mental status
- Cardiovascular complications (hypotension, shock, heart failure)
- Failure of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation
- Other circumstances (e.g., metabolic abnormalities, sepsis, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, barotrauma, massive pleural effusion)

care for these patients (Box 4.8).<sup>29,30</sup> In fact, NIV is an effective method of resting the ventilatory muscles and averting invasive ventilation in this latter group of patients. However, patients with neuromuscular disorders who develop acute respiratory acidosis and evidence of muscle weakness that progressively worsens (decreasing MIP and VC) require prompt intubation to prevent ARF and protect the airway.<sup>3</sup>

Invasive ventilation is also indicated for patients with severe refractory hypoxemia associated with increased WOB. These patients may suffer adverse events if mask CPAP is used for treatment rather than invasive ventilation.<sup>29,30</sup> Even with appropriately selected patients and skilled clinicians, NIV has been shown to be ineffective and endotracheal intubation is required.<sup>27,28,30</sup> (Chapter 19 discusses many additional important aspects of NIV.)

#### **Intubation Without Ventilation**

Some adult patients must be intubated because of an airway obstruction or to protect the airway or facilitate the removal of secretions (Key Point 4.6). If no other indications for ventilatory support are present and if a 7-mm endotracheal tube or larger is

used, it is reasonable to conclude that IPPV is not needed. WOB related to the resistance of the endotracheal tube is considered significant only in small tubes (<7 mm) and when the minute ventilation is high (over 10 L/min)<sup>3,31</sup> (see Chapter 17 for additional information on the work of breathing through an artificial airway).

#### **Ethical Considerations**

Ethical considerations must be part of the decision-making process before initiating mechanical ventilation. First and foremost, does the patient want to be on ventilatory support? If the patient is unable to answer, it is important to determine whether the patient has a designated surrogate. Does the patient have a living will, advance directive, or similar legal document indicating his or her wishes regarding life support procedures? These significant concerns must be addressed. Invasive ventilation is contraindicated when it is contrary to the patient's advance directives. It also might be considered contraindicated if its use would be medically pointless and futile. If no reasonable chance exists that ventilation would extend a person's quality of life in a meaningful way, it is probably contraindicated.<sup>3</sup>

#### (🔨) Clinical Scenario: Drug Overdose

A 23-year-old woman is taken to the hospital after ingesting an unknown amount of drugs and alcohol. Friends found her unconscious in her apartment. On admission to the emergency department, she is unconscious and unresponsive to verbal commands. Her pulse is 124 beats/min and blood pressure is 85/50 mm Hg. Her respiratory rate is 15 breaths/min, and respirations are shallow. ABG values on room air are as follows:  $P_aO_2 = 60$  mm Hg,  $P_aCO_2 = 69$  mm Hg, and  $P_aCO_2 = 60$  mm Hg, and  $P_aCO_2 = 60$  mm Hg, are the sounds reveal bilateral coarse crackles, especially in the bases.

Drugs and alcohol are known to depress the respiratory centers of the brain and also reduce the normal glottic response. The patient's shallow breathing is most likely caused by the substances ingested. Crackles heard over the right middle lobe may be because of aspiration. Weakening of the normal glottic

response causes failure of the glottis to protect the airway, which is important to recognize because drug overdose and alcohol can cause nausea and vomiting.

The ABG values reported indicate ARF. The clinician's first priority is to protect the airway through intubation and provide ventilation to normalize blood gases. With drug overdose the patient can sometimes be treated pharmacologically, depending on the types of drugs ingested. For example, narcotic overdoses can be treated with naloxone hydrochloride (Narcan), an opioid antagonist. (NOTE: Narcan is used only to reverse the CNS and ventilatory depression caused by a narcotic overdose.) Determining the type and quantity of drugs ingested can provide valuable information to guide the immediate treatment of the patient.

#### 🔊 Clinical Scenario: Guillain-Barré

A 30-year-old man is admitted to the hospital emergency department complaining of weakness of the limbs, tingling of the hands and feet, and increasing lack of coordination. Two weeks previously he had been treated for a flulike illness. The respiratory care practitioner obtains a baseline ABG evaluation, which is within normal limits. MIP is  $-70 \text{ cm H}_2\text{O}$ , and VC is 4.3 L (predicted, 4.8 L).

Over a 36-hour period, VC, MIP,  $V_T$ ,  $S_pO_2$ , and respiratory rate are monitored every 3 to 4 hours. Values progressively decrease to a VC of 2.1 L (44% of predicted [23 mL/kg]) and an MIP of -32 cm  $H_2O$ . A repeat ABG evaluation on room air shows the following:  $P_aO_2=70$  mm Hg,  $P_aCo_2=48$  mm Hg, and pH=7.34.

The diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome was made on the basis of the patient's history and physical findings. Given the

patient's diagnosis and clinical findings, the physician decides to intubate him and begin respiratory support. Guillain-Barré syndrome is a rapidly progressive, ascending, bilateral, flaccid muscle paralysis. Once it begins, it can progress to affect the respiratory muscles and other skeletal muscles.

Often, in neuromuscular disorders, an effective drug therapy is not available to reverse the progression of paralysis. When respiratory mechanics begin to deteriorate, patients are often intubated or provided with invasive respiratory support before the respiratory mechanics reach a critical value. Interestingly, ABG values and oxygen saturations may often be within normal limits. However, the clinician must remember that it is better to act early than to wait for respiratory arrest.

![](_page_11_Picture_16.jpeg)

#### Clinical Scenario: Asthma

A 15-year-old girl with a life-threatening exacerbation of asthma has been treated in the emergency department over several hours. Administration of oxygen, corticosteroids, heliox, and aerosolized  $\beta$ -2 adrenergic bronchodilators and ipratropium bromide, although appropriate, has not been effective in reducing airway obstruction and WOB. The patient has a respiratory rate of 37 breaths/min and her breathing is labored. Bilateral inspiratory and expiratory wheezes are present in both lungs. PEF is 70 L/min and FEV<sub>1</sub> is 0.75 L. ABG values obtained while the patient is breathing 50% oxygen are as follows:  $P_aO_2 = 73$  mm Hg,  $P_aCO_2 = 28$  mm Hg,  $P_aCO_3 = 19$  mEq/L,  $P_aCO_4 = 7.46$ .  $P_aO_2/P_AO_4$  is 0.23.

Hyperventilation in moderate or severe attacks of asthma is probably localized to areas of the lung where resistance to flow is lowest. Other areas of the lung are typically underventilated, resulting in shunting and reduced oxygenation. The length of time that a patient can tolerate this amount of work and hypoxemia varies considerably. If the persistent bronchospasm and mucus

plugging cannot be alleviated,  $P_aCO_2$  will rise despite a high minute ventilation. In some cases patients may begin to fatigue and progress to ARF. (A good indication that ARF is imminent is a marked decrease in breath sounds [i.e., silent chest].)

Continuous nebulization is started, and after 2 hours of treatment, the patient's ABG values are as follows:  $P_aO_2=75$  mm Hg on 80% oxygen,  $P_aCO_2=56$  mm Hg,  $HCO_3-=28$  mEq/L, pH=7.31.  $\dot{v}/\dot{Q}_E$  is 18 L/min.

Serious consideration must be given to intubating the patient under mild sedation and initiating mechanical ventilatory support. This decision is often difficult to make for a fully conscious, distressed patient. Even the use of sedation is controversial. Unfortunately, invasive ventilation may be the only alternative. If no intervention is taken, a reduction in previously strong respiratory efforts sometimes occurs. Rates and tidal volumes may start to fall. The patient may become stuporous or uncontrollably agitated, both of which are often signs of fatigue.

This situation is an example of impending respiratory failure in which aggressive care is required to prevent respiratory failure or possibly cardiopulmonary arrest. NIV may be contraindicated or insufficient for these patients.<sup>33</sup> If NIV is initiated, and the patient's PaCO2 rises and a severe acidosis develops during NIV, a strong argument can be made for intubation and ventilation.<sup>32</sup> Some clinicians start ventilatory support when the PaCO2 rises to normal in the

presence of high minute ventilation (this would indicate an increased V<sub>D</sub>/V<sub>T</sub>); they do not wait for the P<sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> to exceed 45 mm Hg. Other clinicians use evidence of cardiac failure and a drop in pulse intensity in addition to the presence of dysrhythmias as criteria for intubation and initiating mechanical ventilation. Deterioration in mental status and exhaustion can also be important indicators for intubation and mechanical ventilation.3

#### Clinical Scenario: Chronic Restrictive Disorder

An 83-year-old woman with severe kyphoscoliosis is admitted to the hospital from a long-term care facility. She is diagnosed with pneumonia. Evaluation of the patient reveals that she is weak and pale and has decreased skin turgor (Key Point 4.7). Blood pressure is 110/72 mm Hg, and heart rate is 110 beats/ min. Respiratory rate is 28 breaths/min, and breaths are shallow. Breath sounds reveal bilateral crackles scattered throughout both lungs. After 3 days of hospitalization and antibiotic therapy, the patient's condition appears to be progressively worsening. ABG results while the patient receives

supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula (2 L/min) are as follows:  $P_aO_2 = 58 \text{ mm Hg}$ ,  $P_aCO_2 = 68 \text{ mm Hg}$ , pH = 7.24. The decision is made to intubate the patient and begin ventilatory

The combination of her severe, chronic, restrictive disorder and the unresolved pneumonia have contributed to the deteriorating gas exchange, which indicates ARF and the need for invasive ventilation.3 No advance directives were available to indicate the patient's wishes regarding invasive ventilation.

#### A Clinical Scenario: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Congestive Heart Failure

A 78-year-old man with a history of COPD and chronic congestive heart failure is admitted to the hospital. He has been admitted to the hospital three times during the past 9 months. The patient has a history of noncompliance with his medications and continues to smoke. He has a long and continued history of alcohol abuse.<sup>25</sup>

The patient is given oxygen therapy via nasal cannula (2 L/min). His respiratory rate is 18 breaths/min. Expirations are prolonged, and he demonstrates pursed-lip breathing and use of his accessory muscles of breathing. The patient is pale and appears anxious. Heart rate and blood pressure are elevated. Auscultation of his chest reveals breath sounds with scattered wheezes and crackles. Sputum is thin and frothy. Current ABG values on an estimated F<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub> of 0.28 are as follows: P<sub>a</sub>O<sub>2</sub> = 55 mm Hg,  $P_aCO_2 = 74$  mm Hg,  $HCO_3 - = 34$  mEq/L, pH =

With an increasing PaCO2, moderately severe respiratory acidosis, and an apparently increased WOB, this patient demonstrates all the signs of respiratory distress. On the basis of the patient's history, the attending physician undoubtedly would have to determine which medications would be appropriate for both the patient's heart failure and his respiratory problems. Blood gas values and respiratory assessment support the need for intervention to improve the patient's ventilation and reduce WOB before his condition becomes more critical.

The presence of acute congestive heart failure is one of the exclusionary criteria for NIV in patients with acute-on-chronic COPD. This patient probably needs invasive ventilation. Several measures can be attempted, but they should not preclude intubation if the patient's condition worsens. Two simple measures that can be attempted are continuing oxygen therapy and maintaining the patient in an upright or semi-Fowler position.<sup>23</sup> Determining the patient's wishes is also important. Does he want aggressive support if it becomes necessary? If the patient does not want to be intubated, NIV could be used, particularly considering the alternative if no ventilation is provided.

Key Point 4.7 A simple test for dehydration involves gently pinching the skin on the back of the patient's hand. If the skin quickly returns to its normal position, skin turgor is normal. If the skin remains puckered, skin turgor is decreased and the patient is probably dehydrated.

#### SUMMARY

 The ability to recognize that a patient requires an artificial airway and mechanical ventilation is an essential skill for practitioners.

- Decisions made in the acute care setting must be based on evidence-based criteria that clearly demonstrate that a particular technique is beneficial and associated with good outcomes, such as improved quality of life, reduced length of stay, or a lower mortality rate.
- ARF is defined as an inability to maintain adequate oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide clearance.
- Two types of ARF are hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypercapnic respiratory failure.
- Hypoxemic respiratory failure can be treated with oxygen or in combination with PEEP or CPAP.
- Acute hypercapnic respiratory failure occurs when a person cannot maintain adequate ventilation to maintain  $P_aCO_2$ .
- The primary physiological objectives of mechanical ventilation should include supporting or improving pulmonary gas exchange, increasing lung volume, and reducing the WOB.
- Simple and direct observations can provide valuable information about the cause of respiratory distress and serve as a guide for selecting an appropriate therapeutic strategy.

- Recognizing the clinical signs of hypoxemia and hypercapnia is the first step to successful treatment of a patient in respiratory distress.
- The onset of respiratory failure can vary considerably depending on the cause of the neuromuscular dysfunction.
- The MIP and VC can be used to assess the respiratory muscle strength of patients with neuromuscular disorders. Determination of baseline ABGs along with periodic measurement of S<sub>p</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is also appropriate for the management of these patients.
- WOB normally accounts for 1% to 4% of total oxygen consumption at rest. Increased WOB is typically associated with an increased rate or depth of breathing (or both).
- VC, PEF, respiratory rate,  $^{\dot{V}}/^{\dot{Q}}_{E}$ , and  $V_{D}/V_{T}$  can provide valuable information about a patient's status and alert the clinician to impending respiratory dysfunction.
- Standard criteria for initiation of mechanical ventilation include apnea, impending or confirmed ARF, and refractory hypoxemia characterized by an increased WOB or an ineffective breathing pattern.
- NIV offers a viable alternative to invasive mechanical ventilation in select patients.
