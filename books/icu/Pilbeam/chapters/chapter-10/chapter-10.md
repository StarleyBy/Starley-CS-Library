Procedures and devices such as pulse oximetry, capnography (capnometry), transcutaneous monitoring of blood gases, exhaled nitric oxide (NO), indirect calorimetry, and bedside lung function testing have made it possible for respiratory therapists to monitor respiratory function noninvasively in mechanically ventilated patients. When it is used appropriately, noninvasive monitoring can provide valuable information for clinicians managing patients receiving ventilatory support. However, if it is used indiscriminately, it can be distracting and confusing for the clinician and economically costly for the patient.

# NONINVASIVE MEASUREMENTS OF BLOOD GASES

# **Pulse Oximetry**

Hypoxemic events in mechanically ventilated patients are most often associated with apnea, airway obstruction, equipment failure or disconnection, and incorrect gas flow settings. Visual recognition of hypoxemia by physical examination is often unreliable because of intraobserver variability, differences in patients' skin pigmentation, and interference by ambient lighting.<sup>1,2</sup> Laboratory measurement of arterial blood gases (ABGs) remains the gold standard for measuring the level of hypoxemia (see Evolve website for a review of ABGs); however, this procedure is performed intermittently and may fail to detect transient hypoxic episodes.

Pulse oximetry provides continuous, noninvasive measurements of arterial oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) saturation.<sup>3</sup> A sensor is placed over a digit, an earlobe, the forehead, or the bridge of the nose; this sensor measures the absorption of selected wavelengths of light beamed through the tissue (Fig. 10.1). For example, oxyhemoglobin can be differentiated from deoxygenated hemoglobin by shining two wavelengths of light (660 and 940 nm) through the sampling site. As Fig. 10.2 illustrates, at a wavelength of 660 nm (red light), deoxygenated hemoglobin absorbs more light than oxyhemoglobin. Conversely, oxyhemoglobin absorbs more light at 940 nm (infrared [IR] light) than does deoxygenated hemoglobin.

Pulse rate is determined by relating cyclical changes in light transmission through the sampling site with blood volume changes that occur during ventricular systole and diastole. That is, as local (e.g., finger, toe, or earlobe) blood volume increases during ventricular systole, light absorbency increases and transmitted light decreases. In contrast, as blood volume decreases during diastole, absorbency decreases and transmitted light increases. Fig. 10.3 illustrates the pulsatile or alternating current (AC) and nonpulsatile or direct current (DC) components of a typical pulse oximetry signal.

Fig. 10.2 Absorption characteristics of four types of hemoglobin: reduced hemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin, carboxyhemoglobin, and methemoglobin.

The percentage of oxyhemoglobin present can be determined by first calculating the ratio of absorbencies for pulsatile and nonpulsatile flow, at the two specified wavelengths, or

$$\frac{Red}{Infrared} = \frac{\frac{Pulsatile_{660nm}}{NonPulsatile_{660nm}} \div Pulsatile_{940nm}}{NonPulsatile_{940nm}}$$

This ratio is then applied to an algorithm that relates ratios of these two absorbencies to oxyhemoglobin saturation.<sup>4</sup>

# **Physiological and Technical Concerns**

Pulse oximeters are generally accurate for  $O_2$  saturations greater than 80%.  $^{5,6}$  Pulse oximeter saturations less than 80% should be confirmed with laboratory analysis of ABGs, including CO-oximetry. A number of physiological and technical factors can influence the accuracy of pulse oximetry measurements, including low perfusion states, the presence of dysfunctional hemoglobins and dyes, variations in patients' skin pigmentation, and ambient light interference. The following is a summary of various factors that can influence pulse oximetry readings. A more detailed discussion of each of these factors can be found in the references listed at the end of this chapter.

**Low Perfusion States.** It should be apparent that the accuracy of a pulse oximeter reading depends on the identification of an arterial pulse. In cases in which perfusion is low, such as hypovolemia, the pulse oximeter may not be able to accurately identify a pulsatile signal, resulting in either an intermittent or absent  $S_pO_2$  reading. Other situations that may contribute to this problem include administering peripheral vasoconstrictors, hypothermia, and heart-lung bypass (i.e., extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). Although some oximeters are better than others in dealing with low perfusion states, compensation for the weak signal associated with low perfusion states is limited. The reason for this limitation is that a low perfusion state produces a low signal-to-noise ratio and thus a signal that can potentially be altered by motion artifacts.

![](_page_2_Figure_9.jpeg)

**Fig. 10.3** Output signal generated by pulse oximeter illustrating pulsatile and nonpulsatile components. Saturation is based on the ratio of light absorption during pulsatile and baseline phases. (From Kacmarek RM, Stoller JK, Stoller, Heuer AJ: *Egan's fundamentals of respiratory care*, ed 12, St. Louis, MO, 2021, Elsevier.)

The Masimo Signal Extraction Technology (SET) (Masimo Corp, Irvine, CA) pulse oximeter is a relatively new processing system that uses special algorithms to minimize interference from motion artifacts. Conventional pulse oximetry assumes that arterial blood accounts for the pulsations, or AC component, of the pulse oximetry signal and venous blood produces a nonpulsatile, or DC component, of the signal. During patient motion, venous blood may contribute to the pulsatile signal and cause the pulse oximeter to underestimate the SpO2 because it cannot distinguish between arterial and venous blood. Masimo SET signal processing identifies the venous blood signal, isolates it, and, using adaptive filters, cancels the noise and extracts the arterial signal. When tested on healthy individuals simulating various motion artifacts, the Masimo SET oximeter exhibited a much lower error rate compared with conventional pulse oximeters. Studies with critically ill patients also demonstrated fewer false alarms of hypoxemia compared with conventional pulse oximeters.<sup>10</sup>

**Dysfunctional Hemoglobins and Dyes.** Adult blood typically contains four types of hemoglobin: reduced or deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb), oxyhemoglobin (O<sub>2</sub>Hb), carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), and methemoglobin (MetHb). Two terms that are often used when describing O<sub>2</sub>Hb saturation are fractional and functional saturations. **Fractional hemoglobin saturation** is calculated by dividing the amount of O<sub>2</sub>Hb measured by the sum of concentrations of all four types of hemoglobin present, or

Fractional 
$$O_2Hb = O_2Hb / [HHb + O_2Hb + COHb + MetHb]$$

Functional hemoglobin saturation is calculated by dividing the  $O_2Hb$  concentration by the concentration of hemoglobin capable of carrying  $O_2$ , or

$$Fractional O_2 Hb \, = \frac{O_2 Hb}{[HHb+O_2 Hb]} \label{eq:proposition}$$

Laboratory CO-oximeters measure all four types of hemoglobin by using separate wavelengths of light to identify each species, whereas pulse oximeters use only two wavelengths to quantify the amount of  $O_2Hb$  and HHb present. Laboratory CO-oximeters are therefore capable of reporting fractional  $O_2Hb$  saturations, and pulse oximeters are typically described as evaluating functional hemoglobin saturations.

This description of a pulse oximeter capability may be somewhat misleading because, as Fig. 10.2 shows,  $O_2Hb$  and COHb have similar absorption coefficients for red light (660 nm), whereas COHb is relatively transparent to IR light (940 nm). Additionally, MetHb and HHb have the same absorption coefficients for red light; however, MetHb demonstrates a greater absorbency for IR light (940 nm) than does  $O_2Hb$ . Accordingly, the presence of significant levels of COHb, as occurs in carbon monoxide poisoning, will lead to an overestimation of  $S_pO_2$  (Key Point 10.1). Methemoglobinemia, a potential complication of administering nitric oxide, benzocaine (topical anesthetic), and dapsone (an antibiotic used to treat malaria and *Pneumocystis* 

**Key Point 10.1** Abnormal hemoglobin, such as carboxyhemoglobin (smoke exposure), produces an erroneously high  $S_pO_2$ . If abnormal hemoglobin levels are suspected, a CO-oximeter should be used to evaluate the oxygen saturation.

*jiroveci*), can cause erroneous  $S_pO_2$  values because MetHb absorbs both red and IR light.<sup>6,11</sup> If enough MetHb is present to dominate all pulsatile absorption, the pulse oximeter will measure a ratio of red to IR of 1:1, corresponding to an  $S_pO_2$  of about 85%. Consequently, the pulse oximeter reading will overestimate or underestimate the *true oxyhemoglobin* saturation, depending on whether the actual  $S_aO_2$  is less than or greater than 85%.<sup>9,11</sup>

It is well documented that intravascular dyes can adversely affect  $S_pO_2$  values by absorbing a portion of the incident light emitted by the pulse oximeter diodes. Scheller and colleagues<sup>12</sup> demonstrated that injection of methylene blue and indigo carmine into human volunteers caused a false drop in  $S_pO_2$ , whereas indocyanine green had little effect on pulse oximeter values.

**Nail Polish.** Nail polish (particularly blue and black nail polish) can affect S<sub>p</sub>O<sub>2</sub> readings. It has been suggested that nail polish causes light to be shunted around the finger periphery (called optical shunting).<sup>13,14</sup> The transmitted light never comes in contact with the vascular bed; consequently, SpO<sub>2</sub> values can be erroneously high or low, depending on whether this light takes on a pulsatile character. Placing the device over the lateral aspects of the digit rather than over the nail can largely alleviate this problem.

**Skin Pigmentation.** Theoretically, skin pigmentation should have no effect on pulse oximeter readings. In practice, however,  $S_pO_2$  readings are typically higher for patients with dark skin pigmentation. For example, an  $S_pO_2$  of 95% in an African American patient may actually represent an  $S_aO_2$  of only 92%. The Many clinicians therefore use higher threshold values (i.e.,  $S_pO_2 > 92\%$ ) for initiating  $O_2$  therapy in African American patients. Although using higher target  $S_pO_2$  values does not lead to untreated hypoxemia in most of these patients, some will have arterial  $O_2$  pressure  $(P_aO_2)$  values as high as 200 mm Hg when therapy is based on measured  $S_pO_2$ .

Bilirubin, a breakdown product of heme metabolism, is the pigment responsible for the yellow discoloration seen in jaundiced patients. Although an elevated bilirubin level (>20 mg/dL) has been shown to affect  $O_2Hb$  values recorded with CO-oximetry, pulse oximetry measurements do not appear to be affected by hyperbilirubinemia.  $^{18,19}$ 

**Ambient Light.** Direct sunlight and external light sources (e.g., fluorescent lights, heat lamps, fiberoptic light sources, surgical lamps) have been shown to affect  $S_pO_2$  readings adversely. Most commercially available pulse oximeters attempt to compensate for this interference by continually cycling the transmitted red and IR light on and off at a rate of about 480 cycles per second.

#### **Clinical Applications**

The usefulness of pulse oximetry as an early warning system for detecting hypoxemia in patients with unstable oxygenation status is well recognized. Pulse oximetry is an excellent trending device in critically ill patients, providing a continuous display of  $O_2$  saturation. However, changes in  $S_pO_2$  may not represent an equivalent change in actual  $S_aO_2$ . This discrepancy is particularly evident when pulse oximetry is used in the neonatal intensive care unit (ICU). Although it is generally used to trend  $O_2$  saturations in neonates, pulse oximetry is not used as a basis for prescribing  $O_2$  therapy in neonates; most neonatologists prefer to base  $O_2$  therapy decisions on  $P_aO_2$  rather than  $O_2$  saturation.

**Fig. 10.4** Oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve for arterial blood. *2,3 DPG,* Diphosphoglycerate.

A review of the relationship between SaO2 and PaO2 (i.e., the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve) is helpful before the use of pulse oximetry to detect hypoxemia is discussed. S<sub>a</sub>O<sub>2</sub> varies with the P<sub>a</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in a sigmoidal or S-shaped manner. (See Fig. 10.4 for the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve for arterial blood.) For O2 saturations greater than 90% saturation, PaO2 may rise considerably without much change in S<sub>a</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. When saturation is less than 80%, the PO<sub>2</sub> values fall rapidly. Although an S<sub>a</sub>O<sub>2</sub> of 97% is considered normal, maintaining an O2Hb saturation of at least 90% is considered acceptable for adult patients. As a result, many algorithms for O2 therapy typically use 90% or slightly higher as an indication for increasing the fractional inspired O2 concentration (F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). (As mentioned, because dark skin pigmentation can lead to erroneously high S<sub>p</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, many clinicians use a threshold of 94% -95% for these patients as an indication for adjusting the  $F_1O_2$ .) In the case of hyperoxygenation, pulse oximeters can provide limited information about PaO2 values because of the flat portion of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve above 90%.

Several criteria should be met to ensure that pulse oximetry values are meaningful. Box 10.1 contains a summary of the American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC) clinical practice guidelines for pulse oximetry. These guidelines provide valuable information that practitioners should use to determine whether  $S_pO_2$  values are valid.

Advances in light-emitting diode technology have led to simplification of pulse oximeter transmitters and sensors, making them easy to use and available at a relatively low cost. Pulse oximetry probes are available in neonatal, pediatric, and adult sizes. The response time of the pulse oximeter (i.e., the time required for the pulse oximeter to detect a change in central oxygenation level [left-heart PO<sub>2</sub>]) depends on the location of the probe. The lag time is shortest for probes placed on the earlobe; on the finger, the lag time is longer by 12 seconds or more than for the earlobe; and probes placed on the toe have the longest lag time.

# Summary of the American Association for Respiratory Care Clinical Practice Guideline for Pulse Oximetry

#### Indications

On the basis of current evidence, pulse oximetry is useful for the following:

- 1. Monitoring arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation
- 2. Quantifying the arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation response to therapeutic intervention
- 3. Monitoring arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation during bronchoscopy

#### **Contraindications**

Pulse oximetry may not be appropriate in situations in which measurements of pH,  $P_aCO_2$ , and total hemoglobin are required. The presence of abnormal hemoglobin may be a relative contraindication.

#### Limitations

A number of factors, agents, and situations can affect readings and limit precision and performance of pulse oximetry. These include the following:

- 1. Motion artifacts
- 2. Abnormal hemoglobin (particularly carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin)
- 3. Intravascular dyes
- 4. Exposure of the measuring sensor to ambient light sources
- 5. Low perfusion states
- 6. Skin pigmentation
- 7. Nail polish
- 8. Low oxyhemoglobin saturations (i.e., below 83%)

#### **Monitoring**

The following information should be recorded during pulse oximetry:

- 1. Probe type and site of measurement, date and time of measurement, patient position, activity level
- 2. F<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and mode of supplemental O<sub>2</sub> delivery
- 3. Arterial blood gas measurements and CO-oximetry results that may have been made simultaneously
- 4. Clinical appearance of the patient (presence of cyanosis, skin temperature)
- Agreement between pulse oximeter heart rate and heart rate determined by palpation or electrocardiographic recordings

From AARC Clinical Practice Guideline: Pulse oximetry, *Respir Care* 37:891—897, 1992.

As mentioned earlier, pulse oximetry is used routinely to monitor continuously the oxygenation status of critically ill patients with unstable oxygenation status and to monitor  $O_2$  saturation during surgery and bronchoscopy. Pulse oximetry can be particularly useful in the ICU for titrating  $F_1O_2$  and positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) in mechanically ventilated patients and for monitoring the oxygenation status of patients undergoing chest physical therapy and suctioning.<sup>22</sup>

Although pulse oximetry can be effective when prescribing  $\mathrm{O}_2$  therapy in hospitalized patients, it may not be as useful in

# Case Study 10.1

# **Causes of Cyanosis**

You are preparing a patient for bronchoscopy. As you are administering an aerosol treatment with benzocaine, you note that the patient appears to be cyanotic but does not demonstrate any signs of distress. Pulse oximetry readings indicate that the  $\rm S_pO_2$  is 85%. You immediately obtain arterial blood gases that demonstrate a pH of 7.36, PCO<sub>2</sub> of 42 Torr, and PO<sub>2</sub> of 80 Torr. Explain the cause of the cyanosis. What diagnostic test would confirm this explanation?

prescribing  $O_2$  therapy for homecare patients. Carlin and colleagues<sup>25</sup> demonstrated that the use of pulse oximetry only can disqualify a significant number of patients applying for reimbursement for  $O_2$  therapy. Under the guidelines of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a patient must demonstrate a  $P_aO_2$  of 55 Torr or lower or a saturation of 88% or lower to qualify for  $O_2$  therapy.<sup>24</sup> It is important to recognize that any of the previously mentioned physiological or technical problems can significantly affect  $S_pO_2$  measurements. To resolve this problem, invasive ABG analyses should be done in chronically ill patients to establish the need for  $O_2$  therapy. Case Study 10.1 involves pulse oximetry.

# **CAPNOGRAPHY (CAPNOMETRY)**

Capnography is the measurement of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations in respired gases. Although the terms *capnography* and *capnometry* are often thought to be synonymous, capnography describes the continuous display of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations as a graphic waveform called a *capnogram*; capnometry involves the display of exhaled CO<sub>2</sub> numerically without a waveform.<sup>27,28</sup>

#### **Technical Considerations**

Both chemical and spectroscopic methods can be used to perform capnometry. Chemical devices that rely on a disposable colorimetric detector provide **qualitative** estimates of exhaled CO<sub>2</sub>. Spectroscopic devices (e.g., IR, Raman, acoustic, mass spectroscopy) provide **quantitative** data on the concentration of expired CO<sub>2</sub>. Because chemical and IR analyzers are most often used for mechanically ventilated patients in the critical care setting, the following discussion will focus on these devices.

#### **Chemical Methods**

Chemical (colorimetric) capnometers are handheld devices composed of specially treated filter paper in a plastic casing that can be attached to the patient's endotracheal tube (ET) (Fig. 10.5). The amount of  $\rm CO_2$  present in the patient's inspired and exhaled gas can be estimated by noting the color changes in the filter paper. For example, the Nellcor Adult/Pediatric Colorimetric  $\rm CO_2$  Detectors (Medtronics Minimally Invasive Therapies, Minneapolis, MN) respond to exhaled  $\rm CO_2$  with a simple color change from purple to yellow. The color changes correspond to  $\rm CO_2$  concentration ranges, which are displayed on the device: "A" corresponds to a range of approximately 0.03% to less than 0.5%  $\rm CO_2$  (<4 mm

![](_page_5_Picture_3.jpeg)

Hg); "B" indicates a range of 0.5% to <2.0% (4 to <15 mm Hg); and "C" indicates a range of 2.0% to 5.0% (15-38 mm Hg).

Chemical capnometers are particularly useful in emergency situations in assessing airway placement.<sup>29</sup> It is important to understand that changes in the color of the filter paper are the result of a chemical reaction that affects the pH of the filter paper. (Note that if acidic liquids such as regurgitated gastric contents contact the filter paper, an irreversible color change will occur and render the device unusable.) Proper placement of an ET can be determined because the color of the paper will change continually as inhaled and exhaled CO<sub>2</sub> levels vary while the patient breathes into and out of the device. In some cases, ET placement in the trachea rather than the stomach may be difficult to determine because the patient's gastric PCO<sub>2</sub> may be elevated after receiving mouth-to-mouth breathing or if the patient has recently ingested a carbonated beverage.

# **Infrared Spectroscopy**

IR spectroscopy is based on the principle that molecules containing more than one element absorb IR light in a characteristic manner. CO<sub>2</sub> absorbs IR radiation maximally at 4.26  $\mu$ m. The concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in a gas sample can be estimated because its concentration is directly related to the amount of IR light absorbed. The presence of other gases (e.g., water [H<sub>2</sub>O] and nitrous oxide [N<sub>2</sub>O]) can adversely affect the accuracy of CO<sub>2</sub> measurements by causing a phenomenon called **pressure broadening**. This phenomenon occurs because the peak absorbance of IR radiation by CO<sub>2</sub> lies between the peak absorbencies of H<sub>2</sub>O and N<sub>2</sub>O. The presence of these gases increases the absorption of IR radiation and results in erroneously high CO<sub>2</sub> readings. Pressure broadening can be minimized by removing water vapor from the gas sample before it is analyzed and by using electronic filters to subtract the IR absorption by gases other than CO<sub>2</sub>.

Fig. 10.6 is a schematic of a double-beam, positive-filter capnograph. The gas is drawn into a cuvette inside the sample chamber. IR radiation is beamed through the cuvette and through a reference chamber containing CO<sub>2</sub>-free gas. The CO<sub>2</sub> in the sample chamber absorbs some of the radiation, reducing the amount of radiation that reaches the detector. The difference between the radiation transmitted through the sample cell and the radiation transmitted through the reference is converted into an electrical signal, which is amplified and displayed. The displayed

**Fig. 10.6** Schematic diagram of a double-beam positive infrared capnograph. (From Kacmarek RL, Stoller JK, Heurer AJ, editors: *Egan's fundamentals of respiratory care*, ed 9, St. Louis, MO, 2009, Mosby.)

value can be displayed in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) representing the partial pressure or as percent CO<sub>2</sub> (%CO<sub>2</sub>).

In clinical practice, IR analyzers are typically classified according to the method of sampling of respired gases. Fig. 10.7 illustrates two methods: sidestream sampling devices and mainstream sampling devices. In sidestream sampling devices, gas from the airway is extracted through a narrow plastic tube to the measuring chamber, which is located in a separate console. In mainstream devices, the sampling chamber attaches directly to the ET and analysis is performed at the airway.

Sidestream sampling devices show a slight delay between sampling and reporting times because of the time required to transport the sample from the airway to the measuring chamber. The plastic tube that transports the sample of gas to the analyzer is prone to plugging with water and secretions, which interferes with the delivery of gas to the analyzer. Contamination with ambient air, caused by leaks in the sample line, is also a concern.

In mainstream sampling devices the analyzer is attached directly to the ET; therefore, no delay occurs between sampling and reporting times. However, this type of device adds a small amount of dead space to the airway. The analyzer must be properly supported because the added weight it places on the artificial airway increases the possibility of dislodgement or complete extubation. Also, because the analyzer is attached directly to the airway, it is handled often and subject to damage from mishandling (e.g., dropping).

# **Physiological Considerations**

Inspired air contains essentially no  $CO_2$  ( $\approx 0.3\%$   $CO_2$ ). Expired air normally contains about 4.5% to 5.5%  $CO_2$ , which is primarily the product of cellular metabolism. Fig. 10.8 illustrates a capnogram for a healthy, resting adult breathing room air. The waveform, which displays the fractional concentration of expired  $CO_2$  ( $F_ECO_2$ ) versus time, is divided into four phases. In phase 1, the initial gas exhaled is from the conducting airways, which contain low levels of  $CO_2$  from inspired air. During phase 2, alveolar gas containing  $CO_2$  mixes with gas exhaled from the anatomical airways and the  $CO_2$  concentration rises. In phase 3, the curve plateaus as alveolar gas is exhaled (this phase is often referred to as the alveolar plateau). The concentration of  $CO_2$  at the end of the alveolar phase (just before inspiration begins) is referred to as

![](_page_6_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 10.7** Schematic illustrating (A) sidestream and (B) mainstream capnographs. (From Cairo JM: *Mosby's respiratory care equipment*, ed 11, St. Louis MO, 2022, Elsevier.)

the  $\emph{end-tidal}$  PCO2, or  $P_{et}$ CO2. In phase 4 (inspiration) the concentration falls to zero.

The  $P_{et}CO_2$  is dependent on the alveolar  $PCO_2$  ( $P_ACO_2$ ), which is ultimately influenced by  $CO_2$  production ( $\dot{V}CO_2$ ) and the effectiveness of ventilation (i.e., matching of ventilation to perfusion). The production of  $CO_2$  is primarily determined by the

![](_page_6_Figure_7.jpeg)

metabolic rate. Fever, sepsis, hyperthyroidism, and seizures increase metabolic rate and  $\dot{V}CO_2$ . Hypothermia, starvation, and sedation reduce metabolic rate and  $\dot{V}CO_2$ .

The relationship between ventilation and perfusion of the lung and gas exchange (i.e., PACO<sub>2</sub>) can be expressed using  $\hat{V}/\hat{Q}$  relationships.<sup>30</sup> Fig. 10.9 shows three  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  relationships that can potentially affect the level of alveolar PCO2. In Fig. 10.9A, ventilation and perfusion are equally matched. The partial pressure of arterial CO2 (PaCO2) and PACO2 are nearly equal. The PetCO2 is normally about 4 to 6 mm Hg lower than the PaCO2. In Fig. 10.9B, ventilation decreases relative to perfusion (low  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$ ). The P<sub>A</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> eventually equilibrates with the mixed venous PCO<sub>2</sub>  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$ . Clinical situations in which this type of  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  relationship can exist throughout the lung (leading to higher than normal PetCO2 values) include respiratory center depression, muscular paralysis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In Fig. 10.9C, ventilation is higher than perfusion (high  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$ ). Physiological dead space ventilation increases, and the PACO2 approaches inspired air (0 Torr). Decreased PetCO2 values are found with this type of  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  relationship in patients with pulmonary embolism, excessive PEEP (extrinsic or intrinsic), and any disorder marked by pulmonary hypoperfusion.

# **Clinical Applications**

Capnography has been shown to be a useful measurement in both spontaneously breathing and mechanically ventilated patients. Box 10.2 summarizes the key points of the AARC's clinical practice guideline for using capnography/capnometry in ventilated patients.<sup>27</sup> The following section discusses some of the most common uses of capnography.

#### **Capnograph Contours**

Changes in the contour of the capnogram can be used to detect increases in dead space ventilation, hyperventilation and hypoventilation, apnea or periodic breathing, inadequate neuromuscular blockade in pharmacologically paralyzed patients, and CO<sub>2</sub> rebreathing. They can also be used to monitor the effectiveness of gas exchange during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and to detect accidental esophageal intubation.

Phase 3 (i.e., alveolar plateau) becomes indistinguishable from airway obstruction (i.e., increased physiological dead space) as occurs in COPD (Fig. 10.10A). Hyperventilation is characterized by a reduction in P<sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> and therefore P<sub>et</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> (Fig. 10.10B). Conversely, hypoventilation is associated with elevated P<sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> and

Summary of American Association for Respiratory Care Clinical Practice Guideline for Capnography/ Capnometry During Mechanical Ventilation

#### **Indications**

On the basis of current evidence, capnography is useful for the following:

- 1. Monitoring the severity of pulmonary disease and evaluating the response to therapy, especially therapy intended to improve  $V_D/V_T$  and ventilation-perfusion  $(\dot{V}/\dot{Q})$  relationships. It may also provide valuable information about therapy directed at improving coronary blood flow.
- 2. Used as an adjunct to verify that tracheal rather than esophageal intubation has taken place.
- 3. Graphic evaluation of the integrity of the patient-ventilatory interface.
- 4. Monitoring the adequacy of pulmonary and coronary blood flow.
- 5. Screening patients for pulmonary embolism.
- 6. Detection of CO<sub>2</sub> rebreathing and the waning effects of neuromuscular blockade.
- 7. Monitoring CO<sub>2</sub> elimination.
- 8. Optimization of mechanical ventilation.

#### **Contraindications and Complications**

There are no absolute contraindications to capnography in mechanically ventilated adult patients. Mainstream devices increase the amount of dead space added to the ventilator circuit. The sampling rate of respired gases when using sidestream analyzers may be high enough to cause autotriggering when flow triggering of mechanical breaths is used. The effect is inversely proportional to the size of the patient. The gas-sampling rate can diminish delivered tidal volume in neonates and small patients while using volume-targeted or volume-controlled ventilation.

#### **Monitoring**

During capnography, the following should be recorded:

- 1. Ventilatory variables, including tidal volume, respiratory rate, PEEP, inspiratory/expiratory ratios, peak airway pressures, and concentrations of respiratory gases
- 2. Hemodynamic variables, including systemic and pulmonary pressures, cardiac output, shunt, and  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  imbalances

#### Limitations

Although capnography can provide valuable information about the efficiency of ventilation, in addition to systemic, pulmonary, and coronary perfusion,  $P_aCO_2$  should be routinely determined by standard arterial blood gas analysis. Leaks in the ventilator circuit or leaks around the tracheal tube can lead to inaccurate measurements of expired  $CO_2$ . The reliability of the contour of the capnogram can also be affected by the stability of the minute volume, tidal volume, cardiac output, and  $CO_2$  body stores. High breathing frequencies may exceed the response capabilities of the capnograph and therefore affect the integrity of the capnogram recorded. Low cardiac output may cause a false-negative result when attempting to verify the endotracheal tube (ET) position in the trachea. Positioning the ET in the pharynx and the presence of antacids and carbonated beverage in the stomach can lead to false-positive results when assessing ET placement.

 $P_{et}CO_2$  (see Fig. 10.10B). Fig. 10.10C is a capnogram of a patient with Cheyne-Stokes breathing. During bradypnea, phase 4 will occasionally show cardiac oscillations resulting from the motion of the beating heart transferred to the conducting airways (Fig. 10.10D). Failure of the capnogram to return to baseline is an indicator of rebreathing of exhaled gas (Fig. 10.10E).

Fig. 10.10F shows a capnogram for a paralyzed patient, demonstrating the characteristic "curare cleft" during phase 3. This is a positive sign that the paralyzed patient is receiving insufficient neuromuscular blockade; however, other factors can contribute to this capnographic finding, such as patient-ventilator asynchrony.

# Case Study 10.2

# **Capnography During Intubation**

After considerable difficulty, an endotracheal tube is inserted without visualization of the trachea into a patient's airway during CPR. Capnography results show a  $P_{\rm et}CO_2$  of 3 Torr; a standard ABG measurement demonstrates a  $P_aCO_2$  of 75 Torr. Explain the cause of this discrepancy in the capnography and ABG results.

**Key Point** 10.2 Capnography can be a valuable adjunct to verify tracheal rather than esophageal intubation during CPR.

Capnography can be used to detect pulmonary blood flow cessation, such as occurs with pulmonary embolism or during cardiac arrest. The American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care recommend the use of continuous quantitative waveform capnography for confirmation and monitoring of ET placement during CPR. Laboratory studies suggest that the capnogram can be used as an indication of the progress and success of CPR. These studies demonstrated that  $P_{\rm et}CO_2$  increases as  $\mathring{V}/\mathring{Q}$  is restored to normal.

As mentioned, capnography can be used to detect accidental esophageal intubation. The gastric  $PCO_2$  is generally equal to room air; therefore failure to detect the characteristic changes in  $CO_2$  concentration during ventilation possibly indicates esophageal intubation. However, low perfusion of the lungs is associated with low  $P_{et}CO_2$  and should not be confused with esophageal intubation. Also, the gastric  $PCO_2$  may be elevated after mouth-to-mouth breathing or if the patient recently ingested a carbonated beverage. Case Study 10.2 gives an example situation of the use of capnographic data (Key Point 10.2).

#### Arterial to Maximum End-Expiratory PCO<sub>2</sub> Difference

The  $P_{(a\text{-et})}CO_2$  for tidal breathing should be approximately 4 to 6 mm Hg. It is elevated in patients with COPD, left-sided heart

failure, and pulmonary embolism caused by an increase in physiological dead space. <sup>30,31</sup> Another technique that can be used to further evaluate the severity of the disease is to compare arterial PCO<sub>2</sub> measurements with maximum expired PCO<sub>2</sub> measurements (the arterial to maximum expiratory PCO<sub>2</sub> gradient). With this technique, the expired PCO<sub>2</sub> recorded at the end of a maximum exhalation is compared with the P<sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>. The difference is normally minimal. Patients with COPD and left-sided heart failure do not show an arterial to maximum expired PCO<sub>2</sub> difference, whereas patients with pulmonary embolism do show an increased gradient. Fig. 10.11 shows the capnographic appearance of these differences.

# **Volumetric Capnometry**

In addition to end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) monitoring, another available application is volumetric capnometry. EtCO<sub>2</sub> monitoring focuses on exhaled CO<sub>2</sub> plotted over time, whereas volumetric capnometry focuses on exhaled CO<sub>2</sub> plotted relative to exhaled volume.<sup>4</sup> The Philips Respironics NM3 monitor is an example of a capnometer that can provide this type of monitoring (Fig. 10.12) (Philips Respironics, Inc., Murrysville, PA). (NOTE: The Philips Respironics NM3 monitor can also be used to estimate cardiac output noninvasively; see Chapter 11.)

# Description of the Single-Breath CO<sub>2</sub> Curve

The single-breath  $CO_2$  graph (SBCO<sub>2</sub>) is produced by the integration of airway flow and  $CO_2$  concentration; it is presented on a breath-to-breath basis. As shown in Fig. 10.13, the graph can provide information on anatomical dead space, alveolar dead space (when  $P_aCO_2$  is known), and  $CO_2$  elimination (VCO<sub>2</sub>) for each breath. If a horizontal line is drawn at the top of the curve, representing  $\%CO_2$  in arterial blood, three distinct regions of the curve are established.

Area X represents the actual amount of  $CO_2$  exhaled in the breath, assuming that no exhaled air is rebreathed. In other words, the area under the  $SBCO_2$  curve is the volume of  $CO_2$  in a single breath. Adding all the single breaths in a minute gives the  $\dot{V}CO_2$ , the same results that would occur if exhaled gas were collected using a Douglas bag. Thus the  $CO_2$  monitor can provide information about the volume of  $CO_2$  in one breath  $(\dot{V}CO_2\ VCO_2)$  and the volume of  $CO_2$  produced in 1 minute  $(\dot{V}CO_2)$ .

Capnography, *Curr Rev Respir Ther* 3:146—150, 1981; Erickson L, Wollmer P, Olsson CG, et al.: Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism based upon alveolar dead space analysis, *Chest* 96:357—362, 1989; and Hatle CJ, Rokseth R: The arterial to end expiratory carbon dioxide tension gradient in pulmonary embolism and other cardiopulmonary diseases, *Chest* 66:352—357, 1974.)

Area Y represents the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that is not eliminated because of alveolar dead space (i.e., ventilated alveoli that are poorly perfused or receive no perfusion at all). Area Z represents

poorly perfused or receive no perfusion at all). Area Z represents the amount of  $CO_2$  that was not eliminated because of the anatomical dead space.

The relationship of the areas (with the added arterial blood line) provides some important parameters for analysis. The ratios of the areas created in the SBCO<sub>2</sub> curve are the same as the relationship seen in the Enghoff modified Bohr equation:

$$\frac{\left[P_aCO_2-P_ECO_2\right]}{P_aCO_2}=\frac{(Y+Z)}{(X+Y+Z)}$$

where  $P_aCO_2$  is arterial partial pressure for  $CO_2$ , and  $P_{\dot{E}}CO_2$  is mixed expired partial pressure for  $CO_2$ . (XYZ were defined

**Fig. 10.13** Graph of exhaled volume (x-axis) versus  $\%CO_2$  (y-axis). A horizontal line drawn at the top of the curve represents the  $\%CO_2$  in arterial blood. Three distinct regions are illustrated: Area X represents actual  $CO_2$  exhaled in one breath; area Y is the amount of  $CO_2$  not eliminated because of alveolar dead space; and area Z is the amount of  $CO_2$  not eliminated because of anatomical dead space.  $V_{\rm alveolar}$ , Alveolar volume;  $V_{\rm dr}$  dead space volume.

previously.) Four major factors influence the amount of  $\mathrm{CO}_2$  exhaled:  $\mathrm{CO}_2$  production, perfusion of the lungs, diffusion, and ventilation.

Altering the production of  $CO_2$  or any one of the factors involved in transport of  $CO_2$  without compensation will result in changes in  $P_aCO_2$  and the volume of  $CO_2$  eliminated through the lungs.  $^{32,33}$ 

As previously mentioned, conditions that can alter the volume of  $CO_2$  produced are related to changes in metabolic rate. For example,  $\dot{V}CO_2$  increases in patients with sepsis, fever, severe burns to the body, or trauma and with increases in work of breathing (WOB; i.e., the respiratory muscles produce additional  $CO_2$ ). If metabolic rate increases and ventilation does not increase,  $P_aCO_2$  rises, and therefore the amount of  $CO_2$  exhaled during the SBCO<sub>2</sub> maneuver increases.

Reductions in perfusion to the lungs, as occurs with pulmonary emboli and reductions in cardiac output, can lead to changes in the contour of the SBCO<sub>2</sub> curve. As perfusion to the lung decreases, the phase 2 portion of the curve shifts to the right, showing increased dead space in the system (i.e., less CO<sub>2</sub> exhaled). In this situation, physiological dead space increases. In addition, the area under the curve contains less CO<sub>2</sub>; therefore less  $\dot{V}$ CO<sub>2</sub> VCO<sub>2</sub> per breath is eliminated because of the fact that less CO<sub>2</sub> is being delivered to the alveoli. (It is important to recognize that overall CO<sub>2</sub> production is not reduced.)

Application of PEEP can also alter the contour of the volumetric SBCO<sub>2</sub> curve. As PEEP is increased from 0 to 15 cm  $H_2O$ , the phase 2 portion of the curve shifts to the right because of expanding airways (increasing PEEP keeps the airways open) and reduced perfusion. The addition of PEEP can cause compression of the pulmonary capillaries and a decrease in perfusion to the lungs, reducing effective perfusion to the ventilated alveoli. This change represents an increase in alveolar dead space. The slope of phase 2 decreases as well; this is a result of lower  $CO_2$  concentration occurring at an identical volume point on the x-axis, causing a rise in  $P_aCO_2$ .

Case Study 10.3 provides an example of how volumetric capnography can be used clinically.

# Single-Breath CO<sub>2</sub> Loop of Inspiration and Exhalation

# Case Study 10.3

#### **Exercise**

#### **Dead Space Ventilation**

A 35-year-old, 60-kg man is admitted to the ICU after a motor vehicle accident in which he sustained multiple rib fractures. He is receiving volume-targeted mechanical ventilation and is being monitored with pulse oximetry and volumetric capnography. You are asked to increase his PEEP level from +5 cm  $\rm H_2O$  to +10 cm  $\rm H_2O$ . After making the change, you notice that his  $\rm S_pO_2$  decreases from 93% to 90%. His SBCO\_2 curve has shifted to the right, and the  $\rm P_{et}CO_2$  decreased from 30 mm Hg to 25 mm Hg. Briefly describe why these changes may have occurred.

one breath is the area between the exhaled and inhaled  $CO_2$  of this loop. The net  $CO_2$  in one breath is the difference between the amount of  $CO_2$  inhaled (which is typically negligible) and the amount of  $CO_2$  exhaled.

# Trending CO<sub>2</sub> Production and Alveolar Minute Ventilation Over Time

As mentioned, the Philips Respionics NM3 monitor can trend data over time. The display for this purpose reports the  $CO_2$  produced each minute ( $\dot{V}CO_2$ ) rather than SBCO<sub>2</sub> curves (Fig. 10.15). Trended data can be used to monitor a variety of clinical procedures. For example, during a recruitment maneuver in a patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome, trended  $CO_2$  data will reveal a transient rise in  $CO_2$  when previously closed alveoli are reopened. This tool can also be used in weaning patients from the ventilator. For example, if the patient's respiratory rate increases during a spontaneous breathing trial, monitoring  $CO_2$  can help determine whether the patient's metabolic rate is increasing (and thus working the respiratory muscles) or whether a change in dead space affects the patient's ability to wean.

Trending of  $CO_2$  can be useful for noting the time lag that can occur in  $CO_2$  removal as a result of  $CO_2$  stores ( $CO_2$  bound in the cells or through bicarbonate or bound in the blood). Large stores

![](_page_11_Figure_9.jpeg)

**Fig. 10.15** An example of a  $\dot{V}CO_2$  trended over time (bottom bar graph) compared with corresponding  $\dot{V}_E$  (top bar graph; L/min). During the successful weaning trial illustrated in these graphs, mandatory breaths are reduced (gray area, top graph) and the patient's spontaneous breath rate increases (dark bars in , top graph). At the same time, a progressive rise occurs in  $\dot{V}CO_2$  as the expected work of the respiratory muscles increases. (Courtesy Philips North America Corporation, Andover, MA.)

result in extended time lags, and small stores result in short time lags. For example, if the alveolar ventilation increases,  $P_aCO_2$  decreases and the stores of  $CO_2$  also begin to decline; however, this second part requires time to happen and can be identified by the trending of  $CO_2$ . In this situation, if  $\mathring{V}_E$  increases, SBCO<sub>2</sub> increases and  $P_aCO_2$  initially declines. After a slight delay, because the production of  $CO_2$  remains constant, the  $P_aCO_2$  remains low and the monitored exhaled  $\mathring{V}CO_2$  returns to baseline, indicating that balance has returned. Plotting SBCO<sub>2</sub> curve trends over time using a trending graph is the best way to monitor these types of changes.

# **EXHALED NITRIC OXIDE MONITORING**

Nitric oxide (NO) has potent dilatory effects on the pulmonary vessels and airways. It has also been shown to facilitate coordinated beating of ciliated epithelial cells. The synthesis of NO by the body is mediated through a series of enzymes that are referred to as NO synthases (NOS), which exist in constitutive and inducible forms. The constitutive form is associated with endothelial and neural cells; the inducible NOS is particularly seen in epithelial cells. Although both forms of NOS are present in the airways, the expression of the inducible NOS appears to correlate with the level of NO found in exhaled air.

The most common method used to quantify the level of exhaled NO is chemiluminescence, which occurs when NO reacts with ozone. Exhaled NO (eNO) can be detected in exhaled gas in the range of 7.8 to 41.1 parts per billion (ppb). Note that the concentration of NO can vary with the flow of exhaled air because it is continually formed in the airways. The range of eNO is also affected by the presence of pathological conditions in addition to the patient's gender, atopic status, smoking habits, and use of medications.<sup>33</sup> Box 10.3 provides a list of factors that have been shown to affect the levels of eNO.

Exhaled NO is currently used as a marker for airway inflammation associated with asthma.<sup>31</sup> Several studies have shown a

positive correlation between the eNO and disease severity.<sup>32,33</sup> Monitoring the level of eNO can also be used to monitor the effectiveness of inhaled corticosteroid in the treatment of asthmatic patients.

#### TRANSCUTANEOUS MONITORING

Transcutaneous monitoring is another noninvasive method that can be used to indirectly assess a patient's oxygenation  $(P_aO_2)$  and ventilation  $(P_aCO_2)$  status. Unlike pulse oximetry and capnography, which rely on spectrophotometric analysis, transcutaneous

monitoring uses modified blood gas electrodes to measure the  $O_2$  and  $CO_2$  tensions at the skin surface (Box 10.4).<sup>34,35</sup>

# Transcutaneous PO<sub>2</sub>

Devices used to monitor the transcutaneous partial pressure of  $O_2$   $(P_{tc}O_2)$  consist of a servo-controlled, heated (Clark) polarographic electrode connected to a central processing unit (Fig. 10.16A).  $^{36\text{-}38}$  The electrode housing, which is covered with a Teflon membrane, attaches to the skin surface with a double-sided adhesive ring. The electrode is heated to  $42^\circ$  to  $45^\circ$  C to produce capillary vasodilation below the surface of the electrode. Note that heating improves diffusion of gases across the skin because it increases local blood

# Summary of American Association for Respiratory Care Clinical Practice Guideline for Transcutaneous Blood Gas Monitoring

#### Setting

- 1. Monitoring mechanically ventilated patients (e.g., conventional modes of ventilation, high-frequency ventilation, noninvasive ventilation)
- 2. Bronchoscopies and procedures requiring sedation or patient-controlled analgesia
- 3. Sleep studies
- 4. Pulmonary function testing (e.g., stress testing, bronchoprovocation)
- 5. Trending HCO<sub>3</sub> in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis
- 6. Apnea testing
- 7. Patient transport
- 8. Evaluation of tissue perfusion
- 9. Evaluation of hyperventilation during phonation of patients with vocal cord disorders
- 10. Titrating long-term O<sub>2</sub> therapy

#### Indications

- 1. Monitoring the adequacy of arterial oxygenation and/or ventilation.
- 2. The need to quantify the response to diagnostic and therapeutic interventions (e.g., administering enriched O<sub>2</sub> mixtures, application of PFFP).
- 3. Transcutaneous O<sub>2</sub> index (P<sub>tc</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) can be used as a marker of hypoperfusion and mortality.
- 4. Tissue perfusion status and revascularization in wound care (e.g., during hyperbaric O<sub>2</sub> therapy) and peripheral vascular disease.
- 5. Monitoring response to therapy in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, as P<sub>tc</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> correlates with serum HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> levels.

#### **Contraindications and Complications**

Transcutaneous monitoring may be relatively contraindicated in patients with poor skin integrity and/or adhesive allergy. Complications may include thermal injury at the sensor site resulting in erythema, blisters, burns, and skin tears. Misinterpretation of data may lead to inappropriate treatment of a patient.

#### **Monitoring**

The following should be recorded when monitoring transcutaneous measurements:

- 1. Clinical appearance of the patient, including subjective assessment of perfusion, pallor, and skin temperature
- 2. Date and time of the measurement
- 3. Patient position
- 4. Respiratory rate
- 5. Physical activity level
- 6. F<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and the type of O<sub>2</sub> delivery device if supplemental O<sub>2</sub> is being administered
- 7. Mode of ventilator support (i.e., ventilator or CPAP settings)
- 8. Electrode placement site, electrode temperature, and time of placement
- 9. Results of simultaneous measurements of PaO2, PaCO2, and pH

#### Limitations

Technical and clinical factors may affect the reliability of transcutaneous readings and therefore limit the application of transcutaneous monitoring. Improper calibration, trapped air bubbles, and damaged membranes can affect the accuracy of the measurements of  $P_{tc}O_2$  and  $P_{tc}CO_2$ . The presence of hyperoxemia ( $P_aO_2 > 100$  mm Hg) or a hypoperfused state (e.g., shock) can increase the difference between  $P_{tc}O_2$  and  $P_aO_2$ .

flow at the site of the electrode and alters the structure of the stratum corneum. The stratum corneum has been described as a mixture of fibrinous tissue within a lipid and protein matrix. It has been suggested that heating the skin to temperatures greater than 41° C melts the lipid layer, thus enhancing gas diffusion through the skin.

Although correlation of  $P_{tc}O_2$  and  $P_aO_2$  ( $P_{tc}O_2/P_aO_2$  index) has been shown to be good for neonates, it is often unreliable for critically ill adult patients.<sup>39</sup> A decrease in peripheral perfusion caused by reductions in cardiac output or increases in peripheral (cutaneous) resistance can significantly affect the accuracy of  $P_{tc}O_2$  measurements.<sup>40,41</sup> Data indicate that when the cardiac index is greater than 2.2 L/min/m², the  $P_{tc}O_2/P_aO_2$  index is 0.5, whereas for a cardiac index less than 1.5 L/min/m² it is only 0.1.<sup>42</sup> Therefore hypoperfusion of the cutaneous circulation caused by pathological states (e.g., septic shock, hemorrhage, or heart failure) or increased vascular resistance (e.g., hypothermia or pharmacological intervention) can produce erroneous data. Because the  $P_{tc}O_2$  is influenced by blood flow to the tissues and  $O_2$  utilization by the tissues, changes in this value may be used as an early indicator of vascular compromise or shock.

#### **Transcutaneous PCO<sub>2</sub>**

Measurement in the transcutaneous  $CO_2$  partial pressure ( $P_{tc}CO_2$ ) was introduced into clinical practice in the late 1970s after the successful use of  $P_{tc}O_2$  monitors in neonatal ICU patients was demonstrated. Standard devices use a modified Stow-Severinghaus blood gas electrode, which is composed of pH-sensitive glass with an Ag/AgCl electrode (see Fig. 10.16B). As with the  $P_{tc}O_2$  electrode, the  $P_{tc}CO_2$  electrode is heated to  $42^\circ$  to  $45^\circ$  C.  $P_{tc}CO_2$  values are slightly higher than those of  $P_aCO_2$ , primarily because of the higher metabolic rate at the site of the electrode caused by heating the skin. Most commercial instruments incorporate correction factors into their system's software to remove this discrepancy between  $P_{tc}CO_2$  and  $P_aCO_2$ .

#### **Technical Considerations**

Some simple rules apply when using transcutaneous monitors. These relate to care, placement, and calibration of the electrodes.

Establishing a set routine for these three tasks will help ensure accurate and useful measurements<sup>41</sup>:

- 1. The transcutaneous monitor manufacturer should have validated the transcutaneous monitor, electrodes, calibration gases, and supplies, using accepted quality control procedures and clinical reliability studies.
- 2. Transcutaneous electrodes are bathed by an electrolyte solution (see Fig. 10.16). This solution can easily evaporate because of the heat applied to the electrode. The electrolyte and the sensor's membrane should be changed weekly or whenever the respiratory care practitioner notices a signal drift during calibration. Because silver can become deposited on the cathode, periodic cleaning of the electrode is suggested, using the manufacturer's recommendations.
- 3. Before placing an electrode on the patient's skin, the site should be cleansed using an alcohol swab. In cases in which hair may be present, the site should be shaved to ensure good contact between the electrode and skin. Before applying the electrode to the skin, a drop of electrolyte gel or deionized water should be placed on the electrode's surface to enhance gas diffusion between the skin and electrode.
- 4.  $P_{tc}O_2$  monitors are calibrated using a two-point calibration in which room air ( $PO_2$  of about 150 mm Hg) serves as the high  $PO_2$  of the calibration and an electronic zeroing of the system serves as the low  $PO_2$  of the calibration.
- 5. PtcCO2 monitors are also calibrated with a two-point calibration procedure. In this calibration, a 5% CO2 calibration gas and 10% CO2 calibration gas are used for low and high calibration points, respectively. Electrodes should be calibrated before their initial use on a patient. Manufacturers typically suggest that the electrode should be recalibrated each time it is repositioned.
- 6. Reports of  $P_{tc}O_2$  and  $P_{tc}CO_2$  readings should include notation of the date and time of the measurement, the patient's activity level and body position, and the site of electrode placement, along with the electrode temperature. The inspired  $O_2$  concentration and the type of equipment used to deliver supplemental  $O_2$  should always be included. The clinical appearance of the patient, including assessment of peripheral

perfusion (i.e., pallor, skin temperature), are important data to note. In cases in which invasive ABG measurements are available, these data are recorded for comparison with  $P_{tc}O_2$  and  $P_{tc}CO_2$  readings.

Burns are probably the most common problem that clinicians encounter during transcutaneous monitoring. Burns can occur because the site of measurement must be heated to 42° to 45° C. Repositioning the sensor every 4 to 6 hours can help avoid this problem. When transcutaneous monitoring is used with neonates, the sensor should be repositioned more often (e.g., every 2 hours).

A problem can occur with  $P_{tc}O_2$  and  $P_{tc}CO_2$  readings if the electrode is applied improperly. A leak-proof seal must be maintained at the skin surface for the readings to be meaningful. A leak allows room air to contact the sensor and results in higher than actual  $P_{tc}O_2$  and lower than actual  $P_{tc}CO_2$  readings even though the patient's clinical condition has not changed.

When combined  $O_2/CO_2$  electrodes are used, hydroxyl (OH<sup>-</sup>) ions produced at the  $PO_2$  cathode may interfere with  $P_{tc}CO_2$  readings. This problem has been reduced by stoichiometric consumption of OH<sup>-</sup> by an anodized anode.<sup>24</sup>

# INDIRECT CALORIMETRY AND METABOLIC MEASUREMENTS

# **Overview of Indirect Calorimetry**

Indirect calorimetry allows the clinician to estimate energy expenditure (EE) from measurements of  $O_2$  consumption  $(\dot{V}O_2)$  and  $CO_2$  production  $(\dot{V}CO_2)$ .<sup>43</sup> This technique is based on the theory that all the energy a person uses is derived from the oxidation of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins and that the ratio of  $CO_2$  produced to  $O_2$  consumed (i.e., the respiratory quotient or  $\dot{V}CO_2/\dot{V}O_2$ ) is characteristic for the fuel being burned (Box 10.5).<sup>44</sup> Although the use of metabolic measurements varies considerably, many clinicians are becoming comfortable with this emerging technology and recognize that metabolic measurements can provide valuable information for designing nutritional support regimens.

#### **Technical Considerations**

The most commonly used devices for indirect calorimetry are open-circuit gas exchange monitors (Fig. 10.17). They are often referred to as *metabolic monitors* or *metabolic carts*. A typical **metabolic monitor** includes analyzers for measuring the concentration of inspired and expired gases in addition to a sensor for measuring the volume and/or flow of respired gases. The  $\rm O_2$  analyzer is a rapid-responding polarographic or zirconium oxide  $\rm O_2$  analyzer. The  $\rm CO_2$  analyzer is a nondispersive, infrared analyzer. Volume and flow measurements can be obtained using pneumotachometers, turbine flow meters, or ultrasonic vortex flow meters. Barometric pressure and expired gas temperatures are monitored with temperature-sensitive, solid-state (integrated circuit) transducers.

**Obtaining Indirect Calorimetry Measurements.** A spontaneously breathing patient who is breathing room air can be connected to the system by having the patient breathe through a mouthpiece or mask that is attached to a nonrebreathing valve. Specially designed canopies and hoods can be used for spontaneously breathing patients who are not receiving ventilatory support.

Patients with ETs or tracheostomy tubes who are on mechanical ventilation can be connected to the system by placing the non-rebreathing valve directly onto the airway opening and directing the expired gases into the system. It is important to inflate the cuffs of ETs and tracheostomy tubes when measuring inspired and expired gases. Failure to inflate the cuff will result in loss of expired air around the tube (system leak) and erroneous measurements of  $\dot{V}O_2$  and  $\dot{V}CO_2$ . For patients receiving a continuous flow of gas during ventilatory support, such as occurs when an external flow from a flow meter is used to power a small-volume nebulizer inline, an isolation valve must be used to ensure that only the patient's exhaled gases are delivered to the system.

VO<sub>2</sub> and VCO<sub>2</sub> are calculated by comparing the fractional concentrations of O2 and CO2 of inspired and expired air. For patients breathing room air, the F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can be assumed to be 0.209 and the F<sub>1</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> to be 0.03. For patients receiving enriched O<sub>2</sub> mixtures, the F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> must be measured by the system. Fluctuations in F<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can be caused by air leaks in the patient-ventilatormetabolic monitor system and also varying gas volumes and pressure demands, such as occur during intermittent mandatory ventilation. Unstable air-O<sub>2</sub> blending systems within the ventilator circuit may contribute to unstable F<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub> values (this problem can be prevented with the use of an external air-O2 blender). Clinical studies have shown that some systems may not provide accurate and reproducible VO<sub>2</sub> measurements for patient breathing F<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub> values greater than 0.5.46 Box 10.6 provides a summary of the AARC Clinical Practice Guideline for using indirect calorimetry during mechanical ventilation.

Clinical Applications of Metabolic Measurements. Indirect calorimetry can provide information on EE and the pattern of substrate utilization. EE represents an individual's caloric expenditure calculated from measured  $\dot{V}O_2$  and  $\dot{V}CO_2$  values. EE can be calculated with the deWeir equation shown in Box 10.7. Note that urinary nitrogen (UN) is determined separately by the clinical laboratory using a 24-hour urine sample. The UN is one of the end products of protein metabolism; therefore the number of grams of nitrogen excreted in the urine is directly related to the amount of protein used by the individual. If nitrogen excretion data are not available, EE can be calculated using the modified deWeir equation. In this latter equation, it is assumed that protein represents 12% to 15% of the total EE.

EE can be expressed in kilocalories per day (kcal/day) or relative to the individual's body surface area (kcal/h/m $^2$ ). A normal, healthy adult uses about 1500 to 3000 kcal/day or about 30 to 40 kcal/h/m $^2$ .

Another method used to express the level of energy metabolism is to compare the measured EE with predicted EE, which is based on the individual's age, weight, and height. (The Harris-Benedict equations shown in Box 10.7 are examples of reference equations that have historically been used in clinical practice to estimate EE.) If the measured EE is greater than 120% of the predicted EE, a hypermetabolic state exists. Conversely, when the measured EE is less than 80% of the predicted EE, a hypometabolic state exists.

Summary of American Association for Respiratory Care Clinical Practice Guideline for Metabolic Measurement Using Indirect Calorimetry During Mechanical Ventilation

#### Indications

- Metabolic measurements may be indicated in patients with known nutritional deficits and derangements. Multiple nutritional risk and stress factors that may skew predictions made using the Harris-Benedict equation (e.g., neurological trauma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute pancreatitis, multiple trauma, severe sepsis, extreme obesity, severe hypermetabolic or hypometabolic patients).
- 2. To measure  ${\rm O_2}$  cost of breathing in patients who fail attempts at liberation from mechanical ventilation.
- 3. To measure  $\dot{V}O_2$  and cardiac output by the Fick equation for patients requiring hemodynamic monitoring.

# **Contraindications and Complications**

- Manipulation of the ventilator circuit for connection of measurement lines may cause leaks that may lower alveolar ventilation and result in hypoxemia, bradycardia, or other adverse connections.
- 2. Inappropriate calibration or system setup may result in erroneous results leading to incorrect patient management.
- Isolation valves may increase circuit resistance and cause increased work of breathing and/or dynamic hyperinflation (auto-PEEP).
- Inspiratory reserves may cause a reduction in alveolar ventilation because of increased compressible volume of the breathing circuit.

Inaccurate measurements of resting energy expenditure and RQ during open circuit measurements may be caused by:

- Instability of F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> within a breath or breath to breath because of changes in the source gas pressure and ventilator blender characteristics
- 2.  $F_1O_2 > 0.60$
- 3. Inability to separate inspired and expired gases because of bias flow and flow-triggering systems, intermittent mandatory ventilation systems, or specific ventilator characteristics
- 4. Presence of anesthetic gases or gases other than O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and nitrogen in the patient-ventilator circuit
- 5. Presence of water vapor resulting in sensor malfunction
- 6. Inadequate length of the measurement

# **Assessment of Test Quality and Outcome**

- 1. RQ is consistent with the patient's nutritional intake.
- 2. RQ at rest is in the normal physiological range (0.67-1.3).
- 3. Variability of  $\dot{V}O_2$  and  $\dot{V}CO_2$  measurements should be within a physiological range (0.7–1.0).

endocrine, cardiovascular, and pulmonary diseases can also influence the metabolic rate.<sup>50</sup> Box 10.8 lists several conditions that are associated with hypermetabolic and hypometabolic states.

show diurnal variation; it is usually lowest on awakening in the morning and increases 10% to 15% by late afternoon.<sup>50,51</sup> This increase in EE may be related to hormonal changes that occur during the day.

Sleep is associated with a reduction in metabolic rate, whereas even the slightest exertion is associated with increases in metabolic rate. Changes in body temperature, as occur with bacterial and viral infections, can profoundly affect the metabolic rate. For example, an increase in body temperature of 1° C will cause a 10% increase in metabolic rate. Burns, long-bone fractures, and surgery can increase the metabolic rate by as much as 200%.<sup>50</sup>

The substrate utilization pattern is the proportion of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins that contribute to the total energy metabolism. The percentage of the total energy that a substrate contributes can be derived from measurements of the RQ (the ratio of VCO2 to VO2). The RQ levels for the various foods are known; when pure fat is burned, the RQ equals 0.7. The RQ for pure carbohydrate is 1.0, and the RQ for protein is approximately 0.8. RQ levels greater than 1.0 are associated with lipogenesis (fat synthesis) and hyperventilation. RQ levels less than 0.7 are associated with ketosis.

A healthy adult consuming a typical American diet derives 45% to 50% of his or her calories from carbohydrates, 35% to 40% from lipids, and 10% to 15% from proteins. The resultant RQ will range from 0.80 to 0.85. Note that proteins normally contribute only minor amounts to energy metabolism. The percentage of protein used represents the normal turnover rate for replenishing structural and functional proteins in the body. Proteins may contribute significantly to EE in cases of starvation. For this reason, a nonprotein RQ is usually reported to indicate the contribution to RQ made by carbohydrates and lipids.

The types of substrates ingested and the ability of the individual to use various foods determine substrate utilization. For example, feeding large amounts of glucose will raise the RQ to about 1.0, suggesting that carbohydrates are providing most of the EE. Prolonged starvation will lower the RQ to about 0.7, indicating that the individual is relying almost completely on fats for energy. Many systemic diseases will adversely affect an individual's ability to use various substrates. For example, several studies have shown that patients with severe sepsis demonstrate RQ levels of approximately 0.7 because of reliance on lipid metabolism for energy and their inability to use carbohydrates.

Monitoring of substrate utilization patterns can assist the clinician who is trying to wean patients with limited ventilatory reserve from mechanical ventilation (Key Point 10.3). It has been demonstrated that feeding these patients diets containing a high percentage of carbohydrates will raise their VCO2 to a greater extent than their  $\dot{V}O_2$  (RQ approaches 1.0). The added CO<sub>2</sub> load placed on these patients (remember they have limited ventilatory reserve) is greater than their own ventilatory capacity, and they fail to wean. Switching their diet to one that has a higher fatto-carbohydrate ratio lowers their  $\dot{V}CO_2/\dot{V}O_2$  ratio (RQ levels approach 0.7) and reduces the CO2 load to the lungs. It is reasonable to suggest that this change would enhance the potential for a successful weaning outcome. See Critical Care Concept 10.1

# **Indirect Calorimetry**

Prediction equations used by clinicians to determine energy needs for hospitalized patients are derived from studies of healthy subjects. Clinicians generally agree that using standard prediction equations to estimate energy needs for critically ill patients provides values that compare poorly with measured values, such as those reported from indirect calorimetry. The energy needs of these patients tend to be quite diverse and can lead to overnutrition or undernutrition. Although stress factors can be added to the calculation of predicted caloric intake, these factors may be misleading, particularly in those patients demonstrating multisystem problems.

for a discussion of the advantages of using indirect calorimetry in the management of critically ill patients.

# ASSESSMENT OF RESPIRATORY SYSTEM **MECHANICS**

The assessment of respiratory system mechanics for patients receiving ventilatory support begins with measurements of pressure, volume, and flow events. Once these measurements have been made, the clinician can calculate derived values for respiratory system compliance, airway resistance, and the WOB.<sup>54</sup> Chapter 1 discusses the physiological concepts required for an understanding of respiratory mechanics in mechanically ventilated patients. The following is a brief description of the devices and techniques that are used to measure airway pressures, volumes, and flows.

#### **MEASUREMENTS**

#### **Airway Pressure Measurements**

Mechanical ventilators have traditionally allowed for measurements of airway pressures by incorporating an aneroid manometer into the ventilator circuit. With this arrangement, the manometer records pressure changes within the ventilator, which includes contributions from ventilator resistance. Measuring airway pressure near the airway opening can minimize the effects associated with ventilator resistance. Thus in the current generation of adult and neonatal ventilators, airway pressure is measured using electromechanical transducers (e.g., piezoelectric, variable capacitance, strain gauge) that connect to pressure sampling ports located near the airway opening (i.e., measurements can be made on the inspiratory limb of the ventilator circuit, the expiratory side of the circuit, or directly at the ET).

An alternative method of recording airway pressures during mechanical ventilation is to use a strain gauge pressure transducer that is normally used for measuring systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures. These transducers can be adapted for respiratory pressure measurements because respiratory pressures are similar in magnitude to those found in the systemic or pulmonary arterial vasculature.<sup>24,55</sup> There are several points to remember when using these types of pressure transducers. Hemodynamic pressures are

recorded in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), and respiratory pressures are recorded in centimeters of water (cm H2O); to convert from millimeters of mercury to centimeters of H2O, the mm Hg value is multiplied by 1.36. Second, the transducer need not be filled with fluid for making airway pressure measurements. Third, the same transducer should not be used to obtain both airway pressure and hemodynamic measurements, to avoid the possibility of introducing an air embolus into the

The most common airway pressure measurements are peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) and static, or plateau, pressure (Pplat) (Fig. 10.18). As discussed in Chapter 1, PIP is the maximum pressure generated during inspiration. During volume-targeted ventilation, PIP is determined by the tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>), peak flow, and inspiratory flow. It is also influenced by the resistance and compliance of the patient's lungs and chest wall and by ET resistance and the compliance of the ventilator circuit. During pressure-targeted ventilation, the target pressure set on the ventilator determines the PIP. Patient-triggering efforts can increase or decrease PIP, depending on the patient-ventilator synchrony.<sup>5</sup>

P<sub>plat</sub> is the amount of pressure required to maintain the V<sub>T</sub> within the patient's lungs during a period of no gas flow. Therefore P<sub>plat</sub> reflects that alveolar pressure (P<sub>alv</sub>), and it is ultimately influenced by the V<sub>T</sub>, lung and thorax compliance, circuit elastance, and total measured PEEP [including applied and intrinsic (auto-PEEP)] (Key Point 10.4).

P<sub>plat</sub> can be measured by occluding the expiratory valve at the end of a tidal inspiration. Many current ICU ventilators have an inspiratory pause control incorporated into the ventilator system that closes the inspiratory and expiratory valves at the end of inspiration so that Pplat measurement can be obtained. As illustrated in Fig. 10.18, Pplat measurements require the establishment

Key Point 10.4 Pplat reflects alveolar pressure, and it is ultimately influenced by tidal volume, lung and thorax compliance, circuit elastance, and total measured PEEP.

of a period of zero flow for 1 to 2 seconds to allow pressure equilibration to occur across the airway. This delay in pressure equilibration and establishment of the  $P_{plat}$  is the result of redistribution of the  $V_T$  and stress relaxation. True  $P_{plat}$  measurements can be obtained only during a passive inspiration, and failure to establish a stable  $P_{plat}$  can result from patient breathing activity or a leak in the ventilator circuit.  $^{55,56}$ 

#### Flow Measurements

Gas flow during mechanical ventilation can be monitored with a number of different types of flow meters, including vortex ultrasonic flow meters, variable orifice pneumotachometers, thermal flow meters, and turbine flow meters. With these devices, volume changes can be calculated by integrating the flow signal relative to time. <sup>57,58</sup>

Vortex ultrasonic flow meters and variable orifice pneumotachometers use resistive elements to create a pressure drop that is proportional to the flow of gas through them.<sup>57</sup> Vortex ultrasonic flow meters use struts to create a partial obstruction to gas flow. As gases flow past these struts, whirlpools or vortices are produced. The frequency at which these whirlpools are produced is related to the flow of gas through the struts. These devices are not affected by the viscosity, density, or temperature of the gas being measured. They are unidirectional devices and therefore cannot be used to measure inspiratory and expiratory flow simultaneously.<sup>57</sup> The Servo-i (Getinge, Göteborg, Sweden) uses ultrasonic transducer technology to measure expiratory gas flow. Rather than struts, two ultrasonic transducers that alternate function are used. One acts as the transmitting device and the other as the receiver (Fig. 10.19). The ultrasonic waves detect the expiratory gas flow characteristics as the patient's exhaled air moves through the expiratory cassette and provide a measure of exhaled V<sub>T</sub>s and flows.

Variable orifice pneumotachometers are disposable, bidirectional flow measuring devices that use a variable area, flexible

obstruction for measuring flow as a function of the pressure differential generated by the obstruction. They contain minimal dead space (about 10 mL) and can measure flow from 0.02 to 3.0 L/s.<sup>59</sup> Although the flow-pressure characteristics of these devices are nonlinear, nonlinearity is typically compensated electronically (see Fig. 10.20). Variable orifice pneumotachometers are used in the Hamilton Medical ventilators (Hamilton Medical, Bonaduz, Switzerland) (Fig. 10.20).

Thermal flow meters ("hot wire" anemometers) use sensors that are temperature-sensitive, resistive elements (e.g., thermistor beads or heated wires). These devices operate on the principle that as gas passes over the thermistor bead or heated wire, the sensor

cools and its resistance changes in proportion to the gas flow. Note that the amount of cooling depends on the viscosity and thermal conductivity of the gas measured. With thermistor beads, cooling increases resistance, whereas with a heated platinum wire, cooling decreases resistance. The wire is typically heated above 37° C and protected by a low-resistance screen to prevent moisture accumulation and debris impaction on the wire. The gas flow can be calculated because the amount of power needed to maintain the temperature of the heating element above the temperature (e.g., 37° C) is related to the log of the velocity of gas flow and therefore must be linearized. Thermal flow meters are unidirectional devices and cannot be used for measuring bidirectional flows during breathing. It is important to recognize that the density and viscosity of the gas being measured can affect the accuracy and precision of the flow measurement. Correction factors for various gases can be applied through computer software.<sup>4</sup> Thermal anemometers are available with the Puritan Bennett 840 (Medtronics, Minneapolis, MN) and Dräger Oxylog 3000 (Dräger Medical Inc., Telford, PA) ventilators.

Turbine flow meters use a rotating vane that is placed in the path of gas flow. As gas flows through the device, the vane turns at a rate that depends on the flow rate of the gas. Gas flow therefore can be measured by counting the number of times the vane turns. This can be done mechanically by linking the vane to a needle attached to a calibrated display. The rate of gas flow can be measured electronically using a light beam that is interrupted each time the vane turns. Rotating vane devices are portable and easy to use; however, they are slow to respond to flow changes resulting from inertia and as such are inaccurate for measuring bidirectional flows. As discussed in Chapter 8 (Fig. 8.2), portable turbine flow meters can be used during patient-ventilator checks when a flow meter has not been incorporated into the ventilator's design.

# **Clinical Applications**

Respiratory systems mechanics data can provide valuable information for the clinician caring for a patient on mechanical ventilation. These data are generally divided into *measured* and *derived variables*. Measured variables include airway pressures, volumes, and airflow. Derived variables, which are calculated from measured values, include respiratory system compliance, airway resistance, and WOB. The following section is a brief description of how pathophysiological events and conditions can affect respiratory system mechanics.

#### **Measured Variables**

As mentioned previously, PIP reflects the total force that must be applied to overcome elastic and frictional forces offered by patient-ventilator systems, and  $P_{plat}$  represents that portion of the total pressure required to overcome only elastic forces. Increases in the elastance of the respiratory system (i.e., decreases in compliance of the lung and/or chest wall) will increase both peak and plateau pressures. Increases in respiratory system compliance will lower both PIP and  $P_{plat}$ . Increases in airway resistance increase PIP without concomitant increases in  $P_{plat}$ . Decreases in airway resistance  $(R_{aw})$  will lower PIP but not affect  $P_{plat}$ . It is important to recognize that changes in inspiratory flow or  $V_T$  should not be made when monitoring  $R_{aw}$  by this method. Also, the addition of PEEP (i.e., applied and intrinsic [auto-PEEP]) will affect both PIP and  $P_{plat}$  and should be taken into account (see the discussion on  $R_{aw}$  later in this chapter) (Key Point 10.5).

**Key Point** 10.5 Addition of PEEP (applied and auto-PEEP) affects both PIP and  $P_{plat}$  and should be considered when assessing changes in  $R_{aw}$ .

Sudden increases in PIP should alert the clinician to a potential problem such as bronchospasm or mucus plugging. Other factors that should be checked when determining the cause of increased airway resistance include partially blocked heat-moisture exchanger (HME), incorrect ET size, water in ventilator tubing, and malfunctioning expiratory valves. Increases in PIP can be associated with barotrauma or ventilator-induced lung injury; if these conditions are suspected,  $P_{\rm plat}$  should be monitored because alveolar overdistention and rupture are associated with high  $P_{\rm alv}$ , which in turn results in a higher  $P_{\rm plat}$ 

Airflow monitoring can alert the clinician to significant changes in the resistance or compliance (or both) of the patient's respiratory system. For example, high-frequency ripples on the inspiratory flow tracing can indicate turbulent flow caused by the presence of secretions in the airway or water in the ventilator circuit. <sup>54,59</sup> Expiratory flow limitations should be suspected if the decay in expiratory flow is linear rather than exponential (see Chapter 9). Flow measurements can be used to detect the presence of auto-PEEP, because flow will still be present at the end exhalation. This approach to detecting auto-PEEP is more of a qualitative assessment and does not provide an accurate measurement of the level of auto-PEEP (see Fig. 9.30).

#### **Derived Variables**

**Mean airway pressure.** The mean airway pressure  $(P_{aw})$  represents the average pressure recorded during the respiratory cycle. It is influenced by peak inspiratory pressure, PEEP, inspiratory time  $(T_I)$ , and total cycle time (TCT). It can be calculated using the following equation:

$$\overline{P}_{aw} = \frac{1}{2} \left[ (PIP - PEEP) \times \left( \frac{T_I}{TCT} \right) \right] + PEEP$$

 $\overline{P}_{aw}$  can also be obtained by integrating the area under the pressure-time curve. In most ICU ventilators, microprocessors incorporated into their electronic circuitry perform this calculation and provide a continuous display of  $P_{aw}$ . Oxygenation status can be significantly improved by increases in  $P_{aw}$ , and the application of PEEP has the greatest effect. However, excessive increases in  $P_{aw}$  can adversely affect cardiac performance and lead to significant reductions in cardiac output (see Chapter 11).

**Dynamic and static compliances.** Compliance can be simply defined as the lung volume achieved for a given amount of applied pressure. Two types of compliance calculations can be used to describe this pressure-volume relationship: dynamic compliance and static compliance. Dynamic compliance considers the total impedance to volume changes (i.e., flow resistive and elastic characteristics of the patient-ventilator interface); static compliance is only influenced by the elastic characteristics of the lung-thorax unit.

Dynamic compliance is calculated by dividing the exhaled  $V_{T}$  by the PIP minus the PEEP, or

Dynamic Compliance = Exhaled  $V_T/(PIP - PEEP)$ 

Static compliance is calculated by dividing the exhaled  $V_{T}$  by the  $P_{\text{plat}}$  minus the total PEEP

$$Static \ Compliance = Exhaled \ VT/\big(P_{plat} - PEEP\big)$$

It is important to recognize that the effects of intrinsic PEEP can underestimate the total PEEP.

Static compliance in healthy adult subjects is approximately 100 mL/cm  $\rm H_2O$ ; it is lower in adult patients receiving positive pressure ventilation. It ranges from 40 to 50 mL/cm  $\rm H_2O$  (men) and 35 to 45 mL/cm  $\rm H_2O$  (women) to as high as 100 mL/cm  $\rm H_2O$  in either sex. (Static compliance is approximately 40–50 mL/cm  $\rm H_2O$  in pediatric patients and 10–20 mL/cm  $\rm H_2O$  in neonates.) Pathophysiological conditions, such as pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, pleural effusion, hyperinflation, consolidation, respiratory distress syndrome, and pulmonary vascular engorgement, are associated with decreases in lung compliance. Conditions such as kyphoscoliosis and myasthenia gravis are also associated with increased chest wall elastic recoil and decreases in chest wall compliance.

Serial measurements of dynamic and static compliance provide considerably more information than single measurements can provide. For example, congestive heart failure will lead to pulmonary vascular engorgement and a reduction in both static and dynamic compliance. Diuretics therapy reduces the level of engorgement and improves static and dynamic compliance. Bronchospasm causes a decrease in dynamic compliance but does not always affect static compliance (static compliance may decrease if air trapping occurs). If bronchodilator therapy resolves the bronchospasm, dynamic compliance returns to normal.

#### Airway resistance

Airway resistance ( $R_{aw}$ ) is the opposition to airflow from nonelastic forces of the lung.  $R_{aw}$  for the respiratory system in a ventilated patient is about 5 to 7 cm  $H_2O/L/s$ . As mentioned in Chapter 1,  $R_{aw}$  is calculated by dividing the difference between PIP and  $P_{plat}$  by the airflow (constant flow with volume ventilation), or

$$R_{aw} = \frac{\left(PIP - P_{plat}\right)}{\dot{V}\left(\frac{L}{s}\right)}$$

Airway resistance is primarily determined by the diameter of the airway. A twofold decrease in airway diameter will result in a 16-fold increase in airway resistance (Poiseuille's law).† Retention of secretions, peribronchiolar edema, bronchoconstriction, or dynamic compression of the airways results in increased airway resistance. Bronchodilation results in reduced  $R_{\rm aw}$ .

#### Work of breathing

The normal WOB is related to the energy required to take in a breath. WOB is normally associated with nonelastic forces from gas moving through the airway and inertial forces to move structures in the thorax. *Intrinsic* work is a result of work done to overcome these normal elastic and resistive forces and work to

overcome a disorder or disease process affecting normal workloads in the lungs and thorax. For example, abnormal (increased) intrinsic work occurs in chronic bronchitis, in which the resistance to gas flow through the conductive airways increases. In fibrotic diseases of the lung, compliance is reduced and alveolar movement is restricted. This reduced movement impedes the ability of the lungs to expand, thus increasing intrinsic work.

*Extrinsic* work is work imposed (WOBi) by systems that are added to the patient. Common examples are the ET, trigger sensitivity, demand valve systems, the humidifying device, and the patient circuit.<sup>61</sup> Expiratory work is increased by the resistance offered by the exhalation valve or PEEP valve.

# Work of breathing defined

In physics, work (W) is defined as the product of force (F) acting on a mass to move it through a distance (d), or  $W = F \times d$ . In fluid systems, such as the respiratory system, we say that work is performed when an applied force or pressure causes a volume to displace, as in inspiration and expiration. The WOB is the integral of the product of pressure and volume (W = PV). That is, work is the amount of pressure that must be generated to result in the movement of a certain volume of gas. Work is reported in kilogrammeters (kg · m) or joules (J; 0.1 kg · m = 1 J). In healthy individuals, the WOB is about 0.5 J/L, which represents only 2% to 5% of the total  $\dot{V}O_2$  or 0.35 to 1.0 mL/L of ventilation.  $O_2$  consumption by the respiratory muscles may be as high as 35% to 40% of total VO2 in patients with COPD. WOB is sometimes described by the amount of O2 consumed by the working respiration muscles, although this is difficult to measure. WOB can also be defined as the pressure-time product when intrapleural pressure is monitored.

# **Graphic representation of WOB**

The WOB can now be monitored through the use of graphic displays and calculated data provided by newer microprocessor-controlled ventilators and special monitoring devices (esophageal pressure monitors). Note that the accuracy of the calculation still needs to be studied. The amount of work expended during a respiratory cycle can be estimated by multiplying the pressure changes associated with a given volume change, or  $W = P \times V$ . Alternatively, WOB can be calculated as W = (PIP - 0.5  $\times$  P<sub>plat</sub>)/100  $\times$  V<sub>T</sub> to estimate WOB during constant-flow passive inflation of the lungs.<sup>63</sup> A pressurevolume curve can be used to make this estimate.<sup>63</sup> Fig. 10.21 illustrates the pressure and volume changes that occur in a patient receiving controlled mechanical ventilation with a constant flow with the ventilator doing the resistive and elastic WOB.<sup>64</sup> Contrast this to Fig. 10.22, which shows WOB required during continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). In this figure, WOB is the integral of airway pressure and V<sub>T</sub>; the greater the area of the loop, the greater the WOB. Loop A is an example of a freestanding CPAP system. Spontaneous breaths occur clockwise—inspiration to expiration. Loop B is CPAP through a ventilator demand valve system and shows an increased WOBi. The area to the left of the vertical lines (baseline pressure of 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) is the WOBi during inspiration. The area to the right of the line represents WOBi during expiration.

Fig. 10.23 shows the components of a spontaneous breath and a ventilator breath. It distinguishes those parts of the breath that the patient must do and those parts that the ventilator provides.<sup>64</sup>

Fig. 10.24 compares the components of a normal spontaneous breath with a spontaneous breath with high impedance to breathing (ET in place) and with a mandatory controlled breath.<sup>65</sup>

 $<sup>^\</sup>dagger Poiseuille's$  law describes the factors that affect laminar flow through flow through a smooth tube with a constant diameter.  $\Delta P = V \times (8\eta 1)/\Pi r 4$  where  $\Delta P = driving pressure (dynes/cm²), <math display="inline">\eta = coefficient$  of viscosity of the gas, l = tube length (c 8 are constants). V = gas flow (mL/sec) radius of tube (cm) ( $\pi$  and 8 are constant).

Fig. 10.22 Work of breathing (WOB) during continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). WOB in this figure is the integral of airway pressure and tidal volume. Loop A is an example of a freestanding CPAP system. Spontaneous breaths occur clockwise—inspiration to expiration. Loop B is CPAP through a ventilator demand valve system. (From Hirsch C, Kacmarek RM, Stankek K: Work of breathing during CPAP and PSV imposed by the new generation mechanical ventilators: a lung model study, Respir Care 36:815—828, 1991; Kacmarek RM: The role of pressure support ventilation in reducing the work of breathing, Respir Care 33:99—120, 1988; and Kirby RR, Banner MJ, Downs JB: Clinical applications of ventilatory support, New York, 1990, Churchill-Livingstone.)

Curve A represents breathing through an ET by a patient with high impedance (increased R<sub>aw</sub> or decreased compliance, or both). This occurs during T-tube trials for ventilator liberation or during spontaneous breathing through a continuous flow system. Curve B represents the work done by the ventilator during a volumecontrolled breath. The ventilator is doing all the WOB. A spontaneous breath under normal conditions is represented by curve C.

Some have suggested that measuring the WOB in this way may underestimate the total amount of work that a patient expends during assisted ventilation.<sup>66</sup> Measurements of transdiaphragmatic pressures and pressure-time products may provide accurate estimates of the WOB and the metabolic cost of breathing in mechanically ventilated patients.<sup>67</sup>

#### Pressure-time product

Measurement of the maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximum expiratory pressure (MEP) provides nonspecific

information about the strength of respiratory muscles. It is possible to obtain more specific information about the contributions of diaphragmatic contractions on breathing by measuring transdiaphragmatic pressure and the pressure-time product.<sup>68,6</sup> Transdiaphragmatic pressure is a measure of the forcefulness of diaphragmatic contractions. The pressure-time product, which is an assessment of transdiaphragmatic pressure during the inspiratory portion of the breathing cycle, is one method of estimating the contributions of the diaphragm during inspiration. It is probably a better indication of a patient's effort to breathe than measurement of work derived from pressure-volume curves.

Fig. 10.25A shows the positioning of the two balloon-tipped catheters used to measure transdiaphragmatic pressures and thus the pressure-time product. The catheters are inserted through the nose; one is positioned in the stomach (below the diaphragm), and the other is positioned in the lower third of the esophagus (above the diaphragm). Gastric (PGA) and esophageal (Pes) pressures are

**Fig. 10.23** Pressure requirements for a spontaneous (*left*) and an assisted breath (*right*). The imposed work of breathing (WOBi) can occur during triggering of the breath. In the spontaneous breath, the patient performs work to overcome elastic and resistive forces, whereas in the assisted breath, the ventilator provides the work.  $C_L$ , Lung compliance.

(B) Patient receiving a controlled volume breath. (C) Spontaneous breath under normal circumstances.

measured during the respiratory cycle. The electronic difference between these two pressures is referred to as the *trans-diaphragmatic pressure*. When the transdiaphragmatic pressure is plotted over time, it provides a pressure-time curve that can be used to estimate the activity of the diaphragm (see Fig. 10.25B). Thus diaphragmatic activity during inspiration can be estimated by integrating the area within the curve during inspiration; the resultant value is called the *pressure-time product*. Increases in the pressure-time product indicate a greater force of contraction by the diaphragm. Conversely, decreases in the pressure-time product are associated with less muscular force.

Although some clinicians consider the pressure-time product a useful measurement for determining the effectiveness of

diaphragm function during weaning from mechanical ventilation, its use is limited in the clinical setting. <sup>69,70</sup>

# **Occlusion pressure measurements**

The occlusion pressure ( $P_{0.1s}$  or  $P_{100}$ ) is the airway pressure measured after occluding the airway during the first 100 msec of a patient's spontaneous inspiration. Clinical data suggest that  $P_{0.1}$  provides a useful index of ventilatory drive and may be used as a predictor of weaning success (i.e., elevated  $P_{0.1}$  is associated with weaning failure). For ventilator-dependent patients, the  $P_{0.1}$  has also been shown to correlate with the WOB during pressure support ventilation.<sup>71</sup> (See Chapter 20 for additional information on  $P_{0.1}$ .)

- Noninvasive monitoring has become common practice in the care of mechanically ventilated patients.
- Pulse oximeters, capnographs, and transcutaneous monitors have greatly improved the respiratory care practitioner's ability to monitor changes in patients' ABG levels.
- The presence of abnormal hemoglobin, such as COHb (smoke inhalation), produces an erroneously high S<sub>p</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and COoximetry should be performed to determine the true O<sub>2</sub> saturation.
- Exhaled NO measurements can be used to assess the severity of a patient's asthma exacerbation.
- Transcutaneous O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> measurements provide a noninvasive method of assessing oxygenation and ventilation status.
- Indirect calorimetry provides new insights about the nutritional status of spontaneously breathing and mechanically ventilated patients.
- Several factors can influence the metabolic rate, including the type and rate of food ingested, the time of day the measurements are made, the patient's level of physical activity, and whether the person is recovering from surgery or an acute or a chronic illness.
- The substrate utilization pattern is the proportion of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins that contribute to the total EE.
- Bedside mechanics testing is an invaluable resource for optimizing mechanical ventilatory support.
- Current ICU mechanical ventilators incorporate microprocessors that can provide breath-by-breath and summative reports of pressure and flow events along with calculations of airway resistance, respiratory compliance, and WOB.
- Dynamic compliance is influenced by flow resistive and elastic characteristics of the patient-ventilator interface, whereas static compliance is influenced only by elastic characteristics of the lung-thorax unit.
- Airway resistance is determined primarily by the diameter of the airway.
- WOB is influenced by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic factors include the elastic and resistive forces that must be overcome during inspiration and expiration. Extrinsic factors are related to the work imposed by systems that are added to the patient, such as ETs, demand valve systems, humidifying devices, and the exhalation valve or PEEP valve.
- The pressure-time product uses transdiaphragmatic pressure measurements to estimate the contributions of the diaphragm during inspiration.
