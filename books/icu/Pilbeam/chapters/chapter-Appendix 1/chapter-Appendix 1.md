# **Basic Terms and Concepts of Mechanical Ventilation**

- 1. Figs. 1.2 and 1.8 show how to draw these graphs. During spontaneous, quiet breathing, pleural pressure is always negative and ranges from approximately -5 to -10 cm  $H_2O$ . With positive pressure ventilation, pleural pressure can become positive at end inspiration but usually returns to its resting negative value (-5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) during exhalation.
- 2.  $5 \times 1.36 = 6.8 \text{ cm H}_2\text{O}$
- 3. Unit A would receive the greatest volume for the same pressure during a given inspiratory time. Unit A also has a shorter time constant (Time constant =  $R_{aw} \times C$ ). Unit B fills more slowly because it has increased resistance; that is, it has a greater (longer) time constant.
- 4. Unit B will fill more quickly. It is less compliant than unit A; therefore its time constant  $(R_{aw} \times C)$  will have a smaller value. Stiff alveoli with poor compliance fill quickly, but they do not fill with the same volume for a given pressure. If pressure delivery to both units is the same, unit A will have a greater volume. Recall that  $C = \Delta V/\Delta P$  and  $\Delta V = C \times \Delta P.$
- 5. Lung units vary in filling and emptying times on the basis of their compliance and resistance. Less compliant lung units fill faster, and those with higher Raw fill more slowly.

#### **How Ventilators Work**

- 1. Bird Mark 7 ventilator. These devices typically have been used for administering intermittent positive pressure breathing treatments.
- 2. LTV 1000 and LTV 1125 Ventilators (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ); Newport HT 50 Ventilator (Newport Medical Instruments, Costa Mesa, CA).
- 3. Negative pressure ventilator.
- When the ventilator begins inspiratory gas flows through the main inspiratory tube, gas also flows through the expiratory valve line to the exhalation valve, closing the valve (see Fig. 2.8A cutaway). During exhalation, the flow from the ventilator stops and the exhalation valve opens. The patient is able to exhale passively through the expiratory port in the exhalation valve.

#### **Chapter 3**

#### How a Breath Is Delivered

- 1.  $P_{mus} + P_{vent} = V/C + (R_{aw} \times flow)$
- 2. The volume of air in the lungs depends on the elastic recoil pressure, which is the pressure resulting from alveolar tension on the volume within alveoli. Elastic recoil pressure (P<sub>E</sub>) is the elastic load offered by the lungs and chest wall that must be overcome to move air into the lungs during inspiration. Note that elastance is the inverse of compliance.
- 3. A
- 4. Pressure-targeted ventilation, pressure ventilation.
- 6. With pressure-controlled breaths, the pressure waveform is constant during inspiration, and volume and flow can vary with changes in lung characteristics, the set pressure, or the patient's inspiratory effort. With volume-controlled breaths, volume delivery is constant, and the volume and flow waveforms remain unchanged during inspiration. The pressure waveform can vary with changes in lung characteristics.

- 7. A pressure of 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O to start would provide approximately the same V<sub>T</sub> delivery in VC-CMV and would be a safe starting point. This patient requires high pressures for delivery of V<sub>T</sub>. P<sub>alv</sub> should be kept below 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O.
- 8. Apparently, the ventilator has a fixed flow and pattern during inspiration that is not adequate for the patient's needs. The therapist should increase the inspiratory flow and see if this solves the problem. Another possible solution is to switch to another ventilator that allows additional flow on demand during VC-CMV.
- 9. There are several options: switch the patient to PC-IMV with a lower mandatory rate; switch the patient to PSV; switch to VS. Although any of these options would allow for more spontaneous ventilation, it is important to monitor the  $S_pO_2$ ,  $V_T$ , and  $\dot{V}_E$  closely.
- 10. A dual control mode that limits pressure (e.g., PRVC) may be appropriate for this situation. This mode would limit pressure delivery while simultaneously allowing for a targeted volume in an effort to maintain the patient's minute ventilation.

#### Chapter 6

#### **Initial Ventilator Settings**

- 1.  $C_T = 100 \text{ mL/33 cm H}_2\text{O} = 3 \text{ mL/cm H}_2\text{O}$ Volume lost to circuit = 3 mL/cm  $H_2O \times 15$  cm  $H_2O = 45 \text{ mL}$
- 2. The  $\dot{V}_E = 700 \text{ mL} \times 15 = 10.5 \text{ L/min}$ Set  $V_T$  (250 mL) – Volume lost (45 mL) = About 205 mL

- 3.  $\dot{V}_E = 700 \text{ mL} \times 15 = 10.5 \text{ L/min}$ 
  - A. If the flow is set at 30 L/min using a constant flow pattern, the flow in L/s is 30 L/60 s = 0.5 L/s.
  - B. The TCT based on the set machine *f* of 12 breaths/min is 5
  - C. The TCT based on the actual machine f of 15 breaths/min is 4 seconds.
  - D. The  $T_I$  based on the set f, flow, and  $V_T:T_I = 0.7$  L/ (0.5 L/s) = 1.4 seconds.
  - E. The  $T_E$  when f is 12 is 3.6 seconds.
  - F. The  $T_E$  when f is 15 is 2.6 seconds.
- 4. C
- 5. The patient is actively breathing during the plateau period.
- - A. The patient's BSA is approximately 2.12 m<sup>2</sup>.
  - B. His ideal body weight is 160 lb, or about 73 kg.
  - C. Before correction for body temperature, the  $\dot{V}_{\rm E}$  is 8.48 L/min. This is reduced by 18% (10% per degree Celsius). Eighteen percent of 8.48 is about 1.53 L. 8.48 - 1.53 is a final V<sub>E</sub> of 6.95 L/min. In postoperative open heart surgery patients, the body temperature is sometimes cooler than normal. Patients warm up quickly and usually recover from the anesthesia quickly. As the patient warms up, the V<sub>E</sub> would need to be increased. Either CMV or IMV modes would be appropriate with a safe rate and V<sub>T</sub> setting.
  - D. Because the surgeon is concerned about pressure, you may want to choose PC-CMV.
  - E. V<sub>T</sub> would be targeted between 6 and 8 mL/kg IBW (i.e., 438 and 584 mL/kg). The patient weighs 210 lb; however, V<sub>T</sub> is based on IBW, not actual weight. This is a common mistake among new practitioners. (Note that the V<sub>T</sub> would be targeted between 570 mL and 760 mL [range of mL/kg IBW] if the actual body weight of 210 lb was used.) However, V<sub>T</sub> is based on IBW, not actual weight; this is a common mistake among new practitioners.
  - F. An appropriate rate based on a V<sub>T</sub> of about 438 mL  $(0.438 = 16 \text{ breaths/min}; \text{ based on a V}_T \text{ of } 0.584 \text{ L}) \text{ would}$ be (6.95 L/min)/0.584 L = 11 breaths/min.
  - G. Because the physician is concerned about pressure, a low compensating PEEP of about 3 cm H<sub>2</sub>O would be a good starting point.
- 7. The patient's IBW is 105 + 5(64 60) = 125 lb, or 56.8 kg. However, she weighs 195 lb (about 87 kg); therefore she has a large BSA (about 1.94 m<sup>2</sup>). Her estimated  $\dot{V}_{\rm E}$  (assuming normal body temperature, etc.) is  $3.5 \times 1.94$ , or about 6.8 L/min. If the  $\dot{V}_{\rm E}$  had been based on IBW, it would have underestimated her metabolic rate. However, her V<sub>T</sub> must be based on IBW.

Remember, when a person gains weight, his or her lungs do not

Using the calculated IBW, an appropriate V<sub>T</sub> for a patient with ARDS would be in the range of 4 to 8 mL/kg. For the patient this range would be about 230 to 450 mL. A respiratory rate of 15 (using 8 mL/kg) to 30 (using 4 mL/kg) breaths/min would be in the target range. A higher rate may accompany a lower V<sub>T</sub>. It might be appropriate to start in the middle of the ranges (e.g., 6 mL/kg). For example, setting a V<sub>T</sub> of 350 mL and a rate of 20 breaths/min PV would probably provide patient comfort and would be suitable for this patient, particularly based on her diagnosis. The pressure could be set to target the desired V<sub>T</sub>.

- 8. Try increasing the IPAP to 11 cm  $H_2O$  and reevaluate the patient. The  $V_T$  should be 420 to 560 mL (range, 6–8 mL/kg IBW), and the spontaneous rate should be below 25 breaths/min.
- 9. The  $\rm \widetilde{V}_{E}$  should be increased by 10%, or 5% for every degree  $>\!99^{\circ}$  F.
- 10. Change to a descending waveform with volume ventilation would change the pattern of pressure delivery, resulting in a decrease in PIP. This was an actual case. After making the adjustment, the resulting PIP was 41 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and the P<sub>plat</sub> was 32 cm H<sub>2</sub>O without any other changes.
- 11. The lung characteristics are deteriorating; that is, either R<sub>aw</sub> is increasing or the lung compliance is decreasing, or both.
- 12. Volume support ventilation.

#### **Final Considerations in Ventilator Setup**

14 breaths/min

1.

Initial 
$$\dot{V}_{\rm E}=4\times1.5=6$$
 L/min  $V_{\rm T}$  is based on IBW IBW = 106 + 6 = 154 lb, or 70 kg  $V_{\rm T}$  range of 6 to 8 mL/kg = 280 to 560 mL Example: At 6 mL/kg, initial  $V_{\rm T}=420$  mL (0.42 L) Rate using selected  $V_{\rm T}$  and  $\dot{V}_{\rm E}=\dot{V}_{\rm E}/V_{\rm T}=6/0.42=14; f=$ 

- 2. Over a 2-hour period, the  $\dot{V}_{\rm E}$  increased from 6.5 to 13 L/min. The patient is using accessory muscles to breathe, and the pressure—time curve indicates an inadequate flow. PIP has also increased. These findings suggest the development of air trapping; therefore evaluate for the presence of intrinsic PEEP. Increase the inspiratory gas flow and reassess the pressure—time curve. Assess the patient's ventilatory pattern to determine whether the problem persists. Another possibility is to switch to VC-IMV + PSV; however, inspiratory flow would still need to be increased and PSV would have to be
  - set at an appropriate level. Other questions might also be asked. Can you think of any? For example, what is the  $S_pO_2$ ? Have the ABG values changed? Have breath sounds changed? What does the flow—time curve look like?
- 3. (NOTE: A number of solutions are possible for this problem. The following answer is provided as one option.) Initial  $V_T$  is selected at 6 mL/kg (420 mL). Because this patient has a history of COPD, a lower  $V_T$  setting was selected to reduce the risk for lung injury.  $\dot{V}_E$  is set at 8 L/min:  $4\times BSA=4\times 1.78=7.12$  L/min. Increase  $\dot{V}_E$  by 5% per degree Fahrenheit:  $T=102^{\circ}F$ , or 15%. Increase by 1.05 L/min to a total  $\dot{V}_E$  of 8.2 L/min. Rate is set at 19 breaths/min ( $\dot{V}_E/V_T=f$ ). Flow is set at 80 L/min using the descending flow pattern.  $F_1O_2$  is set at 0.5 initially. (NOTE: Because the patient is breathing spontaneously, a lower f and  $\dot{V}_E$  could be used, depending on the clinician's preference. The  $F_1O_2$  could be lower as well. The settings selected here would provide a minimum safe initial form of ventilation and could be adjusted on the basis of patient assessment.)

Resistance is estimated at  $P_{TA}/Flow$ , or 8 cm  $H_2O/80$  L/min: 8 cm  $H_2O/(1.33$  L/s) = 6 cm  $H_2O/(L/s)$ . This answer is only an estimate because the flow is not constant. Pressure support is set at 6 cm  $H_2O$ . This is an example of initiating ventilatory support in a patient with COPD. Note the use of a lower  $V_T$  setting, the  $\dot{V}_E$  increase because of the patient's temperature, and the use of pressure support for spontaneous breaths set high enough to overcome the resistance imposed by the airway. The patient's breathing must be evaluated to ensure comfort, patient—ventilator synchrony, and reduced work of breathing (WOB).

4. Postoperative patients and victims of drug overdose are examples of patients who are most likely to have normal lungs yet

still require ventilation. Appropriate settings for normal lungs are as follows:

VC-CMV or PC-CMV

 $V_T=6\ to\ 8\ mL/kg$ 

f = 10 to 15 breaths/min

Descending or constant flow waveform

 $T_{\rm I} = About \ 1$  second initially

PEEP  ${\leq}5$  cm  $H_2O;$  kept  $P_{plat} {<}30$  cm  $H_2O$ 

 $F_IO_2 \le \! 0.5$  (titrate to patient's normal; maintain  $P_aO_2 \! > \! 70$  mm Hg and  $S_pO_2 \ge \! 92\%)$ 

For this patient a  $V_T$  range of 480 to 640 mL would be appropriate.  $\dot{V}_E$  would equal  $4\times1.8=7.2$  L/min. Rate would range from 11 to 18 breaths/min. An  $F_1O_2$  of 0.5, a PEEP of 3 cm  $H_2O$ , a descending flow ramp, and a VCCMV would all be appropriate settings.

- 1. C. a, b, and d refer to times when a ventilator check is performed.
- 2. A
- 3. D
- 4. B.  $V_{Danat}$  is equal to about 180 mL (80 kg IBW  $\times$  2.2 lb = 176 lb). With an ET in place, the  $V_{Danat}$  is reduced by about half to 90 mL. The HME adds about 50 mL of mechanical dead space.  $V_D$  is about 140 mL.  $V_T V_D = V_A$ ;  $V_A = 400 140 = 260$  mL/breath.
- 5. B. When the flow is zero (before exhalation begins), the pressure on the pressure—time curve for the same time interval will be  $P_{\rm plat}$ .
- 6. A
- 7. C
- 8. D (the difference between PIP and P<sub>plat</sub> is increasing).
- 9. An increase in R<sub>aw</sub>, as might occur with bronchoconstriction or mucous plugging.
- 10.  $V_T=0.55$  mL,  $V_{Danat}=150$  mL,  $\dot{V}_A=(0.55-0.15)\times 8=3.2$  L/min
- 11. This scenario actually describes the use of MLT. The best choice is *B*; check the cuff pressure and delivered volume. It is the safest choice without knowing whether MLT or MOV is used.
- 12. The cuff pressure is much too high and will result in reduced blood flow to the adjacent tracheal walls.

The tube is too small for this patient. The best choice is C; change the ET to a size 8 Fr.

- 13. C. The change in  $V_T$  may be the result of an improvement in lung characteristics (e.g., a decrease in  $R_{\rm aw}$  or an improvement in  $C_L$ ). Listen to the breath sounds, evaluate the flow—time and volume—time curves, and check the current acid—base status. Changes in  $V_T$  may lead to respiratory alkalosis. The preset pressure may need to be reduced.
- 14. C. Because no air leak is heard, MOV probably has been used to inflate the ET cuff. The measurement technique is accurate if done appropriately: that is, if the system was pressurized before the pilot balloon connection was attached to the manometer. This is a low pressure and would not interfere with tracheal blood flow.

15. Answer *A* is the most immediate fix. If the patient is to be ventilated for an extended period, it might be appropriate to change the ET (answer *B*).

- A. The arrow indicates an active exhalation by the patient.
- B. The flow cycle criterion might be increased to a higher percentage so that  $T_I$  is shorter.
- C. The expiratory flow pattern at *arrow B* indicates air trapping.
- D. Shortening the  $T_I$  might allow a longer time for exhalation and eliminate this problem. Suctioning of the patient or administration of a bronchodilator might be indicated to reduce  $R_{aw}.$  Because this is PSV, reducing the set pressure might reduce both  $V_T$  and  $\dot{V}_E,$  thus reducing air trapping. However, this type of adjustment would have to be monitored to ensure that the patient is still adequately ventilated.
- E. The prolonged exhalation of volume suggests airway resistance; checking a flow—volume loop might confirm this finding.
- F. It is set at a high percentage of the peak flow.
- G. The pressure—time curve does not have a concave appearance; however, the curve would not take this shape with pressure-targeted ventilation. The patient can get as much flow as needed, and the pressure will be maintained. The ventilator would increase flow to achieve the set pressure if the patient were actively inhaling. As long as a rise time or slope does not reduce inspiratory flow, inadequate flow should not be a problem.
- 2. Answers to questions regarding the figure featured below Question 2: flow, pressure, and volume scalars for three different ventilation situations, *A*:
  - A. The target variable is pressure. The mode could be PC-CMV, but there are not enough breaths to determine whether it is PC-CMV or PC-IMV. The breath shown is time triggered, pressure targeted, and time cycled (flow drops to zero before end inspiration).
  - B. The set pressure is 20 cm  $H_2O$ .
  - C. V<sub>T</sub> is 500 mL.
  - D. P<sub>plat</sub> is 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. Because the flow drops to zero during inspiration, there is a period of no flow before exhalation begins. The pressure at that time is the same at the ventilator and in the lungs.
  - E. A leak is present; the inspired and expired volumes are not the same.
- Answers to questions regarding the figure featured below Question 2: flow, pressure, and volume scalars for three different ventilation situations, B:
  - A. The target variable is volume. The mode of ventilation is VC-CMV. You can tell it is volume targeted because it has a constant flow curve. You can tell it is CMV because you can see the beginning of a second breath, and it is also a mandatory breath.
  - B. The total cycle time in this example is 3.5 seconds.
  - C. The breath is patient triggered.
  - D. On the basis of the pressure—time curve, the problem is inadequate flow.

- 4. Answers to questions regarding the figure featured below Question 2: flow, pressure, and volume scalars for three different ventilation situations, *C*:
  - A. The set flow is about 40 L/min.
  - B. The patient is actively inhaling during inspiration, and the ventilator is providing additional flow. This is probably a newer-generation ICU ventilator with a responsive inspiratory valve.
  - C. Volume delivery will increase because the patient can demand more flow than the set amount.
- 5. Answers to question 5 regarding the Figure of P-V loop:
  - A. APIP is about 17.5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O.
  - B. The delivered  $V_T$  is about 700 mL.
  - C. The pressure—volume loop begins at a pressure of zero; therefore no PEEP has been set.
  - D. Compliance is about 40 mL/cm H<sub>2</sub>O.
  - E.  $P_{TA}$  is about 7 cm  $H_2O$ , which is slightly higher than normal.
  - F. The appearance of the pressure—volume loop indicates that the patient has increased  $R_{\rm aw}$ .
- 6. Answers to question 6 regarding the Figure of F-V loop:
  - A. The target variable is volume because the flow is constant.
  - B. The flow setting is 60 L/min, and the flow waveform is constant (rectangular).
  - C.  $V_T$  is 500 mL.
  - D. The artifact indicated by *arrow A* is the compressible volume from the patient circuit leaving the circuit at the beginning of exhalation.
  - E. Arrow B indicates air trapping (auto-PEEP).
  - F. Increased Raws
- 7. PIP and  $P_{plat}$  will increase, and  $T_I$  and  $V_T$  will stay the same.
- 8.  $P_{set}$  and  $T_I$  will remain constant, but  $V_T$  will increase.

9

- A.  $P_{alv}$  is 35 cm  $H_2O$ . Compliance has nothing to do with the answer. We know the pressure because flow drops to zero during inspiration (the alveolar and preset pressures equilibrate).
- B.  $V_T$  will be 0.525 L: Volume = Pressure  $\times$  Compliance; Volume = 35 cm  $H_2O$   $\times$  15 mL/cm  $H_2O$  = 525 mL (0.525 L).
- C. After compliance improves to 30 mL/cm  $H_2O$ , volume delivery will increase: Volume = 35 cm  $H_2O \times 0.03$  mL/cm  $H_2O = 1.05$  L (1050 mL).  $P_{TA}$  will be approximately the same because the generating pressure is the same and  $R_{aw}$  is not increased. (Actually,  $P_{TA}$  will decrease slightly as the flow drops off when  $P_{alv}$  approaches the preset pressure.)
- D. Reduce the preset pressure until the desired  $V_T$  is achieved. (This would be approximately half the previous setting because compliance doubled [about 17–18 cm  $H_2O$ ].)

#### **Assessment of Respiratory Function**

 As Fig. 10.8 illustrates, the capnographic waveform is divided into four phases. In phase 1, the initial gas exhaled is from the conducting airways, which contain low levels of CO<sub>2</sub>. During phase 2, alveolar gas containing CO<sub>2</sub> mixes with gas in the anatomical airways and the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration increases. In

- phase 3, the curve plateaus as alveolar gas is exhaled (this phase is often referred to as the *alveolar plateau*). Note that the concentration of  $CO_2$  at the end of the alveolar phase (just before inspiration begins) is called the *end-tidal PCO*<sub>2</sub> or  $P_{et}CO_2$ . On inspiration (phase 4), the concentration falls to zero.
- 2. The pressure—time product, which is an assessment of transdiaphragmatic pressure during the inspiratory portion of the breathing cycle, is a way of estimating the contributions of the diaphragm during inspiration.

### Methods to Improve Ventilation in Patient-Ventilator Management

- 1.
- A. Mandatory  $\dot{V}_{A}=8\times(400-140)=2.08$  L/min; spontaneous  $\dot{V}_{A}=25\times(225-140)=2.13$  L/min; total  $\dot{V}_{A}=2.08+2.13=4.21$  L/min
- B.  $C_S = 400/20 = 20 \text{ mL/cm H}_2\text{O}$
- C. The patient has a respiratory acidosis. In addition, his spontaneous breathing rate is high, and his spontaneous  $V_T$  is low, indicating a high WOB. His  $P_{\text{set}}$  is within safe limits. The  $CO_2$  can be reduced by increasing the

pressure to increase the  $V_T$  or by increasing the set rate. Increasing the  $P_{set}$  to 29 cm  $H_2O$  theoretically would increase the  $V_T$  to 870 mL (about 14 mL/kg) and reduce the  $P_aCO_2$  to 40 mm Hg. This is a high  $V_T$ . On the other hand, increasing the set rate to 12 breaths/min would also reduce the  $CO_2$  to 40 mm Hg. In addition, using PSV to overcome the work required to move air through the resistance of the ET would reduce the patient's spontaneous WOB. PSV also could be used to reduce the  $P_aCO_2$  instead of changing the mandatory rate or volume.

- 2. Increase the mandatory f to 10 breaths/min to return the patient to a  $P_aCO_2$  closer to his normal value. Add PSV of about 8 cm  $H_2O$  for spontaneous breaths to reduce spontaneous WOB.
- 3. IBW for this patient is 106+6=130 lb, or 59 kg. The set  $V_T$  is too high and has been based on actual weight, not IBW. PIP and  $P_{plat}$  are high because of the large  $V_T$ . Reduce the volume to 500 mL. The current  $\dot{V}_E$  of 9 L/min results in a normal acid—base status. With  $P_{plat}$  at 35 cm  $H_2O$  for a volume of 1.00 L,  $C_S$  is about 29 mL/cm  $H_2O$ . A  $V_T$  set at 0.5 L should produce a safer  $P_{plat}$ . The rate could be adjusted to 16 to 18 breaths/min, which would provide an adequate  $\dot{V}_E$ .
- No change should be made at this time. If the ICP can be managed with medical intervention, the patient does not need to be hyperventilated.

With this technique, two electrodes are placed on the skin along a nerve path, often near a hand, foot, or facial nerve. An electrical current consisting of four impulses is applied to the peripheral nerve over 2 seconds; the muscle contractions (twitches) produced provide information about the level of paralysis.

PPV (with or without PEEP) can reduce cardiac output and MABP, it is reasonable to assume that CPP would also decrease during PPV in these patients.

### Effects of Positive Pressure Ventilation on the Pulmonary System

- 3. The RT might consider performing a recruitment maneuver that would include recruitment to open the lung, derecruitment to establish the deflation point (UIP during derecruitment), and then rerecruiting the lungs. It might be argued that a static pressure—volume curve could establish an LIP, but current research supports the use of the deflation point (see Chapter 13).
- 4. In patients with high chest wall and abdominal pressures, the restriction of lung movement caused by a rigid thoracic compartment may provide some protection from elevating transpulmonary pressures. The same would be true if a patient were in the prone position. In this situation the increase in  $P_{\text{plat}}$  probably is permissible and will not cause VILI. Another option might be to allow the  $P_aCO_2$  to increase to maintain a lower  $P_{\text{plat}}$ .

#### **Troubleshooting and Problem Solving**

- 1. The breath sounds and the ET marking at the teeth suggest that the tube may have migrated into the right mainstem bronchus when the patient was moved. The RT should check the original tube position from the chart. The tube must be withdrawn about 3 to 4 cm, and the breath sounds must be reevaluated. A chest radiograph may also be required.
- 2. D
- 3. C
- 4. D
- 5. D
- 6. Tachypnea; nasal flaring; diaphoresis; use of accessory muscles; retraction of the suprasternal, supraclavicular, and intercostal spaces; paradoxical or abnormal movement of the thorax and abdomen; abnormal findings on auscultation; tachycardia; and possibly arrhythmias and hypotension. When severe distress is confirmed, the initial step is to

- disconnect the patient from the ventilator and carefully begin manual ventilation. If the patient's distress immediately resolves, the problem originates with the ventilator. If the distress does not resolve, the problem originates with the patient. Continue assessment until the problem is solved.
- 7. Intubation apparently resulted in insertion of the tube into the right mainstem bronchus. After 4 hours of ventilation at a high O<sub>2</sub> percentage, the left lung has collapsed, resulting in the dull percussion of this area, absence of breath sounds, and tracheal shifting. The tube must be repositioned, breath sounds must be reevaluated, and a chest radiograph is necessary to confirm tube placement.
- 8. The most likely cause is an air leak around the tube cuff. Inflate the cuff using MLT or minimum occluding volume and measure the cuff pressure. Listen again over the tracheal area to make sure the cuff is not leaking. Another possible cause is migration of the ET upward, above the vocal cords. Check the centimeter markings at the teeth.
- 9. D. The drop in volume on a pressure-limited machine could be caused by leaks, a decrease in CL, an increase in R<sub>aw</sub>, or gastric distention from air swallowing from high pressures, resulting in decreased diaphragmatic excursion or a change in the patient's inspiratory effort. Perform a general visual assessment of the patient. Check around the face mask for leaks and listen to breath sounds.
- 10. Breath sounds suggest the presence of a pneumothorax, possibly a tension pneumothorax, in the right hemithorax. Contact a physician immediately for placement of a chest tube and continue to ventilate the patient manually with 100%  $\rm O_2$ .
- 11. The graphics demonstrate that auto-PEEP is present (flow does not return to zero before a mandatory breath begins, similar to the findings in Fig. 18.8), that the machine is not responding to patient effort, and that inspiratory flow is set too low for patient demand (concave appearance of pressure—time curve, similar to Fig. 18.3). Increase inspiratory flow to shorten T<sub>I</sub> and lengthen T<sub>E</sub> to try to eliminate auto-PEEP and provide the needed flow demand. If this is unsuccessful, consider using external PEEP to make triggering easier for the patient. Perhaps VC-CMV is not the best mode for this patient. Consider other alternatives, such as changing the flow waveform.
- 12. B. A leak exists in the system.
- 13. The patient will need further assessment, including vital signs, pulse oximetry, ABG values, and a chest examination. More information about the ventilator settings is needed. An immediate concern is the high cuff pressure requirements. The tube size is too small for this patient; change to a larger tube.
- 14. It may be appropriate to do a recruitment maneuver on this patient because this condition is secondary, nonpulmonary ARDS. Resetting PEEP after recruitment may be indicated. Another option is to use permissive hypercapnia. Eliminate any contraindications to this treatment and assess the patient's tolerance of this ventilation technique. The patient may need sedation but may already be sedated because the I/E ratio is 1:1.
- 15. D. All the choices are possibly correct in this situation, depending on the circumstances.
  - A. If the patient is on a face mask rather than connected with a TT or ET, heated humidity may not be necessary and, in

- fact, may be uncomfortable if used. The heated humidifier may not have been turned, may not be set to a warm enough temperature, or may have been turned off the last time the equipment was changed.
- B. The heater may not be functioning.
- C. If the system had recently been changed, condensate would not have had a chance to build up in the circuit.
- D. Depletion of the water supply to the humidifier reservoir could also result in lack of rain-out and inadequate humidification.
- 16. The patient's condition improved after treatment.
- 17. If a chest tube is in place, a leak may exist from the lung into the chest drainage system.
- 18. From the pressure graphic and the patient's description, the patient is apparently not getting sufficient inspiratory gas flow. The pressure setting seems inadequate considering the C<sub>S</sub> and R<sub>aw</sub>. The flow can be determined by rearranging the equation for calculating Raw. (NOTE: During PSV and PCV,  $P_{set}$  may be used in place of  $P_{TA}$  to calculate the answer:  $R_{aw} = P_{TA}/Flow$  [or  $P_{set}/Flow$ ].) The maximum available flow is approximately equal to P<sub>set</sub> divided by R<sub>aw</sub> (Flow =  $P_{set}/R_{aw}$ ). Flow = 12 cm  $H_2O/12$  cm  $H_2O/L/s$  = approximately 1 L/s, or 60 L/min. This flow is apparently inadequate for the patient. The pressure needs to be increased to increase the available flow. (NOTE: If you got this answer correct, you're really beginning to use analytical thinking. This required the use of some advanced problem-solving skills and a modified equation that wasn't previously used. [Sometimes questions are used for teaching!])
- 19. The graphics show that  $T_I$  is short and flow is not returning to zero during inspiration. Increasing the T<sub>I</sub> provides more time for P<sub>set</sub> to reach the alveolar level and increase V<sub>T</sub> delivery.
- 20. The patient's lung characteristics may have changed, and the current inspiratory pressure and/or flow are now too low, resulting in a longer T<sub>I</sub>.
- 21. The machine is not set sensitive enough to the patient's inspiratory effort.
- 22. The patient has developed auto-PEEP since the setting change. A possible solution is to increase inspiratory gas flow to shorten T<sub>I</sub> and increase T<sub>E</sub>. Another possible solution is to return the ventilator to the previous settings and use a lower V<sub>E</sub> to eliminate auto-PEEP.
- 23. Further information about the patient is needed before a solution can be found. Does the patient have ALI or ARDS? Is a recruitment maneuver indicated? Currently the PEEP is at zero. At the very least, PEEP apparently needs to be set above the P<sub>flex</sub> point. It would be better, depending on the patient's problem, to use the deflection point on the pressure-volume curve after a recruitment maneuver.

### **PART 2: CASE STUDY ANSWER KEY**

# **Chapter 1: Basic Terms and Concepts of Mechanical Ventilation**

#### Case Study 1.1

Determine Static Compliance (C<sub>5</sub>) and Airway Resistance (R<sub>aw</sub>). Compliance is 0.5/19, or 0.0263 L/cm H<sub>2</sub>O (26.3 mL/cm H<sub>2</sub>O), and R<sub>aw</sub> is estimated to be 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O/L/s. The patient's compliance is very low, suggesting that some condition is making the lungs stiffer than normal and increasing her work of breathing. Raw is low considering that the patient has an artificial airway in

### **Chapter 2: How Ventilators Work** Case Study 2.1

Ventilator Selection. Because the patient's room has only pipedin O2, you would have to select an electrically powered ventilator with a built-in compressor. You could use an external 50 psig compressor, although some compressors are noisy. The availability of the O2 source would allow you to provide O2 as needed for the patient.

# Chapter 3: How a Breath Is Delivered Case Study 3.1

#### **Patient Triggering**

Problem 1: The machine is not sensitive enough to the patient's effort. The clinician should increase the ventilator sensitivity control.

Problem 2: The machine is too sensitive and is autotriggering into inspiration. The clinician should reduce the sensitivity.

#### Case Study 3.2

**Premature Breath Cycling.** The ventilator pressure-cycled when the patient coughed and increased the peak airway pressure sensed by the ventilator during the breath. With newer ICU ventilators, excess pressures are less likely to occur when a patient coughs because these devices incorporate "floating" exhalation valves.

### **Chapter 4: Establishing the Need for Mechanical Ventilation**

#### Case Study 4.1

**Stroke Victim.** The patient should be intubated to protect the airway and immediately evaluated for cerebral reperfusion therapy. The patient is typically admitted to the ICU after reperfusion therapy is completed for further evaluation (i.e., vital signs, SpO2 monitoring, ECG, breath sounds, ABG values, electrolytes, and neurological status). Mechanical ventilation may be necessary if the patient remains unconscious and unresponsive. In cases in which the patient is not receiving mechanical ventilation, aerosol therapy delivered through a Briggs T-adapter is required to prevent drying of secretions. Additional information regarding the treatment of stroke can be found at http://stroke.ahajournals.

### Case Study 4.2

**Unexplained Acute Respiratory Failure.** There are at least two possible solutions:

- 1. The problem may be drug related (e.g., narcotic overdose); try naloxone (Narcan).
- 2. Intubate and begin ventilation; assess further with vital signs,  $S_pO_2$  monitoring, ECG, breath sounds, ABG values, electrolytes, blood alcohol levels, toxicology screening, and neurological status evaluation.

# Case Study 4.3

#### **Ventilation in Neuromuscular Disorders**

Case 1: In spite of this patient's inability to maintain a tight seal around the mouthpiece, the measured parameters are acceptable. It is prudent, however, to use a mouth seal for this patient for subsequent measurements. Continue to monitor MIP and VC for at least every 8 hours. Request an evaluation of an anticholinesterase challenge. Keep the patient NPO and provide suctioning at the bedside until swallowing ability can be evaluated. Monitor  $\rm S_pO_2$  and/or ABG values if symptoms become worse.

Case 2: The history and symptoms suggest Guillain-Barré syndrome. Assessment of this patient should include measurement of MIP and VC along with arterial blood gas analysis. A reduced MIP (<15 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) and VC (<10–15 mL/kg) plus the presence of acute ventilatory failure would be consistent with respiratory muscle weakness associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome. Mechanical ventilation is indicated. Consider the advantages and disadvantages of using noninvasive ventilation and oral versus nasal endotracheal intubation, or consider a tracheostomy. The RT may also suggest an anticholinesterase challenge to confirm the diagnosis.

#### Case Study 4.4

**Asthma Case.** The patient's condition appears to be improving. Continue drug therapy, adjusting the medication dosages and frequency as needed according to Expert Panel Review—3 recommendations. Continue to monitor the patient.

# **Chapter 5: Selecting the Ventilator and Mode** *Case Study 5.1*

#### What type of breath is it?

- 1. This is a patient-controlled machine breath. The  $V_T$  is delivered by the ventilator and the ventilator cycles the breath.
- 2. This is a spontaneous breath, and these variables describe CPAP. The patient is controlling the start time (trigger) and the  $V_{\rm T}$  (cycle).

#### Case Study 5.2

# Pressure Control (PC-CMV) or Volume Control Ventilation (VC-CMV)

1. When it is desirable to target  $P_aCO_2$ , volume control ventilation may be used because it can guarantee volume delivery and minute ventilation. With pressure control, ventilation changes in lung compliance or  $R_{aw}$  will result in changes in  $V_T$ , which can ultimately affect  $P_aCO_2$ .

2. Pressure control ventilation should be used when the goal is to avoid high pressures.

# **Chapter 6: Initial Ventilator Settings Case Study 6.1**

**Minute Ventilation (\dot{V}\_E) Needs.** The ordered  $\dot{V}_E$  is 500 mL  $\times$  12, or 6000 mL/min, or 6 L/min. The estimated  $\dot{V}_E$  based on BSA (and metabolism) is 7 L/min. You might use VC-CMV with a set  $V_T$  of 500 mL and a minimum rate of 12 breaths/min. Assuming that the patient is not apneic and can also initiate spontaneous breaths, she could trigger additional breaths if needed to achieve a minute ventilation for the estimated metabolic needs.

#### Case Study 6.2

**Minute Ventilation** ( $\dot{V}_E$ ), **Tidal Volume** ( $V_T$ ), and **Respiratory Rate.** He has a BSA of 2.15 m<sup>2</sup>. His IBW at 6 lb, or 72 inches, is 106+6=178 lb (81 kg). If a  $V_T$  of 7 mL/kg is used, the  $V_T$  is about 570 mL.  $V_E$  is  $4\times 2.15=8.6$  L/min, and the rate is (8.6 L/min)/(0.570 mL), or about 15 breaths/min.

#### Case Study 6.3

Inspiratory/Expiratory Ratio (I/E) and Flow. Her IBW is 145 lb (66 kg). (Use Fig. 6.1 and determine her BSA. Using actual weight and height BSA = 1.98 m<sup>2</sup>.) Her  $\dot{V}_E = BSA \times 3.5$  for a female. (Initial  $V_E = 1.98 \times 3.5 = 6.93$  L/min.) An initial  $V_T$  setting of 6 mL/kg IBW would be a reasonable starting point (V<sub>T</sub> = 6 mL/kg  $\times$  66 kg = 396 mL or approximately 400 mL). An initial rate would be:  $f = \dot{V}_E/V_T$ ,  $f = (6.93 \text{ L/min})/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{ mL} = (6930 \text{ mL}/V_T)/400 \text{$ min)/400 mL = 17.3 breaths/min. Setting the rate at 17 breaths/ min would be appropriate. A constant flow of 30 L/min or 0.5 L/s is set. Her  $T_I = V_T / flow$  (L/s),  $T_I = 400 \text{ mL} / (0.5 \text{ L/s})$ ,  $T_I = 400 \text{ mL} / (0.5 \text{ L/s})$ (500 mL/s),  $T_I = 0.8$  second), her  $T_E = TCT - T_I$ ; TCT = 60 s/(17 breaths/min) = 3.5 seconds;  $(T_E = 3.5 \text{ s} - 0.8 \text{ s}; T_E = 2.7 \text{ second}),$ and her I/E ratio would be 1:3.4 ( $T_I = 0.8$  second;  $T_E = 2.7$  second;  $I/E = [T_I/T_I]/[T_E/T_I] = [0.8 \text{ s}/0.8 \text{ s}]/[2.7 \text{ s}/0.8 \text{ s}])$ . This ratio would allow ample time for exhalation. In fact, the flow rate might be reduced if high peak pressures were present. (See the following section on inspiratory flow and flow patterns for more information on flow rates and peak pressures.)

#### Case Study 6.4

Tidal Volume (V<sub>T</sub>) During Pressure Control Continuous Mandatory Ventilation (PC-CMV). Assuming all other factors remain constant, the initial patient compliance (C) is 350 mL/12 cm  $H_2O=29.1$  mL/cm  $H_2O$ . To achieve a  $V_T$  of 550 mL, remember that  $C=\Delta V/\Delta P$ , and  $\Delta P=\Delta V/C$ ; 550 mL/(29.1 mL/cm  $H_2O$ ) equals a required pressure of 18.9 cm  $H_2O$ .

#### Case Study 6.5

# Inspiratory Flow Termination in Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV)

*Problem 1:* The breath will end when flow drops to 12.5 L/min (i.e., 25% of peak flow).

Problem 2: The ventilator will continue to deliver flow until the maximum  $T_{\rm I}$  limit is reached (usually 2–3 seconds, depending on the ventilator model).

Problem 3: The pressure—time graphic will show a sudden rise in the pressure at the end of the breath that is 2 to 3 cm  $H_2O$  higher than the preset pressure level. This rise in pressure will be detected by the ventilator and will pressure cycle the breath.

#### Case Study 6.6

**Pressure-Regulated Volume Control (PRVC).** Because less pressure is required to deliver the same volume, the patient's lung characteristics may be improving. This would mean a drop in  $R_{aw}$  or an increase in  $C_S$ . The therapist may want to assess the patient to confirm this finding.

# **Chapter 7: Final Considerations in Ventilator Setup**

**Auto-PEEP and Triggering.** The patient must generate -8 cm  $H_2O$  to bring  $P_{alv}$  to 0, plus -1 cm  $H_2O$  to trigger the ventilator. Total effort is -9 cm  $H_2O$ .

#### Case Study 7.2

#### **Key Questions for ARDS Patient**

- The initial indications for ventilation in this patient are increased WOB, impending respiratory failure, refractory hypoxemia, and inability to tolerate mask CPAP.
- 2. In terms of precipitating factors, he sustained a fracture of the left femur, which may cause fat emboli, and chest injuries that resulted in a pneumothorax. Bilateral fluffy infiltrates are present on a chest radiograph, and he has refractory hypoxemia (low  $PaO_2$  on a high  $F_1O_2$ ).
- 3. He is 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighs 258 lb.  $BSA = 2.42 \text{ m}^2$ ; initial  $V_E = (4 \times BSA) = 9.68$  L/min. Because this patient has experienced trauma, his metabolic rate may be elevated, which must be kept in mind when he is ventilated. IBW = 106 + 6 = 190 lb (86.4 kg); using values of 4 to 8 mL/kg, a V<sub>T</sub> range of 345 to 690 mL is appropriate. The initial V<sub>T</sub> of 690 mL (8 mL/kg) can be used to establish an initial f and will allow for further evaluation of the V<sub>T</sub> setting when  $P_{plat}$  and auto-PEEP can be measured.  $f = \dot{V}_E/V_T =$ 9.68/0.690 = 14 breaths/min. Flow should be set at 100 L/min to keep T<sub>I</sub> short, and a descending ramp waveform should be used. VC-IMV + PSV or VC-CMV modes are equally acceptable. Pressure-controlled ventilation can be used instead of volume-controlled ventilation. It would be helpful to start with VC-CMV to establish the pressure needed to achieve the desired volume in pressure ventilation. PC-IMV + PSV and PC-CMV are equally acceptable. An initial PEEP of  $\geq$ 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and an F<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub> of 1 should be set.

#### Case Study 7.3

**Troubleshooting: The Pulse Oximeter.** Patients with CHF often demonstrate peripheral vasoconstriction, thus limiting blood flow to their extremities. The pulse oximeter cannot register a value unless it detects a pulse (see Chapter 10). The respiratory therapist could try warming the patient's hand or using another site, such as the other hand or a toe. Testing the function of the pulse oximeter to see whether it is working properly is also a good idea.

# **Chapter 8: Initial Patient Assessment Case Study 8.1**

**The Importance of Documentation.** The legal inference is that if treatment is not documented, it is not done. The therapist must prove that care was provided despite a lack of documentation. He argued that he did not want to repeat the same information over and over and that he had "charted by exception." Fearing that a jury might not believe the therapist, the hospital settled the case out of court.

#### Case Study 8.2

**Circuit Disconnect.** The low-pressure alarm did not activate for several reasons. First, it may have been set too low and was not sensitive enough to the drop in pressure. Second, the bedding may have been occluding the Y-connector, thus keeping the pressure in the circuit above the low-pressure alarm level. The low-pressure alarm and the low  $V_T$  alarm must be set appropriately to avoid these types of situations. With a low volume returning to the exhalation side of the ventilator, the drop in  $V_T$  would have been detected and the low  $V_T$  alarm would have been activated. This would have alerted the respiratory therapist to a problem before the patient's monitor indicated tachycardia.

#### Case Study 8.3

**Cuff Inflation Techniques.** The MLT was used to set the cuff pressure so that a small leak existed at 13:00. This can be noted by the difference of 20 mL between the set volume (520 mL) and the measure exhaled volume (500 mL). Several hours later (the set volume is the same), the patient's condition improves such that less pressure is required to deliver the same volume. With a lower ventilating pressure, a leak no longer exists around the cuff. Note that the cuff pressure (20 mm Hg) is equal to about 27 cm  $H_2O$ . This is enough cuff pressure to prevent a leak when the ventilating pressure is only 23 cm  $H_2O$ . The MLT could be repeated if maintaining a leak is desirable for this patient.

#### Case Study 8.4

#### **Patient Assessment Cases**

Problem 1: Findings suggest that the patient has a respiratory infection. A chest radiograph and laboratory studies, including a white blood cell count, might confirm this diagnosis. The low-pitched rattles heard on auscultation (rhonchi) indicate secretions in the large airways. The patient may need to be suctioned. Also, a culture and sensitivity test of a sputum sample may be in order. Antibiotics may be indicated.

Problem 2: Pneumothorax on the left side.

Problem 3: Right mainstem intubation.

### Case Study 8.5

#### Evaluating C<sub>S</sub> and R<sub>aw</sub> During Mechanical Ventilation

Problem 1: The increase in PIP and P<sub>TA</sub> while P<sub>plat</sub> remains constant indicates a change in R<sub>aw</sub>. Listen to the breath sounds and try to determine the cause of the change (e.g., secretions, kink in the ET tube, bronchospasm).

Problem 2: The decrease in  $V_T$  indicates a change in lung characteristics. Listen to the breath sounds and try to determine whether  $R_{aw}$  may have increased (i.e., presence of low-pitched rattling breath sounds [rhonchi] or wheezing) or whether the tube has become progressively occluded or is obstructed in some way. Crackles or changes in the percussion note may indicate a change in lung parenchyma that might reduce compliance (e.g., the development of pneumonia) or a completely obstructed airway that is causing the distal portion of the lung to collapse. Try to determine the cause of the change and correct it. Increase the set pressure to maintain ventilation if necessary.

# **Chapter 9: Ventilator Graphics** *Case Study 9.1*

The two different breath types can be easily distinguishable by analyzing the pressure and flow scalars (see Fig. 9.11).

# Case Study 9.2

Note that the expiratory flow now reaches the zero (see arrow) before the onset of the next breath, indicating that the change reduced the level of auto-PEEP.

# **Chapter 10: Assessment of Respiratory Function** *Case Study 10.1*

**Causes of Cyanosis.** The patient had an adverse reaction to the benzocaine and developed methemoglobinemia, which could be verified by performing CO-oximetry. CO-oximetry would allow you to directly measure methemoglobin levels in the patient's blood. The treatment of acute methemoglobinemia is intravenous administration of methylene blue.

## Case Study 10.2

**Capnography During Intubation.** Capnography is often used to assess the ET placement. In this case the ET was placed in the esophagus, thus preventing the detection of any exhaled CO<sub>2</sub>. Listening to breath sounds and reviewing the patient's chest radiographs can confirm this finding.

# Case Study 10.3

**Dead Space Ventilation.** The application of +10 cm  $H_2O$  of PEEP may have caused a reduction in pulmonary perfusion resulting in an increase in dead space ventilation, which is evidenced by the shifting of the SBCO<sub>2</sub> curve to the right and the reduction in PCO<sub>2</sub>. The reduction in  $S_pO_2$  is consistent with an altered  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  ratio, which would be associated with compression of the pulmonary capillaries by an excessive amount of PEEP<sub>E</sub> being administered.

# **Chapter 11: Hemodynamic Monitoring** *Case Study 11.1*

#### **Evaluation of Pressure Tracing**

- 1. The catheter is located in a pulmonary artery.
- 2. Systolic and diastolic pressures are approximately 40/25 mm Hg. These values are measured during exhalation.

#### Case Study 11.2

#### **Cardiac Index and Stroke Index**

C.I. =  $\dot{Q}/BSA = (3 \text{ L/min})/(1.7 \text{ m}^2) = 1.76 \text{ L/min/m}^2$ 

S.I. = SV/BSA; SV =  $\dot{Q}$ /HR = 3 L/min/110 beats/min = 0.027 L/beat or 27 mL/beat. S.I. = SV/BSA = 27 mL/beat/1.76 m<sup>2</sup> = 15.34 mL/beat/m<sup>2</sup>. Cardiac index and stroke index are both lower than normal.

#### Case Study 11.3

**Application of the Fick Principle.** At 13:00  $\dot{Q}=(350/[20-14]\times 10)=4.7$  L/min. At 15:00  $\dot{Q}$  is  $(350/[20-12]\times 10)=4.4$  L/min. The decrease in CVO<sub>2</sub> is associated with a decrease in cardiac output.

#### Case Study 11.4

#### Stroke Work

Left ventricular stroke work (LSW) = MAP  $\times$  SV  $\times$  0.00136. And LSWI = LSW/BSA.

Before the medication LSW =  $80 \times 60 \times 0.00136 = 6.53$  kg-m. LSWI = 6.53 kg-m/1.5 m<sup>2</sup> = 4.35 kg-m/m<sup>2</sup>.

After the medication LSW =  $100 \times 70 \times 0.00136 = 9.52$  kg-m. LSWI = 9.52 kg-m/1.5 m<sup>2</sup> = 6.35 kg-m/m<sup>2</sup>.

#### Case Study 11.5

Hemodynamic Monitoring: After Open-Heart Surgery. Calculate  $C(a-V)O_2$  for before and after treatment: (ignore the dissolved portion).

Before:  $C_aO_2=0.90\times 13\times 1.34=15.7$  vol%;  $CVO_2=0.75\times 13\times 1.34=13.1$  vol%;  $C(a-V)O_2=2.6$  vol%. Calculate cardiac output before:  $\dot{Q}=\left(V\times 100=(250/2.6)\times 100=9620\ \text{mL/min}\right)$  or 9.62 L/min.

After:  $C_aO_2=0.98\times 13\times 1.34=17.1$  vol%;  $Cv_2=0.65\times 13\times 1.34=11.3$  vol%;  $C(a-V)O_2=5.8$  vol%.

Calculate cardiac output after:  $\dot{Q}=(V\times 100=(230/5.8)\times 100=3956$  mL/min or 3.96 L/min.

Cardiac output has dropped, and the  $\mathrm{C}(\mathrm{a}-V)\mathrm{O}_2$  has increased as a result.

#### Case Study 11.6

Hemodynamic Monitoring: Chest Injury. It was determined that the pulmonary artery was torn during surgery and the patient's liver had been injured by a retractor. The low hemoglobin is one indication of internal bleeding. The patient's hemodynamic status appears to be good. The only value that was significantly out of the normal range was the pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), which was probably elevated because of the medications the patient was receiving.

#### Case Study 11.7

**ICU and Hemodynamic Assessment.** This case describes a patient with a pulmonary embolism, which is suggested by the refractory hypoxemia present. The fact that the PAP pressures are elevated with a normal PAOP is representative of a pulmonary condition as opposed to left heart failure. The CVP is within normal limits, indicating that the condition is acute because the right side of the heart has not yet been affected by the elevated pulmonary artery pressures.

# Chapter 12: Methods to Improve Ventilation in Patient—Ventilator Management Case Study 12.1

**Hyperventilation.** The flow—time scalar shows that flow does not return to zero during exhalation before another mandatory breath occurs. Auto-PEEP (air trapping) is present. It is important to check ventilating pressures and keep  $P_{plat}$  below 30 cm  $H_2O$  to

prevent lung injury. The physician should be notified that, in an effort to normalize the pH, the high  $\dot{V}_{\rm E}$  is causing auto-PEEP.

#### Case Study 12.2

**Assessment During Suctioning.** A sudden tachycardia is a possible complication of suctioning. The respiratory therapist should immediately stop the procedure, provide  $O_2$  (100%), and ensure that the patient is receiving adequate ventilation, preferably using the ventilator to do so.

#### Case Study 12.3

**Evaluation of Bronchodilator Therapy.** Yes, the PIP decreased, the  $P_{TA}$  decreased by nearly 50%, and the PEFR increased by more than 50%.

# Case Study 12.4

**Evaluating Fluid Status.** The most likely problem is low fluid volume. Fluid replacement is recommended.

# Chapter 13: Improving Oxygenation and Management of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome

#### Case Study 13.1

**Myasthenia Gravis.** The patient has respiratory acidosis. The  $P_aO_2$  indicates moderate hypoxemia. A common reaction by clinicians in this situation is to increase the  $F_1O_2$ . However, the cause of the hypoxemia is the elevated  $CO_2$ . An increase in  $P_aCO_2$  of 1 mm Hg will reduce the  $P_aO_2$  by 1.25 mm Hg. The  $P_aCO_2$  is about 40 mm Hg above normal; therefore the  $P_aO_2$  will be about 50 mm Hg below its actual value. The most appropriate way to increase the  $P_aO_2$  is to increase ventilation.

#### Case Study 13.2

#### Changing F<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub>

Desired  $F_1O_2 = (60 \times 0.75)/40 = 1.13$ 

No, this is not possible. You cannot give more than 100%  $O_2$ . Along with increasing the  $F_1O_2$  to 1, another method of improving oxygenation is to use PEEP.

#### Case Study 13.3

**Problem Solving: Infant CPAP.** This is a common problem encountered when using CPAP in the treatment of infants. The flow from the CPAP device is leaking out of the infant's mouth because the infant is crying. The CPAP levels cannot be maintained. Once the infant stops crying, the problem will correct itself.

#### Case Study 13.4

**Selecting Optimum PEEP.**  $P_aO_2$  progressively increases as expected with an increase in PEEP and FRC. PVO<sub>2</sub> is low initially (about 50% saturation, assuming that pH is close to normal), progressively improves to 38 mm Hg, and then declines. At the same setting (20 cm  $H_2O$  PEEP), BP falls. PVO<sub>2</sub> declines because of a drop in cardiac output (assuming that  $\dot{V}O_2$  is constant). The optimum PEEP level for the patient at this time is 15 cm  $H_2O$ . The next step is to reduce the  $F_1O_2$ .

#### Case Study 13.5

**Changing Patient Position.** The most likely cause is a  $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$  mismatch caused by rotation of the affected lung in the dependent position. With unilateral lung disease, it is best to position the

good lung down, in the dependent position. Another possible problem is thromboembolism; repositioning of patients sometimes causes clots to move. A third possible problem is a compromised airway; the airway would need to be checked for proper function.

# **Chapter 14: Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia** *Case Study 14.1*

**Patient Case—VAP.** His CPIS is 7 and his condition does warrant initiation of a broad-range antibiotic.

#### Case Study 14.2

**Patient Case—Methicillin-Resistant** *S. aureus.* An appropriate antibiotic regimen would include linezolid (600 mg every 12 hours) or vancomycin.

# Chapter 15: Sedatives, Analgesics, and Paralytics

### Case Study 15.1

**Patient Case—Discontinuing Lorazepam.** Long-term use (longer than just a few months) of lorazepam can lead to physical dependence. The most common side effects that can occur when this patient suddenly stops taking his medication include nausea, vomiting, agitation, and insomnia. Other possible side effects include tremors, muscle cramping and spasms, and seizures.

#### Case Study 15.2

**Patient Case—Agitated Patient.** Fentanyl, which is a synthetic opioid, would be an effective choice for treating this patient. Fentanyl possesses analgesic and sedative properties. Morphine would not normally be used with this type of patient because of her unstable hemodynamic status.

#### Case Study 15.3

**Patient Case—Asynchrony.** Asynchrony cannot be corrected through ventilator adjustment; therefore it is appropriate to use a sedative and, if necessary, a paralyzing agent to reduce patient-ventilator asynchrony.

#### Case Study 15.4

Patient Case—Neuromuscular Blocking Agent. The NMBA that would be appropriate for this patient would be a depolarizing agent such as succinylcholine. It is indicated in patients who are hemodynamically stable. It can cause increases in intracranial pressure and should not be used in patients with cerebral edema and head trauma. Succinylcholine has been widely used for cases of emergency intubation because of its relatively low cost, rapid onset of action, and short duration of action.

# Chapter 16: Extrapulmonary Effects of Mechanical Ventilation Case Study 16.1

The Effects of Ventilator Changes on Blood Pressure. The increases in  $V_T$  and respiratory rate have resulted in a substantial increase in the mean airway pressure, which in turn has caused the patient's BP to drop. With this large a  $V_T$  and this high an RR, auto-PEEP may also be contributing to the rising peak and mean airway pressures. The RT should determine whether the  $V_T$  setting is appropriate for this patient (maximum approximately 8 mL/kg IBW). The RT also might recommend the use of VC-IMV or PC-

IMV, rather than VC-CMV, and reduce the mandatory rate. PSV might be added to support spontaneous breaths.

## Chapter 17: Effects of Positive Pressure Ventilation on the Pulmonary System Case Study 17.1

**Peak Pressure Alarm Activating.** Physical findings indicate the presence of a right-sided pneumothorax. A physician should be contacted immediately for an order for a chest radiograph and to begin treatment. The respiratory therapist should stay with the patient and make sure the pneumothorax does not become a tension pneumothorax. Appropriate emergency equipment (e.g., an emergency resuscitation cart) should be kept close at hand. Depending on the circumstances, the respiratory therapist may need to provide manual ventilation for the patient until treatment can be administered.

### Case Study 17.2

**Patient Case—Acute Pancreatitis.** The crackles in the basilar and posterior areas may indicate atelectasis and the opening and closing of alveoli in dependent areas. An increase in PEEP is indicated, and a recruitment maneuver might also be considered (see Chapter 13).

### Case Study 17.3

**Appropriate Ventilator Changes.** The ABG values after 7 days of PPV are normal. However, this patient's baseline ABG values suggest chronic  $CO_2$  retention. The patient has been hyperventilated with the ventilator, and the kidneys have reduced the bicarbonate level to normal. When the mandatory rate is reduced for weaning, the patient's  $P_aCO_2$  rises, stimulating spontaneous ventilation. Unfortunately, the patient cannot maintain a normal  $P_aCO_2$  and pH, as suggested by the high spontaneous rate. To correct the problem, the patient's mandatory rate must be reduced gradually until normal baseline ABG values are restored (i.e., pH = 7.38,  $P_aCO_2$  = 51 mm Hg,  $P_aO_2$  = 58 mm Hg,  $HCO_3$ — = 29 mEq/L). Appropriate PSV for spontaneous breaths should also be provided.

#### Case Study 17.4

**Difficulty Triggering in a Patient With COPD.** The new  $\dot{V}_{\rm E}$  is 11.7 L/min. The increase in  $\dot{V}_{\rm E}$  resulted in auto-PEEP, which caused the rise in PIP and the transient drop in exhaled  $V_{\rm T}$  that occurred after the change. Also, the patient is unable to trigger the ventilator, another possible indication of air trapping.

# **Chapter 18: Troubleshooting and Problem Solving**

#### Case Study 18.1

**Patient.** The patency of the airway can be used to rule out upper airway obstruction; auscultation of the patient's breath sounds can be used to rule out any sudden change in the patient's lung condition, such as the presence of secretions or the occurrence of a pneumothorax. The sudden O<sub>2</sub> desaturation that occurs simultaneously with a drop in end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> suggests the possibility of a pulmonary embolus. This cannot be confirmed easily and requires further radiographic evaluation.

In this case a pulmonary embolism was later confirmed. Aside from attempts to increase oxygenation, little can be done for this problem through ventilator management and immediate medical intervention is required.

### Case Study 18.2

Evaluating Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP) and Plateau Pressure (Pplat) in Volume-Controlled (VC) Ventilation. On the basis of pressure findings,  $C_L$  is progressively decreasing. PIP and  $P_{\text{plat}}$  are increasing while the difference between them ( $P_{\text{TA}}$ ) remains relatively constant, which suggests that  $R_{\text{aw}}$  has not changed. ARDS is a possible diagnosis based on the physical findings, chest radiograph, and patient's history.

#### Case Study 18.3

#### Evaluating PIP and Volume in Pressure Control Ventilation.

This patient, with a history of asthma, may be experiencing increased bronchial constriction and increased secretions. The drop in volume may be associated with increased  $R_{\rm aw}$ . The flow—volume loop indicates increased  $R_{\rm aw}$ , and the wheezing supports this finding. Activation of the alarms resulted from two different causes. The high-pressure alarm was activated by the patient's coughing and forceful exhalations; the low-volume alarm was activated by the reduction in volume delivery associated with increased  $R_{\rm aw}$  during pressure ventilation. The patient most likely needs bronchodilator therapy and possibly intravenous corticosteroids and suctioning.

#### Case Study 18.4

**Problem Solving Using Ventilator Graphics.** The flow—time and volume—time curves in Fig. 18.7 show a greater inspired volume than exhaled volume, which indicates a leak in the system.

#### Case Study 18.5

**Evaluating a Ventilator Problem.** In this situation the exhalation valve was malfunctioning. A gas leak apparently occurred through the valve, causing the baseline pressure to begin dropping. The ventilator increased gas flow delivery to try to compensate for the drop in PEEP. This moved air through the exhalation valve, which was measured by the flow transducer, resulting in an upward swing of the volume curve at the end of exhalation. The problem was corrected when the expiratory valve was changed. Perhaps you can think of another possible cause of this situation.

# Chapter 19: Basic Concepts of Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation Case Study 19.1

Patient Selection for NIV. Oxygenation and respiratory status appear to be acceptable, but close assessment reveals several risk factors that may compromise the patient's safety. The patient's ability to cough and swallow has deteriorated, reflecting her inability to protect the airway adequately. This places her at a very high risk for aspiration. The patient also has become more agitated and confused in the past hour, which could indicate worsening hypercarbia. The correct action at this time would be to intubate the patient and initiate invasive ventilation. Delaying this process would cause further clinical deterioration and increase morbidity and mortality.

#### Case Study 19.2

Monitoring and Adjusting NIV. The symptoms of dyspnea, agitation, and increased respiratory rate reveal inadequate clinical improvement from NIV. Two things need to be considered at this time. Currently, the patient's average exhaled V<sub>T</sub> is only 3 to 4 mL/kg of the patient's body weight; this contributes to his rapid respiratory rate and may promote auto-PEEP. The practitioner should attempt to increase the patient's exhaled V<sub>T</sub> to 6 to 8 mL/kg by increasing IPAP. The use of a full-face mask may increase the potential for CO<sub>2</sub> rebreathing, especially if EPAP levels are not set adequately. Increasing EPAP levels will increase the flow of gas to the mask during exhalation and reduce the potential for rebreathing of CO2. Increasing EPAP also may reduce WOB. However, if EPAP is increased without increasing IPAP, the gradient between IPAP and EPAP (or the pressure support level) will decrease, resulting in a lower delivered V<sub>T</sub>. Therefore if EPAP is increased, IPAP also must be increased to ensure adequate pressure support for greater V<sub>T</sub> delivery to the patient. (NOTE: If auto-PEEP is present, elevating EPAP may also make it easier for the patient to trigger a breath [see Chapter 6].)

#### Case Study 19.3

Common Complications of NIV. Improvement in gas exchange and other symptoms related to chronic hypoventilation may take several weeks to occur for those who use NIV only intermittently. Patients who can tolerate NIV for at least 4 to 6 hours in each 24hour period are most likely to show improvement in symptoms. This patient's lack of compliance and intolerance of NIV is most likely responsible for his poor physiological improvement. Nasal dryness and congestion are common complications of NIV, and every effort should be made to minimize its occurrence. A roomtemperature humidifier attached to the CPAP machine adds moisture and often is helpful for patients with nasal drying or congestion. Cold, dry air coming directly from the CPAP mask may increase nasal resistance by means of increased nasal congestion. Heated humidification is more expensive but may be attempted in particularly difficult cases. Nasal irritation and congestion may be treated with nasal sprays containing steroids, ipratropium, or antihistamines. Patients with persistent difficulties may benefit from referral to an ear, nose, and throat specialist.

Treatment with decongestants, inhaled (nasal) steroids, or cromolyn sodium; humidification; and in some cases nasal surgery can control nasal symptoms in most patients. However, a few will continue to find nasal CPAP uncomfortable because of high nasal resistance.

# Chapter 20: Weaning and Discontinuation From Mechanical Ventilation

#### Case Study 20.1

**Evaluation of Weaning Attempt.** The patient's spontaneous rate has risen progressively as the spontaneous  $V_T$  has decreased. Without any further information, these two findings strongly suggest that the patient's WOB has dramatically increased as the mandatory IMV rate has decreased. To assist the patient, return the IMV rate to a higher level (e.g., 4 breaths/min or more) and add PSV to support the patient's spontaneous breathing efforts. The use of low levels of PEEP/CPAP (3–5 cm  $H_2O$ ) is also appropriate. Furthermore, evening is approaching. The patient probably needs to rest for the night, which means a return to full ventilatory support.

#### Case Study 20.2

#### Calculation of Rapid Shallow Breathing Index (RSBI)

Patient 1: The index is 10/0.4, or 25, which indicates readiness to wean from mechanical ventilation.

Patient 2: The index is 30/0.25, or 120; therefore weaning is not recommended.

#### Case Study 20.3

**Failed Weaning Attempt.** One possible cause relates to cardiac function. On the basis of the patient's history of a myocardial infarction, he may be experiencing increased left ventricular preload and a shift in blood volume to the central veins, which may lead to cardiogenic pulmonary edema, as demonstrated by the rise in wedge pressure, despite the lack of dysrhythmias. One solution to this problem might be the administration of diuretics in an effort to reduce the fluid volume and treat the cardiac problem.

# **Chapter 21: Long-Term Ventilation** *Case Study 21.1*

Patient Case—Difficulty Weaning. It would be appropriate to assess the patient further to determine why he is having difficulty weaning from the ventilator and whether he meets the criteria for discharge. It may be related to his chronic condition (ALS) or his previous MIs left him unable to support ventilation. In either case, he may require slower weaning attempts. If his condition is medically stable and meets the criteria for discharge, transfer to an intermediate or long-term care facility probably would be the best course.

### Case Study 21.2

**Patient Case—Communication Difficulty.** The respiratory therapist might consider a speaking valve. This might help the patient phonate without requiring a change of the tracheostomy tube. Careful evaluation of the patient's ability to use the valve would be required to ensure that the apparatus is beneficial considering the level of ventilatory support.

# **Chapter 22: Neonatal and Pediatric Mechanical Ventilation**

#### Case Study 22.1

Assessment and Treatment of a Newborn. Clinical assessment of this patient should include prompt measurement of vital signs and  $S_pO_2$ . Clinical signs call for nasal CPAP or surfactant administration. The patient should be attached to an electrocardiograph—respiratory rate monitor, and a chest radiograph should be taken immediately. The typical approach for a patient this size is to first start with nasal CPAP, and if the infant shows ongoing signs of respiratory distress and increasing oxygenation, then a blood gas should be obtained. Additionally, he may benefit from a dose of surfactant with immediate extubation to CPAP. ABG analysis should be considered. On the basis of the history and clinical presentation, respiratory distress syndrome is the most likely diagnosis and should be ruled out first.

#### Case Study 22.2

**Adjustments to Home Therapy.** The RT primarily faces the challenge of helping clear and manage this patient's secretions. The patient may have developed pneumonia. However, the chest radiograph showed extensive atelectasis in the right middle and lower lobes. Atelectasis was also seen on the left at the lingular area. Many patients with neuromuscular disorders can be

ventilated quite effectively with noninvasive devices. However, secretions, which can obstruct and cause plugging of the airways, persistently affect some patients.

The RT immediately recruited the parents to help develop a home care plan that would provide cough assist and chest physical therapy. On the RT's recommendation, the patient was admitted to the hospital's intermediate care unit. The clinical staff, along with the parents, introduced the patient to the cough-assist device, which had never been used with this patient. The parents were taught to perform chest physical therapy. Although some nasotracheal suctioning was necessary on the first day of admission, this was soon replaced with frequent use of the cough-assist device, followed by suctioning of the hypopharynx with a Yankauer suction tube. The RT also evaluated the patient on a BiPAP ventilator and determined that both IPAP and EPAP should be increased.

### Case Study 22.3

**Patient Case**—**Acute Status Asthmaticus.** Despite the helium/oxygen mixture,  $R_{aw}$  for this patient is probably quite high. The RT should evaluate pressure and flow scalar waveforms. It may be that with the  $T_{\rm I}$  of 0.9 second, the set inspiratory pressure cannot be reached before the time limit. Flow, which normally tapers to zero in pressure control breaths, may be terminated prematurely. Some clinicians call this situation *flow chop*. The RT should recommend an increase in the  $T_{\rm I}$  and adjustment of the inspiratory time, which would probably achieve a higher  $V_{\rm T}$ . Also, the RT should monitor the patient's flow during the expiratory phase of each breath. It might be necessary to reduce the ventilator rate, providing additional expiratory time to allow expiratory flow to return to baseline.

#### Case Study 22.4

Recommending Changes in Ventilator Settings. Although many patients treated for pneumonia respond well to the pressure control/CMV, some develop areas of atelectasis. This may be a result of secretions and airway plugging, or it may be associated with a progressive loss of pulmonary compliance secondary to the acute pneumonitis. An early sign of progressive lung collapse is tachypnea with deteriorating V<sub>T</sub> on this mode of ventilation. Although the patient's  $\dot{V}_{\rm E}$  has not dropped, oxygenation has been affected. Some might consider keeping the patient on this mode and increasing the inspiratory pressure and PEEP settings. Because the clinical condition is worsening, the patient should be switched from a pressure control mode to a volume control mode. The change to a volume control mode of ventilation will restore lung volumes, particularly FRC and V<sub>T</sub>. It is becoming increasingly more common to use volume control or dual-control modes of ventilation in patients to prevent lung collapse that may not be able to be maintained during pressure control.

#### Case Study 22.5

**Evaluation of PRVC Dual-Control Mode.** In this example the patient is not tolerating PRVC because of a leaky ET. In some cases, dual-control modes should not be advocated with leaky ETs. In this particular case, the ventilator servo-controls or adjusts pressure based on a measured inspiratory  $V_T$ . However, because there is a large leak present, the ventilator is initially sensing a  $V_T$  that is greater than the preset volume, improved compliance,

and the ventilator weans the inspiratory pressure. A larger ET leak during PRVC can result in erroneous weaning of the inspiratory pressure, placing the patient at greater risk for hypoventilation and lung collapse. Conversely, dual-control modes that regulate pressure based on exhaled  $V_{\rm T}$  may overexpand lung units. Patients who have large ET leaks may be better supported using pressure control modes that will hold a constant pressure in the lungs without the risk for inappropriate weaning of the inspiratory pressure.

#### Case Study 22.6

**Interpretation and Response to Monitored Data.** The physician and RCP should continue to monitor the  $\dot{V}CO_2$ . With an increase in PEEP, additional lung units probably have been recruited, leading to an increase in  $CO_2$  elimination at the airway. In this situation the  $\dot{V}CO_2$  usually rises to a plateau and then drops slightly. If an inappropriate amount of PEEP had been added, the  $\dot{V}CO_2$  most likely would have decreased because of an increase in dead space.

#### Case Study 22.7

Patient Case—Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Managed With HFO. The RT should suggest lowering the mean airway pressure setting. Significant recruitment of lung units may have taken place over the short time the patient has been on the oscillator. The mean airway pressure may be so high at this point that overdistention could be contributing to dead space ventilation. In this situation, reducing the mean airway pressure for a short time is often a good idea to see whether oxygenation improves.

#### Case Study 22.8

Determining Appropriateness of Nitric Oxide Therapy. RTs often are called upon to administer nitric oxide to patients whose condition is refractory to O2 therapy. It is essential that the underlying cause of the hypoxemia be identified before iNO is given. In some cases, administration of iNO could worsen the patient's condition. Almost all infants and children who are candidates for iNO should undergo echocardiography (ECHO). In this infant's case, the RT asked whether ECHO had been done to confirm a diagnosis of PPHN. ECHO was ordered, and a critical coarctation of the aorta was identified. It was also determined that the aortic arch was moderately hypoplastic. Although the infant's condition was serious, he was relatively hemodynamically stable because of right-to-left shunting, presumably through the PDA and patent foramen ovale. If nitric oxide had been given, pulmonary vasodilation would have occurred, reducing the shunting of blood from the pulmonary to the systemic circulation. The result most likely would have been profound systemic hypotension.

**Patient Assessment During HFOV.** The most likely cause is a pneumothorax. Given the tracheal shift, it may be a tension pneumothorax.

#### Case Study 23.2

**Calculating Gas Flows During Heliox Therapy.** The correction factor for 70:30 is 1.6. At a flow of 10 L/min, the actual flow will be  $1.6 \times 10$ , or 16 L/min.

# PART 3: CRITICAL CARE CONCEPTS ANSWER KEY

# Chapter 1: Basic Terms and Concepts of Mechanical Ventilation

#### **Critical Care Concept 1.1**

**Calculate Pressure.** Remember that if  $C = \Delta V/\Delta P$ , then  $\Delta P$  is  $\Delta V/C$ . With a volume of 0.5 L and a compliance of 0.1 L/cm  $H_2O$ , pressure = 5 L/0.1 cm  $H_2O$ , or 5 cm  $H_2O$ . A  $P_{alv}$  change of 5 cm  $H_2O$  would be required to achieve a 0.5 L  $V_T$  in a person with normal  $C_L$ .

# **Chapter 2: How Ventilators Work** *Critical Care Concept 2.1*

**Open Loop or Closed Loop.** This is a closed-loop system. The ventilator is providing a specific  $F_1O_2$  and monitors  $S_pO_2$ . The ventilator can detect changes in  $S_pO_2$  and change the  $F_1O_2$  setting. Whether this is a good idea is a matter of opinion. It can be argued that this would provide a safeguard for patients who suddenly become hypoxemic. It could also be argued that  $O_2$  saturation monitors are not reliable enough and could give erroneous readings, resulting in an inappropriate ventilator response.

#### Critical Care Concept 5.1

#### Volume-Controlled Breaths With Changing Lung Characteristics

- 1. About 1 second and it does not change among A, B, or C.
- 2. This is a constant flow waveform, also called a *rectangular* or *square* waveform.
- 3. The  $V_T$  is about 500 mL.
- 4. PIP at A is about 14 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, at B it is about 25 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, and at C it is about 12 cm H<sub>2</sub>O.
- 5. Lung compliance decreases with pneumonia, ARDS, pulmonary fibrosis, or pulmonary scarring, such as can occur with lung cancer. Compliance also decreases with pneumothorax and pleural effusions. Changes in the abdominal wall, such as occur with ascites, can elevate the diaphragm and reduce compliance. Placing a patient in the prone position reduces thoracic compliance. Burns and surgical incisions in the chest wall reduce thoracic compliance.
- If compliance remains the same but airway resistance increases, more pressure will be required to deliver gas flow. PIP will increase.

#### Critical Care Concept 5.2

#### Pressure-Controlled Breaths With Changing Lung Characteristics

- 1. The pressure curve is constant.
- 2. The waveform during inspiration is basically a descending (decelerating) ramp. It might also be called an *exponential* descending flow waveform.

- 3. The flow—time curve in *A* drops to zero just at the end of inspiration. The flow curve in *C* drops to zero before the end of inspiration.
- 4. The volume curve in *C* has a short plateau at the top that begins when flow drops to zero during inspiration and ends when exhalation starts. It is flat because the volume is not changing. Because the flow is zero during this time interval, no more volume is going into the lungs.
- 5. The volume delivery at *B* is higher than at *A* because the lungs in *B* are more compliant than the lungs in *A*.

# **Chapter 6: Initial Ventilator Settings** *Critical Care Concept 6.1*

**Tidal Volume (V<sub>T</sub>) and Ideal Body Weight (IBW).** The lowest V<sub>T</sub> would be 390 mL (6 mL/kg  $\times$  65 kg = 390 mL) and the highest V<sub>T</sub> would be 520 mL (8 mL/kg  $\times$  65 kg = 520 mL). A woman of the same height (5 ft, 6 in) would have an IBW of 61 kg. The female's lowest V<sub>T</sub> would be 366 mL (6 mL/kg  $\times$  61 kg = 366 mL), and the highest V<sub>T</sub> would be 488 mL (8 mL/kg  $\times$  61 kg = 488 mL).

### **Critical Care Concept 6.2**

**Inspiratory Flow in a Time-Cycled Ventilator.** TCT = 5 seconds (60 s/12 breaths = 5 seconds for each breath); I/E ratio = 1:4;  $T_I = 5 \text{ s/5} = 1 \text{ second}$ ;  $T_E = 4 \text{ seconds}$ . Inspiration must be delivered in 1 second. Flow = Volume/Time = 0.5 L/1 s. Convert time to a minute; flow =  $(0.5 \text{ L})/\text{s} = (0.5 \text{ L} \times 60 \text{ s})/(1 \text{ s} \times 1 \text{ min}) = 30 \text{ L/min}$ .

# **Chapter 7: Final Considerations in Ventilator Setup**

### **Critical Care Concept 7.1**

The absolute humidity of a gas that is 100% saturated at normal body temperature is 44 mg/L. The humidifier provides 37 mg/L and the patient needs 44 mg/L. The humidity deficit is 7mg/L. The relative humidity (RH) deficit decreases; RH = (Absolute/Maximum capacity)  $\times$  100 = (37 mg/L)/(44 mg/L) = 85.3%.

The higher  $P_{\text{TM}}$  value during spontaneous breathing increased the LV afterload compared with PPV.
