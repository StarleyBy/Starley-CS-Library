#### **LEARNING OBJECTIVES**

On completion of this chapter, the reader will be able to do the following:

- 1. Select an appropriate mechanical ventilator, breath type, and mode of ventilation on the basis of clinical findings derived from patient assessment data.
- 2. Describe how continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV) can be used in the management of patients with various cardiopulmonary disorders.
- 3. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of volume-controlled and pressure-controlled ventilation.
- 4. Explain the differences in function among continuous mandatory ventilation, spontaneous ventilation, and intermittent mandatory ventilation.
- 5. Describe the functions of the trigger, cycle, and limit variables as they are used in volume-controlled continuous mandatory ventilation, pressure-controlled continuous mandatory ventilation, volume-controlled intermittent mandatory ventilation, pressurecontrolled intermittent mandatory ventilation, and pressure support ventilation.
- 6. Define each of the following terms: pressure augmentation, pressure-regulated volume control, volume support, mandatory minute ventilation, airway pressure release ventilation, bilevel positive airway pressure, and proportional assist ventilation.

nce the need for mechanical ventilation has been established, the clinician must select the type of ventilator, ventilator mode, and breath type for the patient. This chapter focuses on factors that affect the choice of ventilator,

patient interface (i.e., artificial airway or mask), control variable (volume or pressure), breath type, and ventilator mode.

Selecting the appropriate ventilator and mode of ventilation can be challenging even for an experienced clinician. The following questions provide a framework for making the selection process manageable:

- Why does the patient need ventilatory support? (Indication)
- Does the ventilatory problem require a special mechanical
- ventilation mode? (Pathology)What therapeutic goals can be achieved by using a specific ventilator? (Treatment goals)
- Does the patient need to be intubated, or can noninvasive ventilation be used? (Patient interface)
- Will the ventilatory support be provided in the intensive care unit, the patient's home, or an extended care facility? (Location)
- Will ventilatory support be required for a brief period or long term? (Duration)
- How familiar are the staff with the ventilator (or ventilators) under consideration? (Staff training)

If a change is to be made from one type of ventilator to another, the respiratory therapist must know whether the change is being made because a different mode or feature is needed. For example, a patient may have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and may need a ventilator that can provide an advanced modality.

If a patient is to be discharged from the hospital to his or her home or an extended care facility, a ventilator that would be appropriate in that setting should be selected. For example, a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis may be familiar and comfortable with noninvasive ventilation. A patient with postpolio syndrome may be more familiar with a chest cuirass or tank ventilator (negative pressure ventilator [NPV]). (Although NPV is not discussed here, it is important to mention that it is sometimes used in the homecare or alternative-care setting. In rare cases, NPV has been used for ventilation of acutely ill infants. See Chapter 21 for additional information on NPV.)

This chapter focuses on positive pressure ventilation. Positive pressure ventilators can function in various types of settings and provide a variety of modes, features, monitors, and alarms.

# NONINVASIVE AND INVASIVE POSITIVE PRESSURE VENTILATION: SELECTING THE PATIENT INTERFACE

A patient can be connected to a positive pressure ventilator using either a positive pressure mask or an artificial airway. Face and nasal masks are used to administer NIV. Artificial airways, which include translaryngeal airways (oral or nasal endotracheal tubes [ETs]) and tracheostomy tubes, are required for invasive ventilation. Historically, about 75% of patients receiving invasive positive pressure ventilation are intubated (95% with an oral ET and 5% with a nasal ET). Tracheostomy tubes are used in the remaining 25% of patients receiving invasive positive pressure ventilation.<sup>3</sup>

#### **Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation**

There are two methods of providing noninvasive positive pressure ventilator support:

- Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
- Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV)

As previously mentioned, CPAP and NIV are most commonly administered via a face or nasal mask. Ensuring that the mask fits properly will minimize patient discomfort and help prevent air leaks. Mask interfaces are discussed in more detail in Chapter 19.

#### **Continuous Positive Airway Pressure**

As previously described, CPAP involves administering a continuous level of pressure throughout the respiratory cycle. In hospitalized patients, CPAP has been shown to be an effective method to improve oxygenation. It also is an accepted method used to treat obstructive sleep apnea, especially in the home. In addition, CPAP can be used to assist patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who have difficulty breathing. The use of CPAP in COPD patients has received some attention because air trapping can occur in a spontaneously breathing individual with increased airway resistance (R<sub>aw</sub>). Air trapping in patients with COPD or in patients with acute asthma can lead to an increase in the functional residual capacity (FRC). In the past, CPAP was considered contraindicated in patients with COPD because these patients already had an increased FRC. The concern among some clinicians was based on the assumption that external CPAP, or positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP), would further increase the FRC and not benefit the patient.

Patients with COPD often have difficulty generating the pressure difference between the alveoli and the mouth to begin inspiratory gas flow. The air trapped in the lungs (called *intrinsic PEEP* or *auto-PEEP*) creates a positive alveolar pressure ( $P_{alv}$ ). If the pressure in the lungs is positive at end exhalation, the pressure must drop below the pressure at the mouth (atmospheric pressure) to start gas flowing into the lungs for inspiration. For example, if auto-PEEP is greater than +5 cm  $H_2O$ , the patient must exert an effort of at least -5 cm  $H_2O$  to drop the lung pressure below zero. Once alveolar pressure drops below zero, inspiratory gas flow can start.

Externally applied CPAP may reduce the pressure difference between the mouth and alveoli when flow limitation (increased R<sub>aw</sub>) is the cause of auto-PEEP. The patient therefore does not have to work as hard to drop the Paly so that inspiratory gas flow enters the lungs. In other words, externally applied CPAP can reduce inspiratory work.4 Mask CPAP set at 80% to 90% of the measured auto-PEEP (usually about cm H<sub>2</sub>O) reduces diaphragmatic work and dyspnea, improves gas exchange, and does not worsen hyperinflation.<sup>5-7</sup> As discussed in Chapter 4 and later in this chapter, many clinicians often prefer using noninvasive positive pressure ventilator support in the form of bilevel positive airway pressure (bilevel PAP) rather than CPAP for patients with Raw-induced auto-PEEP. Bilevel PAP is a method often used to treat acute-on-chronic respiratory failure. An example of an acuteon-chronic respiratory condition is a patient with chronic bronchitis who develops pneumonia (an acute condition).

#### Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation

Numerous investigators have examined the use of NIV for patients with respiratory failure caused by various neuromuscular disorders, chest wall deformities, COPD, central ventilatory control abnormalities, and acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (Box 5.1). Their findings suggest that NIV can reduce the need for intubation in 60% to 75% of these patients. Two types of ventilators can be used to provide NIV:

- Pressure-triggered, pressure-limited, flow-cycled devices designed specifically for mask ventilation, for example, BiPAP (Philips Respironics, Murrysville, PA)<sup>9</sup>
- Critical care ventilators that have a variety of available modes, including NIV in many cases

Box 5.2 lists some of the advantages and disadvantages of NIV compared with invasive ventilation. <sup>4,11,13</sup> Box 4.7 lists accepted indications and contraindications for NIV. If patients are not

#### Advantages and Disadvantages of Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation in Acute Respiratory Failure

#### **Advantages**

- · Avoids complications associated with artificial airways
- Provides flexibility in initiating and removing mechanical ventilation
- · Reduces requirements for heavy sedation
- Preserves airway defense, speech, and swallowing mechanisms
- · Reduces need for invasive monitoring

#### **Disadvantages**

excluded by the presence of contraindications, NIV offers the clinician an excellent option for a number of acute and chronic conditions requiring mechanical ventilation.<sup>14</sup>

#### **Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation**

As mentioned previously, a high percentage of patients who need mechanical ventilation require invasive positive pressure ventilation via an artificial airway. Once the appropriate ventilator has been chosen, the clinician must select a mode of ventilation that is most advantageous for the patient's condition.

#### **FULL AND PARTIAL VENTILATORY SUPPORT**

The terms full ventilatory support and partial ventilatory support describe the extent of mechanical ventilation provided. With

full ventilatory support the ventilator provides all the energy necessary to maintain effective alveolar ventilation. <sup>15</sup> Full ventilatory support results in arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide ( $P_aCO_2$ ) values less than 45 mm Hg or a  $P_aCO_2$  that is normal for the patient (i.e., eucapnic breathing). Full ventilatory support is provided when ventilator rates are high (8 breaths/min or more) and tidal volume ( $V_T$ ) is adequate for the patient. (See Chapter 6 for information on  $V_T$  settings and ideal body weight. <sup>16</sup> Full ventilatory support is typically provided using a ventilator mode that provides a preset volume or pressure when a breath is delivered. The mode must be set so that the patient receives adequate alveolar ventilation regardless of whether the person can breathe spontaneously. <sup>15</sup> For example, full ventilatory support might include fully controlled and assisted positive pressure ventilation.

Partial ventilatory support is any degree of mechanical ventilation in which set machine rates are lower than 6 breaths/min and the patient participates in the work of breathing (WOB) to help maintain effective alveolar ventilation. A variety of ventilator modes can be used for partial ventilatory support; however, by definition the patient must actively participate in ventilation to maintain adequate levels of  $P_aCO_2$ . Partial ventilatory support modes might include intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV), pressure support ventilation (PSV), volume support ventilation (VSV), proportional assist ventilation (PAV), and mandatory minute volume (MMV). These modes are described later in this chapter.

Strategies for partial ventilatory support are appropriate when attempts are made to discontinue ventilator support. Partial ventilatory support should be avoided in patients with ventilatory muscle fatigue and when a patient has a high WOB level.

When treating patients with acute respiratory failure, the initial goal of mechanical ventilation is to supply all the necessary ventilation (i.e., full ventilatory support) while the ventilatory muscles are given time to rest. <sup>17,18</sup> Ideally, after several hours to several days of full ventilatory support, the patient's condition stabilizes and the patient begins to recover. Maintaining complete rest after just a few days on full ventilatory support can result in muscle wasting or atrophy; for this reason, some clinicians object to full ventilatory support and provide partial support from the beginning. This is a matter of clinician preference and patient history. Whether full ventilatory support is used or not, the patient assumes part of the WOB within a short time, once other factors have been stabilized, to prevent muscle wasting.

# BREATH DELIVERY AND MODES OF VENTILATION

The breath type (i.e., source of energy used to deliver the breath) and pattern of breath delivery during mechanical ventilation constitute the mode of ventilation. The mode is determined by the following factors:

- Type of breath (mandatory, spontaneous, assisted)
- Targeted control variable (volume or pressure)
- Timing of breath delivery (continuous mandatory ventilation [CMV], IMV, or continuous spontaneous ventilation [CSV])

# **Type of Breath Delivery** *Mandatory Breaths*

As described in Chapter 3, mandatory breaths are breaths for which the ventilator controls the timing, V<sub>T</sub>, or inspiratory

![](_page_3_Picture_3.jpeg)

#### Case Study 5.1

#### What Type of Breath Is It?

- A patient receives a breath that is patient triggered, volume targeted, and time cycled. What type of breath is it?
- 2. A patient breathes spontaneously at a baseline pressure of +8 cm  $H_2O$ . The pressure stays at +8 cm  $H_2O$  during inspiration and exhalation. What type of breath is it?

pressure. For example, a patient-triggered, volume-targeted, volume-cycled breath is a mandatory breath. The ventilator controls  $V_{\rm T}$  delivery.

#### **Spontaneous Breaths**

For spontaneous breaths, the patient controls the timing and  $V_{\rm T}$ . The volume or pressure (or both) delivered is not set by the clinician but rather based on patient demand and patient lung characteristics.

#### Assisted Breaths

Assisted breaths have characteristics of both mandatory and spontaneous breaths. In an assisted breath, all or part of the breath is generated by the ventilator, which does part of the WOB for the patient. If the airway pressure rises above baseline during inspiration, the breath is assisted.<sup>19</sup> For example, during the pressure support mode the clinician sets the target pressure but the patient initiates the breath (patient triggered). The ventilator delivers the set pressure above baseline pressure to assist the patient's breathing effort. The patient cycles the breath (Case Study 5.1).

#### **Targeting Volume as the Control Variable**

By choosing either volume or pressure ventilation, the clinician determines the control variable that will be used to establish gas flow to the patient. Control variables are independent variables; in volume-controlled ventilation, for example, the volume selected is constant and independent of what happens to pressure when the patient's lung characteristics (lung compliance and  $R_{\rm aw}$ ) change or when the patient's effort changes. The selection of using volume-controlled or pressure-controlled ventilation is based on whether consistency of  $V_{\rm T}$  delivery is important or limiting of pressure delivery is important.

The primary advantage of volume-controlled ventilation is that it guarantees a specific volume delivery and volume of expired gas ( $V_E$ ), regardless of changes in lung compliance and resistance or patient effort.<sup>21</sup> The goal of volume-controlled ventilation is to maintain a certain level of  $P_aCO_2$ .

The main disadvantage of volume-controlled ventilation becomes evident when the lung condition worsens. This can cause the peak and alveolar pressures to rise, leading to alveolar over-distention (see Critical Care Concept 5.1 and Fig. 5.1\*). Box 5.3 summarizes how changes in lung compliance and airway resistance can affect peak and plateau pressures during volume-controlled ventilation. It is worth noting, however, that these changes are reversible. When the lung condition improves, less

#### ( CRITICAL CARE CONCEPT 5.1

### Volume-Controlled Breaths With Changing Lung Characteristics

Use Fig. 5.1 to answer the following questions:

- 1. What is the approximate inspiratory time? Does it change?
- 2. What type of flow scalar is shown in this figure?
- 3. What is the approximate tidal volume delivery for each breath?
- 4. What are the peak inspiratory pressures (PIPs) in A, B, and C?
- 5. What types of lung or thoracic abnormalities can result in reduced compliance?
- 6. What would happen to the PIP if compliance remained unchanged but airway resistance increased?

pressure is required to deliver the volume and ventilating pressures

Other disadvantages of volume-controlled breaths are related to flow and sensitivity settings. Specifically, the delivery of flow is fixed on some ventilators and may not match patient demand. Similarly, if the sensitivity level is not set appropriately for the patient, it can make it more difficult for the patient to trigger inspiration. Both situations can lead to patient-ventilator asynchrony and patient discomfort. The operational controls available for volume ventilation vary depending on the ventilator manufacturers. Operational controls typically include  $V_T$ , respiratory rate, inspiratory flow, and a flow pattern. With some ventilators, the practitioner can set the  $V_T$ , respiratory rate, and inspiratory time; however, the flow pattern is not adjustable. (Chapter 6 reviews guidelines for setting the appropriate volume and rate in volume ventilation.)

#### **Targeting Pressure as the Control Variable**

Pressure-controlled ventilation allows the clinician to set pressure as the independent variable; that is, the pressure remains constant, but volume delivery (the dependent variable) changes as lung characteristics change. Volume delivery therefore must be closely monitored (Critical Care Concept 5.2 and Fig. 5.2).

Pressure-controlled ventilation has several advantages. First, it allows the clinician to set a maximum pressure, which reduces the risk for overdistention of the lungs by limiting the amount of positive pressure applied to the lung. Second, the ventilator delivers a decelerating flow pattern during pressure-controlled ventilation (Fig. 5.3). It has been suggested that limiting the peak pressure spares more normal areas of the lungs from overinflation. Pressure-controlled ventilation is therefore considered a component of protective strategies for the lung. If It may also be more comfortable for patients who can breathe spontaneously. When the patient makes an inspiratory effort, the negative pressure produced at the upper airway causes the ventilator to vary gas flow to match the patient's need. This can reduce WOB, particularly in patients with ARDS, compared with volume-controlled ventilation. Include the following:

- Volume delivery varies as the patient's lung characteristics (i.e., lung compliance and airway resistance) change.
- V<sub>T</sub> and V<sub>E</sub> decrease when lung characteristics deteriorate (Box 5.4)

<sup>\*</sup>Figs. 5.1 and 5.2 introduce ventilator graphics so that the reader can become familiar with this tool. Ventilator graphics are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 9.

# BOX 5.3 Factors That Affect Pressures During Volume-Controlled Ventilation

#### **Patient Lung Characteristics**

- Reductions in lung or chest wall compliance produce higher peak and plateau pressures; increased compliance produces lower peak and plateau pressures.
- Increased airway resistance produces a higher peak pressure; reductions in airways resistance produce lower peak pressures.

#### **Inspiratory Flow Pattern**

- Peak pressure is higher with a constant flow and lower with a decelerating flow pattern. Decelerating flow pattern has a higher mean airway pressure; constant flow generates the lowest mean airway pressure.
- High inspiratory gas flow creates a higher peak pressure.

#### **Volume Setting**

 High volumes produce higher peak and plateau pressures; low volumes produce lower peak and plateau pressures.

#### **Positive End-Expiratory Pressure**

• Increasing PEEP increases the peak and mean pressures.

#### **Auto-PEEP**

Increases in auto-PEEP increase the peak inspiratory pressure.

### CRITICAL CARE CONCEPT 5.2

### Pressure-Controlled Breaths With Changing Lung Characteristics

Use Fig. 5.2 to answer the following questions:

- 1. What type of pressure curve is delivered in A, B, and C?
- 2. What type of flow waveform is present during inspiration in A, B, and C?
- 3. Compare the flow-time curve during inspiration in C with that in A. What is the difference between the two?
- 4. Look at the dotted line in C that starts at the flow waveform just when flow drops to zero during inspiration. Look at the volume-time curve C. What do you notice about this volume-time curve compared with those in A and B? Why is it flat at the top?
- 5. Why is volume delivery higher in B than A?

Clinical studies comparing pressure-controlled ventilation with volume-controlled ventilation are divided over which method is superior. Pressure-controlled ventilation and volume-controlled ventilation are equally beneficial in patients who are not spontaneously breathing when a targeted flow pattern is used.<sup>21</sup> On the other hand, it has been suggested that for spontaneously breathing patients, pressure-controlled ventilation may lower the WOB and improve patient comfort to a greater extent than volume-controlled ventilation, thereby reducing the need for sedatives and neuromuscular blocking agents.<sup>21</sup> Clinician preference and institutional protocol are also important criteria that can influence the selection of pressure-controlled versus volume-controlled ventilation (Case Study 5.2).

Fig. 5.2 Graphs for pressure-targeted ventilation (constant pressure) with normal compliance (A), increased compliance (B), and decreased compliance (C). (See text for more information.)

#### **Timing of Breath Delivery**

Three types of breath delivery timing or sequence are available on current intensive care unit (ICU) ventilators:

- 1. Continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV)
- 2. Intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV)
- 3. Continuous spontaneous ventilation (CSV)

With CMV, either time-triggered or patient-triggered breaths are mandatory breaths; the patient is not generating any spontaneous breaths. During IMV, the patient receives a set number of mandatory breaths each minute but is also allowed to breathe spontaneous breaths between mandatory breaths. Thus the patient breathes spontaneously, and the ventilator intermittently delivers a mandatory breath. In CSV, all breaths are spontaneous and therefore patient triggered. These spontaneous breaths may be assisted (e.g., PSV) or unassisted (e.g., CPAP). Note that PSV may also refer to pressure-controlled CSV (PC-CSV).<sup>20</sup>

#### **MODES OF VENTILATION**

As mentioned previously, the breath type, targeted control variable, and timing of breath delivery determine the mode of ventilation. Modes of ventilation are often identified using abbreviations (e.g., volume-controlled CMV [VC-CMV], PC-IMV, volume support ventilation [VSV], PSV, and MMV). The following sections focus on describing five basic modes of ventilation (VC-CMV, PC-CMV, VC-IMV, PC-IMV, and PC-CSV) and also briefly introduce several spontaneous modes of ventilation used commonly in the ICU: BiPAP, dual-control modes, and other closed-loop modes of ventilation (e.g., MMV, airway pressure release ventilation [APRV], and PAV).

Ventilator manufacturers often use proprietary terms to describe a mode of ventilation that has been developed for their device. This variability in terminology can sometimes be confusing for clinicians unfamiliar with the similarities and differences of modes offered on most current-generation ICU ventilators. Chatburn and colleagues have advocated for an updated system for classifying modes of ventilation used in the clinical setting. Additional details regarding this classification system can be found in the references listed at the end of this chapter. <sup>19,20</sup>

#### History of Intermittent Positive Pressure Breathing and Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation: Understanding the Terminology

Mechanical ventilation historically involved delivering a positive pressure breath intermittently during mechanical ventilation. For this reason, in the past this type of ventilation was called *intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB)* or *intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV)*. IPPV implied continuous mechanical support of breathing in an apneic patient; every breath was mandatory. In current terminology, the abbreviation *CMV* (which stands for continuous mandatory ventilation) is most often used to describe a mode in which every breath is mandatory. A minimum breathing rate is set, but patients can trigger more breaths if they are able. (NOTE: Another commonly used name for CMV is *assist/control [A/C] ventilation*; this term usually means that a set volume or pressure is delivered with every breath.)

In the early development of mechanical ventilation, small, portable IPPV devices were adapted to deliver aerosolized medications with IPPB. Consequently, in modern usage, IPPB implies an IPPB aerosol treatment. If correctly adapted, the same equipment (e.g., Bird Mark 7, CareFusion Corp., San Diego, Calif.) can also be used to provide ventilatory support.

![](_page_6_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 5.3** Pressure-controlled ventilation produces a descending waveform. When the ventilator starts gas flow (inspiration), the pressure at the patient's upper airway builds quickly to the set pressure. This produces a pressure ( $\Delta P$ ) gradient between the upper airway and alveoli (i.e.,  $P_{alv}$  of 0 cm  $H_2O$  or slightly lower). The gradient is highest at the beginning of inspiration (A); as pressure builds inside the alveolus, the gradient slowly decreases, as does flow (B).

#### **Continuous Mandatory Ventilation**

With **continuous mandatory ventilation** (CMV), all breaths are mandatory and can be volume or pressure targeted. Breaths can

be time triggered or patient triggered. When the breaths are time triggered, the breaths are described as controlled

**Key Point 5.1** Historically, clinicians have differentiated between controlled and assisted ventilation by the trigger used to initiate a breath. The control mode is time triggered, and the patient makes no spontaneous effort, whereas during assisted ventilation the breath can be either time triggered or patient triggered.

### BOX **5.4**

## Factors That Affect Volume Delivery During Pressure-Controlled Ventilation

#### **Pressure Setting**

 Higher pressure settings produce larger volumes, whereas lower pressure settings produce lower volumes. In other words, increasing the peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) while maintaining a constant end-expiratory pressure (EEP) increases volume delivery (and vice versa).

#### **Pressure Gradient**

Increasing EEP (PEEP + auto-PEEP) while keeping PIP constant reduces the pressure gradient (PIP - EEP) and lowers volume delivery (and vice versa).

#### **Patient Lung Characteristics**

- Reduced compliance results in lower volume; increased compliance results in increased volume for a given inspiratory pressure.
- Increased airway resistance (R<sub>aw</sub>) results in lower volume delivery if active flow is present; reductions in airway resistance result in higher volume delivery if active flow is present.

#### **Inspiratory Time**

When the inspiratory time (T<sub>I</sub>) is extended, volume delivery increases. Notice that this is true as long as flow is present during inspiration (i.e., the flow—time curve shows flow above zero when inspiration ends). However, if flow returns to zero before inspiration ends, further increases in T<sub>I</sub> can decrease volume delivery if adequate time is not provided for exhalation.

#### **Patient Effort**

 Active inspiration by the patient can increase volume delivery.

![](_page_7_Picture_17.jpeg)

#### Case Study 5.2

#### Pressure-Controlled or Volume-Controlled Ventilation

- 1. A physician wants to ensure that a patient's  $P_aCO_2$  remains at the person's normal level of 50 mm Hg. Would volume-controlled ventilation (VC-CMV) or pressure-controlled ventilation (PC-CMV) best meet this requirement?
- 2. Ventilation pressure can become high in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. To prevent excessive pressures, what independent variable would be most appropriate, volume or pressure?

**ventilation** or the *control mode* (see Fig. 3.16). When the breaths are patient triggered during CMV, the breaths are described as **assisted ventilation** (Key Point 5.1).

#### **Controlled Ventilation**

Controlled (time-triggered) ventilation is appropriate only when a patient cannot make an effort to breathe. Patients who are obtunded because of drugs, cerebral malfunction, spinal cord or phrenic nerve injury, or motor nerve paralysis may be unable to make voluntary efforts; therefore controlled ventilation is appropriate for these patients.

Controlled ventilation may be difficult to use unless the patient is sedated or paralyzed with medications or is deliberately hyperventilated to suppress spontaneous breathing efforts. For example, sedation and paralysis are used if seizure activity or tetanic contractions cannot be prevented. Sedation and sometimes paralysis are recommended during inverse ratio ventilation and with permissive hypercapnia because these conditions are uncomfortable and not well tolerated by conscious patients.

Deliberate (iatrogenic) hyperventilation is used occasionally to temporarily induce respiratory alkalosis and thereby reduce intracranial pressure (ICP) in patients with a closed head injury and severely elevated ICP. Iatrogenic hyperventilation has also been used in Reye syndrome and after neurosurgery when ICP is elevated, but, as mentioned in Chapter 4, its use is controversial. When iatrogenic hyperventilation is used, it is typically employed for short periods until a more effective strategy can be implemented.

Adequate alarms and monitors must be used to safeguard patients. "Locking out" a patient by making the ventilator totally insensitive to patient effort is rarely advisable.<sup>25</sup> It is important to understand that regardless of the mode selected, sensitivity should be set so that the ventilator responds to even minimal patient effort (Key Point 5.2).

**Key Point 5.2** The operator sets the trigger threshold by setting the ventilator's sensitivity. An appropriate sensitivity setting does not require an excessive amount of patient effort to initiate a breath, but it is also not so sensitive that accidental triggering or ventilator self-triggering occurs.

#### **Assisted Ventilation**

Assisted ventilation is a term used by many clinicians to describe a time-triggered or patient-triggered CMV mode in which the operator sets a minimum breathing rate, sensitivity level, and type of breath (volume or pressure). Although the patient can trigger breaths at a faster rate than the set mandatory rate, the set volume or pressure is delivered with each breath.

With CMV, every breath (time triggered or patient triggered) is a machine breath. Patient triggering occurs because the ventilator is sensitive to pressure or flow changes that occur as the patient attempts to take a breath. When the ventilator senses a slightly negative pressure ( $-1~\rm cm~H_2O$ ) or a decrease in flow ( $1-2~\rm L/min$  below the expiratory bias flow), the inspiratory cycle begins (see the section on patient triggering in Chapter 3). The clinician must keep in mind that with CMV, a minimum breathing rate is set on the ventilator to guarantee a minimum  $V_E$ .

![](_page_8_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 5.4** Graphs of volume-controlled continuous mandatory ventilation showing a constant flow waveform. (A) Graphic display indicates that the flow, which is set at 50 L/min, is too low for patient demand. Note the concave appearance of the pressure curve; flow begins at one point, but pressure does not rise with the flow curve until much later. This indicates that the machine is not responding to patient effort. (B) Flow has been increased to 75 L/min. The pressure curve is normal, but sensitivity must also be increased so that the flow and pressure curves begin to rise almost simultaneously. In addition, inspiration time is shortened.

Several problems can arise with patient-triggered modes. These problems involve the ventilator's sensitivity setting and response time. It is worth noting if the machine is overly sensitive to patient effort, the machine triggers rapidly (autotriggering). This can be corrected easily by adjusting the machine's sensitivity so that it responds to a greater patient effort (-1 to -2 cm  $H_2O$ ). Conversely, if an inspiratory effort shows a pressure reading of -3 to -5 cm  $H_2O$  or more below the baseline before an inspiration is initiated, the machine is too insensitive to the patient's effort and WOB increases. <sup>26</sup> In this case the sensitivity level is set too low and must be increased (see Fig. 3.6).

Historically, another common problem with patient-triggered modes is related to response time. Response time is the time increment between when a patient effort is detected and when flow from the ventilator to the patient begins. Manufacturers of ICU ventilators have made significant strides to improve response times in ventilators used in critical care.

Preventing respiratory alkalosis may be difficult to avoid in some patients on CMV unless respiratory depressants, muscle relaxants, or sedatives are used. The  $P_aCO_2$  may reach the apneic threshold (32 mm Hg) in some patients.<sup>27</sup> It is unknown whether this is caused by the mode of ventilation, patient-ventilator asynchrony, or a change in the drive to breathe. Sometimes even switching to IMV on similar settings does not significantly change the arterial blood gas value.<sup>28,29</sup>

# Volume-Controlled Continuous Mandatory Ventilation

VC-CMV is also referred to as volume-targeted continuous mandatory ventilation. Although VC-CMV was once thought to

minimize WOB during mechanical ventilation, studies have shown that patients receiving this mode of ventilation may actually perform 33% to 50% or more of the work of inspiration. This is especially true when inspiration is active and the set gas flow does not match the patient's inspiratory flow demand. Clinically this can be observed by watching the pressure manometer or the pressure-time curve on the graphic display. If the pressure does not rise smoothly and rapidly to peak during inspiration, flow is inadequate. A concave pressure curve indicates active inspiration. Flow must be increased until the patient's demand is met and the curve assumes a slightly convex shape (Fig. 5.4).

# **Pressure-Controlled Continuous Mandatory Ventilation**

PC-CMV is also called *pressure-targeted CMV* or simply *pressure-controlled ventilation* (PCV). With PC-CMV all breaths are time or patient triggered, pressure targeted, and time cycled. The ventilator provides a constant pressure to the patient during inspiration (Fig. 5.5A). The operator sets the length of inspiration, pressure level, and backup rate of ventilation. The  $V_T$  delivered by the ventilator is influenced by the compliance and resistance of the patient's lungs, patient effort, and set pressure.<sup>30</sup> Several studies have shown that the decelerating ramp flow curve associated with PC-CMV (see Fig. 5.2 and Fig. 5.5) may improve gas distribution and allows the patient to vary inspiratory gas flow during spontaneous breathing efforts.<sup>31-33</sup>

The maximum pressure limit during PC-CMV is typically set at approximately +10 cm  $H_2O$  above the target or set pressure because the set pressure level is not the maximum pressure possible on most ventilators. Active coughing can increase circuit

pressure. Reaching the maximum pressure limit usually ends inspiration, as it does in volume ventilation, and prevents excessive system pressures. In some ventilators (e.g., Dräger Evita XL [Dräger Medical Inc., Telford, PA] and the Servo-i (Getinge, Göteborg, Sweden) the expiratory valves float. When excessive pressures build in the circuit (e.g., because of coughing), the valves open to release the excess pressure so that the ventilator does not reach the upper pressure limit, which in turn would end inspiration.

Before 1990, PC-CMV was indicated primarily for patients with ARDS because conventional VC-CMV with PEEP resulted in a high  $P_{alv}$  and failed to improve oxygenation. Subsequent studies have indicated that PC-CMV with PEEP and VC-CMV with PEEP may be equally effective for ventilation in patients

with ARDS.  $^{38,39}$  However, PC-CMV has been shown to reduce the WOB in these patients more effectively than VC-CMV.  $^{24}$  Some institutions use PC-CMV for other types of conditions in which guarding against increasing pressures is more important than guaranteeing a specific  $V_{\rm T*}$ 

Occasionally the inspiration time  $(T_I)$  is set longer than the expiration time  $(T_E)$  during PC-CMV. Although this approach is the opposite of the process that occurs during normal breathing, it has been shown that a longer  $T_I$  provides better oxygenation to some patients by increasing mean airway pressure  $(P_{aw})$ . This mode is referred to as *pressure-controlled inverse ratio ventilation* (PC-IRV) because  $T_I$  is greater than  $T_E$ . Sometimes the goal of PC-IRV is to prevent full exhalation and gas trapping (auto-PEEP) results. PC-IRV is generally used only for patients with stiff lungs

who cannot be successfully administered ventilation with VC-CMV with PEEP or PC-CMV with PEEP. PC-IRV can be guite uncomfortable for the patient and therefore may require sedation or in some cases paralysis.

#### **Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation**

IMV involves periodic volume-targeted or pressure-targeted breaths that occur at set intervals (time triggering). During IMV, the patient can breathe spontaneously between mandatory (i.e., machine) breaths at any desired baseline pressure without receiving a mandatory breath.

The spontaneous baseline pressure between mandatory breaths can be set at ambient (zero gauge) pressures or above ambient pressure if PEEP/CPAP is desired (Fig. 5.6 and Key Point 5.3). During spontaneous breaths, the patient can breathe from either a continuous flow of gas or a demand valve. Most ventilators can also provide pressure support for spontaneous breaths during the spontaneous breathing period. Critical Care Concept 5.3 provides historical background about the evolution of IMV. The IMV mode is used when the goal is to have the patient breathe spontaneously without receiving a mandatory breath with every effort (i.e., partial ventilatory support). The patient assumes part of the WOB by actively breathing and not receiving complete support from the ventilator. It is thought that one of the main advantages of using IMV is that this mode allows for active participation by the patient in breath delivery, thus preserving a certain amount of respiratory muscle strength. In fact, the patient's WOB can actually increase with IMV because of a lack of coordination between mandatory and spontaneous breaths. The patient's efforts might not stop just because a mandatory breath is delivered. Another potential advantage is that there are fewer cardiovascular side effects because parts of V<sub>E</sub> occur at lower pressures. 41

Key Point 5.3 Mandatory breaths are also called machine breaths.

#### CRITICAL CARE CONCEPT 5.3

Successful use of intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) in the 1970s led to the development of a more refined mode of IMV called synchronized IMV (SIMV). SIMV operates in the same way as IMV except that mandatory breaths are normally patient or time triggered rather than solely time triggered. Like IMV, the patient can breathe spontaneously through the ventilator circuit between mandatory breaths. At a predetermined interval (i.e., respiratory rate), which is set by the operator, the ventilator waits for the patient's next inspiratory effort. When the ventilator senses this effort, it assists the patient by synchronously delivering a mandatory breath (see Fig. 5.6). The clinician usually sets the volume target or pressure target, a maximum mandatory breath rate, and the sensitivity level. The ventilator then delivers the set volume or pressure breaths, which are patient or time triggered. After delivering the mandatory breath, the ventilator allows the patient to breathe spontaneously without receiving another machine breath until the next mandatory breath is due to occur

As with IMV, spontaneous breaths that occur during SIMV can be pressure supported. The pressure target for pressure

support breaths is commonly set lower than the peak pressure during a mandatory breath. For example, the mandatory breath may generate a peak pressure of 30 cm  $H_2O$ , and the pressure support spontaneous breath may be set at 15 cm  $H_2O$ . (Pressure support is discussed later in the chapter.)

Originally SIMV was designed to eliminate the problem of breath stacking. Breath stacking occurs with IMV when a machine-timed breath is accidentally delivered at the same time the patient spontaneously inhales. Consequently, the patient's lungs receive huge volumes of air, which can cause high pressure in the lungs and result in barotrauma or ruptured lung tissue. Clinicians can prevent this problem by setting an appropriate peak pressure limit. When large volumes reach the pressure limit, they are vented to the atmosphere or the machine ends inspiration. (NOTE: Although a number of current intensive care unit [ICU] ventilator manufacturers use the term SIMV to designate the synchronous nature of coordinating mandatory breaths with spontaneous breaths, the acronym IMV is used in this text because this technology is now considered a built-in feature in all contemporary ICU ventilators.)

Spontaneous breaths can be supported with PSV if the clinician wants to reduce the WOB for spontaneous breathing. Fig. 5.5C shows the pressure-time curve and flow-time curve for pressure-targeted IMV with pressure support for spontaneous breaths; these curves should be compared with those for volume-targeted IMV and pressure support in Fig. 5.5D,

IMV has been used to wean patients from mechanical ventilation. As the mandatory rate is lowered, the patient gradually assumes a greater part of the WOB. (NOTE: Many clinicians are moving away from this method of weaning from mechanical ventilation and choosing instead to use spontaneous breathing trials as criteria for discontinuation of mechanical ventilation. (See Chapter 20 for a more detailed discussion of discontinuation and weaning from mechanical ventilation.) Table 5.1 presents a comparison of the advantages, risks, and disadvantages of CMV and IMV.

#### **Spontaneous Modes**

Three basic means of providing support for CSV during mechanical ventilation exist, as follows:

- · Spontaneous breathing
- · Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
- Pressure support ventilation (PSV)

#### **Spontaneous Breathing**

With this mode, patients can breathe spontaneously through a ventilator circuit without receiving any mandatory breaths. This is sometimes called a T-piece method because it mimics having the patient's ET connected to a Briggs adapter (T piece) and a humidified oxygen source using large-bore tubing. The advantage of this approach is that the ventilator can be used to monitor the patient's breathing and activate an alarm if an undesirable circumstance arises. The disadvantage is that some ventilator systems require considerable patient effort to open inspiratory valves to receive gas flow, thus increasing WOB. Ventilator

manufacturers have attempted to minimize this problem by incorporating rapidly responsive valves into their designs.

A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) can be used to evaluate a patient's readiness to have ventilation discontinued. During the trial, ventilator support is reduced and the patient is allowed to breathe spontaneously for a brief period (15—30 minutes) while the person's vital signs, pulse oximetry, and physical appearance are monitored. A patient who can tolerate the procedure can typically tolerate longer periods of spontaneous breathing and is probably ready to be weaned from ventilation (see Chapter 20).

#### **Continuous Positive Airway Pressure**

Ventilators can also provide CPAP for spontaneously breathing patients. In this mode of ventilatory support, a continuous level of positive pressure is applied to the patient's airway throughout inspiration and expiration. In the acute care setting, CPAP may be helpful for improving oxygenation in patients with refractory hypoxemia and a low FRC, which can occur with acute lung injury. As with simple spontaneous breathing, the ventilator can provide a means of monitoring the patient. The advantages and disadvantages of ventilator-provided CPAP are similar to those for spontaneous breathing through a ventilator.

#### **Pressure Support Ventilation**

PSV is a special form of assisted ventilation.  $^{44-49}$  The ventilator provides a constant pressure during inspiration once it senses that the patient has made an inspiratory effort (Fig. 5.7). It is important to recognize that the patient must have a consistent, reliable spontaneous respiratory pattern for PSV to be successful. The operator sets the inspiratory pressure, PEEP, flow cycle criteria, and sensitivity level. The patient establishes the rate, inspiratory flow, and  $T_{\rm I}$ .  $V_{\rm T}$  is determined by the pressure gradient ( $\Delta P = {\rm Set}$  pressure  $- {\rm EEP}$ ), lung characteristics (lung compliance [ $C_{\rm L}$ ] and  $R_{\rm aw}$ ), and patient effort. PSV is always an assist mode (patient triggered). The flow curve resembles a descending ramp, and the

Data from Hudson LD, Hurlow RS, Craig KC, et al.: Does intermittent mandatory ventilation correct respiratory alkalosis in patients receiving assisted mechanical ventilation? *Am Rev Respir Dis* 1985;132:1071; Culpepper JA, Rinaldo JE, Rogers RM: Effect of mechanical ventilator mode on tendency towards respiratory alkalosis, *Am Rev Respir Dis* 132:1075, 1985; Kacmarek RM, McMahon K, Staneck K: Pressure support level required to overcome work of breathing imposed by endotracheal tubes at various peak inspiratory flowrates [abstract], *Respir Care* 33:933, 1988.

patient can vary the inspiratory flow on demand (see Fig. 5.7). A pressure support breath is patient triggered, pressure limited, and flow cycled. Remember that with flow cycling, the ventilator senses a decrease in flow and determines that inspiration is ending. The decrease in flow corresponds to a decrease in the pressure gradient between the mouth and lungs as the lungs fill (see Fig. 5.3). Sudden pressure changes can pressure cycle a pressure support breath, as can an excessive inspiratory time (which may occur with a leak in the circuit) (Box 5.5). The pressure-cycle and time-cycle capabilities are safety backup features; the manufacturer sets the exact pressure-cycle and time-cycle criteria (Fig. 5.8).

Additional settings in pressure support ventilation. With PSV, it is important that the ventilator deliver an appropriate flow at the beginning of inspiration. For example, flow delivery that is set too high can cause a pressure overshoot and inspiratory flow may end prematurely (i.e., pressure-cycled breath) (see Fig. 5.8). Conversely, a flow set too low may not meet the patient's need, leading to asynchrony.<sup>49</sup> There may also be a natural reflex that is a flow-related inspiratory termination reflex.<sup>50,51</sup> Stimulation

of this reflex may shorten inspiration and result in brief, shallow inspiratory efforts. This is especially true for low-set pressures in pressure support. The significance of this reflex in clinical practice is not yet known.

Current ICU ventilators allow the operator to adjust the slope of the pressure and flow curves during inspiration (this is sometimes called *sculpturing* or *sloping the breath*). This feature has several names, including *rise time, flow acceleration percent, inspiratory rise time, inspiratory rise time percent,* and *slope adjustment*. The term *rise time* refers to the time required for the ventilator to rise to the set pressure at the beginning of inspiration. The clinician can use the ventilator graphics to help establish an appropriate inspiratory flow delivery (Fig. 5.9). If the patient is responsive, the practitioner can ask the person when flow delivery is most comfortable while adjusting this function.

As mentioned previously, inspiratory flow in PSV ends when the ventilator senses that the flow has dropped to a certain level (flow cycling). Current ventilators (e.g., Medtronics Puritan Bennett 840 [Medtronics Minimally Invasive Therapies, Minneapolis, MN] and the Dräger V500 [Dräger Medical, Inc., Telford, PA])

**Fig. 5.7** Graph of a pressure support breath. The baseline pressure is above zero; therefore positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) has been set. Note the slight negative deflection in the pressure curve before it rises to the set value; this is caused by the patient's inspiratory effort, which triggers the flow from the ventilator. Inspiratory flow is graphed above zero, and expiratory flow is graphed below zero. The flow curve resembles a descending (decelerating) ramp.

have an adjustable flow cycle criterion, which can range from about 5% to about 80% of the measured peak inspiratory flow, depending on the specific ventilator. Manufacturers have given this feature names such as *inspiratory cycle percent, inspiratory flow termination*, and *expiratory flow sensitivity*. Patients with increased airway resistance (e.g., COPD) require a shorter  $T_I$  or higher flow cycle percentage, whereas patients with parenchymal lung disease (e.g., ARDS) require a longer  $T_I$  or lower flow cycle percent. Software is available that allows the ventilator to adjust the flow cycle criterion automatically on a breath-to-breath basis, depending on the lung characteristics and the patient's active expiratory efforts.  $^{54}$ 

#### **BILEVEL POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE**

Bilevel positive airway pressure (bilevel PAP), also called *biphasic* positive airway pressure and bilevel pressure assist, is another form of pressure ventilation often used in NIV. Bilevel intermittent positive airway pressure (bilevel IPAP) or airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) is different from classic bilevel PAP and is generally intended for patients with ARDS.<sup>44</sup>

The original BiPAP (Philips Respironics, Murrysville, PA) was introduced in the early 1990s. Machines that provide bilevel pressure assist generate a high gas flow through a microprocessor-controlled valve. The operator sets two pressure levels: an inspiratory and an expiratory positive airway pressure. Inspiration is typically patient triggered but can also be time triggered. It can be flow or time cycled. A full-face mask is the most popular technique for starting therapy, but a nasal mask or nasal pillows can be used. Leakage from the mouth often occurs with the nasal mask and nasal pillows, although chin straps sometimes help eliminate this

### BOX 5.5 Time-Cycled and Pressure-Cycled Inspiration With Pressure Support Ventilation and Volume Support\*

PSV inspiration ends if the inspiratory time (T<sub>1</sub>) exceeds a preset value. This most often occurs with a leak in the circuit. For example, a deflated cuff causes a large leak. The flow through the circuit might never drop to the flow cycle criterion required by the ventilator. Therefore inspiratory flow, if not stopped, would continue indefinitely. For this reason, all ventilators that provide pressure support also have a maximum preset inspiratory time. Most ventilators use a fixed value, such as 1.5 to 2 seconds for adult patients and 0.5 seconds for infants, for the maximum inspiratory time. Other ventilators use different maximum time-cycle criteria.

PSV and VS breaths also end if the pressure in the circuit exceeds the preset pressure by a specific margin (the margin is preset by the manufacturer). For adult patients the margin is approximately 2 cm  $\rm H_2O$  above the set pressure. For example, if the set pressure is 12 cm  $\rm H_2O$  and the patient forcibly tries to exhale or coughs, the circuit pressure might rise to 14 cm  $\rm H_2O$ . At this point inspiratory flow delivery ends for the pressure support breath.

The size of the patient (i.e., adult, child, infant) influences the specific time and pressure limits used. It is also important to mention that the specific times and pressure limits are different

for every ventilator. The clinician must become familiar with each of these functions for the ventilator used.

PSV is used for the following three basic functions:

- To reduce WOB for spontaneously breathing patients breathing through a ventilator circuit.
- To reduce WOB in patients receiving continuous positive airway pressure or spontaneous intermittent mechanical ventilation. This is accomplished by setting the pressure level higher than that required to overcome system resistance.
- To provide full ventilatory support in the assist mode, in which each patient breath is a PS breath. The patient must have a dependable, intact respiratory center and a fairly stable lung condition because tidal volume can vary when used in this mode. This is sometimes referred to as maximum pressure support (PS<sub>max</sub>).<sup>17</sup>

PSV can be used with an artificial airway or a mask to provide noninvasive ventilation.

The *top curve* is flow (L/min), the *middle curve* is pressure (cm H<sub>2</sub>0), and the *bottom curve* is volume (mL). The *solid line* of the curves represents PSV without premature termination of inspiration. The *dotted vertical line* through all the curves represents the end of inspiratory flow with normal pressure support breath delivery. The *dashed curve* represents premature cycling caused by pressure overshoot (i.e., a spike at the beginning of the pressure curve).

problem. Some machines require a fixed-leak exhalation port and function best with nasal ventilation, which allows exhalation through the mouth. Most devices now compensate for leaks. Newer designs are even being used with artificial airways (see Chapter 19). Box 5.6 provides a list of names used by ventilator manufacturers to describe bilevel PAP for their device.

#### **ADDITIONAL MODES OF VENTILATION**

#### **Pressure Augmentation**

**Pressure augmentation** ( $P_{Aug}$ ) is a dual-control mode that provides pressure-limited ventilation with volume delivery targeted for every breath. Another term that has been used to describe this mode is *volume-assured pressure support (VAPS). VAPS* is the term used to describe  $P_{Aug}$  on the Bird 8400st (CareFusion, Yorba Linda, CA).

With P<sub>Aug</sub> ventilation, the ventilator begins with a patient-triggered, pressure-targeted breath (e.g., a pressure support breath) but targets the volume preset by the operator and delivers that volume with every breath.<sup>55</sup> A key criterion for P<sub>Aug</sub> is the ability to initiate breaths. These patients must also have a consistent respiratory frequency or be able to make consistent attempts

at inspiratory triggering.  $P_{Aug}$  does not work if the patient has been sedated to the point at which the respiratory centers are not active; it is intended for conditions in which the respiratory drive waxes and wanes because of changes in level of alertness or moderate changes in sedation.

When using  $P_{Aug}$ , the operator selects a desired volume and minimum rate, a set pressure level above baseline, an inspiratory gas flow, and a sensitivity setting. When the patient triggers a breath, the ventilator delivers the set pressure level and monitors flow and volume. If volume is achieved before the inspiratory gas flow drops to the preset value, the breath cycles into expiration. Cycling occurs when the measured flow drops to 25% to 30% of the patient's peak inspiratory flow. The threshold value depends on the ventilator's flow cycle criterion. If volume is not achieved before flow drops to the set level, the ventilator maintains the flow at the set value until the volume is delivered (volume cycled). If the patient's inspiratory flow demand is high and pressure starts to fall below the set pressure level in this mode, the ventilator provides additional flow to the patient. In this sense,  $P_{Aug}$  targets a

minimum volume, but the breath is not limited to that volume. Patients can receive more than the set volume if there is a high-flow demand.

#### **Pressure-Regulated Volume Control**

Pressure-regulated volume control (PRVC) is a volume-targeted, pressure-controlled breath that is available on most ventilators (e.g., Servo-i, CareFusion AVEA, Hamilton-G5, Covidien PB 840, Dräger Evita XL). Although PRVC was introduced on the Servo 300 in the 1990s and later has been used to describe this mode on the Servo-i and Servo-s (Getinge, Göteborg, Sweden) and the CareFusion AVEA (CareFusion, Inc., Yorba Linda, CA), it subsequently has been given different proprietary names on other ventilators (e.g., *AutoFlow* on the Dräger Evita Infinity [Dräger Medical Inc., Telford, PA], *VC*+ on the Covidien PB 840 and 980 [Medtronics, Minneapolis, MN], *Adaptive Pressure Ventilation* on the Hamilton G5 and C3 ventilators [Hamilton Medical, Bonaduz, Switzerland]).

Pressure-regulated volume control delivers pressure breaths that are patient-triggered or time-triggered, volume-targeted, and time-cycled breaths. During breath delivery, the ventilator measures the  $V_T$  delivered and compares it with the targeted  $V_T$ , which is set by the operator. If the volume delivered is less than the set  $V_T$ , the ventilator increases pressure delivery progressively over several breaths until the set and the targeted  $V_T$  are about equal (Fig. 5.10). If the measured volume is too high, the pressure is reduced in an attempt to reach the targeted  $V_T$ . Generally, the ventilator does not allow the pressure to rise higher than 5 cm  $H_2O$  below the upper pressure limit setting. For example, if the upper

pressure limit is 35 cm  $\rm H_2O$  and the ventilator requires more than 30 cm  $\rm H_2O$  to deliver a  $\rm V_T$  of 500 mL, an alarm activates and the pressure delivery is limited to 30 cm  $\rm H_2O$ . The clinician must determine why the higher pressure is required to deliver the set volume (e.g., the presence of secretions in the airway, bronchospasms, or changes in  $\rm C_L$ ). The clinician can then choose an appropriate course of action to address the higher pressure required. On the other hand, when a patient's lung condition improves, less pressure is required to achieve the set volume. The ventilator progressively lowers the pressure; however, it does not allow pressure to drop below the set baseline [PEEP].

#### **Volume Support Ventilation**

VSV is similar to PRVC. It is basically pressure support with a volume target and will have various names depending on the ventilator manufacturer. It is a pressure breath that is patient triggered, volume targeted, and flow cycled. There is no backup rate with VSV; however, there is generally a backup mode in the event that the patient becomes apneic on this purely spontaneous mode. As with PRVC, the ventilator adjusts the pressure, over several breaths, to achieve the set volume. If volume is too low, the pressure is increased. Conversely, the pressure is reduced if the volume is too high. VSV can be used for patients who are ready to be weaned from the ventilator and can breathe spontaneously (Fig. 5.11). Unlike PRVC, it is normally flow cycled when the flow drops to a set percentage of peak flow. It can also be time cycled (if T<sub>I</sub> is extended for some reason) or pressure cycled (if the pressure rises too high) (see Box 5.5 and Chapter 6).

The first breath (*left*) is a volume-targeted test breath with an inspiratory hold to measure plateau pressure. The second breath is a pressure-targeted breath with a pressure equal to the measured plateau pressure. Set tidal volume is 400 mL. Measured exhaled tidal volume is about 350 mL. Note how the pressure is increased by a few centimeters of  $H_2O$  on the third breath for the ventilator to achieve the set tidal volume.

#### **Mandatory Minute Ventilation**

MMV, also called *minimum minute ventilation* and *augmented minute ventilation*, has been used primarily for weaning patients from the ventilator. It allows the operator to set a minimum minute ventilation, which is usually 70% to 90% of a patient's current  $V_E$ . The ventilator provides whatever part of the minute ventilation the patient is unable to accomplish by increasing the breathing rate or preset pressure. The ventilator monitors the patient's spontaneous breathing and provides additional ventilatory support if the patient does not achieve the set  $V_E$ . If a patient increases the level of his or her spontaneous ventilation, the ventilator reduces its amount of support.

The clinician typically sets high rate and low  $V_T$  alarms to monitor significant changes in either of these parameters because either suggests an increased WOB. It is also important to monitor these parameters even if the patient can maintain the desired minute ventilation, because patients sometimes begin to breathe rapidly and take shallow breaths. This pattern increases dead space ventilation without effectively increasing alveolar ventilation (Table 5.2). MMV is rarely used in current practice in the United States.

#### **Adaptive Support Ventilation**

Adaptive support ventilation (ASV) was first described by Laubscher and colleagues in 1994 as a variation of mandatory minute ventilation.<sup>56</sup> ASV is a relatively new mode of ventilation that was introduced in the United States in 2006 in their Hamilton Galileo ventilator and subsequently included in the Hamilton C-6 ventilator (Hamilton Medical, Inc., Reno, NV). It has been described as a closed-loop ventilation and oxygenation mode of ventilation.

With ASV, the clinician sets the targeted minute ventilation ( $V_E$  based on the patient's ideal body weight and estimated dead space volume (i.e., 2.2 mL/kg of ideal body weight). The calculated minute ventilation represents the total minute ventilation normally required for the patient. The clinician can adjust the targeted ventilation based on the patient's needs (i.e., <100% of the targeted minute ventilation during weaning or >100% in cases in which ventilatory needs are increased, such as sepsis).

The optimal breathing frequency that the ventilator delivers is determined by delivering a test breath to the patient, which is used to estimate the expiratory time constant for the patient's respiratory system. This expiratory time constant is used along with the estimated

dead space volume and the calculated minute ventilation to calculate the optimal breath frequency delivered by the ventilator. The optimal  $V_T$  then can be calculated by dividing the patient's calculated minute ventilation by the optimal breathing frequency.<sup>56</sup>

It has been suggested that ASV may be beneficial in weaning of critically ill patients from mechanical ventilation because it automatically selects the  $V_T$  and respiratory rate based on changes in the patient's lung mechanics. Additionally, this mode theoretically should require fewer ventilator settings by the respiratory therapist and improved patient-ventilator synchrony.<sup>56</sup>

#### **Airway Pressure Release Ventilation**

APRV, which is similar to bilevel PAP, was described by Stock in 1987 and became commercially available in the mid-1990s.<sup>57</sup> It is currently available in most ICU ventilators. APRV is designed to provide high and low airway pressure levels and allow spontaneous breathing at both levels when spontaneous effort is present.<sup>58-60</sup> Both pressure levels are time triggered and time cycled (Fig. 5.12). The terms Phigh and Plow indicate the levels of pressure administered during APRV, and Thigh and Tlow are used to describe the time spent in high and low airway pressures. It is important to recognize that APRV differs from other forms of bilevel PAP ventilation in that APRV is characterized by longer high positive pressure level periods followed by a shorter low positive pressure level (i.e., near ambient pressure). APRV therefore allows the patient to spontaneously breathe during the high positive pressure level, which may help improve ventilation/perfusion (V). The shorter lower pressure level is designed to facilitate exhalation. Current-generation ICU ventilators also allow for patient triggering and patient cycling. The possible advantage of this modification may be its synchronization with patient breathing, which may reduce the need for sedation and paralysis.

For the initial setup, an optimum high CPAP level is determined much as the optimum PEEP or an ideal  $\overline{P}_{aw}$  is determined for improving oxygenation (see Chapter 13). The  $P_{high}$  level is

**Fig. 5.12** Pressure waveforms for airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) in which alveolar ventilation is enhanced when pressure is released to zero (*upper graph*) and when release pressure is above zero (*lower graph*). Inspiratory/expiratory ratio for APRV is 2:1. *CPAP*, Continuous positive airway pressure. (From Dupuis Y: *Ventilators: theory and clinical application*, ed 2, St. Louis, MO, 1992, Mosby.)

interrupted intermittently to allow pressures to drop briefly (for about 1 second or less) to a  $P_{low}$  level near ambient pressure. Reducing the CPAP reduces the patient's FRC and allows exhalation and ventilation (i.e., exhalation of  $CO_2$ ). Expiratory flow is generally not permitted to return to baseline (zero); therefore auto-PEEP is intentionally present, which helps maintain an open lung and prevents repeated collapse and reexpansion of alveoli. As soon as the release period is complete, the  $P_{high}$  level is restored. The optimum duration of the release time is a function of the time constant of the respiratory system. The pressure curve generated during APRV resembles that of PC-IRV if the patient is not breathing spontaneously.

Although originally intended for patients with stiff lungs, APRV has been shown to be as effective as conventional ventilation for providing ventilation and oxygenation for patients with mild pulmonary problems or with normal lung compliance. 60,63-66 Clinical studies have provided evidence that APRV can enhance alveolar recruitment and improve hemodynamic arterial oxygenation, reduce physiological dead space ventilation, and reduce peak airway pressures.,63-66

#### **Proportional Assist Ventilation**

The PAV approach is a different approach to mechanical ventilation because pressure, flow, and volume delivery are proportional to the patient's spontaneous effort. The amount of pressure the ventilator produces depends on two factors: the amount of inspiratory flow and volume demanded by the patient's effort; and the degree of amplification selected by the clinician (which determines the extent of ventilator response to patient effort). PAV is a positive feedback system.

Basically, the ventilator measures airway flow and pressure and compares patient demand with the gains (amplification) set by the operator. The amount of flow delivered to the patient is determined from this comparison. As the patient's inspiratory effort increases, the flow from the ventilator increases proportionally. This relationship is described by the equation in Box 5.7.

The clinician sets the gain of the volume amplifier to compensate for the abnormal elastance  $(f_1)$  of the patient and adjusts the gain of the flow amplifier to compensate for the abnormal resistance  $(f_2)$  of the patient. The clinician must estimate these values beforehand. Setting the controls and measuring elastance and resistance can be difficult. Indeed, the pressure output from the ventilator can exceed the pressure needed to overcome the respiratory system impedance  $(C_L \text{ and } R_{aw})$  if the baseline measurements are inaccurate.

### BOX 5.7 Determining Proportional Assist

$$\overline{P}_{aw} \, = \, (f_1 \times Volume) + (f_2 \times Flow)$$

where  $\overline{P}_{aw}$  is the airway pressure;  $f_1$  is the ventilator-supported elastic load (degree of volume assist); and  $f_2$  is the ventilator-supported resistive load (degree of flow assist).

Ideally, PAV assists the patient's inspiratory effort on the basis of the patient's lung characteristics and amount of patient effort desired. PAV may prove to be a valuable alternative mode of ventilation. The advantage of PAV is its ability to track changes in patient effort, which can occur rapidly in acute respiratory failure. The disadvantages of PAV are that it provides only for assisted ventilation and cannot compensate for system leaks. Patients experiencing auto-PEEP may also find it more difficult to trigger the ventilator.

#### **Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist**

Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) is a newer mode of ventilation that relies on the patient's neurological control of mechanical ventilation (i.e., triggering, breath delivery, and timing of the mechanical support provided).<sup>70-72</sup> It has been suggested that NAVA accomplishes the same goals as PAV but relies on the measurement of a diaphragmatic electromyelogram signal to control gas delivery.<sup>72</sup> This mode of ventilation is accomplished using a nasogastric tube with specialized sensors that obtain signals from the electrical activity of the diaphragm to control the timing and pressure of the ventilation delivered. In theory, this mode of ventilation is unaffected by circuit leaks, thus avoiding the potential for autocycling and hypocapnia in patients. As discussed in Chapter 22, NAVA has also been shown to provide better comfort and less need for sedation in neonates than PRVC. It is worth mentioning that this modality is invasive, and placement of the nasogastric tube must be evaluated to ensure proper function of this modality. Additional information about the application of NAVA in adult patients can be found in Chapter 23.

### SUMMARY

- · Once the need for mechanical ventilation has been established, the clinician must select the type of ventilator, breath type, and ventilator mode appropriate for the patient.
- Mechanical ventilators can function in a wide variety of settings and provide a variety of modes, features, monitors, and alarms.
- Three methods of providing noninvasive ventilatory support exist: NPV, CPAP, and NIV.
- CPAP has been shown to be an effective method to improve oxygenation in hospitalized patients and as an accepted method to treat obstructive sleep apnea.

- NIV has been successfully used to treat patients with respiratory failure caused by various neuromuscular disorders, chest wall deformities, COPD, central ventilatory control abnormalities, and acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
- Invasive positive pressure ventilation can involve full or partial ventilatory support. During full ventilator support, the ventilator provides all of the energy necessary to maintain effective alveolar ventilation. With partial ventilator support, the patient can assume a variable portion of the WOB.
- The breath type and pattern of breath delivery during mechanical ventilation constitute the mode of ventilation. The mode is determined by whether the breath is mandatory, IMV, or spontaneous; the targeted control variable; and the timing of breath delivery.
- The clinician determines the control variable that will be used to establish gas flow to the patient by choosing either volume or pressure ventilation.
- The primary advantage of volume-controlled ventilation is that it guarantees a specific volume delivery and minute ventilation, regardless of changes in lung compliance and resistance or patient effort
- The main advantage of pressure-controlled ventilation is that it can be used as a lung-protective strategy because it reduces the risk for overdistention of the lungs by limiting the amount of positive pressure applied to the lung.
- The goal of IMV is to allow the patient to breathe spontaneously without receiving a mandatory breath with every effort (partial ventilatory support). The primary advantage of IMV is that this mode allows for active participation by the patient in breath delivery, thus minimizing the effects of respiratory muscle atrophy.
- PSV can be used with patients who have a dependable, intact respiratory center and a stable lung condition. It is used to reduce WOB in patients receiving CPAP or IMV.
- Pressure-regulated volume control, volume support, adaptive support ventilation, airway pressure release ventilation, and PAV provide several alternative methods of ventilation.
- Fig. 5.13 presents an example of a worksheet the reader can use to evaluate the types of ventilators and their settings. The worksheet also incorporates principles discussed in Chapter 4.

#### **REVIEW OUESTIONS** (See Appendix A for answers.) .......................................

- 1. In which of the following situations would you try NIV?
  - A. A patient in whom blood pressure is 65/35 mm Hg, heart rate is 150 beats/min, and respiratory frequency is 34 breaths/min
  - B. A patient who nearly drowned who has copious amounts of white, frothy secretions
  - C. A patient with COPD and right lower lobe pneumonia with respiratory acidosis and increased WOB
  - D. A 5-year-old child who has aspirated a piece of chicken and is having trouble breathing
- 2. Which of the following would you use for a trauma victim with crushed chest injuries?
  - A. Negative pressure ventilation
  - B. Pressure-cycled ventilator
  - C. VC-CMV
  - D. Noninvasive ventilation
- 3. A patient with hiccups is receiving ventilation in the VC-CMV mode. Every time he hiccups, he triggers the ventilator. What would you recommend?
  - A. Paralyze the patient and control ventilation
  - B. Use PSV
  - C. Use PC-CMV
  - D. Use VC-IMV
- 4. A patient with severe tetanus needs ventilatory support. Which of the following modes would you recommend?
  - A. Paralyze and sedate the patient; control ventilation using volume-controlled VC-CMV
  - B. PC-CMV
  - C. VC-IMV
  - D. PSV with CPAP
- 5. In which of these four circumstances is it appropriate to select PSV?
  - 1. As a method of weaning
  - 2. To overcome the WOB through the ET and the circuit
  - 3. For patients using the IMV mode

- 4. For long-term patient support
  - A., and 3
  - B., and 4
  - C., and 4
  - D., and 4
- 6. A patient on PC-CMV has widely fluctuating changes in Raw because of secretions and bronchospasm. The low tidal volume alarm is activated every few hours; the set pressure is 18 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. The physician is concerned about consistency in ventilation. What would you recommend?
  - A. Increase the set pressure
  - B. Sedate the patient
  - C. Switch to VC-CMV
  - D. Switch to PSV
- 7. A patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome has a plateau pressure (P<sub>plat</sub>) of 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and a peak inspiratory pressure of 39 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. V<sub>T</sub> is 0.7 on VC-CMV. The decision is made to switch to PC-CMV (PCV) to keep pressures at a safe level. What pressure would you set and why?
- **8.** A patient receiving VC-CMV is actively triggering every breath. The respiratory therapist notices that the patient is using accessory muscles (sternocleidomastoid muscles) during the entire inspiratory phase. The therapist also sees that the pressure-time curve has a negative deflection before inspiration and a concave appearance during inspiration. What is the apparent problem in this situation?
- **9.** A patient has recovered from severe pneumonia that required 8 days of PC-CMV ventilation. The patient is now conscious and responsive. She is triggering every breath and has a strong cough. What should the therapist suggest to the physician?
- **10.** A physician is concerned about the high pressures required to perform ventilation for a patient with terminal cancer and severe lung scarring. The lungs are stiff and fibrous. The physician is also concerned about maintaining a normal CO<sub>2</sub> value in this patient. What mode might be appropriate for this patient and why?
