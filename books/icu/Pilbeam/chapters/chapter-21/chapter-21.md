ost patients receiving mechanical ventilation require ventilatory support for fewer than 7 days. Approximately 5% of those patients requiring more than 7 days cannot be successfully weaned from ventilatory support and require long-term mechanical ventilation (LTMV). For these patients, weaning is slow paced and may not always result in ventilator discontinuation.

Patients requiring LTMV can be divided into two groups: those recovering from an acute illness and unable to maintain adequate ventilation for prolonged periods, and those with chronic progressive cardiopulmonary disorders. Patients who have an acute, severe illness may not recover sufficiently to be weaned from ventilation while in an acute care facility and are generally transferred to special units on mechanical ventilation within the hospital, long-term care facilities, or their homes. Chronic progressive disorders that require LTMV include ventilatory muscle disorders, alveolar hypoventilation, obstructive lung diseases, restrictive lung diseases, and cardiac diseases (e.g., congenital cardiac diseases).<sup>2</sup>

Mortality rates for patients receiving LTMV are high (2-year mortality rate of 57%; 5-year mortality rate range of 66%—97%).<sup>3-5</sup> Patients who are successfully liberated from the ventilator and decannulated have a greater chance of survival.<sup>4</sup>

The number of ventilator-assisted individuals (VAIs) being discharged to homes or alternative care sites has significantly increased during the past 3 decades<sup>6</sup> (Key Point 21.1). Approximately VAIs were in the United States in 2002, with care requiring an annual cost of almost \$3.2 billion. Most of the costs for the treatment of VAIs are absorbed by acute care hospitals, where reimbursement is typically inadequate. As a consequence of rising costs and falling reimbursements, specialized respiratory care units in acute, intermediate, and chronic care facilities were developed. However, the growth of these specialty units has slowed, again because of limited funding and reimbursement.<sup>4,7</sup>

The following five major factors have added to this upsurge in numbers of VAIs:

 Continued advances in pulmonary medicine and technology have contributed to increased survival rates of critically ill adults and children. Many of these patients can be saved, stabilized, and sent home or to alternative sites for continued ventilator support.<sup>8</sup>

**Key Point 21.1** Long-term ventilator-assisted patients are defined by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) as individuals requiring mechanical ventilation for at least 6 hours per day for 21 days or more.<sup>6</sup>

- 2. An increased emphasis has been placed on earlier discharge of patients from acute care hospitals to reduce the cost of medical care. These patients can be transferred to less costly facilities for continued care.
- 3. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV) such as bilevel mask ventilation is an effective alternative to invasive ventilation, as both an initial mode of treatment and a long-term alternative to managing ventilator-dependent patients.
- 4. Simpler and more versatile equipment is available for home use.
- 5. An increase in medical equipment agencies and the availability of homecare services that provide ventilator care outside the hospital. These latter services allow the patient to benefit from the psychological advantages of being in the family setting or a nonacute care environment.

An excellent example of a VAI who not only survived but lived a quality life is Christopher Reeve, an actor and active sportsman who sustained a high cervical fracture as a result of a horseback riding accident that left him a quadriplegic. With his determination and the support of his wife, family, and caregivers, he was able to have a productive life while being maintained on LTMV for 10 years. During this time, he directed films, became a public speaker, raised awareness of spinal cord injury, and became a strong advocate for stem cell research.<sup>9</sup>

The number of elder Americans is increasing, along with an increase in the number of people with chronic illnesses. Given these trends and the demand for controlling health care costs, it is anticipated that the number of VAIs discharged to home or alternative care sites will continue to increase. LTMV has been shown to be a safe and effective alternative to acute care institutionalization. The home is generally the least expensive environment and the one that provides the greatest level of patient independence and family support. For this reason, a large part of this chapter is devoted to a discussion of home mechanical ventilation.

# GOALS OF LONG-TERM MECHANICAL VENTILATION

The overall goal of LTMV at home or other alternative care sites is to improve the patient's quality of life by providing the following environmental attributes<sup>2,10</sup>:

- 1. Enhancing the individual's living potential
- 2. Improving physical and physiological level of function
- 3. Reducing morbidity
- 4. Lessening hospitalizations
- 5. Extending life
- 6. Providing cost-effective care

Because patients require different levels of care, it is desirable for every patient to progress to his or her point of maximum activity and take an active role in his or her own care. If this is accomplished, his or her psychosocial well-being will also improve.

#### SITES FOR VENTILATOR-DEPENDENT PATIENTS

The terminology used to describe facilities for VAIs is not standardized. Sites can be grouped into three general categories: acute care, intermediate care, and long-term care.

#### **Acute Care Sites**

Acute care sites include the following:

- Intensive care units (ICU), which provide invasive monitoring, extensive care, and a higher ratio of practitioners to patients.
   These units are more expensive and provide the least amount of patient independence and quality of life.
- Specialized respiratory care units, which have fewer resources and are generally designed for more stable VAIs. These are often designated units within a hospital and may be called *pul-monary specialty wards*,<sup>11</sup> respiratory special care units, and chronic assisted ventilator care units.<sup>12</sup>
- General medical-surgical care units, which are typically located on general patient floors of the hospital. Nursing and allied health staff working on these general medical-surgical units often require additional preparation and training to manage these VAIs
- Long-term acute care hospitals, which are specifically designed to care for patients who require extensive monitoring and care, such as daily physician visits, continuous monitoring, intravenous therapy, wound care, and isolation. These patients may still be acutely ill but no longer require the intensive care provided in a critical care unit in the hospital.<sup>12</sup> Long-term ventilator hospitals fall into this category.

VAIs in specialized units located within a hospital typically have the following characteristics:

- · Longer hospital stays
- · Lower hospital mortality rates
- · Higher weaning rates
- · Higher likelihood of being discharged to their homes
- · Longer life expectancy after discharge
- Greater independence in daily activities

Success revolved around the strong leaderships of pulmonologists, who are dedicated to the care of these individuals.<sup>13</sup>

#### **Intermediate Care Sites**

Intermediate care sites usually include subacute care units, longterm care hospitals, and rehabilitation hospitals. Intermediate care sites are not as expensive as acute care sites and provide somewhat more patient independence and quality of life.

Subacute care units may be located in acute care hospitals. They often admit patients who require physiological monitoring, intravenous therapy, or postoperative care.

Long-term care hospitals are designed to provide care for long-term invasive ventilator-dependent patients (i.e., length of stay usually exceeds 25 days). These patients may still require high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) or fraction of inspired oxygen ( $F_{\rm I}O_2$ ). Once they are liberated from the ventilator or switched to a noninvasive method of support, these patients can then be transferred to a congregate living center or home.

Admission to a rehabilitation hospital is based on the patient's specific rehabilitation goals. Current standards include the requirement for nursing rehabilitation care and at least two additional rehabilitation needs, such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, or speech therapy. After a 10-day trial period, patients must be able to participate for 3 hours of therapy per day.

#### **Long-Term Care Sites**

Long-term care sites include skilled nursing facilities, congregate living centers, and single-family homes. These sites do not have the resources to treat acutely ill patients. Long-term care sites are *not* the ideal site for weaning a patient from ventilation. However, they are the least expensive and provide a better quality of life and more independence for the patient.

Skilled nursing facilities include nursing homes, extended care facilities, and convalescent centers. A greater number of VAIs are being admitted in these locations.

Congregate living centers are commonly large private residences, apartments, foster homes, or homes with as many as 6 to 10 patients. These sites are more common in Europe than in the United States.<sup>10</sup>

Homes are typically the preferred environment for caring for ventilator-dependent patients. The quality of life for patients living at home is enhanced, and the home is less costly than most other sites, perhaps with the exception of skilled nursing facilities. The family usually provides most of the support, both financial and medical.

Increasing pressure from managed care and utilization review is resulting in more rapid discharge from ICUs and acute care facilities. Intermediate- and long-term care sites provide newer and less costly approaches to patient care. <sup>14-21</sup> Treatment objectives are generally met at specific facilities. For example, weaning may occur in acute or intermediate care facilities, but it is usually inappropriate in the home. <sup>10</sup>

#### **PATIENT SELECTION**

Patient selection is the key to success for any long-term care ventilation program. Although many factors must be considered in this selection, they can be broadly grouped into three areas:

- 1. Disease process and clinical stability
- 2. Psychological evaluation of patient and family
- 3. Financial considerations

#### **Disease Process and Clinical Stability**

Previous studies have shown that some patients with disorders requiring LTMV may be more successfully managed than others. The following three categories can be used to describe ventilator-dependent patients.

- 1. Patients recovering from acute illnesses and acute respiratory failure who do not respond to repeated attempts at liberation from the ventilator. These patients may need mechanical ventilation for an extended period and will require several weeks to months for recovery but are likely to recover. Some of these patients may sustain several hours of unsupported spontaneous breathing but generally will fatigue when challenged with longer periods of ventilator disconnection.
- Patients with chronic disorders who only require mechanical ventilation for a part of the day, such as at night, but can support spontaneous ventilation on their own for several hours each day.

3. Patients requiring continuous ventilatory support to survive, that is, patients diagnosed as having complete loss of ventilatory function with absent or severely impaired spontaneous breathing efforts. These patients are unable to sustain spontaneous ventilation and depend on life support from the ventilator. Their disorder is inexorably progressive. (Box 21.1 lists the disorders grouped in each category.)

Patients with neuromuscular conditions, skeletal disorders, central hypoventilation syndromes, and stable chronic lung diseases are more likely to have long-term success than patients with disorders causing failure of gas exchange. Disease processes affecting other organ systems besides the pulmonary system are associated with a higher risk for complications. Patients affected with these types of conditions are not suitable for long-term ventilation in most extended care facilities and require a longterm acute care facility. Box 21.2 lists medical conditions appropriate for long-term ventilation.<sup>6,10,25</sup>

Individuals who are considered candidates for LTMV in the home or in extended care facilities must be clinically and physiologically stable to the degree that they are free from any medical complications for at least 2 weeks before discharge. Proof of medical stability must include stable cardiovascular and renal function; no evidence of uncontrolled hemorrhage or coma or, if comatose, prognosis for improvement; acceptable arterial blood gas (ABG) values; freedom from acute respiratory infections and fever; stabile F<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub> requirements; and ventilator settings that do not result in high inspiratory pressures or high levels of PEEP (Case Study 21.1).

Other considerations include the ability to clear secretions (either spontaneously or by suctioning), the ability to tolerate and

#### BOX **21.1**

#### **Patient Groups Requiring Long-Term Mechanical Ventilation**

- 1. Patients recovering from acute illnesses and acute respiratory failure who do not respond to repeated attempts at liberation from the ventilator. This group might include patients who have had a major insult to the respiratory system caused by a severe medical illness, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome or severe pneumonia; patients who had a catastrophic postoperative event; and patients in whom an acute illness develops superimposed on a chronic disorder (e.g., malnutrition, advanced age, heart disease, systemic infection, COPD).
- 2. Patients with chronic disorders who require mechanical ventilation for only a portion of the day, such as at night, but can support spontaneous ventilation on their own for several hours each day, such as severe COPD, kyphoscoliosis, and severe or progressing neuromuscular disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
- 3. Patients requiring continuous ventilatory support to survive, that is, patients diagnosed as having complete loss of ventilatory function with absent or severely impaired spontaneous breathing efforts. Examples include intracranial hemorrhage, cerebrovascular accidents, central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome, and diaphragmatic paralysis. This group also includes patients with severe respiratory muscle failure such as those with a high spinal cord injury, end-stage pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, and end-stage neuromuscular disorders.

meet criteria for a face mask or nasal mask for NIV, or the presence of a tracheostomy tube (TT) for invasive positive pressure ventilation (IPPV). Additionally, major diagnostic tests or therapeutic interventions should not be anticipated for at least 1 month after discharge. Box 21.3 lists selection criteria for children.26

#### **Psychosocial Factors**

The psychological stability and coping skills of the patient and family are critical to the success of long-term ventilation. The

#### Case Study 21.1

#### Patient Case—Difficulty Weaning

A 48-year-old male patient with stable amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (requiring nocturnal ventilation only) develops chest pain and is taken to the emergency department by his family. An electrocardiogram reveals an anterior myocardial infarction. The patient is intubated with a 7.5-Fr endotracheal tube and placed on appropriate ventilatory support.

The patient is stabilized, and, after 2 days on ventilation, a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) is attempted. The patient fails the SBT. He also fails SBTs evaluated over the next week. A tracheostomy is placed.

After 4 weeks in an acute care setting, the patient is medically stable but requires continuous ventilation. Why has it become so difficult to wean this patient? Would you recommend transferring this patient to another facility?

#### BOX **21.3**

Selection Criteria for Children to Be Ventilated at Home Infants and children being considered for home mechanical ventilation may have additional criteria besides clinical stability and financial resources that must be fulfilled. These criteria include the following:

- · Positive trends in weight gain and growth curve
- · Stamina for periods of play while ventilated
- Family determined to be suitable candidates, as shown by their awareness of potential stresses of long-term homecare and commitment to implementing the program
- Adequate family support from home nurses, homemaker aids, and family and friends

From American Thoracic Society Board of Directors: Official statement, *Am Rev Respir Dis* 141:258–259, 1990.

family must be made aware of the patient's prognosis and advantages and disadvantages of LTMV.

In cases in which the patient will be going home, a detailed psychological evaluation may be necessary to determine the ability of the patient and family to cope with stress. <sup>10,22</sup> If the requirements for patient care exceed the family's capabilities, professional assistance is essential. The availability of other support systems such as home health agencies, **respite care**, and psychological consultants are often critical to the success or failure of homecare candidates. The need for support and counseling is assessed before discharge and reassessed periodically while the patient remains on mechanical ventilatory support. <sup>27,28</sup>

#### **Financial Considerations**

Regardless of the location in which it is provided, mechanical ventilation is an expensive treatment modality. Note that mechanical ventilation in an ICU and acute care unit is the most expensive option of the facilities previously mentioned, whereas homecare ventilation is the least expensive. <sup>14-17</sup> It is important to recognize that despite the significant savings accrued when a

patient receives ventilatory care in the home, the overall cost can strain family budgets, even for those who are insured.

A variety of factors can influence the total cost associated with delivering LTMV. These factors include the following patient characteristics<sup>11,20</sup>:

- · Diagnosis
- Age
- Level of acuity
- Need for rehabilitation services (e.g., occupational therapy, physical therapy)
- · Type of ventilator selected
- · Need for monitoring
- Supplemental oxygen (O2)
- Medications

For example, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may require a higher level of care than patients with neuromuscular disorders because of the need for additional care such as suctioning, bronchopulmonary drainage, bronchodilator therapy, and anxiolytic and antibiotic administration. Children younger than 10 years may require higher costs because of special needs compared with adults.

For homecare patients, ventilator equipment can be bought at a reasonable price; however, in many cases, families may choose to rent the ventilator because regular service, maintenance, and 24-hour emergency services are available as part of the rental contract. Unfortunately, the costs of accessory medical supplies, including items such as suction catheters, skin lotions, and absorbent underpads, may be difficult to estimate and can significantly increase the total cost of care.

The major factor affecting the cost of homecare is the need for professional or skilled caregivers. This cost depends on the availability of family members and how much they are willing and able to do. Cost also depends on patient independence and self-care abilities and the number of hours and level of care required from others.<sup>21</sup>

It is important to recognize that inadequate third-party coverage for supplies and equipment, which is almost always passed on to the patient and family, must be factored into the costs of providing LTMV in the home. An estimate of the actual cost to the patient must be determined as accurately as possible and presented to the patient and family before discharging the patient from the care facility to the home.

#### PREPARATION FOR DISCHARGE TO THE HOME

Respiratory therapists who are assigned to prepare a ventilator-assisted patient for transfer to another facility or home must ensure that the receiving site can accommodate the patient's and family's needs. Although similarities in discharge planning exist between an acute care and an intermediate care facility, the transfer from either of these facilities to the patient's home requires particular attention. <sup>28,29</sup>

When the VAI is being transferred home, preparation is extremely important. Preparation of the home begins almost simultaneously with home and patient assessment and includes the process of equipment selection. The coordinated efforts of the multidisciplinary health care team, a comprehensive discharge prescription, and an educational program for the patient and caregivers are developed to ensure a safe transition from hospital to home or alternative care site (Key Point 21.2).

**Key Point 21.2** A discharge plan should contain the basic components of assessment, education, training, and a plan of care.<sup>10</sup>

The discharge process may be complex and time consuming depending on the patient's medical condition, needs, and goals. Consequently, it is initiated as early as possible before transfer to make it as smooth as possible. This often requires a minimum of a 7- to 14-day period before the patient is discharged because this much time may be needed to obtain insurance verification and authorization and equipment procurement. In other words, the plan may begin almost as soon as the patient is admitted to the acute care facility or as soon as he or she is identified as a VAI. The discharge planning process ensures patient safety and optimal outcome in the new environment.

The goal of the discharge planning team is to identify all patient care issues that need to be addressed before discharge and develop a plan of care to facilitate transfer. The health care team generally consists of the patient and family, the patient's primary physician, a pulmonary physician, a nurse, a respiratory therapist, and a social worker/hospital discharge planner. Depending on the patient's level of care, other specialists, such as a physical therapist, a psychologist, an occupational therapist, a speech-language pathologist, and a clinical dietitian, may also be included. The durable medical equipment (DME) supplier will also be a crucial member of this team, and equipment should be selected as soon as possible. A coordinator should be designated if a hospital-based discharge planner is not available. 31

Team members must communicate regularly to discuss the patient's progress and address any issues that may hinder the discharge process. A thorough review of the patient's hospital record is also important to determine the patient's history and established medical condition. Ventilator settings are discussed to ensure that the DME supplier can provide a ventilator that can accommodate the desired settings. An assessment of the financial status of the patient is imperative to ensure that additional assistance can be pursued for gaps that exist between third-party reimbursement and actual cost.

#### **Geographical and Home Assessment**

The geographical area where the patient will reside should be considered. This is necessary to ensure that a home health agency or DME provider is located near the patient's home and is available if technical assistance is required. Also, a hospital emergency department should be within a reasonable driving distance.

As part of the discharge plan, the medical supplier or practitioner assesses the patient's home environment to see whether any modifications must be made before the patient goes home. In general, this assessment includes a home visit to view the size of the patient care area and determine whether it is adequate for the prescribed equipment. Areas should be available for storage and cleaning and disposal of supplies. Judging the accessibility into and out of the home and between rooms is important and should not be overlooked. The home should also be assessed for safety (e.g., fire extinguishers, smoke detectors and alarms). The family needs to have telephone service. The number of people in the home may be a factor in the size of the space, and, of course, the primary caregivers must be identified.

The electrical system must provide adequate amperage for the ventilation, suction equipment, O<sub>2</sub> concentrator if needed, and

### BOX 21.4 Mapping Electrical Circuits in the Home

- Place a number by each of the circuit breakers or fuses in the main electrical panel.
- On a piece of paper for each room in the home, draw a square representing the room and mark each receptacle or light in the room.
- Make sure each receptacle has a small appliance or light plugged into it. Turn on all the lights and small appliances plugged into an electrical outlet.
- Turn off the first circuit and note the appliances affected (they will be off). Mark the circuit number by the receptacles and lights in that room on the drawing for that room.
- 5. Turn that circuit back on and turn off the next circuit in the numbering sequence.
- 6. Continue until all appliances or lights in all rooms have been assigned to a circuit.

From May D: Rehabilitation and continuity of care in pulmonary disease, St. Louis, MO, 1990, Mosby.

other necessary electrical devices. An important step is counting the number and type of electrical outlets and determining the amperage requirements of the equipment (Box 21.4). This may be accomplished by the family, or it may require an electrician.<sup>32</sup> When modifications in the home are recommended, they will not be covered by health insurance, which means that they will be out-of-pocket costs for the family. Therefore only absolutely necessary modifications should be made.<sup>33</sup>

#### **Family Education**

A written educational program is provided to caregivers and includes measurable performance objectives. At least three caregivers should be selected, with one being trained at a high enough level to be able to train and instruct other caregivers. Each discharge team member is responsible for educating the caregivers in specific areas of the management of the ventilator-dependent patient. The educational component includes providing detailed instructions on the operation of the ventilator, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the use of manual resuscitators, aseptic suctioning techniques, tracheostomy care, tracheostomy collars and humidification systems, methods of disinfecting equipment, bronchial hygiene therapies such as chest physiotherapy, aerosolized medication administration, bowel and bladder care, and bathing. The family is also taught to recognize early signs and symptoms of a respiratory infection (assessment) and what action must be taken if such a situation arises. Part of this process requires that the caregivers stay in the acute care facility for 24 to 48 hours before discharge, providing total care to the patient under the supervision of the medical staff. Additionally, a written protocol with directions for respiratory treatments and other aspects of care is included.

Not all caregivers will be able to tolerate performing some procedures, such as suctioning, bladder and bowel management, or bathing. Not surprisingly, working with a ventilator-dependent patient can be intimidating. Patience is essential in family training. In some cases, additional family members or outside caregivers are needed. An adequate number of caregivers should be identified and trained to allow the family time for sleep, work, and

relaxation. Outside caregivers may include the immediate family and extended family, friends, nonprofessional paid caregivers, volunteers, and paid licensed health professionals.

The respiratory therapist is charged with the responsibility to teach caregivers the skills necessary for airway maintenance (suctioning and tracheostomy care), ventilator settings, circuit maintenance, infection control, troubleshooting the equipment, and emergency measures. A basic checklist of these skills is given to the patient and family and used to guide the educational process. All family members involved in the patient's care need to demonstrate adequate hands-on performance of all aspects of patient care before the patient is discharged. Fig. 21.1 is an example of a caregiver assessment sheet. Once these tasks are learned and competencies are demonstrated, the patient is placed on the home ventilator several days before discharge, allowing family members to become comfortable with the process.

#### **Additional Preparation**

The primary physician typically arranges for medical care of the patient with a local physician and nursing service if the patient will reside in a location far from where the initial treatment was provided. The local hospital emergency department near the patient's residence should be designated for emergency care, with an emergency plan clearly outlined. The local power company must be notified in writing of the patient's condition. The patient's home will need a priority status for electrical power service in case of a power failure.

The family and patient must be prepared for emergency situations such as fires, hurricanes, tornados, flooding, and so forth. A contingency plan must be in place if power loss occurs from any of these disasters. A disaster may require evacuating the patient from the home to a special-needs shelter. Because of these possibilities, local fire departments, emergency medical teams, utility companies, police departments, and the local hospital emergency department should all be aware of the patient's urgent medical needs. Many communities have an office of emergency management that maintains a log of homecare patients along with their home addresses and contact information. This information can be critical in the case of a prolonged power outage or in the event that an emergency evacuation is required for the geographical area where the homecare patient resides.

#### **FOLLOW-UP AND EVALUATION**

Before the patient is discharged, equipment and supplies are set up in the patient's home or another care site and checked for proper placement and function. Members of the discharge planning team assist with the transfer from the acute care facility to the intermediate care facility or from the intermediate care facility to home or another alternative long-term care facility.

When a transfer to home is being coordinated, practitioners from the homecare company must be present. They can assist with the transfer to the ambulance and from the ambulance to the home. Homecare practitioners must be present when the patient arrives home to reassure the patient and family and alleviate any apprehensions.

Part of the assessment of the patient involves how the patient feels about his or her interaction with the ventilator once he or she arrives home. Simple but key questions to ask include the following<sup>34</sup>:

· Are you feeling anxious?

- Are you getting a deep enough breath?
- Does the breath last long enough?
- Is it too deep?
- Do you have enough time to get all your air out?
- Do you need more breaths? Do you need fewer breaths?

Initially patients may require frequent home visits or daily calls until they are stable and adjusted to a routine of care. Once this routine is established, only formal monthly visits are necessary to evaluate the patient and report on progress. Box 21.5 reviews follow-up and evaluation of infants and children. Evaluations during home visits may include patient assessment parameters such as bedside pulmonary function studies, vital signs, and pulse oximetry. Assessment in the home does not generally include ABG studies.

Assessment may include observation of the home environment and assessment of the equipment and any other problems the patient or family members may have. In some cases, other health care providers may need retraining. For example, a homecare nurse may be disposing of the TT after each weekly visit, not realizing this was not appropriate. Another example involves a family member calling the homecare respiratory therapist because of a frequent high-pressure alarm. In this latter example, the family needs retraining about how to identify when suctioning is needed.

A written report is completed after the monthly visit, and copies are sent to the patient's physician, homecare agency, and other members of the health care team. This report might include the following:

- · Identification of company, servicing location, date, and time
- Patient name, address, phone, e-mail
- · Patient diagnosis
- Physician and phone number
- · Prescribed equipment and procedures
- Assessment (vital signs, breath sounds, sputum evaluation, O<sub>2</sub> saturation [S<sub>p</sub>O<sub>2</sub>], ventilator parameter and alarm settings, functioning of ancillary equipment)
- Caregiver and patient (if possible) comprehension of equipment and procedures
- Compliance with plan of care
- Recommendations of DME company representative

The task of caring for ventilator-dependent patients often creates frustration and anxiety for family members who are the primary caregivers. If problems are identified during home visits, the patient's physician should be notified. It may be necessary to provide psychological counseling to family members or suggest an alternative means of care (e.g., respite care) to allow family members time to rest.

#### **Adequate Nutrition**

Another aspect that must not be ignored is the nutritional status of the patient. Food intake is critical in avoiding problems associated with poor nutrition, such as increased risk for infection (e.g., pneumonia) and weakened muscles, including the diaphragm.<sup>35</sup> Caregivers should have a general idea of the patient's food and fluid intake and output. Constipation and bowel impaction need to be avoided. Some patients are at risk for aspiration when taking food by mouth, in which case a preferred feeding route might be through a gastrostomy tube or a jejunostomy tube.

#### **Family Issues**

Despite all efforts to discharge patients successfully to home, some factors may be difficult to manage. Significant delays in discharge

BOX 21.5

#### Follow-up and Evaluation for Infants and Children Ventilated in the Home

Ventilator requirements of infants and children change because of their growth and development. Periodic (once every months) in-hospital evaluations may be necessary for the first 2 years of life and twice yearly thereafter until age 4 or 5 years.

from the hospital may occur if organizing the discharge plan or providing adequate funding is not possible.<sup>4,33</sup> Often one or more family members will lose employment time when a patient is discharged to home. This can worsen the family's financial position. Planned funding may have been based on the family's budget before discharge.

In addition, the respite for family caregivers may not be adequate. Getting extended family members and friends to help will not be successful unless these individuals are adequately trained in the care of the VAI. When caregivers from outside the family are in the home 24 hours a day, this erodes family privacy and can be stressful.<sup>36</sup> When external caregivers take vacation or sick days, the family caregivers often have to step in to provide additional coverage.

Careful, well-planned, timely preparation is absolutely essential to success in discharging a VAI from an acute care facility to home or a skilled nursing facility. Patient and home assessment, caregiver education and training, and demonstration of care by caregivers are all important elements. Box 21.6 lists the primary components of a discharge plan for sending the patient home on long-term ventilation.33

#### **BOX 21.6** Primary Components of a Discharge Plan for Sending the Patient Home on Long-Term Ventilation

#### Preparation of the Patient for Discharge

- · Stabilization of the patient's medical condition
- · Evaluation and development of realistic goals
- · Rehabilitation planning to set the stage for training
- Physical rehabilitation training plan to increase the patient's strength and endurance

#### **Discharge Plan Implementation**

- · Appointment of a discharge planning team and a team
- · Assignment of team member responsibilities
- · Communication among team members
- Education of the caregivers and the patient
- Review of the patient's chart and ventilator orders
- Geographical survey of patient's home location
- · Assessment of the home environment
- · Review of the electrical system in the home
- · Provision of a written education program and instructions
- Demonstration by caregiver(s)
- · Primary physician and nursing service arrangements
- · Planning for emergencies

#### **EQUIPMENT SELECTION FOR HOME VENTILATION**

When patients are transferred to their home, equipment setup, instructions, and planning are especially important. Families must have immediate access to all required equipment and supplies. Box 21.7 provides a preliminary checklist of equipment for care of the mechanically ventilated patient in the home.

It should be apparent that the most important equipment to be selected is the ventilator. Selection depends on the goals for the particular patient. Ventilation can be provided by IPPV to patients with a TT. IPPV is indicated for patients who have persistent symptomatic hypoventilation. It is also indicated for patients who do not meet selection criteria for NIV or who are unable to tolerate NIV or negative pressure ventilation (NPV).

This section reviews ventilator selection for IPPV and NPV and the use of noninvasive devices, such as the rocking bed and the pneumobelt, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices, and noninvasive devices for secretion clearance. The use of NIV is discussed in Chapter 19.

#### **Tracheostomy Tubes**

The use of TTs is essential for invasive LTMV. Generally, a tracheotomy is performed as soon as possible after the need for extended intubation is verified and it appears the patient is likely to benefit from the procedure. This usually occurs when a patient is stabilized on the ventilator in an acute care hospital within about 7 days of the onset of respiratory failure or sooner in patients who are neurologically impaired. Chapter 20 reviews the role of tracheostomy in ventilator discontinuation. The use of speaking tubes and devices for patients with long-term tracheostomies is explained later in this chapter.

#### Ventilator Selection

Many types and models of ventilators are available for home use. Some of these are quite sophisticated, offering an array of modes, alarm systems, and other complex ventilatory characteristics. Although these machines may occasionally be necessary for medical stability outside the hospital, simple technology should be the goal of ventilator selection when it is possible.34,

The most important factors in choosing a ventilator are the

- · Reliability. The ventilator must be mechanically dependable and trouble free for extended periods without breaking down or requiring costly maintenance.
- Safety. The ventilator must be safe to operate in O2-enriched environments and have an adequate alarm system to warn of low ventilating pressure, high ventilating pressure, patient disconnection, and mechanical failure.
- Versatility. The ventilator should be portable or able to be adjusted for travel outside the home, necessitating the use of reliable internal and external battery sources and alarms.
- User-friendly. Ventilator controls should be easy to understand and manipulate. The circuit should be simple and easy to
- Easy patient cycling. The ventilator should be easy to cycle in the volume-controlled continuous mandatory ventilation (VC-CMV) mode for patients able to make spontaneous

For all home ventilator patients, backup ventilatory support must be available in case of electrical failure or malfunction.

A self-inflating manual resuscitator should be readily available, and caregivers should be instructed on proper use of these devices. If a patient can maintain spontaneous ventilation for 4 or more consecutive hours, a manual resuscitator may be all that is necessary as a backup. For patients who are totally dependent on ventilatory support or those who live far from medical support, a second mechanical ventilator is necessary as a backup. Those patients who require supplemental O2 should also have a concentrator and an E-cylinder as a backup.

#### **Examples of Homecare and Transport Ventilators**

A positive pressure ventilator is the most commonly used device for providing ventilatory support for homecare patients. Unlike the large and sophisticated positive pressure ventilators used in the ICU, homecare ventilators have an array of advantages; notably, they are compact, lightweight, and portable. Most of these homecare units are designed to use three different power sources: normal AC current, internal DC battery, and external DC battery. Ventilators that use an external DC battery can be mounted relatively easily on a wheelchair or placed in a motor vehicle, enhancing a patient's capability of mobility and participation in other activities.

Many homecare positive pressure ventilators have been developed in the past three decades. The following sections do not completely describe all of the available features of each ventilator, but a brief review is provided. Additional information about these units and other homecare ventilators is described elsewhere.

First-generation portable volume ventilators. Most of the first-generation portable ventilators are no longer manufactured; however, many are still used in this country and around the world. This is because of their simplicity and reliability. Firstgeneration ventilators are lightweight (average, 30 lb) and can serve as both transport ventilators and ventilators for long-term care sites. In general, they are easy-to-use, piston-driven ventilators that can provide VC-CMV and VC-IMV modes. They also have high- and low-pressure, ventilator-malfunction, and power-loss alarms. Some offer additional alarms such as "setting error" (e.g., Aequitron LP6 Plus and LP10 [Covidien-Nellcor Puritan Bennett, Boulder, CO] and Lifecare PLV-100 and PLV-102 [Philips Respironics, Eindhoven, The Netherlands]).

These units generally operate from a standard 115- to 120-volt AC electrical outlet. Although they possess an internal battery, these batteries have limited capabilities (15-60 minutes). The battery capacity varies depending on the ventilator settings and by the type of ventilator being used.<sup>43</sup> Most portable ventilators can be connected to a 12-volt DC, deep-cycle marine-type battery as an external power source. These batteries are heavy (30-40 lb) but can provide extended power for several hours depending on the workload (respiratory rate [f] and tidal volume  $[V_T]$ ) set on the ventilator.

To provide an intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) system for home use, practitioners used to add an external H-valve assembly to home ventilators. However, the additional equipment increased the cost and complexity of home ventilatory support. Consequently, manufacturers designed subsequent models to provide the IMV/synchronized IMV (SIMV) mode without the need for added circuitry. Example ventilators include the LP10 and LP20 ventilators. Although these ventilators simplify the IMV circuitry, demand or continuous-gas flow systems are not incorporated into their design. During spontaneous breathing, the patient must draw gas from an air intake valve in the piston chamber or through the exhalation valve of the ventilator circuit. As a result, the inspiratory work of breathing (WOB) can be significant. <sup>10,44</sup> Therefore IMV/SIMV is not recommended for long-term ventilation with these ventilators (Key Point 21.3). <sup>10,43-45</sup>

**Key Point 21.3** "The SIMV mode found on (older generation) home care ventilators is not recommended without modification of the gas delivery system with a one-way valve in the inspiratory limb to allow inspiration from the atmosphere. A continuous high gas flow system may also be used but is not preferred in the long-term home setting." <sup>10</sup>

When the patient requires an  $F_1O_2$  greater than 0.21,  $O_2$  must be bled into the system. This can be done after the outflow valve from the ventilator by using a separate  $O_2$  source (concentrator or cylinder  $O_2$ ). It is important to recognize that adding flow to the inspiratory limb of the ventilator may make it more difficult for the ventilator to sense a patient's inspiratory effort. Ventilators with a sensitivity setting (patient triggering) may need the sensitivity reset. Another option is to use a reservoir bag or mixing chamber primed with  $O_2$  that can be added to the ventilator's air intake. Sometimes this procedure can increase the  $F_1O_2$  to more than 0.4, depending on the ventilator in use.

Some units have a system to provide up to 100%  $O_2$ -enriched gas to the patient. A reservoir or optional elbow attachment is connected to the machine's patient outlet to allow a flow of  $O_2$  to be introduced into the patient circuit. These systems deliver up to 100%  $O_2$ -enriched gas, depending on the flow of the gas and changes in a patient's minute ventilation ( $\dot{V}_E$ ). In general, a patient's  $F_IO_2$  requirements should be less than 0.40. The need for an  $F_IO_2$  greater than 0.40 indicates clinical instability that requires more respiratory care than is available at home.

On most portable ventilators, PEEP can be obtained by attaching an external threshold resistor to the patient circuit exhalation valve. These PEEP valves add to circuit complexity and may become dislodged from the exhalation valve or cause  $V_T$  loss.  $^{33,46}$  They may also increase a patient's WOB, especially if the machine sensitivity is not properly adjusted.  $^{33}$  PEEP should not be used for patients ventilated at home unless absolutely necessary. Its use also often indicates clinical instability, especially when adequate oxygenation must be maintained.  $^{33}$ 

First-generation ventilators have provided dependable service in a variety of environments for many years. Although these devices are considered reliable devices by some patients, a second generation of ventilators is available with a variety of improvements in IMV delivery, patient triggering, PEEP, and  $F_1O_2$  administration.

**Current-generation portable ventilators.** Current portable positive pressure ventilators are primarily microprocessor controlled. These second-generation portable ventilators may be patient or time triggered; pressure or volume targeted; and pressure, volume, flow, or time cycled. Examples of current-generation units are listed in Box 21.8.

Current-generation homecare ventilators are much more advanced in their design and provide a greater number of advanced features (e.g., LTV 1200 ventilators [Vyaire Medical, Mettawa, IL]). The LTV series ventilators are electrically powered units that use an internal rotary compressor to generate gas flow. The LTV 1200 model ventilator is small enough to be portable (see Fig. 19.3). The LTV 1200 model offers enough features and alarms to allow it to be used in the acute care setting. LTV ventilators provide ventilation in the following modes: CMV, IMV, CPAP, apnea backup ventilation, and NIV. The IMV provided is more advanced than with first-generation ventilators, and the WOB associated with it is not as high. Other second-generation ventilators, such as the Newport HT70 Plus (Medtronic Minimally Invasive Therapies, Minneapolis, MN), can provide a variety of features (Fig. 21.2). Some features include A/CMV, IMV, spontaneous, NIV, pressure support, pressure control, and volume control ventilation. The Newport HT70 is lightweight and small and can be operated from a variety of AC or DC external power sources or from an internal dual battery system. It can be used for infant, pediatric, and adult populations.

Extensive alarm systems are incorporated into newer homecare ventilators. Some alarms are automatic, whereas other alarms are adjustable and require the operator to enter a desired alarm setting. Alarms can alert the operator in cases of low battery power, power loss, low pressure, high pressure, power switchover, apnea,  $O_2$  fail, and microprocessor malfunction.  $^{41,45}$ 

Current-generation ventilators provide a variety of features that can be used for portable and home use. Respiratory therapists must familiarize themselves with all units used by their organization because functions and features can vary considerably from one unit to another.

It is important to recognize that versatility is important when selecting a long-term ventilator. However, quality, reliability, and safety are the most important factors that must be considered when selecting an appropriate homecare and transport ventilator.

# COMPLICATIONS OF LONG-TERM POSITIVE PRESSURE VENTILATION

In addition to the potential failure or malfunction of the ventilator or artificial airway, complications of long-term positive pressure ventilation may also include the following:

· Pulmonary complications

- Complications to the cardiovascular system, the airway, and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and neurological complications
- · Problems associated with immobility
- · Psychological dysfunction

The pulmonary, cardiovascular, and GI problems in long-term VAIs are similar, in many respects, to those seen in critically ill patients on ventilation (see Chapters 16 and 17 for additional information on complications of mechanical ventilation.) Fig. 21.3 compares airway problems in the acute care setting (acute complications) with the long-term care facility (chronic complications). Complications to the airway in VAIs are listed in Box 21.9.3 Unlike nosocomial infections in the ICU setting, ventilatorassociated pneumonia (VAP) in VAIs is often caused by enteric gram-negative bacteria such as Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.<sup>3</sup> These organisms are often resistant to a variety of antibiotics. In patients receiving home mechanical ventilation by NIV, Staphylococcus aureus has been cited as a common contaminant of the ventilator circuit and nasal mask. Colonization of this organism has also been found in patients' nostrils.47

GI disorders may occur in VAI from chronic illness, resulting in system breakdown. GI problems in VAIs may include the following:

- · Damage to the GI mucosa from stress
- · Swallowing dysfunction and aspiration
- Hypomotility of the GI tract causing constipation and ileus
   In addition, placement of nasogastric tubes or the occurrence
   of reflux can cause erosive esophagitis, which may occur in up to
   50% of VAIs. 48

Approximately 45% of patients who transfer to long-term care facilities on mechanical ventilation have some type of neurological disorder, which is generally the primary cause of their ventilator

dependence.<sup>48</sup> Neurological or neuromuscular dysfunctions can be caused by patients' chronic morbidities or follow an acute severe illness. Determining the major contributing neuropsychological problem is not always possible.<sup>48</sup>

To avoid some of the complications of long-term ventilation, early mobilization, as part of the rehabilitation process, can help reduce muscle and skeletal wasting and reduce the risk for decubitus ulcers.

Psychological problems in VAIs can be attributed to a host of causes, including the following<sup>48</sup>:

- · Severity of illness
- · Longevity of illness
- Multiple medications (sedatives, analgesics, psychotropics, steroids [see Chapter 15])
- Sleep disruption
- Delirium
- Anxietv
- Depression

As previously noted, critically ill patients who cannot be easily weaned from ventilatory support after recovery of the acute illness are more susceptible to complications of mechanical ventilation. Efforts must be aimed at preventing these complications to have a better chance of discontinuing ventilation and improving the patient's quality of life.

# ALTERNATIVES TO INVASIVE MECHANICAL VENTILATION AT HOME

In addition to NIV by nasal mask and invasive mechanical ventilation via a TT, alternative methods of ventilation for VAIs include NPV, noninvasive breathing support devices, nasal CPAP for treating obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and glossopharyngeal breathing.

#### **Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation**

For years NPV and IPPV were the only mechanical ventilation systems available for people with moderate to severe chronic respiratory failure. Since the early 1980s, a number of alternative methods of mechanical ventilation for use in the home and acute care facility have been introduced. The effectiveness of NIV delivered through a nasal mask, nasal pillows, a mouthpiece or mouth seal, or CPAP through a nasal mask have been examined in several studies of patients with neuromuscular disorders, chest wall defects, obstructive and restrictive intrinsic lung diseases, and OSA. These studies found that NIV or CPAP can prevent episodes of severe hypoxemia and hypercapnia in selected groups of patients. In addition, daytime PaO2 and PaCO2 improved in the studies' subjects. Improvement in respiratory muscle strength and stabilization of lung volumes was also reported.<sup>59</sup> Patients reported subjective improvement in symptoms such as headaches and daytime somnolence and an increase in their ability to perform activities of daily living. Abundant evidence now supports the effectiveness of NIV and CPAP assistance in the homecare setting.

Chapter 19 provides an extensive discussion of NIV as an alternative method for support of ventilation in both the acute care and long-term care of patients.

#### **Negative Pressure Ventilation**

Negative pressure ventilation (NPV) is durable, easy to use, and dependable. It is used less often than invasive mechanical ventilation or NIV but is occasionally used for long-term ventilation. NPV can provide support to a patient without requiring an artificial airway; thus patients can speak, eat, and drink while avoiding the complications associated with artificial airways.

Use of NPV is preferable for patients with disorders such as neuromuscular disease, spinal cord injuries, chest wall disorders, or central hypoventilation syndromes. Nighttime use in patients with COPD is another example of their application, although some of these patients find NPV difficult to tolerate. Note that for the treatment of *acute* respiratory failure in patients with COPD, NIV is the mode of choice.

If excessive airway secretions, decreased pulmonary compliance, or increased airway resistance are present, or if the patient is at risk for aspiration, NPV is not recommended (see Chapter 1 for additional details about the physiology of NPV). NPV is available in three basic designs: iron lung (tank ventilator), cuirass, and body suit or jacket ventilator. <sup>66,67</sup>

#### Tank Ventilators/Iron Lungs

Iron lung ventilators enclose the patient's whole body (except for the head) and seal around the neck. They are sometimes referred to as *body tanks*. The Emerson Respirator (or "iron lung") and the Philips Respironics Lifecare NEV-100 are two examples.

Tank ventilators work by transmitting negative pressure across the chest wall, into the pleural space, and finally to the alveolar level. The resulting increase in transpulmonary pressure causes air to enter the lungs. Exhalation is passive and depends on the elastic recoil of the lung and chest wall.

Tank ventilators have several disadvantages: they are large (3 m long and 136 kg) and cumbersome and make bronchial drainage, intravenous therapy, and physical contact with the patient difficult. In some patients, negative pressure applied to the abdominal area and thorax results in a pooling of blood in the abdominal vasculature, which leads to a decrease in venous return to the heart and, subsequently, a reduction in cardiac output. If a patient is

hypovolemic, this results in hypotension. Some patients, on the other hand, have augmented venous return to the thorax and an improvement in cardiac output. If the patient has excessive secretions or a depressed (obtunded) epiglottic reflex response, airway management becomes a problem and requires an artificial airway.

Because older tank ventilators are controllers, they allow little, if any, adjustments if the patient makes spontaneous efforts.  $V_T$  is determined by the amount of negative pressure applied and the characteristics of the lung. Consequently,  $V_T$  must be measured during setup and throughout use of the tank ventilator. Newer models allow for patient-triggered ventilation.<sup>61</sup>

The Porta-lung (Philips Respironics) is a portable version of the iron lung that is smaller (2 m) and lighter weight (50 kg). Current models allow for a ventilator rate (f) range of 12 to 24 breaths/min and a pressure range of -15 to -45 cm  $H_2O$ .

Starting NPV in the treatment of chronic respiratory failure is carried out in a manner similar to that with IPPV. For example, typically pressures of -12 to -25 cm  $H_2O$  are sufficient to generate an adequate  $V_T$ . Adjustments are based on the achieved  $V_T$ , blood gases, and pulse oximetry evaluation during use. It is important to understand that NPV may induce or exacerbate OSA.  $^{67,68}$  If a patient has or develops OSA, the use of NPV, regardless of how it is applied, is contraindicated because it may aggravate the associated airway closure.  $^{69}$ 

#### The Chest Cuirass

The chest cuirass, or chest shell, partially compensates for some of the problems that occur with tank ventilators. The cuirass is a rigid shell that is placed over the patient's chest, touching the upper abdomen (Fig. 21.4). A space exists between the shell and chest wall. This design restricts most of the negative pressure to the thoracic area, thus relieving most of the abdominal area from exposure to negative pressure. Some models have a trigger device that detects changes in flow or pressure at the nostrils. When a patient's inspiratory effort is detected, an assist breath is delivered. These sensing devices are not as efficient as those used with positive pressure ventilators; therefore the patient's inspiratory work to achieve a ventilator response is greater.

The chest cuirass and body suit or body wrap (see later section on The Body Suit) are attached by hoses to an external pump that generates alternating negative pressure. The chest cuirass is the least efficient NPV device and may not be adequate for severely compromised patients. Pressures of -35 to -60 cm  $\rm H_2O$  may be

necessary to achieve sufficient  $V_T$  with the chest cuirass. Osometimes sufficient negative pressure cannot be achieved. This may be attributable to leaks in the system, particularly with older sealing materials. Plastic wrapping that is placed around the shell and newer custom-made shells can help eliminate the leakage problem. Other problems with the cuirass include patient discomfort and skin abrasions at points of contact. In patients with severe chest wall deformities, a custom-made cuirass may be required. Despite some difficulties, the chest cuirass is still being successfully used in the treatment of patients.

#### The Body Suit

A third type of NPV is the body suit, which is a rigid chest grid that, in some models, attaches to a flat back plate. The rigid portion is fitted with a "rain jacket" or poncho wrap with fittings at the neck, wrists, waist, and ankles, depending on the style (Fig. 21.5). Two of the currently available models are the Pulmo-Wrap (Lifecare International Inc., Lafayette, CO) and Poncho-Wrap (Emerson JH, Cambridge, MA).<sup>61</sup>

The body wrap is more portable than the tank ventilator. It also allows the patient to sleep in his or her own bed. However, it is less efficient and hard to completely seal. Negative pressure is applied to a smaller surface area than with the tank ventilator. Because it restricts movement and patient positioning, it can cause muscular and joint pain, particularly back pain. <sup>61</sup>

NPV is not used nearly as much as portable PPV for long-term ventilation. However, it still has an occasional place in patient support. For example, a patient may be able to be in a wheelchair during the day and use a portable volume ventilator with a mouthpiece as an interface. At night, the patient could use NPV. Both techniques allow noninvasive ventilation and avoid the necessity of a tracheostomy.

#### **Additional Noninvasive Devices**

Two additional noninvasive techniques for assisting ventilation are the rocking bed and pneumobelt. Both devices operate by the principle of moving the abdominal contents and diaphragm to aid in breathing. They both rely on the compliance of the abdomen and chest wall and are not appropriate for obese patients, those with severe chest wall deformities, or patients with intrinsic lung disease.

The **rocking bed** (Fig. 21.6) is all but obsolete, but it has been used as an alternative form of noninvasive ventilatory support.  $^{1,74}$

Fig. 21.6 The rocking bed. (Courtesy Emerson Company, Boston, Mass.)

For example, in one reported case, a 40-year-old woman with muscular dystrophy required nocturnal ventilatory support. Eventually, as her muscle weakness progressed, she had difficulty setting up her NIV circuit. The rocking bed turned out to be a successful alternative form of support.75

Another situation in which the rocking bed has been shown to be effective is in patients with bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis.<sup>76</sup> This condition can occur as a potential postoperative complication of cardiac surgery.

The rocking bed is a motorized bed that continuously moves in a longitudinal plane. The patient is placed in a supine position in the bed. As Fig. 21.6 shows, the patient's head and knees can be elevated, which may improve patient comfort and help prevent sliding. The bed supports ventilation by rhythmically moving through an arch of 40 to 60 degrees (Trendelenburg to the reverse Trendelenburg position). The rate of rocking is 12 to 22 times/ min. The optimal range is approximately 12 to 16 times/min.<sup>1</sup> Expiration is assisted when the head is in the down position and the abdominal contents and diaphragm are moved by gravity toward the thorax (cephalad). When the feet are in the down position (reverse Trendelenburg position), the diaphragm and abdominal contents move toward the feet (caudad) and inspiration is assisted. The rocking bed generally does not cause motion sickness, probably because it rotates only in one plane. Box 21.10 lists conditions in which the rocking bed should be avoided.

The pneumobelt (Fig. 21.7), also referred to as an intermittent abdominal pressure ventilator, contains an inflatable bladder that

BOX 21.10 Conditions in Which the Rocking Bed Is Not Effective or Should Be Used With Caution

- Obesity
- Excessively thin patients
- Severe chest wall abnormalities
- Infants
- Intrinsic lung disease

Fig. 21.7 The pneumobelt with positive pressure generator. (From Cairo JM, Pilbeam SP: *Mosby's respiratory care equipment*, ed 8, St. Louis, MO, 2010, Mosby.)

fits between the umbilicus (below the xiphoid process) and the pubic arch (over the abdomen) and is held in place by a nylon corset. Like the rocking bed, use of the pneumobelt is limited in clinical practice. The upper edge of the belt just overlaps the lower end of the rib cage. The patient must be in a seated position (45 degrees or more) to use this device. It is ineffective if the head is lower than 30 degrees from horizontal.<sup>73</sup> The pneumobelt should fit snugly in place but must not impede spontaneous ventilation. A motor inflates the bladder, which pushes the abdominal content up, moving the diaphragm upward (cephalad) to assist exhalation. Deflating the bladder allows the diaphragm to return to the resting position, allowing inhalation. The device is not very powerful. A positive pressure ventilator able to generate pressure of approximately 50 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and an inspiration-expiration ratio of 1:2 can be used to power the device. 10 The inflation rate is set to approximate the patient's spontaneous rate (12-22 breaths/min). Pressure is increased from approximately 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O upward until a satisfactory V<sub>T</sub> is achieved or until the patient reports discomfort.

The pneumobelt is best used for daytime and, like the rocking bed, may be effective for patients with bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis and patients with high spinal cord lesions. The pneumobelt can be used as an adjunct with other forms of assisting ventilation. Some patients can sleep in the upright position. In these cases, it also can be used during the night.

#### **Diaphragm Pacing**

Some patients with respiratory failure caused by high spinal cord lesions or central hypoventilation can benefit from diaphragmatic pacing. With this therapeutic intervention, the phrenic nerve is electrically stimulated through surgically implanted phrenic electrodes connected to an implanted receiver. The receiver obtains signal transmissions from an extracorporeal radiofrequency transmitter and antenna.

This technology has limited application. Not all patients will respond to this type of intervention because of inadequate phrenic nerve and diaphragm function. In addition, some patients experience obstructive apnea and a drop in  $\rm S_pO_2$  during sleep when using this technology. Diaphragmatic pacing systems do not have alarms, although failure can occur. This technology is also expensive, with initial costs in excess of \$300,000.  $^{10}$ 

Although diaphragmatic pacing equipment is much smaller than a portable ventilator, it does not provide many additional advantages. Patients can learn to talk and eat with a TT in place by using a portable ventilator. The use of phrenic pacing is probably best reserved for children with high spinal cord injuries or central hypoventilation who cannot use other noninvasive methods to assist ventilation.<sup>10</sup>

#### Continuous Positive Airway Pressure for Obstructive Sleep Apnea

Clinicians should be aware of the fact that some patients who require some form of noninvasive support may have OSA and need additional assistance to treat this disorder. An accepted method of treating patients is the application of CPAP via a face mask or nasal mask.

The decision to use CPAP depends on the degree of upper airway obstruction that the patient demonstrates and his or her respiratory muscle strength. For those patients who have adequate respiratory muscle strength and do not require mechanical ventilation but become hypercapnic and hypoxemic during sleep, nasal CPAP may be all that is necessary to alleviate hypoxemia and alveolar collapse. This is especially true for patients with OSA. CPAP levels can be titrated to increase expired lung volumes during sleep and reduce inspiratory and expiratory resistance, resulting in improvement of  $P_aO_2$ , decreased respiratory rate, and prevention of air trapping. The diagnosis of OSA and the procedure for establishing the appropriate level of CPAP for the patient are typically performed in a sleep study laboratory.

#### **CPAP Systems**

A nasal CPAP system for homecare consists of two main elements: an air blower unit and a nasal mask system.<sup>75</sup> The blower incorporates an electrically powered motor, fan assembly or turbine, and a mechanism for setting and controlling the pressure delivered to the circuit. Air from the blower is delivered to the nasal mask through a lightweight 21-mm-diameter corrugated plastic hose that is attached to a one-way valve or a whisper swivel valve. These specialized valves prevent expired gas from flowing into the inspiratory limb and typically include a fixed leak.

The nasal mask system usually includes a soft, translucent mask. The mask is available in a variety of sizes designed to custom fit faces (see Figs. 19.4 through 19.7). Other alternatives to the nasal mask include the nasal pillow (Fig. 21.8; see also Fig. 19.8) and the oral mask. Nasal pillows are short silicone tubes that fit the patient's nares to eliminate excessive leaks. A small opening in the nasal interface allows for exhalation of gases. The oral mask is a soft silicone mouthpiece with an inner flap that fits inside the mouth and in front of the teeth. An outer silicone flap is positioned on the outside of the mouth, sealing the lips. Nasal masks, nasal pillows, and oral masks are secured to the face by lightweight, adjustable headgear.

Levels of CPAP ranging from 2.5 to 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O are available on most homecare units. Home CPAP units incorporate electronic pressure transducers that sense pressure changes in the circuit and regulate the amount of flow into the circuit. As the patient inhales and the circuit pressure decreases, the pressure transducers increase the blower speed, allowing more air to move into the circuit. As the patient begins to exhale and circuit pressure increases, the amount of air flowing into the circuit decreases. The increase and decrease of airflow in response to circuit pressure changes allow the patient to inhale and exhale against the same pressure.

Operation of these CPAP units by patients and their family simply involves turning the "on/off" switch to the "on" position. The level of prescribed CPAP is set by the respiratory therapist or medical supplier during installation of the unit in the home. Most

current devices have "hidden" menus and controls that prevent access by the user. Once the prescribed levels are set, a panel conceals the controls.

**Potential complications of CPAP.** All forms of positive pressure ventilation have associated risks and complications. However, the risk for such problems is greatly reduced by using CPAP, compared with conventional mechanical ventilation. Complications associated with CPAP by nasal mask are reviewed in Chapter 19 and are summarized in Table 21.1, <sup>56,77-80</sup>

#### **Glossopharyngeal Breathing**

Glossopharyngeal breathing, or "frog" breathing, is a technique for assisting alveolar ventilation in patients with poor respiratory muscle strength. Patients who may benefit from learning this technique include those with spinal cord injury or *postpolio syndrome*. The technique requires good tongue strength, an intact gag reflex, absence of tracheostomy, and the ability to close the nasal passages and larynx and to swallow.<sup>81</sup>

Glossopharyngeal breathing is performed as follows. Approximately 50 to 100 mL of air is trapped in the oropharynx when the mouth and nasopharynx are closed. Then the jaw and larynx are raised while the continued forward motion of the tongue forces air from the larynx into the trachea. Then the glottis is closed and the technique is repeated. Approximately 10 to 15 rapid swallows are repeated in approximately 10 seconds, during which time the volume of air going into the lungs increases. The larynx is then opened and the patient exhales passively. A well-trained patient can perform 10 to 12 such breaths per minute, accomplishing adequate minute ventilation. 10

The technique is difficult to learn, but once it is mastered, it can significantly increase inspiratory capacity and expiratory flow

sufficient to generate effective coughs. It may also allow VAIs increased time off the ventilator and security in the event of ventilator failure during sleep.  $^{81}$ 

# **EXPIRATORY MUSCLE AIDS AND SECRETION CLEARANCE**

Patients with neuromuscular disorders, restrictive intrinsic lung disease, and COPD may use NIV techniques for as long as 24 hours a day, thus avoiding tracheostomy (see Chapter 19). However, one of the major difficulties with this type of support is the management of airway secretions, especially when respiratory infections are present. Adequate respiratory muscle function is critical for clearing airway secretions. Most VAIs do not have sufficient strength to produce an effective cough. That is, they cannot generate a vital capacity (VC) of more than 1.5 L or a peak cough expiratory flow (PCEF) of more than 3 L/s. Some form of cough assistance is necessary if pulmonary complications are to be avoided. The following techniques have successfully improved lung volumes and reversed arterial desaturation from secretions and mucus plugging: assisted coughing, chest wall oscillation, and mechanical insufflation-exsufflation.

#### **Assisted Coughing**

Assisted coughing is a technique of applying abdominal thrusts or compression to a patient's anterior chest wall during the expiratory phase of breathing. The purpose is to increase expiratory gas flow. This maneuver requires a well-coordinated effort between the patient and caregiver. Before applying the thrusts, the patient is instructed to take a deep breath to maximum inspiratory capacity. If the patient's VC is less than 1.5 L, a positive pressure deep insufflation is administered before expiratory thrusts. A manual resuscitator can be used for this purpose. The expiratory thrusts

can increase the patient's expiratory flow to approximately 5 L/s provided that the patient is cooperative and the caregiver has adequate physical effort and coordination. 82 Manually assisted coughing is usually not effective for severe scoliosis or obesity and is contraindicated for patients with osteoporosis. It should not be performed on patients after they have consumed a meal.

#### **Mechanical Oscillation**

High-frequency mechanical oscillation is a technique in which rapid pressure pulses are applied to the chest wall or upper airway. The purpose is to assist in the mobilization of secretions. The Vest (Advanced Respiratory, Hill-Rom, Corp, St. Paul, MN) and the Hayek Oscillator (Breasy Medical Equipment Ltd, London, UK) are devices used to deliver high-frequency external chest wall oscillation. With these devices, chest wall vibrations are delivered to a vest placed around the patient's thorax. Vibrations are produced through a series of air pressure pulses delivered to plastic bladders located on the inner walls of the vest. The air pressure pulses are produced by an air compressor connected to the vest by large-bore, corrugated tubing. For some VAIs, airway clearance with chest wall oscillation may be more effective than chest physical therapy or oscillating valve devices (e.g., Flutter device or Acapella). Additional studies are needed to support these findings. Basel airway clearance with chest wall oscillations are needed to support these findings.

#### **Mechanical Insufflation-Exsufflation**

The theory of operation of mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) involves inflating the patient's lungs via a mouthpiece, mask, or tracheostomy and then providing forced exsufflation as the positive pressure rapidly decreases to subatmospheric pressure. The insufflator-exsufflator (Courtesy Philips Respironics, Murrysville, PA) shown in Fig. 21.9 allows manual cycling between positive and negative pressure so that caregiver-patient coordination is optimized. Its use is typically reserved for patients in whom manually assisted coughing is inadequate.

Pressures can be adjusted from +65 to -65 cm  $H_2O$ , but pressures of  $\pm 30$  to  $\pm 40$  cm  $H_2O$  are the most commonly effective and best tolerated pressure ranges. These ranges represent a 60 to 90 cm  $H_2O$  change in pressure over a 0.2-second period. One

treatment consists of approximately five cycles of positive to negative pressure swings followed by short periods of normal breathing or positive pressure ventilation to allow the patient to rest. The cycles can be repeated every 10 to 15 minutes as needed.

The MI-E may be the most effective alternative for generating optimal PCEF and clearing airway secretions. PCEF has increased to as much as 6 to 10 L/s during therapy and can be increased more if a manual abdominal thrust can be synchronized with exsufflation. MI-E does not cause the airway irritation and discomfort associated with tracheal suctioning and may actually decrease the production of airway secretions. Abnormal VC values, flows, and arterial  $O_2$  saturation ( $S_aO_2$ ) values can significantly improve with clearing of mucus plugs by MI-E. No significant complications have been reported with the use of this device. However, it is contraindicated in patients with bullous emphysema or pulmonary disorders that predispose a patient to barotrauma.  $^1$ 

# TRACHEOSTOMY TUBES, SPEAKING VALVES, AND TRACHEAL BUTTONS

As mentioned, the use of TTs is an important part of long-term ventilation. When a TT is used, methods for allowing the patient to talk should also be pursued if possible. When it is time for **decannulation** (removal of the TT), the option of using a tracheal button can be evaluated.

#### **Tracheostomy Tube Selection and Benefits**

As discussed in Chapter 20, placement of a TT is essential when long-term ventilation is required. Early placement of a TT in VAIs has several advantages (Box 21.11). The type of TT used depends on the needs of patient. In patients at risk for aspiration and who are unable to speak, a cuffed tube is appropriate. For those who might aspirate but are able to speak, a specialized TT that allows for speech may be considered (see later discussion). Using a cuffless tube or deflating the cuff may promote speech for patients who have no trouble swallowing and have the ability to speak. Cuffless tubes are also recommended for children younger than 8 years. Fenestrated TTs can be used for transitioning from a cuffed tube to decannulation. However, they are not recommended for long-term use because granulomatous tissue can grow into the fenestrations. When discontinuing a TT after long-term use, a general practice is to insert progressively smaller TTs. In this way,

The use of an artificial airway for patients requiring mechanical ventilation produces sudden loss of the spoken word, which makes communication difficult. The ability to speak has a profound effect on the quality of life for VAIs.

Patients in the ICU usually attempt to communicate by mouthing words, using gestures, and nodding the head,<sup>87</sup> but for VAIs, loss of speech can make emotional adjustments to a difficult life even more challenging, leading to anxiety, fear, and depression.<sup>12</sup> The ability to communicate through speech can dramatically improve a patient's outlook on life. Although the emotional aspect of providing speech to VAIs has not been extensively studied, those who work with VAIs notice a substantial change in patients' attitudes when they are able to talk.<sup>88</sup>

For an infant requiring a TT, its use may have to be extended into the period when the child learns the skill of speaking a language. For this reason, professional evaluation of the child's language and vocal skills is important. End Children are at risk for delays in communication skills development if therapeutic intervention does not occur. End Children are at risk for delays in communication skills development if therapeutic intervention does not occur.

Various techniques and devices have been investigated that allow speech in patients with tracheostomies. This includes techniques of cuff deflation during ventilation with VC-CMV, bilevel positive pressure ventilation, and CPAP and the use of different devices that allow speech in patients who have normal-functioning oral and laryngeal structures. These devices include allowing for speech with a TT in place, electronically activated devices, self-activated pneumatic systems, speaking TTs, and one-way valves for speaking (e.g., Passy-Muir valve, Irvine, Calif.).

### **Speaking With Tracheostomy Tubes During Ventilation**

In patients who can tolerate deflation of the TT cuff during ventilation or CPAP, speech can be accomplished. For speech to occur, tracheal pressures of approximately 2 cm  $H_2O$  are required to vibrate the vocal cords and produce a quality voice. (Normal speaking pressure is 5–10 cm  $H_2O$ .)

With cuff deflation during positive pressure ventilation, air is allowed to flow around the cuff and through the vocal cords during the inspiratory cycle of the ventilator. During exhalation, with the cuff deflated, most of the exhaled air will exit the ventilator's expiratory valve and speech is interrupted. If PEEP is applied, it impedes expiratory flow through the ventilator's expiratory valve so that air flows through the larynx. This occurs because most ventilators will increase flow during exhalation to maintain the set PEEP level when a leak (deflated cuff) is present. In this way, flow may pass through the larynx during exhalation as well. In addition, by using both a longer inspiratory time ( $T_{\rm I}$ ) and PEEP, an additive effect is produced that increases speaking time and speech quality.

For patients receiving CPAP, the cuff can be deflated without substantial loss of pressure (median, 1 cm  $H_2O$  at CPAP of 7.5 or 10 cm  $H_2O$ ). This allows patients to speak without clinically significant changes in heart rate, respiratory rate, or  $S_0O_2$  levels. <sup>86</sup>

Cuff deflation of VAIs is not without potential problems. The size of the TT and its position in the airway may increase resistance of air movement and increase the patient's WOB. Additionally, if the upper airway becomes occluded, the result will be hyperinflation of the lungs, a drop in cardiac output, and possible

barotrauma. During pressure support ventilation, in which the breath is flow cycled, the cycling of the ventilator may be affected by cuff deflation and the leak that results. The CareFusion LTV series ventilator has an option of time cycling a pressure support breath, which would assist with cycling in the presence of a leak. Cuff deflation for speech is not recommended with critical care ventilators because it can affect their function.

Patients who require the use of a TT for prolonged periods may have multiple defects in the swallowing mechanism. Before a cuff is deflated to allow speech, patients need to be evaluated for the ability to swallow, protect the airway, and avoid the risk for aspiration. <sup>91,93</sup>

#### **Electrically Activated Speaking Devices**

The handheld electronic larynx allows speech when the device is held against the outside of the neck and is frequently used by patients with laryngectomies to facilitate speech. The electronic larynx produces an unnatural vocal quality, which some patients find frustrating. It also requires hand coordination, which may be difficult for some physically impaired individuals.

Electronic resonators are also available. With these devices, a small tube is placed in the mouth, which activates a resonator as the patient attempts to speak. Notice that because the tube is inside the mouth, the patient may not be able to speak clearly. 94

#### **Speaking Tracheostomy Tubes**

Three specialized TTs that allow for speech are the Portex Speaking TT (Smiths Medical, St. Paul, MN), the Pitt speaking TT (National Catheter Corp, division of Mallinckrodt, St. Louis, MO), and the voice tracheostomy tube (VTT). The Portex Speaking TT has an opening in the posterior portion above the cuff (Fig. 21.10). Through this opening an external flow of air is directed through

**Fig. 21.10** The Portex speaking tracheostomy tube. (From Hess DR, MacIntyre NR, Mishoe SC, et al.: *Respiratory care principles and practice,* Philadelphia, PA, 2002, WB Saunders.)

![](_page_19_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 21.11** A "talking" tracheostomy tube, in which gas flow to the airway is directed from an opening in the tracheostomy tube above the cuff and through the larynx when the patient obstructs the open port with the finger. (From Wilkins RL, Stoller JK, Scanlan CL: *Egan's fundamentals of respiratory care*, ed 9, St. Louis, MO, 2009, Mosby.)

the vocal cords and allows speech. The patient controls flow by covering the port on the air connection line (Fig. 21.11).

The Pitt speaking TT (Fig. 21.12) uses an extra lumen through which gas can be directed either continuously or intermittently.<sup>97</sup> The gas flows upward through the larynx and allows speech.<sup>98</sup> These specialized tubes may require flows of 6 to 8 L/min to be effective and voice quality can still be poor. In addition, the port above the cuff can become occluded during use. The added flow for talking TTs may result in throat dryness.<sup>89</sup>

The VTT cuff inflates during the inspiratory phase of positive pressure and deflates during exhalation. The VTT apparently allows patients to speak during ventilation while maintaining adequate alveolar ventilation, without aspiration and without damage to the tracheal mucosa. Additional studies may demonstrate the effectiveness of the VTT (Case Study 21.2).

#### **Tracheostomy Speaking Valves**

Speaking valves are used to allow speech in patients with a TT in place. Examples of speaking tracheostomy valves include the Passy-Muir, Shiley (Mallinckrodt, Pleasanton, CA), Shikani (The Airway Company, Forrest Hill, MD), and Montgomery (Stuart K. Montgomery, Westborough, MA). Note that the Passy-Muir is currently the only valve that has approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in line with a ventilator.

![](_page_19_Picture_10.jpeg)

Fig. 21.12 A Pitt speaking tracheostomy tube. (From Cairo JM, Pilbeam SP: Mosby's respiratory care equipment, ed 8, St. Louis, MO, 2010, Mosby.)

Speaking valves do not require a separate air source; therefore the patient does not have to occlude a valve with the finger to speak. This could be an obvious advantage for some patients. <sup>100</sup> Speaking valves have a 15-mm inner diameter connector that fits over the proximal end of any standard TT. These valves are generally connected between the TT connector and the Y-connector. <sup>100</sup>

#### Case Study 21.2

#### Patient Case—Communication Difficulty

A 74-year-old male patient is being supported by IPPV through a tracheostomy tube. The patient has a history of progressive muscular dystrophy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He is in a long-term ventilator care hospital. The patient is on IMV with a rate of 6 breaths/min,  $V_T$  of 750 mL, and PEEP of 5 cm  $H_2O$ . His  $F_1O_2$  is 0.3. He is alert and cooperative. The patient expresses frustration with his inability to communicate with his wife. What might the respiratory therapist suggest to help reduce the patient's frustration and allow him to speak?

A piece of 22-mm-diameter flexible, corrugated tubing can be placed between the speaking valve (attached to the tracheostomy connector) and ventilator's Y-connector. This may add a small amount of mechanical dead space to the circuit but can add flexibility to the circuit attachment (Fig. 21.13).

For the valve to work, the cuff of the TT must be deflated. With the Passy-Muir valve the one-way valve opens on inspiration, allowing gas to flow to the lungs. During exhalation the valve closes and air is directed to the larynx and upper airway (Key Point 21.4). The Passy-Muir valve has been shown to improve speech flow, reduce speech hesitancy, and increase speech time. <sup>102</sup> The Passy-Muir valve has been shown to reduce aspiration during swallowing. <sup>103-106</sup>

**Key Point** 21.4 A heat-moisture exchanger (HME) should not be used when a Passy-Muir valve or similar device is used. Expired gas must pass through the heat-moisture exchanger for it to function properly.

Speaking valves can be used on ventilator-dependent patients or spontaneously breathing patients with TTs. They can be used to help wean patients from TTs by allowing them to adjust to air moving through the upper airway again (Key Point 21.5). When using a speaking valve for the first time, the patient should be evaluated to ensure no untoward side effects occur. For example, if the space between the TT and tracheal wall does not allow adequate exhalation, or if the tracheostomy is in place because of tracheal stenosis, the patient may be unable to exhale effectively. This can lead to air trapping and hyperinflation of the lungs with the potential complications of pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema.<sup>89</sup> One method to test for air trapping is to remove the speaking valve and listen for a "puff" of air. The "puff" may occur as air that could not be exhaled through the mouth passes through the TT.89 On the other hand, airway pressures may increase because of exhalation through the oropharynx, which causes a low level of PEEP. This may allow the readjustment of the set PEEP. If peak pressures rise

**EXEMPTIAL SET :** A child with a TT in place should never be left unattended when a speaking valve is in place.<sup>89</sup>

above allowable limits, however, the valve needs to be immediately removed.  $^{107}$  Initial evaluation of valve placement includes checking respiratory rate, heart rate,  $S_pO_2$ , changes in respiratory pattern or effort, increased coughing, increased peak pressures, and expressions of patient discomfort.

Before a speaking valve is attached to a ventilated patient, the following steps are performed:

- The upper airway and pharyngeal area above the cuff and trachea are suctioned.
- 2. Peak inspiratory pressure and  $V_T$  are checked.
- 3. The TT cuff is deflated.
- 4. The  $V_T$  setting may need to be increased to maintain adequate ventilation.
- 5. The peak pressure alarm and disconnect alarms are adjusted.
- The patient's heart rate, respiratory rate, S<sub>p</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, effectiveness of cough, passage of air into the oral cavity, and subjective expression of comfort are monitored.<sup>101</sup>

If the cuff is deflated during mechanical ventilation, some air will leak. For patients who depend on a set volume delivery, the  $V_T$  setting can be increased. Activation of the peak pressure alarm may indicate poor exhalation (through the mouth) and buildup of pressure. Water condensate from the ventilator circuit can obstruct the valve. The volume must be readjusted and the cuff reinflated when a speaking valve is removed to avoid overinflation or hyperventilation. After use, ventilator parameters should be rechecked and the patient assessed. Currently the Puritan Bennett 760 ventilator has a speaking valve setup to accommodate the use of a speaking valve.  $^{108}$ 

Patients have reported feeling better and more motivated about their own care when a speaking valve is used. This is illustrated in the following Clinical Scenario.  $^{100,109}$ 

From Ellison B, Ellison J: *The Brooke Ellison story*, New York, 2001, Hyperion.

# Clinical Scenario: A Patient's Experience With the Passy-Muir Valve

Brooke Ellison is a young woman who is quadriplegic and ventilator dependent. She presented an inspiring lecture during the American Association for Respiratory Care's 50th Anniversary International Congress in New Orleans, La. In part of her presentation she mentioned her first opportunity to speak, although she has a TT. This is an excerpt from the book *The Brooke Ellison Story* with her mother, Jean Ellison:

"When can we start weaning Brooke off the ventilator?" I asked the RT when he arrived to change Brooke's ventilator tubing. "We'll be working on that," he said, but in a way that seemed to indicate that it was not on his list of priorities as it was on

"What do you think about trying to speak, Brooke?" He asked, in a way that I couldn't tell whether he was just making conversation or whether he knew something that I didn't know.

"What?" Ed (Brooke's father) said, not really sure of what he had just heard.

"Would you like to speak, Brooke?" he asked again, pulling a small circular piece of blue plastic out of his pocket and holding it up for us all to see.

"What's that?" I asked.

"It's a Passy-Muir valve," he said.

"A what?" Ed asked again, not really understanding what he was saving.

"It's a Passy-Muir valve. We can put it in Brooke's ventilator tube to redirect her exhaled air over her vocal cords and, as a result, allow her to speak. Would you like to try it, Brooke?" he said.

Brooke, in excited disbelief, moved her lips and said, "Yes."
"How does it feel?" I said, after the RT fit it in her tube.
Brooke stared back and didn't say anything. She looked scared and confused as if she had forgotten how to speak.

"Brooke, Love, can you say something?" Ed said anxiously.

After a long pause, Brooke said: "This . . . feels . . . weird," in a raspy, breathy voice.

She wasn't used to how it worked, so each word she spoke came out slowly, separated by a breath or two from her ventilator. Ed and I looked at each other and started to cry.

"I . . . sound . . . that . . . bad?" she asked in the same raspy, staccato voice when she saw us crying.

"Oh, my God, no," I said. "It's the most beautiful sound I've ever heard."

#### **Concerns With Speaking Tubes and Valves**

Some precautions are needed with speaking valves. The cuff must be deflated when it is attached. Whenever a cuff is deflated, regardless of the reason, an increased risk for aspiration may exist. Increased resistance to breathing through the valve, the TT, or between the tube and the wall of the trachea may occur during spontaneous breathing and speech. If more than  $10 \text{ cm } H_2O$  of pressure is required for the patient to generate a breath through the tube, WOB may dramatically increase.

Supplemental  $O_2$  may be required when using speaking tubes if a significant amount of room air is entrained and the  $S_pO_2$  of the patient decreases. Speaking devices may be contraindicated in the following circumstances<sup>89</sup>:

- · Comatose or unconscious patient
- · Foam cuff in place or cuff that must remain inflated
- · Increased or thick secretions
- Severe upper airway obstruction
- Increased airway resistance and increased compliance that may cause air trapping (e.g., COPD)
- Endotracheal tube in place (not TT)
- Reduced lung compliance
- · Laryngeal and pharyngeal dysfunction

#### **Tracheal Buttons and Decannulation**

The need to constantly keep a TT in place may eventually end. When concerns exist about a patient's ability to tolerate decannulation, the procedure is best observed on an inpatient basis. This can be done in a nonacute care setting. However, a nurse, respiratory therapist, and physician should be immediately available during the procedure. The airway is inspected to ensure the airway lumen is of an appropriate size and is not affected by scarring, narrowing, or obstruction. This can be accomplished with a flexible fiberoptic endoscope.

A protocol can be used that progressively downsizes the TT. The patient is observed during the size reduction process to be sure it is tolerated. Eventually the tube is capped. Once capping of the tube is well tolerated, the tube can be removed and the tracheotomy wound covered with an occlusive dressing. Most of the time the tracheotomy wound will heal without further intervention.

Occasionally a stoma must be maintained because the patient will require additional surgical procedures, such as head, neck, or maxillofacial surgery. The stoma can be kept patent by using a tracheal button. Tracheal buttons may be used to preserve the site for patients with OSA treated by tracheotomy.<sup>78,110</sup> The button consists of two pieces, a hollow inner cannula and an external cap (Fig. 21.14). The inner cannula fits between the outside of the patient's neck and inside of the trachea. To determine the appropriate depth before insertion, a toothpick-sized measuring device, which resembles a small golf club, is used to determine the depth of insertion of the cannula. The short L-shaped end is inserted in the stoma and hooked on the edge of the trachea. The clinician then places a gloved fingertip at the outside edge of the measuring device to mark the external point at the neck and then unhooks the distal end from the edge of the tracheal wall and removes the device. The distance from the fingertip to the end of the instrument is the cannula depth needed. To adjust cannula size, various rings can be added to the outer (proximal) part of the cannula. The cannula is then inserted. This is followed by placement of the cap. When the cap is inserted all the way, the flanges at the distal end of the cannula flare outward, locking the button in

(*A,* From Cairo JM: *Mosby's respiratory care equipment,* ed 9, St. Louis, MO, 2014, Mosby. *B,* From Kacmarek RM, Stoller JK, Heuer AJ: *Egan's fundamentals of respiratory care,* ed 10, St. Louis, MO, 2013, Mosby.)

place inside the trachea. It is recommended that the button be rotated approximately one-quarter turn daily to prevent tissue growth into the flange. A 15-mm adaptor is available to allow manual bag ventilation if needed.

Most patients will be anxious about removal of the TT. They are usually concerned about their ability to breathe, clear secretions, and protect their airway when the TT is no longer in place. <sup>110</sup> These concerns need to be addressed and the procedure performed in a safe and comfortable environment.

# ANCILLARY EQUIPMENT AND EQUIPMENT CLEANING FOR HOME MECHANICAL VENTILATION

In addition to the mechanical ventilator, a patient ventilated at home requires various supplies for general daily care, including supplies for airway care, humidification, supplemental O<sub>2</sub>, disposable circuits, and an emergency backup ventilator. The type and quantity of medical equipment necessary in the home depend on the patient's clinical status, age, and mode of mechanical ventilation. Patients receiving mechanical ventilation through noninvasive methods obviously require less equipment than patients with tracheostomies requiring continuous invasive mechanical ventilation. Box 21.7 lists the potential equipment and supplies that may be necessary for patients requiring continuous ventilatory support.

#### **Disinfection Procedures**

The presence of an artificial airway in a compromised ventilatorassisted patient makes the potential for infection from contaminated equipment a risk in the home setting, so infection control and decontamination procedures are taught to all persons involved in caring for the patient at home. Infection control measures emphasize avoiding person-to-person and object-to-person contamination. Family members and other caregivers are instructed to wash their hands thoroughly before and after touching the patient or equipment. The use of gloves (nonsterile) is encouraged when performing tasks such as suctioning or tracheostomy care. <sup>111</sup>

#### **Ventilator Circuit Disinfection**

As previously discussed, when circuits are changed less frequently, the risk for VAP decreases. The National Center for Infectious Diseases suggests that circuits need not be changed unless they are nonfunctional or if they are visibly soiled with secretions or blood. In Changing the circuit less frequently is also less costly. The rates of VAP in long-term ventilated patients in long-term acute care hospitals and the home environment have been reported to be much lower compared with VAP rates in acute care facilities when national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines are followed. In the National Center of the National Center of CDC guidelines are followed.

When equipment is to be cleaned, it is first disassembled and rinsed with tap water. Then it is washed in a mixture of lukewarm water and mild detergent to remove all foreign matter. It is then rinsed thoroughly with tap water. The parts are soaked in an effective disinfectant solution for approximately 10 minutes. Finally, it is rinsed thoroughly, air-dried, and placed in a plastic bag. Ideally a patient should have at least three circuits so that one can be in use while the other is being disinfected and the third drying.

Because Medicare does not reimburse for most disposable supplies or will reimburse for only a limited number of disposable supplies, many homecare patients are taught to clean and reuse supplies when possible. Suction catheters, for instance, are often cleaned and reused in the home. This is safe as long as the procedure for cleaning is followed carefully (Box 21.12). The American Association for Respiratory Care

### **BOX 21.12 Procedure for Reusing Suction Catheters**

- Wash two plastic containers in warm water and detergent solution. Rinse them under running water and soak in disinfectant solution for 10 minutes. Allow to air-dry. Store one container for later use and use the second container to store suction catheters between uses.
- After a suction procedure is completed, tap water should be aspirated through the catheter to clear the inside. The outside of the catheter is wiped with a clean gauze or sponge.
- The catheter is disconnected from the connecting tubing and placed inside the plastic container. The lid is then closed.
- Catheters are removed from the container, to be reused as needed.
- 5. The catheter and plastic container are changed after 8 hours of use.
- The dirty catheter is rinsed with cold tap water to remove all mucus.
- The catheter is washed with a solution of warm water and detergent, rinsed under running water, and the excess water shaken off.
- 8. The catheter is then soaked in disinfectant solution for a minimum of 10 minutes.
- 9. Afterward, the catheter is removed, rinsed, and air-dried on a clean paper towel.
- 10. After drying the catheter completely, it is placed in a plastic bag and closed until ready for use.
- 11. The procedure in step 1 is followed to clean and disinfect the plastic container.

provides a clinical practice guideline for suctioning of the patient in the home.  $^{111}$ 

White vinegar mixed with distilled water (acetic acid content of 1.25%) is an adequate disinfectant solution but should be discarded after use and not reused. Activated glutaraldehydes and quaternary ammonium compounds can also be used at home following manufacturer's recommendations. Although these may be the disinfectant solutions of choice, their cost and availability are limiting factors. Whatever method is used, equipment must be processed in a clean, dry space separate from food preparation areas.

Water to be used as a diluent or in humidifiers needs to be boiled for 30 minutes and stored in a sterile container in a refrigerator. After 24 hours, the water should be discarded. Box 21.13 reviews a procedure for cleaning ventilator-related equipment in the home.

#### **Humidifiers**

The CDC recommends the use of sterile water in the humidifier used for long-term ventilation. Because heated humidifiers are often used, condensate will normally build in the circuit. The condensate can pool in the dependent limbs of the circuit and make it difficult to both trigger the ventilator into inspiration and exhale. For this reason, the condensate should be removed from the circuit regularly. When handling the circuit, efforts must be made to avoid accidentally allowing circuit condensate to spill into the patient's airway. <sup>11</sup>, <sup>116</sup>

### SUMMARY

- LTMV is required by two categories of patients: those recovering from an acute illness and those with chronic progressive disorders.
- The overall goal of LTMV at home or other alternative care sites is to improve the patient's quality of life.
- LTMV can be administered in acute care units, intermediate care facilities, and long-term care sites, including the home environment.
- Discharging VAIs to the home or an alternative care site is a complex process that involves careful patient selection, adequate financial resources, a knowledgeable and dedicated health care team, and a patient and family willing and able to take the responsibility for self-care management at home.
- The respiratory therapist assumes a large responsibility for selecting and placing primary and ancillary equipment, evaluating the home or alternative care site, coordinating inhospital training of patients and caregivers, assisting in patient discharge and transfer, and following up with continuing care.
- Many types and models of ventilators are available for home use. Some of these are quite sophisticated, offering an array of modes, alarm systems, and other complex ventilatory characteristics.
- The most important factors in choosing a ventilator are its reliability, safety, versatility, whether its controls are easy to understand and manipulate, and whether it can be easy to cycle in the VC-CMV mode for patients with some spontaneous effort.
- The pulmonary, cardiovascular, and GI problems in VAIs are similar, in many respects, to those seen in critically ill patients on ventilation.

- In addition to the mechanical ventilator, a patient undergoing ventilation at home requires various supplies for general daily care, including supplies for airway care, humidification, supplemental O2, disposable circuits, and an emergency backup ventilator.
- Perhaps one of the more important roles that the respiratory therapist must fill when caring for patients receiving LTMV is that of an educator. The ability to teach the patient and caregivers how to use the equipment properly and safely and
- alleviate the patient's fears and apprehension of ongoing care and emergency management is essential to the success of any home mechanical ventilation program.
- LTMV in the home environment is more likely to be successful when the patient and family are highly motivated, maintain hope, and communicate effectively.
- This increased awareness of the effectiveness of LTMV suggests that it is a desirable method of managing patients requiring long-term ventilatory support. 124
