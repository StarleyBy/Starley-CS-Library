linicians caring for critically ill patients receiving ventilatory support must have a basic understanding of the principles of operation of mechanical ventilators. This understanding should focus on patient-ventilator interactions (i.e., how the ventilator interacts with the patient's breathing pattern and how the patient's lung condition can affect the ventilator's performance). Many different types of ventilators are available for adult, pediatric, and neonatal care in hospitals; for patient transport; and for home care. Mastering the complexities of each of these devices may seem overwhelming at times. Fortunately, ventilators have a number of properties in common, which allow them to be described and grouped accordingly.

An excellent way to gain an overview of a particular ventilator is to study how it functions. Part of the problem with this approach, however, is that the terminology used by manufacturers and authors varies considerably. The purpose of this chapter is to address these terminology differences and provide an overview of ventilator function as it relates to current standards.<sup>1-3</sup> It does not

attempt to review all available ventilators. For models not covered in this discussion, the reader should consult other texts and the literature provided by the manufacturer.<sup>3</sup> The description of the "hardware" components of mechanical ventilators presented in this chapter should provide clinicians with a better understanding of the principles of operation of these devices.

# HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE ON VENTILATOR CLASSIFICATION

The earliest commercially available ventilators used in the clinical setting (e.g., Mörch, Emerson Post-Op) were developed in the 1950s and 1960s. These devices were classified originally according to a system developed by Mushin and colleagues. Technological advances made during the past 50 years have dramatically changed the way ventilators operate, and these changes required an updated approach to ventilator classification. The following discussion is

based on an updated classification system proposed by Chatburn.<sup>1</sup> Chatburn's approach to classifying ventilators uses engineering and clinical principles to describe ventilator function.<sup>2</sup> Although this classification system provides a good foundation for discussing various aspects of mechanical ventilation, many clinicians still rely on the earlier classification system to describe basic ventilator operation. Both classification systems are referenced when necessary in the following discussion to describe the principles of operation of commonly used mechanical ventilators.

#### INTERNAL FUNCTION

A ventilator probably can be easily understood if it is pictured as a "black box." The ventilator is plugged into an electrical outlet or a high-pressure gas source, and gas comes out the other side and is delivered to the patient. The person who operates the ventilator inputs settings using a touch panel or dials on a control panel (user interface) to establish the pressure and pattern of gas flow delivered by the machine. Inside the ventilator, a control system interprets the operator's settings and produces and regulates the desired output. In the discussion that follows, specific characteristics of the various components of a typical commercially available mechanical ventilator are discussed. Box 2.1 provides a summary of the major components of a ventilator.

#### **POWER SOURCE OR INPUT POWER**

The ventilator's power source provides the energy that enables the machine to perform the work of ventilating the patient. As discussed in Chapter 1, ventilation can be achieved using either positive or negative pressure. The power used by a mechanical ventilator to generate this positive or negative pressure may be provided by an electrical or pneumatic (compressed gas)

#### **Electrically Powered Ventilators**

Electrically powered ventilators rely entirely on electricity from a standard electrical outlet (110-115 V, 60-Hz alternating current in the United States; higher voltages [220 V, 50 Hz] in other countries), or a rechargeable battery (direct current) may be used.

#### BOX **2.1** Components of a Ventilator

  - a. Electrically powered ventilators
  - b. Pneumatically powered ventilators
- 2. Positive or negative pressure generator
- 3. Control systems and circuits
  - a. Open-loop and closed-loop systems to control ventilator function

  - c. Pneumatic circuit
- 4. Power transmission and conversion system
  - a. Volume displacement, pneumatic designs
  - b. Flow-control valves
- 5. Output (pressure, volume, and flow waveforms)

Battery power is typically used for a short period, such as for transporting a ventilated patient, or in homecare therapy as a backup power source if the home's electricity fails.

An on/off switch controls the main electrical power source. The electricity provides the energy to operate motors, electromagnets, potentiometers, rheostats, and microprocessors, which, in turn, control the timing mechanisms for inspiration and expiration, gas flow, and alarm systems. Electrical power also may be used to operate devices such as fans, bellows, solenoids, and transducers. All these devices help ensure a controlled pressure and gas flow to the patient. Examples of electrically powered and controlled ventilators are listed in Box 2.2.

## **Pneumatically Powered Ventilators**

Current-generation intensive care unit (ICU) ventilators are typically pneumatically powered devices. These machines use one or two 50-psi gas sources and have built-in internal reducing valves so that the operating pressure is lower than the source pressure.

Pneumatically powered ventilators are classified according to the mechanism used to control gas flow. Two types of devices are available: pneumatic ventilators and fluidic ventilators. Pneumatic ventilators use needle valves, Venturi entrainers (injectors), flexible diaphragms, and spring-loaded valves to control flow, volume delivery, and inspiratory and expiratory function (Fig. 2.1). The Bird Mark 7 ventilator, which was originally used for prolonged mechanical ventilation, is often cited as an example of a pneumatic ventilator. These devices also have been used to administer intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB) treatments. IPPB treatments involve the delivery of aerosolized medications to spontaneously breathing patients with reduced ventilatory function (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients).

Fluidic ventilators rely on special principles to control gas flow, specifically the principles of wall attachment (i.e., Coanda effect) and beam deflection. Fig. 2.2 shows the basic components and summary of the principle of operation for a fluidic system. An example of a ventilator that uses fluidic control circuits is the Bio-Med MVP-10. (Fluidic circuits are analogous to electronic logic circuits.) Fluidic systems are occasionally used to provide ventilation to patients in the acute care setting.3

Most pneumatically powered ICU ventilators also have an electrical power source incorporated into their design to energize a computer that controls the ventilator functions. Notice that the gas sources, mixtures of air and oxygen, supply the power for ventilator function and allow for a variable fractional inspired oxygen concentration (F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). The electrical power is required for operation of the computer microprocessor, which controls capacitors, solenoids, and electrical switches that regulate the phasing of inspiration and expiration, and the monitoring of gas flow. The ventilator's preprogrammed ventilator modes are stored in the microprocessor's read-only memory, which can be updated rapidly by installing new software programs. Random access memory,

**Key Point 2.1** Pneumatically powered, microprocessor-controlled ventilators rely on pneumatic power (i.e., the 50-psi gas sources) to provide the energy to deliver the breath. Electrical power from an alternating current wall-socket or from a direct-current battery power source provides the energy for a computer microprocessor that controls the internal function of the machine.

around the body surface ( $P_{bs}$ ). With positive pressure ventilators, gas flows into the lung because the ventilator establishes a pressure gradient by generating a positive pressure at the airway opening (Fig. 2.3A). In contrast, a negative pressure ventilator generates a negative pressure at the body surface that is transmitted to the pleural space and then to the alveoli (see Fig. 2.3B).

### Case Study 2.1

#### **Ventilator Selection**

A patient who requires continuous ventilatory support is being transferred from the intensive care unit to a general care patient room. The general care hospital rooms are equipped with piped-in oxygen but not piped-in air. What type of ventilator would you select for this patient?

which is also incorporated into the ventilator's central processing unit, is used for temporary storage of data, such as pressure and flow measurements and airway resistance and compliance (Key Point 2.1).

Case Study 2.1 provides an exercise in selecting a ventilator with a specific power source.

## **Positive and Negative Pressure Ventilators**

As discussed in Chapter 1, gas flow into the lungs can be accomplished by using two different methods of changing the transrespiratory pressure gradient (pressure at the airway opening minus pressure at the body surface  $[P_{awo}-P_{bs}]$ ). A ventilator can change the transrespiratory pressure gradient by altering either the pressure applied at the airway opening  $(P_{awo})$  or the pressure

## **CONTROL SYSTEMS AND CIRCUITS**

The control system (control circuit), or the decision-making system that regulates ventilator function internally, can use mechanical or electrical devices, electronics, pneumatics, fluidics, or a combination of these.

# Open-Loop and Closed-Loop Systems to Control Ventilator Function

Advances in microprocessor technology have allowed ventilator manufacturers to develop a new generation of ventilators that use feedback loop systems. Most ventilators that are *not* microprocessor controlled are called **open-loop systems**. The operator sets a control (e.g., tidal volume), and the ventilator delivers that volume to the patient circuit. This is called an open-loop system because the ventilator cannot be programmed to respond to changing conditions. If gas leaks out of the patient circuit (and therefore does not reach the patient), the ventilator cannot adjust its function to correct for the leakage. It simply delivers a set volume and does not measure or change it (Fig. 2.4A).

Closed-loop systems are often described as "intelligent" systems because they compare the set control variable with the measured control variable, which in turn allows the ventilator to respond to changes in the patient's condition. For example, some closed-loop systems are programmed to compare the tidal volume setting with the measured tidal volume exhaled by the patient. If the two differ, the control system can alter the volume delivery (see Fig. 2.4B).<sup>5-7</sup>

**Fig. 2.2** Basic components of fluid logic (fluidic) pneumatic mechanisms. (A) Example of a flip-flop valve (beam deflection). When a continuous pressure source (P<sub>S</sub> at inlet A) enters, wall attachment occurs and the output is established (O<sub>2</sub>). A control signal (single gas pulse) from C<sub>1</sub> deflects the beam to outlet O<sub>1</sub>. (B) The wall attachment phenomenon, or *Coandă effect*, is demonstrated. A turbulent jet flow causes a localized drop in lateral pressure and draws in air (figure on left). When a wall is adjacent, a low-pressure vortex bubble (separation bubble) is created and bends the jet toward the wall (figure on right). (From Dupuis YG: *Ventilators: theory and clinical applications*, ed 2, St. Louis, MO, 1992, Mosby.)

Mandatory minute ventilation is a good example of a closed-loop system. The operator selects a minimum minute ventilation setting that is lower than the patient's spontaneous minute ventilation. The ventilator monitors the patient's spontaneous minute ventilation, and if it falls below the operator's set value, the ventilator increases its output to meet the minimum set minute ventilation (Critical Care Concept 2.1).

### **Control Panel (User Interface)**

The control panel, or *user interface*, is located on the surface of the ventilator and is monitored and set by the ventilator operator. The internal control system reads and uses the operator's settings to control the function of the drive mechanism. The control panel has various knobs or touch pads for setting components, such as

![](_page_3_Picture_8.jpeg)

#### **CRITICAL CARE CONCEPT 2.1**

#### **Open-Loop or Closed-Loop**

A ventilator is programmed to monitor  $S_pO_2$ . If the  $S_pO_2$  drops below 90% for longer than 30 seconds, the ventilator is programmed to activate an audible alarm that cannot be silenced and a flashing red visual alarm. The ventilator is also programmed to increase the oxygen percentage to 100% until the alarms have been answered and deactivated. Is this a closed-loop or an open-loop system? What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of using this type of system?

![](_page_4_Picture_3.jpeg)

Fig. 2.3 (A) Application of positive pressure at the airway provides a pressure gradient between the mouth and the alveoli; as a result, gas flows into the lungs. (B) As subatmospheric pressure is applied around the chest wall, pressure drops in the alveoli and air flows into the lungs.

**Fig. 2.4** (A) Open-loop system. (B) Closed-loop system using tidal volume as the measured parameter.

tidal volume, rate, inspiratory time, alarms, and  $F_{102}$  (Fig. 2.5). These controls ultimately regulate four ventilatory variables: flow, volume, pressure, and time. The value for each of these can vary within a wide range, and the manufacturer provides a list of the potential ranges for each variable. For example, tidal volume may range from 200 to 2000 mL on an adult ventilator. The operator also can set alarms to respond to changes in a variety of monitored variables, particularly high and low pressure and low volume. (Alarm settings are discussed in more detail in Chapter 7.)

#### **Pneumatic Circuit**

A pneumatic circuit, or pathway, is a series of tubes that allow gas to flow inside the ventilator and between the ventilator and patient. The pressure gradient created by the ventilator with its power source generates the flow of gas. This gas flows through the pneumatic circuit en route to the patient. The gas first is directed from the generating source inside the ventilator through the internal pneumatic circuit to the ventilator's outside surface. Gas then flows through an external circuit, or patient circuit, into the patient's lungs. Exhaled gas passes through the expiratory limb of the external circuit and to the atmosphere through an exhalation valve.

#### **Internal Pneumatic Circuit**

If the ventilator's internal circuit allows the gas to flow directly from its power source to the patient, the machine is called a **single-circuit ventilator** (Fig. 2.6). The source of the gas may be either externally compressed gas or an internal pressurizing source, such as a compressor. Most ICU ventilators manufactured today are classified as single-circuit ventilators.

Another type of internal pneumatic circuit ventilator is the **double-circuit ventilator**. In these machines, the primary power source generates a gas flow that compresses a mechanism such as a *bellows* or "bag-in-a-chamber." The gas in the bellows or bag then

**Fig. 2.7** Double-circuit ventilator. An electrical compressor produces a high-pressure gas source, which is directed into a chamber that holds a collapsible bellows. The bellows contains the desired gas mixture for the patient. The pressure from the compressor forces the bellows upward, resulting in a positive pressure breath (A). After delivery of the inspiratory breath, the compressor stops directing pressure into the bellows chamber and exhalation occurs. The bellows drops to its original position and fills with the gas mixture in preparation for the next breath (B).

flows to the patient. Fig. 2.7 illustrates the principle of operation of a double-circuit ventilator (Key Point 2.2).

#### **External Pneumatic Circuit**

The external pneumatic circuit, or patient circuit, connects the ventilator to the patient's artificial airway. This circuit must have several basic elements to provide a positive pressure breath (Box 2.3). Fig. 2.8 shows examples of two types of patient circuits. During inspiration, the expiratory valve closes so that gas can flow only into the patient's lungs.

In early-generation ventilators (e.g., the Bear 3), the exhalation valve was mounted in the main exhalation line of the patient

## BOX 2.3 Basic Elements of a Patient Circuit

- 1. Main inspiratory line: Connects the ventilator output to the patient's airway adapter or connector
- 2. *Adapter:* Connects the main inspiratory line to the patient's airway (also called a *patient adapter* or *Y-connector* because of its shape)
- 3. Expiratory line: Delivers expired gas from the patient to the exhalation valve
- 4. Expiratory valve: Allows the release of exhaled gas from the expiratory line into the room air

circuit (see Fig. 2.8A). With this arrangement, an expiratory valve charge line, which powers the expiratory valve, also must be present. When the ventilator begins inspiratory gas flow through the main inspiratory tube, gas also flows through the charge line, closing the valve (see Fig. 2.8A). During exhalation, the flow from the ventilator stops, the charge line depressurizes, and the exhalation valve opens. Then the patient is able to exhale passively through the expiratory port. In most current ICU ventilators, the exhalation valve is located inside the ventilator and is not visible (see Fig. 2.8B). A mechanical device, such as a solenoid valve, typically is used to control these internally mounted exhalation valves (see the section on flow valves later in this chapter).

Fig. 2.9 illustrates the various components typically included in a patient's circuit to optimize gas delivery and ventilator function. The most common adjuncts are shown in Box 2.4. Additional monitoring devices include graphic display screens, oxygen analyzers, pulse oximeters, capnographs (end-tidal  $\rm CO_2$  monitors), and flow and pressure sensors for monitoring lung compliance and airway resistance (for more detail about monitoring devices, see Chapter 10).

# POWER TRANSMISSION AND CONVERSION SYSTEM

A ventilator's power source enables it to perform mechanical or pneumatic operations. The internal hardware that accomplishes the conversion of electrical or pneumatic energy into the mechanical energy required to deliver a breath to the patient is called the *power transmission and conversion system*. It consists of a **drive mechanism** and an output control mechanism.

The drive mechanism is a mechanical device that produces gas flow to the patient. An example of a drive mechanism is a piston powered by an electrical motor. The output control consists of one or more valves that regulate gas flow to the patient. From an engineering perspective, power transmission and conversion systems can be categorized as volume controllers or flow controllers.<sup>2,7</sup>

## **Compressors (Blowers)**

An appreciation of how volume and flow controllers operate requires an understanding of compressors, or blowers. Compressors reduce internal volumes (compression) within the ventilator to generate a positive pressure required to deliver gas to the patient. Compressors may be piston driven, or they may use rotating blades (vanes), moving diaphragms, or bellows. Hospitals use large, pistontype, water-cooled compressors to supply wall gas outlets, which

**Fig. 2.8** Basic components of a patient circuit that are required for a positive pressure breath. (A) Ventilator circuit with an externally mounted expiratory valve. The cutaway shows a balloon-type expiratory valve. During inspiration, gas fills the balloon and closes a hole in the expiratory valve. Closing of the hole makes the patient circuit a sealed system. During expiration, the balloon deflates, the hole opens, and gas from the patient is exhaled into the room through the hole. (B) Ventilator circuit with an internally mounted exhalation valve.

many ventilators use as a power source. Some ventilators (e.g., Maquet Servo-i) have built-in compressors that can be used to power the ventilator if a wall gas outlet is not available.

## BOX 2.4 Adjuncts Used With a Patient Circuit

\*Usually built into the ventilator.

### **Volume Displacement Designs**

Volume displacement devices include bellows, pistons, concertina bags, and bag-in-a-chamber systems.<sup>7,8</sup> Box 2.5 provides a brief

## **BOX 2.5** Examples of Volume Displacement Devices

#### **Spring-Loaded Bellows**

In a spring-loaded bellows model, an adjustable spring atop a bellows applies a force per unit area, or pressure (P = Force/Area). Tightening of the spring creates greater force and therefore greater pressure. The bellows contains preblended gas (air and oxygen), which is administered to the patient. The Servo 900C ventilator is an example of a ventilator that uses a spring-loaded bellows (pressure of up to 120 cm  $H_2O$ ). Although these devices are no longer manufactured, it is worth noting because of their importance in the development of modern mechanical ventilators.

#### **Linear Drive Piston**

In a linear drive device, an electrical motor is connected by a special gearing mechanism to a piston rod or arm. The rod moves the piston forward inside a cylinder housing in a linear fashion at a constant rate. Some high-frequency ventilators use linear or direct drive pistons. Incorporating a rolling seal or using low-resistance materials has helped eliminate the friction that occurred with early piston/cylinder designs. The Puritan Bennett 760 ventilator is an example of a linear drive piston device.

![](_page_8_Picture_11.jpeg)

#### **Rotary Drive Piston**

This type of drive mechanism is called a *rotary drive*, a *nonlinear drive*, or an *eccentric drive* piston. An electric motor rotates a drive wheel. The resulting flow pattern is slow at the beginning of inspiration, achieves highest speed at midinspiration, and tapers off at endinspiration. This pattern is called a *sine* (sinusoidal) *waveform*. The Puritan Bennett Companion 2801 ventilator, which is used in home care, has this type of piston.

description of the principle of operation for each of these devices and examples of ventilators that use these mechanisms.

#### **Volume Flow-Control Valves**

Current ICU ventilators use flow-control valves to regulate gas flow to the patient. These flow-control valves operate by opening and closing either completely or in small increments. These valves, which are driven by various motor-based mechanisms, have a rapid response time and great flexibility in flow control. Flow-control valves include proportional solenoid valves and digital valves with on/off configurations.

A proportional solenoid valve can be designed with various configurations to modify gas flow. A typical valve incorporates a gate or plunger, a valve seat, an electromagnet, a diaphragm, a spring, and two electrical contacts (Fig. 2.10). Electric current flows through the electromagnet and creates a magnetic field, which pulls the plunger and opens the valve. The amount of current flowing through the electromagnet influences the strength of the magnetic field; the strength of the field determines the position of the plunger, or *armature*. The design of the plunger can vary from ventilator to ventilator.

Solenoids can be controlled by electrical timers or microprocessors, manual operation, and pressure. With electrical timers and microprocessors, electric current passes to the electromagnet and opens the valve. Manual operation closes a switch, sending a current to the electromagnet and opening the valve. Pressure changes generated by a patient's inspiratory effort can cause a diaphragm to move, closing an electrical contact and opening or closing the valve. Examples of ventilators with this type of valve include Medtronic PB 840/980, the Hamilton G5 (Hamilton Medical), the Dräger Evita Infinity V500, and the Servo-i (Getinge).

In the digital on/off valve configuration, several valves operate together. Each valve is either open or closed (Fig. 2.11). A particular valve produces a certain flow by controlling the opening

and closing of a specifically sized orifice. The amount of flow varies depending on which valves are open. The Infant Star ventilator used this type of valve configuration.

![](_page_9_Picture_14.jpeg)

**Fig. 2.10** Proportional solenoid valve, a type of flow control valve. In this design an electric current, which can be controlled, flows through the coil, creating a magnetic field. The strength of the magnetic field causes the armature to assume a specified position. With the armature and valve poppet physically connected, this assembly is the only moving part. Coil and armature designs vary, as do strategies for fixing the position of the poppet. (Redrawn from Sanborn WG: Microprocessor-based mechanical ventilation, *Respir Care* 38:72—109, 1993.)

**Fig. 2.11** Digital on/off valve, another type of pneumatic flow control valve. With each valve controlling a critical orifice and thus a specified flow, the number of discrete flow steps (including zero) becomes  $2^n$  (where n = number of valves). (Redrawn from Sanborn WG: Microprocessor-based mechanical ventilation, *Respir Care* 38:72—109, 1993.)

- The major components of a mechanical ventilator include a high-pressure gas source, a control panel (user interface) to establish the pressure and pattern of gas flow delivered by the machine, and a control system that interprets the operator's settings and produces and regulates the desired output.
- Ventilator power sources may operate on electrical or pneumatic (gas) power. Electrically powered ventilators may rely on an alternating current wall outlet or a direct current source, such as a battery. Pneumatically powered ventilators are classified as pneumatic ventilators and fluidic ventilators. Pneumatically powered, microprocessor-controlled ventilators use compressed gas input power to drive inspiration and use electrical power to control the breath characteristics.
