# **Heart failure resistant to standard medical therapy**

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Introduction</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Decompensated heart failure (DHF) is common. The majority of patients with DHF respond well to standard medical therapy, however some do not, experiencing worsening signs and symptoms. This chapter will focus on the assessment and general management of patients where standard medical therapy is failing and more advanced options are required. These are intravenous inotropic therapy, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) counter-pulsation, ultrafiltration, formal mechanical circulatory support (MCS), and/or cardiac transplantation. Further information on these specific strategies will be found in respective individual chapters.

<summary>Presentation</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Heart failure may be new or an exacerbation of chronic disease. The clinical syndrome is characterized by breathlessness associated with accumulation of fluid within the lung's interstitial and alveolar spaces resulting from elevated cardiac filling pressures. Other organ dysfunction may be present and the patient may be hypotensive (cardiogenic shock). HF is most commonly due to LV systolic or diastolic dysfunction; other cardiac abnormalities may also exist such as coronary artery or valvular disease.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Specialist versus non-specialist care</summary>
<div class="details-content">

The recognition and management of patients refractory to standard medical care is challenging and ideally such patients are best managed in specialized CICUs which can provide a full range of options. However, most patients will present to more generalist units and be managed outside intensive care. The identification of the at-risk subgroup, the decision to refer, and the timing of transfer are crucial. Early consultation with specialist units should be encouraged, if possible as part of a formal clinical network and underpinned by formal protocols and good clinical relationships.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Factors which may precipitate decompensation</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Patient compliance
- Acute medical condition, e.g. lower respiratory tract infection
- Delay in diagnosing DHF
- Arrhythmia, for example, AF or ventricular tachycardia
- Fluid resuscitation at point of admission
- Use of a β-blocker.

<summary>History</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Can be challenging in presence of respiratory distress or depressed conscious level. Use accompanying relative or carer if necessary.

Priorities:

- Clarify diagnosis:
  - Is this heart failure or a mimic? (see Table 21.1)
  - Has heart failure been diagnosed previously?
  - Is there dual pathology? e.g. heart failure and pneumonia

| **Chronic venous insufficiency** | |
| **Neurogenic pulmonary oedema** | Intracerebral haemorrhage<br>Electroconvulsive therapy<br>Head injury |
| **Drug overdose** | Opiate toxicity<br>Salicylate toxicity |

- Assess symptoms:
  - Breathlessness, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea
  - Grade effort tolerance using the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification
  - Peripheral oedema: often not present, especially in younger patients despite considerable relative fluid overload due to undetected ascites and bowel oedema
  - Abdominal swelling (ascites), tightness, and bloating
  - Weight changes:
    - Gain: fluid retention
    - Loss: cardiac cachexia

- Try to define cause for decompensation or acute presentation:
  - Symptoms of ischaemia, arrhythmia, hypotension
  - Recent medication changes or compliance issues
  - Cardiotoxic drugs or drugs that may exacerbate fluid retention (see Box 21.1)
  - Non-adherence to fluid, salt, or alcohol restriction
  - Beware of the 'nil by mouth' surgical patient. Has cardiac medication been withheld? Has patient received excessive IV fluid?
- Define comorbidities:
  - Associated with worse prognosis (see Box 21.2).
  - Can impact on transplant candidacy (see Chapter 22)
- Establish usual quality of life and whether an advanced directive is in place. Wishes of patient should be of central importance.

<summary>Investigation</summary>
<div class="details-content">

**Clinical haematology and biochemistry**

- Full blood count: anaemia can exacerbate cardiac failure and, occasionally, is the primary cause of it.
- Renal dysfunction is common and often improves (paradoxically) with aggressive diuretic therapy.
- Electrolytes: frequently disturbed either as a consequence of the disease or, more commonly, as a result of treatment.
- Glucose, lipids, and thyroid function.
- Liver function tests: often abnormal as a result of hepatic congestion caused by cardiac failure.
- Clotting screen: hepatic congestion in heart failure often associated with deranged coagulation parameters.
- Cardiomyopathy 'screen': should be checked when the underlying diagnosis has not been ascertained. Should include:
  - Viral serology (viral myocarditis/cardiomyopathy), ferritin (haemochromatosis), thyroid function tests, calcium, serum ACE (cardiac sarcoidosis), 24-hour urine collection for metanephrines (phaeochromocytoma), creatine kinase (neuromuscular disease), auto-antibodies (connective tissue disease).
- Troponin: may be markedly elevated in myocardial ischaemia and infarction. However, modest elevations also occur in DHF (whatever the cause), myocarditis, and severe non-cardiac illness, e.g. pneumonia.
- Natriuretic peptides such as brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and its precursor N-terminal-pro BNP (NT-proBNP). Released in response to myocardial wall stress. May help guide therapy in DHF. BNP should fall as condition improves.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Electrocardiogram</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Rarely normal in heart failure. Normal ECG carries a negative predictive value of ~98%.
- Can provide important clues to the underlying aetiology of the cardiac failure:
  - Pathological Q waves and ST segment or T wave changes: suggest the presence of ischaemic heart disease.
  - Large voltage QRS complexes suggest LV hypertrophy.
  - Low voltage QRS complexes: consider hypothyroidism, amyloidosis or pericardial effusion.
  - Electrical alternans: alternating amplitude of QRS complex sometimes seen with pericardial effusion.
- Provides evidence of conduction problems or arrhythmia:
  - Bradycardia or 2nd- or 3rd-degree AV block: cause may be organic conduction system disease or drug side effects.
  - Atrial arrhythmias: particularly common and may either be a cause or a consequence of heart failure.
</div>
</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Chest X-ray</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- CXR can often confirm or refute the diagnosis, may provide clues to aetiology, provide alternative diagnoses or highlight complications or comorbidity such as superimposed pneumonia (see Table 21.2).
- Beware: normal cardiothoracic ratio has low sensitivity and specificity for the detection of heart failure (normal in ~40–50% of patients with LV dysfunction).
- Be careful: the relationship between haemodynamic and pulmonary vascular abnormalities are variable. Some patients with severe heart failure may not have X-ray features of pulmonary venous congestion or oedema despite very high pulmonary capillary pressures.

#####  Table 21.2 the CXr in heart failure
| Classic CXR features of cardiac failure | CXR features providing clues to the aetiology |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Cardiomegaly (cardiothoracic ratio >0.5 (postero-anterior radiograph)) | Prominent hilar vessels (pulmonary hypertension) |
| Upper lobe venous diversion<br>Peribronchial cuffing | Bulging left heart border with retrosternal 'double density' (left ventricular aneurysm) |
| 'Kerley B lines' | Left atrial enlargement (mitral valve disease) |
| Fluid in horizontal fissure | Pericardial calcification (constrictive pericarditis) |
| Bilateral alveolar oedema incl. 'bat's wing' perihilar shadowing | Valvular calcification (valvular heart disease) |
| Pleural effusion (bilateral or R>L) | Rib notching (coarctation of the aorta) |

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Echocardiography (transthoracic and/or transoesophageal)</summary>
<div class="details-content">

• The echocardiogram remains one of the most important investigations in the patient with heart failure. It can detect the presence, the aetiology, and the severity of heart failure. See Chapter 32.
</div>
</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Right heart catheterization</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- The utility and appropriateness of right heart catheterization in patients with heart failure is controversial.
- The ESCAPE randomized controlled trial recruited 433 patients with DHF and examined outcomes in those assigned to invasive monitoring in the form of right heart catheterization versus those managed by clinical assessment alone. After a 6-month follow-up period there was no difference in the number of days patients were alive and out of hospital and no difference in overall mortality.
- There is no similar data for patients with DHF who require intensive care; many specialist heart failure units consider right heart catheterization an important investigation in this patient group. For example, a normal or low pulmonary artery capillary wedge pressure should question the diagnosis of heart failure and/or may significantly change a frequent model of treatment, aggressive diuresis. Thus, selected patients with severe DHF may benefit from right heart catheterization.
- Right heart catheterization is a routine means of assessment of patients potentially suitable for cardiac transplantation.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Endomyocardial biopsy</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- An AHA/ACC/ESC consensus document providing guidance on the appropriateness of endomyocardial biopsy has been published (see Table 21.3). Those scenarios in which biopsy is considered to have a Class I indication primarily focus on the detection or differentiation of giant cell myocarditis from other myocarditides for which the prognosis and therapeutic strategy may differ substantially.
- Endomyocardial biopsy might also be considered in heart failure with suspected infiltrative processes such as amyloid, sarcoid, and haemochromatosis, as well as in eosinophilic myocarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy of unknown origin.
- Cardiac biopsy should only be carried out by operators and centres with experience in performing the procedure.

#####  Table 21.3 Clinical indications for endomyocardial biopsy

<summary>Initial management</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Airway assessment
- Ensure adequate oxygenation (continuous pulse oximetry). Oxygen supplementation can be titrated in order to keep the patient comfortable and arterial oxygen saturation >90%. This can be provided by:
  - Non-rebreather face mask delivering high-flow defined per cent oxygen.
  - Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV). If respiratory acidosis, respiratory distress, and/or hypoxia, consider NIV as the preferred initial modality of assisted ventilation as long as the patient does not have a contraindication (see Chapter 26).
  - Conventional mechanical ventilation may be necessary in patients with respiratory failure who do not tolerate or have contraindications to NIV, or in patients who fail NIV (see Chapter 26).
- Repeated assessment of BP.
- Continuous ECG.
- IV access.
- Upright posture.
- Urine output monitoring, preferably with the placement of a urethral catheter.
- Pharmacological VTE prophylaxis (e.g. LMWH) is indicated in patients admitted with decompensated HF who are not already anticoagulated and have no contraindication to anticoagulation.
- Diuretic therapy:
  - Loop diuretics, e.g. furosemide intravenously as a continuous infusion (more controllable than boluses). Start at a dose of 5 mg/hour increasing to 10 mg/hour and if necessary 20 mg/hour until diuresis is achieved.
  - Aim for negative fluid balance between 500 mL and 1000 mL per 24 hours.
  - Monitor urea and electrolytes closely for hyponatraemia and hypokalaemia. Potassium supplementation may be necessary especially if cardiac rhythm is labile.
- Ultrafiltration:
  - Understandably, there has been some interest in the use of this method in patients with DHF. However, studies are small and although they show improvements in morbidity, such as duration of hospital readmission, no mortality benefits have been shown.
  - The role of ultrafiltration in DHF has yet to be defined and should be used with caution.
- Vasodilator therapy (if BP allows):
  - GTN infusion; start at 5 mcg/minute, increase by 5 mcg/minute to 20 mcg/minute. If no response at 20 mcg/minute, may increase by 10–20 mcg/minute every 3–5 minutes (generally accepted maximum dose 400 mcg/minute).
- Morphine or other mu-opioid.
  - Treats dyspnoea and anxiety and agitation. Avoid over narcotization. 2–5 mg as required. Target-controlled remifentanil is good alternative with excellent controllability.

- Avoid or stop:
  - β-blockers (see Box 21.3). If concern regarding tachyarrhythmia consider amiodarone as a substitute.
  - Calcium-channel blockers such as nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil have negative inotropic activity and for this reason are generally avoided in patients with heart failure due to systolic dysfunction. Other calcium channel blockers such as felodipine and amlodipine appear to be safe in heart failure and can be used to treat hypertension although this is rarely a problem in patients with heart failure resistant to standard medical therapy.
- Consider CVP monitoring
- Consider right heart catheterization (See 'Right heart catheterization' section in Introduction).

**NB** Prolonged supine or head-down positioning for central line insertion may precipitate further decompensation or even cardiac arrest

- IV inotropes and vasopressors:
  - Inotropic agents such as dobutamine and/or milrinone may be used in selected patients with severe LV systolic dysfunction and low cardiac output syndrome (reduced peripheral perfusion and end-organ dysfunction) for whom treatment may be restricted by borderline systemic BP or inadequate response to vasodilator and diuretic therapy. Such measures are often temporary and act as a bridge to stabilization and/or more definitive treatment.

Consider intravenous inotropes such as dobutamine or milrinone:

- In DHF patients with severe LV systolic dysfunction with low systemic BP (<90 mmHg) despite adequate filling pressures or are unresponsive to or intolerant of IV vasodilators.
- In patients with evidence of fluid overload unresponsive to IV diuretics.

The use of IV inotropes in the context of severe DHF should be accompanied by continuous or frequent BP monitoring and continuous monitoring of cardiac rhythm. If tachyarrhythmias or hypotension occur in response to the use of inotropes, consider withdrawal or dose reduction.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Arrhythmia management</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias can occur in DHF.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Atrial fibrillation</summary>
<div class="details-content">

AF is common in patients with DHF. The relationship between decompensation and AF include:

- DHF can precipitate AF secondary to ↑ cardiac filling pressures, ↑ left atrial pressure, and subsequent wall stretch.
- In this scenario successful treatment of components of the decompensation such as pulmonary oedema may slow the ventricular rate or precipitate cardioversion to sinus rhythm.
- AF can precipitate decompensation, particularly if the ventricular rate is high.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Box 21.3 β-blockers</summary>
<div class="details-content">

β-blockers reduce mortality when used in the long-term management of patients with *stable* heart failure. Thus most patients with known heart failure because of LV systolic dysfunction will be taking a β-blocker prior to hospital admission.

The continuation of β-blockers following admission is reasonable in a patient responding to standard medical therapy. However in unstable patients with DHF, the continuation of β-blockers can result in a poor response to usual medical therapy such as intravenous loop diuretic. Moreover, the initiation of a β-blocker in such an unstable patient can result in cardiogenic shock (negatively inotropic) and is a common cause for the deterioration which results in emergency referral to a tertiary centre for advanced therapies.

Many patients with DHF will have a resting tachycardia in response to the decompensation (as a response to maintain cardiac output in the face of a fixed stroke volume). The temptation to attribute the heart failure to the tachycardia is usually misguided but is often used to justify the use of β-blockers in the decompensated patient.

*As a general principle,* β-blockers should be avoided in DHF. If rate or rhythm control is necessary for AF or broad complex tachycardia, the use of amiodarone is recommended since it is usually well tolerated in the decompensated patient*.

- A rate control strategy is adequate in the first instance using drugs such as amiodarone or digoxin. Note: medium- to long-acting β-blockers and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should be avoided; short-acting formulations of β-blockers such as IV esmolol are sometimes used.
- AF may be chronic and not have a direct association with decompensation.
- Rate control is often the preferred initial strategy for the following reasons:
  - Cardioversion prior to the resolution of acute HF will often be followed by early recurrence of AF because DHF can precipitate AF.
  - AF is often a chronic condition and more often than not poor rate control is a response to decompensation rather than causative.

Heparin should be started prior to cardioversion, if possible.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Ventricular arrhythmias</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Ventricular tachycardia in the context of DHF may be life threatening and so prompt electrical cardioversion or defibrillation is often required.

If VT recurs after reversion, antiarrhythmic therapy, particularly with amiodarone may be effective.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Intra-aortic balloon pump</summary>
<div class="details-content">

IABP represents a reliable and effective device for stabilizing patients with DHF. Nonetheless it is invasive, is not complication free, and renders the patient immobile. Identification of patients who may benefit for IABP can be challenging:

- Patients with cardiogenic pulmonary oedema and cardiogenic shock should be considered candidates for IABP and if necessary formal MCS. They usually have a systolic arterial pressure <90 mmHg, a cardiac index <2 L/min/m<sup>2</sup>, and a PCWP >18 mmHg, despite adequate pharmacological therapy.
- Some patients present so acutely that such invasive measurements are not available and/or their trajectory is towards severe cardiogenic shock and death. Emergency IABP insertion should be considered in such patients.
- IABP may be inserted as a bridge to formal MCS and/or transplantation.
- IABP may be inserted to stabilize DHF, improve renal perfusion, and precipitate a diuresis; following a period of stability they can often be removed safely without the need for reinsertion or further escalation of therapy.
</div>
</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Short-term/long-term VAD</summary>
<div class="details-content">

IABPs are frequently effective at stabilizing a patient with cardiogenic shock. However, some will decline despite the presence of an IABP. The use of a short-term VAD or ECMO offers more definitive cardiovascular support and can be used as:

- Bridge to transplantation (BTT).
- Bridge to long-term LVAD implantation if suitable donor organ does not become available whilst BTT.
- Bridge to decision, if neurological status is unknown and might be expected to improve with improved 'cardiac output'. Decision may be to move to BTT or palliation if neurological status poor.
- Bridge to recovery if myocardial recovery is plausible, for example, in myocarditis.
- Bridge to retransplantation in acute allograft rejection post first cardiac transplant.
</div>
</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Femoral vein to femoral artery ECMO</summary>
<div class="details-content">

The advantages of ECMO:

- Is that it can provide oxygenation (relevant in a patient with severe pulmonary oedema)
- It leaves the chest untouched making cardiac transplantation and/or long-term LVAD implantation attractive for the future.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Disadvantages include:</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Requirement for powerful anticoagulation increasing bleeding risk
- The period on ECMO is limited to 1–2 weeks
- Finally the cardiac chambers are not decompressed.

An alternative to ECMO is a central short-term VAD. Both left and right hearts can be supported if necessary (BiVAD) for up to 2 months with decompression of the cardiac chambers being possible. Unfortunately central short-term VADs require sternotomy and cardiotomy rendering the patient higher risk for future cardiac surgery if upgrade to a long-term LVAD or transplant is required.
</div>
</details>
</div>
</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Long-term LVAD</summary>
<div class="details-content">

These devices are not usually considered in patients in cardiogenic shock because of the relatively poor outcomes seen in such patients married with the cost of the device in comparison to ECMO or a short-term VAD. Additionally, they only support the left heart and so are dependent on the presence of reasonable RV function.
</div>
</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Transplantation</summary>
<div class="details-content">

The most common indication for heart transplantation is severe heart failure refractory to medical therapy. Some patients are ambulatory at home prior to admission for transplantation. However, increasingly transplantation is occurring in patients with decompensated heart failure who are inotrope and/or IABP and/or VAD/ECMO dependent (see Heart transplantation, pp. 228–229).

<details class="med-details">
<summary>End of life</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Recognizing when management should focus on palliation rather than prognosis is important.

Average life expectancy following diagnosis of heart failure is <6 years.

Unpredictability in the course of heart failure makes identifying the end of life in patients with heart failure challenging, whether that be an out-patient or intensive care setting. Identification of patients requiring end of life care and palliation is not easy:

- Seek palliative care team advice (if available) early
- Take into consideration functional status of the patient pre-admission
- Seek advice from cardiologist regarding prognosis:
  - Use multidisciplinary team discussion if available
    - Discuss the issue with the patient
    - Discuss issue with family if patient consents.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Communicating with the patient and family</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- The life-limiting nature of heart failure should be acknowledged to patient and family early in care.
- Poor prognosis should be conveyed using a structured and planned 'breaking bad news' conversation. Suggested structure includes:
  - Ask patient what they know
  - Answer any queries they have
  - Convey any pieces of information crucial to decision-making
  - Ask if they have any further questions
  - Confirm that they have understood the key issues
  - Summarize the plan of care from hereon.
- The uncertainty of prognosis estimates should be emphasized.
- Regular daily (and if necessary more frequent) updates to patient and family should be planned.
- Issues that should not be overlooked are cardiopulmonary resuscitation status and the deactivation of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (discussed in 'Treatment').
- If palliation is feasible outside the ICU, and there is time, consider transfer home, to a hospice, or a favoured ward.
- Remember to offer connection to spiritual services.
</div>
</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Treatment</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Key aim is palliation of symptoms.

Thoroughly assess symptoms. Ask whether the patient is experiencing dyspnoea, pain, nausea, sleep disturbance, depression/anxiety, constipation, and anorexia.

Do not wait for patients to volunteer symptoms, consider using a standardized questionnaire.

To avoid repeated shocks, discuss deactivation of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator with patient if relevant. Present turning off the defibrillator function as a simple step to improving the quality of the last few days of life. Emergency deactivation can usually be accomplished by placing a magnet over the defibrillator box; the magnet must remain in place for continued deactivation.

Many standard heart failure treatments are effective at alleviating symptom burden and should be used in palliation/end of life setting. They include:

- Oxygen. Ask the patient what mode of administration they prefer.
- Morphine or other mu-opioid. Treats dyspnoea and anxiety and agitation. Avoid over-narcotization. 2–5 mg as required. Alternatively give as continuous intravenous or subcutaneous infusion.
- Diuretics. Fluid overload should be treated with diuretics such as loop, thiazide, and aldosterone antagonists. Consider oral or intravenous administration. Remember that furosemide can be given subcutaneously if necessary.
- ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, and β-blockers. Their role in a dying patient with decompensation is unknown but unlikely to improve symptoms acutely in a patient with end-stage DHF. Indeed, β-blockers are likely to make symptoms worse (see Box 21.3). Have a low threshold to withdraw these drugs in palliated patients who are in-patients.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Step down/weaning</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Weaning of inotropes, artificial ventilation, and IABP support is common if a patient's condition improves.
- Commonly, weaning from a ventilator is the first goal, followed by weaning from inotropes, and finally weaning from balloon pump.
- Ventilator weaning (see Weaning strategies, p. 283).
- Weaning from inotropes (see Management of hypotension, p. 51).

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Weaning from IABP</summary>
<div class="details-content">

It is usual practice to lower the frequency of balloon pump inflation prior to removal. For example, 4 hours at one inflation in every two cardiac cycles ('1 in 2') would be the relatively rapid weaning in a patient that might be expected to tolerate removal. Alternatively for patients who have been balloon pump-dependent for several weeks, 24 hours at '1 in 2' then a further 24 hours at '1 in 3' might be a more judicious plan prior to IABP removal. Care should be taken to monitor patients closely in the first 24 hours post IABP removal looking for evidence of decompensation.
