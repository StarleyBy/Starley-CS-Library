<summary>Modes of mechanical ventilation</summary>
<div class="details-content">

#### *Positive pressure ventilators*

Ventilators and ventilator modes may be classified according to input power, mode of triggering, inspiratory characteristics, mode of cycling, the pattern of mandatory and spontaneous breaths, and method of synchronization.

###### *Input power*

Input is either electrical or pneumatic.

###### *Triggering—the start of inspiration*

Ventilators measure pressure, volume, flow, and time. Inspiration is started (triggered) when one of these variables reaches a preset value. Breaths may be triggered by the patient or ventilator. If the respiratory rate is set at 10/ min, a controlled mechanical breath will be commenced every 6 seconds (time triggering). For patient-triggered breaths, it is usually a change in flow or pressure which results in the start of a supported spontaneous breath (e.g. pressure support ventilation, PSV) or a mandatory breath (e.g. synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) in the synchronization window, or assist control ventilation (ACV)). Alternate triggers are possible (e.g. diaphragmatic contraction or chest wall motion in children).

#### *Inspiratory phase*

###### *Control mode*

Ventilators are either pressure controllers, or flow (or volume) controllers. In practice flow and volume controllers behave almost identically (direct control of flow means indirect control of volume and vice versa) and both are called 'volume controlled ventilation' (VCV). Most VCV uses flow control.

#### *Pressure control ventilation versus volume control ventilation*

The diagrams demonstrate the difference between a pressure-controlled and a volume-controlled breath.

With pressure control, inspiratory pressure is chosen by the clinician (1a). Flow in a passive patient is decelerating (1b first curve). With increasing patient effort sine wave flow becomes more prominent. Airway pressure is controlled, but the volume delivered depends on respiratory system impedance and inspiratory time (1c).

Usually with volume control, TV and inspiratory flow are chosen by the clinician (inspiratory flow is often set indirectly by choosing the respiratory rate, inspiratory:expiratory ratio, and tidal volume, e.g. RR 20, I:E 1:2, TV 600mL=1 second for inspiration, therefore inspiratory flow of 36L/min; 2b). Delivered volume is controlled, but airway pressure is dependent on resistance (for peak pressure) and compliance (for plateau pressure) (2a).

No benefit in significant outcomes has ever been demonstrated for either mode over the other. Many of the trials of ventilatory strategies use volume control ventilation. Compared with VCV, PCV has the following theoretical advantages:

- Alveolar pressure is limited and cannot be higher than the set inspiratory pressure.
- Peak airway pressures will be lower for an equivalent tidal volume.
- For a given peak airway pressure, mean airway pressure is higher. Oxygenation may therefore be improved (but will also depend on the plateau pressure and PEEP).
- There may be improved distribution of ventilation. There is less end inspiratory gradient of pressure among regional units with heterogeneous time constants. CO<sub>2</sub> elimination is improved.

The main disadvantage of PCV is the variation in tidal volume. In addition, when there is vigorous patient inspiratory effort, pleural pressure drops significantly and the transpulmonary pressure (one of the crucial causes of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI)) may be high.

Studies do not demonstrate a difference in the incidence of VILI and there are similar haemodynamic consequences.

Modern ventilators can deliver breaths with characteristics of both types of breath, called dual control or hybrid breaths (e.g. pressure regulated volume control, where pressure control and decelerating flow patterns are combined with volume cycling).

###### *Limit*

The term limit refers to any variable which reaches a preset value before inspiration ends. It sustains inspiration. 'Limit' is sometimes interchangeable with 'control', e.g. pressure-controlled breaths are equivalent to pressure-limited breaths which are equivalent to pressure-targeted breaths. This terminology may also lead to confusion: the phrase 'volume limited' usually means flow limited and volume cycled (VCV).

#### *Inspiratory to expiratory cycling—the start of expiration*

Expiration starts when a preset value of flow, time, volume (or pressure) is reached. Mandatory breaths are generally time cycled (PCV) or volume cycled (VCV). Spontaneous supported breaths (PSV) are usually flow cycled (expiration usually starts at 25–33% of peak inspiratory flow. This is adjustable on some ventilators).

Pressure cycling is now only used as a safety backup for other forms of cycling, i.e. it will terminate the breath if pressure rises to the preset limit.

#### *Mandatory vs spontaneous and patient-ventilator synchrony*

Mandatory breaths are machine triggered or cycled. Mandatory breaths that are patient triggered are called assisted.

Spontaneous breaths are patient triggered and cycled. Spontaneous breaths may be supported or unsupported.

Synchrony is the agreement between the patient's own (neural) and the ventilator (mechanical) inspiratory and expiratory time, and includes the matching of patient effort with delivered tidal volume (more effort should result in i volume). Each mode of ventilation has specific rules governing interaction with the patient. These rules are made clear in all ventilator manuals, but this subject is outside the scope of this chapter. As an example we will examine the differences between pressure SIMV (P-SIMV) and BIPAP:

P-SIMV and BIPAP are identical in a passive patient.

In an active patient, patient ventilator interaction during expiration is the same. There are two expiratory time windows. During the first period of expiration, the patient is allowed to breathe spontaneously or with support (PSV). During the second (trigger) window, patient effort will trigger a time-cycled mandatory breath.

The modes, however, differ during inspiration. With BIPAP, the patient can breathe throughout inspiration (with a floating valve opening to prevent excessive airway pressure). Patient efforts are allowed, and superimposed on the time-cycled inspiratory pressure. Cycling to expiration is also synchronized with patient expiration. With P-SIMV, patient effort is unrecognized during inspiration, and may result in breath termination due to a breach of the high pressure safety limit.

#### *Synchrony*

It is important to recognize that no current mode of ventilation that uses pneumatic signals to trigger and cycle (including modes such as PSV/ assisted spontaneous breathing) is without significant synchrony problems. Difficulties include inspiratory trigger delay, ineffective triggering, double triggering, auto triggering, inspiratory time extension, early expiratory cycling, and failure of expiratory cycling. Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) may reduce some of the common difficulties by using diaphragmatic contraction to trigger breaths and to guide support levels.

#### *Effects of positive intrathoracic pressure*

The mean intrathroracic pressure depends on the PEEP, plateau pressure, and time spent in inspiration (the I:E ratio).

Cardiovascular side effects due to heart–lung interactions are common. Both changes in lung volume and changes in intrathoracic pressure contribute to these consequences. Full discussion is beyond the scope of this chapter.

Respiratory side effects constitute the best documented short- and long-term causes of morbidity and mortality related to ventilation. These range from sudden onset of tension pneumothorax to the development of diffuse alveolar damage, the release of inflammatory mediators, and subsequent other organ dysfunction (VILI).

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Potential benefits of positive intrathoracic pressure</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Alveolar recruitment:
  - • Reduced shunt
  - • ↑ V/Q.
  - • Improved compliance and reduced work of breathing.
- Reduced LV preload and afterload in cardiogenic pulmonary oedema.
- Reduced PVR by increasing lung volumes towards normal and reversing hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.
</div>
</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Potential harms</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- ↑ shunt fraction—elevating mean airway pressure will increase PVR in compliant, healthy areas of lung and divert blood to consolidated areas.
- ↑ deadspace—d blood flow to ventilated areas, especially in apical regions.
- ↓ compliance—overdistended lung on the flat upper portion of the P/V (compliance) curve.
- ↑ PVR (if lung is overdistended).
- ↓ CO:
  - • Reduced LV preload or ↑ PVR in normo- or hypovolaemic states.
  - • Reduced CO may increase V/Q, but will reduce oxygen delivery and SvO<sub>2</sub>

Detrimental heart lung interactions can be minimized by preventing both hyperinflation and alveolar derecruitment, reducing work of breathing, preventing volume overload during weaning, and avoiding negative pressure swings in intrathoracic pressure during spontaneous breathing.

#### *Expiration*

Expiration is passive in all modes except high frequency oscillation. PEEP is almost always applied in critically unwell patients. It increases FRC, recruits alveoli, reduces shunt, helps prevent atelectrauma and reduces preload and afterload. A full discussion of the best way to set the level of PEEP is out with the scope of this chapter.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Ventilator Induced Lung Injury</summary>
<div class="details-content">

This term encompasses barotrauma (injury due to excessive pressure) and volutrauma (injury due to excessive volume) – in combination these produce alveolar strain (defined as the ratio between the amount of gas volume delivered compared with the amount of aerated lung receiving it). Crucially, damage is also caused by atelectrauma (injury due to repeated opening and closing of alveoli) and biotrauma (distal organ dysfunction caused by release of inflammatory mediators because of VILI). Preventing VILI is difficult and the best way to do so is not established. In ARDS, avoid plateau pressures > 30cm H<sub>2</sub>O, use tidal volumes of no more than 6ml/kg of ideal body weight, select PEEP to prevent end expiratory alveolar closure without increasing alveolar strain (see further reading), and perhaps use intermittent recruitment manoeuvres. These techniques, in combination with permissive hypercapnia and permissive hypoxia, are together termed 'Lung Protective Ventilation'.

In concept, High Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation seemed the ideal way to achieve these ends, but two recent trials have suggested that at best outcomes are not improved, or that mortality may be worse when using this technique on unselected patients with ARDS.

<div class="details-content">

<details class="med-details">
<summary>CPAP</summary>
<div class="details-content">

CPAP is the application of constant positive airway pressure throughout the respiratory cycle in the spontaneously breathing patient. CPAP mainly improves oxygenation (see 📖 Effects of positive intrathoracic pressure). Effect on work of breathing is variable and depends on respiratory mechanics.
</div>
</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>NIV</summary>
<div class="details-content">

NIV usually refers to the application of higher inspiratory (inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP)) than expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP). It is usually patient triggered and flow cycled. It will improve oxygenation, increase minute ventilation, and usually reduce work of breathing.

<summary>Use of CPAP and NIV</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Non-invasive ventilation modes are useful in the treatment of reversible disease processes of limited duration. It has limited application in the treatment of prolonged disease processes like ALI.

#### *Cardiogenic pulmonary oedema*

↑ lung water secondary to interstitial and alveolar oedema increases the elastic workload of the lung and reduces compliance. CPAP recruits alveoli, reduces intrapulmonary shunt, and reduces preload and afterload. It often results in a rapid improvement in the patient's condition, and reduces mortality. The addition of an IPAP does not improve outcome.

#### *Acute respiratory failure in COPD*

In COPD, EPAP overcomes the ↑ threshold load due to intrinsic PEEP, and IPAP compensates for the additional inspiratory resistance from bronchoconstriction. Work of breathing is reduced and tidal volumes are increased.

In hypercapnic, acidotic exacerbations of COPD, BIPAP reduces intubation rates, and reduces in-hospital mortality. The risk reduction is directly proportional to the severity of the respiratory acidosis.

#### *Others*

Evidence for the use of NIV in other disease processes is limited. If the patient requires respiratory support continuously (as opposed to COPD where breaks can be taken), or for a long period (as opposed to LV failure where improvement is often relatively rapid), a tight-fitting facemask is often eventually poorly tolerated because of facial discomfort or skin breakdown.

In addition, gastric insufflation, difficulty clearing secretions, and an absence of airway protection reduce the effectiveness of prolonged use of CPAP and NIV. Where no clinical improvement is seen, intubation should be considered.

Used prophylactically after extubation it reduces reintubation in patients with COPD or who are hypercapnic pre extubation. It does not work well for respiratory failure post extubation.

<summary><span style="font-size:110%">Weaning strategies</span></summary>
<div class="details-content">

Weaning is the process of liberation from mechanical ventilation. It need not be a prolonged process, and many patients are weaned immediately postoperatively. This chapter deals with weaning from mechanical ventilation in the presence of acute or chronic respiratory disease.

Unnecessary prolongation of ventilation is costly and associated with an † risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia, lung injury, and delirium. Risk factors for prolonged weaning include old age, severity of acute illness, duration of mechanical ventilation, chronic respiratory disease, and neuro-muscular or musculoskeletal disorders.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Titration of respiratory support</summary>
<div class="details-content">

A process of active weaning is different from the titration of respiratory support while the wean screen (see later in topic) excludes the patient from a spontaneous breathing trial. This is the routine management of ventilatory support, progressing from high  FiO<sub>2</sub>  and airway pressures towards a spontaneous breathing trial.

Consider both the support required for oxygenation, and the support required for work of breathing. In general,  FiO<sub>2</sub>  is reduced to  ≤ 0.6 before there is a significant reduction in mean airway pressure. At this point, PEEP is lowered if oxygenation is acceptable. Inspiratory pressures, on the other hand, are reduced as tidal volume improves with  ↑  compliance, and if work of breathing is reasonable.
</div>
</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Assessment of suitability for weaning</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Prediction of successful weaning has been the subject of much investigation. Minute ventilation, maximal inspiratory pressure,  P<sub>0.1</sub>/P<sub>imax</sub>  and CROP score (Compliance Respiratory rate Oxygenation and Pressure) are all associated with an  ↑  chance of success. Unfortunately, the likelihood ratios are not large enough to make these measurements a real alternative to spontaneous breathing trials.

As well as a daily sedation vacation, a wean screen should be completed. If the wean screen is passed, a spontaneous breathing trial is undertaken and suitability for extubation (see  📖  Extubation) considered.

#### Wean screen

- Adequate resolution of underlying disease
- PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> > 25kPa, PEEP ≤8cmH<sub>2</sub>O
- Low-dose inotropic or vasoconstrictor support
- Capable of spontaneous breaths.

#### Spontaneous breathing trials

Spontaneous breathing trials do not take account of the preconditions to extubation (see Extubation). However, they are currently the best predictor of a patient's ability to breathe independently.

A spontaneous breathing trial is 30–120 minutes long in uncomplicated patients. After a prolonged weaning process, progressively increasing the duration of the trial until the trial lasts ≥24 hours may be appropriate. Traditionally, spontaneous breathing was assessed using a T-piece. Many clinicians add PEEP of 5 to reproduce physiological PEEP, and pressure support of 5–8cmH<sub>2</sub>O to overcome the resistance of the tube. Too much support will lead to an  ↑  failed extubation rate. Too little support will lead to unnecessary failure of the spontaneous breathing trial and delayed extubation.

The purpose of the trial is to reproduce the postextubation work of breathing conditions before extubation. While in most patients PS and PEEP will most accurately replicate these conditions, there are two subgroups in whom a T-piece trial may be useful:

- Patients with known LV systolic dysfunction. Assessment without the beneficial effects of PEEP is helpful.
- Patients with known or potential upper airway swelling (e.g. prolonged intubation, significant oedema) where the postextubation work of breathing is likely to be higher.

As the majority of patients in the CICU setting have an element of LV systolic dysfunction, a successful T-piece trial will reduce the rate of failed extubation.

A spontaneous breathing trial should be discontinued if there is:

- Respiratory compromise: PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> <25kPa, respiratory rate >35 breaths/minute or increase of >50%, accessory muscle use, fatigue
- Cardiovascular instability: systolic BP >180mmHg or <90mmHg, HR >120bpm.
- Neurological dysfunction: agitation, anxiety, sweating, or reduction in GCS score.

The daily sedation hold, wean screen, and spontaneous breathing trial constitute a weaning protocol. Despite a reluctance to use such protocols, in trials they outperform or match more traditional methods of weaning.

CT chest is increasingly the investigation of choice in ICU. It allows accurate assessment of lung parenchyma and pleural disease:

- Exclude infection. If in doubt perform bronchoalveolar lavage.
- Drain pleural effusions, unless small bilateral transudates and diuresis is underway.
- Treat bronchospasm.
- Reduce FiO, to achieve a normal SpO, for that patient.
- Normalize PaCO<sub>2</sub> unless chronically hypercapnic. If respiratory acidosis has resulted in compensatory metabolic alkalosis, several days of mandatory mode of ventilation (with high MV), combined with acetazolamide (to eliminate more quickly the metabolic alkalosis) is reasonable. Continue until bicarbonate is normal.

- During the day, progressively wean pressure support and increase the time with no respiratory support.
- During a prolonged wean, night time should be a period of rest to allow sleep, re-recruit the lung, and correct hypercapnia. PSV alone is associated with ↑ sleep disturbance (compared with assist control ventilation) because of apnoeas and micro-arousals: a mandatory backup rate prevents this.
- Demedicalize the environment: TV, reading materials, and items from home including normal clothes.
- Sitting improves functional residual capacity, and promotes normality.
- Encourage eating and drinking.
- Speaking valves improve morale and vocal cord function.

Remember the possibility of long-term (home) ventilation for some patients who are unable to wean.
