## **Acute kidney injury**

## **Introduction**

The principal functions of the kidney are:

- Regulation of body fluid volume and osmolality
- Excretion of metabolic end products and foreign substances
- Regulation of acid–base
- Production and secretion of enzymes and hormones (erythropoietin, renin, and ,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 ).

In healthy subjects any change in body fluid volume, BP, or acid–base balance is corrected in a matter of hours, however in disease states these regulatory processes are disturbed.

The true incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in cardiac surgery is not clear, as there is significant variability in studies over how abrupt or severe the kidney dysfunction must be before it is defined as AKI. It is, however, a common complication of critical illness and an independent risk factor for postoperative death. The risk for death is proportional to the severity of kidney injury with mortality being as high as 50% in the general intensive care setting. Mortality is higher in patients with a sustained elevation of creatinine than in those who recover function.

All patients undergoing cardiac surgery are at risk of AKI either through their presenting illness or subsequent iatrogenic injury. Specific risk factors are listed in Table 3. and these should be considered prior to elective surgery. The most common pathogenesis of AKI following cardiac surgery is disrupted renal blood flow and the accepted prevention strategies are therefore:

- Appropriate IV volume expansion
- Optimization of CO
- Maintenance of renal blood flow and renal perfusion pressure.

#### *'Renal dose dopamine'*

There is no clinical benefit for its use in the prevention or treatment of AKI. Recent studies have shown it can worsen renal perfusion in patients with established AKI.

#### *Furosemide infusion*

Furosemide does not prevent the development of, or hasten the recovery from, AKI. Its inappropriate use can lead to intravascular hypovolaemia and worsening renal function. Loop diuretics can be used to correct volume overload in patients who are still responsive to treatment.

## **Key point: contrast-induced nephropathy**

Identify patients at risk and carefully assess their fluid status. If indicated use pre- and postprocedure volume expansion with 0.9% sodium chloride or isotonic sodium bicarbonate. The use of N-acetyl cysteine is not recommended. Diuretics, NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, and metformin should be withheld near the time of the procedure. As metformin is exclusively excreted by the kidneys, patients who develop AKI are at i risk of lactic acidosis. If creatinine clearance is <60mL/min stop for 24 hours prior to contrast being given.

## **Key point: biomarkers in renal disease**

Creatinine is currently the only biomarker of renal disease used in clinical practice. It is easily measured and specific for renal function; however, an acute decline in kidney function is not reflected by a rise in serum creatinine for several hours. For this reason urine output is used as a clinical monitor of renal function.

#### **Definition and staging**

The term acute renal failure implies that the function of the kidney is significantly deranged. Renal failure is a spectrum of disease from less severe forms of injury to more advanced injury where renal replacement therapy (RRT) may be required. A small increase in serum creatinine level is an independent predictor of morbidity and mortality and for this reason the term acute kidney injury (AKI) is now used to describe acute changes in renal function.

Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Acute Kidney Injury Work Group. KDIGO 202 Clinical Practice Guideline for Acute Kidney Injury. *Kidney Inter.*, Suppl. 203; 3: –50, reproduced with permission.

AKI is generally defined as 'an abrupt and sustained decrease in kidney function'. The UK Renal Association recommends that the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) definition as adopted and refined by the Kidney Diseases: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) International guideline group be used (Table 3.2).

AKI can be diagnosed when one of the following criteria is met:

- Serum creatinine rises by ≥26µmol/L from baseline within 48 hours *or*
- Serum creatinine rises ≥.5× from baseline value which is known or presumed to have occurred within one week *or*
- Urine output documented <0.5mL/kg/hour for >6 consecutive hours.

## **General management**

The aims of non-RRT management should be prevention of further kidney injury and supportive care to allow functional recovery. Management should begin with prompt diagnosis and correction of the underlying cause of renal injury. Although the most common pathologies in AKI post-cardiac surgery involve disruption of the renal blood flow all causes should be considered and excluded where appropriate. Sepsis is known to be a leading contributing factor to AKI in critical illness and should be diagnosed and treated promptly.

#### *Clinical assessment general management measures*

- Assess fluid balance and optimize haemodynamic status:
  - • Clinical assessment—pulse, mean arterial blood pressure, capillary refill time, jugular or central venous pressure, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), acid–base balance, lactate, and serum albumin measurements
  - • Ensure adequate fluid replacement
  - • Consider the use of vasopressors or inotropes.

- Assess for complications of AKI:
  - • Correct hypoxaemia if pulmonary oedema—continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or intubation and ventilation may be necessary until fluid can be removed with RRT
  - • Recognize and treat hyperkalaemia
  - • Assess for signs of uraemia—pericarditis, encephalopathy, drowsiness, seizures.
- Consider and correct reversible causes of AKI.
- Establish preoperative renal function.
- Exclude renal tract obstruction using ultrasonography.
- Identify and treat sepsis appropriately.
- *Stop and avoid nephrotoxic medication and dose adjust those drugs with renal clearance*.
- Treat metabolic acidosis.

*Interpret a low urine output in the context of the patient's cardiovascular parameters*:

- The oliguric patient may not be hypovolaemic.
- Urine output is influenced by the patient's cardiovascular parameters, hydration state, the use of diuretics, the presence of renal tract obstruction, and the stress response to injury.

#### **Key point**

Hyperkalaemia when associated with ECG change is a medical emergency.

#### *Causes of AKI to consider*

- Pre-renal (reduced renal perfusion):
  - • Volume depletion, d BP, d CO, intrarenal vasoconstriction (drugs, radiographic contrast), hepatorenal syndrome.
- Renal or intrinsic:
  - • Vascular (renal arterial disease, aortic atheroma/cholesterol emboli), nephrotoxins, infections, interstitial nephritis, accelerated phase hypertension, vasculitis, glomerulonephritis.
- Post-renal (obstruction):
  - • Prostate hypertrophy, neurogenic bladder, intra ureteral obstruction (stones, tumour, thrombus, crystals), extra ureteral obstruction (tumour or retroperitoneal fibrosis).

## *Treatment of hyperkalaemia*

Ensure stable cardiac rhythm:

• IV calcium gluconate or calcium carbonate if ECG changes—follow ALS guidelines.

Stop exogenous sources of potassium:

• Nutrition (oral/enteral/parenteral), potassium supplementation, IV fluid (e.g. Hartmann's solution).

Promote intracellular shift of potassium:

- IV Actrapid® 0 units in 50mL of 50% dextrose administered over 5–30 minutes:
  - • Onset of action 5–30 minutes, max. effect 30–60 minutes, monitor blood glucose.
  - • Repeat if continued hyperkalaemia.
- Nebulized salbutamol 5–0mg four times a day.
- Sodium bicarbonate:
  - • Low pH leads to i serum K+ levels as K+ shifts from the cellular to the vascular space.
  - • The use of 500mL .26% NaHCO<sup>3</sup> may be indicated in the acidotic hyperkalaemic patient if fluid space allows but specialist advice should be sought.

## Remove potassium from body:

- Restore urine output and recover renal function
- Oral (or rectal) calcium resonium 5g four times a day
- Consider RRT if refractory hyperkalaemia.

## ECG changes in hyperkalaemia:

- Prolonged PR interval with flattening of loss of P waves
- Peaked T waves
- Widening of QRS interval
- Sine wave proceeding to ventricular fibrillation or asystole.

The ECG may be normal in life-threatening hyperkalaemia.

## **Fluid management**

- The healthy adult requires .5–2.5L (25–35mL/kg/24 hours) water, around 70mmol/L sodium, and 40–80mmol/L of potassium per 24 hours.
- Fluid deficits occur without obvious fluid loss from vasodilation and altered capillary permeability.
- All fluid losses should be taken in to consideration including urine output, insensible losses, and fluid losses during theatre.
- The nature of fluid lost should be considered to enable appropriate choice of fluid replacement.
- 24-hour change in weight is the best measure of change in fluid balance.

It is recognized that excessive fluid administration with 0.9% sodium chloride can lead to sodium and chloride overload and hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis. Balanced electrolyte solutions (Ringer's lactate or Hartmann's solution) should be used in preference to 0.9% sodium chloride in patients with AKI. Should, however, the patient be developing progressive AKI or hyperkalaemia treatment should change to non-potassium containing crystalloid solution.

#### **Key point**

The ability of critically ill patients to excrete excess Na and water is impaired placing them at i risk of interstitial oedema.

## **Renal replacement therapy**

RRT is an extracorporeal method of removing fluid and solutes from blood outside the body. During treatment blood comes in to contact with a semipermeable membrane where solute transfer occurs prior to it being returned to the patient. This can be carried out using intermittent (IRRT) or continuous (CRRT) techniques. In the acute setting IRRT is usually in the form of haemodialysis and CRRT is usually in the form of continuous veno-venous haemofiltration (CVVH) although hybrids of both techniques do exist.

## *IRRT—haemodialysis*

- • Solutes are removed by process of diffusion.
- Solute removal by this method is rapid and efficient.
- Fluid can be removed (ultrafiltration) by adjusting the pressures on the blood side of the semipermeable membrane.

## *CRRT—CVVH*

- Solutes are removed by process of convection across a highly permeable filter.
- • Convective solute removal is less efficient than diffusive but the continuous nature of the treatment compensates for this.
- The solute removal in CVVH is completely reliant on fluid removal therefore 'solute-free' fluid is replaced during the process either before (predilution) or after (postdilution) the blood comes in to contact with the semipermeable membrane

Consideration should be given to the type and dose of RRT chosen, the timing of initiation and discontinuation, access for RRT, and anticoagulation during RRT.

#### *Type of RRT chosen*

- • CRRT offers no survival advantage over IRRT in patients with AKI.
- The type of RRT chosen does not influence the rate of renal recovery following AKI.
- CRRT is associated with a significantly i risk of recurrent filter clotting compared to IRRT.
- Due to the continuous nature of CRRT there may be greater haemodynamic stability in patients with multiorgan failure and this is used in preference to IRRT in most ICUs.

#### *Possible indications for urgent RRT*

- Refractory hyperkalaemia >6.5mmol/L
- Refractory volume overload
- Refractory severe metabolic acidosis (pH <7.)
- Signs of uraemia (e.g. pericarditis, neuropathy, seizures, or an otherwise unexplained decline in metal status)
- Certain drug and alcohol intoxications.

#### *Indications for IRRT in preference to CRRT*

- Drug poisoning: removal of specific toxins such as Li+, theophyllines, etc.
- Bleeding risk: during CRRT blood is in contact with the extracorporeal circuit for longer and circuit clotting is more common, necessitating anticoagulation.
- Mobilization: rehabilitation and mobilization is difficult in patients receiving CRRT and in patients no longer confined to bed IRRT should be considered.

#### *Initiation and discontinuation of RRT*

There is lack of evidence to guide the optimal time to initiate RRT; however, for patients with multiorgan failure in the intensive care setting early initiation of RRT should be considered. When the urine output is ≥400mL/24 hours and the clinical condition of the patient is improving, discontinuation of RRT can be considered. Accurate assessment of fluid, electrolyte, and metabolic status is essential and RRT should be reconsidered if clinically indicated.

## *Dose of RRT*

The dose of RRT can be altered by adjusting the blood flow, the area of the semipermeable membrane, or the duration of treatment. The prescribed dose should be assessed daily for continuous techniques and prior to each session for intermittent techniques.

- *IRRT*: the best evidence suggests patients should receive at least 3 sessions/week with delivered Kt/V value of .2. Most patients require daily or alternate day treatments to achieve this value.
- *CRRT*: the best evidence suggests patients should receive treatment doses equivalent to post dilution ultrafiltration rates ≥25mL/kg/hour.

#### *Anticoagulation*

Due to the requirement of extracorporeal blood flow in both IRRT and CRRT some form of anticoagulation is usually required to prevent thrombosis in the blood circuit. Type of RRT and risk of bleeding should be taken in to consideration when choosing type of anticoagulation.

- Heparin: bolus 000–2000U at the start of RRT session followed by continuous infusion of 300–400U/hour. Aim for APPT in the venous limb .5–2 × control.
- Regional citrate anticoagulation: continuous infusion of isosmotic trisodium citrate solution (02mmol/L) in to the arterial side of the dialyser.
- Regional anticoagulation with protamine reversal: technically difficult with i risk of rebound bleeding 2–4 hours post RRT.

#### *Access*

- In the acute setting access is veno-venous and the access site depends on the clinical condition of the patient.
- Ultrasound guidance should be used to aid placement of venous catheters and post-procedure CXR should confirm position.
- Internal jugular catheters should be 5–20cm in length and femoral catheters should be 20–25cm in length.

• Tunnelling of the venous catheter is desirable if RRT is likely to be prolonged (>3 weeks).

#### *Complications of vascular access*

- Catheter-related bacteraemia: the catheter should be reserved for extracorporeal treatment only to minimize the risk of catheter-related infection. The exit site should be carefully monitored and temporary access should be changed if there is clinical suspicion of catheter-related infection.
- Arrhythmia: insertion of internal jugular or subclavian catheters in the hyperkalaemic patient risks the guidewire touching the endocardium resulting in life-threatening and refractory arrhythmias.
- Clotting of dialysis catheter lumens: between periods of IRRT catheters should be locked with heparin (000U/mL to the lumen volumes). This lock must be removed prior to recommencing RRT to avoid introducing heparin into the systemic circulation.

## *Complications of RRT*

- Hypotension: can occur with both IRRT and CRRT. i likelihood with high ultrafiltration rate, reduced LV function, and concurrent use of antihypertensive medications.
- Recirculation: caused when blood leaving the dialyser outlet returns to the inlet without having first passed through the peripheral bloodstream. This is more common with the use of femoral catheters and if the venous catheter used is an inadequate length.
- Infection: immune system dysregulation is multifactorial and patients with AKI have an i susceptibility to infection.
- Cardiac arrhythmias: can occur with rapid change in serum electrolyte concentration. Carefully monitor and replace potassium, phosphate, and magnesium if necessary.
- Haemolysis.
- Air embolism.
- Rupture of the dialysis membrane: can lead to blood loss and entry of microorganisms to the bloodstream. Usually avoided by ensuring ultrafiltration rate (transmembrane pressure) is not too high.
- Reaction to dialysis membrane: rare complication. Clinical manifestations can vary from anaphylaxis to abdominal pain, fevers, or headaches.
- Disequilibrium syndrome: neurological signs and symptoms caused by cerebral oedema due to a rapid reduction in blood urea nitrogen. Onset of symptoms is usually during or shortly after IRRT, however the syndrome is now rare as RRT is initiated at an earlier stage.
- Transmission of blood-borne viruses.

## **Chronic kidney disease**

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common in the general population and its prevalence is increasing. Cardiovascular disease is one of the most serious complications of CKD and cardiovascular disorders are the leading cause of death in patients with end-stage renal disease.

#### **CKD is defined as:**

- Kidney damage for ≥3 months, as defined by structural or functional abnormalities of the kidney, with or without d GFR, manifest by *either*:
  - • Pathological abnormalities *or*
  - • Markers of kidney damage, including abnormalities in the composition of the blood or urine, or abnormalities in imaging tests
- GFR ≤60mL/min/.73m2 for ≥3 months with or without kidney damage (Table 3.3).

#### **Influencing the progression of CKD**

Slowing the progression of CKD reduces the morbidity and mortality associated. The *control of systemic hypertension* is the most effective intervention and current guidelines suggest:

- <40/90mmHg in patients with CKD
- <30/80mmHg in patients with CKD and diabetes or proteinuria (albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) >70mg/mmol or protein:creatinine ratio (PCR) >00mg/mmol).

#### Other factors to consider are:

- • Protein has a direct nephrotoxic effect. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers improve outcome in patients with proteinuric CKD.
- Poor diabetic control contributes to a faster rate of decline in diabetic nephropathy.
- Smoking is associated with more rapid progression of CKD.
- Superimposed AKI acts as a promoter for progression of underlying CKD.

## **Key point**

AKI survivors with residual renal impairment should be managed according to local CKD guidelines. Discharge planning should encompass plans for CKD management and referral to specialist services if indicated. Refer to NICE CKD guideline for further information regarding appropriate follow-up.

## **Complications of CKD**

- Cardiovascular disease: the traditional Framingham risk factors apply in CKD –3 but the Framingham tables significantly underestimate the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with more advanced CKD. Statins reduce cardiovascular mortality in CKD stages –4. The role of statins in CKD5D patients is unclear and still under review.
- Hypertension: BP is a major risk factor for both cardiovascular and renal mortality. Dietary salt restriction should be suggested to all hypertensive patients with CKD. Target values are outlined as follows:
- Anaemia: consider the use of erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) in anaemic patients with eGFR <25mL/min (<40mL/min in diabetic patients). Exclude causes other than renal impairment and ensure patients have adequate stores of iron, vitamin B2 and folate prior to commencing ESA treatment. Aim for a target Hb of –2g/dL.
- Hyperparathyroidism and renal osteodystrophy: bone metabolism is disrupted in patients with moderate to severe CKD and accelerates vascular disease. In patients with CKD stage 3+ guidelines currently suggest serum calcium levels should be kept within normal limits, serum phosphate at or below .8mmol/L and PTH below 2–3 × the upper limit of normal. Specialist advice should be sought in patients who have evidence of renal bone disease.
- Metabolic acidosis: CKD stage 3+.
- Infection: alterations in both cellular and humoral immunity occur leading to a significant i susceptibility of infection. This worsens with progression of uraemia and stage of CKD.
- Malnutrition: anorexia and nausea are commonly found in patients with advancing CKD. Vitamin supplementation may be required.
