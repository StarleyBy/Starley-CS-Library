## **Интенсивность**

The principal functions of the kidney are:

- Regulation of body fluid volume and osmolality
- Excretion of metabolic end products and foreign substances
- Regulation of acid–base
- Production and secretion of enzymes and hormones (erythropoietin, renin, и 25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 ).

In healthy subjects any change in body fluid volume, BP, or acid–base balance is corrected in a matter of hours, however in disease states these regulatory processes are disturbed.

The true incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in cardiac surgery is not clear, as there is significant variability in studies over how abrupt or severe the kidney dysfunction must be before it is defined as AKI. However, it is a common complication of critical illness and an independent risk factor for postoperative death. The risk for death is proportional to the severity of kidney injury with mortality being as high as 50% in the general intensive care setting. Mortality is higher in patients with a sustained elevation of creatinine than in those who recover function.

All patients undergoing cardiac surgery are at risk of AKI either through their presenting illness or subsequent iatrogenic injury. Specific risk factors are listed in Table 3. и these should be considered prior to elective surgery. The most common pathogenesis of AKI following cardiac surgery is disrupted renal blood flow and the accepted prevention strategies are therefore:

- Appropriate IV volume expansion
- Optimization of CO
- Maintenance of renal blood flow and renal perfusion pressure.

#### *'Ренал донор dopamin'**

There is no clinical benefit for its use in the prevention or treatment of AKI. Recent studies have shown it can worsen renal perfusion in patients with established AKI.

#### *Furosemide infusion*

Furosemide does not prevent the development of, or hasten the recovery from, AKI. Its inappropriate use can lead to intravascular hypovolaemia and worsening renal function. Loop diuretics can be used to correct volume overload in patients who are still responsive to treatment.

### *Техника removal of potassium*

Ensure stable cardiac rhythm:

• IV calcium gluconate or calcium carbonate if ECG changes—follow ALS guidelines.

Stop exogenous sources of potassium:

• Nutrition (oral/enteral/parenteral), potassium supplementation, IV fluid (e.g. Hartmann's solution).

Promote intracellular shift of potassium:

- IV Actrapid® 0 units in 50mL of 50% dextrose administered over 5–30 minutes:
  • Onset of action 5–30 minutes, max. effect 30–60 minutes, monitor blood glucose.
  • Repeat if continued hyperkalaemia.

### *Рециркуляция*

Hypotension: can occur with both IRRT and CRRT. i likelihood with high ultrafiltration rate, reduced LV function, and concurrent use of antihypertensive medications.

Infection: immune system dysregulation is multifactorial and patients with AKI have an i susceptibility to infection.

Cardiac arrhythmias: can occur with rapid change in serum electrolyte concentration. Carefully monitor and replace potassium, phosphate, and magnesium if necessary.

Haemolysis.
Air embolism.
Rupture of the dialysis membrane: can lead to blood loss and entry of microorganisms to the bloodstream. Usually avoided by ensuring ultrafiltration rate (transmembrane pressure) is not too high.

### *Случайи complications*

- Infection: alterations in both cellular and humoral immunity occur leading to a significant i susceptibility of infection. This worsens with progression of uraemia and stage of CKD.
- Malnutrition: anorexia and nausea are commonly found in patients with advancing CKD. Vitamin supplementation may be required.
