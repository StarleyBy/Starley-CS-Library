# **The normal postoperative cardiac patient**

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Introduction</summary>
<div class="details-content">
Cardiac surgery involves considerable physiological trespass. Nevertheless, most cardiac patients recover uneventfully with comfortable margins of safety.

However, a small proportion of routine patients develop an important treatable complication. A second small group of patients are critically ill and are dependant on exact optimization of their physiology, either because of their preoperative condition or their operative course or both. The latter group are usually obvious and are often already on substantial support and invasive monitoring when they leave theatre. Recognizing the first group is crucial and is a key skill of cardiac intensive care. The key to success with these patients is early proactive management. In turn, this requires attention to detail, an understanding of normal postoperative course, close serial observation, and excellent diagnosis employing early use of additional monitoring and investigation.

<summary>Effects of surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass</summary>
<div class="details-content">


<details class="med-details">
<summary>Inflammatory response</summary>
<div class="details-content">
Major surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) both cause a systemic inflammatory response. All patients who have undergone cardiac surgery will have some degree of inflammatory activation, even those who have undergone off-pump surgery. In a substantial proportion of patients this response will be clinically apparent and in a small fraction it will be problematic.
</div>
</details>


<details class="med-details">
<summary>Cooling</summary>
<div class="details-content">

During CPB patients are often cooled to 32°C or lower. Despite initial re-warming, after separation from bypass there may be a re-distribution of heat to poorly perfused tissues leading to an 'after drop' in core temperature. Once anaesthesia wears off, the low core temperature will trigger reflex shivering. This in turn leads to i cardiac output (CO) and i respiratory workload to service the muscle activity. Re-warming normally occurs at 0.5–2°C/hour and is dependent on a normal CO and blood volume.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Pulmonary effects</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Gas exchange is often measurably impaired after cardiac surgery. This is due to a combination of causes including atelectasis as a result of anaesthesia and lung collapse during CPB, and i lung water secondary to the inflammatory response. Relatively large doses of opioid drugs may be used during cardiac anaesthesia which may result in postoperative respiratory depression. Conversely, pain contributes to atelectasis and impaired gas exchange.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Urine output and fluid balance</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Patients have significant fluid derangements as a result of CPB. There is a fluid load as a result of the pump-prime which leads to an increase in total body fluid. However, the intravascular space may be depleted as a result of capillary leak. The kidneys are at risk of insult from CPB. There is a tradition of giving the osmotic diuretic mannitol during bypass to promote clearance of excess fluid. This leads to high postoperative urine volumes in the first few hours after surgery. However, at the same time patients commonly require a positive fluid balance to maintain pre-load because of inflammatory activation.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Pain</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Pain immediately after median sternotomy is generally less problematic than after major abdominal surgery and can be managed by a range of appropriate techniques.
</div>
</details>



<details class="med-details">
<summary>Cardiac function</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Cardiac contractility may be adversely affected by ischaemia during bypass or intraoperative handling and by reperfusion injury (stunning). This process may worsen in the first few hours after surgery.
</div>
</details>



<details class="med-details">
<summary>Bleeding</summary>
<div class="details-content">

CPB is associated with abnormal haemostasis through a series of mechanisms involving coagulopathy, i fibrinolysis, haemodilution, and qualitative and quantitative platelet dysfunction. Only a minority of patients will have a clinically significant lesion.

<summary>Typical progression</summary>
<div class="details-content">

The following represents patients following a traditional progression. This may be modified by modern enhanced recovery techniques.

### On admission

- Large core-peripheral gradient (10°C)
- Polyuric
- Deeply sedated
- Fully ventilated

- Supine position
- High/normal blood glucose
- May be relatively bradycardic and pacing dependent.

### First hour

- Increasing core temp (0.5–2°C over the hour)
- Core-peripheral gradient remains high
- May shiver
- High urine output (100-300mL/h)
- Remains sedated
- Gas exchange stable
- Drain loss up to 200mL
- Variable pressor support but often tendency to hypotension requiring moderate volume transfusion 500–1000mL (± low-dose pressors)
- May have increasing or decreasing inotrope requirements
- May require insulin to control blood glucose
- Falling K+ requires supplementation.

### **1-4 hours**

- Rewarmed to 36.8°
- Core-peripheral gradient normalized (<3°C)
- Urine output tapering to normal (0.5–1mL/kg/hour)
- Sat up >30°: gas exchange stable or improving with posture change
- Stabilized blood pressure (BP) with

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Routine management</summary>
<div class="details-content">

The majority of patients require minimal intervention and are best served by following routine protocols.


<details class="med-details">
<summary>Ventilation</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Patients are usually ventilated for several hours after cardiac surgery. Typical ventilator settings employ relatively low tidal volumes (0.7mL/kg) with a small amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) (5cm H<sub>2</sub>O) to counteract atelectasis. Patients are weaned onto a spontaneous breathing mode as soon as possible. Patients should be extubated once they reach the required criteria and do not need progressive weaning of mechanical support. A relatively high  CO<sub>2</sub>  is likely to indicate narcosis rather than respiratory muscle insufficiency and may be tolerated if otherwise clinically appropriate.
</div>
</details>



<details class="med-details">
<summary>Extubation criteria</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Awake and responding to requests
- Comfortable
- Sustained spontaneous respirations
- FiO<sub>2</sub> <0.5 with SaO<sub>2</sub> >95%
- CO<sub>2</sub> <7.0kPa
- Core temperature ≥36.8°C
- No excessive blood loss (see Fluid and electrolyte management, p. 9)
- Cardiovascularly stable.
</div>
</details>



<details class="med-details">
<summary>Re-warming</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Re-warming may be passive or aided by warm-air re-warmers.
- Shivering should be suppressed by increasing sedation, treating with pethidine 25–50mg IV, or, if severe, by non-depolarizing muscle relaxants (in this case patient must be unconscious).
</div>
</details>



<details class="med-details">
<summary>Inotropes and vasopressors</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Routine patients may require *low dos*es (e.g. up to 0.1mcg/kg/min of adrenaline or noradrenaline or 8mcg/kg/min of dopamine) of inotropes or vasopressors in the first few hours after operation. In general, noradrenalin as a sole agent should be reserved to use in patients with good ventricular function. Inotropes and pressors can often be weaned over the first few hours after operation. Physiological targets vary from patient to patient (see Postoperative hypotension). Relative hypotension can be tolerated if there is good evidence of adequate perfusion (e.g. normal urine output, normal cerebration, good peripheral perfusion).
</div>
</details>



<details class="med-details">
<summary>Fluid and electrolyte management</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Maintain K<sup>+</sup> 4.5–6.0mmol/L
- Insulin to keep glucose management is 5.0–10.0mmol/L (see
  Glucose)
- Colloids as required to maintain pre-load
- Oral fluids once extubated.
- Transfuse packed red cells to keep Hb >70g/dL.
</div>
</details>



<details class="med-details">
<summary>Analgesia and antiemesis</summary>
<div class="details-content">

There is no single agreed optimum postoperative analgesic regimen. An acceptable approach includes the following elements:

- Opioids titrated to effect
- Antiemetics (e.g. ondansetron 0mg IV, buccal prochlorperazine 3mg) as required
- Regular paracetamol g 6-hourly.
