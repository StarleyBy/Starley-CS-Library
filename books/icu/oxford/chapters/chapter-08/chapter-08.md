<div class="details-content">
Acid–base biochemistry, lactate metabolism, and even glucose metabolism are complex. In an individual patient it may be difficult to interpret with certainty the precise mechanisms underlying the measured trends. Nevertheless, these measurements are useful as indicators of potential physiological derangement, as guides to treatment, and as indicators of prognosis.

Despite the underlying complexity, a pragmatic approach extracts most of the immediate clinical value from the data with remarkably little mental effort.

<div class="details-content">

Hydrogen ion concentration in living tissue is tightly controlled because small changes in hydrogen ion concentration can have large qualitative and quantitative changes on a myriad of metabolic reactions. Plasma hydrogen ion concentration, which equates to extracellular fluid hydrogen ion concentration, is the only hydrogen ion concentration amenable to easy measurement. However this reflects only one physiological compartment and in particular, does not give reliable information about what is happening intracellularly.

pH is a traditional notation for hydrogen ion concentration that derives from the physical sciences and has become embedded in biological culture largely through historical custom. It is the negative logarithm of the actual hydrogen ion concentration and is useful for describing changes across large ranges. It is a non-linear scale. Hydrogen ion concentration [H<sup>+</sup>] is better for describing changes in the relevant clinical range.

The hydrogen ion concentration in an aqueous solution reflects the degree of dissociation of water. It is influenced by dissolved ions, by temperature and by buffers.

There are two common ways of conceptualizing the control of hydrogen ions in biological solutions. These are the traditional Henderson—Hasselbalch or bicarbonate-centred framework, and the Stewart (strong ion) hypothesis. In practice and mathematically these descriptions are equivalent. Strong ion theory is useful because it provides an immediate conceptual explanation for the clinical importance of chloride ions and other phenomena such as dilution acidosis. It does not, however, lend itself to easy calculation and the verity of its claims to provide insights into the causal mechanisms of hydrogen ion concentration remains debatable and experimentally unproven.

<summary>Stewart hypothesis</summary>
<div class="details-content">

The hydrogen ion concentration of an aqueous biological solution is determined only by three variables from which it may be derived by a fourth-order polynomial equation. These are: [SID],  [A<sub>ToT</sub>], and  PCO<sub>2</sub>, where [SID], the strong ion difference is the difference in the net charge concentration (mmol/L) of the fixed cations and anions fully dissociated in solution, [A<sub>ToT</sub>]  is the concentration of partially dissociated weak acids (albumin, other serum proteins and inorganic phosphate), and  PCO<sub>2</sub>  is the partial pressure of dissolved  CO<sub>2</sub>.

Since [SID] is given by

  [SID] = [Na<sup>+</sup>] + [K<sup>+</sup>] + [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] + Mg<sup>2+</sup>] - [C<sup>-</sup>] - [other strong anions]

It is easy to see (at least qualitatively) how hyperchloraemia (relative to  [Na<sup>+</sup>]) is associated with acidosis and hypochloraemia is associated with alkalosis. Similarly it can be seen that changes in plasma volume due to dehydration or dilution will change the absolute size of the strong ion difference with resultant effects on plasma  [H<sup>+</sup>] .

<summary>Blood gas analysis</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Clinical blood gas analysis is based on the bicarbonate-centred approach. It assumes plasma acidity is determined by the concentration of volatile acid  CO<sub>2</sub>  and the concentration of non-volatile acids (all other acids apart from  CO<sub>2</sub>).

An acid tendency caused by excess  CO<sub>2</sub>  is termed a respiratory acidosis. An alkaline tendency caused by lack of  CO<sub>2</sub>  is termed a respiratory alkalosis. Similarly the effects of excess or deficiency of non-volatile acids are termed metabolic acidosis and alkalosis respectively. These effects may compensate for each other and a combination of metabolic and respiratory effects is often present. Resultant changes in the actual  H<sup>+</sup>  are termed acidaemia (high  H<sup>+</sup>) and alkalaemia (low  H<sup>+</sup>).

An effective approach to blood gas analysis may be based on three key variables:  H<sup>+</sup> , SBE (the standard base excess), and PCO<sub>2</sub>

Respiratory acidosis is caused by accumulation of  CO<sub>2</sub>  in the plasma.  CO<sub>2</sub>  is acidic because it forms carbonic acid:

CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> = H<sup>+</sup> + HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>
 (Eqn 8.1)

The  PCO<sub>2</sub> defines the size of the respiratory acidosis or alkalosis. High  PCO<sub>2</sub>  indicates respiratory acidosis, low  PCO<sub>2</sub>  indicates respiratory alkalosis.

 CO<sub>2</sub>  is the end product of metabolism and is excreted through the lungs. Excess  CO<sub>2</sub>  thus occurs as a result of  ↑  production or  ↓  clearance. The commonest cause of  ↓  clearance in the early postoperative period is opioid—mediated respiratory depression (this contrasts with the sick patient who has been ventilated for a longer period where mechanical respiratory insufficiency and poor gas exchange are likely to be important factors.) The treatment is adjustment of analgesia  ±  temporary prolongation of mechanical support. The commonest cause of  ↑  production in the early postoperative period is shivering.

Consider shivering as a cause of respiratory acidosis in the re-warming patient. Treat with pethidine (25mg IV repeated once if necessary) escalating to  ↑  sedation in the intubated patient and, if still problematic, neuromuscular blockade (only in anaesthetized patients).

<summary>Metabolic acidosis</summary>
<div class="details-content">

  SBE, the standard base excess, defines the size of the *metabolic* acidosis or alkalosis.

SBE is the amount of acid or alkali required to titrate the extracellular fluid [H<sup>+</sup>] back to normal in the presence of a normal pCO<sub>2</sub> . The term 'standard' refers to the fact that the value is corrected for the buffering effect of haemoglobin so as to estimate the base excess for whole body extracellular fluid (ECF) rather than the base excess of the plasma in the sample. By convention, base excess is described as mEq/L of alkali so a negative base excess is an acidosis.

The key importance of a metabolic acidosis is in the diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause. Important causes of metabolic acidosis in the early postoperative period include low CO (often accompanied by high lactate) and renal insufficiency (failure of H<sup>+</sup> excretion: lactate is usually normal). A transient lactic acidosis may develop in the first few postoperative hours in a patient who is otherwise well, particularly in patients receiving exogenous adrenaline.


<details class="med-details">
<summary>Treatment of metabolic acidosis</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Direct treatment of metabolic acidosis by alkali administration in the form of bicarbonate remains controversial. Clinical evidence is lacking. Theoretical arguments are contradictory. A pragmatic approach may be taken:

- Make a careful search for and manage the underlying cause.
- Leave moderate degrees of abnormality (up to about base excess -10) to self-correct.
- In the acidotic patient with acute cardiac decompensation, administering bicarbonate to partially correct the acidosis may increase cardiac contractile force and the efficacy of exogenous inotropes and vasopressors, which might contribute to a virtuous circle of recovery. Give bicarbonate in aliquots of 50–100mmol titrated against blood gas measurements, while monitoring for volume overload. In the ventilated patient, simultaneously increase ventilation to rigorously maintain normocapnia, or mild hypocapnia. CO<sub>2</sub> diffuses freely across cell membranes and the CO<sub>2</sub> load associated with the neutralization of the carbonic acid (see Eqn 8.1) may otherwise worsen intracellular acidosis. The total amount of bicarbonate required to correct an existing acidosis can be calculated from:

Dose (mEq) = 0.3 * weight(Kg) * SBE(mEq/L)  (Eqn 8.2)

Most clinicians would regard total correction as too aggressive.

<summary>Mixed effects</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Metabolic and respiratory acidosis may coexist, e.g. in the unconscious or under-ventilated patient with cardiogenic shock. In this case their effects on [H<sup>+</sup>] will be additive and there will be an acidaemia. The metabolic and respiratory effects may be in opposite directions as the body attempts to normalize the [H<sup>+</sup>], e.g. in the case of prolonged type 2 respiratory failure. In this case the compensation is almost always incomplete and the [H<sup>+</sup>] indicates the direction of the primary abnormality, e.g. if the [H<sup>+</sup>] is high there is a primary acidosis with a compensatory respiratory alkalosis. However the main clue is usually provided by the clinical history.

<summary><span style="font-size:110%">Lactate</span></summary>
<div class="details-content">

Metabolite lactate is formed from pyruvate which is a normal product of metabolism.

Lactate metabolism and its control is complex both at a whole-body level and a cellular level. Changes in concentration may reflect changes in production or changes in removal. A raised plasma lactate is not thought to be harmful in itself. Lactate is formed during anaerobic metabolism in muscles and thus i lactate concentrations may reflect inadequate tissue perfusion, for instance, caused by low CO. However, other causes of raised lactate in the immediate postoperative period include i production due to β<sub>2</sub> receptor stimulation (adrenaline) and the systemic inflammatory response (cytokine-mediated stimulation).

A raised or rising lactate should thus precipitate a careful diagnostic review for signs of circulatory insufficiency but, by itself, is not diagnostic of an adverse situation. It is usefully reassuring if the lactate concentration is normal.

A high lactate (>3mmol/L) at entry to intensive care is associated with a raised mortality in observational studies.

<div class="details-content">

Blood glucose concentration rises during and after cardiac surgery due to stress response and exogenous beta stimulation. There is no strong evidence for treating blood glucose after cardiac surgery differently than in other critical care situations. Glucose should be kept in the range 3.5–10.0mmol/L using continuous infusion of insulin adjusted according to a protocol. The main danger of tighter control is hypoglycaemia. The causal relationship between high blood glucose and lactataemia is
unclear. An important feature of glucose control is keeping input constant. Enteral or parenteral feeding should thus be administered continuously over 24 hours. If feeding is interrupted for any reason insulin infusions should be stopped or reduced and glucose concentration monitored closely.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Terminology</summary>
<div class="details-content">
Whole blood glucose concentrations differ from plasma values, because the concentration in whole red cells is lower due to their high lipid content.
Whole blood concentrations can be converted to plasma concentrations by multiplying by 1.1 at normal haematocrit. Since 2001, all laboratory and
point-of-care resting values should be reported as plasma concentrations regardless of the actual method of measurement.
