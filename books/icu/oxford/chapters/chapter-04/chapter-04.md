# **Cardiac Surgery Advanced Life Support**

The Cardiac Surgery Advanced Life Support (CALS) course was developed in response to recognized differences which are required for management of arrested patients post sternotomy in contrast to standard European Resuscitation Council (ERC) Advanced Life Support (ALS) guidelines. CALS forms the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) guidelines.

These modifications to standard ALS have now been taken on by the ERC and incorporated into the 'Special Situation – post cardiac surgery' section. The following text therefore relates only to patients up to 0 days post sternotomy who arrest on a cardiac ICU (CICU).

# **Differences from 'standard' ward arrest**

- Many more available skilled staff members.
- Arrest is identified immediately.
- Much wider range of possible therapies.
- Patient is often highly monitored and intubated.
- Chest re-opening is a standard part of resuscitation—indeed when considering the 4Hs and 4Ts in the post-sternotomy setting all are resolved by chest opening as the cause of arrest on the CICU is often mechanical, e.g. tamponade, blown graft, loss of pacing.

## **Key components of arrest management**

- Early identification of patient pre-arrest.
- Key specific roles for team members on arrival at scene.
- Adoption of modified protocol regarding defibrillation/drugs (see Fig. 4.).
- Use of simplified chest opening kit.
- Use of 'all in one' sterile drape (central adhesive window)—no prep to wound.
- Successful outcome in 48% if chest opened rapidly.

# **Key specific roles and modifications from 'standard' ALS** See Fig. 4.2.

### *Identification of arrest*

- Do not be sidetracked by monitor traces!
- Defibrillate or pace before massage if equipment at bedside.
- Efficacy of massage can be judged from A line trace.
- Switch intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) to pressure mode.

#### *Airway role*

• Identification of tension pneumothorax may be difficult in a noisy ICU environment.

#### *Defibrillation*

- In ventricular fibrillation (VF) three shocks are administered before chest opening—anticipate the need for internal paddles.
- Asystole—attach pacer, DDD, rate 90, maximum output, anticipate the need for internal wires.
- Pulseless electrical activity (PEA)—turn off pacer to unmask covert VF.

## *Team leader*

- Make early decision to open chest.
- Gown and glove, rapidly minimal (if any) hand wash.
- Do not apply cleaning agents to wound—these work by drying and delay opening.
- Apply 'all-in-one drape' to patient after massager has removed wound dressing.
- Massage over sterile dressing until chest opening kit delivered.
- Open chest, deliver internal massage/shocks, identify cause of arrest.

#### *Drugs*

• Do *NOT* give adrenaline (will cause catastrophic hypertension once tamponade relieved). Stop all infusions especially if drug error a possibility.

# *Coordinator role*

- Coordinate sending for help.
- Assist others to rapidly gown and deliver opening kit.

# **Pitfalls of chest opening**

- Note scalpel cannot be packaged in a sterile kit—use disposable scalpel.
- Chest opening itself is harmless—even without sternal retraction tamponade may be resolved.
- Internal massage can carry hazards—avoid dislodging left internal mammary artery (LIMA), grafts, and pacing wires.
- Only use two-handed technique—one placed gently posterior to LV.
- Single-handed technique may result in thumb through right ventricle (RV) or annular disruption!

#### **Six key roles in the cardiac arrest:**

- 1. External cardiac massage
  - 2. Airway and breathing
    - 3. Debrillation
    - 4. Team leader
- 5. Drugs and syringe drivers 6. ICU co-ordinator
