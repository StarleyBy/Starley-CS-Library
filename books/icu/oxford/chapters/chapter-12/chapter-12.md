<summary>Introduction</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a clinical condition comprising respiratory distress, hypoxaemia refractory to oxygen, ↓ lung compliance, and the appearance of diffuse infiltrates on a CXR.

<summary>Definition</summary>
<div class="details-content">

ARDS is the severe form of a disease spectrum that occurs in the lungs of critically ill patients. Acute lung injury (ALI) is the 'milder' form of the spectrum and although it has a similar pathogenesis, it has a better outcome.

The diagnostic criteria for ALI/ARDS are as follows:

- The onset is acute
- The presence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on a CXR
- The pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) is ≤18mmHg or no clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension
- In ALI the PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>3</sub> ratio is <40 (300mmHg)</li>
- In ARDS the PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio is <27 (200mmHg).</li>

The Murray Lung Injury Score can stratify severe acute respiratory failure (Table 12.1).

<summary>Incidence</summary>
<div class="details-content">

The reported incidence of ALI varies widely; incidence ranging from 16–34 per 100000 person-years in Europe and Australia whereas in the US the incidence is 78 per 100000 person-years.

Two decades ago the mortality ranged from 50–70% but has since declined and is now in the region of 30–40%. This is similar in patients who present with ALI or ARDS. The cause for the decline is not entirely clear but advances in general supportive care and the use of ventilatory strategies may account for the change.

<summary>Risk factors</summary>
<div class="details-content">

There is a probable genetic predisposition with higher death rates in African Americans and males:

- Pulmonary risk factors:
  -  Pneumonia
  -  Aspiration
  -  Lung contusion
  -  Inhalational injury
  -  PE
  -  Drowning
- Extrapulmonary risk factors:
  -  Sepsis
  -  Shock
  -  Trauma
  -  Pancreatitis
  -  Blood transfusion
  -  CPB.

In recent years transfusion-related ALI (TRALI) and novel viral pathogens (severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS) have emerged as important risk factors for the development of ALI.

<summary>Pathophysiology</summary>
<div class="details-content">

<details class="med-details">
<summary>The acute phase</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Disruption of the normal alveolar–capillary barrier allowing protein-rich fluid to leak into alveoli; neutrophils, red blood cells, and fibroblasts all enter alveoli.
- Pro-inflammatory cytokines are secreted by alveolar macrophages.
- Anti-inflammatory cytokines are also found in the alveoli, but in ALI/ ARDS the balance is disrupted and the pro-inflammatory effect predominates.
- Other mechanisms in the acute phase involve coagulation abnormalities leading to microvascular occlusion in the lungs due to platelet and fibrin-rich thrombi and abnormal fibrinolysis.
</div>
</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>The resolution phase</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Depends on repair of the alveolar epithelium and removal of the protein-rich fluid from the alveolar space.
- Proliferation of type II cells occurs which then differentiate into type I cells.
- Removal of alveolar fluid dependent on active transport of sodium via type II cells, and then water follows by osmosis via channels on type I cells.
- Insoluble proteins removed by macrophages and neutrophil clearance may be by apoptosis.
</div>
</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Fibrosing alveolitis</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Associated with a higher mortality.
- May begin as early as days after onset of ALI/ARDS.
- Alveolar spaces get filled with inflammatory cells, fibrin, collagen, and blood vessels leading to fibrosis.
</div>
</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Management</summary>
<div class="details-content">

The management of ALI/ARDS is aimed at:

- Identifying and treating the underlying cause:
  -  Consider antimicrobial therapy
  -  Consider surgical drainage of an intra-abdominal collection
  - Removal of invasive lines in the case of a catheter-related blood stream infection
- Providing supportive care:
  -  Adequate nutrition
  - Stress ulcer prophylaxis
  - DVT prophylaxis
  - Haemodynamic management
  - Optimal fluid management remains unclear. Conservative strategy associated with improved lung function and ↓ duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care
- Maintaining oxygenation using a protective ventilatory strategy.
   Ventilating at high tidal volumes (volutrauma) and pressures (barotrauma) can cause disruption of the alveolar—capillary interface; biotrauma (the release of inflammatory cytokines from neutrophils) is due to shearing forces as collapsed alveoli are repeatedly opened and closed and can lead to distant organ damage:
  - The ARDSnet group have published a table looking at the combinations of FiO<sub>2</sub> and PEEP for maintaining arterial oxygenation in ARDS (Table 12.2)
- Achieving PaO<sub>2</sub> >8kPa or SpO<sub>2</sub> 88–95%.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Lung-protective strategies</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- FiO<sub>2</sub>: accept a PaO<sub>2</sub> >8kPa. Prolonged high concentrations of oxygen can contribute to lung injury due to oxygen toxicity
- PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) improves oxygenation by recruiting collapsed alveoli, improving ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) matching, and reducing intrapulmonary shunt.
- Low tidal volume ventilation:
  - Maintain a tidal volume of 6mL/kg using predicted body weight
  - Keep the peak airway pressure <30cmH<sub>2</sub>O
  - Permissive hypercapnia (pH >7.1).

<summary>Alternative strategies for improving profound hypoxaemia</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Recruitment manoeuvres (RM) and high PEEP:
  - The aim is to open up previously collapsed and flooded alveoli which should lead to improved oxygenation and a reduction in ventilator-induced lung injury from the shear stresses from repetitive opening and closing of alveoli.
  -  However, 'normal' alveoli will be subjected to the risk of overdistension and damage and there is a possibility of haemodynamic compromise.
  - RM with high PEEP or high PEEP alone is best considered early in ARDS with severe hypoxaemia when plateau airway pressures are
  - Do not consider these strategies in patients with pneumothoraces or when the disease is focal.
- Prone positioning:
  - V/Q mismatch is improved by recruiting dependent atalectatic lung areas.
  - Oxygenation does improve, but there is no clear evidence that mortality is reduced.
  - There are technical difficulties associated with turning patients, such as accidental dislodgement of invasive catheters and endotracheal/ tracheostomy tubes as well as the risk of pressure ulcers and facial
- High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV):
  - Uses high airway pressure to achieve lung recruitment and thus improve oxygenation.
  - An oscillating piston creates cycles of pressure above and below the mean airway pressure at a high frequency with small tidal volumes.
  - Should not be used in patients with shock, airway obstruction, intracranial haemorrhage, or refractory barotrauma.
  - Sedation is needed and severe acidosis may occur due to limited CO<sub>2</sub> excretion.

- Inhaled nitric oxide:
  - A potent vasodilator which promotes the distribution of blood flow towards ventilated portions of the lung minimizing V/Q mismatch and improving oxygenation.
  - Little systemic absorption and rapidly inactivated.
- Steroids:
  - Steroids could stop the progression to severe ALI/ARDS by inhibiting neutrophil activation, collagen deposition, and the proliferation of fibroblasts.
  - Clinical trials have failed to show a benefit to patients given steroids in early ALI and an ↑ mortality was noted in patients given steroids after 14 days of diagnosis.
  - Routine use is not to be recommended but could be considered in life-threatening hypoxaemia when other measures have failed.
  - Low dose of methylprednisolone (1mg/kg/day) should be used, and stopped if no improvement occurs after 3 days.
- Extracorporeal lung support (ECLS):
  - Veno-venous life support circuit that removes blood from the patient and circulates it through a membrane oxygenator providing gaseous exchange and allowing the lungs to recover. There are two main types of ECLS that have been used: extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) which is a modified form of cardiopulmonary bypass and extracorporeal CO, removal.
  - The main risks are due to the need for anticoagulation and large-bore central venous cannulae. The CESAR trial (Conventional ventilation or ECMO for severe adult respiratory failure) showed an improvement in the survival and absence of severe disability at 6 months in the intervention group.
  - ECMO or extracorporeal CO<sub>2</sub> removal should only be considered when all other therapies have failed and at a centre with experience in extracorporeal lung support. It should not be used in patients with contraindications to anticoagulation and in those patients ventilated with high airway pressures for >7 days.

<summary><span style="font-size:110%">Ventilator-associated pneumonia</span></summary>
<div class="details-content">

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Definition</summary>
<div class="details-content">

NICE defines ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) as 'pneumonia which develops 48 hours or more after intubation with an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube, and which was not present before':

- In the US up to 30% of ventilated ITU patients have a VAP.
- Patients who develop VAP have significantly longer duration of mechanical ventilation and ITU stay.
- Mortality is ↑ in patients by 30% if they have a VAP and can reach more than 70% if multiresistant pathogens are involved.
</div>
</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Diagnosis</summary>
<div class="details-content">

VAP is a difficult diagnosis to make. Ideally clinical and radiological signs and positive microbiology will all coincide. Clinical signs may be non-specific, radiological signs may also be non-specific and lag behind clinical changes. Microbiological confirmation will be affected by:

- Sampling technique:
  -  Sputum sample
  -  Tracheal aspirate
  -  Bronchoalveolar lavage
  -  Protected specimen brush
- Recent antimicrobial therapy
- Pathogenicity of organisms
- Culture technique; quantitative vs non-quantitative.

A pragmatic approach used in Scottish ICUs is:

- The presence of new or persistent infiltrates on CXR and any 2 of:
  -  Febrile >38°C
  -  Leucocytosis or leukopenia ( >11 or <3.5)
  -  Purulent tracheobronchial secretions.
</div>
</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Aetiology</summary>
<div class="details-content">

The micro-organisms responsible for VAP vary according to the population of patients in the ITU, the duration of hospital and ITU stays, and the diagnostic method used:

-  Aerobic Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) are responsible for around 60% of VAP. The predominant GNB were *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and *Acinetobacter* spp. followed by *Proteus*, *Escherichia coli, Klebsiella*, and *Haemophilus influenzae*.
- Gram-positive pneumonias are increasingly seen with *Staphylococcus aureus* being the most common.
- Polymicrobial infection in occurs in 20–50% of VAP.
</div>
</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Pre-disposing factors</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Prolonged antibiotic treatment increases the risk of superinfection with multiresistant organisms and delays the occurrence of nosocomial infection.
- ETT, reintubation, and tracheostomy: the presence of an ETT not only bypasses normal host defences but causes local trauma.

- NG tube, enteral feeding, and supine position.
- Respiratory equipment: ventilator circuits may be a source of bacteria responsible for VAP. The use of heat and moisture exchangers (HMEs) instead of heat humidifiers in suitable patients has been associated with a decrease in the risk of developing VAP
</div>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Prevention—VAP bundle</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- *Elevation of the head of the bed to 35*°*.*
- *Daily 'sedation breaks*' reduce duration of mechanical ventilation.
- *Daily oral care* with chlorhexidine: dental plaque can be a reservoir for potential pathogens that cause VAP.
- *Peptic ulcer prophylaxis*: stress ulceration is the most common cause of GI bleeding in the critically ill and is associated with a 5-fold increase in mortality compared with those ITU patients without bleeding. Although there is a trend towards a lower pneumonia rate in patients treated with sucralfate rather than pH altering drugs, H<sub>2</sub> blockers were more effective in preventing peptic ulcer disease and so are the preferred agents.
- *DVT prophylaxis:* this is an appropriate intervention in all sedentary patients.
