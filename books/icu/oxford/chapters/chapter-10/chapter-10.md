### **Introduction**

Effective *communication* is an essential part of good team work which in turn helps set the scene for optimizing *patient safety*. Most human errors are not the result of poor technical knowledge or ability but are due instead to 'non-technical' aspects of performance such as communication.

Within a multidisciplinary team and between different tiers of a clinical team effective communication can be problematic, with differing communication styles complicated by hierarchical, ethnic, and gender influences.

Effective handover communication is vital at initial admission, staff changeovers, and on discharge from the cardiothoracic ICU. Within an intensive care environment a single patient's care may be 'handed over' within the multidisciplinary team over 5 times within any single 24-hour period.

Missing or incomplete information during admission or subsequent handover is a common cause of error and patient harm.

During the handover of information distractions or interruptions increase cognitive demands leading to inefficiency and an i risk of error. This cognitive stress may be exacerbated when the patient is acutely unwell.

Good situation awareness and effective role and task allocation start with effective communication.

Handovers require the concise transfer of accurate and relevant patient information. This process can be aided by a *standardized written handover sheet* which details the objective clinical data. The *verbal handover* should include a short summary and highlight areas of clinical concern, outstanding tasks or plans, and take place between all health professionals of the same discipline or between different disciplines. There is no need to verbally repeat all the clinical data on the handover sheet as this will only increase the cognitive demands on the recipient.

One method of enabling effective handover is using a modified *SBAR tool*, developed by Kaiser Permanente, which is an easy focused way of setting expectations of a response that is appropriate and timely. SBAR encompasses the following:

- Situation:
  - • Identify self, patient, bed space
  - • Briefly state current issues and duration
- Background:
  - • Diagnosis
  - • Number of days in ICU
  - • Current respiratory support
  - • Current drug therapies
  - • Relevant recent vital signs
  - • Relevant lab results
- Assessment:
  - • What do you think is going on?
  - • What is your opinion?
- Response:
  - • What actions are required?
  - • Over what timescale?

### **ICU admission**

#### **Preparation for the patient's arrival**

- ICU multidisciplinary team brief/planning and role allocation
- Equipment ready and checked
- Infusions prepared
- Handover sheet from theatre with relevant patient information including endotracheal tube (ETT) sizing, lines, inotropes, etc.

#### **Patient arrival in ICU**

- Patient monitoring transfer
- Patient support transfer (ventilator, inotropes, drain suction)
- Verbal handover:
  - • One voice, *all* team watching and listening
  - • No other tasks undertaken during handover
  - • Clear and concise handover
  - • SBAR technique
  - • Handover sheet allows handover to be more subjective
- Encourage questions from all staff groups at end
- Summarize plans at end.

#### **Post handover**

- ICU team task allocation
- Appropriate investigations
- Multidisciplinary review of care plan.

## **Shift handover and ICU discharge**

Written handover information can be used to provide the objective clinical data with the more subjective clinical impression and outstanding tasks being delineated by the following SBAR format.

- Situation:
  - • Concise summary
  - • Patient name
  - • Primary diagnosis
  - • Bed space
  - • Age
  - • Weight
- Background:
  - • Diagnoses
  - • Length of stay
  - • Systems-based concise review
  - • Current therapies
- Assessment:
  - • Current issues in a system•based approach
- Response:
  - • Outstanding tasks and timescale
  - • Clinical teams involved.

### **Conclusion**

Effective and efficient communication plays a central role if excellent multidisciplinary care is to be delivered in any ICU.

Written and verbal communication can work hand in hand to allow such communication and care planning. The written data should provide the hard facts and the verbal handover, using an SBAR format, allows participants to focus on the pertinent facts, tasks, and areas of clinical concerns.

All disciplines in the ICU should continually be seeking to improve the care delivered. By taking a short period of time to think about how we all handover information at each stage of the patient's journey we have the potential to ensure that the patient's safety is paramount and optimal and timely care is delivered.
