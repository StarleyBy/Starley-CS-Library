Postoperative critical care involves getting the basics right, attention to detail, and avoidance of omissions. Most postoperative medications are prescribed according to a standard protocol (see example protocol in Table 9.). Cardiac surgical patients are commonly on numerous medications some of which must be continued into the postoperative period and others which should be stopped. This chapter covers the common drugs prescribed in the postoperative period after cardiac surgery.


<details class="med-details">
<summary>Antibiotic prophylaxis</summary>
<div class="details-content">

• Prophylaxis against surgical site infection is routinely continued into the postoperative period. Local policies will vary. These are generally not continued beyond 24 hours after surgery. See 📖 Antimicrobial therapy.
</div>
</details>



<details class="med-details">
<summary>Stress ulcer prophylaxis</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Prophylaxis is essential in patients mechanically ventilated for >48 hours.
- The combination of major surgery, hypoperfusion, systemic anticoagulation, and potential coagulopathy makes patients high risk for development of stress ulcers—prophylaxis is started preoperatively.
</div>
</details>


<details class="med-details">
<summary>Electrolytes</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia are common in the postoperative period and put patients at ↑ risk of arrhythmia.
- Plasma potassium should be maintained >4.0mmol/L, or >4.5mmol/L if arrhythmias are present.
- IV magnesium is a safe and effective antiarrhythmic agent and is commonly used to prevent postoperative arrhythmias:
  - • Caution: rapid infusion of magnesium can cause hypotension and bradycardia.
</div>
</details>



<details class="med-details">
<summary>Antiemetics</summary>
<div class="details-content">

• Should be available as required to treat PONV. Postoperative ileus and opiates may also cause PONV.
</div>
</details>


<details class="med-details">
<summary>Shivering</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Shivering increases oxygen demand and should be avoided.
- Can be due to hypothermia requiring resedation and further warming.
- Postoperative shivering often responds to pethidine.
</div>
</details>


<details class="med-details">
<summary>Glucose control</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Hyperglycaemia is common after cardiac surgery and associated with i mortality and complications in patients both with and without diabetes mellitus.
- Blood glucose should be controlled by using a continuous, IV insulin infusion, e.g. by sliding scale, to maintain median blood glucose control between 3.5mmol/L and 0mmol/L. Perioperative blood glucose control after cardiac surgery reduces mortality:
  - • Caution: avoid hypoglycaemia.
</div>
</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Patients are at risk for DVT due to the procoagulant effect of major surgery, immobility, and the loss of saphenous veins/bandaging of limbs.
- Subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is delayed until postoperative day because of the risks of bleeding associated with cardiopulmonary bypass and cardiac surgery:
  - • e.g. dalteparin 5000IU SC once daily.
</div>
</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation) prophylaxis</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Early postoperative administration of β-blockers in patients without contraindications is standard therapy to reduce the incidence and/or clinical sequelae of atrial fibrillation. (Usually started on 1 postoperative day in patients not receiving inotropes — see b Secondary prevention, p. 70.)
- Amiodarone is effective prophylaxis for high-risk patients with contraindications to β-blockers.
</div>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Prevention of coronary graft thrombosis</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Aspirin is the drug of choice for prophylaxis against early saphenous vein graft (SVG) thrombosis and should be given 6 hours post-operatively or as soon as bleeding has ceased:
  - • e.g. aspirin 300mg PR (continued at 75mg PO daily long term).
  - • The benefit of postoperative aspirin on SVG patency is lost when started >48 hours after surgery.
- Clopidogrel is an acceptable alternative to aspirin for the maintenance of graft patency in patients intolerant of aspirin:
  - • Superiority over aspirin has not been established.
  - • Patients on long-term dual therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel), e.g. stents, should have the dual therapy recommenced.
</div>
</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Secondary prevention (postoperative day onwards)</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- It is indicated to start and continue β-blocker therapy in all patients after MI, ACS, or LV dysfunction, unless contraindicated (see ERC/EACTS guidelines).
- β-blockers should be recommenced or considered for all patients without contraindications:
  - • Contraindications: asthma or bronchospasm, HR <60bpm or pacemaker-dependent, BP <100mmHg systolic, or on inotropes.
  - • Dose started low followed by upward dose titration.
  - • e.g. bisoprolol 1.25mg PO daily.
- ACE inhibitors should be started and continued indefinitely in all patients with LVEF <40% and for those with hypertension, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease, unless contraindicated.
- ACE inhibitors should be gradually recommenced/considered in all patients (particularly patients with evidence of LV dysfunction):
  - • Contraindications: acute or unstable renal impairment, BP <100mmHg systolic, or on inotropes.
  - • e.g. ramipril 2.5mg PO daily.
- Statins should be recommenced or introduced in all patients:
  - • Contraindications: acute liver disease, persistently abnormal liver function tests.
  - • e.g. Simvastatin 40mg PO nocte.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Prevention of coronary graft spasm</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Radial artery grafts are particularly prone to spasm therefore vasodilators are commonly used:
  - • e.g. glyceryl trinitrate –5mg/hour IV starting intraoperatively.
  - • e.g. amlodipine 5mg PO daily continued for 3–6 months.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Medication following valve surgery</summary>
<div class="details-content">

#### *Prevention of valve thrombosis*

- All patients with mechanical valves require anticoagulation.
- Bioprosthetic valves have an ↑ risk of thromboemboli during the first 3 months.
- Oral anticoagulation is recommended for the following situations:
  - • Lifelong for all patients with mechanical valves irrespective of valve type or date of introduction.
  - • Lifelong for patients with bioprostheses or mitral repair who have other indications for anticoagulation, e.g. atrial fibrillation and impaired LV function.
  - • For the first 3 months, in all patients with bioprostheses or mitral valve repair involving the use of a prosthetic annuloplasty ring. (There is widespread use of aspirin as an alternative to anticoagulation for the first 3 months in patients with no other indications for anticoagulation.)
- Target INR depends on valve position, risk of thrombosis, and type of valve (see Table 9.2).
- Warfarin should be commenced on postoperative day unless chest drains remain *in situ* for bleeding.
  
<h4>Table 9.2. Target INR following valve surgery</h4>


|  |                |  |
|-------------------------------------------------|----------------|--|
| Mechanical aortic: no risk factors             | 2.5/3.0/3.5    |  |
| —low/medium/high-risk valve                    |                |  |
| Mechanical aortic: with risk factors           | 3.0/3.5/4.0    |  |

| Bioprosthesis: aortic—no risk factors          | Aspirin only   |  |
| Bioprosthesis: aortic—risk factors             | 2.5 (3 months) |  |
| Bioprosthesis: mitral                           | 2.5 (3 months)  |  |

- <em>Risk factors</em>: atrial fibrillation, left atrium >50mm, ejection fraction <35%, additional valve replacements, hypercoagulability, history of thromboembolism.

- <em>Valve risk</em>: 
  - • low risk: Medtronic Hall, St Jude, Carbomedics. 
  - • medium risk: bileaflet valves with insufficient data, Bjork–Shiley.

<summary>Epilepsy</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Generalized seizures occurring in the perioperative period can increase morbidity and mortality, thus patients with pre-existing seizure disorders require anticonvulsant medications to be continued.
- Many antiepileptic drugs are available as a suspension that can be given via NG tube. Phenytoin, valproate, and levetiracetam are available parenterally. Carbamazepine can be given PR. There are no parenteral forms of gabapentin, topiramate, or lamotrigine—patients taking these medications in which the oral route is contraindicated require conversion to an alternative agent in consultation with a neurologist.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Parkinson's disease</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Liaison with specialist services is advised preoperatively.
- Adequate antiparkinsonian therapy is essential for satisfactory postoperative respiratory and bulbar muscle function.
- Dopaminergic drugs should be restarted as soon as possible postoperatively to reduce the risk of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (secondary to acute withdrawal).
- Many dopamine receptor agonists and levodopa/decarboxylase combinations can be administered via NG tube. Subcutaneous apomorphine or topical preparations of rotigotine (Neupro<sup>®</sup>) are available for patients in whom the oral route is contraindicated.
- Caution is required when prescribing other drugs—phenothiazines, butyrophenones, metoclopramide, and clonidine should be avoided.
</div>
</details>



<details class="med-details">
<summary>Myasthenia gravis</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Careful management of anticholinesterase medication is essential to avoid myasthenic crisis and respiratory failure postoperatively.
- Anticholinesterases can be administered via NG tube and are usually restarted when the patient is haemodynamically stable, prior to weaning from mechanical ventilation and at the patient's usual dose.
- If the oral route is contraindicated, IV neostigmine is substituted for pyridostigmine at /30th the usual oral dose.
- Many drugs can worsen muscular weakness in myasthenia gravis. Aminoglycoside antibiotics should be avoided.
- Caution: patients with myasthenia gravis are often on corticosteroid therapy and will require additional supplementation.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Corticosteroids</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Patients taking chronic glucocorticoid therapy require perioperative supplementation due to suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis.

- Patients taking >10mg prednisolone per day or who have stopped therapy <3 months ago are at risk.
- For major surgery, in addition to a bolus at induction of anaesthesia, patients require IV hydrocortisone 25–50mg 3 times a day for 48–72 hours postoperatively. Patients with high vasopressor requirement may require a prolonged course.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Drugs for diabetes mellitus</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Generally speaking, IV insulin infusions are continued until patients are eating and drinking when preoperative oral hypoglycaemics/SC insulins are recommenced:

- *Type (and type 2 patients on insulin)*: long-acting insulins are withheld and total daily insulin requirement is administered as short-acting Actrapid<sup>®</sup> insulin (in 3–4 divided doses) until blood glucose is stable. Long-acting agents are then reintroduced.
- *Type 2:* caution should be exercised with certain drugs:
  - • Sulfonylureas stimulate insulin secretion and may cause hypoglycaemia. Patients on high doses should start low and titrate upwards.
  - • Metformin should not be restarted in patients with renal insufficiency, significant hepatic impairment, or congestive heart failure.
  - • Thiazolidinediones should not be restarted in patients with congestive cardiac failure, problematic fluid retention, or liver function abnormalities.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Drugs for psychiatric disorders</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Can generally be restarted on postoperative day . Caution is required with the following:

- Drugs prolonging QT-interval (particularly in association with class III antiarrhythmics).
- Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in combination with other drugs affecting serotonin levels (e.g. tramadol and ondansetron).
