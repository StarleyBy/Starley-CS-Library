<div class="details-content">

- Delirium is an acute and fluctuating change in cognition characterized by inattention with either a fluctuating level of consciousness or disorganized thinking.
- Part of the spectrum of neuropsychiatric changes commonly seen after cardiac surgery and often referred to as 'pump-head' or post-perfusion syndrome.
- Significant crossover with stroke in terms of risk factors, pathophysiology, and clinical presentation.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Incidence</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Incidence varies depending on the technique used for measurement, the age group assessed and the type of surgery (Table 15.1).

<div class="details-content">

Validated diagnostic

Aetiology of delirium is complex and involves the interaction of the risk factors in Table 15.2 with:

- Pharmacological effects (including anaesthesia, analgesia and drug withdrawal)
- Ischaemia (secondary to embolization and hypoperfusion)
- Inflammation and infection
- Environmental factors (overstimulation and sleep deprivation)
- Pathophysiological effects of CPB are implicated in the aetiology of delirium. However, delirium remains a problem following off-pump surgery
- Underlying neuropathological mechanisms are poorly understood but there is evidence that an imbalance of central neurotransmission including a reduction in cholinergic and an increase in dopaminergic neurotransmission is likely to be important.

<div class="details-content">

- Delirium can be hyperactive (restless, agitated, aggressive), hypoactive (withdrawn, quiet, sleepy) or mixed (Table 15.3).
- Hypoactive or mixed delirium accounts for 75% of cases and has been associated with worse prognosis due to diagnostic delay.
- If delirium is suspected in a patient in critical care, assessment should be done using the validated tool CAM-ICU (Fig. 15.1.).
- Without the use of an appropriate assessment tool, up to 75% of cases of ICU delirium are missed.

<summary>Investigation</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Perform thorough physical examination and review medications.
- Further investigation will be guided by clinical exam but should include bloods (FBC, U&E, LFT, glucose, Ca), ECG, and sepsis screen as a minimum.
- Cerebral imaging is unlikely to affect clinical management in the delirious patient in the absence of focal neurological signs. In addition, sedation may be required to facilitate imaging and can prolong the course of delirium.
</div>
</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Prevention</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- A number of strategies to prevent neurological complications in cardiac surgery have been proposed (see 📖 Neurological complications of cardiac surgery).
- There is a randomized trial that found a reduced incidence of delirium comparing the α<sub>2</sub> agonist dexmedetomidine with benzodiazepines for ICU sedation.
- The 'ABCDE' bundle has been proposed as an evidence-based structured approach to minimizing brain dysfunction in mechanically ventilated ICU patients.
  - *A*wakening and *B*reathing *C*oordination involving spontaneous awakening trials combined with spontaneous breathing trials
  -  *D*elirium monitoring using a validated assessment tool
  -  *E*xercise and Early mobility.

- NICE guideline on delirium advocates a multi-component intervention package in patients identified as at risk of delirium. Care should be taken to:
  -  Provide an appropriately stimulating environment and reorientate as required
  -  Avoid hypoxia
  -  Ensure adequate hydration and avoid constipation
  -  Identify and treat infection
  -  Ensure adequate nutrition
  -  Identify and treat pain
  -  Avoid sleep disturbance
  -  Avoid sensory deprivation by ensuring visual and hearing aids are working
  -  Encourage early mobilization
  -  Review medications and consider side effects.
</div>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Treatment</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Primary strategy is to identify and treat any underlying causes.
- If the patient is distressed then use verbal and non-verbal de-escalation techniques.
- If these are ineffective then consider a short course of haloperidol or second-generation olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone starting at the lowest appropriate dose.
- α<sub>2</sub> agonists are commonly used as second-line treatment. Dexmedetomidine is not licensed in the UK so clonidine is the drug of choice.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Outcomes</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Following cardiac surgery, cerebral complications including delirium have been associated with ↑ ICU and hospital stay and ↑ in-hospital mortality.
- There is evidence that delirium post coronary artery bypass surgery increases the risk of late mortality up to 10 years.
- However, a recent study has shown no ↑ rates of postoperative cognitive decline at 3 months post CABG compared to total hip joint replacement or coronary angiography done without general anaesthesia.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Introduction</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Neurological complications are a major source of morbidity and mortality following cardiac surgery. Present as a spectrum of overlapping disorders, which can be classified as: stroke, encephalopathy (often presenting as neurocognitive deficits including delirium), and peripheral neuropathy.
</div>
</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Stroke</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Stroke is the rapid onset of neurological deficit secondary to infarction or haemorrhage and lasting >24 hours.
- Majority of strokes following cardiac surgery are secondary to infarction.
</div>
</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Incidence</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Significant variation in the reported incidence of perioperative stroke in cardiac surgery.
- Table 15.4 presents data from a large cohort from a single institution and from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons National Adult Cardiac Surgery Database (STS NCD).
- Surgery involving combined procedures, the mitral valve, or the aorta has a particularly high risk of perioperative stroke.

##### Table 15.4 High variation in the incidence of stroke demonstrated in data derived from a single institution and from the STS NCD
  
| Cardiac surgical procedure | STS NCD | Single institution |
|--|--|--|
| CABG  | 1.4%    | 4.1% |
| Valve | 1.6%    | 3.1% |
| CABG/Valve  | 2.9%    | 7.9% |
</div>
</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Risk factors</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- With the exception of female sex, largely represent risk factors for systemic vascular disease:↑ age, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, peripheral vascular disease, previous history of cerebrovascular disease, known atherosclerosis of the ascending aorta or carotids, AF.
- Patients presenting with a recent MI, unstable angina, or moderate to severe LV systolic dysfunction are at ↑ risk.
- Several prediction models exist that account for the additive effect of risk factors in an individual patient.
</div>
</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Pathophysiology</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Stroke can be classified as intraoperative or postoperative depending on whether the deficit is present immediately on waking from anaesthesia.
- Aetiology is likely multifactorial but a primary mechanism is thought to be atheromatous embolism arising from the ascending aorta.
- Cerebral emboli of particulate matter also arise from cardiac thrombi, severely calcified valves, and carotid artery atherosclerosis.
- Gaseous emboli arise from open cardiac chambers, vascular cannulation sites, or arterial anastomoses.
- Cerebral hypoperfusion may contribute to intraoperative stroke by reducing the washout out of embolic material from watershed areas of brain at the borders of vascular territories.
- The inflammatory process and hypercoagulability may contribute to postoperative stroke.
</div>
</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Clinical features</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Depend on the location of brain injury and whether the ischemia is regional or global.
- Any combination of hemiparesis, ataxia, hemisensory loss, visual disturbance, dysarthria, dysphasia, or effects on consciousness or cognition.
</div>
</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Investigation</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Neuroimaging will confirm the diagnosis of ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke. Perform routine investigations to identify aetiological factors and exclude alternative causes of neurological impairment.
- ECG—AF, other arrhythmia.
- Echocardiogram—intracardiac thrombus, new valve pathology.
- Bloods—include FBC, coagulation screen, U&Es, calcium, glucose, LFTs, and thyroid function tests as first line.
- Imaging should be performed as soon as possible to exclude haemorrhage.
- CT will identify about 50% of infarcts.
- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the technique of choice. Diffusion-weighted imaging can detect acute ischemic events related to microemboli. It is more likely to demonstrate multiple lesions in a watershed pattern of distribution than T2 or FLAIR imaging.
</div>
</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Prevention</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- A number of strategies to prevent neurological complications including stroke have been proposed. Evidence supporting individual neuroprotective techniques is sparse.
- Preoperative—combine thorough preoperative assessment with the use of scoring systems to identify high-risk patients and thus focus resources.
- Off-pump surgery—no consensus regarding the avoidance of CPB to reduce the incidence of neurological complications but off-pump surgery can be considered.

- Surgical technique—epiaortic ultrasound guidance and 'no touch technique' may help to reduce aortic atheroma embolization. Use of aortic cannulae with improved flow characteristics and with filters may be beneficial.
- CPB—membrane oxygenators reduce emboli compared to bubble oxygenators. No evidence to support pH over  α -stat management or pulsatile over non-pulsatile flow. Targeting of higher haematocrit (>27%) and higher MAP (minimum >50mmHg) may be beneficial. Hypothermia used for neuroprotection despite conflicting evidence.
- Multimodal neuromonitoring — optimization of intraoperative care using a combination of cerebral monitors such as transcranial Doppler,  electroencephalogram, and cerebral oximetry using near - infrared spectroscopy has been suggested. Cerebral desaturation has been shown to correlate with neurological impairment but protocolized   treatment of desaturations did not improve outcome.
- Pharmacotherapy — no evidence to support the use of any agent for pharmacological neuroprotection. Thiopentone is often used during deep hypothermic circulatory arrest.
- Combined carotid endarterectomy and cardiac surgery — there is no evidence that this approach reduces the risk of stroke in patents with carotid stenosis and outcomes may be worse.
</div>
</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Treatment</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Antiplatelet therapy — shown to be safe and effective at reducing ischaemic complications including stroke following CABG. Aspirin 300mg first-line treatment of acute ischaemic stroke.
- Anticoagulation — should not be used routinely for treatment of acute stroke. If surgically indicated because of prosthetic valve, risk:benefit assessment with surgeon and neurologist.
- IV thrombolysis increasingly used in ischaemic stroke but contraindicated in context of recent surgery.
- Intra-arterial thrombolysis and mechanical clot disruption are under investigation for reperfusion in specific patients.
- Neurosurgical referral if:
  - Large middle cerebral artery infarction for consideration of decompressive craniectomy.
  - Primary intracranial haemorrhage with hydrocephalus.
- Supportive therapy:
  - Supplemental oxygen only if SaO<sub>2</sub> <95%.
  - BP—if hypertensive emergency (target <185/110mmHg).
  - Glycaemic control—hyperglycaemia associated with poor neurological outcome following both cardiac surgery and stroke.
     Blood glucose should be maintained 4–11mmol/L although no evidence that this improves outcome.
  - Temperature—hyperthermia should be avoided due to association with poor outcome following cardiac surgery and stroke.
  - Non-pharmacological DVT prophylaxis.
- Ongoing management of stroke should involve a specialist multi-disciplinary team who can address issues such as nutrition, physiotherapy, and secondary prevention.

</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Outcomes</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Several studies have shown an association with poor outcome and perioperative stroke in cardiac surgery. For example, following CABG stroke was associated with ↑ ICU stay,↑ hospital stay, and ↑ hospital mortality (14.4% vs 2.7%).
