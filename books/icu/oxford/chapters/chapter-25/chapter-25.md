## Intubation

#### Indications for intubation

- Hypoxaemia
- Hypercapnia
- Exhaustion
- To reduce the work of breathing and oxygen consumption
- To protect the airway (reduced GCS score/impaired laryngeal reflexes)
- To treat or prevent obstructed airway
- To facilitate investigations/treatment or critical care transfer.

The decision to institute mechanical ventilation can be difficult. It should be undertaken as a treatment for respiratory failure or critical illness if:

- The patient had an acceptable premorbid quality of life
- There is a reversible cause for the deterioration
- NIV is inappropriate
- The patient consents to the treatment or has not expressed any prior wishes regarding treatment limitation.

## Technique of endotracheal intubation

## Equipment and preparation

- Assess the airway—anticipate difficult intubation where possible.
- Allocate roles to appropriate skilled personnel.
- Have a plan in place for failed intubation.
- Check suction and ventilator or anaesthetic machine.
- Ensure there is an alternative working oxygen supply available.
- Have available a bag/valve/mask, laryngoscope, airway adjuncts, and various ETTs.
- Attach monitoring to Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland (AAGBI) standards: pulse oximeter, non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP), and ECG. Airway gas analysis including end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> and airway pressure monitoring should be available immediately after intubation.
- In critically ill patients, insert an arterial line if time permits.
- Establish IV access with fluid attached.
- Draw up and label drugs of choice and emergency drugs
- Check trolley tips or head of bed able to tilt down
- $\bullet$  Optimize patient position: neck flexed about 35° and head extended 15°. A pillow is required

#### Technique

- Preoxygenate with 100% oxygen with a tight fitting face mask for 3–5 minutes. In emergencies four vital capacity breaths may be used.
- Administer a sleep dose of a preselected IV induction agent followed by either a dose of depolarizing muscle relaxant in a rapid-sequence intubation (RSI) or non-depolarizing muscle relaxant.
- For example: thiopentone 3–7mg/kg followed by suxamethonium 100mg.
- If cricoid pressure is being used in an RSI then this should be applied by a skilled operator before loss of consciousness.

- In critically ill patients, administer an inotrope/vasoconstrictor or vasoconstrictor prophylactically—do not wait for hypotension to develop.
- Once muscle relaxation is established, a curved blade is placed into the right-hand side of the mouth using the left-handed laryngoscope. It is passed over the surface of the tongue and the tip placed between the epiglottis and the base of the tongue.
- The laryngoscope is lifted in the direction of the handle to reveal the glottis and vocal cords.
- The ETT (usually size 8–9mm for a male and 7–8mm for a female) is then inserted under direct vision from the right side of the mouth between the vocal cords and into the trachea.
- The tracheal cuff should then be inflated until no leak is audible or to 30cmH2 O.

## *Confirmation of correct placement*

- Bilateral chest wall movement
- Auscultation of both lung fields for breath sounds
- Presence of exhaled CO2 on capnography.

Once tracheal intubation is confirmed, cricoid pressure can be removed and the ETT should be secured with a tie or tape. In the critical care setting a chest radiograph is taken to confirm tube position.

## **Tracheostomy**

This section deals with elective insertion of temporary tracheostomies in critically ill patients.

Some indications are absolute:

- Airway protection (neurological dysfunction)
- Upper airway obstruction

Some indications are relative:

- Bronchial toilet
- Patient may be cared for in lower dependency area
- Patient is poorly tolerant of ETT.

Most tracheostomies are placed in patients who are undergoing, or are at risk of, prolonged mechanical ventilation.

Anecdotal advantages:

- Improved patient comfort
- Reduction in sedation requirement
- Improved mouth care
- Reduced dead space, tube resistance, and work of breathing
- Improved weaning and reduced ICU length of stay.

Two recent prospective randomized trials evaluating early vs late placement of tracheostomy did not demonstrate any significant advantages of early tracheostomy, but did confirm that a policy of early tracheostomy inevitably means additional procedures and procedural complications.

## **Types**

## *Percutaneous versus surgical*

Where the expertise exists, percutaneous tracheostomy is now the preferred procedure in ICU (it is at least equivalent, possibly with less wound infections).

#### *Internal/external diameter*

Nomenclature used by different manufacturers is confusing. There is a reasonable amount of variation in the ratio of internal to external diameter, and different tubes all of the same 'size' may have significantly different internal diameters. The smaller the internal diameter the higher the imposed work of breathing.

## *Inner cannula and cuffs*

Tubes with inner cannulae are safer, especially in areas without airway expertise, but the internal diameter is necessarily reduced compared with external diameter.

In the critical care setting, cuffed tubes are customarily the initial choice, allowing airway protection and positive pressure ventilation. Cuff pressure should be 20–30cmH2 O, to reduce VAP without causing mucosal ischaemia.

#### *Fenestrations*

If bulbar function is intact and the patient has been weaned from respiratory support, fenestrated tubes allow airflow through the upper airways and therefore phonation and speaking. If the tube is not fenestrated, deflating the cuff serves a similar function.

## *Shape and size*

There is no perfect tracheostomy tube that will have the correct intra-stomal length, intra-tracheal length, and angulation for every patient. Alternatives should therefore be available in order to avoid problems with the tube abutting the anterior or posterior wall, tube displacement, or tracheal erosion. Adjustable flange tubes may be useful, but have no inner cannula.

## **Performing a tracheostomy**

For guidance on how to perform a tracheostomy, see the Intensive Care Society's guidance on standards for the care of an adult patient with a temporary tracheostomy (see b Further reading, p. 27.

## **Complications of tracheostomies**

## *Immediate*

- Pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum
- Tracheo-oesophageal fistula
- Injury to great vessels or recurrent laryngeal nerves
- Bleeding, e.g. from divided thyroid isthmus.

## *Early*

- Secretions and mucus plugging
- Dislodged tube, respiratory arrest
- Post obstructive pulmonary oedema (when tracheostomy is performed in a patient with longstanding upper airway obstruction).

#### *Late*

- Bleeding from tracheoinnominate fistula (can be torrential)
- Tracheal stenosis (from ischemia induced by a cuffed tracheostomy tube)
- Tracheo-oesophageal fistula
- Tracheocutaneous fistula
- Cosmetic deformity.

## **Practical tracheostomy issues**

## *Changing a tracheostomy*

There is little evidence to guide practice. Facilities to reintubate via oral route should be immediately available.

- There is usually a defined stoma after 0 days.
- First elective change is best undertaken between 7 and 0 days. Avoid changes <72 hours after tracheostomy unless absolutely necessary.
- Railroad new tube over a fibreoptic scope (direct vision) or paediatric ETT (may be used to ventilate) or a suction catheter.

## **Tracheostomy emergencies**

The main life-threatening complications associated with a tracheostomy are blockage, dislodgement, and bleeding (see Fig. 25.).

## *Blockage and displacement*

A blocked or displaced tracheostomy tube presents with respiratory difficulty. A partly dislodged tracheostomy tube is just as dangerous, if not more dangerous, as a completely removed tracheostomy tube.

- Tracheostomy tubes may become dislodged or displaced when a ventilated patient is turned, or moved from their bed to a trolley.
- Restless or agitated patients may pull at their tracheostomy tubes, or ventilator tubing attached to the tracheostomy.

## *Action*

- *Don't panic*!
- Call for help—senior medical and nursing staff, other AHPs with tracheostomy care skills (e.g. physiotherapist).
- Reassure patient.
- Assess patency of airway (A) and patient's breathing (B). Is air passing through the tracheostomy tube or stoma? Is the patient breathing via mouth or nose?
- Check capnography and oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter.
- *If airway is not patent, it must be cleared immediately*.
- If the blocked tracheostomy tube has an inner lumen, remove the inner lumen and ventilate through the outer lumen.
- If a single-lumen tracheostomy tube is blocked or displaced, obstructing the airway, remove it to ventilate through the stoma or the mouth/ nose.
- Once removed, only experienced staff should attempt to re-insert a tracheostomy.
- Any attempt to re-insert a tracheostomy should be quickly abandoned if unsuccessful.
  - • A well-formed track from skin to the tracheal stoma takes >72 hours to form following surgical tracheostomy or >7 days after percutaneous tracheostomy.
- If unable to ventilate through the stoma, re-establish the airway in the usual fashion. Tilt the head back to extend the head on the neck, perform a jaw thrust. If necessary insert an oral airway (Guedel).
- Note that if 'bag and mask' ventilation is attempted, air will escape through the stoma. In this situation, get a colleague to occlude the stoma by applying pressure over it with gauze swabs or a pad.
- Tracheal intubation may be needed. It may be necessary to push the tracheal tube distal to the stoma. (Use an 'uncut' tube.)
- If the patient is breathing adequately at this point, there may be no need to artificially assist ventilation. Check the oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter and administer oxygen as required via a facemask or resuscitation bag with an oxygen reservoir.
- If artificial ventilation is needed, use a resuscitation bag and mask in the standard fashion.
- Maintain occlusion of the stoma as described earlier to prevent an air leak. Capnography will confirm tracheal intubation. Measurement of oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter will confirm adequacy of oxygenation.

- At this point the patient is safe, with a patent airway and adequate respiration. Do not panic.
- A decision about re-insertion of the tracheostomy tube can now be made by the senior anaesthetist.

## **Bleeding from a tracheostomy**

Bleeding is the most common complication of tracheostomy.

- Bleeding may occur early (within 48 hours of formation of the tracheostomy).
- Bleeding may be late (several days afterwards).

It may be minor (settles with simple conservative management) or major (requiring transfusion of blood and/or blood products) and surgical exploration may be needed to identify and deal with the source of bleeding.

## *Early minor bleeding*

Oozing from the stoma site is the most common type of bleeding seen following formation of a tracheostomy. Most commonly, this is the result of the effects of the vasoconstrictor used to infiltrate the incision site wearing off. Blood staining of the dressings may be noted, or there may be blood staining of tracheal secretions.

- Whilst maintaining control of the tracheostomy tube, remove the tracheostomy tube holder and dressing.
- Clean stoma site with sterile saline.
- Apply manual pressure to any obvious bleeding point—this may be sufficient to stop minor oozing. Suturing locally may also be effective.
- If still bleeding, infiltrate any obvious bleeding point with dilute adrenaline (:80,000 to :200,000). If no obvious bleeding point, infiltrate the stoma margins with dilute adrenaline.
- If still oozing, apply Kaltostat® packing to stoma to promote local clot formation.
- If bleeding is not stopped by these measures, refer for surgical exploration.

#### *Major early bleeding*

Large volumes of blood in the trachea may cause respiratory embarrassment—the patient may need further respiratory support in a critical care area.

Beware of the risk of the tracheostomy tube becoming occluded by blood clot.

In most situations of significant bleeding, secure the airway by translaryngeal intubation with the cuff below the stoma so the airway is protected from blood entering the trachea from the stoma. Then temporary haemostasis of the stoma can be achieved by digital pressure, packing the wound with gauze or deep tension sutures.

- Ensure that cross-matched blood is made available.
- Check full blood count and a coagulation screen. Correct any abnormalities in the standard way.

#### *Late bleeding*

Late bleeding may occur because of erosion of blood vessels in and around the stoma site. This is more likely if there has been infection of the stoma site. Such bleeding may settle with conservative management, as described in the early bleed guideline.

Late bleeding may be the result of erosion of a major artery in the root of the neck where there has been pressure from the tracheostomy tube itself or the cuff.

- *Don't panic*.
- Call for help—senior medical and nursing staff, other AHPs with tracheostomy care skills.
- Reassure the patient.
- Bleeding may be temporarily reduced or stopped by applying finger pressure to the root of the neck in the sternal notch, or by inflating the tracheostomy tube cuff (if present) with a 50mL syringe of air. This inflation should be done slowly and steadily to inflate the balloon to a maximum volume without bursting it. This may be anywhere between 0mL and 35mL.
- Urgent referral for surgical exploration must be made.
- Ensure that cross-matched blood is made available.
- Check full blood count and a coagulation screen. Correct any abnormalities in the standard way.

## **Weaning and decannulation**

Once on low-level respiratory support, the time spent breathing through a T piece is gradually increased. The cuff is normally deflated at this stage, allowing use of a speaking valve. Use of decannulation cap is not required, and will increase work of breathing unnecessarily. When the patient has not required respiratory support for an acceptable period (at least 24 hours) decannulation may be undertaken if there is:

- Patent upper airway
- Adequate cough for amount of secretions
- Intact bulbar function.

Use of a minitracheostomy has been shown to reduce sputum retention and the need for re-intubation in thoracic surgical patients.

## **Extubation**

Removal of the ETT (extubation) is undertaken after successful weaning from mechanical ventilation. In patients with COPD or neuromuscular disease extubation may precede fully completed weaning.

#### **Pre-conditions for extubation**

- Adequate oxygenation (PaO<sub>3</sub>:FiO<sub>3</sub> ratio >27kPa).
- Normal PaCO<sub>2</sub> (except in those known to be chronically hypercapnic)
- Adequate level of consciousness, compatible with maintaining an airway and clearing secretions (obeying commands)
- Adequate cough (to deal with current secretion volume)
- Adequate bulbar function
- Adequate respiratory muscle strength (vital capacity 12–15mL/kg)
- Adequate cuff leak in patients ventilated for >24 hours (see 'Cuff leak test' later in this topic)
- Successful trial of spontaneous breathing (see Weaning strategies, p. 283).

#### **Process of extubation**

#### Preparation

- Drugs and equipment for reintubation should be immediately available including equipment for a difficult airway.
- Prepare an oxygen mask and system capable of delivering humidified oxygen.

#### Process

- Often a two-person job.
- Inform the patient and surrounding staff.
- Ensure enteral feed is stopped (preferably for 4 hours).
- Aspirate gastric contents via NG tube.
- Sit patient up.
- Suction mouth and oropharynx and aspirate subglottic drain if applicable.
- Undo tube ties.
- In order to deal with secretions present above cuff, deflate the pilot balloon of the ETT while suction catheter remains in trachea.
- Withdraw the ETT with constant aspiration of the suction catheter.
- Administer humidified oxygen.

#### **Extubation failure**

Post extubation failure and re-intubation is associated with a marked increase in mortality and ICU length of stay. Signs include stridor, dyspnoea, sweating, use of accessory muscles, tachypnoea, tachycardia, hypotension or hypertension, hypoxaemia, and hypercapnia.

Ideally, identify the cause of extubation failure before reintubation—it is often difficult in retrospect. Perform an examination, arrange for ECG and echocardiogram, CXR, and SvO<sub>2</sub>. If stridor is present, fibreoptic laryngoscopy will delineate the underlying aetiology. Often the degree of respiratory distress will appropriately curtail these investigations.

#### Causes of extubation failure

Early failure is usually due to upper airway swelling, LV failure, or inadequate assessment.

#### Stridor

Post-extubation stridor can be caused by laryngospasm, laryngeal oedema, or excessive dynamic airway collapse and tracheobronchomalacia. It is often under-recognized and occurs in 10–15% of patients who are extubated after >24 hours of ventilation. Risk factors include medical admissions, female sex, traumatic or difficult intubations, cuff pressure >30cmH $_2$ O, prolonged intubation, and a history of self extubation.

## Cuff leak test

- During IPPV a leak of <110mL or <18% tidal volume predicts post extubation stridor.
- If breathing spontaneously, the presence of an audible leak while using PEEP 10cmH<sub>3</sub>O is a sensible alternative measure.
- Steroids reduce post-extubation stridor in those with inadequate cuff leak (dexamethasone 4mg four times a day for 24–48 hours).

## Management

Laryngospasm, excessive dynamic airway collapse or tracheobronchomalacia:

- · Application of high-flow oxygen
- CPAP
- Reintubation if these measures fail.

## Laryngeal oedema:

- Nebulized adrenaline (the levo-isomer is recommended, though with poor supporting evidence).
- Dexamethasone 4mg four times daily.
- In the presence of significant respiratory distress re: intubation should not be delayed.

#### Left ventricular failure

Extubation places considerable strain on the left ventricle.

- Removal of positive intrathoracic pressure increases preload and afterload
- Extubation can be frightening—† sympathetic drive may add to myocardial work.
- † minute ventilation will increase oxygen demand.

Underlying causes should be treated, full medical therapy should be instituted, and aggressive diuresis carried out before further attempt at extubation, even if LV function improves post reintubation.

#### Respiratory dysfunction

Respiratory dysfunction post extubation is often multifactorial:

- Loss of positive intrathoracic pressure and alveolar hypoventilation due to muscle weakness cause atelectasis. The result is † work of breathing and poor gas exchange.
- Large volume or viscous secretions cause alveolar hypoventilation, consolidation, † work of breathing, and poor gas exchange.

- A poor cough or associated muscle weakness may exacerbate both these problems.
- Wheeze (asthma, COPD, LV failure).
- LV dysfunction.

## *Inadequate assessment*

Patients whose underlying pathology has not resolved sufficiently, or who have not met the preconditions for extubation (described earlier) are unlikely to tolerate extubation.

## **Non-invasive ventilation**

- Use of NIV to manage respiratory failure post extubation has been shown to increase mortality. These patients should be reintubated.
- Use of NIV electively in hypercapnic patients or patients with COPD reduces the rate of reintubation.

## **Reintubation**

- Reintubation may be complicated by laryngeal oedema following prolonged intubation.
- Avoid suxamethonium in patients at risk of critical illness polymyoneuropathy (severe sepsis or prolonged mechanical ventilation). Severe hyperkalaemia may result.
