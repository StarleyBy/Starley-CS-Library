<summary>Prognostic models</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Prognostic models allow the prediction of patient outcomes in intensive care units (ICUs) based on multiple risk factors. They are often referred to as prognostic models, risk prediction models, or severity of illness scores.


<details class="med-details">
<summary>What are prognostic models?</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Statistical models using commonly measured risk factors to predict patient outcome.
- Risk factors usually consist of:
  - • Physiological variables
  - • Chronic health conditions
- • ICU admission diagnosis.
- Usually measured within first 24 hours of ICU admission.
- Hospital mortality is the most common and reliable outcome.

Commonly used prognostic models for adult general ICUs include:

- APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation—Table 2.1)
- SAPS (Simplified Acute Physiology Score)
- MPM (Mortality Probability Model)
- ICNARC (Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre).

<details class="med-details">
<summary>How are prognostic models developed?</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Accurate data on risk factors and outcomes are collected prospectively.
- Risk factors are chosen based on literature review, existing prognostic models, and expert opinion.
- Model is developed using regression techniques.
- Relative weights are assigned to risk factors based on regression model.
- Model performance is assessed by testing for discrimination (ability to discriminate between individuals with and without the outcome) and calibration (how well the model mirrors the true outcome rate).

<summary>What are prognostic models used for?</summary>
<div class="details-content">

By controlling for differences in risk, prognostic models allow clinicians, managers, policymakers, patients, and relatives to make informed decisions. The most common examples are:

- *Benchmarking*: to assess quality of care delivered by ICUs using standardized mortality ratios (SMRs):
  - • SMR is the ratio of observed deaths to expected deaths (estimated by the model) and is used to compare an ICU to a reference group (e.g. the national average).
- *Performance assessment*: to allow ICUs to compare current performance with past performance.
- *Resource utilization*: to allow appropriate resource allocation to ICUs.
- *Clinical trials*: to select patients for inclusion into clinical trials based on risk.
- *Clinical decision-making*: as a bedside clinical decision-making tool:
  - • Has not been validated for this use and may not be accurate.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Organ failure scores</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Unlike prognostic models, organ failure models assess the degree of organ dysfunction in major organ systems (cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, hepatic, haematological, neurological):

- Can be measured daily (not restricted to first 24 hours of admission)
- Points allocated based on degree of organ dysfunction
- Easy to calculate
- Allows ICU monitoring of ICU trajectory
- Not initially designed for risk prediction
- Gastrointestinal (GI) and endocrine systems are not included because of difficulty in assessment of degree of organ dysfunction.

Commonly used organ failure models for adult general ICUs include:

- SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment)
- MODS (Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score)
- LODS (Logistic Organ Dysfunction System).

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Cardiac surgery prognostic models</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Death after cardiac surgery is related to the patient's preoperative risk profile. Hospital mortality is used as a marker of quality of care after cardiac surgery. In order to compare hospital mortality rates for different hospitals and different surgeons, patients' preoperative risk profiles must be adjusted using the patient preoperative risk profile.

Commonly used preoperative cardiac surgery prognostic models include:

- EuroSCORE
- Parsonnet Score.


<details class="med-details">
<summary>EuroSCORE</summary>
<div class="details-content">


- Developed using a cohort of patients from 28 hospitals in eight European countries.
- Widely used across Europe.
- The model consists of three groups of risk factors:
  - • Patient-related factors
  - • Cardiac-related factors
  - • Operation-related factors.
- Two models exist (Table 2.2).
- Additive model:
  - • Simple to use
  - • Can be calculated at bedside
  - • Simple addition of points
  - • Underestimates risk in high-risk groups.
- Logistic model:
  - • Uses logistic equation
  - • Same risk factors as additive model
  - • Better suited for high-risk patients.
- A revised score is being developed—*EuroSCORE 2010*:
  - • Being developed in >300 centres in different countries
  - • Expected to provide more accurate risk prediction for a diverse patient population

<summary>Parsonnet score</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Redeveloped in 2000 using a cohort of patients in 0 US centres.
- Calculation is based on simple addition of scores with graphical interpretation (Fig. 2.).
- Helpful as a guide to patients and family in estimating cardiac surgical risk.
