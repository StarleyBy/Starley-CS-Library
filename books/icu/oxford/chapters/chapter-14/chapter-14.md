<summary><span style="font-size:110%">Gastrointestinal complications after cardiac surgery</span></summary>
<div class="details-content">

Gastrointestinal (GI) complications after cardiac operations are infrequent (0.3–3%) but serious. The overall mortality from GI complications ranges from 11–72% and has not ↓ significantly during the last two decades. GI conditions range from mild, but troublesome, complications like ileus to devastating complications such as bowel ischaemia and liver failure.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Common complications</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- GI bleeding (33%), mortality 20%
- Mesenteric ischaemia (14%), mortality 50–00%
- Pancreatitis (11%), mortality 20%
- Acute cholecystitis (9%), mortality 26%
- Perforated peptic ulcer (5%), mortality 36%
- Liver failure (2%), mortality 56%.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Risk factors</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Numerous risk factors for GI complications have been reported and can be classified as pre-, intra-, and postoperative. The factors that have been identified on multivariate analysis are:

- Preoperative: age >70 years, low CO (22-fold ↑ risk), peripheral vascular disease, reoperative surgery and chronic renal failure
- Intra- and postoperative: ↑ need for blood transfusions, prolonged CPB, dysrhythmias (17-fold ↑ risk), IABP.

These factors are general markers of how unwell these patients are as well as proxy markers for the complexity of their surgery. Mesenteric ischaemia is often the final part of a tragic tale of organ dysfunction in patients who likely would have died from circulatory failure anyway, with or without GI complications.

The cause of GI complications is still unknown but most theories implicate low CO resulting in visceral hypoperfusion and ischaemia. This process triggers a hormonal stress response and leads to a mediator-driven systemic inflammatory response.

The role of CPB in the aetiology of GI complications is controversial. One randomized trial showed a significant decrease of GI complications in coronary bypass off-pump vs on-pump. These results have not been duplicated and most studies found no difference with regard to GI complications, gastric mucosal oxygenation, or superior mesenteric arterial blood flow when comparing on-pump with off-pump CABG.

Other perioperative interventions have been shown to reduce the incidence of GI complications like stress-ulcer prophylaxis and goal-directed haemodynamic therapy and even intraoperative manoeuvres like epi-aortic scanning prior to clamping shows promise.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Ischaemic bowel</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Occurs after 0.16% of all cardiac operations and has a mortality of 50% on average but may be as high as 100% in some reports. The patients are commonly on mechanical ventilation and sedated, thus making the usual signs of abdominal pain and tenderness unreliable. Furthermore, many patients with multiple organ dysfunction in intensive care develop distended and tender abdomens with ileus making it a diagnostic challenge to identify the patient with ischaemic bowel.

The onset is usually gradual and non-specific with Ileus, abdominal distension, ↑ NG output, ↑ need for organ support, raised inflammatory markers, hyperkalaemia, unexplained lactic acidosis, and lower GI bleeding. All of these are non-specific and contribute to a delay in diagnosis with ↑ morbidity and mortality.

Mesenteric ischaemia can be occlusive, non-occlusive and rarely due to mesenteric venous thrombosis.

- Non-occlusive mesenteric ischaemia (NOMI) is more common and thought to be secondary to hypoperfusion and the use of vasopressor drugs. The onset is slower and more gradual than occlusive ischaemia. If suspected and the patient does not need urgent laparotomy for bowel necrosis (as indicated by severe acidosis, peritonitis, CT findings) the diagnosis can be made with mesenteric angiography showing the characteristic 'string of sausages' signs due to constrictions in the mesenteric arteries.
- Management in the early stages include: broad-spectrum antibiotics, aggressive resuscitation to maximize mesenteric blood flow, NG tube decompression, and intra-arterial papaverine infusion (bolus of 60mg followed by continuous infusion of 0.7mg/kg per hour) through the intra-arterial catheter placed into the SMA during arteriography.
- If bowel necrosis is already established urgent laparotomy is required.
- Occlusive mesenteric ischaemia may be caused by emboli or thrombus formation and has sudden onset with acute clinical deterioration. Diagnosis is commonly made on CT angiography. Management is usually operative with laparotomy, revascularization, and resection of necrosed bowel. Alternatives to mesenteric bypass like embolectomy, angioplasty, stenting, and thrombolytics have been reported but their use in post-cardiac surgery (especially thrombolytics) needs to be established.
- Mesenteric venous thrombosis leads to swelling of the bowel and eventual arterial occlusion. The diagnosis is made on contrast-enhanced CT scan and management includes urgent anticoagulation.

The outcome of mesenteric ischaemia is dependent on early diagnosis which requires a high index of suspicion and a willingness to aggressively investigate and explore patients early. The principles of operative surgery are as follows:

- Revascularize before resection to minimize bowel loss
- Liberal use of second-look laparotomy.

Where there is agreement that bowel ischaemia is part of progressive and irreversible organ dysfunction syndrome due to poor perfusion, a multidisciplinary decision (along with relatives) should be made to limit intervention in a patient who is deemed to be in an end of life situation.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Acute pancreatitis</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Any patient with abdominal symptoms and signs post-cardiac surgery should have a s-amylase test. Hyperamylasemia occurs in 30–40% of patients after cardiac surgery, but only 1–3% of these have clinical pancreatitis. Amylase may also be raised in numerous other conditions including perforated viscus and ischaemic bowel. Contrast-enhanced CT should always be performed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions that may require urgent operative intervention.

Hyperamylasemia on its own does not warrant any specific treatment whereas the presence of clinical and radiological evidence of pancreatitis needs supportive management:

- Adjust IV fluid therapy to meet the ↑ demands of massive retroperitoneal fluid sequestration.
- No longer should 'bowel rest' be employed. Enteral feeding (normal oral route, NG, or nasojejunal is acceptable) should always be encouraged above total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The route should be adjusted to compensate for vomiting, gastric stasis, and ileus which commonly occur.
- Routine antibiotics are not recommended in the absence of necrosis.
- Repeat CT if condition deteriorates to diagnose and manage pancreatic necrosis and infected necrosis, increasingly by radiological and percutaneous drainage rather than open necrosectomy.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Acute cholecystitis</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Cholecystitis typically occurs 5–15 days postoperatively and rarely presents with classical symptoms of right upper quadrant pain. Instead, patients develop SIRS and/or i unexplained haemodynamic instability. Diabetics are at i risk and do not present typical clinical signs. As opposed to cholecystitis in the general population, at least half of cases post cardiac surgery have acalculous disease and approximately half of patients will have gangrenous cholecystitis. It is therefore important to intervene before gangrene and perforation occurs (within 24 hours of onset of symptoms) as the mortality rises sharply thereafter.

Management has to be individualized:

- Percutaneous cholecystostomy (at the bedside under ultrasound guidance) is an option for unstable patients in the absence of perforation.
- Cholecystectomy, partial or total is the treatment of choice and can be done open or laparoscopically. Large drains are recommended as cystic duct/gallbladder remnant bile leaks are not uncommon. This can be managed with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and temporary biliary stenting.
</div>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Liver failure and hyperbilirubinaemia</summary>
<div class="details-content">

After cardiac surgery up to 25% of patients may experience a rise in bilirubin, usually peaking on the 1st or 2nd postoperative day with a mortality rate of around 4%. Liver failure, as defined by the loss of synthetic and metabolic function of the liver (↓ production of clotting factors and albumin) and the development of hepatic encephalopathy, occurs in <0.1% of cardiac patients but carries a mortality rate of >50%. It is often a manifestation of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, but may be drug induced. Management includes:

- Improving haemodynamics and liver perfusion
- Stopping hepatotoxic drugs
- Liver screen for underlying hepatic and haematological disease
- Ultrasound and CT to rule out biliary obstruction, portal venous obstruction, and hepatic vein thrombosis.
</div>
</details>


GI complications after cardiac surgery are fortunately rare as they carry a significant mortality rate. It remains one of the greatest clinical and diagnostic challenges in cardiac ITU. A general surgeon should be involved early as a delay in diagnosis and treatment has a high mortality. A team approach to management is ideal to ensure that patients receive timely intervention when needed but also, and just as important, that patients for whom death is inevitable do not suffer pointless and frankly cruel interventions in the final stages of their lives.

<summary><span style="font-size:110%">Investigating the acute abdomen</span></summary>
<div class="details-content">

Post-cardiac surgery patients in ICU can present with abdominal symptoms in a variety of ways. The presentation may be obvious with acute onset of symptoms and signs in a patient who is not sedated and on minimal supportive therapy. It is easier to diagnose these patients more accurately with clinical examination, laboratory, and imaging investigations. On the other end of the spectrum, patients may be profoundly unwell with multiple organ dysfunction on an array of life support therapies with subtle and insidious signs of GI disturbance. These patients remain one of the greatest diagnostic challenges and often the correct diagnosis is only made at laparotomy or postmortem.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Clinical history and examination</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Post-cardiac surgery patients are often sedated and ventilated. Symptoms are therefore not reported and physical signs can be unreliable and may only become obvious at a late and irreversible stage. That said, there is no reliable laboratory or imaging indicator (especially for mesenteric ischaemia). The only objective 'test' is laparotomy. Therefore, clinical examination by an experienced acute GI surgeon is still the only, although imperfect, modality to essentially decide on the need for surgery.

A careful history should include:

- Nature of cardiac surgery, intra- and postoperative course, time elapsed since operation
- Previous history of GI disease, abdominal surgery
- 'Subtle' signs of GI complications such as abdominal distension, non-absorption of feed, and i NG output
- Deterioration of organ dysfunction for no other apparent reason.

##### *Physical examination*

- Focal tenderness is a more indicative sign than generalized tenderness.
- Unless peritonitis is present, abdominal examination may remain unremarkable.
- In the presence of equivocal findings, repeated examination by the same surgeon is invaluable as it is often subtle changes that are not communicated that are the most helpful.
</div>
</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Laboratory test</summary>
<div class="details-content">

No laboratory test can reliably establish or eliminate the diagnosis of mesenteric ischaemia. The following blood tests are used as an adjunct:

- Arterial blood gas—pH
- s-lactate
- s-phosphate
- s-amylase
- Liver function tests (LFTs)
- Full blood count (FBC)—white cell count.

As expected, most of these will be abnormal in patients who are often haemodynamically unstable and have a high incidence of organ dysfunction. Acid–base status, s-lactate, and s-phosphate are altered by renal replacement therapy.

</div>
</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Imaging</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Abdominal X-ray: findings are usually non-specific, e.g. dilated loops of bowel, thickened bowel wall, and ascites which are late findings. It can be normal in up to 25%. Its role is more to rule out perforation and bowel obstruction.
- Ultrasound and mesenteric duplex Doppler is not very useful in the acute setting as distended gas-filled loops of bowel degrade and obscure the images.
- Mesenteric angiogram is still regarded as the gold standard but its use in critically ill patients is limited because of its invasive, time-consuming nature and the need for high doses of contrast. In selected, stable patients without established infarction it may be useful and even therapeutic allowing interventions such as stents, angioplasty, and in the case of NOMI, intra-arterial infusion of papaverine.
- CT: multidetector row CT has overcome most of the limitations of earlier scanners with faster scanner and thinner collimation. Sophisticated post processing can render images of the mesenteric vasculature comparable to angiography. In the critically ill patient, often with poor CO and renal impairment, the constraints in accurate timing and dose of contrast reduces the sensitivity and specificity (correlates with laparotomy findings in <50% of cases where mesenteric ischaemia is suspected). It is, however, useful to diagnose pancreatitis, bowel obstruction, cholecystitis, and perforation.

Early aggressive investigation of patients who show clinical and radiological signs of paralytic ileus with one or more of the following signs should be promptly investigated with high-quality CT and/or mesenteric arteriography:

- No bowel movement 3 days after cardiac surgery despite laxatives
- Bloated, distended abdomen
- High output from NG tube
- Non-absorption of feed.

Ultimately, the only objectively reliable 'investigation' is laparotomy and this should be offered early in patients with suspicious findings. In the absence of frank dead bowel it may be difficult, even at laparotomy, to distinguish mesenteric ischaemia. Limited reports of diagnostic laparoscopy found it safe and accurate in this setting.

<summary><span style="font-size:110%">Gastrointestinal bleeding</span></summary>
<div class="details-content">

GI bleeding occurs in 0.3–1% of post-cardiac surgery patients and accounts for about 33% of GI complications.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Upper GI bleeding</summary>
<div class="details-content">

The mortality rate of bleeding from the upper GI tract after cardiac surgery is high (15–35%) and not dissimilar to the mortality seen in other hospitalized patients who bleed. Acute stress ulceration due to ischaemia/ reperfusion injury is the most common cause, further complicated by the ubiquitous use of anticoagulants and/or antiplatelet drugs. Another risk factor is prolonged ventilation. There is some evidence that a prior history of GI bleeding/ulceration increases risk. *Helicobacter pylori* does not appear to be associated with stress ulceration in post-cardiac surgery patients.

The bleeding lesion is acid related in 75% of cases: gastritis, gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, and erosive oesophagitis. Less common lesions include varices (rare in cardiac surgery patients), Mallory–Weiss syndrome and vascular lesions, e.g. Dieulafoy lesions.

The majority of upper GI bleeding is self-limiting. Significant, ongoing bleeding needs urgent management.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Principles of management</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Resuscitation. Adequate haemodynamic stability and transfusion of blood products is obviously important.
- Prophylactic antibiotics. Therapeutic endoscopic procedures cause transient bacteraemia putting patients with prosthetic valves etc. at risk for endocarditis.
- Anticoagulant, antiplatelet therapy should be stopped and coagulopathy should be corrected.
- Endoscopy. The timing depends on the situation. Stable patients need an urgent endoscopy to establish and treat the source of bleeding. Unstable patients despite adequate resuscitation need intubating (if not already intubated) and endoscopy should take place as part of the resuscitation.
- Endoscopic haemostasis is the treatment of choice and >90% successful in stopping the bleeding. It may be necessary to lavage the stomach to remove blood clots to identify the source of bleeding. The prokinetic effect of IV erythromycin is a proven way of reducing blood clots in the stomach. Combination therapy (adrenaline injection with either heater probe or haemoclips) is superior to monotherapy. When faced with an adherent clot to the ulcer base this should be removed to treat the underlying lesion.
- IV PPI infusion post endostasis reduces the risk of rebleeding. Omeprazole 80mg IV followed by an infusion of 8mg/hour for 72 hours. This is followed by 20mg of oral omeprazole for at least 8 weeks or indefinite maintenance for patients on non-steroidal anti-inflammatories.
- Enteral nutrition should be resumed as soon as bleeding has stopped and the patient is stable and able to tolerate feeding.

- Where endostasis fails, laparotomy and suturing of the bleeding point is the only option. This is a self-selecting group with a higher mortality approaching 45%.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Lower GI bleeding</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Lower GI bleeding in the CICU setting is associated with a 17–20% mortality. The most common causes remain diverticular bleeding and angiodysplastic lesions. Bleeding from these lesions is self-limiting in >90% of cases, provided anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy is stopped. Other causes are colitis (mostly ischaemic), neoplasia, and anorectal bleeding. It must be kept in mind that up to 10% of lower GI bleeding is actually bleeding from an upper GI source.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Management</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Resuscitation and transfusion.
- Correct coagulopathy.
- Rule out upper GI source especially if massive bleed causing haemodynamic instability.
- All patients should have colonoscopy after proper bowel prep in the weeks to come once discharged from ICU and able to tolerate the procedure. The main purpose is to rule out underlying colorectal malignancy.
- In the minority who do not stop bleeding the options are:
  - Colonoscopy in unprepared bowel which is difficult yielding a diagnosis in 70–80%.
  - It may be possible to use endostasis techniques.
  - Angiography or CT angiography to establish the bleeding point followed by segmental resection.
  - In desperate cases a subtotal colectomy may be the only viable option.

<summary><span style="font-size:110%">Nutrition in CICU</span></summary>
<div class="details-content">

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Introduction</summary>
<div class="details-content">

It is estimated that 10–40% of all patients in hospital are undernourished. In addition, critically ill patients lose approximately 5–10% of skeletal muscle mass per week during their ICU stay. It is therefore recommended that critical care patients are fed to counteract catabolic state.

There is a lot of literature on nutrition in critically ill patients, but few high-quality trials. These recommendations are based on guidelines produced by the Canadian Critical Care Network, by ESPEN (the European Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition) and NICE.
</div>
</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Requirements</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- 20–30kcal/kg body weight increasing to 25–30kcal/kg
- Nitrogen 0.7–0.2g/kg body weight (1–1.25g protein/kg).

This does not allow for age, sex, obesity and metabolic state and so an individual patient's requirements should be assessed by a dietitian.
</div>
</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Feeding</summary>
<div class="details-content">

The provision of nutrition should be started within 24–48 hours of admission to CICU if the patient is not expected to become established on oral diet within 3 days (ESPEN). Enteral tube feeding uses the physiological route, is cheap, and is generally safe. In the presence of a functioning GI tract it is the preferred route of nutrition support.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Enteral nutrition</summary>
<div class="details-content">

The simplest technique is via NG tube:

- Reducing the risk of aspiration:
  -  NG tube position should be confirmed on placement and checked regularly
  -  45° head-up position
- Promoting enteral feed:
  -  Check gastric emptying aspirate from NG tube 4- to 6-hourly. Acceptable volume of aspirates vary as per local policy (up to 400mL), if able return some/all aspirate to maintain gut function.

High aspirate is a common reason why patients do not receive full prescribed volume of feed therefore consider the following:

- Reduced use of opiates.
- The use of prokinetic agents—metoclopramide 10mg four times a day and/or erythromycin. There is not a standard regimen for erythromycin when used as a prokinetic agent. With IV erythromycin, satisfactory outcomes have been achieved with doses of 300mg daily in divided doses, with 250mg four times a day, and with single doses of 70mg and 200mg.
- Ensure that feed rate is not reduced based on one aspirate, monitor trend and review rate in line with clinical assessment—abdomen, regurgitation, nausea, and vomiting.

If aspirates prevent adequate feeding consider post-pyloric feeding with a naso-jejunostomy tube. To ensure correct positioning this may require endoscopic or radiological placement.

###### *Administration*

Start feed at low rate (25–30mL/hour); if tolerated increase in 25–30mL increments until target rate met.

Fluid requirements should be decided by medical staff. Depending on volume available for feeding, standard (1.0kcal/mL) or high-energy and/or protein feeds (1.2–2.0kcal/mL) can be used.
</div>
</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Parenteral nutrition</summary>
<div class="details-content">

If enteral feeding is not achieving nutrition targets, consider early conversion to parenteral feeding. Where available the multidisciplinary nutrition team will assess and advise.

###### Consider:

- When the GI tract is not functional or cannot be accessed
- When the patient's nutrient needs are greater than those which can be met through the GI tract.

Parenteral nutrition (PN) may be delivered through peripheral venous access in the short term. Ideally it is delivered into a central vein through a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC), a dedicated central venous feeding line, or through a dedicated lumen of a central line. Pharmacy will advise on PN bags available. Asepsis must be strictly adhered to.

###### *Administration*

Options are 'All-in-one' mixtures with added electrolytes and micro-nutrients or individually tailored PN bags:

- Some of the energy should come from lipid sources but there is paucity of evidence to suggest any particular lipid formulations. Caution should be applied when other lipid containing infusions are also in use (e.g. propofol). Lipid infusion is safe at rates up to 1.5g/kg/day.
- Glucose can be given at 4–5g/kg/day. In all critically ill patients avoid hyperglycaemia (blood glucose >10mmol/L) by minimizing IV dextrose and using insulin administration when necessary.
- Nitrogen requirements should be met in standard solutions.
- Estimate electrolyte requirements based on clinical condition and discuss with pharmacy regarding additions to PN bag.
- Micronutrient solutions providing vitamins and trace elements should be added by pharmacy prior to dispensing.

Assess volume requirements and infusion rate. PN should be infused using a volumetric pump normally over 24 hours.
</div>
</details>

</div>
</details>

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Monitoring</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Nutritional support needs to be monitored to assess efficacy and detect any complications. The measurements and their frequency depend on the severity of the patient's illness and the stage of feeding.

- Biochemistry—urea & electrolytes (U&Es) daily; glucose at least once daily; bone profile daily, once stable twice weekly; LFTs twice weekly.
- Fluid balance—fluid balance daily, patient weight daily.

- Nutritional status—weight and nitrogen balance weekly. Interpret both with care re: fluid balance. There is wide individual response.
- Trace elements and vitamin status—inflammatory status of patient (C-reactive protein (CRP)) should be assessed before requesting nutrition screen as results are difficult to interpret. Discuss with biochemistry department.
