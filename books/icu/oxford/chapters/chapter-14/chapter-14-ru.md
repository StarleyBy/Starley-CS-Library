## **Gastrointestinal complications after cardiac surgery**

Gastrointestinal (GI) complications after cardiac operations are infrequent (0.3–3%) but serious. The overall mortality from GI complications ranges from –72% and has not significantly improved during the last two decades. GI conditions range from mild, troublesome, complications like ileus to devastating complications such as bowel ischaemia and liver failure.

## **Common complications**

- GI bleeding (33%), mortality 20%
- Mesenteric ischaemia (4%), mortality 50–00%
- Pancreatitis (%), mortality 20%
- Acute cholecystitis (9%), mortality 26%
- Perforated peptic ulcer (5%), mortality 36%

### **Risk factors**

Numerous risk factors for GI complications have been reported and can be classified as pre-, intra-, and postoperative. The factors that have been identified on multivariate analysis are:

- Preoperative: age >70 years, low CO (22-fold i risk), peripheral vascular disease, reoperative surgery and chronic renal failure
- Intra- and postoperative: i need for blood transfusions, prolonged CPB, dysrhythmias (7-fold i risk), IABP.

These factors are general markers of how unwell these patients are as well as proxy markers for the complexity of their surgery. Mesenteric ischaemia is often the final part of a tragic tale of organ dysfunction in patients who likely would have died from circulatory failure anyway, with or without GI complications.

The cause of GI complications is still unknown but most theories implicate low CO resulting in visceral hypoperfusion and ischaemia. This process triggers a hormonal stress response and leads to a mediator-driven systemic inflammatory response.

The role of CPB in the aetiology of GI complications is controversial. One randomized trial showed a significant decrease of GI complications in coronary bypass off-pump vs on-pump. These results have not been duplicated and most studies found no difference with regard to GI complications, gastric mucosal oxygenation, or superior mesenteric arterial blood flow when comparing on-pump with off-pump CABG.

Other perioperative interventions have been shown to reduce the incidence of GI complications like stress-ulcer prophylaxis and goal-directed haemodynamic therapy and even intraoperative manoeuvres like epi-aortic scanning prior to clamping shows promise.

#### **Ischaemic bowel**

Occurs after 0.6% of all cardiac operations and has a mortality of 50% on average but may be as high as 00% in some reports. The patients are commonly on mechanical ventilation and sedated, thus making the usual signs of abdominal pain and tenderness unreliable. Furthermore, many patients with multiple organ dysfunction in intensive care develop distended and tender abdomens with ileus making it a diagnostic challenge to identify the patient with ischaemic bowel.

The onset is usually gradual and non-specific with Ileus, abdominal distension, i NG output, i need for organ support, raised inflammatory markers, hyperkalaemia, unexplained lactic acidosis, and lower GI bleeding. All of these are non-specific and contribute to a delay in diagnosis with imorbidity and mortality.

Mesenteric ischaemia can be occlusive, non-occlusive and rarely due to mesenteric venous thrombosis.

- Non-occlusive mesenteric ischaemia (NOMI) is more common and thought to be secondary to hypoperfusion and the use of vasopressor drugs. The onset is slower and more gradual than occlusive ischaemia. If suspected and the patient does not need urgent laparotomy for bowel necrosis (as indicated by severe acidosis, peritonitis, CT findings) the diagnosis can be made with mesenteric angiography showing the characteristic 'string of sausages' signs due to constrictions in the mesenteric arteries.
- Management in the early stages include: broad-spectrum antibiotics, aggressive resuscitation to maximize mesenteric blood flow, NG tube decompression, and intra-arterial papaverine infusion (bolus of 60mg followed by continuous infusion of 0.7mg/kg per hour) through the intra-arterial catheter placed into the SMA during arteriography.
- If bowel necrosis is already established urgent laparotomy is required.
- Occlusive mesenteric ischaemia may be caused by emboli or thrombus formation and has sudden onset with acute clinical deterioration. Diagnosis is commonly made on CT angiography. Management is usually operative with laparotomy, revascularization, and resection of necrosed bowel. Alternatives to mesenteric bypass like embolectomy, angioplasty, stenting, and thrombolytics have been reported but their use in post-cardiac surgery (especially thrombolytics) needs to be established.
- Mesenteric venous thrombosis leads to swelling of the bowel and eventual arterial occlusion. The diagnosis is made on contrast-enhanced CT scan and management includes urgent anticoagulation.

The outcome of mesenteric ischaemia is dependent on early diagnosis which requires a high index of suspicion and a willingness to aggressively investigate and explore patients early. The principles of operative surgery are as follows:

- Revascularize before resection to minimize bowel loss
- Liberal use of second-look laparotomy.

Where there is agreement that bowel ischaemia is part of progressive and irreversible organ dysfunction syndrome due to poor perfusion, a multidisciplinary decision (along with relatives) should be made to limit intervention in a patient who is deemed to be in an end of life situation.

## **Acute pancreatitis**

Any patient with abdominal symptoms and signs post-cardiac surgery should have a s-amylase test. Hyperamylasemia occurs in 30–40% of patients after cardiac surgery, but only –3% of these have clinical pancreatitis. Amylase may also be raised in numerous other conditions including perforated viscus and ischaemic bowel. Contrast-enhanced CT should always be performed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions that may require urgent operative intervention.

Hyperamylasemia on its own does not warrant any specific treatment whereas the presence of clinical and radiological evidence of pancreatitis needs supportive management:

- Adjust IV fluid therapy to meet the i demands of massive retroperitoneal fluid sequestration.
- No longer should 'bowel rest' be employed. Enteral feeding (normal oral route, NG, or nasojejunal is acceptable) should always be encouraged above total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The route should be adjusted to compensate for vomiting, gastric stasis, and ileus which commonly occur.

High aspirate is a common reason why patients do not receive full prescribed volume of feed therefore consider the following:

- Reduced use of opiates.
- The use of prokinetic agents—metoclopramide 0mg four times a day and/or erythromycin. There is not a standard regimen for erythromycin when used as a prokinetic agent. With IV erythromycin, satisfactory outcomes have been achieved with doses of 300mg daily in divided doses, with 250mg four times a day, and with single doses of 70mg and 200mg.
- Ensure that feed rate is not reduced based on one aspirate, monitor trend and review rate in line with clinical assessment—abdomen, regurgitation, nausea, and vomiting.

If aspirates prevent adequate feeding consider post-pyloric feeding with a naso-jejunostomy tube. To ensure correct positioning this may require endoscopic or radiological placement.

#### *Nutritional support**

- Resuscitation and transfusion.
- Correct coagulopathy.
- Rule out upper GI source especially if massive bleed causing haemodynamic instability.
- All patients should have colonoscopy after proper bowel prep in the weeks to come once discharged from ICU and able to tolerate the procedure. The main purpose is to rule out underlying colorectal malignancy.

Assess volume requirements and infusion rate. PN should be infused using a volumetric pump normally over 24 hours.

#### **Monitoring**

Nutritional support needs to be monitored to assess efficacy and detect any complications. The measurements and their frequency depend on the severity of the patient's illness and the stage of feeding.

- Biochemistry—urea & electrolytes (U&Es) daily; glucose at least once daily; bone profile daily, once stable twice weekly; LFTs twice weekly.
- Fluid balance—fluid balance daily, patient weight daily.

- Nutritional status—weight and nitrogen balance weekly. Interpret both with care re: fluid balance. There is wide individual response.
- Trace elements and vitamin status—inflammatory status of patient (C-reactive protein (CRP)) should be assessed before requesting nutrition screen as results are difficult to interpret. Discuss with biochemistry department.
