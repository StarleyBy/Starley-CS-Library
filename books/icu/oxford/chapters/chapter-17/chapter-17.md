## **Coagulopathies**

Cardiac surgery as a specialty is almost uniquely placed to provoke the development of coagulation abnormalities. There are numerous reasons why cardiac surgical patients may become coagulopathic.

## **Haemodilution**

- Dilution of red cells occurs from addition of –.5L of colloid/ crystalloid pump prime, the effect being exaggerated in patients with smaller blood volumes, i.e. low body weight.
- Haemodilution may also occur from volume replacement subsequent to haemorrhage or as treatment for postoperative hypotension.
- In addition, coagulation factors are also diluted—it is estimated that reductions to <30% of control levels are necessary before significant bleeding will occur although there is some individual variation. Factors V and VIII are most commonly reduced.

## **Haemorrhage**

• Subsequent volume and red cell replacement may lead to the development of coagulopathy due to dilution, loss of factors, and loss of platelets.

#### **Platelet damage**

- Aside from dilution of platelets on bypass, mechanical damage from roller pumps or adsorption onto the membrane of the oxygenator may occur.
- Hypothermia-induced splenic sequestration of platelets has also been reported.

## **Antiplatelet therapy**

- A significant number of cardiac patients are on antiplatelet medication prior to surgery.
- Most will be on aspirin alone, some will be on clopidogrel alone (or an alternative drug acting on the P2Y2 receptor), and some will be on both.
- Dual antiplatelet therapy is a significant concern with regard to perioperative bleeding and where safe to do so, most surgeons will stop clopidogrel 5 days in advance of surgery.
- Some emergency patients may also have been given glycoprotein IIb/ IIIa antagonists, e.g. tirofiban, which are very potent antiplatelet agents, acting as they do on the final common pathway of platelet activation.

## **Heparin–protamine mismatch**

- There are numerous dosing regimens for administration of heparin for CPB and its subsequent reversal.
- It is important that heparin is adequately reversed at the end of the procedure.
- When the residual pump blood is administered to the patient towards the end of the case, some clinicians administer a further dose of protamine to cover any heparin present in that blood.

• In addition to a simple mismatch of heparin/protamine, the heparin– protamine complex may subsequently dissociate leading to the phenomenon of heparin rebound thus, in the presence of bleeding, coagulation tests including activated clotting time (ACT) should be repeated regularly.

## **Heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia**

- This condition is, in fact, prothrombotic and is caused by platelet-activating antibodies which recognize complexes of platelet factor 4/ heparin.
- The platelet count typically falls between days 5 and 0 of heparin treatment and should be considered in all cases with decreasing platelet counts in the presence of heparin treatment.
- Treatment is withdrawal of heparin and substitution with another agent, e.g. danaparoid/bivalirudin.

## **Warfarinization**

- In elective surgery, warfarin should be stopped several days in advance to allow the INR to return to normal (<.5).
- Where a small residual effect exists, administration of a small dose of IV vitamin K (0.5–mg) >2 hours prior to surgery should normalize the INR.
- For the emergency reversal of warfarin, the correct treatment is a prothrombin complex concentrate, e.g. Octaplex®, Beriplex®. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is not the treatment of choice.

#### **Contact with artificial surfaces**

- CPB acts to impair haemostasis; it activates fibrinolysis, impairs platelets as discussed, and affects coagulation factors.
- The extracorporeal circuit contains a large surface of thrombogenic material; activation of thrombin results in fibrinolytic activity, activation of complement, and inflammatory mediators.
- Denaturation of plasma proteins/factors may occur at blood–air interfaces, a common situation in cardiac surgery.

#### **Temperature**

• Patients are often cooled during bypass and may remain mildly/ moderately hypothermic on return to the ITU impacting on normal coagulation.

## **Blood conservation**

From what has already been discussed, it can be no surprise that cardiac surgery is a high blood-using specialty, estimated to use 5% of the UK blood supply. While the blood supply could be considered to be the safest it has ever been there are still recognizable risks associated with transfusion of red cells and blood products.

SHOT (Serious Hazards of Transfusion) reports annually on adverse events associated with transfusion:

- Incorrect component transfusion accounts for 25% of reports
- Acute and haemolytic transfusion reactions account for 3%
- Transfusion-related acute lung injury accounts for 2%
- Transfusion-transmitted infections 0.6%
- The risk of variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease is, as yet, unknown.

In addition, several large retrospective studies have demonstrated an association between transfusion and long- and short-term increases in mortality even if only unit of red cells has been transfused.

Blood is also an expensive and finite resource. These facts considered, it is appropriate that attempts are made to decrease our use of red cells and blood products and to use the resource appropriately.

Blood conservation could be considered to address three specific areas:

- Increasing or optimizing patients' haemoglobin preoperatively
- Decreasing blood loss intra- and postoperatively
- Optimizing transfusion practice using the best available evidence.

## **Increasing preoperative haemoglobin**

#### *Anaemia*

- Anaemia is an independent predictor of mortality in the cardiac surgical population.
- It has been demonstrated that up to a quarter of patients presenting for cardiac surgery have d iron stores. These patients have lower admission Hb, receive more red cells during their hospital stay, and have lower discharge Hb than their normal counterparts. However screening patients far enough in advance for treatment to be useful presents logistical problems for most units.
- Oral iron salts should increase Hb by g/dL every 0 days and, although usually well tolerated, treatment should last for at least 4–6 weeks to allow for an increase in Hb.
- IV iron has been associated with allergic reactions so is not without risk compared to oral formulations.
- Erythropoietin is not currently approved in the UK for preoperatively increasing Hb (except in Jehovah's Witnesses).

#### *Autologous transfusion*

Most Health Boards do offer autologous transfusion, however cardiac disease is a contraindication.

## **Decreasing blood loss intra- and postoperatively**

There are several possible points of intervention:

#### *Acute normovolaemic haemodilution*

The principle behind this technique is that:

- After induction in suitable patients (e.g. Hb >2g/dL), a volume of blood (e.g. 5mL/kg) can be removed from the patient and stored for re-infusion at the end of surgery.
- The volume removed is replaced with colloid to maintain normovolaemia.
- The advantages of this technique are that it is fairly simple, relatively inexpensive, and means that blood lost intraoperatively is of a lower haematocrit, therefore fewer red cells are lost.
- The blood transfused at the end of the procedure will raise the haematocrit and Hb and also contains platelets which function as well as they did preoperatively.

## *Pharmaceutical interventions*

*Antifibrinolytic agents*

- Tranexamic acid:
  - • A lysine analogue which binds to the lysine binding site of the plasminogen molecule displacing it from fibrin.
  - • It has been proven to decrease blood loss, decrease transfusion, and to decrease the frequency of surgical re-exploration.
  - • Having largely replaced aprotinin in cardiac practice, several recent studies have suggested that its use may be associated with similar complications.
- Aprotinin:
  - • Aprotinin's licence has been withdrawn, however, some centres continue to use it for high-risk patients off-licence on a named-patient only basis.

#### *DDAVP®*

- A synthetic vasopressin derivative which acts by recruitment of von Willebrand factor thus increasing platelet adhesion.
- It also increases concentrations of factor VIII and tissue plasminogen activator.
- It is not commonly used in the UK and good evidence of benefit is slim.

#### *NovoSeven®*

Recombinant factor VIIa has been used in an attempt to arrest catastrophic haemorrhage in extremis:

- It has been reported that there is a significant increase in thrombotic events in those treated outside its licensed indications for haemophilia and its use has accordingly become controversial.
- Its use therefore is at the discretion of the attending medical staff in discussion with haematologists.

#### *Cell salvage*

- Evidence supports the use of intraoperative cell salvage in cardiac surgery.
- However, there is a requirement for significant financial investment in terms of machine purchase, machine maintenance, purchase of disposables, and training of staff.

- Given the cost of unit of red cells may be quoted as £50, cell salvage offers potentially significant savings.
- Blood lost from the surgical field is washed to remove contaminants, debris, heparin, cytokines, etc. and is resuspended in normal saline for reinfusion.
- Most systems concentrate the blood to a haematocrit of at least 60%.
- This blood, however, will contain no coagulation factors or platelets.
- A postoperative system which acts as a mediastinal drain is also offered by Haemonetics (cardioPAT®) and has proved useful in our practice.
- It is important to note that some Jehovah's Witness patients may accept cell salvage as part of their treatment.

### **Decreasing haemodilution by pump prime**

Moving the machine as close as possible to the patient and cutting arterial and venous lines to an appropriate length can decrease the amount of volume added at the time of bypass and hence decrease haemodilution.

## *Mini bypass*

This is a relatively new technique which is used in few units and is somewhat more than simple miniaturization of a traditional bypass circuit requiring specific training for the perfusionists.

However, its aim is to minimize the inflammatory response to bypass which is done in several ways:

- Haemodilution is d (may be able to reduce prime to as little as 50mL).
- Minimizes the surface area of the circuit and oxygenator.
- *Lower suction is applied to the venous side of the circulation than in conventional bypass, decreasing damage to blood cells*.
- The centrifugal pump is also less damaging to red cells and platelets.
- There is no blood–air interface as there is no venous reservoir. Accordingly:
  - • Blood loss is d.
  - • Transfusion is d.
- May decrease myocardial injury and postoperative dysrhythmias.
- May minimize renal and intestinal injury.

There have, however, been significant concerns regarding the risk of air embolism.

#### *Use of topical haemostatic agents*

Use of these agents has also been suggested:

- Employing localized compression as a scaffold for clot formation, e.g. surgicel or
- As anastomotic sealants as a spray.
- There seems to be some evidence of d bleeding but limited evidence of d transfusion requirements.

#### *Topical antifibrinolytics*

There is some evidence of a benefit of administration of antifibrinolytic agents such as tranexamic acid directly to the wound at closure.

#### *Off-pump procedures*

These may confer advantages (OPCAB) by avoiding some of the potential provoking factors of bypass (haemodilution, contact with artificial surfaces, platelet damage).

## *Avoid excesses of blood pressure*

Hypertension may lead to i blood loss from suture lines after aortotomy.

### *Good surgical haemostasis*

Never to be underestimated in reducing blood loss.

## **Optimizing transfusion practice**

### *MSBOS (maximum surgical blood ordering schedule)*

Unit-specific protocols for ordering a predetermined number of units of blood for each surgical procedure based on likelihood of use have been proven to decrease blood wastage. Good practice states that the cross-match to transfusion ratio should be no greater than 2:.

#### *Guidelines/transfusion triggers*

There are several different guidelines available to optimize transfusion practice, some looking specifically at cardiac surgery.

Recent STS/ SCA guidelines suggests:

- Adoption of a transfusion trigger of 7g/dL Hb postoperatively although each patient should be assessed individually for evidence of impaired oxygen delivery.
- There is no evidence supporting transfusion where Hb >0g/dL.
- A trigger of 6g/dL is suggested during bypass.
- Given that a significant volume of colloid has been added during bypass, it is normal to tolerate lower Hb concentrations in the expectation that the patient will increase their urine output and the haematocrit will rise over the first few hours post bypass.

#### *Algorithms*

Introduction of a transfusion algorithm alone has been proven to decrease transfusion requirements. These should, of course, be evidence-based.

#### *Near-patient testing*

This will be discussed further (see b Viscoelastic tests, p. 65) however there are several cardiac surgical publications demonstrating d red cell and blood product use with ROTEM®/TEG® and publications which also demonstrate significant cost savings.

Individually the effect of many of these interventions is small. It is only through the adoption of a multimodal and multidisciplinary approach to blood conservation that the best results can be obtained.

## **Point-of-care testing**

Point-of-care testing may be defined as any analytical test performed by a healthcare professional outside the laboratory setting which should generate results comparable to the local laboratory with matching reference ranges. Unfortunately laboratory testing can be slow and results will reflect the patient's status at the time the samples were taken; in cardiac surgery the situation may have altered significantly by the time the results are reported. The aim with all point-of-care tests is to obtain results more quickly than could be obtained by regular laboratory testing, that they may more appropriately guide therapy.

## **Blood gas analysis**

Will give rapid and reliable information on:

- Hb concentrations and haematocrits to guide transfusion decisions
- Electrolyte disturbances (with particular reference to K and Ca)
- Acid–base abnormalities and lactate concentrations
- Glucose.

#### **Haemoglobin analysers**

Most units would use blood gas analysis for Hb measurement nowadays; however, analysers such as HemoCue® are available for assessment of Hb.

### **Coagulation monitors**

Hand-held monitors of coagulation are available giving prothrombin time (PT) and INR results.

#### **ACT**

Although the ACT is a fairly crude test (using a tube containing an activator such as diatomaceous earth and a magnet rotating in a well) it is commonly used in cardiac units as a means of monitoring the effect of heparin administration.

- There are several devices available some offering heparinase-adjusted results, some offering accelerated results.
- Unit protocols dictate the acceptable levels for commencement of CPB but 400 or 480 seconds are common.
- It is important to note that the ACT is not solely dependent on the effects of heparin; it also depends on platelet and fibrinogen interactions.
- *After protamine administration, a further test is performed to assess a return towards baseline*.

#### **Hepcon®**

An automated device which measures:

- The heparin dose response
- Heparin–protamine titration, predicting the required dose of protamine
- Some authors have suggested such direct measurements of heparin concentration as a more appropriate measurement and as a better method to monitor anticoagulation on bypass and heparin reversal.

## **Viscoelastic tests**

These tests were first described in the 940s and have regained favour in the last 5 years as concerted attempts have been made to decrease blood transfusion.

- There are two commercially available systems—ROTEM® and TEG®.
- Both are viscoelastic tests, i.e. they test the 'stickiness' of clot and provide an overview of the coagulation system including assessment of platelet function and of the plasma-based factors.
- They test not only how rapidly clot forms but if the clot becomes and remains stable.
- The systems both rely on placing blood in a cuvette into which a pin is inserted. In ROTEM® this pin rotates back and forth by approximately 4° (Fig. 7.) and in TEG the cup rotates by a similar amount. As clot forms between the pin and the wall of the cup, this change in tension is detected and is transformed into the ROTEM®/TEG® trace (Fig. 7.2).
- The traces produced are somewhat similar and each parameter can be related to certain aspects of the coagulation process allowing a rapid and accurate diagnosis of any coagulopathy and therefore the institution of early appropriate treatment.
- CT (clotting time)/r time = the time from the start of the test until the first clot forms—prolonged by factor deficiency and heparin excess. Performance of a HEPTEM/heparinase test would help differentiate.
- CFT (clot formation time)/k time = the time from clot first forming until the amplitude reaches 20mm—prolonged by factor deficiency or platelet abnormality.
- Alpha angle reflects rate of clot formation.
- MCF (maximum clot firmness) reflects deficiencies of fibrin or platelet function abnormality. Performance of a FIBTEM test would help differentiate.
- MA (maximum amplitude) is the equivalent of MCF for TEG® and is said to reflect platelet abnormality although functional fibrinogen testing is available for TEG®.
- ML (maximum lysis) reflects fibrinolysis.
- It has been suggested that these tests are the gold standard in diagnosing hyperfibrinolysis.

There are various tests available for both machines. ROTEM® specifically uses the addition of different activating agents to further localize any abnormality as part of the diagnostic algorithm:

- It is important to recognize that neither system will identify the effects of drugs (antiplatelet agents, warfarin) on routine testing.
- While it is important to rapidly identify the presence of coagulopathy, it is equally important to identify the absence of a coagulopathy which would imply a surgical cause for any haemorrhage allowing early re-exploration.

Use of thromboelastometry or thromboelastography has been recommended by QIS (Quality Improvement Scotland) as a clinical and cost-effective measure in cardiac surgery.

## **Platelet function tests**

Given the increasing use of antiplatelet agents either alone or in combination, platelet function testing may be an increasingly useful/valuable diagnostic tool:

- There are several devices commercially available, e.g. Multiplate®, VerifyNow®, PFA-00®.
- While each use different technologies to obtain the results, they will all give information on platelet function and most give information on the effects of antiplatelet agents.
- While resistance to aspirin is rare, responsiveness to clopidogrel varies between studies but resistance may be as high as 40%. Those who are not responsive are clearly no more likely to bleed than those not on the drug.
- These tests may allow patients at genuinely i risk of bleeding perioperatively to be targeted by some of the more expensive blood conservation strategies.
