# Left ventricular failure

The assessment and management of the LV is covered in other chapters of this book. The anatomy and physiology are summarized here, followed by reference to the relevant chapters covering functional assessment and management.

# Anatomy and physiology of the LV

#### Anatomy

The LV receives oxygenated blood from the pulmonary veins and pumps it to the systemic circulation. It consists of:

- The mitral valve, forming the inlet to the ventricle
- The conical apical portion, containing fine trabeculations
- The outflow tract leading to the aortic valve.

The muscle fibres of the LV are formed in multiple overlapping sheets. Myocardial contractility is spiral, producing radial contractility and longitudinal shortening. The LV appears circular in short-axis view.

#### Physiology

- The systemic LV is a high-pressure system.
- Coronary perfusion occurs in diastole over four phases; isovolumic relaxation, rapid filling, diastasis, and atrial systole.
- Volume preloading increases stroke volume within the limits of the Starling effect.
- The ventricle responds to † afterload through † contractility and over time through muscle hypertrophy.

#### LV functional assessment

#### Cardiac output

Chapter 24 on central venous cannulation (CVC), pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) and minimally invasive CO monitoring describes the indications for and advantages of the invasive PAC and minimally invasive CO monitoring in the assessment and ongoing management of cardiogenic shock. The PAFC provides direct measurement of pulmonary pressures, SvO<sub>2</sub>, and CO, while pulse contour analysis, thoracic bioimpedance measurement, and oesophageal Doppler provide minimally invasive derived measures of CO.

#### Anatomical and functional assessment

Chapter 32 on bedside echocardiography describes the indications of both transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) in the CICU. The size, degree of filling, and contractility of the LV can be assessed. In addition, regional wall-motion abnormalities can be defined and culprit vessels identified.

# Management of the failing LV

Management: general principles and the management of reversible causes

Chapter 7 on hypotension and low CO describes the general principles of managing patients with a poorly functioning LV following a standard ABC

approach. In addition, identification and management of reversible causes including myocardial ischaemia are described.

# *Contractility: pharmacological support*

Chapter 27 on circulatory support details the pharmacological actions of different classes of inotropes together with their indications. The selection and safe use of a particular vasoactive agent is based on knowledge of its cardiovascular effects, clinical indications, and an understanding of its clinical use.

# *Contractility: mechanical support*

Chapter 27 on circulatory support goes on to describe the indications and use of mechanical and extracorporeal life support. This includes the use of IABP counterpulsation, short-term VADs, long-term VADs, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

# **Right ventricular failure**

# **Anatomy and physiology of the RV**

The RV differs from the LV in structure and function. The right side of the heart can be more difficult to assess and treat. Its interdependence with the LV highlights the importance of its careful assessment and optimization in the compromised patient.

#### *Anatomy*

The RV receives blood from systemic venous return and pumps it to the pulmonary circulation. It consists of:

- The sinus (inflow) below the tricuspid valve
- The free wall (providing contractility) which is thin walled
- The infundibulum (outflow) leading to the pulmonary valve.

The RV contracts in a peristaltic pattern from the sinus to the infundibulum. It relies on longitudinal shortening more than the LV.

The RV appears triangular when viewed from the side and crescentic when viewed in cross section.

# *Ventricular interdependence*

The RV wraps around the LV: up to 30% of the contractile energy of the RV is generated by the LV.

The LV and RV are enclosed in a non-expanding pericardium. Overdistention of the RV within this closed sac compromises LV contractile performance primarily by reducing LV preload.

#### *Physiology*

- The RV is a low-pressure system (Fig. .).
- RV wall stress is low. Coronary perfusion occurs in systole and diastole. An acute increase in afterload reduces coronary perfusion, so reducing contractile performance.
- Loss of forward flow from the RV increases RA pressure, reducing systemic venous return.

# **The right ventricle**

- Is a thin-walled low-pressure system.
- It is exquisitely volume sensitive.
- There is functional interdependence with the LV.
- The RVs response to i preload or afterload is overdistention.

# **RV functional assessment**

The complex morphology of the RV makes volume and functional assessment difficult. The current clinical standard is echocardiographic visual assessment of the RV with surrogate markers of contractility. Assessment should be corroborated in multiple views.

# *RV dilatation*

TOE: mid-oesophageal four-chamber view or TTE: apical four-chamber view:

- RV should be approximately half LV size
- LV should form the apex.

# *Paradoxical septal motion*

TOE: transgastric short-axis view of LV or TTE: parasternal short axis:

• Paradoxical septal motion in systole, reflecting the presence of RV systolic overload.

The patient in Fig. .2a exhibited normal septal motion with a pure spherical LV. The patient in Fig. .2b exhibited paradoxical septal motion at the end of systole and beginning of diastole reflecting systolic overload of the RV.

# **Surrogate markers of contractility**

# *TAPSE (normal > 6mm)*

Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion can be assessed in the TTE apical four-chamber view with M-mode, measuring the distance of tricuspid annular movement between end-diastole and end-systole.

# *Fractional area change (normal > 35%)*

Other indirect measures of RV function include:

# *ECG*

- RV strain
- New atrial fibrillation (AF).

# *Pulmonary artery floatation catheter*

- The only way to directly measure right heart pressures. The gold standard for CO monitoring.
- Direct measurement of PAP allows continuous monitoring of therapy to reduce PAP.
- PAWP provides an indirect measure of left heart filling pressure and thus preload.

# **Management of the failing RV**

RV function has often been overlooked in critically ill patients. The last decade has seen a significant advance in the understanding of RV haemodynamics and appreciation of their importance in global cardiac performance.

The RV can fail because of:

- Volume overload (*preload*)
- Impaired *contractility*, or
- Pressure overload (*afterload*).

#### *When to suspect RV failure*

In the CICU, clinical situations to consider RV failure include:

- Disproportionate rise in CVP (suggesting i preload, particularly in association with tricuspid valve incompetence)
- Myocardial stunning following reperfusion
- RV ischaemia and infarction, either due to sustained hypotension or coronary occlusion
- When the LV is underfilled but the CVP is high and the RV is distended there may be RV failure
- Septic shock
- Pulmonary hypertension (primary or acquired)
- Acute respiratory distress syndrome (5% develop right heart failure)
- Secondary to LV failure (ventricular interdependence).

# **Management: general principles**

#### *Optimize ventilation*

- FiO2 to maintain normoxia
- Avoid high intrathoracic pressures:
  - • Ventilate at 6–8mL/kg, avoid inspiratory pressure >30mmHg
  - • Avoid auto-PEEP
- • Avoid hypoxia, acidosis, and/or hypercarbia as these contribute to pulmonary vasoconstriction.

#### Maintain sinus rhythm (aim for HR 90-110bpm)

- · Consider electrical cardioversion for atrial tachyarrhythmias
- Or pacing for symptomatic bradyarrhythmias.

#### Optimize preload

- If uncertain, 100mL crystalloid fluid challenge and assess response.
- If volume overloaded use IV diuretics in the first instance. If there is no response to diuretics consider ultrafiltration.
- If underfilled, decide on appropriate replacement fluid and continue to bolus in 100mL aliquots until euvolaemic.
- Support contractility:
  - Pharmacological (see A Pharmacological support, p. 288)
  - Surgical (see Mechanical circulatory support: extracorporeal life support, p. 294).

# Reduce afterload

- Pulmonary vasodilators such as inhaled nitric oxide, or nebulized iloprost.
- Once stable consider IV or oral vasodilators such as sildenafil or epoprostenol.
- Minimize blood production transfusion.

The general principles are described in Fig. 11.3.

# **Key point**

In acute RV failure, every effort should be made to avoid systemic hypotension, which may lead to a vicious cycle of RV ischaemia and further hypotension.

# Contractility: pharmacological support

There is no evidence for the best inotrope regimen to use in right heart failure. Useful drugs are outlined here. Use should be tailored to the patient's haemodynamics and local guidelines. One logical sequence is suggested in the management algorithm (see Fig. 11.3).

#### Adrenaline

- Infusion starting at 0.05mcg/kg/min (working range 0.02–0.2mcg/kg/min)
- Useful resuscitation drug and first-line inotrope

- Undesirable effects:
  - Proarrhythmic
  - Hyperglycaemi
  - Hyperglycaemia
  - † myocardial oxygen demand.

  - • Arrhythmia including reflex bradycardia
  - • Severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction.

# **Mechanical support**

Mechanical cardiac support for short-term use covers a spectrum of techniques that can be classified as follows:

- Intra-aortic counter pulsation with an IABP
- Extracorporeal ventricular support—*short-term*:
  - • Short-term VADs
  - • ECMO.

In patients with severe RV dysfunction, a right ventricular assist device (RVAD) may be considered. RVADs may be used alone or in combination with LVADs.

Short-term VADs have a potential duration of support of days to weeks. An exit strategy must be identified before device implantation. This may be ventricular recovery, or as bridge to destination therapy or transplantation. If there is associated hypoxia there may be benefit in combining short-term ventricular support with oxygenation in an ECMO circuit.

Commonly used short-term devices in the UK include the Levitronix CentriMag™ VAD. This device can act as a RVAD, LVAD, or BiVAD. The pump is outside the body. Flow is non-pulsatile, but residual ventricular ejection may add pulsatility.

See b Mechanical circulatory support: extracorporeal life support, p. 294 for further discussion of mechanical circulatory support.

# **Key point**

An exit strategy should always be identified before embarking on any form of mechanical support.

# **Afterload reduction**

#### *Pulmonary hypertension*

• Mean pulmonary artery pressure ≥25mmHg at rest or >30mmHg on exercise.

Acute management options in severe pulmonary hypertension:

- Seek expert help.
- High-flow oxygen is a potent pulmonary vasodilator.
- Specific pulmonary vasodilator therapy—first line:
  - • If intubated, inhaled nitric oxide
  - • If not intubated, nebulized iloprost.
- IV and oral agents may be used to wean inhaled nitric oxide, consider sildenafil, epoprostenol.
- Consider ECMO ± RVAD if the RV is failing despite medical therapy.

• Atrial septostomy is used in chronic pulmonary hypertension, but may be considered in the acute setting. This creates a right-to-left shunt at atrial level with afterload reduction of the right heart. This is at the expense of resultant cyanosis.

# *Nitric oxide*

- *Delivered via a dedicated ventilator circuit*
- *Start at 20ppm (range 0–20ppm)*
- Smooth muscle relaxation mediated through cGMP
- Undesirable effects:
  - • Humidification should be avoided to prevent formation of nitric acid
  - • Withdrawal should be cautious to avoid rebound pulmonary hypertension.

#### *Iloprost*

- *First dose: 2.5mcg nebulized*
- *Thereafter: 5mcg 6–9 times/day (>2 hours apart)*
- Inhaled prostacyclin PGI2
- Undesirable effects:
  - • Systemic hypotension.

# *Sildenafil*

- *IV 0mg three times a day (named patient prescription)*
- *Oral 20mg three times a day*
- Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, blocks metabolism of nitric oxide
- Undesirable effects:
  - • Systemic hypotension and headache.

### *Epoprostenol (Flolan®)*

- *Infusion starting at 2ng/kg/min*
- *Increment by –2ng/kg/min every 5 minutes*
- Prostacyclin
- Short half-life, potential to titrate in the unstable patient
- Undesirable effects:
  - • *Avoid in severe LVSD*
    - • Hypotension
  - • Flushing, headache.

# **Reversible causes**

Reversible causes should be identified and treated once initial management is underway.

#### *RV myocardial stunning*

- Transient (usually up to 24 hours) systolic and diastolic dysfunction persisting after ischaemia and subsequent reperfusion.
- Intraoperative volatile anaesthesia offers pre-conditioning benefit.
- Inotropic support improves performance of stunned myocardium.

#### *RV myocardial infarction*

- Classical triad of hypotension, elevated CVP, and clear lung fields.
- Diagnosis:

- • ECG: ST elevation in inferior (II, III, and aVF) and/or right ventricular leads (right-sided chest leads). Caution not to overlook posterior changes (ST *depression* in V–3 with dominant R-wave pattern).
- • Echo: this is the key diagnostic tool demonstrating that the RV is dilated with systolic dysfunction.
- If this occurs in the postoperative period after cardiac surgery immediate revascularization should be considered. This may be surgical but is increasingly achieved with PCI. Time is myocardium!

# *Pulmonary hypertension—acquired, mitral valve disease*

- Severe mitral stenosis (valve area <.0cm2 ) is associated with reversible pulmonary hypertension. Supportive measures may be required in the immediate postoperative phase after mitral valve replacement.
- Untreated severe mitral stenosis can be diagnosed with echocardiography. TOE will demonstrate the mechanism of the valve lesion and can identify whether transcatheter balloon valvuloplasty is feasible. If not then urgent valve surgery may be required.

# *Pulmonary hypertension—acquired, thromboembolic disease*

- Although rare in the immediate postoperative period in cardiac surgery, pulmonary embolism (PE) may be seen in long-term patients and those admitted for non-surgical care.
- PE presenting with cardiogenic shock has a mortality of 20–50%.
- Management of acute PE depends on the severity of haemodynamic consequence. If there are no features of shock (tachycardia or hypotension) then anticoagulation with heparin is sufficient. If the patient is haemodynamically compromised by PE then the clot should be dispersed. The options include:
  - • Thrombolysis
  - • Catheter fragmentation
  - • Surgical embolectomy.

# **Valve heart disease**

# **Aortic stenosis**

# *Aetiology*

The majority of patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) are elderly. The predominant aetiology is degenerative calcific valve disease. Some may present because of rheumatic heart disease and may have other valve involvement.

In a young person there should be a high index of suspicion of a congenitally abnormal valve, e.g. bicuspid. This has an association with aortic coarctation.

The differential diagnosis for AS is LVOT obstruction.

# *Definition*

- Transvalvular velocity and hence gradient is dependent on LV systolic function, and should be interpreted in this context. A patient with poor LV function will generate a lower gradient across a valve with reduced area than a patient with a good ventricle. See Table ..
- Timing of corrective intervention is determined by the presence or absence of symptoms.

| Table .<br>Quantification of aortic stenosis |            |               |              |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------|---------------|--------------|
|                                                 | Valve area | Mean gradient | Jet velocity |
| Mild                                            | >.5cm2    | <25mmHg       | <3.0m/s      |
| Moderate                                        | .0–.5cm2 | 25–40mmHg     | 3.0–4.0m/s   |
| Severe                                          | <.0cm2    | >40mmHg       | >4.0m/s      |
|                                                 |            |               |              |

*Pathophysiology* The LV undergoes concentric hypertrophy to overcome LV outflow obstruction. The i wall tension together with thickened myocardium renders the endocardium vulnerable to ischaemia. The ventricle may then progress to fail. The failing ventricle will dilate and the walls will progressively thin.

# *Natural history*

There is a long latent period in the development of AS where patients remain asymptomatic and the risk of sudden death is low. The presentation of severe AS is with dyspnoea, exercise limitation, and syncope. The average survival after the onset of symptoms is 2–3 years with a high risk of sudden death.

#### *Management options*

Surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) is indicated in patients with:

- Symptomatic severe AS
- Severe or moderate AS when undergoing surgery to the coronaries, the aorta or other heart valves.

Surgical AVR may be considered in patients with asymptomatic AS when:

- There is an abnormal response to exercise or a likelihood of rapid progression of disease. In addition if valve area is <0.6cm2 and predicted surgical mortality is low
- LV systolic dysfunction.

Percutaneous aortic balloon valvuloplasty may be considered:

- In a haemodynamically unstable adult as a bridge to surgery
- As palliation in a patient with severe AS who is unfit for surgery.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation is an alternative to AVR in patients:

- At high risk because of comorbidities
- With a hostile chest—previous sternotomy, thoracic radiotherapy, porcelain aorta precluding aortic cannulation.

# *Postoperative pitfalls*

While the postoperative course of the patient undergoing AVR follows the typical pattern outlined in Part of this book, there are unique pitfalls to be aware of:

- The hypertrophied LV is at risk of poor myocardial protection, and so may have a prolonged period of stunning after CPB.
- The stunned heart is volume sensitive and requires careful attention to maintaining preload. There is a dependence on atrial filling, and DDD pacing is preferred. In addition, the hypertrophied myocardium requires a high perfusion pressure to maintain endocardial perfusion and may require vasopressors.
- Typically, once contractile function has returned, the ventricle is contracting against a reduced afterload, and so there is a tendency to systemic hypertension.
- AV dissociation is a recognized postoperative complication and a proportion of patients will require permanent pacing.
- All patients will require attention to postoperative anticoagulation.

#### **Subaortic obstruction**

Subaortic stenosis may present as a fixed or dynamic obstruction below the level of the aortic valve. It may present *de novo* or consequent to mitral valve (MV) repair or AV surgery.

### *Aetiology*

- Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is morphologically characterized by LV hypertrophy, and may have associated MV anomaly. Subaortic obstruction occurs in the form with high septal hypertrophy or a sigmoid septum.
- Systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the anterior leaflet of the MV may occur after MV repair when the anterior leaflet of the MV is sucked into the LVOT by the Venturi effect.
- Mid-ventricular obstruction and SAM after aortic surgery.
- Fixed discrete subaortic stenosis, which may occur in association with other congenital anomalies (VSD, patent ductus arteriosus, coarctation of aorta), or may be an acquired lesion.

#### *Presentation*

Presentation may range from mild exertional symptoms to syncope and in the surgical patient as failure to wean from CPB.

# *Management*

Medical management focuses on:

- Maintenance of sinus rhythm with a slow normal HR
- Avoid hypovolaemia
- Avoid the use of inotropes.

Surgical correction of the underlying lesion provides definitive treatment.

# **Aortic regurgitation—chronic**

# *Aetiology*

Chronic aortic regurgitation (AR) most commonly presents in the elderly as a degenerative disease.

# *Definition*

Chronic AR is always associated with i LV dimensions. The timing of corrective intervention is determined by LV function *and dimensions*. See Table .2.

| Table .2<br>Quantification of chronic aortic regurgitation |                                     |                                 |                         |  |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------|--|

| Severe                                                       | >65%LVOT                            | >0.6cm                          | >50%                    |  |

#### *Pathophysiology*

The LV is volume overloaded. There is an increase in end-diastolic volume. i compliance prevents an increase in end-diastolic pressure and the ventricle hypertrophies to maintain EF. Over time the end-diastolic pressure increases, the LV dilates, and the thickened myocardium renders the endocardium vulnerable to ischaemia. The ventricle may then progress to fail.

# *Natural history*

There is a long latent period in the progression of disease. Prognosis is associated with LV size rather than onset of symptoms. Regular follow-up and imaging is thus essential.

#### *Management options*

- Surgical AVR is indicated in patients with:
  - • Severe AR who are symptomatic or have LV systolic dysfunction
  - • Severe AR who are undergoing CABG
- Surgical AVR is reasonable in patients with:
  - • Severe AR, preserved LV systolic function, but severely dilated LV (>75mm)
- Surgical AVR may be considered in patients with:
  - • Moderate AR who are undergoing surgery on the ascending aorta or coronary arteries.

# *Postoperative pitfalls*

The LV is dilated, may have reduced systolic function, and is working against an i afterload following valve replacement:

- The ventricle will require careful attention to maintain pre-load.
- Consider early institution of inotropic support.
- AV dissociation is a recognized postoperative complication and a proportion of patients will require permanent pacing.
- All patients will require attention to postoperative anticoagulation.

# **Aortic regurgitation—acute**

#### *Aetiology*

Acute AR is most commonly associated with bacterial endocarditis and aortic dissection. Typically the LV is not dilated.

# *Definition*

Classification of severity is the same as in chronic AR but the LV dimensions are unchanged. See Table .3.

| Table .3 | Quantification of acute aortic regurgitation |                                 |                         |

#### *Pathophysiology*

The acute volume loading of the non-adapted LV results in i LV end-diastolic and left atrial pressures. Patients typically present in pulmonary oedema and cardiogenic shock. This deterioration is exacerbated in patients with a poorly compliant ventricle, for example, the hypertensive patient who presents with AR secondary to aortic dissection.

# *Natural history*

Death due to pulmonary oedema, ventricular arrhythmias, electromechanical dissociation, or circulatory collapse is common in acute severe AR, even with intensive medical management. The timing of surgical intervention in patients with bacterial endocarditis depends on the degree of compromise. Ideally the infection is eradicated at the time of surgery by 6 weeks of antibiotics. Sometimes the patient's deteriorating clinical condition precludes this.

#### *Management options*

The timing of surgical intervention in patients with bacterial endocarditis depends on the degree of cardiorespiratory compromise. Ideally a full course of antibiotics will be completed preoperatively.

Medical management may temporize clinical deterioration:

- Dobutamine or dopamine to augment forward flow and GTN to reduce after load
- AVR provides definitive treatment.

# *Postoperative pitfalls*

As for patients after AVR for AR, with the compounding variable of a septic picture.

# **Aortic regurgitation—functional**

#### *Aetiology*

Functional AR is caused by aortic root dilatation. The valve is usually morphologically normal with a dilated annulus. Typically the LV is not dilated.

# *Definition*

Classification of severity is the same as in chronic AR. LV dimensions are unchanged.

# *Pathophysiology*

The pathophysiology of functional AR mirrors chronic AR. Volume overloading of the LV leads to progressive dilation and eventual decompensation of the ventricle.

# *Management options*

Decision-making considers both the sequele of the AR and the disease of the ascending aorta.

The aortic root may be abnormal because of Marfan's syndrome, dissection, or chronic dilatation secondary to hypertension or a bicuspid aortic valve.

In general, AVR and aortic root reconstruction are indicated in patients with disease of the aortic root or proximal aorta and AR of any severity when:

- Dilatation of the aorta or aortic root reaches or exceeds 5.0cm by echocardiography (some consider surgery at 4.5cm)
- Based on a rate of increase of 0.5cm per year or greater.

# *Postoperative pitfalls*

The postoperative management is as for patients after AVR for AR, with the additional caveat that the systolic pressure should be controlled to protect the ascending aorta.

# **Mitral stenosis**

#### *Aetiology*

Mitral stenosis (MS) is most commonly secondary to rheumatic carditis.

Congenital MS is rare as are other acquired causes of MV obstruction. Other causes include left atrial myxoma, ball valve thrombus, mucopolysaccharidosis, and severe annular calcification.

#### *Definition*

Mitral stenosis is an obstruction to LV inflow at the level of the mitral valve. Normal MV area is 4–5cm2 . See Table .4.

| Table .4<br>Quantification of mitral stenosis |            |                    |                    |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------|--------------------|--------------------|
|                                                 | Valve area | Pressure half time | Mean pressure drop |
| Mild                                            | .6–2.0cm2 | 7–39ms           | <5mmHg             |
| Moderate                                        | .0–.5cm2 | 40–29ms          | 5–0mmHg           |
| Severe                                          | <.0cm2    | >29ms             | >0mmHg            |

# *Pathophysiology*

There is progressive dilation of the LA, with subsequent development of AF, pulmonary hypertension and the risk of atrial clot formation which may embolize systemically.

# *Natural history*

Patients remain asymptomatic while the MV area is >.5cm<sup>2</sup> . Symptoms of dyspnoea are associated with reduced cardiac output and i flow across the MV, initially with exercise and subsequently at rest. Symptoms accelerate with the development of atrial arrhythmias and pulmonary hypertension.

### *Management options*

MV surgery is indicated for patients with severe MS and moderate MS associated with severe symptoms, pulmonary hypertension, or coexisting moderate to severe MR.

#### *Postoperative pitfalls*

While the postoperative course of the patient undergoing MVR follows the typical pattern outlined in Part of this book, there are unique pitfalls to be aware of:

- Pulmonary hypertension may take months to resolve after MVR and patients are prone to right heart failure in the immediate postoperative phase.
- AF is common postoperatively.

# **Mitral regurgitation—organic**

# *Aetiology*

Organic MR incudes all aetiologies where leaflet abnormalities are the cause of the regurgitation. There is a declining incidence of rheumatic fever and degenerative changes are now the most common cause of organic MR.

# *Definition*

See Table .5.

|          | Vena contracta | Jet area/LA | PISA radius |
|----------|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| Mild     | <0.3cm         | <20%        | <0.4cm      |
| Moderate | 0.3–0.7cm      | 2–39%      | 0.4–.0cm   |
| Severe   | >0.7cm         | >40%        | >.0cm      |

# *Pathophysiology*

There is progressive dilation of the LV with deterioration of LV systolic function as the end-diastolic dimension (EDD) increases. Caution in interpreting LV systolic function must be exercised, as the MR can flatter the appearance of the ventricular function.

At the same time the LA is volume overloaded and AF and pulmonary hypertension secondary to pulmonary congestion may develop.

### *Natural history*

MR may develop acutely, and patients present with rapidly developing symptoms or it may develop chronically with symptoms of more insidious onset.

Patients develop symptoms of LV failure as the function of the LV deteriorates, or when they decompensate with AF. The development of pulmonary hypertension is associated with breathlessness.

# *Management options*

The mitral valve may be surgically repaired or replaced. When replaced the mitral valve apparatus may be preserved or removed.

While there are no randomized trials it is accepted that where feasible and the expertise exists, mitral valve repair is the optimal surgical treatment. Preservation of the MV apparatus leads to better postoperative LV function.

Surgery is indicated in acute severe MR. Patients with chronic MR are considered for surgery when they become symptomatic, and develop AF or pulmonary hypertension.

# *Postoperative pitfalls*

The management of the postoperative patient follows the pattern outlined in Part of this book:

- The LV tends to have a high EDD and requires careful attention to preload.
- Pulmonary hypertension may take months to resolve and patients may be prone to right heart failure in the immediate postoperative period.

# **Mitral valve prolapse**

# *Definition*

Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is the systolic billowing of one or both mitral leaflets into the LA. It may or may not be associated with MR.

By definition, the valve prolapse is of 2mm or more above the mitral annulus in the long-axis parasternal view and other views.

### *Aetiology*

MV prolapse can be familial or non-familial.

### *Natural history*

The natural history of MVP is heterogeneous with most following a benign course.

When associated with MR, MVP will progress to dilatation of the LA and subsequent development of AF and pulmonary hypertension secondary to venous congestion. MR may also result in LV dysfunction and congestive heart failure.

If a chordae ruptures, the mitral valve leaflet may become flail.

#### *Management options and postoperative pitfalls*

As for mitral regurgitation—organic.

# **Mitral regurgitation—functional**

#### *Aetiology*

The mitral valve is structurally normal and the MR results from changes in LV geometry secondary to ischaemic changes. Functional MR is seen in LV dysfunction of ischaemic origin and cardiomyopathy.

#### *Natural history*

Functional MR is associated with a poorer prognosis, as by definition it is associated with LV dysfunction.

# *Management options*

The evidence base for the management of functional MR is weak. The predominant surgical technique is restrictive annuloplasty ring at the time of coronary revascularization when the MR is severe. Historically the operative risk is perceived as high; however, case series from experienced centres give good results. The management of mild or moderate MR is less clear.

#### *Postoperative pitfalls*

As for mitral regurgitation—organic.

# **Tricuspid valve regurgitation**

#### *Definition*

Trivial tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is frequently seen on echocardiography. Pathological TR is usually associated with RV dysfunction secondary to volume or pressure overload. See Table .6.

| Table .6<br>Quantification of tricuspid valve regurgitation |                      |                |             |             |  |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|--|
|                                                               | Hepatic vein<br>flow | Vena contracta | Jet area/LA | PISA radius |  |
| Mild                                                          | Sys dominance        | Undefined      | <5cm2       | <0.5cm      |  |
| Mod                                                           | Sys blunting         | <0.7cm         | 5–0cm2     | 0.6–0.9cm   |  |
| Severe                                                        | Sys reversal         | >0.7cm         | >0cm2      | >0.9cm      |  |

### *Aetiology and pathophysiology*

Severe TR is nearly always consequent to annular dilatation and RV dysfunction, whether it be because of pressure or volume overload.

- RV pressure overload:
  - • Left-sided heart disease
  - • Cor pulmonale
  - • Idiopathic pulmonary hypertension
- RV volume overload:
  - • Atrial septal defects
  - • Intrinsic RV disease
- Primary TR may result from trauma or endocarditis.

#### *Natural history*

Severe TR may be well tolerated for years, but ultimately has a high mortality. Operative intervention is associated with high mortality and the challenge of managing patients with severe TR is the decision-making regarding timing of surgery.

# *Management options*

The predominant surgical technique is the insertion of an annuloplasty ring. Valve replacement carries an operative mortality of 7–40%.

# *Postoperative pitfalls*

The management of the postoperative patient follows the pattern outlined in Part of this book.

In addition this group of patients is particularly vulnerable to right heart failure. See b Management of the failing RV, p. 88.

# **Tricuspid valve stenosis**

#### *Aetiology*

Tricuspid stenosis (TS) is uncommon but may be seen with rheumatic carditis. It may be missed, as commonly the MV symptoms predominate.

Right atrial masses may present a non-valvular obstruction of the RV.

# *Definition*

TS is an obstruction to RV inflow at the level of the tricuspid valve. Normal TV area is >7.0cm<sup>2</sup> . See Table .7.

| Table .7<br>Quantification of tricuspid valve stenosis |            |                    |            |  |  |
|----------------------------------------------------------|------------|--------------------|------------|--|--|
|                                                          | Valve area | Mean pressure drop | Inflow VTI |  |  |
| Normal                                                   | >7.0cm2    | –                  |            |  |  |
| Severe                                                   | <.0cm2    | >5mmHg             | >60cm      |  |  |

### *Pathophysiology and natural history*

The presentation of TS is usually over shadowed by associated valve abnormalities.

Signs of progressive right heart failure may develop.

#### *Management options*

TV balloon valvuloplasty may be considered, but is associated with a high incidence of subsequent TR.

Conservative surgery or valve replacement dependent on the presenting anatomy and local expertise.

#### *Postoperative pitfalls*

While the postoperative course of the patient undergoing TV replacement follows the typical pattern outlined in Part of this book, patients are vulnerable to right heart failure. See b Management of the failing RV, p. 88.

#### **Pulmonary valve**

Disorder of the pulmonary valve is usually associated with congenital heart disorders. For discussion regarding the pulmonary valve, see Chapter 9 on adult patients with congenital heart disease.

# **Common arrhythmias and their management**

# **Bradyarrhythmias**

Postoperative bradyarrhythmias requiring permanent pacemaker implantation occur in up to 4% of patients, most commonly after aortic valve surgery. The most common abnormalities are a nodal rhythm, sinus node dysfunction, and complete AV block. A further group of patients require heart rate support in the immediate postoperative period to achieve a target heart rate.

Epicardial pacing is the mainstay of heart rate in the postoperative phase. Transvenous pacing provides the backstop. Transcutaneous pacing and pharmacological therapies are useful to temporize.

#### *Pacing*

Most postoperative patients have epicardial pacing leads and their heart rates can be controlled (see b Introduction, p. 304).

Transcutaneous pacing may be administered through an external defibrillator as a temporizing measure when the bradyarrhythmia is associated with a low BP and no other therapy is immediately available. Heart rate is selected and gain i until capture is achieved. It is uncomfortable for the patient, who may require sedation.

Transvenous pacing requires the placement of a transvenous temporary pacing wire in the RV under X-ray guidance.

#### *Pharmacological management*

#### *Atropine*

- *Bolus 0.–0.6 mg*
- *Max. 3mg*
- Anticholinergic, increases firing at SA node increasing heart rate
- Competitive antagonist for muscarinic acetyl-choline receptor, reducing parasympathetic activity
- Undesirable effects:
  - • Short-acting and ineffective in AV block
  - • Vasodilation
  - • Reduced sweating and lacrimation
  - • Central nervous system (CNS) effects—confusion, excitation
  - • Dilated pupils.

#### *Isoprenaline*

- *Bolus 20mcg*
- *Then infusion –4mcg/min titrated to response*
- Sympathomimetic βand β2 adrenergic agonist
- Chronotrope, ionotrope, and peripheral vasodilation effects
- Undesirable effects:
  - • Proarrhythmic
  - • Rarely paradoxical airways resistance requiring cessation of the drug.

*Consider both directly and indirectly acting chronotropes*, e.g. adrenaline (direct) and dobutamine (indirect) if both inotropy and chronotropy is appropriate to the patient's condition.

# **Tachyarrhythmias—atrial fibrillation**

Tachyarrhythmias, particularly AF occur in up to 40% of patients following CABG and in up to 60% of patients following CABG and valve replacement.

# *Risk*

The risk of postoperative AF is highest in those with preoperative AF, i age, impaired LVEF, and hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia. Peak incidence is on day 3.

# *Prophylaxis*

There is some evidence for pharmacological prophylaxis of AF. The maintenance of potassium, magnesium, and calcium within the high normal range is effective first-line prophylaxis.

Amiodarone and β-blockers may be considered for prophylaxis of AF following cardiac surgery.

#### *Treatment*

*Patients in AF with haemodynamic compromise should have synchronized DC cardioversion.*

#### *Rate control*

AF without haemodynamic compromise following CABG can be treated with rate limiting therapy as 80% revert to sinus rhythm spontaneously within 24 hours and 90% revert spontaneously within 6 weeks.

Treatment options for rate limitation include the following:

- Electrolytes: the maintenance of potassium, magnesium, and calcium within the high normal range.
- Amiodarone provides rate control with the additional benefit that the patient may chemically cardiovert.
- β-blockers provide good rate control, but are not always appropriate to start in the very early postoperative period.
- Digoxin may be considered for rate control in AF.

#### *Persisting AF*

AF is more likely to persist following valve surgery and may persist in a small number of patients following CABG.

Anticoagulation for patients with AF persisting for 48 hours should be considered on a case-by-case basis. The benefit of preventing thrombotic emboli and stroke needs to be weighed against the risk of bleeding in the postoperative period.

Patients who tolerate rate-controlled AF may not require cardioversion. Those who tolerate it poorly should be considered for chemical cardioversion or for elective synchronized DC cardioversion.

*Where pharmacological therapy is used to treat AF, the need for persisting therapy should be reviewed within 6 weeks of hospital discharge*.

# **Tachyarrhythmias—ventricular**

Ventricular tachycardias associated with CABG have a variable effect on prognosis. Non-sustained VT and VF is commonly seen when coming off bypass, it is thought to be re-perfusion induced, and is typically benign. Ventricular tachycardias occurring later in the clinical course may be associated with a reversible underlying pathology such as cardiac tamponade or myocardial ischaemia which should be identified and treated.

# *Prophylaxis*

- Amiodarone is indicated for prophylaxis against ventricular arrhythmias in cardiac surgery.
- Maintenance of electrolytes (potassium, magnesium, and calcium) in the high normal range is indicated for prophylaxis against ventricular arrhythmias in cardiac surgery.

# *Pulseless VF and VT; VT with a pulse and haemodynamic compromise*

Patients with VF or pulseless VT should be defibrillated immediately.

Those with VT and a pulse who have haemodynamic compromise may require sedation before cardioversion.

Patients with refractory VF or pulseless VT should be managed by the CALS algorithm with early sternal re-opening, internal cardiac massage, and internal defibrillation. They may require re-institution of cardio-pulmonary bypass (see b Cardiac Surgery Advanced Life Support, p. 26).

# *VT with a pulse and no haemodynamic compromise*

Even in the absence of haemodynamic compromise, patients with persistent VT require cardioversion. This may be pharmacological with amiodarone, or electrical with synchronized DC cardioversion. Patients who are conscious will require sedation for this.

#### *Special circumstance*

Torsade de point (polymorphic VT characterized by a change in amplitude of the QRS complexes with twisting around an isoelectric line) in an otherwise stable patient is managed medically with magnesium.
