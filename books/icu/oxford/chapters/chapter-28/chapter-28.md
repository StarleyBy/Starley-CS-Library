Many patients require a short period of pacing after separation from CPB until the normal conduction pathways recover from the rigors of cardioplegia, cooling, and handling of heart. Some patients need it for longer and there may be an eventual need for a permanent pacemaker due to complications of surgery. The majority of patients never require pacing and it is difficult to predict which patients may need pacing. So, most surgeons implant ventricular wires (at least one) in all patients while some do so only when patients required pacing immediately prior to chest closure. Should a patient with a single ventricular wire require pacing a wire is placed under the skin and the pacing circuit completed by attaching the ventricular wire to the negative terminal of the pacing box.

Indications for postoperative pacing:

- Asystole or cardiac standstill
- Complete heart block or type II second-degree heart block
- Bradyarrhythmias (rate control better than with pharmacological intervention)
- Nodal or junctional rhythms
- To restore AV mechanical synchrony
- Sinus arrests
- Prophylaxis against AF
- High-rate burst pacing for control of atrial flutter
- Following heart transplantation.

When there is endogenous depolarization of the ventricle, this is more mechanically efficient because of the coordinated ventricular contraction. Every effort should be made not to initiate ventricular pacing by first trying atrial pacing. Therefore, atrial wires will be preferable when patients are likely to require pacing, advantages being:

- 25% increase in CO with atrial or AV sequential pacing
- Effect more pronounced in low ejection fraction
- ↑ LV filling in ventricular hypertrophy, d LV compliance—diastolic dysfunction or ischemia.

##### Informal convention for wires:

- Wires exiting right of sternum—atrial
- Wires exiting left of sternum—ventricular
- Atrial cables—blue tag
- Ventricular cables—white tag

##### Removal of wires:

- After return of normal coagulation
- Gentle traction and dislodgement by heart contractions
- Excessive resistance—cut close to skin, allowing ends to retract
- Observe patient for few hours—risk of tamponade
- Monitor ECG as risk of arrhythmias.

Consider permanent pacemaker when there is pacemaker dependence after 7 days. Common indications:

- Complete heart block
- Sinus node dysfunction
- Slow ventricular rate with atrial fibrillation
- 2nd-degree Mobitz type II block.

These are described using the NBG codes, of which only the first three are relevant in temporary epicardial pacing (Table 28.1).

| I             | II             | III                 |
|---------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Chamber paced | Chamber sensed | Response to sensing |
| <strong>0</strong>: none       | <strong>0</strong>: none        | <strong>0</strong>: none             |
| <strong>A</strong>: atrium     | <strong>A</strong>: atrium      | <strong>T</strong>: triggered        |
| <strong>V</strong>: ventricle  | <strong>V</strong>: ventricle   | <strong>I</strong>: inhibited        |

The pacing modes frequently used are as follows.

#### **Single chamber pacing modes**

##### *AOO*

Atrial asynchronous mode used in stable bradycardia with inappropriate sensing (electrocautery) and intact AV node conduction. Not in atrial tachycardia, flutter, fibrillation or AV nodal block.

##### *VOO*

Ventricular asynchronous mode used in bradycardia without reliable AV conduction and when use of electrocautery is causing inappropriate sensing. Also in an emergency as a rapid access function.

##### *AAI*

In the atrial demand mode the endogenous atrial depolarization is sensed and an impulse delivered if there is none detected in a cycle determined by the set rate. Used with an endogenous atrial rhythm and intact AV conduction. Not in atrial tachycardia, flutter, fibrillation, or AV nodal block.

##### *VVI*

The ventricular demand mode is similar to AAI, but the chamber involved is the ventricle. This is used when there is bradycardia with AV block, atrial flutter, AF, or sick sinus syndrome. Also, when atrial wires are avoided to decrease possible complications when need for pacing is predicted to be of short duration or to suppress ectopic beats with overdrive pacing. Downside is the loss of atrial contribution to ventricular filling.

##### *DDD*

This is the commonest and most useful mode when both atrial and ventricular wires are in place. The other dual chamber pacing modes are DOO, DVI, and DDI and will not be discussed in this section.

In DDD mode both chambers are sensed and paced in sequence. Firstly, as in AAI, if no endogenous atrial depolarization is detected in a predetermined rate-dependent cycle an impulse is delivered to the atrium. The pacemaker then waits for a ventricular impulse in response to atrial pacing or an endogenous atrial depolarization and delivers an impulse if none is detected within the cycle. This mode is used in all indications for pacing. There is a risk of ventricular tracking of atrial tachyarrhythmias which is off-set by setting a 'maximum tracking rate'.

Many of the commonly occurring postsurgical tachyarrhythmias can be treated by overdrive pacing. VF or VT may occur during the process and so needs adequate preparation:

##### **AV junctional tachycardia**

This is treated by using overdrive pacing of either atria (AAI or AOO) or sequential AV pacing (DDD or DOO). The cardiac rate is captured by pacing at 20% of the intrinsic rate and then gradually reduced, establishing stable sinus rhythm.

##### **Paroxysmal re-entrant supraventricular tachycardia**

Can be treated as described earlier or by using 'under-drive' pacing (at less than the supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) rate) if the pacing spike induces a refractory period in the re-entrant loop and abolishes it.

###### **Atrial flutter**

Over-drive pacing as previously described is effective in type I flutter with rates <320–340 but not in type II with higher rates.

##### **Failed SVT reversion with rapid ventricular response**

In this situation rapid atrial pacing at rates up to 800 beats/min may induce AF and may be preferable if the AV block is high enough to have a slower ventricular response. Sometimes this manoeuvre may induce reversion to sinus rhythm.

##### **Ventricular tachycardia**

Overdrive or underdrive pacing may terminate VT but remains a risky manoeuvre as it can precipitate VF.

<div class="details-content">

#### **Failure to pace**

This is differentiated from failure to capture by absence of pacing spikes (no electricity at wire tips) on ECG, a slower than set heart rate, and can be due to:

- Lead disconnection
- Lead malfunction (fractured wire)
- Battery depletion
- Over-sensing
- Cross-talk.

#### **Failure to capture**

There is presence of pacing spikes on ECG but is not followed by QRS complex or waveform on arterial pressure and pulse oximeter and can be due to:

- A low pacemaker output (mA)
- A high stimulation threshold
- Pacing wire displacement from myocardium
- i resistance due to fibrosis
- Myocardial ischemia
- Electrolyte imbalance
- Medications like β-blockers, verapamil, lidocaine, sotalol, flecainide, or propafenone.

Manoeuvres which may be helpful:

- Increasing pacemaker output
- Correction of exacerbating factors listed earlier
- Reversing polarity of bipolar pacing wires
- Changing to unipolar pacing with subcutaneous return pacing wire
- Temporary transvenous or oesophageal pacing if threshold progressively increasing
- Transcutaneous pacing in an emergency.

#### **Failure to sense**

This must be distinguished from normal pacemaker function with inappropriate settings. Check sensing threshold (see 📖 Mandatory checks).

#### **Cross-talk**

This occurs in dual-chamber pacing modes when the atrial pacing spike is sensed by the ventricular wire and inhibits ventricular output.

Manoeuvres which may be helpful:

- Reduce sensitivity (mV)
- Reduce pacing output (mA)

<summary><span style="font-size:110%">Mandatory checks</span></summary>
<div class="details-content">

The stimulation and sensing thresholds should be checked at the earliest opportune moment and then daily in addition to a battery check. Stimulation threshold checked in all patients and sensing threshold once an intrinsic rhythm has been established. The underlying rhythm should be checked regularly by turning down the pacing rate and letting the endogenous rhythm to emerge, thereby assessing ongoing need for pacing.

#### **Stimulation threshold**

This is the minimum output (mA) needed to consistently capture the heart.

#### **Method of assessing**

- Set rate at 10 above patient's intrinsic rate (if established)
- Decrease pacemaker output slowly until loss of capture
- Increase output until there is steady capture
- This is stimulation threshold
- Set output twice stimulation threshold.

#### **Sensing threshold**

This is the least sensitive setting (biggest mV value) at which the pacemaker can detect a heartbeat.

#### **Method of assessing**

- Set rate to 10 below patient's intrinsic rate.
- Set ventricular output to 0.1mA (this prevents an inadvertent 'R-on-T'-induced ventricular tachyarrhythmia).
- Press menu key until the menu is displayed (see Fig. 28.1 for a Medtronic pacemaker box menu).
- Highlight V sensitivity.
- Decrease sensitivity (increase mV value) until sense indicator stops flashing.
- Increase until it starts flashing again—sensing threshold.
- Set sensitivity dial to one half the mV value.
