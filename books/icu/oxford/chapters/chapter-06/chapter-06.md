# **Bleeding management**

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Introduction</summary>
<div class="details-content">
Cardiac surgery is responsible for 15% of all blood products used in the UK. All cardiac patients have some drainage from the chest drains postoperatively. This is variable in quantity and blood content with wide variations between units depending on individual protocols for:

- Bypass circuit types including oxygenators, filters, and cannulae
- Heparin and its reversal
- Perfusion temperatures
- Bypass duration.

Bleeding may be of surgical or non-surgical types and often causes haemodynamic instability and/or cardiac tamponade. These effects and subsequent transfusion are associated with multiple negative outcomes and an i mortality rate.

Excessive bleeding is difficult to define and definitions vary. A good rule of thumb is:

- >300mL in first hour
- >200mL/hour for 2 consecutive hours
- >150mL/hour for 4 consecutive hours.

Blood may accumulate in open pleural cavities and appear intermittently in significant aliquots.

It could be anticipated that up to 20% of patients may breach local protocols and that approximately 5% will require repeat sternotomy. It is often difficult to distinguish surgical haemorrhage from true coagulopathic bleeding, but left untreated surgical bleeding will progress to coagulopathy. Early re-sternotomy may limit exposure to unnecessary blood and factor replacement.

Identified patient factors for excessive bleeding include:

- Age >70 years
- Preoperative anaemia
- Female gender
- Small body size/low BMI
- Urgent or emergency status.

Cardiac surgery provides a unique set of circumstances to affect coagulation and fibrinolysis. The interaction of blood with non-endothelial surfaces in CPB releases tissue factors which activates cellular and humoral mechanisms; including the coagulation cascade, complement and fibrinolytic systems. Platelets and leucocytes are thereafter stimulated leading to the clinical effects of oedema, tissue injury, hyperfibrinolysis and a consumptive coagulopathy.

Excessive postoperative non-surgical bleeding is related to platelet dysfunction, impaired coagulation, and i fibrinolysis.

Technique and disease-specific issues include:

- Systemic heparinization
- Normovolaemic haemodilution with dilution of platelets and coagulation factors

- Substantive transfusion of salvaged blood may increase dilutional effects
- Hypothermia which continues into immediate perioperative period and increases with bypass duration
- Antithrombotic drug therapy
- Antiplatelet therapy
- Warfarin therapy—inhibits vitamin K-dependent synthesis of factors II, VII, IX, X.

<summary>Excessive bleeding</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Up to 5% of cardiac surgical patients will require re-sternotomy in the early postoperative period. Stable patients with higher than expected blood loss may return to theatre but unstable patients are best managed in the ITU environment (Fig. 6.1).

Bleeding may be:

- Overt with rapid or ongoing haemorrhage:
  - • >300mL in first hour
  - • >200mL/hour for 2 consecutive hours
  - • >150mL/hour for 4 consecutive hours
- Concealed presenting as haemodynamic instability and ongoing requirement for transfusion:
  - • *Beware pleural collections*, consider chest X-ray (CXR) and echo examination of the pleural spaces
- Localized to the pericardial cavity and present with cardiac tamponade. See Cardiac tamponade.

If untreated, bleeding and its complications will progress to cardiac arrest. Ongoing assessment and proactive management are important to avoid the additional complications of coagulopathy and massive transfusion.

The decision to re-open is complex. The patient's preoperative condition including recent anticoagulation, the duration of bypass, and any surgical difficulties in theatre all inform the decision of whether to perform re-sternotomy.

Patients who require re-exploration are more likely to have the complications of:

- Renal failure
- Sepsis
- Atrial fibrillation
- Prolonged mechanical ventilation
- ↑ hospital stay
- ↑ overall mortality.

<summary>Overt bleeding</summary>
<div class="details-content">

The pathophysiology of bleeding in cardiac surgery is complex and requires multiple approaches to minimize blood loss and transfusions.


<details class="med-details">
<summary>Transfusion</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Transfuse to keep the Hb >7g/dL postoperatively.
- There is no evidence supporting transfusion where Hb >10g/dL.
- Given that a significant volume of colloid has been added during bypass, it is normal to tolerate lower Hb concentrations in the immediate postoperative period in the expectation that the patient will increase their urine output and the haematocrit will rise over the first few hours post bypass.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Concealed bleeding</summary>
<div class="details-content">
Patients may have concealed haemorrhage if they require more volume replacement than anticipated in the first 2–4 hours after surgery. They are more likely to be tachycardic and BP will improve with transfusion of volume, but then fall again. Red cells will be required to maintain the haemoglobin >7g/dL:

- It is important to know if the pleurae are open following surgery, as blood may collect in the pleural spaces. A CXR will show ↑ opacification if there is a pleural collection.
- The peritoneum may be breached at sternotomy, and may become a reservoir for concealed haemorrhage.
- Both the upper and lower GI tract may conceal haemorrhage, and should be considered if the source of bleeding cannot be identified.
- Consider retroperitoneal haemorrhage if an IABP has been inserted.
- Persisting bleeding from the legs may occur if vein has been harvested during surgery. Inspection of the legs should be included in the search for hidden haemorrhage.

<summary>Cardiac tamponade</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Cardiac tamponade is the clinical syndrome when blood collects in the pericardial space reducing ventricular filling and causing haemodynamic compromise. This can be produced with rapid accumulations of <150mL.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Physiology</summary>
<div class="details-content">


<h5>Normal cardiac filling is bimodal:</h5>


- Initially venous return increases with the onset of ventricular contraction and subsequent decrease in intrapericardial pressure (x descent of CVP).
- Later RV filling in diastole with opening of tricuspid valve (y descent). This is diminished or absent in tamponade.

Diastolic filling is diminished when the transmural distending pressures are insufficient to overcome the intrapericardial pressures. Venous return is impeded with right atrial and ventricular collapse. Output is initially maintained by tachycardia. The compliance of the pulmonary vascular bed causes blood to pool in the venous circulation at the expense of LV filling and CO.

Whilst the pericardium may be reconstituted after valve surgery, this is rarely carried out in coronary revascularization. Despite the large potential space if the pleura is opened, localized tamponade on the right atrium can have significant haemodynamic effects.

Mediastinal chest drains are inserted as standard postoperative practice. However, they may occlude despite measures to maintain patency.

Early detection and treatment of cardiac tamponade is crucial in postoperative management. It often coexists in complex patients with low output states.


<h5>Classical features include:</h5>


- ↑ HR
- Pulsus paradoxus (exaggerated decrease in systolic BP in inspiration). May be 20–40mmHg in tamponade but difficult to diagnose in hypotensive or ventilated patients
- ↑ jugular venous pressure (JVP)/CVP
- ECG—low voltage complexes or electrical alternans.
- ↓ BP
- ↓ CO
- ↓ urinary output
- Cardiomegaly on CXR.


<h5>Atypical features:</h5>


- Failure to rewarm
- Unexpected dysrhythmias
- Lower than expected CO
- Metabolic/lactic acidosis.

###### Diagnosis may be difficult especially in patients with low output states. Echocardiography is a useful adjunct to diagnosis but a high index of clinical suspicion should always be present in:

- High-risk patients
- When higher than average mediastinal losses suddenly diminish
- Failure of patients to progress as expected.

Cardiac tamponade cannot be excluded with echocardiography. Classical features include:

- Echo-free space ant/post/global
