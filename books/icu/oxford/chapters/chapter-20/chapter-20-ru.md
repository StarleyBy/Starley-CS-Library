#### **Интенсивная pregnancy**

Пregnancy makes great demands on the cardiac function during pregnancy (Fig. 20.3). Patients with limited cardiac reserve can decompensate during pregnancy risking both maternal and fetal well-being. Complications can occur for up to several days after delivery. In the immediate aftermath of delivery there is an autotransfusion of placental blood which may precipitate cardiac volume overload.

Figure 20.3 Physiological changes in pregnancy. Systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) fall during pregnancy. BP may fall in the 2nd trimester, rising slightly in late pregnancy. Note that cardiac output and stroke volume peak by 6 weeks of gestation.

#### **Риск математальной смерти**

Аntenatal advice should be given to patients with significant cardiac disease. Exact prediction of maternal and fetal outcomes can be difficult with the progressive advances in medical care and the limited experience of pregnancy in rare cardiac diseases.

Мothers with complex cardiac disease should attend a joint clinic with a specialist cardiologist and the high-risk pregnancy obstetric team. The role of the clinic is to assess and advise the mother on the risk of pregnancy and to develop a plan to minimize these risks through close follow-up and medical intervention.

Патients at high risk of cardiac mortality should be delivered in a hospital which can provide specialist cardiac obstetric services (Table 20.).

#### **Исходные факторы риска**

- Кyanотическая кардиальная疾ность
- Пульмонарная гипертония
- Низкая функциональная statuses (Н York Heart Association (NYHA) III или IV)
- Низкая функциональная status left-sided obstruction.

Более пациентов с конгруэнтным heart disease sống sóтively и хотят рисковать pregnancy. Conjugated heart disease is known to carry a major risk with published maternal mortality rates of 40–50%. These types of patients require preoperative counselling of the risks involved. Complex cardiac disease in pregnancy is a classic example of a clinical condition where careful planning and excellent teamwork between multiple disciplines is required. These include obstetricians, cardiologists, paediatricians, midwives, anaesthetists, and intensivists.

Остебольников пациенты с конгруэнтным heart disease должны быть управляемы в специализированном центре cardiac obstetric team и доступны access cardiac critical care facility.

### **Анаестезиологические методы и delivery**

Гestation и метода приема на maternity могут быть определены по обстоятельствам фetus и well-being и cardiological assessment of the mother. In complex cardiac disease, the mother and fetus are assessed serially. Cardiac demands increase as pregnancy progresses; however, this has to be balanced against the fetal risk of premature delivery and the growth and maturity of the baby.

В moderate-risk pregnancies spontaneous delivery is preferred; however, in high-risk patients a caesarean section may be the delivery method of choice.

Анаестезиологический метод будет выбран responsible anaesthetist depending on host of factors. Awake regional anaesthesia is the preferred option adopted by many centres.

#### **Основные принципы**

- Левый талл (все время) для минимизации caval compression from gravid uterus.
- Качественное administration of Syntocinon® (5 units IV slowly) после delivery.
- Very cautious fluid administration.
- Vasopressor infusion for spinal anaesthesia. Phenylephrine is our preference.
- Full cardiac backup should be available for the high-risk cardiac obstetric caesarean section.

#### **Пользуемся regional technique**

Мать awake
-_lower risk of aspiration_
- Avoid general anaesthetic side effects
- Good pain relief.

#### **Возможные исключения от использования regional technique**

- Серьезный left-sided obstruction (аортово или мичковое стеноз)
- Серьезная cardiomyopathy
- Сpongios/spinal combined spinal epidural contraindicated by absolute contraindication such as dual antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation.

### **Пользуемся general anaesthesia**

- Устранение CVS и деградация при нойной heart Association (NYHA) III или IV
- Control of ventilation
- Easier to escalate support and insert lines.
- TOE monitoring possible.
