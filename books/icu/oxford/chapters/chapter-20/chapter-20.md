### **Introduction**

Cardiac disease can complicate pregnancy and can result in admission to a critical care unit. The most recent CMACE report 2006–2008 reported 2.3 deaths per maternities (Fig. 20.).

Cardiac causes remain first in the list of causes of maternal death (Fig. 20.2). Increasingly women with severe cardiac disease are opting for pregnancy with the expectation of good maternal and neonatal outcomes. This presents huge challenges for obstetric services and good outcomes are dependent on cardiac obstetric networks including excellent cardiac critical care.

## **The physiology of pregnancy**

Pregnancy makes great demands on the cardiac function during pregnancy (Fig. 20.3). Patients with limited cardiac reserve can decompensate during pregnancy risking both maternal and fetal well-being. Complications can occur for up to several days after delivery. In the immediate aftermath of delivery there is an autotransfusion of placental blood which may precipitate cardiac volume overload.

#### **The risk of maternal death**

Antenatal advice should be given to patients with significant cardiac disease. Exact prediction of maternal and fetal outcomes can be difficult with the progressive advances in medical care and the limited experience of pregnancy in rare cardiac diseases.

Mothers with complex cardiac disease should attend a joint clinic with a specialist cardiologist and the high-risk pregnancy obstetric team. The role of the clinic is to assess and advise the mother on the risk of pregnancy and to develop a plan to minimize these risks through close follow-up and medical intervention.

Patients at high risk of cardiac mortality should be delivered in a hospital which can provide specialist cardiac obstetric services (Table 20.).

### **Independent predictors of cardiac risk are:**

- Cyanotic heart disease
- Pulmonary hypertension
- Poor functional status (New York Heart Association (NYHA) III or IV)
- Poor systemic ventricular function
- Severe left sided obstruction.

More patients with congenital heart disease are surviving to adulthood and are wishing to risk pregnancy. Eisenmenger's syndrome is known to carry a major risk with published maternal mortality rates of 40–50%. These types of patients require preoperative counselling of the risks involved. Complex cardiac disease in pregnancy is a classic example of a clinical condition where careful planning and excellent teamwork between multiple disciplines is required. These include obstetricians, cardiologists, paediatricians, midwifes, anaesthetists, and intensivists.

Obstetric patients with complex cardiac disease should be managed in specialist units with an experienced cardiac obstetric team and access to cardiac critical care facility.

Medical interventions are sometimes indicated to improve maternal and neonatal outcome during pregnancy, such as mitral balloon valvuloplasty, coarctation repair, and treatment with anticoagulants or pulmonary vasodilators.

# **Anaesthetic techniques and the delivery**

The gestation and method of delivery will be determined by the high-risk obstetric team depending on fetal growth and well-being and the cardiac assessment of the mother. In complex cardiac disease, the mother and fetus are assessed serially. The cardiac demands increase as pregnancy progresses; however, this has to be balanced against the fetal risk of premature delivery and the growth and maturity of the baby.

In moderate-risk pregnancies a spontaneous delivery is preferred; however, in high-risk patients a caesarean section may be the delivery method of choice.

The anaesthetic technique will be decided by the responsible anaesthetist depending on a host of factors. Awake regional anaesthesia is the preferred option adopted by many centres.

#### **Basic principles**

- Lateral tilt at all times to minimize caval compression from gravid uterus.
- Careful administration of Syntocinon® (5 units IV slowly) post delivery.
- Very cautious fluid administration.
- Vasopressor infusion for spinal anaesthesia. Phenylephrine is our preference.
- Full cardiac backup should be available for the high-risk cardiac obstetric caesarean section.

#### **Benefits of regional technique**

- Mother is awake
- Lower risk of aspiration
- Avoid general anaesthetic side effects
- Good pain relief.

#### **Commonly accepted exceptions to the use of regional technique**

- Severe left-sided obstruction (aortic or mitral stenosis)
- Severe cardiomyopathy
- Spinal/combined spinal epidural contraindicated by an absolute contraindication such as dual antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation.

### **Benefits of general anaesthesia**

- Avoid side effects of regional anaesthesia, i.e. vasodilation
- Control of ventilation
- Easier to escalate support and insert lines.
- TOE monitoring possible.

### **Risks of general anaesthesia**

- CVS depression and decompensation
- Raised intrathoracic pressure
- i PVR
- i uterine atony
- Neonatal depression
- Pulmonary aspiration.
