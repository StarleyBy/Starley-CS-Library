<div class="details-content">

Cardiac disease can complicate pregnancy and can result in admission to a critical care unit. The most recent CMACE report 2006–2008 reported 2.3 deaths per 100,000 maternities (Fig. 20.1).

Cardiac causes remain first in the list of causes of maternal death (Fig. 20.2). Increasingly women with severe cardiac disease are opting for pregnancy with the expectation of good maternal and neonatal outcomes. This presents huge challenges for obstetric services and good outcomes are dependent on cardiac obstetric networks including excellent cardiac critical care.

Pregnancy makes great demands on cardiac function (Fig. 20.3). Patients with limited cardiac reserve can decompensate during pregnancy, risking both maternal and fetal well-being. Complications can occur for up to several days after delivery. In the immediate aftermath of delivery there is an autotransfusion of placental blood which may precipitate cardiac volume overload.

**Figure 20.3** Physiological changes in pregnancy. Systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) fall during pregnancy. BP may fall in the 2nd trimester, rising slightly in late pregnancy. Note that cardiac output and stroke volume peak by 16 weeks of gestation.

<summary>The risk of maternal death</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Antenatal advice should be given to patients with significant cardiac disease. Exact prediction of maternal and fetal outcomes can be difficult with the progressive advances in medical care and the limited experience of pregnancy in rare cardiac diseases.

Mothers with complex cardiac disease should attend a joint clinic with a specialist cardiologist and the high-risk pregnancy obstetric team. The role of the clinic is to assess and advise the mother on the risk of pregnancy and to develop a plan to minimize these risks through close follow-up and medical intervention.

Patients at high risk of cardiac mortality should be delivered in a hospital which can provide specialist cardiac obstetric services (Table 20.1). After delivery, close supervision and treatment in a cardiac critical care unit is beneficial.

| Condition                     | Risk of death |
| ----------------------------- | ------------- |
| Normal healthy woman          | 1 in 20,000   |
| Average for the population    | 1 in 10,000   |
| Corrected Fallot’s or similar | 1 in 1,000    |
| Severe aortic stenosis        | 1 in 100      |
| Severe pulmonary hypertension | 1 in 3        |
| Eisenmenger’s complex         | 1 in 2        |

<summary>Independent predictors of cardiac risk are:</summary>
<div class="details-content">

* Cyanotic heart disease
* Pulmonary hypertension
* Poor functional status (New York Heart Association (NYHA) III or IV)
* Poor systemic ventricular function
* Severe left-sided obstruction

More patients with congenital heart disease are surviving to adulthood and are wishing to risk pregnancy. Eisenmenger’s syndrome is known to carry a major risk with published maternal mortality rates of 40–50%. These types of patients require preoperative counselling of the risks involved. Complex cardiac disease in pregnancy is a classic example of a clinical condition where careful planning and excellent teamwork between multiple disciplines is required. These include obstetricians, cardiologists, paediatricians, midwives, anaesthetists, and intensivists.

Obstetric patients with complex cardiac disease should be managed in specialist units with an experienced cardiac obstetric team and access to cardiac critical care facilities.

Medical interventions are sometimes indicated to improve maternal and neonatal outcome during pregnancy, such as mitral balloon valvuloplasty, coarctation repair, and treatment with anticoagulants or pulmonary vasodilators.

<summary><span style="font-size:110%">Anaesthetic techniques and the delivery</span></summary>
<div class="details-content">

The gestation and method of delivery will be determined by the high-risk obstetric team depending on fetal growth and well-being and the cardiac assessment of the mother. In complex cardiac disease, the mother and fetus are assessed serially. The cardiac demands increase as pregnancy progresses; however, this has to be balanced against the fetal risk of premature delivery and the growth and maturity of the baby.

In moderate-risk pregnancies a spontaneous delivery is preferred; however, in high-risk patients a caesarean section may be the delivery method of choice.

The anaesthetic technique will be decided by the responsible anaesthetist depending on a host of factors. Awake regional anaesthesia is the preferred option adopted by many centres.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Basic principles</summary>
<div class="details-content">

* Lateral tilt at all times to minimize caval compression from the gravid uterus
* Careful administration of Syntocinon® (5 units IV slowly) post delivery
* Very cautious fluid administration
* Vasopressor infusion for spinal anaesthesia. Phenylephrine is our preference
* Full cardiac backup should be available for the high-risk cardiac obstetric caesarean section. This should include the option of cardiac surgical intervention and/or mechanical support

<summary>Benefits of regional technique</summary>
<div class="details-content">

* Mother is awake
* Lower risk of aspiration
* Avoid general anaesthetic side effects
* Good pain relief

<summary>Commonly accepted exceptions to the use of regional technique</summary>
<div class="details-content">

* Severe left-sided obstruction (aortic or mitral stenosis)
* Severe cardiomyopathy
* Spinal/combined spinal epidural contraindicated by an absolute contraindication such as dual antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Benefits of general anaesthesia</summary>
<div class="details-content">

* Avoid side effects of regional anaesthesia, i.e. vasodilation
* Control of ventilation
* Easier to escalate support and insert lines
* TOE monitoring possible

<div class="details-content">

Careful planning of postoperative care is essential. While specialist cardiac intensive care may be lifesaving, all the facilities of an obstetric unit should be available in the peripartum period. This plan should include consideration of the following:

* Appropriate level of CVS monitoring:

  * Arterial pressure
  * Central venous pressure
  * Urinary output
  * Cardiac output
  * SvO<sub>2</sub>
  * PA pressures
  * Echo if required

* Analgesia:

  * Paracetamol
  * NSAIDs
  * Epidural or spinal opiates
  * Rescue oral opiate analgesia

* Bleeding complications:

  * Reduced uterine tone treated with routine Syntocinon® infusion
  * Ergometrine
  * Carboprost for uncontrolled postpartum haemorrhage (PPH)
  * Availability of the obstetric surgical team
  * Interventional radiology capacity for uncontrollable PPH
  * Hysterectomy may be required if all else fails

* Antibiotic prophylaxis according to local protocol

* VTE prophylaxis should be given

* Emotional support:

  * Separation from newborn baby is difficult for mother
  * Webcam can help view baby in neonatal ICU
  * Moral support throughout from partner

* Cardiac arrest in the pregnant patient:

  * Resuscitation should follow ERC guidelines
  * Emergency caesarean section within 5 minutes of cardiac arrest
  * Lateral tilt
  * Cricoid pressure for intubation as ↑ risk of aspiration
