# **Introduction**

Hypotension is a common occurrence in up to 75% of patients in the early postoperative period after cardiac surgery. As the BP is easy to measure it is used as a surrogate for impaired tissue perfusion. In fact the BP and the flow are equally important to regional perfusion.

There are no global accepted definitions for hypotension, however, for the purposes of this chapter we shall define hypotension as a fall in the systolic BP to <90mmHg or the MAP to <65mmHg.

An understanding of the relationship between BP and flow is essential. In many ways the MAP is a more important measure than the systolic pressure which is more influenced by damping and vascular impedance and is less directly linked to flow.

When assessing a critical care patient, the perfusion pressure should be calculated by subtracting CVP from the MAP. Patients with high CVPs require higher MAP to achieve an adequate perfusion pressure.

The perfusion pressure is directly proportional to the product of the cardiac index (CI) and the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and may be manipulated by influencing these indices by pharmacological or mechanical interventions.

Autoregulation across a vascular bed results in stable flow across a range of MAPs. In the cerebral circulation this is typically from a cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) of 50–50mmHg. The autoregulation curve may be shifted to the right in various diseased states such as long-standing hypertension or when autoregulation is impaired.

In the assessment of hypotensive patients in the postoperative period after cardiac surgery, it is important to know what the BP was before surgery as this acts as a baseline.

Also other indices of perfusion must be considered alongside the BP such as:

- Urine output
- Arterial H+
- Plasma lactate
- Mixed venous saturation.

Goals for MAP should be set on an individual patient basis taking into account preoperative factors such as a history of hypertension and baseline ventricular function.

# **Management of hypotension: general principles**

# **Diagnosis**

Hypotension is commonly a result of the following (see Table 7.):

- Preload reduction (hypovolaemia)
- Impaired cardiac function
- Reduced afterload (vasoplegia).

#### **Preload**

- Maintain preload
- Assess response to fluid challenge (see algorithm in Fig. 7.)
- Beware concealed blood loss.

Preload may be difficult to assess. The absolute CVP is a poor measure of preload and the dynamic response of the MAP, HR, CVP, and other indirect indices of perfusion to a fluid challenge may be better.

An i pulse pressure variation may indicate hypovolaemia and suggest volume responsiveness.

In patients who are unresponsive to fluid challenge, more information may be necessary to guide treatments.

A full assessment of the past medical history, ventricular function, conduct of the operation including any clinical difficulties in theatre, and clinical examination often raises suspicion of a possible likely cause.

A bedside echocardiogram can help differentiate between hypovolaemia, impaired cardiac function and vasoplegia. The insertion of a pulmonary artery flotation catheter (PAFC) will help differentiate between low CO syndrome and vasoplegia.

# **Reversible causes of hypotension**

# **Dysrhythmia**

Changes in heart rhythm can precipitate hypotension. The heart rate and rhythm is assessed and corrected if possible. When tachydysrhythmias are associated with profound hypotension and compromised perfusion, DC cardioversion should be considered. Bradycardias may be treated by pacing if epicardial pacing wires have been placed during surgery. Loss of atrioventricular (AV) synchrony may have a disproportionate effect in patients with impaired ventricular function and/or diastolic dysfunction and LV hypertrophy. DDD pacing may be beneficial.

### **Hypovolaemia and tamponade**

Excessive bleeding will cause hypotension and can be diagnosed by i surgical drainage (>200mL/hour).

Beware of concealed haemorrhage as this may occur particularly when the pleural spaces have been opened. A clinical examination and a CXR will identify a significant haemothorax.

Hypotension may be a result of cardiac tamponade which is a clinical diagnosis. The hallmarks of cardiac tamponade are:

- Hypotension
- Tachycardia
- Raised CVP
- Poor perfusion (delayed capillary filling and adverse trending of perfusion indices).

When in doubt an echocardiogram can confirm the diagnosis (see b Management of hypotension: general principles, p. 5).

# **Specific surgery-related causes of hypotension**

- Regional myocardial ischaemia
- Valve replacement or repair dysfunction
- LV outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction after replacement or repair.

An index of suspicion must be maintained for the recognition of reversible causes of hypotension which are specific to the cardiac surgical procedure.

Poor myocardial performance may be due to regional myocardial ischaemia. This may be suspected if there are ECG changes in the territory of a single coronary artery and/or matching new wall-motion abnormality on echocardiography. Suspected myocardial ischaemia may indicate a technical issue with a CABG and be an indication for reoperation or coronary angiography and PCI.

If, after valve repair or replacement, resistant hypotension is problematic this may indicate a failure of the operative procedure. Valvular annuloplasty rings can become dehisced and leaflets of mechanical valves may be stuck. These can be diagnosed by transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) and reoperation may be indicated.

After mitral valve repair or aortic valve replacement, LVOT obstruction may cause early hypotension. These should be excluded by echocardiography; however, generally an index of suspicion will be present from intraoperative echocardiographic findings and this should have been handed over to the cardiac intensive care staff on admission.

#### **Features of low cardiac output syndrome (CI <2.2L/min)**

- Low CO
- Cold peripheries
- Impaired capillary refilling
- Hypotension
- Raised H+ and lactate
- Low urine output
- Low mixed venous saturation (<60%).

#### *Treatment*

- Optimize HR/usually 80–90bpm
- Rhythm (aim for normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and AV synchrony)
- Optimize preload
- Address any reversible causes
- Pharmacological support: inotropes: catecholamines, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, calcium sensitization
- Optimize and normalize biochemical milieu (K+, Ca2+, H+)
- Improve oxygen carrying by correcting anaemia
- Mechanical support: IABP or VAD
- Reduced afterload.

# **Vasoplegic syndrome**

Vasoplegic syndrome occurs in 8.8% of cardiac surgical patients in the early postoperative period. It can be defined by the presence of the following five criteria:

- Hypotension MAP <50mmHg
- Low filling pressures: CVP <5mmHg; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) <0mmHg
- High or normal CI >2.5L/min/m2
- Low peripheral resistance, SVR <800dyne/sec/cm5
- A vasopressor requirement.

#### *At-risk groups*

- Transplants
- Poor ejection fraction (EF)% 
- Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.

# **Typically associated with:**

- CPB
- Long bypass runs
- Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)
- i use of constrictors on CPB.
