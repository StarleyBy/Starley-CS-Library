## **Introduction**

The success of paediatric cardiac services has resulted in a significant growth in the population of adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD):

- In Westernized societies the number of adults with congenital heart disease is now greater than the number of children.
- Survival to adulthood is now estimated to be 790%.
- The majority of adults with ACHD have a good quality of life with families to support and jobs to maintain.

The spectrum of anatomies comprising ACHD is wide, ranging from simple lesions such as patent ductus arteriosus to complex single ventricle morphologies. The anatomy, however, is only part of the condition. The more challenging aspect in the care of these patients is appreciation of the resultant physiology. A 'simple' patent ductus arteriosus may manifest in the adult as Eisenmenger syndrome with pulmonary hypertension.

### **Patients with ACHD may present to CICU in three circumstances:**

### *Postoperatively following cardiac intervention*

Very few congenital cardiac procedures are curative. Adults may require cardiac intervention (surgical or transcatheter) in several circumstances:

- Primary repair of anatomy
- Repair of sequelae of primary anatomical repair
- Intervention for unrelated problem, e.g. CABG
- Cardiac and/or pulmonary transplantation.

#### *Postoperatively following non-cardiac surgery*

Patients with complex ACHD benefit from perioperative CICU care for non-cardiac surgical procedures, including obstetric interventions. The specialist's appreciation of the physiological balance optimizes the ICU outcome.

#### *Management of medical emergency*

Medical emergencies may critically destabilize a patient with ACHD; for example, acute severe pneumonia in a single ventricular physiology. These patients also benefit from CICU care although the limited evidence base suggests that despite this specialist care the outcome for these patients is often poor.

The additional consideration for patients with ACHD is that their cardiac history may be only part of their condition. There are a wide range of syndromes that include cardiac defects. These syndromes need to be understood to fully appreciate a patient's needs. Some patients with ACHD have learning difficulties that significantly impacts communication.

### **Key point**

For all patients with ACHD contact their base clinical team (cardiology/ GP) to ensure that the CICU team have a full understanding of the anatomy, physiology, and comorbidities.

ACHD has many eponymous syndromes and operations. This confounds the understanding of specific lesions and interventions. Some of the more common terms are described in Table 9..

## **Predictors of ICU outcome in ACHD**

Lesion complexity in ACHD is described according to the Canadian Cardiovascular Society's Consensus Classification (see b Further reading, p. 98).

Increasing lesion complexity is associated with higher ICU morbidity and mortality:

In elective postoperative admissions to ICU morbidity increases with:

- Preoperative renal, liver, or thyroid dysfunction
- Haemodynamically significant residual lesions.

ICU admissions prompted by acute deterioration secondary to arrhythmias can be managed successfully with a good outcome.

In emergency medical admissions (except arrhythmias) ICU mortality is high (36%) and accurately predicted by the APACHE II score.

ACHD patients admitted to ICU with an acute medical problem should be managed using standard principles of care. However, advice is often sought from CICU specialists particularly with regard to ventilatory and haemodynamic support.

### **General considerations**

The key factor to CICU care for patients with ACHD is an appreciation of their anatomy, physiology, and function. This includes knowledge of their usual haemoglobin, oxygen saturation, and BP. Even this can reveal the complexities of care as identifying where to measure the 'true' BP can be challenging in a patient with previous shunts, or the correct oxygen saturation in an Eisenmenger patient with an unrepaired ductus arteriosus.

Complications of ACHD include RV dysfunction, arrhythmia, endocarditis, and pulmonary hypertension. These aspects are covered in detail in their relevant chapters. Chapter 20 also highlights the specific aspects of care of pregnancy in ACHD.

### *Arrhythmias*

Arrhythmias may be difficult to detect. Knowledge of the baseline ECG is helpful.

Any arrhythmia with haemodynamic compromise should be managed in the standard way, with prompt electrical cardioversion.

*Atrial tachyarrhythmias* are life-threatening to patients with single ventricular physiologies. If an atrial tachyarrhythmia is diagnosed then prompt action is required to manage the patient:

- *Electrical cardioversion* is treatment of choice.
- Amiodarone can potentially slow the rate of atrial conduction and risk : AV conduction with consequent haemodynamic collapse.

#### *Cyanosis*

Cyanosis is an important feature of unrepaired or some palliated ACHD syndromes. Hypoxaemia is caused by right-to-left shunts or mixing of pulmonary venous and systemic venous returns in a common chamber. A secondary erythrocytosis results with an elevated haematocrit and subsequent hyperviscosity.

- Preoperatively efforts should be made to optimize iron stores to ensure that the patient is iron-replete with optimal haemoglobin for their physiology.
- Venesection is very infrequently performed; essentially only if symptomatic hyperviscosity syndrome.
- Cyanotic patients are at risk of systemic emboli: new neurological findings should prompt urgent brain imaging for potential cerebral emboli.
- Chronic cyanosis has many sequelae including; haemostatic abnormalities, renal impairment, and development of aorto-pulmonary collateral arteries.
- Cyanotic patients often have a coagulopathy associated with thrombocytopenia consequent to their secondary erythrocytosis. There are also some reports of d levels of coagulation factors V, VII, VIII, and IX and reduced von Willebrand multimers.
- The patient may develop critically compromised oxygen delivery perioperatively due to hypovolaemia or relative anaemia. Transfusion may be required, not to a specific target haemoglobin, but rather to achieve adequate oxygen delivery.

Haemoptysis may be life threatening. If Eisenmenger physiology, remember that systemic and pulmonary pressures are similar; if hypertensive, avoid vasodilators, and treat with β-blockers ± sedation.

### *Haemoptysis*

Haemoptysis is a worrying symptom in ACHD. A small-volume bleed may be the herald of a life-threatening haemoptysis and so should be investigated thoroughly. The source of bleed may be related to bronchitis, PE, and in pulmonary hypertensive patients, pulmonary arterial rupture or rupture of an aorto-pulmonary collateral vessel. In patients with tracheostomy or prolonged ventilation a tracheo-arterial fistula may form. In patients with aortic aneurysm including coarctation repairs and Marfan syndrome there may be erosion into the airway (or oesophagus).

Prompt investigation includes CXR, bronchoscopy, CT angiography, and invasive catheterization with the potential of embolizing the bleeding vessel.

If major bleeding, consider selective intubation of non-bleeding bronchus or bronchial blocker.

#### *Heart failure*

Patients with ACHD may develop heart failure. This should be managed according to standard management strategies although there is less evidence of benefit, particularly in systemic right ventricles.

The evidence for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in ACHD is minimal but it can be considered in specific cases, and may be appropriate in the CICU setting where a patient may have become pacing dependent postoperatively and subsequently develops systemic ventricular failure. Access to achieve CRT may be challenging and may require an epicardial lead to be positioned.

### 198 Chapter 9 **Patient with congenital heart disease**

Advanced heart failure strategies may be required, including mechanical circulatory support and transplantation. In the postoperative period ACHD patients may require ECMO support or a VAD. VAD technology has been a significant advance in the postoperative management of right ventricular dysfunction in the ACHD population. Cardiac transplantation in ACHD patients is appropriate for consideration, but requires significant technical consideration and planning.

### **General principles in care of patients with ACHD**

- The aim of care is to achieve adequate end-organ oxygen delivery.
- Oxygen therapy is not harmful to patients with ACHD. Therefore oxygen can be used as in general patients. However, oxygen saturations should be monitored with consideration of the patient's usual saturation.
- Meticulous care of IV access should be maintained to avoid bubbles. Air bubbles may enter the systemic circulation. Similarly, cerebral abscesses may form due to paradoxical emboli into the systemic circulation. New neurological signs should be investigated with advanced brain imaging.
- Invasive monitoring requires consideration. Arterial access should be sited to avoid pressure damping from previous shunts or coarctation repairs. Central venous lines should avoid cavopulmonary connections as these connect directly with the pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary artery flotation catheters are fraught with problems in the ACHD patient and often cause more problems than they solve: in general they should be avoided.

## **Lesion-specific considerations**

### **Tetralogy of Fallot**

The most common cause of planned ICU admission in adults with Tetralogy of Fallot is re-do surgery for pulmonary valve replacement. In planning these patients monitoring in ICU attention should be paid to previous surgeries:

- If a patient has had previous Blalock–Taussig shunts then they are likely to have a falsely low arterial BP in the arm on the same side as the thoracotomy scar.
- Many patients will recover promptly from their surgery, however there is potential for ICU complications.
- *RV dysfunction* frequently causes morbidity and this should be promptly managed using the strategies described in b Management of the failing RV, pp. 88: optimization of ventilation, ensure heart rate and rhythm are optimal, preload optimization, modification of afterload including early use of nitric oxide, and consideration of advanced mechanical support.
- The role of inter-ventricular dependence in *LV dysfunction* is unclear, but additional factors in LV dysfunction include coronary artery disease. LV dysfunction should be managed with standard heart failure strategies.
- *Arrhythmias* are potentially problematic and need prompt attention. Sustained ventricular arrhythmias may require electrical cardioversion. Optimization of electrolytes and consideration of anti-arrhythmic agents including amiodarone may be required in the acute setting, and a proportion of the tetralogy patients require implantable defibrillators pre-discharge.

Surgery in adults with previous Mustard or Senning repair may be for obstructed or leaking baffles. They are likely to have postoperative renal and hepatic dysfunction secondary to chronic venous congestion that may be slow to resolve.

• *Systemic RV dysfunction* is often challenging to manage. Standard heart failure strategies should be instigated although the response is not predictable.

### **Transposition of the great arteries—switch repair**

Operative indications in patients with previous arterial switch include repair of the pulmonary, aortic, or coronary artery anastomoses, or valve repair or replacement of the aortic or pulmonary valves.

• The major concern in these patients is systemic left ventricular failure often due to coronary ischaemia.

### **Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries**

There are two frequent presentations of adults with CCTGA: bradyarrhythmia requiring pacemaker, and systemic atrioventricular (tricuspid) valve regurgitation. Tricuspid valve regurgitation may be a manifestation of systemic RV failure, and this may be challenging to manage in the postoperative period. These patients may require support from a VAD.

### **Fontan and TCPC circulations**

The Fontan circulation is a univentricular physiology which depends on passive pulmonary blood flow. IPPV will drop the cardiac output compared with spontaneous breathing, by preventing the negative intrathoracic pressure generated during inspiration which increases pulmonary blood flow. Cardiac output in the Fontan physiology requires an adequate preload and avoidance of elevated pulmonary vascular resistance.

- Avoidance of IPPV is preferred, however IPPV can be tolerated if the change in cardiac output is anticipated and managed. The lowest airway pressures should be utilized with minimal PEEP. Early extubation is advocated but not at the risk of airway compromise.
- Fontan physiology is associated with systemic venous hypertension with chronic changes in renal, liver, and haematological function all of which are challenging in the postoperative setting.

In the CICU setting Fontan patients require careful management. In addition to the systemic problems already described, potential cardiovascular problems include:

- *Systemic ventricular dysfunction*: manage with standard strategies. Preliminary evidence suggests that calcium sensitizers such as levosimendan may be beneficial. Maximizing cardiac output may require aggressive management of pleural effusions and ascites (which may splint diaphragmatic function), optimization of ventilator parameters in combination with bronchodilatation and reduction of pulmonary vascular resistance with pulmonary vasodilators (potentially in combination for maximal effect).
- *Arrhythmias*: Fontan heart rate is usually between 40–90bpm. Atrial arrhythmias may be difficult to discern from usual rhythm. Atrial ECG may be possible postoperatively. Arrhythmias are poorly tolerated and prompt electrical cardioversion should be considered.

### **Conclusion**

- The management of ACHD patients in CICU is complex and challenging, but highly rewarding in terms of the impact on a young population.
- Information about the past history and contemporary investigations is key to appreciating the current anatomy and physiology.
- Support and advice should be sought from ACHD specialists cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, anaesthetists, and intensivists.
