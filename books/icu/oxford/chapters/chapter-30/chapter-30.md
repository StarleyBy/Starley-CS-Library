## **Sternal wounds**

## **Management of the uncomplicated sternal wound**

- Minimize hypothermia, pain, hypovolaemia, and vasoconstriction.
- Optimize haemodynamics.
- Leave the original dressing undisturbed for first 24 hours to allow adequate time for skin edges to seal. Expose non-draining incisions after 24–48 hours to promote wound healing.
- Practice meticulous hand washing and aseptic wound.
- Splint the entire rib cage while suctioning or coughing to minimize wound stress.

### **Sternal wound complications**

- *Mediastinal dehiscence:* median sternotomy wound breakdown in the absence of clinical or microbiological evidence of infection.
- *Mediastinal wound infection:* clinical or microbiological evidence of infected presternal tissue and sternal osteomyelitis, with or without mediastinal sepsis and with or without unstable sternum. Subtypes include:
  - • *Superficial wound infection:* wound infection confined to the subcutaneous tissue.
  - • *Deep wound infection or mediastinitis:* wound infection associated with sternal osteomyelitis with or without infected retrosternal space.

Deep sternal wound infections or mediastinitis can be further subclassified depending on the presence of risk factors, latency of presentation, and response to treatment.

## **Presentation and diagnosis**

Infection may present within 4–5 days of surgery but more commonly patients are readmitted from home or from ward to critical care with discharging sternotomy wound. They may be systemically unwell with signs of sepsis:

- Wound erythema, induration, and warmth
- Excessive pain and tenderness
- Discharge: from sterile colourless fluid to frank, culture positive pus
- Sternal instability in addition to previous points may indicate deep infection
- Tachycardia, fever, shivering, lethargy.

Sternal wound infection may start as a localized area of sternal osteomyelitis, with minimal visible signs followed by sternal separation.

## **Practice point**

Check for sternal instability by gentle bi-manual palpation. Warn the patient that this may be painful.

#### *Investigations*

- *Wound swabs or pus:* microscopy, culture, and sensitivity.
- *White cell count, C-reactive protein* (neutrophilia).
- *CXR:*
  - • Widened mediastinum or enlarged cardiac silhouette
  - • Uni- or bilateral pleural effusion
  - • Pulmonary infiltrates.
- *CT scan:* best available non-invasive evaluation. May show cut-through wires, separated sternal halves, substernal or retro cardiac collection, or in late cases mediastinal collection with air fluid levels.

### *Common pathogens*

- *Staphylococcus aureus*: most common
- Coagulase-negative *Staphylococcus*: increasing
- Mixed infections
- Gram-negative pathogens
- Fungi.

## Mediastinitis can be diagnosed if at least one of the following is present:

- An organism isolated from culture of mediastinal tissue or fluid.
- Evidence of mediastinitis seen during operation.
- One of the following conditions: chest pain, sternal instability, or fever (>38.8°C), in combination with either purulent discharge from the mediastinum or an organism isolated from blood culture or culture of mediastinal drainage.

#### **Prevention**

- Perioperative mupirocin ointment in patients with nasal colonization of *Staphylococcus aureus*.
- Optimum timing of prophylactic antibiotics.
- Meticulous attention to skin preparation and operative technique. Short cardiopulmonary bypass and operation time.
- Control of plasma glucose (4–0mmol/L).

### **Management**

### *Superficial wound infection*

- • Incision and effective drainage if there is localization and 'pointing'.
- Thorough inspection and debridement of involved soft tissue. Remove exposed sternal wires if possible (may be necessary to leave *in situ* until sternal integrity is re-established).
- Culture-directed antimicrobial therapy.
- Appropriate dressings (local protocols).
- Vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) device may be useful in more extensive forms of superficial wound infection.

#### *Deep wound infection*

- Establish and treat the causative pathogens.
- Mainstay of treatment is surgical revision, including thorough debridement and preparation of the wound for reconstruction. Options include:
  - • In the absence of gross infection, primary closure after thorough debridement and sternal fixation (may involve simple plastic surgical techniques such as pectoral advancement flaps).
  - • In the presence of gross infection, secondary closure after a period of conventional wound drainage.
  - • Treatment with vacuum (VAC) dressing system (both for clean or infected wounds). VAC therapy can be used as a definitive treatment allowing the wound to granulate and heal, or as a prelude to secondary closure.
  - • Secondary closure may require plastic surgical techniques.
- General measures:
  - • Cover open sternal wounds with sterile dressing to protect from respiratory secretions and drainage contamination. Elevate the head of the bed and cover the chest with waterproof drape when suctioning.
  - • Monitor wounds on regular basis. Clear documentation is important: description of wound edges, slough, granulation tissue, and discharge.
  - • Monitor closely for cardiovascular and respiratory complications. Sternal instability and pain can reduce respiratory volumes by 50%.
  - • Maintain airway clearance (coughing and deep breathing, incentive spirometry, ambulation, repositioning, and postural drainage).
  - • Multidisciplinary approach: dieticians, pharmacist, and physiotherapist. Monitor weight, intake of calories, and essential nutrients.
  - • Person-centred care (may be a long haul): reassuring manner, eye contact, touch and reality orientation, involvement of family and significant others, adequate sleep, distraction, and relaxation (TV, music).
  - • Control of plasma glucose (4–0mmol/L).

## *VAC dressing*

- Open drainage with continuous removal of exudate with simultaneous stabilization of the chest and isolation of the wound.
- Maintains a moist environment and stimulates granulation-tissue formation in combination with an i blood flow in the adjacent tissue.
- • Approximates the wound edges and provides a mass filling effect with a low degree of surgical trauma, without establishing a new wound (e.g. abdominal wound in omental flaps).
- Due to sternal stabilization and wound isolation, patients can be mobilized and receive physiotherapy early.

## **Saphenous vein site**

## **Management of uncomplicated leg wounds**

- After skin closure, dress wound and firmly apply crepe bandage.
- Apply compression stockings for DVT prophylaxis.
- Leave wound intact for first 48 hours unless there is excessive soakage. Redress using sterile dressing till 5th postoperative day after which leave open.
- Early ambulation and physiotherapy.
- Caution in patients with peripheral vascular disease in the application of tight bandages. A regular check of the peripheral pulses must be incorporated into routine postoperative observations.
- NICE guidelines report a significantly lower rate of wound infection following endoscopic vs open vein harvest.

## **Leg wound complications**

#### *Minor*

- Erythema, induration, and cellulitis
- Dermatitis
- Greater saphenous nerve paraesthesia
- Persistent leg swelling
- Seroma and lymphocoele.

#### *Major (requiring surgical intervention)*

- Infection
- Non-healing wound
- Wound necrosis
- Limb ischaemia.

Leg wound infections are usually seen after 3–4 days postoperatively and thus may not be seen commonly in intensive care. Many patients are re-admitted after their primary discharge from hospital and the majority can be managed on ward basis with regular debridement and dressing.

Occasionally patients may present to intensive care after surgical intervention for severe, deep rooted, neglected, or aggressive infections, ± vascular procedures directed at underlying peripheral vascular disease. These patients are likely to be in catabolic status due to prolonged effects of infection, possibly with superadded acute sepsis.

## **Radial artery harvest site**

#### **Radial artery wound complications**

- Limb ischaemia
- Compartment syndrome
- Infection
- Dysaesthesia.

#### *Ischaemia*

With attention to preoperative selection and operative technique, hand ischaemia is a very rare complication of radial artery harvest. Recently, some reports have suggested presence of 'mild hand ischaemia' in around 0% patients which is manifested by exercise intolerance and is thought to arise due to poor ulnar artery flow reserve.

At transfer of patient from theatre, presence of radial artery wound should be noted and capillary refill in fingers should be checked and documented.

In ICU distal ulnar pulse, skin colour, and capillary refill should be checked at regular intervals. If there is any doubt bandaging should be loosened and close observation continued.

*Early vascular intervention* is paramount if limb salvage is to be successful in true limb ischaemia.

#### *Acute compartment syndrome*

This is rare as muscle fascia is usually deliberately left unclosed after radial artery harvest. It is important not to miss the diagnosis as early treatment is paramount. Treatment is by opening the wound and fasciotomy.

#### *Diagnosis of compartment syndrome after radial artery harvest*

- High index of suspicion.
- Key early sign is disproportionate pain, especially on movement or stretching.
- Classical signs of pallor, pulselessness, and paralysis are late manifestations.
- In the early phase pulse may be palpable because the systolic pressure is >30mmHg intracompartmental pressure typically associated with the syndrome
- Measurement of the intracompartment pressure especially in patients who are ventilated or obtunded.

#### *Dysaesthesia*

Incidence of neurological complications following radial artery harvest has usually been reported to be 5–0% and consists of d thumb strength and dorsal or palmer sensation abnormalities. Most symptoms resolve in the first year after the surgery.

## **Thoracotomy wounds**

## **Thoracotomy wound complications**

- Haematoma and bleeding
- Disruption
- Infection
- Pain (see b Sedation and pain relief, p. 33).

#### *Haematoma and bleeding*

Most haematomas are self-limiting and can be managed conservatively. Occasionally, they may be associated with bleeding from wound margins which may not stop despite compression. This may need an additional suture or two, or, in extreme cases, the wound may need to be locally explored to evacuate the haematoma.

#### *Disruption*

This varies from a localized area of wound opening to extensive wound disruption involving all the layers of wound. Disruption may or may not be associated with infection.

- Superficial localized area of wound disruption. Swab to rule out infection and leave open to granulate. A clean, non-contaminated, immediately postoperative wound can be closed, but monitor for later development of infection.
- More complete disruptions will require more formal surgical revision. Very rarely, complete disruption of deeper layers of wounds with intact superficial layers can present with surgical emphysema and palpable bulge on coughing.

#### *Infection*

Thoracotomy wounds are significantly more painful compared with median sternotomy wounds but infection is less common.

Infection can enter from external sources or from infected pleural space. Usually associated with partial or complete wound disruption. Beware development of 'pus pockets' connected to the main wound by narrow channels. Management follows general principles of debridement followed by granulation or secondary closure, possibly over a drain. For wound infection associated with empyema, 'open tube thoracostomy' can be employed through a separate chest drain to drain the pleural collection. The tube is gradually withdrawn as the empyema pocket shrinks. Development of bronchopleural fistula is a serious complication.
