# **Myocardial ischaemia and infarction**

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Introduction</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Myocardial ischaemia is an important cause of myocardial dysfunction in cardiac surgical patients in the postoperative period.

It is essential that the signs of myocardial ischaemia are recognized and treated early before a vicious deteriorating spiral culminating in MI occurs. The possible causes of myocardial ischaemia are:

- An imbalance of supply/demand balance resulting in subendocardial ischaemia
- Spasm of coronary artery or arterial conduit
- Thrombosis and/or occlusion of coronary graft or native coronary artery
- Mechanical issues such as kinking of a coronary artery graft related to CABG surgery.

<summary>How to diagnose myocardial ischaemia</summary>
<div class="details-content">

In the CICU, clinical situations to consider myocardial ischaemia include:

- Unanticipated myocardial failure
- ST changes in pattern consistent with a distribution of coronary artery of graft
- ST elevation or depression which is episodic which may suggest coronary spasm
- Echocardiogram may show a new wall-motion abnormality
- Angina type pain may be present in the awake patient.

The right coronary artery (RCA) supplies the inferior and inferoseptal walls of the LV and much of the RV (Fig. 5.1). Electrocardiogram (ECG) changes will be seen in the inferior standard leads II, III, and aVF.

The left anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery supplies the anterior and anteroseptal walls. ECG changes will be seen in standard lead and anterior chest leads V1–3.

The circumflex artery branch of the left coronary artery supplies the lateral and posterior wall of the LV. ECG changes will be seen in standard lead 1 and lateral ventricular lead aVL.

In 85% of patients the RCA is said to be 'dominant' because it supplies circulation to the inferior portion of the interventricular septum via the right posterior descending coronary artery (or PDA) branch.

Non-specific ST and T wave changes are common after cardiac surgery and may be due to pericardial reaction which makes recognition of myocardial ischaemic difficult. Intraventricular conduction defects may compound these difficulties.

<summary>ECG definitions of myocardial ischaemia</summary>
<div class="details-content">

In the absence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and left bundle branch block (LBBB):

#### *ST elevation*

ST elevation from J point in two contiguous leads with the cut off points: ≥0.2mV in men and 0.15mV in women in leads V2–3 and/or ≥0.15mV in any other leads.

#### *ST depression and T wave changes*

New horizontal or downsloping depression ≥0.05Mv in two contiguous leads; and/or T wave inversion in ≥0.1mV in two contiguous leads with prominent R wave or R/S >1.


<h5>Contiguous leads mean lead groups such as</h5>


- Anterior leads V1–6
- Inferior leads II, III, aVF
- Lateral/apical leads I and aVL.

<summary>Determinants of myocardial oxygen supply</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Anaemia (Hb <8.0g/dL) may predispose to myocardial ischaemia.
- Tachycardia: myocardial oxygen supply is determined by diastolic filling time.

- Hypotension: the diastolic BP and end-diastolic pressure gradient. The perfusion of the LV occurs in diastole while the RV can be perfused in both systole and diastole.
- Increased demand due to the use of inotropes such as adrenalin and dobutamine.

Myocardial oxygen demand is determined by heart rate (HR) and systolic BP which can be quantified as the rate pressure product. Therefore hypertension and tachycardias should be avoided. Myocardial ischaemia results from an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand.

<summary>Echocardiographic findings in myocardial ischaemia or infarction</summary>
<div class="details-content">

A new regional wall-motion abnormality may indicate myocardial ischaemia or infarction. This may reflect the distribution of a particular coronary artery or be more global in character. There may also be global LV or RV systolic and/or diastolic dysfunction. In some cases, new mitral regurgitation or ventricular septal defect (VSD) may be identified.

Myocardial ischaemia can be induced even in the presence of normal coronary arteries.

<summary>The diagnosis of myocardial infarction</summary>
<div class="details-content">

The diagnosis of MI is difficult after cardiac surgery. Elevation of cardiac biomarkers such as troponin occurs to various degrees after cardiac surgery due to myocardial cell necrosis. This may occur as a result of:

- Surgical trauma
- Cardiac handling
- Coronary dissection
- Global or regional ischaemia due to inadequate myocardial protection and reperfusion injury
- Damage from oxygen free radicals
- Inadequate revascularization.

However, major elevations of biomarkers are associated with worsened prognosis.

The European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/American Heart Association (AHA) consensus guidelines redefined the types of MI in 2007.

<summary>Type 5 myocardial infarction (post cardiac surgery)</summary>
<div class="details-content">

In CABG with normal baseline troponin values, elevation of cardiac bio-markers above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL) is indicative of perioperative myocardial necrosis. By convention:

- Increases in biomarkers >5 × 99th percentile during the first 72 hours after CABG:
  - • plus either new pathological Q waves or new LBBB
  - • or angiographically new graft occlusion or native coronary occlusion
  - • or imaging evidence of new loss of myocardium have been designated as defining CABG-related MI.
- Elevated biomarkers levels are associated with a worse prognosis.

<summary>Management: general principles</summary>
<div class="details-content">

### **Initial interventions are targeted at reducing ischaemia**

- Control tachycardia HR <100bpm.
- Normalize BP: MAP 70–100mmHg.
- Reduce end-diastolic pressures with vasodilators such as glyceryl trinitrate (GTN).
- If hypertensive reduce inotropes.
- Correct hypotension.
- This may be due to hypovolaemia or ischaemia-induced myocardial dysfunction or vasodilation.
- Beware: inotropes may increase myocardial oxygen demand.
- Administer aspirin if bleeding is controlled.

#### *If simple measures are ineffective:* 

- Consider the insertion of an IABP early as it is beneficial to the supply/ demand balance and may allow weaning of inotropes.
- Consider surgical intervention with re-exploration if malfunctioning graft is suspected.
- Emergency coronary angiography with possible percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

If the diagnosis of MI is established in the postoperative period, therapy is similar to the management of patients in a non-cardiac setting with the exception that thrombolysis is contraindicated in the postoperative period due to the risks of bleeding.

MI can be complicated with:

- Arrhythmias
- Cardiogenic shock
- Organ dysfunction
- VSD
- Papillary muscle rupture and severe mitral regurgitation (MR).

Supportive therapy is targeted on the following aims:

- Re-establish coronary perfusion if possible
- Maintain systemic perfusion
- Avoid organ dysfunction
- Treat arrhythmias
- Identify and treat any complications
- Secondary prevention with aspirin and statins.

Cardiogenic shock may require treatment with:

- IABP
- Inotropes
- Vasodilators such as milrinone
- Ventricular assist device (VAD).
                                  
#### *Key point*
In myocardial ischaemia, every effort should be made to identify remedi- able causes early as technical issues with coronary grafts may be amenable to intervention by reoperation or PCI.
