# **Central venous cannulation**

# **Indications**

- Measurement of central venous pressure (CVP)
- If peripheral venous access is difficult to establish
- Administration of drugs which cannot be given peripherally. Administration of TPN and other hypertonic solutions
- Siting of PAFC
- Transvenous cardiac pacing
- Renal replacement therapy.

# **Preventing complications**

5% of patients with central venous catheters have a complication.

- Use standard Seldinger wire technique.
- Ultrasound technique reduces risk of arterial puncture and pneumothorax. Particularly useful in internal jugular vein (IJV) cannulation.
- Choose multilumen catheters to avoid multiple cannulations.
- Get experienced help if more than 3 cannulation attempts: (risk i× 6).
- Prevent air embolism: occlude lumina during insertion, use head-down position (may not be tolerated with poor cardiac function).
- Arterial puncture? Check pressure trace or compare blood sample to ABG.
- Arrhythmias: check ECG whilst advancing Seldinger wire or catheter.
- Perforation: usually delayed complication due to erosion of vessel wall. Risk of damaging veins (stiff PAC introducer) and endocardium (PAC).
- Central venous thrombosis: i risk in IJV, femoral vein, and large catheters.
- Pneumothorax: i risk with hyperinflation (large TV, PEEP, chronic obstructive airways disease). If suspected do not attempt contralateral IJV/subclavian vein (SCV) cannulation.

#### *Preventing infection*

- Risk of bloodstream infection is 3–8%.
- Mechanism of catheter infection:
  - • <5 days: tip colonization with skin organisms via ext. tract.
    - • >5 days: contamination of catheter, organisms via int. lumen.
- Maximal precautions: hat, mask, gown, gloves, large sterile drapes. Skin antisepsis with chlorhexidine is significantly superior.
- Use Teflon or polyurethane catheters.
- Antimicrobial catheters d infection risk but may i antibiotic resistance. Consider if infection rate is high despite preventative measures. Antibiotic ointments at catheter site i resistance and fungal infections.
- Give lipids (TPN, propofol) via dedicated lumina.
- Changing of CVC over guidewires i infection risk.
- Scheduled replacement of CVC does not reduce infection risk.
- Remove CVC as soon as not required.

# **Central vein routes**

In cardiothoracic patients IJV, SCV, and femoral veins are commonly used.

#### *Internal jugular cannulation*

- Easily accessible and high success rate.
- Low complication rate with landmark technique, best with ultrasound.
- Safer than SCV approach in deranged coagulation. External pressure on punctured carotid artery possible.
- Right IJV preferred because of straight access into SVC. Low left-sided approach carries risk of thoracic duct damage (chylothorax).
- May be less comfortable for awake patients than subclavian route.
- Awake patient: insertion with LA infiltration or superficial cervical plexus block.
- Head-down tilt to increase venous filling and prevent air embolus.
- Venous thrombosis risk approximately 4× that of the SCV.
- High approach in neck reduces risk of pneumo/haemothorax.

# *Subclavian vein cannulation*

- More comfortable for patient
- Least risk of infection
- • Ultrasound less useful as vein is more difficult to visualize
- Risk i of pneumothorax; arterial puncture—compression difficult.

# *Femoral vein cannulation*

- Arterial puncture: easily compressible
- No risk of pneumothorax
- Indicated in SVC obstruction
- • Difficult to mobilize patients
- i risk of infection in patients with BMI >28
- i risk of thrombosis (up to 2%).

# **Central line tip position**

- To avoid vessel wall erosion and pericardial tamponade catheter tip must lie outside the RA and parallel to the SVC just above the pericardial inflection (CXR: the carina is the landmark just above this).
- Innominate vein position: thrombosis risk with inotropes/irritant drugs.
- Right-sided catheters should be sited above the carina.
- Left-sided catheters may need to be positioned distal to the carina to avoid the tip abutting on SVC wall.
- CVC tip changes 2–3cm with respiration, arm, and torso position.
- If in doubt about the correct length, insert a longer catheter deep and withdraw after CXR.

# **Pulmonary artery catheter**

There is controversy on safety and clinical benefit of the PAC. It continues to be used in CICU as the only device that can assess intrathoracic pressures, CO, and SvO2 simultaneously. Standard PAC features: 0cm markings, proximal lumen for CVP and IV fluids, distal lumen for PAWP, balloon lumen and thermistor for CO measurement near the tip, and fibreoptic bundles for continuous SvO2 measurement. See Table 24..

# **Indication**

- Monitoring of SvO2 , cardiac pressures, CO, and derived data: trends more useful than single values
- Differentiation of causes of shock states
- Assessment of pulmonary hypertension
- Differentiation of high- versus low-pressure pulmonary oedema
- Aspiration of air emboli.

# **Contraindications**

- Tricuspid or pulmonary valve mechanical prosthesis or endocarditis
- Right heart mass (thrombus/tumour).

#### **Insertion**

- Insert PAFC introducer. Preferred routes: right IJV, left SCV (no acute angle to enter SVC); femoral veins can be difficult (in enlarged RV).
- Full-barrier asepsis for insertion. Check balloon, pre-fill other lumina. Inside sterile plastic sleeve catheter can be freely handled.
- Attach transducer to distal lumen. Observe pressure changes as catheter is advanced. Calibrate (usually automatic), reference (as for CVP) and zero prior measurements. Avoid dampening (bubbles) check with rapid flush test.
- Patient supine or head-up. Curved catheter tip may help positioning (RIJ: curve to L shoulder, in RV turn ¼ clockwise to ease tip into PA).
- In RA inflate the balloon gently (mL/sec) and 'float' from the RV into PA. Max. filling of balloon .5mL. As the balloon occludes a PA vessel the pressure trace changes (Fig. 24.). This is the PAWP.
- Deflate the balloon and ensure PA trace becomes visible again. If permanent wedging occurs, gently withdraw the catheter.
- In-between PAWP measurement, ensure balloon stays deflated to avoid PA damage and infarction. Monitor PAP trace continuously.
- CXR: tip position below level of left atrium (only 60% of catheters).
- Aim to remove catheter within 72 hours to reduce complications.

# **Difficulties floating the catheter**

- In RA or RV dilation, severe TR, very poor RV function:
  - • Optimize patient position: head up and slightly towards the right side puts pulmonary valve at the highest level. When the catheter is in the RV outflow tract (PVCs), pause ventilator in inspiration and advance catheter into PA.
- Consider fluoroscopy.

# **Complications**

- Mechanical and infective complications as with central venous access.
- • Arrhythmia: usually PVCs, short-lived VT. Significant VT/VF in <%. Transient right bundle branch block (BBB) in 5% (risk of 3rd-degree heart block with pre-existing left BBB).
- Infection (i risk after day 3).
- • Coiling/knotting: suspect if >20cm advanced into the RV without waveform changes. Withdraw slowly to avoid knotting. Get experienced help, consider fluoroscopy, interventional radiology.
- Damage to valves, myocardium.
- Rupture/damage to PA: rare (∼% but 50% fatal). Risk i: pulmonary hypertension, >60 years, anticoagulation. Signs: sudden haemoptysis after inflation of PAC balloon. Management: position bleeding side down, lung isolation with DLT, PEEP, embolization or lobectomy.
- • Pulmonary infarction: (<7%) Cause: migration of PAC or thrombi.
- • PAC not in zone 3; suspect if: mean PAWP >mean pulmonary artery diastolic pressure (PADP), PAP trace swings ++ with respiration.

#### Difficulties determining the PAC position

- Large v waves may make it difficult to differentiate PA trace and PCWP. Look for subtle waveform differences (loss of the PA dicrotic notch) or compare distal blood sample with and without balloon inflation (PAWP = SvO<sub>2</sub>, PAP = SaO<sub>2</sub>).
- Overwedging: wedge pressure trace rises excessively, no pulsatile trace, balloon volume less than half the maximum.

#### **Cardiac pressures**

- PAP: approx. 1/5 of systemic pressures.
- PAWP: pressure at the distal catheter tip as balloon occludes a PA branch. Reflects delayed pressure changes in the LA (similar to CVP trace). PAWP is an approximation of the true LV preload (LVEDV), indirectly represents myocardial fibre length (Starling law). Helpful when RA pressures (CVP) do not reflect LV function, e.g. in LV failure, severe BBB, pulmonary hypertension, cardiac tamponade, constrictive pericarditis, valvular disease. ~1—4mmHg less than PADP. Measure PAWP at end-expiration (IPPV: trough of trace, spont. breathing: peak of trace).

#### Cardiac output monitoring

Calculations based on Fick principle:

- Intermittent: 10mL cold fluid boluses into RA, blood temperature measured by thermistor at tip, use average from 3–4 measurements.
- Continuous CO (CCO): pseudo-random cycles from RA heat element every 40–60 seconds registered by thermistor. Temperature–time-curve is inversely proportional to CO. Changes may lag up to 12 minutes.
- Pitfalls: large left-to-right shunt: overestimation of CO, large right-to-left shunt: underestimation of CO, severe TR: may over or underestimate CO.

- Cardiac tamponade: † RA pressure on inspiration (Kussmaul sign), mean RA pressure = RVDP = PADP = PAWP.
- Cardiogenic pulmonary oedema: likely if PAWP >18–20mmHg (if colloid pressure and permeability normal).
- PAWP overestimates LVED pressure in mitral stenosis, PEEP ventilation, left atrial myoma, pulmonary hypertension.
- PAWP underestimates LVED pressure in non-compliant LV, LVED >25mmHg, aortic regurgitation.

# **Minimally invasive cardiac output monitoring**

Several alternatives to the PAC are being used to assess cardiac function:

### **Pulse contour analysis**

Area under the curve (AUC) of a central arterial pressure wave (PW) correlates with the stroke volume (SV) calculated from aortic compliance and pressures. These are estimated by mathematical modelling from peripheral arterial PW. Difficulties arise from the accuracy of determining the systolic part of arterial PW, estimating varying arterial compliance and quality of PW.

#### *Pulse contour analysis with calibration*

- Lithium indicator dilution (LiDCOplus):
- Calibration for SV: an arterial sensor measures the concentration of a lithium bolus. CO calculated from this. Recalibration ≤8 hours or in haemodynamic instability.
- Continuous mode: assumes changes in the arterial PW to reflect SV.
- Accuracy decreases with: AF, IABP, AV disease, quaternary muscle relaxants, severe hyponatraemia. The system should not be used in st trimester pregnancy, concurrent lithium therapy, body weight <40kg. Transpulmonary cold indicator dilution (PiCCO).
- Calibration for SV: cold saline injected into central vein. Temperature changes detected by a peripheral arterial sensor. Allows estimation of extra vascular lung water (EVLW). Needs frequent recalibration in haemodynamic instability.
- Continuous mode: analyses systolic AUC, shape of PW, aortic compliance and SVR calculated CO.
- Accuracy d in cardiac shunt, severe AV disease, and IABP.

### *Non-calibrated pulse contour analysis (Vigileo™)*

- No venous access or calibration required.
- Algorithm uses demographics, analysis of pulse pressure (∼ to SV), SD of 2000 data points of arterial PW to estimate arterial compliance and calculate SV and CO.
- Accuracy d with AR, severe peripheral arterial vasoconstriction. Not validated with concurrent use of IABP.

# **Thoracic bioimpedance measurement**

- Thoracic electrodes emit and sense a small alternating current and relate it to the ECG. Baseline impedance reflects total thoracic fluid volume. The change in impedance over the cardiac cycle generates a waveform similar to the aortic flow curve and allows calculation of SV, CO, and myocardial contractility.
- Accuracy may be affected by pulmonary oedema and changes in PVR. Validity in critically ill and cardiac patients is uncertain.

# **Oesophageal Doppler**

- Velocity of blood flow is proportional to frequency of reflected waves (Doppler shift). Probe is rotated for optimal velocity-time signals. Shape of waveform reflects peak velocity, LV preload, contractility, and afterload. Aortic cross-section area estimated from nomograms or measured by oesophageal probe. Calculation of SV and CO assumes flow through the ascending aorta stays constant.
- Accuracy d by hypovolaemia, regional anaesthesia. Good correlation with PAC for CO. Better reflection of preload (end-diastolic volume) than PAWP.
