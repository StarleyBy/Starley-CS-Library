## **Introduction**

Bedside echocardiography has developed into a valuable diagnostic and monitoring tool. Within the CICU it is used to assist the intensivist in making rapid diagnoses and initiating appropriate interventions.

## **Indications**

- Diagnosis of haemodynamic instability:
  - • Cardiac failure
  - • MI
  - • PE
  - • Pericardial effusions
  - • Cardiac tamponade
  - • Valvular problems
  - • Cardiac arrest
- Estimation of volume status
- • Monitoring the effects of interventions
- • LV assessment:
  - • Size
    - • Degree of filling
  - • Contractility
  - • Regional wall-motion abnormalities
- • RV assessment:
  - • Size
    - • Degree of filling
    - • Contractility
- • Evaluation of pyrexia of unknown origin
- Assessment of endocarditis
- • Assessment of failure to wean
- • Aid to placement of ECMO cannula/IABP.

## **Transthoracic or transoesophageal echocardiography?**

Echocardiographic images of the heart can be obtained through the chest wall (transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)) or from the oesophagus (transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE)). TTE is a safe, non-invasive technique that can be rapidly performed in awake and sedated patients. It is the preferred technique in the critical care environment. However, if a TTE examination provides unsatisfactory views, it may be necessary to perform a TOE examination of the heart. TOE, a semi-invasive technique, is preferable to TTE in a number of specific situations: a detailed interrogation of the mitral valve (including prosthetic valves), assessment of the left atrial appendage for clot formation, assessment of vegetations associated with endocarditis, and suspected aortic dissection.

#### *Use TTE for:*

- • Assessment of pericardial effusions
- • Optimal views of the left ventricular apex
- • Optimal views of the left atrium
- Assessment of volume status using the inferior vena cava and subhepatic veins
- • Optimal Doppler beam alignment in apical view for aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valves.

## *Use TOE for:*

- • Inadequate TTE views (e.g. obesity, chest wall abnormalities, emphysema, IPPV with high levels of positive end expiratory pressure)
- • Assessment of structures close to the oesophagus (e.g. left atrial appendage, mitral valve)
- Interrogation of prosthetic mitral valves
- Assessment of vegetations
- • Suspected aortic dissection.

## **Transthoracic echocardiography**

## **Understanding the image**

The heart is situated in the anterior mediastinum, with its long axis lying along a line from the right shoulder to the left nipple. When viewed from the front the most anterior structures are the right atrium and right ventricle and the most posterior structure is the left atrium. The ultrasound transducer produces a thin fan-shaped beam that slices through the heart. The slice or image that is achieved depends on the position of the probe on the chest. TTE uses various standard positions (or windows) on the chest in order to assess cardiac structure and function. The images are displayed on a screen with the top of the screen representing the position of the transducer—structures closer to the transducer are seen nearer the top of the screen.

## **Echocardiography windows**

There are three main echocardiography 'windows' in the chest and abdomen that allow ultrasound waves to be transmitted to and reflected from the heart. It is also possible to visualize the lungs (Fig. 32.).

#### *Subcostal window*

• Place the transducer parallel to the skin inferior to the right costal margin and direct the ultrasound beam upwards towards the heart.

#### *Apical window*

• Place the transducer over the apex of the heart and direct the ultrasound beam parallel to the long axis of the heart—aim towards the sternum.

#### *Parasternal window*

• Place the transducer adjacent to the left sternal margin in the 2nd–4th intercostal space.

#### *Pleural window*

• Place the transducer on the lateral thoracic wall.

## **Preparing the patient**

Optimizing the position of the patient will help improve the quality of the images you obtain. Subcostal images are best obtained with the patient lying flat on their back with a relaxed abdomen. For parasternal and apical images, tilting the patient to the left brings the heart closer to the chest wall and improves the images obtained. In addition, abduction of the patient's left arm increases the gap between the ribs and widens the echocardiographic window. The view obtained will change throughout the respiratory cycle. It may be possible to ask spontaneously breathing cooperative patients to hold their breath when the image is at its best. In ventilated patients it may be possible to manipulate the ventilator briefly to obtain the necessary images.

#### **Preparing yourself and the machine**

Space is often limited in the critical care bed area, but it is important to position the machine and screen so that you are comfortable whilst scanning. Don't forget to enter the patient's details into the machine and attach ECG leads from the machine to the patient. Identify the 'marker dot' on the probe (this allows the probe to be correctly orientated). Ensure that you have a supply of ultrasound gel and paper towels to clean up the gel at the end. Dim the lights if possible.

With your dominant hand, hold the probe between your thumb and first and second fingers. Ensure there is sufficient ultrasound gel and then apply gentle pressure through the probe to obtain an image. When scanning rest your wrist on the chest wall to prevent the probe from slipping. It is important to learn how small movements of your wrist and probe can alter the image. The probe can rotate, tilt, and slide in order to achieve the desired image. Always scanning from the same position maximizes the benefits of these 'learned movements'. Remember that the image quality may be improved by moving the position of the probe or the position of the patient.

#### **Echo modes**

A variety of ultrasound techniques are employed in order to fully assess the heart's structure and function. These include two-dimensional (2D), Motion or M-mode, and Doppler (continuous wave Doppler (CWD), pulsed wave Doppler (PWD), and colour flow mapping (CFM)).

#### *2D Echo*

- A succession of slices taken over a cross-section of tissue. When displayed sequentially on a screen it provides 'real-time' imaging of the heart (Fig. 32.2).
- Use to assess anatomy and movement of the ventricles and valves.

#### *Motion or M-mode*

- • Images of a single slice taken over time (Fig. 32.3). This allows highly accurate measurements of moving structures. The ultrasound beam should be perpendicular to the structure of interest. Computer software allows measurements to be made and stored.
- Use for measurement of cardiac dimensions and timing of events (e.g. diastolic collapse).

#### *Doppler Echo*

Uses the Doppler principle to detect the velocity of red blood cells moving towards and away from the transducer.

#### *Continuous wave Doppler*

- • Measures the maximum blood velocity detected along the length of the ultrasound beam. Cannot therefore localize the exact position of the flow disturbance.
- • The calculated velocity is displayed on a velocity/time graph with blood flow towards the transducer displayed above the baseline and flow away displayed below the baseline (Fig. 32.4).
- Can measure high velocities.
- Use to assess valvular stenosis, valvular regurgitation, and the velocity of flow across intracardiac shunts.

#### *Pulsed wave Doppler*

- • Measures the blood velocity in a specific sample volume (e.g. in the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT)). The position of the sample volume is selected by the operator.
- • The calculated velocity is displayed on a velocity/time graph with blood flow towards the transducer displayed above the baseline and flow away displayed below the baseline (Fig. 32.5).
- • Is only accurate below velocities of 2m/s.
- Use for stroke volume and cardiac output calculations.

#### *Colour flow mapping*

- • Measures blood velocity and direction at several points within a set area.
- • The CFM is superimposed on the 2D image. Blood velocities away from the transducer are coloured blue and velocities towards the transducer coloured red (BART: Blue Away Red Towards) (Fig. 32.6). Higher velocities are represented by lighter shades of red or blue. If velocities exceed the processing ability of CFM colour reversal (aliasing) will occur.
- Use for assessing regurgitation and shunts.

## **Abbreviated scanning protocols**

A full standard TTE examination involves a series of images and measurements and may take up to 20 minutes. An abbreviated echocardiography examination performed by non-cardiologists has been shown to be both feasible in the critical care environment and contribute significantly to patient management. Whilst cardiologists provide an invaluable service for

routine and comprehensive echocardiography, there is a need for a 24 hour a day service for critically ill, haemodynamically unstable patients. The ability to reassess the patient after an intervention is essential. There is therefore a need for an intensivist-led abbreviated echocardiography examination.

## *Focus-assessed transthoracic echocardiography (FATE)*

Within the general intensive care population, TTE performed by trained intensivists, has been shown to provide diagnostic images in 9% of spontaneously breathing and 84% of mechanically ventilated patients and directly change management in >50% of studies.

One abbreviated echocardiographic examination is the FATE protocol. It has been shown to provide one or more useful images of the heart, allowing clinical decision-making, in 97% of patients.

The FATE assessment incorporates the following five views:

- • Parasternal long-axis (LAX) view
- • Parasternal short-axis (SAX) view
- • Apical view
- • Subcostal view
- • Pleural view.

The aims of the FATE protocol are to:

- Exclude obvious pathology
- Assess contractility
- • Assess wall thickness and dimensions of the chambers
- • Visualize the pleura on both sides
- Relate the information to the clinical context.

The views incorporated into the FATE assessment will be discussed in detail over the following pages.

## **Investigating hypotension**

Unexplained hypotension in the CICU is usually secondary to hypovolaemia, vasodilatation, or cardiac failure. Bedside echocardiography can be used to help differentiate between these possible causes.

## *Hypovolaemia or vasodilatation?*

## *Hypovolaemia*

Hypovolaemia results in reduced left ventricular filling. The volume/area/ diameter (surrogates for left ventricular filling) of the left ventricle at end diastole and end systole will therefore be noticeably reduced. Starting from smaller than normal at end diastole, the left ventricle contracts until the papillary muscles are close to meeting—kissing papillary muscles.

#### *Vasodilatation*

Vasodilatation results in d peripheral vascular resistance and therefore i stroke volumes. End-diastolic left ventricular volume remains constant but end systolic volumes are reduced. Starting from normal size at end diastole, the left ventricle contracts until the papillary muscles are close to meeting.

- • Obtain short-axis images of the left ventricle (parasternal SAX view).
- • Measure the internal diameter (LVID)/trace the internal circumference of the left ventricle in end diastole (LVIDd) and end systole (LVIDs) (Figs 32.7, 32.8, 32.9, and 32.20).

#### *Cardiac failure*

Hypotension may be due to the:

- Left ventricle:
  - • Global dysfunction
  - • Regional dysfunction
  - • LV outflow obstruction (systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve)
- Right ventricle:
  - • Systolic dysfunction
  - • RV outflow tract obstruction (PE)
- Pericardium:
  - • Fluid (tamponade)
  - • Thickening (constrictive pericarditis).

Figure 32.20 Parasternal SAX view. End systole LVIDs = .46cm.

## **Assessment of the left ventricle**

- Eye ball test
- • Dimensions and fractional shortening/ejection fraction
- • Measurement of CO.

#### *Eyeball test*

Use the parasternal short axis mid papillary view to obtain an overall picture of the heart's function. Standardize the depth of the image to facilitate comparison and pattern recognition. See Fig. 32.2.

*Is the heart empty or full?*

- • Do the papillary muscles touch at end systole in the parasternal SAX view?
- • Assess the IVC in the subcostal view.
- • Assess RA size.

*Is the heart contracting well?*

• Does it appear to move in a smooth or jerky manner?

*Is there a regional wall-motion abnormality?*

- • Look at each segment in turn. Placing a finger in the centre of the image may help identify an abnormally contracting segment.
- • Segments may be normal, hypokinetic, akinetic, or move paradoxically (dyskinetic).

#### *Calculating fractional shortening and ejection fraction*

#### *M-mode*

Use M-mode through the base of the heart (tips of the mitral valve leaflets) in the parasternal LAX view (Figs 32.22 and 32.23). Measure the left ventricular size at end diastole (timed with the R wave on the ECG) and at end systole (timed with the T wave on the ECG). The inbuilt software on the machine will then estimate the fractional shortening and ejection fraction.

#### *Simpson's method*

Simpson's method divides the left ventricle into a series of discs providing a 3D estimation of LV volume (Fig. 32.24). Using the inbuilt software, estimation of end-diastolic and end-systolic LV volumes facilitates estimation of the LV ejection fraction. This method can be made more accurate by repeating the process in another plane (apical 2-chamber) and taking the average of the values obtained.

![](_page_18_Picture_2.jpeg)

Figure 32.24 Simpson's method for estimation of ejection fraction. Obtain an apical 4-chamber view. Ensure that the endocardial border of the LV is clearly defined and that the ventricle is not foreshortened (ensure the apex is identified: it is fixed and doesn't move towards the base during systole). Zoom in on the left ventricle and then record a loop. At end diastole (R wave on ECG), trace the endocardial border and note the calculated end diastolic volume (EDV). Scroll to end systole (T wave on ECG), trace the endocardial border and note the end systolic volume (ESV). The ejection fraction can then be calculated:

Ejection fraction(%) = 
$$\frac{EDV - ESV}{EDV} \times 100$$

## *Measuring cardiac output*

Consider the flow in the LVOT. The volume of blood flowing through the LVOT over a given time period is the product of the cross-sectional area of the LVOT and the VTI:

Stoke volume<sub>LVOT</sub> = cross-sectional area<sub>LVOT</sub> 
$$\times$$
 VTI<sub>LVOT</sub>

*Cross-sectional area of the LVOT*

- • Area of a circle = π × radius2 .
- • Measure the diameter of the LVOT in the parasternal LAX view (radius=½ diameter). Ensure this is accurate as the value (and therefore any error) is being squared.

*Velocity time integral of LVOT*

- • Apical 5-chamber view.
- Use PWD with the sample chamber situated in the LVOT.
- • On the resulting velocity–time graph, trace the outline of the velocity to calculate the VTI.

The volume through the LVOT can be used to calculate cardiac output:

$$cardiac output = volume_{LVOT} \times heart rate$$

See Fig. 32.25 and Table 32.2.

## **Assessment of the right ventricle**

- Eye ball test
- Dimensions and fractional area change
- Estimating pulmonary artery pressure.

See Table 32.3.

#### *Eyeball test*

In the apical 4-chamber view compare the right ventricle with the left ventricle.

- • The right ventricular area should be smaller than (usually 2/3) the area of the left ventricle and the cardiac apex formed solely by the left ventricle.
- • Equally sized ventricles suggest a moderately dilated right ventricle.
- • If the right is larger than the left and forms the cardiac apex, then the right ventricle is severely dilated.

## *Estimating pulmonary artery pressure*

- Use an apical 4-chamber or parasternal SAX view with a visible jet of tricuspid regurgitation.
- Align CWD through the tricuspid valve regurgitation.
- • Measure the peak velocity.
- The tricuspid pressure gradient is calculated from the peak velocity using a modified Bernoulli equation:

Pressure gradient = 4 peak velocity<sup>2</sup> ×

• The RV systolic pressure, which is equivalent to pulmonary artery systolic pressure in the absence of pulmonary stenosis, is equal to the sum of the tricuspid pressure gradient and right atrial pressure (CVP).

## **Transoesophageal echocardiography**

## **Introduction**

This section will provide an overview of the information that can be obtained using TOE in the setting of the CICU. The majority of any echocardiographic examination involves the interpretation of moving images. There are many examples of these available via the Internet which are recommended to the reader.

## **Risks and precautions**

TOE is described as an 'invasive, non-invasive' investigation since there is morbidity and indeed mortality described from its use. As such, safety is of extreme importance and the sonographer must review the patient's history to exclude any contraindication to TOE before undertaking the study. The practice guidelines for perioperative TOE recommend 'that TOE may be used for patients with oral, oesophageal or gastric disease, if the expected benefit outweighs the potential risk, provided the appropriate precautions are applied'. The precautions include considering other imaging techniques (e.g. TTE), asking for an upper GI opinion and perhaps endoscopy, using the smallest available probe, limiting the examination and avoiding unnecessary probe manipulation, and using the most experienced operator.

Prior to the examination consideration must be given to analgesia and sedation, and the monitoring of the patient's vital signs must be delegated to another individual, or the monitors positioned such that the sonographer has a clear view of them during the procedure. This is of particular importance since in the majority of cases TOE is being performed to determine the cause of postoperative haemodynamic instability.

#### **Specific indications for TOE in ICU.**

- • Mitral valve assessment
- Endocarditis
- • Embolism of unknown origin
- Unexplained hypoxemia
- Pulmonary thromboembolism
- Aortic dissection.

#### **The standard views**

The ASE/SCA practice guidelines suggest 20 standard views to be obtained during a comprehensive TOE exam. There is no generally accepted order in which these views are obtained. Fig. 32.30 shows the views which most commonly provide relevant information in the CICU, and the abnormalities which may be detected.

## **Mitral valve assessment**

The mitral valve is immediately close to the oesophagus and TOE provides excellent quality images for the assessment of the mitral valve. This may be essential for determination of the mitral valve morphology and diagnosis of mechanisms of mitral regurgitation. TOE is also invaluable for the assessment of the prosthetic mitral valve or mitral valve repair. The best views are shown in Figs 32.3, 32.32, and 32.33.

Figure 32.33 Mid oesophageal aortic valve long axis view (MO AV LAX). This view may reveal dynamic LVOT obstruction secondary to systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (SAM). This uncommon but extremely important cause of hypotension following cardiac surgery is characterized by the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve prolapsing into the LVOT and perhaps even coapting with the interventricular septum which is usually hypertrophied. There is often associated mitral regurgitation and the velocity of this regurgitant jet may reveal that the pressure inside the left ventricle during systole is higher than the systemic blood pressure.

## **Possible findings in endocarditis**

- • Vegetations on valves
- Aortic root abscess
- • Perforated or destroyed leaflets of any valve
- Dehisced mechanical valve
- • Mechanical or bioprosthetic valve dysfunction
- • Fistula between chambers.

## **Embolism of unknown origin**

TOE is superior to TTE in the examination of the left atrium and particularly the examination of the left atrial appendage which is a common source of arterial embolism. This is best seen in the MO 2-chamber view. Alternative embolic sources can be seen such as left-sided valve vegetations or intracardiac clot or tumour (LV or LA).

## **Unexplained hypoxaemia**

Shunt at the intra-atrial level may be revealed either as a result of a patent foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect. Bubble contrast test (injection of agitated saline into the central line) and CFM can help determine the position and direction of any septal defect (Fig. 32.35). This important test to can help to exclude a cardiac cause of hypoxia post cardiac surgery.

Clot compression of the atria may be revealed in this view. Withdrawal of the central line should be considered if examination reveals the tip to be within the right atrium.

## **Pulmonary thromboembolism**

Clot may be seen in the main pulmonary artery in massive pulmonary embolism. This is best seen in the MO ascending aorta SAX view (Fig. 32.36); however, the right main bronchus often partially obscures this view.

#### **Aortic dissection**

The assessment of aortic dissection is best done with TOE rather than TTE. Often the patient will have already had a contrast CT scan. A full assessment of the ascending arch and descending aorta should be performed. Classically an endothelial flap will be revealed in the ascending aorta in type dissection. In addition, aortic regurgitation and pericardial haemopericardium may be revealed. In case of dissection into a coronary artery, evidence of a wall-motion abnormality will be present.

In addition to the mid oesophageal aortic valve long-axis view (MO AV LAX) seen earlier (Fig. 32.33) the views in Figs 32.37, 32.38, and 32.39 may be useful.

![](_page_29_Picture_2.jpeg)

Figure 32.37 Mid oesophageal aortic valve short-axis view (MO AV SAX). The MO AV SAX view is a good starting point since the aortic valve is often easily identified by the Mercedes Benz sign when in the closed position. The left atrium lies closest to the probe and is displayed at the top of the screen. This view offers clear images of the left and right atria and the aortic valve. The RVOT is often less well seen since it is more distant from the transducer and any calcification in the aortic valve will cause ultrasound drop out. Compression of the left or right atria by blood clot which is often enough to lead to post cardiotomy tamponade may be seen in this view. The morphology of the aortic valve is seen.

## **Assessment of ventricular function with TOE**

#### *Left ventricle*

The transgastric mid SAX view is a useful view for the assessment of the LV function. Myocardium supplied by all three main coronary arteries are seen. The view is commonly referred to as the bouncing doughnut view (Fig. 32.39)!

## *Right ventricle*

Right ventricular systolic function and dimensions can be assessed in this view (Fig. 32.40). Dilatation of the right ventricle is often associated with tricuspid regurgitation and determination of the peak velocity of the regurgitant jet across the tricuspid valve will provide the right ventricular and therefore the pulmonary artery systolic pressure. (RV systolic pressure = 4 × V max2 + CVP.) Clot compression of the RV may be seen but it is important to remember that the classic signs of tamponade (associated with pericardial effusion) are often absent in the post cardiac surgery setting with 'regional tamponade' or localized clot collection a common finding.
