### **Routine care of the thoracic patient**

#### **Thoracic surgical patients are aimed at promoting rapid recovery and reducing complications**.

- Thoracotomy is a major operation and is one of the most painful.
- The nature of the surgery and the common comorbidities of this patient group such as respiratory disease result in an incidence of respiratory complications.
- Patients may be admitted to critical care for routine postoperative care in level 2 beds or for level 3 care as a result of a complication of surgery, whether immediately postoperatively such as bleeding or as a later complication such as respiratory failure.

#### **Analgesia**

Pain is the enemy of recovery and will prevent adequate coughing and deep breathing. After lung resection, the patient will generally have a regional technique *in situ* such as paravertebral blockade or thoracic epidural analgesia. This is usually part of a balanced analgesic technique with the administration of regular paracetamol and non-steroidal analgesics. Patient-controlled analgesia is often used to supplement analgesic efficacy of paravertebral block.

### **Oxygen therapy**

Oxygen therapy should be given to overcome the V/Q mismatch associated with thoracic surgery. Generally humidified oxygen is administered to avoid the drying effects on secretions of the pipeline gases. Oxygen should be prescribed to achieve a SpO $_2$  of 94–98% or 88–92% in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure. High oxygen concentrations may promote absorption atelectasis and lung injury and may also be dangerous in COPD patients with hypoxia-dependant respiratory drive.

#### **Thoracic airway obstruction**

Thoracic patients with life-threatening obstruction to their trachea and lower airways may be admitted to cardiothoracic ICU for emergency management. After initial stabilization, investigations and diagnosis lead to definitive treatment.

## 176 Chapter 8 **The thoracic patient**

### *Nutrition*

Nutritional deficiencies are common in thoracic patients as a consequence of chronic infection (empyema), cancer cachexia, and dysphagia (oesophageal disorders). Early feeding is encouraged and where appetite is poor and/or dysphagia prevents consumption of adequate calories enteral feeding should be established.

## **Postoperative respiratory failure**

Respiratory complications occur in 25% of patients after lung resection. Of these, the more severe will require admission to ICU and up to 5% may require positive pressure ventilation. The reasons for postoperative respiratory failure are multifold. Patients may have significant underlying respiratory disease and then may fail to tolerate the loss of lung function associated with the lung resection. Recovery from surgery is complicated by postoperative pain and its consequences, such as the restriction in coughing and deep breathing. Opiate analgesia may also suppress cough reflexes, and cause sedation and hypoventilation. These variables conspire to cause atelectasis and sputum retention which may develop into postoperative pneumonia. ALI after lung resection is a major contributing factor in many patients and may be underdiagnosed.

## **Aetiology of postoperative respiratory failure**

- Atelectasis
- ALI/ARDS
- Pneumonia
- Severe underlying respiratory disease
- Excessive resection
- PE
- Aspiration

## **Thoracic conditions which may result in respiratory failure**

- Blunt chest trauma and lung contusion
- Chest stabbing
- Bronchopleural fistula
- Empyema.

## **Principles of management**

When respiratory failure occurs after thoracic surgery, the causes are often multifactorial and treatment is both supportive and aimed at the underlying causes. Nosocomial respiratory infection may accompany atelectasis and ALI. Non-invasive ventilation reduces the requirement for intubation and intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) and improves outcomes in type 2 respiratory failure. The following interventions may be indicated:

- Non-invasive ventilation:
  - • Nasal CPAP
  - • BiPAP
  - • CPAP and pressure support
  - • Hood CPAP
- Minitracheostomy
- Intubation and IPPV
- Early tracheostomy
- Physiotherapy and mobilization
- Sputum culture and antibiotics:
  - • Hospital acquired vs community acquired
- Fluid restriction

## **Bronchopleural fistula**

A bronchopleural fistula (BPF) is a persistent communication between the bronchial tree and the pleural space. Patients with BPF present particular management challenges. The BPF results in an air leak from the lung and consequently there is acquired infection of the pleural space and empyema. Initial treatment often involves drainage of the pleural space which can be difficult as there is often loculation of the empyema. The chronic infection in the pleural space progressively results in debility and weight loss. Spillage of infected pleural fluid into the airway contaminates the good lung and results in recurrent chest infection.

## **Causes of BPF**

- Post-pneumonectomy stump dehiscence
- Carcinoma of lung
- Tuberculosis
- Traumatic

#### *Management*

In the event of a patient with BPF requiring intubation and ventilation, special consideration should be given to the risk of inadequate ventilation due to massive air leak and airway contamination. If the BPF is post pneumonectomy, lung isolation may be required and the placement of a double-lumen tube may be necessary. A rapid sequence induction with pre-oxygenation and accurate placement of a double-lumen tube with the help of a fibrescope is the technique of choice. Alternative ventilation strategies such as the use of jet ventilation or high-frequency oscillation may have a place when the air leak is persistent and severe. These techniques are not universally available.

The surgical management of the BPF will be guided by the thoracic surgical team.

## **Thoracic airway obstruction**

Thoracic patients with life-threatening obstruction to their trachea and lower airways may be admitted to cardiothoracic ICU for emergency management. After initial stabilization, investigations and diagnosis lead to definitive treatment.

## **Aetiology of airway obstruction**

- Foreign body
- Trauma (post intubation, burns, and other forms of trauma)
- Neoplasm of the trachea or major bronchus
- Mediastinal lymphoma
- Thymic tumours

Diagnostic investigations often include CT scan, rigid bronchoscopy, and mediastinoscopy with biopsy for histological diagnosis. Relief of airway obstruction may require initial intubation and treatment with steroids and/ or radiological placement of airway stents prior to definitive treatment with further surgery or chemotherapy/radiotherapy.

## **Lung volume reduction surgery**

Conventional lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) is a palliative operation in patients with severe emphysema. The surgical removal of emphysematous lung areas reduces the hyperexpanded lung volume and gives mechanical advantage. This may result in improvement in life expectancy and symptoms. Lesser forms of surgery such as simple bullectomy may also be performed in emphysematous patients. A major study of LVRS showed that overall, LVRS increases the chance of improved exercise capacity but does not confer a survival advantage over medical therapy. It does yield a survival advantage for patients with both predominantly upper-lobe emphysema and low baseline exercise capacity. Patients previously reported to be at high risk and those with non-upper-lobe emphysema and high baseline exercise capacity were poor candidates for LVRS, because of i mortality and negligible functional gain.

LVRS can be performed by various surgical approaches such as VATs, minithoracotomy, thoracotomy, or sternotomy. These may be unilateral or bilateral, or staged bilateral.

The major complications seen are respiratory failure often complicated by persistent air leaks from staple lines in the poor quality lungs. The requirement for positive pressure ventilation carries a very high morbidity and mortality.
