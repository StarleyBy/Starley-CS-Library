## Routine care of the thoracic patient

Thoracic surgery in adults includes surgery to the lungs (including lung transplantation), pleura, thymus, oesophagus, and other thoracic structures as well as the chest wall. Thoracic procedures include lobar resection, pneumonectomy for malignant and non-malignant conditions, mediastinoscopy and mediastinotomy, and bronchoscopy for diagnostic and interventional indications. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is performed for drainage and investigation of effusions, lung resection, sympathectomy, and removal of mediastinal tumours. Other procedures include the surgical management of air-leaks, management of empyema, operations on the chest wall, endobronchial laser surgery, and tracheal stenting and oesophagectomy. All of these patient groups may require admission to cardiothoracic ICU.

The routine care of thoracic surgical patients is aimed at promoting rapid recovery and reducing complications. Thoracotomy is a major operation and is one of the most painful. The nature of the surgery and the common comorbidities of this patient group such as respiratory disease result in an † incidence of respiratory complications. Patients may be admitted to critical care for routine postoperative care in level 2 beds or for level 3 care as a result of a complication of surgery, whether immediately postoperatively such as bleeding or as a later complication such as respiratory failure.

#### **Routine postoperative care**

#### Analgesia

Pain is the enemy of recovery and will prevent adequate coughing and deep breathing. After lung resection, the patient will generally have a regional technique *in situ* such as paravertebral blockade or thoracic epidural analgesia. This is usually part of a balanced analgesic technique with the administration of regular paracetamol and non-steroidal analgesics. Patient-controlled analgesia is often used to supplement analgesic efficacy of paravertebral block.

### Oxygen therapy

Oxygen therapy should be given to overcome the V/Q mismatch associated with thoracic surgery. Generally humidified oxygen is administered to avoid the drying effects on secretions of the pipeline gases. Oxygen should be prescribed to achieve a SpO $_2$  of 94–98% or 88–92% in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure. High oxygen concentrations may promote absorption atelectasis and lung injury and may also be dangerous in COPD patients with hypoxia-dependant respiratory drive.

#### Chest drainage

Intercostal chest drains are inserted at the end of thoracic surgery to allow drainage of blood (basal drain) and air (apical drain) from the damaged lung. Typically these are each connected to an underwater drainage bottle which operates as a one-way valve which is set at 2cmH<sub>2</sub>O. An additional bottle may be added to allow low pressure suction to be applied to encourage

lung expansion. Low-level suction at  $20 \mathrm{cmH}_2\mathrm{O}$  can be applied. Continued air leak is evidenced by bubbling of the drains.

The pleural drain should swing with respiration if it is patent and bubbling indicates air leak from damage lung and if severe may suggest bronchop-leural fistula.

Automated portable drain systems are now available which are battery driven and generate a constant negative pressure and display a digital display of the air leak in mL/minute.

#### Physiotherapy and mobilization

Physiotherapy and early mobilization are essential for the thoracic patient. The thoracic patient should be managed sitting up at all times. On day 1 they should be mobilized to a chair and begin weight bearing as soon as possible.

Some patients who are at risk of atelectasis and hypoxemia in the postoperative period should have CPAP or BIPAP as preventive measures.

#### Minitracheostomy

When the there is concern that a patient may be unable to cough adequately due to weakness, laryngeal nerve palsy, or excessive secretions, some units will consider the use of a minitracheostomy to assist secretion clearance.

#### Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis

All thoracic patients should have venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis usually in the form of LMWH commenced preoperatively. Epidural catheters should not be inserted or removed within 12 hours of the administration of LMWH. The timing of LMWH should allow preoperative epidural catheter insertion. We give LMWH at 6pm the night before surgery and every 24 hours thereafter.

#### Fluid administration

It is generally accepted that thoracic patient should be relatively fluid restricted and fluids should be prescribed with caution. A typical post-op prescription would be 1mL/kg/hour of Hartmann's solution up to a maximum of 70mL/hour. There is an association between post thoracotomy ALI and excessive fluid administration; however, the causal relationship has never been conclusively demonstrated. Units will have local policies for fluid administration.

#### Antibiotic prophylaxis

Antibiotics are commonly administered after thoracotomy for 24 hours. Local protocols should be followed.

#### **Bronchodilators**

In asthmatics and patients with reversibility of their airways disease, bronchodilators are indicated. Generally the routine inhalers are continued through the perioperative period although inhalers may be converted to nebulizers. Salbutamol may contribute to the risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation and as such should not be routinely prescribed. Ipratropium is better tolerated and can be used where the benefits of  $\beta_{\rm 2}$  agonists are borderline.

## 174 Chapter 8 **The thoracic patient**

### *Nutrition*

Nutritional deficiencies are common in thoracic patients as a consequence of chronic infection (empyema), cancer cachexia, and dysphagia (oesophageal disorders). Early feeding is encouraged and where appetite is poor and/or dysphagia prevents consumption of adequate calories enteral feeding should be established.

## **Postoperative respiratory failure**

Respiratory complications occur in 25% of patients after lung resection. Of these, the more severe will require admission to ICU and up to 5% may require positive pressure ventilation. The reasons for postoperative respiratory failure are multifold. Patients may have significant underlying respiratory disease and then may fail to tolerate the loss of lung function associated with the lung resection. Recovery from surgery is complicated by postoperative pain and its consequences, such as the restriction in coughing and deep breathing. Opiate analgesia may also suppress cough reflexes, and cause sedation and hypoventilation. These variables conspire to cause atelectasis and sputum retention which may develop into postoperative pneumonia. ALI after lung resection is a major contributing factor in many patients and may be underdiagnosed.

## **Aetiology of postoperative respiratory failure**

- Atelectasis
- ALI/ARDS
- Pneumonia
- Severe underlying respiratory disease
- Excessive resection
- PE
- Aspiration.

## **Thoracic conditions which may result in respiratory failure**

- Blunt chest trauma and lung contusion
- Chest stabbing
- Bronchopleural fistula
- Empyema.

## **Principles of management**

When respiratory failure occurs after thoracic surgery, the causes are often multifactorial and treatment is both supportive and aimed at the underlying causes. Nosocomial respiratory infection may accompany atelectasis and ALI. Non-invasive ventilation reduces the requirement for intubation and intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) and improves outcomes in type 2 respiratory failure. The following interventions may be indicated:

- Non-invasive ventilation:
  - • Nasal CPAP
  - • BiPAP
  - • CPAP and pressure support
  - • Hood CPAP
- Minitracheostomy
- Intubation and IPPV
- Early tracheostomy
- Physiotherapy and mobilization
- Sputum culture and antibiotics:
  - • Hospital acquired vs community acquired
- Fluid restriction

## 176 Chapter 8 **The thoracic patient**

- Bronchodilators:
  - • Beta agonists: salbutamol
    - • Cholinergic: ipratropium
  - • Steroids: beclometasone
- Systemic steroids
- Enteral feeding
- DVT prophylaxis.

## Post-thoracotomy acute lung injury

Formerly known as post-pneumonectomy pulmonary oedema but also occurs after lesser resections. Often rapidly progressive syndrome of non-cardiogenic pulmonary infiltration and hypoxia developing after thoracotomy. Clinical, radiological, and histopathological characteristics are similar to ARDS. A bimodal distribution of onset has been described.

#### Definition

ALI/ARDS diagnosed as per the American-European consensus definition:

- Acute onset of hypoxaemia: PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio <300mmHg for ALI/<200mmHg for ARDS (regardless of level of PEEP).</li>
- Bilateral infiltrates on CXR.
- PAWP <18mmHg (but rarely measured in this group) or no evidence of left atrial hypertension.

#### Incidence

• Reports vary: 2–5% after lobectomy, 2.5–15% after pneumonectomy.

#### **Outcome**

 Mortality 40–60%. Some series report 100% for ARDS requiring intubation.

## Early or 'primary' ALI

• Postoperative days 0–3.

#### Pathophysiology

Both ipsilateral and contralateral lungs are exposed to inflammatory and oxidative insults secondary to:

- Ipsilateral: atelectasis, surgical manipulation, ischaemia-reperfusion
- Contralateral: hyperoxia, high airway pressures (barotrauma), hyperinflation (volutrauma), hyperperfusion.

#### Risk factors

- High intraoperative ventilatory pressures (both duration of one lung ventilation and peak airway pressure appear to be important)
- Large tidal volumes on one-lung ventilation
- Excessive IV volume replacement
- Pneumonectomy > lobectomy > lesser resections
- Right sided resection > left
- Preoperative alcohol abuse
- Preoperative respiratory function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>)).

## Late or 'secondary' ALI

- Post-operative days 3–10
- Secondary to obvious causes:
  - Pneumonia
  - Aspiration
  - · Bronchopulmonary fistula.

#### **Prevention**

Prevention is key. Early use of non-invasive ventilation is favoured to avoid intubation. Mortality increases dramatically if positive pressure ventilation is required.

- Lung protective ventilatory strategies during one-lung ventilation are widely believed to be of benefit (limited evidence base):
  - Reduced FiO<sub>3</sub>: 30–50% in absence of hypoxia
  - Low physiological tidal volume ~6mL/kg or less
  - · Pressure-limited ventilation—minimize peak pressure
  - Prevention of atelectasis through use of PEEP ~5cmH<sub>2</sub>O
  - Use of recruitment manageuvres
- Fluid restriction:
  - Minimize IVI—restrictive/goal-directed approach intraoperatively and for following 24–48 hours
  - Use of vasopressors to treat (non-haemorrhagic) hypotension (e.g. noradrenaline 0.02–0.2mcg/kg/min)
- Inhaled β2 agonists (e.g. nebulized salbutamol 2.5–5mg 4-hourly)
- Chest physiotherapy, early mobilization
- Early use of non-invasive ventilation in at-risk patient.

#### **Management**

It is essential to identify and treat any underlying primary cause for respiratory failure, e.g. aspiration, pneumonia, pneumothorax, PE:

- Oxygen
- Chest physiotherapy
- Close attention to fluid balance:
  - Consider induced diuresis
  - Use of vasopressors to treat (non-haemorrhagic) hypotension (e.g. noradrenaline 0.02–0.2mcg/kg/min)
- Non-invasive ventilation
- Intubation and positive pressure ventilation:
  - Lung protective ventilation with limited tidal volumes and minimizing airway pressures (see Chapter 26)
- Experimental/proposed therapies described in the literature (predominantly observational data in small numbers of patients):
  - Corticosteroids
  - · Inhaled nitric oxide
  - Extracorporeal CO, removal.

## **Chest drainage**

The intrapleural drain is essential for treatment and prevention of pneumothorax and drainage of pleural collections of blood, pleural effusion, or empyema. They are routinely sited after thoracotomy and lung resection. Classically two drains are inserted: an apical drain for air drainage and a basal drain for drainage of blood. Single drains placed apically with basal sideholes are now popular and cause less pain.

After cardiac surgery, mediastinal and pleural drains are inserted for drainage of blood.

Insertion of intercostal drains can be dangerous particularly when there are pleural adhesions. Special care should be taken when there has been previous intrathoracic surgery.

Full aseptic technique should be used and the drain position should be confirmed on CXR afterwards.

Drains *in situ* should never be advanced further into chest as this can introduce infection.

## **Indications for chest drain insertion**

- Pneumothorax in any ventilated patient
- Tension pneumothorax after initial needle decompression
- Persistent or recurrent pneumothorax after simple aspiration
- Large secondary spontaneous pneumothorax in patients >50 years
- Malignant pleural effusion
- Empyema and complicated parapneumonic pleural effusion
- Traumatic haemopneumothorax
- Postoperative, e.g. thoracotomy, oesophagectomy, cardiac surgery.

#### **Pre-insertion check**

- Consent.
- Bleeding risk: check coagulation screen and platelets if risk of abnormality.
- Diagnostic challenges: it is important to differentiate between the presence of collapse and a pleural effusion when the chest radiograph shows a unilateral 'whiteout'. Ultrasound can be useful.
- Lung densely adherent to the chest wall throughout the hemithorax is an absolute contraindication to chest drain insertion.
- The drainage of a post-pneumonectomy space should only be carried out by or after consultation with a thoracic surgeon.

## **Potential complications**

- Bleeding
- Damage to underlying lung
- Cardiac damage with trochar
- Hepatic or splenic injury
- Injury to intercostal neurovascular bundle
- Infection of intrapleural space and sepsis.

## **Chest drainage techniques**

- Chest drainage is a dangerous procedure and should be only be performed by trained individuals.
- Bedside ultrasound reduces the risk of intercostal chest drain (ICD) insertion.
- A Seldinger technique for introduction of small-bore ICD (8–4FG) may reduce risks of damage to the underlying lung and is used for pleural fluid aspiration.
- A large-bore (>24FG) size of ICD tube must be inserted when blood drainage is required.
- The insertion site should be in the 'triangle of safety' (see Fig. 8.4). This is the triangle bordered by the anterior border of the latissimus dorsi, the lateral border of the pectoralis major muscle, a line superior to the horizontal level of the nipple, and an apex below the axilla.

### **Removal of drains**

- Drains for pneumothorax are generally not removed until bubbling has stopped and CXR shows lung re-expansion.
- When bleeding has become insignificant.
- There is no benefit in clamping the chest drain before removal.
- CXR should be repeated after drain removal.

## **Thoracic surgical drainage system**

• Suction of 0–20cmH2 O can be applied if the is lung not fully inflated by attaching an additional underwater drain bottle and attaching to wall with low pressure suction.

## **Electronic drainage systems**

Electronic systems driven by battery and/or mains have potential benefits for thoracic surgery. The pump applies continuous suction and is small and has no fluid level which allows easier patient mobility. The pump applies a constant level of suction and gives a digital display of air leak in mL/minute. This allows better quantification of air leak and the drains can generally be removed when the air leak falls below 50mL/hour.

### **Mobile pleural drainage**

When patients with intrapleural drains are transferred a flutter valve (or Heimlich valve) can be used if there is air leak without significant fluid or blood drainage.

## **Bronchopleural fistula**

A bronchopleural fistula (BPF) is a persistent communication between the bronchial tree and the pleural space. Patients with bronchopleural fistula present particular management challenges. The BPF results in an air leak from the lung and consequently there is acquired infection of the pleural space and empyema. Initial treatment often involves drainage of the pleural space which can be difficult as there is often loculation of the empyema. The chronic infection in the pleural space progressively results in debility and weight loss. Spillage of infected pleural fluid into the airway contaminates the good lung and results in recurrent chest infection.

## **Causes of BPF**

- Post-pneumonectomy stump dehiscence
- Carcinoma of lung
- Tuberculosis
- Traumatic.

#### *Management*

In the event of a patient with BPF requiring intubation and ventilation, special consideration should be given to the risk of inadequate ventilation due to massive air leak and airway contamination. If the BPF is post pneumonectomy, lung isolation may be required and the placement of a double-lumen tube may be necessary. A rapid sequence induction with pre-oxygenation and accurate placement of a double-lumen tube with the help of a fibrescope is the technique of choice. Alternative ventilation strategies such as the use of jet ventilation or high-frequency oscillation may have a place when the air leak is persistent and severe. These techniques are not universally available.

The surgical management of the BPF will be guided by the thoracic surgical team.

## **Thoracic airway obstruction**

Thoracic patients with life-threatening obstruction to their trachea and lower airways may be admitted to cardiothoracic ICU for emergency management. After initial stabilization, investigations and diagnosis lead to definitive treatment.

## **Aetiology of airway obstruction**

- Foreign body
- Trauma (post intubation, burns, and other forms of trauma)
- Neoplasm of the trachea or major bronchus
- Mediastinal lymphoma
- Thymic tumours.

Diagnostic investigations often include CT scan, rigid bronchoscopy, and mediastinoscopy with biopsy for histological diagnosis. Relief of airway obstruction may require initial intubation and treatment with steroids and/ or radiological placement of airway stents prior to definitive treatment with further surgery or chemotherapy/radiotherapy.

## **Lung volume reduction surgery**

Conventional lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) is a palliative operation in patients with severe emphysema. The surgical removal of emphysematous lung areas reduces the hyperexpanded lung volume and gives mechanical advantage. This may result in improvement in life expectancy and symptoms. Lesser forms of surgery such as simple bullectomy may also be performed in emphysematous patients. A major study of LVRS showed that overall, LVRS increases the chance of improved exercise capacity but does not confer a survival advantage over medical therapy. It does yield a survival advantage for patients with both predominantly upper-lobe emphysema and low baseline exercise capacity. Patients previously reported to be at high risk and those with non-upper-lobe emphysema and high baseline exercise capacity were poor candidates for LVRS, because of i mortality and negligible functional gain.

LVRS can be performed by various surgical approaches such as VATs, minithoracotomy, thoracotomy, or sternotomy. These may be unilateral or bilateral, or staged bilateral.

The major complications seen are respiratory failure often complicated by persistent air leaks from staple lines in the poor quality lungs. The requirement for positive pressure ventilation carries a very high morbidity and mortality.
