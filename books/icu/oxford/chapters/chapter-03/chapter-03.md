# **Fast-tracking the low-risk patient**

Achieving a rapid and sustained recovery is one of the primary goals in the modern management of cardiac surgical patients.

Advancements in surgery, anaesthesia, and improved patient selection and preparation have led to the development of fast-track programmes.

The defining characteristic of these programmes is the reduction in the use of critical care resources in the postoperative period. Instead, the patient is managed in a specialized recovery of postsurgical care unit and stepped down to the cardiac surgical ward directly from there.

<summary>Principles of fast-tracking the low-risk patient</summary>
<div class="details-content">

The key elements are:

- *Patient*: low risk profile, preserved ventricular function, minimal co-morbidity.
- *Surgery*: attention to good haemostasis, minimal blood loss, and meticulous wound management
- *Anaesthesia*: achieving haemodynamic stability and using short-acting anaesthetic drugs.
- *Recovery unit*: aggressive normothermia, no postoperative sedation, clear bleeding protocol, tight extubation protocol.

Applying these principles has been shown to be equally safe for the patient when compared to the traditional critical care pathway.

When looking at the overall in-hospital mortality in a series of almost 8000 patients, a retrospective analysis could not demonstrate an increased risk of adverse outcome when compared to historical controls.

However, this publication also showed that in spite achieving faster initial recovery and extubation, this not necessarily translated in shorter hospital length of stay and stresses the need that working fast-track concepts should be part of a wider enhanced recovery (ER) programme to utilize its potential.

<summary>Examples of fast-track protocols</summary>

Two major versions of fast-track protocols after cardiac surgery have been described. They share similarities, but depend on the hospital's resources and infrastructure.

- *The recovery room concept* (Fig. 3.): this means that the patient is either extubated in theatre and then transferred to the theatre's main recovery room or extubation will take place there shortly after arrival. The patient is looked after by specially trained recovery nurses and a dedicated anaesthetist and surgeon overlook the patient's recovery, able to troubleshoot if required. When achieving predefined criteria, the patient is discharged straight to the surgical high dependency unit (HDU).
- *The cardiac recovery unit concept* (Fig. 3.2): in this version the hospital provides a special unit of recovery beds close to theatres. All suitable patients will be admitted either extubated or they will be recovered according to strict protocols that are designed to avoid unnecessary delays. Once a patient has achieved a certain level of recovery they will be discharged to HDU. Dependent on the capacity, there is the

option to recover the patient further without moving them for another 24 hours, followed by a discharge straight to the ward.

Both models include the option that any patient who deteriorates or for other reasons is not suitable for either concept will be admitted in the ICU.

<summary>What is enhanced recovery?</summary>
<div class="details-content">

ER is a high-quality surgical care pathway and a concept to get patients better, sooner. The major goals behind ER are:

- To reduce morbidity and mortality
- To allow stable mental recovery
- To reduce hospital length of stay
- To improve functional capacity
- To reduce inflammatory response
- To reduce development of chronic pain.

This development was influenced and supported by improved and less invasive surgical techniques, better understanding of controlling surgical pain, newer and cleaner general and local anaesthetics, and more evidence-based perioperative supportive care.

The potential improvements with ER for cardiac surgical patients include:

- Savings (ICU, staff, improved capacity)
- Patient experience (earlier discharge)
- Economic (rehabilitation into work force)
- Clinical (reduced hospital complications).

<summary>Components of ER</summary>
<div class="details-content">

As a multidisciplinary programme, ER focuses on the attitude and work ethic of combining various components and elements that individually are evidence-based and applicable for the surgical pathway.

The following components have been identified as positive contributors to ER:

- Pre-assessment: comprehensive consent, motivated patient
- Scheduling: suitable surgical teams and resources
- Patient preparation: reduce fasting times, allow carbohydrate drinks
- Surgical technique: minimal invasive procedures, haemostasis, normothermia, local anaesthesia
- Anaesthetic technique: short-acting drugs, regional anaesthesia,
  - cardiovascular stability
- Early extubation
- Drains: timely removal of chest drains, central venous lines and urinary catheter
- Physiotherapy: intense chest physiotherapy and mobilization
- Nutrition: early oral nutrition and balanced diet.
