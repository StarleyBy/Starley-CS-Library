<div class="details-content">

Major surgery triggers a systemic inflammatory response. This is particularly so in cases involving CPB due to the exposure of the blood to the artificial surface. Biochemical and physiological signs of this response may be found in all post-cardiac surgery patients if one investigates carefully enough; however, it is clinically apparent in only a proportion and problematic in a minority. The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) associated with major surgery is clinically indistinguishable from that triggered by infection (SIRS associated with infection is called sepsis).

Despite the avoidance of bypass a marked SIRS can still occur in off-pump patients as a result of the surgical trespass, cardiac manipulation, and circulatory disturbance.

Potential clinical features include:

- Vasodilation and subsequent hypotension
- Raised lactate
- Capillary leak (relative systemic hypovolaemia, impaired gas exchange, d pulmonary compliance)
- Renal impairment
- Susceptibility to infection
- Delirium.

<summary>Practice point</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Fever, changes in white cell count, and rise in CRP are unreliable signs of infection immediately after cardiac surgery. Clinical history, the presence of other clinical signs (e.g. X-ray changes, sputum production), and culture results should be used in deciding whether to commence antimicrobial therapy in the first 48 hours postoperatively.

<summary>ARDS</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Rarely, full blown ARDS ('pump lung') may occur as part of the inflammatory response after cardiac surgery. Treatment is supportive, as for ARDS from other causes.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Vasoplegia</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Rarely, vasodilation associated with the SIRS triggered by cardiac surgery may be pronounced and intractable to normal therapy with alpha adrenergic agonists and vasopressin (severe vasoplegia). Nitric oxide is a powerful mediator of inflammatory vasodilation. Methylene blue inhibits nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation by a number of mechanisms (scavenges nitric oxide, inhibits nitric oxide synthetase and inhibits guanylate cyclase) and may be effective where other pressor agents are failing:

###### *Dose regimen for methylene blue*

In the presence of a good cardiac index, give a bolus of 1.5mg/kg (make up to 50mL with sterile water and infuse over 30 minutes). Response is rapid if it is going to occur. No major side effects are expected at this dose range. Urine and skin may become discoloured with the skin discolouration potentially interfering with pulse oximetry (but not oxygenation). The bolus may be followed by an infusion of 0.25–1.0mg/kg/hour for 6 hours starting 2 hours after the initial bolus.

<summary><span style="font-size:110%">Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</span></summary>
<div class="details-content">

Heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT type 2) is an immunologically mediated condition where IGG antibodies are formed against heparin-platelet factor 4 (PF4) complexes. Heparin has a high affinity for PF4 and although neither is immunogenic by themselves antibodies are formed to the complexes. The antibodies cause pathological platelet activation and release of tissue factor (promotes thrombosis) from monocytes. HIT may be more likely when heparin exposure occurs in association with conditions that themselves increase the amount of circulating PF4, such as surgery and burns.

A non-immune HIT or HIT type 1 is also described. This is a benign self-limiting condition requiring no treatment. It is a result of the binding of heparin to PF4 per se. It is not associated with antibodies. It causes transient mild thrombocytopenia immediately within the first few days of heparin exposure due to platelet aggregation and sequestration.

The term HIT in common clinical usage refers to HIT type 2.

HIT is associated with thrombocytopenia but is a pro-thrombotic condition. It has a high mortality (30%) in its full clinical manifestation.

Incidence of HIT after exposure to unfractionated heparin has been estimated at between 1% and 5%, incidence is 5–10 times less than that after exposure to LMWH.

Platelet counts should be monitored regularly (usually daily) in all patients in cardiothoracic intensive care.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Clinical features</summary>
<div class="details-content">

##### *Thrombocytopenia*

- Usually occurs 5–10 days after start of heparin therapy.
- Count usually increases within 4–14 days of stopping heparin.
- Count falls to 40,000–80,1000 (<20,000 suggests alternate diagnosis).

##### *Thrombosis*

- Varies with clinical setting.
- Usually more common venous than arterial (4:1).
- Usually occurs after but may occur before thrombocytopenia.
- Includes DVT, PE, CVA, limb ischaemia, myocardial infarction and skin necrosis.
- May manifest as repeated circuit clotting in patient on haemofiltration.
- May occur after cessation of heparin therapy due to persistence of antibodies (antibodies usually disappear within 4 months).

HIT may be triggered by small amounts of heparin, e.g. in heparin flush used in central venous catheters or arterial lines.

Bleeding is uncommon in the absence of other causes of platelet dysfunction.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Diagnosis</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical signs and antibody detection.

##### *Laboratory tests*

Antibody assays are divided into those that test for platelet activation (functional assays) and other methods. Functional assays have a very high specificity (though still variable sensitivity) but are resource intensive and technically demanding. Most laboratories use other methods such as enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISA) or particle gel immunoassay. These tests (particularly ELISA) are highly sensitive (close to 100%) and thus have a high negative predictive value, but are variably specific. Furthermore only a subset of antigens detected by these tests is functionally active in terms of platelet activation. They thus have a high false-positive rate (possibly in the order of 50% vs clinically significant HIT). Ideally, characterization requires detection with a high sensitivity test and characterization with a functional assay but this is will only be possible in laboratories with a special interest.

##### **Practice point**

Understand the type and significance of the HIT antibody tests used by your local laboratory.


  Because of these difficulties a probabilistic approach must be taken. A formal scoring system such as the **4 Ts** score can be incorporated into decision-making (Table 16.1).

#####  Table 16.1 The 4 Ts scoring system
|| Score|||
|--|--|--|--|
| Category| 2 | 1  | 0  | 
| Degree of thrombocytopenia | >50% decrease or nadir 20–100 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L | 30–50% decrease or nadir 10–19 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L | <30% decrease or nadir <10 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L | 
| Timing of thrombocytopenia  | 5–10 days after exposure <strong>or</strong> <1 day if previous exposure within 1 month | >10 days after exposure <strong>or</strong> <1 day if previous exposure between 1 month and 1 year or unclear | No heparin in last year |
| Other causes of thrombocytopenia | None | Possible | Definite |
| Thrombotic phenomena/other clinical | Existing thrombosis, after heparin bolus, new skin necrosis  or acute systemic reaction | Silent or recurrent thrombosis or erythematous skin lesions | None |



Score of 3 points or fewer gives a low risk of HIT and no further action is required. No laboratory tests are undertaken. Heparin does not need to be discontinued. Score of 6 points or more indicates a high risk of HIT. Score of 4 or 5 indicates an intermediate-risk patients heparin should be discontinued, and antibody assay information sought. An alternative anticoagulation regimen should be started immediately as prophylaxis against thrombosis without waiting for laboratory results.

However, diagnosis is difficult as only a proportion of patients (5–30%) with antibodies develop thrombocytopenia. Only a proportion (30–70%) of patients with antibody-related thrombocytopenia develop thrombotic complications. Furthermore there are many causes of thrombocytopenia in critically ill patients. In a minority of patients with HIT (15%) thrombosis may occur with a normal platelet count. If there are pre-existing antibodies from a previous exposure the usual delay in onset may not occur ('rapid onset' HIT). Finally antibody detection varies depending on the method used and between laboratories. See Box 16.1.

<summary>Management</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Once HIT is diagnosed the principles of management are:

- Stop all heparin administration (including LMWHs and low-dose heparin flush)
- Start anticoagulation with an alternative parenteral anticoagulant.

See Table 16.2 for recommendations for cardiac surgery for patients with HIT.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Warfarin and other vitamin K antagonists in patients with HIT</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Warfarin (and other vitamin K antagonists) are contraindicated in patients in the acute phase of HIT as initiation of warfarin therapy is associated with a procoagulant phase that lasts several days. Lower limb venous gangrene and severe skin necrosis have been described. In patients who are already on warfarin when they develop HIT, warfarin should be stopped and vitamin K should be administered.

Warfarin can be started once platelet count is >150 × 10<sup>9</sup> /L under cover of an alternative anticoagulant. Dosing should be cautious (5mg/day initially).

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Platelet transfusion</summary>
<div class="details-content">

It is unclear whether platelet transfusion actively precipitates thrombosis in HIT. Prophylactic platelet transfusion is unnecessary as bleeding is rare.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Alternative anticoagulants</summary>
<div class="details-content">

This is an area which is currently evolving. All alternative strategies have balancing advantages and disadvantages. In patients without thrombosis the alternative anticoagulant should be continued until the platelet count has recovered to a stable plateau. Options include:

- Factor Xa antagonists:
  -  Danaparoid—half-life of 24 hours with no specific antidote. Partially excreted in urine so accumulates in renal dysfunction. Monitor anti Xa level. Occasional (<10% cases) cross-reactivity with HIT IgG. Not available in USA.
  - Fondaparinux—synthetic heparin analogue. Forms anti PF4/heparin antibodies but these tend not to trigger HIT. Half-life of 8 hours. Renal excretion. No specific antidote.
- Direct thrombin inhibitors:
  - Short half-life. Generally given by IV infusion. No specific antidotes. Partly or largely excreted in urine so accumulate in renal failure.
- Lepirudin.
- Argatroban.
  - Hepatobiliary excretion. Contraindicated in liver cell failure. Monitor by APPT.
- Bivalirudin:
  - 80% cleared by enzymic proteolysis therefore advantageous in significant liver and kidney dysfunction. Requires dose adjustment in renal failure.

##### Table 16.2 Cardiac surgery for patients with HIT
| Clinical picture | Immunological assay | Functional assay | Recommendation for surgery |
|--|--|--|--|
| Remote HIT | Negative | Negative | Use unfractionated heparin | 
| Sub-acute HIT | Positive | Negative | Delay surgery until immune assay negative Or: use bivalirudin |
| Acute HIT | Positive  | Positive | Delay surgery until both assays negative Or: use bivalirudin  | 

<details class="med-details">
<summary>Duration of treatment</summary>
<div class="details-content">

Bilateral lower limb compression ultrasound should be performed in all patients with HIT whether or not there is clinical evidence of DVT. The presence of a DVT influences duration of anticoagulation.

- Patients with HIT and proven venous thrombosis (HITT) should be anticoagulated for 3–6 months.
- Patients with HIT without proven venous thrombosis (isolated HIT) have an elevated risk of thrombosis for at least 30 days. They should be anticoagulated for at least month.
