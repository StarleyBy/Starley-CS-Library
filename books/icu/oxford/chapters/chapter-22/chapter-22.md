## **Cardiac transplantation**

Cardiac transplantation (CTx) is the final option for patients with heart failure who remain symptomatic despite optimal medical and device therapy. Patients need to be free of significant comorbidities so that they can tolerate major cardiac surgery and subsequent immunosuppression.

## **Indications for CTx**

- Advanced chronic heart failure refractory to maximum tolerated medical, device, or surgical therapy. Patients who benefit have an expected annual mortality rate in excess of 25%.
- Life-threatening acute heart failure unresponsive to initial therapy (e.g. post-MI cardiogenic shock)
- Refractory life-threatening arrhythmias
- Intractable angina not amenable to revascularization or other methods of pain control (uncommon indication).

## **Prognosis**

The -year survival following CTx is 85%, with a conditional median survival of 3 years. Patients bridged to CTx with mechanical circulatory support have a higher risk of mortality.

## **Patient selection for heart transplantation**

The selection of patients for CTx is difficult. It is important to identify those at the highest risk of mortality prior to listing, as CTx has a -year mortality of 75%.

#### *Conventional criteria for heart transplantation*

- Severe LV systolic function with NYHA class III or IV symptoms
- Optimal medical therapy (maximum doses of β-blockers, ACE inhibitor, aldosterone antagonists) and CRT-P/D or implantable cardioverter defibrillator device implanted (if indicated).
- Evidence of a poor prognosis, e.g.:
  - • VO<sup>2</sup> max. <2mL/kg/min (on β-blocker) or <4mL/kg/min (if not on β-blocker), ensuring respiratory exchange ratio ≥.05
  - • Elevated BNP (or NT-proBNP) serum concentration
  - • Established composite prognostic scoring system, such as the HFSS or Seattle Heart Failure Model.

#### *Risk factors and contraindications*

Whenever possible, intrinsic organ damage should be differentiated from reversible abnormalities secondary to heart failure. Contraindications include:

- Active malignancy (absolute)—collaborate with oncologists
- Active infection (absolute)
- Irreversible pulmonary hypertension (PVR >5 Wood units, transpulmonary gradient >5mmHg)
- • Advanced irreversible renal disease (eGFR <40mL/min)
- Advanced irreversible hepatic disease
- Irreversible pulmonary parenchymal disease
- Peripheral or cerebrovascular disease

- Life expectancy markedly compromised by other systemic disease
- Inability to comply with immunosuppressive regimen
- Continuing smoking, alcohol, or substance misuse
- Advanced age (>65 in practice, due to comorbidity)
- Diabetes mellitus with microvascular complications
- • Hepatitis B, C, or HIV positive
- • Severe obesity (BMI >30)
- Recent PE (i.e. within 3 months)
- Severe osteoporosis.

## **Immediate post-transplant management**

The perioperative management of heart transplant recipients offers several unique challenges to the cardiothoracic intensivist. As well as the usual postoperative problems of bleeding and haemodynamic instability, there is the added burden of:

- Arrhythmia
- • Fluid status management
- • Bleeding
- Pericardial effusion
- Myocardial stunning due to a long ischaemic time
- RV dysfunction
- Early graft failure
- Immunosuppressive therapy
- Opportunistic infection.

## *Arrhythmia*

Sinus bradycardia and sinus arrest are common. Transient AV block is common but usually resolves within the first few hours.

## *Management*

- Epicardial pacing wires are placed on the atrium and ventricle at the time of surgery. Patients are paced DDD at a rate >0bpm. Daily checks of threshold and sensitivity should be made. See b Mandatory checks, p. 30.
- Implantation of a permanent pacemaker is required in <5% of recipients.

#### *Fluid status management*

- Maintain CVP 5–2mmHg to provide adequate filling without RV overload. Consider colloid replacement in first 24 hours.
- IV loop diuretics by infusion may be required to maintain fluid balance, ± sequential nephronal blockade using thiazide diuretics or aldosterone antagonists.
- CVVH may be required for fluid management.

#### *Bleeding*

Of particular concern in patients undergoing redo surgery or following bridging with an LVAD. Early reversal of anticoagulation and the monitoring of haemostatic function with a thromboelastogram can be of assistance in the management of such patients. Platelet transfusion may be required, especially in those who have been receiving dual antiplatelet drug therapy, but the use of blood products may increase PVR and so be associated with a higher risk of right heart failure.

Blood products should be leucocyte depleted. If the donor and recipient are CMV negative, all blood products should also be CMV negative.

## *Myocardial stunning*

The total ischaemic time of the donor heart (cross-clamp on donor heart to cross-clamp off after implantation) is directly correlated with postoperative myocardial performance. While the shorter the time the better, transplant teams aim for an ischaemic time of <4 hours with an i mortality observed for total ischaemic time >5 hours.

## *Acute RV failure*

Frequently seen in the immediate post-bypass period and is of critical importance. RV failure is precipitated by both the transplanted heart being exposed to an i afterload with high PVR and having reduced contractility secondary to myocardial stunning. The RV tends to overdistend, and so loses forward flow down the RCA. Anastomotic complications, such as kinking or torsion at the pulmonary anastomosis, can contribute to postoperative RV dysfunction.

### *Monitoring*

A PAFC should be inserted to allow continuous monitoring of cardiac output and pulmonary artery pressures (PAPs). Some surgeons also use a left atrial line to allow direct monitoring of left-sided filling pressures. TOE is useful in monitoring RV distension.

• High PA pressures with RAP >20mmHg, LAP <0mmHg, and decreasing cardiac output (CO) and mean arterial pressure (MAP).

#### *Management*

- Maintain sinus rhythm or pace DDD at a heart rate of over 0bpm. Reducing diastolic time helps to reduce distension of the RV.
- Preload—the RV is very preload sensitive and fluid boluses should be restricted to 50–00mL then re-assessed.
- Inotropic support of RV. Agents are chosen for combined actions:
  - • Milrinone is an inotrope which vasodilates the pulmonary vascular bed and reduces systemic vascular tone. Infuse at 0.375–0.75mcg/ kg/min.
  - • Dobutamine is commonly infused with a low dose of dopamine for their combined inotropy and vasodilatation. Both at 2.5–5mcg/kg/ min.
- Reduce afterload. PVR should be managed with inhaled and systemic vasodilator therapy:
  - • Inhaled nitric oxide may be used prophylactically in patients known to have i PVR and should be initiated early where there is any sign of right ventricular distension or dysfunction. Start at 20ppm and titrate down.
  - • Once it is established the i PVR is reversible, inhaled nitric oxide therapy may be converted to IV or oral therapy. Sildenafil IV 0mg three times daily or oral 20mg three times daily.

#### *Early graft failure*

Failure to achieve satisfactory haemodynamics with adequate CO and acceptable filling pressures, without the use of excessive inotropic support, should prompt a complete diagnostic reassessment to exclude technical problems and rejection. Occasionally, short-term support with a VAD (e.g. Levitronix system) or veno-arterial ECMO is necessary to avoid a slide into multisystem organ failure. Retransplantation for acute graft failure early after the original CTx has a 40–60% risk of death at year.

## *Immunosuppressive therapy*

See b Immunosuppression, p. 237.

## *Opportunistic infection*

Prophylactic antibiotics are used in the early postoperative phase.

## **Cardiac allograft rejection**

Rejection can be either cellular or antibody mediated, although in the non-sensitized patient, cellular rejection is the most common form of acute rejection. ISHLT registry data suggests that ∼30% of CTx recipients have a rejection episode in the first postoperative year. Risk factors include:

- • Female sex
- Younger patients
- Patients receiving immunosuppressive induction therapy.

Patients who do not have an acute rejection episode in the first year have a better 3-year survival (94% vs 88%, p=0.00), and are less likely to develop cardiac allograft vasculopathy.

Early rejection is often asymptomatic but clinical signs suspicious of cardiac allograft rejection include:

- Pyrexia
- Atrial arrhythmias
- Changes in ECG voltage
- 3rd heart sound
- Heart failure.

## *Endomyocardial biopsy*

In 973, Philip Caves first described transvenous endomyocardial biopsy to diagnose cardiac allograft rejection. Most centres continue to use this technique in the early phase after CTx, when the risk of rejection is highest, and while immunosuppressive therapy is slowly weaned to maintenance doses. This is generally performed from a right internal jugular approach, although the femoral route can be employed with the use of a long venous sheath. An example of a biopsy protocol is:

- Weekly for the first 6 weeks
- • Fortnightly from 6 weeks to 3 months
- 6-weekly up to year
- Thereafter only when rejection is clinically suspected.

### *Potential complications*

(Total procedural risk of ∼3%.)

• Arrhythmias

- Tamponade
- Tricuspid valve trauma
- Pneumothorax
- Conduction disturbance
- Air embolism
- Nerve palsy.

## *Treatment of cardiac allograft rejection*

(See Table 22..)

- Maintain oral immunosuppressive therapy at optimum levels and ensure compliance.
- Grade R ACR without evidence of allograft dysfunction does not require further therapy.
- • For Grades 2R and 3R ACR, one of the following additional measures is prescribed:
  - • Methylprednisolone g IV daily for 3 days
  - • Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) 0.5mL/kg/day for 3 days
  - • Monomurab-CD3 (OKT3).

## Lung transplantation

Lung transplantation (LTx) is an option for patients with end-stage lung disease, although the number of available donor organs remains far fewer than the number of patients who would stand to benefit from this procedure. LTx was first performed in 1963 by James Hardy, although the patient only survived for 18 days. Multiple other attempts were thwarted by rejection until Joel Cooper performed the first successful single LTx in 1983, followed by double LTx in 1986.

#### Indications

Three conditions account for 70% of LTx: emphysema/COPD, often single lung, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and cystic fibrosis (CF). The primary goal of LTx is to improve prognosis, and this has been shown with CF and IPF, but the outcome in patients with COPD are less compelling. Guidelines for these common indications are:

- COPD: BODE (BMI, airways obstruction, dyspnoea, and exercise capacity), index of 7–10, or hospitalization with acute hypercapnia (pCO<sub>2</sub> >50mmHg (6.7kPa)), or pulmonary hypertension despite O<sub>2</sub> therapy, or FEV<sub>1</sub> <20% and DLCO (diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide) <20%, or homogenous distribution of emphysema.</li>
- CF: FEV<sub>1</sub> <30% predicted, or a rapid decline in FEV<sub>1</sub>; exacerbation requiring ITU, or frequent use of antibiotics; refractory/recurrent pneumothoraces; pulmonary hypertension, O<sub>2</sub>-dependent respiratory failure; hypercapnia.
- IPF: DLCO <39% predicted; >10% fall in forced vital capacity (FVC) in 6 months; SpO<sub>2</sub> <88% in a 6-minute walk test; honeycombing on high-resolution CT (fibrosis score >2).

#### Contraindications

- Malignancy within 5 years
- Advanced major organ dysfunction (heart, kidney, liver)
- Poor compliance
- Poor social support
- Substance abuse
- Age—the prognosis is best in patients <50 years old
- Overt sepsis or hepatitis B/C, HIV infection
- Obesity (BMI >30)
- Other significant comorbidity.

### **Prognosis**

The prognosis following LTx is poorer than following CTx (5.3 vs 10 years). A better outcome is seen in:

- Bilateral lung transplantation (compared with single lung)
- Younger recipients.

## Postoperative management of lung transplant recipients

Following LTx, patients are managed in the ICU with close monitoring of graft function, immunosuppression, and for signs of infection (including CMV). Initial priorities include:

- Reverse isolation
- Early extubation (18–24 hours)

- Early mobilization
- Negative fluid balance.

#### Respiratory management

Maintain  $PaO_2 > 80$ mmHg (10.7kPa) with the lowest inspired  $O_2$  and PEEP possible.

#### **Targets**

- Tidal volume 6-8mL/kg
- PEEP 4—8cm/H<sub>2</sub>O (note: a high PEEP may cause a deterioration in bronchial anastomotic healing, barotrauma, or over-inflation of the native lung in single LTx)
- Peak inspiratory pressure <30cmH<sub>2</sub>O
- Pulmonary toilet 2-hourly
- Chest drain <15cm/H<sub>2</sub>O suction
- Fibreoptic bronchoscopy if atelectasis/infiltration seen, or prior to extubation (to assess bronchial anastomosis and colour of distal bronchus).

#### Haemodynamic targets

- Central venous pressure (CVP) <10cmH<sub>2</sub>O
- MAP >80mmHg
- Mean PAP <50mmHg</li>
- Urine output >0.5mL/kg/hour
- Haematocrit >0.3.

### Graft dysfunction

Early graft dysfunction occurs in  $\sim$ 20% of LTx. If oxygenation deteriorates, prompt investigation (including CXR, perfusion scintigraphy, echocardiography, and CT chest) should be carried out looking for the precipitating cause. Causes include:

- Pulmonary thrombosis/stenosis
- Pulmonary hypertension
- Mediastinal shift in single LTx/COPD
- Re-implant response (reperfusion injury caused by endothelial dysfunction, leading to pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary oedema, and respiratory failure).

## LTx rejection

Acute rejection is characterized by perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrates, whereas chronic rejection is manifest by fibrous scarring, involving the bronchioles and sometimes associated with accelerated fibrointimal changes affecting pulmonary arteries and veins (Table 22.2). Infection and LTx rejection often occur together and can be confused histologically. For that reason, infection needs to be rigorously excluded for the accurate and reproducible interpretation of pulmonary allograft biopsies.

Investigations performed to identify LTx rejection include:

- CXR: performed twice daily for the first week, daily for the second week, then twice weekly. Ill-defined peri-hilar and lower zone nodules and septal lines may raise the suspicion of rejection, although a normal appearance does not exclude an episode of rejection.
- Spirometry: daily pulmonary function tests (PFTs) using a hand-held spirometer, and formal PFTs at discharge and at, and 12 months.
  A >5% reduction in FEV, or VC may be suggestive of rejection.

- • Transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB): routinely performed using fluoroscopy at 0 days post LTx, at discharge, and at, and 2 months. In cases of suspected rejection, biopsies are taken from each lung lobe showing abnormality on CXR.
- • Bronchoalveolar lavage: 50mL aliquots of normal saline administered into infiltrated lobes and recovered by low suction into traps.

## *Immunosuppression*

The majority of lung transplant centres now employ an immunosuppressive strategy that uses a combination of tacrolimus and mycophenolate, with a reducing dose of corticosteroids.

## *Infection*

Infection is very common after lung transplantation due to denervation, bronchial anastomosis, impaired mucociliary function, immunosuppression, and bronchiolitis obliterans occurring as a chronic rejection. As such, bacterial, fungal, viral (particularly cytomegalovirus (CMV)) and protozoal (*Pneumocystis jirovecii* and toxoplasma) infections are a common cause of morbidity and mortality in the early postoperative period. CMV mismatched donors and recipients should be avoided where possible. Prophylaxis for infection should be adopted according to local protocol.

## **Heart–lung transplantation**

The first successful heart–lung transplant was performed in 98 by Dr Bruce Reitz at Stanford Hospital. The number of procedures reported to be performed worldwide is declining, with 50% of centres performing only one such transplant per year.

The primary indications for heart–lung transplantation are:

- Congenital heart disease (39%)
- Primary pulmonary hypertension (25%)
- • CF (4%).

### **The procedure**

The donor heart and lungs are harvested with minimal handling, with the heart flushed with cold cardioplegia solution, and the lungs with modified Collins solution.

Using CPB, the recipient's heart and lungs are removed whilst care is taken to preserve the phrenic nerves and to avoid postoperative bleeding complications from the bronchial artery circulation. The donor heart and lungs are inserted in the anastomotic order: trachea, right atrium, aorta. Care should be taken to keep the donor trachea as short as possible because of the limited vascularity of the area.

## **Prognosis**

Although the prognosis has improved in recent years, the -year mortality is 728%, and around half of patients are dead at 3 years. However, patients surviving the first year have an average life expectancy of nearly 0 years.

## **Immunosuppression**

The calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) ciclosporin and tacrolimus are the cornerstone of immunosuppressive regimens. Traditionally, either is used in combination with corticosteroids and an antiproliferative agent (mycophenolate or azathioprine). The use of induction therapy may delay the introduction of a CNI and reduce the incidence of perioperative renal dysfunction. Tacrolimus is thought to be somewhat more effective than ciclosporin, and mycophenolate has been shown to provide more effective prophylaxis against acute rejection compared with azathioprine. The combination of tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and corticosteroids may therefore be considered to be the most effective form of maintenance immunosuppression at least for the first 6–12 months after transplantation.

#### Calcineurin inhibitors

### Ciclosporin (cyclosporine)

- Commenced when haemodynamics are stable, without evidence of hepatic or renal failure.
- Metabolized via cytochrome P450 pathway
- Starting dose: 4mg/kg/day orally or 1.5mg/kg/day IV in two divided doses (the IV dose is approximately a third of the oral dose).
- Subsequent dose depends on blood levels and renal function, and can be measured in two ways: C<sub>n</sub>—trough level, or C<sub>2</sub>—2 hours post dose.
- Target C<sub>n</sub> levels:
  - 300-400mcg/L for the first 4 weeks
  - 200–250mcg/L from 4 weeks to 6 months
  - 150–200mcg/L from 6 months to 1 year
  - 100-150mcg/L after 1 year.

#### Tacrolimus

- CNI
- 0.15–0.3mg/kg/day orally.

## **Antiproliferative immunosuppressants**

## Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)

- As soon as the patient is able to take oral medications, MMF is commenced at a dose of 1.5g twice a day.
- Adjusted to mitigate side effects.

### Azathioprine

- Day 0: 4mg/kg IV at induction
- Postoperatively: 2mg/kg/day as a single dose if white cell count >4
- Discontinued when MMF commenced.

#### **Corticosteroids**

- Intraoperative: 1g methylprednisolone at release of cross-clamp
- Days 1 and 2: 125mg methylprednisolone IV 12-hourly then oral prednisolone 60mg/day decreasing by 5mg each day and then stopped
- Thereafter, steroids given for acute rejection.

## **Target of rapamycin inhibitors**

#### *Sirolimus and everolimus*

- • Similar efficacy in prophylaxis against acute rejection as MMF.
- Limited use due to adverse effects:
  - • Impaired wound healing
  - • Pericardial effusions
  - • Bacterial and fungal infections
  - • GI effects
  - • Pneumonitis (sirolimus)
  - • Potentiates CNI nephrotoxicity
  - • Drug interactions (cytochrome P450 pathway).

## **Induction therapy**

Many centres use a form of induction therapy with an anti-T-cell antibody to provide additional immunosuppression during the early perioperative period, lower rates of acute rejection, possible host hyporesponsiveness to alloantigen, and renal protection by allowing the delayed introduction of the CNIs. Agents that have been used for this purpose include:

- • Monomurab-CD3 (OKT3)
- Antithymocyte globulin (ATG)
- • Basiliximab and daclizumab (monoclonal antibodies to the IL-2 receptor)
- Alemtuzumab (CAMPATH-H)—humanized antibody against CD52. Profoundly depletes lymphocytes. Used in kidney transplantation; however, there is limited data in heart transplantation and there has been concern about potential cardiac toxicity.
