# Pharmacological support

There is a lack of robust clinical evidence demonstrating a positive impact on survival concerning the use of vasoactive agents. Their use is considered part of supportive care allowing time for definitive treatment of underlying disease processes. This treatment might involve antibiotics for sepsis, management of arrhythmias, or, in the context of cardiothoracic critical care, interventions such as PCI, surgical revascularization, or the institution of mechanical support (discussed in  $\square$  Mechanical circulatory support, p. 294).

The selection and safe use of a particular vasoactive agent is based on knowledge of its cardiovascular effects, clinical indications, and an understanding of its clinical use.

# **Inotropic agents**

#### Catecholamines

Catecholamines exert their cardiovascular effects via activity at specific adrenergic  $(a_1,~\beta_1,~\beta_2)$  and dopaminergic  $(D_1)$  receptors. Sensitive  $\beta$  receptor effects are evident at low plasma concentrations while  $\alpha$  effects become more prominent at higher concentrations.

Myocardial contractility is enhanced by activity at  $\beta_1$  receptors leading to  $\uparrow$  levels of cAMP and intracellular  $Ca^{2^+}$  with the inevitable consequence of  $\uparrow$  myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO<sub>3</sub>).

#### Dobutamine

- Synthetic catecholamine.
- Direct  $\beta_1 > \beta_2$  agonist (3:1 ratio) with some  $\alpha_1$  activity.

# Dose-dependent CVS effects:

- $\uparrow$  contractility ( $\beta_1$  with  $\alpha_1$ ).
- † HR and AV conduction (β₁).
- Vasodilatation ( $\beta_2$  with mixed  $\alpha_1$  agonism/antagonism) at low doses (<5mcg/kg/min).
- Variable effects on vasculature at intermediate doses.
- Vasoconstriction ( $\alpha_1$ ) at higher doses (>15mcg/kg/min).

Predominant effects are increases in SV and CO with SVR moderately reduced or unchanged. MAP may thus fall, remain unchanged, or rise with increasing CO. † MVO<sub>2</sub> is attenuated by a reduction in preload/afterload and offset by augmented myocardial blood flow.

#### Clinical indications:

- First-line agent to support borderline CO post cardiac surgery.
- Low CO (DHF, cardiogenic shock, sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction).

#### Clinical use:

- Dosing: 2.5–25mcg/kg/min; max. 40mcg/kg/min.
- Onset 2 minutes; peak effect 10 minutes; plasma half-life 2 minutes.
- Addition of a vasopressor (e.g. noradrenaline) is often required to maintain MAP.
- Increases HR more than adrenaline for similar increases in CO and may be used as indirect chronotrope.
- Tachycardia and arrhythmias limit upper dose.
- Tachyphylaxis occurs after 48–72 hours.

#### Dopamine

- Endogenous catecholamine precursor to noradrenaline.
- $\alpha_1$ ,  $\beta_1/\beta_2$ ,  $D_1$  agonist with release of neuronal noradrenaline.

## Dose-dependent CVS effects:

- † contractility (β₁)
- † HR and AV conduction (β<sub>4</sub>)
- Vasodilatation at lower doses (0.5–3mcg/kg/min)Renal, mesenteric, coronary (D<sub>4</sub>), peripheral vessels (β<sub>5</sub>)
- Mild vasoconstriction ( $\alpha_1$ ) (3–10mcg/kg/min)
- Vasoconstriction ( $\alpha_1$ ) at higher doses (10–20mcg/kg/min)

Predominant effects are an increase in SV and CO with mild increases in SVR and † MAP. Vasoconstriction at higher doses raises SVR and MAP but also increases PVR and MVO<sub>2</sub>.

#### Renal effects:

- † renal blood flow via † CO (β₁) and vasodilatation (D₁).
- † urine output secondary to † renal blood flow and enhanced natriuesis (D<sub>4</sub>) without altering creatinine clearance

#### Clinical indications:

- First-line agent to support borderline CO post cardiac surgery.
- Shock (cardiogenic, vasodilatory).
- Augmentation of diuresis in DHF.

### Clinical use:

- Dosing: 2–20mcg/kg/min; max. 50mcg/kg/min.
- Peak effect 5–10 minutes; plasma half-life 2 minutes.
- Plasma concentrations unpredictable due to variable clearance in the critically ill.
- Tachyarrhythmias may limit use even at lower doses.
- If inadequate response at <10mcg/kg/min consider switch to adrenaline or addition of a second agent.
- Low-dose dopamine is not effective in the prevention or treatment of acute renal failure.

#### Adrenaline

- Endogenous catecholamine.
- Potent  $\alpha_1$ ,  $\beta_1/\beta_2$  agonist.

# Dose-dependent CVS effects:

- † contractility  $(\beta_1, \beta_2, \alpha_1)$ .
- † HR and AV conduction  $(\beta_1)$ .
- Vasodilatation ( $\beta_2$ ) at low doses (<0.03mcg/kg/min).
- Vasoconstriction  $(\alpha_1)$  at higher doses (>0.03mcg/kg/min).

Increases in SV, HR, CO, and SVR result in significant increases in MAP and  $\rm MVO_2$ . In septic shock, increases in MAP are achieved predominantly by increasing SV.

#### Additional effects:

- Bronchodilation (β<sub>2</sub>).
- Mast cell stabilization.

- i lactate levels (enhanced glycogenolysis and glycolysis with reduced pyruvate utilization).
- i glucose levels (enhanced glycogenolysis).

### Clinical indications:

- First-line agent to support low CO post cardiac surgery.
- Shock (cardiogenic, vasodilatory).
- Bronchospasm/anaphylaxis.
- Cardiac arrest.

# Clinical use:

- Dosing: 0.0–0.5mcg/kg/min; >0.05mcg/kg/min rarely indicated following cardiac surgery.
- Greater efficacy than the other catecholamines.
- Can be used in combination with a phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor to augment CO without the same increases in afterload and MVO2 .
- Tachyarrhythmias remain relatively common.

### *Phosphodiesterase inhibitors*

*Milrinone and enoximone*

• Inhibit PDE breakdown of cAMP in cardiac myocytes and vascular smooth muscle.

# Dose-dependent CVS effects:

- i contractility.
- Enhanced diastolic relaxation.
- Modest increase HR and AV conduction.
- Vasodilatation.

Increases in SV and CO are achieved via moderate increases in contractility along with reduced SVR/PVR. MAP is commonly reduced. Reductions in preload/afterload have a beneficial effect on MVO2 .

#### Clinical indications:

- Second-line agents to support low CO post cardiac surgery.
- Low CO with raised SVR.
- Biventricular or RV failure associated with i PVR, e.g. before and after cardiac transplant, mitral valve surgery.

### Clinical use:

- Milrinone: loading dose 25–50mcg/kg; infusion 0.375–0.75mcg/kg/min; Half-life 2–4 hours.
- Enoximone: loading dose 0.5–mg/kg; infusion 2.5–20mcg/kg/min; half-life 4–6 hours.
- Long half-life means titration to effect is achieved over hours rather than minutes and effects (beneficial and adverse) are similarly prolonged.
- Synergistic effect on CO when used with catecholamines.
- Vasodilatation, which limits clinical use, often requires the addition of a vasopressor (e.g. noradrenaline).
- Useful in the setting of adrenergic receptor downregulation, e.g. chronic HF, or after chronic β-agonist administration.
- Less tachycardia and risk of arrhythmias than with dobutamine.

#### Levosimendan

In common with other members of the calcium sensitizer class levosimendan exerts its main inotropic effects by increasing calcium binding to troponin C. It also opens ATP sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channels and inhibits PDE.

### Dose-dependent CVS effects

- † contractility (Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitization).
- Vasodilatation (K<sup>+</sup> channel opening).
- Enhanced diastolic relaxation (PDE inhibitor activity).

Overall effects are similar to those of PDE inhibitors with increases in SV and CO and a reduction in SVR/PVR. MAP is reduced or unchanged. Minimal effect on MVO<sub>3</sub> while coronary blood flow is †.

#### Clinical indications

- Currently third-line agent to support CO post cardiac surgery.
- Low CO (cardiogenic shock, DHF).

#### Clinical use

- Loading dose 6–12mcg/kg; infusion 0.05–0.2mcg/kg/min for 24 hours.
- Active metabolites; effects persist for up to 9 days.
- May also be useful in adrenergic receptor downregulation.
- When compared with dobutamine it provides similar improvements in CO with smaller increases in MVO<sub>3</sub>.
- Some evidence to suggest improved outcomes in cardiac surgery.
- No long-term survival benefit over dobutamine in treatment of acute DHF.
- Potential for QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias.

# **Vasopressors**

#### Noradrenaline

- Endogenous catecholamine.
- Potent  $\alpha_1$  agonist; modest  $\beta_1$  and limited  $\beta_2$  activity.

# Dose-dependent CVS effects

- Vasoconstriction  $(\alpha_1)$  characterizes its clinical effect.
- Modest increases in contractility  $(\beta_1)$ .
- Minimal increase in HR  $(\beta_1)$ , or reflex decrease  $(\alpha_1)$ .
- Increases PVR

Increases in SVR, with modest increases in SV result in elevated systolic, diastolic and pulse pressure with minimal impact on CO.  $\uparrow$  afterload and contractility result in  $\uparrow$  MVO<sub>2</sub> though coronary flow is  $\uparrow$  secondary to elevated diastolic BP.

#### Clinical indications

Shock (vasodilatory).

#### Clinical use

- Dosing: 0.01–0.3mcg/kg/min; titrated according to MAP or SVR.
- Can be used alone if CO is satisfactory or in combination with an inotrope (e.g. dobutamine/milrinone) if CO is compromised.
- Risk of arterial conduit vasospasm and a reduction in renal/splanchnic blood flow particularly at higher doses.

### Vasopressin

- Endogenous peptide hormone.
- Activity at V1, V2, V3, and oxytocin-type receptors (OTR).

#### Dose-dependent CVS effects

- Vasoconstriction (V1) characterizes its clinical effect.
- Relative sparing of pulmonary, coronary, and cerebral circulations.

Splanchnic, skeletal muscle, and cutaneous vessels are particularly affected. Impact on CO is dependent on increases in SVR and reflex changes in HR.

#### Clinical indications

• Shock (vasodilatory, e.g. vasoplegic syndrome).

#### Clinical use

- Dosing: 0.01–0.1U/min; commonly 0.04U/min.
- Effects relatively preserved during hypoxia and acidosis.
- Reduces splanchnic blood flow more than noradrenaline and may precipitate myocardial ischaemia at higher doses.
- Often introduced in the context of escalating noradrenaline requirements.
  Maintains vascular tone when noradrenaline sensitivity is reduced.

#### Vasodilators

### Glyceryl trinitrate

• Vascular smooth muscle relaxation via † cGMP production.

### Dose-dependent CVS effects

- Vasodilatation (venous > arterial)
- I preload results in a fall in CO, MVO<sub>2</sub>, and a modest reduction in MAP.
  Higher dosing results in a fall in SVR and MAP.

#### Clinical indications

- Hypertension.
- Acute DHF with pulmonary oedema.
- Myocardial ischaemia.

#### Clinical use

- Dosing: 1–10mg/hour; titrated upwards according to MAP.
- Although potentially beneficial in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension its use is limited by falls in SVR/MAP.
- Beneficial effects on myocardial ischaemia are primarily due to reductions in MVO<sub>2</sub> rather than coronary vasodilatation.
- Tachyphylaxis may occur with prolonged infusion.

#### Sodium nitroprusside

Smooth muscle relaxation via release of nitric oxide, increasing cGMP.

## Dose-dependent CVS effects

- Vasodilatation (arterial and venous).
- SVR is reduced. CO is maintained or †.

#### Clinical indications

- Hypertension secondary to † SVR.
- Acute DHF.

#### Clinical use

- Dosing: 0.1–2mcg/kg/min; titrated according to MAP.
- Commonly added to GTN for treatment of resistant hypertension.
- Potential for rebound increases in SVR/MAP on withdrawal.
- Cyanide toxicity is dose and duration dependent and results in tissue hypoxia despite an adequate PaO<sub>2</sub>.

#### Inhaled nitric oxide

Vascular smooth muscle relaxation via † cGMP.

### Dose-dependent effects

- Pulmonary vasodilatation.
- Reduced PVR/RV afterload and improved V/Q matching. Rapidly inactivated by haemoglobin minimizing systemic effects.

#### Clinical indications

- Pulmonary hypertension and/or RV dysfunction with potential reversibility, e.g. following cardiac transplant, mitral valve surgery.
- ARDS with refractive hypoxaemia.

#### Clinical use

- Initial dose: 20ppm, with subsequent reduction to achieve minimum effective dose (usually 1–5ppm).
- Titrated according to pulmonary artery pressure measurements.
- Administered via inspiratory limb of a primed ventilator circuit to minimize nitrogen dioxide levels
- Potential for rebound pulmonary hypertension when weaning dose; sildenafil can be used as an adjunct to withdrawal.
- Improvements in PaO, in ARDS are not sustained.
- No studies have shown that its use reduces mortality.

# **Mechanical circulatory support: extracorporeal life support**

Mechanical support of the circulation can be lifesaving. Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) counterpulsation has long been used as an effective form of circulatory support post cardiotomy; however, it has limitations in advanced circulatory failure. The IABP's main mechanism of action is augmentation of the diastolic myocardial perfusion pressure and reduction in afterload. The improvement in cardiac function often allows weaning of inotropes and the avoidance of harm from their deleterious effects. IABP may be ineffective if cardiac function is profoundly impaired and has the disadvantage that the patient is confined to bed. Short-term ventricular assist devices (VADS) provide full circulatory support which can bridge the patient to either recovery, decision, or transplantation. Where recovery or transplantation is not anticipated in a period of 28 days but is likely to occur, a long-term VAD may be used. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be used for cardiorespiratory support and has a place in the management of both children and adults. The indications, contraindications, and management of these devices are considered in this section.

# **Intra-aortic balloon pump counterpulsation**

IABPs inflate in diastole which augments the diastolic pressure and improves myocardial oxygen supply, deflation on the R wave immediately before systole decreases afterload, and myocardial oxygen demand (Figs 27. and 27.2). The improvement in this supply-demand balance improves ischaemic myocardial failure and systemic perfusion.

The commonly used indications for an IABP are:

- Myocardial 'stunning' after cardiac surgery
- Refractory unstable angina awaiting CABG
- Refractory ischaemic ventricular arrhythmias
- The complications of acute MI:
  - • Acute severe mitral regurgitation
- • Ventricular septal defect (VSD) • The unstable primary PCI patient
- Refractory ventricular failure.

# *Contraindications*

- Severe aortic regurgitation
- Severe calcific aorto-iliac disease and/or peripheral vascular disease
- Disease of the descending aorta (aortic coarctation or aneurysm)
- Sheathless insertion in severe obesity.

### *Potential risks and complications*

- Ischaemic limb
- Bleeding from the insertion site
- Aorta perforation or dissection
- Retroperitoneal bleeding
- Patient confined to bed and <45° head up
- Infection risk particularly with femoral cannulation

- Limb ischaemia
- Thrombocytopenia
- Balloon leak
- Compartment syndrome.

# **Short-term ventricular assist devices**

Short-term VADs are used to support a failing circulation for up to 28 days. The commonest device in use currently in the UK is the Levotronix CentriMag® (Fig. 27.3) which is licensed for 28 days. The CentriMag® is a centrifugal blood pump based on bearingless motor design, magnetic forces are generated to levitate and spin the rotors which propel the blood producing non pulsatile flow.

Short-term VADs have increasingly been used in CICUs as a means to support a failing circulation until recovery has occurred or more definitive treatment can be instituted (Fig. 27.4).

The circuit and pump is designed to minimize risks of clot formation and embolic complications. Despite this anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin is required which must be carefully monitored by frequent activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs).

### *Treatment strategy*

- Bridge to decision
- Bridge to recovery
- Bridge to bridge (long-term device)
- Bridge to transplantation.

## *Indications*

- Dilated cardiomyopathy:
  - • Ischaemic
  - • Myocarditis
  - • Peripartum
- Post cardiotomy
- Congenital heart disease
- Primary graft failure post cardiac transplantation.

- Flows up to 9.9L/min
- No seals or bearings, one moving part
- Magnetically levitated impeller
- Licensed for 30 days
- Cost-effective

#### *Cannulation options*

# *LVAD*

- Inflow cannula:
  - • Left atrium (via right upper pulmonary vein)
  - • Ventricular apex
- Outflow cannula:
  - • Ascending aorta
    - • Descending aorta.

### *RVAD*

- Outflow cannula from right atrium
- Inflow cannula to pulmonary artery.

# **Long-term ventricular assist devices**

The main indication for long-term VADs in the UK is bridge to transplantation. Worldwide as the survival on VADs has improved, the use of long-term VADs for destination therapy has i.

# *Indications*

- Bridge to transplant
- Bridge to recovery.

# *Types of long VADS (Fig. 27.5)*

- st generation: pulsatile displacement pumps
- 2nd generation; continuous flow by rotating impellers
- 3rd generation: centrifugal miniaturized to size of D battery.

### *Components of a long-term LVAD*

- Battery pack
- Mains power module when not mobilizing
- Drive line
- Pump
- Inflow cannula from LV apex to pump
- Outflow cannula form pump usually to ascending aorta.

### *Clinical issues of a long-term LVAD*

- Requires functioning RV
- Anticoagulation with warfarin to INR .5–2.5
- Battery life 4 hours
- Mobilization possible
- Home discharge is the norm
- Resuscitation:
  - • No CPR
  - • *Always defibrillate a shockable rhythm*
- Complicates surgical procedure for heart transplantation.

## *Complications in the early postoperative period in ICU*

- Bleeding can be a major problem:
  - • The causes are surgical, liver dysfunction, residual anticoagulation, and inflammatory-induced coagulopathy and platelet dysfunction.

- • Early intervention to stop haemorrhage is important.
- • Surgical reopening is common.
- • Anticoagulation should be restarted cautiously once bleeding is controlled.
- Right heart failure:
  - • May be due to RV myocardial dysfunction, ventricular interdependence, and i afterload.
  - • Excessive blood product administration may elevate the PVR and increase RV overload.
  - • RV may be impaired due to underlying aetiology of heart failure.
  - • Short-term RVAD hay be required.
  - • RV failure may contribute to the 'suck down effect' where the walls of the left ventricle collapse onto the outflow cannula.
- Hypovolaemia may result in poor pump flow due to lack of venous return.
- Respiratory failure.
- Hepto-renal dysfunction.

# *Long-term complications*

The survival at 2 years of patients who were NYHA IIIb or IV and ineligible for transplantation and treated with a continuous flow pump for destination therapy was 58% at 2 years. Complications were common and tended to be infection, bleeding or thromboembolic related.

- Stroke 8%:
  - • Ischaemic
  - • Haemorrhagic
- Sepsis 36%:
  - • Drive line infection
  - • Pump and pocket infection
  - • Non-LVAD infection
- Pump replacement 9%
- Right heat failure 20%
- Renal and hepatic failure.

# **ECMO**

Extracorporeal life support can be used for cardiorespiratory support (veno-arterial (V-A) ECMO) or respiratory support (veno-venous (V-V) ECMO). In the circuit, generally centrifugal pumps have replaced roller pumps. Compared to CPB, in ECMO a membrane oxygenator designed for long-lasting use is inserted into the circuit. The circuit is simplified to minimize the risk of clotting and inflammatory activation so there is no cardiotomy reservoir.

#### *V-A ECMO*

V-A ECMO can be used as 'crash and burn' resuscitative option in patients with acute cardiogenic shock. The technique allows assessment of neurological function and the potential for end-organ recovery prior to embarking on a long-term VAD. It is commonly used in paediatric cardiac surgery for post cardiotomy failure.

- Can be introduced open or percutaneously.
- Femoral arterial cannulation is popular for percutaneous option.

• Venous cannulation is achieved directly from the right atrium or percutaneously via the right internal jugular or femoral veins.

# *Risks and complications*

- Air embolism
- Bleeding
- Thrombotic risk
- Stroke
- Ischaemic limbs
- Haemolysis
- Infection
- Immobility.

# *V-V ECMO*

V-V ECMO is used to allow resting of the lungs in patients with severe respiratory failure. It has been used mainly in neonatal and paediatrics. The duration of support is usually –2 weeks.

RDS in the adult population has a mortality in excess of 50%. The CESAR study has demonstrated benefits from specialist ECMO centres in the management of these patients.

Cannulation is by percutaneous cannulation of a major vein (internal jugular and/or femoral) with fluoroscopic (or TOE) guidance. Recent bicaval two-stage cannula (Avalon cannula) can be introduced via the IJV.

The indications and outcomes of ECMO are collected by the ELSO registry. In adults, survival with respiratory V-V ECMO support are better than cardiac V-A ECMO at 55% vs 39% at discharge.
