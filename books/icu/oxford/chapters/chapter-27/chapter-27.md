There is a lack of robust clinical evidence demonstrating a positive impact on survival concerning the use of vasoactive agents. Their use is considered part of supportive care allowing time for definitive treatment of underlying disease processes. This treatment might involve antibiotics for sepsis, management of arrhythmias, or, in the context of cardiothoracic critical care, interventions such as PCI, surgical revascularization, or the institution of mechanical support (discussed in  📖  Mechanical circulatory support).

The selection and safe use of a particular vasoactive agent is based on knowledge of its cardiovascular effects, clinical indications, and an understanding of its clinical use.

<div class="details-content">

Catecholamines exert their cardiovascular effects via activity at specific adrenergic  α<sub>1</sub>,β<sub>1</sub>,β<sub>2</sub>)  and dopaminergic  (D<sub>1</sub>)  receptors. Sensitive  β receptor effects ae evident at low plasma concentrations while  α  effects become more prominent at higher concentrations.

Myocardial contractility is enhanced by activity at  β<sub>1</sub>  receptors leading to  ↑  levels of cAMP and intracellular  Ca<sup>2+</sup>  with the inevitable consequence of  ↑  myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO<sub>2</sub>).

Predominant effects are increases in SV and CO with SVR moderately reduced or unchanged. MAP may thus fall, remain unchanged, or rise with increasing CO. ↑ MVO<sub>2</sub> is attenuated by a reduction in preload/afterload and offset by augmented myocardial blood flow.

<summary><span style="font-size:110%">Mechanical circulatory support: extracorporeal life support</span></summary>
<div class="details-content">

Mechanical support of the circulation can be lifesaving. Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) counterpulsation has long been used as an effective form of circulatory support post cardiotomy; however, it has limitations in advanced circulatory failure. The IABP's main mechanism of action is augmentation of the diastolic myocardial perfusion pressure and reduction in afterload. The improvement in cardiac function often allows weaning of inotropes and the avoidance of harm from their deleterious effects. IABP may be ineffective if cardiac function is profoundly impaired and has the disadvantage that the patient is confined to bed. Short-term ventricular assist devices (VADS) provide full circulatory support which can bridge the patient to either recovery, decision, or transplantation. Where recovery or transplantation is not anticipated in a period of 28 days but is likely to occur, a long-term VAD may be used. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be used for cardiorespiratory support and has a place in the management of both children and adults. The indications, contraindications, and management of these devices are considered in this section.


<details class="med-details">
<summary>Intra-aortic balloon pump counterpulsation</summary>
<div class="details-content">

IABPs inflate in diastole which augments the diastolic pressure and improves myocardial oxygen supply, deflation on the R wave immediately before systole decreases afterload, and myocardial oxygen demand (Figs 27.1 and 27.2). The improvement in this supply-demand balance improves ischaemic myocardial failure and systemic perfusion.

Short-term VADs are used to support a failing circulation for up to 28 days. The commonest device in use currently in the UK is the Levotronix CentriMag® (Fig. 27.3) which is licensed for 28 days. The CentriMag® is a centrifugal blood pump based on bearingless motor design, magnetic forces are generated to levitate and spin the rotors which propel the blood producing non pulsatile flow.

Short-term VADs have increasingly been used in CICUs as a means to support a failing circulation until recovery has occurred or more definitive treatment can be instituted (Fig. 27.4).

The circuit and pump is designed to minimize risks of clot formation and embolic complications. Despite this anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin is required which must be carefully monitored by frequent activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs).

- • Early intervention to stop haemorrhage is important.
- • Surgical reopening is common.
- • Anticoagulation should be restarted cautiously once bleeding is controlled.
- Right heart failure:
  - • May be due to RV myocardial dysfunction, ventricular interdependence, and i afterload.
  - • Excessive blood product administration may elevate the PVR and increase RV overload.
  - • RV may be impaired due to underlying aetiology of heart failure.
  - • Short-term RVAD hay be required.
  - • RV failure may contribute to the 'suck down effect' where the walls of the left ventricle collapse onto the outflow cannula.

Extracorporeal life support can be used for cardiorespiratory support (veno-arterial (V-A) ECMO) or respiratory support (veno-venous (V-V) ECMO). In the circuit, generally centrifugal pumps have replaced roller pumps. Compared to CPB, in ECMO a membrane oxygenator designed for long-lasting use is inserted into the circuit. The circuit is simplified to minimize the risk of clotting and inflammatory activation so there is no cardiotomy reservoir.

<details class="med-details">
<summary>V-A ECMO</summary>
<div class="details-content">

V-A ECMO can be used as 'crash and burn' resuscitative option in patients with acute cardiogenic shock. The technique allows assessment of neurological function and the potential for end-organ recovery prior to embarking on a long-term VAD. It is commonly used in paediatric cardiac surgery for post cardiotomy failure.

- Can be introduced open or percutaneously.
- Femoral arterial cannulation is popular for percutaneous option.

V-V ECMO is used to allow resting of the lungs in patients with severe respiratory failure. It has been used mainly in neonatal and paediatrics. The duration of support is usually 1–2 weeks.

RDS in the adult population has a mortality in excess of 50%. The CESAR study has demonstrated benefits from specialist ECMO centres in the management of these patients.

Cannulation is by percutaneous cannulation of a major vein (internal jugular and/or femoral) with fluoroscopic (or TOE) guidance. Recent bicaval two-stage cannula (Avalon cannula) can be introduced via the IJV.

The indications and outcomes of ECMO are collected by the ELSO registry. In adults, survival with respiratory V-V ECMO support are better than cardiac V-A ECMO at 55% vs 39% at discharge.

<summary>Targets on V-V ECMO</summary>
<div class="details-content">

- Protective lung ventilation:
  - FiO<sub>2</sub>  30%, PIP 20–25, PEEP 10–15, rate 10.
- Pressure controlled ventilation or BIPAP.
- Target oxygenation  PaO<sub>2</sub>  6–8kPa adjusted with ECMO circuit flow.

The Novalung® is a new pumpless extracorporeal membrane which efficiently removed  CO<sub>2</sub>  and also improves oxygenation but less efficiently. Indications are ventilator refractory respiratory failure with predominant hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis. There is a developing role in the management of lung transplant graft dysfunction, ARDS, and pneumonias. Generally the left femoral artery and right femoral vein are cannulated percutaneously.
