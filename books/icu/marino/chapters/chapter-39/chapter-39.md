# **Liver Failure**

*Intellectually, we stand on an islet in the midst of an illimitable ocean of inexplicability. Our business . . . is to reclaim a little more land.*

T.H. Huxley (*[a](#page-11-0)*)

The management of patients with liver failure is a particular challenge because of the numerous life-supporting functions that are lost when the liver fails. These include: (*a*) the production of about 20,000 proteins, including all the coagulation factors and transport proteins in blood, (*b*) the metabolism of innumerable endogenous and exogenous substances, and (*c*) the removal of microbes that breach the mucosal barrier in the GI tract.

This chapter describes the major problems that prompt ICU admission in patients with liver failure, and includes the problems associated with both acute liver failure (with no prior history of liver disease) and decompensated cirrhosis. This is an expansive topic that is only briefly described here, and a number of clinical practice guidelines are included in the bibliography at the end of the chapter (1–5).

## **ACUTE LIVER FAILURE**

Acute liver failure (ALF) is an abrupt and rapid deterioration in liver function that occurs *de novo*, without prior liver disease. This is an uncommon condition, as demonstrated in [Figure](#page-1-0) 39.1 by the number of cases (2,614) recorded in the United States over a period of 20 years (6).

### **Etiologies**

The conditions included in [Figure](#page-1-0) 39.1 were responsible for about 80% of cases of ALF in the United States, and acetaminophen tops the list by a great margin.

#### *Acetaminophen*

Acetaminophen is the leading cause of ALF in both the United States and the United Kingdom (being responsible for 46% and 64% of cases, respectively) (6). Acetaminophen hepatotoxicity is described in detail in Chapter 52, and is only briefly reviewed here. The source of the liver injury is depletion of hepatic glutathione stores, which results in oxidative cell injury from an

acetaminophen metabolite. (Glutathione is the major intracellular antioxidant in the body, as described in Chapter 25.) The liver injury can begin as early as 12 hours after ingestion, and it peaks in 3 to 5 days (7). The laboratory abnormalities in the early stages of injury are characterized by high alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, with only mild increases in bilirubin (6). Acetaminophen-induced liver injury has two unfortunate features:

**FIGURE 39.1** Causes of acute liver failure recorded by the United States Adult Acute Liver Failure Registry over the time period from Jan, 1998 to March, 2019. Adapted from Reference 6.

- 1. About half of acetaminophen overdoses are unintentional (7), and are the result of attempts to alleviate pain. This is partly due to consumer ignorance about the potential toxicity of acetaminophen, and is partly due to the inclusion of acetaminophen in more than 600 over-thecounter products.
- 2. Acetaminophen is undetectable in the plasma in about 50% of the cases where it causes liver injury (8). This creates a risk of missed diagnoses and poor outcomes, since the condition is treatable.

**N-ACETYLCYSTEINE:** The antidote for acetaminophen hepatotoxicity is N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which acts as a glutathione surrogate (see Figure 25.7). It is usually given intravenously (see Chapter 52 for the dosing regimen), and is started as soon as an acetaminophen overdose is confirmed or suspected. It is most effective when treatment is started within 10 hours of ingestion (7), and the efficacy declines with time thereafter. However, NAC is started at any time after a suspected or confirmed overdose of acetaminophen, and treatment is continued until there is evidence of improvement in liver function. About 75% of cases resolve without the need for liver transplantation (6).

The success of NAC in acetaminophen-induced ALF has led to its use in cases of ALF that are not linked to acetaminophen. Although there is no convincing evidence of benefit (9), it is considered reasonable to use NAC empirically in ALF of undetermined etiology (10).

#### *Other Drugs*

The drugs that have been reported to cause acute liver injury are listed in [Table](#page-2-0) 39.1 (11). Druginduced liver injury can be dose-related or idiosyncratic, and is more likely to occur in patients who are elderly, debilitated, or alcoholic. The idiosyncratic reactions are the most troublesome, with a survival rate of only 40% without liver transplantation (6).

#### *Ischemic Injury*

Ischemic liver injury (sometimes called ischemic hepatitis), typically follows a period of systemic hypoperfusion (e.g., from hemorrhagic shock), and is characterized by very high transaminase levels (e.g., >3,000 IU/L) with only mild increases in bilirubin (<5 mg/dL) (6). This condition tends to resolve if the hypoperfusion resolves, but about 25% of cases need liver transplantation (6).

#### *Acute Hepatitis*

Autoimmune hepatitis has a more insidious onset than the other sources of ALF, and the diagnosis often rests on a clinical history of autoimmune disease, or positive serologies (e.g., antinuclear antibodies or anti-smooth muscle antibodies). About 80% of cases are in women (6), and hypergammaglobulinemia is common.

Viral hepatitis is responsible for <10% of cases of ALF in developed countries (5). Most cases are caused by the hepatitis B virus, which can be a new infection, or a latent infection that is sparked by immunosuppressive therapy. Once liver failure develops, treatment (with nucleoside analogues) is of little value (12), and survival is only 25% without liver transplantation (6).

#### *Other Causes*

Causes of ALF that are not included in [Figure](#page-1-0) 39.1 include the HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets in pregnant and post-partum women), Budd Chiari

<sup>§</sup>Hepatic injury can be dose-related or idiosyncratic.

syndrome (hepatic vein occlusion), other viral infections (e.g., herpes simplex), and infiltrating neoplasms (6).

#### **Clinical Features**

Unlike the liver failure associated with cirrhosis, ALF is not accompanied by ascites or bleeding from esophageal varices. Instead, the clinical picture is dominated by systemic inflammation (originating from the damaged liver) with hemodynamic instability and multiorgan dysfunction (similar to inflammatory shock, as described in Chapter 17).

#### *Hemodynamics*

The hemodynamic instability in ALF is due to vasodilation, and an ineffective circulating blood volume from hypoalbuminemia (10). The management involves volume resuscitation and vasopressors if needed, and *albumin is recommended as the resuscitation fluid*, especially when the serum albumin is below 3 g/dL (2). Albumin is available as a 5% solution that has an albumin concentration of 5 g/dL (similar to the normal concentration in plasma), and about 70% of the infused solution will remain in the intravascular space (see Figure 10.1). The use of *Ringer's lactate is not advised* because it promotes hyponatremia, which will exacerbate the cerebral edema in hepatic encephalopathy.

#### *Acute Kidney Injury*

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is reported in 70% of patients with ALF, and is usually seen in patients with acetaminophen hepatotoxicity, or those with hypotension who require vasopressors (13). Renal replacement therapy is used more aggressively in ALF because it protects against hepatic encephalopathy by removing ammonia as well as excess volume (see next).

### **Hepatic Encephalopathy**

Encephalopathy is the dominant feature of acute liver failure, and is characterized by cerebral edema (as shown in [Figure](#page-4-0) 39.2).

<span id="page-4-0"></span>![](_page_4_Figure_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 39.2** CT images of the head in a patient with acute liver failure, taken before (image on the left) and after (image on the right) the onset of cerebral edema. Note the effacement of sulci and loss of the grey-white interface in the image on the right. Images from Reference 6.

#### *Pathogenesis*

Ammonia has an important role in the cerebral edema that can develop in liver failure (14). Ammonia is a byproduct of protein degradation, and is produced primarily in the bowel (and to a lesser degree in skeletal muscle and kidneys). The liver plays a major role in clearing ammonia by converting it to urea via the urea cycle. This clearance mechanism is impaired or lost in liver failure, resulting in a progressive rise in ammonia levels in blood. Ammonia eventually crosses the blood-brain barrier and is taken up by astrocytes, where it is used to produce glutamine. The subsequent accumulation of glutamine then creates an osmotic force that draws water into the astrocytes and creates *a "cytotoxic" type of cerebral edema*.

#### *Clinical Features*

The clinical manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy include both cognitive and motor deficits. The cognitive changes that appear in progressive stages of hepatic encephalopathy are shown in [Table](#page-4-1) 39.2 (15). Personality changes and mild disorientation are prominent in the early stages, while depressed consciousness dominates the later stages. The motor deficits can appear at any stage, and include extrapyramidal and cerebellar signs like rigidity, dysphagia, ataxia, and a flapping tremor (asterixis).

From Reference 15.

**PLASMA AMMONIA LEVEL:** Plasma ammonia levels are almost always elevated in patients with hepatic encephalopathy, and in many (but not all) cases, there is a correlation between the degree of elevation of the plasma ammonia and the severity of the encephalopathy (16). (This correlation occurs more frequently in ALF than in decompensated cirrhosis.) Arterial ammonia levels may be more predictive than venous levels, at least in the early stages of encephalopathy (16). *An arterial ammonia level >150 μmol/L (normal <60 μmol/L) marks an increased risk of cerebral edema* (17).

#### *Management*

The prevention and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy is aimed at reducing the ammonia burden in the central nervous system. This is done by reducing ammonia production in the bowel (e.g., with lactulose and a nonabsorbable antibiotic), and clearing ammonia from the bloodstream (with hemofiltration).

**LACTULOSE:** Lactulose is a disaccharide that is metabolized by "lactic acid bacteria" (e.g., *Lactobacillus acidophilus*) in the bowel (18). This promotes the formation of short-chain fatty acids, and the resulting acidification of the bowel lumen helps to eradicate ammonia-producing microbes. (The bactericidal actions of an acid pH are illustrated in Figure 4.3.) The dosing recommendations for lactulose are as follows (19):

- 1. *Oral or Nasogastric Route:* Start with 20–30 g (30–45 mL) every hour until laxation occurs, then reduce to 20 g (30 mL) every 8 hours, and titrate to achieve 2–3 loose stools daily.
- 2. *Retention Enema:* Mix 200 g (300 mL) with 700 mL of tap water. Administer by high rectal enema, and retain for 30–60 minutes with patient in the Trendelenburg position.

Lactulose can produce an osmotic diarrhea, and the dosage should be reduced (or temporarily halted) if diarrhea appears.

**RIFAXIMIN:** Rifaximin is a nonabsorbable antibiotic with a wide spectrum of activity that has proven successful in alleviating symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy when given in a dose of 400 mg three times daily for at least 10 days (20). Although effective when used alone, it is usually combined with lactulose.

**HEMOFILTRATION:** Continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) can lower plasma ammonia levels and improve outcomes in patients with ALF (21), especially with continued use (20). At

the present time, CVVH is considered superior to lactulose or rifaximin for patients with ALF and hepatic encephalopathy, and should be considered in the following situations: (*a*) persistent oliguria, (*b*) plasma ammonia level >150 μmol/L, and (*c*) evidence of cerebral edema, regardless of the serum creatinine (5). CVVH should be started as soon as possible, as its effectiveness is time-dependent (22).

#### *Liver Transplantation*

Liver transplantation is the definitive treatment for ALF, and has reduced the mortality rate from 80% to 33% (6). There are several scoring systems that are used to identify who will benefit from transplantation, but this is the domain of the transplant specialist, who should be consulted for any patient with ALF who develops progressive hepatic encephalopathy.

### **ACUTE-ON-CHRONIC LIVER FAILURE**

Most admissions to the ICU for liver failure involve patients with chronic liver disease (usually cirrhosis) who experience an abrupt deterioration in liver function. This *acute-on-chronic liver failure* is often complicated by: (*a*) bleeding from gastroesophageal varices, (*b*) hepatic encephalopathy, (*c*) infections, and (*d*) acute kidney injury. This section describes each of these complications, with the exception of hepatic encephalopathy, which is described in the previous section.

**FIGURE 39.3** Endoscopic view of esophageal varices, which appear as engorged submucosal veins (outlined by the dotted line). Image courtesy of S. Bhimji, MD; digitally retouched.

### **Variceal Hemorrhage**

Gastroesophageal varices are engorged submucosal veins that appear as a consequence of portal hypertension (see [Figure](#page-6-0) 39.3). Acute bleeding from ruptured varices is one of the more lifethreatening complications of advanced liver disease.

#### *Management*

The management of acute variceal bleeding, which is outlined in [Table](#page-7-0) 39.3 (4), involves source

control (with endoscopy), resuscitation (with fluids and blood products), vasoactive therapy (with octreotide), and prophylactic measures (with antibiotics). Intubation may also be necessary in patients with altered mentation.

From the guidelines in References 1 and 4.

Endoscopy is recommended within 12 hours of presentation (1,4), both to identify the source of the bleeding (which has prognostic value) and to clip or band the bleeding varix. The resuscitation with asanguinous fluids and blood products is the same as described for hemorrhagic shock in Chapter 15, with the following exceptions:

- 1. Albumin is recommended as a resuscitation fluid, especially when the serum albumin is less than 3 g/dL (2). The 5% albumin solution has an albumin concentration of 5 g/dL, which is close to the normal albumin concentration in plasma, and about 70% of the infused volume will expand the plasma volume.
- 2. Hypotonic fluids like Ringer's lactate are not recommended because they add to the risk of cerebral edema (which is responsible for hepatic encephalopathy).
- 3. The INR is not a valid measure of bleeding risk in patients with cirrhosis (4), and thromboelastography (described in Chapter 15) is recommended to guide hemostatic therapy (1).

The management of variceal bleeding also includes a splanchnic vasoconstrictor like *octreotide*, a somatostatin analogue that is started as soon as possible, using the dosing regimen in [Table](#page-7-0) 39.3. Prophylactic antibiotics should also be started as soon as possible, and *ceftriaxone* (2 grams daily) is recommended in most guidelines (2,4). (*Note:* This recommendation assumes that resistant microbes are not prevalent in your ICU.)

#### *Refractory Bleeding*

Variceal bleeding is refractory to endoscopy and optimal medical management in about 20% of

cases (4). In this situation, a transesophageal portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure should be considered. TIPS is a noninvasive method that creates a shunt between the portal and hepatic veins, thereby alleviating the portal venous hypertension that creates varices. Unfortunately, the TIPS procedure trades one problem for another, as bypassing the liver increases the risk of hepatic encephalopathy.

### **Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis**

About one-third of patients with decompensated cirrhosis have a bacterial infection, and the most common infection is *spontaneous bacterial peritonitis* (SBP), which is an infection of ascitic fluid without a primary site of infection in the abdomen (5). The source of this infection is the "translocation" of enteric pathogens across the bowel mucosa. SBP occurs only in patients with cirrhosis and ascites, because cirrhosis impairs the normal function of the liver to eradicate microbes that translocate across the bowel wall.

About 50% of cases of SBP are community-acquired, while 25% are classified as "healthcare-associated" (i.e., the patient has had contact with a healthcare facility within 90 days), and the remaining 25% are nosocomial (23). A single organism is isolated in most cases of SBP, and the most common isolates are gram-negative organisms (especially *Escherichia coli* and *Klebsiella pneumoniae*) with gram-positive organisms (usually staphylococci and enterococci) a distant second (23). Resistant organisms are isolated in 35% of cases worldwide, but the prevalence is much lower (16%) in the United States (23).

#### *Diagnosis*

SBP can present with fever, abdominal pain, and rebound tenderness, but it is asymptomatic in one-third of cases (24). A paracentesis is required for the diagnosis, and *an absolute neutrophil count >250/mm3 in ascitic fluid secures the diagnosis, regardless of the culture result* (5). An organism is isolated in about 60% of cases (23). A positive culture without the required neutrophil count in ascitic fluid is not sufficient for the diagnosis of SBP (5). (In this situation, a repeat paracentesis is wise.)

SBP should be suspected in all patients with decompensated cirrhosis and liver failure who are admitted to the ICU, or who experience a sudden deterioration while in the hospital (5). A paracentesis should be performed when SBP is suspected, and the fluid sent for cell count and culture. For optimal culture results, the ascitic fluid should be added to blood culture bottles (aerobic and anaerobic) at the bedside.

### *Antibiotic Therapy*

Antibiotic therapy is started in all cases when the absolute neutrophil count is >250/mm3 (before the culture results are available). The choice of antibiotic is determined by the place of origin of the infection, and the prevalence of resistant organisms in your ICU. This is shown in the algorithm in [Figure](#page-9-0) 39.4 (25), which can be summarized as follows:

- 1. Resistant organisms are unlikely in community-acquired SBP (23), and a third generation cephalosporin (e.g., cefotaxime or ceftriaxone) is generally recommended.
- 2. Resistant organisms are typically isolated in nosocomial cases of SBP, and less frequently in healthcare-associated infections (23). (*Note:* A nosocomial infection is one that appears after

48 hrs in the hospital, while a healthcare-associated infection is one that appears within 48 hrs after admission in a patient who has had contact with a healthcare facility in the last 90 days.)

- a. If a resistant infection is possible, a carbapenem (e.g., meropenem 1 gram every 8 hours) is recommended (25), with vancomycin added if methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* is a potential offender, or daptomycin if vancomycin-resistant enterococci are suspected.
- b. If a resistant organism is unlikely, broad-spectrum coverage for enteric pathogens (e.g., with piperacillin-tazobactam) is sufficient.

<span id="page-9-0"></span>Antibiotics should be continued for at least 7 days, regardless of the culture results. The response to antibiotics can be assessed by a repeat paracentesis after 48 hours: i.e., a favorable response is defined as a ≥25% decrease in the neutrophil count (5).

#### *Albumin Infusions*

Infusions of albumin have been shown to improve survival in SBP (26,27). This was originally attributed to an improvement in renal function (27), because acute kidney injury develops in 30% of patients with SBP (25), and this increases the mortality rate considerably (28). However, more recent studies have shown that the survival benefit of albumin is independent of the serum creatinine (26). The recommended albumin regimen is 1.5 g/kg on day one, followed by 1 g/kg on day 3 (5). The 25% albumin solution (25 g/100 mL) is recommended, to limit the infusion volume.

#### **Hepatorenal Syndrome**

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is reported in as many as 50% of patients with decompensated cirrhosis (5). The hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a type of "functional AKI" that occurs without intrinsic renal disease, and its appearance heralds a poor prognosis.

#### *Pathogenesis*

HRS is the result of hemodynamic alterations in the splanchnic and renal circulations. Cirrhosis is associated with splanchnic vasodilation, and the neurohumoral (renin system) response to this vasodilation results in vasoconstriction in other organs, including the kidneys. The renal vasoconstriction creates a situation where the glomerular filtration rate is vulnerable to small decrements in cardiac output. Sepsis enhances the vasodilation from cirrhosis, and HRS is more frequent when cirrhosis is accompanied by sepsis.

#### *Diagnosis*

The diagnostic criteria for HRS are listed in [Table](#page-10-0) 39.4 (29). The criteria include evidence of AKI (i.e., an increase in serum creatinine ≥0.3 mg/dL within 48 hrs) with no other apparent cause (i.e., no circulatory shock or nephrotoxic drugs), and no evidence of intrinsic kidney disease. Urinary indices in HRS are similar to "prerenal" indices (i.e., low sodium and high osmolarity), and these could differentiate HRS from acute tubular necrosis.

#### <span id="page-10-0"></span>**TABLE 39.4 Diagnosis and Management of Hepatorenal Syndrome**

- I. *Diagnostic Criteria:*
  - 1. Cirrhosis with ascites.
  - 2. Increase in SCr of ≥0.3 mg/dL within 48 hrs, or SCr ≥1.5 times baseline.
  - 3. No response to diuretic withdrawal and 2 days of fluid challenges with albumin (1 g/kg/day).
  - 4. No evidence of shock, and no recent use of nephrotoxic drugs.
  - 5. No signs of structural kidney injury:
    - a. Absence of proteinuria (>500 mg/day).
    - b. Absence of hematuria (>50 RBC's per high power field).
    - c. Normal findings on renal ultrasound.
- II. *Management:*
  - 1. Albumin (25%): 20–40 g daily.
  - 2. Splanchnic vasoconstriction with one of the following:
    - a. Terlipressin: 1 mg IV every 4–6 hrs, or infuse at 84 μg/hr (2 mg/day).
    - b. Norepinephrine: 5–40 μg/min by continuous infusion.
    - c. Octreotide (100–200 μg subQ) plus midodrine (7.5–15 mg PO) three times daily.

From Reference 29.

#### *Management*

The management of HRS is included in [Table](#page-10-0) 39.4. Daily doses of albumin are recommended at a dose of 20–40 grams daily, which should be given as a 25% albumin solution (25 grams per 100 mL) to limit the volume infused. The benefits of albumin may not be related to volume, as albumin is also an antioxidant, and has immunomodulating effects (30).

The mainstay of treatment for HRS is to promote splanchnic vasoconstriction and reverse the hemodynamic changes that precipitate the condition. The drug of choice for this is *terlipressin*, a synthetic vasopressin analogue that acts primarily as a splanchnic vasoconstrictor. Clinical studies have shown that terlipressin improves renal function in HRS (31,32), but it does not improve survival or reduce the need for liver transplantation (32). Side effects of terlipressin include abdominal pain, diarrhea, pulmonary edema (hydrostatic), and ischemic events. The drug was approved for use in the United States in 2022.

Alternatives to terlipressin include *norepinephrine*, and the combination of *midodrine and octreotide* (33). (See [Table](#page-10-0) 39.4 for dosing recommendations.) Norepinephrine has been equivalent to terlipressin in clinical trials (34), but the experience is limited, while midodrine plus octreotide is inferior to terlipressin (35), and is limited to use in countries where terlipressin is not available.

#### *Increased Abdominal Pressure*

Increased intra-abdominal pressure is an overlooked cause of AKI in critically ill patients (36), as described in Chapter 34, and it is possible that it could also promote HRS. This is supported by a study showing that large-volume paracentesis (i.e., removal of ≥4 liters of fluid) improved renal function in patients with tense ascites and HRS (37). Therefore, measurement of intra-abdominal pressure is advised for all patients with tense ascites and HRS (see Chapter 34 for the method of measuring intra-abdominal pressure), and large-volume paracentesis is encouraged if the abdominal pressure exceeds 12 cm H2O (29). However, careful hemodynamic monitoring is needed after large-volume paracentesis, to avoid hemodynamic compromise.

#### *Liver Transplantation*

Liver transplantation is the definitive treatment for HRS, and a consultation for liver transplantation should be obtained whenever HRS is diagnosed.

### **A FINAL WORD**

### **The Liver & Bowel Sepsis**

One of the recurring themes in this book is the importance of the bowel as a source of systemic infection and inflammation in critically ill patients (see Chapters 4 and 41). Much of the attention in this area is directed at the breakdown of the mucosal barrier in the bowel, but there is a second line of defense in the event of mucosal breakdown. This is illustrated by the occurrence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with liver failure; an infection that is caused by enteric pathogens that escape across the bowel mucosa. This infection demonstrates the importance of the liver as a second line of defense against microbes that breach the mucosal barrier in the bowel. In fact, about three-quarters of the reticuloendothelial system is located in the abdomen (mostly represented by the liver), where it is positioned to protect against the systemic spread of enteric pathogens.
