# **Potassium**

*No knowledge can be more satisfactory to a man than that of his own frame, its parts, their functions and actions.*

Thomas Jefferson (*[a](#page-11-0)*)

The last chapter introduced the notion that the ocean served as extracellular fluid for the first unicellular organisms. Seawater is essentially a saline solution that is rich in sodium and chloride, and "poor" in potassium, similar to our extracellular fluid. Why there is so little potassium in seawater is not entirely explained, but the paucity of potassium in our extracellular fluid is the consequence of a membrane pump that keeps potassium in cells. About 98% of the total body potassium is located inside cells, and only 2% remains in the extracellular fluid ([1–](#page-11-1)[3\)](#page-11-2). As a result, monitoring the plasma (extracellular) potassium level as an index of total body potassium is like evaluating an iceberg by its tip. With this limitation in mind, this chapter describes the causes and consequences of abnormalities in the plasma potassium concentration.

## **POTASSIUM BASICS**

### **Potassium Distribution**

The intracellular preponderance of potassium is the result of a sodium–potassium (Na+–K+) exchange pump on cell membranes that moves Na+ out of cells and moves K+ into cells in a 3:2 ratio ([1\)](#page-11-1). One of the major roles of this pump is to create a voltage gradient across cell membranes in "excitable" tissues (i.e., nerves and muscle), which allows for the transmission of electrical impulses in these tissues.

The marked difference between intracellular and extracellular K+ is illustrated in [Figure](#page-1-0) 36.1. The total body potassium in healthy adults is about 50–55 mEq per kg body weight ([1\)](#page-11-1). Using the conservative estimate of 50 mg/kg in a 70 kg adult yields a total body potassium of 3,500 mEq, with 70 mEq (2%) in extracellular fluid. Because the plasma accounts for about 20% of the extracellular fluid, the *potassium content of plasma* will be about 15 mEq, which *is only 0.4% of the total body potassium*. This emphasizes the limited size of the K+ pool that is available for evaluating total body K+.

## **Serum Potassium**

The relationship between total body K+ and serum (plasma) K+ is shown in [Figure](#page-2-0) 36.2 ([4,](#page-11-3)[5\)](#page-11-4). Note the curvilinear shape of the curve, with the flat portion of the curve in the region of potassium deficiency. In an average-sized adult with a normal serum K+ of 4 mEq/L, a total body K+ deficit of 200–400 mEq is required to produce a decrease in plasma K+ of 1 mEq/L, while a total body K+ excess of 100–200 mEq is required to produce a similar (1 mEq/L) increase in plasma K+ ([5\)](#page-11-4). Therefore, *for a given change in serum K+, the change in total body K+ is twofold greater with K+ depletion (hypokalemia) than with K+ excess (hyperkalemia)*. The larger K+ deficit associated with hypokalemia is due to the large pool of intracellular K+ that can replenish extracellular K+ (and help to maintain serum K+) when K+ is lost.

**FIGURE 36.1** IIllustration of the marked difference between intracellular and extracellular potassium in a 70 kg adult with an estimated total body potassium of 50 mEq/kg. Each gold bar represents 100 mEq of potassium.

## **Potassium Excretion**

Small amounts of K+ are lost in stool (5–10 mEq/day) and sweat (0–10 mEq/day), but the majority of K+ loss is in urine (40–120 mEq/day, depending on K+ intake) [\(1](#page-11-1)).

#### *Renal Excretion*

Most of the K+ that is filtered at the glomerulus is passively reabsorbed in the proximal tubules (along with sodium and water), and K+ is then secreted in the distal tubules and collecting ducts ([1\)](#page-11-1). Potassium excretion in urine is primarily a function of K+ secretion in the distal nephron, which is controlled by plasma K+ and (primarily by) aldosterone. When renal function is normal, the capacity for renal K+ excretion is great enough to prevent a sustained rise in serum K+ in response to an increased K+ load [\(1](#page-11-1)).

**ALDOSTERONE:** Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid that is released by the adrenal cortex in

response to an increase in plasma K+ (and angiotensin II), and it stimulates K+ secretion in the distal nephron (and hence increases urinary K+ excretion). Potassium secretion in the distal nephron is linked to sodium reabsorption, so aldosterone also promotes sodium and water retention. The diuretic *spironolactone* acts by blocking the actions of aldosterone in the kidneys. As a result, spironolactone is a *potassium-sparing diuretic*.

## **HYPOKALEMIA**

Hypokalemia (serum K+ < 3.5 mEq/L) can be the result of K+ movement into cells (transcellular shift), or K+ depletion from renal and extrarenal losses ([3–](#page-11-2)[6\)](#page-11-5).

## **Transcellular Shift**

The movement of K<sup>+</sup> into cells is facilitated by β<sup>2</sup> -adrenergic receptors on cell membranes in muscle, and this explains the decrease in serum K<sup>+</sup> associated with *inhaled β<sup>2</sup> -agonist bronchodilators* (e.g., albuterol) [\(7](#page-11-6)). This effect is mild (≤0.5 mEq/L) in the usual therapeutic doses ([7\)](#page-11-6), but is more significant when inhaled β<sup>2</sup> -agonists are used in combination with diuretics

([8\)](#page-11-7). Other factors that promote K+ movement into cells include *alkalosis* (respiratory or metabolic), *hypothermia* (accidental or induced), and *insulin*. Alkalosis has a variable and unpredictable effect on serum K+ [\(9](#page-11-8)). Hypothermia causes a transient drop in serum K+ that resolves on rewarming [\(10](#page-11-9)).

### **Potassium Depletion**

Potassium depletion can be the result of K+ loss via the kidneys or gastrointestinal tract. The site of K+ loss (renal or extrarenal) is usually obvious, but can be identified by measuring spot urine potassium and chloride concentrations, as shown in [Figure](#page-3-0) 36.3.

## **Renal Potassium Loss**

The leading cause of renal K+ loss is *diuretic therapy*. Other causes likely to be seen in the ICU include nasogastric drainage, alkalosis, and magnesium depletion. Nasogastric drainage has a low concentration of K+ (10–15 mEq/L), but the resulting loss of volume and H+ promotes K+ loss in the urine. The urine chloride is low (<15 mEq/L) with nasogastric drainage and alkalosis, and it is high (>25 mEq/L) with diuretic therapy and magnesium depletion. *Magnesium depletion* impairs K+ reabsorption in the renal tubules and *may play a very important role in promoting K+ depletion* in critically ill patients, particularly those receiving diuretics [\(11](#page-11-10)).

<span id="page-3-0"></span>![](_page_3_Figure_5.jpeg)

**FIGURE 36.3** Evaluation to identify the site of potassium loss.

### **Extrarenal Potassium Loss**

The major cause of extrarenal K+ loss is *diarrhea*. Normal K+ loss in stool is only 5–10 mEq daily. In secretory and inflammatory diarrhea, the concentration of K+ in stool is 15–40 mEq/L, and the daily stool volume can reach 10 liters in severe cases. Therefore, K+ losses can reach 400 mEq daily in severe cases of inflammatory or secretory diarrhea [\(12](#page-11-11)).

## **Clinical Manifestations**

Severe hypokalemia (serum K+ < 2.5 mEq/L) can be associated with diffuse muscle weakness ([3\)](#page-11-2), but in most cases, hypokalemia is asymptomatic. Abnormalities in the ECG are the major manifestation of hypokalemia, and can be present in 50% of cases ([13\)](#page-11-12). The ECG abnormalities include prominent U waves (more than 1 mm in height), flattening and inversion of T waves, and prolongation of the QT interval. However, these changes are not specific for hypokalemia; i.e., the T wave changes and U waves can be seen with left ventricular hypertrophy, and QT prolongation has a multitude of potential offenders.

#### *Arrhythmias*

Contrary to popular belief, *hypokalemia alone is not a risk for serious arrhythmias* [\(3](#page-11-2)). However, hypokalemia can add to the risk of serious arrhythmias from other conditions (e.g., myocardial ischemia) ([3\)](#page-11-2).

## **Management of Hypokalemia**

The first concern in hypokalemia is to eliminate or treat any condition that promotes transcellular potassium shifts (e.g., alkalosis) ([3\)](#page-11-2). If the hypokalemia is due to K+ depletion, proceed as described next.

### *Estimate Potassium Deficits*

About 10% of total body K+ is lost for every 1 mEq/L decrease in serum K+ [\(13](#page-11-12)). For a 70 kg adult with a normal total body K+ of 50 mEq/kg, the estimated K+ deficits associated with progressive hypokalemia are shown in [Table](#page-4-0) 36.1. Note that even mild hypokalemia (serum K+ = 3 mEq/L) is associated with a considerable K+ deficit (175 mEq).

<sup>†</sup>Estimates based on a lean body weight of 70 kg and a total body K+ of 50 mEq/kg.

## *Potassium Replacement*

**FLUIDS:** The usual replacement fluid is potassium chloride, which is available as a concentrated solution (1–2 mEq/mL) in ampules containing 10, 20, 30, and 40 mEq of potassium. These solutions are *extremely hyperosmotic* (the 2 mEq/mL solution has an osmolarity of 4,000 mosm/L) and *must be diluted* ([14\)](#page-11-13). A potassium phosphate solution is also available that contains 4.5 mEq potassium and 3 mmol phosphate per mL, and is preferred by some for potassium replacement in diabetic ketoacidosis (because of the phosphate depletion that accompanies ketoacidosis).

**RATE OF REPLACEMENT:** The standard method of intravenous K+ replacement is to add 20 mEq of K+ to 100 mL of isotonic saline and infuse over 1 hour [\(15](#page-11-14)). The *maximum rate* of intravenous potassium replacement is usually set at *20 mEq/hr* [\(15](#page-11-14)), but dose rates of 40 mEq/hr may be necessary for severe hypokalemia, and *dose rates as high as 100 mEq/hr have been used safely* (16). Infusion through a large, central vein is preferred, if possible, because of the irritating properties of the hyperosmotic KCL solutions. However, delivery into the superior vena cava is not recommended if the desired rate of replacement exceeds 20 mEq/hr because there is a (poorly documented) risk of producing asystole.

**RESPONSE:** The serum K+ may be slow to correct initially, as predicted by the flat portion of the curve in [Figure](#page-2-0) 36.2. If the hypokalemia is resistant or refractory to K+ replacement, magnesium depletion should be considered. Magnesium depletion promotes urinary K+ loss (as described earlier), and *in patients who are magnesium deficient, hypokalemia is often resistant to K+ replacement until the magnesium is repleted* (17). Magnesium deficiency may play an important role in diuretic-induced hypokalemia, as described in the next chapter.

## **HYPERKALEMIA**

While hypokalemia is often well tolerated, hyperkalemia (serum K+ > 5.5 mEq/L) can be a life threatening condition

## **Mechanisms**

Hyperkalemia can be the result of potassium release from cells (transcellular shift), or impaired renal excretion of potassium. If the source of the hyperkalemia is unclear, a spot urine K+ can be useful, as *a low urine K+ (<30 mEq/L) is evidence of impaired renal excretion* (18). If the hyperkalemia is unexpected, the condition described next should be considered.

## *Factitious Hyperkalemia*

Hyperkalemia can be present *ex vivo* (i.e., in the blood sample), but not *in vivo* (i.e., in the bloodstream) when K+ is released from blood cells that are damaged when the blood specimen is obtained. This *factitious hyperkalemia* (also called "pseudohyperkalemia") usually originates from hemolysis of red blood cells, but platelets can contribute in the setting of thrombocytosis (platelet count >500 × 109/L), and severe leukocytosis can be a factor in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders (19).

The following factors have been identified as contributing to factitious hyperkalemia (19): (*a*) the use of fist-clenching to help identify veins (which can release K+ from skeletal muscle)

(20), (*b*) the use of excessive suction (e.g., with "vacutainers") to withdraw the blood specimen, (*c*) trauma to the specimen during transport in pneumatic tube systems (21), and (*d*) delays in processing the blood specimen.

Factitious hyperkalemia should be suspected when there is no apparent reason for hyperkalemia (the lab is often unable to identify these cases). In this situation, you should draw the blood specimen yourself, with attention to minimizing or avoiding potential contributing factors.

#### *Transcellular Shift:*

The conditions associated with K+ movement out of cells include acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, tumor lysis syndrome, drugs, and blood transfusions.

**ACIDOSIS:** The presumed mechanism for the relationship between acidosis and hyperkalemia is competition between H+ and K+ for the same site on the membrane pump that moves K+ into cells. However, the causal link between acidosis and hyperkalemia is being questioned because lactic acidosis is not associated with hyperkalemia [\(9](#page-11-8)), and respiratory acidosis has an inconsistent association with hyperkalemia [\(9](#page-11-8)).

**TUMOR LYSIS SYNDROME:** Tumor lysis syndrome is an acute, life-threatening condition that appears within 7 days after the initiation of cytotoxic therapy for selected malignancies (e.g., non-Hodgkin lymphoma). Characteristic features include the combination of hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperuricemia, often accompanied by acute kidney injury (22). Hyperkalemia is the most immediate threat to life.

**DRUGS:** The drugs that promote K+ movement out of cells are listed in [Table](#page-6-0) 36.2. Digitalis inhibits the membrane Na+-K+ exchange pump, but hyperkalemia occurs only with acute (not chronic) digitalis toxicity (23). *Succinylcholine* is an ultra short-acting neuromuscular blocking agent that inhibits the membrane Na+–K+ exchange pump (a depolarizing effect). This normally results in a minor increase in potassium (<1 mEq/L) that lasts 5–10 minutes (24), but lifethreatening increases in serum K+ have been reported when succinylcholine is used in patients with spinal cord injury; an effect attributed to "denervation hypersensitivity" to depolarizing agents.

ARBs = angiotensive receptor blockers, TMP-SMX = trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole.

## *Impaired Renal Excretion*

As mentioned earlier, the capacity for urinary K+ excretion is great enough to prevent sustained hyperkalemia after a potassium load [\(1](#page-11-1)). As a result, *hyperkalemia always involves (at least in part) a defect in renal potassium excretion*. This can be the result of renal disease, adrenal insufficiency, or drugs. Adrenal insufficiency impairs renal potassium excretion, but *hyperkalemia is seen only in chronic adrenal insufficiency*.

**DRUGS:** Drugs that impair renal potassium excretion are a common cause of hyperkalemia, and the frequent offenders are listed in [Table](#page-6-0) 36.2 (24–28). All of these agents promote hyperkalemia by inhibiting some part of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. (The exception is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, which directly inhibits potassium secretion in the distal tubules.) Drug-induced hyperkalemia often occurs in combination with K+ supplements or renal insufficiency.

## **Blood Transfusion**

Hyperkalemia is a recognized (but inconsistent) complication of massive blood transfusion (i.e., blood replacement equivalent to the blood volume). The temperature used to store red blood cells (4º C) shuts off the Na+-K+ exchange pump in the erythrocyte cell membrane, and this results in a steady leakage of K+ from the cells (29). The K+ concentration in the supernatant increases steadily as the storage time increases. After 18 days of storage (the average time that blood is stored) the potassium load in one unit of packed red blood cells is 2–3 mEq (29), so massive transfusion (usually at least 6 units of red blood cells) represents a K+ load of at least 12–18 mEq. This is a considerable load, considering that plasma contains about 9–10 mEq of K+ in an average-sized adult.

The potassium load in transfused blood is normally cleared by the kidneys, but when systemic blood flow is compromised (which applies to most patients who need massive blood transfusions), renal K+ excretion is impaired, and the K+ in blood transfusions will accumulate. The transfusion volume needed to produce hyperkalemia will vary, but one study has shown that hyperkalemia begins to appear after transfusion of 7 units of red blood cells (30).

## **Cautopyreiophagia**

In 1985, a case report was published describing a patient with severe hyperkalemia who was discovered to be ingesting 1,500 burnt match heads daily (a pica) (31). It turns out that burnt match heads are rich in potassium chlorate, and the habit of eating burnt match heads is known as *cautopyreiophagia*. This case is mentioned to demonstrate that anything is possible in clinical practice, and that there is a name for everything.

## **Clinical Consequences**

The principal threat with hyperkalemia is slowed impulse transmission in the heart (from depolarization of cardiac muscle), which can progress to heart block and cardiac arrest.

<span id="page-8-0"></span>![](_page_8_Figure_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 36.4** ECG abnormalities in progressive hyperkalemia.

#### *ECG Changes*

The expected ECG changes in progressive hyperkalemia are shown in [Figure](#page-8-0) 36.4. The earliest change is the appearance of a tall, tapering (tented) T wave that is most evident in precordial leads V<sup>2</sup> and V<sup>3</sup> . As the hyperkalemia progresses, the P wave amplitude decreases and the PR interval lengthens. The P waves eventually disappear and the QRS complex widens to produce a complete heart block. The final event is ventricular fibrillation or asystole.

Contrary to popular lore, *there is no predictable relationship between the severity of hyperkalemia and the presence of ECG changes* (32). For example, the traditional teaching has been that ECG changes begin to appear when the serum K+ approaches 6 mEq/L (32), but one clinical study found that only 40% of patients with a serum K+ above 7 mEq/L had ECG changes

(33). Another more extreme example of this is a case report of a patient with a serum K+ of 14 mEq/L who had no ECG changes (34). This lack of correlation between the serum K and the ECG has led to the suggestion that hyperkalemia alone may not be responsible for the ECG changes.

## **Management of Severe Hyperkalemia**

Severe hyperkalemia is defined as a serum K+ > 6.5 mEq/L, or any serum K+ that produces ECG changes (35). The management of this condition has 3 goals (36): (*a*) blocking the effects of hyperkalemia on the cardiac conduction system, (*b*) moving K+ into cells, and (*c*) removing excess K+ from the body. The methods used to achieve these goals are [summarized](#page-9-0) in Table 36.3.

#### *Cardiac Stabilization*

Hyperkalemia has a depolarizing effect on myocardial cell membranes, which closes sodium channels and slows electrical transmission (37). These effects are antagonized by the hyperpolarizing effects of calcium, which is the treatment of choice for the cardiotoxic effects of hyperkalemia.

**REGIMEN:** Calcium is available in two intravenous preparations: *10% calcium gluconate*, which contains 9 mg/mL of elemental calcium in a 10 mL ampule, and *10% calcium chloride*, which contains 27 mg/mL of elemental calcium in a 10 mL ampule. Therefore, the calcium chloride preparation delivers three times more calcium than the calcium gluconate preparation. The less concentrated gluconate preparation is used in most instances, while the calcium chloride is reserved for cases of cardiovascular collapse or cardiac arrest.

The calcium regimen is shown in [Table](#page-9-0) 36.3. The calcium effect should be evident after a few minutes. However, the effect dissipates in 30–60 minutes, so the other [interventions](#page-9-0) in Table 36.3 should be combined with the calcium treatment.

**INDICATIONS:** The published indications for calcium include a serum K+ > 6.5 mEq/L (with or without ECG changes), and ECG changes (regardless of the serum K+) (35). However, some prefer to use calcium only when there are appropriate ECG changes; a strategy that seems appropriate, given the poor correlation between the serum K+ level and the risk of ECG changes.

**DIGITALIS**: Calcium has traditionally been contraindicated for managing the hyperkalemia associated with digitalis toxicity (because digitalis toxicity poisons the membrane pump, which leads to life-threatening calcium accumulation in cells). However, retrospective studies have revealed numerous instances where intravenous calcium was given to patients with digitalis toxicity, without harm (38).

#### **Moving Potassium Into Cells**

There are three methods that are used to move K<sup>+</sup> into cells.

**INSULIN-DEXTROSE**: Insulin drives K<sup>+</sup> into skeletal muscle cells by activating the membrane Na<sup>+</sup>– K<sup>+</sup> exchange pump, and the insulin-dextrose regimen in Table 36.3 will decrease the serum K<sup>+</sup> by at least 0.6 mEq/L (35). However, this effect is temporary (peak effect at 30–60 min), so measures that promote K<sup>+</sup> elimination should be started as well.

**β<sub>2</sub>-AGONISTS**: Inhaled β<sub>2</sub>-agonists (e.g., albuterol) produce a small decrease in plasma  $K^+$  (<0.5 mEq/L) in therapeutic doses (7). The dose needed to produce a significant (0.5–1 mEq/L) drop in serum  $K^+$  is at least 4 times the therapeutic dose (35), and this can produce unwanted side effects (e.g., tachycardia). Despite this risk, inhaled β<sub>2</sub>-agonists have become part of the standard management protocol for severe hyperkalemia in many emergency departments. However, these agents should never be used alone to manage severe hyperkalemia.

**SODIUM BICARBONATE**: Sodium bicarbonate has been used to move  $K^+$  into cells by promoting alkalosis, but there are two reasons why bicarbonate is not advised in this setting: (*a*) short-term infusions of sodium bicarbonate (up to four hours) have no effect on serum  $K^+$  levels in the absence of a metabolic acidosis (35) and (*b*) bicarbonate can form complexes with calcium, which is counterproductive when calcium is used to antagonize the effects of hyperkalemia.

#### **Eliminating Excess Potassium**

Excess K<sup>+</sup> can be removed via the bowel using cation (Na-K) exchange resins, or it can be removed directly from the bloodstream with hemodialysis.

**CATION EXCHANGE RESINS:** Sodium polystyrene sulfonate or SPS (Kayexalate®) is the original cation exchange resin approved for use in severe hyperkalemia. It can be given orally (as a slurry) in a dose of 15 g every 6 hours, or rectally (as a retention enema) in a dose of 30–50 g every 6 hours. Although once the standard of care for severe hyperkalemia, the use of this agent is questioned because of uncertain efficacy, slow onset of action, and reports of necrotic lesions in the bowel linked to its use (39).

Another cation exchange resin, *sodium zirconium cyclosilicate* or SZC (Lokelma®) has been effective in managing hyperkalemia in outpatients (40) and recently has been shown to be equivalent to SPS for acute management of hyperkalemia (41). The SCZ resin does not have the adverse risks associated with SPS, and seems to be the favored choice at the present time. The dose is 10 grams orally, given 3 times daily for 48 hours (then the dose is reduced as needed). A clinically significant effect is reported after one hour (40).

**HEMODIALYSIS**: The most effective method of potassium removal is hemodialysis, which can

produce a 1 mEq/L drop in serum K+ after one hour, and a 2 mEq/L drop after 3 hours (35).

## **A FINAL WORD**

## **Tip of the Iceberg**

Considering that only 2% of the potassium in the body is outside cells, and that only 20% of the extracellular potassium is in plasma, monitoring the plasma K+ gives us information about <1% of the potassium in the body. That might explain why hypokalemia is often clinically silent, and why there is a poor correlation between the severity of hyperkalemia and the presence of ECG changes.

That said, there are a few points in this chapter that deserve emphasis:

- 1. Hypokalemia is not a risk for serious arrhythmias unless combined with a drug or clinical condition that can trigger arrhythmias ([3\)](#page-11-2).
- 2. When hypokalemia is refractory to K+ replacement, Mg++ deficiency is likely the source of the problem (17).
- 3. When using calcium to antagonize the cardiac effects of hyperkalemia, make sure you know which preparation you are using (calcium gluconate or calcium chloride), since calcium chloride has three times more elemental calcium than calcium gluconate.
