# **Approaches to Clinical Shock**

*Shock is the rude unhinging of the machinery of life.*

Samuel Gross, MD (*[a](#page-18-0)*)

One of the recognizable features of the clinical condition known as "shock" is its name, which lacks any scientific or pathological merit, and is shared by nonclinical entities as far-removed as military operations ("shock and awe"). The clinical use of this term can be traced back to 1731, when a French surgeon named Henri LeDran published his experience with gunshot wounds, and used the term "chock" to describe the injuries that often had fatal outcomes [\(1](#page-18-1)). In a subsequent English translation of LeDran's account, "shock" was mistranslated as indicating the clinical course of the injuries rather than the injuries themselves. Thereafter, "clinical" shock became synonymous with a life-threatening and rapidly deteriorating condition. However, shock is a consequence of multiple pathological entities, and finding a common ground can be challenging.

This chapter is the first in a series of chapters devoted to clinical shock, and attempts to present a unified view of shock, including what it is, how it is classified, how it presents, and how it is managed. This is followed by three chapters devoted to the major shock syndromes: i.e., hypovolemic, cardiogenic, and septic shock. Simply stated, these conditions are the most challenging you will encounter in the ICU.

## **WHAT IS CLINICAL SHOCK?**

The definition of clinical shock has had many iterations, including the colorful description in the introductory quote by Samuel Gross, one of the titans of surgery in the 19th century who included this description of shock in his popular textbook (*a*). An updated and improved definition of shock would state that *shock is a life-threatening circulatory disorder that is characterized by inadequate cellular oxygen utilization* ([2\)](#page-18-2). Shock can be the result of inadequate tissue oxygenation, or inadequate processing of oxygen by mitochondria, but the result is the same; i.e., there is a deficiency in oxidative ATP production. The clinical consequence of this derangement is dysfunction in one or more vital organs, which can progress to multiorgan failure and a fatal outcome.

### **Clinical Features**

The clinical manifestations of shock typically include the following:

- 1. A decrease in blood pressure, which typically results in *hypotension*, defined as a systolic pressure <90 mm Hg or a mean pressure <70 mm Hg ([2\)](#page-18-2). (See the next section for more on hypotension in clinical shock.)
- 2. An increase in the plasma lactate level (>2 mmol/L), which is considered evidence of impaired cellular O<sup>2</sup> utilization (although other explanations are available, as described in Chapter 9.)
- 3. Clinical signs of organ dysfunction, which usually begins as *oliguria* (urine output <0.5 mL/kg per hour) and *altered mentation* (e.g., agitation, confusion, or depressed consciousness), and can progress to involve any and all major organs.
- 4. In cases of "low-flow shock", the skin may be cool to touch, and there may be cyanotic changes in the distal extremities. Progression of the low-flow state can produce patchy cyanosis known as "mottled skin" or *livedo reticularis*.

#### *Hypotension*

Hypotension has been one of the standard clinical criteria for the diagnosis of clinical shock, but the reliability of hypotension as a marker of clinical shock is questionable, For example, clinical studies have shown that the blood pressure can be normal when there is evidence of inadequate tissue oxygenation (using lactate levels or the central venous O<sup>2</sup> saturation) [\(3](#page-18-3)). Furthermore (as anyone who has spent some time in an ICU can verify), hypotension is not always accompanied by evidence of inadequate O<sup>2</sup> utilization in tissues. As a result of observations like these, some consensus guidelines have recommended that hypotension should be abandoned as a marker of clinical shock [\(4](#page-18-4)).

## **Types of Shock**

There are 4 different types of shock (shock syndromes), and these can be identified using the following hydraulic relationships: i.e., steady flow (Q) through a closed hydraulic circuit is directly related to the pressure gradient across the circuit (Pin – Pout), and is inversely related to the resistance to flow (R) through the circuit.

<span id="page-1-0"></span>
$$Q = (Pin - Pout)/R$$
 (14.1)

If the hydraulic circuit is the circulatory system, then flow is the cardiac output (CO), the inflow pressure is the mean arterial pressure (MAP), the outflow pressure is the right atrial pressure (RAP), and the resistance to flow is the systemic vascular [resistance](#page-1-0) (SVR). Equation 14.1 is now expressed as follows:

$$CO = (MAP - RAP)/SVR$$
 (14.2)

Since a decrease in blood pressure is commonplace in shock, the terms in the above equation can be rearranged to identify the determinants of mean arterial pressure (which is the driving pressure for blood flow):

$$MAP = (CO \times SVR) + RAP \tag{14.3}$$

The different shock syndromes are then identified by the determinants of MAP: i.e.,

- a. Low RAP = hypovolemic shock
- b. Low CO = cardiogenic shock, obstructive shock
- c. Low SVR = vasodilatory shock

The pattern of hemodynamic changes in each type of shock is shown in [Table](#page-2-0) 14.1, along with the reported prevalence of each ([2\)](#page-18-2). Note that 3 of the 4 shock syndromes are associated with a low cardiac output and a high SVR. The increase in SVR (i.e., vasoconstriction) is a compensatory response to the low-flow state, and limits the drop in blood pressure. This response is due to increased activity in the sympathetic nervous system, and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

<sup>†</sup>Numbers in parentheses indicate relative frequency of occurrence (from Reference 2). CVP = central venous pressure, SVR = systemic vascular resistance.

### *Hypovolemic Shock*

Hypovolemic shock is almost always the result of blood loss, and it usually appears when the decrease in blood volume exceeds 30% [\(5](#page-18-5)). Dehydration (e.g., from vomiting or diarrhea) does not typically result in shock because the fluid loss leads to an increase in the colloid osmotic pressure of plasma, which draws interstitial fluid into the vascular compartment. Decreases in blood pressure from dehydration are easily corrected with intravenous fluids.

### *Cardiogenic Shock*

Shock from cardiac pump failure is most often the result of acute coronary syndromes, which account for almost half of the cases of cardiogenic shock ([6\)](#page-18-6). Less frequent causes include nonischemic cardiomyopathies (28% of cases) and valvular dysfunction or arrhythmias (17% of cases). Cardiogenic shock presents the greatest challenge in shock management; i.e., despite advances in revascularization and mechanical cardiac support, the mortality rate remains at about 50% ([7\)](#page-18-7).

#### *Obstructive Shock*

Obstructive shock is caused by conditions that impede or block cardiac filling, such as massive pulmonary embolism, tension pneumothorax, and cardiac tamponade. This condition is

uncommon, and accounts for only 2% of cases of clinical shock ([2\)](#page-18-2). Treatment is directed at the responsible condition.

### *Vasodilatory Shock*

Vasodilatory shock (also known as "distributive shock") is a condition of widespread vasodilation involving both arteries and veins. It is the most frequently encountered type of shock (see [Table](#page-2-0) 14.1), and septic shock accounts for most cases. *Septic shock is the leading cause of in-hospital deaths in the United States ([8\)](#page-18-8), and is also considered the leading cause of death worldwide* ([9\)](#page-18-9). Less common sources of vasodilatory shock include anaphylactic shock, spinal shock, and adrenal crisis.

## **BLOOD PRESSURE MONITORING**

Blood pressure monitoring is mandatory in clinical shock, and direct intra-arterial recordings are preferred.

### **Direct Recordings**

Direct arterial pressure recordings are obtained from the radial, brachial, axillary, or femoral arteries, and the site of cannulation can influence the recorded waveform (see next) .

### *Arterial Pressure Waveform*

The arterial pressure waveform changes as it moves away from the proximal aorta, as shown in [Figure](#page-4-0) 14.1. Note that as the pressure wave moves toward the periphery, the systolic pressure gradually increases and the systolic portion of the waveform narrows. The systolic pressure can increase as much as 20 mm Hg from the proximal aorta to the radial or femoral arteries ([10\)](#page-18-10). This increase in peak systolic pressure is offset by the narrowing of the systolic pressure wave, so the mean arterial pressure remains unchanged.

### *Systolic Amplification*

The increase in systolic pressure in peripheral arteries is the result of pressure waves that are reflected back from vascular bifurcations and narrowed blood vessels ([11\)](#page-18-11). Reflected waves move faster when the arteries are stiff, and they reach the arterial pressure waveform before it has time to decrement. The convergence of antegrade and retrograde pressure waves then serves to heighten the peak of the pressure waveform. (You can see this effect when ocean waves meet from opposing direction. This magnification effect is implicated in the formation of "monster waves".) Because systolic amplification is the result of retrograde pressure waves, it increases left ventricular afterload, but does not promote systemic blood flow.

### *Mean Arterial Pressure*

*The mean arterial pressure (MAP) is the preferred pressure for hemodynamic monitoring* for two reasons: it is the principal driving force for systemic blood flow ([10,](#page-18-10)[12\)](#page-18-12), and it does not change as the pressure waveform moves peripherally (unlike the systolic pressure). The MAP is measured electronically as the area under the arterial pressure wave, divided by the duration of the cardiac cycle. *The management of clinical shock typically uses a target MAP of ≥65 mm Hg*

**FIGURE 14.1** Arterial pressure waveforms at specific points in the arterial circulation.

### **Indirect Measurements**

Direct blood pressure recordings are not always available, or feasible, and a brief description of indirect pressure measurements is therefore warranted.

### *The Principle*

The indirect blood pressure (BP) measurement uses an inflatable bladder (attached to the underside of a cloth sleeve) that is wrapped around the upper arm or thigh in an area that overlies a major artery. The bladder in the sleeve is then inflated to compress the underlying artery. The effects of arterial compression are illustrated in [Figure](#page-5-0) 14.2. As the cuff pressure increases and the underlying artery is compressed, the pulsations in the artery gradually increase and then decrease until the artery is occluded. These "counterpulsations" produce oscillations in the bladder pressure, and the automated blood pressure devices (which are standard in ICUs) then measure these oscillations and convert them into measures of systolic, diastolic, and mean pressures. This is the *oscillometric method* of measuring the BP. The counterpulsations can also be converted into sound waves, which is the basis for the older *auscultation method* of measuring the BP.

### *Common Source of Error*

Counterpulsations are more reproducible, and BP measurements are more reliable, when an

artery is compressed uniformly. Uniform compression is more likely if the size of the bladder is appropriate for the circumference of the upper arm. The optimal relationships between the height and width of the cuff bladder and the upper arm circumference are shown in [Figure](#page-6-0) 14.3. The following are some important points about the relationship between bladder size and arm size:

<span id="page-5-0"></span>![](_page_5_Figure_1.jpeg)

**FIGURE 14.2** The oscillometric and auscultatory methods of measuring the blood pressure. See text for explanation.

- 1. To produce uniform arterial occlusion, the length of the inflatable bladder should be at least 80% of the circumference of the upper arm (measured midway between the shoulder and elbow), and the width of the bladder should be at least 40% of the upper arm circumference ([13\)](#page-18-13).
- 2. If the inflatable bladder is too small for the size of the upper arm, the pressure measurements will be falsely elevated [\(1](#page-18-1)). (Errors in measurement are much less pronounced when the bladder is too large relative to arm circumference.)
- 3. *The use of inappropriately-sized arm cuffs (and their inflatable bladders) is the most common source of error in indirect BP measurements* ([13,](#page-18-13)[14\)](#page-18-14). In one study involving ICU patients, two-thirds of the indirect BP measurements were obtained with a cuff size that was inappropriate, and in these cases, 62% of the BP measurements differed from the direct, intraarterial measurements by more than 10 mm Hg ([14\)](#page-18-14).

**FIGURE 14.3** Optimal relationships between the height (H) and width (W) of the cuff bladder and the circumference (C) of the upper arm.

To help in selecting the appropriate cuff size, [Table](#page-6-1) 14.2 shows the recommended cuff sizes for different sizes of the upper arm (or thigh). An easier way to determine the appropriate cuff size is described next.

| 45 to 52 cm             | Adult Thigh         | 16 x 42 cm |

From Reference 13.

### *Simple Method for Assessing Cuff Size*

Align the cuff so that the long axis runs along the long axis of the arm. Then turn the cuff over so the bladder on the underside of the cuff is facing upward, and wrap the cuff around the upper arm. The bladder (width) should encircle close to half (40%) of the upper arm. If the bladder encircles less than half of the upper arm, the cuff is too small, and a larger cuff should be used. No change in cuff size is needed if the bladder is too big (i.e., if it encircles most of the upper arm), because this discrepancy does not produce significant errors in measurement [\(13](#page-18-13)).

#### *Accuracy*

The limited accuracy of indirect BP measurements in critically ill patients is well documented ([14,](#page-18-14)[15\)](#page-18-15). This is demonstrated in a recent meta-analysis of 7 studies comparing automated and direct BP measurements in ICU patients ([15\)](#page-18-15), which showed that the automated BP measurement could differ from the direct BP by as much as 55 mm Hg (from –15 mm Hg to +40 mm Hg) in individual patients. This is an unacceptable range of variation, and it demonstrates the need for

#### TISSUE PERFUSION AND OXYGENATION

The approach to shock requires more than blood pressure monitoring, as measures of tissue perfusion and oxygenation are essential for both the detection and management of shock. These measures are shown in Table 14.3, along with the threshold value of each that indicates possible or probable shock. Each of these measures has been described elsewhere in the book, and the following represents only a brief summary.

#### **Oxygen Transport Parameters**

There are three measures of systemic oxygen transport: oxygen delivery ( $DO_2$ ), oxygen uptake ( $VO_2$ ), and oxygen extraction ( $VO_2/DO_2$ ). These measures, which are described in detail in Chapter 9, provide an assessment of the global balance between  $O_2$  supply and  $O_2$  demand, which is deranged in all forms of shock.

#### Cardiac Index

Oxygen transport is dependent on the cardiac output, which is most accurately measured by the thermodilution technique using pulmonary artery catheters (see Chapter 8). Alternative methods include the stroke volume determination from arterial pressure waveforms (see Figure 11.5) or measurements of aortic flow velocity using Doppler ultrasound. (These are described in Chapter 11.) The stroke volume is multiplied by the heart rate to obtain the cardiac output.

As explained in Chapter 8, hemodynamic measurements are typically expressed in relation to body size using the body surface area in meters squared. The size-adjusted cardiac output is called the *cardiac index* (CI), and the normal range is 2.4–4 L/min/m<sup>2</sup> (see Table 8.1). A subnormal CI (<2.5 L/min/m<sup>2</sup>) is considered evidence of inadequate tissue perfusion.

#### Oxygen Delivery

The rate of oxygen delivery in arterial blood ( $DO_2$ ) is derived as the product of the cardiac index (CI) and the oxygen concentration in arterial blood ( $CaO_2$ ); i.e.,

$$DO_2 = CI \times CaO_2 \tag{14.4}$$

(For a more detailed expression of this equation, see Equation 9.8.) A decrease in  $O_2$  delivery is the culprit in three of the four types of clinical shock (i.e., hypovolemic, cardiogenic, and obstructive shock). The  $DO_2$  is normally 520–600 mL/min/m<sup>2</sup> (see Table 9.2), and a  $DO_2$  of 300 mL/min/m<sup>2</sup> has been identified as the threshold for inadequate tissue oxygenation (16). However this is not a consistent finding, and some studies have not been able to identify a  $DO_2$  that impairs aerobic metabolism (17).

#### Oxygen Uptake

The rate of oxygen uptake into tissues ( $VO_2$ ), which is equivalent to the  $O_2$  consumption, is calculated as the product of the cardiac index and the difference in  $O_2$  concentration between

arterial and venous blood (CaO<sup>2</sup> – CvO<sup>2</sup> ); i.e.,

$$VO_2 = CO \times (CaO_2 - CvO_2)$$
 (14.5)

(For a more detailed expression of this equation, see Equation 9.10.) The VO<sup>2</sup> is normally 110– 160 mL/min/m2, and an abnormally low VO<sup>2</sup> (<110 mL/min/m2) is evidence of impaired O<sup>2</sup> utilization (in the absence of aerobic hypometabolism, which is uncommon in critically ill patients).

### *Oxygen Extraction*

Oxygen extraction is the ratio of O<sup>2</sup> uptake to O<sup>2</sup> delivery, which identifies the fraction of delivered oxygen that is taken up into the tissues.

<span id="page-8-1"></span><span id="page-8-0"></span>
$$O_2$$
 Extraction =  $VO_2/DO_2$  (14.6)

When the arterial O<sup>2</sup> saturation is close to 100%, [Equation](#page-8-0) 14.6 can be reduced to variables that are easily monitored; i.e.,

$$O_2$$
 Extraction =  $(SaO_2 - ScvO_2)$  (14.7)

where SaO<sup>2</sup> and ScvO<sup>2</sup> are the arterial and central venous O<sup>2</sup> saturations, respectively. (For the derivation of this equation, see Equations 9.12–9.14.) This expresses the O<sup>2</sup> extraction as the extent of hemoglobin desaturation as blood flows through the capillaries.

The O<sup>2</sup> extraction is normally 0.2–0.3 (20–30%), and it can increase to about 0.5 (50%) in response to a decrease in DO<sup>2</sup> , which helps to keep the VO<sup>2</sup> constant (see Figure 9.3). Further decreases in DO<sup>2</sup> beyond this point will not elicit the compensatory increase in O<sup>2</sup> extraction, and the VO<sup>2</sup> will begin to fall (indicating the onset of anaerobic metabolism). Therefore, an O<sup>2</sup> extraction of ≥50% indicates that O<sup>2</sup> delivery is low enough to threaten, or impair, aerobic metabolism ([18\)](#page-18-18). There are also conditions that impair O<sup>2</sup> extraction (e.g., sepsis, liver failure), and these conditions can be identified by an O<sup>2</sup> extraction that is fixed (i.e., does not increase in response to a decrease in DO<sup>2</sup> ), or is ≤20%. In this situation, the O<sup>2</sup> extraction is not a reliable indicator of changes in O<sup>2</sup> delivery.

### *Central Venous O<sup>2</sup> Saturation*

When the SaO<sup>2</sup> is constant, or is close to 1.0 (100%), [Equation](#page-8-1) 14.7 can be rewritten as:

$$O_2$$
 Extraction =  $(1 - ScvO_2)$  (14.8)

Thus, the central venous O<sup>2</sup> saturation (ScvO<sup>2</sup> ) can be used alone to monitor O<sup>2</sup> extraction [\(19](#page-18-19)). The normal ScvO<sup>2</sup> is about 65–75%, and an increase in O<sup>2</sup> extraction will drop the ScvO<sup>2</sup> below this range. The maximal O<sup>2</sup> extraction (about 50%) corresponds to an ScvO<sup>2</sup> of about 50%, and thus an ScvO<sup>2</sup> of ≤50% can be used as a marker of threatened or impaired tissue oxygenation ([20\)](#page-18-20).

At the other end of the spectrum, an  $ScvO_2$  that is abnormally high ( $\geq 80\%$ ) is evidence of impaired tissue  $O_2$  extraction, which is a characteristic feature of septic shock. In this situation, the  $ScvO_2$  can also be fixed (i.e., does not vary with changes on  $O_2$  delivery), and if this occurs, the  $ScvO_2$  is not a reliable indicator of changes in  $O_2$  delivery. Enter the  $PCO_2$  gap (see next).

<sup>†</sup>Present in all forms of shock.

## The PCO<sub>2</sub> Gap

The venoarterial  $PCO_2$  difference, also known as the  $PCO_2$  gap, is an indirect measure of  $CO_2$  washout from tissues (i.e., tissue perfusion). The  $PCO_2$  gap is normally 2–5 mm Hg (0.3–0.7 kPa), and an increase in the gap to >6 mm Hg (>0.8 kPa) is evidence of tissue hypoperfusion (21). Unlike the  $ScvO_2$ , the  $PCO_2$  gap is dependent only on tissue perfusion, and it provides no information about systemic oxygenation. The  $PCO_2$  gap is easily obtained, and should be monitored in all patients with shock, especially those with low-flow shock (hypovolemic, cardiogenic, and obstructive shock). It can also be useful for detecting a low-flow state in septic shock, which is usually seen in advanced cases. (*Caveat*: A metabolic acidosis can increase the  $PCO_2$  gap. This is the result of an increase in nonmetabolic  $CO_2$  production, and it could be misinterpreted as evidence of tissue hypoperfusion. When a metabolic acidosis is present, only a normal  $PCO_2$  gap has relevance.)

#### **Plasma Lactate**

The plasma lactate level is considered one of the most important measures in clinical shock, and has both diagnostic and prognostic applications. As mentioned earlier, a plasma lactate >2 mmol/L is considered evidence of inadequate cellular  $O_2$  utilization, in the absence of conditions known to cause "aerobic hyperlactatemia" (see Table 9.5). If shock is the cause of an elevated

lactate level, then failure to normalize the level within 24 hours has negative implications for a satisfactory outcome (see Figure 9.4). (The plasma lactate level is described in detail in Chapter 9.)

## **GENERAL MANAGEMENT**

The management of clinical shock has two components: treating the condition responsible for the shock, and generalized hemodynamic management. The latter component is the focus here.

### **Volume Resuscitation**

The infusion of intravenous fluids is the very first step in the management of shock, regardless of the type of shock. (This may seem counterproductive in cardiogenic shock, but cardiac filling pressures are often suboptimal in acute heart failure, especially when it involves the right side of the heart.) Crystalloid fluids are preferred, even though about 75% of infused crystalloid fluids expand the interstitial volume, not the plasma volume (see Chapter 11).

### *Infused Volume*

The initial infusion volume can depend on several variables (e.g., type of shock, type of patient). For the most common shock syndrome (septic shock), the recommended resuscitation volume is ≥30 mL/kg, using *ideal body weight,* in the first 3 hours ([22\)](#page-18-22). The minimum infusion volume for a 70 kg adult would then be about 2 liters, and for a crystalloid fluid, this means about 500 mL (25%) will be added to the plasma volume, and the remaining 1.5 liters (75%) will contribute to edema formation. This increment in plasma volume represents about 15% of the plasma volume for a 70 kg adult male (whose plasma volume is about 40 mL/kg), which seems reasonable if you consider that a 15% drop in blood volume is the threshold for producing symptoms (see next chapter). However, this "one size fits all" approach may not be suitable for adults of varying body size, and for females (whose plasma volume is lower than in males). The following are some recommendations for the initial fluid resuscitation:

- 1. The initial resuscitation volume should take into account the type of shock (if known) and the type of patient (e.g., body size and gender), and should probably should not exceed 2 liters (crystalloid fluid) over 1–2 hours.
- 2. The immediate goal is restoration of the baseline blood pressure.
- 3. If the blood pressure goal is not achieved and there is other evidence of circulatory compromise (e.g., low urine output, mental status change, or elevated lactate level), then infusion of a vasoconstrictor agent (vasopressor) should be initiated.
- 4. Volume resuscitation beyond the initial period should be guided by the assessment of fluid responsiveness (described in Chapter 11).

## **Vasopressor Infusions**

The first issue that surfaces for vasopressor infusions is the traditional recommendation that vasopressor agents should be infused through a central venous catheter (to minimize the risk of drug extravasation and tissue necrosis). This is a source of angst when the vasopressor infusion is

an immediate need and there is no indwelling central line. Fortunately, at least 16 clinical studies have shown that vasopressors can be infused safely through peripheral catheters (in the upper arm) for up to 48 hours [\(23](#page-18-23)), and vasopressor infusions through midline catheters have continued for 7 days without incident ([24\)](#page-18-24). If there is a problem securing a free-flowing peripheral catheter, then insertion of an intraosseous catheter will provide a temporary fix (see Chapter 1).

### *Drug Extravasation*

Extravasation of a vasoconstrictor drug should be managed as follows:

- 1. When extravasation is first evident, stop the infusion immediately, disconnect the IV line and attach it to a syringe and gently aspirate the remaining solution in the catheter and whatever extravasated fluid can be retrieved. Then remove the catheter. Do not flush the line prior to removal.
- 2. The drug that is used in this situation is phentolamine, a long-acting alpha blocker. The dose is 5–10 mg in 10 mL isotonic saline, which is injected directly into the area of extravasation (25). If there is skin blanching (from the local vasoconstriction), it should disappear almost immediately.
- 3. Phentolamine must be used within 12 hours of the event to be successful.

### *Target Blood Pressure*

The consensus recommendation is that vasopressor infusions should be titrated to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of at least 65 mm Hg [\(2](#page-18-2)[,4](#page-18-4)[,22](#page-18-22)), which is the minimum pressure needed to maintain cerebral autoregulation (the process that maintains cerebral blood flow in the face of declining blood pressures) (26). The concern that a higher target pressure might be necessary in patients with longstanding hypertension has not been validated in clinical studies (27).

## **VASOPRESSOR AGENTS**

A variety of vasopressors are available, and are used primarily in vasodilatory (septic) shock. Most are catecholamines that promote vasoconstriction by stimulating α<sup>1</sup> -type adrenergic receptors. The vasopressors that are currently available are listed in [Table](#page-12-0) 14.4, along with the dose range for each agent. These agents are given by continuous infusion (without a loading dose), starting at a low dose and titrating upward as needed. Resistance to high doses of a vasopressor usually prompts the addition of a second agent, although there is no evidence of a survival benefit from this practice (see A FINAL WORD at the end of the chapter).

## **Norepinephrine**

Norepinephrine is the most widely used vasopressor, and is the preferred vasopressor in septic shock ([22,](#page-18-22)28). Its principal action is α<sup>1</sup> -receptor-mediated vasoconstriction, but it is also is a weak β-receptor agonist, which produces some degree of cardiac stimulation. This might explain why the vasoconstriction from norepinephrine (in the usual doses) does not impair renal function (29).

### *Dosing Regimen*

Norepinephrine infusions are usually started at a rate of 5–10 μg/min, which is titrated upward as needed. The β-receptor stimulation can increase the cardiac output in the low-dose range (<10 μg/min), while vasoconstriction from α-receptor stimulation begins to predominate at dose rates above 10 μg/min. When the dose reaches 30 μg/min, further increases are unlikely to produce more of a vasoconstrictor response, and a second vasopressor can be added at this point.

### *Adverse Effects*

Serious adverse events related to norepinephrine infusions include ischemic events (myocardial, cerebral, or limb ischemia) and troublesome arrhythmias (tachycardias and bradycardia). These have been reported in about 10% of patients (30), but it is possible that many of these complications are the result of the shock, and not the vasopressor.

**IMMUNOSUPPRESSION:** There is evidence that leukocyte activation by bacterial products (which is an important part of the immune response) is suppressed during norepinephrine infusions (31). This is attributed to the binding of norepinephrine to adrenergic receptors on the surface of leukocytes, and it raises the possibility that norepinephrine acts as an immunosuppressant, and increases the risk of infection. The clinical significance of this is unclear, but the ironic significance is quite clear, considering the popularity of norepinephrine for treating septic shock.

### **Epinephrine**

Epinephrine is a potent β-receptor agonist that produces dose-dependent increases in heart rate, stroke volume, and blood pressure (32). It has an important role in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (see Chapter 21), and in the resuscitation of anaphylactic shock (see Chapter 17), but it is a second-line vasopressor in septic shock, and is reserved for cases where hypotension is refractory

to norepinephrine.

### *Dosing Regimen*

The recommended doses for epinephrine in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and anaphylactic shock are presented in Chapters 21 and 17, respectively. For septic shock, epinephrine is given as a continuous infusion with no loading dose, starting at 0.1 µg/kg/min and titrating upward, as needed. The maximum dose is 0.5 µg/kg/min (27).

### *Adverse Effects*

The adverse effects of epinephrine include unwanted cardiac stimulation (i.e., tachycardia and arrhythmias), and splanchnic hypoperfusion from α-mediated vasoconstriction (33), which can damage the mucosal barrier in the bowel. Epinephrine also has undesirable metabolic effects, including an increase in metabolic rate (which is counterproductive in a shock syndrome), hyperglycemia (from α-receptor-mediated inhibition of insulin secretion), and an increase in plasma lactate levels (due to an increase in aerobic lactate production) (34). The increase in lactate levels can be misleading in shock syndromes.

### **Dopamine**

Dopamine is an endogenous catecholamine that serves as a precursor for norepinephrine. It was once the preferred vasopressor in septic shock, but its tendency to produce troublesome tachycardia and arrhythmias led to a fall from grace. Dopamine has a variety of dose-dependent effects (35):

- 1. At low infusion rates (≤3 μg/kg/min), dopamine selectively activates dopamine-specific receptors in the renal and splanchnic circulations, resulting in increased blood flow in these regions.
- 2. At moderate infusion rates (3–10 μg/kg/min), dopamine stimulates β-receptors in the heart and peripheral circulation, producing an increase in cardiac stroke output.
- 3. At high infusion rates (>10 μg/kg/min), dopamine produces a dose-dependent activation of αreceptors in the peripheral circulation, resulting in progressive vasoconstriction and an increase in systemic vascular resistance. This vasopressor effect increases ventricular afterload, and can reverse the stroke volume augmentation produced by lower doses of dopamine.

### *Dosing Regimen*

Dopamine is usually started at a dose of 5 μg/kg/min, and is titrated upward as needed. A dose of 5–10 μg/kg/min will usually increase the cardiac output, but a higher dose (>10 μg/kg/min) may be needed to increase the blood pressure. The benefits of dopamine are usually seen at dose rates of 5–20 μg/kg/min, but dose rates of 50 μg/kg/min and even higher have been reported (35).

#### *Adverse Effects*

The major risk with dopamine is tachycardia and troublesome tachyarrhythmias (e.g., atrial fibrillation), which occur more frequently with dopamine than with the other vasopressors (36). As mentioned, this risk has resulted in a marked decline in the popularity of dopamine for both cardiogenic and septic shock. Another risk with dopamine that deserves mention is increased

intraocular pressure, which has been reported at low dose rates (1–4 μg/kg/min) (37).

## **Phenylephrine**

Phenylephrine in a pure α-receptor agonist that produces widespread vasoconstriction, which can be accompanied by bradycardia, a decrease in cardiac stroke output (usually in patients with cardiac dysfunction), and hypoperfusion of the kidneys and bowel. The principal use of phenylephrine is for hypotension produced by anesthesia (spinal or general), where it is often given in bolus doses. Phenylephrine is not recommended for any of the shock syndromes ([22,](#page-18-22)38), although a clinical study comparing phenylephrine and norepinephrine in septic shock showed no difference in hemodynamic effects or clinical outcomes with either drug (39). In the ICU, phenylephrine is useful for managing septic shock in patients with rapid atrial fibrillation (author's observation).

### *Dosing Regimens*

- 1. For treating hypotension during anesthesia, phenylephrine can be given as a bolus dose of 50– 100 μg, which can be repeated once after a few minutes, if needed. If the hypotension is not relieved, then a continuous infusion of the drug is recommended, starting at a dose rate of 10– 35 μg/min and titrating upward. The maximum recommended dose is 200 μg/min (38).
- 2. For managing septic shock, phenylephrine is given as a continuous infusion with no initial bolus dose, starting at a dose of 0.5 μg/kg/min, and titrating upwards as needed. Dose rates above 6 μg/kg/min are unlikely to produce any further benefit (38).

### **Vasopressin**

Vasopressin, also known as antidiuretic hormone, produces vasoconstriction as a result of specialized vasopressin (V<sup>1</sup> ) receptors on vascular smooth muscle. Vasoconstriction is most prominent in skin, skeletal muscle, and splanchnic circulations (39). Vasopressin does not increase blood pressure in healthy volunteers, but it can produce significant increases in blood pressure in patients with vasodilatory shock (40). Other actions of vasopressin include enhanced water reabsorption in the distal renal tubules (mediated by V<sup>2</sup> receptors), and stimulation of ACTH release by the anterior pituitary gland (mediated by V<sup>3</sup> receptors).

### *Use as a Vasopressor*

Vasopressin can be used in the following clinical situations.

- 1. In the resuscitation of cardiac arrest, vasopressin can be given as a single IV dose (40 units) to replace the first or second dose of epinephrine.
- 2. In cases of septic shock that are resistant to hemodynamic support with norepinephrine (usually defined as norepinephrine dose of ≥0.2 μg/kg/min without an adequate blood pressure), the addition of vasopressin is recommended [\(22](#page-18-22)), as this can raise the blood pressure and reduce the catecholamine requirement (catecholamine sparing effect). However, the addition of vasopressin has *no proven survival benefit* (41).

### *Dosing Regimen*

For septic shock, vasopressin is given as a continuous infusion at 0.03–0.04 Units/hr. This dose rate is not titrated (unlike the catecholamine vasopressors). The adverse effects of vasopressin are similar in type and frequency to those mentioned previously for norepinephrine (30).

### **Angiotensin II**

Angiotensin II is a synthetic analogue of human angiotensin that acts on vascular smooth muscle to promote systemic vasoconstriction, and it also stimulates vasopressin release from the posterior pituitary gland. It was approved for use in vasodilatory shock in 2018, and has been used primarily in cases of norepinephrine resistance. It has raised the blood pressure in as many as 67% of cases (42), but the impact on mortality rates has been inconsistent (42,43).

### *Dosing Regimen*

Angiotensin II is given by continuous intravenous infusion: the initial dose is 20 ng/kg/min (0.02 μg/kg/min), which can be increased every 10–15 minutes if needed, to 80 ng/kg/min (0.08 μg/kg/min) in the first 3 hours (44). Thereafter, the maintenance dose should not exceed 40 ng/kg/min (0.04 μg/kg/min). There is no dose adjustment for hepatic or renal dysfunction.

### *Adverse Effects*

The major risk with angiotensin II is venous thrombosis. Angiotensin stimulates the release of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 from vascular smooth muscle, which blocks fibrinolysis, and it also increases platelet adhesion. In one clinical trial, the incidence of thrombotic events with angiotensin II was more than double the incidence with placebo (13% vs. 5%, respectively) (44).

### **Midodrine**

Midodrine is an orally administered α-receptor agonist that was FDA-approved in 1996 for the treatment of orthostatic hypotension. The clinical experience with midodrine in the ICU is summarized below.

- 1. Midodrine has proven effective for limiting or preventing hypotension during hemodialysis (45). The effective dose varies from 5 mg to 20 mg, given 20–30 minutes before dialysis. An additional smaller dose can be given during the dialysis if needed.
- 2. Adjuvant treatment with midodrine (20 mg every 8 hours) does not hasten the discontinuation of parenteral vasopressor therapy (46,47).

Despite its appeal as a vasopressor that is easy to administer, midodrine offers no advantage for the management of shock.

## **GOALS OF RESUSCITATION**

The goals of resuscitation for clinical shock have been mentioned throughout this chapter, and are briefly summarized here. The goals can be grouped into two categories, tissue perfusion and oxygen transport, as shown in [Table](#page-16-0) 14.5.

### **Tissue Perfusion**

The importance of blood flow in shock is readily apparent when you consider that three of the four types of shock (i.e., hypovolemic, cardiogenic, and obstructive) are low-flow conditions. One of the very first goals in shock resuscitation is to obtain accurate measurements of the mean arterial pressure (MAP), which is the pressure that drives peripheral flow. This requires direct intra-arterial pressure recordings from an arterial catheter. Once this is achieved the MAP should be maintained at ≥65 mm Hg. Do not monitor the systolic pressure (if possible), since this is a reflected pressure wave that is traveling back to the heart (i.e., away from the periphery). Remember that flow in the microcirculation is laminar, not pulsatile, and has no systolic and diastolic components.

Monitoring the cardiac output with pulmonary artery (PA) catheters was once a staple of critical care management, but this practice took a nosedive about 25 years ago because of evidence that PA catheters do not improve survival in critically ill patients. (A harsh judgement, since the catheter is a monitoring device, not a therapy.) If a cardiac output measurement is available, the goal is to keep the size-adjusted output (the cardiac index) above 2.5 L/min/m2.

An assessment of tissue perfusion is also possible using the PCO<sup>2</sup> gap, which is a measure of CO<sup>2</sup> washout from tissues. A PCO<sup>2</sup> gap that is <6 mm Hg is considered evidence of adequate tissue perfusion. This measure is easily obtained, and should be monitored in all patients with shock, even when the cardiac output measurement is available (since microcirculatory flow can be sluggish when the global cardiac output is in the normal range). *Caveat:* Metabolic acidosis can increase the nonmetabolic production of CO<sup>2</sup> , and this can result in a spurious increase in the PCO<sup>2</sup> gap.

Finally, tissue perfusion can be assessed by monitoring organ function, and urine output is appropriate for this purpose because a decrease in urine output is often one of the earliest signs of impending shock. Since oliguria is identified by a urine output <0.5 mL/kg/hr, the goal of resuscitation is to exceed this threshold. Mental status can also be monitored, but it is not as easy to quantify as urine output.

## **Oxygen Transport**

Monitoring the O<sup>2</sup> transport variables has obvious implications because a derangement on one of these variables is responsible for clinical shock.

- 1. Three of the major shock syndromes (i.e., hypovolemic, cardiogenic, and obstructive shock) are the result of inadequate O<sup>2</sup> delivery to tissues, usually from an inadequate cardiac output, with a contribution from a low hemoglobin level in one case (hemorrhagic shock). The goal in these cases is a cardiac index (CI) >2.5 L/min/m2, an O<sup>2</sup> delivery (DO<sup>2</sup> ) >300 mL/min/m2, and an O<sup>2</sup> uptake (VO<sup>2</sup> ) >110 mL/min/m2. If these variables are not monitored (which happens in most cases), then the goal of resuscitation is a central venous O<sup>2</sup> saturation (ScvO<sup>2</sup> ) >50% and a plasma lactate level <2 mmol/L.
- 2. *Septic shock is NOT the result of inadequate O<sup>2</sup> delivery, but instead is the result of a defect in oxidative phosphorylation in dysfunctional mitochondria* (48,49). This condition is known as *cytopathic hypoxia* (48), and it can be associated with a defect in O<sup>2</sup> extraction from capillary blood. The goals of management in this case include an O<sup>2</sup> extraction <80%, and an O<sup>2</sup> uptake (VO<sup>2</sup> ) >110 mL/min/m2. (The ScvO<sup>2</sup> may not be reliable in sepsis, as a result of the defective O<sup>2</sup> extraction.) If these variables are not monitored, the goal of resuscitation is simply a normal plasma lactate level. (The management of septic shock is presented in detail in Chapter 17.)
- 3. The universal goal of resuscitation in all forms of shock is normalization of the plasma lactate level (<2 mmol/L).

Of course, the tacit goal of resuscitation in clinical shock is survival.

## **A FINAL WORD**

## **Hypotension as a Consequence, not a Cause, of Shock**

The resuscitation of shock is dominated by the desire to raise the blood pressure, which is based on the assumption that the low blood pressure is responsible for the shock. The following observations create some doubt about this approach.

- 1. Shock is defined as a derangement in cellular O<sup>2</sup> utilization ([2\)](#page-18-2), not a derangement in blood pressure.
- 2. Relieving hypotension has been the major focus of shock management for over 70 years (since norepinephrine was introduced for clinical use in 1950), yet the mortality rate in shock remains unacceptably high, and the use of two and even three vasopressors offers no survival benefit (50).
- 3. Low blood pressures occur in conditions other than shock (e.g., autonomic neuropathies, adrenal insufficiency, 5% of healthy adults), and they do produce anoxic organ injury or elevated lactate levels. In fact, low blood pressures have proven beneficial in penetrating injuries by limiting blood loss (see the next chapter).

One possible explanation for these observations is that *hypotension does not cause shock, but instead is a consequence of shock.* Shock is well known for causing multiorgan dysfunction, and

one of the dysfunctional organs could be the blood vessels. If this is the case, then correcting the blood pressure will not correct the shock (or improve survival), just like hemodialysis for shockrelated renal failure will not correct the shock (or improve survival).
