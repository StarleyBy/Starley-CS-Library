# **Oxygen Inhalation**

I brought fire into your midst, and it consumed you, and reduced you to ashes.

Ezekiel (28:17)

There is a fondness for oxygen that is unmatched by any other treatment modality, as is clearly evident in the unbridled use of oxygen in hospitalized patients. The popularity of oxygen is apparent in emergency rooms, where inhaled oxygen is a knee-jerk response to acute illness, and in ICUs, where a patient who is NOT connected to a source of oxygen is a rare sight. Oxygen is given without evidence of tissue need, and without regard for the damaging effects of oxygen. This latter disregard is perplexing, since we protect our food from oxygen (with vacuum sealing, tightly-sealed plastic containers, and cellophane wrapping), yet we don't have the same consideration for our patients.

This chapter begins with an examination of the indications and effects of oxygen inhalation, and then describes the different delivery systems for oxygen. The final section is devoted to the dark side of oxygen: i.e., oxygen-related tissue injury.

### **INDICATIONS**

The first clinical practice guideline for  $O_2$  therapy was published in 1984 (1), and the indication for  $O_2$  therapy was stated as follows:

Supplemental oxygen therapy is appropriate in acute conditions when there is laboratory documentation of an arterial  $PO_2$  ( $PaO_2$ ) <60 mm Hg or an arterial  $O_2$  saturation ( $SaO_2$ ) <90%; tissue hypoxia is commonly assumed to be present at these laboratory values [italics mine].

This statement is consistent with the consensus definition of hypoxemia as a  $PaO_2$  <60 mm Hg or an  $SaO_2$  <90%. The most recent guidelines for  $O_2$  therapy (2) include a target  $SpO_2$  (i.e.,  $O_2$  saturation by pulse oximetry) of 88–92% for patients with  $CO_2$  retention, and 90–94% for other patients. The major issue with this recommendation is the assumption that tissue oxygenation is impaired when the  $PaO_2$  falls below 60 mm Hg, or the  $SpO_2$  falls below 90%. The following sections shed some light on this issue

## **Arterial O<sup>2</sup> Content**

The threshold for O<sup>2</sup> inhalation is associated with a very small change in the arterial O<sup>2</sup> content. This is demonstrated in [Figure](#page-2-0) 25.1, which shows the arterial O<sup>2</sup> content (CaO<sup>2</sup> ) at the threshold for both O<sup>2</sup> inhalation and red blood cell (RBC) transfusions (i.e., two interventions aimed at augmenting tissue oxygenation). The CaO<sup>2</sup> was calculated using the equation shown below [see also Equation (9.9)]:

$$CaO_2 (mL/L) = 1.34 \times Hb \times SaO_2 (\times 10)$$
 (25.1)

where 1.34 is the O<sup>2</sup> carrying capacity of hemoglobin (in mL/g), Hb is the hemoglobin concentration (in g/dL), SaO<sup>2</sup> is arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation (expressed as a decimal rather than a percentage), and the factor of 10 is used to convert mL/dL to mL/L. Using normal values for Hb (15 g/dL) and SaO<sup>2</sup> (0.98) yields a CaO<sup>2</sup> of 197 mL/L, which is indicated on the left in [Figure](#page-2-0) 25.1. When the SaO<sup>2</sup> is reduced to 0.90 (the threshold for O<sup>2</sup> therapy), the CaO<sup>2</sup> is 181 mL/L, which is an 8% decrease in CaO<sup>2</sup> . In comparison, using a Hb of 7 g/dL as the threshold for RBC transfusions (see Chapter 12), the corresponding CaO<sup>2</sup> is 92 mL/L. which is a 64% decrease from baseline.

The following statements can be derived from the comparisons in [Figure](#page-2-0) 25.1:

- 1. The threshold for O<sup>2</sup> inhalation corresponds to a minor (8%) change in arterial oxygenation.
- 2. Tissue oxygenation is not impaired until the CaO<sup>2</sup> falls below 92 mL/L (the threshold for RBC transfusions), so it cannot be impaired at the much higher threshold for O<sup>2</sup> inhalation.
- 3. It follows then, that the threshold for O<sup>2</sup> inhalation can be lowered.

## **Tolerance to Severe Hypoxemia**

Since hypoxemia is corrected immediately with supplemental  $O_2$ , there is limited information on tolerance to severe hypoxemia. The available information comes from small observational studies and case reports. The data in Table 25.1 is from a study of eight patients with acute exacerbation of COPD who had a  $PaO_2$  below 40 mm Hg while breathing room air for at least one hour (3). The  $PaO_2$ ,  $SaO_2$ , and plasma lactate level is listed for each patient (in ascending order according to severity of hypoxemia), and there is no evidence of impaired tissue oxygenation in any patient, as determined by the normal lactate levels ( $\leq 2 \text{ mmol/L}$ ). Similar observations have been reported in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (4), indicating that tolerance to severe hypoxemia is not an adaptation that develops over time.

#### *Hypobaric Hypoxemia*

Tolerance to severe hypoxemia was also demonstrated in a study of healthy individuals who were placed in a decompression chamber to simulate the atmospheric pressure at the Summit of Mount Everest (which is 253 mm Hg, or about one-third the pressure at sea level) [\(5](#page-17-4)). At this pressure, the PaO<sup>2</sup> was 30 mm Hg and the SaO<sup>2</sup> was 58% (mean values), but the plasma lactate level remained in the normal range at 1.7 mmol/L. Similar findings have been reported in climbers near the summit of Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen [\(6](#page-17-5)).

#### *Reinhold Messner*

One of the most notable challenges to the dogma about severe hypoxemia came from Reinhold Messner, the most celebrated mountaineer in the history of the discipline, who was the first to climb Mount Everest (elevation 29,029 feet) without the use of supplemental oxygen (a feat he achieved in 1978, along with fellow climber Peter Habeler). Prior to the historic climb, Messner was warned by experts that attempting to summit Mount Everest without supplemental O<sup>2</sup> would be suicidal, as he would lose consciousness and suffer permanent brain damage above an altitude of 26,000 feet (the region known as the "death zone"). However, Messner knew this was an untested claim (like many about oxygen), so he devised a simple test: i.e., using a plane with a depressurized cabin, he was flown to the summit of Mount Everest while breathing ambient air. To the disbelief of the experts, Messner experienced no ill effects as the plane climbed above 26,000 feet (the death zone) and reached its destination. He later wrote, "I had seen the flight through without an oxygen mask, and I was still able to talk, to think, to sense everything" [\(7](#page-17-6)).

## **Implications**

In summary, there is considerable evidence indicating that *O<sup>2</sup> inhalation is not based on tissue O<sup>2</sup> needs*; a notion that is supported by the physiological effects of O<sup>2</sup> described in the next section. As a result, the use of O<sup>2</sup> inhalation based on current recommendations results in excessive oxygenation, and this can be detrimental by promoting oxidative tissue injury, as described in the latter part of the chapter.

## **PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS**

#### **Metabolic Rate**

The goal of O<sup>2</sup> inhalation is to promote aerobic metabolism. However, there is no evidence that aerobic metabolism is impaired at the threshold for O<sup>2</sup> inhalation, so it seems unlikely that O<sup>2</sup> inhalation will have any impact on aerobic metabolism. This is demonstrated in [Figure](#page-4-0) 25.2,

which shows the effects of breathing 24% and 28% oxygen on the arterial PO<sup>2</sup> (PaO<sup>2</sup> ) and the rate of aerobic metabolism (VO<sup>2</sup> ) in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive lung disease ([8\)](#page-17-7). There is a significant increase in the PaO<sup>2</sup> with each increment in inhaled O<sup>2</sup> , but the rate of aerobic metabolism remains unchanged. Similar results have been reported in other clinical studies ([9,](#page-17-8)[10\)](#page-17-9), indicating that *oxygen inhalation does not promote aerobic metabolism*.

<span id="page-4-0"></span>![](_page_4_Figure_1.jpeg)

**FIGURE 25.2** Results of a study in patients with severe hypoxemia showing that the increase in arterial PO<sup>2</sup> (PaO<sup>2</sup> ) from O<sup>2</sup> therapy is not accompanied by an increase in aerobic metabolism (VO<sup>2</sup> ). Numbers in parentheses are the mean values for each measurement. FIO<sup>2</sup> = fraction of O<sup>2</sup> in inhaled gas. Data from Reference 8.

## **Oxygen as a Vasoconstrictor**

Oxygen acts as a vasoconstrictor in all major organs except the lungs [\(11](#page-17-10)), where it acts as a vasodilator. The principal mechanism for the vasoconstriction is loss of the vasodilating actions of nitric oxide, which is oxidized by one of the oxygen metabolites, the superoxide radical (see later) [\(12](#page-17-11)). This vasoconstriction has the following consequences:

- 1. Oxygen promotes vasoconstriction in the coronary arteries, and can decrease coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease ([13\)](#page-17-12).
- 2. Oxygen-induced systemic vasoconstriction can decrease the cardiac output and promote tissue hypoperfusion, and this effect counteracts the ability of O<sup>2</sup> inhalation to increase systemic O<sup>2</sup> delivery ([14\)](#page-17-13).
- 3. In animal studies, oxygen can completely obliterate capillary networks in skeletal muscle ([15\)](#page-17-14).

### **Implications**

The observation that O<sup>2</sup> inhalation does not promote aerobic metabolism is consistent with the notion that the clinical use of O<sup>2</sup> is not based on tissue O<sup>2</sup> needs. Furthermore, *oxygen-induced vasoconstriction can be viewed as an inherent mechanism that protects the tissues from excess (unwanted) oxygen*. In other words, the tissues have enough O<sup>2</sup> , and they don't want anymore.

## **OXYGEN DELIVERY SYSTEMS**

A variety of oxygen delivery systems are available for spontaneously breathing patients, and the major ones are listed in [Table](#page-6-0) 25.2, along with some characteristic features of each.

## **Flow Rate and FIO<sup>2</sup>**

Supplemental O<sup>2</sup> is provided as a pure gas that is delivered into the mouth or nasopharynx at a preselected flow rate, and the fractional concentration of inhaled O<sup>2</sup> (FIO<sup>2</sup> ) is determined by the balance between the rate of O<sup>2</sup> delivery and the patient's inspiratory flow rate. (There are some exceptions to this, as described later.) If the patient's inspiratory flow rate exceeds the rate of O<sup>2</sup> delivery, the excess flow will draw in room air, which will decrease the FIO<sup>2</sup> . A normal inspiratory flow rate is about 15 L/min (0.25 L/sec) during quiet breathing, but it can be as high as 120 L/min in patients with acute respiratory failure [\(16](#page-17-15)). Therefore, low-flow O<sup>2</sup> delivery systems (which have delivery rates below 15 L/min) are usually inadequate for patients with acute respiratory failure, especially those with respiratory distress or labored breathing.

## **Low-Flow Systems**

Low-flow systems deliver O<sup>2</sup> at rates of ≤15 L/min, and are most suitable for patients with mild hypoxemia and no respiratory distress.

## *Low-Flow Nasal O<sup>2</sup>*

Low flow O<sup>2</sup> is typically delivered via nasal prongs at flow rates of 1–6 L/min (although rates up to 15 L/min are possible with large-bore nasal cannulas). The O<sup>2</sup> is usually humidified when the flow rate exceeds 4 L/min. The FIO<sup>2</sup> during quiet breathing is about 24% (at 1 L/min) up to 40% (at 6 L/min).

The major advantages of low-flow nasal O<sup>2</sup> are simplicity of use and patient acceptance, including the ability for patients to eat and converse. The major disadvantage is the inability to achieve high concentrations of inhaled O<sup>2</sup> .

#### *Standard Face Masks*

Standard face masks deliver oxygen at flow rates between 5 and 10 L/min (a minimum flow rate of 5 L/min is needed to clear exhaled gas from the mask). Exhalation ports on the side of the face mask also allow room air to be inhaled. This system can achieve a maximum FIO<sup>2</sup> of about 60% during quiet breathing. Although face masks can deliver a slightly higher FIO<sup>2</sup> than nasal prongs, they are more confining, and they do not permit oral feeding.

### **High-Flow Systems**

High-flow systems include reservoir masks, air-entrainment devices, specialized "diffuser" masks (OxyMaskTM), and high-flow nasal O<sup>2</sup> . These systems are intended for patients with high O<sup>2</sup> requirements and high ventilatory demands.

#### *Reservoir Masks*

Reservoir masks are standard face masks that are attached to a reservoir bag that is filled with oxygen from a constant-flow oxygen source. If the reservoir bag is kept inflated, the patient will draw primarily from the gas in the bag, which allows for higher concentrations of inhaled oxygen.

An example of a reservoir mask is shown in [Figure](#page-7-0) 25.3. This is a *non-rebreather mask*, which is designed to prevent rebreathing of exhaled CO<sup>2</sup> . The reservoir bag is filled with oxygen, and a one way valve between the bag and the mask allows inhalation of O<sup>2</sup> from the bag, but prevents exhaled CO<sup>2</sup> from entering the bag. One-way flaps on the mask allow exhaled gas to escape, while preventing inhalation of ambient air. Non-rebreather masks can theoretically achieve an FIO<sup>2</sup> of 100%, but the maximum FIO<sup>2</sup> is closer to 80%, because of leaks around the mask and valve malfunction. (*Note:* There is also a *partial rebreather mask*, which allows some of the exhaled CO<sup>2</sup> to enter the reservoir bag, but these devices are rarely used.)

Non-rebreather masks were once a popular method for providing high concentrations of O<sup>2</sup> , but they have fallen from favor because of problems with CO<sup>2</sup> rebreathing from faulty valves, and troublesome hypoxemia from inadequately filled reservoir bags.

<span id="page-7-0"></span>![](_page_7_Figure_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 25.3** Non-rebreather mask. Oxygen is inhaled from the reservoir bag, and a one way valve prevents exhaled gas from entering the bag. Flaps on the mask allow exhaled gas to escape, while preventing inhalation of ambient air.

#### *Air Entrainment Masks*

Air entrainment masks are designed to deliver a constant FIO<sup>2</sup> . The operation of an airentrainment device is shown in [Figure](#page-8-0) 25.4 ([17\)](#page-17-16). The end of the oxygen inlet port is narrowed to create a high velocity stream of gas (analogous to the nozzle on a garden hose). This produces a shear force known as *viscous drag* that pulls room air into the device through air-entrainment ports. The greater the flow of O<sup>2</sup> into the mask, the greater the volume of air that is entrained, and this keeps the FIO<sup>2</sup> constant. The FIO<sup>2</sup> is varied by varying the size of the air entrainment ports. Although air-entrainment masks use O<sup>2</sup> flow rates of ≤15 L/min, they are considered highflow systems because the total flow (i.e., O<sup>2</sup> flow plus room air flow) is often ≥60 L/min. The FIO<sup>2</sup> range of these devices is 24 to 50%.

Air-entrainment masks have been popular for patients with chronic CO<sup>2</sup> retention, where an inadvertent increase in FIO<sup>2</sup> can lead to further increases in arterial PCO<sup>2</sup> . However, their popularity has waned, because the continuous monitoring of arterial O<sup>2</sup> saturation with pulse oximetry is a deterrent to excessive oxygenation in patients with CO<sup>2</sup> retention.

<span id="page-8-0"></span>![](_page_8_Figure_1.jpeg)

**FIGURE 25.4** An air-entrainment device. A narrowing at the oxygen inlet creates a high-velocity stream of gas that creates viscous drag, which pulls in room air (RA). This "jet mixing" keeps the concentration of inhaled oxygen constant, regardless of changes in the flow rate of oxygen.

#### *The OxyMask™*

The Oxymask™ (Southmedic, Inc., Barrie, Ontario, Canada) is equipped with a proprietary device called a "diffuser" that delivers a concentrated stream of O<sup>2</sup> directly over the nose and mouth. This design allows for high concentrations of inhaled O<sup>2</sup> at relatively low flow rates (see [Table](#page-6-0) 25.2). The mask also has large openings to facilitate the escape of exhaled CO<sup>2</sup> .

The OxyMask has outperformed the non-rebreather mask (less CO<sup>2</sup> rebreathing) [\(18](#page-17-17)) and the air-entrainment mask (greater O<sup>2</sup> concentration at lower flows) ([19\)](#page-17-18). It is a superior mask for delivering high concentrations of O<sup>2</sup> , at a relatively low cost (because of the low flow rate for O<sup>2</sup> ). However this mask otherwise offers no advantages over the high-flow nasal O<sup>2</sup> system described next.

## **High-Flow Nasal O<sup>2</sup>**

*High-flow nasal O<sup>2</sup> (HFNO) is the greatest advance in O<sup>2</sup> delivery systems in recent memory*. The basic design of the HFNO circuit is illustrated in [Figure](#page-9-0) 25.5. This circuit provides heated and humidified gas for inhalation, and has an oxygen-air blender that allows titration of the FIO<sup>2</sup> and flow rate independently. Flow rates of 40−60 L/min are achievable (depending on the manufacturer), and the nasal prongs have a tapered end to increase the velocity of flow (like the nozzle on a garden hose).

#### *Physiological Benefits*

HFNO has a number of beneficial effects, and these are listed in [Table](#page-9-1) 25.3. The high flow rates,

combined with the increased velocity of flow from the design of the nasal prongs, results in a washout of the dead space in the nasopharynx (20,21). (*Note:* About 30% of a tidal volume is drawn from exhaled gas in the anatomical dead space.) This prevents rebreathing of exhaled CO<sup>2</sup> , and also provides a "sink" that maintains the desired FIO<sup>2</sup> if a patient overbreathes the flow rate for O<sup>2</sup> delivery. Surprisingly, HFNO also increases the end-expiratory lung volume, which, in turn, increases lung compliance (distensibility) and reduces the work of breathing (20,21).

<span id="page-9-0"></span>![](_page_9_Picture_1.jpeg)

**FIGURE 25.5** A schematic illustration of the circuit for high-flow nasal O<sup>2</sup> . See text for explanation.

The ability of HFNO to increase the end-expiratory lung volume has been attributed to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). However, HFNO can generate low-level PEEP (2–3 cm H2O), but only with the mouth closed (22,23), which is a rare phenomenon in patients with acute respiratory failure.

#### *Clinical Benefits*

Other than the ability to correct severe hypoxemia, the principal benefit of HFNO is the tendency to alleviate respiratory distress and promote comfortable breathing. This not only promotes

patient comfort, it also reduces the risk of "patient self-induced injury", a form of lung injury produced by labored breathing, which is described in Chapter 24 (see Figure 24.4). This may explain why HFNO has reduced the rate of intubations in some studies (24), although this is not a consistent finding (25).

HFNO has traditionally been used when hypoxemia is refractory to conventional methods of O<sup>2</sup> inhalation, but the numerous benefits of HFNO has prompted a recommendation that HFNO should *replace* conventional O<sup>2</sup> therapy for patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (26).

## **OXYGEN AS A SOURCE OF INJURY**

The introduction to this chapter included a statement about protecting our food from the oxygen in atmospheric air (e.g., with vacuum sealing), and the reason is that *oxygen decomposes organic matter* by disrupting organic molecules (including carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids). The chemical derivatives of oxygen, which are called *reactive oxygen species* (ROS) are even more damaging than the parent molecule, and are capable of inflicting lethal cell injury (27). In fact, contrary to the popular perception that oxygen protects cells from injury in critically ill patients, the accumulating evidence indicates that *oxygen (via the production of ROS) is an important source of cell injury in critically ill patients* (27–29). (The role of ROS in inflammation is described in Chapter 17.) The following is a brief description of the injurious nature of oxygen.

## **Oxygen Metabolism**

The metabolism of O<sup>2</sup> takes place at the end of the electron transport chain in mitochondria (within the cytochrome oxidase complex), where the electrons that accumulate in the process of ATP production are cleared by adding them to O<sup>2</sup> to produce water. (The addition of electrons to an atom or molecule is known as chemical reduction.) The O<sup>2</sup> molecule can accept four electrons, but only one electron can be added per reduction reaction (the reason for this is beyond the scope of this chapter), which results in the reaction sequence shown in [Figure](#page-12-0) 25.6.

The intermediates in the reduction of O<sup>2</sup> to water include the superoxide radical, hydrogen peroxide, and the hydroxyl radical. All are reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are capable of disrupting and damaging vital cell components (e.g., membrane lipids, cytoplasmic proteins, and DNA) by the chemical process of *oxidation* (which removes electrons from a substrate). Thus, ROS are sometimes referred to as oxidizing agents, or *oxidants*. Some relevant features of the ROS generated by O<sup>2</sup> metabolism are summarized below (27).

- 1. The superoxide and hydroxyl radicals are *free radicals* (i.e., they have an unpaired electron in their outer orbitals), and are highly reactive.
- 2. Hydrogen peroxide is not a free radical, but it is a powerful oxidizing agent that readily moves across cell membranes, and can be widely distributed throughout the body.
- 3. The hydroxyl radical is the most reactive molecule known in biochemistry, and enters into a reaction within three molecular diameters of its point of origin. It is the most destructive of all the ROS, and is a major source of oxidant-induced cell injury.

4. Free iron in its reduced form (Fe++) catalyzes the formation of the hydroxyl radical, and thus free iron can act as a pro-oxidant (see later).

Normally, at least 95% of oxygen is completely reduced to water, and only a very small fraction (about 3%) of O<sup>2</sup> metabolism generates damaging ROS (27). However, there is *a more important, source of ROS: i.e., the inflammatory response* (see next).

## **Neutrophil Activation**

As described in Chapter 17 (see Figure 17.1), the activation of neutrophils involves a precipitous rise (up to 20-fold) in O<sup>2</sup> consumption (30), which is known as the *respiratory burst*, and is designed to generate ROS. Neutrophils also have a myeloperoxidase enzyme that generates *hypochlorite*, which is the active ingredient in household bleach.

## *Inflammatory Injury*

There is abundant evidence that ROS have a prominent role in the tissue injury attributed to inflammation (see Chapter 17) (31). The damaging effects of ROS are accelerated by the *tendency for free radicals to create chain reactions* (32). When a free radical reacts with a nonradical, the non-radical loses an electron and is transformed into a free radical, which can then remove an electron from another nonradical to produce another free radical, and so on. This creates a self-sustaining reaction or *chain reaction*, and these reactions are troublesome because they continue after the inciting event is eliminated. (A fire is a familiar example of a chain

reaction involving free radicals.) Chain reactions would explain the progression of inflammatory multiorgan damage in severe sepsis and septic shock after the infection has been eradicated.

### **Antioxidant Protection**

Oxidative (oxygen-related) injury is kept in check by a vast array of endogenous *antioxidants* (i.e., atoms or molecules that prevent or block the actions of oxidizing agents). The following is a brief description of the major antioxidants, and [Figure](#page-13-0) 25.7 shows their mechanisms of action.

<span id="page-13-0"></span>![](_page_13_Figure_3.jpeg)

**FIGURE 25.7** The actions of some endogenous and exogenous antioxidants (shown in red). SOD = superoxide dismutase, GSH = reduced glutathione, GSSG = oxidized glutathione, Se = selenium. See text for explanation.

### *Superoxide Dismutase*

Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is an enzyme that facilitates the conversion of superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxide. SOD is considered an antioxidant because it clears the superoxide radical, but it also increases the production of hydrogen peroxide, and thus it can also act as a prooxidant (33).

The role of SOD in inflammatory injury is suggested by animal studies of pain perception, which have shown that treatment with an SOD mimetic curtails the pain response to inflammation (34). This implicates superoxide radicals as a source of inflammatory pain; a notion that is supported by evidence that SOD is inactivated by products of inflammation (35). These findings have important implications for the development of nonopioid analgesics for painful inflammation.

#### *Glutathione*

Glutathione is a sulfur-containing tripeptide that is considered *the major intracellular antioxidant in the human body* (36,37). In its reduced form, glutathione (GSH in [Figure](#page-13-0) 25.7) donates electrons to reduce hydrogen peroxide to water in a reaction that is catalyzed by a selenium-dependent enzyme, glutathione peroxidase:

$$H_2O_2 + 2 GSH \rightarrow 2 H_2O + GSSG$$
 (25.2)

Glutathione is present in high concentrations is most mammalian cells, and is synthesized *de novo* within cells. It can be exported extracellularly, but plasma levels are three orders of magnitude lower than intracellular levels (38). Glutathione levels in lung lavage fluid are 140 fold higher than plasma (39), suggesting that glutathione plays an important role in protecting the lung from oxidant injury. There is evidence that *glutathione is depleted in critically ill patients* (40).

**N-ACETYLCYSTEINE:** Glutathione does not move readily into cells, and exogenous glutathione administration has little effect on intracellular levels (41). However, the popular mucolytic agent *N-acetylcysteine* is a glutathione analogue that can cross cell membranes and serve as a glutathione surrogate (as proven by the beneficial effects of N-acetylcysteine in acetaminophen toxicity, which is attributed to glutathione deficiency - see Chapter 52). N-acetylcysteine has a promising future as an antioxidant in critically ill patients (42).

**SELENIUM:** Selenium is an essential trace element that serves as a cofactor for the glutathione peroxidase enzyme in humans. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for selenium is 55 µg daily in adult men and women (43). The absence of dietary selenium produces measurable decreases in glutathione peroxidase activity after just one week (44). Selenium levels in blood are typically low in critically ill patients (45), and high-dose selenium replacement (1000 µg IV daily) has been associated with improved survival in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock (45).

Selenium status can be monitored using whole blood selenium (normal range = 0.96–1.78 µmol/L) or serum selenium (normal range = 0.72–1.33 µmol/L). If needed, selenium can be given intravenously as sodium selenite. The highest dose that is considered safe is 200 µg daily.

#### *Vitamin E*

Vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) is a lipid-soluble vitamin that is found in the interior of most cell membranes, where it serves as a "chain breaking" antioxidant to halt the progression of lipid peroxidation (i.e., the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, also known as *rancidity* when it occurs in food products), which proceeds as a chain reaction. To accomplish this, vitamin E donates an electron to a free radical intermediate in lipid peroxidation, and in so doing, vitamin E becomes a free radical, but an innocuous one. This reaction halts the chain reaction of lipid peroxidation. (*Note:* Lipid peroxidation is initiated by the hydroxyl radical, and [Figure](#page-13-0) 25.7 shows Vitamin E blocking this reaction, to indicate that Vitamin E blocks lipid peroxidation.)

Vitamin E depletion has been reported in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (46), and there is evidence that high-dose vitamin E has beneficial effects in trauma victims (see later). The normal concentration of vitamin E in plasma is 1 mg/dL, and a level below 0.5 mg/dL

is evidence of deficiency (47).

#### *Vitamin C*

Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a water-soluble vitamin that is best known for its essential role in collagen formation. However, it is also a reducing agent that can donate electrons to free radicals to erase their adverse effects. As a result, ascorbate can act as a "scavenger" for oxygen-derived free radicals: i.e., superoxide radicals and hydroxyl radicals (48). Ascorbate also donates electrons to regenerate Vitamin E from the inactive Vitamin E radical.

#### *Ceruloplasmin and Transferrin*

Ceruloplasmin and transferrin account for most of the antioxidant activity in plasma (49). The antioxidant activity of both proteins is related to their actions in limiting free iron in the reduced form (Fe2+), which will limit the production of hydroxyl radicals. Ceruloplasmin oxidizes iron from the Fe2+ to the Fe3+ state, and transferrin binds iron in the oxidized or Fe3+ state. The role of free iron as a pro-oxidant (50) may explain why most of the iron in the body is bound to proteins or sequestered (e.g., in the bone marrow).

## **Oxidative Stress**

The risk of oxidative tissue injury is determined by the balance between oxidant and antioxidant activities. When oxidant activity exceeds the neutralizing capacity of the antioxidants, the excess or unopposed oxidant activity can promote tissue injury. This condition of *unopposed biological oxidation is known as oxidative stress*, and it is the principal source of oxidative tissue injury. The most familiar example of oxidative stress is severe or persistent inflammation, especially in critically ill patients, which combines an increase in production of oxidants (ROS) with likely depletion of antioxidants.

Monitoring oxidative stress has obvious benefits for the care of critically ill patients (or any patient with inflammatory tissue injury). One promising method involves the measurement of lipid peroxidation products in exhaled gas (51), but this methodology is not currently available in clinical practice.

## **PULMONARY OXYGEN TOXICITY**

Pulmonary oxygen toxicity is an inflammatory lung injury (similar to the acute respiratory distress syndrome described in Chapter 24) that occurs in response to the prolonged inhalation of high concentrations of oxygen. The following are some relevant issues regarding this form of oxidative injury.

## **Species Differences**

The tendency to develop pulmonary oxygen toxicity varies in different species. For example, laboratory rats will die of respiratory failure after 5 to 7 days of breathing 100% O<sup>2</sup> , while coldblooded species like sea turtles can breathe pure O<sup>2</sup> for several weeks and even months without harm (52). Non-human primates, which are closest to humans, show signs of pulmonary O<sup>2</sup> toxicity after about one week of breathing pure oxygen (53).

#### **Human Studies**

In healthy volunteers, inhalation of 100%  $O_2$  for 6 to 12 hours results in a tracheobronchitis and a decrease in vital capacity attributed to absorption atelectasis (54). Prolonged exposure to 100%  $O_2$  has been reported in only 6 humans: 5 with irreversible coma who received 100%  $O_2$  for 3 to 4 days (55), and one healthy volunteer who inhaled pure  $O_2$  for 4.5 days (56). In all these cases, the subjects developed a pulmonary condition that was consistent with inflammatory lung injury.

#### What FIO<sub>2</sub> is Toxic?

Based on the observation of a decreased vital capacity when the  $FIO_2$  exceeds 60% (54), the threshold  $FIO_2$  for pulmonary  $O_2$  toxicity was set at 60%. However, adopting a single threshold  $FIO_2$  for all patients neglects the contribution of endogenous antioxidants to the risk of oxygen toxicity. For example, animal studies have shown that pulmonary  $O_2$  toxicity is exacerbated by vitamin E deficiency (57) and glutathione deficiency (58). Since antioxidant depletion seems to be common in ICU patients (40,45,46), it is reasonable to assume that the toxic level of  $FIO_2$  is much lower than suspected in critically ill patients. Therefore, the best practice is keeping the  $FIO_2$  at the lowest tolerable level.

#### **Promoting Antioxidant Protection**

Another approach to minimizing the risk of pulmonary  $O_2$  toxicity (and any source of oxidative cell injury) is to monitor and correct antioxidant levels. This approach is supported by evidence of antioxidant depletion in critically ill patients (40,45,46) Evidence of benefit from such an approach is provided by a study in trauma patients (59), which showed that a high-dose antioxidant cocktail of vitamin C (1000 mg every 8 hrs), vitamin E (1000 units every 8 hrs) and selenium (200  $\mu$ g daily) for 7 days was associated with a significant decline in cases of respiratory failure and ventilator dependence. Promoting antioxidant protection for your patients is similar to the use of tightly sealed plastic containers to protect your food.

## **A FINAL WORD**

## Why is Oxygen a Vasoconstrictor?

For those who like to consider teleology in biological design, the actions of oxygen to promote systemic vasoconstriction merits some attention.

The ability of inhaled  $O_2$  to augment tissue oxygenation is determined by its influence on both the  $O_2$  content in arterial blood (CaO<sub>2</sub>), and the cardiac output (CO), as defined by the equation for arterial  $O_2$  delivery: i.e.,

$$O_2$$
 Delivery =  $CaO_2 \times CO$  (25.3)

Inhaled  $O_2$  will increase the  $CaO_2$ , but the  $O_2$ -induced systemic vasoconstriction leads to a decrease in CO, and the net effect is that  $O_2$  delivery remains unchanged (60). This would explain why  $O_2$  inhalation has no effect on aerobic metabolism, as shown in Figure 25.2.

The vasoconstrictor response to O<sup>2</sup> can then be viewed as a defense mechanism that is designed to protect the tissues from excess oxygen (i.e., more than is needed to maintain aerobic metabolism). This will limit the risk of oxidative tissue injury, and in this sense, *the vasoconstrictor response to O<sup>2</sup> can be viewed as an antioxidant defense mechanism*.

The human body seems designed to protect the vital organs from oxygen, and *our liberal use of oxygen is the contrary to human design*.
