# **Nonpharmaceutical Poisons**

*It is astonishing with how little reading a doctor can practice medicine, but it is not astonishing how badly he may do it.*

Sir William Osler (*[a](#page-10-0)*)

This chapter describes the toxic syndromes produced by exposure to nonpharmaceutical poisons, including carbon monoxide, cyanide, and the toxic alcohols (methanol and ethylene glycol). They are less common than the drug overdoses presented in the last chapter, but they can be lethal if not recognized.

## **CARBON MONOXIDE**

Carbon monoxide (CO) is produced by the incomplete combustion of organic (carbon-based) matter, and is one oxidation reaction shy of carbon dioxide (2CO + O<sup>2</sup> → 2 CO<sup>2</sup> ). The principal source of CO poisoning is smoke inhalation from house fires, poorly functioning heating systems, and the exhaust from automobile engines [\(1](#page-10-1)) (*Note:* The mandate for catalytic converters in automobiles, which converts CO to CO<sup>2</sup> , has reduced CO emissions by more than 95%.)

### **Pathophysiology**

Carbon monoxide binds to the heme moieties in hemoglobin (at the same site that binds oxygen) to produce *carboxyhemoglobin* (COHb). The affinity of CO for binding to hemoglobin is over 200 times greater than the affinity of O<sup>2</sup> , and CO pressures of only 0.4 mm Hg can fully saturate hemoglobin ([2\)](#page-10-2). The effects of COHb on systemic oxygenation are demonstrated by the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curves in [Figure](#page-1-0) 53.1 [\(1](#page-10-1)). The curves in this graph show the relationship between oxygen tension (PO<sup>2</sup> ) and the oxygen content in blood when hemoglobin is normal (upper curve), and when COHb makes up 50% of the hemoglobin molecules (lower curve) ([3\)](#page-10-3). The arterial O<sup>2</sup> content (point A) decreases in proportion to the increase in COHb, reflecting the ability of CO to block O<sup>2</sup> binding to hemoglobin. The venous point (point V) on both curves was identified by assuming a normal arteriovenous O<sup>2</sup> content difference (CaO<sup>2</sup> –

CvO<sup>2</sup> = 5 mL/dL) for both curves. The venous PO<sup>2</sup> (PvO<sup>2</sup> ) is a close approximation of tissue PO<sup>2</sup> , and it is much lower when COHb is present. This provides indirect evidence that CO poisoning impairs tissue oxygenation.

#### *Other Effects*

The affinity of CO for heme results in inhibition of other heme-containing proteins, such as myoglobin (which is responsible for O<sup>2</sup> storage in skeletal muscle) and cytochrome oxidase (which is responsible for the oxidative production of ATP in mitochondria) ([3\)](#page-10-3). Both effects promote a switch to anaerobic metabolism. CO also activates neutrophils ([4\)](#page-10-4), which promotes oxidative tissue injury from reactive oxygen species. (See Chapter 17, and Figure 17.1, for the production of reactive oxygen species during neutrophil activation.) These effects may play an important role in CO poisoning, because *there is a poor correlation between COHb levels and the clinical severity of CO poisoning* [\(4](#page-10-4),5).

A = arterial blood, V = venous blood. The venous PO<sup>2</sup> (PvO<sup>2</sup> ) is a reflection of tissue PO, and is decreased by the carbon monoxide effect on hemoglobin. Curves adapted from Reference 1.

### **Clinical Features**

The following statements summarize the clinical manifestations of CO poisoning, which are variable and nonspecific [\(1](#page-10-1)).

- 1. Headache (usually frontal) and dizziness are the most common early complaints [\(1](#page-10-1)), and may be accompanied by drowsiness, nausea, and vomiting. As CO exposure increases, ataxia appears, along with agitation and changes in mentation (usually confusion and delirium).
- 2. Severe cases of CO poisoning are characterized by obtundation or coma, generalized seizures, respiratory failure, often from the acute respiratory distress syndrome, hemodynamic instability, and lactic acidosis.
- 3. A cherry-red skin color is classically described in CO poisoning (due to COHb being a brighter shade of red than oxyhemoglobin), but this is a rare occurrence (5).

#### *Delayed Neurologic Sequelae*

Symptoms of acute CO poisoning can be followed (in one to four weeks) by a neuropsychiatric syndrome that includes mental deterioration (e.g., impaired judgment, memory loss, cognitive defects), and parkinsonism ([1,](#page-10-1)6). The culprit in the delayed neurologic response is unclear, because the correlation with COHb levels has been difficult to establish ([1\)](#page-10-1).

### **Diagnosis**

The diagnosis of CO poisoning is not possible based on signs and symptoms alone, and requires evidence of an elevated COHb level in blood.

### *Carboxyhemoglobin*

The measurement of hemoglobin in its different forms (oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, methemoglobin, and carboxyhemoglobin) is based on the light absorbing properties of each form. This method is known as *oximetry*, and is described in detail in Chapter 7. The following statements summarize the use of oximetry to measure COHb levels in blood.

- 1. *Pulse oximetry is NOT reliable for the detection of COHb*. Pulse oximeters use 2 wavelengths of light to measure oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin in blood. Light absorbance at one of the wavelengths (660 nm) is very similar for oxygenated hemoglobin and COHb (see Figure 7.1), so *COHb is measured as oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO<sup>2</sup> ) by pulse oximeters, which results in spuriously high readings for HbO<sup>2</sup>* (7).
- 2. The measurement of COHb requires an 8-wavelength oximeter (known as a CO-oximeter) that is available in most clinical laboratories. This device measures the relative abundance of all forms of hemoglobin in blood, and the abundance of each form is expressed as a percentage of the total hemoglobin in blood.

COHb levels are negligible (<1%) in healthy nonsmokers, but smokers have COHb levels of 3–5% or even higher (5). Therefore, the threshold for elevated COHb levels is 3–4% for nonsmokers, and 10% for smokers (5).

### **Management**

The treatment for CO poisoning is inhalation of 100% oxygen. The elimination half-life of COHb is 320 minutes while breathing room air, and 74 minutes while breathing 100% oxygen (5), so *less than 1½ hours of breathing 100% oxygen should reduce COHb levels to normal*. To achieve this, high-flow, heated and humidified nasal O<sup>2</sup> , which delivers O<sup>2</sup> at rates up to 40 L/min, seems the best option to ensure 100% O<sup>2</sup> inhalation. (High-flow nasal O<sup>2</sup> is described in Chapter 25, and is depicted in Figure 25.5.)

#### *Hyperbaric Oxygen*

Hyperbaric oxygen has been studied for the treatment of CO poisoning since the 1970s, and there is some evidence that it might reduce the risk of delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae (8). However, the sum of the entire experience with hyperbaric O<sup>2</sup> shows no convincing evidence that it is superior to "normobaric" O<sup>2</sup> therapy for CO poisoning (7,9).

#### *Cardiac Concerns*

Myocardial injury has been reported in close to 40% of patients with moderate to severe CO poisoning, and is a poor prognostic finding (10). Therefore, an ECG and cardiac biomarkers are recommended for all patients with moderate or severe CO poisoning (7).

#### *Cyanide Poisoning*

House fires generate hydrogen cyanide gas as well as carbon monoxide, and empiric treatment for cyanide poisoning is recommended for smoke inhalation victims who are hemodynamically unstable, or have a serum lactate level ≥10 mmol/L (5). This treatment is described in the next section.

## **CYANIDE POISONING**

Cyanide is a lethal toxin with a nefarious history. The Nazis used hydrogen cyanide gas (Zyklon-B) for mass murder in the 1940's, and in 1978, cyanide-laced fruit drinks were used for the mass murder of more than 900 adults and children in Jonestown, Guyana (11). The principal sources of cyanide poisoning include inhalation of hydrogen cyanide gas during domestic fires (12), and oral ingestion of potassium or sodium cyanide, which is converted to hydrogen cyanide by gastric acidity (13). There is also an iatrogenic source of cyanide poisoning from vasodilator infusions with *sodium nitroprusside* (14), which should never be overlooked.

<span id="page-4-0"></span>![](_page_4_Figure_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 53.2** The actions of cyanide to inhibit cytochrome oxidase, and the clearance of cyanide by hydroxocobalamin and thiocyanate. See text for further explanation.

#### **Pathogenesis**

Cyanide ions have a high affinity for metalloproteins, including the oxidized iron (Fe3+) in cytochrome oxidase and methemoglobin. Cytochrome oxidase is the last enzyme system in the electron-transport chain within mitochondria, where the electrons collected during ATP production are used to reduce oxygen to water (see [Figure](#page-4-0) 53.2). Cyanide-induced inhibition of cytochrome oxidase thus halts the process of oxidative energy production in mitochondria. This impedes the uptake of pyruvate into mitochondria, and subsequently increases the production of lactic acid. The accumulation of lactate in plasma produces *a progressive metabolic (lactic) acidosis,* which *is a hallmark of cyanide poisoning*. The defect in cellular energy production is often fatal if not corrected.

### **Clinical Features**

Early signs of cyanide poisoning include agitation, tachycardia, hypertension, and tachypnea, representing the compensatory stage of metabolic acidosis. This often progresses to loss of consciousness, bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiac arrest. Plasma lactate levels are typically very high (>10 mmol/L), and venous blood can look "arterialized" (and have a high PO<sup>2</sup> ) because of the marked decrease in tissue O<sup>2</sup> utilization (13). Progression is rapid after smoke inhalation, and the time from onset of symptoms to cardiac arrest can be less than 5 minutes (12). Progression can be much slower after the oral ingestion of cyanide, and clinical manifestations can take several minutes or even hours to appear (13).

#### *Diagnosis*

Cyanide poisoning is a clinical diagnosis. Whole blood cyanide levels can be used for documentation, but results are not immediately available, and cyanide antidotes must be given quickly for optimal results. The clinical diagnosis of cyanide poisoning is particularly challenging in victims of smoke inhalation, because many of the clinical features of cyanide poisoning are indistinguishable from carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. Cyanide poisoning should be suspected if smoke inhalation is associated with hemodynamic instability, or a plasma lactate >10 mmol/L (5). However, there may not be not enough time to wait for a lactate level after smoke inhalation.

#### *Treatment*

There are three antidotes for cyanide poisoning, which are included in [Table](#page-5-0) 53.1. Unfortunately, the most effective antidotes must be given intravenously, which can cause dangerous delays in treatment (especially for smoke inhalation victims).

From References 12, 15, and 18.

#### *Hydroxocobalamin*

The antidote of choice for cyanide poisoning is *hydroxocobalamin*, a cobalt-containing precursor of vitamin B<sup>12</sup> that combines with cyanide to form cyanocobalamin, which is then excreted in the urine (see [Figure](#page-4-0) 53.2). The recommended dose is *5 grams, given as an IV infusion over 15 minutes* (15). A second dose of 5 grams is recommended for life-threatening cases. Hydroxocobalamin is generally considered to be safe, although it can cause a transient rise in blood pressure. It can also produce a reddish color in urine and other body fluids for a few days (16).

#### *Sodium Thiosulfate*

Sodium thiosulfate (S2O<sup>3</sup> ) converts cyanide to thiocyanate (SCN) by the following *transulfuration reaction*:

$$S_2O_3 + CN \rightarrow SCN + SO_3$$
 (53.1)

Thiocyanate is then cleared by the kidneys. Thiosulfate can be used in combination with hydroxocobalamin (17), and the recommended dose is *12.5 grams IV* (diluted in 50 mL sterile water) (18). However, thiosulfate is not recommended in patients with renal failure because *thiocyanate is a neurotoxin that can accumulate in renal failure and cause an acute psychosis* (14),

#### *Nitrites*

Nitrites enhance cyanide clearance by promoting the formation of methemoglobin (Hb-Fe3+), which combines with cyanide to form cyanmethemoglobin: i.e.,

$$Hb-Fe^{3+} + CN \rightarrow Hb-Fe^{2+} - CN$$
 (53.2)

The hemoglobin-bound cyanide is eventually cleared by reacting with thiosulfate, which should be used in combination with nitrites. Unfortunately, nitrites have undesirable side effects, and *are contraindicated in smoke inhalation* (because methemoglobin promotes tissue hypoxia) (12). The only role for nitrites in cyanide poisoning is the use of inhaled amyl nitrite as a temporary measure when IV access is not available.

#### *Cyanide Antidote Kits*

There are two kits available for cyanide poisoning, but neither kit has all the antidotes.

- 1. The Cyanokit® (14) contains 5 grams of hydroxocobalamin as a powder, but has no diluent for IV administration, and has no repeat dose of hydroxocobalamin (14). There is also no thiosulfate or amyl nitrite in this kit.
- 2. The Cyanide Antidote Kit (18) contains 2 vials of sodium thiosulfate for injection: each vial contains 12.5 grams of sodium thiosulfate in 50 mL of sterile water. The kit also contains 12 ampules of 0.3 mL amyl nitrite for inhalation. Each inhalation should be for 15 sec, alternating with 15 sec of rest, and continued as long as needed. A new ampule should be used every 3 minutes.

It certainly would be advantageous if all the cyanide antidotes were available in a single kit.

## **TOXIC ALCOHOLS**

Ethylene glycol and methanol are common components of household, automotive, and industrial products, and they both produce toxic syndromes that are characterized by a metabolic acidosis. They are called *toxic alcohols* (19), but this is a misnomer, because it implies that ethanol is nontoxic.

### **Ethylene Glycol**

Ethylene glycol is the main ingredient in many automotive antifreeze and deicer products. It has a sweet, agreeable taste, which makes it a popular method of attempted suicide.

#### *Pathogenesis*

Ethylene glycol is readily absorbed from the GI tract, and 80% of the ingested dose is metabolized in the liver. The metabolism of ethylene glycol involves the formation of a series of acids, with the participation of alcohol dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase enzymes, *ending with the formation of oxalic acid* (see [Figure](#page-7-0) 53.3) (19). Each of the intermediate reactions involves the conversion of NAD to NADH, which promotes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate. As a result, serum lactate levels are also elevated in ethylene glycol poisoning (12). Each of the acid intermediates in ethylene glycol metabolism is a strong acid that readily dissociates, and can contribute to a metabolic acidosis. The oxalic acid also combines with calcium to form insoluble calcium oxalate crystals that precipitate in several tissues, and are particularly prominent in the renal tubules. These crystals are a source of renal tubular injury, and are visible on urine microscopy.

<span id="page-7-0"></span>![](_page_7_Figure_1.jpeg)

**FIGURE 53.3** The metabolism of ethylene glycol and methanol in the liver. AD = alcohol dehydrogenase, LDH = lactate dehydrogenase, FMP = fomepizole.

#### *Clinical Features*

Early signs of ethylene glycol intoxication include nausea, vomiting, and apparent inebriation (altered mental status, slurred speech, and ataxia). Because ethylene glycol is odorless, there is no odor of alcohol on the breath. Severe cases are accompanied by depressed consciousness, coma, generalized seizures, renal failure, pulmonary edema, and cardiovascular collapse (19). Renal failure can be a late finding (24 hours after ingestion).

Laboratory studies show a metabolic acidosis with an elevated anion gap (due to glycolic

acid and oxalic acid) and an elevated osmolal gap (See the latter part of Chapter 31 for a description of the osmolal gap.) Serum lactate levels can be elevated, and this can be misleading, as the high anion-gap metabolic acidosis may be mistakenly attributed to the elevated lactate levels.

Plasma assays are available for ethylene glycol and glycolic acid, but neither is readily available, and decisions about acute management are based on clinical judgment. However, plasma levels of ethylene glycol and glycolic acid should be obtained for confirmatory purposes. Plasma levels of ethylene glycol that are above 20 mg/dL are considered toxic (19), but plasma glycolic acid levels are more predictive of the severity of disease, and levels above 8 mmol/L have been proposed as an indication for hemodialysis (20).

**CRYSTALLURIA:** Calcium oxalate crystals can be visualized in the urine in about 50% of cases of ethylene glycol poisoning (21). The presence of calcium oxalate crystals is not specific for ethylene glycol poisoning, but the shape of the crystals is more specific; i.e., thin, monohydrate crystals, like the ones shown in [Figure](#page-8-0) 53.4, are more characteristic of ethylene glycol poisoning than the box-shaped dihydrate crystals (21). Most hospital laboratories do not routinely inspect urine for crystals, so make sure to request a search for crystals when a urine sample is sent to the laboratory.

<span id="page-8-0"></span>![](_page_8_Picture_3.jpeg)

**FIGURE 53.4** Microscopic appearance of calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals. The presence of these thin, needle-shaped crystals in the urine is highly suggestive of ethylene glycol poisoning.

#### *Treatment*

The management of ethylene glycol poisoning involves measures to alter the metabolism of ethylene glycol, along with hemodialysis, if necessary.

**FOMEPIZOLE:** Fomepizole inhibits alcohol dehydrogenase, the enzyme involved in the initial step of ethylene glycol metabolism (see [Figure](#page-7-0) 53.3). The recommended dosing regimen for both

ethylene glycol and methanol poisoning is shown in [Table](#page-9-0) 53.2 (19). The best results are obtained if therapy begins within 4 hours of ingestion. Fomepizole should be continued until the toxic alcohol levels in plasma have fallen to <20 mg/dL, and the metabolic acidosis has resolved.

#### <span id="page-9-0"></span>**TABLE 53.2 Dosing Regimen for Fomepizole**

- 1. Start with an IV loading dose of 15 mg/kg.
- 2. Follow with a dose of 10 mg/kg IV every 12 hrs for 4 doses.
- 3. If the toxic alcohol level is >20 mg/dL after 4 doses, increase the dose to 15 mg/kg IV every 12 hours, and continue until the following end-points are reached:
  - a. the toxic alcohol level is <20 mg/dL,
  - b. the plasma pH is normal,
  - c. the patient is asymptomatic.
- 4. If more than one hemodialysis session is required, change the dose to 15 mg/kg IV every 4 hrs, until dialysis is no longer necessary.

From Reference 19.

**HEMODIALYSIS:** The clearance of ethylene glycol and all its metabolites is enhanced by hemodialysis. The indications for immediate hemodialysis include severe acidemia (pH <7.1), and evidence of significant end-organ damage (e.g., coma, seizures, and renal insufficiency) (19). Multiple courses of hemodialysis may be necessary, and fomepizole dosing should be adjusted, as indicated in [Table](#page-9-0) 53.2.

**ADJUNCTS:** Thiamine (100 mg IV daily) and pyridoxine (100 mg IV daily) are recommended to divert glyoxylic acid to the formation of non-toxic metabolites (see [Figure](#page-7-0) 53.3).

#### **Methanol**

Methanol (also known as *wood alcohol* because it was first distilled from wood) is a common ingredient in shellac, varnish, paint remover or thinner, windshield washer fluid, and solid cooking fuel (e.g., Sterno® products).

#### *Pathogenesis*

Like ethylene glycol, methanol is readily absorbed from the upper GI tract, and is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver. The *principal metabolite is formic acid*, a strong acid that readily dissociates and produces a metabolic acidosis with a high anion gap (19). Formic acid is also a mitochondrial toxin that inhibits cytochrome oxidase and blocks oxidative energy production. Tissues that are particularly susceptible to damage are the retina, optic nerve, and basal ganglia. In one study, hypodense lesions in the basal ganglia were present on CT scan in 64% of patients with methanol poisoning (22). Methanol metabolism promotes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate in the same manner described for ethylene glycol metabolism, and lactate production is increased further by the toxic effects of formic acid.

#### *Clinical Features*

Early manifestations (within 6 hours of ingestion) include signs of apparent inebriation without

the odor of ethanol (as in ethylene glycol intoxication). Later signs (6–24 hours after ingestion) include visual disturbances (e.g., scotoma, blurred vision, complete blindness), depressed consciousness, coma, and generalized seizures (21). Examination of the retina can reveal papilledema and generalized retinal edema. The visual disturbances are characteristic of methanol poisoning, and are not a feature of ethylene glycol poisoning.

Laboratory studies show a metabolic acidosis, high anion gap, and high osmolal gap, similar to ethylene glycol poisoning. However, there is no crystalluria in methanol poisoning. A plasma assay for methanol is available, and a level above 20 mg/dL is considered toxic. However, the results of the plasma assay are not immediately available, and are not used in the decision to initiate therapy.

#### *Treatment*

Treatment for methanol poisoning is the same as described for ethylene glycol poisoning, except for the following: (a) visual impairment is an indication for dialysis in methanol poisoning and (b) folinic acid is used as adjunctive therapy in methanol poisoning, instead of thiamine and pyridoxine.

**FOLINIC ACID:** Folinic acid (leucovorin) can convert formic acid to non-toxic metabolites. The recommended dose is 1 mg/kg IV, up to 50 mg, at 4-hour intervals (21). Folic acid should be used if folinic acid is unavailable.

### **A FINAL WORD**

The following points in this chapter deserve emphasis:

- 1. Carbon monoxide poisoning can be missed if you rely on pulse oximetry readings to detect O<sup>2</sup> desaturation. Detection of elevated carboxyhemoglobin levels requires an 8-wavelength COoximeter, which is in most clinical laboratories.
- 2. A victim of smoke inhalation who has a severe lactic acidosis or hemodynamic instability should be treated empirically for cyanide poisoning.
- 3. Methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning should be considered in any patient who presents with a high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis of unclear etiology.
- 4. If ethylene glycol poisoning is a consideration, inspection of the urine for calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals can provide confirmatory evidence.
