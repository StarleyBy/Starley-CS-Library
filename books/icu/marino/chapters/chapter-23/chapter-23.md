# **Asthma and COPD in the ICU**

*Asthmatic distress calls for procedures which stimulate the sympathetic and dilate the bronchi.*

Lawrason Brown, MD (*[a](#page-14-0)*)

Admission to an ICU is an ominous sign for patients with acute exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). For COPD patients, one of every four will not survive the hospitalization, and 40% of the survivors will be readmitted within a year ([1\)](#page-14-1). And for patients with asthma, the need for mechanical ventilation has been identified as the strongest risk factor for death ([2\)](#page-14-2).

This chapter describes the management of acute exacerbations of asthma and COPD, including some relevant issues related to positive pressure ventilation in patients with severe airflow obstructions. As customary, the recommendations in this chapter will follow the most recent clinical practice guidelines, which are listed in the bibliography at the end of the chapter ([3–](#page-14-3)[6\)](#page-14-4).

One point of interest deserves mention before proceeding. The management of asthma and COPD is centered on dilating the airways with adrenergic agents, which is very similar to the statement in the introductory quote. The interesting point is that this statement was made almost 100 years ago, in 1931 (*a*). The significance of this is left to the judgment of the reader.

# **BASICS**

# **Monitoring Airway Obstruction**

The management of obstructive airways disease is guided by the severity of obstruction in the airways.

#### *Clinical Evaluation*

During acute exacerbations of asthma or COPD, *the clinical examination is often unreliable for determining the severity of airway obstruction* ([7\)](#page-14-5). There are usually signs of respiratory distress, including tachycardia, tachypnea, use of accessory muscles of respiration, and inability to

complete sentences without taking a breath, and there may be altered mentation and pulsus paradoxus (i.e., an inspiratory drop in systolic pressure >12 mm Hg). However, none of these clinical findings is sensitive or specific for severe airways obstruction, and more objective measures are recommended [\(3](#page-14-3)).

### *Measures of Peak Expiratory Flow*

For spontaneously breathing patients, a readily obtainable bedside measure of airway obstruction is the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) ([3\)](#page-14-3). The PEFR varies with age, gender, and height, and measurements are typically expressed as "% predicted" (observed result/predicted result × 100), with the predicted values derived from standard reference equations. (Appendix 2 contains tables of the predicted PEFR for age, gender, and height.) The correlations between the % predicted values and the severity of airway obstruction are shown below [\(3](#page-14-3)).

| %<br>Predicted<br>PEFR | Severity<br>of<br>Obstruction |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| ≥70%                   | Mild                          |
| 40–69%                 | Moderate                      |
| <40%                   | Severe                        |

In general, a PEFR <200 L/min indicates severe airways obstruction, and hypercapnia does not occur until the PEFR falls below 25% of predicted [\(8](#page-14-6)).

**LIMITATION:** The PEFR is effort-dependent, and accurate measurements requires a maximum inspiratory effort (to total lung capacity) followed by a maximum expiratory effort (to residual lung volume). Patients with acute exacerbations of asthma and COPD are typically unable to perform these maneuvers because of respiratory distress, and monitoring PEFR has not been popular in the acute care setting ([9\)](#page-14-7). However, after the respiratory distress subsides, periodic measurements of the PEFR can be used to monitor the course of the illness.

#### *Intrinsic PEEP*

One of the consequences of severe airflow obstruction is the inability to fully exhale the volume of air that is inhaled. The retained volume causes hyperinflation of the lungs and a positive pressure in the alveoli at the end of expiration. This positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), which is called *intrinsic PEEP*, is a reflection of the severity of airflow obstruction, and it can be monitored during mechanical ventilation. Intrinsic PEEP is described in more detail later in the chapter.

# **Aerosol Drug Delivery**

Aerosolized bronchodilators are the backbone of management for obstructive airways disease, and there are three devices used to generate these aerosols: the *nebulizer*, the *metered-dose inhaler*, and the *dry powder inhaler*. There are three types of nebulizers (jet, mesh, and ultrasonic nebulizers), but the description here is limited to the jet nebulizer (the traditional device). The design of a jet nebulizer and a metered dose inhaler is shown in [Figure](#page-3-0) 23.1. (*Note:* Dry powder inhalers are rarely used for life-threatening airways obstruction, and are not described here.)

### *Jet Nebulizer*

The pneumatic or jet nebulizer uses the same principle as an air-entrainment mask. A highpressure gas source (e.g., 50 psi from a wall outlet) is passed through a narrow opening in the nebulizer, creating a high-velocity (jet) stream of gas that is passed over the opening of a narrow tube submerged in a drug solution. The gas jet draws the drug solution up the tube (by creating viscous drag) and then pulverizes the solution to create an aerosol spray that is inhaled by the patient. Small-volume jet nebulizers have a reservoir volume of 3–6 mL, and can completely aerosolize the reservoir volume in less than 10 minutes [\(10](#page-14-8)). Large-volume nebulizers have a reservoir volume >200 mL, and are used for continuous aerosol therapy (see later).

**LUNG DEPOSITION:** Although small-volume nebulizers can completely aerosolize a drug solution, only a fraction of the drug aerosol reaches the lungs. This is demonstrated in [Table](#page-2-0) 23.1, which shows the distribution of aerosolized albuterol with different aerosol generator systems (11). When the nebulizer is used, most of the drug aerosol impacts on the delivery apparatus or is exhaled, and only 12% of the intended dose reaches the lungs. Inefficient drug delivery is characteristic of aerosol drug therapy, and is not specific for the jet nebulizer.

From Reference 11. MDI = metered dose inhaler. The MDI dose of 200 μg is equivalent to 2 puffs.

#### *Metered Dose Inhaler*

A metered dose inhaler (MDI) operates like a canister of hair spray. The MDI has a pressurized canister that contains a drug solution with a boiling point below room temperature. When the canister is squeezed between the thumb and fingers, a valve opens that releases a fixed volume of the drug solution. The liquid immediately vaporizes when it emerges from the canister, and a liquid propellant in the solution creates a high velocity spray.

**LUNG DEPOSITION:** The spray generated by an MDI has a velocity in excess of 30 meters per second (over 60 miles per hour) (12), and when delivered directly into the mouth, most of the spray impacts on the posterior wall of the oropharynx (called "inertial impaction"), and is not inhaled. The data in [Table](#page-2-0) 23.1 shows that 80% of the aerosolized drug is deposited in the oropharynx, and only 9% reaches the lungs. Drug deposition in the lungs can be increased by adding a holding chamber or "spacer" between the MDI and the mouth, which reduces the spray velocity. This is confirmed by the data in [Table](#page-2-0) 23.1, which shows a more than two-fold increase in the inhaled drug spray when a spacer was used with the MDI. *Spacers are recommended for all bronchodilator treatments that use MDIs* ([10\)](#page-14-8).

**FIGURE 23.1** Aerosol generators used to deliver bronchodilator drugs by inhalation. See text for explanation.

#### *Nebulizer vs. Metered-Dose Inhaler*

Bronchodilator treatments with nebulizers and MDIs produce equivalent results despite a marked difference in drug dosage. This is demonstrated in [Figure](#page-4-0) 23.2 which shows a comparison of the bronchodilator responses to three treatments with albuterol given by nebulizer or MDI (with spacer) in patients with acute exacerbation of asthma (13). Note the similarity in bronchodilator responses with nebulizers and MDIs, despite a 7-fold difference between the nebulizer dose (2.5 mg) and the MDI dose (0.36 mg, or 4 puffs). Adjusting for the inhaled dose (from the percentages in [Table](#page-2-0) 23.1) yields an albuterol dose of 12% of 2.5 mg (300 μg) for the nebulizer, and 20% of 0.36 mg (72 μg) for the MDI, which is a 4-fold difference in the inhaled drug dosage. This dose-response discrepancy is unexplained.

**FIGURE 23.2** Comparison of the bronchodilator response to albuterol given by nebulizer or metered-dose inhaler (MDI) in patients with acute exacerbation of asthma. Three treatments were given at 30-minute intervals, using doses indicated in the upper right portion of the graph. FEV<sup>1</sup> = forced expiratory volume in one second. Data from Reference 16.

### *Mechanical Ventilation*

During mechanical ventilation, aerosolized albuterol is delivered through the inspiratory arm of the ventilator tubing using a nebulizer or MDI with spacer. Unfortunately, aerosol deposition in the lungs is impaired further during mechanical ventilation, thanks to condensation on the ventilator tubing and endotracheal tube (14). Aerosol deposition in the lungs can be enhanced by decreasing the inspiratory flow rate and increasing the duration of inspiration (15).

Despite less aerosol deposition in the lungs during mechanical ventilation, the dose of aerosolized albuterol is the same for spontaneous breathing patients and during mechanical ventilation (see later for the doses). And once again, there is no difference in bronchodilator responses with nebulizers or MDIs (16).

#### *Which Method is Preferred?*

MDIs (with spacers) are generally preferred because of the lower drug dose, which minimizes side effects. Some people have difficulty coordinating their breathing with drug release from the MDI, but the introduction of breath-actuated MDIs should eliminate this problem. Nebulizers are preferred for acute exacerbations of asthma and COPD, but a switch to MDIs is initiated when the condition stabilizes

# **ACUTE EXACERBATION OF ASTHMA**

The flow diagram in [Figure](#page-6-0) 23.3 summarizes the early management of adults with acute exacerbation of asthma, and is from the National Asthma Education Program [\(1](#page-14-1)). This protocol is based on objective measures of airway obstruction (e.g., peak expiratory flow rate), but clinical measures of disease severity (e.g., tachycardia, use of accessory muscles, etc.) are also

suitable (17,18). Note that a normal arterial PCO<sup>2</sup> (PaCO<sup>2</sup> = 42 mm Hg) despite bronchodilator treatments warrants admission to the ICU. This is explained by the minute ventilation, which is increased (often doubled) in acute asthma, and would normally result in a decrease in PaCO<sup>2</sup> Therefore, a normal PaCO<sup>2</sup> in the face of a high minute ventilation represents CO<sup>2</sup> retention, and is a sign of severe airway obstruction.

The following is a description of the recommended drugs and dosing regimens for acute exacerbations of asthma. These are summarized in [Table](#page-7-0) 23.2

# **Short-Acting β2-Agonists**

The favored bronchodilators are drugs that stimulate β<sup>2</sup> receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, and aerosol delivery is preferred because it is more effective than oral (19) or intravenous (20) drug delivery, and has fewer side effects. Short-acting β<sup>2</sup> -agonists (SABAs) are preferred for acute exacerbations of asthma, while long-acting β-agents are favored for maintenance therapy.

*Albuterol* is the most widely used SABA for acute exacerbations of asthma ([3\)](#page-14-3). Aerosolized albuterol has a rapid onset of action (less than 5 minutes), with a peak effect at 15–60 minutes, and a duration of 2–5 hours (21). *Levalbuterol* is the R-enantiomer of albuterol (a more active form of the drug) that is equally effective at half the dose. However, clinical studies have not shown an advantage with levalbuterol over albuterol ([1,](#page-14-1)17).

### *Aerosol Regimens*

The following regimens of aerosolized albuterol are recommended for acute exacerbations of asthma ([3,](#page-14-3)17,18):

- 1. The initial treatment involves up to three 20-minute treatments using 2.5 to 5 mg albuterol by nebulizer or 4–8 puffs (90 μg per puff) by MDI with a spacer. Nebulizer delivery is favored for patients with severe airflow obstruction ([3\)](#page-14-3), although there is no evidence that nebulizers produce better bronchodilator responses than MDIs (22).
- 2. If further therapy is needed, albuterol can be given hourly for up to 3 hours, or can be given by continuous nebulization using doses of 5–15 mg/hr. Continuous aerosol therapy is popular, and may be more effective than intermittent aerosol therapy in patients with severe airflow obstruction (23).
- 3. For patients who are admitted to the hospital, albuterol (2.5–5 mg by nebulizer or 4–8 puffs by MDI) is given every 4–6 hours for the duration of the hospital stay.

**FIGURE 23.3** Flow diagram showing the early management of acute exacerbations of asthma, as recommended in the National Asthma Education Program ([3\)](#page-14-3). PEFR = peak expiratory flow rate.

### *Parenteral Therapy*

For the rare asthmatic patient who does not tolerate bronchodilator aerosols (usually because of excessive coughing) parenteral therapy can be given using subcutaneous *epinephrine* (0.3 to 0.5 mg every 20 minutes for 3 doses) or subcutaneous *terbutaline* (0.25 mg every 20 minutes for 3 doses) ([3\)](#page-14-3).

## *Side Effects*

Aggressive aerosol therapy with SABAs can produce a number of side effects, including tachycardia, tremors, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, and elevated plasma lactate levels (24–26). The decrease in serum potassium is the result of a βreceptor-mediated shift of potassium into cells. The source of the elevated lactate levels is likely to be an increase in the metabolic rate, and not anaerobic metabolism (26).

# **Anticholinergic Agents**

Anticholinergic agents offer only marginal benefits in acute asthma, and are used in combination with a SABAs for severe exacerbations, and only for the first 3–4 hours of therapy [\(3](#page-14-3),27).

The only anticholinergic agent approved for use in asthma is *ipratropium bromide,* a derivative of atropine that blocks muscarinic receptors in the airways. The dose in acute asthma is 0.5 mg (which can be mixed with albuterol in the nebulizer) every 20 minutes for 3 doses, then

as needed, or 8 puffs (18 μg per puff) by MDI every 20 min as needed, for up to 3 hours ([3\)](#page-14-3). Systemic absorption is minimal, and there is little risk of anticholinergic side effects (e.g., tachycardia, dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention). Ipratropium has no proven benefit beyond the first few hours of management, and it *should be discontinued in patients who are admitted for continued asthma management* [\(3](#page-14-3)).

# **Corticosteroids**

Corticosteroids are considered a staple in the management of both acute and chronic asthma because of their anti-inflammatory effects. Clinical studies have shown that corticosteroids can hasten the resolution of acute asthma and reduce the risk of relapses (28), although not all studies show a benefit from corticosteroids in acute asthma (29,30). The following observations about steroid therapy in asthma deserve mention:

- 1. There is no difference in efficacy between oral and intravenous steroids (28,31).
- 2. The beneficial effects of steroids are often not apparent until 12 hours after therapy is started (31), so steroid therapy will not influence the clinical course of asthma in the emergency department.
- 3. There is no apparent dose-response curve for steroids (31), and no evidence that doses above 100 mg of prednisone daily (or equivalent doses of other steroids) provide added benefit in acute asthma (28).
- 4. A 10-day course of steroids can be stopped abruptly without a tapering dose (28,32).

### *Regimen in Acute Asthma*

The National Asthma Education Program includes the following recommendations for corticosteroid therapy in acute exacerbations of asthma [\(3](#page-14-3)).

- 1. Steroids are recommended for all patients who do not show a satisfactory response after one or two bronchodilator treatments.
- 2. Oral steroids are recommended for patients who can tolerate oral medications.
- 3. The recommended dose is 40–80 mg daily of *prednisone* (for oral therapy) or *methylprednisolone* (for intravenous therapy) in one or two divided doses, which is continued until there is evidence of satisfactory resolution.
- 4. Inhaled corticosteroids can be started at any time during treatment of an acute exacerbation of asthma, and are continued after systemic steroids are discontinued, to reduce the risk of relapses.

#### *Mechanism of Action?*

The beneficial effects of steroids in acute asthma are attributed to their anti-inflammatory actions. However, the comparative features of corticosteroids in [Table](#page-9-0) 23.3 indicates that *dexamethasone is the most potent anti-inflammatory corticosteroid* (33), yet it is not recommended for the treatment of asthma. This raises questions about the actions of steroids in asthma (as well as the numerous other inflammatory conditions where steroids other than dexamethasone are recommended).

# **Adjunctive Measures**

The following measures can be helpful when acute asthma does dot resolve after initial bronchodilator therapy.

### *Magnesium*

Magnesium has mild bronchodilator effects (possibly as a result of calcium channel blockade), and intravenous magnesium (2 grams MgSO<sup>4</sup> infused over 15–30 minutes) can hasten the resolution of acute asthma when the response to albuterol, ipratropium, and steroids is not satisfactory (34). Clinical studies of inhaled magnesium (150 mg MgSO<sup>4</sup> ) have produced inconsistent results (35), and the inhaled route is not currently advised.

#### *Ketamine*

Sedation can be beneficial by reducing the respiratory rate, which will reduce the tendency for air trapping and hyperinflation of the lungs (see later for a description of air trapping). Sedation with ketamine also provides some bronchodilation, and there are several reports of ketamine facilitating the resolution of acute asthma in patients who were refractory to initial bronchodilatory therapy (36). The effective dose is 0.1–0.2 mg/kg IV as a loading dose, followed by a continuous infusion at 0.15–0.25 mg/kg/hr (for 1 to 5 hours) (36). Reported side effects include dysphoria, hallucinations, and increased secretions.

# **Oxygen Therapy**

Hypoxemia is common in severe exacerbations of asthma, and supplemental O<sup>2</sup> should be used to maintain the arterial O<sup>2</sup> saturation (SaO<sup>2</sup> ) at ≥90%. Conventional O<sup>2</sup> delivery systems can provide O<sup>2</sup> at rates up to 15 L/min, but inspiratory flow rates in acute asthma can exceed 60 L/min, so a high-flow nasal O<sup>2</sup> system (which delivers heated and humidified O<sup>2</sup> at rates of 40– 60 L/min) may be necessary to correct hypoxemia. (High-flow nasal O<sup>2</sup> systems are described in Chapter 25.)

# **Noninvasive Ventilation**

The most severe cases of acute asthma are accompanied by hypercapnia, and these cases may require a trial of noninvasive ventilation with "bilevel positive airway pressure" (BiPAP), which is described in Chapter 26. Failure of BiPAP to lower the arterial PCO<sup>2</sup> is often an indication for

# **ACUTE EXACERBATION OF COPD**

Acute exacerbations of COPD are most often the result of a respiratory infection, a covert pulmonary embolus, or left-sided heart failure ([5\)](#page-14-9); in some cases, a precipitating event is never identified. Exacerbations that warrant ICU admission are typically those with hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure, with progressive hypercapnia that may depress mentation.

The management of COPD exacerbations, other than treating any underlying cause, is centered on bronchodilators and corticosteroids, very much like the management of acute asthma. This is a curious approach, since *COPD is characterized by a lack of bronchodilator responsiveness on pulmonary function tests* ([5\)](#page-14-9).

# **Bronchodilator Therapy**

The same bronchodilators used in acute asthma are recommended for acute exacerbations of COPD, but the dosing regimens differ, as shown in [Table](#page-10-0) 23.4. Ipratropium is used as combination therapy when the response to short-acting β<sup>2</sup> -agonists is less than satisfactory, although at least three clinical studies do not support this practice (37).

# **Corticosteroids**

Corticosteroid therapy is associated with a faster recovery and fewer treatment failures in acute exacerbations of COPD [\(5](#page-14-9)). *At least 9 patients must be treated with corticosteroids to avoid one treatment failure* (38), but on the other hand, *a steroid-related adverse event occurs once in every 6 patients treated* (38). However, since an adverse effect of steroids (e.g., hyperglycemia) is likely to be less troublesome than a treatment failure, the risk/benefit ratio is in favor of steroid therapy.

The recommended steroid regimen for COPD exacerbations is 40 mg prednisone (or equivalent doses of other steroids) daily for 5 days ([5\)](#page-14-9). The intravenous route offers no

advantage over the oral route ([5,](#page-14-9)38,39).

# **Antibiotics**

Airways infections are common triggers for COPD exacerbations, but only about 50% are caused by treatable bacterial infections (40), and this limits the benefit of antimicrobial therapy.

### *Indications*

The most current clinical practice guidelines [\(5](#page-14-9)) recommend antibiotic therapy for the following conditions (other than pneumonias): an increase in sputum production, grossly purulent sputum, or the need for noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation. The latter conditions apply to most ICU admissions for exacerbations of COPD, so it is reasonable to assume that *all ICU admissions for acute exacerbations of COPD are candidates for antibiotic therapy*.

## *Empiric Treatment*

Sputum cultures are problematic in COPD because the same organisms are often isolated during stable periods and in acute exacerbations (41). Common isolates include *Hemophilus influenzae* and *Streptococcus pneumoniae* (41), as well as gram-negative enteric organisms (e.g., *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*) in ventilator-dependent patients (42). Empiric coverage for both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens (e.g., cefepime)seems wise for ICU patients, and the recommended duration of antibiotic coverage is 5–7 days [\(5](#page-14-9)).

# **Oxygen Therapy**

In cases of severe COPD with chronic hypercapnia, high concentrations of inhaled O<sup>2</sup> can promote further increases in arterial PCO<sup>2</sup> . This was originally attributed to loss of hypoxic ventilatory drive (43), but more recent studies have shown that the oxygen-induced rise in arterial PCO<sup>2</sup> is not accompanied by a decrease in ventilatory drive (44). Oxygen unloading of CO<sup>2</sup> from hemoglobin (i.e., the Haldane Effect) may play a role in this phenomenon. Regardless of the mechanism, it is important to avoid high concentrations of inhaled O<sup>2</sup> in patients with chronic CO<sup>2</sup> retention. The goal of oxygen therapy in COPD exacerbations is an arterial O<sup>2</sup> saturation (SaO<sup>2</sup> ) of 88–92% (and no higher) [\(5](#page-14-9)).

# **Noninvasive Ventilation**

Exacerbations of COPD with troublesome hypercapnia should be managed initially with noninvasive ventilation using "bilevel positive airway pressure" (BiPAP) (45), which is described in Chapter 26. Failure of BiPAP to reduce the arterial PCO<sup>2</sup> by 10 mm Hg after one hour is an indication for intubation and mechanical ventilation (46).

# **POSITIVE-PRESSURE VENTILATION**

Patients admitted to the ICU because of asthma or COPD often receive some form of positivepressure ventilatory assistance (either noninvasive measures like BiPAP or conventional mechanical ventilation), and the following are some important considerations related to positive

pressure breathing in these patients.

# **Dynamic Hyperinflation**

During spontaneous breathing in normal subjects, the volume of air (or gas) inhaled is completely exhaled before the end of expiration. In this situation, there is no expiratory airflow at the end of expiration, so the pressure in the distal airspaces is equivalent to atmospheric (zero reference) pressure. This is illustrated in the lower pressure-volume loop in [Figure](#page-12-0) 23.4. In patients with severe airways obstruction from asthma or COPD, exhalation is prolonged, and is not completed before the next inhalation. This results in hyperinflation, called *dynamic hyperinflation*, and the trapped gas in the distal airspaces creates a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), which is called *intrinsic PEEP* or *auto-PEEP* (47). This is illustrated by the upper pressure-volume loop on [Figure](#page-12-0) 23.4. In this situation, breathing occurs on a flatter portion of the pressure volume curve, which means that the respiratory muscles must generate a higher transpulmonary pressure to draw a given volume of air into the lungs. This increases the work of breathing in patients with severe airflow obstruction. (If you want to feel what it is like to breathe in a hyperinflated state, take a deep breath, and try breathing from there.)

**FIGURE 23.4** Pressure-volume curves showing the effects of severe airways obstruction on lung volumes and transpulmonary pressures. The hysteresis loops show the pressure and volume changes during inspiration (I) and expiration (E) for a single breath, See text for further explanation.

### **Positive Pressure Ventilation**

The positive intrathoracic pressures created by positive-pressure ventilation will be increased in the presence of dynamic hyperinflation and intrinsic PEEP (because you are starting at a higher

pressure). In addition, positive-pressure ventilation can aggravate the hyperinflation (by delivering high inflation volumes or rapid rates) (48), and this will produce further increases in intrathoracic pressure. The elevated intrathoracic pressures can have two adverse consequences: (a) the increase in peak intrathoracic pressure promotes *barotrauma* (e.g., pneumothorax), and (b) the increase in mean intrathoracic pressure can impede venous return to the heart. The following measures can help to reduce the risk of these adverse consequences.

### *Monitoring*

Dynamic hyperinflation can be detected by monitoring the flow waveforms during mechanical ventilation, as illustrated in [Figure](#page-13-0) 23.5. The normal flow waveforms in the upper panel show that the expiratory flow ceases before the next lung inflation, while the flow waveforms in the lower panel show that expiratory flow is continuing when the next lung inflation is delivered. *The presence of expiratory flow at the end of expiration is evidence of dynamic hyperinflation*.

<span id="page-13-0"></span>![](_page_13_Figure_3.jpeg)

**FIGURE 23.5** Flow waveforms during positive pressure mechanical ventilation. The waveforms in the lower panel show continuing expiratory flow at the end of expiration (indicated by the arrows), which indicates the presence of dynamic hyperinflation and intrisic PEEP. I = inspiration, E = expiration.

**INTRINSIC PEEP:** When there is evidence of dynamic hyperinflation on the flow waveforms, the severity of the problem can be evaluated by monitoring the level of intrinsic PEEP. (The measurement of intrinsic PEEP is described in Chapter 28.) *The intrinsic PEEP level is a reflection of the severity of airways obstruction in patients with asthma and COPD*.

# **Ventilator Strategies**

The following adjustments are designed to limit dynamic hyperinflation (and the adverse consequences of high intrathoracic pressures) during mechanical ventilation:

- 1. Avoid inflation volumes that exceed 6–8 mL/kg.
- 2. Maximize the time allowed for exhalation by: (a) slowing a rapid breathing rate with sedation, if possible, and (b) increasing the inspiratory flow rate, if needed, so that lung inflation accounts for only one-third of the respiratory cycle.

The management of hyperinflation and intrinsic PEEP during mechanical ventilation is described further in Chapter 28.

# **A FINAL WORD**

# **Keeping it Simple**

The management of patients admitted to the ICU because of severe exacerbations of asthma or COPD can be summarized as follows:

- 1. Give bronchodilators and corticosteroids to all patients, plus antibiotics for patients with severe COPD.
- 2. If the condition is severe or progresses despite the above measures, use noninvasive ventilation if possible, and conventional mechanical ventilation if necessary.

That's about it.
