# **Units and Conversions**

The units of measurements in the medical sciences are taken from the metric system (centimeter, gram, second) and the Anglo-Saxon system (foot, pound, second). The metric units were introduced during the French Revolution and were revised in 1960. The revised units are called Système Internationale (SI) units and are currently the worldwide standard.

## **PART 1 Converting Units of Solute Concentration**

1. For ions that exist freely in an aqueous solution, the concentration is expressed as milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L). To convert to millimoles per liter (mmol/L):

$$\frac{\text{mEq/L}}{\text{valence}} = \text{mmol/L}$$

- a. For a univalent ion like potassium (K+), the concentration in mmol/L is the same as the concentration in mEq/L.
- b. For a divalent ion like magnesium (Mg++), the concentration in mmol/L is one-half the concentration in mEq/L.
- 2. For ions that are partially bound or complexed to other molecules (e.g., plasma Ca++), the concentration is usually expressed as milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). To convert to mEq/L:

$$\frac{\text{mg/dL} \times 10}{\text{mol wt}} \times \text{valence} = \text{mEq/L}$$

where mol wt is molecular weight, and the factor 10 is used to convert deciliters (100 mL) to liters.

EXAMPLE: Ca++ has a molecular weight of 40 and a valence of 2, so a plasma Ca++ concentration of 8 mg/dL is equivalent to:

$$(8 \times 10/40) \times 2 = 4 \text{ mEq/L}$$

## **PART 2 Converting Units of Solute Concentration**

3. The concentration of uncharged molecules (e.g., glucose) is also expressed as milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). To convert to (mmol/L):

$$\frac{\text{mg/dL} \times 10}{\text{mol wt}} = \text{mmol/L}$$

EXAMPLE: Glucose has a molecular weight of 180, so a plasma glucose concentration of 90 mg/dL is equivalent to: (90 × 10/180) = 5 mmol/L.

4. The concentration of solutes can also be expressed in terms of osmotic pressure, which determines the distribution of water in different fluid compartments. Osmotic activity in aqueous solutions (called osmolality) is expressed as milliosmoles per kg water (mosm/kg H2O or mosm/kg).

The following formulas can be used to express the osmolality of solute concentrations (n is the number of nondissociable particles per molecule).

mmol/L x n = mosm/kg
$$\frac{\text{mEq/L}}{\text{valence}} \times \text{n} = \text{mosm/kg}$$

$$\frac{\text{mg/dL} \times 10}{\text{valence}} \times \text{mosm/kg}$$

### EXAMPLE:

a. A plasma Na+ concentration of 140 mEq/L has the following osmolality:

$$\frac{140}{1}$$
 × 1 = 140 mosm/kg

b. A plasma glucose concentration of 90 mg/dL has the following osmolality:

$$\frac{90 \times 10}{180} \times 1 = 5 \text{ mosm/kg}$$

The sodium in plasma has a much greater osmotic activity than the glucose in plasma because osmotic activity is determined by the number of particles in solution, and is independent of the size of the particles (i.e., one sodium ion has the same osmotic activity as one glucose molecule).
