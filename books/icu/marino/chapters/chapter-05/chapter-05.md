# **Venous Thromboprophylaxis**

*Two words best characterize the mortality and morbidity due to venous thromboembolism in the United States: substantial and unacceptable.*

Kenneth M. Moser, MD (*[a](#page-12-0)*)

To supplement Dr. Moser's statement, venous thromboembolism (i.e., deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) has four "alliterative" attributes: i.e., it is common, often covert, can be catastrophic, but is correctable. The risk of venous thromboembolism is almost universal in the patients who inhabit medical and surgical ICUs. Thrombus formation is most prominent in the major veins that drain the lower extremities (i.e., the femoral and iliac veins), and it often remains clinically silent until a portion (or all) of the thrombus breaks free and travels to the lungs to become a pulmonary embolus, which can be a life-threatening and even fatal event. Fortunately, there are a variety of preventive measures that can reduce or eliminate the risk of this life-endangering process.

Venous thromboembolism has been cited as the leading cause of preventable deaths in hospitalized patients, and preventive measures thus become "the number one priority for improving patient safety in hospitals" ([1\)](#page-12-1). This chapter addresses this mandate by describing the various methods used to prevent venous thromboembolism (i.e., *venous thromboprophylaxis*), and which methods work best in different clinical situations. Many of the recommendations in this chapter are taken from the clinical practice guidelines and reviews listed at the end of the chapter [\(2](#page-12-2)–11). (*Note:* The diagnosis and treatment of venous thromboembolism are described in Chapter 22.)

# **RISK FACTORS**

There are a wide variety of risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in hospitalized patients, and these are organized in [Table](#page-1-0) 5.1. The expression of these risk factors in different groups of patients is shown in [Figure](#page-2-0) 5.1 (9).

# **Major Surgery**

Major surgery (i.e., surgery performed under general or spinal anesthesia that lasts longer than 45 minutes) is the most recognized cause of VTE in hospitalized patients, and is responsible for about one-third of deaths from VTE [\(4](#page-12-3)). All major surgical procedures create a heightened risk of VTE, which can persist for 6–12 weeks (i.e., after hospital discharge) (11). The risk is particularly high with cancer-related surgery ([2,](#page-12-2)[4,](#page-12-3)10), bariatric surgery [\(3](#page-12-4)), and orthopedic procedures involving the hip and knee ([2,](#page-12-2)[5\)](#page-12-5).

The risk of VTE after major surgery is attributed to several factors, including thromboplastin release during the procedure (which produces a hypercoagulable state that lasts for days), inflammation (from prolonged procedures), vascular injury (especially in orthopedic and peripheral vascular procedures) and extended periods of bed rest in the perioperative period.

## **Major Trauma**

The risk of VTE is highest following major or multisystem trauma, where the reported incidence of DVT is 58% without prophylaxis (6). The trauma conditions with the highest risk of VTE are brain and spinal cord injuries, spinal fractures, and fractures of the pelvis, hip, and long bones of the legs. There are several factors that predispose to VTE in trauma, including thromboplastin release and inflammation from extensive tissue injury, vascular injury, long bone fractures (which release thrombogenic lipids into the circulation), and prolonged periods of immobility from lower extremity injuries.

#### **Acute Medical Illness**

Hospitalization for acute medical illness is associated with an eightfold increase in the risk of VTE (8). Although VTE is less common in medical patients than in surgical patients or trauma victims (see [Figure](#page-2-0) 5.1), medical patients account for a majority (50% to 75%) of VTE events in hospitalized patients (8). The conditions that create the highest risk of VTE are neoplastic diseases, acute stroke with weakness of the extremities, and right-sided heart failure with leg edema. (*Note:* COVID-19 is associated with a high risk of VTE, but this illness seems to have

subsided.)

#### **ICU Patients**

As mentioned earlier, a majority of ICU patients have one or more of the risk factors for VTE listed in [Table](#page-1-0) 5.1. There are also ICU-specific factors that add further to the risk of VTE, which include prolonged mechanical ventilation (>48 hrs.), systemic inflammatory conditions (e.g., sepsis), circulatory shock, vasopressor infusions, platelet transfusions, and the presence of central venous catheters or peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs).

**FIGURE 5.1** Risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) without thromboprophylaxis, in different groups of patients. Includes both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. From Reference 9.

## **Patient-Specific Factors**

Patient–specific risk factors for VTE include advanced age, obesity, pregnancy, personal or family history of VTE, and genetic predisposition to thrombosis (e.g., Factor V deficiency, antithrombin III deficiency). The factors that confer the highest risk of VTE include a prior history of VTE, and the genetic risk factors; e.g., inherited antithrombin III deficiency creates a 14-fold increase in the risk of VTE (11).

# **PARENTERAL PROPHYLACTIC REGIMENS**

A number of anticoagulant regimens have proven effective in reducing the incidence of VTE in hospitalized patients ([2–](#page-12-2)8), but the following considerations are needed before starting an

#### anticoagulant regimen:

- 1. Absolute contraindications include intracranial hemorrhage and "clinically important" bleeding, which is defined as blood loss associated with a decrease in systolic blood pressure ≥20 mm Hg, a decrease in hemoglobin ≥2 g/dL, or the need to transfuse at least 2 units of packed red blood cells.
- 2. Relative contraindications include traumatic head and spinal injury, a history of recurrent GI bleeding, and a severe coagulopathy (e.g., platelets <50,000).
- 3. Menstrual bleeding is not a contraindication to anticoagulant prophylaxis.

Anticoagulant prophylaxis is typically achieved by subcutaneous injection, using the drug regimens summarized in [Table](#page-3-0) 5.2.

## **Unfractionated Heparin (UFH)**

Heparin is a naturally occurring mucopolysaccharide that is made by mast cells in a wide variety of species, including humans. (Porcine intestines and bovine lungs have been the traditional sources of heparin.) Native or "unfractionated" heparin (UFH) is a heterogeneous collection of molecules that vary in size (molecular weight) from 3,000 to 30,000 Daltons (12), and this size variation has an important influence on anticoagulation produced by heparin, as described next.

#### *Mechanisms*

Heparin exerts its anticoagulant effect in two ways. First, it binds to antithrombin III (AT) in circulating blood, and this activates the AT and leads to inhibition of activated factor X (Xa), as shown in [Figure](#page-5-0) 5.2. Since factor Xa normally converts prothrombin to thrombin, the inhibition

of factor Xa ("anti-Xa" effect) inhibits the generation of thrombin. In addition to this action, the heparin molecule forms electrostatic bonds with thrombin, and this inhibits the ability of thrombin (factor IIa) to convert fibrinogen to fibrin. This "anti-IIa" effect is size-dependent (i.e., dependent on the length of the polysaccharide chain in the heparin molecule), and this explains why the size variation in UFH preparations produces a variable anticoagulant effect. Overall, the anti-IIa effect is 10 times greater than the anti-Xa effect (13), which is a testament to heparin's ability to form electrostatic bonds with other molecules.

Heparin's tendency for electrostatic binding extends to plasma proteins, endothelial cells, and macrophages. Heparin binding to plasma proteins reduces bioavailability, while heparin binding to endothelial cells and macrophages promotes clearance from the bloodstream. Variations in plasma protein levels add further to the variable anticoagulant effects of heparin.

**PLATELET BINDING:** Heparin binds to a protein (platelet factor 4) on platelets to form an antigenic complex that can trigger the formation of IgG antibodies. These antibodies can bind to platelets and trigger a platelet activation response, which leads to thrombosis and a consumptive thrombocytopenia. This *heparin-induced thrombocytopenia* is not a dose-dependent phenomenon, and can occur with the low doses of heparin used for thromboprophylaxis. (This condition is described in Chapter 13.)

#### *Prophylactic Dosing*

The activation of AT by heparin is a highly sensitive reaction, which means that low doses of heparin can inhibit thrombogenesis. *The dose of unfractionated heparin used for thromboprophylaxis is 5,000 units injected subcutaneously every 8–12 hours.* The 8-hour dosing schedule is popular for higher-risk situations, but most studies show no difference in efficacy (or risk of bleeding) with either regimen (14).

**OBESITY:** Standard doses of heparin are considered suboptimal in patients with obesity (body mass index or BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) because of the increased volume of drug distribution in obesity. As a result, higher doses of heparin have been recommended in obese patients, especially those with morbid obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2). A popular regimen for patients with morbid obesity is 7,500 units every 8 hours, which has proven to be more effective in preventing VTE than the standard low-dose regimen (15).

**FIGURE 5.2** Mechanisms of anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin (UFH), low-molecularweight heparin (LMWH) and the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). "X" denotes inhibition. See text for further explanation.

#### **Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin (LMWH)**

Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is produced by enzymatic cleavage of heparin molecules, which produces smaller molecules of more uniform size. (The average molecular weight of LMWH is 4,500 Daltons.) Like UFH, the LMWH molecules bind to AT and inhibit factor Xa (anti-Xa effect), but the shorter length of the molecules results in less binding to thrombin and reduces the anti-IIa effect (see [Figure](#page-5-0) 5.2). This reduces the variability of anticoagulation seen with UFH, and gives LMWH a more predictable dose-response profile. This predictability is why laboratory measures of anticoagulation are not monitored during therapy with LMWH.

#### *Other Advantages*

LMWH does not bind as readily to plasma proteins, endothelial cells, macrophages, and platelets as UFH, and this gives LMWH the following advantages (13):

- 1. As a result of reduced binding to plasma proteins, the bioavailability of LMWH is greater than that of UFH (90% vs 15–30%, respectively), which means that LMWH is a more potent anticoagulant than UFH (at equivalent doses).
- 2. Reduced binding to endothelial cells and macrophages gives LMWH a longer duration of action than UFH, and this translates to less frequent dosing with LMWH.
- 3. Reduced platelet binding by LMWH results in a lower risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia; i.e., the reported incidence of this complication is 0.2% with LMWH,

versus 2.6% with UFH (a ten-fold difference) (16).

In summary, *the advantages of LMWH over UFH include a more predictable and more potent anticoagulant response, less frequent dosing, and less risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia*.

#### *Prophylactic Regimens*

There are two LMWH preparations available for use in the United States: enoxaparin (Lovenox) and dalteparin (Fragmin), and [Table](#page-7-0) 5.3 shows the prophylactic dosing regimens for each of these agents.

**ENOXAPARIN:** Enoxaparin was the first LMWH approved for use in the United States (in 1993), and numerous clinical studies have shown it to be both safe and effective for thromboprophylaxis. *The standard dose for thromboprophylaxis is 40 mg given by subcutaneous injection once daily, or 30 mg given twice daily for higher-risk patients*. The following dose adjustments deserve mention:

- 1. Enoxaparin is cleared by the kidneys, and for patients with severe renal impairment (i.e., estimated creatinine clearance, or Cr CL, <30 mL/min), the standard prophylactic dose should be reduced to 30 mg once daily, or an alternative anticoagulant (e.g., UFH) should be used (17,18). The latter option seems to be the best choice when the Cr CL falls below 20 mL/min.
- 2. For morbid obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2) a dose of 40 mg every 12 hours has proven superior to standard prophylactic dosing (15). (See later for dosing adjustments related to bariatric surgery.)

Enoxaparin has proven to be both safe and effective for preventing VTE in all high-risk clinical settings (17), and it is more effective than UFH for orthopedic procedures involving the hip and knee [\(5](#page-12-5)), and in major trauma (6). It is currently the most popular agent for the prevention of VTE in hospitalized patients. (See later for recommendations in specific clinical settings.)

**DALTEPARIN:** The other LMWH, dalteparin, does not enjoy the popularity of enoxaparin, even though clinical studies have shown no difference in efficacy between dalteparin and enoxaparin for the prevention of VTE (18). *The prophylactic dose of dalteparin is 2,500–5,000 units given subcutaneously once daily.* Dalteparin has one notable advantage over enoxaparin; i.e., no dose reduction is required in patients with renal failure (19). The appropriate dose of dalteparin in obesity has not been adequately studied. One recommendation, based on an author's clinical experience, is a dose of 200 units/kg daily (actual body weight) (20).

#### *Monitoring Anti-Factor Xa Levels*

The adequacy of LMWH dosing can be evaluated by measuring the anti-factor Xa level in blood. This measure is not used routinely during LMWH therapy, but it can useful when the adequacy of fixed LMWH dosing is uncertain (e.g., in obesity). The recommended target range for prophylactic dosing is a peak anti-factor Xa level of 0.2–0.5 IU/mL (21).

#### **Fondaparinux**

Fondaparinux (also known as "tiny heparin") is a synthetic analog of the pentasaccharide sequence on heparin that binds it to antithrombin III (AT). It is the first selective factor Xa inhibitor approved for clinical use, and has proven effective for thromboprophylaxis in medical patients (22) and in orthopedic procedures involving the hip and knee (23). *The dose of fondaparinux for thromboprophylaxis is 2.5 mg by subcutaneous injection once daily.* Fondaparinux has a half life of 17 hrs (which allows once-daily dosing), and is excreted by the kidneys. In patients with moderate-to-severe renal impairment (Cr CL of 20–50 mL/min), a reduced dose of 1.5 mg daily is recommended (24,25), and the drug should not be used when the Cr CL is <20 mL/min.

#### *When to Use*

Fondaparinux is recommended (along with UFH and LMWH) for hospitalized medical patients who require thromboprophylaxis (7), but it is not popular, and has not been studied in critically ill (ICU) patients. Fondaparinux can also be used for prophylaxis in patients with suspected heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), or a prior history of HIT (26). While it has been used in patients with confirmed HIT, both with and without thrombosis (26), the approved treatment for HIT is argatroban. (For more on HIT, see Chapter 13.)

# **PROPHYLAXIS WITH ORAL AGENTS**

Thromboprophylaxis with oral agents is receiving increased interest as a result of the increase in extended prophylaxis after hospital discharge (see later). Warfarin was the original oral agent used for prophylaxis, but it is no longer favored because of the delayed onset of action (5–7 days), multiple drug interactions, and need for anticoagulation monitoring (with the INR). The newer oral anticoagulants, which include a direct thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran) and three direct factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban), have a more rapid onset of action (1–4 hours) and do not require routine monitoring of anticoagulation status. (The actions of these oral agents are depicted in [Figure](#page-5-0) 5.2.) These newer agents are collectively known as direct oral anticoagulants, or DOACs. At the present time, *prophylaxis with DOACs is recommended only for hip and knee replacement surgery* [\(2](#page-12-2)).

From References 27–29. Cr CL = creatinine clearance, INR = international normalized ratio.

The dosing recommendations for prophylaxis with oral anticoagulants are summarized in [Table](#page-7-0) 5.3, and some pertinent information about these agents is summarized below. (*Note:* Edoxaban is not included here because there is no approved dosage for thromboprophylaxis.)

- 1. DOACs are contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (see [Table](#page-7-0) 5.3); in this setting, warfarin is the only oral agent that can be used safely (27,28).
- 2. Standard prophylactic doses of apixaban and rivaroxaban are equally effective in morbidly obese patients (i.e., BMI ≥ 40 kg.m2 or wt. >120 kg) (29).
- 3. The absorption of DOACs may be adversely affected by gastric bypass surgery, and (until this matter is studied further), these agents should probably not be used for prophylaxis after this procedure (29).
- 4. All DOACs have proven superior to LMWH for thromboprophylaxis in hip and knee replacement surgery ([2,](#page-12-2)27,28), but dabigatran and rivaroxaban have shown higher bleeding rates than LMWH in some studies (28), and apixaban may be the favored DOAC for these procedures (27).
- 5. Rivaroxaban has been approved for thromboprophylaxis in patients with acute medical illness (30), but a meta-analysis of studies comparing DOACs and LMWHs in acutely ill medical patients shows equivalent efficacy but an increased risk of bleeding with DOACs (31).

The popularity of DOACs for venous thromboprophylaxis is very likely to skyrocket in the upcoming years, similar to what has happened with arterial thromboprophylaxis in atrial fibrillation (which is described in Chapter 19).

## **Aspirin**

Although antiplatelet agents are typically not used for venous thromboprophylaxis, the most recent guidelines from the American Society of Hematology includes a conditional recommendation for aspirin as an effective alternative to anticoagulants for hip or knee replacement surgery ([2\)](#page-12-2). Although a dose is not specified, most studies involved low-dose aspirin (81 mg daily). This recommendation was based on studies that often included aspirin in conjunction with anticoagulant therapy; e.g., using anticoagulants in the early postoperative period, followed by aspirin for extended prophylaxis after hospital discharge (32). Therefore, the use of aspirin as the sole prophylactic agent after hip or knee arthroplasty seems unwarranted.

#### **Neuraxial Procedures**

Anticoagulant prophylaxis can promote hematoma formation from spinal punctures, or from the insertion and removal of intrathecal and epidural catheters, and these hematomas can compress the spinal cord and produce paralysis. To limit the risk of this complication, anticoagulant

prophylaxis should be withheld before performing these procedures. The following are some guidelines for withholding anticoagulant prophylaxis before these procedures:

- 1. For subcutaneous injections of unfractionated heparin, wait at least 12 hours after the last dose, and for once daily dosing of enoxaparin, wait at least 24 hours (9).
- 2. For the DOACS, the recommended time for withholding anticoagulation is dependent on the renal function. With normal or moderately reduced renal function, the wait time is at least 48 hours for dabigatran and rivaroxaban, and at least 24 hours for apixaban (27). Longer wait times are recommended for more severe cases of renal impairment (see Reference 27 for wait times in relation to creatinine clearance).

# **MECHANICAL THROMBOPROPHYLAXIS**

External compression of the lower extremities can be used to promote venous outflow from the legs and reduce the risk of VTE from venous stasis. This method of *mechanical thromboprophylaxis* is typically used as a replacement for anticoagulant regimens in patients who are bleeding or have a high risk of bleeding, but it can also be used as an adjunct to anticoagulant prophylaxis in a high-risk clinical setting (see later). There are two methods of external leg compression: graded compression stockings and intermittent pneumatic compression.

#### **Graded Compression Stockings**

Graded compression stockings (GCS), also known as thromboembolism-deterrent or TED stockings, are designed to create 18 mm Hg external pressure at the ankles and 8 mm Hg external pressure in the thigh (33). The resulting 10 mm Hg pressure gradient acts as a driving force for venous outflow from the legs. These stockings have been shown to reduce the incidence of VTE when used alone after major surgery (34). However, they are the least effective method of thromboprophylaxis, and are never used as sole means of preventing VTE in hospitalized patients.

## **Intermittent Pneumatic Compression**

Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) has a dual antithrombotic effect because it promotes both venous flow and fibrinolysis (35). IPC devices typically have two or three inflatable bladders that are pressurized in sequence (from distal to proximal). The external leg pressure is about 35–40 mm Hg at the ankle, and 20 mm Hg at the thigh (33), and the compression cycle is typically 10 seconds (6 inflations per minute). (The applied pressure should never be greater than the diastolic blood pressure, to prevent arterial compression.) Venous outflow is enhanced not only by the pressure gradient along the leg, but also by the pumping action of the sequential bladder inflations.

The IPC method can be as effective as anticoagulant prophylaxis (36), and it also adds to the effectiveness of anticoagulant regimens (37). Therefore, it is no surprise that IPC is the standard method of mechanical prophylaxis in hospitalized patients. There are, however, a few shortcomings: i.e., the inflatable bladders restrict mobility and can macerate the skin, and the

repeated inflation and deflation of the bladders is often annoying for awake patients. Therefore, IPC should be discontinued as soon as it is no longer necessary.

#### **Inferior Vena Cava Filters**

Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters do not prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but they reduce the risk of pulmonary embolism (by trapping thrombi that break loose from DVT in the legs). These devices are occasionally used in patients with DVT who cannot be anticoagulated, but otherwise they are not recommended for VTE prophylaxis. IVC filters are described in Chapter 22.

# **WHICH REGIMEN FOR WHICH PATIENT?**

The following is a description of the recommended prophylactic regimens for specific clinical settings. Most of these recommendations are taken from the clinical practice guidelines listed at the end of the chapter [\(2](#page-12-2)–9). (When guidelines differ in their recommendations, the most recent guideline is usually chosen.) Please note the following specifics for these recommendations: (a) High-risk patients are those with a prior history of VTE, genetic risk factors for VTE, cancer, or multiple risk factors (e.g., advanced age, obesity, heart failure with leg edema); (b) The low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is enoxaparin.

## **Special Circumstances**

The following recommendations apply to all groups of patients or clinical settings:

- 1. For patients with renal failure (creatinine clearance <15 mL/min), the only anticoagulants that can be used are unfractionated heparin (UFH) and coumadin.
- 2. For patients with morbid obesity (BMI > 40 kg/m2), consider adjusting the dose of the heparins (UFH and LMWH), as shown in [Table](#page-3-0) 5.2.
- 3. For patients with suspected heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), or a prior history of HIT, fondaparinux can be used for prophylaxis (and has been used in confirmed cases of HIT).

## **Major General Surgery**

- 1. The most recent guidelines recommend UFH or LMWH, with intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) added in high-risk patients ([2\)](#page-12-2). Higher doses of UFH (5,000 units every 8 hours) and LMWH (enoxaparin, 30 mg twice daily) are popular for high-risk patients.
- 2. Prophylaxis can be started preoperatively, but the last doses of UFH and LMWH should be at least 6 hrs and 12 hrs (respectively) before the surgical procedure. Postoperative prophylaxis can begin 6 hours after surgery for UFH, and 12 hours after surgery for LMWH.
- 3. Prophylaxis is generally continued until full ambulation or hospital discharge, but for cancer surgery involving the abdomen and pelvis in high-risk patients, extended prophylaxis (with LMWH) for up to 4 weeks is favored (10).

# **Bariatric Surgery**

- 1. The American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery favors LMWH plus IPC for prophylaxis, with an enoxaparin dose of 40 mg twice daily for a BMI of 30–49 kg/m2, and 60 mg twice daily for a BMI ≥ 50 kg/m2 ([3\)](#page-12-4).
- 2. Following bariatric surgery, about 80% of postoperative VTEs occur after hospital discharge ([3\)](#page-12-4), so extended prophylaxis (with LMWH) is recommended for a total of about 2 weeks ([3\)](#page-12-4). (The duration of prophylaxis has not been adequately studied.)

#### **Orthopedic Surgery**

- 1. For hip or knee replacement surgery, a DOAC (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban) is favored over LMWH ([2\)](#page-12-2), with IPC added in the early postoperative period.
- 2. For hip *fracture* surgery, LMWH is recommended ([2,](#page-12-2)[5\)](#page-12-5). (DOACs have not been adequately studied in hip fracture surgery.)
- 3. For major surgery involving the hip and knee, extended prophylaxis is recommended for up to 35 days after the procedure [\(2](#page-12-2)[,5](#page-12-5)).

#### **Neurosurgery**

- 1. For major neurosurgical procedures, mechanical prophylaxis with IPC is recommended.
- 2. When the risk of postoperative bleeding has subsided, LMWH is added for high-risk patients, and for cancer-related surgery ([2\)](#page-12-2).

#### **Cardiac Surgery**

- 1. For uncomplicated cases of cardiac surgery, mechanical prophylaxis with IPC is recommended ([2,](#page-12-2)[5\)](#page-12-5).
- 2. For complicated cardiac surgery, or high-risk patients, LMWH is added to IPC ([5\)](#page-12-5).

## **Major Trauma**

- 1. For solid organ injury or trauma to the extremities, prophylaxis with LMWH (enoxaparin at a dose of 40 mg SC every 12 hrs) should be started when bleeding is not a concern, optimally 12–24 hours after the injury, and mechanical prophylaxis with IPC (if tolerated) is added in high-risk patients (6).
- 2. For traumatic brain injury, mechanical prophylaxis with IPC is used until the CT scan shows no bleeding, or progression of bleeding for 24 hours, then LMWH is added (enoxaparin at a dose of 30 mg SC every 12 hrs).
- 3. For spinal trauma, prophylaxis with LMWH (enoxaparin at a dose of 30 mg SC every 12 hrs) should be started as soon as anticoagulation is considered safe, while mechanical prophylaxis with IPC should be started as soon as possible, and continued along with the LMWH (6).
- 4. Monitoring anti-Xa levels is recommended in major trauma because of frequent variations in renal function.

#### **Acute Medical Illness**

1. For high-risk patients with an acute medical illness (including all ICU patients), prophylaxis with LMWH is recommended, without adding mechanical prophylaxis (7). Extended prophylaxis after hospital discharge is not recommended (7).

# **A FINAL WORD**

#### **Riddle Me This**

If immobility is a risk factor for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), then why isn't DVT rampant in elderly nursing home residents who are bed-bound with leg contractures, and why isn't perpetual DVT prophylaxis used in people with paraplegia?

The perception that immobility or prolonged bed rest is a risk factor for DVT is an offshoot of Virchow's Triad, which identifies venous stasis as one of the principal risk factors for thrombosis. However, immobility is not necessarily venous stasis. The cardiovascular system is a closed system, and according to the law of conservation of energy and matter, the volumetric flow will be the same in all regions of a closed system. So if the cardiac output is normal, the arterial and venous flows will be the same (cardiac output equals venous return) and there will be no venous stasis with immobility or prolonged bed rest.

What triggers DVT in many of the high-risk hospitalized patients is probably inflammation (other than vascular injury in trauma and orthopedic patients), since the inflammatory and coagulation systems are closely linked. This would explain why in cases of spinal cord injury that result in paraplegia, the risk of DVT is high only for 3–4 weeks following the injury. Thereafter, thromboprophylaxis is discontinued, which implies that prolonged immobility alone is not a risk factor for DVT.

Why is this important? Because the perception that immobility predisposes to DVT is very likely a source of excessive use of anticoagulants for thromboprophylaxis.
