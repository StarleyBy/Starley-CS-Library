# **Acute Stroke in the ICU**

*Disease makes men more physical, it leaves them nothing but body.*

Thomas Mann (*[a](#page-15-0)*)

The focus of this chapter is a cerebrovascular disorder that produces a variety of acute (and often devastating) neurologic deficits. It was first described over 2,400 years ago, and has suffered through a series of inappropriate names, including *acute brain suffering, apoplexy, stroke*, *cerebrovascular accident* (what accident?), and the most recent embarrassment, *brain attack*. Considering that this disorder is the second leading cause of death worldwide ([1\)](#page-15-1), it deserves a better name.

This chapter describes the management of ischemic strokes, as well as strokes caused by spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The focus is on management in the ICU, and not on decisions or treatments that occur when the stroke is first suspected (e.g., thrombolytic therapy), which is the purview of neurologists and emergency medicine specialists. Many of the recommendations in this chapter are based on the most recent clinical practice guidelines for each type of stroke [\(2](#page-15-2)[–5](#page-15-3)).

## **ISCHEMIC STROKE**

Ischemic strokes account for about 85% of all strokes. Most are the result of atherosclerotic plaques that rupture and trigger a thrombotic occlusion (similar to the pathogenesis of myocardial infarctions), but about 20% are *embolic strokes*. Most emboli are from the left side of the heart, but a small fraction of emboli begin as deep vein thrombosis in the legs, and reach the brain through a patent foramen ovale (see later).

This section describes the management of ischemic strokes after admission to the ICU, and includes general support measures, and special considerations in patients who have received thrombolytic therapy or mechanical thrombectomy. The general support measures that deserve attention are summarized in [Table](#page-1-0) 47.1.

## **Respiratory Support**

Decisions about respiratory support include both oxygenation and ventilation.

### *Oxygen*

Oxygen has two effects that can be deleterious in acute stroke. The first is oxygen's action as a vasoconstrictor in all major vascular beds except the lungs (where it acts as a vasodilator). For the cerebral circulation, inhalation of 100% O<sup>2</sup> results in a 15–30% decrease in cerebral blood flow ([6\)](#page-15-4). The second deleterious effect is the ability of oxygen to promote oxidative cell injury via the production of *reactive oxygen species* [\(7](#page-15-5)). These two actions would explain the study showing that maintaining an arterial O<sup>2</sup> saturation (SaO<sup>2</sup> ) above 94% has a negative impact on neurologic outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke [\(8](#page-15-6)).

**RECOMMENDATION:** The recent guidelines on stroke management recommend supplemental O<sup>2</sup> only in patients who are hypoxemic ([2\)](#page-15-2). However, the same guidelines also state that the SaO<sup>2</sup> should be kept above 94% ([2\)](#page-15-2), which is above the hypoxemic level (i.e., <90%), and is at the same level that was associated with worse neurologic outcomes in the study mentioned previously ([8\)](#page-15-6). Therefore, it seems wise to *maintain the SaO<sup>2</sup> at 90-92%*, and no higher.

## *Mechanical Ventilation*

Intubation and mechanical ventilation are indicated for: (*a*) patients with impaired consciousness who are unable to protect their airways from aspiration of mouth or gastric secretions, and (*b*) patients with acute respiratory failure (hypoxemic and/or hypercapnic) who cannot be managed otherwise. Remember that *positive pressure ventilation can reduce cerebral perfusion pressure* by increasing intracranial pressure (see Equation (47.1) later in the chapter), so the judicious use of positive pressure ventilation is wise in patients with ischemic stroke.

| Thrombo<br>prophylaxis  | • All patients should receive prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis using low-molecular-weight<br>heparin.<br>• Following thrombolytic therapy, use sequential compression devices for the first 24 hours. |  |  |  |  |

## **Hypertension Management**

Elevated blood pressure is reported in over 60% of patients with acute stroke ([9\)](#page-15-7), and is

considered to be a physiological response that helps to maintain flow in areas surrounding the infarcted area (i.e., the penumbra), where flow is threatened. This is considered to be especially important because cerebral autoregulation is impaired in patients with acute stroke [\(10](#page-15-8)), so cerebral flow is highly dependent on blood pressure. This might explain why *blood pressure reduction in the early period following acute stroke has resulted in no apparent improvement in outcomes* [\(11](#page-15-9)).

#### *Recommendations*

The following recommendations are from the most recent guidelines on stroke management ([2\)](#page-15-2).

- 1. For patients who did not receive thrombolytic therapy, blood pressure reduction is advised only at pressures >220/120 mm Hg for the first 72 hours after the stroke (unless there is a condition like left heart failure that requires a more aggressive approach). Furthermore, any decrease in blood pressure should probably not exceed 15% in the first 24 hours after the stroke.
- 2. For patients who have received thrombolytic therapy, the BP should be <180/ 105 mm Hg for 24 hours.
- 3. There is little agreement on the optimal blood pressure following mechanical thrombectomy with successful reperfusion. The guidelines recommend a BP <180/105 mm Hg for 24 hours ([2\)](#page-15-2), while other protocols aim for a normal BP (<140/90) after revascularization [\(12](#page-15-10)).

## *Antihypertensive Drugs*

The recommended drug regimens for blood pressure reduction in the early post-stroke period are included in [Table](#page-2-0) 47.2. *Labetalol* (a combined α- and β-blocker) and *nicardipine* (a calcium channel blocker) have proven to be equivalent for BP control in acute stroke ([12\)](#page-15-10). *Clevidipine* (a calcium channel blocker) is not as popular as the other two agents, but has been shown to be equivalent to nicardipine in patients with cerebrovascular disease ([13\)](#page-15-11).

Pure β-blockers are not recommended in acute ischemic stroke because they decrease cardiac output, however *metoprolol* (5–10 mg IV every 6 hours) can be used after mechanical thrombectomy with successful reperfusion [\(2](#page-15-2)). Nitroprusside should be avoided in acute stroke because it increases intracranial pressure.

## **Hypotension**

Considering that cerebral autoregulation is impaired in acute stroke, prompt correction of hypotension is mandatory, using fluids for hypovolemia and vasopressors, if needed.

- 1. The guidelines for stroke management recommend isotonic saline for volume resuscitation ([2\)](#page-15-2), based on studies showing no difference in outcomes between colloid and crystalloid fluids in acute stroke [\(14](#page-15-12)). However, the tendency of crystalloid fluids to promote edema formation (see Figure 10.1) seems reason enough to use some colloid fluids (i.e., 5% albumin) for volume resuscitation in acute stroke, especially in patients with hypoalbuminemia.
- 2. For vasopressors, phenylephrine is appropriate for patients with rapid atrial fibrillation, otherwise norepinephrine is an appropriate choice.
- 3. There is no recommendation concerning the target blood pressure in acute stroke, but considering that cerebral autoregulation is impaired, a target pressure that is higher than usual (i.e., greater than a mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg) seems warranted.

## **Glycemic Control**

Hyperglycemia occurs in 30–50% of patients (diabetics and nondiabetics) in the first 24 hours after acute stroke, and it has a negative impact on neurologic recovery [\(15](#page-15-13)[,16](#page-15-14)). This is very similar to the adverse impact of hyperglycemia on neurologic recovery after cardiac arrest (see Chapter 21). Proposed mechanisms include: (*a*) increased production of lactic acid with local acidosis, (*b*) oxidative stress from glucose-initiated production of reactive oxygen species, and (*c*) disruption of the blood-brain barrier with edema in the penumbra region ([15\)](#page-15-13).

The guidelines on stroke management recommend treating hyperglycemia if the blood glucose exceeds 180 mg/dL, with *a target blood glucose in the 140–180 mg/dL rang*e ([2\)](#page-15-2). (Since the hyperglycemia is transient, tighter glycemic control runs the risk of hypoglycemia.) *Avoiding dextrose-containing IV solutions is also advised*.

### **Fever**

Fever is reported in up to 60% of patients with acute ischemic stroke ([16\)](#page-15-14), and the presence of fever in the first 24–48 hrs a negative influence on both neurologic recovery and mortality ([17–](#page-15-15)19). This is similar to the negative impact of fever on neurologic recovery after cardiac arrest (which is the basis of targeted temperature management, described in Chapter 21).

#### *Source of Fever*

Fever typically appears on presentation, or within 72 hours after stroke onset [\(17](#page-15-15)), which suggests a noninfectious origin (e.g., from tissue necrosis or intracerebral blood). However, some studies have found infections in a majority of patients with stroke-related fever (20), so a search for infection is warranted for all stroke-related fevers.

## *Antipyretic Therapy*

Prompt decrease in body temperature is indicated for fever in the first 24–48 hours after stroke. The dosing of acetaminophen for antipyresis is described in Chapter 44. *Targeted temperature management does not improve outcomes after ischemic stroke* (21).

## **Other Measures**

### *Thromboprophylaxis*

Acute pulmonary embolism is traditionally cited as a common complication of acute stroke (22), although a 12-year survey of 3 million patients with acute stroke (in Germany) showed only a 0.4% incidence of PE (23). Nevertheless, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis is warranted, and low-molecular-weight heparin is the appropriate choice (see Table 5.2 for dosing recommendations). For patients who have received thrombolytic therapy, intermittent pneumatic compression can be used for the first 24 hours.

## *Antiplatelet Therapy*

Aspirin, 325 mg daily, should be started on admission to the ICU (or on day 2 if the patient has received thrombolytic therapy). The aim is to prevent early recurrent stroke, and estimates are that one stroke is avoided for every 100 patients treated (24). Aspirin can be given either orally or by rectal suppository. Anticoagulant therapy is not recommended for acute stroke.

## **Echocardiography**

The following are indications for a cardiac ultrasound in patients with acute ischemic stroke:

- 1. Embolic stroke is suspected (e.g., neuroimaging shows multiple areas of infarction).
- 2. Atrial fibrillation (past or present).
- 3. History of transmural MI (for possible mural thrombus).
- 4. Positive blood cultures (for possible endocarditis).
- 5. History of venous thromboembolism (for possible patent foramen ovale)
- 6. Cryptogenic stroke (same as #5).

Transesophageal ultrasound is the most sensitive method for detecting valvular vegetations or thrombi in the cardiac chambers, but it can be reserved for instances where transthoracic ultrasound (which is much easier to perform) is unrevealing.

#### *Patent Foramen Ovale*

As mentioned earlier, an embolic stroke can be the result of a thrombus that originates in the proximal leg veins and passes through a patent foramen ovale (PFO) to embolize in the cerebral circulation. Although uncommon, this scenario is a consideration when there is no apparent predisposing condition for ischemic stroke (e.g., in patients younger than 55 years of age) (25), or in patients who have a history of venous thromboembolism. The test described next is a reliable method for the detection of PFOs.

**BUBBLE TEST:** This test can be performed with transesophageal or transthoracic echocardiography. For the transthoracic approach, an apical 4-chamber view is preferred. About 10 mL of saline is first agitated to create microbubbles (i.e., by rapidly filling and emptying two syringes attached by a 3-way stopcock). The saline is then rapidly injected, either through a central venous catheter, or a peripheral catheter in the upper arm. After injection, the

microbubbles will become visible in the right side of the heart, and in the presence of a right-toleft intracardiac shunt (from a PFO), the bubbles will appear in the left side of the heart after a few cardiac cycles. This is demonstrated in [Figure](#page-5-0) 47.1 (26).

The presence of a PFO in the setting of an acute ischemic stroke is not evidence of a causal link between the two. However, it is sufficient reason to close the PFO at a later time (if the patient has a satisfactory neurological recovery), using a catheter-based technique.

This is evidence of a right-to-left shunt from a patent foramen ovale. Images adapted from Reference 26.

## **CNS Complications**

The central nervous system complications of acute stroke, (and stroke management), include intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral edema, and seizures.

## *Intracerebral Hemorrhage*

The most devastating complication of stroke management is shown in [Figure](#page-6-0) 47.2 (27). The CT images in this figure are from a patient with an acute ischemic stroke who experienced an acute deterioration in mental status five hours after receiving thrombolytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). A repeat CT image at that time showed a massive intracerebral hemorrhage with mass effect.

The incidence of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage following thrombolytic therapy for acute stroke is 6.4% to 8.8% (28,29). Risk factors include advanced age, blood pressure above 180/105, and a stroke that involves more than one-third of a cerebral hemisphere. The risk of hemorrhage is the reason that patients who receive thrombolytic therapy are admitted to an ICU or stroke unit for 24 hours, where it is possible to closely monitor neurologic status and blood pressure. Anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents are also withheld for the first 24 hours after thrombolytic therapy.

**MANAGEMENT:** There is no validated treatment for hemorrhagic transformation of acute stroke,

but the following measures are recommended in the most recent guidelines on stroke management [\(2](#page-15-2)).

- 1. Cryoprecipitate (10 Units) is recommended as a source of fibrinogen, and the dose can be repeated if the serum fibrinogen is below 200 mg/dL ([2\)](#page-15-2). However, cryoprecipitate must be thawed, which delays treatment by at least 20 minutes. A better choice would be *fibrinogen concentrates*, which have two advantages over cryoprecipitate (30): (*a*) thawing is not necessary, so treatment can be started immediately, and (*b*) the concentration of fibrinogen is more consistent (at 20 g/L).
- 2. If cryoprecipitate is not immediately available, tranexamic acid (an antifibrinolytic agent) can be given in a dose of 1,000 mg IV over 10 minutes [\(2](#page-15-2)).
- <span id="page-6-0"></span>3. A neurosurgery consultation is warranted (to consider decompression hemicraniectomy).

The CT scan on the right shows a massive intracerebral hemorrhage (hyperdense areas) with midline shift. Images from Reference 27.

#### *Cerebral Edema*

Hemorrhage and cerebral edema are the principal determinants of poor outcomes after acute stroke. There are two types of cerebral edema: *cytotoxic edema*, which is the result of cell necrosis, and *vasogenic edema*, which involves loss of vascular control mechanisms, and results in disruption of the blood-brain barrier. The larger the ischemic area, the more extensive the cerebral edema.

**MANAGEMENT:** Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is not recommended for acute ischemic stroke that is complicated by cerebral edema ([2\)](#page-15-2). Instead, monitoring neurologic symptoms and

signs is considered adequate. When cerebral edema causes a deterioration in neurologic status, *hypertonic saline* can be used to lower the ICP (31,32). Mannitol is also capable of lowering the ICP, but it is not as effective as hypertonic saline in patients with an elevated ICP after stroke (33). There is no evidence that hypertonic therapy alters the outcome in acute stroke (31,32).

There are a number of different hypertonic saline solutions, and [Table](#page-7-0) 47.3 shows some of the characteristics of the different solutions, including the bolus doses recommended for lowering the ICP (32). The more concentrated solutions are appealing because they are effective at a lower volume. Bolus dosing of hypertonic saline is preferred to a continuous infusion because the effect occurs more rapidly. The target plasma sodium is typically 145–155 mEq/L (32).

|               |                                                                           |  |  |  |  |  |
|               |                                                                           |  |  |  |  |  |

#### *Seizures*

About 20% of patients have a symptomatic seizure in the first week after an ischemic stroke, and about one-quarter of the seizures recur at some time in the ensuing 4 years (34). Therefore, anticonvulsant therapy (e.g., with levetiracetam) is recommended for post-stroke seizures, and it should be continued after discharge. Seizure prophylaxis is not recommended in the early period following ischemic stroke ([2\)](#page-15-2).

## **SPONTANEOUS INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE**

Spontaneous (non-traumatic) intracerebral hemorrhage accounts for about 10–15% of acute strokes, and the predisposing conditions include hypertension and systemic anticoagulation. The prognosis with this type of stroke is typically less favorable than with ischemic strokes: i.e., about half of the patients do not survive for 30 days (35), and two-thirds of the survivors have significant neurologic deficits (36). The CT image in [Figure](#page-9-0) 47.3 helps to understand why the prognosis is poor following intracerebral hemorrhage.

## **Reversing Antithrombotic Agents**

Rapid deterioration is common in the early hours after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and is attributed to expansion of the hematoma [\(3](#page-15-16)). Therefore, the first concern is to arrest growth of the hematoma, and to this end, prompt reversal of ongoing antithrombotic therapy is mandatory. The reversal agents and dosing regimens for the commonly used antithrombotic agents are presented in Tables 47.4 and 47.5 (36–38).

### *Warfarin*

Anticoagulation with warfarin can be reversed by 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) (so named because it contains Factors II, VII, IX, and X), which can normalize the INR much faster than fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and at a much smaller volume. In one study of excessive bleeding from warfarin, 4-factor PCC normalized the INR within 30 minutes in 60% of the patients, while FFP achieved the same feat in only 9% of patients (39). Vitamin K is given along with the 4-factor PCC, but the effect is much slower (i.e., the effect begins at about 2 hours, and is maximal at 24 hours) [\(3](#page-15-16)). The dosing of 4-factor PCC is determined by the INR, as shown in [Table](#page-10-0) 47.4.

<span id="page-9-0"></span>![](_page_9_Picture_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 47.3** Noncontrast CT image showing a large hyperdense intracerebral hematoma that occupies about one-half of the volume of the right side of the brain. The bleeding also extends into the ventricles, which creates the risk of an obstructive hydrocephalus.

## *Dabigatran*

The anticoagulant effect of the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran can be reversed in 10–30 minutes by *idarucizumab* (Praxbind®), a monoclonal antibody that readily binds to dabigatran. (See [Table](#page-10-0) 47.4 for the dosing.) An alternative approach is 4-factor PCC in high doses (50 IU/kg) ([3\)](#page-15-16), although there is limited experience with this approach.

#### *Factor Xa Inhibitors*

The anticoagulant effects of the Factor Xa inhibitors, apixaban and rivaroxaban, can be blocked by *andexanet alfa*, which is a dummy Factor Xa that binds the drugs but produces no anticoagulation. The dosing of this agent is presented in [Table](#page-10-1) 47.5, and is determined by the anticoagulant and dosage, and the time elapsed from the last dose (37). When andexanet is given to patients with excessive bleeding (including intracerebral bleeding) from apixaban or rivaroxaban, there is a 90% reduction in anti-Xa activity after about 10 minutes, and hemostasis

is fully restored after 12 hours (40). Andexanet has one adverse effect that deserves mention: i.e., about 10% of patients develop venous thromboembolism (40). If andexanet is not available, 4 factor PCC in a high dose (50 IU/kg) is recommended as an alternative treatment ([3\)](#page-15-16).

#### *Antiplatelet Agents*

Aspirin and clopidogrel produce irreversible inhibition of platelet adhesiveness that lasts for the lifetime of the exposed platelets (i.e., 7–10 days), but this effect can be antagonized by desmopressin (41), which promotes the release of von Willebrand factor from endothelial cells.

### **Other Measures**

Many of the measures described for ischemic stroke (e.g., blood pressure control, glycemic control) are also recommended for patients with spontaneous ICH [\(3](#page-15-16)).

- 1. High blood pressure can be especially harmful in acute hemorrhage, and maintaining a systolic blood pressure below 140 mm Hg is recommended [\(3](#page-15-16)).
- 2. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis should begin at the time of admission, and sequential compression devices should be used for prophylaxis in the first 24 hours. Thereafter, the decision to begin prophylaxis with one of the heparin preparations will depend on the clinical condition of the patient (stable or unstable).
- 3. Seizure prophylaxis is not recommended in patients with ICH ([3\)](#page-15-16). However, symptomatic seizures are reported in about 15% of patients in the first week after ICH ([3\)](#page-15-16), and these patients should receive anticonvulsant therapy (e.g., with levetiracetam).
- 4. Patients with ICH who have impaired consciousness should be evaluated for nonconvulsive status epilepticus with continuous EEG monitoring for 24–36 hours, if available.
- 5. A neurosurgery consult is warranted in most cases of ICH, especially those with large or expanding hematomas, or bleeding that has extended into ventricles (as in [Figure](#page-9-0) 47.3). Intraventricular blood often leads to obstructive hydrocephalus, and requires insertion of a catheter into the ventricles for drainage, and for intraventricular thrombolytic therapy (42). The intraventricular catheter can also be used to monitor the intracranial pressure.

### **Intracranial Pressure**

The clinical practice guideline on spontaneous ICH [\(3](#page-15-16)) recommends intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring in the following situations: (*a*) patients with a Glasgow Coma Score of ≤8 (see Table 45.5), (*b*) blood in the ventricular system, and (*c*) clinical evidence of transtentorial herniation (e.g., unilateral pupillary dilation). The ICP should then be maintained below 20 mm Hg (usually by periodically draining fluid from the intraventricular catheter) [\(3](#page-15-16),43). The ICP measurement also allows an estimation of the *cerebral perfusion pressure*.

### *Cerebral Perfusion Pressure*

The cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is the driving pressure for flow in the cerebral circulation, and is the difference between the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the intracranial pressure (ICP); i.e.,

$$CPP = MAP - ICP (mm Hg)$$
 (47.1)

The influence of CPP on cerebral blood flow is influenced by the vascular resistance in the cerebral circulation, and the presence or absence of cerebral autoregulation. *A CPP of 50–70 mm Hg is considered a reasonable goal in patients with ICH* (44).

## **SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE**

The most devastating type of stroke occurs when a saccular aneurysm in one of the cerebral arteries ruptures, resulting in the [accumulation](#page-12-0) of blood in the subarachnoid space (see Figure 47.4) (45). The severity of this condition is demonstrated by the following observations:

1. For patients who experience an aneurysmal SAH, as many as 25% will succumb before

reaching the hospital ([4\)](#page-15-17), and another 20% will not survive the hospitalization (46).

- 2. Six months after hospital admission, 35% of the patients will be dead or disabled (46).
- 3. Combining these observations indicates that over half of the patients with an aneurysmal SAH will die or become disabled within 6 months.

SAH also affects a younger age group than the other types of stroke [\(4](#page-15-17)). In one survey, the mean age of SAH victims was 55 years (47). Thus, SAH can remove people from their source of income, which has serious implications for families.

## **Sources of Tissue Injury**

The poor outcomes in aneurysmal SAH are explained by the multiple sources of tissue injury, as

summarized below.

- 1. The presence of blood in the subarachnoid space triggers an intense inflammatory response that damages the blood brain barrier (which promotes vasogenic cerebral edema) and produces oxidative damage in neurons and glial cells (which produces cytotoxic cerebral edema) (48). The iron in extravasated blood very likely has role in the damaging effects of subarachnoid hemorrhage, because iron promotes the production of highly-toxic hydroxyl radicals (see Figure 25.6), and free iron can promote cell death by oxidizing membrane lipids; a process known as *ferroptosis* (49).
- 2. Blood in the subarachnoid space blocks the flow of cerebrospinal fluid, which often leads to an obstructive hydrocephalus and increased intracranial pressure.
- 3. In about one-third of patients, there is a second phase of tissue injury that is ischemic in nature, and occurs between days 4 and 14 [\(4](#page-15-17)). This *delayed cerebral ischemia* (DCI) is considered a major source of morbidity and mortality, and is attributed to vasospasm and thrombotic occlusion of cerebral arteries and arterioles (50).
- 4. SAH is often associated with inflammatory injury in organs other than the brain. Common associated conditions include the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute kidney injury (AKI) [\(4](#page-15-17)).

## **Management**

The management of SAH is directed at the sources of injury just mentioned. Many of the measures are similar to those described for intracerebral hemorrhage.

### *Immediate Concerns*

The most immediate concern is to reduce the risk of bleeding from the ruptured aneurysm. This requires attention to the following:

- 1. Ongoing antithrombotic therapy should be reversed as soon as possible (see Tables 47.4 and 47.5).
- 2. Correction of hypertension is warranted, if necessary. The clinical practice guidelines for SAH do not recommend a target blood pressure, but there is evidence that rebleeding is uncommon if the systolic BP is below 140 mm Hg (51). Therefore, a systolic BP of ≤140 mm Hg is a reasonable target. Blood pressure reduction should not increase the cardiac output (since this could promote bleeding), so labetalol is an appropriate antihypertensive agent (See [Table](#page-2-0) 47.2 for dosing instructions).
- 3. Antifibrinolytic agents (e.g., tranexamic acid) are not effective in preventing rebleeding ([4\)](#page-15-17), and thus are not recommended.

### *Attention to the Aneurysm*

The best way to prevent rebleeding is to obliterate the ruptured aneurysm (e.g., with clips), and you will need a neurosurgeon or interventional radiologist for this task. This may be difficult to pursue if the patient is unstable, but outcomes are improved if corrective action is taken within 3 days of the event (52), and you are advised not to delay this for longer than 7–10 days [\(4](#page-15-17)).

#### *Delayed Cerebral Ischemia*

The delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) mentioned earlier, which can appear 4 to 14 days after SAH, is considered a major source of morbidity and mortality. The following measures are recommended to reduce the risk of DCI ([4\)](#page-15-17).

- 1. The calcium channel blocker *nimodipine* is recommended orally in a dose of 60 mg every 4 hours, starting as soon as possible after the diagnosis of SAH, and continuing for 3 weeks ([4\)](#page-15-17). This dosing regimen has been shown to reduce neurologic deficits, but has no impact on survival (53). The intravenous route is not recommended because of the risk of hypotension.
- 2. Monitoring to detect the onset of DCI can be carried out in several ways. Clinical signs of DCI can include a new focal deficit, or a drop of 2 points in the Glasgow Coma Score (see Table 45.5), so frequent neurologic assessments are advised. CT angiography (CTA) and transcranial Doppler ultrasound (measures flow velocity usually in the middle cerebral artery) are both useful, with sensitivities of about 90% for the detection of cerebral vasospasm ([4\)](#page-15-17).
- 3. For severe cases of vasospasm, intra-arterial vasodilators or angioplasty should be considered.

### *Intracranial Pressure*

Recommendations for intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring are the same as described for intracerebral hemorrhage. Drainage catheters are placed in patients who develop hydrocephalus, and these catheters can be used to monitor the ICP. In general, the ICP is kept below 20 mm Hg with periodic drainage of cerebrospinal fluid through the catheter. Patients who survive will require permanent shunting of cerebrospinal fluid into the abdominal cavity.

#### *General Measures*

General support is similar to that described for the other types of stroke, and includes the following:

- 1. The incidence of venous thromboembolism in SAH is as high as 25% [\(4](#page-15-17)), so thromboprophylaxis is mandatory. Prophylactic doses of enoxaparin (40 mg subQ daily) have been used safely after aneurysm repair [\(4](#page-15-17)).
- 2. Fever is common after SAH, and it has a negative influence on outcomes (54). However, fever suppression with antipyretic agents and cooling devices have not improved outcomes ([4\)](#page-15-17).
- 3. Hyperglycemia in the first 72 hours after SAH has a negative impact on outcomes ([4\)](#page-15-17), but there is no recommendation about glycemic control in the SAH guidelines [\(4](#page-15-17)).
- 4. Hyponatremia is reported in 35% of patients with SAH (55), and is possibly a result of cerebral salt wasting. However, the clinical significance of this has yet to be determined.

## **A FINAL WORD**

## **Where's the Beef?**

The ability of thrombolytic therapy and mechanical thrombectomy to re-establish flow has created high expectations for the management of ischemic strokes, and these expectations fueled

a massive effort to create "stroke centers" in major hospitals, with specialized "stroke teams" to direct the management of acute stroke. The following is an accounting of what this effort has accomplished. (The following numbers are from References 56–60.)
