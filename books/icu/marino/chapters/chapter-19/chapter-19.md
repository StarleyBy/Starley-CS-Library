# **Tachyarrhythmias**

*Variability is the law of life . . .*

William Osler (*[a](#page-18-0)*)

A rapid heart rate or *tachycardia* while at rest is evidence of a problem, but the tachycardia itself may not be the problem. This chapter describes tachycardias that *are* a problem (i.e., *tachyarrhythmias*), and require prompt evaluation and management. Many of the recommendations in this chapter are borrowed from the clinical practice guidelines listed in the bibliography at the end of the chapter ([1–](#page-18-1)[6\)](#page-18-2).

## **RECOGNITION**

The diagnostic evaluation of tachycardias (heart rate >100 beats/min) is based on 3 findings on the ECG: i.e., the duration of the QRS complex, the uniformity of the R-R intervals, and the characteristics of the atrial activity. This approach is outlined in the flow diagram in [Figure](#page-1-0) 19.1. The duration of the QRS complex is used to distinguish *narrow-QRS-complex tachycardias* (QRS duration ≤0.12 sec) from *wide-QRS-complex tachycardias* (QRS duration >0.12 sec), which helps to identify the point of origin of the tachycardia, as described next.

## **Narrow-QRS-Complex Tachycardias**

Tachycardias with a narrow QRS complex (≤0.12 sec) originate from a site above the AV conduction system, and are also known as *supraventricular tachycardias*. These include sinus tachycardia, atrial tachycardia, AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia (also called paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia), atrial flutter, and atrial fibrillation. The specific arrhythmia can be identified using the uniformity of the R-R interval (i.e., the regularity of the rhythm), and the characteristics of the atrial activity, as described next.

## *Regular Rhythm*

If the R-R intervals are uniform in length (indicating a regular rhythm), the possible arrhythmias include sinus tachycardia, AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia, and atrial flutter with a fixed (2:1, 3:1) AV block. The atrial activity on the ECG can identify each of these rhythms using the

### following criteria:

- 1. Uniform P waves and P–R intervals are evidence of sinus tachycardia.
- 2. The absence of P waves suggests an AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia (see [Figure](#page-2-0) 19.2).
- <span id="page-1-0"></span>3. Sawtooth waves are evidence of atrial flutter.

**FIGURE 19.2** Narrow-QRS-complex tachycardia with a regular rhythm. Note the absence of visible P waves. This is an AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia, also known as a "paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia" (paroxysmal SVT) because of its abrupt onset.

### *Irregular Rhythm*

If the R-R intervals are not uniform in length (indicating an irregular rhythm), the most likely arrhythmias are multifocal atrial tachycardia and atrial fibrillation. Once again, the atrial activity on the ECG helps to identify each of these rhythms; i.e.,

- 1. Multiple P wave morphologies and variable PR intervals are evidence of multifocal atrial tachycardia (see Panel A, [Figure](#page-2-1) 19.3).
- <span id="page-2-1"></span>2. The absence of P waves with highly disorganized atrial activity (fibrillation waves) is evidence of atrial fibrillation (see Panel B, [Figure](#page-2-1) 19.3).

**FIGURE 19.3** Narrow-QRS-complex tachycardias with an irregular rhythm. Panel A shows a multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT), identified by multiple P wave morphologies and variable PR intervals. Panel B is atrial fibrillation, identified by the absence of P waves with highly disorganized atrial activity (fibrillation waves).

## **Wide- QRS- Complex Tachycardias**

Tachycardias with a wide QRS complex (>0.12 sec) can originate from a site below the AV

conduction system (i.e., ventricular tachycardia), or they can represent a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with prolonged AV conduction (e.g., from a bundle branch block). These two arrhythmias can be difficult to distinguish. An irregular rhythm is evidence of an SVT with aberrant AV conduction, while certain ECG abnormalities (e.g., AV dissociation) provide evidence of VT. The distinction between VT and SVT with aberrant conduction is described in more detail later in the chapter.

## **ATRIAL FIBRILLATION**

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in adults (prevalence = 2–4%), and is classified as paroxysmal (present ≤7 days), persistent (present for >7 days), long-standing persistent (present for >1 year), or permanent (when repeated attempts to restore sinus rhythm are unsuccessful) ([3\)](#page-18-3). Most patients are elderly (median age = 75 years) and have underlying cardiovascular or pulmonary disease (with the exception of hyperthyroidism). AF can also appear *de novo* in certain groups of hospitalized patients (see next).

## **Hospital-Related AF**

New-onset AF is a reported risk in ICU patients, and in the postoperative period following major surgery.

#### *ICU-Related AF*

The reported incidence of ICU-related AF varies widely (from 2% to 44%), and is more likely to appear in elderly patients with coronary disease, sepsis, shock, or respiratory failure [\(7](#page-18-4)[,8](#page-18-5)). The AF resolves spontaneously in up to 25% of cases ([7\)](#page-18-4), but it tends to recur, and rehospitalization for AF is reported in 20% of cases [\(8](#page-18-5)). Stroke is a risk, but the reported incidence is only 1% in the ensuing 3 years [\(8](#page-18-5)).

## *Postoperative AF*

Postoperative AF is reported in up to 45% of cases involving cardiac and non-cardiac thoracic surgery, and up to 10% of cases involving other major surgeries [\(7](#page-18-4)[,9](#page-18-6)). It usually appears in the first 5 postoperative days [\(9](#page-18-6)), and follows the same course as ICU-related AF. Prophylaxis with β-blockers and magnesium has been effective in the AF that follows cardiac surgery AF [\(10](#page-18-7)).

## **Adverse Consequences**

AF can impair cardiac performance and increase the risk of thromboembolic stroke.

#### *Cardiac Performance*

Atrial contraction is responsible for about 25% of the ventricular end diastolic volume [\(11](#page-18-8)). Loss of this atrial contribution (from AF) has little noticeable effect unless diastolic filling is already impaired by mitral stenosis or reduced ventricular compliance (e.g., from ventricular hypertrophy). Under these conditions, a rapid heart rate can decrease cardiac stroke output (because of the decreased time for ventricular filling).

The influence of ventricular filling time in AF is illustrated by the arterial pressure

waveforms in [Figure](#page-4-0) 19.4. Note that close spacing between two heart beats (which shortens the time for ventricular filling), results in a decrease in systolic pressure (which is a reflection of the stroke volume). This effect can result in a "pulse deficit" (i.e., a decrease in the peripheral pulse rate relative to the apical impulses), indicating that the stroke output of the heart is not always reaching the periphery. Although rarely mentioned, monitoring the pulse deficit could be useful for identifying the end-point of rate control in AF ([12\)](#page-18-9).

<span id="page-4-0"></span>![](_page_4_Figure_1.jpeg)

**FIGURE 19.4** Arterial pressure tracings in AF. Note that there is a decrease in systolic pressure when two heart beats occur in rapid succession. This effect can produce a "pulse deficit", where apical impulses are not always transmitted to the periphery.

#### *Stroke*

Atrial fibrillation predisposes to thrombus formation in the left atrium, especially in the left atrial appendage, and these thrombi can dislodge and embolize in the cerebral circulation to produce an acute ischemic stroke. Overall, AF increases the risk of stroke 5-fold ([3–](#page-18-3)[5\)](#page-18-10), but the risk is not homogeneous, and is influenced by the presence of certain risk factors (which are described later). The increased risk of stroke pertains to all types of AF, except first episodes of AF that are <48 hrs in duration. Recommendations for stroke-prevention with antithrombotic therapy are presented later.

### **Heart Rate Control**

In patients with rapid AF who are hemodynamically stable, the initial goal is to slow the heart rate with drugs that prolong AV conduction. A variety of drugs are available for this purpose ([13\)](#page-18-11), and the popular ones are included in [Table](#page-4-1) 19.1. The following is a brief description of each drug. (*Caveat:* These drugs should not be used if the AF originates from an accessory pathway in the AV node, as described later).

See text for references. HFrEF = heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

## *Diltiazem*

The most popular agent for acute rate control in AF is the calcium channel blocker diltiazem, which is given as an intravenous bolus followed by a continuous infusion. The bolus dose produces effective rate control within one hour in 55% of patients ([14\)](#page-18-12), and the continuous infusion maintains rate control in up to 90% of cases [\(15](#page-18-13)). The graph in [Figure](#page-6-0) 19.5 shows that diltiazem is more effective than either amiodarone or digoxin in the first few hours of drug therapy ([16\)](#page-18-14).

**COMPLICATIONS:** The use of diltiazem is limited by the risk of hypotension, which is reported in about 20–30% of cases ([15,](#page-18-13)[17\)](#page-18-15). Diltiazem also has negative inotropic effects, which limits its use in patients with heart failure associated with reduced ejection fraction.

**FIGURE 19.5** Comparison of acute rate control with intravenous diltiazem, amiodarone, and digoxin in patients with uncomplicated atrial fibrillation. Data from Reference 16.

#### *β-Receptor Antagonists*

β-blockers achieve successful rate control in 70% of cases of rapid AF [\(18](#page-18-16)), and are most effective in hyperadrenergic states. Two β-blockers with proven efficacy in acute rate control are *esmolol* (Brevibloc) and *metoprolol* (Lopressor), and their dosing regimens are shown in Table 19.1. Both are [cardioselective](#page-4-1) agents that preferentially block β-1 receptors in the heart, but both are limited by the risk of hypotension. Esmolol is more appealing than metoprolol because it is an ultra short-acting drug (serum half-life is only 9 minutes), which allows rapid dose titration ([19\)](#page-18-17).

## *Amiodarone*

Amiodarone is an effective alternative to diltiazem or beta blockers in patients who are resistant or intolerant to these drugs ([20\)](#page-18-18). It also produces less cardiac depression than diltiazem or beta blockers, and is favored in some guidelines for patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction [\(4](#page-18-19)). Amiodarone is also an antiarrhythmic agent (Class III), and is capable of converting AF to a sinus rhythm. However, the success rate for cardioversion is variable, and some studies show no difference in the rate of cardioversion with amiodarone and diltiazem [\(17](#page-18-15)).

**COMPLICATIONS:** Intravenous amiodarone does not have the feared side effects associated with long-term therapy (e.g., pulmonary fibrosis, thyroid dysfunction). Hypotension can occur, but the incidence is far lower than with diltiazem [\(17](#page-18-15)). The hypotensive effect can be attributed to a solvent (polysorbate 80 surfactant) used to enhance the water solubility of amiodarone, since the aqueous formulation of amiodarone does not cause hypotension [\(21](#page-18-20)). Amiodarone can also

prolong the QT interval, and "torsade de pointes" has been reported, although rarely ([22\)](#page-18-21). Finally, amiodarone has several drug interactions by virtue of its metabolism by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system in the liver. The most relevant interactions in the ICU setting are inhibition of digoxin and warfarin metabolism.

**TRANSITION TO ORAL THERAPY:** Transition from IV to oral amiodarone begins with an oral dose of 400 mg, which is given 4–5 hours before discontinuing the infusion. The initial oral regimen is 400 mg twice daily, which is continued until the total loading dose (IV and PO) reaches 10 grams ([22\)](#page-18-21). (The initial 24-hour IV regimen is a total dose of about one gram.) Thereafter, the daily dose can be reduced to the usual maintenance dose (100–200 mg once daily).

#### *Digoxin*

Digoxin prolongs conduction in the AV node, and is used for long-term rate control in patients with AF and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. However, its value for acute rate control is limited because *the response to intravenous digoxin is slow to develop*. This is demonstrated in [Figure](#page-6-0) 19.5 [\(16](#page-18-14)). Note that there is little effect in the first hour after drug administration, and the heart rate has not reached the desired end-point (<100 bpm) after 6 hours. Because of this delayed response, intravenous digoxin should not be used alone for acute rate control in AF ([3,](#page-18-3)[13\)](#page-18-11). It can, however, be used as an adjunct to diltiazem or beta blockers in patients with heart failure or labile BP.

#### *End-Point of Rate Control*

There is a surprising lack of agreement about the end-point of rate reduction in AF, and heart rates of 80 bpm to 110 bpm have been used as end-points in individual studies [\(3](#page-18-3)). However the phenomenon shown in [Figure](#page-4-0) 19.4 suggests another approach to this issue; i.e., *elimination of the pulse deficit, or resolution of the variable systolic pressure in rapid AF, provides a more physiological goal of heart rate reduction in AF.* This approach is often overlooked, but deserves your consideration.

## **Electrical Cardioversion**

Synchronized, direct-current cardioversion is reserved for hemodynamically unstable patients. Biphasic shocks have a greater success rate and require lower energy levels than monophasic shocks (23). An energy level of 100 joules is usually successful with biphasic shocks (vs. 200 joules for monophasic shocks) (23). Fixed-energy attempts are considered more effective than an escalating energy approach [\(3](#page-18-3)). The success rate of cardioversion is greatest for new-onset or recent-onset AF.

Cardiac ultrasound (via the transesophageal approach, if time permits) is required prior to cardioversion to determine the presence or absence of atrial thrombi. Anticoagulation with a direct-acting oral agent is started as soon as possible (prior to, or immediately after the procedure) in appropriate candidates. Anticoagulation is not required for new-onset AF that is less than 48 hours in duration.

### **Stroke Prevention**

As mentioned earlier, there is an increased risk of thromboembolic stroke in AF, but a number of

factors influence this risk (as well as the need for anticoagulant prophylaxis).

## *Risk Assessment*

The decision to use anticoagulant therapy in AF is based on a scoring system that is shown in [Table](#page-8-0) 19.2. There are 10 identified risk factors for stroke, with the highest risk being advanced age (>75 years), and a prior history of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA) or venous thromboembolism (VTE). Patients who are definite candidates for anticoagulation are considered to have at least a five-fold higher risk of stroke (or a yearly incidence >5%). It is important to mention that the risk assessment in [Table](#page-8-0) 19.2 does not apply to valvular AF (i.e., AF associated with mitral stenosis or a prosthetic valve), which always requires anticoagulation ([3\)](#page-18-3).

Contraindications to anticoagulation in AF include active hemorrhage, a history of intracerebral hemorrhage, intracranial tumor, recurrent bleeding from a lesion that is still present, and a platelet count <50,000/μL ([3,](#page-18-3)[4\)](#page-18-19). Of interest, *a history of falls is not a contraindication to anticoagulant therapy* (24).

## *Oral Anticoagulants*

The oral anticoagulants used for stroke prevention in AF are shown in [Table](#page-9-0) 19.3.

#### *Warfarin:*

Warfarin is the first oral anticoagulant approved for clinical use (in the 1950s), and acts indirectly by inhibiting the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (Factors II, VII, IX, and X). Anticoagulation with warfarin reduces the incidence of stroke (by as much as 65%) in both valvular and nonvalvular AF (3–5,13,25). However, warfarin has a narrow therapeutic window (i.e., the difference between therapeutic and toxic drug levels), which increases the likelihood of both inadequate and excessive anticoagulation, and requires routine monitoring of hemostasis (with the international normalized ratio, or INR).

## *Direct-Acting Oral Anticoagulants*

The direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), which include direct thrombin inhibitors (e.g., dabigatran) and drugs that inhibit Factor Xa (e.g., rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban), have a more predictable anticoagulant effect than warfarin, and are given in fixed doses, without monitoring any tests of hemostasis. Clinical studies in patients with nonvalvular AF have shown that DOACs are as effective as warfarin in reducing the incidence of stroke, and have a lower incidence of major bleeding (26–29). Based on these observations, *DOACs are preferred to warfarin for stroke reduction in patients with nonvalvular AF* [\(3](#page-18-3)[–5](#page-18-10)). Each DOAC is considered equivalent to the others, but edoxaban may be less effective for stroke reduction (29), and dabigatran may have a greater risk of bleeding (26).

*The preference for DOACs does not extend to valvular AF* (i.e., AF associated with significant mitral stenosis or the presence of any prosthetic valve). In this situation, warfarin is considered superior to DOACs for stroke prevention ([3–](#page-18-3)[5\)](#page-18-10).

**DOSING:** The recommended dosing for each DOAC is shown in [Table](#page-9-0) 19.3. Note that a dose reduction is required for all DOACs in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min). In this situation, Factor Xa levels can be measured to assess the adequacy of anticoagulation. The consensus opinion is that DOACs should be avoided in patients with endstage renal failure (creatinine clearance <15 mL/min) ([3–](#page-18-3)[5\)](#page-18-10).

## **Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome**

The Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome (short P–R interval and delta waves before the QRS) is characterized by recurrent supraventricular tachycardias that originate from an accessory pathway in the AV node. (The mechanism for these tachycardias is explained in the section on re-entrant tachycardias.) When atrial fibrillation occurs in a patient with an accessory pathway,

drugs that block conduction in the AV node, (e.g., calcium channel blockers, β-blockers, digoxin) are unlikely to slow the ventricular rate because the accessory pathway is not blocked. Furthermore, selective block of the AV node can precipitate ventricular fibrillation ([6\)](#page-18-2). Therefore, *drugs that block the AV node should NOT be used when AF is associated with the WPW syndrome*. The preferred management in this situation is electrical cardioversion, or pharmacological cardioversion with amiodarone or procainamide.

## **MULTIFOCAL ATRIAL TACHYCARDIA**

Multifocal atrial tachycardia or MAT (see Panel A in [Figure](#page-2-1) 19.3) is a disorder of the elderly (average age = 70), and over half of the cases occur in patients with chronic lung disease (30). Other associated conditions include magnesium and potassium depletion, and coronary artery disease (31).

## **Acute Management**

The following measures are recommended for the acute management of MAT, but this is a stubborn arrhythmia that is often refractory to medical management.

- 1. Correct hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia if necessary. If both electrolyte abnormalities coexist, the magnesium deficiency must be corrected before potassium deficits can be replaced. This is explained in Chapter 37.
- 2. Since serum magnesium levels can be normal when total body magnesium is depleted (also explained in Chapter 37), intravenous magnesium can be given empirically using the following regimen: *Start with 2 grams MgSO<sup>4</sup> (in 50 mL saline) IV over 15 minutes, then infuse 6 grams MgSO<sup>4</sup> (in 500 mL saline) over 6 hours*. This regimen had a remarkable 88% success rate in converting MAT to a sinus rhythm in one study (31), and the effect was independent of serum magnesium level.
- 3. If the prior measures fail, and COPD is not the cause of the MAT, *metoprolol in the doses shown in [Table](#page-4-1) 19.1 has a reported 80% success rate in converting MAT to sinus rhythm* (30).
- 4. If metoprolol is a concern in patients with COPD, the calcium channel blocker *verapamil* can be effective. Verapamil converts MAT to sinus rhythm in less than 50% of cases (30), but it can slow the ventricular rate. *The dose is 0.25–5 mg IV over 2 min, which can be repeated every 15–30 min, if necessary, to a total dose of 20 mg* (32). Verapamil is a potent negative inotropic agent, and is not recommended for patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction (32).

## **PAROXYSMAL SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIAS**

Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias (PSVT) are narrow-QRS-complex tachycardias that are second only to atrial fibrillation as the most prevalent rhythm disturbances in the general population.

## **Mechanism**

These arrhythmias occur when impulse transmission in one pathway of the AV conduction system is slowed. This creates a difference in the refractory period for impulse transmission in the abnormal and normal conduction pathways, and this allows impulses travelling down one pathway to travel back through the other pathway. The retrograde transmission of impulses is called *re-entry*, and it results in a circular pattern of impulse transmission that is self-sustaining; i.e., a *re-entrant tachycardia*. Re-entry is triggered by an ectopic atrial impulse in one of the two conduction pathways, which results in the abrupt onset that is characteristic of re-entrant tachycardias.

There are 5 different types of PSVT, based on the location of the re-entrant pathway. The most common PSVT is *AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia*, where the re-entrant pathway is located in the AV node.

## **AV Nodal Re-Entrant Tachycardia**

AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT) accounts for 50 to 60% of cases of PSVT (33). It typically appears in patients who have no history of heart disease, and is more common in women than men. The onset is abrupt, and the predominant complaints are palpitations and lightheadedness. There is no evidence of heart failure or myocardial ischemia, and significant hemodynamic compromise is uncommon. The ECG shows a narrow- QRS-complex tachycardia with a regular rhythm and a heart rate between 140 and 250 bpm (33). There are often no visible P waves on the ECG, as shown in [Figure](#page-2-0) 19.2.

Because AVNRT has a regular rhythm, it is often mistaken for sinus tachycardia. However, the onset is abrupt in AVNRT and gradual in sinus tachycardia, while the ECG shows no visible P waves in AVNRT, but there are P waves before each QRS complex in sinus tachycardia. A 12 lead ECG is often necessary for identifying P waves (which are usually most prominent in the anterior precordial leads and inferior limb leads).

#### *Vagal Maneuvers*

Maneuvers that increase vagal tone are recommended as an initial attempt to terminate AVNRT (34). A variety of maneuvers have been identified (34), including (with the patient in the supine position) carotid sinus massage (only when there are no carotid bruits), the Valsalva maneuver (maximal expiratory effort with a closed glottis), the Mueller maneuver (maximal inspiratory effort with a closed glottis), induced gag reflex (by stimulating the posterior oropharynx with a tongue depressor), and application of an ice-cold, wet towel to the face (in an attempt to elicit a diving reflex).

Vagal maneuvers have had limited success in terminating AVNRTs. In one prospective study, the conventional Valsalva maneuver and carotid sinus massage had success rates of 24% and 9%, respectively (35). However in the same study, a modified Valsalva maneuver (performed by elevating the patients legs after the standard Valsalva maneuver) had a success rate of 44% (35).

### **Adenosine**

When vagal maneuvers are ineffective, *adenosine is the drug of choice for terminating AVNRT* (34). Adenosine is an endogenous nucleotide that relaxes vascular smooth muscle and slows

conduction in the AV node. When given by rapid intravenous injection, adenosine has a rapid onset of action (<30 sec) and produces a transient AV block that can terminate AV nodal reentrant tachycardias. Adenosine is quickly cleared from the bloodstream (by receptors on RBCs and endothelial cells), and the effects last only 1–2 minutes.

### *Dosing Considerations*

The dosing regimen for adenosine is shown in [Table](#page-12-0) 19.4 (34,36,37). The initial dose is 6 mg, which is injected rapidly into a peripheral vein and followed by a saline flush. Optimal results are obtained if the drug is injected at the hub of the catheter. If conversion to sinus rhythm does not occur after 2 minutes, a second 12 mg dose is given, and this can be repeated once if necessary. This regimen *terminates re-entrant tachycardias in over 90% of cases* (34).

The effective dose of adenosine for terminating AVNRT was determined in studies that used drug injection into peripheral veins. However, ventricular asystole has been reported when standard doses of adenosine are given through central venous catheters (38), so *a dose reduction of 50% has been recommended* by some (including the manufacturer) *when adenosine is delivered through a central venous catheter* (38).

#### *Adverse Effects*

The adverse effects of adenosine are short-lived. The most frequent adverse effect is postconversion bradycardia, including various degrees of AV block. The AV block is refractory to atropine, but resolves spontaneously within 60 seconds (37). Dipyridamole enhances the AV

block produced by adenosine, and the two drugs should not be used together (37). Adenosine is contraindicated in patients with asthma; i.e., there is evidence that adenosine produces a sense of dyspnea, but not bronchospasm, in asthmatic subjects (39).

### *Other Therapies*

When PSVT does not respond to adenosine, the calcium channel blockers diltiazem or verapamil can be effective. (The dosing regimen for diltiazem is shown in [Table](#page-4-1) 19.1, and the dosing regimen for verapamil is presented in the section on multifocal atrial tachycardia). For the rare case of PSVT that is resistant to drugs or is hemodynamically unstable, synchronized electrical cardioversion will terminate the rhythm, but energy levels greater than 100 J may be necessary (34).

## **VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA**

Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a wide-QRS-complex tachycardia that has an abrupt onset, a regular rhythm, and a rate that is typically 140–200 bpm. The appearance can be *monomorphic* (uniform QRS complexes) or *polymorphic* (multiple QRS morphologies). VT rarely occurs in the absence of structural heart disease ([2\)](#page-18-22), and when it is sustained (i.e., lasts longer than 30 seconds), it can be an immediate threat to life.

## **VT versus SVT**

Monomorphic VT can be difficult to distinguish from an SVT with prolonged AV conduction. This is demonstrated in [Figure](#page-13-0) 19.6. The tracing in the upper panel shows a wide-QRS-complex tachycardia that looks like monomorphic VT. The tracing in the lower panel shows spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm. Note that the QRS complex remains unchanged after the arrhythmia is terminated, revealing an underlying bundle branch block. Thus, the apparent VT in the upper panel is actually an SVT with a pre-existing bundle branch block.

<span id="page-13-0"></span>![](_page_13_Figure_7.jpeg)

**FIGURE 19.6** Upper panel shows a wide-QRS-complex tachycardia that looks like monomorphic VT. However, the lower panel shows spontaneous conversion to a sinus rhythm,

which reveals an underlying bundle branch block, indicating that the rhythm in the upper panel is an SVT with a pre-existing bundle branch block. Tracings courtesy of Dr. Richard M. Greenberg, MD.

#### *Clues*

There are two abnormalities on an ECG that will identify VT as the cause of a wide-QRScomplex tachycardia.

- 1. The atria and ventricles beat independently in VT, and this results in *AV dissociation* on the ECG, where there is no fixed relationship between P waves and QRS complexes. (P waves are most visible in the inferior limb leads and the anterior precordial leads.)
- 2. The presence of fusion beats like the one in [Figure](#page-14-0) 19.7 is indirect evidence of VT. A fusion beat is produced by the retrograde transmission of a ventricular ectopic impulse that collides with a supraventricular (e.g., sinus node) impulse. The result is a hybrid QRS complex that is a mixture of the normal QRS complex and the ventricular ectopic impulse. The presence of a fusion beat (which should be evident on a single-lead ECG tracing) is thus indirect evidence of ventricular ectopic activity.

If there is no definitive evidence of VT on the ECG, the presence or absence of heart disease can be useful; i.e., *VT is the cause of 95% of wide-QRS-complex tachycardias in patients with underlying heart disease* (40). Therefore, a wide-QRS-complex tachycardia should be treated as probable VT in any patient with underlying heart disease.

<span id="page-14-0"></span>![](_page_14_Figure_6.jpeg)

**FIGURE 19.7** An example of a fusion beat (circled in red), which is a hybrid QRS complex produced by the collision of a ventricular ectopic impulse and a supraventricular (e.g., sinus node) impulse. The presence of fusion beats is evidence of ventricular ectopic activity.

## **Management**

The management of patients with a wide-QRS-complex tachycardia can be organized as shown in [Figure](#page-15-0) 19.8.

- 1. If there is evidence of hemodynamic compromise, *electrical cardioversion* is the appropriate intervention, regardless of whether the rhythm is VT or SVT with aberrant conduction. The shocks should be synchronized (timed with the QRS complex) and a low-energy shock of 100 J (biphasic or monophasic shocks) should terminate most cases of monomorphic VT (41). If this is unsuccessful, try 100 J again but use biphasic shocks. You can escalate to 200 J, but avoid higher energy shocks (e.g., 360 J) because they damage the myocardium (41).
- 2. If there is no evidence of hemodynamic compromise and the diagnosis of VT is certain, intravenous amiodarone should be used to terminate the arrhythmia. *Amiodarone is the favored drug for suppressing monomorphic VT* [\(4](#page-18-19)), and the dosing regimen is shown in [Figure](#page-15-0) 19.8.

3. If there is no evidence of hemodynamic compromise and the diagnosis of VT is uncertain, the response to adenosine can be helpful because adenosine will abruptly terminate most cases of paroxysmal SVT, but will not terminate VT. If a wide-QRS-complex tachycardia is refractory to adenosine, the likely diagnosis is VT, and intravenous amiodarone is indicated for arrhythmia suppression.

**FIGURE 19.9** Torsade de pointes, a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia described as "twisting around the (isoelectric) points". Tracing courtesy of Dr. Richard M. Greenberg, MD.

## **Torsade de Pointes**

Torsade de pointes ("twisting around the points") is a polymorphic VT with QRS complexes that appear to be twisting around the isoelectric line of the ECG, as shown in [Figure](#page-16-0) 19.9. This arrhythmia is usually associated with a prolonged QT interval, and it can be congenital or acquired. The acquired form is much more prevalent, and is caused by a variety of drugs and electrolyte abnormalities that prolong the QT interval (42,43). There is also a polymorphic VT that is associated with a normal QT interval, and the predisposing condition in this case is myocardial ischemia (42).

### *Predisposing Factors*

The drugs most frequently implicated in torsade de pointes are listed in [Table](#page-16-1) 19.5 (43). The prominent offenders are antiarrhythmic agents (Class IA and III), macrolide antibiotics, neuroleptic agents (phenothiazines and butyrophenones), and cisapride (a pro-motility drug). The electrolyte disorders that prolong the QT interval include hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia.

<span id="page-16-1"></span>

|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--|--|--|
|               |                                                            |  |  |  |
|               |                                                            |  |  |  |

## *Measuring the QT Interval*

The QT interval is the ECG manifestation of ventricular depolarization and repolarization, and is measured from the onset of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave. The longest QT intervals are usually in precordial leads V3 and V4, and these leads are most reliable for assessing QT prolongation. The QT interval varies inversely with heart rate, and a rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) provides a more accurate assessment of QT prolongation. The accepted method for

determining the QTc is to divide the QT interval by the square root of the R-R interval (43–45); i.e.,

$$QTc = QT/\sqrt{R-R}$$
 (19.1)

A normal QTc is ≤0.44 seconds, and a QTc >0.5 seconds represents a risk for torsade de pointes (45). However, the importance of QT prolongation as a risk factor for torsade de pointes is not as advertised, because prolonged QT intervals are commonplace in ICU patients, while torsade de pointes is an uncommon arrhythmia.

#### *Management*

The management of polymorphic VT can be summarized as follows:

- 1. Sustained polymorphic VT requires nonsynchronized electrical cardioversion (i.e., defibrillation) (42).
- 2. Intravenous magnesium is popular for terminating torsade de pointes, and can be combined with electrical cardioversion (46). There is no consensus about the magnesium dose in this setting, but the current ACLS guidelines recommend 1–2 grams of magnesium sulfate (MgSO<sup>4</sup> ) IV over 15 minutes [\(6](#page-18-2)).
- 3. Other measures aimed at preventing recurrences of torsade de pointes include correcting hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia (high-risk electrolyte abnormalities) and discontinuing high-risk drugs (e.g., haloperidol).
- 4. For polymorphic VT with a normal QT interval, amiodarone or β-blockers can help to prevent recurrences (47).

## **A FINAL WORD**

## **Managing the Muddle**

The first glance at the variety of cardiac arrhythmias and treatment options is often a befuddling experience, and the following tips can help to unravel things.

## *For a narrow-complex tachycardia:*

- 1. If the rhythm is regular, the candidates are sinus tachycardia, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), or atrial flutter. However, PSVT is uncommon in ICU patients (and usually occurs in younger patients with no structural heart disease).
- 2. If the rhythm is highly irregular, it is most likely atrial fibrillation. Another candidate is multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT), which is seen in patients with chronic lung disease.
- 3. Be aware that rapid atrial fibrillation can appear to be a regular rhythm.

## *For a wide-complex tachycardia:*

1. If the rhythm is irregular, it is likely to be atrial fibrillation (or MAT) with prolonged AV

conduction. Ventricular tachycardia is never irregular.

- 2. If the rhythm is regular, it is most likely ventricular tachycardia. However, rapid atrial fibrillation with prolonged AV conduction can also appear to be regular.
- 3. If the height of the complexes is increasing and decreasing, the rhythm is likely to be "torsade de pointes".

Finally, atrial fibrillation is (by far) the most common arrhythmia you will encounter in the ICU, so focus your attention accordingly.
