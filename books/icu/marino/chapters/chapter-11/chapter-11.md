# **Fluid Management**

*Restoration to normal physiology and normal function of organs … can never be achieved by inundation.*

Francis Moore & G. Thomas Shires (*[a](#page-15-0)*)

Humans can survive for several weeks without food, but they will succumb after just a few days without water. This need for water explains (teleologically) why the physiological response to stress or injury involves the retention of water by the kidneys (via the actions of antidiuretic hormone released from the posterior pituitary). The goal, of course, is to support cardiac output and maintain tissue perfusion. Intravenous fluid therapy has the same intent, however the infusion of fluids in critically ill patients is often excessive, especially in patients who are hemodynamically unstable, and the resulting fluid overload has a well-documented negative impact on both morbidity and mortality ([1\)](#page-15-1).

The frequency and deleterious consequences of iatrogenic fluid overload has led to a renewed focus on fluid management in the ICU, to identify and correct the practices that promote fluid overload [\(2](#page-15-2)). This chapter has a similar focus, and includes sections on the physiology of fluid resuscitation, current problems with infusion therapy, markers of tissue hypoperfusion, and the evaluation of fluid responsiveness.

## **VENOUS RETURN**

Volume resuscitation is aimed at promoting venous return to the heart, and a misunderstanding of the physiology of venous return can result in the inappropriate use of intravenous fluids.

### **Determinants of Venous Return**

The pressure gradient for venous return is often assumed to be the difference between the mean arterial pressure and the pressure in the right atrium, but this is not the case. An explanation for this is provided by the illustration in [Figure](#page-1-0) 11.1, which shows a large sink that is filled with water, and a spigot that is adding water from an upper tank. The lower sink in this case represents the venous system (which contains 75% of the blood volume), and the upper tank represents the arterial side of the circulation. The flow of water out of the lower sink (i.e., venous

return) is driven by the hydrostatic pressure exerted by the height of the water in the sink, and not by the pressure in the upper tank (i.e., the arterial pressure). Thus, *the driving pressure for venous return is distinct from the arterial pressure* ([3\)](#page-15-3).

The pressure gradient that drives venous return (ΔPv) is the pressure drop from the small veins or venules to the right atrium. The upstream pressure in the small veins or venules is known as the *mean systemic pressure* (PMS), and *is equivalent to the pressure in the systemic circulation in the absence of blood flow* ([4,](#page-15-4)[5\)](#page-15-5). Venous return can then be described as follows:

<span id="page-1-1"></span>Venous Return = 
$$(Pms - PRA)/Rv$$
 (11.1)

where Pms is the mean systemic pressure, PRA is the right atrial pressure, and Rv is the resistance to flow in the venous circulation. Since the central venous pressure (CVP) is the clinical measure of right atrial pressure, [Equation](#page-1-1) 11.1 can be rewritten as:

<span id="page-1-2"></span>Venous Return = 
$$(Pms - CVP)/Rv$$
 (11.2)

<span id="page-1-0"></span>Volume resuscitation has little impact on Rv ([6\)](#page-15-6), so *the goal of fluid resuscitation should be an increase in the (Pms – CVP) gradient*.

**FIGURE 11.1** Illustration to demonstrate how the pressure gradient for venous return (ΔPv) is distinct from the pressure in the arterial circulation. Pms = mean systemic pressure, PRA = right atrial pressure. See text for explanation.

### **Central Venous Pressure**

One of the traditional goals of fluid resuscitation has been an increase in the CVP [\(7](#page-15-7)). However, the relationships in [Equation](#page-1-2) 11.2 indicate that *an increase in the CVP (i.e., right atrial pressure) will impede venous return*. This is shown in [Figure](#page-2-0) 11.2. The lines in this graph are constructed by varying the right atrial pressure (PRA) independently (i.e., without a change in blood volume) and recording the resulting changes in blood flow (venous return). Note that progressive increases in PRA above zero are associated with a steady decline in venous return: an increase in PRA of 1 mm Hg results in an average 14% decrease in venous return [\(8](#page-15-8)). When venous return eventually ceases, the PRA is equivalent to the Pms, and there is no pressure gradient for venous return. Note that changes in intravascular volume (i.e., hypo- and hypervolemia) are associated with the same directional change in Pms, indicating that Pms is volume-dependent.

**FIGURE 11.2** Graph showing the influence of right atrial pressure on venous return. The normal curve is indicated by the solid line. When venous return is zero, the right atrial pressure (PRA) is equivalent to the mean systemic pressure (Pms). See text for explanation.

### **Mean Systemic Pressure**

The Pms is not easily measured, which may explain why there are relatively few reports of Pms measurements. The original studies involved laboratory animals, and identified a normal Pms of 7–8 mm Hg ([8\)](#page-15-8). Human studies have mostly involved postoperative ICU patients (some receiving vasopressors), and have reported Pms values in the 14–20 mm Hg range ([9,](#page-15-9)[10\)](#page-15-10). The following is a brief description of two methods used to measure the Pms [\(9](#page-15-9)).

### *Stop-Flow Method*

The easiest method of measuring the Pms requires an indwelling radial artery catheter and an inflatable arm cuff with a rapid cuff inflation system (D.E. Hokanson, Inc., Bellevue, WA). The cuff is placed on the upper arm and is inflated (in 0.3 sec) to a pressure that is 50 mm Hg higher than the systolic pressure recorded with the radial artery catheter. This creates a no-flow condition, and after 30 seconds of equilibration time, the radial artery pressure is equivalent to the Pms ([9\)](#page-15-9). The cuff is then deflated, and the measurement is repeated for a total of three measurements: the pressures should not vary by more than 5% [\(9](#page-15-9)).

#### *Inflation-Hold Method*

This method is restricted to ventilator-dependent patients with a regular cardiac rhythm who are also heavily sedated or not breathing spontaneously, and it requires CVP monitoring and a rapid method of measuring the cardiac output (see the section on "Fluid Responsiveness"). The basic principle is to increase the intrathoracic pressure with an "inflation-hold" maneuver (where the inflation volume is held in the lungs at end-inspiration), which will increase the CVP and decrease the cardiac output (a surrogate of venous return). A series of inflation-hold maneuvers is performed at incremental pressures (e.g., 10, 15, 20 cm H2O) and each inflation-hold is maintained for 12 seconds. The cardiac output and CVP are recorded in the last 3 seconds of the maneuver, and the resulting values (at each pressure) are used to construct a venous return curve (like the ones in [Figure](#page-2-0) 11.2); extrapolation of the curve down to the x-axis then identifies the Pms ([9\)](#page-15-9).

### *Response to Fluids*

Clinical studies have consistently shown that the Pms increases in response to a fluid challenge (typically 250–500 mL) (4,5,9,10), but the increase in Pms alone does not identify a beneficial response to fluids (not if there is a similar increase in the CVP) [\(4](#page-15-4)). Rather, *patients who are "fluid responsive" are identified by an increase in the (Pms – CVP) gradient after a fluid challenge* ([4,](#page-15-4)[10\)](#page-15-10), as predicted by [Equation](#page-1-2) 11.2.

## **PROBLEMS WITH FLUID RESUSCITATION**

This section highlights some of the perceptions and practices that contribute to the problem of iatrogenic fluid overload.

### **Plasma Volume**

The target of fluid resuscitation is the plasma volume, but little consideration is given to the actual plasma volume, or the relatively small deficit that can trigger fluid resuscitation. The size of the plasma and interstitial fluid compartments are shown in [Table](#page-4-0) 11.1, using estimated volumes for an average-sized adult male and female. (For the derivation of these volumes, see Table 10.1.) The total extracellular volume is 16 liters in the male, and 10 liters in the female. Plasma accounts for only 20% of the extracellular fluid, so the plasma volume is only 3 liters in the male, and 2 liters in the female. (*Note:* For a quick estimate of plasma volume, use 40 mL/kg lean body weight in males, and 36 mL/kg in females.)

<span id="page-4-0"></span>

|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------|--|
| Fluid                                    | Male: 75 kg                              | Female: 60 kg |  |

See Table 10.1 for the derivation of the fluid compartment volumes. Weights represent lean body weight. †A 15% decrease in plasma volume. From References 8 and 9.

Hypovolemia is usually clinically silent until the volume deficit reaches 15% of the blood volume ([11\)](#page-15-11), and this is the point that typically triggers fluid [resuscitation.](#page-4-0) As shown in Table 11.1, this corresponds to a plasma volume deficit of 450 mL in the average-sized male, and 300 mL in the average-sized female. Thus, fluid resuscitation can be initiated for volume deficits of only a few hundred milliliters, and failure to consider this can lead to excessive fluid infusion.

#### *Measuring the Plasma Volume*

Although rarely used, there is a clinically validated method of measuring blood volume that uses an indicator-dilution technique with iodine-131-labeled albumin to measure plasma volume, and then calculates red cell and blood volumes based on the hematocrit [\(12](#page-15-12)). A specialized analyzer (BVA-100®, Daxor Corporation, Oak Ridge, TN) provides results in about one hour, which includes a comparison of the measured and normal or expected volumes. The use of this methodology in patients with septic shock provided the data shown in [Figure](#page-4-1) 11.3 [\(13](#page-15-13)). In this case, there was a considerable increase in plasma and blood volume, which corroborates the prevalence of fluid overload in critically ill patients, and provides useful information for guiding fluid management. This approach has also been adopted for the management of acute heart failure, where measurements of plasma volume are used to guide diuretic therapy [\(14](#page-15-14)).

<span id="page-4-1"></span>![](_page_4_Figure_5.jpeg)

**FIGURE 11.3** Measurements of plasma, red cell, and blood volume in 50 patients with septic shock, which provides evidence of iatrogenic fluid overload in critically ill patients. Height of the bars represent mean values. Data from Reference 13.

### **Distribution of Crystalloid Fluids**

The propensity of fluid resuscitation to promote edema formation is largely due to the distribution of infused crystalloid fluids (which is described in detail in Chapter 10). Standard intravenous fluids are electrolyte (predominantly sodium chloride) solutions that distribute uniformly in the extracellular fluid, and since plasma represents 20% of the extracellular fluid (as shown in [Table](#page-4-0) 11.1), then 20% of an infused crystalloid fluid will distribute in plasma, and the remaining 80% will distribute in the interstitial fluid [\(15](#page-15-15)). In other words, *the predominant effect of crystalloid fluids is to expand the interstitial fluid volume, not the plasma volume, and this promotes edema formation.*

**EXAMPLE:** The edema-forming propensity of crystalloid fluids can be demonstrated using the fluid volumes in [Table](#page-4-0) 11.1. The 75 kg adult male has a plasma volume of 3 liters and a volume deficit of 450 mL (15% of the plasma volume). To replace this volume deficit with a crystalloid fluid (e.g., Ringer's lactate) will require 450/0.2 = 2.25 liters, and 1.8 liters of this fluid (2.25 × 0.8) will add to the interstitial fluid volume. Thus, replacing about half a liter of plasma has added almost two liters to the interstitial fluid.

### *Aggravating Factors*

The tendency for crystalloid fluids to promote edema formation will be magnified by two conditions that are common in critically ill patients: i.e., hypoalbuminemia and increased capillary permeability. Albumin is responsible for 80% of the colloid osmotic pressure in plasma (the osmotic force that holds water in the intravascular compartment) [\(16](#page-15-16)), and thus hypoalbuminemia will promote the movement of water from plasma to interstitial fluid. Increased capillary permeability is a feature of severe inflammatory conditions, such as septic shock (described in Chapter 17) and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (described in Chapter 24). Both aggravating conditions often coexist, which adds considerably to the negative consequences of crystalloid fluid resuscitation.

### *Adding Colloid Fluids*

Colloid fluids like 5% albumin are much more effective than crystalloid fluids for expanding the plasma volume (see Figure 10.1), and combining colloid and crystalloid fluids has been proposed for reducing the volume of infused fluids [\(2](#page-15-2)). This deserves attention.

#### **Assessment of Intravascular Volume**

Another major problem in fluid management is the limited ability to accurately assess the intravascular volume. The clinical evaluation of intravascular volume is so flawed that is has been called a "comedy of errors" [\(17](#page-15-17)). The following are some of the shortcomings.

#### *Vital Signs*

Vital signs are notoriously unreliable for the assessment of intravascular volume, especially in critically ill patients. The following are some relevant observations:

- 1. Tachycardia in the supine position is not observed in most cases of acute blood loss, even when the volume deficit is as high as 25% (18,19). In fact, bradycardia may be more common than tachycardia after acute blood loss (18).
- 2. Supine hypotension does not appear until the blood volume deficit is >30% [\(11](#page-15-11)).
- 3. An orthostatic increment in heart rate (≥30 bpm) is the most sensitive marker of hypovolemia, and appears when volume deficits reach 15% (18,19).

These observations indicate that tachycardia and hypotension in the supine position are insensitive markers of hypovolemia. The orthostatic increment in heart rate has limited value in the ICU, because many patients are unable to stand to perform the measurement.

#### *Central Venous Pressure*

Central venous pressure (CVP) has traditionally played a dual role in fluid resuscitation, both as a marker of intravascular volume and a target of volume resuscitation. However, neither is justified; i.e.,

- 1. The CVP is not a reliable marker of intravascular volume. This is demonstrated by the scatterplot in [Figure](#page-7-0) 11.4 where each data point represents a paired measurement of the CVP and the circulating blood volume in a group of postoperative patients (20). There is clearly no defined relationship between the two measurements, as confirmed by the correlation coefficient (r) and p value in the upper left corner of the graph. This observation has been confirmed in other studies (21).
- 2. The CVP should not be a target of volume resuscitation, as an increase in the CVP will *impede* venous return. This is explained earlier in the chapter.

The poor correlation between the CVP and blood volume can be attributed to two confounding factors. The first is the influence of right ventricular compliance on the CVP; i.e., a decrease in ventricular compliance (distensibility) will increase the CVP. The second factor is the influence of positive intrathoracic pressure during mechanical ventilation, which is transmitted into the superior vena cava and increases the CVP. This influence can be minimized by measuring the CVP at the end of expiration (see Figure 8.5), but this does not erase the influence of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).

In summary, the information just presented indicates that *the CVP should never be used to make decisions regarding fluid management*.

#### *Inferior Vena Cava Diameter*

The evaluation of intravascular volume and fluid responsiveness using respiratory variations in the diameter of the inferior vena cava (as determined by ultrasound) enjoyed a brief period of popularity, but proved to be unreliable (22).

### MARKERS OF TISSUE HYPOPERFUSION

There are two physiological markers of tissue hypoperfusion that can be used to guide fluid resuscitation: the central venous  $O_2$  saturation (Scv $O_2$ ), and the venoarterial PCO<sub>2</sub> difference (the PCO<sub>2</sub> gap) (23,24). Both measurements require a central venous catheter.

### Central Venous O<sub>2</sub> Saturation

(*Note:* This topic is described in Chapter 9, and is only briefly reviewed here.) The venous  $O_2$  saturation (SvO<sub>2</sub>) is a reflection of the relationship between  $O_2$  delivery (DO<sub>2</sub>) and  $O_2$  consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>). This can be explained using the following equation:

<span id="page-7-1"></span>
$$VO_2 = DO_2 \times (SaO_2 - SvO_2)$$
 (11.3)

The term  $(SaO_2 - SvO_2)$  expresses the extent of hemoglobin desaturation in the systemic microcirculation, also known as " $O_2$  extraction". The relationships in Equation 11.3 are the basis for the control of  $VO_2$ ; i.e., when  $O_2$  delivery decreases (e.g., by a decrease in cardiac output), there is a compensatory increase in  $O_2$  extraction, and this helps to maintain a constant  $VO_2$  (and preserve aerobic metabolism). These relationships are demonstrated in Figure 9.3. Note that as

the DO<sup>2</sup> decreases, the VO<sup>2</sup> remains constant until the compensatory increase in (SaO<sup>2</sup> – SvO<sup>2</sup> ) reaches 50% and the SvO<sup>2</sup> drops to 50%. Beyond this point, the VO<sup>2</sup> becomes "supply dependent", which indicates the onset of aerobic metabolism. Note also that when the SaO<sup>2</sup> is constant, the increase in O<sup>2</sup> extraction is equivalent to the decrease in SvO<sup>2</sup> .

According to the control system for VO<sup>2</sup> just described, *the SvO<sup>2</sup> will change in the same direction as changes in O<sup>2</sup> delivery*, and thus a decrease in SVO<sup>2</sup> can be used as evidence of a decrease in O<sup>2</sup> delivery. The SvO<sup>2</sup> is ideally measured in "mixed venous" blood in the pulmonary arteries, but the more accessible "central venous" O<sup>2</sup> saturation (ScvO<sup>2</sup> ) in the superior vena cava is the popular measure. The ScvO<sup>2</sup> can differ significantly from the mixed venous SvO<sup>2</sup> (see Chapter 9), and trends in the ScvO<sup>2</sup> are considered more reliable that individual measurements (25).

### *Using the ScvO<sup>2</sup>*

The following are some general guidelines for interpreting the ScvO<sup>2</sup> , which are summarized in [Table](#page-8-0) 11.2 (23). These recommendations are based on the assumption that the VO<sup>2</sup> is constant, and is neither abnormally high or low.

- 1. The ScvO<sup>2</sup> is normally about 70–75%, although occasional measurements are as low as 65% or as high as 80% (23).
- 2. An ScvO<sup>2</sup> that is <65% is evidence of a decrease in O<sup>2</sup> delivery. However, it is not necessarily evidence of tissue hypoperfusion, because anemia and hypoxemia are other potential causes of a decrease in O<sup>2</sup> delivery. (See Equation 9.8 for the determinants of O<sup>2</sup> delivery.) Hypoxemia is not a common culprit (because it is not allowed to persist), but anemia should be ruled out.
- 3. A decrease in ScvO<sup>2</sup> to ≤50% indicates that tissue oxygenation may be threatened or even impaired. In this situation, prompt corrective measures (e.g., fluid resuscitation or red blood cell transfusion) are warranted, and the plasma lactate level should be measured.
- 4. The ScvO<sup>2</sup> can be higher than expected in patients with septic shock, and may reach levels above 80%. This is commonly attributed to peripheral shunting from high flow rates, but the most likely source is a defect in O<sup>2</sup> utilization in tissues. (This is described in more detail in Chapter 17.) In this situation, the PCO<sup>2</sup> gap can help to uncover tissue hypoperfusion.

**ANEMIA:** A decrease in ScvO<sup>2</sup> can be a consequence of anemia; an ScvO<sup>2</sup> <70% has been proposed as an indication for red blood cell transfusions (26). When the ScvO<sup>2</sup> is <65% and anemia is present, the PCO<sup>2</sup> gap can help to determine if hypoperfusion is present.

### **The PCO<sup>2</sup> Gap**

The PCO<sup>2</sup> gap refers to the difference in PCO<sup>2</sup> between venous and arterial blood, which is a function of blood flow. This can be explained using the Fick principle to derive the rate of CO<sup>2</sup> production (VCO<sup>2</sup> ); i.e.,

$$VCO_2 = CO \times (CvCO_2 - CaCO_2)$$
 (11.4)

where CO is cardiac output and (CvCO<sup>2</sup> – CaCO<sup>2</sup> ) is the difference in CO<sup>2</sup> content between venous and arterial blood. The CO<sup>2</sup> content can be expressed as the product of the PCO<sup>2</sup> and a dissociation constant (k), so [Equation](#page-7-1) 11.3 can be rewritten as (23):

$$VCO_2 = CO \times k \times (PvCO_2 - PaCO_2)$$
 (11.5)

Rearranging the terms then yields the following relationships:

$$(PvCO2 - PaCO2) = VCO2/CO x k$$
 (11.6)

This equation reveals that *the venoarterial PCO<sup>2</sup> difference (the PCO<sup>2</sup> gap), is inversely related to the cardiac output,* and thus a decrease in cardiac output will increase the PCO<sup>2</sup> gap (27).

The PCO<sup>2</sup> gap is thus a reflection of the CO<sup>2</sup> washout from tissues. Carbon dioxide is a major product of metabolism, and must be continually removed in venous blood. Impaired tissue perfusion leads to a buildup of CO<sup>2</sup> in tissues and, because CO<sup>2</sup> is highly diffusible, this results in an increase in the venous PCO<sup>2</sup> (and an increase in the PCO<sup>2</sup> gap).

### *Using the PCO<sup>2</sup> Gap*

The PCO<sup>2</sup> gap is a specific marker of tissue hypoperfusion, and it has been recommended as a target of fluid resuscitation in patients with circulatory shock, including septic shock (23,24,27,28). The following is a summary of the relevant points about the PCO<sup>2</sup> gap.

- 1. The venous PCO<sup>2</sup> in the superior vena cava is used for the PCO<sup>2</sup> gap.
- 2. The normal PCO<sup>2</sup> gap is 2–5 mm Hg (0.3 0.7 kPa).
- 3. A PCO<sup>2</sup> gap that is >6 mm Hg (>0.8 kPa) is evidence of tissue hypoperfusion (27).
- 4. The PCO<sup>2</sup> gap provides no information about the adequacy of tissue oxygenation, and a normal PCO<sup>2</sup> gap does not rule out impaired tissue oxygenation.
- 5. The Haldane effect (i.e., hypoxia increases CO<sup>2</sup> binding to hemoglobin) alters the relationship between the PCO<sup>2</sup> and CO<sup>2</sup> content in venous blood, and this can affect the reliability of the PCO<sup>2</sup> gap. However, the clinical significance of this is unclear.

#### *Comment*

The PCO<sup>2</sup> gap has two advantages over the ScvO<sup>2</sup> : 1) It is more specific for detecting tissue hypoperfusion, and 2) the reliability is not affected by septic shock. Because of these advantages,

the PCO<sup>2</sup> gap should be preferred for monitoring tissue perfusion, especially in patients with septic shock or anemia. However, because the PCO<sup>2</sup> gap cannot detect impaired tissue oxygenation, combining both measurements may be the optimal approach in critically ill patients.

### **FLUID RESPONSIVENESS**

Aggressive fluid resuscitation is common in hemodynamically unstable patients, but *only about 50% of hemodynamically unstable patients show a beneficial response to fluids* (i.e., an increase in cardiac stroke output) (29). Therefore, evaluating patients for fluid responsiveness should have a significant impact on iatrogenic fluid overload. It is important to emphasize that *fluid responsiveness does not imply hypovolemia,* since patients who are normovolemic or even hypervolemic can be fluid responsive.

#### *The Fluid Challenge*

The standard method for determining fluid responsiveness is to administer a fluid bolus, which is usually *500 mL of a crystalloid fluid infused over 10–15 minutes* (30,31). The rate of infusion is more important than the volume infused (30).

#### *The Response*

A positive response to a fluid challenge is defined as a >10% increase in stroke volume (31). This response peaks within minutes after the bolus, and dissipates after 10 minutes (32), which is too evanescent to be measured by the thermodilution technique using pulmonary artery catheters. Two methods of continuous cardiac output monitoring are favored in this situation, as described next.

**PULSE CONTOUR ANALYSIS:** The arterial pressure waveform can be used to measure the stroke volume, as illustrated in the upper panel of [Figure](#page-11-0) 11.5 (33). The shaded "area under the curve" (AUC) represents the systolic portion of the waveform. The stroke volume is directly related to the AUC, and is inversely related to the cardiac afterload (i.e., aortic compliance and resistance). This method requires an arterial catheter, a suitable arterial pressure waveform, and a regular cardiac rhythm. Measurements obtained with a commercially available monitoring system (FloTrac® System, Edwards Laboratories, Irvine, CA) are accurate in most patients, but can slightly underestimate the stroke volume in conditions of low vascular resistance (e.g., septic shock) (34). However, the system is considered reliable for evaluating fluid responsiveness (34).

**ESOPHAGEAL DOPPLER METHOD:** Continuous cardiac output monitoring is also possible with a Doppler probe placed in the distal esophagus to measure flow velocity in the descending thoracic aorta. The area under the aortic velocity wave is then multiplied by the aortic cross-sectional area to derive the stroke volume (35). Measurements obtained with this method compare favorably with the thermodilution method of measuring cardiac output (the gold standard) (36), but aortic stenosis produces spurious recordings (35).

<span id="page-11-0"></span>![](_page_11_Figure_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 11.5** The upper panel shows the pulse contour method of measuring the stroke volume (SV), where the area under the curve (AUC) represents the systolic portion of the arterial pressure waveform. The lower panel demonstrates the respiratory variation in stroke volume that occurs during mechanical ventilation, and shows how this stroke volume variation (SVV) is quantified. See text for further explanation.

### **No Fluid Challenge**

The use of fluid boluses to evaluate fluid responsiveness can be counterproductive by adding to the problem of fluid overload. This is not a concern with the following "fluid-free" methods of evaluating fluid responsiveness.

#### *Stroke Volume Variation*

During controlled mechanical ventilation, the positive-pressure lung inflation is accompanied by an increase in cardiac stroke output, as illustrated in lower panel of [Figure](#page-11-0) 11.5. This is explained by the ability of positive intrathoracic pressure to decrease left ventricular afterload (see Chapter 26), and this effect produces cyclical changes in stroke volume during mechanical ventilation. This stroke volume variation (SVV) can be quantified as shown in [Figure](#page-11-0) 11.5, and clinical studies have shown that an SVV of ≥15% can identify fluid responsiveness in 80% of cases (37). SVV monitoring is restricted to patients who have no breathing efforts and no arrhythmias, and this limits its use.

#### *Passive Leg Raising*

Elevating the legs to 45° above the horizontal plane will move about 300 mL of blood out of the lower extremities and towards the heart (38), thereby serving as a "built-in" fluid challenge. This passive leg raising (PLR) maneuver has been shown to promote venous return by increasing mean systemic pressure (39). The subsequent increase in stroke volume is rapid, and can dissipate in minutes (38). A ≥10% increase in stroke volume after PLR has a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 92% for identifying a positive response to a fluid bolus (40). False negative results are common in patients with increased intraabdominal pressure (41).

**FIGURE 11.6** The passive leg raising test for fluid responsiveness. See text for explanation.

The PLR test is performed on spontaneously breathing patients (on or off the ventilator), and the response is evaluated using a method of continuous cardiac output monitoring (e.g., pulse contour analysis). Blood pressure monitoring alone is not adequate for evaluating the response (38). The test is illustrated in [Figure](#page-13-0) 11.6, and should proceed as follows (using the numbers that correspond to each panel in the figure):

- 1. The patient should be in a semirecumbent position (head up at 30–45°) at the beginning of the test, since starting from the supine position will eliminate the contribution of blood mobilized from the splanchnic circulation (38).
- 2. After baseline measurements of stroke volume, the hospital bed is used to move the patient into a position where the trunk is horizontal and the legs are elevated to 30–45°. (The bed is used for this purpose to reduce pain from shifting positions, which could produce a false positive result.)
- 3. If there is a positive response (i.e., a ≥10% increase in stroke volume) that persists after a few minutes, the patient should be moved back to a semirecumbent position, and the response should dissipate.

As mentioned, pain triggered by the change in position can produce a positive response to PLR, and this should be suspected if the response is accompanied by tachycardia (since PLR should not cause tachycardia) (38), or if the response persists after returning the patient to a semirecumbent position.

### **Comment**

The need for continuous cardiac output monitoring to evaluate fluid responsiveness creates several drawbacks, including costly equipment, the need for trained personnel (for esophageal Doppler monitoring) or a radial artery catheter (for pulse contour analysis), plus a regular cardiac rhythm, and (for monitoring stroke volume variation) patients with little or no spontaneous breathing efforts. Noninvasive methods (e.g., respiratory variations in pulse pressure, changes in end-tidal PCO<sup>2</sup> after passive leg raising) have been evaluated, but none have proven reliable enough to replace existing methods.

#### *Considerations*

The goal of determining fluid responsiveness is to reduce the risk of iatrogenic fluid overload, but it seems that this can be achieved with less costly and convoluted methods, such as the ones listed below.

- 1. When aggressive fluid resuscitation is indicated (e.g., for the initial management of hypotension), using a combination of colloid and crystalloid fluids instead of crystalloid fluids alone will reduce the volume requirement.
- 2. If there is no clinical response to the initial period of fluid resuscitation, then prompt deescalation of the fluid regimen is indicated.
- 3. Avoid daily maintenance fluids if there is adequate oral or enteral fluid intake.
- 4. Pay attention to daily fluid intake and output, and correct positive daily fluid balances

promptly (with a diuretic if needed). This will prevent "fluid creep", which is a common and often overlooked source of iatrogenic fluid overload (42).

### **A FINAL WORD**

### **Getting Rid of Fluid**

The human body responds to fluid deprivation by conserving salt and water, which is a robust protective response with multiple components (e.g., activation of the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system, release of ADH). On the other end of the spectrum, our ability to protect against fluid overload seems feeble by comparison. For example, it can take over 2 days to excrete a 2-liter infusion of isotonic saline (43). This discrepancy could be a reflection of fluid control systems that operate at a low baseline level, where activating the system will have a far greater impact than inhibiting it. The sluggish response to fluids could also be a distribution problem, since most of the infused volume of crystalloid fluids is distributed outside the vascular space (where it is unlikely to trigger any type of compensatory response). Whatever the reason, our apparent meager ability to deal with fluid excess emphasizes the value of a conservative approach to intravenous fluid therapy.
