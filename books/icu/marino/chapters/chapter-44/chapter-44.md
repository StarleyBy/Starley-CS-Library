# **Fever in the ICU**

*Give me the power to produce fever, and I will cure all diseases.*

Parmenides (ca. 500 B.C.)

The appearance of a new fever is always a matter of concern in a hospitalized patient. This chapter presents a practical approach to a new-onset fever in the ICU, and includes the preferred methods of measuring body temperature and obtaining blood cultures, and the most likely sources of fever in ICU patients, both noninfectious and infectious ([1\)](#page-13-0). The final section of the chapter focuses on the practice of suppressing fever, and why Parmenides would disapprove of this practice.

# **FEVER BASICS**

Two scales (Celsius and Fahrenheit) are used to record body temperature, and the conversion from one scale to the other is shown in [Table](#page-1-0) 44.1. Readings on the Celsius scale are often called "degrees centigrade", but this unit is intended for the degrees on a compass, not for temperatures (2).

# **Thermometry**

- 1. The preferred method of measuring body temperature is a thermistor-equipped catheter placed in either the pulmonary artery, esophagus, or urinary bladder [\(1](#page-13-0)). These catheters provide the most accurate measure of core body temperature, and they also allow continuous temperature monitoring.
- 2. If the above methods are not available, then oral or rectal temperatures are preferred [\(1](#page-13-0)). However, oral temperatures can be 0.5° C (0.9° F) lower than core body temperatures in patients with tachypnea (3).
- 3. Peripheral temperature measurements (i.e., tympanic membrane, temporal artery, and axillary temperatures) do not have clinically acceptable accuracy (4), and should not be used to make decisions based on the body temperature.

#### **Definition of Fever**

The body temperature has a diurnal variation, with the nadir in the early morning (between 4 and 8 AM) and the peak in the late afternoon (between 4 and 6 PM). The range of diurnal variation varies for each patient, and can be as high as 1.3° C (2.4° F) (5). Fever is best defined as a temperature that exceeds the normal diurnal variation for each patient, but this is not useful clinically (since the diurnal variation for each patients is usually not known). The following definitions of fever are included in the most recent clinical practice guidelines on fever in the ICU ([1\)](#page-13-0):

- 1. In ICU patients, a single temperature measurement of 38.3° C (101° F) or higher represents a fever, and deserves further evaluation.
- 2. A lower threshold of 38.0° C (100.4° F) can be used for neutropenic patients if the temperature elevation is sustained for at least one hour.

# **The Febrile Response**

Fever is the result of inflammatory cytokines (called endogenous pyrogens) that act on the hypothalamus to elevate the body temperature. Therefore, any condition that triggers a systemic inflammatory response will produce a fever. Some implications of the febrile response are stated below.

- 1. *Fever is a sign of inflammation, not infection*, and about 50% of ICU patients who develop a fever have no evidence of infection (6,7).
- 2. The presence or severity of fever does not correlate with the presence or severity of infection. High fevers can be the result of a noninfectious process, while fever can be absent in lifethreatening infections.

The distinction between inflammation and infection is an important one, not only for the evaluation of fever, but also for curtailing the unnecessary use of antibiotics.

#### *Fever as an Adaptive Response*

Whereas hyperthermia is the result of abnormal temperature regulation (see Chapter 43), fever is

characterized by a normal thermoregulatory system that is operating at a higher set point (8). The consensus view is that fever is not a pathological condition, but rather is an adaptive response that enhances inherent defenses against infection (9). The beneficial effects of fever are described later in the chapter.

**FIGURE 44.1** Potential sources of new-onset fever in the ICU.

### **Sources of Fever**

Any condition capable of triggering an inflammatory response is capable of causing a fever. The notable sources of nosocomial fever in the ICU are shown in [Figure](#page-2-0) 44.1.

# **NONINFECTIOUS SOURCES OF FEVER**

As mentioned earlier, infection is responsible for only half of ICU-acquired fevers (6.7). The noninfectious conditions listed in [Table](#page-2-1) 44.2 are responsible for most of the remaining fevers.

<span id="page-2-1"></span>

| TABLE<br>44.2             | Noninfectious<br>Causes<br>of<br>Fever<br>in<br>the<br>ICU |  |  |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--|--|
| More Common               | Less Common                                                |  |  |

# **Early Postoperative Fever**

Major surgery is a source of tissue injury. Because inflammation and fever are the normal response to tissue injury, it is no surprise that fever in the first postoperative day is reported in 15–40% of cases of major surgery (10–12). In most cases, there is no evidence of infection (10,11), and the fever resolves in 24 to 48 hours.

#### *Atelectasis Does NOT Cause Fever*

There is a longstanding misconception that atelectasis is responsible for early postoperative fevers. One possible source of this misconception is the high incidence of atelectasis in patients who develop a postoperative fever. This is demonstrated in [Figure](#page-3-0) 44.2 (see the graph on the left), which is from a study involving patients who underwent open heart surgery (12). Close to 90% of the patients with a fever on the first postoperative day had radiographic evidence of atelectasis. This, however, is *not* evidence that the atelectasis is the source of fever. In fact, the graph on the right in [Figure](#page-3-0) 44.2 shows that most (75%) of the patients with atelectasis did not have a fever. The inability of atelectasis to produce fever was demonstrated over 50 years ago in an animal study where lobar atelectasis produced by ligation of a mainstem bronchus was not accompanied by fever (13).

<span id="page-3-0"></span>![](_page_3_Figure_6.jpeg)

**FIGURE 44.2** The relationships between fever and atelectasis in the first postoperative day following open heart surgery for 100 patients. The graph on the left shows that most patients with fever had atelectasis, but the graph on the right shows that most patients with atelectasis did not have a fever. Data from Reference 12.

To summarize, atelectasis is a common complication of major surgery, and occurs in over 90% of cases of general anesthesia (14). However, it is not a common cause of postoperative fever. *Most fevers that appear in the first 24 hours after surgery are the result of the tissue injury sustained during the procedure*.

#### *Malignant Hyperthermia*

An uncommon but treatable cause of elevated body temperatures in the immediate postoperative period is *malignant hyperthermia* (15), an inherited disorder characterized by hyperpyrexia (temperature >104° F), muscle rigidity, and rhabdomyolysis in response to halogenated inhalational anesthetics. This disorder is described in Chapter 43.

### **Venous Thromboembolism**

There are numerous risk factors for venous thromboembolism in ICU patients (see Table 5.1 and Figure 5.1), but the risk is highest in trauma victims and postoperative patients. Hospitalacquired deep vein thrombosis is usually asymptomatic, but acute pulmonary embolism can produce a fever that lasts for one week (16). The diagnostic approach to acute pulmonary embolism is described in Chapter 22.

### **Blood Transfusions**

Transfusions of red blood cells (RBCs) and platelet products can trigger febrile reactions.

#### *RBC Transfusions*

Nonhemolytic fever is the most common adverse reaction to RBC transfusions (see Table 12.5), and usually appears during the transfusion, or within 6 hours after the transfusion is completed. These reactions are the result of antileukocyte antibodies in the recipient that react with donor leukocytes, and they are more likely to occur in patients who have received multiple transfusions.

#### *Platelet Transfusions*

Nonhemolytic fever is one of the more cited adverse reactions to platelet transfusions, especially with single-donor platelets (see Table 13.4). However, these reactions are infrequent (e.g., about one per 1,000 units transfused for single-donor platelets) (17).

# **Drug Fever**

Drug-induced fever is typically a hypersensitivity reaction, but can also be an idiosyncratic reaction. Any drug can potentially trigger a febrile response, but the ones reported most frequently are listed in [Table](#page-4-0) 44.3 (18,19).

There is no standard description for drug fever. The onset of the fever varies from a few days to more than a month after the start of drug therapy, and the fever can appear as an isolated finding, or it can be accompanied by the other manifestations listed in [Table](#page-4-0) 44.3 (20). Note that about half of the patients have rigors, and about 20% develop hypotension, indicating that *patients with a drug fever can appear to be seriously ill*. Evidence of a hypersensitivity reaction (i.e., eosinophilia and rash) is absent in over 75% of cases of drug fever (20).

<span id="page-4-0"></span>

| TABLE<br>44.3     | Drug-Associated<br>Fever |  |
|-------------------|--------------------------|--|
| Common Offendersa | Clinical Findingsb       |  |
| Amphotericin      | Rigors (53%)             |  |

| Carbamazepine  | Myalgias (25%)     |  |
|----------------|--------------------|--|
| Cephalosporins | Leukocytosis (22%) |  |
| Heparins       | Eosinophilia (22%) |  |
| Penicillins    | Rash (18%)         |  |
| Phenytoin      | Hypotension (18%)  |  |
| Procainamide   |                    |  |
| Quinidine      |                    |  |

aFor a more complete list, see Reference 18. bFrom Reference 20.

Suspicion of drug fever usually occurs when there are no other likely sources of fever. When suspected, possible offending drugs should be discontinued, and the fever should disappear within 72 hours (18).

### **Other Sources**

The following are other some noninfectious causes of fever that deserve mention:

- 1. Severe withdrawal from alcohol, opiates, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and possibly gabapentin, can cause a fever that typically appears a few days after abstinence.
- 2. Adrenal insufficiency is a recognized cause of fever, and can be the result of spontaneous adrenal hemorrhage from anticoagulant therapy or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is described in Chapter 51.
- 3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an inflammatory lung injury from multiple sources that can produce a fever. This condition is described in detail in Chapter 24.
- 4. Infarctions of the heart, brain, and bowel are potential sources of fever.
- 5. The serotonin syndrome, which is accompanied by fever, can be a complication of treatment with critical care drugs like fentanyl, tramadol, and linezolid (see Table 43.4).

#### *Iatrogenic Fever*

Faulty thermal regulators in water mattresses and aerosol humidifiers can cause fever by transference (21). It takes only a minute to check the temperature settings on heated mattresses and ventilators, but it can take far longer to explain why such a simple cause of fever was overlooked.

# **NOSOCOMIAL INFECTIONS**

The major ICU-acquired infections are pneumonias (especially ventilator-associated pneumonias), bloodstream infections from vascular catheters, urinary tract infections, surgical site infections, and *Clostridium difficile* infections: [Table](#page-6-0) 44.4 shows the number of each of these infections reported in the United States over a one-year period (22). All but one of these infections is described elsewhere in the book: i.e., catheter-related bloodstream infections are described in Chapter 3, ventilator-associated pneumonia in Chapter 29, *C. difficile* infections in Chapter 41, and urinary tract infections in Chapter 42.

# **Surgical Site Infections**

Surgical site infections (SSIs) continue to be a significant source of postoperative morbidity despite a long history of preventive efforts. These infections typically appear 5–7 days after surgery, but any wound infection that develops within 30 days following surgery is classified as an SSI (23). Infected wounds are identified by signs of local inflammation (erythema, edema, tenderness), and by purulent or foul-smelling drainage. Superficial infections are less likely to produce fever than infections with deep tissue involvement.

There are multiple risk factors for SSIs, including the condition of the patient and the type of procedure. The reported incidence of SSIs is 1–2% following clean procedures (where the chest or abdomen is not opened), and 4–5% following contaminated procedures (e.g., bowel perforation with soilage of the peritoneal cavity) (24). The pathogens involved in SSIs are also determined by the surgical procedure: e.g., SSIs from clean surgical procedures usually involve *Staphylococcus aureus*, while SSIs from contaminated procedures often involve gram-negative aerobic bacilli (24).

<sup>\*</sup>A ventilator-associated event is a respiratory infection (tracheobroncitis or pneumonia) that appears after 48 hours of mechanical ventilation, and results in an increased requirement for inhaled O<sup>2</sup> or PEEP. Data from Reference 21.

#### *Management*

Management of SSIs includes debridement, with antibiotics added if there is a fever. For initial antibiotic coverage, vancomycin is appropriate if *Staphylococcus aureus* is suspected, and for contaminated procedures (e.g., abdominal surgery), either *piperacillin/tazobactam*, or a third generation cephalosporin (e.g., *ceftriaxone*) plus *metronidazole* is advised (25).

#### *Necrotizing Wound Infections*

Necrotizing wound infections are evident in the first few postoperative days. Early signs include marked erythema and edema, and *pain that is out of proportion to the skin changes* (due to ischemic nerve injury) (26). Crepitance and skin blistering are later findings. Spread to deeper structures (with rhabdomyolysis) is rapid, and a milky or foul-smelling discharge may be evident (from the underlying necrosis). These infections can be caused by a single organism (usually βhemolytic streptococci or *Clostridium* species), or they can be polymicrobial (usually a mix of gram-negative enteric organisms and anaerobes) (26).

**MANAGEMENT:** *Emergent and extensive debridement is mandatory for survival*, along with appropriate antibiotic therapy. A Gram stain can help with the initial antibiotic selection. If

streptococci or clostridial organisms are suspected, the appropriate regimen is *penicillin plus clindamycin*, and if the surgery involved the deep structures in the abdomen or thorax, then a carbapenem (e.g., *meropenem*) is advised (25).

### **Other Considerations**

The following are infections that should be considered in specific situations.

#### *Endocarditis*

Nosocomial endocarditis is uncommon, but an evaluation for endocarditis is indicated in the following situations:

- 1. Any patient with bacteremia involving streptococci, staphylococci, or enterococci, who also has an abnormal or prosthetic heart valve.
- 2. All patients with blood cultures growing *Staphylococcus aureus*, regardless of the condition of the heart valves.

**DIAGNOSIS:** Echocardiography is the standard method used to diagnose endocarditis. The evaluation can begin with *transthoracic echocardiography* (TTE), which is easily obtained at the bedside. However, TTE has a limited sensitivity for the detection of vegetations on native valves (sensitivity of 60%–70%), and especially on prosthetic valves (sensitivity of 50%) (27), so a negative TTE must be followed by *transesophageal echocardiography* (TEE), which has a sensitivity of at least 90% for the detection of vegetations on native and prosthetic valves (27).

**THERAPY:** The antimicrobial therapy for endocarditis has several variations (depending on the infecting organism, patterns of resistance, and the involvement of a native or prosthetic valve), and it is a prolonged affair that can be marred by complications (e.g., emboli) (28). It thus seems wise to have an infectious disease specialist guide the treatment of these infections.

#### *Peritoneal Infections*

- 1. Peritonitis or intra-abdominal abscess should be suspected in any patient who has had extensive or contaminated abdominal surgery and has a persistent or late-onset (one week or later) postoperative fever. These infections are described in Chapter 41.
- 2. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is a consideration in any patient with cirrhosis and ascites who develops an unexplained fever. This infection is described in Chapter 39.

#### *Disseminated Candidiasis*

Risk factors for disseminated candidiasis include indwelling central venous catheters, recent abdominal surgery, or recent exposure to broad spectrum antibiotics. Most ICU patients have at least one of these risk factors, so *disseminated candidiasis should be considered in the following situations*:

- 1. Any ICU patient with persistent fever of unclear etiology.
- 2. A patient with a *Candida* urinary tract infection.

**DIAGNOSIS:** Disseminated candidiasis is a challenging diagnosis because ICU patients are often colonized with *Candida* species, and the sensitivity of blood cultures for the detection of invasive *Candida* infections is as low as 20% (29). However, *a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based test is commercially available that can detect Candida species in blood with a sensitivity and specificity >90%* (30), and this test should be considered (if available) for patients with possible invasive candidiasis. Persistent candiduria or a *Candida* urinary tract infection is usually a consequence of disseminated candidiasis (31), so this can be a valuable sign of invasive disease.

**ANTIFUNGAL TREATMENT:** About half of the cases of disseminated candidiasis are due to *Candida* species other than *Candida albicans*, so fluconazole is not appropriate for empiric coverage. Instead, empiric antifungal coverage should include an echinocandin (i.e., *micafungin, caspofungin,* or *anidulafungin*) or *amphotericin* for severely ill patients.

# **GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS**

The evaluation of fever can travel many roads, but the following measures are included in most evaluations.

### **Blood Cultures**

Blood cultures are recommended for all cases of ICU-related fever where an infection is possible. The yield from blood cultures is dependent on the volume of blood withdrawn during a venipuncture, and the number of venipuncture sites.

#### *Influence of Volume*

The yield from blood cultures is optimal when 20–30 mL of blood is withdrawn from each venipuncture site (32). The standard practice is to withdraw 20 mL of blood from a venipuncture site: one-half (10 mL) is then injected into each of the two bottles of broth (one aerobic and one anaerobic) provided in a blood culture set. Increasing from 20 ml to 30 mL of blood increases the yield from blood cultures by about 10% (33). When using 30 mL per venipuncture, the extra 10 mL aliquot of blood should be injected into the aerobic broth bottle (33).

#### *Number of Blood Cultures*

The relationship between the number of blood cultures and the detection of bacteremia is shown in [Figure](#page-9-0) 44.3 (34). (*Note:* The number of blood cultures represents the number of venipuncture sites.) This is from a study of patients with bacteremia documented by four or more blood cultures drawn over a 24 hour period. Note that the majority of the bacteremias (94%) were detected with two blood cultures in the patients with endocarditis, while three blood cultures were required to detect over 90% of the bacteremias in patients with other infections. This data is the basis for the following recommendations:

- 1. Three to four blood cultures drawn over a 24-hour period is recommended for the optimal detection of bacteremia [\(1](#page-13-0)).
- 2. Two blood cultures are satisfactory for detecting bacteremia in cases of endocarditis.

The bacteremia in endocarditis is continuous, which may explain why fewer blood cultures are needed to detect bacteremia.

#### *Multilumen Catheters*

The following recommendation pertains to the evaluation of possible catheter-related septicemia with multilumen central venous catheters ([1\)](#page-13-0).

- 1. For multilumen catheters, separate blood cultures should be drawn through two lumens of the catheter, along with a blood culture from a peripheral venipuncture site. *Note:* Cultures from a single port can miss as many as 40% of catheter-related infections (35).
- <span id="page-9-0"></span>2. If the same organism is isolated in catheter and peripheral blood, then the "time to positivity" is compared. When growth in catheter blood appears at least two hours before growth in peripheral blood, the diagnosis is catheter-related septicemia.

![](_page_9_Figure_5.jpeg)

**FIGURE 44.3** Relationship between the number of blood cultures drawn over a 24 hour period (20 mL per blood culture) and the detection rate for bacteremia. See text for explanation. Data from Reference 34.

Each lumen of a multilumen catheter is a potential source of septicemia (36). so the optimal strategy would be to culture all ports of the catheter. (The diagnosis of catheter-related septicemia is described in detail in Chapter 3.)

# **Molecular Testing**

Growth in blood cultures often takes 48 hours or longer to detect, which has disadvantages (e.g., it delays treatment with appropriate antibiotics when cultures are positive, and promotes the overuse of antibiotics when cultures are negative). More rapid detection of organisms in the bloodstream is possible using DNA amplification (like the PCR method mentioned earlier for

detecting candidemia), and a commercially available product is available (T2Bacteria® Panel, T2Biosystems, Lexington MA) that can detect six bacterial species (*E. coli, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, E. faecium,* and *A. baumannni*) with a sensitivity and specificity of 90% (37). Results can be available in 3–5 hours.

The value of the rapid detection methodology for improving outcomes has yet to be determined, but seems questionable, since a positive test still requires culture results for antibiotic sensitivities, and a negative test does not rule out infection with other organisms.

## **Empiric Antimicrobial Therapy**

Empiric antibiotic therapy is recommended when the likelihood of infection is high. Prompt initiation of antimicrobial therapy is considered essential, *particularly in patients with neutropenia* (absolute neutrophil count <500), where delays of only a few hours can have a negative impact on outcomes (38).

Empiric antibiotic coverage is described elsewhere in the book for ventilator-associated pneumonia (see Table 29.6), catheter-related bloodstream infections (see Table 3.6), catheterassociated urinary tract infections (see Chapter 42), and surgical site infections (see earlier in this chapter). The following are some general statements about empiric antibiotics for ICU-related fever.

- 1. Most ICU-related infections are caused by *Staphylococcus aureus*, or bowel microbes (e.g., *E. coli, P. aeruginosa, C. difficile, Enterococcus* spp).
- 2. Empiric coverage for the major ICU-related infections (i.e., pneumonia, vascular catheter infections, urinary tract infections, postop abdominal infections) should include an antibiotic that is active against gram-negative aerobic bacilli. Popular choices are *piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime,* or *meropenem*.
- 3. Coverage for *S. aureus* should be included for suspected catheter-related infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Vancomycin is a popular choice because it covers both methicillin-resistant and methicillin-sensitive strains of *S. aureus*.
- 4. An antifungal agent should be considered for patients who have a risk of invasive candidiasis (e.g., those with central venous catheters) who also have: (*a*) persistent fever of unclear etiology, (*b*) fever following contaminated bowel surgery, or (*c*) fever associated with persistent candiduria. An agent that covers all *Candida* species (such as an echinocandin) is most appropriate.

# **ANTIPYRETIC THERAPY**

The popular perception of fever as a malady that must be corrected is rooted in hearsay. In fact, it seems that *fever is a normal adaptive response that enhances the ability to eradicate infection* (9). This section contains some observations about fever that are intended to make you think twice about starting antipyretic therapy in critically ill patients.

#### **Fever as a Host Defense Mechanism**

An increase in body temperature can enhance immune function by increasing the production of

antibodies and cytokines, activating T-lymphocytes, facilitating neutrophil chemotaxis, and enhancing phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages (39,40). Fever also inhibits bacterial growth and viral replication. This is demonstrated in [Figure](#page-11-0) 44.4 (41), which shows that an increase in temperature of 4° C completely suppresses growth of the microorganism.

#### *Clinical Studies*

The benefits of fever as a host defense against infection is supported by clinical studies showing an inverse relationship between body temperature and survival in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock (42–44). The results of one of these studies is shown in [Figure](#page-12-0) 44.5. In this case, the initial body temperature showed an inverse relationship with in-hospital mortality in patients admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis or septic shock (42).

Similar results have been reported in other studies (43,44), including a study that showed a higher mortality rate in septic patients who received antipyretic therapy (45).

**FIGURE 44.5** Inverse relationship between body temperature and in-hospital mortality rate in 2,225 patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Differences between categories are significant at the p<0.001 level. Data from Reference 42.

**THERAPEUTIC HYPERTHERMIA:** The evidence of improved outcomes with fever has prompted a study in which afebrile patients with sepsis were treated with external warming to raise their body temperature by 1.5° C, and this resulted in a significant decrease in the mortality rate when compared to afebrile patients who were not warmed (46).

#### **Summation**

The available evidence shows that fever is not a pathological condition, but rather is normal adaptive response that serves an antimicrobial defense mechanism. The changing perception of fever is evident in the most recent clinical practice guidelines on fever in the ICU, which recommends not suppressing fever as a routine practice [\(1](#page-13-0)).

*Note:* It is important to mention that fever *can* be harmful (and thus should be suppressed) in patients with ischemic brain injury from a cardiac arrest or acute stroke.

# **Antipyretic Drugs**

Prostaglandin E mediates the febrile response to endogenous pyrogens, and drugs that interfere with prostaglandin E synthesis are used as antipyretic agents. These drugs include aspirin, acetaminophen, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), but only the latter two are used for antipyresis in the ICU.

## *Acetaminophen*

Acetaminophen is an effective antipyretic agent in critically ill patients (47), and is the most popular drug used for fever suppression in ICUs.

**DOSING REGIMENS:** Acetaminophen can be given orally or by rectal suppository in a dose of 650 mg every 6 hours, and an intravenous preparation is available that can be given in a dose of 650 mg every 6 hours, or 1,000 mg every 8 hours. *Caution:* Acetaminophen is hepatotoxic, and *the maximum daily dose that is considered safe is 3 grams* (FDA announcement, January 13, 2011). The drug is contraindicated in patients with hepatic insufficiency. (Acetaminophen hepatotoxicity is described in Chapter 52.)

#### *NSAIDs*

Two NSAIDs have been evaluated for fever suppression in critically ill patients: *ibuprofen* and *ketorolac*. Ibuprofen is effective in an intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg, up to 800 mg every 6 hours (48), and ketorolac is effective in a single intravenous dose of 0.5 mg/kg (49). There is a limited experience with NSAIDs in the ICU, largely due to an exaggerated fear of renal toxicity and GI hemorrhage from the use of these drugs.

# **Cooling Blankets**

External cooling is a popular antipyretic measure, but is counterproductive in the setting of fever. The febrile response raises the body temperature by promoting cutaneous vasoconstriction and increasing skeletal muscle activity (via rigors and shivering). This is what the body normally does in response to a cold environment, so the febrile response mimics the physiological response to cold. Stated another way, *the febrile response makes the body behave like it is wrapped in a cooling blanket*. Adding a cooling blanket will only aggravate the cutaneous vasoconstriction and increased muscle activity (via shivering) that produces the fever. Cooling blankets are more appropriate for heat stroke, where the thermoregulatory response to a warm environment is lost.

# **A FINAL WORD**

#### **The 1927 Nobel Prize**

The 1927 Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to Julius Wagner-Jauregg (an Austrian physician) for his discovery of the therapeutic benefits of fever in patients with neurosyphilis. Warner-Jauregg had observed that remissions in dementia paralytica (neurosyphilis) were often preceded by a febrile illness, and he subsequently performed a bold experiment where he inoculated 9 neurosyphilis patients with tertian malaria (to induce a recurrent fever). Surprisingly, 6 of the 9 patients experienced extensive remissions, with almost complete resolution of symptoms in 3 patients (50). These results were corroborated in other patients, along with the discovery that spirochetes disappeared from brain tissue during the periods of fever, and reappeared when the fever subsided.

The practice of inoculating patients with malaria to treat neurosyphilis was eventually abandoned, because it introduced a disease to treat a disease. Unfortunately, the implications of Wagner-Jauregg's work (i.e., that fever can eradicate infection) were also abandoned.
