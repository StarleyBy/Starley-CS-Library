# **Noninvasive Ventilation**

*We…repeatedly enlarge our instrumentalities without improving our purpose.*

Will Durant (*[a](#page-12-0)*)

Noninvasive positive pressure breathing was introduced in the 1940s (about a decade before conventional mechanical ventilation), but it was delivered through a mouthpiece, and could only be used for brief periods of time (10–15 minutes) (1). For the next 40 years, this method of "intermittent positive pressure breathing" (IPPB) was used for delivering inhaled bronchodilators, and for the prevention of postoperative atelectasis. The use of "continuous positive airway pressure" (CPAP) was introduced in the early 1980s, and rapidly gained traction as a treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (2). This led to improvements in mask design, and by the 1990s, reports began to appear about the use of positive pressure breathing through face masks to manage patients with acute respiratory failure (3). Since that time, the popularity of *noninvasive ventilation* has skyrocketed, but the benefits have been variable (as described in this chapter).

This chapter describes the fundamentals of using noninvasive ventilation, including what to use, what to monitor, and what to expect in different types of acute respiratory failure (4). The last section describes the effects of positive pressure breathing on cardiac performance.

# **METHODS OF NONINVASIVE VENTILATION**

The following is a description of the principal methods of pressure-assisted breathing that do not require endotracheal intubation.

## **Continuous Positive Airway Pressure**

During normal breathing, the descent of the diaphragm creates a negative intrathoracic pressure that draws air into the lungs, and exhalation proceeds passively until the intrathoracic pressure returns to atmospheric (zero reference) pressure). When breathing with "continuous positive airway pressure" (CPAP), the pressure at the end of expiration is positive relative to atmospheric pressure, and the positive pressure is maintained through the respiratory cycle. This is

demonstrated in [Figure](#page-2-0) 26.1, which shows a spontaneous breathing pattern with a positive endexpiratory pressure of 5 cm H2O.

The positive pressure in CPAP is created by a constant flow of air or oxygen that is adjusted to achieve the desired pressure level (usually 5–10 cm H2O). This pressure helps to prevent collapse of the small airways and alveoli at the end of expiration, and increases the endexpiratory lung volume (i.e., the functional residual capacity), but it does not augment the tidal volume.

#### *Clinical Uses*

The principal use of CPAP is in patients with obstructive sleep apnea, where the positive pressure prevents the inspiratory collapse of the pharynx that causes the obstruction to airflow (5). CPAP has also been successful in managing patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (6), for reasons described later in the chapter. Overall, CPAP provides only limited pressure support, and it is rarely used to manage patients with acute respiratory failure.

## **Bi-Level Positive Airway Pressure**

by Philips Respironics), and is used sparingly in this chapter.

Noninvasive ventilation is typically a patient-triggered, pressure-targeted mode of ventilation that provides pressure-augmented tidal volumes along with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) (7). This is illustrated in [Figure](#page-2-0) 26.1. The patient triggers each positive-pressure lung inflation (indicated by the negative pressure swings), and the inspiratory pressure gradually rises until it reaches a pre-selected pressure. Exhalation then proceeds until the pressure reaches a preselected positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Peak inspiratory pressures are typically 10–20 cm H2O, and PEEP levels are usually 5–10 cm H2O. Higher pressure are generally not advised because they are poorly tolerated by patients, and they promote leaks around the face mask. *(Note:* The mode of ventilation just described is typically called *bi-level positive airway pressure*, or simply *BiPAP, however* this is a proprietary name (registered as a trademark name

## **Pressure Support Ventilation**

Pressure support ventilation (PSV) is an interactive form of pressure-targeted ventilation that adjusts the ventilator breath to the ventilatory demands of the patient (7,8). This is explained using the pressure waveform in [Figure](#page-3-0) 26.2. The following statements correspond to the numbers located at different points on the waveform.

- 1. PSV is a patient-triggered mode of ventilation, and the initial negative pressure deflection represents the spontaneous inspiratory effort that triggers the ventilator breath.
- 2. Once the ventilator breath is triggered, high flow rates are used to produce a rapid rise in airway pressure, in order to reach the desired inspiratory pressure as soon as possible.
- 3. When the desired pressure level is achieved, it is kept constant by servo-adjusting the ventilator flow rate to the inspiratory flow demands of the patient.
- 4. The lung inflation is terminated when the patient's inspiratory flow rate drops to 25% of the peak flow.

<span id="page-3-0"></span>![](_page_3_Figure_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 26.2** The pressure waveform in pressure support ventilation (PSV). The numbers at different points on the waveform are explained in the text.

This interaction allows the patient to determine the inflation time and tidal volume, which promotes patient-ventilator synchrony, and reduces the work of breathing (8). PSV is typically reserved for cases of patient-ventilator asynchrony, and is also popular for spontaneous breathing trials used in the process of weaning patients from mechanical ventilation (see Chapter 30).

## **Proportional Assist Ventilation**

Proportional assist ventilation (PAV) is another interactive form of noninvasive ventilation that adjusts the peak inspiratory pressure to the patient's work of breathing (10). This is accomplished by periodic measurements of respiratory mechanics (i.e., compliance and resistance), which are carried out (in a proprietary fashion) by ventilators capable of delivering PAV. There is no evidence that PAV is superior to PSV as a mode of noninvasive ventilation (11).

#### **Face Masks**

The emergence of noninvasive ventilation is largely due to advances in the design of the mask interface. Low-level CPAP can be delivered by nasal masks, but full face masks are required for BiPAP, and the face masks must be tight-fitting to minimize leaks (although most BiPAP machines can compensate for mask leaks). These face masks are [uncomfortable](#page-4-0) (see Figure 26.3), and are poorly tolerated by patients. In addition to general discomfort, masks can cause skin breakdown at points of contact, especially on the bridge of the nose. "Mask intolerance" is a significant source of failed attempts to prevent intubation with noninvasive ventilation. In one study, 18% of the noninvasive ventilation failures were attributed to mask intolerance (12).

**FIGURE 26.3** A tightly-secured face mask used for noninvasive ventilation.

#### *The Helmet*

An alternative to the tight-fitting face masks is available with a device called a "helmet", which is a transparent hood that encloses the entire head, and has a soft collar that provides a seal at the neck. Studies comparing helmets and face masks have shown fewer intubations and even fewer deaths with the use of helmets (13). However, these devices are rarely used in adults.

# **USING NONINVASIVE VENTILATION**

The utility and success of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is determined by several factors, including the type of patient, the type and severity of illness, and the type of respiratory failure.

## **Type of Patient**

The patient selection criteria for NIV are presented as a checklist in [Table](#page-5-0) 26.1. As a general rule, all patients with acute respiratory failure are candidates for NIV if the following criteria are satisfied: (a) the acute respiratory failure is not an immediate threat to life, (b) there is no lifethreatening circulatory collapse, (c) the patient is awake or arousable, and is cooperative, (d) there are no persistent or recurrent seizures, (e) there is no hematemesis or persistent vomiting, and (f) there is no obstruction that will prevent effective ventilatory support through a face mask (e.g., laryngeal mass or edema). These criteria do not apply to patients who refuse intubation and mechanical ventilation, which has been reported in 20% of patients receiving NIV (14).

NIV is a consideration in any case of acute respiratory failure that does not meet the criteria in [Table](#page-5-0) 26.1. However, *the likelihood of success* (i.e., preventing intubation) *is dependent on the type of respiratory failure* (i.e., hypercapnic or purely hypoxemic respiratory failure), *and the underling illness* (see next).

## **Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure**

*The most successful use of NIV is in patients with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure from an acute [exacerbation](#page-6-0) of COPD* (15). The benefits of NIV in this condition are shown in Figure 26.4. The graphs in this figure display the averaged results of 17 clinical studies, and they show that NIV drastically reduces the intubation rate, and has a smaller but significant survival benefit (15). As a result, *noninvasive ventilation is recommended as a first-line therapy for acute exacerbations of COPD that are associated with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure* (4). NIV does not have this benefit when the hypercapnia is chronic (4).

## *Evaluating the Response*

About 10–20% of COPD patients with acute hypercapnia will not respond favorably to NIV (15,16). These patients can be identified by checking the PaCO<sup>2</sup> after one hour of NIV, and comparing it to the baseline PaCO<sup>2</sup> . *Failure of the PaCO<sup>2</sup> to decrease significantly (e.g., by at least 10%) after one hour of NIV is evidence of a poor response; i.e., NIV failure* (16). Altered mentation (e.g., from hypercapnia) can take longer to resolve (17), and should not be used as an early indication of NIV failure.

There is a reluctance to intubate patients with advanced COPD (because of the fear that mechanical ventilation will be a permanent condition), but delays to intubation can also have adverse consequences, and intubation should be a serious consideration at first evidence of NIV failure.

#### *Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome*

Despite a paucity of studies, the available evidence shows that NIV is effective in reducing the intubation rate in patients with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure from the obesity hypoventilation syndrome (18). It seems reasonable to assume that the one-hour PaCO<sup>2</sup> evaluation just described is also valid for this condition.

**FIGURE 26.4** The effects of noninvasive ventilation on intubation rate and mortality rate in patients with acute exacerbation of COPD and hypercapnic respiratory failure. Data represents the pooled results from 17 clinical studies. From Reference 14.

## **Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure**

The success of NIV in hypoxemic respiratory failure is dependent on the underlying condition. This is demonstrated in [Figure](#page-7-0) 26.5, which shows the frequency of NIV failure in a variety of conditions that produce hypoxemic respiratory failure (19–21). The failure rate is lowest in cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and highest in community-acquired pneumonia. In the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the likelihood of failure is dependent on the severity of illness (see also Figure 24.5) (20).

## *Evaluating the Response*

Observations from clinical studies have shown that *failure to increase the PaO<sup>2</sup> /FIO<sup>2</sup> ratio after one hour of NIV is evidence of a poor response; i.e., NIV failure* (19). This should be an indication for intubation if the hypoxemia is severe, or the underlying illness has a high failure rate for NIV.

#### *Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema*

Both CPAP and NIV are highly successful (and equally effective) in cardiogenic pulmonary edema (22). This benefit is not limited to improvements in lung function, because *positive [intrathoracic](#page-9-0) pressure can increase cardiac stroke output* (23,24). This is illustrated in Figure 26.6, which shows the changes in arterial pressure that occur during a positive pressure lung inflation. The positive airway (intrathoracic) pressure is accompanied by a steady rise in arterial pressure, which subsides as the pressure returns to baseline. The shaded areas in the arterial pressure waveforms (which are proportional to stroke volume) show that the increase in arterial pressure is a reflection of an increase in cardiac stroke output. This figure demonstrates that positive intrathoracic pressure increases the stroke output of the left ventricle. This effect is due to a decrease in left ventricular afterload (25), which is explained in the upcoming section on cardiac performance. (*Note:* The respiratory changes in stroke volume during mechanical ventilation can be used to evaluate fluid responsiveness, as shown in Figure 11.5).

#### *The Role of High-Flow Oxygen*

High-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO), which is described in Chapter 25, is traditionally used for cases of hypoxemic respiratory failure when the hypoxemia is refractory to conventional methods of O<sup>2</sup> inhalation. However, HFNO has beneficial effects other than oxygenation, including an increase in lung compliance (distensibility), a decrease in the work of breathing, and a decrease in labored breathing (see Table 25.3) (26,27). These added benefits (which are attributed to the high flow rates) make HFNO a potential alternative to NIV for patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure, and this has been validated in studies showing equivalent intubation rates with HFNO and NIV in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (28). In addition, there is evidence that HFNO is superior to NIV for preventing intubation in immunocompromised patients (29).

The overall evidence indicates that *HFNO is equivalent to NIV for preventing intubation in*

*patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure*, and it may be more effective than NIV in immunocompromised patients. Considering that HFNO avoids the use of face masks, and thus is more comfortable for patients, while also allowing the oral intake of food and medications, it seems that HFNO should be preferred to NIV for patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.

## **CARDIAC PERFORMANCE**

The cardiorespiratory interactions in [Figure](#page-9-0) 26.6 demonstrate that the effects of positive pressure are not limited to the lungs. The cardiac effects of positive pressure breathing are complex, and involve the preload and afterload forces for the right and left sides of the heart (30).

## **Preload**

The term "preload" refers to a force that stretches a resting muscle to a new length. An increase in preload (resting muscle length) increases the force of muscle contraction (as explained by the sliding filament model of muscle contraction). The preload force for the intact heart is the volume in the ventricles at the end of diastole, and *the Frank-Starling law of the heart* states that ventricular end-diastolic volume (preload) is the principal force that governs the strength of ventricular contraction (31). Thus, factors that affect preload can have a profound effect on cardiac output.

<span id="page-9-0"></span>![](_page_9_Figure_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 26.6** Changes in arterial pressure associated with a positive pressure breath. The increase in arterial pressure is a reflection of an increase in left ventricular stroke volume, as indicated by the shaded areas in the arterial pressure waveforms. See text for further explanation.

#### *Positive Intrathoracic Pressure*

Positive intrathoracic pressure can reduce ventricular preload (end-diastolic volume) in a number of ways. These are shown in [Figure](#page-10-0) 26.7, and are summarized below.

- 1. Positive intrathoracic pressure decreases the pressure gradient for venous inflow into the thorax, which decreases right ventricular filling.
- 2. The positive intrathoracic pressures used during mechanical ventilation (noninvasive and invasive) often exceed the pressures in the pulmonary veins, and this compresses the veins and impedes left ventricular filling.
- 3. Ventricular filling is a function of the end-diastolic *transmural* pressure (i.e., across the wall of the ventricles), so a positive pleural pressure will decrease this transmural pressure and thereby impede ventricular filling. This will have a greater effect on right ventricular filling, because the end-diastolic chamber pressure is lower in the right ventricle.
- 4. High intrathoracic pressures will increase pulmonary vascular resistance, and this can impede right ventricular outflow. In patients with right ventricular systolic dysfunction, this can

increase right ventricular volume and push the interventricular septum toward the left ventricle, thereby reducing left ventricular filling.

Positive pressure breathing is thus a real threat to cardiac filling. This threat is magnified by hypovolemia, so avoiding hypovolemia is imperative during positive pressure ventilation (especially when high pressures are required for lung inflation).

<span id="page-10-0"></span>![](_page_10_Picture_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 26.7** The different ways that positive intrathoracic pressure can decrease filling of the right and left ventricles.

#### **Afterload**

The term "afterload" refers to the force that must be overcome by muscle contraction. Unlike the preload force, which facilitates muscle contraction, the afterload force opposes muscle contraction. In the intact heart, *the afterload force is equivalent to the peak transmural wall pressure developed during systole*, which is the pressure needed to eject the stroke volume. This is a somewhat simplified view of afterload (which is more closely related to wall tension, and thus is dependent on wall thickness and chamber size), but it is adequate for describing the effects of positive pressure breathing.

#### *Positive Intrathoracic Pressure*

The determinants of left ventricular afterload are shown in [Figure](#page-11-0) 26.8. There is a tendency to view afterload as a sole function of impedance and resistance in the systemic circulation, but afterload is a *transmural pressure*, and thus is also a function of the pleural pressure surrounding

(26.1) Afterload = Chamber Pressure – Pleural Pressure

The negative intrathoracic (pleural) pressure that occurs during spontaneous breathing will increase left ventricular afterload (by opposing the inward movement of the ventricular wall during systole), and this explains why the systolic blood pressure normally decreases during a spontaneous inspiration. An exaggeration of the inspiratory decrease in systolic blood pressure (>10 mm Hg) is a condition known as *pulsus paradoxus* (which is a misnomer, since the condition is not paradoxical), and this condition can be produced by exaggerated inspiratory efforts (32), as occurs in acute asthma.

<span id="page-11-0"></span>![](_page_11_Figure_3.jpeg)

**FIGURE 26.8** The determinants of left ventricular afterload. See text for explanation.

On the other hand, *positive intrathoracic pressure will decrease left ventricular afterload (by promoting the inward movement of the ventricle during systole)*, and this explains the inspiratory increase in systolic pressure in [Figure](#page-10-0) 26.7. (This change is also known as *reversed pulsus paradoxus*.) Positive intrathoracic pressure thus assists the left ventricle in ejecting the stroke volume. This action is one of the proposed mechanisms for the ability of chest compressions to promote cardiac output (i.e., the thoracic pump model).

## **Cardiac Output**

The overall effect of positive pressure ventilation on cardiac output will be determined by the balance between the preload and afterload effects of positive intrathoracic pressure, and this balance will be determined by three factors: the intravascular volume, the level of the intrathoracic pressure, and the presence or absence of cardiac dysfunction. The role of intravascular volume is mentioned previously, and the role of cardiac function is described next.

#### *The Role of Cardiac Function*

The following statements are based on the relationships between preload, afterload, and cardiac output in the normal and failing heart. These relationships are shown graphically in Figure 16.2.

- 1. The normal heart operates on the steep portion of the preload curve and the flat portion of the afterload curve. In this situation, a decrease in preload has a greater influence on cardiac output than a decrease in afterload, so positive pressure ventilation is more likely to impair cardiac output by its actions to impede ventricular filling.
- 2. In contrast, the failing heart operates on the flat portion of the preload curve and the steep portion of the afterload curve. In this situation, a decrease in afterload has a greater influence on cardiac output than a decrease in preload, so positive pressure ventilation is more likely to promote cardiac output by its actions to reduce left ventricular afterload. This would explain the benefit of CPAP and NIV in cardiogenic pulmonary edema, as described earlier.

These statements have two important implications. First, in patients with normal cardiac function, it is essential to maintain intravascular volume to support venous return during positive pressure ventilation. Second, in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, positive intrathoracic pressure can promote cardiac stroke output as long as it does not impede venous inflow to the right heart.

## **A FINAL WORD**

## **Don't Forget About Intubation**

The popularity of noninvasive ventilation is based on the desire to avoid intubation, but there is a tendency to prolong noninvasive ventilation when there is no evidence of benefit, and this can be harmful. The following statements are relevant in this regard.

- 1. Evidence of benefit should be evident after one hour of noninvasive ventilation. This evidence includes a decrease in PaCO<sup>2</sup> in hypercapnic respiratory failure, an increase in the PaO<sup>2</sup> /FIO<sup>2</sup> ratio in hypoxemic respiratory failure, and alleviation of respiratory distress.
- 2. Continued evidence of respiratory distress is particularly concerning, because it is often associated with increased spontaneous tidal volumes, and this can lead to *patient self-induced lung injury* (33) which is described in Chapter 24 (see Figure 24.4), and has been implicated in the failure of noninvasive ventilation (34).
- 3. Delays to intubation creates unnecessary risk because emergent intubations in patients who are *in extremis* can be troublesome.

Although rarely viewed in a positive light, intubation and mechanical ventilation provide a greater level of ventilatory control, which may be necessary to slow or halt the progression of acute respiratory failure.
