# **Parenteral Nutrition**

*To lengthen thy life, lessen thy meals.*

Benjamin Franklin (*[a](#page-9-0)*)

The intravenous route is used for nutrition support when the enteral route is not feasible, or is unable to provide full nutrition support. This chapter describes the basic features of "parenteral nutrition", and demonstrates how to create a parenteral nutrition regimen for individual patients. The most recent clinical practice guidelines and reviews on the subject are included in the bibliography at the end of the chapter ([1–](#page-9-1)[4\)](#page-9-2).

## **SUBSTRATE SOLUTIONS**

#### **Dextrose Solutions**

Standard nutrition support regimens use carbohydrates to supply approximately 70% of the daily (nonprotein) calorie requirements. The carbohydrate source for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is dextrose (glucose), which is available in the solutions shown in [Table](#page-0-0) 50.1 Because the energy yield from dextrose is relatively low (see Table 48.1), the dextrose solutions must be concentrated to provide enough calories to satisfy daily requirements. The standard solution is 50% dextrose (D<sup>50</sup> ), which provides 1,700 kcal per liter. Concentrated dextrose solutions have a very high osmolarity which mandates infusion through large, central veins.

#### **Amino Acid Solutions**

Protein is provided as amino acid solutions that contain mixtures of essential and nonessential amino acids. (*Note:* Humans can synthesize 11 of the 20 amino acids that are used to build proteins. The remaining 9 amino acids, which are called *essential amino acids*, must be provided in the diet. These amino acids include histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine.)

Standard amino acid solutions (e.g., Travasol®) are balanced mixtures of 50% essential amino acids and 50% nonessential amino acids. For full nutrition support, a 10% amino acid solution will provides 100 grams of protein per liter, or 16.5 grams of nitrogen per liter. Amino acid solutions can be mixed together with the dextrose solutions and lipid emulsions.

#### *Branched-Chain Amino Acids*

Amino acid solutions enriched with branched-chain amino acids (isoleucine, leucine, and valine), such as *Aminosyn II*® are designed for the following situations:

- 1. In progressive liver failure, aromatic amino acids (i.e., phenylalanine, tryptophan, tyrosine) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy. Branched-chain amino acids competitively block the transport of aromatic amino acids across the blood-brain barrier ([5\)](#page-9-3), and can thereby reduce the risk of hepatic encephalopathy [\(6](#page-9-4)).
- 2. Branched-chain amino acids are metabolized in skeletal muscle, and parenteral formulas enriched with branched-chain amino acids are more likely to achieve a positive nitrogen balance during periods of metabolic stress like trauma or sepsis ([7\)](#page-9-5).

However, despite these theoretical benefits, *nutrition formulas enriched with branched-chain amino acids have not improved outcomes in any of the conditions for which they are designed* ([6,](#page-9-4)[7\)](#page-9-5).

### **Lipid Emulsions**

Lipids are provided as emulsions composed of submicron droplets of cholesterol, phospholipids, and triglycerides. The triglycerides are derived primarily from soybean oil, and the features of a popular soybean oil emulsion are shown in [Table](#page-2-0) 50.2 [\(8](#page-9-6)[,9](#page-9-7)). As indicated, these emulsions are rich in essential fatty acids (linoleic and linolenic acid), which must be provided in the diet, and which can prevent essential fatty acid deficiency when they provide 3–4% of the daily caloric requirement ([10\)](#page-9-8).

Lipids have the highest energy content (9 kcal/g) of the nutritional fuels, and lipid emulsions are used to provide about 30% of the daily energy needs. The soybean emulsions are available in 10% and 20% strengths (the percentage refers to grams of triglyceride per 100 mL of solution): the 10% emulsions provide 1 kcal/mL, and the 20% emulsions provide 2 kcal/mL ([8\)](#page-9-6). Unlike the hypertonic dextrose solutions, lipid emulsions are roughly isotonic to plasma, and *can be infused through peripheral veins*. This allows lipids to be used as a major source of calories in proteinsparing nutritional regimens, which are delivered via peripheral veins (as described later in the

chapter). However, for full parenteral nutrition support, lipid emulsions are added to the glucose and protein solutions to create a 3-in-1 nutrient admixture.

#### *Newer Lipid Emulsions*

The polyunsaturated fatty acids in soybean oil are needed to prevent essential fatty acid deficiency, but they have also been implicated in the adverse effects of nutritional lipids, which include hypertriglyceridemia, inflammatory injury, and lipid overload syndrome (which are described later in the chapter). In an attempt to reduce the risk of these complications, lipid emulsions have been introduced that incorporate less damaging lipids. These newer products are listed below [\(9](#page-9-7)).

- 1. *Clinolipid*® is 80% olive oil and 20% soybean oil. Olive oil contains medium-chain triglycerides, which are more readily metabolized, and less likely to promote the lipid overload syndrome ([11\)](#page-9-9).
- 2. *Smoflipid*® is a mixture of 30% soybean oil, 30% medium-chain triglycerides, 20% olive oil, and 15% fish oil. The fish oil is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which are less likely to promote inflammatory injury.
- 3. *Omegaven*® is pure fish oil, which has the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids, but will not prevent essential fatty acid deficiency unless combined with lipids from soybean oil.

The experience with the above products is limited at the present time.

## **ADDITIVES**

Commercially available mixtures of electrolytes, vitamins, and trace elements are added directly to the 3-in-1 nutrient admixture.

### **Electrolytes**

There are numerous electrolyte mixtures that are commercially available. Most have a volume of 20 mL, and contain sodium, chloride, potassium, and magnesium. You must check the mixture used at your hospital to determine if additional electrolytes must be added. Most hospitals have special order forms where the desired electrolyte changes can be specified.

#### **Vitamins**

Aqueous multivitamin preparations will provide the normal daily requirements for most vitamins (see Table 48.3) ([16\)](#page-9-10). The daily vitamin requirements in ICU patients are likely to be higher than normal, which explains why vitamin deficiencies are commonplace in ICU patients (see the section on "Vitamin Requirements" in Chapter 48).

#### **Trace Elements**

A variety of trace element additives are available, and one of these is shown in [Table](#page-3-0) 50.3, along with the recommended daily requirement for the included trace elements. Note that the daily requirements for 5 of the 7 trace elements are not satisfied by the dosing in this product. The consequences of this mismatch are not known.

## **CREATING A TPN REGIMEN**

The following is a stepwise approach to creating a standard TPN regimen for an individual patient. The patient in this example will be a 70 kg adult who is not malnourished and has no volume restrictions.

#### **Step 1**

The initial task is to determine the daily requirement for calories and protein. This is described in

<sup>§</sup>Product description, America Regent, Inc.

Chapter 48, and is briefly reviewed here. The daily energy requirement, or resting energy expenditure (REE), can be measured by indirect calorimetry, or it can be estimated using a simple formula: REE = 25 × weight (in kg). The daily protein requirements can be estimated as 1.2–2.0 grams per kg body weight. You can use actual body weight in these estimates as long as actual body weight is not greater than 125% of the ideal weight (see Appendix 2 for ideal body weights). If actual body weight exceeds 125% of ideal body weight, you can use the adjusted body weight (which is derived in Equation 48.3).

For the 70 kg patient, we'll use a daily protein requirement of 1.4 g/kg. Therefore, the daily requirement for calories and protein will be:

Calories: 
$$25 \times 70 = 1,750 \text{ kcal/day}$$
  
Protein:  $1.4 \times 70 = 98 \text{ grams/day}$  (49.1)

*Note:* If propofol is being infused, you should determine the calories provided by propofol and subtract those calories from the daily caloric requirement. Propofol is infused in a 10% lipid emulsion, which has a caloric density equivalent to 10% Intralipid (1 kcal/mL). Therefore, the hourly infusion rate of propofol (mL/hr) is equivalent to the hourly yield of calories (kcal/hr).

### **Step 2**

The next step is to determine the volume of the amino acid solution needed to meet the daily protein requirement. A 10% amino acid solution has 100 grams of protein per liter, so one liter of the amino acid solution will satisfy the estimated daily protein requirement (i.e., 98 grams/day).

### **Step 3**

The next step is to determine how to deliver the daily caloric requirement, which should be provided as nonprotein calories in the dextrose solution and lipid emulsion. Start with the lipid emulsion. The standard lipid emulsion in many hospital pharmacies is a 20% emulsion, which provides 2 kcal/mL. Therefore, 250 mL of a 20% lipid emulsion will provide 500 kcal. That leaves 1,750 – 500 = 1,250 kcal that must be provided by dextrose. One liter of 50% dextrose provides 1,700 kcal, or 1.7 kcal/mL, so the volume of D<sup>50</sup> needed to provide 1,250 kcal is 1,250/1.7 = 735 mL.

Therefore, the parenteral nutrition formulation for this example would be an admixture of the following:

- 1. 1 liter of 10% amino acid solution
- 2. 250 mL of a 20% lipid emulsion
- 3. 735 mL of a 50% dextrose solution (D<sup>50</sup> )
- 4. 30 mL for vitamins, electrolytes, and trace elements

#### **Step 4**

The final step is determining the infusion rate of the nutrient admixture. The total volume of the admixture is 2,015 mL, which is infused over 24 hours, so the hourly infusion rate is 2,015/24 = 84 mL/hr. However, in patients who are at risk for the refeeding syndrome (see later), the American Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition recommends starting at 40–50% of the

nutritional goal, and advancing to full nutrition support as allowed by the serum levels of phosphate, potassium, and magnesium (usually 4–7 days) ([12\)](#page-9-11). For this example, starting at 50% of the nutritional goal corresponds to an infusion rate of 42 mL/hr.

## **COMPLICATIONS**

The following complications do not include those associated with central venous catheters, which are required for full parenteral nutrition. Catheter-related complications are described in Chapters 2 and 3.

### **Carbohydrate Complications**

#### *Hyperglycemia*

Hyperglycemia is common during total parenteral nutrition (TPN): e.g., in one report, blood glucose levels above 200 mg/dL were recorded in 45% of the patients receiving TPN [\(13](#page-9-12)). Tight glycemic control is not recommended in critically ill patients because of the risk of hypoglycemia, which has more serious consequences than hyperglycemia [\(14](#page-9-13)). The current recommendation for hospitalized patients is *a target range of 140–180 mg/dL for blood glucose* ([15\)](#page-9-14).

**INSULIN:** Insulin is often necessary for glycemic control during TPN, and [Table](#page-5-0) 50.4 shows the variety of biosynthetic insulins that are available [\(16](#page-9-10)). A continuous infusion of regular insulin is preferred for critically ill patients (17), and this can often be accomplished by adding regular insulin to the feeding admixture, and using subcutaneous insulin (lispro) as needed for glycemic control. When patients are clinically stable, half of the daily insulin requirement can be converted to long-acting glargine insulin, which is given once daily.

<span id="page-5-0"></span>**TABLE 50.4 Insulin Preparations**

| Туре         | Name      | Onset*    | Peak       | Duration |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|------------|----------|
| Rapid-Acting | Aspart    | 10-20 min | 1–3 hr     | 3–5 hr   |
| Rapid-Acting | Glulisine | 25 min    | 45-50 min  | 4–5 hr   |
| Rapid-Acting | Lispro    | 15-30 min | 0.5–2.5 hr | 3–6 hr   |
| Short-Acting | Regular   | 30-60 min | 1–5 hr     | 6–10 hr  |
| Intermediate | NPH       | 1–2 hr    | 6–14 hr    | 16–24 hr |
| Long-Acting  | Glargine  | 1 hr      | 2–20 hr    | 24 hr    |

#### *Hypophosphatemia*

The movement of glucose into cells is associated with a similar movement of phosphate into cells, which provides phosphate for cofactors (e.g., thiamine pyrophosphate) that participate in glucose metabolism. This intracellular shift of phosphate can result in progressive hypophosphatemia, as shown in Figure 38.2 (18). *Glucose-induced hypophosphatemia is a major component of the refeeding syndrome* (see later), and this mandates attention to monitoring serum phosphate levels when TPN is initiated.

#### *Hypokalemia*

Glucose movement into cells is also accompanied by an intracellular shift of K+ (which is the basis for the use of glucose and insulin to treat severe hyperkalemia). This effect is usually transient, but continued glucose loading during TPN can lead to persistent hypokalemia. Glucose-induced hypokalemia is another component of the refeeding syndrome (see later).

### *Hypercapnia*

Overfeeding promotes CO<sup>2</sup> retention in patients with respiratory insufficiency (19). This has been attributed to glucose metabolism, which produces more CO<sup>2</sup> than protein or lipid metabolism (i.e., glucose has a higher RQ than proteins or lipids, as shown in Table 48.1). However, CO<sup>2</sup> retention appears to be a consequence of overfeeding, and not just overfeeding with carbohydrates (19).

### **Lipid Complications**

Lipid emulsions have the potential for several deleterious effects, including hypertriglyceridemia, inflammatory injury, hepatic steatosis, and the lipid overload syndrome.

## *Inflammatory Injury*

The soybean oil used in standard lipid emulsions is rich in omega-6 and omega-9 polyunsaturated fatty acids that serve as precursors to the formation of eicosanoids (prostaglandins and leukotrienes), which have a pivotal role in the inflammatory response ([4,](#page-9-2)[9\)](#page-9-7). The inflammatory potential of soybean–based lipid emulsions is demonstrated by one of the animal models for the acute respiratory distress syndrome (an inflammatory lung injury) which involves the infusion of oleic acid (an omega-9 fatty acid in soybean oil) into the pulmonary arteries (20). This would explain why lipid infusions in TPN formulations are associated with impaired oxygenation, and can prolong the respiratory failure (21,22). The omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil have anti-inflammatory activity, and some of the newer lipid formulations mentioned earlier (e.g., Smoflipid®) have incorporated fish oils to take advantage of this activity.

#### *Hepatic Steatosis*

Fat accumulation in the liver (hepatic steatosis) can occur, but is more common in patients receiving long-term TPN. Contributing factors include the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids in the lipid emulsion, and the content of phytosterols (plant sterols) in lipid emulsions (23). The hepatic steatosis can progress to a chronic hepatitis and even cirrhosis if the TPN is very prolonged (24).

#### *Cholestasis*

TPN is also associated with cholestasis, which can lead to acalculous cholecystitis (24). This is attributed to the absence of lipids in the proximal small bowel, which prevents cholecystokininmediated contraction of the gallbladder.

#### *Lipid Overload Syndrome*

The lipid overload syndrome is an uncommon condition that occurs when the lipid-induced increase in serum triglycerides overwhelms the ability to break down the triglycerides, resulting in a clinical syndrome that can include fever, headache, irritability, respiratory distress, jaundice, pancreatitis, pancytopenia, and coagulopathy (25,26). This is reported more frequently in children, and it can resolve when the lipid infusions are temporarily discontinued (26).

## **Refeeding Syndrome**

The refeeding syndrome was first described in World War II, when aggressive feeding of malnourished prisoners of war and concentration camp victims resulted in considerable morbidity and even mortality.

#### *What is it?*

The refeeding syndrome is characterized by the following abnormalities (see [Table](#page-8-0) 50.5): hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, thiamine deficiency, and renal sodium retention [\(12](#page-9-11)). Many of the electrolyte abnormalities, along with the thiamine deficiency, are attributed to the introduction of a glucose load in patients with borderline or depleted stores of potassium, phosphate, magnesium, and thiamine. The sodium retention could be the result of hypoalbuminemia from malnutrition.

The clinical manifestations are a consequence of the electrolyte and vitamin deficiencies, and include generalized weakness (from hypophosphatemia), mental status changes and lactic

acidosis (from thiamine deficiency), tachyarrhythmias (from hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia), and pulmonary edema (from sodium retention) ([12\)](#page-9-11).

From Reference 12.

#### *Predisposing Conditions*

The following conditions have been identified as high-risk for the refeeding syndrome ([12\)](#page-9-11): weight loss of 5% in one month, or >10% in 6 months, body mass index (BMI) ≤18.5 kg/m2, poor nutrient intake for the past 5 days, low baseline levels of serum potassium, phosphate, or magnesium, or any patient with a high risk of malnutrition (e.g., from drug abuse).

#### *Recommendations*

The following recommendations are for patients who are high-risk for the refeeding syndrome ([12\)](#page-9-11):

- 1. Before nutrition support is started, electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected, and thiamine should be started. The American Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition recommends 100– 200 mg thiamine daily ([12\)](#page-9-11), but this is inadequate for correcting thiamine deficiency (27), and the replacement protocol in Table 48.4 is more appropriate.
- 2. Nutrition support should be started at 40–50% of the estimated nutritional needs (or 10–15 kcal/kg per day), or glucose infusions can be started at 150 grams daily (which is 300 mL of D<sup>50</sup> ). The nutrition regimen is then slowly advanced over the next 4–7 days, while closely monitoring the serum levels of phosphate, potassium, and magnesium.

## **PERIPHERAL PARENTERAL NUTRITION**

Peripheral parenteral nutrition (PPN) is a truncated form of TPN that can be used to provide nonprotein calories in amounts that will spare the breakdown of proteins to provide energy (i.e., *protein-sparing* nutrition support). PPN can be used as a supplement to enteral feeding, or as a source of calories during brief periods of inadequate nutrition. It is not intended for hypercatabolic or malnourished patients, who need full nutritional support,

The osmolarity of peripheral vein infusates should be kept below 900 mosm/L, with a pH between 7.2 and 7.4, to minimize the risk of vascular damage (28,29). This requires dilute amino acid and dextrose solutions, which limits nutrient intake. However, lipid emulsions are isotonic

to plasma, and lipids can be used to provide a considerable portion of the nonprotein calories in PPN.

#### **Method**

A popular regimen for PPN is a mixture of 3% amino acids and 20% dextrose (final concentration of 1.5% amino acids and 10% dextrose), which has an osmolarity of 500 mosm/L. The dextrose will provide 340 kcal/L, so 2.5 L of the mixture will provide 850 kcal. If 250 mL of 20% Intralipid is added to the regimen (adding 500 kcal), the total nonprotein calories will increase to 1,350 kcal/day. This should be close to the nonprotein calorie requirement of an average size, unstressed adult (20 kcal/kg/day).

## **A FINAL WORD**

The final word on parenteral nutrition is . . . *AVOID* . . . whenever possible. For an explanation, see the first section of Chapter 49.
