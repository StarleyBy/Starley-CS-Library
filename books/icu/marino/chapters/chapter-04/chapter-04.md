# **Alimentary Prophylaxis**

*We are told the most fantastic biological tales. For example, that it is dangerous to have acid in your stomach.*

JBS Haldane (1939)

Antiseptic practices are focused almost exclusively on the skin, but there is another, even larger surface that can be breached by microbes: i.e., the mucosal lining of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The lumen of the GI tract is outside the body (like the hole in a donut), and the mucosal surface serves as a barrier to microbial invasion, just like the skin. However, the skin is a multilayer affair with a keratinized covering, while the GI mucosa (our "inner skin") is a single layer of columnar epithelial cells that is only 0.1 mm thick, and serves as a barrier for an estimated 100 to 400 *trillion* microbes that inhabit the bowel [\(1](#page-15-0)). This scenario of a paper-thin barrier for an enormous army of microbes highlights the threat of microbial invasion from the bowel.

This chapter will introduce you to the importance of the alimentary tract (which extends from the oral cavity to the rectum) as a source of infection in critically ill patients, and describes the antiseptic measures that are available for this site. Also included is a section on stress-related mucosal injury in the stomach, and what can be done to prevent troublesome bleeding from this condition.

# **MICROBIAL INVASION FROM THE BOWEL**

#### **The Intestinal Microbiome**

Bacteria are aquatic in nature, and the moisture-rich environment in the alimentary tract is ideal for microbial proliferation. The GI tract is home to about 70,000 distinct bacterial genomes ([2\)](#page-15-1), with an estimated population of 100 – 400 × 1012 organisms ([1\)](#page-15-0), and a total mass of about 2 kg (4.4 pounds) [\(3](#page-15-2)). The distribution of this mass is not uniform, as depicted in [Figure](#page-1-0) 4.1 ([4\)](#page-15-3). Note that the stomach is the least populated region of the alimentary tract, with fewer than 1,000 organisms per mL of gastric secretions. Overall, about 99% of the microorganisms in the GI tract are located in the large bowel.

The microbial population in the bowel is present almost from birth (presumably introduced in the mother's milk), and it functions as a collective "ecosystem" that is known as a *microbiome*. The intestinal microbiome is protected from invaders by the actions of gastric acid, which eradicates pathogens ingested in contaminated food products (e.g., *Salmonella* spp), or transmitted via the fecal-oral route (e.g., *Clostridium difficile*). (The antimicrobial actions of gastric acid are described later.)

**FIGURE 4.1** The population density of microorganisms in different regions of the alimentary tract. Numbers indicate colony forming units per mL of luminal contents. (From Reference 4).

#### *Protective Effects*

The intestinal microbiome has a symbiotic relationship with the host organism, and is instrumental in protecting against microbial invasion from the bowel. This is achieved by the following mechanisms ([2,](#page-15-1)[5\)](#page-15-4):

- 1. Resident microbes prevent colonization with pathogenic organisms by attaching to the intestinal mucosa and occupying all available spaces.
- 2. Microbial production of short-chain fatty acids provides essential fuels for the mucosal cells in the bowel, which helps to maintain the mucosal barrier.
- 3. Microbial products contribute to the proper functioning of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue

(GALT) which traps and destroys microbes that breach the mucosal barrier ([6\)](#page-15-5).

Disruption of the microbiome, a condition known as *dysbiosis*, impairs each of these mechanisms and promotes pathogenic invasion from the bowel. This is illustrated in [Figure](#page-3-0) 4.2. The movement of pathogens across the bowel wall is known as *translocation* [\(7](#page-15-6)), and it is a principal source of sepsis and multiorgan failure in critically ill patients.

### **Multiorgan Failure**

The leading cause of death in critically ill patients is multiorgan failure ([8\)](#page-15-7), a condition characterized by systemic inflammation (fever, leukocytosis, etc.) that persists or progresses, and is accompanied by progressive dysfunction in two or more major organs [\(9](#page-15-8)). The bowel is believed to be the source of this life-threatening condition ([10\)](#page-15-9), as described next.

### *The Motor of Multiorgan Failure*

The inciting event in multiorgan failure can be a derangement of the intestinal microbiome (dysbiosis), or a period of splanchnic hypoperfusion. Both conditions lead to disruption of the gut mucosal barrier, which then permits enteric pathogens and/or proinflammatory mediators to gain access to the systemic circulation. This initiates a systemic inflammatory response (e.g., fever, leukocytosis), which is accompanied by hemodynamic changes (i.e., sympathetic nervous system activation with splanchnic vasoconstriction) that promotes further disruption of the gut mucosal barrier, and so on. The result is a self-sustaining process that continually drives systemic inflammation, and eventually produces inflammatory injury in multiple organs. According to this scenario (and to borrow a popular phrase), *the bowel is the 'motor' of multiorgan failure* ([10\)](#page-15-9).

## **Gastric Acid as an Antiseptic Agent**

Gastric acid is often misperceived as a digestive aid. Although an acid environment in the stomach does facilitate the absorption of iron and calcium, patients with achlorhydria (the absence of gastric acidity) are not troubled by nutrient malabsorption. As mentioned earlier, *the principal function of gastric acid is not to facilitate digestion, but to serve as an antimicrobial defense against ingested pathogens* ([11\)](#page-15-10). The antimicrobial value of acids has been known since the introduction of antiseptic medicine (see next).

**FIGURE 4.2** Consequences of disrupting the intestinal microbiome, which promotes the invasion of pathogens from the bowel.

#### *Historical Note*

The benefits of antisepsis were first recognized in the mid-nineteenth century by a British surgeon named Joseph Lister, who discovered that a chemical agent used to treat sewage could also reduce the number of suppurative wound infections. Lister's observations were published in 1867 in a treatise entitled *On the Antiseptic Principle in the Practice of Surgery* [\(12](#page-15-11)). In the following excerpt from this treatise, Lister identifies the chemical agent that he used.

"The material which I have employed is carbolic acid, a volatile compound which appears to exercise a peculiarly destructive influence upon low forms of life, and hence is the most powerful antiseptic with which we are at present acquainted."

As indicated, the first antiseptic agent was an acid (carbolic acid, also known as phenol), so Joseph Lister not only discovered antisepsis, he also discovered the antimicrobial value of acidity. Unfortunately, Joseph Lister's contributions are largely forgotten, and the name Lister is recognized mainly in relation to a popular mouthwash, Listerine®!

#### *Antimicrobial Effects*

The influence of gastric pH on the growth of a pathogenic organism is shown in [Figure](#page-4-0) 4.3 [\(13](#page-15-12)). The pathogen in this case is *Salmonella typhimurium*, a common cause of infectious enteritis in humans. The graph in [Figure](#page-4-0) 4.3 shows the growth pattern of *S. typhimurium* in gastric

secretions at three different pH levels. Note that the organism thrives at a pH of 4, but there is a steady decline in survival at a pH of 3, and the organism is completely eradicated after one hour at a pH of 2. The pH of gastric secretions is 1–2, so gastric acidity should be very effective in eradicating ingested pathogens.

The role of gastric acidity as an antimicrobial defense mechanism is demonstrated by the consequences of gastric acid suppression (by histamine H<sup>2</sup> receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors), which includes an increased risk of infectious gastroenteritis from *Salmonella* and *Campylobacter* species (11,14–16), and an increased incidence of *Clostridium difficile* infections ([17\)](#page-15-13). (This topic will resurface later in the chapter.)

# **ALIMENTARY DECONTAMINATION**

Patients who are seriously ill are prone to colonization of the oropharynx and GI tract with pathogenic organisms, and the following decontamination methods are used to limit this process.

#### **Oral Decontamination**

The aspiration of mouth secretions into the upper airways is believed to be the inciting event in most cases of hospital-acquired pneumonia [\(18](#page-15-14)). The volume of saliva produced daily averages about 750 mL in adults, and each mL of saliva contains about one million microorganisms (see [Figure](#page-1-0) 4.1). Therefore, aspiration of 0.13% (1/750) of the daily saliva volume will introduce a million microbes into the airways. This not a concern in healthy subjects, because the

oropharynx is colonized with organisms that show little proclivity for harm. Not so in critically ill patients, as described next.

#### *Colonization of the Oropharynx*

The oropharynx of seriously ill patients becomes colonized with pathogenic organisms, most notably aerobic gram negative bacilli like *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* [\(18](#page-15-14)[,19](#page-15-15)). This colonization is not environmentally driven, but is directly related to the presence and severity of illness. This is demonstrated in [Figure](#page-5-0) 4.4 [\(19](#page-15-15)), which shows that healthy subjects are not colonized with aerobic gram-negative bacilli, regardless of the environment.

Pathogenic colonization of the oropharynx is caused by a change in bacterial adherence to the surface epithelium. Epithelial cells have specialized adhesion proteins that bind specific groups or species of bacteria, and in the presence of a serious illness, there is a conformational change in these proteins that results in the ability to bind pathogens. This same process occurs in the bowel mucosa and the bladder epithelium, and it demonstrates that *the determining factor in the colonization of epithelial surfaces is not the presence of an organism, but the ability of the organism to bind to the epithelium*. This topic deserves much more attention, as the prevention of pathogen binding to epithelial surfaces would be an effective method of infection control.

†Regimen from Reference 27.

Colonization of the oropharynx with gram-negative bacilli is a prelude to pneumonia, since the same organisms (gram-negative bacilli) are the most frequent cause of nosocomial pneumonias (see Chapter 29). This is the rationale for oral decontamination, which is currently reserved for patients who are intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. There are two methods of oral decontamination: one uses an antiseptic oral rinse, and the other involves the local application of nonabsorbable antibiotics. Both methods are summarized in [Table](#page-5-1) 4.1.

#### *Chlorhexidine*

The popular skin antiseptic chlorhexidine has been adopted for use in decontaminating the oropharynx. A 0.12% solution of chlorhexidine gluconate is used as an oral rinse every 6 hours, and this regimen continues for as long as the patient is ventilator-dependent. There is a more concentrated (2%) chlorhexidine gluconate solution, but this is less desirable because it can cause a mucositis ([20\)](#page-15-16).

The benefit of oral decontamination with chlorhexidine has been difficult to establish. Some studies have shown a 30% relative reduction in the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia, without an associated decrease in mortality [\(21](#page-15-17)). However, other studies have shown marginal or no benefit ([22\)](#page-15-18), and the pooled results of 11 clinical trials has shown an increase in mortality associated with chlorhexidine [\(23](#page-15-19)). Because of concerns about the potential for harm, the international guidelines on ventilator-associated pneumonia withdrew a recommendation for oral decontamination with chlorhexidine ([24\)](#page-15-20), and experts in the United States have followed suit (25). Unfortunately, there is no other antiseptic agent that has been adequately studied for oral decontamination.

An additional problem with chlorhexidine that is rarely mentioned is its limited spectrum of activity; i.e. *chlorhexidine is effective primarily against gram-positive organisms (26), while gram-negative organisms are the predominant microbes in the oropharynx of critically ill patients*. This would explain the disappointing results of the clinical trials just mentioned.

#### *Selective Oral Decontamination*

The principle behind selective oral decontamination (SOD) is to eradicate colonization with pathogens while preserving the normal microbial population of the oropharynx. This is achieved with a combination of nonabsorbable antibiotics that are locally applied to the oral mucosa. One SOD regimen that has had success in reducing the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia is shown in [Table](#page-5-1) 4.1 (27). In this case, a mixture of 2% gentamicin, 2% colistin, and 2% vancomycin is applied as a paste to the oral mucosa four times daily. This regimen is designed to eradicate staphylococci, gram-negative aerobic bacilli, and *Candida* species, but has little activity against anaerobic organisms (normal mouth flora).

**EFFICACY:** Several clinical studies have shown that SOD reduces the incidence of ventilatorassociated pneumonia ([23,](#page-15-19)28,29), and also reduces the frequency of bacteremias involving gramnegative bacilli (29,30). This latter observation is demonstrated in [Figure](#page-7-0) 4.5 (29). Both graphs in this figure show a 33% (relative) decrease in the incidence of gram-negative bacteremias associated with SOD.

Despite convincing evidence that SOD is effective in reducing the frequency of ICUacquired infections, SOD is largely ignored. On the other hand, despite evidence of limited efficacy and possible harm, chlorhexidine has been the standard method of oral decontamination. This scenario is the antithesis of evidence-based medicine! The rationale for ignoring SOD is the fear of antibiotic resistance; an unfounded fear that is addressed at the end of the next section.

## **Selective Digestive Decontamination**

Selective digestive decontamination (SDD) is based on the same principle as SOD (i.e., prevent colonization with pathogens while preserving the normal microflora), but is applied to the entire alimentary tract. An SDD regimen that has proven successful is shown below (30).

<span id="page-7-0"></span>![](_page_7_Figure_3.jpeg)

**FIGURE 4.5** The prevalence of gram-negative bacteremia in patients randomized to receive selective oral decontamination (SOD), selective digestive decontamination (SDD), or standard care (control). The graph on the left shows the number of bacteremias per 1000 days, and the graph on the right shows the percentage of patients with bacteremia. *N* is the number of patients in each study group. (From Reference 29).

*Mouth:* A gel containing 2% polymyxin, 2% tobramycin, and 2% amphotericin

is applied to the oral mucosa every 6 hours.

*GI tract:* A 10 mL aliquot of a solution containing 100 mg polymyxin E, 80 mg

tobramycin, and 500 mg amphotericin is delivered through a

nasogastric tube every 6 hours.

*Systemic:* Intravenous cefuroxime, 1.5 grams every 8 hours, is used for the first

four days.

This nonabsorbable antibiotic combination is designed to eradicate staphylococci, gramnegative aerobic bacilli, and *Candida* species, while sparing the normal microflora of the oropharynx and GI tract (mainly anaerobes) The intravenous antibiotic is used for systemic protection until decontamination of the bowel is completed, which takes about 5–7 days. The SDD regimen is intended for all patients who will stay in the ICU longer than 72 hours, and is continued until discharge from the ICU.

#### *Efficacy*

Numerous clinical studies have shown that SDD reduces the incidence of ICU-acquired infections (including pneumonias, urinary tract infections, and bacteremias), and also significantly reduces the mortality rate (29–34). The impact of SDD on gram-negative bacteremia is demonstrated in [Figure](#page-7-0) 4.5 (29). Note that SDD was associated with a marked (67%) reduction in the frequency of these infections. This effect is lost for bacteremias involving multidrug-resistance gram-negative bacilli (35), indicating that SDD is not appropriate in ICUs with problematic antibiotic resistance.

**SOMETHING OF INTEREST:** One observation that deserves mention comes from a clinical study where SDD *eliminated* vascular catheter-related bacteremias (32). This suggests that the bowel is the source of catheter-related bacteremias (not the skin); a concept that is presented at the very end of Chapter 3 (see A FINAL WORD).

#### *Why is SDD Ignored?*

Despite numerous studies over the past 30 years showing that SDD is an effective method of reducing ICU-acquired infections, SDD is ignored (like SOD). Much of this is the result of the age-old fear that SDD will promote the emergence of antibiotic resistant organisms. However, none of the SDD studies has shown an increase in infections from antibiotic-resistant organisms, including a prospective study evaluating SDD over a 5-year period (36), and a 16-year experience with SDD (37). Thus, the disregard for SDD is not validated by clinical studies.

#### **Probiotics**

Probiotics are microbial preparations of normal but harmless inhabitants of the intestinal tract that are capable of preventing colonization with pathogenic organisms. (*Note:* Probiotics should be distinguished from *prebiotics*, which are food substances—mostly dietary fibers—that promote the growth of normal bowel microflora. Probiotics and prebiotics are often combined to create what is known as *synbiotic therapy*.) The most common probiotics are strains of lactic acid bacteria, such as *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacterium* species, that are resistant to the bactericidal actions of gastric acid and bile salts, and can successfully colonize the bowel when ingested (38). Another popular probiotic is the *Saccharomyces* fungus, which is the principal ingredient in brewer's yeast and baker's yeast.

#### *Clinical Use*

The principal use of probiotics in the ICU is the prevention of *Clostridium difficile* infections during antibiotic therapy (39). This effect is time-limited; the combined results of 19 clinical studies showed that probiotics reduced the risk of *C. difficile* infections only when started within 2 days of antibiotic therapy (40). Probiotic therapy can also reduce the risk of hepatic encephalopathy (41) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (42).

# **STRESS-RELATED MUCOSAL INJURY**

Stress-related mucosal injury is a term used for superficial erosions on the luminal surface of the stomach that are found in critically ill patients. These erosions can be confined to the mucosa, or they can bore deeper into the submucosa. The deeper erosions are called *stress ulcers*, and are more likely to cause troublesome bleeding. Hereafter, both types of surface erosions will be referred to as stress ulcers.

### **Pathogenesis**

The surface epithelial cells in the stomach are covered with a layer of bicarbonate-rich mucus (pH = 7) that protects the cells from the acidity of gastric secretions, and from proteolytic enzymes (e.g., pepsin) in the secretions. Gastric mucosal blood flow plays an important role in preserving the mucous layer by providing nutrients to support the functional integrity of the surface epithelial cells. The importance of mucosal blood flow is demonstrated by the fact that 70–90% of the blood supply to the stomach is delivered to the gastric mucosa (43). The endothelial cells in surface vessels secrete prostacyclin and nitric oxide, which are both instrumental in maintaining nutrient flow to the gastric mucosa (44).

Local ischemia is the inciting event in stress-related mucosal injury, while the presence of luminal acid is believed to aggravate the condition (44). In animal models of hemorrhagic shock, reperfusion injury also plays a role (45). Of interest, occult gastric hypoperfusion can be a frequent occurrence in critically ill patients who are not hypotensive, especially in those receiving mechanical ventilation (44).

## **Stress Ulcer Bleeding**

Erosions are visible on the surface of the stomach in 75% to 100% of patients within 24 hours of admission to the ICU (46). These lesions often ooze blood from eroding into superficial capillaries, but "clinically significant" bleeding is infrequent. The accepted definition of clinically significant bleeding is overt bleeding that is accompanied by at least one of the following: (a) a decrease in blood pressure (systolic, mean, or diastolic pressure) of ≥20 mm Hg, (b) initiation of vasopressor therapy, or a 20% increase in the vasopressor dose, (c) a decrease in hemoglobin of at least 2 g/dL, or (d) transfusion of 2 or more units of packed red blood cells (47,48). The likelihood of significant stress ulcer bleeding is determined by the presence or absence of specific risk factors, as described next.

### *Risk of Bleeding*

The risk of significant bleeding from stress ulcers can be stratified as shown in [Table](#page-10-0) 4.2, which is taken from the most recent clinical practice guidelines on the prevention of stress ulcer bleeding (47). The following points in this table deserve emphasis:

- 1. The risk of bleeding during mechanical ventilation is decreased considerably by enteral tube feedings.
- 2. Corticosteroid therapy is not a significant risk factor for stress ulcer bleeding, and does not require prophylactic therapy. Ditto for therapeutic anticoagulation.

**THE STEROID MYTHOS:** The popular perception that corticosteroid therapy creates a significant risk of stress ulcer bleeding (and warrants prophylactic therapy) has a surprising lack of experimental support. The most recent evaluation of this issue is a report of the pooled results from 25 studies (49), which showed that corticosteroid therapy had no influence on GI bleeding of any severity. Results like this indicate that corticosteroid therapy should not be considered a risk factor for stress ulcer bleeding.

## **Prophylaxis for Stress Ulcer Bleeding**

Surveys indicate that a majority (>80%) of ICU patients receive prophylactic therapy for stress ulcer bleeding, and about 70% of these patients do not need prophylaxis (50). This excessive use of stress ulcer prophylaxis is not only costly, it can also be harmful (see later).

<span id="page-10-1"></span>The principal method of prophylaxis for stress ulcer bleeding is the suppression of gastric acid production with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or histamine type-2 receptor antagonists (H<sup>2</sup> blockers). (The goal is to maintain a pH ≥4 in gastric aspirates, although this is rarely monitored.) The other, less popular, method employs a cytoprotective agent (sucralfate) that forms a protective covering over damaged areas of the gastric mucosa, and does not alter gastric acidity. The individual drugs and recommended doses are shown in [Table](#page-10-1) 4.3.

| Lansoprazole | PPI           | PO, NG     | 30 mg once daily        |
| Sucralfate   | Protectant    | PO, NG     | 1 g every 6 hrs         |

†A dose reduction of 50% is recommended for a creatinine clearance <50 mL/min. PPI = proton pump inhibitor.

#### *Efficacy*

All three types of drugs (PPIs, H<sup>2</sup> blockers, and sucralfate) are capable of reducing the risk of stress ulcer bleeding (51). The relative efficacy is: PPIs >H<sup>2</sup> blockers > sucralfate (51–53). However, none of these agents provides a survival benefit (51–53).

## *H<sup>2</sup> Blockers*

Histamine H<sup>2</sup> receptor antagonists, or H<sup>2</sup> blockers, (cimetidine, famotidine) inhibit gastric acid secretion by binding to histamine H<sup>2</sup> receptors on gastric parietal cells. Famotidine is currently the favored H<sup>2</sup> blocker for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and is well suited for ICU patients because it can be given intravenously. The H<sup>2</sup> blockers are cleared by the kidneys, and reduced drug clearance from renal insufficiency can have neurotoxic effects (e.g., altered mentation). For this reason, a 50% reduction in the daily dose is advised for patients with a creatinine clearance <50 mL/min (54).

## *Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs)*

The PPIs (omeprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole, lansoprazole), are potent acid-suppressing drugs that block the secretion of hydrogen ions by gastric parietal cells. These drugs are actually prodrugs, and are converted to the active form within gastric parietal cells. Once activated, the drugs bind irreversibly to the membrane pump responsible for hydrogen ion secretion, and this results in complete inhibition of gastric acid secretion.

All PPIs are considered equivalent as prophylactic agents (although this has not been studied), but pantoprazole is the most popular PPI in ICU patients because it can be given intravenously (48). (*Note:* Esomeprazole can also be given intravenously, but this drug is rarely used for stress ulcer prophylaxis.) Unlike H<sup>2</sup> blockers, PPIs require no dose adjustment for renal insufficiency.

The graph on the left in [Figure](#page-12-0) 4.6 shows the effect of pantoprazole (40 mg IV once daily) on (significant) stress ulcer bleeding in more than 3,000 high-risk ICU patients (48). Note the low incidence of GI bleeding in the control patients (4.2%), and the small (1.7%) treatment effect. Small benefits like this must be measured against the risks associated with gastric acid suppression (see later).

**FIGURE 4.6** Effects of stress ulcer prophylaxis with pantoprazole (40 mg IV daily) on the incidence of significant GI bleeding (graph on the left) and the summed incidence of GI bleeding and the risks associated with pantoprazole: pneumonia (PNA), *C. difficile* infection (CDI), and myocardial ischemia (MI)) which is shown in the graph on the right. Data from a study of 3,298 high-risk ICU patients from 6 different countries (48). See text for further explanation.

**PPIs AND CLOPIDOGREL:** PPIs interact with clopidogrel, an antiplatelet agent that has been used for secondary prevention of acute coronary syndromes and stroke. Clopidogrel is a prodrug that is converted to its active form by the same (cytochrome P-450) pathway in the liver that metabolizes PPIs. As a result, PPIs can impede clopidogrel activation in the liver (by competitive inhibition) and reduce its antiplatelet effect (55). This interaction has been implicated as a risk factor for the recurrence of acute coronary syndromes following percutaneous coronary intervention (56), but evidence of a causal link has been inconsistent. At the present time, there is no recommendation to avoid PPIs in patients receiving clopidogrel.

## *Risks of Gastric Acid Suppression*

The risk of gastric acid suppression is related to loss of the antimicrobial activity of gastric acidity. The major risks are summarized below.

*Clostridium Difficile* **INFECTION:** The association between gastric acid suppression and *Clostridium difficile* infections has been reported in outpatients (57), inpatients (58), and ICU patients (59,60), and the association is stronger with PPIs than with H<sup>2</sup> blockers (57,61). Patients who receive PPIs for stress ulcer prophylaxis are three times more likely to develop *C. difficile* enterocolitis (60). In recognition of this risk, The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a Drug Safety Alert in 2013 that highlighted the risk of *C. difficile* infections associated with PPIs (62).

**PNEUMONIA:** There is also an association between gastric acid suppression and an increased risk of pneumonia, including community-acquired pneumonia (63) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (61). Once again, the risk is greater with PPIs than with H<sup>2</sup> blockers (61). The presumed mechanism is colonization of gastric secretions with pathogenic organisms, and subsequent aspiration of infectious gastric secretions into the upper airways.

#### *Benefits vs. Risks*

There is evidence that the benefit of PPIs in reducing stress ulcer bleeding is negated or counterbalanced by the adverse consequences of PPIs. This is demonstrated in [Figure](#page-12-0) 4.6 (48). As mentioned earlier, the graph on the left shows a decrease in the incidence of stress ulcer bleeding associated with a PPI (pantoprazole). The graph on the right shows the composite incidence of stress ulcer bleeding plus the risks associated with PPIs (i.e., *C. difficile* infection, pneumonia, and myocardial ischemia related to the clopidogrel interaction). Note that the total incidence of adverse events is no different in the placebo group and the pantoprazole group. This means that the benefit of pantoprazole prophylaxis is erased if you also consider the adverse consequences of PPI therapy; i.e., there is no net benefit from stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPIs.

#### *Sucralfate*

Sucralfate is an aluminum salt of sucrose sulfate that adheres to damaged areas of the gastric mucosa, and forms a viscous covering that shields the denuded surface from luminal acids and pepsin proteolysis. Gastric acidity is maintained, which is the most desirable feature of prophylaxis with sucralfate. At a dose of one gram every 6 hours (usually given as an oral suspension), sucralfate has been shown to reduce the incidence of stress ulcer bleeding (51). Of particular importance, pneumonia is less frequent when sucralfate is used instead of gastric acidsuppressing drugs (64).

Sucralfate has one undesirable feature that precludes its use in a majority of ICU patients: i.e., it can not be used in conjunction with enteral tube feedings. Sucralfate must be given when the stomach is empty (to allow binding to the gastric mucosa), which is not possible during enteral feedings without lengthy interruptions to allow gastric emptying. Even with interruptions, any mixing of sucralfate with tube feedings is problematic because it can promote bezoar formation (65).

Another undesirable feature of sucralfate is the ability to bind certain drugs in the stomach (by virtue of its aluminum moieties), including ciprofloxacin, digoxin, ketoconazole, norfloxacin, phenytoin, thyroxine, tetracycline, theophylline, and warfarin (66). The aluminum in sucralfate can also bind phosphate in the bowel, but this rarely results in hypophosphatemia (67).

# **The Case Against Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis**

The relevant observations about stress ulcer prophylaxis are listed in [Table](#page-14-0) 4.4. These observations indicate that stress ulcer prophylaxis with gastric acid-suppressing drugs provides little or no benefit, and can introduce harm.

The emerging realization that stress ulcer prophylaxis is "more trouble than it's worth" has prompted efforts to "deprescribe" proton pump inhibitors in high-risk ICU patients. At this time, six clinical trials have shown that withholding pantoprazole in high-risk ICU patients does not increase the occurrence of significant stress ulcer bleeding (68). This differs from earlier studies

showing a decrease in stress ulcer bleeding with PPI prophylaxis, and this difference can be attributed to improvements in enteral nutrition (see next).

#### *Enteral Feeding*

Enteral tube feedings can protect against stress ulcer bleeding in two ways. First, enteral feeding has a trophic effect on the gastric mucosa that limits or prevents mucosal breakdown (see Chapter 49). Second, the presence of feeding solutions in the stomach will raise the pH of gastric contents. The prophylactic value of enteral feedings is revealed in the combined results of three clinical studies, which showed that the ability of gastric acid-suppressing drugs to reduce stress ulcer bleeding was lost when patients received a full regimen of enteral tube feedings (69). These results indicate that *enteral feeding is all that is needed for stress ulcer prophylaxis*.

# <span id="page-14-0"></span>**TABLE 4.4 The Case Against Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis**

A composite of the following observations indicates that the routine use of stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) is not warranted.

- Significant bleeding from stress ulcers is infrequent.
- SUP has only a small treatment effect.
- There is no survival benefit with SUP.
- The benefit of SUP is lost when the risks of gastric acid suppression are considered.

# **A FINAL WORD**

# **Gastric Acidophobia**

One of the recurring themes in this book is the importance of the bowel as a source of ICUacquired infections, and the risk of these infections is enhanced by the popular (and overly excessive) use of gastric acid suppression for stress ulcer prophylaxis. This practice is rooted in the time-honored fear that acids are corrosive. While acids can corrode certain metals like iron, this does not apply to organic (carbon-based) matter. Consider the following beverages with pH values that are close to gastric acid (70):

| Source          | pH   |
|-----------------|------|
| Gastric<br>Acid | 2.0  |
| Lemon<br>Juice  | 2.0  |
| Pepsi           | 2.13 |
| Vinegar         | 2.2  |
| Coca-Cola       | 2.24 |
| Fanta           | 2.51 |

Despite levels of acidity that are comparable to gastric acid, these beverages are not harmful.

(Imagine what would happen if Pepsi or Coca-Cola caused mouth burns!) In fact, vinegar is used to *preserve* organic matter (foods); a process known as *pickling*. When an industrial acid causes skin burns, the culprit is the chemical composition of the acid, not the acidity.

We are designed to have acid in our stomach, to protect the intestinal microbiome from foreign invaders, and endowing this acid with the ability to cause harm is contrary to the survival of our species. The cause of stress-related mucosal injury is hypoperfusion of the gastric mucosa, not the acidity of gastric secretions.
