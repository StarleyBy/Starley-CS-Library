# **Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome**

*Physicians think they do a lot for a patient when they give his disease a name.*

Immanuel Kant

The disease entity described in this chapter has had several names over the years, including shock lung, Da Nang lung (from the Vietnam war), stiff-lung, leaky capillary pulmonary edema, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, acute lung injury, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and most recently, *acute respiratory distress syndrome*, or *ARDS*. However, none of these names provides any useful information about the disease, which is a diffuse inflammatory injury of the lungs, and one of the leading causes of acute respiratory failure in modern times [\(1](#page-20-0)[–3](#page-20-1)).

### **PATHOGENESIS**

The first clinical report of ARDS appeared in 1967 [\(4](#page-20-2)), and included 12 patients with refractory hypoxemia and bilateral, diffuse infiltrates on chest x-ray. Seven patients died, and autopsy findings revealed dense infiltration of the lungs with an inflammatory exudate. There was no evidence of infection, which indicated that ARDS is an acute inflammatory lung injury.

### **Inflammatory Injury**

The lung consolidation in ARDS originates with the activation of circulating neutrophils ([5\)](#page-20-3). This leads to neutrophil sequestration in the pulmonary microcirculation, where the neutrophils attach to the vascular endothelium and move between endothelial cells and into the lung parenchyma. The neutrophils then degranulate to release the contents of their cytoplasmic granules (i.e., proteolytic enzymes and toxic oxygen metabolites). Subsequent damage to the capillary walls then leads to exudation of protein-rich fluid, erythrocytes, and platelets into the lungs. The cellular and proteinaceous exudate eventually fills and obliterates the distal airspaces, as shown in [Figure](#page-2-0) 24.1. The inflammatory exudate contains fibrin, which can accumulate and produce irreversible pulmonary fibrosis if the inflammation does not resolve within a few weeks.

### **Predisposing Conditions**

ARDS is not a primary disorder, but is a consequence of a variety of infectious and noninfectious conditions. The typical conditions that predispose to ARDS are listed in [Table](#page-2-1) 24.1 ([1\)](#page-20-0). The most frequent offenders are pneumonia, extrapulmonary sepsis, septic shock, aspiration of gastric contents, blood transfusions, noncardiogenic shock, and multisystem trauma ([1\)](#page-20-0). The shared feature among all these conditions is the activation of neutrophils in the inflammatory response (see Figure 17.1), which is the principal inciting event in ARDS. About 10% of cases of ARDS have no identifiable source ([1\)](#page-20-0).

#### *COVID-19 and ARDS*

The pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is generally classified as ARDS when it causes hypoxemic respiratory failure, and at the height of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, ARDS was reported in one of every three patients hospitalized with COVID-19 [\(6](#page-20-4)). However, severe hypoxemia from COVID-19 is often associated with little or no change in lung compliance (distensibility) [\(7](#page-20-5)), which is not a characteristic finding in severe ARDS. Therefore, COVID-19 is a unique type of ARDS, which is relevant because many of the recent studies of ARDS have been in patients with COVID-19, and the results may not apply to other cases of ARDS.

### **THE DIAGNOSIS OF ARDS**

### **Clinical Features**

The clinical criteria for the diagnosis of ARDS are listed in [Table](#page-3-0) 24.2. The principal criteria include the acute onset of hypoxemic respiratory failure (as defined by a PaO<sup>2</sup> /FIO<sup>2</sup> ratio ≤300 mm Hg with PEEP = 5 cm H2O), bilateral infiltrates on the chest x-ray, the presence of a predisposing condition for ARDS, and no evidence of left heart failure or fluid overload ([8\)](#page-20-6). The earliest signs of ARDS are progressive dyspnea and hypoxemia. The chest x-ray can be unrevealing in the early hours after symptom onset, but bilateral pulmonary infiltrates begin to appear within 24 hours. The respiratory failure from ARDS often warrants admission to the ICU, and 80% of these patients require intubation and mechanical ventilation, typically in the first 48 hours after presentation [\(1](#page-20-0)).

### *Severity of Illness*

ARDS has a severity-of-illness rating based on the PaO<sup>2</sup> /FIO<sup>2</sup> ratio: i.e., a ratio of 201–300 mm Hg is mild illness, 100–200 mm Hg is moderate illness, and <100 mm Hg is severe illness ([1\)](#page-20-0). The in-hospital mortality rate is about 35% for mild ARDS, 40% for moderate ARDS, and 45% for severe ARDS ([1\)](#page-20-0).

### <span id="page-3-0"></span>**TABLE 24.2 Diagnostic Criteria for ARDS**

- 1. Acute onset (within 7 days).
- 2. Bilateral alveolar infiltrates on chest x-ray.
- 3. PaO<sup>2</sup> /FIO<sup>2</sup> ≤300 mm Hg with PEEP ≥5 mm Hg.
- 4. No evidence of left heart failure or fluid overload.
- 5. The presence of a predisposing condition.

From Reference 6. FIO<sup>2</sup> = fractional concentration of inhaled oxygen, PEEP = positive end-expiratory pressure.

### **Diagnostic Problems**

Despite almost 50 years of clinical experience with ARDS, errors in diagnosis (both overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis) are reported in as many as 50% of cases [\(1](#page-20-0)[,9](#page-20-7)). The following sections highlight some of the diagnostic pitfalls.

### *PEEP as a Diagnostic Criterion*

The standard definition of ARDS includes a requirement for positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), as shown in [Table](#page-3-0) 24.2 (item #3). This has been questioned [\(2](#page-20-8)), since the application of PEEP requires intubation and mechanical ventilation, which precludes cases of ARDS that do not require mechanical ventilation.

#### *Chest Radiography*

The classic radiographic appearance of ARDS is shown in the top panel of [Figure](#page-5-0) 24.2. The infiltrate has a finely granular or "ground-glass" appearance, and is evenly distributed in all lung fields, with no evidence of a pleural effusion. Unfortunately, the *characteristic features on chest x-ray are present in only 15–25% of cases of ARDS* ([10,](#page-20-9)[11\)](#page-20-10). More localized infiltrates are more common ([10\)](#page-20-9), as demonstrated by the chest x-ray in the lower panel of [Figure](#page-5-0) 24.2, which shows infiltrates that are confined to the lower lung fields, and a probable left-sided pleural effusion. This chest x-ray is from a case of ARDS secondary to gram-negative septicemia, and could be mistaken for cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

The chest x-ray is a major source of error in the diagnosis of ARDS. When compared with computed tomography (CT) of the chest (the most reliable imaging modality for ARDS), chest xrays have a negative predictive value of only 47% in ARDS [\(10](#page-20-9)), which means a negative chest x-ray has about a 50% chance of excluding the presence of ARDS. This is no better than predicting heads or tails on a coin toss.

#### *Lack of Specificity*

Many of the diagnostic criteria for ARDS are shared with other causes of acute respiratory failure (e.g., pneumonia), and this creates a risk for misdiagnoses. This is demonstrated by an autopsy study showing pathological evidence of ARDS in only 50% of the patients who died with a clinical diagnosis of ARDS [\(9](#page-20-7)). The likelihood of identifying ARDS in this study was 50%, similar to the performance of chest x-rays mentioned earlier.

#### *Pitfalls of the Wedge Pressure*

When the chest-x-ray shows overlapping features of ARDS and cardiogenic pulmonary edema (like the one in [Figure](#page-6-0) 24.3), the pulmonary artery "wedge" pressure has been used to distinguish between these two conditions: i.e., a wedge pressure ≤18 mm Hg is considered evidence of ARDS ([12\)](#page-20-11). This is problematic because *the wedge pressure is NOT a measure of capillary hydrostatic pressure*, as explained in Chapter 8 (see section titled WEDGE PRESSURE). The left atrial (wedge) pressure is lower than the capillary hydrostatic pressure, which creates the pressure gradient needed for flow in the pulmonary veins. This means that *a normal wedge pressure does not exclude the diagnosis of cardiogenic (hydrostatic) pulmonary edema*. The erroneous interpretation of the wedge pressure has undoubtedly led to the overdiagnosis of ARDS.

### **Computed Tomography**

Computed tomographic (CT) imaging has become a standard practice in the diagnosis of ARDS, and CT images can have a different appearance at different stages of the disease. This is demonstrated in [Figure](#page-6-0) 24.3. The CT image in the top panel is from the early stage of ARDS, and shows dense consolidation in the posterior lung regions, which are the dependent lung regions in the supine position. The CT image in the lower panel is from an advanced stage of ARDS ([13\)](#page-20-12), and shows diffuse, reticulated infiltrates (that may represent pulmonary fibrosis) in all lung fields. The CT appearance in ARDS has important implications for management (see later).

Images from Reference 7 (top panel) and Reference 13 (lower panel).

### **NON-VENTILATOR MANAGEMENT**

Other than treatment of the predisposing condition (if available), drug therapies aimed at improving survival in ARDS have been marked by failure rather than success. Failed therapies include surfactant (in adults), inhaled nitric oxide, inhaled prostacyclins, statins, corticosteroids (with a few exceptions described later), neuromuscular blockers, β-receptor agonists, interferon β-1a, and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor [\(14](#page-20-13)). As a result, the management of ARDS consists primarily of general supportive measures, including mechanical ventilation. This section focuses on support measures other than mechanical ventilation, especially ones that have a proven impact.

### **Patient Self-Induced Lung Injury (P-SILI)**

Avoiding intubation is a priority in ARDS. However, breathing with increased effort (as often occurs in patients with respiratory failure) can be a source of lung injury; a phenomenon known as "patient self-induced lung injury" (P-SILI) ([15\)](#page-20-14). This injury is attributed to large negative swings in intrathoracic pressure created by vigorous breathing efforts, as they can promote "negative pressure pulmonary edema" [\(16](#page-20-15)). The presumed mechanism is incomplete transmission of the negative intrathoracic pressures across the walls of intrathoracic blood vessels, which increases the transmural pressure that drives fluid out of the pulmonary capillaries (see [Figure](#page-8-0) 24.4). This tendency for edema formation is enhanced further by the "leaky" pulmonary capillaries in ARDS.

The other consequence of increased breathing efforts is an increase in inhaled (tidal) volumes, which can damage the lungs in ARDS by overstretching alveoli in unaffected areas of lung. This is similar to the "volutrauma" in ventilatory-induced lung injury (see later). Of interest, P-SILI can also occur during mechanical ventilation in patients who "overbreathe" the ventilator.

<span id="page-8-0"></span>![](_page_8_Figure_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 24.4** Schematic illustration of the factors involved in "patient self-induced lung injury" (P-SILI). See text for explanation.

### *Implications*

The risk of P-SILI implies that delays to intubation and mechanical ventilation can have deleterious consequences for patients who continue to have labored breathing. This highlights the importance of measures (e.g., oxygen therapy, sedation) that can relieve the sense of dyspnea and promote comfortable breathing. For patients who continue to breathe with increased efforts, intubation and mechanical ventilation is advised sooner rather than later.

### **Oxygen Therapy**

Providing supplemental O<sup>2</sup> is the first concern in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure. If conventional O<sup>2</sup> therapy (which delivers O<sup>2</sup> at rates up to 15 L/min) does not correct the hypoxemia, then a trial of high-flow nasal O<sup>2</sup> is warranted.

### *High-Flow Nasal O<sup>2</sup>*

High-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) provides heated and humidified O<sup>2</sup> at rates up to 40–60 L/min through specially-designed nasal prongs, and the circuit has an oxygen regulator that allows independent adjustments of the FIO<sup>2</sup> (see Figure 25.5). Studies of ARDS from COVID-19 ([17\)](#page-20-16) have shown that patients treated with HFNO had fewer intubations than patients treated with conventional O<sup>2</sup> therapy (although there was no difference in mortality rate). The reduction in intubation rate with HFNO is not a consistent finding [\(18](#page-20-17)), but it is now recommended as a *replacement* for conventional O<sup>2</sup> therapy in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure [\(2](#page-20-8)). The advantage of HFNO over conventional O<sup>2</sup> therapy is the ability to produce comfortable breathing (which is attributed to the high flow rate). This not only promotes patient well-being, it also reduces the risk of patient-induced self injury (P-SILI), and thus could limit the extent of lung

injury.

### *Don't Forget O<sup>2</sup> Toxicity*

The use of high-flow O<sup>2</sup> to delay or prevent intubation and mechanical ventilation often exposes patients to high concentrations of O<sup>2</sup> (i.e., FIO<sup>2</sup> ≥70%) for prolonged periods of time, and this introduces the risk of pulmonary O<sup>2</sup> toxicity. Attention to the risk of pulmonary O<sup>2</sup> toxicity is emphasized by the following statements:

- 1. Critically ill patients are often deficient in protective antioxidants (e.g., glutathione) ([19\)](#page-20-18), and thus are susceptible to O<sup>2</sup> toxicity.
- 2. High levels of O<sup>2</sup> accelerate the damaging effects of mechanical ventilation [\(20](#page-20-19)).
- 3. The lung injury in pulmonary O<sup>2</sup> toxicity is identical to ARDS, so cases of ARDS that progress while breathing high concentrations of O<sup>2</sup> could be the result of O<sup>2</sup> toxicity.

The above concerns highlight the importance of limiting the concentration of inhaled O<sup>2</sup> whenever possible. (The toxic effects of O<sup>2</sup> are presented in Chapter 25.)

### **Noninvasive Ventilation**

Noninvasive ventilation (NIV), which is described in Chapter 26 is a popular intervention in the early management of ARDS, and is most successful in preventing intubation in patients with mild ARDS (i.e., PaO<sup>2</sup> /FIO<sup>2</sup> = 201–300 mm Hg) ([21\)](#page-20-20). This is shown in [Figure](#page-10-0) 24.5 (panel on the left). The panel on the right shows that patients who fail NIV and require intubation have a much higher mortality rate. Although this is likely a reflection of the underlying severity of illness, it is also possible that patient self-induced lung injury (P-SILI) plays a role in the adverse outcomes.

#### *P-SILI and NIV Failure*

Failure to increase the PaO<sup>2</sup> /FIO<sup>2</sup> ratio after one hour of NIV indicates a poor response, and intubation should be considered at this time. Patients who fail NIV typically have increased tidal volumes (i.e., ≥9.5 mL/kg predicted body weight) ([22\)](#page-20-21), indicating an increased breathing effort, and suggesting the possible role of P-SILI in NIV failure. As such, intubation should be a serious consideration when the PaO<sup>2</sup> /FIO<sup>2</sup> ratio does not improve and the patient continues to have increased breathing efforts.

Panel on the left shows that NIV was most successful in preventing intubation in patients with mild ARDS (PaO<sup>2</sup> /FIO<sup>2</sup> = 201–300 mm Hg) and the panel on the right shows that failure of NIV has a higher mortality rate. Data from Reference 21. See text for further explanation.

### **Fluid Management**

The lungs are susceptible to fluid accumulation in ARDS because of the leaky pulmonary capillaries, so fluid management should be aimed at avoiding or correcting a positive fluid balance, which can reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation (23). This goal is best served by attention to daily fluid balances, with the use of diuretics to correct fluid excess. The positive intrathoracic pressures during mechanical ventilation will magnify the drop in cardiac output in response to hypovolemia, so it is also important to avoid fluid deficits, which can promote systemic hypoperfusion and aggravate the multiorgan dysfunction that often accompanies ARDS (24).

### **Corticosteroid Therapy**

You may already be aware that steroids enjoy a popularity in clinical medicine that is far greater than deserved, and ARDS provides an example of this phenomenon. There have been innumerable trials of steroid therapy in ARDS since the disease was first described almost 50 years ago, yet the role of steroid therapy in ARDS continues to be debated ([13,](#page-20-12)25), and the recommendations seem to change every 5–10 years. (Simply stated, if a drug effect is not convincing after 50 years, it's time to move on.)

Clinical trials of steroid therapy in ARDS have produced inconsistent results ([13,](#page-20-12)25,26), which is partly attributed to the heterogeneity of the ARDS cases, and to differences in the steroid regimens. The following recommendations are based on evidence of improved outcomes with steroid therapy in at least some clinical trials. This information is summarized in [Table](#page-11-0) 24.3.

#### *COVID-19*

*Dexamethasone* (6 mg IV or PO daily for up to 10 days) is recommended for cases of COVID-19 that require supplemental O<sup>2</sup> or some form of ventilatory assistance (noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation) (27). There is no evidence that this steroid regimen impairs clearance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (28).

#### *Moderate-to-Severe ARDS*

The most recent clinical practice guideline includes a weak recommendation for steroid therapy the first 14 days for patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS (PaO<sup>2</sup> /FIO<sup>2</sup> ratio <200 mm Hg with PEEP = 10 cm H2O) (29). There are two steroid regimens (see [Table](#page-11-0) 24.3). Both use intravenous infusions of methylprednisolone. One regimen is initiated in the early stage of disease (i.e., first 72 hours), and uses a methylprednisolone dose of 1 mg/kg/day (ideal body weight). The other regimen is used for ARDS that persists for 7–14 days, and uses a methylprednisolone dose of 2 mg/kg/day. (The latter regimen is aimed at the fibrinoproliferative phase of ARDS, which begins 7–14 days after the onset of illness, and culminates in irreversible pulmonary fibrosis) (30). Both steroid regimens are continued for 14 days, with a slow taper over this time.

### *Adverse Effects*

Hyperglycemia is the most frequently reported side effect of steroid therapy for ARDS (25). The most feared complication is an acute myopathy that is typically associated with the combined use of high dose steroids and neuromuscular blocking agents, but this is rare (31).

From References 27,29. IBW = ideal body weight.

### **Prone Positioning**

CT images like the one at the top of [Figure](#page-6-0) 24.3, which shows a dense consolidation in the posterior lung regions [\(7](#page-20-5),32), prompted studies of prone positioning to redirect blood flow to better aerated anterior lung regions.

#### *Physiological Effects*

Prone positioning not only increases blood flow in the anterior region of the lungs, it also promotes aeration in posterior lung segments (33). Both effects serve to improve arterial oxygenation and facilitate CO<sup>2</sup> removal. During spontaneous breathing, a switch to the prone position reduces both the respiratory rate and the work of breathing (34), possibly by increasing lung compliance (i.e., distensibility). There is also a decrease in pulmonary artery pressures (35), which helps alleviate right heart strain.

#### *When to Use*

Prone positioning was originally used as a rescue maneuver for refractory hypoxemia in mechanically ventilated cases of ARDS, but the COVID-19 pandemic shifted attention to the use of prone positioning in spontaneously breathing patients, where it proved effective in preventing intubation in select groups of patients. The current indications for prone positioning in ARDS are shown in [Table](#page-12-0) 24.4, and are based on the observations summarized below.

- 1. In spontaneously breathing patients with ARDS, prone positioning can reduce the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation, but only in patients who are receiving high-flow nasal O<sup>2</sup> or noninvasive ventilation (36). Despite fewer intubations in these patients, there is no impact on the mortality rate (36).
- 2. In mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS, prone positioning has a proven survival benefit in patients with moderate-to-severe disease (i.e., PaO<sup>2</sup> /FIO<sup>2</sup> <150 mm Hg with PEEP ≥5 cm H2O, or an FIO<sup>2</sup> ≥60% with PEEP of 10 cm H2O) who are ventilated at low tidal volumes (about 6 mL/kg predicted body weight) (37).

**CONCERNS:** The ability of prone positioning to prevent intubation is derived from studies of COVID-19 ARDS, and the results may not apply to ARDS from other sources (because COVID-19 is a unique form of ARDS, as mentioned earlier). In addition, the survival benefit of prone positioning in mechanically ventilated patients is not a consistent finding (38).

One proposal that deserves attention is *the possibility that the success of prone positioning is dependent on appearance of the CT scan* ([7\)](#page-20-5), with a greater likelihood of success when the CT scan shows dense consolidation in the posterior lung regions.

<sup>†</sup>Includes only absolute contraindications, from Reference 40. ICP = intracranial pressure.

**CONTRAINDICATIONS:** The absolute contraindications for prone positioning are listed in [Table](#page-12-0) 24.4 (39). Relative contraindications include circulatory shock, pregnancy, recent life-threatening arrhythmias, and functioning chest tubes (39). The use of vasopressors is not a contraindication if the clinical condition is stable or improving.

#### *How to Use*

ICUs usually have a protocol for prone positioning, and the following are some important considerations for this protocol.

**DURATION:** The duration of prone positioning is an important determinant of success. For spontaneously breathing patients, at least 8 hours of prone positioning daily (in a single session) is recommended (40). For mechanically ventilated patients, at least 16 hours in the prone position each day is advised ([2\)](#page-20-8).

**EVALUATION:** A beneficial response (e.g., increase in the PaO<sup>2</sup> /FIO<sup>2</sup> ratio, increase in lung compliance) should be seen after the first session of prone positioning; if the improvement persists for 4 hours after the session, then prone positioning is no longer needed (38). If there no evidence of benefit after a session of prone positioning, then further sessions are not warranted.

**COMPLICATIONS:** Complications of prone positioning include patient discomfort, vomiting, brachial plexus injury, pressure sores, dislodgement of endotracheal tubes and vascular catheters, and transient arrhythmias. These are generally infrequent (39).

### **MECHANICAL VENTILATION IN ARDS**

ARDS is the most common cause of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation [\(1](#page-20-0)), so the discovery that *mechanical ventilation can be a source of lung injury that resembles ARDS* has profound implications. This section describes the lung injury related to mechanical ventilation, and the strategy that is designed to limit this injury.

### **Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury**

Positive pressure mechanical ventilation rose to prominence during the polio epidemic in the 1950s, and it did not take long to recognize that positive pressure lung inflations could rupture distal airspaces and produce pneumothoraces. A more complete picture of the lung injury from mechanical ventilation emerged in 1967 as the *respirator lung syndrome* (41), which was described as diffuse inflammatory infiltration in the lungs with hyaline membrane formation. Later studies showed that mechanical ventilation produces stress fractures in the alveolar capillary interface, as shown in [Figure](#page-15-0) 24.6, and this damage promotes inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs (42). This condition is now known as "ventilator-induced lung injury" (VILI) (42). Multiple factors are involved in this injury, as described next.

#### *Volutrauma*

When the lungs are stiff (as occurs in ARDS), ventilators must generate higher pressures to deliver a given tidal volume, and VILI was initialy considered to be a pressure-related injury

(i.e., barotrauma). However, a landmark study in the 1980s showed that VILI is the result of high inflation *volumes*, not high inflation airway pressures (43). Instead of barotrauma, the culprit in VILI is *volutrauma*.

There are two predisposing factors for volutrauma. The first is the high tidal volumes used during mechanical ventilation. When positive pressure ventilation was first introduced, large tidal volumes were adopted to reduce the tendency for atelectasis during controlled ventilation (44). The traditional tidal volumes during mechanical ventilation are 12−15 mL/kg (ideal body weight), which is about twice the normal tidal volume (6−7 mL/kg). The second predisposing factor is the reduced volume capacity of the lungs in ARDS, as demonstrated in the CT scan at the top of [Figure](#page-6-0) 24.3. Thus, tidal volumes that are twice normal are being forced into lungs that are operating at 50% capacity. This volume mismatch is the principal source of alveolar rupture, and disruption of the alveolar-capillary interface.

**FIGURE 24.6** Electron micrographs of a (postmortem) lung specimen from a patient with ARDS, which shows a tear in the alveolar-capillary interface from alveolar overdistension during

#### Atelectrauma

The decrease in lung distensibility in ARDS results in the collapse of small airways at the end of expiration, followed by reopening of the airways when the tidal volume is delivered. This cyclical opening and closing of the small airways creates shear forces that damage the airway epithelium (45). This phenomenon has been given the name *atelectrauma* (46), and it can be minimized or eliminated by applying positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to hold the small airways open at the end of expiration.

#### Biotrauma

The physical forces involved in high-volume mechanical ventilation in ARDS can trigger the release of proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs, and these can reach the systemic circulation and produce a systemic inflammatory response (47). This occurs in the absence of structural damage in the lungs, and is known as *biotrauma*. The systemic inflammatory response from biotrauma can promote inflammatory injury in other organs, which means that *mechanical ventilation can be a source of extrapulmonary organ injury and multiorgan failure* (48)!

### **Lung Protective Ventilation**

Lung protective ventilation employs reduced tidal volumes to protect against volutrauma and biotrauma, and uses positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to prevent atelectrauma. A protocol for lung protective ventilation is shown in Table 24.5. The goal is a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg, using *predicted body weight*, which is the body weight associated with normal lung volumes. Note that another goal is an end-inspiratory "plateau" pressure  $\leq$ 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. This pressure is described in Chapter 27, and is a reflection of the peak pressure in the alveoli. A peak alveolar pressure of  $\geq$ 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O creates a risk of alveolar rupture, hence the goal of lung protective ventilation is a peak alveolar pressure  $\leq$ 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O.

#### *Positive End-Expiratory Pressure*

Lung protective ventilation employs a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cm H2O, to prevent the collapse of small airways at the end of expiration. This is aimed at preventing the cyclical opening and closing of small airways that produces atelectrauma. (PEEP is described further in Chapter 27).

#### *Permissive Hypercapnia*

Low volume ventilation impairs CO<sup>2</sup> removal, and promotes hypercapnia. This is allowed as long as there is no evidence of harm (e.g., CO<sup>2</sup> narcosis). The limits of tolerance to hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis are unclear, but data from clinical trials of "permissive hypercapnia" show that arterial PCO<sup>2</sup> levels of 60–70 mm Hg and arterial pH levels of 7.2–7.25 are safe for most patients (49). The target pH is 7.30–7.45 in the protocol for lung protective ventilation.

#### *Survival Benefit*

*Lung protective ventilation is the only ventilatory strategy that has shown a survival benefit in ARDS* (49,50); as a result, it is strongly recommended as the preferred method of mechanical ventilation in ARDS [\(2](#page-20-8)[,3](#page-20-1)). However, the benefit of lung protective ventilation is not a consistent finding (51), and it has not gained widespread acceptance. In one survey, fewer than two-thirds of patients with ARDS received tidal volumes ≤8 mL/kg predicted body weight [\(1](#page-20-0)).

### **Airway Pressure Release Ventilation**

A different approach to mechanical ventilation in ARDS is to open collapsed alveoli with a mode of ventilation known as "airway pressure release ventilation (APRV), which uses prolonged periods of spontaneous breathing at high intrathoracic pressures, interspersed with brief periods of pressure release. This is shown in [Figure](#page-18-0) 24.7. The prolonged periods of breathing at high pressures are designed to open collapsed alveoli, which will increase arterial oxygenation and reduce lung stiffness, while the pressure release facilitates CO<sup>2</sup> elimination (52). The high pressure is usually set at the last plateau pressure (not to exceed 30 cm H2O to prevent alveolar overdistension), while the low pressure is set at 5 cm H2O.

<span id="page-18-0"></span>![](_page_18_Figure_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 24.7** The pattern of ventilation in "airway pressure release ventilation" (APRV). See text for explanation.

One study comparing APRV with lung protective ventilation showed that APRV reduced the time on mechanical ventilation, but without a survival benefit (53). There are also anecdotal claims of success with APRV (the author included), but more studies are awaited.

### **Therapeutic Misdirection?**

Mechanical ventilation is not a treatment for ARDS—in fact, the benefit of lung protective ventilation is to *do less damage* with mechanical ventilation. Moreover, the focus on the lungs in treating ARDS neglects evidence showing that *the principal cause of death in ARDS is multiorgan failure, not respiratory failure* (with the possible exception of COVID-19) (54,55). As many as 70% of deaths in ARDS are the result of multiorgan failure (54), and the mortality rate is directly related to the number of failed organs. This is demonstrated in [Figure](#page-19-0) 24.8, which indicates that the mortality in ARDS is a function of a progressive systemic condition, and it implies that the therapeutic focus on the lungs in ARDS is a prescription for failure.

### **Extracorporeal Life Support**

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a consideration for the 10–15% of ARDS patients with hypoxemia that is refractory to mechanical ventilation and prone positioning (56). The most recent indications include a PaO2,/FIO2, ratio <80 mm Hg for at least 6 hours, or <50 mm Hg for at least 3 hours (57). The extracorporeal support strategy for ARDS includes venovenous ECMO with lung protective mechanical ventilation, and extracorporeal CO2, removal, if needed. The technical aspects of extracorporeal support are beyond the scope of this text, but are available in the bibliography (55,58).

ECMO was first used for a patient with ARDS in 1971, and since that time, numerous studies have shown negative or inconsistent results, with some success in patients with viral pneumonias (e.g., influenza A(H1N1), and COVID-19) (57). Since ECMO is a temporary measure, its success is determined by the reversibility of the ARDS, which can be difficult to predict in the first few weeks of the illness.

## **A FINAL WORD**

### **The Evils of Inflammation**

One of the recurring themes in this book is the dominance of inflammation as a source of organ injury and lethal outcomes in critically ill patients. The destructive actions of inflammation take center stage in ARDS, and also in inflammatory shock (see Chapter 17), and it is possible that

inflammation (not hypoxia) is the principal cause of death in ICUs. (See A FINAL WORD in Chapter 17.)

As is the case with inflammatory shock, there is no specific therapy for ARDS, and management is supportive in nature. Until a remedy is available for the damaging effects of inflammation, conditions like inflammatory shock and ARDS will continue to be a major source of morbidity and mortality.
