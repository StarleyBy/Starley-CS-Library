# **Magnesium**

*You can know the name of a bird in all the languages of the world, but you'll know absolutely nothing about the bird. So let's look at the bird and see what it's doing – that's what counts.*

Richard Feynman (*[a](#page-9-0)*)

Magnesium is essential for energy utilization in the organic world. To begin with, magnesium is the heart of the chlorophyll molecule in green plants, which captures the radiant energy in sunlight and stores it in the carbon bonds that hold carbohydrates together. Aerobic organisms then transfer this energy to adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and the release of energy from ATP requires magnesium (which is an essential cofactor for ATPase enzymes). Thus, magnesium is essential for providing us with energy from the sun, and for allowing us to utilize this energy to sustain life.

Magnesium is also essential for the proper functioning of the Na+–K+ exchange pump (which is a magnesium-dependent ATPase) that is responsible for the electrical gradient across cell membranes. As a result, magnesium plays an important role in the activity of excitable tissues ([1–](#page-9-1)[4\)](#page-9-2). Magnesium also regulates the movement of calcium into smooth muscle cells, which gives it a pivotal role in the maintenance of cardiac contractile strength and peripheral vascular tone ([4\)](#page-9-2).

Now that's an element.

# **MAGNESIUM BASICS**

The distribution of magnesium (Mg) in the human body is shown in [Table](#page-1-0) 37.1 [\(5](#page-9-3)). The averagesized adult contains approximately 24 g (1 mole, or 2,000 mEq) of magnesium; a little over half is located in bone, whereas *less than 1% is located in plasma*. This lack of representation in the plasma limits the value of the plasma Mg as a measure of total body Mg (similar to the limitation described for the plasma K+ measurement). One consequence of this is that *plasma Mg levels can be normal in the face of total body Mg depletion* ([5,](#page-9-3)[6\)](#page-9-4).

## **Serum Magnesium**

Serum is favored over plasma for measuring Mg levels because the anticoagulant used for plasma samples can be contaminated with citrate or other anions that bind Mg [\(5](#page-9-3)). The reference range for serum Mg depends on the daily Mg intake, which varies according to geographic region. The normal range of serum Mg for [healthy](#page-2-0) adults in the United States is shown in Table 37.2 ([7\)](#page-9-5).

## *Converting Units*

The clinical laboratory typically reports the serum Mg concentration in mg/dL (because Mg is partially bound to plasma proteins), while the medical literature typically uses mEq/L for the serum Mg concentration. The conversion is as follows:

$$mEq/L = \frac{mg/dL \times 10}{mol \text{ wt}} \times \text{valence}$$
 (37.1)

where mol wt is the molecular weight (atomic weight in the case of Mg) and valence is the number of charges on the atom or molecule. Magnesium has an atomic weight of 24 and a valence of 2, so a serum Mg concentration of 1.7 mg/dL is equivalent to (1.7 × 10)/24 × 2 = 1.4 mEq/L.

To complicate matters further, the International System of Units (SI units) uses mmol/L to express the serum Mg concentration. The conversion is: mmol/L = mEq/L × 0.5.

|               |                                                           |  |  |
|               |                                                           |  |  |

#### *Ionized Magnesium*

About 67% of the Mg in plasma is in the ionized (active) form (see [Table](#page-2-0) 37.2), and the remaining 33% is either bound to plasma proteins, or chelated with divalent anions such as phosphate and sulfate [\(8](#page-9-6)). The standard assay for Mg measures all three fractions, so in cases of hypomagnesemia, it is not possible to determine if the problem is a decrease in the ionized (active) fraction, or a decrease in the bound fractions (e.g., hypoproteinemia) ([9\)](#page-9-7). The level of ionized Mg can be measured with an ion-specific electrode, but this is not routinely available.

However, the clinical significance of monitoring ionized Mg versus total Mg is unclear.

|                | mg/dL                                            | mEq/L   | mmol/L  |

## **Urinary Magnesium**

Only small quantities of Mg are normally excreted in the urine (i.e., about 5–15 mEq in 24 hrs) ([7\)](#page-9-5). When Mg intake is deficient, the kidneys conserve Mg further, and urinary Mg excretion falls to negligible levels. This is shown in [Figure](#page-2-1) 37.1 [\(10](#page-9-8)). Note that the plasma Mg remains in the normal range one week after starting a magnesium-free diet, while the urinary Mg excretion has dropped to negligible levels. This illustrates the relative value of urinary Mg excretion in the early detection of Mg deficiency.

**FIGURE 37.1** Urinary magnesium excretion and plasma magnesium levels in a healthy volunteer placed on a magnesium-free diet. Solid bars on the vertical axis represent the normal range for each variable. Adapted from Reference 10.

# **MAGNESIUM DEFICIENCY**

Hypomagnesemia (total serum Mg < 1.7 mg/dL or <0.7 mmol/L) is reported in as many as 65% of ICU patients ([2,](#page-9-9)[11\)](#page-9-10), and the frequency of magnesium deficiency is likely to be higher (because magnesium deficiency can exist without hypomagnesemia).

# **Predisposing Conditions**

The most common predisposing conditions for magnesium depletion in the ICU are listed in [Table](#page-3-0) 37.3.

<span id="page-3-0"></span>

<sup>§</sup>Parentheses indicate frequency of associated hypomagnesemia.

#### *Diuretic Therapy*

Diuretics are a leading cause of Mg deficiency in ICUs. Diuretic-induced inhibition of sodium reabsorption also interferes with magnesium reabsorption, and the resultant urinary magnesium losses can parallel urinary sodium losses. Urinary magnesium excretion is most pronounced with the loop diuretics (furosemide and ethacrynic acid). *Magnesium deficiency has been reported in 50% of patients receiving chronic therapy with furosemide* ([12\)](#page-9-11). Thiazides have a similar tendency to produce hypomagnesemia [\(3](#page-9-12)). Magnesium depletion does not occur with potassiumsparing diuretics ([13\)](#page-9-13).

## *Other Drugs*

The following drugs are notable for causing hypomagnesemia:

- 1. The aminoglycosides block magnesium reabsorption in the ascending loop of Henley, and hypomagnesemia has been reported in 30% of patients receiving aminoglycosides [\(14](#page-9-14)).
- 2. Proton pump inhibitors and metformin can produce hypomagnesemia by blocking magnesium absorption in the GI tract [\(3](#page-9-12)[,15](#page-9-15)).
- 3. Insulin and epinephrine produce hypomagnesemia by shifting magnesium into cells [\(3](#page-9-12)).
- 4. Cisplatin and carboplatin can cause hypomagnesemia by promoting renal magnesium excretion ([3\)](#page-9-12).

#### *Alcohol-Use Disorder*

Hypomagnesemia is reported in 44% of patients with chronic alcohol-use disorder ([16\)](#page-9-16). Multiple factors are involved, including malnutrition, chronic diarrhea, and a blunted renal response to magnesium depletion.

# *Secretory Diarrhea*

Secretions from the lower GI tract are rich in magnesium (10–14 mEq/L) [\(17](#page-9-17)), and secretory diarrhea can be accompanied by profound magnesium depletion [\(18](#page-9-18)). Upper GI tract secretions are not rich in magnesium (1–2 mEq/L), so vomiting does not pose a risk for magnesium depletion.

#### *Diabetes Mellitus*

Magnesium depletion is common in insulin-dependent diabetic patients, probably as a result of urinary Mg losses that accompany glycosuria ([19\)](#page-9-19). Hypomagnesemia is reported in only 7% of admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis, but the incidence increases to 50% over the first 12 hours after admission ([20\)](#page-9-20), probably as a result of insulin-induced movement of magnesium into cells.

### *Acute Myocardial Infarction*

Hypomagnesemia is reported in as many as 80% of patients with acute myocardial infarction ([21\)](#page-9-21). Several mechanisms may be involved, including an intracellular shift of Mg from excess catecholamines.

# **Clinical Manifestations**

There are no specific clinical manifestations of Mg deficiency, but the following clinical findings can increase suspicion of Mg deficiency.

#### *Other Electrolyte Abnormalities*

Magnesium depletion is often accompanied by a decrease in serum levels of sodium, potassium, phosphate, and calcium (see [Table](#page-3-0) 37.3) ([22\)](#page-9-22).

**HYPOKALEMIA:** Hypokalemia is reported in 40% of cases of Mg depletion ([22\)](#page-9-22). More importantly, *the hypokalemia that accompanies Mg depletion can be refractory to K+ replacement*, and Mg replacement is necessary before the hypokalemia can be corrected [\(23](#page-9-23)).

**HYPOCALCEMIA:** Magnesium depletion can cause hypocalcemia as a result of impaired parathormone release ([24\)](#page-9-24) combined with an impaired end-organ response to parathormone [\(25](#page-9-25)). As with the hypokalemia, *the hypocalcemia that accompanies Mg depletion is difficult to correct until Mg deficits are corrected*.

**HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA:** Phosphate depletion is a cause rather than an effect of Mg depletion. The mechanism is enhanced renal Mg excretion [\(26](#page-9-26)).

# *Arrhythmias*

Magnesium depletion will depolarize cardiac cells and promote arrhythmias. The following information regarding Mg and arrhythmias deserves mention:

- 1. Both digitalis and Mg deficiency act to inhibit the membrane pump, so Mg deficiency will promote digitalis cardiotoxicity. Intravenous magnesium can suppress digitalis-toxic arrhythmias, even when serum Mg levels are normal [\(27](#page-9-27)).
- 2. Intravenous magnesium can also abolish refractory ventricular arrhythmias when serum Mg levels are normal [\(28](#page-9-28)). This effect may be due to a membrane-stabilizing effect of magnesium that is unrelated to Mg repletion.
- 3. The most cited arrhythmia linked to magnesium depletion is polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, better known as *torsade de pointes*. The role of magnesium in this arrhythmia is

presented in Chapter 19 (see Figure 19.9).

#### *Neurologic Manifestations*

The neurologic manifestations of magnesium deficiency can include altered mentation, tremors, hyperreflexia, and generalized seizures. All are uncommon and nonspecific, but the following neurotoxic syndromes deserve mention.

**HYPERACTIVE CNS SYNDROME:** A magnesium-related neurologic syndrome has been reported that presents with ataxia, slurred speech, excessive salivation, diffuse muscle spasms, generalized seizures, and progressive obtundation ([29\)](#page-9-29). The symptoms are often triggered by loud noises or bodily contact. This syndrome is associated with reduced Mg levels in cerebrospinal fluid, and it resolves with Mg infusions. The prevalence of this disorder is unknown.

**WERNICKE'S:** Magnesium is required for the transformation of thiamine into thiamine pyrophosphate, so *magnesium deficiency can promote thiamine deficiency, even in the face of adequate thiamine intake* [\(30](#page-9-30),31).

# **Magnesium Replacement**

The daily requirement for magnesium in healthy adults is 420 mg (35 mEq) for males and 320 mg (26 mEq) for females (see [Table](#page-5-0) 37.4) (32). (*Note:* The daily requirements for magnesium are likely to be higher in ICU patients because conditions that predispose to magnesium depletion are common in these patients.) The popular oral preparation for magnesium maintenance therapy is magnesium oxide, available in 400 mg tablets, which contain 241 mg (20 mEq) of elemental magnesium (33).

Absorption of magnesium from the GI tract can be erratic in ICU patients, so intravenous magnesium is used for magnesium replacement. The standard intravenous preparation is magnesium sulfate (MgSO<sup>4</sup> ), which is available as magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (MgSO<sup>4</sup> ·7H2O) (34). *Each gram of this MgSO<sup>4</sup> preparation has about 8 mEq (4 mmol) of elemental magnesium* (whereas one gram of MgSO<sup>4</sup> has about twice the amount of elemental magnesium) (34). Ringer's solutions should not be used as the diluent for MgSO<sup>4</sup> because the calcium in Ringer's solutions will counteract the actions of magnesium.

| Normal Daily Requirements:<br>Adult Males (>30 yrs)<br>Adult Females (>30 yrs) | 420 mg (35 mEq, 17.5 mmol)<br>320 mg (26 mEq, 13 mmol) |  |
| Oral Preparation:<br>Magnesium Oxide (400 mg)                                  | 241 mg (20 mEq, 10 mmol)                               |  |

The magnesium content is for magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (MgSO<sup>4</sup> ·7 H2O), which is the usual MgSO<sup>4</sup> preparation.

The following magnesium replacement protocols are recommended for patients with normal renal function (35). (*Note:* The MgSO<sup>4</sup> in these recommendations is for the MgSO<sup>4</sup> ·7H2O preparation.)

#### *Mild Hypomagnesemia*

The following dosing regimen can be used for a serum Mg of 1–1.4 mEq/L (1.2– 1.7 mg/dL, or 0.5–1 mmol/L) that is clinically silent:

- 1. Assume a total magnesium deficit of 1–2 mEq/kg.
- 2. Because 50% of the infused magnesium can be lost in the urine, assume that the total magnesium requirement is twice the magnesium deficit.
- 3. Replace 1 mEq/kg for the first 24 hours, and 0.5 mEq/kg daily for the next 3–5 days.

#### *Moderate Hypomagnesemia*

The following protocol is recommended for a serum Mg < 1 mEq/L (<1.2 mg/dL, or <0.5 mmol/L), or for hypomagnesemia that is accompanied by other electrolyte abnormalities:

- 1. Add 6 g MgSO<sup>4</sup> (48 mEq of Mg) to 250 or 500 mL isotonic saline and infuse over 3 hours.
- 2. Follow with 5 g MgSO<sup>4</sup> (40 mEq of Mg) in 250 or 500 mL isotonic saline infused over the next 6 hours.
- 3. Continue with 5 g MgSO<sup>4</sup> every 12 hours (by continuous infusion) for the next 5 days.

# *Life-Threatening Hypomagnesemia*

The following is recommended for hypomagnesemia associated with serious cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., torsade de pointes) or generalized seizures:

- 1. Infuse 2 g MgSO<sup>4</sup> (16 mEq, or 8 mmol of Mg) intravenously over 2–5 minutes.
- 2. Follow with 5 g MgSO<sup>4</sup> (40 mEq, or 20 mmol of Mg) in 250 or 500 mL isotonic saline and infuse over the next 6 hours.
- 3. Continue with 5 g MgSO<sup>4</sup> every 12 hours (by continuous infusion) for the next 5 days.

# *Hypomagnesemia and Renal Insufficiency*

Hypomagnesemia is not common in patients with renal insufficiency but it can occur when extrarenal Mg losses are combined with a creatinine clearance of 30–50 mL/min. When magnesium is replaced in patients with renal insufficiency, no more than 50% of the magnesium in the standard replacement protocols should be administered (35), and the serum Mg should be monitored carefully.

# **Monitoring Magnesium Replacement**

Serum Mg levels will rise after the initial magnesium bolus, but will begin to fall after 15

minutes. Therefore, it is important to follow the bolus dose with a continuous magnesium infusion. Serum Mg levels may normalize after 1 to 2 days, but it will take several days to replenish the total body Mg stores. The magnesium retention test in [Table](#page-7-0) 37.5 can be valuable for identifying the end-point of Mg replacement therapy [\(3](#page-9-12),36).

#### <span id="page-7-0"></span>**TABLE 37.5 Magnesium Retention Test**

#### *Protocol:*

- 1. Add 6 grams MgSO<sup>4</sup> (24 mmol or 48 mEq elemental Mg) to 250 mL of isotonic saline and infuse over 1 hr.
- 2. Collect urine for 24 hrs, beginning with the onset of the magnesium infusion.

#### *Results:*

- 1. Urinary Mg excretion ≤12 mmol (24 mEq) in 24 hrs (i.e., ≤50% of the infused Mg) is evidence of continued Mg depletion.
- 2. Urinary Mg excretion >19 mmol (38 mEq) in 24 hrs (i.e., >80% of the infused Mg) indicates sufficient Mg stores.

From Reference 36.

#### *Magnesium Retention Test*

The magnesium retention test evaluates the percentage of an infused magnesium load that is excreted in the urine. The normal rate of magnesium reabsorption is close to the maximum rate (Tmax), so most of an infused magnesium load will be excreted in the urine when magnesium stores are normal. However, when magnesium stores are deficient, the magnesium reabsorption rate is much lower than the Tmax, so more of the infused magnesium will be reabsorbed, and less will be excreted in the urine. *Magnesium deficiency is likely when less than 50% of the infused Mg is recovered in the urine, and is unlikely when more than 80% of the infused Mg is excreted in the urine* (36,37).

The magnesium retention test has one unfortunate shortcoming: i.e., it can be unreliable when renal function is impaired (which is the case in many ICU patients).

# **HYPERMAGNESEMIA**

Hypermagnesemia is uncommon in hospitalized patients, with one survey showing a prevalence of 5% (38).

# **Predisposing Conditions**

Most cases of hypermagnesemia are the result of impaired renal function (i.e., creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) combined with a source of magnesium intake (e.g., from magnesiumcontaining antacids or laxatives) ([3\)](#page-9-12).

## *Massive Hemolysis*

The Mg concentration in erythrocytes is approximately three times greater than in serum (39), so hemolysis can increase the serum Mg. The serum Mg is expected to rise by 0.1 mEq/L for every 250 mL of erythrocytes that lyse completely (39), so hypermagnesemia is expected only with

massive hemolysis.

#### *Other Conditions*

Other conditions associated with (mild) hypermagnesemia are adrenal insufficiency, hyperparathyroidism, and lithium intoxication [\(3](#page-9-12)).

# **Clinical Features**

The clinical consequences of progressive hypermagnesemia are listed below (39).

| Threshold<br>Serum<br>Mg | Manifestation              |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| >4<br>mEq/L              | Hyporeflexia               |
| >5<br>mEq/L              | 1st°<br>AV<br>Block        |
| >10<br>mEq/L             | Complete<br>Heart<br>Block |
| >13<br>mEq/L             | Cardiac<br>Arrest          |

Magnesium has been described as *nature's physiologic calcium blocker* (40), and most of the serious consequences of hypermagnesemia are the result of calcium antagonism in the AV conduction system of the heart. Depressed contractility and vasodilation are not prominent.

# **Management**

Hemodialysis is the treatment of choice for severe hypermagnesemia. Intravenous calcium gluconate (1 g IV over 2 to 3 minutes) can be used to antagonize the cardiovascular effects of hypermagnesemia *temporarily*, until dialysis is started (41). If fluids are permissible and some renal function is preserved, aggressive volume infusion combined with furosemide may be effective in reducing the serum magnesium levels in less advanced cases of hypermagnesemia.

# **A FINAL WORD**

Magnesium often takes a back seat to other cations like sodium and potassium, but considering the vital roles of magnesium described in the introduction to this chapter, it deserves much more attention that it receives. The following are some specific points about magnesium that warrant emphasis:

- 1. The serum magnesium level can be normal in patients who are magnesium depleted.
- 2. Hypomagnesemia is reported in over 50% of ICU patients, and the frequency of magnesium depletion is likely to be even higher (because of statement #1). Diuretic therapy with furosemide is the leading cause of magnesium depletion in ICUs.
- 3. Magnesium depletion should be suspected in any patient with diuretic-induced hypokalemia, especially when hypokalemia is refractory to potassium replacement.
- 4. Magnesium replacement will correct the serum magnesium before total body stores of magnesium are replenished. The best indicator of magnesium repletion is the urinary retention

test (see [Table](#page-7-0) 37.5).
