# **Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia**

*Everything hinges on the matter of evidence.*

Carl Sagan

Pneumonias that develop during mechanical ventilation can be characterized by one word: *problematic*. The problems include the nonspecific clinical presentation of ventilator-associated pneumonia, the uncertainties in identifying the culprit organism, and the difficulties created by the emergence of multidrug resistant organisms in this condition.

This chapter addresses the multiple problems encountered in the approach to ventilatorassociated pneumonia, and includes recommendations from the most recent clinical practice guidelines on the subject ([1,](#page-13-0)[2\)](#page-13-1).

## **GENERAL INFORMATION**

The following statements include some basic information about ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

- 1. ICU-acquired pneumonias are divided into ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), with onset ≥48 hours after intubation, and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), with onset ≥48 hours after ICU admission in nonintubated patients. VAP is further classified as early onset (2–4 days after intubation) or late-onset (≥5 days after intubation).
- 2. VAP accounts for 80% of ICI-acquired pneumonias, and 60% of VAPs are late-onset.
- 3. The predominant pathogens in VAP and HAP are gram-negative enteric organisms and staphylococci (see [Table](#page-1-0) 29.1) [\(3](#page-13-2)). About one-quarter of the infections are polymicrobial.
- 4. Multidrug-resistant pathogens are a growing concern, and are more likely to appear in patients who have received intravenous antibiotics in the past 90 days, in patients who are immunocompromised or receiving renal replacement therapy, and in patients with septic shock ([2\)](#page-13-1).
- 5. Viruses are implicated in about 20% of cases of VAP and HAP [\(4](#page-13-3)). *Candida* species are common isolates in respiratory secretions, but are not known to cause pneumonia [\(5](#page-13-4)).

6. VAP prolongs the duration of mechanical ventilation, and increases the length of stay in the ICU ([5\)](#page-13-4), but the impact of VAP on survival is unclear [\(6](#page-13-5)). Some studies show that VAP has little of no effect on mortality rate ([7,](#page-13-6)[8\)](#page-13-7), while others show a small but significant increase in mortality rate ([3\)](#page-13-2).

## **PREVENTIVE MEASURES**

Aspiration of microbes from the oropharynx is the inciting event in most cases of VAP ([9\)](#page-13-8). Gram-negative aerobic bacilli are the predominant pathogens in the oropharynx of ICU patients (see Figure 4.4), and they are also the predominant pathogens in VAP, as shown in [Table](#page-1-0) 29.1 ([3\)](#page-13-2). Early cases of VAP (i.e., appear 2–4 days after intubation) are most likely caused by pathogens that are dragged into the airways during intubation.

#### **Oral Decontamination**

The discovery that pathogens in the oropharynx are the culprits in VAP led to the introduction of oral decontamination as a preventive measure for VAP. Oral decontamination is described in Chapter 4, and is briefly reviewed here.

#### *Methods*

There are two methods for eliminating pathogens from the oropharynx (see Table 4.1). The popular (but problematic) method is topical application of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate to the oral mucosa every 6 hours. The problem is evidence of increased mortality associated with chlorhexidine ([10\)](#page-13-9), which is attributed to a chlorhexidine-induced mucositis that disrupts the mucosal barrier in the mouth and leads to septicemia with pathogenic mouth organisms ([11\)](#page-13-10). Because of this risk, *chlorhexidine is no longer recommended for oral decontamination* in the most recent guidelines on VAP ([3\)](#page-13-2).

a Onset 2–4 days after intubation.

b Onset ≥5 days after intubation.

c Onset ≥48 hrs after ICU admission in non-ventilated patients.

The preferred decontamination method is *selective oral decontamination* (SOD) ([3\)](#page-13-2), which uses nonabsorbable antibiotics applied to the oral mucosa (see Table 4.1 for an example of an SOD regimen). The aim of SOD is to "selectively" eliminate pathogens while retaining the normal microbial environment in the mouth (which presumably helps to prevent further colonization with pathogens). The success of this approach is demonstrated in [Figure](#page-2-0) 29.1, which shows that SOD is associated with a significant decrease in both tracheal colonization and pneumonia in ventilator-dependent patients (12). Unfortunately, SOD has been unpopular in the United States, primarily due to the unfounded fear that SOD will promote bacterial resistance. (See Chapter 4 for more on this topic.)

#### **The Ventilator Bundle**

The Institute for Healthcare Improvement has advocated the use of "bundles" which are a collection of practices that, when used together, will improve outcomes. The bundle introduced for ventilator-dependent patients is shown in [Table](#page-2-1) 29.2. Although some of the practices in this bundle do not have a direct bearing on pneumonia, its use has been shown to reduce the incidence of VAP (13), and it is sometimes called the "VAP Bundle" (14).

#### <span id="page-2-1"></span>**TABLE 29.2 The Ventilator Bundle**

- 1. Elevate head of the bed to 30–45° above horizontal.
- 2. Prophylaxis for stress ulcer bleeding.
- 3. Prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism.

- 4. Daily sedation holiday.
- 5. Daily assessment of readiness to extubate.

#### *The Semirecumbent Position*

Elevation of the head of the bed to 30–45° (semirecumbent position) is considered an important measure for preventing gastroesophageal reflux and aspiration of gastric contents into the airways. However, while some studies have validated the benefit of the semirecumbent position (15), other studies have shown no difference in the incidence of VAP with patients in the supine and semirecumbent positions (16).

**COMMENT:** *Since the principal source of VAP is aspiration of pathogens in mouth secretions, elevating the head of the bed could increase the risk of VAP by promoting the movement of mouth secretions into the lungs (by gravity flow)*. This has never been studied, nor is it ever mentioned in discussions of the semirecumbent position to prevent VAP.

#### **Airway Care**

As mentioned in Chapter 28, tracheal tubes serve as a nidus for pathogenic colonization and biofilm formation (see Figure 28.4), and passing a suction catheter through the tubes can dislodge these biofilms and inoculate the lungs with pathogenic organisms (17). As a result of this risk, *routine suctioning of the airways is not recommended* (18). Instead, suctioning should be performed only when there is evidence of troublesome respiratory secretions.

#### *Subglottic Aspiration*

Inflation of the cuff on tracheal tubes does not prevent aspiration of mouth secretions into the lower airways, and concern about this aspiration prompted the introduction (in 1992) of specialized endotracheal tubes equipped with a suction port just above the cuff, as shown in [Figure](#page-4-0) 29.2. The section port is connected to a source of continuous suction (usually not exceeding –20 cm H2O) to clear the secretions that accumulate in the subglottic region. Clinical studies have shown *a significant reduction in the incidence of VAP when subglottic secretions are cleared using specialized endotracheal tubes* (19).

<span id="page-4-0"></span>![](_page_4_Figure_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 29.2** Endotracheal tube with a suction port placed just above the cuff to clear secretions that accumulate in the subglottic region.

## **CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS**

The traditional clinical criteria for the diagnosis of VAP include: (*a*) fever or hypothermia, (*b*) leukocytosis or leukopenia, (*c*), an increase in volume of respiratory secretions or a change in character of the secretions, and (*d*) a new or progressive infiltrate on the chest x-ray. The hallmark of these clinical criteria is their lack of reliability (20), as described next.

## **Reliability**

The performance of the diagnostic criteria for VAP is shown in [Table](#page-4-1) 29.3. In this case, the criteria were evaluated using cases of VAP that were diagnosed by lung biopsy (21). As indicated, none of the clinical criteria was sensitive or specific for the diagnosis of VAP, and the diagnostic odds ratio for each criterion was poor (see the legend of [Table](#page-4-1) 29.3 for a description of the diagnostic odds ratio). The poor performance of these diagnostic criteria indicate that *the diagnosis of VAP is not possible using clinical criteria alone*.

†The odds of a positive test in a patient with the disease relative to the odds of a positive test in a patient without the disease. A reliable test has an odds ratio of 10 or higher. Data from Reference 21.

#### *Specificity of Chest Radiography*

One of the major problems in the clinical diagnosis of VAP is the nonspecific nature of pulmonary infiltrates in ICU patients. This is indicated in [Table](#page-8-0) 29.4, which shows a specificity of only 26% for radiographic infiltrates. *Pneumonia accounts for only one-third of the pulmonary infiltrates in ICU patients* (22,23), which means that conditions other than pneumonia are the most frequent cause of pulmonary infiltrates in ICU patients. The noninfectious causes of pulmonary infiltrates in the ICU include focal atelectasis, pulmonary edema, and the acute respiratory distress syndrome.

The images in [Figure](#page-6-0) 29.3 demonstrate how portable chest x-rays can be misleading. Both chest x-rays in this figure were obtained within minutes of each other in the same patient. The xray on the left was taken after the patient exhaled in the supine position, and the x-ray on the right was obtained after the same patient inhaled in the upright position. Note the crowded lung markings at the right base in the image on the left, which were caused by the raised hemidiaphragm (from the supine position) and the relatively low lung volume (from the exhalation). In a patient with fever, this radiographic change could be mistaken for a basilar pneumonia.

## **MICROBIOLOGICAL EVALUATION**

The diagnosis of VAP rests heavily on identifying a responsible pathogen, but there is no standardized method for collecting or culturing respiratory secretions. Blood cultures have limited value because *in cases of suspected VAP, organisms isolated in blood cultures are often from extrapulmonary sites of origin* (24). The following is a brief review of the methods used to collect and culture respiratory secretions.

**FIGURE 29.3** The effect of body position and lung volume on the appearance of a portable chest x-ray. Both images were obtained within minutes of each other in the same patient. The supine film taken after exhalation shows crowded lung markings at the right base that could be mistaken for a basilar pneumonia in a patient with a fever. Image on the left digitally enhanced.

### **Tracheal Aspirates**

The traditional approach to suspected VAP involves aspiration of respiratory secretions through an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube, and these specimens can be contaminated with mouth secretions that are aspirated into the upper airway. A screening method to determine of the sample is appropriate for culture is described next (and should be performed routinely in the microbiology laboratory).

### *Microscopic Analysis*

The cellular content of a tracheal aspirate is used to determine the suitability of a specimen for culture. This is explained using the sputum Gram's stain in [Figure](#page-7-0) 29.4, which identifies two types of cells:

- 1. Squamous epithelial cells, which are large, flattened cells with abundant cytoplasm and a small nucleus. These cells line the oral cavity, and *the presence of more than 10 squamous epithelial cells per low power field (×10) indicates that the specimen is contaminated with mouth secretions*, and is not an appropriate specimen for culture (25).
- 2. Neutrophils, which are about the size of the nucleus of the epithelial cells, and have a multilobulated nucleus (which is not apparent in a low magnification view). The mere presence of neutrophils in respiratory secretions is not evidence of infection, since neutrophils can make up 20% of the cells recovered from a routine mouthwash (26). The neutrophils should be present in abundance to indicate infection; i.e., *more than 25 neutrophils per low power field (×10) is considered evidence of infection* (25). (However, this will not distinguish between tracheal bronchitis and pneumonia.)

#### *Qualitative Cultures*

The standard practice is to perform qualitative cultures on endotracheal aspirates (where the growth of organisms is reported, but there is no assessment of growth density). These cultures have a high sensitivity (usually >90%) but a very low specificity (15–40%) for identifying the culprit organism (27). This means that *for routine (qualitative) cultures of tracheal aspirates, a negative culture can be used to exclude the presence of a treatable infection, but a positive culture cannot be used as reliable evidence of the culprit organism*. The poor predictive value of positive cultures is due to contamination of tracheal aspirates with secretions from the mouth and upper airways.

**FIGURE 29.4** Sputum Gram's stain under low power magnification (×10) showing the appearance of squamous epithelial cells (from the oral cavity) and neutrophils.

#### *Quantitative Cultures*

For quantitative cultures of tracheal aspirates (where growth density is reported), the threshold for the diagnosis of VAP is 105 colony-forming units per mL (CFU/mL) (28). This threshold has a sensitivity of 76% and a specificity of 68% for identifying the [responsible](#page-8-0) pathogen (see Table 29.4) (21). Comparing these results with routine cultures (which have a sensitivity >90% and specificity ≤40%) shows that, *for cultures of tracheal aspirates, quantitative cultures are more*

*reliable for identifying the responsible pathogen*.

#### **Bronchoalveolar Lavage**

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is performed by wedging a bronchoscope in a distal airway (in a lung region where the infection is suspected) and performing a lavage with sterile isotonic saline. A minimum lavage volume of 120 mL is recommended for adequate sampling (29), which is achieved by performing a series of 6 lavages using 20 mL for each lavage (only 25% or less of the volume instilled will be returned via aspiration). The first lavage is usually discarded, and the remainder of the lavage fluid is pooled and sent to the microbiology lab for microscopic analysis and quantitative culture.

#### *Quantitative Cultures*

BAL specimens are cultured quantitatively, and the threshold for the diagnosis of VAP is 104 CFU/mL (28). The diagnostic performance of BAL cultures is shown in [Table](#page-8-0) 29.4 (21). The diagnostic odds ratio indicates that *BAL cultures are the most reliable cultures available*, but the sensitivity and specificity indicate they are far from ideal.

<sup>†</sup>The odds of a positive test in a patient with the disease relative to the odds of a positive test in a patient without the disease. A reliable test has an odds ratio of 10 or higher. Data from Reference 21.

#### *Intracellular Organisms*

Inspection of BAL specimens for intracellular organisms can help in guiding initial antibiotic therapy until culture results are available. *When intracellular organisms are present in more than 3% of the cells in the lavage fluid, the likelihood of pneumonia is over 90%* (30). This is not done on a routine Gram's stain, but requires special processing and staining, and will require a specific request to the microbiology lab.

### *BAL Without Bronchoscopy*

BAL can also be performed without the aid of bronchoscopy using a sheathed catheter like the one illustrated in [Figure](#page-9-0) 29.5. This catheter is about 50 cm in length, and is inserted through an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube and advanced "blindly" until it wedges in a distal airway. The tip of the catheter has a bioabsorbable polyethylene plug that prevents contamination while the catheter is advanced. Once wedged, an inner cannula is advanced to dislodge the plug, and the BAL is performed with 10–20 mL of sterile saline.

Nonbronchoscopic BAL (also called mini-BAL because of the lower lavage volume) is a safe procedure that can be performed by respiratory therapists (31). Despite the uncertainty about the location of the catheter tip in relation to the region of suspected infection, the yield from quantitative cultures with mini-BAL is equivalent to the yield with bronchoscopic BAL (32).

### **Protected Specimen Brush**

Aspiration of secretions through a bronchoscope produces false-positive cultures because of contamination as the bronchoscope is advanced through the upper respiratory tract (29). To eliminate this problem, a specialized brush called a *protected specimen brush* (PSB) was developed to collect uncontaminated secretions from the distal airways during bronchoscopy. Like the mini-BAL catheter, the PSB catheter has an inner cannula and a bioabsorbable plug at the tip to prevent contamination during catheter advancement. When the catheter tip is placed in the desired location, the brush is advanced from the inner cannula to collect samples from the distal airways.

<span id="page-9-0"></span>![](_page_9_Picture_3.jpeg)

**FIGURE 29.5** Protected catheter for performing bronchoalveolar lavage without the aid of bronchoscopy. See text for explanation.

#### *Quantitative Cultures*

PSB cultures are processed quantitatively, and the threshold for a positive culture is 103 CFU/mL (21). The diagnostic performance of PSB cultures is shown in [Table](#page-8-0) 29.4 (21); as indicated by the diagnostic odds ratio, PSB cultures are less reliable than BAL cultures, but are more specific than quantitative cultures of tracheal aspirates.

#### **Which Method is Preferred?**

The clinical practice guidelines differ about the appropriate culture method: i.e.,

- 1. The international guidelines ([1\)](#page-13-0) recommend quantitative cultures with BAL, mini-BAL, or PSB over cultures of tracheal aspirates, which optimizes accuracy, and reduces the number of false-positive cultures that result in overuse of antibiotics. These cultures, however, must be obtained prior to the start of empiric antibiotic therapy.
- 2. The U.S.-based guidelines [\(2](#page-13-1)) recommend routine tracheal cultures over all other culture methods, based on evidence that the more invasive procedures (BAL or PSB) do not improve clinical outcomes. Once again, these cultures should be obtained prior to the start of empiric antibiotic therapy.

Take your pick, although it seems that the culture methods with the best performance characteristics (i.e., BAL cultures) should be preferred, and using mini-BAL would avoid the extra cost of bronchoscopy.

## **PARAPNEUMONIC EFFUSIONS**

Pleural effusions are present in 20–40% of pneumonias in hospitalized patients (33). These *parapneumonic effusions* can be evident on chest x-ray, although ultrasound is recommended to define the location and size of the effusion (34), especially if thoracentesis is performed.

#### **Classification**

Parapneumonic effusions can be placed in 4 categories of increasing severity. These are outlined in [Table](#page-10-0) 29.5 (33).

<span id="page-10-0"></span>

| TABLE      | 29.5                                                  | Classification<br>of<br>Parapneumonic<br>Effusions                |               |  |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--|
|            | Character of Effusion                                 | Pleural Fluid Analysis                                            | Chest<br>Tube |  |
| Category 1 | <10 mm in thickness                                   | Thoracentesis not necessary                                       | No            |  |
| Category 2 | >10 mm thick but <50% of hemithorax,<br>free-flowing. | pH >7.20, Glucose >60 mg/dL, negative Gram's<br>stain & culture.  | No            |  |
| Category 3 | Loculated, or fills >50% of hemithorax.               | pH <7.20, Glucose <60 mg/dL, positive Gram's<br>stain or culture. | Yes           |  |
| Category 4 | Purulent                                              | Same as Category 3                                                | Yes           |  |

From Reference 33.

#### *Category 1*

Category 1 effusions are small (<10 mm on decubitus films, CT images, or ultrasound), and are free-flowing. No thoracentesis is required, unless the patient's clinical condition deteriorates and the effusion increases in size (see next).

#### *Category 2*

Category 2 effusions are small-to-moderate in size (>10 mm thickness, but fill less than one-half the hemithorax) and are free-flowing. Thoracentesis is advised, and as much fluid as possible should be removed. (*Note:* Some advise measuring the pleural pressure with a manometer during pleural drainage, and stopping the drainage if the pleural pressure reaches –20 cm H2O, to prevent negative-pressure pulmonary edema) (34). Pleural fluid analysis in category 2 effusions shows no evidence of infection: i.e., the pleural fluid pH is >7.20, the glucose is >60 mg/dL, and the Gram's stain and culture are negative. No other intervention is needed for these effusions.

#### *Category 3*

Category 3 effusions (are also called "complicated effusions") are either loculated, or they fill more than one-half of the hemithorax, and pleural fluid analysis reveals evidence of infection: i.e., the pH is <7.20, the glucose is <60 mg/dL, and the Gram's stain and/or culture is positive. Pleural drainage is required for these effusions, using small-bore (8.5–14 French) chest tubes.

#### *Category 4*

Category 4 effusions are empyemas; i.e., the pleural fluid is grossly purulent. Immediate pleural drainage is essential. Some prefer large (28–36 French) chest tubes for draining pus, but small bore (8.5–14 French) tubes achieve drainage that is equivalent to the larger tubes (35).

### **Antibiotics**

Pleural drainage of infected parapneumonic effusions should be combined with empiric antibiotic therapy. For parapneumonic effusions in hospitalized patients, empiric coverage should include methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus*, and gram-negative enteric organisms, including *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* (36). A suitable regimen would be vancomycin plus cefepime or piperacillin/tazobactam.

## **Ineffective Drainage**

Loculated effusions can be difficult to drain. If drainage is inadequate with the initial chest tube, an additional tube can be placed (preferably under CT guidance). Further problems with drainage should prompt a surgical consult for *video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery* (VATS), which can disrupt the pleural adhesions without a thoracotomy. The intrapleural administration of fibrinolytic agents is generally not advised for complicated parapneumonic effusions and empyema (36,37).

## **ANTIMICROBIAL THERAPY**

Prompt administration of empiric antibiotics is recommended for all cases of suspected VAP.

The antibiotic regimen is determined by the risk factors described next.

#### **Risk Factors**

The risk factors for an unfavorable outcome include all of the following [\(1](#page-13-0)[,2](#page-13-1)): (*a*) late-onset VAP, (*b*) septic shock, (*c*) prior infection with methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus. aureus* (MRSA) or a multidrug-resistant organism (i.e., resistant to at least two different classes of antibiotics), (*d*) a hospital microbiogram in which 25% of the isolates are resistant organisms, and (*e*) antibiotic exposure in the past 90 days.

### **Empiric Regimens**

The [recommended](#page-12-0) empiric regimens for low-risk and high-risk patients are outlined in Table 29.6 ([1,](#page-13-0)[2\)](#page-13-1), and are briefly summarized below.

#### *Low-Risk Regimen*

Early-onset cases of VAP without septic shock or any of the other risk factors just mentioned can be treated with a single agent that covers methicillin-sensitive *Staphylococcus aureus* (MSSA), gram-negative enteric organisms, and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* ([1,](#page-13-0)[2\)](#page-13-1). Candidates include cefepime, levofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam.

#### *High-Risk Regimen*

The high-risk empiric regimen includes coverage for MRSA (with vancomycin or linezolid) and antipseudomonal coverage with a β-lactam antibiotic (cefepime, levofloxacin, or piperacillin/tazobactam). If there is a high index of suspicion for a multidrug-resistant organism, additional gram-negative and antipseudomonal coverage is recommended using a non-β-lactam agent (a fluoroquinolone or an aminoglycoside) ([1\)](#page-13-0).

There is a tendency to continue empiric antibiotics despite negative culture results if patients are improving, but this is not justified, and antibiotics should be discontinued if all cultures are unrevealing.

§Include regimen C only if there is a high risk of infection with multidrug-resistant organisms. MSSA = methicillin-sensitive *S. aureus*. Recommendations from References 1 and 2.

#### **Treatment of Documented Pneumonia**

Antibiotic therapy of documented VAP will be dictated by the sensitivities of the isolated pathogen(s). The recommended duration of antibiotic therapy is 7 days [\(1](#page-13-0)[,2](#page-13-1)).

## **A FINAL WORD**

#### **The Mortality Risk with VAP**

As mentioned early in this chapter, a number of studies have shown that VAP has little or no impact on mortality rates [\(6](#page-13-5)[–8](#page-13-7)). This observation suggests one of the following scenarios:

- 1. We're really good at treating VAPs.
- 2. VAPs are not life-threatening infections.
- 3. VAPs are overdiagnosed.

Recalling the lack of specificity in the diagnostic criteria for VAP (see Tables 29.3 and 29.4), it seems that the third choice is the most appropriate.
