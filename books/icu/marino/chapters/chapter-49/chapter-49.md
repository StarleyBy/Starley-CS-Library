# **Enteral Nutrition**

*Forced feeding . . . goes on because the world still believes it can eat itself well.*

Herbert Shelton (*[a](#page-15-0)*)

For patients who are unable to eat, the preferred method of nutrition support is the infusion of liquid feeding formulas into the stomach or small bowel. This not only provides energy from nutrient fuels, it also serves as an *infection control measure* by promoting the barrier function of the bowel mucosa (as explained in the next section).

This chapter presents the practical aspects of providing enteral tube feedings: i.e., when to do it and when not to do it, how to do it, what feeding formulas to use, and what complications to watch for. When possible, recommendations are taken from clinical practice guidelines and recent reviews of the topic [\(1](#page-15-1)[–5](#page-15-2)).

### **GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS**

### **Infectious Risk**

The threat of sepsis and organ injury from the bowel is described in Chapter 4. The primacy of this threat is evident in the description of the bowel as "the motor of multiorgan failure" ([6\)](#page-15-3). The role of enteral tube feedings in mitigating this threat is summarized in the following statements:

- 1. The presence of bulk nutrients in the lumen of the bowel has a trophic effect on the bowel mucosa that preserves the structural integrity of the mucosa [\(7](#page-15-4)). This maintains the barrier function of the bowel mucosa, which protects against invasion from enteric pathogens via *translocation* across the bowel wall [\(8](#page-15-5)).
- 2. The trophic influence of enteral nutrition also includes immune defenses in the bowel, such as the production of immunoglobulin A (IgA) by monocytes in the bowel wall, which blocks the attachment of pathogens to the bowel mucosa ([9\)](#page-15-6).
- 3. The trophic effect of enteral nutrition requires nutritional bulk rather than the presence of nutrient fuels (i.e., carbohydrates, proteins and lipids), because the oral administration of

parenteral feeding solutions does not produce the effect [\(10](#page-15-7)). However, glutamine is believed to be involved in trophism because it is the principal fuel for enterocytes in the bowel mucosa ([11\)](#page-15-8).

4. The trophic effect of nutritional bulk is lost during periods of bowel rest, which is accompanied by progressive atrophy of the bowel mucosa [\(6](#page-15-3)), along with an increased risk of bacterial invasion from the bowel ([12\)](#page-15-9).

The sum of these observations indicates that the normal antimicrobial defenses in the bowel are sustained by enteral tube feedings, but not by parenteral nutrition regimens. In this sense, the delivery of enteral tube feedings can be viewed as an infection control measure. This is verified by clinical studies showing *a lower infection rate associated with early institution of enteral tube feedings* (i.e., within 48 hours of admission) ([4\)](#page-15-10).

### **Who and When**

The enteral route is always preferred to the intravenous route for nutrition support, and when oral food intake is not possible, *enteral tube feedings should be started within 48 hours of admission* ([1–](#page-15-1)[4\)](#page-15-10), unless there is a contraindication to enteral nutrition (see next). *The presence of bowel sounds is not required to initiate enteral tube feedings* ([13\)](#page-15-11).

#### *Contraindications*

The contraindications to enteral tube feedings are listed in [Table](#page-1-0) 49.1. One concern that receives the most attention is the wisdom of enteral tube feedings in patients with circulatory shock who require a vasoconstrictor drug (a vasopressor) for blood pressure support. The current consensus about this concern is summarized below.

- 1. Enteral feeding is not advised in uncontrolled or progressive circulatory shock.
- 2. Stable or decreasing vasopressor infusions are not a contraindication to enteral nutrition. However, if the infusion rate of norepinephrine is >0.2 μg/kg/min (>14 μg/min in a 70 kg adult), a reduced caloric intake of 10–15 kcal/kg/day (instead of the usual 25 kcal/kg/day) is recommended for the first 7 days, or until the clinical condition improves [\(14](#page-15-12)).

### <span id="page-1-0"></span>**TABLE 49.1 Contraindications to Enteral Tube Feedings**

- 1. Uncontrolled circulatory shock
- 2. Bowel ischemia (suspected or proven)
- 3. Life-threatening, refractory hypoxemia or hypercapnia
- 4. Active upper GI hemorrhage
- 5. Bowel obstruction
- 6. High-output intestinal fistula
- 7. Abdominal compartment syndrome
- 8. Gastric residual volume >500 mL in 6 hours

### **FEEDING FORMULAS**

There is a multitude of tube feeding formulas (Abbott Laboratories, the leading source of enteral nutrition formulas in the United States, has 92 different products) [\(15](#page-15-13)), but only a small number of formulas are used routinely. The following is a brief description of some characteristic features of feeding formulas. Representative formulas are included in Tables 49.2 and 49.3.

### **Caloric Density**

Feeding formulas are available with caloric densities of 1, 1.2, 1.5, and 2 kcal/mL. Most tube feeding regimens use formulas with a low caloric density (1 or 1.2 kcal/mL), because higher caloric densities have higher osmolalities, which promotes diarrhea. The higher caloric density formulas (1.5 and 2 kcal/mL) are used when fluid restriction is a priority.

<span id="page-2-0"></span>

|               |                                               |  |  |  |  |

|               |                                               |  |  |  |  |
|               |                                               |  |  |  |  |
|               |                                               |  |  |  |  |

#### *Protein Content*

The protein content in standard feeding formulas varies from 35 to 65 g/L. (The daily protein requirement for an ICU patient is about 1.5 g/kg, which is 100 grams/day for a 70 kg adult.) Protein-enriched formulas are often designated by the suffix HN (for "high nitrogen"), and they provide about 20% more protein than the standard formulas (see Twocal HN in [Table](#page-2-0) 49.2).

Most enteral formulas contain intact proteins that are broken down into amino acids in the upper GI tract. These are called *polymeric* formulas. There are also feeding formulas where the protein is already broken down into small peptides (called *semi-elemental* formulas) or individual amino acids (called *elemental* formulas) to facilitate absorption from the bowel. This

also promotes water reabsorption from the bowel, so these formulas can be advantageous in patients with troublesome diarrhea. *Vital 1.0* in [Table](#page-2-0) 49.2 is an elemental formula.

### **Carbohydrate Content**

Carbohydrates (usually polysaccharides) are the major source of calories in feeding formulas, and they provide up to 70% of the total calories.

#### *Fiber*

The term "fiber" refers to polysaccharides from plants that are not digested by humans. There are two types of fiber: fermentable, and nonfermentable.

- 1. *Fermentable fiber* is broken down by gut bacteria to produce short-chain fatty acids (butyrate being the most important) that are the principal fuel source for the cells of the colonic mucosa ([16\)](#page-15-14). These fatty acids also promote the growth of nonpathogenic bowel microbes ([17\)](#page-15-15), which helps to prevent colonization with pathogens. Thus, fermentable fiber promotes the "health" of both the microbiome, and the mucosal barrier in the large bowel.
- 2. *Nonfermentable fiber* is not broken down by gut bacteria, and the undigestible residue creates an osmotic force that draws water into the lumen of the bowel. This increases the water content of stool to facilitate laxation.

The fiber in liquid feeding formulas is a mixture of fermentable and nonfermentable fiber. The feeding formula with the highest fiber content is *Jevity* (see [Table](#page-2-0) 49.2).

### **Lipid Content**

Standard feeding formulas contain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) from vegetable oils. The lipid content of feeding formulas typically provides about 30% of the total calories.

### *Omega-3 Fatty Acids*

PUFAs from vegetable oils can serve as precursors for inflammatory mediators (eicosanoids) that are capable of promoting inflammatory cell injury. This concern has prompted the introduction of feeding formulas that contain PUFAs from fish oils (omega-3 fatty acids), which do not promote inflammation. Some of these feeding formulas are shown in [Table](#page-3-0) 49.3. The use of feeding formulas that influence the inflammatory response is known as *immunonutrition* [\(14](#page-15-12)).

<span id="page-3-0"></span>**TABLE 49.3 Immune-Modulating Feeding Formulas**

| Feeding<br>Formula | Calories<br>(kcal/mL) | ω-3 FAs<br>(g/L) | Arginine<br>(g/L) | Antioxidants                  |
|--------------------|-----------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| Impact             | 1.0                   | 1.7              | 13                | Selenium,<br>β-carotene       |
| Optimental         | 1.0                   | 2.3              | 6                 | Vitamins C & E,<br>β-carotene |
| Охера              | 1.5                   | 4.6              | 0                 | Vitamins C & E,<br>β-carotene |

Fish oil-enriched feeding formulas should not be used routinely ([3\)](#page-15-16), but there is some evidence of benefit when they are used in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (18). Other conditions that might benefit from immunonutrition are major trauma, and major abdominal surgery (19).

### **Conditionally Essential Nutrients**

Non-essential nutrients can become essential (i.e., require exogenous support) in conditions of increased utilization. Two of these *conditionally essential* nutrients deserve mention.

#### *Arginine*

Arginine is a preferred metabolic substrate for injured muscle, and it is also a precursor of nitric oxide (which has a pivotal role in maintenance of peripheral blood flow) (20). Arginine can become depleted in conditions like multisystem trauma, due to increased utilization in skeletal muscle (20). At least 8 enteral feeding formulas contain arginine in concentrations of 8–19 g/L (two of these formulas are included in [Table](#page-3-0) 49.3), although the optimal dose of arginine is not known. Arginine-enriched feedings have a documented benefit (i.e., reduced risk of infection) in the perioperative period for major surgery (21).

**RECOMMENDATION:** Clinical practice guidelines state that arginine-enriched feedings are a "consideration" in patients with traumatic brain injury, and in perioperative patients in the surgical ICU [\(2](#page-15-17)). They should not be used in medical ICU patients, especially those with severe sepsis (because of the risk of hypotension from arginine-initiated production of nitric oxide).

#### *Glutamine*

Glutamine is the most abundant free amino acid in the body, and has several functions that have survival value (22). It is a precursor for glutathione, the major intracellular antioxidant, and is essential for nucleic acid synthesis, and for the production of select neurotransmitters (e.g., gamma aminobutyric acid). Glutamine is also an oxidative fuel for cells with a rapid turnover, like the bowel mucosa. Glutamine stores are rapidly depleted in conditions that promote protein catabolism (e.g., sepsis, major trauma, burn injury), and glutamine depletion has a negative impact on outcomes (23).

Glutamine is contained in the proteins provided by tube feeding formulas, but additional

glutamine is recommended in the following conditions ([3\)](#page-15-16)

- 1. For critically ill trauma patients, additional glutamine doses of 0.2–0.3 g/kg/day should be added to the tube feedings for the first 5 days of enteral nutrition.
- 2. For patients with burns over more that 20% of the body surface area, additional glutamine doses of 0.3–0.5 g/kg/day should be added to the tube feedings for the first 10–15 days of enteral nutrition.

Glutamine supplementation is not recommended in other conditions.

#### *Carnitine*

Carnitine is necessary for the transport of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria for fatty acid oxidation (24). Carnitine deficiency can be the result of a genetic disorder, malnutrition, hypercatabolic states, and liver failure, and manifestations include hypoglycemia, and a cardiomyopathy (25). A deficiency state is suggested by plasma carnitine levels below 20 mmol/L.

The recommended daily dose of carnitine is 20–30 mg/kg in adults (26). Feeding formulas that provide supplemental carnitine include *Glucerna, Isocal HN, Jevity, and Peptamen*.

### **Overabundance of Feeding Formulas**

Despite the multitude of feeding formulas, there is little evidence that one formula, or one type of formula, produces better outcomes than the others. As a result, there is a limited number of formulas available in each hospital, and you will probably use the same 1 or 2 formulas for most of your patients.

## **CREATING A FEEDING REGIMEN**

This section describes a simple method for creating an enteral feeding regimen. This method is summarized in [Table](#page-5-0) 49.4, and proceeds in four steps.

<span id="page-5-0"></span>**TABLE 49.4 Creating an Enteral Feeding Regimen**

#### Step 1a. Determine the resting energy expenditure (REE).

Measure the REE with indirect calorimetry (recommended), or estimate the REE as follows:.

REE (kcal/day) = 
$$25 \times \text{wt (kg)}$$

#### Step 1b. Estimate the daily protein requirement:

Protein (g/day) = 
$$(1.2-1.6) \times \text{wt (kg)}$$

#### Step 2. Select the feeding formula.

If possible, use a feeding formula with a caloric density of 1–1.2 kcal/mL.

#### Step 3. Determine the infusion rate:

a. Feeding volume (mL) 
$$=$$
  $\frac{\text{kcal/day required}}{\text{kcal/mL in feeding formula}}$ 

For continuous infusions:

b. Infusion rate (mL/hr) = 
$$\frac{\text{Feeding volume (ml)}}{24 \text{ (hr)}}$$

### Step 4. Adjust the protein intake, if necessary:

a. Determine the projected daily protein intake:

Protein In (g/day) = Feeding volume (L/day)  $\times$  protein (g/L) in formula

b. If the projected intake is less than desired intake, add powdered protein to the feeding solution to correct the discrepancy

### **Step 1. Determine the daily energy and protein requirements.**

The very first consideration is the patient's daily requirement for calories and protein. The daily calorie requirement, also called the *resting energy expenditure* (REE) should be measured using *indirect calorimetry*, which is described in Chapter 48. However, if this is not available, the REE can be estimated using the following simple relationship:

REE (kcal/d) = 
$$25 \times \text{body weight (kg)}$$
 (49.1)

The actual body weight is used for this determination, although the dry body weight seems more appropriate. If actual body weight exceeds 125% of ideal body weight, then the "adjusted body weight" can be used for the determination (as shown in Equation [48.3]).

The recommended daily protein requirements in critically ill patients is 1.2 to 2.0 grams/kg/day [\(1](#page-15-1)[,2](#page-15-17)). (A median value of 1.6 g/kg/day is appropriate.) When the condition stabilizes, a nitrogen balance can be performed to determine if the protein intake is adequate (as described in Chapter 48). However, this is rarely done while patients are in the ICU.

### **Step 2. Select a feeding formula.**

A standard formula, with 1–1.2 kcal/mL, should be sufficient for most patients. Use formulas with higher caloric densities only if volume restriction is a priority.

### **Step 3. Calculate the desired infusion rate.**

A continuous infusion is recommended for enteral tube feeding (instead of bolus feedings). To determine the desired infusion rate, first calculate the volume of the feeding formula that must be infused to meet the daily caloric requirement, as shown in [Table](#page-5-0) 49.4. The infusion rate (mL/hr) is then the volume to be infused over 24 hours, divided by 24.

#### *Propofol Adjustment*

Propofol is a popular agent for short-term sedation during mechanical ventilation, and is delivered in a lipid emulsion that has a caloric density of 1.1 kcal/mL. The calories provided by propofol infusions should be subtracted from the estimated or measured REE to determine the calories that must be provided by the diet. Since propofol provides 1 kcal/mL, the hourly infusion rate of propofol (mL/hr) is equivalent to the hourly caloric yield (kcal/hr).

### **Step 4. Adjust the protein intake, if necessary.**

The final step in the process is determining if the feeding regimen you just created will satisfy the daily protein requirement (from Step 1b). The projected protein intake is simply the daily feeding volume multiplied by the protein concentration in the feeding formula. If the projected protein intake is less than required, powdered protein can be added to the tube feedings to correct the discrepancy.

### **The Initial Period**

The most recent guidelines recommend that *nutrition support should begin at REE levels that are less than the measured or estimated REE* [\(1](#page-15-1)[,3](#page-15-16)). This recommendation is based on the discovery that endogenous nutritional adjustments (e.g., gluconeogenesis) are operative in the early stages of acute illness, and adding full nutrition support to these adjustments results in overfeeding (27). In patients who are malnourished at the outset, aggressive early nutrition also increases the risk of the refeeding syndrome (28).

The following recommendations are from the European guidelines for nutrition support ([3\)](#page-15-16):

1. If indirect calorimetry is used to measure REE, then no more than 70% of the REE should be

provided for the first 3 days of nutrition support. Thereafter, the REE can be gradually increased to 100% over the remainder of the first week.

2. If predictive equations are used to estimate REE, then no more than 70% of the REE should be provided for the first 7 days of nutrition support.

### **FEEDING TUBES**

Liquid feeding formulas are delivered into the stomach or duodenum using narrow-bore, flexible nasogastric (NG) tubes like the one shown in [Figure](#page-8-0) 49.1. These tubes are typically 8–10 French in diameter, and 20–40 inches (50–100 cm) in length. They are made of polyurethane, and are much more flexible than the polyvinylchloride NG tubes that are used to decompress the stomach. Because of their flexibility, a guidewire or stylet is necessary for placement.

<span id="page-8-0"></span>![](_page_8_Picture_4.jpeg)

**FIGURE 49.1** A narrow-bore, flexible feeding tube with a stylet to facilitate tube placement.

### **Feeding Tube Placement**

Feeding into the stomach is recommended, unless there is evidence of regurgitation and aspiration of feeding formula into the lungs (see later). The distance required to reach the stomach can be estimated by measuring the distance from the tip of the nose to the earlobe and then to the xiphoid process. This "NEX" distance is typically 50–60 cm (29).

The major complication of feeding tube insertion is advancement of the tube into the lungs, which occurs in about 1% of insertions (30). Although a relatively uncommon occurrence, misplaced feeding tubes are a significant source of morbidity and even mortality, especially if there is a delay in detection (31). The problem is that critically ill patients often do not cough or show any signs of distress when a feeding tube enters the lungs (which is especially the case in intubated patients who are heavily sedated), so a portable chest x-ray is required after every insertion to determine if the tube is properly placed. *Feedings should not commence until proper tube placement has been verified*.

#### *Chest Radiography*

The appearance of a properly placed feeding tube on a portable chest x-ray is shown in Figure 49.2 (31). The tube runs a straight course down the [mediastinum,](#page-10-0) and bisects the angle created by the tracheal bifurcation. This is evidence that the tube is in the esophagus, and not in the lungs. Placement in the stomach is likely if the tip of the tube is below the dome of the left hemidiaphragm. The optimal tip position is about 10 cm below the dome of the hemidiaphragm (32), which is far enough from the gastroesophageal junction to reduce the risk of reflux into the esophagus.

#### *The Whoosh Test*

One of the traditional practices for evaluating tube placement is to push air through the feeding tube and listen for a "whoosh" of air with the stethoscope placed in the epigastric region. This is taken as evidence that the tube is in the stomach, but this is not necessarily the case. In fact, the presence of a whoosh sound does not confirm tube placement in the stomach because a jet of air in the lungs can be heard in the epigastrium (32–34). Despite its popularity, *this test can be misleading, and should be abandoned*.

<span id="page-10-0"></span>![](_page_10_Figure_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 49.2** Portable chest x-ray showing the proper placement of a nasogastric feeding tube. Feedings should not commence until proper placement of the tube is verified radiographically. Image from Reference 31.

#### *Ultrasound*

Ultrasound imaging has a sensitivity of 96%, and a specificity of 91%, for confirming the placement of feeding tubes in the stomach (35). However, there is uncertainty about the utility of ultrasound for detecting misplaced feeding tubes, and as a result, ultrasound has not replaced chest radiography for evaluating feeding tube placement.

### **Misplaced Feeding Tubes**

As mentioned earlier, entry of a feeding tube into the airways is usually a covert event, and becomes evident only when the post-procedural chest x-ray looks like the one in [Figure](#page-11-0) 49.3 (36). Note that the tube veers to the right at about the level of the tracheal bifurcation (because it

is following the course of the right mainstem bronchus), in contrast to the straight course of the feeding tube in [Figure](#page-10-0) 49.2. Because they are narrow-bore tubes that are advanced with a rigid stylet, feeding tubes can be advanced far into the lungs, and can break through into the pleural space to produce a pneumothorax (37).

### *End-Tidal CO<sup>2</sup>*

Early detection of feeding tubes entering the lungs is possible by monitoring the CO<sup>2</sup> in the infusion port of the feeding tube as it is being advanced. The appearance of a CO<sup>2</sup> waveform, or an increase in PCO<sup>2</sup> to 15 mm Hg, is evidence that the feeding tube has entered the lungs (38). The pooled results of 16 studies has shown that end-tidal CO<sup>2</sup> monitoring has a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 99% for the detection of feeding tube misplacement in the lungs (39).

<span id="page-11-0"></span>![](_page_11_Picture_3.jpeg)

**FIGURE 49.3** Portable chest x-ray showing a feeding tube in the right lung. Image from Reference 36, digitally retouched.

End-tidal CO<sup>2</sup> monitoring has one limitation that prevents it from replacing chest radiography: i.e., it does not detect feeding tube misplacement in the esophagus (e.g., from

coiling). However, the early detection of feeding tube entry into the trachea can help to prevent lung injury, and pneumothoraces.

#### *Gastric vs Duodenal Placement*

The consensus recommendation is to infuse the liquid feeding formulas into the stomach rather the proximal duodenum. This recommendation is based on studies showing that *there is no difference in the risk of aspiration with gastric versus duodenal feedings* (40,41), and gastric feedings are much easier to deliver. However, duodenal feeding is a consideration in patients with problematic regurgitation and aspiration of gastric feedings.

### **COMPLICATIONS OF ENTERAL NUTRITION**

The most cited complications of enteral tube feeding include (*a*) occlusion of the feeding tubes, (*b*) regurgitation and aspiration of the feeding formula, (*c*) diarrhea, and (*d*) inadequate nutrition support from frequent interruptions of the tube feeding.

### **Tube Occlusion**

Narrow bore feeding tubes can become occluded by protein precipitates that form when acidic gastric secretions reflux into the feeding tubes (42). Standard preventive measures include flushing the feeding tubes with 30 mL of water every 4 hours, and using a 10 mL water flush after medications are instilled.

#### *Restoring Patency*

If flow through the feeding tube is sluggish, flushing the tube with warm water can restore flow in 30% of cases (42). If this is ineffective, *pancreatic enzyme* (Viokase) can be used as follows (43):

Regimen: Dissolve 1 tablet of Viokase and 1 tablet of sodium carbonate (324 mg) in 5 mL of water. Inject this mixture into the feeding tube and clamp for 5 minutes. Follow with a warm water flush. This should relieve the obstruction in about 75% of cases (43). If the feeding tube is completely occluded, attempt to pass a flexible wire through the tube to clear the obstruction. If this is unsuccessful, replace the feeding tube without delay.

### **Regurgitation/Aspiration**

The most feared complication of tube feedings is regurgitation and aspiration of the liquid feedings into the lungs. Microaspiration occurs in almost half of critically ill patients (44), and there is usually no observable feeding solution in the airways. The heightened risk of regurgitation/aspiration is the result of impaired gastric motility and reduced or absent lower esophageal sphincter tone (45,46). Monitoring gastric residual volumes has been used to determine the risk of regurgitation/aspiration, but with limited success.

#### *Gastric Residual Volume*

The traditional practice has been to monitor the gastric residual volume (GRV) routinely (e.g., at least once per shift), and interrupt enteral feeding if the GRV exceeds a threshold volume. (This

volume varies from hospital to hospital, but is usually 150–250 mL.) However, there is no convincing evidence that this practice reduces the risk of aspiration, or otherwise influences outcomes (46), but it does result in frequent interruptions of enteral nutrition, and is a common cause of inadequate nutrition support ([2\)](#page-15-17).

**RECOMMENDATIONS:** The consensus recommendations regarding the GRV are as follows [\(2](#page-15-17)[,3](#page-15-16)):

- 1. Routine monitoring of GRV is not necessary, but if it is measured (e.g., when aspiration is suspected), a GRV >500 mL in 6 hours is reason to temporarily interrupt the tube feeding.
- 2. If tube feeding is interrupted, the head of the bed should be elevated to at least 30° above horizontal, and a trial or prokinetic therapy is warranted.
- 3. If the problem persists when tube feedings are reinstituted, the feeding site should be advanced (i.e., from stomach to duodenum, or from duodenum to jejunum).

#### *Prokinetic Therapy*

The prokinetic agents and recommended dosing regimens are shown in [Table](#page-13-0) 49.5. Prokinetic therapy can produce short-term improvement in indices of gastric motility, but the clinical significance of these effects has been difficult to demonstrate (47). The following information deserves emphasis.

- 1. *Erythromycin* promotes gastric emptying by stimulating motilin receptors in the GI tract (48). It is the most effective prokinetic agent (49), and *is recommended as first-line therapy for gastric dysmotility* ([3\)](#page-15-16). The effectiveness of erythromycin wanes over a few days, so no more than 3 days of therapy is recommended. There is no evidence that 3 days of erythromycin has any influence on the resident microbiota.
- 2. Metoclopramide promotes gastric emptying by antagonizing the actions of dopamine in the GI tract. It is less effective than erythromycin (49), and is more effective when given in combination with erythromycin (50). Its effectiveness wanes after a few days, and only three days of treatment is recommended ([3\)](#page-15-16).
- 3. Combined therapy with erythromycin and metoclopramide is more effective than treatment with either drug alone (50). However, both drugs prolong the QT interval, and this must be

considered when deciding about combination therapy.

4. For gastric dysmotility related to opiates, direct intragastric administration of the opioid antagonist *naloxone* can selectively block opioid receptors in the bowel and promote gastric emptying without antagonizing the analgesic effects of the opiate (51). The clinical experience with oral naloxone is limited.

### **Diarrhea**

Diarrhea is reported in as many as 70% of patients receiving enteral tube feedings (52). The liquid feeding formulas can play a role because they are often [hyperosmotic](#page-2-0) to plasma (see Table 49.2), and thus can pull water into the bowel lumen and promote a watery diarrhea. Other sources of diarrhea are unrelated to the feeding formula, and include antibiotics, *Clostridium difficile* infection, and liquid drug preparations.

#### *Liquid Drug Preparations*

Liquid preparations are favored for drug delivery through narrow-bore feeding tubes because there is less risk of obstruction. However, liquid preparations have two features that create a risk for diarrhea: i.e., they can be extremely hyperosmolar (≥3,000 mosm/kg H2O), and they often contain sorbitol (to improve palatability), a well-known laxative that draws water into the bowel lumen (53). [Table](#page-14-0) 49.6 includes a list of diarrhea-prone liquid preparations that might be used in ICU patients.

#### *Management*

The management of diarrhea in the ICU can be challenging because of the multiple potential sources. Tube feeding-related management could include the following: (*a*) choose a feeding formula with a lower osmolality, if possible, (*b*) use an elemental formula that has predigested proteins and lipids, which are easier to move into the bloodstream, and (*c*) avoid the liquid drug preparations in [Table](#page-14-0) 49.6, if possible. Although a fermentable fiber might help (by promoting the health of the mucosa), the fiber-containing feeding formulas are a mixture of fermentable and nonfermentable fiber, which provides no advantage in relieving diarrhea.

### **A FINAL WORD**

#### **Eating as an Antimicrobial Defense Mechanism**

One of the fundamental tenets in critical care is the primacy of the bowel as a source of sepsis, systemic inflammation, and inflammatory organ injury (see Chapter 4). The principal defender in the bowel is the barrier function of the bowel mucosa, which prevents the hordes of enteric pathogens from gaining entry into the body. (Remember that the alimentary canal is outside the body, like the hole in a donut.) And what keeps this mucosal barrier functional is the presence of bulk nutrients in the bowel lumen. The trophic effect of bulk nutrients on the bowel mucosa means that enteral nutrition has a nonnutritive role in protecting against microbial invasion. Stated another way, *eating can be viewed as an antimicrobial defense mechanism*. Interesting concept.
