# **Lactic Acidosis and Ketoacidosis**

*Fundamental progress has to do with the reinterpretation of basic ideas.*

Alfred North Whitehead (*[a](#page-13-0)*)

This chapter focuses on the two most prominent acid-base disorders you will encounter in the ICU: lactic acidosis and ketoacidosis. However, as you will learn, the problem with these disorders has little to do with the acid-base disturbances they promote. Also covered in this chapter is alkali therapy with bicarbonate, and the reasons to avoid it.

## **LACTIC ACIDOSIS**

Lactate is a three-carbon anion that is formed by the chemical reduction of pyruvate in the cytoplasm, in a reaction catalyzed by the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme. About 1,500 mmoles of lactate are produced daily under aerobic conditions (1,2), and the principal sites of production are skeletal muscle (25%), skin (25%), red blood cells (20%), brain (20%), and intestine (10%). Activated neutrophils are an additional source of lactate in inflammatory conditions (3). The concentration of lactate in plasma is usually ≤2 mmol/L, with a lactate:pyruvate ratio of 10:1 (1,2). Lactate is cleared from plasma by the liver (60%), kidneys (30%) and heart (10%).

## **The Evolving Lactate Paradigm**

The traditional teaching has been that anaerobic conditions are the principle source of increased lactate production. However, the description of lactate metabolism in Chapter 9 introduces the following notions:

- 1. Lactate production is NOT driven by anaerobic metabolism (see Table 9.5).
- 2. Lactate serves as an oxidative fuel in conditions of metabolic stress, with a caloric yield that is equivalent to glucose (see Table 9.6).

During conditions of metabolic stress, when glucose availability is limited, lactate can

provide 60% of the energy needs of the myocardium (4), and 30% of the energy needs of the brain (5). During exercise, about three-quarters of the lactate produced is used as an oxidative fuel, and in exercising muscle, there is an intercellular lactate shuttle that transfers lactate from white "glycolytic" muscle fibers to red "oxidative" muscle fibers (6). (Please review the material in Chapter 9 for a more detailed description of these issues.) Another misconception about lactate production that has been known for years, but is rarely mentioned, is described next.

#### *Lactate is Not an Acid*

The traditional teaching has been that lactic acid is the end-product of glucose metabolism in the cytoplasm (glycolysis), but there are a number of problems with this scenario, as indicated by the numbers in [Figure](#page-2-0) 32.1 (7,8).

- 1. The end-product of glycolysis is the lactate anion, which is not an acid.
- 2. The chemical reaction that produces lactate actually *consumes* hydrogen ions, which should have the opposite effect to the production of an acid.
- 3. The hydrogen ions associated with lactate production are attributed to the hydrolysis of the 2 ATP molecules formed during glycolysis (8), but how this influences extracellular pH is unclear.

Each of these points is contrary to the traditional explanation for lactic acidosis, and an alternative explanation is warranted. The fact that hyperlactatemia can exist without an associated acidosis (9) is further evidence of the incomplete understanding of the relationship between lactate production and acidosis.

## **Prognostic Value**

Regardless of its origins or function, plasma lactate levels have prognostic significance in critically ill patients: i.e.,

- 1. The initial lactate level has a direct relationship with mortality rates, as shown in the left-hand graph in Figure 9.4 (10,11).
- 2. The time required for lactate levels to return to normal (lactate clearance) has greater predictive value than the initial lactate level. Normalization of lactate levels within 24 hours is associated with the lowest mortality rates (see the graph on the right in Figure 9.4) (11).

## **Causes of Hyperlactatemia**

There are numerous causes of elevated plasma lactate levels, and the major ones are listed in [Table](#page-2-1) 32.1.

#### *Clinical Shock Syndromes*

The most notable, and most feared sources of hyperlactatemia are the *clinical shock syndromes;* i.e., hypovolemic, cardiogenic, and septic shock.

**SEPTIC SHOCK:** Sepsis or septic shock may be the most common cause of lactic acidosis in critically ill patients. The source of elevated lactate levels is a combination of increased production of pyruvate (12) and a defect in O<sup>2</sup> utilization in mitochondria (called c*ytopathic hypoxia*) (13), which may be caused by inhibition of the pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme responsible for pyruvate entry into mitochondria (see [Figure](#page-2-0) 32.1) (14,15). Tissue oxygenation is not impaired, and can actually be increased (see Figure 17.3).

#### *Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome*

Systemic inflammation (fever, leukocytosis, etc.) can be accompanied by mild elevations of blood lactate (2 to 5 mEq/L) with a normal lactate:pyruvate ratio and a normal plasma pH. This condition is called *stress hyperlactatemia*, and is the result of an increase in the production of pyruvate without a defect in tissue oxygenation or oxygen utilization (13). The lactate elevation in severe sepsis and septic shock is usually associated with increased lactate:pyruvate ratios and a decrease in plasma pH.

#### *Thiamine Deficiency*

The manifestations of thiamine deficiency include high-output heart failure (wet beriberi), Wernicke's encephalopathy, peripheral neuropathy (dry beriberi), and lactic acidosis. The lactic acidosis can be severe (16), and is caused by a deficiency in thiamine pyrophosphate, which serves as a co-factor for pyruvate dehydrogenase (see [Figure](#page-2-0) 32.1). Thiamine deficiency may be more common than suspected in critically ill patients, and should be considered in all cases of unexplained lactic acidosis. (See Chapter 48 for a more detailed description of thiamine deficiency.)

#### *Pharmaceutical Agents*

More than 300 medications have been implicated as a cause of elevated plasma lactate levels (17), and the common ones are listed in the right-hand column of [Table](#page-2-1) 32.1.

**EPINEPHRINE:** Hyperlactatemia is a consequence of high-dose therapy with epinephrine and albuterol (17). Both act by increasing the rate of glycolysis, and produce hyperlactatemia that is aerobic in origin. The albuterol effect may explain reports of lactic acidosis in cases of acute asthma.

**METFORMIN:** Metformin is an oral hypoglycemic agent that can precipitate lactic acidosis during therapeutic dosing. The mechanism for the lactic acidosis is unclear, but it occurs primarily in patients with renal insufficiency, and has a mortality rate of 17–30% (18,19). Plasma metformin levels are not routinely available, and the diagnosis is based on excluding other causes of lactic acidosis. The preferred treatment is hemodialysis rather than alkali therapy (18,19).

**ANTIRETROVIRAL AGENTS:** Hyperlactatemia is reported in 8–18% of patients receiving antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection (20). The responsible drugs are the nucleoside analogues (e.g., didanosine, stavudine), and the presumed mechanism is inhibition of mitochondrial DNA polymerase (21). In most cases, the hyperlactatemia is mild and not associated with acidemia, but lactate levels above 10 mmol/L have a reported mortality rate of 33–57% (21).

**LINEZOLID:** Lactic acidosis is an uncommon but life-threatening complication of therapy with linezolid. The mechanism is unknown, and the reported mortality rate is 25% (22). It is more common in men, and can appear at any time during linezolid therapy.

#### *Non-Pharmaceutical Toxidromes*

Lactic acidosis can be the result of intoxications with cyanide, carbon monoxide, and propylene glycol. Cyanide and carbon monoxide intoxication are described in Chapter 53, and the following is a brief description of propylene glycol toxicity.

**PROPYLENE GLYCOL:** Propylene glycol is used as a solvent to increase the water solubility of some intravenous drug preparations, most notably lorazepam, diazepam, esmolol, nitroglycerin, and phenytoin. About 55–75% of propylene glycol is metabolized by the liver and the primary metabolite is lactate (both levo and dextro isomers) (23). *Propylene glycol toxicity* (i.e., agitation, coma, seizures, hypotension, and lactic acidosis) *has been reported in 19% to 66%* of *patients receiving high-dose intravenous lorazepam for more than 2 days* (24,25). If suspected, the drug infusion should be stopped and another sedative agent (other than diazepam) should be selected. An assay for propylene glycol in blood is available, but the acceptable range has not been determined.

#### *Lactic Alkalosis*

Severe alkalosis (respiratory or metabolic) can raise blood lactate levels as a result of increased activity of pH-dependent enzymes in the glycolytic pathway (9,26). When liver function is normal, the liver clears the extra lactate generated during alkalosis, and *lactic alkalosis* becomes evident only when the blood pH is 7.6 or higher. However, in patients with impaired liver function, hyperlactatemia can be seen with less severe degrees of alkalemia.

#### *Other Sources*

Other possible causes of hyperlactatemia in ICU patients include *generalized seizures* (from

hypermetabolism) (27), *hepatic insufficiency* (from reduced lactate clearance) (28), *acute asthma* (from enhanced lactate production by albuterol or respiratory muscles) (29), and *hematologic malignancies* (30). Hyperlactatemia that accompanies generalized seizures can be severe (with plasma lactate levels up to 15 mmol/L) but is transient (27).

## **Diagnostic Considerations**

The normal lactate concentration in blood is ≤2 mmol/L, but increases in lactate concentration do not have prognostic value until they reach 4 mmol/L (1). Measurements can be obtained on arterial or venous blood samples. If immediate measurements are unavailable, the blood should be placed on ice to retard lactate production by red blood cells.

The anion gap (described in Chapter 31) should be elevated in lactic acidosis, but there are numerous reports of a normal anion gap in patients with lactic acidosis (31). As a result, *the anion gap should not be used as a screening test for lactic acidosis*.

#### *D-Lactic Acidosis*

The lactate produced by mammalian tissues is a levo isomer (l-lactate), whereas a dextro isomer of lactate (d-lactate) is produced by certain strains of bacteria that can populate the bowel (32). D-lactate generated by bacterial fermentation in the bowel can gain access to the systemic circulation and produce a metabolic acidosis, often combined with a metabolic encephalopathy (33). Most cases of d-lactic acidosis have been reported after extensive small bowel resection or after jejunoileal bypass for morbid obesity (32–34).

**DIAGNOSIS:** D-lactic acidosis can produce an elevated anion gap, but the standard laboratory assay for blood lactate measures only l-lactate. If d-lactic acidosis is suspected, you must specifically request a d-lactate assay.

## **ALKALI THERAPY**

The primary goal of therapy in lactic acidosis is to correct the underlying metabolic abnormality. Alkali therapy aimed at correcting the pH is of questionable value (35). The following is a brief summary of the pertinent issues regarding alkali therapy for lactic acidosis.

#### **Acidosis is Not Harmful**

The principal fear from acidosis is the risk of impaired myocardial contractility (36), but this observation comes from isolated heart preparations. *In the intact organism, acidemia is accompanied by an increase in cardiac output* (37), because acidosis stimulates catecholamine release from the adrenal glands.

#### *Protective Role?*

Acidosis may have a protective role in life-threatening conditions, since extracellular acidosis has been shown to protect energy depleted cells from cell death (38). The protective role of acidosis is the basis for *pickling*, which is the preservation of food in vinegar (acetic acid), which typically has a pH of 4.0.

#### **Bicarbonate is Not an Effective Buffer**

Sodium bicarbonate has limited success in raising the plasma pH in cases of lactic acidosis (39). This can be explained by the titration curve for the carbonic acid bicarbonate buffer system, which is shown in [Figure](#page-6-0) 32.2. The HCO<sup>3</sup> buffer pool is generated by the dissociation of carbonic acid (H2CO<sup>3</sup> ):

$$CO_2 + H_2O \Leftrightarrow H_2CO_3 \Leftrightarrow H^+ + HCO_3^-$$
 (32.1)

The dissociation constant (pK) for carbonic acid (i.e., the pH at which the acid is 50% dissociated) is 6.1, as indicated on the titration curve. Buffers are effective within 1 pH unit on either side of the pK (40), so the effective range of the bicarbonate buffer system is an extracellular pH between 5.1 and 7.1 pH units (indicated by the shaded area on the titration curve). Therefore, *bicarbonate is not an effective buffer in the usual pH range of extracellular fluid*. Bicarbonate is not really a buffer; rather, it is the end-product of CO<sup>2</sup> transport in blood (i.e., the CO<sup>2</sup> added to venous blood enters red blood cells (RBCs), where the carbonic anhydrase enzyme promotes the conversion of CO<sup>2</sup> to H<sup>+</sup> and HCO<sup>3</sup> −. The H+ is buffered by hemoglobin, and the HCO<sup>3</sup> − is transported out of the RBCs and into plasma in exchange for chloride ions).

<span id="page-6-0"></span>![](_page_6_Figure_4.jpeg)

**FIGURE 32.2** The titration curve for the carbonic acid-bicarbonate buffer system. The large, shaded area indicates the effective pH range for the bicarbonate buffer system, which does not coincide with the physiological pH range of extracellular fluid. Adapted from Reference 40.

## **Bicarbonate is Counterproductive**

Bicarbonate infusions generate CO<sup>2</sup> , which enters cells and cerebrospinal fluid and actually *lowers the intracellular pH* and cerebrospinal fluid pH (41,42). In fact, considering that *the PCO<sup>2</sup> is 200 mm Hg in standard bicarbonate solutions*, bicarbonate is really a CO<sup>2</sup> load that

must be removed by the lungs.

*Bicarbonate infusions can also increase blood lactate levels* (42). This effect is attributed to alkalosis-induced increase in lactate production, which is far from desirable for a proposed therapy of lactic acidosis.

## **Recommendation**

Despite the wealth of evidence showing no benefits, and potential harm, from bicarbonate therapy, most (but not all) experts recommend bicarbonate therapy for severe lactic acidosis, when the pH is ≤7.1 and/or the plasma HCO<sup>3</sup> is ≤5 mEq/L) (43,44). It seems more reasonable to include only patients who are hemodynamically unstable (e.g., on vasopressors).

Bicarbonate therapy is probably most helpful in patients with lactic acidosis and renal insufficiency (where part of the problem is loss of HCO<sup>3</sup> ). The HCO<sup>3</sup> deficit can be estimated as follows (42):

$$HCO_3$$
 deficit (mEq) =  $0.6 \times wt$  (kg)  $\times$  (15 – measured  $HCO_3$ ) (32.2)

(where 15 mEq/L is the desired plasma HCO<sup>3</sup> ). Half of this deficit can be replaced, and if this results hemodynamic improvement, bicarbonate therapy can be continued to maintain the plasma HCO<sup>3</sup> at 15 mEq/L. If no improvement or further deterioration occurs, further bicarbonate administration is not warranted. The composition of commonly used bicarbonate solutions is shown in [Table](#page-7-0) 32.2.

<span id="page-7-0"></span>

| TABLE<br>32.2<br>Composition | of<br>Sodium<br>Bicarbonate<br>Solutions |               |  |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------|--|
|                              | 7.5% NaHCO3                              | 8.4% NaHCO3   |  |
| Unit Volume (ampule)         | 50 mL                                    | 50 mL         |  |
| HCO3<br>Concentration        | 0.9 mEq/mL                               | 1 mEq/mL      |  |
| HCO3<br>Content              | 45 mEq/ampule                            | 50 mEq/ampule |  |
| Osmolarity                   | 1,790 mosm/L                             | 2,000 mosm/L  |  |

Sodium bicarbonate is also available as 4.2% and 5% solutions, but these are rarely used.

**EXAMPLE:** For a 70 kg adult with a pH of 7.0 and a plasma HCO<sup>3</sup> of 5 mEq/L, the HCO<sup>3</sup> deficit is 0.6 × 70 × 10 = 420 mEq. One ampule (50 mL) of 8.4% NaHCO<sup>3</sup> contains 50 mEq HCO<sup>3</sup> (1 mEq/mL), so 4 amps of 8.4% NaHCO<sup>3</sup> (200 mEq HCO<sup>3</sup> ) would replace about half of the HCO<sup>3</sup> deficit. Since 8.4% NaHCO<sup>3</sup> is very hypertonic (2,000 mosm/L), it should be mixed with D5W and infused slowly (over hours). The ionized calcium should be monitored during bicarbonate infusions, as raising the pH will decrease the ionized calcium, and this can lead to hemodynamic instability. In ventilator-dependent patients, an increase in minute ventilation will also be needed to eliminate the extra CO<sup>2</sup> produced by the bicarbonate infusion.

## **Ketogenesis**

When carbohydrates are not available for metabolic energy production, there is a breakdown of triglycerides in adipose tissue to generate fatty acids, which are transported to the liver and metabolized to form three ketones; i.e., acetoacetate, β-hydroxybutyrate, and acetone. This is illustrated in [Figure](#page-8-0) 32.3. These ketones are released from the liver and can be used as oxidative fuels by vital organs such as the heart and central nervous system. The oxidative metabolism of ketones yields 4 kcal/g, which is slightly in excess of the energy yield from the oxidative metabolism of glucose (3.7 kcal/g).

<span id="page-8-0"></span>![](_page_8_Picture_3.jpeg)

**FIGURE 32.3** Ketogenesis in the liver, which occurs in response to diminished availability of glucose. Acetone is a ketone, but is not a ketoacid.

#### **Ketoacids in Blood**

The normal concentration of ketones in the blood is negligible (0.1 mmol/L), but blood ketone levels increase tenfold (to 1 mmol/L) after just 3 days of starvation. Acetone is not a ketoacid, but is responsible for the "fruity" odor of breath in patients with ketoacidosis. Acetoacetate (AcAc) and β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) are strong acids, and produce a decrease in plasma pH when their plasma concentrations reach 3 mmol/L (45). The balance of AcAc and β-OHB in blood is determined by the following redox reaction (as shown in [Figure](#page-8-0) 32.3):

AcAc + NADH + H<sup>+</sup> 
$$\leftrightarrow$$
  $\beta$ -OHB + NAD (32.3)

The balance of this reaction normally favors the formation of β-OHB: i.e., in conditions of enhanced ketone production, the β-OHB:AcAc ratio ranges from 3:1 in diabetic ketoacidosis, to as high as 8:1 in alcoholic ketoacidosis. The concentration of ketoacids in the blood in diabetic and alcoholic ketoacidosis is shown in [Figure](#page-9-0) 32.4. Note the preponderance of β-OHB in both conditions.

#### *The Nitroprusside Reaction*

The nitroprusside reaction is a colorimetric method for detecting AcAc and acetone in blood and urine. The test can be performed with tablets (Acetest) or reagent strips (Ketostix, Labstix, Multistix). A detectable reaction requires a minimum AcAc concentration of 3 mmol/L. Because *this reaction does not detect the predominant ketoacid, β-hydroxybutyrate* (45), it is an insensitive method for monitoring the severity of ketoacidosis. This is illustrated in [Figure](#page-9-0) 32.4. In alcoholic ketoacidosis, the total concentration of ketoacids in blood is 13 mmol/L, which represents more than a hundredfold increase over the normal concentration of blood ketones, yet the nitroprusside reaction will be negative because the AcAc concentration is below 3 mmol/L.

<span id="page-9-0"></span>![](_page_9_Figure_3.jpeg)

**FIGURE 32.4** The concentrations of acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate in the blood in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA). The horizontal hatched line represents the minimum concentration of acetoacetate required to produce a positive nitroprusside reaction.

## *β-hydroxybutyrate Testing*

There are now portable "ketone meters" that provide reliable measurements of β-OHB concentrations in fingerstick (capillary) blood in about 10 seconds (46). The American Diabetes Association considers measurements of plasma β-OHB with these meters as the preferred method for monitoring patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (47).

## **DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS**

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) can be seen in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and there is no previous history of diabetes mellitus in up to 37% of cases (48). The most common precipitating factors in DKA are inappropriate insulin dosing and concurrent illness (e.g., infection). The mortality rate in DKA has decreased to ≤1% (49).

## **Clinical Features**

The features of DKA proposed by the American Diabetes Association include a blood glucose >250 mg/dL, plasma HCO<sup>3</sup> <18 mEq/L, plasma pH ≤7.30, an elevated anion gap, and evidence of ketones in blood or urine (47). However, there are exceptions:

- 1. The blood glucose is <250 mg/dL in about 3% of cases of DKA (49). This condition is known as *euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis* (50) and it is most common in patients treated with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, and in pregnancy and starvation.
- 2. Although uncommon, the anion gap can be normal in DKA (51). The renal excretion of ketones is accompanied by an increase in chloride reabsorption in the renal tubules, and the resulting hyperchloremia limits the increase in the anion gap.

Additional features of interest in DKA are as follows:

- 1. Leukocytosis is not a reliable marker of infection in DKA because ketonemia produces a leukocytosis, which is proportional to the concentration of ketones in plasma (47). However, an increase in immature neutrophils (band forms) can be a reliable marker of infection in patients with DKA (52).
- 2. Elevated troponin I levels without evidence of an acute coronary event has been reported in 27% of patients with DKA (53).
- 3. Dehydration is almost universal in DKA, but this may not be reflected in the plasma sodium concentration because hyperglycemia has a dilutional effect on plasma sodium; i.e., the plasma sodium concentration decreases by 2.4 mEq/L for every 100 mg/dL increase in the plasma glucose concentration (54).
- 4. Hyperglycemia also has a dilutional effect on the plasma chloride concentration, so the measured plasma sodium (not the corrected value) should be used to calculate the anion gap (55).

## **Management**

The management of DKA is summarized in [Table](#page-11-0) 32.3.

#### *Volume Resuscitation*

Volume deficits in DKA average 50–100 mL/kg (or 4–8 L for a 175 lb adult) (47). The traditional resuscitation fluid in DKA has been isotonic ("normal") saline, but balanced salt solutions with a lower chloride concentration (e.g., Plasma-Lyte®, or Ringer's lactate) have been shown to hasten resolution of the acidosis in DKA (56,57), and these fluids should be preferred to isotonic saline. In cases of euglycemic ketoacidosis, 5% dextrose should be added to all resuscitation fluids.

Volume resuscitation should begin at a rate of 15–20 mL/kg/hr (or 1 L/hour) for the first few

hours (47). When the patient stabilizes, the infusion rate can be decreased to 250 mL/hr. When the blood glucose falls to 250 mg/dL, change the intravenous fluid to 5% dextrose in 0.45% (half-normal) saline, and decrease the infusion rate to 150–200 mL/hr.

#### *Insulin*

Insulin therapy is started only when the plasma K+ is >3.3 mEq/L (because insulin drives K+ into cells). Regular insulin is given intravenously, starting with a bolus dose of 0.1 units per kilogram body weight and followed with a continuous infusion at 0.1 units/kg/hr. Because *insulin adsorbs to intravenous tubing*, the bolus insulin dose should be injected directly into the vein, and the initial 10 mL of infusate should be run through the IV setup before the insulin drip is started. The blood glucose levels should decrease by about 100 mg/dL per hour (49), and the insulin infusion should be adjusted to achieve this goal. When the blood glucose level falls to 250 mg/dL, the insulin infusion rate should be decreased to 0.05 units/kg/hr. Thereafter, the blood glucose levels should be maintained between 150–200 mg/dL. Achieving euglycemia is not recommended because of the risk of hypoglycemia.

The insulin infusion is continued until the acidosis resolves (i.e., the anion gap normalizes and the plasma HCO<sup>3</sup> is >18 mEq/L). Subcutaneous insulin can then be started, but the insulin infusion should be continued for at least one hour after the first subcutaneous dose. Patients who were insulin-dependent prior to admission can be placed on their usual outpatient regimen. Patients who are new to insulin should receive 0.5–0.8 Units/kg/day: half of this can be given as a long-acting preparation (e.g., glargine), and the remaining half as a short-acting preparation (e.g., lispro) in divided doses, to cover meals (49).

## <span id="page-11-0"></span>**TABLE 32.3 Management of Diabetic Ketoacidosis**

#### *I. Intravenous Fluids*

- 1. Start with a balanced crystalloid fluid (e.g., Ringer's lactate) and infuse at a rate of 15–20 mL/kg/hr (or 1 L/hr) for a few hours.
- 2. When patient stabilizes, decrease rate to 250 mL/hr.
- 3. When blood glucose falls to ≤250 mg/dL, change IV fluid to 5% dextrose in 0.45% saline and reduce rate to 150–200 mL/hr.
- 4. Continue IV fluids until patient can tolerate oral fluids.
- 5. *Note:* In cases of euglycemic ketoacidosis, 5% dextrose should be added to all IV fluids.

#### *II. Insulin*

- 1. Start insulin only if plasma K+ >3.3 mEq/L.
- 2. Use regular insulin -start with a bolus of 0.1 U/kg, and inject directly into vein (insulin adsorbs to IV tubing). Then infuse at 0.1 U/kg/hr (run first 10 mL through IV tubing and discard).
- 3. Adjust rate, if needed, for a decrease in blood glucose of 100 mg/dL/hr.
- 4. When blood glucose falls to ≤250 mg/dL, decrease rate to 0.05 U/kg/hr.
- 5. Continue infusion until anion gap normalizes and plasma HCO<sup>3</sup> >18 mEq/L. Then transition to subQ insulin, but continue infusion for at least 1 hr after first subQ dose.

#### *Potassium*

Potassium depletion is universal in DKA, and the average deficit is 3–5 mEq/kg (58). However, the initial plasma K+ is normal or elevated in 96% of patients with DKA because of the

concurrent acidosis (58). The presence of hypokalemia at presentation of DKA indicates severe potassium depletion.

The recommendations for K+ replacement in DKA are shown in [Table](#page-12-0) 32.4. It is important not to start insulin if the initial plasma K+ is less than 3.3 mEq/L because insulin drives K+ into cells, and this can precipitate life-threatening hypokalemia. Regardless of the initial potassium regimen, the plasma K+ should be checked every 1–2 hours for the first 6 hours.

#### *Phosphate*

Phosphate depletion is also common in DKA, and averages 1–1.5 mmol/kg (58). However, phosphate replacement has no documented benefit in DKA, and is not recommended unless the phosphate level falls to <1 mg/dL (47,48,58). (See Chapter 38 for recommendations on phosphate repletion.)

#### *Bicarbonate*

Bicarbonate therapy has no documented benefit in DKA, and is not recommended as a routine measure (47,48).

## **Monitoring Acid-Base Status**

Normalization of the anion gap is considered evidence that the ketonemia has resolved. The plasma HCO<sup>3</sup> can remain in the acidotic range if isotonic saline is used as the resuscitation fluid, because the high chloride concentration (154 mEq/L) creates a hyperchloremic (normal anion gap) metabolic acidosis that temporarily replaces the high anion gap acidosis from the ketonemia. This resolves when the intravenous infusion is slowed, and should not be a problem if balanced crystalloid fluids are used.

## **ALCOHOLIC KETOACIDOSIS**

Alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) is a complex acid base disorder that occurs in chronic, malnourished alcoholics, and typically appears 1 to 3 days after a period of heavy binge drinking (59,60). Several mechanisms are involved, including reduced nutrient intake (which initiates lipolysis and ketogenesis), hepatic oxidation of ethanol (which generates NADH and enhances βhydroxybutyrate and lactate formation), and dehydration (which impairs ketone excretion in the

urine).

## **Clinical Features**

Patients with AKA appear debilitated, and typically present with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain (59). Electrolyte abnormalities are common, particularly the *hypo's* (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, hypoglycemia). Mixed acid base disorders are common in AKA, with a high anion gap metabolic acidosis from the ketonemia and mild elevations in plasma lactate, along with a metabolic alkalosis from vomiting. Acidemia is usually mild, and some patients are alkalemic (from protracted vomiting) (60).

## **Diagnosis**

The diagnosis of AKA is suggested by the patient history (i.e., a debilitated alcoholic with a recent bout of binge drinking), along with evidence of dehydration, an elevated anion gap, and the presence of ketones in the blood or urine without hyperglycemia. However, *the nitroprusside reaction for detecting ketones can be negative in AKA*, as shown in [Figure](#page-9-0) 32.4. The oxidation of ethanol in the liver generates NADH, and this favors the conversion of acetoacetate to βhydroxybutyrate, which results in a low concentration of acetoacetate in blood and urine. Lactate elevations may be present, but are generally mild, and blood ethanol levels can be negative (59). Patients often present with abdominal pain, and pancreatitis should be ruled out.

## **Management**

The management of AKA is notable for its simplicity; i.e., infusion of dextrose-containing saline solutions is usually all that is required. The glucose infusion is needed to correct the acidosis (59,60), while the infused volume corrects volume loss and promotes the renal clearance of ketones. The ketoacidosis usually resolves within 24 hours. Other electrolyte deficiencies are corrected as needed, and thiamine supplementation is recommended because glucose infusions can deplete marginal thiamine reserves (59). (See Chapter 48 for more on thiamine deficiency and replacement.)

## **A FINAL WORD**

## **Don't Focus on the Acidosis**

There are two points in this chapter that deserve emphasis:

- 1. The problem with lactic acidosis and ketoacidosis is not the acidosis, but the underlying condition causing the problem. As a result, the management of these conditions should focus on correcting the underlying cause, and not correcting the acidosis.
- 2. Bicarbonate is not a buffer in the physiological pH range, but is simply an end-product of CO<sup>2</sup> transport in blood. As such, it is an ineffective (and potentially harmful) alkalinizing agent.
