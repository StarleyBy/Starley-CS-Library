# **Urinary Tract Infections in the ICU**

*Throughout nature, infection without disease is the rule rather than the exception.*

René Dubos (*[a](#page-5-0)*)

Indwelling bladder catheters are commonplace in critically ill patients, and catheter-associated urinary tract infections are cited as the most prevalent nosocomial infections in the United States ([1\)](#page-5-1). However, this claim may be misleading, since there is a tendency to confuse asymptomatic bacteriuria (i.e., *infection without disease*) with catheter-associated infections. This chapter describes the relevant features of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (UTIs), including pathogenesis, prevention, diagnostic criteria, and treatment.

# **PATHOGENESIS**

The presence of an indwelling bladder catheter is associated with a 3–8% incidence of bacteriuria (≥105 colony forming units/mL) *per day* [\(2](#page-5-2)). Bacteria (mostly of bowel origin) form *biofilms* on the inner and outer surface of urethral catheters ([3\)](#page-5-3), and these biofilms can serve as a source of continued microbial colonization in the bladder. However, this is not the full story, because *direct injection of pathogens into the bladder of healthy subjects does not result in an infection* ([4\)](#page-5-4).

## **Bacterial Adherence**

The missing piece of the puzzle is the ability of pathogenic organisms to adhere to the bladder epithelium. The epithelial cells of the bladder are normally coated with commensal (nonpathogenic) organisms, as shown in [Figure](#page-1-0) 42.1 [\(5](#page-5-5)), and this prevents the attachment of pathogenic organisms, which serves as a prelude to urinary tract infections [\(2](#page-5-2)[,3](#page-5-3)). This is the same phenomenon that occurs in colonization of the oral mucosa with pathogenic microbes (see Figure 5.5), which is a prelude to nosocomial pneumonia. The presence of a bladder catheter triggers a localized inflammatory response in the bladder epithelium, with exfoliation of the normal epithelial lining, and this is believed to favor the attachment of urinary pathogens [\(3](#page-5-3)).

### **Microbiology**

A multistate survey of the organisms isolated in catheter-associated UTIs [\(6](#page-5-6)) included (in order of decreasing prevalence) *Escherichia coli* (28% of cases), *Klebsiella pneumoniae* (23%), enterococci (17%), *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* (10%), *Candida* species (5%), staphylococci (3%) and streptococci (3%). A single organism predominates in short-term catheterization (<30 days), while polymicrobial infections are common in long-term catheterization (≥30 days) ([7\)](#page-5-7).

### **Prevention**

The risk of catheter-associated infection is determined primarily by the duration of catheterization. This is demonstrated in the graphs in [Figure](#page-2-0) 42.2, which show that early removal of urethral catheters reduces the risk of both asymptomatic bacteriuria and catheter-associated infections [\(8](#page-5-8)). Removing catheters when they are no longer necessary is the single most effective measure for preventing catheter-associated infections. Other observations about prevention are summarized below.

- 1. Daily cleansing of catheter insertion sites (with antiseptic solutions, antibiotic creams, or soap and water) is not recommended, because this practice can increase the risk of bacteriuria ([2\)](#page-5-2).
- 2. Prophylaxis with systemic antibiotics is not recommended [\(2](#page-5-2)).
- 3. Antimicrobial-impregnated urinary catheters (i.e., with silver alloy) can reduce the incidence of catheter-associated infections, but only if combined with regular replacement of catheters ([9\)](#page-5-9).

# **DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT**

The diagnosis of catheter-associated UTIs (CAUTIs) is based on criteria presented by the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) [\(10](#page-5-10)), which is a division of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that monitors healthcare-associated infections in the United States.

<span id="page-2-0"></span>![](_page_2_Figure_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 42.2** Graphs showing that the early removal of urethral catheters significantly reduces the incidence of both asymptomatic bacteriuria and catheter-associated infection. Data represents the pooled results of 16 clinical trials, from Reference 8.

# **Diagnostic Criteria**

The diagnosis of CAUTI requires all of the following:

- 1. The presence of an indwelling urethral catheter for at least two consecutive days in an inpatient setting, and the catheter is either still in place, or it has been removed the day before the suspected infection.
- 2. The patient should experience at least one of the following:
  - a. Fever (>38° C or 100.4° F)
  - b. Suprapubic tenderness
  - c. Costovertebral pain or tenderness
  - d. Urinary urgency or frequency
  - e. Dysuria
    - *Note:* The last two criteria do not apply to patients with indwelling catheters.
- 3. The urine culture should identify no more than two species of organisms, and at least one species should be a bacterium with a growth of >105 colony-forming units per mL (cfu/mL).

#### *Fever*

The inclusion of fever as a diagnostic criterion for CAUTI is problematic, because there are a multitude of potential causes of fever in ICU patients (see Chapter 44). The nonspecific aspect of fever is demonstrated by a comparison study of patients with and without CAUTI, where the incidence of fever was the same in both groups of patients [\(11](#page-5-11)).

#### *Pyuria*

Pyuria (i.e., >10 white blood cells per high-powered field in centrifuged urine) is not diagnostic of CAUTI, since there are noninfectious inflammatory conditions that can cause pyuria. However, *the absence of pyuria is evidence against the diagnosis of CAUTI* ([2\)](#page-5-2).

#### *Bacteremia*

About 20% of bacteremias in hospitalized patients are the result of CAUTI ([8\)](#page-5-8), but bacteremia is not included as a diagnostic criterion for CAUTI. However, the NHSN has a diagnostic entity called *Asymptomatic Bacteremic Urinary Tract Infection* (ABUTI), which is a patient with or without a urethral catheter that is asymptomatic but has significant bacteriuria (>105 cfu/mL) with an organism that is also growing in blood cultures. In other words, *if the same bacterium is isolated in blood and urine cultures (and growth in the urine culture is >105 cfu/mL) the diagnosis is a UTI, regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms*. This does not apply to *Candida* species, as described later.

#### *Asymptomatic Bacteriuria*

The diagnosis of asymptomatic bacteriuria thus requires the following:

- 1. A urine culture that shows growth of a single bacterium with a colony count >105 cfu/mL.
- 2. Blood cultures that show no growth of the bacterium identified in the urine culture.
- 3. The absence of symptoms related to a UTI.

### **Treatment**

- 1. Antibiotic treatment of patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria is not advised unless the patient is scheduled for a urologic procedure that results in mucosal bleeding ([12\)](#page-5-12).
- 2. Empiric antibiotics are recommended for patients with suspected CAUTI, and should provide coverage for gram-negative aerobic bacilli and enterococci.
  - a. Single agent therapy with *piperacillin-tazobactam* or a carbapenem (e.g., *meropenem*) is suitable [\(13](#page-5-13)).
  - b. Alternative (second-line) agents include *ceftazidime, cefepime*, or a fluoroquinolone (e.g., *levofloxacin*) ([13\)](#page-5-13).
- 3. If the diagnosis of CAUTI is confirmed by urine culture, antibiotic therapy should be tailored to the isolated organism and microbial sensitivities. Catheters that have been in place for longer than two weeks should be replaced or removed if no longer necessary [\(2](#page-5-2)).
- 4. The duration of antibiotic therapy for CAUTI should be 7 days for patients who respond promptly, and 10–14 days otherwise ([2,](#page-5-2)[13\)](#page-5-13).

#### **Candiduria**

The presence of *Candida* species in urine usually represents colonization in patients with indwelling urethral catheters, but candiduria can also be a sign of disseminated candidiasis (i.e., the candiduria being the result, not the cause, of the disseminated candidiasis). In fact, *candiduria may be the only evidence of disseminated disease*, since blood cultures are unrevealing in more than 50% of cases of disseminated candidiasis [\(14](#page-5-14)).

#### *Microbiology*

In cases of candiduria, the colony count has no predictive value for identifying renal or disseminated candidiasis ([14\)](#page-5-14). The most frequent isolate is *C. albicans* (about 50% of cases), followed by *C. glabrata* ([14,](#page-5-14)[15\)](#page-5-15). The latter organism is notable for resistance to the antifungal agent fluconazole.

#### *Asymptomatic Candiduria*

Asymptomatic candiduria does not require treatment unless the patient is neutropenic (and is at risk for disseminated candidiasis) ([15,](#page-5-15)[16\)](#page-5-16); in this case, the recommended prophylaxis is an echinocandin (i.e., *caspofungin, micafungin*, or *anidulafungin*) ([16\)](#page-5-16).

#### *Symptomatic Candiduria*

Candiduria that is associated with fever, suprapubic tenderness, or costovertebral tenderness requires antifungal therapy as well as blood cultures and imaging studies of the kidneys (with ultrasound or computed tomography) to search for renal abscesses or evidence of urinary tract obstruction.

- 1. If systemic candidiasis is suspected, or is verified by positive blood cultures, the recommended treatment is an echinocandin. These agents are preferred to fluconazole because they are active against all *Candida* species.
- 2. The recommended treatment for *Candida* UTIs (cystitis or pyelonephritis) is dependent on the organism [\(16](#page-5-16)).
  - a. For *Candida* species that are sensitive to fluconazole (e.g., *Candida albicans*), the treatment is *oral fluconazole* (200–400 mg daily for 2 weeks) ([17\)](#page-5-17).
  - b. For fluconazole-resistant organisms (i.e., *Candida glabrata* and *Candida krusei*), the recommended treatment is *amphotericin B* (0.3–0.6 mg/kg daily for 1–7 days). The echinocandins are not recommended in this situation because of poor penetration into the urine.
- 3. For *Candida* UTIs associated with fungus balls, surgical intervention is recommended. If nephrostomy tubes are present, irrigation with *amphotericin B* (25–50 mg in 200–500 mL sterile water) is recommended.

# **A FINAL WORD**

# **Bacterial Adherence & Nosocomial Infections**

The unifying feature in nosocomial infections that involve the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urinary tracts is a change in the character of microbes that adhere to epithelial surfaces. In healthy subjects, the epithelial surfaces in the mouth, GI tract, and urinary tract are colonized by harmless microbes, but this changes in patients who are seriously ill, when the epithelial surfaces become populated with pathogenic organisms. This pathogenic colonization then serves as a prelude to nosocomial infections.

The colonization of epithelial surfaces is not a function of microbial density (where the most densely populated organisms take up the space on the epithelial surface), but rather is determined by the ability of bacteria to bind to the epithelial cells. For example, pathogenic *E. coli* (the most common cause of CAUTIs) have specialized appendages called *pili* that can bind to glycoproteins on bladder epithelial cells, and there are small carbohydrate molecules (such as mannose) that can competitively block this binding ([3\)](#page-5-3). Observations like this suggest a novel approach to the prevention of nosocomial infections by preventing the adhesion of pathogenic organisms to epithelial surfaces. This approach is appealing because it does not require prophylactic antibiotics, and thus would limit the emergence of resistant organisms.
