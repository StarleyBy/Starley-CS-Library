# **Hemorrhagic Shock**

*It is a bad sign in acute illnesses when the extremities become cold.*

Hippocrates *Aphorisms,* 400 B.C.

Trauma is the leading cause of death globally in the 25–49 year age group [\(1](#page-14-0)), and the most treatable cause of death in these cases is hemorrhagic shock. The resuscitation of traumatic blood loss presents many challenges (as described in this chapter), and one of these is the design of the circulatory system, which operates with a limited volume and a volume-sensitive stroke pump. This is an energy-efficient design that limits the workload of the heart, but it creates an intolerance to blood loss; e.g., whereas the lungs, liver, and kidneys can lose as much as 75% of their functional mass without a fatal outcome, loss of as little as 30% of the (limited) blood volume can be fatal. This intolerance to blood loss is the dominant concern in the bleeding patient.

This chapter describes the physiology and classification of acute blood loss, and presents the relevant features and strategies involved in the resuscitation of hemorrhagic shock, with an emphasis on life-threatening blood loss from traumatic injuries.

# **ACUTE BLOOD LOSS**

The normal blood volume in adults is estimated at 66 mL/kg (lean body weight) for males, and 60 mL/kg for females [\(2](#page-14-1)). For an adult male with a lean body weight of 75 kg (165 lbs), the estimated blood volume is 66 × 75 = 5 liters, while an adult female with a lean body weight of 60 kg (132 lbs) has an estimated blood volume of 60 × 60 = 3.6 liters.

### **Compensatory Responses**

Acute blood loss triggers the following compensatory responses, which help to mitigate the adverse consequences of the volume loss ([3,](#page-14-2)[4\)](#page-14-3).

1. The decrease in blood pressure promotes the movement of interstitial fluid into the bloodstream. This *transcapillary refill* can add as much as one liter to the plasma volume, but it leaves an interstitial fluid deficit.

- 2. There is a physiological stress response that involves activation of the sympathetic nervous system, which promotes tachycardia and peripheral vasoconstriction, both aimed at preserving tissue perfusion.
- 3. The stress response also stimulates the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland, which counteracts the volume loss by promoting the renal retention of water.
- 4. The decrease in renal perfusion activates the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. Angiotensin promotes widespread vasoconstriction, which helps to support tissue perfusion pressure, while aldosterone promotes renal sodium retention, which provides support for the extracellular volume.

### **Progressive Blood Loss**

Acute blood loss can be described with the following classification system ([5\)](#page-14-4), which is also outined in [Table](#page-1-0) 15.1.

|               |                                                           |  |  |  |
|               |                                                           |  |  |  |
|               |                                                           |  |  |  |
|               |                                                           |  |  |  |

**CLASS I:** Loss of <15% of the blood volume (or <10 mL/kg). The volume loss in this case (which is typically less than one liter) is fully restored by transcapillary refill, so blood volume is maintained, clinical findings are minimal or absent, and volume resuscitation is not necessary ([3\)](#page-14-2).

**CLASS II:** Loss of 15–30% of the blood volume (or 10–20 mL/kg). This represents the compensated phase of hypovolemia, where blood pressure is maintained by systemic vasoconstriction ([4\)](#page-14-3). Urine output may begin to fall, but does not reach the level of oliguria (<0.5 mL/kg/hr). The vasoconstrictor response is most intense in the splanchnic circulation, and splanchnic hypoperfusion can lead to disruption of the intestinal mucosa and invasion of the bloodstream with enteric pathogens ([6\)](#page-14-5).

**CLASS III:** Loss of 31–40% of the blood volume (or 21–30 mL/kg). This marks the onset of decompensated blood loss or *hemorrhagic shock*, where the vasoconstrictor response is no longer able to sustain blood pressure and organ perfusion. The clinical consequences can include supine hypotension, signs of impaired organ perfusion (oliguria, altered mentation, cool extremities) and evidence of anaerobic metabolism (i.e., lactate accumulation in blood).

**CLASS IV:** Loss of >40% of blood volume (or >30 mL/kg). This degree of blood loss results in profound hemorrhagic shock, which may be irreversible. Clinical manifestations include multiorgan failure and severe metabolic (lactic) acidosis. This category includes *massive blood loss*, which is described later in the chapter.

#### *Hemoglobin and Hematocrit*

The use of the hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit (H & H) to evaluate the presence and severity of acute blood loss is both common and inappropriate. Changes in hematocrit show a poor correlation with blood volume deficits and erythrocyte deficits in acute hemorrhage [\(7](#page-14-6)), and the reason for this discrepancy is demonstrated in [Figure](#page-3-0) 15.1. Acute blood loss involves the loss of whole blood, which results in proportional decreases in the volume of plasma and erythrocytes. As a result, acute blood loss results in a decrease in blood volume, but not a decrease in the H & H. The H & H will eventually decline as a result of transcapillary refill, and the compensatory increase in antidiuretic hormone and aldosterone activity mentioned previously, but this effect is not apparent for 8–12 hours, and it can take a few days to become fully established.

The right side of [Figure](#page-3-0) 15.1 shows how the resuscitation fluid influences the hematocrit. Infusion of isotonic saline increases the plasma volume but not the red cell volume, resulting in a dilutional decrease in the hematocrit [\(8](#page-14-7)). On the other hand, resuscitation with whole blood adds to both plasma and red cell volumes proportionally, so there is no change in hematocrit. These examples demonstrate that *in the early hours after acute blood loss, the hemoglobin and hematocrit are reflections of the resuscitation effort* (the type and volume of fluids infused), *and not the extent of blood loss*.

# **RESUSCITATION BASICS**

### **The Catheters**

The determinants of flow through vascular catheters are described in Chapter 1 using the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, which is shown below ([9\)](#page-14-8).

$$Q = \Delta P \times (\pi \, r^4/8 \, \mu L) \tag{15.1}$$

This equation states that the steady or laminar flow (Q) in a rigid tube (catheter) is directly related to the pressure gradient along the tube (∆P = Pin – Pout) and the fourth power of the radius of the tube (r4), and is inversely related to the length of the tube (L) and the viscosity of the fluid (µ). These relationships indicate that *short, large-bore peripheral vein catheters are much better suited for rapid infusions than the longer central venous catheters*. This is demonstrated in [Figure](#page-4-0) 15.2, which shows that for a given gauge size, the gravity-driven flow of water through a 1.2-inch peripheral vein catheter is about 5 times greater than the flow through an 8-inch central venous catheter. Also note that increasing the bore size of a catheter from 18 gauge to 16 gauge results in a two-fold increase in flow rate.

### *Rapid Infusion Catheters*

Very large bore peripheral catheters are available in 7 French and 9 French sizes (equivalent to 13 gauge and 11 gauge sizes, respectively) and are about 2 inches in length. These *rapid infusion catheters* are typically used with pressurized infusion systems (see later), and they can deliver up to one liter per minute ([10\)](#page-14-9).

<span id="page-4-0"></span>![](_page_4_Figure_1.jpeg)

**FIGURE 15.2** The influence of catheter dimensions on the gravity-driven flow of water. Data from [www.emnote.org](http://www.emnote.org) (for peripheral catheters) and [www.teleflex.com](http://www.teleflex.com) (for central venous catheters).

#### *Introducer Catheters*

Large-bore introducer catheters are used as conduits for multilumen catheters (see Figure 8.1), but they can also be used as stand-alone infusion devices. They are available in 8.5 French and 9 French sizes (equivalent to about 11 gauge), and can deliver up to one liter per minute when used with pressurized infusion systems ([10\)](#page-14-9). These catheters are about 10 cm (4 inches) in length, and are inserted into large central veins (which make them less appealing than the rapid infusion catheters). Some introducer catheters have an additional side infusion port (see Figure 8.1), but the flow capacity of this port is only 25% of the flow capacity of the catheter ([11\)](#page-14-10), so it should be bypassed for rapid infusion rates.

### **Resuscitation Fluids**

The different types of resuscitation fluids for acute blood loss are shown in [Table](#page-5-0) 15.2. Each of these fluids (except whole blood) has been described in detail elsewhere in the book, and the following is only a brief summation.

#### *Asanguinous Fluids*

Asanguinous fluids (colloids and crystalloids) are used in the resuscitation of moderate (Class II) blood loss, and in the initial stage of resuscitation for hemorrhagic shock. Colloid fluids are much more effective for promoting the cardiac output (see [Figure](#page-6-0) 15.3), because they expand the plasma volume more than crystalloid fluids, as explained in Chapter 10. However, despite the superiority of colloid fluids for expanding the plasma volume, crystalloid fluids have been the preferred fluid for the resuscitation of acute blood loss (see next).

**CRYSTALLOIDS AND BLOOD LOSS:** The perceived value of crystalloid fluids in hemorrhagic shock can be traced back to experimental studies in the 1960s. Using an animal model of hemorrhagic shock, these studies showed that few animals survived when shed blood, or shed blood plus plasma, was reinfused, but survival markedly improved when a crystalloid fluid (Ringer's lactate) was added to shed blood replacement ([13\)](#page-14-11). These same studies also showed that there was a disproportionate (40%) decrease in the volume of interstitial fluid in hemorrhagic shock, and further, that this volume was restored only when the crystalloid fluid was added to the shed blood replacement. These observations implied that an interstitial fluid deficit was a critical factor in the inability to survive hemorrhagic shock, and the crystalloid fluid resuscitation was needed to correct this deficit (and improve survival).

The consensus view at the present time is that fatal outcomes in hemorrhagic shock are the result of persistent bleeding and an unrelenting coagulopathy (described later in the chapter), and that the aggressive use of crystalloid fluids can aggravate ongoing blood loss by promoting a dilutional decrease in coagulation factors. As a result, the current emphasis is on limiting the use

<span id="page-6-0"></span>of crystalloid fluids in the resuscitation of life-threatening hemorrhage (see "damage control resuscitation" later in the chapter).

**FIGURE 15.3** The influence of a one-hour infusion of selected resuscitation fluids on the cardiac index (CI). The colloid is 10% dextran-40, and the crystalloid is Ringer's lactate. Infusion volumes are roughly equivalent (500 mL), except for the crystalloid (1 liter). Data from Reference 12.

### *Erythrocyte Concentrates*

Erythrocyte concentrates, better known as "packed red blood cells" are produced by centrifugation of donor blood. Each unit has a hematocrit of about 60% and a volume of about 350 mL (see Table 12.3). Packed RBCs do not promote cardiac output (see [Figure](#page-6-0) 15.3) because of their high viscosity, and they are used only to increase the oxygen carrying capacity of blood. (See Chapter 12 for more on packed RBCs.)

#### *Plasma Products*

Plasma is stored at −18° C (–0.4° F), and must be thawed before using. This "fresh frozen plasma" (FFP) is available in aliquots (units) of about 230 mL, and is used as a source of coagulation factors, and as a volume expander in massive transfusion protocols (see later). FFP has two disadvantages: i.e., the time required for thawing can lead to delays in resuscitation, and there is a limited shelf life after thawing, which can lead to wastage. These disadvantages are not shared by *liquid plasma*, which is not frozen, and can be stored at 34°–43° F for up to 26 days. Liquid plasma has proven equivalent in efficacy to FFP while also reducing wastage [\(14](#page-14-12)). (See Chapter 13 for more on plasma transfusions.)

### *Cryoprecipitate*

Cryoprecipitate is a frozen plasma precipitate that is rich in fibrinogen and Factor VIII. It has a

volume of about 10–15 mL, and is used to raise plasma fibrinogen levels (15). Cryoprecipitate has the same disadvantages as FFP: i.e., must be thawed before use, and has a limited shelf life after thawing. Other disadvantages include a variable fibrinogen content, and an increased risk of transmitted infections. These problems are not shared by *fibrinogen concentrates*, which have a consistent fibrinogen content (20 g/L), do not require thawing, and have no risk of transmitted infections (16).

#### *Whole Blood*

Whole blood is considered the ideal replacement fluid for acute blood loss, and it can be stored at 1°–6° C (34°–43° F) for up to 35 days (17). However, whole blood is not readily available, because of the standard practice of separating donor blood into its components, which optimizes its utilization.

Fresh whole blood has been used during the recent military conflicts in the Middle East, which was made possible by the use of "walking blood banks" (i.e., fellow soldiers), and it showed a survival benefit when compared to component therapy (17). As a result of this experience, cold-stored whole blood has been evaluated in a civilian setting, but it has not shown the same survival benefit as it did in the military studies (18,19). However, there is evidence of a survival benefit when whole blood is combined with component therapy (19), and it may be that whole blood will fill the gap when there is a limited supply of blood components.

**LOW-TITER GROUP O BLOOD:** Group O blood is considered universal donor blood, and is used when type-specific blood is not immediately available. However, transfusion reactions have occurred with Group O blood that has exceptionally high titers of anti-A and anti-B antibodies (20). "Low-titer" Group O blood has low levels of anti-A and anti-B antibodies, and is considered a safer alternative to Group O blood. The experience with low-titer Group O blood has been similar to whole blood; i.e., a survival benefit has been demonstrated in military studies, but not in the civilian population (21).

### **Rapid Infusion Systems**

Rapid blood replacement is often necessary in massive hemorrhage, and rapid infusion systems are available that can deliver warmed blood products at rates up to 1 liter per minute (22). These systems use a roller pump to create pressures up to 300 mm Hg to deliver a preselected infusion rate. Heating coils are also used to deliver the infusate at body temperature, which eliminates the risk of hypothermia from infusing room-temperature fluids.

Pressurized infusion systems are especially helpful in transfusing erythrocyte concentrates (packed RBCs), which are highly viscous and do not flow readily. This is demonstrated in Table 15.3, which shows that the [gravity-driven](#page-7-0) infusion of packed RBCs is sluggish, and is improved by dilution with saline (23). However, rates of blood replacement can be 5 L/hr (83 mL/min) or higher in life-threatening hemorrhage, and these rates can only be reached with pressurized infusions. Concerns about hemolysis with rapid infusion systems have not been validated (24).

### **RESUSCITATION STRATEGIES**

There are two fundamental goals in the bleeding patient. The first goal is to support the delivery of oxygen to tissues by promoting cardiac output and maintaining an adequate hemoglobin concentration. The second (and equally important) goal is "source control" to stop the bleeding, as continued bleeding not only depletes resources, it increases the risk of a life-threatening coagulopathy (see later).

<sup>\*</sup> Estimated plasma volumes from Reference 2.

### **Hemorrhage Without Shock**

Blood loss that is accompanied by a decrease in blood pressure or urine output, but without evidence of shock (e.g., plasma lactate is not elevated) can be managed initially with asanguinous fluids. (This is equivalent to Class II blood loss presented earlier.) The resuscitation volume can be estimated as shown in [Table](#page-8-0) 15.4. Note that the volume for crystalloid fluids is 3 times the estimated loss of plasma volume, which is a conservative estimate (since only 20–25% of crystalloid fluids expand the plasma volume).

When the plasma volume is repleted, packed RBCs may be needed to attain a target Hb of 7– 8 g/dL (see Chapter 12), FFP may be needed if the INR is >1.5 (25), and platelet transfusions are indicated if the platelet count falls below 50,000/μL (see Chapter 13). If bleeding continues, then the resuscitation strategy described next should be considered.

### **Hemorrhagic Shock**

The resuscitation of hemorrhagic shock described here follows the principles of "damage control resuscitation" (26), which is typically used for massive blood loss (e.g., infusion of 4 units of RBCs in one hour), but will benefit all cases of life-threatening hemorrhage. The basic tenets of damage control resuscitation include timely source control, permissive hypotension, restricting the infusion of crystalloid fluids, and resuscitation with whole blood, or its equivalent in component therapy.

#### *Permissive Hypotension*

The impetus for permissive hypotension comes from studies of trauma-related hemorrhage, which have shown that aggressive fluid resuscitation can exacerbate bleeding before the hemorrhage is controlled (27). This led to an emphasis on reducing fluid resuscitation to allow blood pressures to remain lower than normal (e.g., systolic BP 80–90 mm Hg or mean BP of 50 mm Hg) until the bleeding is controlled. This strategy has been shown to reduce transfusion requirements and the risk of a dilutional coagulopathy (28,29), but the effect on mortality rates has been inconsistent (27–29). The major issue with this strategy is ensuring that the low blood pressure is not promoting dangerous tissue hypoperfusion, so monitoring plasma lactate levels and markers of organ perfusion, such as urine output, is essential (as it should be in all cases of hemorrhagic shock).

#### *Coagulopathy*

One of the principal fears in the bleeding patient is persistent blood loss, which can be the result of inadequate source control and/or a coagulopathy. The latter process is often the result of acidosis (which inhibits coagulation factors at a pH <7.2), hypothermia (which decreases platelet adherence), or the infusion of asanguinous fluids (which has a dilutional effect on coagulation factors) (30). However trauma victims can have a coagulopathy that is independent of the traditional sources, and this "trauma-induced coagulopathy" (TIC) has a negative impact on outcomes. Studies of combat casualties in the Middle East showed that TIC was present on admission in 40% of the cases, and the presence of TIC created a 6-fold increase in the mortality rate (31).

The major culprit in TIC is activation of protein C as a result of endothelial injury (27). The activated protein C not only deactivates factors V and VIII (which inhibits clot formation), it also triggers fibrinolysis (which promotes clot dissolution, and leads to a consumptive decrease in fibrinogen levels) (30). Platelet dysfunction may also play a role in TIC (32).

#### *Hemostatic Resuscitation*

The basic elements of hemostatic resuscitation are outlined in [Figure](#page-10-0) 15.4 (33). The most important element is the infusion of RBCs, plasma, and platelets in proportions that mimic whole blood replacement. This 1:1:1 replacement strategy can be achieved by infusing one unit of FFP for every unit of packed RBCs, and adding one platelet pack (multidonor or single-donor platelets) for every 5 units of PRBCs and FFP. (Remember that platelet transfusions are equivalent to the platelets from 5–6 donors.) This approach not only optimizes the replacement of clotting elements (coagulation factors and platelets), it also minimizes the risk of a dilutional coagulopathy from the infusion of crystalloid fluids. Infusions should be warmed to body temperature to avoid hypothermia.

<span id="page-10-0"></span>![](_page_10_Figure_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 15.4** The principal components of hemostatic resuscitation. See text for explanation.

**ADJUNCTIVE MEASURES:** Other measures that promote hemostasis include calcium supplementation to maintain an ionized calcium of 1.2–1.3 mmol/L (4.6–6 mg/dL), cryoprecipitate (two units) for a plasma fibrinogen level <100 mg/dL, and empiric treatment for fibrinolysis with tranexamic acid (1 gram IV as a bolus dose, followed by infusion of 1 gram over 8 hours) (33).

**END-POINTS:** The end-points of hemostatic resuscitation include a plasma fibrinogen level >100 mg/dL, an INR <1.5, an activated PTT <1.5 times normal, and a platelet count of ≥100,000/μL (30). However, these conventional measures are not well suited for detecting the hemostatic defects in TIC, and "viscoelastic assays" like *thromboelastography* have proven to be more sensitive methods of monitoring hemostasis in trauma victims (see next).

### **Thromboelastography**

Thromboelastography (TEG) provides information on clot initiation, progression, strength, and lysis from whole blood samples at body temperature. This is accomplished by placing a sample of blood in a cylindrical cup that has a central pin suspended in the sample. The cup is then rotated in an alternating clockwise and counterclockwise direction, and the stationary pin records the torque produced as the blood coagulates and then lyses. (An alternative method known as

*rotational thromboelastometry* or ROTEM, which uses a stationary cup and a rotating pin, is not described here.)

A typical TEG tracing, which is shown in [Figure](#page-11-0) 15.5, is a record of the resistance to oscillations in the sample (used as a measure of clot firmness) over time. The symmetrical curves are produced by the alternating clockwise and counterclockwise rotation of the blood sample. The relevant measures are as follows (34):

- 1. R is the "reaction time", or is the time to initiation of clot formation. The normal R time is 5– 10 minutes, and is prolonged by defects in the coagulation cascade, including those produced by all anticoagulants except warfarin (i.e., the INR is the only reliable measure of warfarin anticoagulation).
- 2. k is the "kinetic time", and is the time from clot initiation to a resistance of 20 mm. The normal k time is 1–3 minutes.
- 3. The α angle represents the early rate of clot formation, and is dependent on fibrin polymerization. A normal α angle is 53–72°.
- 4. MA is the maximum amplitude, and is a measure of clot strength. A normal amplitude is 50– 70 mm, and is a reflection of fibrinogen cross-bridging of platelets.
- 5. LY30 is the percentage of clot lysis that occurs from maximal amplitude (MA) to 30 minutes. This is a measure of fibrinolysis, and the normal range is 2.3–5.7%.

#### *TEG-Guided Therapy*

The TEG measures just described can be used to guide hemostatic therapy as shown in Table 15.5. Clinical studies involving both trauma victims and [postoperative](#page-12-0) patients with lifethreatening hemorrhage (35,36) have shown that hemostatic management guided by TEG improves survival and reduces the use of blood products.

### **Goals of Resuscitation**

The overall goals of resuscitation for hemorrhagic shock are summarized in [Figure](#page-13-0) 15.6. Many of the tissue perfusion and oxygenation goals have been presented elsewhere in the book, while the hemostasis goals have just been described. Unfortunately, achieving these goals does not ensure a satisfactory outcome, as described next.

### **POSTRESUSCITATION INJURY**

An apparent successful resuscitation of hemorrhagic shock can be followed in 48–72 hours by progressive multiorgan failure (37). The earliest manifestation is progressive respiratory dysfunction, which is followed within days by progressive dysfunction of the kidneys, liver, heart, and central nervous system. The mortality rate is determined by the number of organs involved, and averages 50–60% (37).

### **Pathophysiology**

Postresuscitation injury is a form of *reperfusion injury* (38) that is believed to originate in the splanchnic circulation, where reperfusion of ischemic bowel releases proinflammatory cytokines that gain access to the systemic circulation and incite a systemic inflammatory response that is responsible for the multiorgan damage.

Several factors predispose to postresuscitation injury, including the time required to reverse the shock, the volume of crystalloid resuscitation (which promotes bowel edema and predisposes to the abdominal compartment syndrome), and the number of units of RBCs transfused (>6 units in 12 hrs) (38). Infection of bowel origin may be involved if the onset of multiorgan failure is more than 3 days after the resuscitation (38).

### **Management**

There is no specific therapy for postresuscitation injury, and preventive measures such as rapid reversal of the shock state, and limiting the infusion of crystalloid fluids and RBC products (if possible) may be helpful. In late-onset multiorgan failure (onset >72 hrs after resuscitation), recognition and prompt treatment of an underlying sepsis is essential.

## **A FINAL WORD**

### **A Summation**

The resuscitation of hemorrhagic shock should incorporate the following elements (in addition to timely source control):

- 1. Use short, large-bore catheters, and avoid hypothermia by warming infusates to 37° C (e.g., with a rapid infusion system).
- 2. Restrict the use of crystalloid fluids to 1 or 2 liters before using blood products (if possible).
- 3. Replace blood components in a ratio that will mimic whole blood replacement, and consider the adjunctive measures shown in [Figure](#page-10-0) 15.4.
- 4. Consider "permissive hypotension" until the bleeding is controlled. The target BP in this approach is a systolic pressure of 80–90 mm Hg or a mean pressure of 50 mm Hg, which is maintained as long as there is evidence of adequate tissue perfusion (e.g., plasma lactate <2 mmol/L).
- 5. If possible, use thromboelastography (or rotational thromboelastometry) to guide hemostatic management (see [Figure](#page-11-0) 15.5 and [Table](#page-12-0) 15.5).

And if the resuscitation is successful, remember to remain vigilant for the appearance of postresuscitation organ injury and sepsis of bowel origin.
