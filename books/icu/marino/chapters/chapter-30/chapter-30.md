# **Discontinuing Mechanical Ventilation**

*The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.*

Matthew 26:41

Discontinuing mechanical ventilation (popularly known as *weaning* from mechanical ventilation) is often a rapid and uneventful affair, but about one of every three patients experience difficulties in the transition to unassisted breathing [\(1](#page-11-0)). This chapter describes the process of removing patients from mechanical ventilation, and the problems that can arise. The most recent clinical practice guidelines on this process are included in the bibliography at the end of the chapter ([2–](#page-11-1)[4\)](#page-11-2).

# **VENTILATOR STRATEGIES**

Attention to the following issues during mechanical ventilation can facilitate the transition to spontaneous breathing.

### **Patient-Triggered Breaths**

The diaphragm is an involuntary muscle that contracts whenever we take a breath, and this continues as long as there is a central drive to breathe. However, mechanical ventilation can promote diaphragm weakness ([5\)](#page-11-3), and this *ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction* is particularly prominent during controlled ventilation, when the patient is not allowed to initiate a ventilator breath. This is demonstrated in [Figure](#page-1-0) 30.1, which is from an animal study that compared the force of diaphragmatic contractions during spontaneous breathing, and after 3 days of assisted ventilation (where each ventilator breath was initiated by a breathing effort) or controlled ventilation (where there were no breathing efforts) [\(6](#page-11-4)). In this case, controlled ventilation is associated with a significant (~50%) reduction in the force of diaphragmatic contractions at each frequency tested.

Observations like those in [Figure](#page-1-0) 30.1 indicate that allowing patients to trigger ventilator breaths (e.g., by avoiding neuromuscular paralysis or heavy sedation) will help to preserve the strength of the diaphragm, and should facilitate the transition from ventilatory support to spontaneous breathing. (The role of diaphragm weakness in weaning from the ventilator is

described later in the chapter.)

### **Physiotherapy**

Prolonged bed rest and physical inactivity leads to deconditioning and generalized muscle weakness, and this is considered a contributing factor in difficulties weaning from mechanical ventilation. A program of progressive physiotherapy (e.g., sitting on the edge of the bed, standing, and ambulation) has been shown to facilitate weaning from mechanical ventilation ([7\)](#page-11-5), and protocolized physiotherapy is recommended for all ventilator-dependent patients who are otherwise clinically stable [\(2](#page-11-1)).

Data from Reference 6.

### **Sedation Practices**

Deep sedation (where the patient is not arousable) and sustained use of benzodiazepines (especially midazolam) will delay awakening ([8\)](#page-11-6), and this delays the liberation from mechanical ventilation [\(8](#page-11-6)). As a result, the most recent guidelines on sedation in ventilator-dependent patients [\(9](#page-11-7)) includes the following recommendations:

- 1. Maintain a light level of sedation, where patients are easily aroused.
- 2. Consider daily "sedation holidays" to prevent the accumulation of sedative agents.

3. Avoid or minimize the use of benzodiazepines for sedation.

For more on sedation during mechanical ventilation, see Chapter 6.

## **THE SPONTANEOUS BREATHING TRIAL**

### **Readiness**

The management of ventilator-dependent patients requires constant vigilance for signs that the patient is ready for a trial of spontaneous breathing. These "readiness criteria" are listed in the left-hand column in [Table](#page-2-0) 30.1. Suitable candidates should have adequate arterial oxygenation (i.e., SpO<sup>2</sup> ≥90%) while breathing non-toxic concentrations of oxygen (FIO<sup>2</sup> ≤50%) at low levels of PEEP (≤8 cm H2O), and should have an arterial PCO<sup>2</sup> that is normal or at baseline levels. Patients should also be hemodynamically stable and either awake or arousable and cooperative.

<sup>†</sup>Measurements obtained during spontaneous breathing. PBW = predicted body weight.

When the readiness criteria are satisfied and the spontaneous breathing trial begins, the measurements listed in the right hand column of [Table](#page-2-0) 30.1 can help to determine if spontaneous breathing will be successful ([10\)](#page-11-8). Each of these parameters can be a poor predictor of success or failure in individual patients, but when taken together, they will give you a good idea of how things will proceed. Serial changes in these measurements have more predictive value than spot measurements obtained at the onset of the spontaneous breathing trial [\(11](#page-11-9)).

### **Methods**

There are two methods for a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), as described next.

### *Using the Ventilator Circuit*

The popular method of conducting SBTs is to leave the patient connected to the ventilator. The advantage of this method is the ability to monitor the tidal volume (VT) and respiratory rate (RR), since rapid, shallow breathing (indicated by an increase in the RR/V<sup>T</sup> ratio) is a common breathing pattern in patients who fail the SBT [\(9](#page-11-7)).

To counteract the resistance to breathing through the ventilator circuit, low levels of pressure support (5 cm H2O) are routinely employed. (For a description of pressure support ventilation, see Chapter 26, and Figure 26.2.) However, as demonstrated in [Figure](#page-3-0) 30.2, *the use of pressure*

*support does not significantly reduce the work of breathing* ([12\)](#page-11-10), which is consistent with studies showing that the addition of pressure support does not facilitate weaning from mechanical ventilation [\(13](#page-11-11)).

#### *The T-Piece Circuit*

SBTs can also be conducted when the patient is disconnected from the ventilator, using the simple circuit design illustrated in [Figure](#page-4-0) 30.3. A source of O<sup>2</sup> (usually from a wall outlet) is delivered to the patient at a high flow rate (higher than the patient's inspiratory flow rate), and this not only facilitates the inhalation of O<sup>2</sup> , it also carries exhaled CO<sup>2</sup> out to the atmosphere, to prevent CO<sup>2</sup> rebreathing. Because this circuit employs a T-shaped adapter, this type of SBT is popularly known as a "T-piece trial".

The T-piece circuit uses high flow rates, and thus may be better suited for patients with high ventilatory demands (although this is unproven). The major disadvantage of the T-piece circuit is the inability to monitor the respiratory rate and tidal volume.

#### *Which Method is Preferred?*

There is no clinically proven advantage with any method for SBTs [\(13](#page-11-11),14), which means that when a patient is ready to resume spontaneous breathing, it doesn't matter how you do it. Leaving the patient attached to the ventilator during SBTs is favored because it is easier to set up.

**FIGURE 30.3** The T-piece circuit used for spontaneous breathing trials. The  $O_2$  is delivered at high flow rates, which facilitates both  $O_2$  inhalation and  $CO_2$  removal.

#### Success vs. Failure

Success or failure of an SBT is judged by one or more of the following:

- . Signs of respiratory distress: i.e., agitation, diaphoresis, rapid breathing, and use of accessory muscles of respiration.
- . Signs of respiratory muscle weakness: e.g., paradoxical inward movement of the abdominal wall during inspiration.
- . Adequacy of gas exchange in the lungs; e.g., arterial  $O_2$  saturation,  $PaO_2/FiO_2$  ratio, and arterial  $PCO_2$ .
- . Adequacy of systemic perfusion, as assessed by the central venous  ${\rm O}_2$  saturation.

The time allotted for an SBT trial varies from less than 30 minutes to longer than 2 hours, depending on the clinical condition of the patient. A majority of patients (~80%) who tolerate SBTs for 2 hours can be permanently removed from the ventilator (10).

### **Rapid Breathing**

Rapid breathing during SBTs is a common source of concern, but tachypnea may be a sign of anxiety rather than ventilatory failure (15). Monitoring the tidal volume can be useful in distinguishing anxiety from ventilatory failure; i.e., *anxiety produces hyperventilation*, where the respiratory rate and tidal volume are both increased, whereas ventilatory failure usually produces rapid and shallow breathing, where the respiratory rate is increased but the tidal volume is decreased. Therefore, *for the patient who develops rapid respirations during a trial of unassisted breathing, an increased tidal volume suggests anxiety as the underlying problem, while a decreased tidal volume suggests ventilatory failure.* Worsening of gas exchange may not distinguish between anxiety and ventilatory failure for the reasons described next.

#### **Adverse Effects**

Regardless of the cause, rapid breathing during SBTs can be detrimental in several ways, as summarized below.

- 1. In patients with asthma and COPD, rapid breathing promotes hyperinflation and intrinsic PEEP, which can: (*a*) decrease the cardiac output, (*b*) increase dead space ventilation, (*c*) decrease lung compliance, and (*d*) produce diaphragm dysfunction by flattening the diaphragm.
- 2. For patients with infiltrative lung disease (e.g., ARDS), rapid breathing reduces ventilation in diseased lung regions (where time constants for alveolar ventilation are prolonged), and this promotes alveolar collapse and hypoxemia.
- 3. For all patients with acute respiratory failure, rapid breathing can increase whole-body O<sup>2</sup> consumption, which places an added burden on systemic O<sup>2</sup> transport.

#### *Management*

If ventilatory failure is suspected as the cause of rapid breathing, the patient should be placed back on the ventilator. If anxiety is suspected as the culprit, administration of a sedative drug should be considered. *Opiates are particularly effective in curbing the sensation of dyspnea* (16), and should be preferred in this setting. Despite the fear of opiate use in patients with COPD, opiates have been used safely for relief of dyspnea in patients with severe COPD (16).

# **FAILURE OF SPONTANEOUS BREATHING**

A failed trial of spontaneous breathing is usually a sign that the pathologic condition requiring ventilatory support needs further improvement. However, there are other conditions that create difficulties in discontinuing mechanical ventilation, and the principal ones are described next.

### **Cardiac Dysfunction**

Cardiac dysfunction has been identified in 40% of failed weaning trials (17). Potential sources of cardiac dysfunction in this situation include: (*a*) negative intrathoracic pressures, which increase left ventricular afterload (see Figure 26.8), (*b*) occult PEEP, which reduces venous return to the heart, (*c*) a decrease in ventricular distensibility (18) from hyperinflation and occult PEEP, and (*d*) silent myocardial ischemia (19).

The adverse effects of cardiac dysfunction include pulmonary congestion, and a decrease in the contractile strength of the diaphragm (20). The influence of cardiac output on the strength of diaphragmatic contractions is explained by the fact that the diaphragm (like the heart) maximally extracts O<sup>2</sup> under normal conditions, and thus is highly dependent on the cardiac output for its O<sup>2</sup> supply.

#### *Monitoring*

The following approaches can be used to detect cardiac dysfunction in patients who fail repeated attempts at discontinuing mechanical ventilation.

**PULMONARY ARTERY CATHETER:** Although rarely used, the pulmonary artery catheter would be

useful for detecting weaning-induced increases in pulmonary capillary pressure and decreases in cardiac output.

**CARDIAC ULTRASOUND:** Cardiac ultrasound is a useful tool for detecting changes in systolic and diastolic function during failed trials of spontaneous breathing (19,21).

**CENTRAL VENOUS <sup>O</sup><sup>2</sup> SATURATION:** A decrease in cardiac output is accompanied by a compensatory increase in peripheral O<sup>2</sup> extraction and a subsequent decrease in venous O<sup>2</sup> saturation. (See Chapter 9 for a description of the factors that influence venous O<sup>2</sup> saturation.) Therefore, a decrease in central venous O<sup>2</sup> saturation (ScvO<sup>2</sup> ) during a failed SBT could signal the appearance of cardiac dysfunction. The changes in *mixed* venous O<sup>2</sup> saturation (SvO<sup>2</sup> ) during successful and failed trials of spontaneous breathing are shown in [Figure](#page-7-0) 30.4 (22). The SvO<sup>2</sup> decreased during the failed trials but not during the successful trials, suggesting that a decrease in cardiac output may be responsible for the failure to sustain spontaneous breathing. (*Note:* The ScvO<sup>2</sup> will mimic the behavior of the SvO<sup>2</sup> .)

#### *Management*

There is surprisingly little information on methods for correcting the cardiac dysfunction that develops during spontaneous breathing trials, but the following interventions should be considered:

**CPAP:** Patients who develop systolic dysfunction should benefit from continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which promotes cardiac output by canceling the afterload-increasing effect of negative intrathoracic pressure (23,24). Since CPAP is delivered noninvasively, it will not prevent the removal of mechanical ventilation, including extubation.

**DIURESIS:** Patients with systolic dysfunction and an enlarged left ventricle (i.e., an increased left ventricular end-diastolic volume) or weaning-induced pulmonary edema, can benefit from diuresis (21,25). However in the absence of pulmonary edema, the judicious use of diuretics is advised for patients with concomitant right heart failure.

**NITRATES:** For patients who develop cardiac dysfunction associated with hypertension during an SBT, intravenous nitroglycerin (titrated to the desired blood pressure) has proved successful in removing patients from the ventilator (26).

### **Respiratory Muscle Weakness**

Respiratory muscle weakness is always near the top of the list for potential causes of difficulty in removing ventilatory support. The following are some potential sources of respiratory muscle weakness in ventilator-dependent patients.

<span id="page-7-0"></span>![](_page_7_Figure_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 30.4** Mixed venous O<sup>2</sup> saturation (SvO<sup>2</sup> ) during successful and failed trials of spontaneous breathing. Data from Reference 22.

#### *Potential Sources*

**MECHANICAL VENTILATION:** As mentioned earlier (and shown in [Figure](#page-1-0) 30.1), mechanical ventilation can cause diaphragm weakness when patients are not allowed to trigger ventilator breaths.

**CRITICAL ILLNESS NEUROMYOPATHY:** The condition known as *critical illness neuromyopathy* is an inflammatory injury to peripheral nerves and/or skeletal muscle that appears in critically ill patients, and is often recognized only when patients fail to wean from mechanical ventilation (27). This condition is described in more detail in Chapter 46. There is no effective treatment.

**ELECTROLYTE DEPLETION:** Magnesium and phosphorous depletion can promote respiratory muscle weakness (28,29), but the clinical relevance of this effect is unproven. Nevertheless, deficiencies in these electrolytes should be corrected in patients who fail attempts to discontinue mechanical ventilation.

#### *Monitoring*

In the supine position, diaphragm weakness can be detected by inward movement of the abdomen during inspiration, but there are few quantitative measures of diaphragm strength that are clinically applicable. (Measures such as transdiaphragmatic pressure and response to phrenic nerve stimulation are not routinely available, and are not described here.)

**MAXIMUM INSPIRATORY PRESSURE:** The standard clinical measure of respiratory muscle strength is the maximum inspiratory pressure (PImax ), which is the negative pressure that is generated by a maximum inspiratory effort against a closed airway. The normal values of PImax vary widely, but mean values of –120 cm H2O and –84 cm H2O have been reported for adult men and women, respectively (30). Ventilation at rest is threatened when the PImax drops to –20 or –30 cm H2O, which is at the threshold for predicting the success of [spontaneous](#page-2-0) breathing trials (see Table 30.1). Patients with acute respiratory failure often have difficulty performing the maneuver needed to measure PImax , which limits its value is assessing diaphragm weakness in the ICU.

**ULTRASOUND:** Ultrasound measures of diaphragm thickness and diaphragm excursion have been proposed as measures of diaphragm dysfunction in ICU patients (31), but this methodology is limited by the lack of standardized reference measurements and the paucity of sonographers skilled in diaphragm imaging. Furthermore, the impact of this imaging on weaning from the ventilator is unclear.

#### *Management*

The management of respiratory muscle weakness is limited to physiotherapy and general supportive care (nutrition, etc.).

### **EXTUBATION**

Once there is evidence that mechanical ventilation is no longer necessary, the next step is to remove the artificial airway. This section focuses on removing endotracheal tubes, although some of the principles also apply to removing tracheostomy tubes. (The removal of tracheostomy tubes is a more gradual process, and often occurs after patients leave the ICU.) Extubation should never be performed to reduce the work of breathing (in patients who are experiencing some respiratory distress during weaning), because the work of breathing can actually *increase* after extubation, as demonstrated in [Figure](#page-3-0) 30.2. (This can be the result of an increased respiratory rate or breathing through a narrowed glottis, but it occurs in patients who tolerate extubation, so it is not necessarily a cause for concern.)

The considerations that must be addressed prior to extubation include: (*a*) the patient's ability to clear secretions from the airways, and (*b*) the risk of symptomatic laryngeal edema following extubation.

### **Airway Protective Reflexes**

The ability to protect the airway from aspirated secretions is determined by the strength of the gag and cough reflexes. Cough strength can be assessed by holding a piece of paper 1–2 cm from the end of the endotracheal tube and asking the patient to cough. If wetness appears on the paper, the cough strength is considered adequate (32). Diminished strength or even absence of cough or gag reflexes will not necessarily prevent extubation, but will identify patients who at risk of aspiration. These patients deserve special attention aimed at swallowing function postextubation.

### **Laryngeal Edema**

Trauma to the larynx from the insertion and presence of endotracheal tubes can lead to laryngeal edema and upper airway obstruction after extubation. The reported incidence of laryngeal edema that is severe enough to warrant reintubation is 1–10% (33), and contributing factors include difficult and prolonged intubation, large tube size, and unplanned self-extubation.

#### *The Cuff-Leak Test*

The cuff-leak test is designed to determine the risk of upper airway obstruction from laryngeal edema after the endotracheal tube is removed. The test is performed while the patient is receiving ventilator breaths. The cuff on the endotracheal tube is deflated, which normally causes air to leak out of the lungs, and the volume of the air leak can be measured as the difference between the inhaled and exhaled volumes. (This test is best performed during volume-controlled ventilation, where the inflation volume is pre-selected.) The absence of an air leak when the cuff is deflated is then considered evidence of an upper airway obstruction from laryngeal edema.

**PROBLEMS:** The cuff leak test was developed for extubating children with croup (34), and the value of the test in adults has been debated for years. One of the problems is defining a negative test (i.e., evidence that upper airway obstruction is unlikely), since some studies use the presence of an auditory leak as a negative test, while other studies use a specified volume of gas that is leaked (typically 100–110 mL) as a negative test. The other problem has been the limited predictive value of positive and negative tests for identifying troublesome laryngeal edema postextubation (32,35).

**RECOMMENDATION:** The cuff test should be reserved for patients that are high-risk for postextubation laryngeal edema (e.g., those with prolonged or difficult intubations). Based on a recent study in this patient population (35), the following recommendations are reasonable:

- 1. A leak volume >110 mL eliminates the risk of post-extubation laryngeal edema with about 95% certainty, and nothing further is needed prior to extubation.
- 2. A leak volume <110 mL increases the risk of post-extubation laryngeal edema 7-fold, and these patients should receive pretreatment with steroids prior to extubation. They should also be placed on noninvasive ventilation immediately after extubation.

#### *Pretreatment with Steroids*

There is evidence that pretreatment with intravenous corticosteroids reduces the risk of postextubation laryngeal edema (36,37). This is demonstrated in [Figure](#page-10-0) 30.5, which is from a large, multicenter study showing that intravenous methylprednisolone (20 mg every 4 hours, with the first dose given 12 hours prior to a planned extubation) was associated with marked reductions in post-extubation laryngeal edema and in the reintubation rate (36). *Steroid pretreatment must begin hours before the extubation*, since the effect is not present if steroids are administered close to the time of extubation (38).

#### *Noninvasive Ventilation*

Noninvasive ventilation (which is described in Chapter 26) is effective in reducing the rate of

reintubation when used immediately after extubation, in patients with a high risk of laryngeal edema (39). However, similar success has not been demonstrated when post-extubation respiratory failure is established (40). Therefore, noninvasive ventilation should be used immediately after extubation in high-risk patients, and is not recommended once respiratory failure is established.

### **Post-extubation Stridor**

The characteristic sign of upper airway obstruction from laryngeal edema is noisy breathing, also called *stridorous breathing*, or simply *stridor*, which is first apparent when the obstruction reaches about 50% (33). The sounds may be high-pitched and wheezy, or low-pitched and harsh, but they are always audible without a stethoscope, and they are *always most apparent during inspiration*. This inspiratory prominence is due to the extrathoracic location of laryngeal obstruction: i.e., negative intrathoracic pressures generated during a spontaneous inspiration are transmitted to the upper airways outside the thorax, and this results in a narrowing of the extrathoracic airways (including the larynx and pharynx) during the inspiratory phase of breathing. (In contrast, the intrathoracic airways narrow during expiration.)

<span id="page-10-0"></span>![](_page_10_Figure_3.jpeg)

**FIGURE 30.5** Results of a large, multicenter study showing that pretreatment with methylprednisolone (20 mg IV every 4 hrs, starting 12 hours prior to extubation) was associated with a 7-fold drop in the incidence of post-extubation laryngeal edema, and a 50% decline in the reintubation rate. Data from Reference 36.

#### *Management*

Post-extubation stridor is apparent within 30 minutes of extubation in most cases (32), but delays of up to 2 hours can occur (personal observation). Reintubation is not always necessary, but *any signs of impending respiratory failure (O<sup>2</sup> desaturation, rapid breathing) should prompt immediate reintubation*, because delays to reintubation can make it difficult to re-establish a stable airway. Furthermore, *there are no proven treatments for post-extubation laryngeal edema* (33).

Popular but unproven treatments for post-extubation laryngeal edema include nebulized epinephrine and intravenous steroids. Since there is no evidence that either of these interventions is effective, it is not possible to recommend an effective dosage.

## **A FINAL WORD**

### **Avoiding Delays**

One of the most important aspects of discontinuing mechanical ventilation is to avoid unnecessary delays, and the following measures should help in this regard.

- 1. Keep sedation as light as possible.
- 2. Start physiotherapy as soon as the patient is clinically stable.
- 3. Be attentive to the patient's nutritional status.
- 4. Be vigilant for signs that the patient is ready for a spontaneous breathing trial, and extubate the patient in a timely fashion if the trial is successful.
- 5. Don't forget the possible role of the heart in failed trials of spontaneous breathing.
- 6. If concerned about post-extubation laryngeal edema, pretreat with steroids prior to extubation, and extubate the patient to noninvasive positive pressure breathing.

These measures should help to free patients from mechanical ventilation, and end the misfortune of being tethered to a machine.
