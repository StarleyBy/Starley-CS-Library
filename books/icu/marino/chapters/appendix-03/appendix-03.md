# **The Body Fantastic**

*We cannot fathom the marvelous complexity of an organic being.*

Charles Darwin

The real problem in medicine is not the cost or availability of healthcare—it is the task of fixing a machine that has about 100 trillion interconnecting parts (the estimated number of cells in the human body), none of which are visible to the naked eye. The following are some facts and factoids that highlight the complexity of the machine we are tasked to fix. This information has no direct application to the practice of medicine, and is meant only as an homage to the human body.

#### **Our Vascular Superhighway**

If all the blood vessels in the human body were placed end-to-end, they would extend about 100,000 kilometers (62,000 miles) ([1\)](#page-0-0), which is about 2½ times the circumference of Earth.

#### **The Reach of Our Airways**

The combined length of all the airways in the lungs is estimated at 2,500 kilometers (1,553 miles) ([1\)](#page-0-1), which is equivalent to the distance between London and Moscow (1,554 miles).

## **The Ultimate Packing Job**

The human genome is roughly 2 meters in length, yet it is packed into the cell nucleus, which is only 6 microns in diameter. This is analogous to taking a string that runs up and down the length of Manhattan (roughly 14 miles) and packing it in a tennis ball (diameter 2.6 inches).

## **The Complexity of the Human Genome**

The DNA molecule encodes information using the pairing of four nucleotides: adenine, thymine,

cytosine, and guanine. The human genome contains about 3 billion nucleotide pairings, so the total possible sequences of nucleotide pairings is 43,000,000,000. In comparison, the total number of electrons in the universe is estimated at 1080, or 4133 [\(1](#page-1-0)).

#### **The Amazing DNA Polymerase Enzyme**

The human genome contains 3.2 billion nucleotide pairs, yet each replication of DNA is carried out with remarkable accuracy; i.e., a mistake occurs only once for every 10 billion nucleotides copied ([1\)](#page-1-1). The source of this fidelity is the DNA polymerase enzyme, which catalyzes the addition of each nucleotide to the DNA molecule, but checks to see that the nucleotide to be added is the correct one before adding it to the molecule. This means that, for every replication of the DNA molecule, the DNA polymerase enzyme "proofreads" each of the 3.2 billion nucleotide pairs to ensure accuracy of replication. This allows us to reliably transfer genetic information to our offspring.

#### **The Celestial Reach of Our Genome**

If all the DNA strands in the body were placed end-to-end, they would stretch an estimated 10 billion miles ([1\)](#page-1-2), which is almost three times the distance from the Sun to Pluto (3.7 billion miles).

#### **Human Life and an 80-watt Light Bulb**

The daily energy requirement of an adult at rest is about 25 kcal/kg, which is 2,000 kcal for an 80 kg (176 lb) person. This corresponds to a hourly energy requirement of 83 kcal/hr, which is equivalent to 80 watts (1 kcal/hr=1.16 watts). Thus, the energy needed to support human life is about the same as the energy needed to power an 80-watt light bulb.

#### **The Molecular Burden of Staying Alive**

The energy used by the human body to conduct the myriad processes involved in living is derived from the production and breakdown of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The daily production of ATP is estimated at 2 × 1026 molecules per day, which corresponds to a mass of about 80 kg (176 lb) [\(1](#page-1-3)). This is close to the average weight of an adult in North America (177.5 lbs) [\(2](#page-1-4)). This means that, each and every day, the adult human body cycles a molecular mass equivalent to its own body weight in order to stay alive.

#### **Our Erythrocyte Burden**

The number of circulating red blood cells (RBCs) is normally about 5.4 × 1012/L (5.4 trillion/L) in adult males ([1\)](#page-2-0). Assuming a normal blood volume of 5 liters, the total number of circulating

RBCs is 27 trillion. About 1% of circulating RBCs are replaced daily, ([2\)](#page-2-1) which would be 1% of 27 trillion, or 270 billion RBCs replaced daily (which is equivalent to 3.1 million RBCs/sec). Thus, to maintain the pool of circulating RBCs, the human body must manufacture 3.1 million RBCs every second.

#### **The Incomprehensible Heart Beat**

Every heart beat has 6 variables to consider: the part of the cardiac cycle (systole and diastole), the side of the heart (right and left side) and the ventilatory cycle (inhalation and exhalation). Considering that humans can process only 4 independent variables at one time [\(1](#page-2-2)), this means a single heart beat is incomprehensible at any point in time.

#### **Human Molting**

The surface of the skin is composed entirely of dead cells, which are regularly shed and replaced. The average rate of shedding is estimated at 25,000 cells per minute, which means that each day, we shed about 36 million skin cells [\(1](#page-2-3)). Our skin regenerates about once every 30 days ([2\)](#page-2-4), which means that we generate a new skin about 12 times each year.

#### **Counting the Connections in the Cerebral Cortex**

The number of synaptic connections in the cerebral cortex is estimated at one million billion, or 1015 ([1\)](#page-2-5). If you were to count to this number at a rate of one number per second (one mississippi, two mississippi, etc.), it would take about 32 million years to complete the task.

## **The Storage Capacity of the Brain**

The popular claim that we use only a small fraction of our brain's capacity is supported by the report of a Japanese mnemonist (an individual who is skilled at retrieving information from memory) named Akira Hiraguchi, who memorized the sequence of numbers in Pi to 83,431 digits. It took him 16 hours and 28 minutes to recite all the numbers ([1\)](#page-2-6).
