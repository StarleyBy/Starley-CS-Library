# **Acute Kidney Injury**

*You can never solve all difficulties at once.*

Paul A.M. Dirac (*[a](#page-14-0)*)

As many as 60% of ICU patients experience an acute deterioration in renal function, which has been given the umbrella term, *acute kidney injury* [\(1](#page-14-1)). As expected, this condition has a multitude of etiologies, but most of the inciting factors can be classified as inflammatory, ischemic, or nephrotoxic in nature ([2,](#page-14-2)[3\)](#page-14-3). The consequences of this condition are as varied as the etiologies, but about 15% of the patients require renal replacement therapy [\(4](#page-14-4)), and as many as 60% of the patients will not survive [\(5](#page-14-5)).

This chapter begins by presenting the diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury (including the shortcomings), then proceeds with a description of the most common inciting conditions, and finishes with a description of the renal replacement therapies. Some authoritative reviews of this rather massive topic are included in the bibliography at the end of the chapter [\(2](#page-14-2)[–4](#page-14-4)).

## **DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA**

The term "acute renal failure" was introduced in 1951 ([5\)](#page-14-5), but due to a lack of agreement about this condition, the term "acute kidney injury" (AKI) was introduced in 2002, and ten years later (in 2012), the defining criteria for AKI were adopted and published as the "Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines ([6\)](#page-14-6), which are shown in [Table](#page-0-0) 34.1.

### <span id="page-0-0"></span>**TABLE 34.1 Diagnostic Criteria for Acute Kidney Injury**

The diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI) requires one of the following conditions:

- 1. An increase in serum creatinine of ≥0.3 mg/dL (≥26.5 μmol/L) within 48 hours.
- 2. An increase in serum creatinine to ≥1.5 times baseline within the previous 7 days.
- 3. Urine volume <0.5 mL/kg/hr (ideal body weight) for 6 hours.

From Reference 6.

### **Limitations**

There are a number of limitations in the diagnostic criteria for AKI, and the major ones are listed below:

- 1. The presence of oliguria (urine output <0.5 mL/kg/hr) can be an appropriate renal adjustment to decreased renal perfusion, rather than a sign of kidney "injury".
- 2. There is a lack of agreement about the minimum increase in serum creatinine required for the diagnosis of acute kidney injury.
- 3. The baseline serum creatinine may not be known.
- 4. The serum creatinine can be misleading as a marker of the glomerular filtration rate, as described next.

### *Serum Creatinine*

The serum creatinine is the traditional marker of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and Figure 34.1 shows the popular [creatinine-based](#page-2-0) methods for estimating the GFR. However, the serum creatinine level has the following limitations as a marker of the GFR:

- 1. The creatinine in blood is derived from the creatine produced in muscle, and thus is influenced by muscle mass, and the rate of creatine production in muscle.
- 2. The serum creatinine concentration is influenced by changes in plasma volume.
- 3. Creatinine is not only filtered at the glomerulus, but is also secreted by the renal tubules.

The influence of creatine production in muscle is an important consideration because critically ill patients lose about 2% of their muscle mass each day [\(7](#page-14-7)), and a decreased rate of creatine production has been reported in sepsis [\(8](#page-14-8)), which is the most common cause of AKI (see later). As a result, the serum creatinine can be an unreliable marker of the GFR in critically ill patients. This is supported by studies showing that *estimates of the GFR based on the serum creatinine level consistently overestimate the true GFR in critically ill patients* [\(9](#page-14-9),10). This has important implications not only for the evaluation of renal function, but also for the appropriate dosing of drugs based on estimates of the GFR.

<span id="page-2-0"></span>
$$GFR = \frac{(140 - Age) \times wt (kg) \times (0.85 \text{ if Female})}{72 \times Serum Creatinine (mg/dL)} (mL/min)$$

**FIGURE 34.1** Popular formulas for estimating the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) based on the serum creatinine level. MDRD = Modification of Diet in Renal Disease.

**CYSTATIN C:** Cystatin C is a protein produced by most cells in the body that is completely cleared by the GFR. Serum levels of cystatin C are not influenced by muscle mass, which gives cystatin a potential advantage over creatinine. Estimates of the GFR based on the serum cystatin C level are more accurate than creatinine-based estimates, but they often underestimate the true GFR in critically ill patients [\(9](#page-14-9),10). Combining cystatin-based and creatinine-based estimates of GFR increases the accuracy further ([9,](#page-14-9)10), but the complexity of this approach is far from appealing.

### **Other Monikers**

Acute kidney injury that persists for more than a few days is called *acute kidney disease*, and if this condition persists for ≥90 days, it is called *chronic kidney disease* [\(5](#page-14-5)). The reasoning for these distinctions is unclear (i.e., injury vs. disease, and 90 days vs. 60 days)

## **COMMON CAUSES OF ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY**

As mentioned in the introduction, most cases of AKI are the result of inflammatory injury, hemodynamic aberrations, or a nephrotoxic agent, and [Table](#page-2-1) 34.2 shows the common causes of AKI in each of these categories.

**FIGURE 34.2** Schematic depiction of the pressures that influence the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Pā = mean arterial pressure, Pv = venous pressure, PPT = pressure in the proximal tubules.

### **Relevant Pressures**

Before describing the common causes of AKI, a quick review of the pressures that influence the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is warranted. This is illustrated in [Figure](#page-3-0) 34.2. Flow through the glomerulus is determined by the difference between the mean arterial pressure and the renal venous pressure (Pā – Pv). This is also called the *glomerular filtration pressure*. The net filtration pressure across the glomerulus, which is also called the *filtration gradient*, is the difference between the glomerular filtration pressure and the pressure in the proximal renal tubules (PPT); i.e.,

Filtration Gradient = 
$$(P\bar{a} - Pv) - P_{PT}$$
 (34.1)

These relationships predict that the GFR will decrease not only when there is a decrease in mean arterial pressure, but also when there is an increase in venous pressure (i.e., renal venous pressure or central venous pressure) or an increase in pressure in the proximal tubules.

### **Sepsis**

Sepsis is the leading cause of AKI, and is responsible for about half of the cases of AKI in the

ICU population [\(3](#page-14-3)). The principal mechanism is inflammatory (oxidative) injury involving both the capillary endothelium in the glomerulus and the epithelial lining of the renal tubules (11). The renal tubular injury is also called *acute tubular necrosis* (ATN), and is characterized by sloughing of the damaged cells into the lumen of the renal tubules, as shown in [Figure](#page-5-0) 34.3 (12). This creates a luminal obstruction, which increases the pressure in the proximal tubules, and hence decreases the GFR (according to [Figure](#page-3-0) 34.2). This phenomenon is called *tubuloglomerular feedback* (13).

Major surgery and multisystem trauma are other causes of AKI in which inflammation plays a major role (although hemodynamic factors may also be involved). AKI has been reported in over 50% of patients after liver transplantation, in 18% of patients following cardiac surgery, and in 13% of patients undergoing major abdominal surgery [\(3](#page-14-3)). Multisystem trauma is accompanied by AKI in about 30% of cases, and rhabdomyolysis is responsible for 30% of these cases (14).

### **Cardiorenal Syndrome**

Heart failure and renal dysfunction are common companions; i.e., in a review that included about 80,000 hospitalized patients with heart failure, renal dysfunction was present in 63% of the patients (15). This association between heart failure and renal impairment is known as the *cardiorenal syndrome* (16).

#### *Venous Congestion*

The renal impairment associated with heart failure has traditionally been attributed to a decrease in renal perfusion pressure, but the increase in central venous pressure in heart failure also plays a role in reducing the GFR (17). In fact, in a study of patients with heart failure who were managed with pulmonary artery catheters, the right atrial pressure (central venous pressure) was the only parameter that showed a correlation with renal dysfunction (18). It seems likely that a decrease in renal perfusion pressure plays a major role in the renal dysfunction associated with acute heart failure, while venous congestion assumes an important role in cases of chronic, decompensated heart failure (19).

<span id="page-5-0"></span>![](_page_5_Figure_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 34.3** Photomicrograph of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) showing a proximal tubule (outlined by the dotted line) filled with exfoliated renal tubular cells. Image retouched, from Reference 12.

The influence of venous pressure on the GFR means that AKI can be the result of any disorder that results in pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure. The abdominal compartment syndrome is another cause of AKI mediated by venous pressure, as explained next.

### **Abdominal Compartment Syndrome**

Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is an increase in intra-abdominal pressure that is great enough to cause dysfunction in one or more vital organs (20). The organ dysfunction usually involves the bowel, kidneys, and/or cardiovascular system. *ACS is more common than suspected in critically ill patients, and is often overlooked as a cause of AKI in ICU patients* (21).

### *Relevant Pressures*

The intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is normally 5–7 mm Hg in the supine position. Intraabdominal hypertension (IAH) is defined as a supine IAP ≥ 12 mm Hg, and ACS is defined as a supine IAP > 20 mm Hg that is associated with AKI or acute dysfunction in another organ systems.

**ABDOMINAL PERFUSION PRESSURE:** As shown in [Figure](#page-3-0) 34.2, the driving pressure for glomerular blood flow is the difference between the mean arterial pressure and the pressure in the renal veins (Pā – Pv). However, when IAP exceeds the renal venous pressure, the driving pressure for glomerular flow is the difference between the mean arterial pressure and the IAP. This pressure difference is called the *abdominal perfusion pressure* (APP):

$$APP = P\bar{a} - IAP \tag{34.2}$$

The APP needed to preserve renal blood flow is not well defined, but studies of patients with IAH and ACS have shown that an APP > 60 mm Hg is associated with improved outcomes (20).

**FILTRATION GRADIENT:** When the IAP is increased, the pressure in the proximal tubules is considered equivalent to the IAP, so the filtration gradient is determined as follows:

Filtration Gradient = 
$$P\bar{a} - (IAP \times 2)$$
 (34.3)

This relationship predicts that an increase in IAP will have a greater impact on the GFR than an equivalent decrease in arterial pressure. This might explain why *oliguria is one of the first signs of ACS* (20).

### *Predisposing Conditions*

ACS is traditionally associated with abdominal trauma or surgery, but several medical conditions can raise the IAP and predispose to ACS, including gastric distension, bowel obstruction, ileus, ascites, bowel wall edema, hepatomegaly, positive-pressure breathing, upright body position, and obesity (22). Several of these factors can co-exist in critically ill patients, which explains why *IAH is discovered in as many as 60% of patients in medical and surgical ICUs* (23).

**CRYSTALLOID RESUSCITATION:** One of the more common and unrecognized causes of IAH is volume resuscitation with crystalloid fluids, which can raise the IAP by promoting edema in the abdominal organs (especially the bowel). (The distribution of crystalloid fluids is described in Chapter 10: see Figure 10.1.) In one report of ICU patients with a positive fluid balance >5 liters over 24 hours, IAH was present in 85% of the patients, and ACS was diagnosed in 25% of the patients (24). This observation adds to the growing consensus that avoiding a positive fluid balance will reduce morbidity and mortality during the ICU stay. (See Chapter 11 for more on the concerns about fluid accumulation.)

### *Measuring Intra-abdominal Pressure*

The physical examination is insensitive for detecting increases in IAP (25), so IAP must be measured. The standard measure of IAP is the pressure in a decompressed urinary bladder, which is measured with specialized bladder drainage catheters. The following conditions are required for each measurement (20): (*a*) the patient must be in the supine position, with the pressure transducer zeroed in the mid-axillary line, (*b*) a small volume (25 mL) of isotonic saline is injected into the bladder 30–60 seconds prior to each measurement, and (*c*) the IAP is measured only at the end of expiration, and only when there is no evidence of abdominal muscle contractions. The IAP is measured in mm Hg, not cm H2O (1 mm Hg = 1.36 cm H2O).

### **Hepatorenal Syndrome**

Acute kidney injury has been reported in 50% of patients with end-stage liver disease (26). The AKI in this setting can be the result of hypovolemia or sepsis (especially spontaneous bacterial peritonitis), or it can be a manifestation of the *hepatorenal syndrome* (HRS), a serious condition caused by the diversion of blood flow away from the kidneys due to the combination of renal

vasoconstriction and splanchnic vasodilation (27). The diagnosis of HRS is suggested by excluding hypovolemia and sepsis as a cause of AKI, and the urinary indices (described later) can distinguish HRS from ATN.

HRS typically carries a very poor prognosis, with liver transplantation being the definitive treatment. There is, however, a short-term management strategy, which is presented in Chapter 39.

### **Nephrotoxins**

A variety of drugs can precipitate AKI, as shown in [Table](#page-7-0) 34.3, and avoiding these (or any) drugs is always wise when possible (28).

### *Radiocontrast Dye*

Iodinated contrast agents have traditionally been perceived as a cause of AKI in critically ill patients, but this was based on observational studies. More recent and better controlled studies have revealed that *radiocontrast dye injections do not increase the incidence of AKI in critically ill patients* (29)*, and they do not worsen renal function in patients with pre-existing AKI* (30). However, iodinated contrast dye is still considered risky in patients with chronic kidney disease and a GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (31).

**PROPHYLACTIC FLUIDS:** Despite the favorable data on radiocontrast agents, the most recent consensus statement includes the following recommendations (31).

- 1. Prophylactic saline infusions are recommended for radiocontrast dye injections in patients with AKI, or with an estimated GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. This recommendation does not necessarily apply to patients with heart failure.
- 2. The infusion should begin 1 hour prior to the study, and should continue for 3–12 hours after the study. There is no firm recommendation regarding the volume infused.

### *Rhabdomyolysis*

AKI is the most serious complication of diffuse muscle injury (rhabdomyolysis). The culprit is myoglobin, which is released by the injured muscle and is capable of damaging the renal tubular epithethial cells (32,33). The source of this injury may be the iron moiety in heme, which is capable of oxidative cell injury via the production of hydroxyl radicals (see Figure 25.6).

**DIAGNOSIS:** The diagnosis of AKI can be difficult in the setting of rhabdomyolysis because the injured muscle releases creatine, which elevates the serum creatinine level. Elevation of the creatine kinase (CK) in blood is essential for the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis, but the CK level correlates more with the severity of the muscle injury than the risk of AKI (32). The presence of myoglobinuria is thus a critical component of diagnosing AKI in patients with rhabdomyolysis. A urine myoglobin level >20 μg/L is evidence of significant myoglobinuria (urine usually begins to turn brown at this level) (33).

Myoglobin can also be detected in urine with the orthotoluidine dipstick reaction (Hemastix), which is used to detect occult blood in urine. If the test is positive, the urine should be centrifuged (to separate erythrocytes) and the supernatant should be passed through a micropore filter (to remove hemoglobin). A persistently positive test after these measures is evidence of myoglobin in urine. An alternative approach is to inspect the urine sediment for red blood cells; i.e., a positive dipstick test for blood without red blood cells in the urine sediment can be used as evidence of myoglobinuria.

**MANAGEMENT:** The following measures are available for preventing or limiting myoglobinuric renal injury (32,33).

- 1. Aggressive volume resuscitation to promote renal tubular flow is the most effective measure for preventing or limiting myoglobin nephrotoxicity. Isotonic saline can be given in volume of 10–20 mL/kg initially, and then infused to maintain a urine output of at least 1 mg/kg/hr. However, if oliguria persists after a few hours, it is important to abandon this strategy to prevent fluid overload.
- 2. Alkalinization of the urine to a pH > 6.5 with bicarbonate infusions can inhibit cast formation in the renal tubules, but this is difficult to accomplish, and bicarbonate has its own problems (see Chapter 32).
- 3. Diuresis with mannitol or furosemide has been used to promote renal tubular flow, but diuresis is risky because it is counterproductive to the planned volume resuscitation.

As many as 30% of patients will require renal replacement therapy (34), which is described later in the chapter.

## **DIAGNOSTIC CONSIDERATIONS**

The following measures can be helpful if there is uncertainty about the diagnosis of AKI or its source.

### **Ultrasound**

A beside ultrasound can be useful for uncovering chronic kidney disease (i.e., small kidneys),

and for identifying post-renal obstruction (i.e., hydronephrosis). This latter condition is especially important, as emergent drainage may be necessary, especially if the urine is infected.

### **Urinary Indices**

The measures in [Table](#page-9-0) 34.4 can help to determine if the source of AKI is renal hypoperfusion (i.e., from hypovolemia or low cardiac output) or renal tubular injury (e.g., from sepsis) (35). However, each of these measures has its limitations. (*Note:* Biomarkers are often mentioned for identifying renal tubular injury, but they are not readily available.)

### *Spot Urine Sodium*

Renal hypoperfusion is accompanied by an increase in sodium reabsorption and a subsequent decrease in urine sodium concentration. In contrast, renal tubular injury results in impaired sodium reabsorption and increased urinary sodium losses. Therefore, when a random urine sample (spot urine) is obtained in a patient with AKI, a urine sodium <20 mEq/L is used as evidence of renal hypoperfusion, while a urine sodium >40 mEq/L is used as evidence of renal tubular injury.

**EXCEPTIONS:** Unfortunately, there are exceptions to the predicted behavior of the spot urine sodium. For example, renal hypoperfusion can be associated with a high urine sodium (>40 mEq/L) if there is ongoing diuretic therapy, or the patient has chronic renal disease (where there is "obligatory" sodium loss in the urine).

### *Fractional Excretion of Sodium*

The fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) is considered a more accurate measure of renal tubular function than the spot urine sodium. The FENa is equivalent to the fractional sodium clearance divided by the fractional creatinine clearance, as expressed by the following equation:

$$FENa (\%) = \frac{U/P [Na]}{U/P [Cr]}$$
(34.4)

where U/P is the urine-to-plasma ratio for sodium and creatinine concentrations. In euvolemic patients with normal renal function, the FENa is 1% (i.e., only 1% of the filtered sodium is excreted in the urine). When renal hypoperfusion is present, the FENa is <1% (reflecting sodium

conservation), and when renal tubular injury is present, the FENa is typically >2% (reflecting an increase in urinary sodium excretion) (36).

**EXCEPTIONS:** Like the spot urine sodium, the FENa can be elevated (>1%) by diuretic therapy and chronic renal insufficiency (36). In addition, the FENa can be falsely low (<1%) in patients with acute tubular injury from sepsis (37), or myoglobinuria (38).

### *Fractional Excretion of Urea*

The fractional excretion of urea (FEU) is conceptually similar to the FENa, and is equivalent to the fractional urea clearance divided by the fractional creatinine clearance, as expressed by the following equation:

$$FEU (\%) = \frac{U/P [Urea]}{U/P [Cr]}$$
(34.5)

U/P [Cr]

where U/P is the urine-to-plasma ratio for urea and creatinine concentrations. The FEU is low (<35%) with renal hypoperfusion, and high (>50%) with renal tubular injury. *The FEU is not influenced by diuretics* (39), which is the major advantage over the FENa.

### **MANAGEMENT**

### **General Considerations**

The following comments about the general management of AKI deserve mention.

### *Fluid Challenges*

Volume infusion is typically the initial intervention in patients with AKI, since it is often not possible to rule out renal hypoperfusion as a contributing factor at that time, and the urine output may also be diminished. The fluid challenge is usually 500 mL of a crystalloid fluid infused over 10–15 minutes. (The rate of infusion is more important than the volume). Changes in stroke volume can be used to determine fluid responsiveness, as described in Chapter 11. Fluid challenges should be stopped if there is no response in the stroke volume or urine output.

#### *Diuretics*

A trial of intravenous furosemide is reasonable as an attempt to mitigate fluid accumulation in AKI. However, *diuretics should never be given to increase urine output if renal hypoperfusion is a contributing factor in AKI*. Intravenous furosemide does not improve renal function, and is used solely for fluid management (40,41).

#### *Low-Dose Dopamine*

Dopamine infusions at low dose rates (2 μg/kg/min) can promote renal vasodilation, which led to the popularity of low-dose dopamine as a treatment for AKI (42). However, this practice fell from favor because it did not improve renal function, and had undesirable effects (e.g., decreased

splanchnic blood flow) (42,43). The use of low-dose dopamine in AKI is now considered *bad medicine* (from the title of Reference 43).

### **Renal Replacement Therapy**

About 10-15% of ICU patients receive renal replacement therapy (RRT) [\(4](#page-14-4)). The usual indications include: (a) symptomatic uremia (e.g., encephalopathy), (b) volume overload, (c) lifethreatening, refractory hyperkalemia, and (c) removal of toxin (44).

There is a growing body of RRT techniques, but the descriptions that follow are limited to hemodialysis and hemofiltration. The mechanisms of fluid and solute removal by each of these techniques is shown in [Figure](#page-12-0) 34.4.

### *Hemodialysis*

Hemodialysis is an intermittent form of RRT that removes solutes by *diffusion*, which is driven by the concentration gradient of the solutes across a semipermeable membrane. To maintain this concentration gradient, a technique called *countercurrent exchange* is used, where blood and dialysis fluid are driven in opposite directions across the dialysis membrane. A blood pump is used to move blood in one direction at a rate of 200–300 mL/min, while the dialysis fluid on the other side of the membrane moves at a higher rate (500–800 mL/min) (37).

**FIGURE 34.4** Mechanisms of solute clearance by hemodialysis and hemofiltration. The smaller particles represent small solutes (e.g., urea), which can be cleared by both techniques, while the larger particles represent larger solutes (e.g., toxins) that can be cleared by hemofiltration, but not by hemodialysis.

Large-bore, central venous catheters like the one in [Figure](#page-13-0) 34.5 are used for acute hemodialysis in the ICU. Note that the catheter has 12-gauge infusion channels, to accommodate the flow rates of 200–300 mL/min used during hemodialysis. These catheters are inserted into the internal jugular or femoral veins in the same manner as other central venous catheters (see Chapter 2). (*Note:* The subclavian vein is not cannulated, which avoids the risk of subclavian

stenosis that could hamper the selection of access sites for long-term hemodialysis.) Each hemodialysis session lasts about 4 hours, and no more than 2–3 liters of fluid can be removed per session.

**ADVANTAGES:** The principal benefit of hemodialysis is rapid clearance of small solutes. Only a few hours of hemodialysis is needed to clear a life-threatening accumulation of potassium, or to remove a day's worth of accumulated nitrogenous waste.

**DISADVANTAGES:** The disadvantages of hemodialysis include: (a) limited removal of fluid and large molecules (drugs and toxins) and (b) the risk of hypotension in patients who are hemodynamically unstable.

#### *Hemofiltration*

Hemofiltration removes solutes by *convection*, where a hydrostatic pressure gradient is used to move a solute-containing fluid across a semipermeable membrane. The bulk movement of fluid "drags" the solute across the membrane, hence this process is also known as *solvent drag* (45).

Hemofiltration can remove large volumes of fluid (up to 3 liters per hour), but the rate of small solute clearance is much slower than during hemodialysis. As a result, *hemofiltration must be performed continuously to provide effective solute clearance*. The popular method is *continuous venovenous hemofiltration* (CVVH), where venous blood is removed and returned through large-bore, double-lumen catheters like the ones used for hemodialysis. Because solutes are cleared with water, the plasma concentration of these solutes does not decrease unless a

solute-free intravenous fluid is infused to replace some of the ultrafiltrate that is lost.

**ADVANTAGES:** The advantages of CVVH include: (*a*) improved tolerance in hemodynamically unstable patients, (*b*) ability to remove large volumes of fluid, and (*c*) ability to remove drugs and toxins. CVVH with increased pore size is also effective in removing inflammatory cytokines from blood (46), which has important implications for patients with sepsis and septic shock (where the organ dysfunction is inflammatory in origin).

**DISADVANTAGES:** The major disadvantage of hemofiltration is the slow removal of small solutes, which is not well suited for clearing nitrogenous waste or for life-threatening hyperkalemia.

### *Hemodiafiltration*

Hemodiafiltration combines the benefits of dialysis (rapid clearance of small solutes) and hemofiltration (removal of fluid and toxins), and can be delivered as *continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration* (CVVHD). This has become the favored method of renal replacement therapy in the ICU, although the performance can be fickle.

### **A FINAL WORD**

### **The Dirac Equation & Acute Kidney Injury**

The author of the introductory quote (Paul Dirac) was a theoretical physicist who introduced an equation (the Dirac equation) to describe the behavior of all electrons (*a*). However, the equation ultimately failed in its intended task, which prompted the introductory quote. This has some similarities to the concept of acute kidney injury, which attempts to encompass the entire spectrum of acute renal dysfunction, but ultimately fails in its intended task. (For example, it fails to reliably identify renal dysfunction because it relies on the serum creatinine.) In fact, it is not entirely clear how the term "acute kidney injury" offers anything over the time-honored term "acute renal dysfunction".
