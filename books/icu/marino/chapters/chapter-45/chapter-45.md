# **Disorders of Consciousness**

*I think, therefore I am.*

René Descartes (1644)

The ability to recognize and interact with the surroundings (i.e., consciousness) is the *sine qua non* of the life experience, and loss of this ability is one of the dominant (and dreaded) signs of a life-threatening illness. This chapter describes the major disorders of consciousness that you will encounter in the ICU, with emphasis on delirium, coma, and the ultimate disorder of consciousness, brain death.

# **ALTERED CONSCIOUSNESS**

Consciousness has two components: arousal and awareness.

- 1. *Arousal* is the ability to experience your surroundings, and is also known as *wakefulness*.
- 2. *Awareness* is the ability to understand your relationship to your surroundings, and is also known as *responsiveness*.

These two components can be used to classify the altered states of consciousness, as indicated in [Table](#page-0-0) 45.1 [\(1](#page-15-0)[–3](#page-15-1)).

## **Altered States of Consciousness**

The principal states of altered consciousness are as follows:

- 1. *Anxiety* and *lethargy* are conditions where arousal and awareness are intact, but there is a change in *attentiveness* (i.e., the degree of awareness).
- 2. A l*ocked-in state* is a condition where arousal and awareness are intact, but there is almost total absence of motor responsiveness. This condition is caused by bilateral injury to the motor pathways in the ventral pons, which disrupts all voluntary movements except up-down ocular movements and eyelid blinking ([3\)](#page-15-1).
- 3. *Delirium* and *dementia* are conditions where arousal is intact, but awareness is altered. The change in awareness can be fluctuating (with delirium) or permanent (with dementia).
- 4. *Stupor* is a condition where the subject is difficult to arouse, and is unaware of some or all elements in the environment.
- 5. A *vegetative state* is a condition where there is some degree of arousal (eyes can open), but there is no awareness. Spontaneous movements and motor responses to deep pain can be present, but the movements are purposeless. After one month, this condition is called a *persistent vegetative state* [\(4](#page-15-2)).
- 6. *Coma* is the total absence of arousal and awareness (i.e., unarousable unawareness). Like the vegetative state, spontaneous movements and motor responses to deep pain can be present, but the movements are purposeless.
- 7. *Brain death* is similar to coma in that there is a total absence of arousal and awareness. However, brain death differs from coma in two ways: (*a*) it involves loss of all brainstem function, including cranial nerve responses, and spontaneous respirations and (*b*) it is always irreversible.

# **Predisposing Conditions**

There are an innumerable number of conditions that can alter consciousness, and [Figure](#page-2-0) 45.1 shows a list of the most likely ones in critically ill patients. In a general medical-surgical ICU, the prominent causes of altered consciousness are likely to include the following:

- 1. Sedation during mechanical ventilation.
- 2. Clinical shock syndromes.
- 3. Encephalopathies (ischemic, septic, and metabolic).
- 4. Drug overdoses or withdrawal.

It is worth mentioning that *nonconvulsive seizures* are an often overlooked cause of altered consciousness in ICU patients. (See Chapter 46 for more on this topic.)

# **DELIRIUM**

The delirium described in this section is a manifestation of "brain dysfunction", which is one part of the multiorgan dysfunction that plagues critically ill patients. The incidence of this type of delirium is about 25–50%, and it is especially common in elderly and ventilator-dependent patients ([5\)](#page-15-3). The delirium that is associated with alcohol withdrawal is a separate entity, and is described in a later section.

## **Clinical Features**

The clinical features of delirium are summarized in [Figure](#page-4-0) 45.2 ([6,](#page-15-4)[7\)](#page-15-5). As indicated, delirium is a state of inattentiveness (i.e., inability to focus) that has a rapid onset or a rapidly fluctuating course (i.e., changes occur within a 24-hour time period), and is accompanied by either disordered thinking (i.e., incoherent or illogical responses) or an altered level of consciousness (hyperactive or lethargic).

Three types of ICU-related delirium are recognized: (*a*) *hyperactive delirium*, where the patient is restless and agitated, (*b*) *hypoactive delirium*, where the patient is lethargic and somnolent; and (*c*) *mixed delirium*, where there are alternating episodes of hyperactive and hypoactive delirium. *Hypoactive delirium is the most common form* ([5\)](#page-15-3), and is often overlooked because of the popular misperception that delirium is a state of severe agitation.

#### *Predisposing Conditions*

Any condition that is associated with an encephalopathy can be a source of delirium. The major ones in the ICU are sepsis, liver failure, uremia, and the use of sedative-hypnotic drugs [\(5](#page-15-3)).

**SEDATION:** The use of heavy and prolonged sedation is considered a risk factor for delirium ([8\)](#page-15-6), and *benzodiazepines are considered the principal sedatives that promote delirium in the ICU* ([9,](#page-15-7)[10\)](#page-15-8). As a result, avoidance of benzodiazepines is considered an important preventive measure for ICU-related delirium ([10\)](#page-15-8).

# **Diagnosis**

Validated screening tools are considered essential for the detection of delirium ([5\)](#page-15-3), and the *Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU* (CAM-ICU) is probably the most popular of these diagnostic tools ([6,](#page-15-4)[7\)](#page-15-5). A summary of the CAM-ICU method is included in Appendix II at the end of the book.

#### *Delirium versus Dementia*

Delirium and dementia are distinct mental disorders that can be confused because they have overlapping clinical features (i.e., attention deficits and disordered thinking). However, *delirium has two characteristics that distinguish it from dementia: i.e., the acute onset and fluctuating course*.

## *Psychosis versus Delirium*

Delirium can be difficult to distinguish from psychosis. Over 40% of hospitalized patients with delirium have psychotic symptoms (e.g., visual hallucinations) [\(11](#page-15-9)), and delirium has been given the misnomer of "ICU psychosis" ([12\)](#page-15-10).

### **Management**

*No drug has proven effective in preventing or correcting ICU-related delirium, and drugs are recommended only to restore calm in severely agitated patients* (which is not treating the underlying delirium) ([5,](#page-15-3)[10\)](#page-15-8). The drugs that can be used for this purpose are included in Table 45.2. [Dexmedetomidine](#page-4-1) is the preferred agent ([10\)](#page-15-8), but can produce troublesome bradycardia and hypotension (see Chapter 6). Haloperidol is a popular agent for hyperactive delirium (see

Chapter 6), but has a relatively slow onset of action (which can be a disadvantage in severely agitated patients). Ziprasidone is an atypical antipsychotic agent that can be only be given intramuscularly, but this can be advantageous when intravenous access is problematic in a severely agitated patient ([13\)](#page-15-11).

#### *Prevention*

The following interventions are recommended for reducing the risk of ICU-related delirium ([5,](#page-15-3)[10\)](#page-15-8): (*a*) adequate treatment of pain, (*b*) avoiding deep sedation, when possible, (*c*) promoting sleep-awake cycles, (*d*) encouraging family visitation, (*e*) early ambulation, and (*f*) avoiding benzodiazepines. Unfortunately, these interventions have not been successful in critically ill patients [\(14](#page-15-12)).

# **ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL**

Alcohol (ethanol) is a central nervous system depressant that acts by stimulating the neuronal release of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain ([15\)](#page-15-13). Chronic alcohol intake increases the density of GABA receptors in the brain [\(15](#page-15-13)), and this certainly contributes to the excitatory state that characterizes the alcohol withdrawal syndrome.

#### **Clinical Features**

The clinical features of alcohol withdrawal are shown in [Table](#page-6-0) 45.3 ([16\)](#page-15-14). The earliest signs of withdrawal are agitation and tremulousness, which can appear as early as 6 hours after the last drink. This can be followed by generalized seizures. hallucinations (visual, auditory, or tactile), and signs of autonomic hyperactivity (e.g., tachycardia, hypertension). Delirium is a relatively late finding, and is accompanied by increased motor activity. The Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Scale, Revised (CIWA-AR) is the standard method for monitoring the severity of alcohol withdrawal, but it is not recommended for patients with alcohol withdrawal delirium ([17\)](#page-15-15). Instead, the CAM-ICU assessment of delirium (which is included in Appendix II) is recommended for alcohol withdrawal delirium ([17\)](#page-15-15).

#### *Seizures*

Generalized seizures can appear as early as 6–8 hours after the last drink (the risk of seizures peaks at 24 hrs), and they can appear in isolation, without other signs of withdrawal [\(17](#page-15-15)). The recommended treatment is lorazepam (2 mg IV push), which prevents recurrent seizures ([18\)](#page-15-16).

Phenytoin is not recommended for alcohol-withdrawal seizures ([17\)](#page-15-15).

#### *Delirium Tremens*

About 5% of patients develop a severe form of alcohol withdrawal known as *delirium tremens* (DTs) ([16,](#page-15-14)[17\)](#page-15-15), which appears about 2–3 days after the last drink, and is characterized by hyperactive delirium, hallucinations, and signs of autonomic hyperactivity (e.g., fever, tachycardia, hypertension) that can progress to hemodynamic instability. This condition typically lasts 3–5 days [\(16](#page-15-14)), and delirium that persists for longer than 5 days should prompt consideration of another cause of the problem (see later). The hypoactive form of delirium, which is a common presentation of ICU-related delirium, does not occur in alcohol withdrawal delirium.

Adapted from Reference 16.

# **Management**

*The drugs of choice for treating alcohol withdrawal delirium are the benzodiazepines* [\(17](#page-15-15)), which mimic the CNS-depressant effects of alcohol by stimulating GABA receptors in the brain ([15\)](#page-15-13). Large doses of benzodiazepines (e.g., 30–40 mg of IV lorazepam or 150–200 mg of IV diazepam in 3–4 hours) may be required in severe cases [\(17](#page-15-15)).

#### *ICU Management*

For patients who require ICU-level care, the benzodiazepines should be given intravenously. *Lorazepam* can be given in a dose of 2–4 mg IV every 5–10 minutes until the desired level of calm is achieved. Thereafter, the dose can be reduced to 2–4 mg IV every few hours as needed. Continuous infusions of high-dose lorazepam (i.e., ≥0.1 mg/kg/hr) should not be continued for longer than 48 hours because of the risk of *propylene glycol toxicity* (see Chapter 6). (The same risk occurs with prolonged infusions of diazepam).

It is important to taper benzodiazepines as soon as possible because they are highly lipid soluble and readily accumulate in the brain with continued use, which can delay awakening and prolong the ICU stay. (See Chapter 6 for more on sedation with benzodiazepines.)

#### *Benzodiazepine Resistance*

Benzodiazepine resistance has been described as uncontrolled alcohol withdrawal despite IV lorazepam doses of 30–40 mg or IV diazepam doses of 150–200 mg in the first 3–4 hours of treatment [\(17](#page-15-15)). In these cases, the following adjunctive medications have been recommended ([17\)](#page-15-15).

- 1. Propofol is a rapidly-acting, GABAergic sedative that is the preferred adjunct to benzodiazepines for patients who are intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation ([17\)](#page-15-15). The administration of propofol is described in Chapter 6 (see Table 6.6).
- 2. Phenobarbital is an effective adjunct for benzodiazepines, and can be given in doses of 130– 260 mg IV every 15–20 minutes until the desired effect is achieved [\(19](#page-15-17)). However, barbiturates should be used cautiously, because they can depress respirations and promote hypotension.
- 3. Dexmedetomidine has been recommended as an adjunct to benzodiazepines [\(17](#page-15-15)), using the dosage recommendations in [Table](#page-4-1) 45.2. However, the clinical experience with this drug in severe alcohol withdrawal has not been encouraging ([20\)](#page-15-18).

## **Other Considerations**

The following conditions can be mistaken for alcohol withdrawal, and should be considered when there is resistance to benzodiazepines.

#### *Wernicke's Encephalopathy*

Patients with alcohol use disorder can experience a sudden deterioration in mental status a few days after admission that is the result of acute Wernicke's encephalopathy (from thiamine deficiency) rather than alcohol withdrawal delirium. This occurs when thiamine stores are borderline depleted on admission, and the glucose load from intravenous fluids and feeding regimens utilizes the remaining thiamine (which is used for glucose metabolism) [\(21](#page-15-19)). The presence of nystagmus and oculomotor palsies (e.g., lateral gaze paralysis) can help to identify Wernicke's encephalopathy, but these are infrequent findings.

Patients with alcohol use disorder are typically given thiamine in a dose of 100 mg daily while in the hospital, but this is an insufficient dose for the treatment of Wernicke's encephalopathy. (See Chapter 48 for more on thiamine deficiency.)

### *Gabapentin Withdrawal*

Gabapentin is a GABA analog that is used to treat a variety of disorders, including partial seizures, neuropathic pain, migraine and cluster headaches, psychiatric disorders, and alcohol use disorder. Multiple reports have demonstrated that abrupt discontinuation of gabapentin can result in a hyperactive delirium that is indistinguishable from alcohol withdrawal [\(22](#page-15-20)). This usually occurs when the daily dose of gabapentin is 3,000 mg or higher, and the onset can occur from 12 hours to 7 days after the last drug dose. Benzodiazepines are ineffective in controlling the delirium from gabapentin withdrawal, and restarting the gabapentin can have dramatic results (author's experience).

# **COMA**

The patient who is comatose (i.e., unarousable and unaware) is one of the most challenging problems in critical care, as recovery in these patients is never certain.

## **Etiologies**

Coma can be the result of any of the following conditions:

- 1. Diffuse anoxic or ischemic brain injury.
- 2. Supratentorial mass lesion causing transtentorial herniation and brainstem compression.
- 3. Posterior fossa mass lesion causing direct brainstem compression.
- 4. Brainstem stroke.
- 5. Toxic or metabolic encephalopathies (including drug overdose).
- 6. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus.
- 7. Apparent coma (i.e., locked-in state, hysterical reaction).

#### **Bedside Evaluation**

The bedside evaluation of coma should include cranial nerve reflexes, spontaneous eye and body movements, and motor reflexes. The following elements of the evaluation deserve mention.

#### *Motor Responses*

Spontaneous myoclonus (irregular, jerking movements) can be a nonspecific sign of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, or it can represent seizure activity (myoclonic seizures), while flaccid extremities can indicate diffuse brain injury or injury to the brainstem. A focal motor defect in the extremities (e.g., hemiparesis or asymmetric reflexes) is a sign of a space-occupying lesion or a localized area of brain or spinal cord injury.

**RESPONSE TO PAIN:** A purposeful response to painful stimulation (e.g., limb withdrawal to pain) is not a feature of the comatose state. Instead, the response to pain is either purposeless or absent. The following responses are determined by a specific area of brain injury:

- 1. With injury to the thalamus, painful stimuli provoke flexion of the upper extremities, which is called *decorticate posturing*.
- 2. With injury to the midbrain and upper pons, the arms and legs extend and pronate in response to pain; this is called *decerebrate posturing*.
- 3. With injury to the lower brainstem, the extremities remain flaccid during painful stimulation.

#### *Eye Opening*

Spontaneous eye opening is an indication of arousal, and is not consistent with the diagnosis of coma. Spontaneous eye opening can be associated with awareness (i.e., locked-in state) or lack of awareness (i.e., vegetative state).

#### *Examination of Pupils*

The conditions that affect pupillary size and light reactivity are shown in [Table](#page-9-0) 45.4 [\(23](#page-15-21)[–25](#page-15-22)).

(+) and (-) indicate a reactive and nonreactive pupil, respectively. From References 23–25. Pupillary findings can be summarized as follows:

- 1. Dilated, reactive pupils can be the result of drugs (anticholinergics, CNS stimulants, or adrenergic agonists) or nonconvulsive seizures. Dilated, unreactive pupils can be the result of diffuse brain injury, brainstem compression from an expanding intracranial mass, or increased intracranial pressure.
- 2. A unilateral, dilated and fixed pupil can be the result of ocular trauma or recent ocular surgery, or can be evidence of third cranial nerve dysfunction from an expanding intracranial mass.
- 3. Mid-position, reactive pupils can be the result of a metabolic encephalopathy, a sedative overdose, or neuromuscular blocking drugs, while mid-position, unreactive pupils can be a sign of acute liver failure, postanoxic encephalopathy, or brain death.
- 4. Small, reactive pupils can be the result of a metabolic encephalopathy, while pinpoint pupils can be the result of opioid overdose (pupils reactive) or damage in the pons (pupils unreactive).

#### *Ocular Motility*

Spontaneous eye movements (conjugate or disconjugate) are a nonspecific sign of a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy ([24\)](#page-15-23), while a fixed gaze preference (one or both eyes) is highly suggestive of a mass lesion or seizure activity.

#### *Ocular Reflexes*

The ocular reflexes are used to evaluate the functional integrity of the lower brainstem ([24\)](#page-15-23). These reflexes are illustrated in [Figure](#page-10-0) 45.3.

**FIGURE 45.3** The ocular reflexes in the evaluation of coma.

**OCULOCEPHALIC REFLEX:** The oculocephalic reflex is assessed by briskly rotating the head from side-to-side. When the cerebral hemispheres are impaired but the lower brainstem is intact, the eyes will deviate away from the direction of rotation and maintain a forward field of view. When the lower brainstem is damaged (or the patient is awake), the eyes will follow the direction of head rotation. The oculocephalic reflex should *not* be attempted in patients with an unstable cervical spine.

**OCULOVESTIBULAR REFLEX:** The oculovestibular reflex is performed by injecting 50 mL of cold saline in the external auditory canal of each ear (using a 50 mL syringe and a 2-inch soft plastic angiocatheter). Before the test is performed, check to make sure that the tympanic membrane is intact and that nothing is obstructing the ear canal. When brainstem function is intact, both eyes will deviate slowly towards the irrigated ear. This conjugate eye movement is lost when the lower brainstem is damaged. After the test is performed on one side, wait 5 minutes before testing the opposite side.

#### **The Glascow Coma Score**

The Glasgow Coma Scale, which is shown in [Table](#page-11-0) 45.5, was introduced to evaluate the severity of traumatic brain injuries (26,27), but has since been adopted for use in nontraumatic brain injuries (28). The Scale consists of three components: 1) eye opening, 2) verbal communication, and 3) motor response to verbal or noxious stimulation. The *Glasgow Coma Score* (GCS) is the sum of the three components. A minimum score of 3 indicates total absence of awareness and responsiveness, while a maximum score of 15 is normal.

<sup>\*</sup>Worst score is 3 points, and best score is 15 points. With endotracheal intubation, the highest score is 11.

#### *Interpretations*

The GCS is not reliable in patients who are paralyzed, heavily sedated, or hypotensive.

Otherwise, the GCS (best score) can be used as follows:

- 1. To define coma (GCS ≤8).
- 2. To stratify the severity of head injury (mild: GCS = 13–15, moderate: GCS = 9–12, severe: GCS ≤8) (26,27).
- 3. To identify candidates for intubation; i.e., airway protective reflexes are typically defective at a GCS ≤8, which is used as an indication for endotracheal intubation.
- 4. As a prognostic marker; e.g., in the initial evaluation of nontraumatic coma, patients with a GCS ≤6 are seven-times more likely to awaken than patients with a GCS ≤5 (27).

**INTUBATED PATIENTS:** One of the major shortcomings of the Glascow Coma Scale is the inability of evaluate verbal responses in intubated patients. These patients are assigned a verbal "pseudoscore" of 1 (for a maximum GCS of 11).

# **BRAIN DEATH**

The Uniform Determination of Death Act states that "An individual who has sustained either (*a*) irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions, or (*b*) irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brainstem, is dead" (29). The evaluation of these requirements is the purpose of the brain death determination.

Brain death is not a common consequence of the nontraumatic coma that is typically encountered in the ICU. It is most often the result of traumatic brain injury or intracerebral hemorrhage, where increases in intracranial pressure are sufficient to cause complete cessation of cerebral blood flow (30). Suspicion of brain death is often prompted by the absence of pupillary light reflexes, or the lack of spontaneous breathing efforts during mechanical ventilation.

# **Prerequisite Conditions**

A checklist for the brain death determination in adults is shown in [Table](#page-13-0) 45.6 (30–32). This checklist begins with conditions that must be satisfied before the brain death determination is performed. The following are some points of interest about the prerequisite conditions.

- 1. Although a systolic pressure ≥100 mm Hg is included as one of the conditions, the mean arterial pressure is the more important physiological pressure, and should be measured if an arterial catheter is in place. Note that the required mean arterial pressure (≥75 mm Hg) is higher than usual target for treating hypotension (≥65 mm Hg). This will help to counteract the effect of increased intracranial pressure to impede cerebral perfusion.
- 2. The absence of effects from CNS-suppressant drugs can be difficult to determine if sedative drugs were used recently. When blood levels of a sedating drug are not available, waiting 5 half-lives since the last dose is recommended to ensure drug clearance from the bloodstream (although this does not guarantee clearance from the brain) (31).
- 3. If targeted temperature management was used with a target below 36° C, then a body temperature of >36° C should be maintained for at least 24 hours before the brain death determination (31).

When the prerequisite conditions are satisfied, the brain death determination can begin. This includes two assessments that are separated by at least 12 hours. One examiner is considered sufficient (in adults) if the examiner is experienced in the task.

#### *Brainstem Reflexes*

The brain death determination begins with an evaluation of the reflexes that require a functioning brainstem: i.e., the corneal and pupillary light reflexes, the oculocephalic and oculovestibular reflexes, and the gag and cough reflexes. All these reflexes must be absent to proceed with the evaluation.

# **The Apnea Test**

The most convincing evidence of brain death is the absence of spontaneous breathing efforts in the face of an increased arterial PCO<sup>2</sup> (PaCO<sup>2</sup> ). (*Note:* CO<sup>2</sup> is a potent respiratory stimulant: i.e.,

an increase in PaCO<sup>2</sup> of only 1 mm Hg will increase the minute ventilation by 2 L/min (32).) The evaluation of spontaneous breathing efforts is called the *apnea test*, and it proceeds as follows:

- 1. Prior to the test, the patient is preoxygenated with 100% O<sup>2</sup> , and an arterial blood gas is obtained to establish the baseline PaCO<sup>2</sup> .
- 2. The patient is then separated from the ventilator and oxygen is insufflated into the endotracheal tube (apneic oxygenation) to help prevent O<sup>2</sup> desaturation during the apneic period.
- 3. The goal of the apnea test is to allow the PaCO<sup>2</sup> to rise 20 mm Hg above baseline. The PaCO<sup>2</sup> rises about 3 mm Hg per minute during apnea at normal body temperatures (33), so an apnea period of 6–7 minutes should be sufficient for reaching the target PaCO<sup>2</sup> . A repeat arterial blood gas is obtained at the end of the apnea period, and the patient is placed back on the ventilator.
- 4. If apnea persists despite a rise in PaCO<sup>2</sup> ≥20 mm Hg, the test confirms the diagnosis of brain death.
- 5. If the second apnea test confirms the diagnosis of brain death, *the time of death is the time that the second blood gas results became available* (31). However, patients are often kept on mechanical ventilation for a short period of time after this, to allow family members to have a final visit with the patient.

The apnea test is risky, because O<sup>2</sup> desaturation, hypotension, and serious cardiac arrhythmias can appear during the apnea period (34). If the apnea test cannot be completed, confirmatory testing is required to establish the diagnosis of brain death.

## *Lazarus' Sign*

Brain-dead patients can exhibit brief, spontaneous movements of the head, torso, or upper extremities (*Lazarus' Sign*), especially after they are removed from the ventilator (35). These movements are the result of neuronal discharges in the cervical spinal cord, possibly in response to hypoxemia, and they can be a source of angst when they appear after the patient has been pronounced brain dead and is removed from the ventilator.

#### *Confirmatory Tests*

The acceptable confirmatory tests are included in [Table](#page-13-0) 45.6. Confirmatory tests that are not considered acceptable include electroencephalography (EEG), auditory and somatosensory evoked potentials, computed tomographic angiography, and magnetic resonance angiography (31).

# **A FINAL WORD**

## **Family Care**

In the care of the patient with persistent coma or a persistent vegetative state, spending time with the patient's family and/or close acquaintances to explain what is happening (and what is likely

to happen), is as vital as patient care. These people will look to you for guidance in making endof-life decisions, and avoiding *the conspiracy of silence* (36) is one of the greatest services you can perform as a physician.
