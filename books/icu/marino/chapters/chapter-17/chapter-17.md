# **Inflammatory Shock Syndromes**

*Inflammation is not itself considered a disease but a salutary operation… but when it cannot accomplish that salutary purpose… it does mischief.*

John Hunter, MD (*[a](#page-16-0)*)

The introductory quote is from an 18th-Century British surgeon with an insatiable curiosity, who was known for his frequent grave-robbing soirees (for research material), and for a reckless selfexperiment in which he inoculated himself with the purulent discharge from a patient with venereal disease, and subsequently developed both gonorrhea and syphilis [\(1](#page-16-1)). On a more positive note, John Hunter wrote the first definitive work on inflammation, where he noted that inflammation has two opposing "faces" (like a Janus face): i.e. it normally acts to promote healing from tissue injury or infection, but it can also become a *source* of tissue injury [\(2](#page-16-2)). Fastforward over two hundred years, and the destructive face of inflammation has emerged as a major factor in a multitude of diseases, from acute (e.g., asthma) to chronic (e.g., atherosclerosis) to age-related (e.g., Alzheimer's) conditions.

This chapter describes three life-threatening conditions where inflammation plays a major role; i.e., septic shock, toxic shock, and anaphylactic shock. These conditions are examples of what happens when inflammation "does mischief".

# **INFLAMMATORY INJURY**

The inflammatory response is a complex affair that is designed to eliminate external threats (e.g., from invading microbes) and to "cleanse" and heal damaged tissues. This operation is not typically harmful to the host, however severe or persistent inflammation can produce widespread tissue injury. Inflammatory tissue injury is especially problematic because it can become selfsustaining; i.e., the inflammatory injury can trigger another inflammatory response, which will produce more tissue injury, and so on. This condition of progressive inflammatory injury is known as *malignant inflammation*, and it plays a major role in the multiorgan failure that can complicate septic shock (see later) [\(3](#page-16-3)[,4](#page-16-4)).

#### **Neutrophil Activation**

In the initial stage of the inflammatory response, circulating neutrophils experience a precipitous rise in cellular O<sup>2</sup> consumption (up to 20-fold) that lasts for 15–20 minutes ([5\)](#page-16-5). This is known as the *respiratory burst*, which is a misnomer, because the surge in O<sup>2</sup> consumption is not dedicated to the production of high-energy ATP molecules (i.e., cell respiration). Instead, the respiratory burst generates noxious chemical derivatives of oxygen that are used to kill invading microbes ([5\)](#page-16-5).

The reactions involved in the respiratory burst are shown in [Figure](#page-2-0) 17.1. The trigger for this reaction sequence is activation of a specialized enzyme (NADPH oxidase) on the cell membrane, which initiates a series of reactions that adds electrons (one at a time) to oxygen. This generates a series of highly-reactive intermediates that include the *superoxide radical, hydrogen peroxide and the hydroxyl radical*. (A radical is an atom or molecule with an unpaired electron.) Neutrophils also have a myeloperoxidase enzyme that converts hydrogen peroxide to *hypochlorite*, a powerful germicidal agent that is the active ingredient in household bleach. These *reactive oxygen species* (ROS) are stored in cytoplasmic granules, and are released during neutrophil degranulation.

**FIGURE 17.1** The sequence of reactions involved in the activation of neutrophils, which generates a series of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are used to kill invading microbes. Free radicals are indicated by a superscripted dot. See text for further explanation.

The ROS are powerful oxidizing agents that are lethal for invading microbes. The role of

ROS in eradicating infectious organisms is demonstrated by a condition known as *chronic granulomatous disease*. This is a rare genetic disorder (with an incidence of 1:200,000 births in U.S.) in which the NADPH oxidase enzyme in neutrophils is defective, and patients with this disorder suffer from recurrent and life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections ([6\)](#page-16-6).

### **Oxidant Injury**

ROS are also capable of damaging the tissues of the host, including the extracellular matrix, parenchymal cells, and the endothelium and its protective glycocalyx ([7–](#page-16-7)[9\)](#page-16-8). The oxidizing effects of ROS can damage all vital cell components, including membrane lipids, all types of cellular proteins, and DNA molecules. This *oxidant injury* occurs when ROS activity exceeds the protective actions of endogenous antioxidants; a condition known as *oxidant stress*.

(*Note:* The destructive actions of oxygen on organic matter is evident when you consider why food is stored in vacuum-sealed containers, and why you wrap your sandwiches in cellophane.)

Inflammatory tissues are flooded with ROS, and the superoxide radical has been implicated as the source of inflammatory pain ([10\)](#page-16-9). Oxidant tissue injury usually begins to appear when the inflammation is persistent or progressive (possibly due to depletion of protective antioxidants). Furthermore, hydrogen peroxide moves freely through tissues, and can enter the bloodstream and reach distant organs, where it can enter cells and generate hydroxyl radicals when it encounters iron in the reduced state (Fe2+) (see [Figure](#page-2-0) 17.1). This is one possible mechanism for the multiorgan failure that can develop in patients with inflammatory lung injury (see Chapter 24), or sepsis (see later), as well as the postresuscitation syndrome after a cardiac arrest (see Chapter 21), which is a type of disseminated reperfusion injury.

### *Endothelial Dysfunction*

Like neutrophils, endothelial cells are equipped with a NADPH oxidase enzyme that is activated in the early stages of the inflammatory response, and the resulting production of ROS is instrumental in promoting leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and the migration of leukocytes into the tissues [\(11](#page-16-10)). However, inflammation also promotes endothelial dysfunction from oxidant stress ([12\)](#page-16-11), and this leads to increased capillary permeability and edema formation.

Oxidant stress at the endothelial level also reduces nitric oxide levels via the following reaction ([13\)](#page-16-12):

<span id="page-3-0"></span>
$$O_2 \cdot + NO \cdot \rightarrow ONOO^-$$
 (17.1)

where O<sup>2</sup> ∙ is the superoxide radical, NO∙ is nitric oxide, and ONOO– is peroxynitrite. This reaction not only eliminates the beneficial actions of nitric oxide in promoting circulatory blood flow, it also generates a potent oxidative toxin (peroxynitrite) capable of extensive tissue injury ([13\)](#page-16-12).

### **Inflammatory Organ Injury**

Inflammation can damage any of the vital organs, but the organs most often affected are listed in [Table](#page-4-0) 17.1. These conditions pertain only to the inflammatory injury that occurs in critically ill patients, and they do not include the multitude of diseases caused by chronic inflammatory injury (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, chronic obstructive lung disease). The most notable example of

inflammatory organ injury in critically ill patients is the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a leading cause of acute respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation. (ARDS is the focus of Chapter 24.)

The morbidity and mortality associated with inflammatory organ injury is not only related to the severity of involvement in individual organs, but also to the number of organs involved. This latter relationship is shown in [Figure](#page-4-1) 17.2, which includes surveys from the United States [\(14](#page-16-13)) and Europe ([15\)](#page-16-14) showing a direct relationship between the mortality rate and the number of organ failures related to inflammation.

### **SEPTIC SHOCK**

Sepsis is responsible for one of every 2 to 3 in-hospital deaths in the United States [\(16](#page-16-15)), and one of every 5 deaths worldwide [\(17](#page-16-16)). The mortality rate varies by age and geographic locale: for septic shock in the United State, the mortality rate is about 30% when it is present on admission, and about 50% when it develops after admission [\(18](#page-16-17)). Despite the presumption of sepsis as infection, *the mortality rate in sepsis is not related to the causative organism, including multidrug-resistant organisms* ([19\)](#page-16-18). This observation is consistent with the notion that the major problem in sepsis is not the infection, but the host response to infection (see next).

### **Definitions**

The current definitions of sepsis and septic shock are summarized below [\(20](#page-16-19)).

- 1. Sepsis is an infection (suspected or confirmed) that is associated with life-threatening organ dysfunction, and is the result of a dysregulated host response to infection.
- 2. Septic shock is a subset of sepsis that is characterized by the need for vasopressor support, and by a plasma lactate >2 mmol/L.

These definitions were introduced in 2016, and they replaced the prior definitions established in 1992 ([21\)](#page-16-20), which defined sepsis as an infection that was accompanied by a systemic inflammatory response (i.e., fever, leukocytosis, etc.) [\(21](#page-16-20)), with the latter condition being elevated to a syndrome; i.e., the "systemic inflammatory response syndrome", or SIRS. However, SIRS is a nonspecific finding in critically ill patients, as fewer than 50% of patients with SIRS have a documented infection ([22,](#page-16-21)[23\)](#page-16-22), so SIRS was abandoned as a diagnostic criterion for sepsis. However, the definition of sepsis continues to be problematic, as explained next.

#### *A Better Definition*

The presence of infection is a central feature in the definition of sepsis and septic shock. However, there is often no documented infection in cases of sepsis; e.g., *in a survey of 2.5 million patients with sepsis and septic shock, there was no documented infection in 70% of the cases* [\(18](#page-16-17)). Since the clinical suspicion of infection in cases of sepsis is typically based on the presence of a systemic inflammatory response (fever, leukocytosis, etc.), it seems likely that *sepsis is a dysregulated host response to inflammation, not infection.*

## **Pathophysiology**

Regardless of whether the sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection or inflammation, septic shock is distinguished from sepsis by the presence of hemodynamic instability and mitochondrial dysfunction.

### *Hemodynamic Alterations*

The hemodynamic aberrations in septic shock are summarized below:

1. The principal hemodynamic problem is hypotension from systemic vasodilation. This has been attributed to the enhanced production of nitric oxide by the vascular endothelium [\(24](#page-16-23)), but the inactivation of nitric oxide by oxidant stress (see [Equation](#page-3-0) 17.1) suggests the involvement of

other factors.

- 2. Oxidant injury in the vascular endothelium leads to fluid extravasation and hypovolemia, which aggravates the hypotension.
- 3. Proinflammatory cytokines promote cardiac dysfunction (both systolic and diastolic dysfunction), but the cardiac output is usually increased as a result of tachycardia and a decrease in left ventricular afterload (from vasodilation) [\(25](#page-16-24)). The cardiac output begins to decline in the advanced stages of shock, which carries a poor prognosis.
- 4. Despite the increased cardiac output, splanchnic blood flow is typically reduced in septic shock ([24\)](#page-16-23). This can lead to disruption of the bowel mucosa and translocation of enteric pathogens into the systemic circulation, which aggravates the problem.

Because of the high cardiac output and peripheral vasodilation, septic shock is also known as *hyperdynamic shock* or *warm shock*.

#### *Mitochondrial Dysfunction*

The organ dysfunction in sepsis and septic shock is attributed to a defect in the production of high-energy ATP molecules in mitochondria ([26,](#page-16-25)[27\)](#page-16-26). This condition is attributed to oxidative damage in the electron transport chain (28), and to cytokine-mediated inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase, the enzyme that facilitates the entry of pyruvate into mitochondria (see Figure 9.5) (29). The resulting decrease in O<sup>2</sup> usage in mitochondria would explain the observation shown in [Figure](#page-7-0) 17.3, where the PO<sup>2</sup> in skeletal muscle is *increased* in patients with severe sepsis (30).

The decrease in mitochondrial O<sup>2</sup> consumption in sepsis is not consistent with the observed increase in whole-body O<sup>2</sup> consumption in patients with sepsis. This discrepancy can be resolved by proposing that the increased O<sup>2</sup> consumption in sepsis is a reflection of the marked increase in O<sup>2</sup> consumption that occurs during neutrophil activation (31).

<span id="page-7-0"></span>![](_page_7_Figure_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 17.3** Direct measurements of tissue PO<sup>2</sup> in the forearm muscles of healthy volunteers and patients with severe sepsis. The height of the columns represents the mean value for each group, and the crossbars represent the standard error of the mean. Data from Reference 30.

**IMPLICATIONS:** The mitochondrial dysfunction in sepsis and septic shock has two very important implications:

- 1. Since tissue O<sup>2</sup> levels are not impaired in septic shock, the liberal use of supplemental O<sup>2</sup> to promote tissue oxygenation is not justified, and could be harmful (by promoting oxidant stress).
- 2. The increase in plasma lactate levels in septic shock is not the result of inadequate tissue oxygenation. Instead, the emerging paradigm is that lactate production increases during periods of metabolic stress, where lactate serves as an alternative energy source (see Table 9.6).

## **Monitoring**

The approach to monitoring in patients with clinical shock is described in Chapter 14, but the following information about septic shock deserves mention.

- 1. The decrease in mitochondrial O<sup>2</sup> usage in septic shock is associated with a decrease in O<sup>2</sup> extraction from the microcirculation (i.e., a decrease in the arteriovenous O<sup>2</sup> saturation difference) As a result, the central venous O<sup>2</sup> saturation (ScvO<sup>2</sup> ) will be inappropriately increased, and will be misleading as a measure of the adequacy of O<sup>2</sup> delivery. (Oxygen extraction is described in Chapter 9.)
- 2. The PCO<sup>2</sup> gap is not influenced by systemic oxygenation, and can be useful for identifying tissue hypoperfusion (see Chapter 14).
- 3. Although lactate is not a marker of anaerobic metabolism in septic shock, plasma lactate levels

have prognostic significance (see Figure 9.4), and normalization of lactate levels is an important goal of management.

### **Management**

The initial management of septic shock is outlined in [Table](#page-8-0) 17.2, using recommendations from the most recent clinical practice guidelines (32).

#### *Volume Resuscitation*

Volume infusion should be the initial intervention in any patient with a shock syndrome. The recommended fluid regimen for septic shock is 30 mL/kg (ideal body weight) of a crystalloid fluid, infused within the first 3 hours of diagnosis (32). The need for repeat fluid boluses should be guided by an assessment of fluid responsiveness (see Chapter 11).

The liberal infusion of fluids is commonplace in septic shock, but fluid accumulation has a negative impact on survival (33,34). Therefore, after the initial period of volume resuscitation, the daily infusion of fluids should be adjusted to match daily fluid losses, as this will increase the likelihood of a successful outcome.

#### *Vasopressors*

If hypotension persists after the initial volume resuscitation, infusion of a vasoconstrictor drug (vasopressor) should begin. If necessary, vasopressor infusions can begin in a peripheral vein above the antecubital fossa in the arm (32). Transition to central venous access is recommended as soon as possible, although vasopressor infusions through midline catheters have continued for 7 days without harm (35).

<sup>†</sup>From Reference 32.

**PREFERRED AGENTS:** (*Note:* Vasopressor agents are described in Chapter 14, and Table 14.4 includes the dosing range of each agent.) *Norepinephrine is the initial vasopressor of choice in septic shock*. If the hypotension persists despite a norepinephrine dose of 0.25–0.5 μg/kg/min (18–35 μg/min in a 70 kg adult), then vasopressin should be added, and if the hypotension is refractory to norepinephrine and vasopressin, epinephrine is recommended as a third vasopressor

(32). The goal of vasopressor therapy is a mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥65 mm Hg.

**COMMENTS:** The following comments about the current vasopressor recommendations deserve mention.

- 1. Norepinephrine has immunosuppressant effects, according to studies showing that the production of proinflammatory cytokines is suppressed during norepinephrine infusions in both laboratory animal and humans (36). The clinical significance of this effect is unclear at present, but it certainly raises a red flag about the recommendation to use norepinephrine in septic shock.
- 2. The recommendation for multiple vasopressors in vasopressor-refractory shock should be questioned, as there is no convincing evidence that the addition of vasopressin or a third vasopressor improves outcomes in septic shock (37,38).

#### *Corticosteroids*

Corticosteroids have two actions that are potentially beneficial in septic shock: they have antiinflammatory activity, and they facilitate the vasoconstrictor response to catecholamines. However, innumerable studies since the 1960s have failed to produce convincing evidence that corticosteroids improve outcomes in septic shock (39). Yet steroids continue to be popular in septic shock, as shown by the following recommendation from the most recent guidelines on septic shock (32), which is based on a single meta-analysis showing that corticosteroids hastened the resolution of septic shock (by 1.5 days), but without improving the survival rate (40).

- 1. Corticosteroid therapy is suggested for patients with septic shock who are receiving norepinephrine or epinephrine at a dose ≥0.25 μg/kg/min.
- 2. The recommended regimen is IV hydrocortisone in a dose of 50 mg every 6 hours (200 mg daily). There is no recommendation for the duration of treatment, but most clinical studies use a treatment period of about 7 days.

The love affair with corticosteroids in septic shock continues.

#### *Antimicrobial Therapy*

Prompt initiation of antimicrobial therapy is considered a cornerstone of management in septic shock. The current recommendation is that *antimicrobial therapy should begin within 1 hour of presentation* (32). This doesn't leave much time to identify an infection, but it is important to obtain appropriate cultures (blood, urine, etc.) prior to the first dose of antimicrobial agent.

**BLOOD CULTURES:** At least 2 sets of blood cultures are recommended, using two separate venipuncture sites (one set can be obtained from an indwelling catheter). Two sets of blood cultures will detect about 90% of bloodstream infections, while 3 sets will detect close to 98% of bloodstream infections (41). The yield from blood cultures is influenced by the volume of blood that is cultured, and a volume of at least 20 mL is recommended for each set of blood cultures (42).

**EMPIRIC COVERAGE:** Empiric antibiotic coverage should have a broad spectrum of activity (e.g.,

piperacillin/tazobactam), and coverage for methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA) (with vancomycin or daptomycin) should be added if the patient has a prior history of MRSA infections, or MRSA infections are prevalent in the hospital. This can be discontinued if all cultures are negative for MRSA, including a nasal swab. If infection with a multidrug-resistant organism is suspected, empiric therapy should include two antimicrobial agents with gramnegative coverage (e.g., cefepime plus piperacillin/tazobactam). Antibiotics should be discontinued if all cultures are negative and there is no other evidence of infection (32).

#### *Goals*

The immediate goals of management are similar to the ones described for clinical shock in Chapter 14 (see Table 14.5). These goals include improvements in tissue perfusion (e.g., PCO<sup>2</sup> gap <6 mm Hg) and in end-organ function (e.g., increase in urine output to >0.5 mL/kg/hr), and normalization of the plasma lactate level (<2 mmol/L).

## **TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME**

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a specialized form of septic shock that is caused by toxinproducing strains of *Staphylococcus aureus* and *Streptococcus pyogenes* (group A streptococci), and is characterized by rapidly progressive multiorgan failure. There are differences in the TSS associated with staphylococci and streptococci, and these are shown in [Table](#page-11-0) 17.3.

### **Pathogenesis**

The toxins released by the responsible microbes are capable of activating T-cell lymphocytes on a massive scale, creating a "cytokine storm" that is capable of widespread inflammatory injury. The culmination of this process is multiorgan failure and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC).

The hemodynamic changes in TSS are similar to those in septic shock, with hypotension as a result of systemic vasodilation . Disruption of the endothelium is pronounced in TSS, and the resulting fluid extravasation can lead to profound hypovolemia.

### *Staphylococcal TSS*

Staphylococcal TSS can arise from colonization or invasive infection, and the responsible organism can be methicillin-sensitive or methicillin-resistant organisms (although the former is more frequently involved). About 40% of cases occur during menstruation (43), presumably as a result of vaginal colonization with toxin-producing staphylococci, combined with disruption of the vaginal mucosa from tampon use. Non-menstrual cases can arise from soft tissue infections such as surgical wound infections and subcutaneous abscesses. There is no identifiable infection in about 35% of cases (44).

### *Streptococcal TSS*

Streptococcal TSS is a complication of invasive group A streptococcal infections, most notably necrotizing fasciitis, myositis, and postpartum sepsis (puerperal fever). There is no identifiable infection in almost half of the cases (45).

### **Clinical Presentation**

TSS typically begins with an influenza-like illness (i.e., fever, myalgias, lethargy), often associated with diarrhea and a diffuse erythematous rash (resembles a sunburn) that involves the palms and soles. (Desquamation of the skin appears after 2 to 3 weeks.) This progresses within 48 hours to hypotension and involvement of multiple organs that can include the central nervous system (altered mentation) lungs (acute respiratory distress syndrome), kidneys (acute kidney injury), liver (elevated transaminases and bilirubin), skeletal muscle (rhabdomyolysis) and the hematopoietic system (DIC). Cyanosis of the distal extremities can appear, and fluid extravasation through leaky capillaries can produce nonpitting edema.

Soft tissue infections involving group A streptococci can produce severe pain (usually in the limbs, abdomen, or pelvis) without associated findings on physical examination. Pain that is out of proportion to the physical exam should raise suspicion for a deep-seated streptococcal infection.

#### *Diagnosis*

Any case of septic shock associated with an erythematous rash and rapid-onset multiorgan failure should raise suspicion for TSS, especially if there is an association with menstruation or pregnancy. However, the rash in TSS can be subtle and fleeting (46), and TSS can be mistaken for a severe case of septic shock with multiorgan failure.

Blood cultures are positive in only 5% of cases of staphylococcal TSS (43), so the diagnosis relies heavily on an association with menstruation, and any evidence of a staphylococcal infection (e.g., subcutaneous abscesses). Blood cultures have a higher yield in streptococcal TSS, and are positive in about 60% of cases (43). In cases where a streptococcal soft tissue infection is suspected, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can help to uncover a covert fasciitis, and bedside ultrasound is a suitable alternative for patients that are too unstable for transport to the MRI suite.

## **Management**

The hemodynamic management of TSS is similar to that described for septic shock, with aggressive volume resuscitation followed by vasopressors if needed. Most patients with TSS also require intubation and mechanical ventilation (47).

#### *Antimicrobial Therapy*

The rapidly progressive nature of TSS emphasizes the need for rapid initiation of antibiotic therapy. Empiric antibiotic coverage should include a broad-spectrum agent (e.g., piperacillin/tazobactam or meropenem) and enhanced gram-positive coverage with vancomycin, plus clindamycin (46). The latter agent is used in all cases of TSS because of its ability to inhibit toxin production (48). Targeted antibiotic therapy for staphylococcal and streptococcal TSS is shown in [Table](#page-11-0) 17.3.

### *Source Control*

Removing the primary source is an important component of the management of TSS. For staphylococcal TSS, this includes removing tampons and intrauterine devices, eradicating nasal colonization, and draining any identified abscesses. For streptococcal TSS, debridement of necrotizing soft tissue infections is imperative for a successful outcome.

#### *Outcomes*

Most patients survive staphylococcal TSS: the mortality rate is <2% in cases associated with menstruation, and 6% in nonmenstrual cases (46). Streptococcal TSS has far fewer survivors, with a mortality rate of 35% (47).

# **ANAPHYLAXIS**

Anaphylaxis is an acute multiorgan dysfunction syndrome produced by the immunogenic release of inflammatory mediators from basophils and mast cells. The characteristic feature is an exaggerated immunoglobulin E (IgE) response to an external antigen; i.e., a *hypersensitivity reaction*. These reactions typically involve the skin, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and cardiovascular system, and common triggers include drugs (especially antimicrobial agents), food, and insect bites. Contrary to popular perception, deaths from anaphylaxis are rare, with a mortality rate of 0.25%–0.33% (49).

### **Clinical Features**

Anaphylactic reactions typically appear within minutes of exposure to an external trigger, and they can recur within 72 hours of the initial episode (biphasic anaphylaxis) (49). A characteristic feature of these reactions is edema and swelling in the involved organ, which is the result of an increase in vascular permeability. The clinical manifestations of anaphylactic reactions are shown in [Table](#page-13-0) 17.4 (50). Common manifestations include urticaria, subcutaneous angioedema (typically involving the face), flushing, angioedema of the upper airway (e.g., laryngeal edema) and bronchospasm. The most feared manifestation is hypotension (i.e., anaphylactic shock), and the most overlooked manifestation is an acute coronary syndrome (see next).

|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Manifestation            | Frequency of Occurence                        |
| Urticaria and angioedema | 60–90%                                        |
| Upper airway angioedema  | 50–60%                                        |
| Flushing                 | 45–55%                                        |

From Reference 50.

#### *Allergic Coronary Insufficiency*

The association of anaphylaxis and acute coronary syndromes (the Kounis Syndrome) is attributed to coronary vasospasm (in 73% of cases), coronary artery plaque rupture (in 22% of cases) and coronary stent thrombosis (in 5% of cases) (51). The presumed mechanisms include the release of vasoactive substances from mast cell degranulation, and platelet activation. Coronary vasospasm is the most common underlying mechanism, and occurs predominantly in younger patients with no history of coronary artery disease. Cardiac symptoms usually appear within one hour of the anaphylactic reaction (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm), and can include fleeting chest pains (from coronary spasm) or ST-elevation myocardial infarction (from plaque rupture or stent thrombosis).

### **Treatment**

The treatment of anaphylaxis includes one drug that halts the reaction (epinephrine), and drugs that alleviate symptoms (antihistamines, bronchodilators).

#### *Epinephrine*

Epinephrine blocks the release of inflammatory mediators from sensitized basophils and mast cells, and is *the only drug capable of stopping an anaphylactic reaction* (50). It is available in a confusing array of aqueous solutions, which are shown in [Table](#page-13-1) 17.5. The optimal epinephrine dose for anaphylaxis is unknown, but the usual dose in adults is 0.3–0.5 mg (0.3–0.5 mL of 1:1000 solution) given by deep intramuscular (IM) injection in the anterolateral thigh, and repeated every 5–15 minutes if necessary (50). Drug absorption is slower with subcutaneous injection (52). Epinephrine can be nebulized for laryngeal edema using the dosing regimen in [Table](#page-13-1) 17.5, but the efficacy of this regimen is unclear.

<span id="page-13-1"></span>

|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Aqueous<br>Dilution | Condition                                                               | Dosing Regimen |
|                     |                                                                         |                |

| 1:1,000 (1<br>mg/mL)    | Anaphylaxis           | 0.3–0.5 mL (mg) by deep IM injection in the thigh every 5–15 min as<br>needed.               |

| 1:100,000 (10<br>µg/mL) | Anaphylactic<br>Shock | Add 2 mL of 1:1000 solution (2 mg) to 200 mL saline (10 µg/mL) and<br>infuse at 5–15 µg/min. |

From Reference 53.

**GLUCAGON:** The inhibitory actions of epinephrine on mast cell degranulation are mediated by βadrenergic receptors, and ongoing therapy with β-receptor antagonists can attenuate or eliminate the response to epinephrine. When anaphylactic reactions are refractory to epinephrine in patients receiving β-blocker drugs, glucagon can be effective in restoring responsiveness (for reasons described in Chapter 52). The dose of glucagon is 1–5 mg by slow intravenous injection (over 5 min), followed by a continuous infusion at 5–15 µg/min, titrated to the desired response (53). Glucagon can trigger vomiting, and patients with depressed consciousness should be placed on their side when glucagon is administered, to limit the risk of aspiration.

#### *Second-Line Agents*

The following drugs are used for symptom relief, and do not alter the course of the illness. They are given after epinephrine is administered, and should never be used as a replacement for epinephrine.

**ANTIHISTAMINES:** Histamine receptor antagonists are used to relieve the pruritis and rhinorrhea associated with anaphylactic reactions (although their efficacy is unproven). The histamine H<sup>1</sup> blocker *diphenhydramine* (25–50 mg PO, IM, or IV) and the histamine-H<sup>2</sup> blocker *ranitidine* (50 mg IV or 150 mg PO) are considered equivalent in efficacy, but combination therapy produces the best results (54).

**BRONCHODILATORS:** Inhaled β<sup>2</sup> -receptor agonists like *albuterol* are used to relieve bronchospasm, and are administered by nebulizer (2.5 mL of a 0.5% solution) or by metereddose inhaler (54).

#### *Corticosteroids*

Corticosteroids have enjoyed a longstanding popularity in the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, and they are sometimes preferred to epinephrine for the acute management of anaphylaxis (54). However, there is no evidence that corticosteroids are effective in reversing, slowing, or preventing the recurrence of anaphylactic reactions (49,50,54). This is reflected in the following statement from a clinical practice guideline on anaphylaxis (50): "*The use of corticosteroids has no role in the acute management of anaphylaxis*".

### **Anaphylactic Shock**

Anaphylactic shock is characterized by the same hemodynamic abnormalities described earlier

for septic shock, but the hypotension in anaphylactic shock can be more pronounced because of the exaggerated fluid loss through leaky capillaries. Management includes intravenous epinephrine and aggressive volume resuscitation.

#### *Epinephrine*

There is no standardized dosing regimen for epinephrine in anaphylactic shock, but the dose rate of 5–15 µg/min in [Table](#page-13-1) 17.5 has been cited for its efficacy (53). A bolus dose of 10 µg IV can precede the drug infusion, and can be repeated periodically if needed to maintain the mean arterial pressure at ≥65 mm Hg (54).

#### *Volume Resuscitation*

Aggressive volume resuscitation is essential in anaphylactic shock because as much as 35% of the intravascular volume can be lost through leaky capillaries (53), which is enough to produce hypovolemic shock (see Table 15.1). Volume resuscitation can begin by infusing 1–2 liters of a crystalloid fluid (or 20–30 mL/kg), or 500 mL of 5% albumin, over the first 5–10 minutes (53). Thereafter, fluid management should be tailored to the clinical condition of the patient. Considering adding a colloid fluid (e.g., 5% albumin) to your volume regimen, since the severity of the capillary leak in anaphylactic shock will ensure that most of the infused crystalloid fluid will move out of the vascular compartment and add to the edema.

#### *Refractory Hypotension*

For hypotension that persists despite epinephrine and volume resuscitation, give glucagon if the patient has received a β blocker recently. Otherwise, add a second vasopressor like norepinephrine or phenylephrine (vasopressin has not been evaluated in anaphylactic shock). The prognosis in this situation is poor.

# **A FINAL WORD**

### **Inflammation (not hypoxia) as the Major Cause of Death in ICUs**

The following information is a spinoff of the information presented in A FINAL WORD in Chapter 9, which is titled "Is cellular hypoxia a common cause of death?" The observations presented in this chapter, which are summarized in the statements below, provide evidence that inflammation, not cellular hypoxia, is the most common cause of death in the hospital.

- 1. Septic shock is the leading cause of in-hospital deaths in the United States [\(16](#page-16-15)).
- 2. The source of organ failure in septic shock is mitochondrial dysfunction, not inadequate tissue oxygenation (see [Figure](#page-7-0) 17.3), and the source of the mitochondrial dysfunction is inflammation.

The apparent role of inflammation in fatal outcomes creates doubt about the emphasis on promoting tissue oxygenation (e.g., with O<sup>2</sup> inhalation and RBC transfusions) in critically ill patients. In fact, since the damaging effects of inflammation are largely due to oxidation, promoting tissue oxygenation may have an effect that is diametrically opposed to what is

#### intended. More on this in Chapter 25 (Oxygen Therapy).
