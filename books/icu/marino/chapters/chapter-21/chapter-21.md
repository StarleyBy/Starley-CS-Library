# **Cardiac Arrest**

*When we all think alike, then no one is thinking.*

Walter Lippmann (*[a](#page-14-0)*)

In 1960, a report appeared in the *Journal of the American Medical Association* that would eventually change the way we approach the dying process. The report was titled "Closed Chest Cardiac Massage" [\(1](#page-14-1)), and it included 5 cases of cardiorespiratory arrest that were successfully managed with chest compressions, electrical shocks, and assisted ventilation. That same year (and without any validation studies), the American Heart Association started a program to educate physicians about closed-chest cardiac resuscitation, which eventually grew to become *cardiopulmonary resuscitation* (CPR). Since its inception, CPR has become a universally mandated practice that is withheld only on request, and requires certification every 2 years to ensure the competence of practitioners. And all this for a treatment modality that fails in most cases, as shown in [Table](#page-0-0) 21.1 [\(2](#page-14-2)).

This chapter describes the practical aspects of CPR, and the management that follows a successful resuscitation effort. The recommendations in this chapter are taken from the most recent and most relevant guidelines and instruction manuals on CPR, which are listed in the bibliography at the end of the chapter ([3–](#page-14-3)[8\)](#page-14-4).

# **BASIC LIFE SUPPORT**

The elements of basic life support (BLS) are chest compressions, and periodic lung inflations through a patent upper airway. The priority for these elements is indicated by the popular mnemonic *CAB* (Circulation, Airway, and Breathing).

## **Time Dependence**

One of the major limiting factors in the success of CPR is the narrow time window between the cessation of blood flow and irreversible cell death. The total O<sup>2</sup> content of the adult human body is about one liter, and with a normal O<sup>2</sup> consumption of about 250 mL/min at rest, this leaves only about 4 minutes after the cessation of blood flow until the O<sup>2</sup> content of the body is completely depleted. Thus, *following the cessation of blood flow from a cardiac arrest, anoxic cell death is expected in just 4–5 minutes*. (One exception to this is cold-water drowning, where the cold temperatures will reduce O<sup>2</sup> consumption and prolong the time for anoxic cell injury.) This emphasizes the "need for speed" in initiating CPR.

# <span id="page-1-0"></span>**TABLE 21.2 The Essential Elements of Basic Life Support**

- 1. Chest compressions should begin within 10 seconds of detecting the absence of pulses.
- 2. Each chest compression should depress the lower third of the sternum by 2–2.4 inches (5–6 cm), and the chest should be allowed to recoil completely before the next compression.
- 3. The rate of compressions should be 100–120/minute.
- 4. After 30 chest compressions, 2 lung inflations are delivered (with a bag-mask device) without interrupting the compressions, and this (30:2) cycle is repeated until the patient is intubated.

- 5. Following intubation, lung inflations are delivered every 6 seconds (10/min) without interrupting chest compressions. However, simultaneous chest compressions and lung inflations should be avoided.
- 6. Chest compressions should be continued without interruption until a defibrillator is attached to the patient.
- 7. Each person performing chest compressions should be relieved after 2 minutes, if possible.

## **Overview**

The trigger for CPR is the absence of pulses in an unresponsive patient who has minimal or no spontaneous breathing efforts. Chest compressions should begin within 10 seconds of this trigger, using the depth and frequency of compressions shown in [Table](#page-1-0) 21.2. Two lung inflations should be delivered (with a bag-mask device) after every 30 chest compressions, without interrupting the compressions [\(3](#page-14-3)[–5](#page-14-5)). After an endotracheal (ET) tube is placed, lung inflations are delivered at 6-second intervals (10/min) without interrupting chest compressions. However, simultaneous chest compression and lung inflation will limit the inflation volume, and should be avoided [\(4](#page-14-6)). Finally, an ECG monitor/defibrillator should be attached to the patient as soon as possible.

#### **Chest Compressions**

The backbone of BLS is high-quality chest compressions with minimal interruptions. Observational studies have shown that interruptions in chest compressions can account for as much as 50% of the total resuscitation time ([9\)](#page-14-7), and prolonged interruptions could contribute to poor outcomes. Current recommendations are to continue chest compressions without interruptions until a defibrillator is attached to the patient. (Thereafter, compressions can be paused to deliver electric shocks, and to check the cardiac rhythm, as described later.)

#### *High-Quality Compressions*

High-quality chest compressions are defined as having a depth of 2–2.4 inches (5–6 cm) and a rate of 100 to 120/min, with full chest recoil allowed between compressions [\(3](#page-14-3)[–5](#page-14-5)). Estimating the depth of compressions is difficult, especially with a target range of only 0.4 inches. There are devices used for CPR training that measure the depth of compression and provide audio feedback (e.g., using the sometimes irritating prompt, "push harder"), but they are not available for clinical use. Fatigue can influence the depth of compressions, and each person performing compressions should be replaced after 2 minutes, if possible ([4,](#page-14-6)[5\)](#page-14-5).

# **Lung Inflations**

Lung inflations are delivered by compressing a self-inflating ventilation bag (e.g., Ambu Respirator) that fills with oxygen. The recommended volume for each lung inflation is 500–600 mL, or whatever produces a visible rise in the chest wall [\(4](#page-14-6)). However, inflation volumes are not monitored during "bagged ventilation", and large inflation volumes are common during CPR ([10\)](#page-14-8), which can be damaging for the lungs (similar to "ventilator-induced lung injury", which is described in Chapter 24). Closer adherence to the recommended inflation volumes is possible if the volume capacity of the inflation bags in known. For example, if the inflation bag has a volume capacity of 1 liter, compressing the bag until it is about half full will deliver a volume of

about 500 mL. (The volume capacity of most adult ventilation bags is 1 to 2 liters.) An alternative approach is to use one hand to compress the ventilation bag, which delivers a volume of about 600 to 700 mL (personal observation), and is unlikely to produce troublesome lung inflations.

#### *Rapid Lung Inflations*

Rapid lung inflations are common during CPR [\(11](#page-14-9)[,12](#page-14-10)), and average rates of 30 inflations/min (3 times the recommended rate) have been reported ([12\)](#page-14-10). Rapid breathing is problematic because there is insufficient time for the lungs to empty, which leads to progressive hyperinflation and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The PEEP that is produced by rapid breathing is called "intrinsic PEEP", and is described in detail in Chapter 23. The increase in mean intrathoracic pressure from PEEP has two deleterious effects: 1) it reduces venous return to the heart, which limits the ability of chest compressions to augment cardiac output, and 2) it reduces coronary perfusion pressure ([11\)](#page-14-9), which is an important determinant of outcome in cardiac arrest. For these reasons, avoiding rapid inflation rates will increase the chances for a favorable outcome with CPR.

## **Vascular Access**

Vascular access should be established without interrupting chest compressions. Peripheral venous access is considered suitable [\(4](#page-14-6)), but intraosseous access is often favored because it is easy to establish without interrupting chest compressions, and is more secure than a peripheral vein catheter. (See Chapter 1 for a description of intraosseous access.)

# **ADVANCED LIFE SUPPORT**

Advanced cardiovascular life support (ACLS) includes electrical cardioversion (defibrillation) and the use of drugs that support the resuscitation attempt. This approach divides the management of cardiac arrest into two pathways: one for the management of ventricular fibrillation (VF) and pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT), and the other for pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and asystole.

#### **VF and Pulseless VT**

The principal intervention for VF and pulseless VT is electrical "defibrillation", and hence these arrhythmias are referred to as "shockable rhythms".

#### *Defibrillation*

Electrical cardioversion that uses asynchronous shocks (i.e., not timed to the QRS complex) is called *defibrillation*, and it is one of the few interventions that improves survival in cardiac arrest victims. However, the survival benefit is time-dependent. This is shown in [Figure](#page-4-0) 21.1, which is from a study of the relationship between survival and the time (from collapse) to defibrillation in cardiac arrests associated with VF or VT ([13\)](#page-14-11). Note that 40% of patients survived when the first shock was delivered 5 minutes after the arrest, while fewer than 10% of patients survived if defibrillation was delayed until 20 minutes after the arrest.

<span id="page-4-0"></span>![](_page_4_Figure_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 21.1** Relationship between survival and time (from collapse) to first defibrillator shock in 1,667 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests associated with VF or pulseless VT. Data from Reference 13.

**IMPULSE ENERGY:** Modern defibrillators deliver biphasic shocks (which convert VF and VT at lower energy levels than monophasic shocks), and the effective energy level can vary from as low as 100 J to as high as 360 J, with higher energy levels needed for resistant or recurrent episodes of VF/VT [\(14](#page-14-12)). Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) usually deliver fixed-energy shocks, while other defibrillators either have a pre-selected energy level for shocks, or allow the user to select the desired energy level.

#### *Management Algorithm*

The ACLS algorithm for cardiac arrest in adults is shown in [Figure](#page-6-0) 21.2 ([8\)](#page-14-4), and the left side of the flow diagram indicates the management when the initial rhythm is VF or VT. The major features of the management are summarized below.

- 1. The management includes a series of 3 defibrillation attempts, if needed. The initial shock is usually 120–200 J for biphasic shocks (or is manufacturer-recommended). If this is ineffective, a higher energy level can be used for subsequent shocks, if allowed by the defibrillator.
- 2. Chest compressions are paused when the defibrillation shock is delivered, and are resumed immediately thereafter. At least 2 minutes of uninterrupted chest compressions are recommended after defibrillation before checking the post-shock rhythm.
- 3. If a second defibrillation is needed, *epinephrine* is started using a bolus dose of 1 mg (intravenous or intraosseous) every 3–5 minutes for the duration of the resuscitation effort.
- 4. If a third defibrillation is needed, *amiodarone* is administered as a bolus dose of 300 mg (IV or IO), which can be followed by a second dose of 150 mg, if needed. If amiodarone is not available, *lidocaine* can be given in a initial dose of 1–1.5 mg/kg (IV or IO), followed by 0.5– 0.75 mg/kg every 5–10 min as needed, to a maximum dose of 3 mg/kg [\(8](#page-14-4)).

**SHOCK-RESISTANT CASES:** Failure of three defibrillation attempts to convert VT and VF has a

very poor prognosis, with a satisfactory outcome in only 5% of cases [\(15](#page-14-13)). Improved outcomes have been reported in shock-resistant VF/VT that is managed with emergency extracorporeal life support (ECMO) (16), and this approach is certainly a consideration if ECMO is available on a 24-hour basis.

### **Asystole / PEA**

The management of cardiac arrest associated with pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and ventricular asystole is shown on the right half of the ACLS algorithm in [Figure](#page-6-0) 21.2. The major intervention is vasopressor therapy with epinephrine using the same dosing regimen used for VF and pulseless VT. Defibrillation is not attempted unless the cardiac rhythm changes to VF or VT.

#### *Reversible Causes of PEA*

PEA has potentially reversible causes, which can be identified by the letter "T": i.e., Tension pneumothorax, pericardial Tamponade, venous Thromboembolism, and Thrombotic occlusion of the coronary arteries. Although there is little time for a diagnostic workup during a cardiac arrest, point-of-care ultrasound can be a valuable aid in uncovering some of these conditions (see later).

## **Epinephrine**

Epinephrine is the only circulatory-support drug that is used for CPR. Although it has been shown to increase the rate of return of spontaneous circulation (17), the impact on survival is not clear. Most studies show no improvement in survival associated with epinephrine (17,18), but there is one study that shows an increase in survival at 30 days (19), although many of the survivors were not mentally intact.

#### *Actions*

The benefit derived from epinephrine is the systemic vasoconstriction, which can increase flow in both the cerebral and coronary circulations. The increase in coronary blood flow is due to an increase in coronary perfusion pressure (the difference between aortic and right atrial pressures

between chest compressions). This is demonstrated in [Figure](#page-7-0) 21.3 (20). In this case, there is a 30% increase in coronary perfusion pressure following IV epinephrine, and the effect lasts at least 3 minutes (the recommended time interval between epinephrine doses).

<span id="page-7-0"></span>The disadvantage with epinephrine is the β-receptor-mediated cardiac stimulation, which can erase the benefit of increased coronary perfusion, and has also been implicated in postresuscitation heart failure (20).

# **RESUSCITATION MONITORING**

Monitoring for the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) has traditionally been limited to manual palpation for pulses, but this practice has a low sensitivity (21), and often requires interruption of chest compressions for extended periods of time (22). Ultrasound for carotid artery pulsations can speed the process of pulse detection (23), but also requires interruption of chest compressions. The end-tidal PCO<sup>2</sup> provides a more reliable (and physiological) evaluation of the circulation, and can be used to predict the likelihood of ROSC.

# **End-Tidal PCO<sup>2</sup>**

(The end-tidal PCO<sup>2</sup> measurement is described in detail in Chapter 7: see Figure 7.6.) The PCO<sup>2</sup> in exhaled gas at the end of expiration (end-tidal PCO<sup>2</sup> ) is a relection of the balance between ventilation and perfusion in the lungs. The end-tidal PCO<sup>2</sup> (ETCO<sup>2</sup> ) varies directly with changes in cardiac output relative to ventilation; i.e., *when alveolar ventilation is constant, changes in end-tidal PCO<sup>2</sup> reflect proportional changes in cardiac output* (e.g., a 30% decrease in end-tidal PCO<sup>2</sup> indicates a 30% decrease in the cardiac output). The baseline end-tidal PCO<sup>2</sup> is normally

equivalent to the arterial PCO<sup>2</sup> (i.e., about 40 mm Hg), but it is lower than the arterial PCO<sup>2</sup> in pulmonary conditions associated with increased physiologic dead space (i.e., V/Q ratio >1), such as chronic obstructive lung disease.

## *Using the End-Tidal PCO<sup>2</sup>*

The ETCO<sup>2</sup> has been suggested for monitoring the quality of chest compressions; i.e., an increase in depth of compressions is accompanied by an increase in ETCO<sup>2</sup> (24). More importantly, serial measurements of ETCO<sup>2</sup> during CPR can be used to identify the likelihood of the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). This is demonstrated by the graph in [Figure](#page-8-0) 21.4, which show the serial changes in ETCO<sup>2</sup> during CPR in relation to ROSC (25). Patients who achieved ROSC showed a progressive increase in ETCO<sup>2</sup> during the 20-minute resuscitation period, whereas patients who did not achieve ROSC showed a progressive decline in ETCO<sup>2</sup> . The ETCO<sup>2</sup> that separated responders from nonresponders in this study was 15 mm Hg after 20 minutes. Other studies have shown a discriminant ETCO<sup>2</sup> of 10 mm Hg for separating responders from nonresponders (26,27).

<span id="page-8-0"></span>The sum of the evidence indicates that *a successful resuscitation is unlikely if the end tidal PCO<sup>2</sup> is not higher than 10–15 mm Hg after 20 minutes of CPR*. When the end-tidal PCO<sup>2</sup> remains above this level, continued resuscitation for as long as 1½ hours has been associated with a favorable outcome (28).

**FIGURE 21.4** Serial changes in end tidal PCO<sup>2</sup> during CPR in relation to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in 737 cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. N indicates the number of patients in each group, and data points represent mean values. From Reference 25.

#### **Ultrasound**

Point-of-care ultrasound is invaluable for the detection of potentially reversible causes of cardiac

arrest, such as tension pneumothorax or pericardial tamponade. Ultrasound has a high sensitivity (91%) and specificity (99%) for the detection of pneumothoraces in the supine position (29), and pericardial effusions are readily detected in the subcostal or parasternal long-axis views (see [Figure](#page-9-0) 21.5) (30). The traditional signs of pericardial tamponade (i.e., diastolic collapse of the right ventricle) are unreliable during a cardiac arrest (due to low intracardiac pressures), so the presence of any pericardial effusion should prompt immediate pericardiocentesis.

<span id="page-9-0"></span>Studies in trauma-associated cardiac arrest have shown that ultrasound evidence of cardiac standstill is 100% predictive of failure to survive (31). However, there is considerable disagreement in the recognition of cardiac standstill among physicians that perform point-of-care ultrasound (32); as a result, the clinical practice guidelines for cardiac arrest do not recommend the ultrasound detection of cardiac standstill as a reason to terminate CPR [\(4](#page-14-6)).

# **POST-RESUSCITATION PERIOD**

The immediate goal of CPR is a return of spontaneous circulation, but this does not ensure a satisfactory outcome. In fact, *about 70% of patients who survive the resuscitation do not survive the hospitalization* (33). This section describes the common problems encountered in the days following a successful resuscitation of cardiac arrest.

# **Post-Cardiac Arrest Syndrome**

The return of spontaneous circulation is often followed by dysfunction in one or more major organs that can be progressive and ultimately fatal. This *post-cardiac arrest syndrome* is attributed to a combination of ischemic injury inflicted during the arrest, and a *reperfusion injury* from toxic substances released from ischemic tissues when blood flow is re-established (33,34). The principal features of this syndrome are summarized below:

1. *Brain injury* is the most common manifestation of the post-cardiac arrest syndrome, and is *responsible for 23% to 68% of deaths following cardiac arrest* (33). Clinical manifestations

include failure to awaken, myoclonus, and generalized seizures. The high prevalence of brain injury after cardiac arrest is attributed to a limited tolerance to ischemia, and a predisposition to oxidative reperfusion injury from reactive oxygen species (34).

- 2. Post-arrest *cardiac dysfunction* is a combination of systolic and diastolic dysfunction that can progress to cardiogenic shock within hours after ROSC (33). The underlying problem is a type of reperfusion injury known as myocardial "stunning", which usually resolves within 72 hours (33).
- 3. A systemic inflammatory response (i.e., fever, leukocytosis, etc.) is almost universal after cardiac arrest, and can result in widespread inflammatory injury with multiorgan failure and circulatory shock. (See Chapter 17 for more on inflammatory shock.)

#### **Targeted Temperature Management**

Increased body temperature is well-known for its ability to aggravate ischemic brain injury (35), and control of body temperature has been a major focus of efforts to limit neurologic injury in patients who survive a cardiac arrest.

#### *A Brief History*

Induced hypothermia (originally called *human refrigeration*) was introduced for the management of post-cardiac arrest victims in the 1950s (36), but was abandoned because of the risks associated with hypothermia. About a half century later (in 2002), two studies were published showing that mild hypothermia (32–34° C) improved the chances of neurologic recovery in survivors of cardiac arrest who remained comatose (37,38). This led to the immediate adoption of induced hypothermia at 32–34° C for comatose survivors of cardiac arrest. About 10 years later, a large multicenter study showed that a target temperature of 36° C was equivalent to 33° C for influencing outcomes (39), and also reduced the risk of hemodynamic compromise (40). After another 10 years, the same group of investigators showed that a target temperature of 37.5° C (normothermia) was equivalent to 33° C for influencing outcomes (41). This brings us to the current state of affairs, where *the goal of targeted temperature management is to prevent fever in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest*.

†From the clinical practice guidelines in Reference 3.

#### *The Method*

The salient features of targeted temperature management (TTM) are outlined in [Table](#page-10-0) 21.3 ([3,](#page-14-3)41). Candidates for TTM include all patients who do not regain consciousness after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and the goal is to maintain a body temperature ≤37.5° C (99.5° F) for 72 hours after ROSC, or until the patient awakens. Continuous monitoring of core body temperature is required, and is easily accomplished with thermistor-equipped bladder catheters. A temperature-controlled cooling device is used only if the body temperature rises above 37.7° C (99.9° F), and if this occurs, surface cooling should be adequate, with the target temperature set at 37.5° C.

Despite the recommendation for normothermic TTM in the most recent clinical practice guidelines [\(3](#page-14-3)), there is a reluctance to abandon hypothermic TTM, and the option to use a target temperature of 33° C is left unresolved. However, the induction of hypothermia introduces a number of undesirable factors, such as the risk of hypotension (from cold-induced diuresis and cardiac depression), bradycardia (common during hypothermia), and shivering, which often requires heavy sedation (which can delay the assessment of mental status) and occasionally requires neuromuscular paralysis (which is never desirable).

## **Other Concerns**

In addition to preventing fever, there are other concerns for the management of patients in the early post-arrest period. These are summarized in [Table](#page-11-0) 21.4.

#### *Oxygen Inhalation*

Hyperoxia can aggravate the neurologic injury following cardiac arrest (42), and oxygen inhalation should be used only to correct hypoxemia (arterial O<sup>2</sup> saturation <90%) ([6\)](#page-14-14). Reactive oxygen species are implicated in the reperfusion injury that follows return of spontaneous circulation (34), which provides another reason to limit O<sup>2</sup> breathing in the post-arrest period.

#### *Managing Hypotension*

Ischemic brain injury is associated with dysfunctional autoregulation of cerebral blood flow; in

this situation, cerebral blood flow is dependent on the arterial blood pressure. As a result, hypotension (which is common after return of spontaneous circulation) can aggravate post-arrest brain injury, and should be treated aggressively. However, the optimal pressure in the post-arrest period is unclear. Although the standard recommendation for hypotension is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥65 mm Hg (see Chapter 14), observational studies show that patients with higher blood pressures in the early post-arrest period have better neurologic outcomes (43,44). Therefore, targeting an MAP that is higher than usual (e.g., ≥75 mm Hg is a reasonable consideration in the early hours following return of spontaneous circulation.

**VASOPRESSOR AGENT:** There is a tendency to continue using epinephrine as a vasopressor for the hypotension that follows return of spontaneous circulation, but there is evidence that norepinephrine is associated with fewer cardiovascular deaths and improved neurologic outcomes when compared to epinephrine (45).

## **Glycemic Control**

Hyperglycemia in the early post-arrest period is associated with a poor neurologic outcome (46), so attention to glycemic control is advised. However, strict glycemic control in critically ill patients is associated with frequent episodes of hypoglycemia (47), which also promotes neurologic injury, so a higher-than-normal *range of 145–180 mg/dL* for blood glucose is considered a reasonable target of glycemic control following cardiac arrest (48). As an adjunct to this practice, it seems wise to *avoid dextrose-containing intravenous solutions* whenever possible.

### **Predicting Neurologic Recovery**

In patients who do not regain consciousness after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or targeted temperature management, the single most important determination is the likelihood of neurologic recovery. The following is a description of what is involved in this determination. The predictors of a poor outcome with a high degree of certainty (i.e., few or no false positive results) are shown in [Table](#page-12-0) 21.5. (A poor outcome is defined as death, persistent coma or vegetative state, or severe disability.)

#### <span id="page-12-0"></span>**TABLE 21.5 Predictors of a Poor Neurologic Outcome with a High Degree of Certainty**

- 1. Absence of pupillary light reflexes bilaterally on day 4 after ROSC.
- 2. Absence of corneal reflexes bilaterally on day 4 after ROSC.
- 3. Absence of oculocephalic or gag reflexes on day 2 after ROSC.
- 4. Myoclonic status at any time after ROSC.
- 5. Bilateral absence of the N20 peak on somatosensory evoked potentials.
- 6. An EEG that shows nonconvulsive status epilepticus or background suppression with periodic discharges.

From Reference 51.

#### *Time to Awaken*

Most (80–95%) patients who regain consciousness after ROSC are awake after 72 hours (49), but it can take 5 days or even longer for all patients to awaken, especially patients subjected to induced hypothermia (i.e., target temps of 32–34° C) (50). In general, the time to awaken can be a poor predictor of neurologic outcome in the first week following CPR, especially in patients who are heavily sedated in the early period following ROSC.

#### *Clinical Examination*

The only findings on clinical examination that are highly predictive of a poor outcome are the absence of brainstem reflexes. The ones that predict a poor outcome with a high degree of certainty include the absence of pupillary light reflexes bilaterally or corneal reflexes bilaterally on day 4 after ROSC, and the absence of gag or oculocephalic reflexes on day 2 after ROSC (51). Contrary to popular perception, an abnormal extensor response to pain (i.e., decerebrate posturing) is not highly predictive of a poor neurological recovery (51).

#### *Myoclonus*

The appearance of myoclonus (sudden, brief, involuntary jerks) early after ROSC is an unfavorable sign, but it does not eliminate the possibility of a neurologic recovery. However, the appearance of myoclonic status epilepticus at any time after ROSC predicts a poor outcome with almost 100% certainty (51).

#### *Evoked Potentials*

Somatosensory evoked potentials are averaged responses in the central nervous system to peripheral nerve stimulation, and are measured at the skin surface (like an EEG). Bilateral absence of the N20 peak (from the somatosensory cortex) with median nerve stimulation is highly predictive of a poor outcome (51).

#### *Electroencephalography*

The following findings on an electroencephalogram (EEG) are highly predictive of a poor neurologic outcome: 1) an isoelectric EEG (i.e., all activity <2 μV); 2) the presence of nonconvulsive status epilepticus, and 3) background suppression with superimposed periodic discharges (51).

#### *Imaging*

Computed tomography of the brain can reveal a massive stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage with herniation, both indicating very poor prognosis. CT evidence of diffuse cerebral edema is also highly predictive of a poor outcome, especially if present on day 2 or later after the cardiac arrest (51).

# **A FINAL WORD**

#### **Perception vs. Reality**

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation has always enjoyed a popularity far greater than deserved. This is evident in surveys of the general public, where 95% of respondents have unrealistic expectations about CPR (52), including the belief that more than half of cardiac arrest victims survive and return to daily life with no residual effects (53). Television shows fuel this perception, where CPR is portrayed as a success in up to 75% of cases (54).

The reality of CPR is far removed from the public perception, as shown in [Table](#page-0-0) 21.1, which indicates that CPR has a successful outcome in only 1–7% of cases.

Why is this so important? Because patients decide whether CPR is performed, so faulty perception, not reality, is dictating the delivery of CPR.
