# **Platelets and Plasma**

*Hemorrhage upon a strong pulsation in wounds is bad.*

Hippocrates *Aphorisms,* 400 B.C.

The ability to form blood clots is important for limiting blood loss from disrupted blood vessels, which is all the more important if you consider that the human body has a relatively small blood volume (which accounts for only 11–12% of the total body fluids), and loss of as little as 35% of this volume can be fatal (see Chapter 15). Two of the vital components in the complex pathway to clot formation are the circulating platelets and the procoagulant proteins in plasma. This chapter will focus on the dysfunction of these components in critically ill patients, including the causes, consequences, and corrective actions.

## **OVERVIEW OF HEMOSTASIS**

The vascular endothelium is a thromboresistant surface that is covered with a protective meshwork of mucopolysaccharides called the *glycocalyx* that has two principal functions [\(1](#page-16-0)[,2](#page-16-1)). First, it limits the passage of large protein molecules from the plasma, thereby maintaining the colloid osmotic pressure of plasma. Second, it maintains the "fluidity" of blood by preventing leukocytes and platelets from adhering to the endothelial surface, and by acting as a mechanoreceptor for sheer stress that signals endothelial cells to secrete nitric oxide, which promotes vasodilation.

## **Response to Injury**

When the endothelium and its protective glycocalyx is disrupted, platelets adhere to exposed collagen in the subendothelium and begin to form a *platelet plug*, which is the primary stage of hemostasis [\(3](#page-16-2)). The platelets release calcium, which activates the glycoprotein receptor IIb/IIIa complex on the platelet surface. This receptor complex binds irreversibly to von Willebrand factor on the surrounding endothelial cells, which helps to anchor the platelet plug to the vessel wall. The IIb/IIIa receptor complex also binds fibrinogen, and the subsequent formation of fibrin bridges between adjacent platelets stabilizes the platelet plug, and eventually leads to its contraction, which promotes the resurgence of blood flow.

Fibrin is essential for the stability of a developing thrombus, and there are two pathways to fibrin formation ([4\)](#page-16-3). The major pathway is called the *Tissue Factor Pathway* (formerly called the Extrinsic Pathway), and is activated by the release of thromboplastin from the subendothelium. The second pathway is the *Contact Activation Pathway* (formerly called the Intrinsic Pathway), and is activated by endogenous peptides known as kininogens, which are precursors of bradykinin. Both pathways involve the activation of specific procoagulant proteins known as *clotting factors*, and they both lead to the activation of prothrombin (factor II) and the subsequent conversion of fibrinogen (factor I) to fibrin monomers. This is the secondary stage of hemostasis.

The end-product of the response to injury is the *thrombus*, which is essentially a clump of platelets embedded in a meshwork of fibrin strands and anchored to the vessel wall in the area of injury.

## **THROMBOCYTOPENIA**

Thrombocytopenia is the most common hemostatic disorder in critically ill patients, with a reported incidence as high as 60% [\(5](#page-16-4)[,6](#page-16-5)). The traditional definition of thrombocytopenia is a platelet count below 150,000/μL, but the ability to form a hemostatic plug is retained until the platelet count falls below 100,000/μL ([6\)](#page-16-5), so a platelet count <100,000/μL is more appropriate for identifying clinically significant thrombocytopenia. However, *the risk of major bleeding is not determined by the platelet count alone*, but also requires a structural lesion that is prone to bleeding. In the absence of such a lesion, platelet counts as low as 5,000/µL can be tolerated without evidence of major hemorrhage ([7\)](#page-16-6). The major risk with platelet counts <10,000/μL is spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage, which is uncommon [\(6](#page-16-5)).

## **Pseudothrombocytopenia**

Pseudothrombocytopenia is a condition where antibodies to EDTA (the anticoagulant in blood collection tubes) produce clumping of platelets in vitro. The clumped platelets are misread as leukocytes by automated machines that perform cell counts, and this results in a spuriously low platelet count. This phenomenon has been reported in 2% of platelet counts performed in hospitalized patients [\(8](#page-16-7)).

Suspicion of pseudothrombocytopenia is usually prompted by a platelet count that is lower than expected, or by the presence of clumped platelets on the peripheral blood smear. If suspected, blood collection tubes that use citrate or heparin as an anticoagulant should be used for subsequent platelet counts.

## **Critically Ill Patients**

The most likely causes of thrombocytopenia in the ICU setting are listed in [Table](#page-2-0) 13.1. The sepsis syndrome is the most common cause of thrombocytopenia in ICU patients, which is the result of increased platelet destruction by macrophages ([9\)](#page-16-8). Other less common but more lifethreatening causes of thrombocytopenia include heparin and the thrombotic microangiopathies; i.e., disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura (TTP), and the hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS).

Drugs like antineoplastic agents can produce thrombocytopenia by suppressing platelet

production, but the most common mechanism for drug-induced thrombocytopenia is the production of antibodies that cross-react with platelets [\(10](#page-16-9)). This immune-mediated thrombocytopenia is most frequently observed with heparin, and less frequently with platelet glycoprotein receptor (IIb/IIIa) antagonists, and selected antibiotics (particularly linezolid, βlactams, and vancomycin).

## **HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA**

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an immune-mediated condition that is associated with life-threatening thrombosis (arterial or venous) in 25% to 70% of cases [\(11](#page-16-10)), and has a mortality rate as high as 30% if left unnoticed ([12\)](#page-16-11). The incidence of HIT varies from <1% to 5% ([11\)](#page-16-10), and is determined by the type of heparin used and the patient population (see later).

## **Pathogenesis**

Heparin is not immunogenic itself, but it binds to a protein (platelet factor 4) on platelets to form an antigenic complex that can trigger the formation of IgG antibodies. These antibodies bind to platelets and induce a strong platelet activation response that promotes thrombosis. The reticuloendothelial system can clear antibody-coated platelets, which helps to limit the incidence of thrombosis. Heparin-associated antibodies usually disappear within 3 months after discontinuing heparin [\(12](#page-16-11)).

#### *Risk Factors*

The immune response that triggers HIT *is not a dose-dependent reaction*, and can occur with relatively minor heparin exposures from heparin-based catheter flushes or even heparin-coated catheters ([11,](#page-16-10)[13\)](#page-16-12). The risk factors associated with HIT include orthopedic or cardiac surgery, obesity, and exposure to unfractionated heparin; i.e., the risk of HIT with unfractionated heparin (UFH) is 2–10 times greater than the risk with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) [\(11](#page-16-10)).

HIT is not common in the general ICU population: i.e., the reported incidence of HIT is <1% in critically ill patients, regardless of the type of heparin used (for DVT prophylaxis) ([14\)](#page-16-13). In contrast, HIT has been reported in 1–3% of patients in a cardiothoracic ICU when UFH is used ([11\)](#page-16-10).

### **Clinical Features**

HIT typically appears 5 to 10 days after the first exposure to heparin, but it can appear within 24 hours in patients who have had a prior exposure to heparin within the past 3 months ([11\)](#page-16-10). Although uncommon, a delayed-onset HIT has been reported that becomes evident up to 3 weeks after exposure to heparin [\(11](#page-16-10)). Platelet counts in HIT can fall by 50%, but they rarely fall below 20,000/μL.

The feared consequence in HIT is thrombosis, not bleeding. Reports indicate that 17% to 55% of patients with untreated HIT develop venous thromboembolism, and 1% to 3% of patients develop arterial thromboses, which can result in ischemic stroke or acute myocardial infarction ([15\)](#page-16-14). *In up to 25% of cases, the thrombosis precedes the thrombocytopenia* [\(15](#page-16-14)).

## **Diagnostic Testing**

There are two assays used for the diagnosis of HIT. The first is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for antibodies to the platelet factor 4-heparin complex. This assay has a high sensitivity but a limited specificity, so a negative assay can be used to exclude the diagnosis of HIT, but a positive assay does not confirm the diagnosis [\(11](#page-16-10)). The false positive ELISA assays are caused by antibodies to the platelet factor-4 heparin complex that do not activate platelets to produce thrombocytopenia or thrombosis.

The most reliable assay for the diagnosis of HIT is the platelet serotonin-release assay (SRA), which measures the ability of the patient's plasma to activate platelets (which results in enhanced serotonin release by the platelets) [\(16](#page-16-15)). This is considered the "gold standard" test for the diagnosis of HIT, and is recommended to confirm the diagnosis of HIT when the ELISA test is positive [\(16](#page-16-15)). However, the SRA is not routinely available in many hospitals. As a result, the diagnosis of HIT is usually based on a positive HIT antibody (ELISA) assay.

#### **Risk Assessment**

The diagnostic approach to HIT begins by assessing the probability of HIT being present, and a popular risk assessment tool is the 4Ts scoring system shown in [Table](#page-4-0) 13.2 ([17\)](#page-16-16). The 4Ts score should be used as follows (18).

- 1. If the probability of HIT is low on the 4Ts score, then nothing further is needed, including laboratory testing for HIT or discontinuing heparin.
- 2. If there is an intermediate-risk on the 4Ts score, then heparin should be discontinued and a non-heparin anticoagulant should be initiated. The ELISA immunoassay for HIT antibodies

should be ordered; if the test is negative, the non-heparin anticoagulant can be discontinued, and heparin can be restarted.

- 3. If there is a high-risk of HIT, then heparin should be discontinued and a non-heparin anticoagulant should be started at full therapeutic doses. This can be discontinued if the ELISA test is negative.
- 4. Patients with a positive ELISA test for HIT antibodies who have no clinical evidence of thrombosis should have an ultrasound evaluation for deep vein thrombosis in the legs. If a central venous catheter is in place, an ultrasound evaluation for thrombosis in the upper extremities is recommended.
- 5. All patients with HIT should receive a non-heparin anticoagulant at full therapeutic doses, even if there is no evidence of associated thrombosis. This recommendation is based on studies showing a 10-fold higher incidence of thrombosis following the appearance of HIT when anticoagulation is delayed ([13\)](#page-16-12).

## **Alternative Anticoagulants**

*Note:* Warfarin is absolutely contraindicated in patients with acute HIT because it has a prothrombotic effect that can lead to limb gangrene and necrotic skin lesions ([11\)](#page-16-10). Vitamin K reversal is indicated for any patient with HIT who has received warfarin within a few days of the diagnosis.

The alternative anticoagulants for patients with HIT include argatroban, bivalrudin, fondaparinux, and the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Argatroban is currently the only drug approved for use in HIT in the United States, but the ASH guidelines for HIT (18) recommends bivalrudin for percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with HIT. These guidelines also state that fondaparinux and the DOACs (primarily rivaroxaban) are reasonable options in patients who are clinically stable.

#### *Argatroban*

Argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor that is given by continuous infusion. The recommended dosing regimen is as follows (20):

- 1. Start the infusion at 1–2 μg/kg/min, and titrate dose to achieve an activated PTT of 1.5 to 3 times normal.
- 2. For hepatic insufficiency, start at 0.5 μg/kg/min.
- 3. No dose adjustment is needed for renal dysfunction.
- 4. Full anticoagulation with argatroban should continue until the platelet count rises above 150,000/μL (18).

#### *Long-Term Management*

A DOAC can be used for continued anticoagulation after argatroban treatment is completed. Most of the clinical experience with DOACs in HIT have involved rivaroxaban, which has been successful in preventing thrombosis or the extension of thrombosis (18). The duration of treatment is usually 1–3 months. Following an episode of HIT, patients should be advised to wear an emergency identifier for 3 months, and to avoid heparin for life (18).

## **THROMBOTIC MICROANGIOPATHIES**

The thrombotic microangiopathies are life-threatening clinical disorders that share the following features:

- 1. A consumptive thrombocytopenia.
- 2. Microvascular thrombosis with dysfunction of one or more major organs.
- 3. A *microangiopathic hemolytic anemia* that is not immunogenic in origin, but is the result of erythrocyte disruption in the clot-filled microvasculature. The hallmark of this type of hemolytic anemia is the presence of fragmented red blood cells called *schistocytes* on the peripheral blood smear (see [Figure](#page-6-0) 13.1).

<span id="page-6-0"></span>![](_page_6_Figure_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 13.1** Peripheral blood smear from a patient with DIC. The arrows are pointing to schistocytes (fragmented erythrocytes) whose presence is pathognomonic of a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.

There are 3 pathological entities that share these features: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura (TTP), and the hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). The following is a brief summary of these conditions.

From Reference 4. DIC = disseminated intravascular coagulation, TTP = thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura, HUS = hemolytic uremic syndrome.

## **Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation**

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a secondary disorder that is triggered by conditions that produce widespread endothelial and tissue injury such as multisystem trauma, septic shock, and obstetric emergencies (amniotic fluid embolism, abruptio placentae, eclampsia, and retained fetus syndrome). The inciting event is release of *tissue factor*, which activates a series of clotting factors in the bloodstream that culminates in the formation of fibrin. This leads

to widespread microvascular thrombosis and secondary depletion of platelets and clotting factors, resulting in a *consumptive coagulopathy* (21).

#### *Clinical Features*

The microvascular thrombosis in DIC can lead to multiorgan dysfunction, most often involving the lungs, kidneys, and central nervous system, while depletion of platelets and coagulation factors can promote bleeding. Thrombosis is most prominent when sepsis is the underlying cause, while bleeding is prominent in the obstetric conditions. A severe form of DIC known as *purpura fulminans* is characterized by necrosis and gangrene of the limbs, and is seen with overwhelming infections, most notably with meningococcemia (22).

**HEMATOLOGIC ABNORMALITIES:** The hematologic features of DIC are summarized in [Table](#page-6-1) 13.3. The hemolytic anemia is suspected by an elevated LDH and reduced haptoglobin level, and is confirmed by the presence of schistocytes, like the ones in [Figure](#page-6-0) 13.1. What distinguishes DIC from the other thrombotic microangiopathies is the depletion of clotting factors, which prolongs the INR and the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Fibrinolysis is also enhanced, which elevates the fibrin degradation products in plasma (i.e., plasma D-dimers).

#### *Management*

There is no effective treatment for DIC, and management involves supportive care and treatment of the underlying cause. Life-threatening hemorrhage prompts replacement therapy with blood products, but this usually does not stop the bleeding, and the addition of platelets and coagulation factors can "add fuel" to the microvascular thrombosis. When DIC is accompanied by multiorgan failure, the mortality rate is ≥80% (21).

## **Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia Purpura**

Thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura (TTP) is a potentially devastating condition that is treatable, but can be fatal in 24–48 hours if left untreated.

## *Pathogenesis*

One of the components of the hemostatic process is the von Willebrand factor (VWF), a large protein from endothelial cells that promotes platelet adhesion. The activity of VWF is normally controlled by a protease enzyme with the name of ADAMTS-13 that cleaves VWF and reduces its prothrombotic activity. The principal problem in TTP is the appearance of antibodies that inactivate the ADAMTS-13 protease (22), resulting in uncontrolled platelet adhesion and widespread microvascular thrombosis. The trigger for these antibodies is not known.

#### *Clinical Features*

TTP usually appears in middle age, and is three times more frequent in women. The classic presentation of TTP is a *pentad of manifestations* that include fever, altered mentation, renal insufficiency, thrombocytopenia, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. All 5 of these may not be present at the outset; i.e., fever may be absent, and neurologic symptoms may be mild (e.g., headache) or absent. However, this condition can progress rapidly to multiorgan failure and a fatal outcome.

#### *Diagnosis*

Prompt diagnosis of TTP is important because delays in treatment can diminish the chances of survival. A marked decrease in ADAMTS-13 activity in plasma is patho-gnomonic of TTP (22), but this test is not readily available in most hospitals. The presence of thrombocytopenia and schistocytes will signal the presence of a thrombotic microangiopathy. TTP can then be distinguished from DIC because *the INR, aPTT, and fibrinogen levels are normal in TTP* (see [Table](#page-6-1) 13.3), and it can be distinguished from the hemolytic uremic syndrome because the renal insufficiency in TTP is often mild (i.e., the creatinine is usually <2 mg/dL) (22).

#### *Treatment*

*The treatment of choice for TTP is plasma exchange* (23), where blood from the patient is diverted to a device that separates and discards the patient's plasma and reinfuses the patient's erythrocytes with plasma from a healthy donor. About 1.5 times the normal plasma volume is exchanged with each treatment, and this is continued daily until the platelet count returns to normal for 2 consecutive days. Acute fulminant TTP is almost always fatal if untreated, but if plasma exchange is started early (within 48 hours of symptom onset), as many as 90% of patients can survive the illness (23,24).

### **Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome**

As the name indicates, the hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is characterized by the combination of a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and acute renal failure, in addition to a consumptive thrombocytopenia. HUS can be the consequence of a variety of disorders, but infection is probably the most common predisposing condition, especially infections caused by *Escherichia coli* strains that produce the Shiga toxin, and by *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and the influenza virus (25). Other predisposing conditions include pregnancy, autoimmune disorders (e.g., lupus), the antiphospholipid syndrome, malignancy, and drugs (e.g., quinine, cyclosporin, tacrolimus). There is also an inherited condition known as *atypical HUS* that is characterized by unregulated complement activation (26).

#### *Clinical Features*

HUS presents with the triad of thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury and a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Extrarenal manifestations are reported in about 20% of cases of atypical HUS (26), and most frequently are neurologic, ranging from agitation to coma.

The diagnosis of HUS requires evidence of a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (first suspected by elevated LDH and reduced haptoglobin levels, and then confirmed by the presence of schistocytes). HUS differs from DIC in that there is no consumption of clotting factors in HUS, so the INR and aPTT are normal in HUS. Fibrinolysis is also not enhanced, so the products of fibrinolysis (i.e., D-dimer levels) are not increased (see [Table](#page-6-1) 13.3). HUS can be differentiated from TTP by the severity of the renal insufficiency, which is usually greater in HUS (22).

#### *Management*

The management of infection-related HUS involves supportive care and treatment of the underlying infection. In cases of atypical HUS due to unregulated complement activation (see earlier), a monoclonal IgG antibody named eculizumab (which binds to the C5 complement

protein and blocks the prothrombotic effects of complement activation) has had success in reversing the condition (27). If this drug is not available, then plasma exchange is the treatment of choice.

Management of the renal failure in HUS involves the usual measures, including renal replacement therapy if needed. Renal transplantation has been used in atypical HUS.

## **PLATELET TRANSFUSIONS**

### **Indications**

*Note:* The following recommendations for platelet transfusions do not apply to cases of consumptive thrombocytopenia in the thrombotic microangiopathies (where platelet transfusions can aggravate the microvascular thrombosis).

#### *Active Bleeding*

In the presence of active bleeding, platelet transfusions are recommended to keep the platelet count above 50,000/μL (28). For intracranial hemorrhage, the platelet count should be kept above 100,000/µL (28).

### *Prophylactic Transfusions*

The most recent guidelines from the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) includes the following recommendations for prophylactic platelet transfusions (29):

- 1. In the absence of bleeding, platelet transfusions are recommended when the platelet count is ≤10,000/μL.
- 2. For procedures, the following platelet counts are recommended as thresholds for prophylactic platelet transfusions: 1) <50,000/μL for elective non-neuraxial surgery, 2) <50,000/μL for lumbar punctures, and 3) <20,000/μL for insertion of central venous catheters.

One aspect of these recommendations that deserves mention is that none of them have been validated (e.g., platelet counts as low as 5,000/μL do not provoke spontaneous bleeding, as mentioned earlier). Overall, it is reasonable to state that, *in the absence of active bleeding, the major problem with thrombocytopenia is not the platelet count, but the underlying cause of the thrombocytopenia*.

## **Platelet Preparations**

Platelets are provided either as pooled platelets extracted from multiple units of donated whole blood, or by extracting platelets from a single donor using apheresis techniques. Platelets are stored at room temperature, which limits their shelf life to about 5 days.

#### *Pooled Platelet Concentrates*

Platelets are separated from fresh whole blood by differential centrifugation, and the resulting platelet concentrates from multiple [\(4](#page-16-3)[–6](#page-16-5)) donors are pooled together prior to storage. The pooled platelet concentrate contains about 38 × 1010 platelets in 260 mL plasma, which is equivalent to a

platelet count of about 130 × 109/µL. This is six orders of magnitude higher than the normal platelet count in blood (150–400 × 103/µL).

#### *Apheresis Platelets*

Apheresis platelets are collected from a single donor, and have a platelet count equivalent to the pooled platelet concentrates. The presumed benefit of single-donor platelet transfusions is a lower risk of transmitted infections and a lower incidence of platelet *alloimmunization* (i.e., developing antibodies to donor platelets, which reduces the effect of platelet transfusions). However, neither of these proposed benefits has been validated (30,31) and in a recent national survey that included over 2 million platelet transfusions (31), adverse reactions were much more common with single-donor (apheresed) platelets compared to multiple-donor preparations (see [Table](#page-12-0) 13.4). In addition, there is no difference in the risk of platelet alloimmunization with single-donor and multiple-donor transfusions when the platelet preparations are "leuko-reduced" (32).

#### *Leukoreduction*

Leukocytes in donor blood have been implicated in several adverse reactions to transfusion, and leukocyte removal using specialized filters is now a routine practice for erythrocyte transfusions (see last chapter). Platelet concentrates are not free of leukocytes, and leukocyte reduction in platelet preparations reduces the incidence of febrile reactions, as well as cytomegalovirus transmission (which is transmitted in leukocytes) and platelet alloimmunization (28,32). Because of these advantages, leukocyte reduction is becoming a routine practice for platelet transfusions.

## **Response to Transfused Platelets**

In an average-sized adult with no ongoing blood loss, *the infusion of one unit of platelets (either multiple-donor or apheresed platelets) should raise the circulating platelet count by 35,000 to 50,000/μL at one hour post-transfusion* (26). The increment is about 40% lower after 24 hours, as shown in [Figure](#page-11-0) 13.2 (33).

The increment in platelet count declines with multiple transfusions. This is also shown in [Figure](#page-11-0) 13.2, where the platelet increment is about 25% lower after 5 platelet transfusions (33). This phenomenon of "platelet refractoriness" is the result of antiplatelet antibodies in the recipient directed at ABO antigens on donor platelets. This effect is mitigated by transfusing ABO-matched platelets.

**FIGURE 13.2** Post-transfusion increment in platelet counts in relation to the time elapsed after the transfusion (one hour versus 24 hours) and the number of transfusions given. Data from Reference 33.

## **Adverse Effects**

The rate of adverse reactions to platelet transfusions is shown in [Table](#page-12-0) 13.4. The data in this table is from a survey of more than 2 million platelet transfusions, and compares the reaction rates with single-donor and multiple-donor preparations (31). Note the low overall reaction rate, and the higher rate with single-donor preparations. The following are some relevant points about these reactions.

#### *Nonhemolytic Fever*

Transfusion-associated fever can be the result of antileukocyte antibodies in recipient blood that react with antigens on leukocytes in donor blood. This triggers the release of endogenous pyrogens from phagocytes, which is the source of the fever. The routine use of leukocyte reduction in platelet preparations has significantly reduced (but not eliminated) this reaction.

### *Allergic Reactions*

Allergic reactions (urticaria, anaphylaxis) are the result of sensitization to plasma proteins in donor blood. Single-donor platelets have a higher plasma volume than multiple-donor preparations, which would explain the higher rate of allergic reactions with single-donor platelets in [Table](#page-12-0) 13.4.

## *Acute Lung Injury*

Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is described in Chapter 12. This condition is the result of antileukocyte antibodies in donor plasma that bind to antigens on circulating neutrophils in the recipient. The result is a diffuse, inflammatory lung injury that is similar to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This reaction is most often associated with erythrocyte

transfusions, but also occurs with platelet transfusions.

#### *Transmission of Infections*

The adoption of nucleic acid testing has virtually eliminated the risk of transmission of HIV and the hepatitis viruses in both erythrocyte and platelet transfusions. The risk of bacterial transmission is higher with platelet than erythrocyte transfusions because platelets are stored at room temperature, which is more likely to promote bacterial proliferation. However, the rate of bacterial transmission with platelet transfusions is quite low, as shown in [Table](#page-12-0) 13.4.

## **PLASMA PRODUCTS**

Plasma products are used as a source of procoagulant plasma proteins, and the two plasma products used most often for this purpose are fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate.

### **Fresh Frozen Plasma**

Plasma is separated from donor blood and frozen at –18° C within 8 hours of blood collection. This *fresh frozen plasma* (FFP) has a volume of about 230 mL, and can be stored for one year. Once thawed, FFP can be stored at 1–6° C (34**–**43° F) for up to 5 days. The principal uses of FFP include the resuscitation of massive blood loss, and the reversal of anticoagulation with warfarin.

#### *Massive Blood Loss*

The current practice for the resuscitation of massive blood loss (i.e., loss equivalent to the blood volume within 24 hours) is to transfuse one unit of FFP for every 1–2 units of packed red blood cells (34). There are two drawbacks with FFP: i.e., the time to thaw FFP is a drawback when immediate availability is needed for the resuscitation effort, and the limited shelf-life after thawing can lead to wasting the product. These limitations have led to the introduction of "liquid

plasma" preparations that are never frozen, and can be stored 1–6° C (34**–**43° F) for up to 26 days. Early studies of liquid plasma have shown equivalent efficacy with FFP, while also reducing the waste associated with FFP (35).

#### *Prophylactic FFP*

A majority of FFP infusions in ICU patients are used to reduce an elevated INR in coagulopathic, nonbleeding patients who are considered at risk for bleeding (e.g., cirrhotic patients with a prior history of variceal bleeding) (36). However, *there is no evidence that prophylactic FFP reduces bleeding* in these patients, or that it provides any type of clinical benefit (37,38).

#### *Reversing Warfarin Anticoagulation*

One of the traditional uses of FFP is to replenish clotting factors in cases of troublesome bleeding related to anticoagulation therapy with warfarin. Vitamin K is given first to block ongoing anticoagulant activity, and the FFP is then given (usually in a volume of 10−15 mL/kg) to return the INR to normal (39). This approach has two shortcomings: i.e., the time needed to thaw the FFP leads to treatment delays (which can prolong the bleeding), and the volume of FFP that is required can aggravate the bleeding. These problems have been eliminated by the introduction of *4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate*, a lyophilized powder that contains the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (factors II, VII, IX, and X) and, with a reconstituted volume of 100 mL, is capable of reversing warfarin effects in less than 30 minutes (40). (See Chapter 47 for more on warfarin reversal.)

#### *FFP and the INR*

There is a fundamental problem with the use of the INR to guide FFP infusions. (*Note:* INR is the abbreviation for "international normalized ratio", which is the ratio of the patient's prothrombin time divided by a standardized normal prothrombin time.) This test was introduced to monitor anticoagulation with coumadin, and it is heavily influenced by the activity of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (Factors II, VII, IX, and X). However, the INR does not monitor other components of hemostasis, such as the activity of endogenous "anticoagulant" proteins (i.e., antithrombin, protein C, and protein S), which must be considered to determine the overall state of hemostasis.

The graphs in [Figure](#page-14-0) 13.3 show how the INR can be misleading as a guide for FFP infusions (38). The data in these graphs is from a study of prophylactic FFP infusions (12 mL/kg) for an elevated INR in nonbleeding ICU patients who were scheduled for a procedure. Note that the FFP infusions significantly reduced the INR (graph on the left), but they also significantly increased the activity of antithrombin (graph on the right), an anticoagulant protein. (Although not shown, the activity of the other anticoagulant proteins was increased after the FFP infusion.) Thus, despite the favorable effect on the INR, there may be little or no improvement in overall coagulation status because of the opposing effect on endogenous anticoagulant activity.

#### **Adverse Reactions**

The adverse reactions to plasma transfusion are similar (in type, not frequency) to the reactions that complicate erythrocyte and platelet transfusions.

#### *Acute Hemolytic Reactions*

Acute hemolytic reactions are caused by anti-A and anti-B antibodies in donor plasma that react with A and B antigens on recipient RBCs. Cross-matching of plasma transfusions for ABO compatibility has become a standard practice, which eliminates the risk of acute hemolytic transfusion reactions.

#### *Nonhemolytic Fever*

Fever that is unrelated to acute hemolysis is caused by leukocytes in donor blood, which theoretically should not be a risk with plasma transfusions. However, FFP is not free of leukocytes, and this creates a minimal risk of nonhemolytic fever; i.e., in one report, the risk was <1 per 100,000 transfusions (41).

Height of the bars indicate median values. Despite the favorable decrease in INR, the opposing effect on antithrombin could result in little or no change in coagulation status. Data from Reference 38.

## *Hypersensitivity Reactions*

Hypersensitivity reactions (urticaria, anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock), which are caused by sensitization to proteins in donor plasma, are more common with plasma transfusions than with erythrocyte or platelet transfusions. The reported incidence of allergic reactions to FFP ranges from 1:600 to 1:2,000 transfusions (41).

### *Acute Lung Injury*

Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is attributed to antileukocyte antibodies in donor blood, and is a complication of erythrocyte, platelet, and plasma transfusions. The reported incidence of TRALI with plasma transfusions is about 1:250,000 units transfused (41). The clinical features of TRALI are described in Chapter 12.

#### *Hydrostatic Pulmonary Edema*

Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) is considered a risk if the infusion rate of FFP exceeds 1 mL/kg per hour in patients who are predisposed to circulatory overload (e.g., those with heart failure or pre-existing fluid overload). The reported risk of TACO ranges from 1:70 to 1:1500 units transfused (42).

#### *Transmitted Infections*

Plasma transfusions carry a minimal risk of transmitting infections. The risk of hepatitis B transmission is 1:280,000 transfusions, the risk of hepatitis C transmission is 1:1.2 million transfusions, and the risk of HIV transmission is 1:1.6 million transfusions (41). The risk of bacterial transmission is reported as "rare" and CMV transmission, which occurs in transfused leukocytes, has not been reported with plasma transfusions (41).

## **Cryoprecipitate**

When FFP is allowed to thaw at 4° C, a milky precipitate forms that is rich in cold-insoluble proteins (cryoglobulins) like fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and factor VIII. This *cryoprecipitate* can be separated from plasma and stored at –18° C for up to one year. It has a fibrinogen concentration of 10–20 g/L, and a storage volume of 10–15 mL. Once thawed, cryoprecipitate must be used within 4 hours (43).

#### *Using Cryoprecipitate*

Cryoprecipitate can be used as a source of fibrinogen in massive blood loss from trauma or postpartum hemorrhage. Fibrinogen depletion is always a consideration in the setting of significant blood loss because it is the earliest clotting factor to become depleted, and is also susceptible to the dilutional effects of fluid resuscitation. For major blood loss in trauma, cryoprecipitate is recommended when the fibrinogen level falls to 150–200 mg/dL (44). One unit of cryoprecipitate per 10 kg body weight will increase the plasma fibrinogen level by about 50 mg/dL (43), but this is in the absence of bleeding, so expect a greater cryoprecipitate requirement during active hemorrhage. Alternately, cryoprecipitate administration can be guided by viscoelastic assays, such as thromboelastography (which is described in Chapter 15).

Cryoprecipitate has some drawbacks, including a variable fibrinogen concentration, the time needed for thawing (which can delay infusion and prolong bleeding), and an increased risk of transmitted infections (because it is not subjected to pathogen-reduction measures) (45). These limitations are not shared by *fibrinogen concentrates*, which have a consistent fibrinogen content of 20 g/L, and do not require thawing; as a result, fibrinogen concentrates are gaining popularity as a superior alternative to cryoprecipitate (45).

## **A FINAL WORD**

## **Changing Perceptions**

There are two general messages in this chapter that might change your perception of thrombocytopenia in critically ill patients:

- 1. In the absence of active bleeding, the problem with thrombocytopenia is not the platelet count, but the underlying illness. As a result, prophylactic platelet transfusions are rarely necessary in critically ill patients.
- 2. The most life-threatening consequence of thrombocytopenia is not bleeding, but thrombosis (as is evident in HIT, DIC, TTP and HUS).

And there is one general message that might change your perception of the INR as a measure of coagulation status:

1. The INR is sensitive to the activity of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors, but it does not monitor other components of the hemostatic process, such as the activity of endogenous anticoagulant proteins (i.e., antithrombin, Protein C and Protein S). This limitation affects the reliability of the INR as a gauge for FFP infusions; i.e., a decrease in the INR in response to FFP is considered evidence of an improvement in the ability to form a clot, but FFP also increases the activity of endogenous anticoagulant proteins, and the net result may be little or no change in clot-forming ability. Therefore, the INR provides misleading information for FFP infusions.
