# The Indwelling Vascular Catheter

See, and then reason and compare and control. But see first.

Sir William Osler (a)

The ubiquitous presence of indwelling vascular catheters requires attention to their maintenance and vigilance for their troublesome complications. This chapter begins by describing the routine care and maintenance of indwelling catheters, including how to restore patency in an occluded catheter, and then focuses on the major complications of indwelling catheters: i.e., thrombosis, vascular perforation, and catheter-related infections.

# **ROUTINE CATHETER CARE**

The considerations involved in routine catheter care are summarized in Table 3.1.

# **Protective Dressings**

Catheter insertion sites should be covered with a sterile dressing for the life of the catheter. There are three types of dressings (1–3):

- . Sterile gauze pads, which are secured to the skin with hypo-allergenic tape.
- . Transparent polyurethane dressings, which are permeable to  $O_2$ ,  $CO_2$ , and water vapor, but trap moisture that collects on the underlying skin. These dressings have a skin adhesive that produces a seal around the catheter insertion site, and they are commonly known as "occlusive" dressings.
- . Chlorhexidine gluconate-impregnated sponge dressings, which can be placed over the catheter insertion site, and then covered with the transparent dressing.

The transparent occlusive dressings are favored because they allow routine inspection of the catheter insertion site, and also provide a seal that isolates the insertion site. However, the skin adhesive on these dressings does not work well when the skin is wet, so gauze dressings are preferred when the skin is difficult to keep dry. The chlorhexidine-impregnated dressings are typically available as a small sponge (e.g., Biopatch®) that is included in many central venous

catheter insertion sets.

Sterile gauze dressings and occlusive dressings are considered equivalent in preventing catheter colonization and infection (1–3). Chlorhexidine-impregnated dressings provide the best protection against catheter infections (1,2), but they are currently recommended only in settings where catheter-related infections are problematic (4).

| Replacing<br>Catheters | Routine or scheduled replacement of catheters is not necessary, and can create complications.                                                                                                                                                                                       |

#### *Dressing Changes*

The occlusive transparent dressings should be changed at least every 7 days, or when the adhesive seal is disrupted (2,3). In addition, *occlusive dressings can paradoxically promote colonization and infection when moisture or blood accumulates under the dressing* (5), and evidence of such should prompt a dressing change. Gauze dressings should be changed at least every 48 hours, or when the dressing is no longer dry (2,3).

# **Replacing Catheters**

Routine or scheduled replacement of catheters is not advised (3) because it does not reduce the incidence of catheter-related infections (6), and actually increases the risk of catheter-associated complications (both mechanical and infectious) (7,8).

### *Peripheral Vein Catheters*

Peripheral vein catheters are replaced when there is evidence of: (a) localized phlebitis (i.e., painful erythema around the insertion site, which can extend centrally along the course of the vein), (b) extravasation of the infusate, or (c) catheter obstruction that cannot be relieved (see later) (2). The phlebitis is typically the result of mechanical or chemical irritation of the target vessel, and does not represent infection (unless there is purulence emanating from the puncture site).

#### *Central Venous Catheters*

Central venous catheters are replaced when there is evidence of infection (either purulence at the insertion site or confirmed catheter-related septicemia). Catheter replacement is not necessary when there is erythema at the catheter insertion site without other signs of infection, since erythema alone is not predictive of catheter-related infection (9).

### **Flushing Catheters**

Vascular catheters that are used intermittently are at risk of developing an occlusive thrombosis when not in use. To prevent this, the catheters are flushed at regular intervals, and the flush solution is left in the lumen of the catheter when it is not in use (known as "locking" the catheter). Flush solutions have traditionally contained heparin (in concentrations ranging from 10 to 1,000 units/mL, in isotonic saline), but these solutions are concerning because of the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (see Chapter 13). Isotonic saline has proven as effective as heparinized saline as a flushing and locking solution (10), and *preservative-free saline is now recommended as the preferred solution for flushing and locking venous catheters* (11). However, this is not the case for arterial catheters (12), where 1.4% sodium citrate is a suitable alternative to heparinized saline for maintaining catheter patency (13).

# **Occluded Catheters**

Occlusion of indwelling vascular catheters is common, and can be the result of thrombus formation (60% of cases) mechanical factors (e.g., constriction from a suture), catheter malposition, or insoluble precipitates from drugs or minerals in the infusate (14). The occlusion can be partial or complete, and can appear as sluggish flow, loss of flow, or frequent triggering of alarms on infusion pumps (indicating excessive infusion pressures). Aspiration of blood through the catheter becomes difficult, or is not possible. (*Note:* Small-barrel syringes are preferred for aspiration through a catheter because they generate smaller negative pressures, and are less likely to collapse the lumen of the catheter.)

### *Restoring Patency*

Short, peripheral vein catheters that become occluded are typically replaced, but for long catheters that are more difficult to replace (e.g., central venous catheters), every effort should be made to restore patency. Advancing a guidewire through the catheter to restore patency is not advised, since this can dislodge an obstructing mass and create an embolus. Chemical dissolution of the obstructing mass (described next) is the standard method of restoring patency.

**THROMBOTIC OCCLUSION:** Since thrombosis is the most common cause of catheter occlusion, the initial attempt to restore patency should involve the local instillation of a thrombolytic agent. Alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) is currently the favored thrombolytic agent for restoring catheter patency; the regimen shown in [Table](#page-2-0) 3.2 can restore patency in 80–90% of occluded catheters (15,16). There are 11 reports of angioedema associated with this regimen (17), and no reports of abnormal bleeding (16).

- 3. If the occlusion persists, wait another 90 minutes (total dwell time = 120 min) and attempt to withdraw blood from the catheter.
- 4. If the occlusion persists, prepare a second dose of alteplase (2 mg) and repeat steps 1–3.
- 5. If patency is restored, withdraw 5 mL of blood through the catheter to remove any residual clot.
- 6. If this regimen does not restore patency, consider the non-thrombotic sources of obstruction in [Table](#page-3-0) 3.3.

**NON-THROMBOTIC OCCLUSION:** Failure of the thrombolytic regimen to restore patency should prompt consideration of the non-thrombotic causes of catheter occlusion shown in [Table](#page-3-0) 3.3. Note that alkaline precipitates are cleared with an alkaline solution (sodium bicarbonate or sodium hydroxide) and acidic precipitates are cleared with an acid (hydrochloric acid), while lipid residues can be cleared with 70% ethanol (11,14).

# **NON-INFECTIOUS COMPLICATIONS**

The non-infectious complications of indwelling catheters include catheter-related venous thrombosis and vascular perforation.

### **Catheter-Related Thrombosis**

Indwelling catheters can trigger localized thrombus formation by injuring the vascular endothelium, or by platelet adhesion to the catheter. Catheter-related thrombosis is especially prevalent with peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs), but the thrombosis is clinically silent in more than 95% of cases (18). There is an increased risk of catheter-related thrombosis in cancer patients, especially those with long-term, tunneled catheters for chemotherapy (19).

#### *Upper Extremity Thrombosis*

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is not limited to the lower extremities; i.e., about 5% of cases involve the deep veins above the elbow (19,20), and as many as 90% of these are attributed to the presence of a catheter (e.g., a midline catheter or PICC) (20). The other risk factor for this type of DVT is malignancy; i.e., one-quarter to one-third of patients with upper extremity DVT have an active malignancy (19).

Upper extremity DVT can be clinically silent, and the only consequence may be difficulty aspirating blood through the involved catheter. Complete thrombotic obstruction eventually produces swelling of the upper arm, which can be accompanied by discomfort, paresthesias, arm weakness, and engorgement of the superficial veins around the shoulder (Urschel's sign!) (19). The thrombosis can also propagate into the superior vena cava, but the *superior vena cava syndrome* (with facial swelling, headache, etc.) is a rare consequence of catheter-associated DVT (21). Finally, fewer than 10% of upper extremity DVTs are associated with symptomatic pulmonary emboli (22).

**DIAGNOSIS:** Compression ultrasonography is the diagnostic test of choice for upper extremity DVT (see Figure 1.7 for a normal compression test). A positive test (i.e., clot-filled veins are not compressible) has s sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 96% for upper extremity DVT (19). D-dimer levels are not reliable as a screening test for DVT because critically ill patients often have elevated D-dimer levels.

**MANAGEMENT:** Removal of the offending catheter is not mandatory in upper extremity DVT, and is recommended only when arm swelling is severe or painful, or when anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated (19,20). The anticoagulant regimens used for lower extremity DVT have been adopted for the upper extremity. These regimens are described in Chapter 22.

#### *Lower Extremity Thrombosis*

Femoral vein catheters are considered high-risk for catheter-related thrombosis, especially when left in place for several days. However, the reported incidence of symptomatic DVT with these catheters is only 1.6% (23), and there is no documented correlation between the duration of catheter use and the appearance of DVT (23). Therefore, the risk of DVT with these catheters is overstated.

### **Vascular Perforation**

Perforation of the superior vena cava or right atrium is an uncommon but potentially lifethreatening complication of central venous cannulation. This complication is also avoidable with vigilance for malpositioned catheters.

### *Superior Vena Cava Perforation*

Left-sided central venous catheters that are advanced into the superior vena cava (SVC) do not always make the acute turn downward toward the right atrium. When this occurs, the tip of the catheter abuts the lateral wall of the SVC, as shown in the upper chest x-ray in [Figure](#page-5-0) 3.1. If the catheter remains in this position, the tip of the catheter can erode through the vessel wall, resulting in leakage of blood and intravenous fluids into the mediastinum and pleural space. The symptoms from SVC perforation i.e. (substernal chest pain, cough, and dyspnea) are nonspecific, and suspicion of perforation is often prompted by the sudden appearance of mediastinal widening and a pleural effusion on the chest x-ray, like the lower x-ray in [Figure](#page-5-0) 3.1 (24).

<span id="page-5-0"></span>![](_page_5_Picture_4.jpeg)

**FIGURE 3.1** Chest x-rays showing a subclavian vein catheter that is positioned to perforate the superior vena cava (upper panel), and a similarly positioned catheter that has perforated the vena cava (lower panel). Lower chest x-ray from Reference 24.

**DIAGNOSIS:** The pleural effusions can be largely composed of intravenous fluids that escape through the perforation; as such, a thoracentesis can support the diagnosis of SVC perforation if the pleural fluid is similar in composition to the intravenous infusion fluid. The perforation is confirmed by injecting radiocontrast dye through the catheter and noting the presence of dye in the mediastinum or pleural space.

**MANAGEMENT:** When vena cava perforation is first suspected, infusion through the catheter should be stopped immediately. If the diagnosis is confirmed, the catheter should be removed (this does not provoke mediastinal bleeding) (24). Antibiotic therapy is not necessary unless there is evidence of infection in the pleural fluid (24).

### *Cardiac Tamponade*

The most life-threatening complication of central venous catheters is cardiac tamponade from a catheter tip that perforates the right atrium. Fortunately, this complication is rare (see References 44 and 45 in Chapter 1). The first sign of tamponade is usually the abrupt onset of dyspnea, which can progress to cardiovascular collapse within an hour. The diagnosis requires ultrasound evidence of a pericardial effusion with diastolic collapse of the right heart, and immediate pericardiocentesis is necessary to reduce the pericardial pressure and allow the right heart to fill. Emergency thoracotomy may also be necessary if there is a large tear in the wall of the heart. The mortality rate in this condition varies from 40% to 100% in published reports (25).

# **CATHETER-RELATED BLOODSTREAM INFECTIONS**

Indwelling vascular catheters (with the exception of short, peripheral vein catheters) are the leading source of nosocomial bloodstream infections, and septicemia from indwelling catheters has a mortality rate of 12–25% in ICU patients (26,27). The average rate of infections involving central venous access catheters is 4.6 per 1,000 catheter days (28).

# **Pathogenesis**

Colonization of indwelling vascular catheters has several potential sources, as indicated in Figure 3.2. Each of these sources is described below using the [corresponding](#page-7-0) numbers in the illustration.

- 1. Microbes can gain access to the bloodstream via contaminated infusates (e.g., blood products), but this occurs rarely.
- 2. Contamination of the internal lumen of vascular catheters can occur through break points in the infusion system, such as catheter hubs. This may be a prominent route of infection for catheters inserted through subcutaneous tunnels.
- 3. Microbes on the skin can migrate along the subcutaneous tract of an indwelling catheter. This is considered the principal route of infection for percutaneous (non-tunneled) catheters, which includes most of the catheters used in the ICU. (For a novel view concerning this route of

infection, see A FINAL WORD at the very end of the chapter).

4. Microorganisms in circulating blood can attach to the intravascular portion of the catheter. The catheter is not considered the primary source of infection in this situation, but it is possible that the proliferation of the microbes on the catheter reaches a point where the catheter becomes a source of bacteremia.

<span id="page-7-0"></span>![](_page_7_Picture_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 3.2** Sources of microbial colonization of intravascular catheters. See text for explanation.

### *Biofilms*

Microbes have a propensity to congregate on inert surfaces. Once in contact with a surface, they releases adhesive molecules (called *adhesins*, of course) that firmly attach them to the surface. They then begin secreting an extracellular matrix (known as *slime*) that consists of polysaccharides, proteins, fibrin, and extracellular DNA (29). This extracellular matrix creates a protective environment called a *biofilm* that allows microbes to thrive and proliferate without being damaged by the surrounding environment. Phagocytic cells are unable to ingest organisms that are embedded in a biofilm, and *antibiotic concentrations that eradicate free-living bacteria must be 100 to 1,000 times higher to eradicate bacteria in biofilms* (30).

Biofilms are ubiquitous in nature, and predominate on surfaces that are exposed to moisture. (The slippery film that covers rocks in a stream is a familiar example of a biofilm.) They also form on indwelling medical devices such as endotracheal tubes, urinary catheters, and vascular catheters, and can be found on biological surfaces such as the oral mucosa, the epithelial surface in the airways, the mucosal lining of the GI tract, and the surface of native heart valves.

**CATHETER-RELATED INFECTIONS:** Biofilms play an important role in catheter-related infections, as shown by the following observations:

- 1. Examination of indwelling vascular catheters with scanning electron microscopy has revealed extensive biofilm formation on the surface of the catheters, including those that were in place for only one day (31).
- 2. Coagulase-negative staphylococci, which are the leading cause of catheter-related infections, readily adhere to polymer surfaces and produce slime (32). A biofilm of *Staphylococcus*

<span id="page-8-0"></span>*epidermidis* is shown in [Figure](#page-8-0) 3.3.

![](_page_8_Picture_1.jpeg)

**FIGURE 3.3** Electron micrograph of *Staphylococcus epidermidis* encased in a biofilm. Image courtesy of Jeanne VanBriesen, Ph.D., Carnegie Mellon University. Image colorized digitally.

The ubiquitous presence of biofilms on indwelling vascular catheters means that antibiotic therapy is not the optimal treatment for catheter-related bloodstream infections. (The doses of antibiotics needed to achieve bactericidal levels in biofilms would be toxic to the host.) Several anti-biofilm strategies are being evaluated (33), but nothing has reached clinical testing at this time.

### **Clinical Features**

Catheter-related infections do not appear in the first 48 hours after catheter insertion (which presumably is the time required for colonization of the catheter tip). When they do appear, the clinical manifestations are non-specific: e.g.,

- 1. Fever and leukocytosis are common manifestations, but these are signs of inflammation, and are not evidence of infection.
- 2. There may be erythema around the catheter insertion site, but this has no predictive value for identifying catheter-related infections (9).
- 3. Purulent drainage from the catheter insertion site is evidence of infection, but it can be an exitsite infection, without invasion of the bloodstream (34).

Because of the non-specific nature of these clinical findings, the diagnosis of catheter-related infections is not possible on clinical grounds.

### **Diagnosis**

The diagnosis of catheter-related septicemia requires a positive blood culture from a site other than the catheter, plus some evidence that the catheter is the source of the positive blood culture (and is not secondarily seeded). This evidence was originally provided by a semiquantitative culture of the catheter tip, but this method fell from favor because it required removal of the catheter (which is not desirable, because many cases of suspected catheter-related infection are not confirmed), and the outer surface of the catheter was cultured, thereby missing infections arising from the lumen(s) of the catheter. The culture methods that are currently recommended are summarized in [Table](#page-9-0) 3.4 (35,36).

**FIGURE 3.4** Culture plates from a case of catheter-related septicemia showing denser growth in blood drawn through a central venous catheter *(Catheter Blood)* compared to blood from a

#### *Quantitative Culture Method*

This method uses paired blood cultures (one drawn through the catheter, and one from a peripheral venipuncture site), and is based on the expectation that if the catheter is the source of a bloodstream infection, blood drawn through the catheter will have a higher growth density than the peripheral blood. This requires a "quantitative" blood culture, where growth is expressed as the number of colony forming units per mL (like urine cultures). The diagnosis of catheterrelated infection is confirmed if the same organism is isolated from catheter blood and peripheral blood, and the colony count in catheter blood is at least 3 times greater than the colony count in peripheral blood. An example of the comparative growth density in a case of catheter-related septicemia is shown in [Figure](#page-9-1) 3.4.

### *Timed Culture Method*

This method also uses paired blood cultures (one drawn through the catheter, and one from a peripheral venipuncture site), and is based on the expectation that if the catheter is the source of a bloodstream infection, the blood withdrawn through the catheter will show microbial growth at an earlier time than peripheral blood. This method uses routine (qualitative) blood cultures, and the diagnosis of catheter-related infection is confirmed if the same organism is isolated from the catheter blood and peripheral blood, and growth is detected at least 2 hours earlier in the catheter blood.

#### *Which Method is Preferred?*

Neither method is clearly superior to the other. The quantitative method has a sightly higher accuracy (37), but the difference is small (94% versus 91%), and may not justify the higher cost of the quantitative method. There is actually little enthusiasm for either culture method, and the diagnosis of catheter-related infection is often based on the same organism being isolated in catheter blood and peripheral blood, with no other apparent source of infection.

**HOW MANY LUMENS TO CULTURE?** Central venous catheters typically have three lumens (and can have four) and each lumen is a potential source of septicemia (38). However, the recommended practice is to obtain catheter-derived blood cultures from a single lumen (34). The problem with this practice is highlighted by a study showing that *38% of catheter-related infections would be missed if single-lumen cultures were used in the diagnostic evaluation* (39). Using a pooled blood culture from all lumens (to reduce the volume of blood needed to culture multiple lumens) has not proven to be as sensitive as cultures from each lumen (40). At the present time, the available evidence indicates that *the diagnostic approach to catheter-related infection is optimal when blood cultures are drawn through each lumen of the catheter*.

## **Management**

Empiric antibiotics are recommended for all ICU patients with suspected catheter-related infection, and they should be started immediately after cultures are obtained. The pathogens that are most frequently involved in catheter-related infections are shown in [Table](#page-10-0) 3.5. This list is from the National Healthcare Safety Network (41), and it represents the summed contribution of 4,515 hospitals. Note that staphylococci and enterococci together account for 45% of all offending pathogens.

### *Empiric Antibiotic Therapy*

The recommendations for empiric antibiotic coverage are shown in [Table](#page-11-0) 3.6. Van comycin is the backbone of the empiric regimen because it is the most active agent against staphylococci (including coagulase-negative and methicillin-resistant strains), and enterococci. Daptomycin can substitute for vancomycin if there is evidence of van comycinresistance. Empiric coverage for gram-negative enteric organisms is advised for neutropenic or seriously ill patients (35); suitable antibiotics include the carbapenems (e.g., meropenem), the fourth-generation cephalosporins (e.g., cefepime), and the β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations (e.g., piperacillin/tazobactam). Additional gram-negative coverage (with an aminoglycoside) is recommended when multidrug-resistant gram-negative organisms are possible offenders

Empiric coverage for candidemia is recommended when the conditions listed in [Table](#page-11-0) 3.6 are present. The echinocandins (caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin) are more active than the azoles (e.g., fluconazole) against all *Candida* species and thus are favored for empiric antifungal coverage (35).

### *Catheter Management*

As mentioned earlier, most cases of suspected catheter-related infections are not con firmed by culture results: e.g., in one study, 1,527 catheters were removed for suspected catheter-related infection, and the diagnosis was confirmed in only 169 (11%) of the cases (28). Therefore, catheters should be left in place pending culture results.

INDICATIONS FOR CATHETER REMOVAL: If the diagnosis of catheter-related infection is confirmed, catheters should be removed if any of the following is present:

- 1. Hemodynamic instability or progressive multiorgan dysfunction.
- 2. Evidence of endocarditis or septic thrombophlebitis.
- 3. Infections with *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Candida* species, *Pseudomonas* species, or multidrugresistant gram-negative bacilli.
- 4. Persistent bacteremia for >96 hrs despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy.

Catheters should not be replaced over a guidewire, but instead should be removed and reinserted at a new venipuncture site. However, guidewire replacement may be the best option if there is very limited venous access.

There is an increasing tendency to leave catheters in place, because inserting a new catheter is time consuming, costly, and can be risky. Even guidewire exchanges can have complications (7). When a catheter is left in place, systemic antibiotics will have limited or no efficacy in decontaminating the catheter (because of the biofilm on the catheter), and recurrent infections are expected (42). In this situation, antibiotic lock therapy should be considered.

**ANTIBIOTIC LOCK THERAPY:** Instilling concentrated antibiotic solutions into indwelling catheters and allowing an extended dwell time will enhance the ability to disrupt biofilms and eradicate persistent organisms (35). The antibiotic "lock" solution contains the same antibiotic used systemically, in a concentration of 2–5 mg/mL in heparinized saline. This solution is injected into each lumen of the indwelling catheter and allowed to dwell for 24 hours, and is replaced every 24 hours for the duration of the systemic antibiotic therapy. If the catheter is never idle and antibiotic lock therapy is not possible, the systemic antibiotic(s) should be delivered through the suspect lumen.

#### *Duration of Antimicrobial Treatment*

The duration of antibiotic therapy is determined by several factors, including the offending pathogen, the status of the catheter (i.e., replaced or retained), and the response to antimicrobial therapy. The following are some general suggestions (34):

1. If the infection involves a microbe with limited pathogenicity (e.g., coagulase-negative staphylococci), and there is a favorable response to antimicrobial therapy within 72 hours, then

aCarbapenems include imipenem, meropenem, and doripenem.

b Echinocandins include caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin.

no more than 7 days of treatment is necessary (34).

- 2. For cases of *Staph aureus* bacteremia, the accepted practice is to look for evidence of endocarditis with transesophageal ultrasound (the rationale for this is stated later). If there is no evidence of endocarditis, antibiotic therapy can be limited to 14 days if the following conditions are satisfied: the catheter has been removed, the patient is not immunocompromised, and there are no intravascular prosthetic devices in place (34). Evidence of endocarditis mandates 4–6 weeks of antimicrobial therapy, and an infectious disease consult.
- 3. For infections caused by enterococci or gram-negative bacilli, 7–14 days of antibiotic therapy is advised, regardless of whether the catheter is replaced or retained (34).

# **Persistent Sepsis**

Continued signs of sepsis or persistent septicemia after 72 hours of antimicrobial therapy should prompt a search for the following conditions.

### *Suppurative Thrombophlebitis*

The thrombi that form around indwelling vascular catheters can trap microbes from a colonized catheter. These microbes can then proliferate (since blood is a good culture medium) and transform the thrombus into an intravascular abscess. This condition is known as *suppurative thrombophlebitis*, and the most common offending organism is *Staphylococcus aureus* (34). Clinical manifestations are often absent, but can include purulent drainage from the catheter insertion site, limb swelling from thrombotic venous occlusion, and multiple cavitary lesions in the lungs from septic emboli.

The diagnosis of septic thrombophlebitis requires evidence of thrombosis in the cannulated blood vessel (by ultrasound) and persistent septicemia with no other apparent source. Treatment includes catheter removal and systemic antibiotic therapy for 4–6 weeks (2). Surgical excision of the infected thrombus is usually not necessary, and is reserved for cases of refractory septicemia. There is no consensus on the use of heparin anticoagulation in suppurative thrombophlebitis, and current guidelines (34) recommend that heparin therapy should be considered.

### *Endocarditis*

Nosocomial endocarditis is uncommon, with the reported incidence in university teaching hospitals being 2–3 cases annually (43,44). Vascular catheters are implicated in 30 to 50% of cases, and staphylococci (mostly *S. aureus*) are the offending organisms in up to 75% of cases (43,44). Methicillin-resistant strains of *S. aureus* (MRSA) predominate in some reports (45).

Typical manifestations of endocarditis (e.g., new or changing cardiac murmur) can be absent in as many as two-thirds of patients with nosocomial endocarditis involving *Staphylococcus aureus* (45), which is why a search for endocarditis (with transesophageal ultrasound) is advised for all patients with *S. aureus* bacteremia.

# **A FINAL WORD**

# **A Novel View of Catheter-Related Infections**

One of the core beliefs in critical care is the notion that catheter-related bloodstream infections are caused by skin microbes that travel down the tract of the catheter and colonize the distal end of the catheter. This paradigm for catheter-related infections is rarely questioned, yet there are a number of observations that do not fit the model. The following observations suggest that the skin is *not* the source of catheter colonization and infection.

- 1. There is a poor correlation between the organisms found on the skin at the catheter insertion site, and the organisms found on the distal end of central venous catheters (46).
- 2. Decontamination of the catheter insertion site with antibiotic ointments does not reduce the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections (3).
- 3. The shortest route for skin microbes to enter the bloodstream is via peripheral vein catheters, which sit in superficial veins, yet these catheters are rarely implicated as a cause of catheterrelated septicemia.

The next set of observations suggest that the bowel is the source of catheter-related infections:

- 1. Gram-negative bacilli, enterococci, and *Candida* species account for about half of the microbes that are responsible for catheter-related infections (see [Table](#page-10-0) 3.5), and these organisms are inhabitants of the bowel, not the skin.
- 2. In cases of catheter-related infections, cultures of the upper GI tract show a better correlation with catheter tip cultures than cultures of the skin around the catheter insertion site (47).
- 3. Decontamination of the bowel with nonabsorbable antibiotics has been shown to markedly reduce the incidence of catheter-related infections, and in some studies, these infections were completely abolished by bowel decontamination (48).

The prominence of staphylococci in catheter-related infections does not eliminate the bowel as a source of these infections because staphylococci are prominent inhabitants of the bowel during prolonged antibiotic therapy (49), and in critically ill patients (50). In fact *Staphylococcus epidermidis* (the leading cause of catheter-related infections) *is one of the most prevalent organisms in the upper GI tract of patients with multiorgan failure* (50). The species name *epidermidis* is thus a misnomer, since these organisms do not exclusively inhabit the epidermis.

The catheters that are responsible for catheter-related infections are lengthy (i.e., 6 to 12 inches for central venous catheters, and 15 to 20 inches for peripherally inserted central catheters) and the long intravascular segments of these catheters may be prone to seeding during occult or transient bacteremias. Once seeded, microbial proliferation on the catheter could reach the point where the catheter seeds the bloodstream, creating the appearance of a primary catheter-related bloodstream infection. Seeding of the catheters with bowel organisms is very possible, because the bowel is considered a prominent source of occult sepsis in critically ill patients (50). (See Chapter 4.)

Why does this matter? Because if the skin is not the site of origin for catheter-related infections, then we are spending a lot of time and money decontaminating the wrong surface.
