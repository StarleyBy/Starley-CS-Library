# **Oximetry and Capnography**

*The killing vice of a young doctor is intellectual laziness.*

Sir William Osler (*[a](#page-12-0)*)

The introduction of optical techniques for the noninvasive and continuous monitoring of oxyhemoglobin saturation in blood (oximetry) and carbon dioxide levels in exhaled gas (capnography) is simply the most useful innovation in critical care monitoring since the advent of intensive care units (in this author's opinion). The reach of "pulse" oximetry has extended beyond the ICU, and even beyond the hospital, with the pulse oximetry measurement being proposed as the fifth vital sign ([1\)](#page-12-1), while exhaled CO<sup>2</sup> monitoring has become an indispensable tool for ensuring the safety of procedural sedation, and for predicting the outcome of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

Despite the ubiquity and promise of pulse oximetry and capnography, there is evidence that the understanding of these techniques is far from satisfactory [\(2](#page-12-2)). The information in this chapter should help to correct this deficiency.

# **OXIMETRY: METHODOLOGY**

Molecules absorb light at wavelengths that are specific for each molecule. This is the basis for the technique of *spectrophotometry*, which uses light waves to identify the molecular composition of a medium. The application of this technique to the detection of hemoglobin in its different forms is known as *oximetry*.

# **Light Absorption by Hemoglobin**

Hemoglobin (like all proteins) changes its structural configuration when it participates in a chemical reaction, and each of the hemoglobin configurations has a distinct pattern of light absorption. This is demonstrated in [Figure](#page-1-0) 7.1 [\(3](#page-12-3)). Four different forms of hemoglobin are represented: oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO<sup>2</sup> ) deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hb), methemoglobin (metHb) and carboxyhemoglobin (COHb). In the red region of the light spectrum (represented by the wavelength of 660 nm), oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO<sup>2</sup> ) does not absorb light as well as deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hb), which is why oxygenated blood is more intensely red than

deoxygenated blood. The opposite is true in the infrared region of the spectrum (represented by the wavelength of 940 nm), where HbO<sup>2</sup> absorbs light more effectively than Hb. Based on these absorption patterns, two wavelengths of light (660 nm and 940 nm) can be used to identify oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin.

# **Early Oximetry**

Oximetry was introduced in the 1940s to detect hypoxemia in fighter pilots. The early use of oximetry involved the transmission of red and infrared light beams through the earlobes, but this methodology had two major shortcomings: (a) the transmission of light was influenced by factors other than hemoglobin (e.g., skin pigments, tissue thickness), and (b) it was not possible to differentiate between the hemoglobin in arteries and veins. As a result of these problems, oximetry failed to gain acceptance as a monitoring tool until the 1970s, when *pulse oximetry* was introduced.

# **Pulse Oximetry**

When a light beam passes through a pulsating artery, the phasic changes in arterial blood volume create pulsatile variations in the intensity of the transmitted light beam. This is demonstrated in the "photoplethysmogram" in [Figure](#page-2-0) 7.2, which shows that the increase in arterial blood volume during systole is associated with a decrease in the transmission of light through the artery. Therefore, restricting the analysis of red and infrared light transmission to the systolic fraction of the photoplethysmogram (A/B in [Figure](#page-2-0) 7.2) will focus the analysis on arterial blood, thereby

reducing or eliminating errors due to light absorption by non-pulsatile elements (e.g., hemoglobin in veins). This is the basic principle for pulse oximetry ([3,](#page-12-3)[4\)](#page-12-4).

### *Fingertip Pulse Oximetry*

Pulse oximetry is typically performed with a fingertip probe like the one in [Figure](#page-3-0) 7.3. One side of the probe contains two light-emitting diodes that emit monochromatic light at wavelengths of 660 nm and 940 nm. These light waves pass through the finger and are sensed by a photodetector on the opposite side of the probe. These probes also generate a pulsatile photoplethysmography tracing, which is shown at the bottom of the figure. (Note that the tracing is reversed to resemble an arterial pressure waveform.) The intensity of light transmission during the systolic portion of the photoplethysmography tracing is used as a reflection of the deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hb, at 660 nm) and oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO<sup>2</sup> , at 940 nm) in arterial blood. The ratio of HbO<sup>2</sup> to total hemoglobin (HbO<sup>2</sup> + Hb) is then used to define the fraction of hemoglobin that is saturated with oxygen. The resulting "pulse oximeter saturation" (SpO<sup>2</sup> ) is expressed as a percentage:

<span id="page-2-0"></span>![](_page_2_Figure_3.jpeg)

**FIGURE 7.2** Photoplethysmography tracing showing the changes in light transmission resulting from the pulsatile change in arterial blood volume. A = systolic amplitude, B = baseline transmission. See text for further explanation.

**FIGURE 7.3** Pulse oximetry using a fingertip probe. The bottom panel shows the pulsatile photoplethysmography tracing. See text for explanation.

$$SpO_2 = (HbO_2 / Hb + HbO_2) \times 100$$
 (7.1)

### *Forehead Pulse Oximetry*

The forehead is an appealing site for pulse oximetry because the arterial circulation in the forehead (which originates from the internal carotid artery) is less prone to vasoconstriction than the digital arteries in the fingers [\(5](#page-12-5)). Clinical studies have shown that pulse oximetry in the forehead can provide suitable SpO<sup>2</sup> measurements when fingertip SpO<sup>2</sup> recordings are compromised by hypotension or peripheral vasoconstriction [\(6](#page-12-6)).

Unlike fingertip oximetry, which is based on light *transmission*, forehead oximetry relies on light *reflectance*. This is illustrated in the right-sided panel in [Figure](#page-4-0) 7.4. The forehead oximetry probe contains light-emitting diodes and photodetectors positioned next to each other, and the intensity of light reflected back from the underlying arteries is recorded and processed to derive the SpO<sup>2</sup> . (*Note:* This is also the method used by smartwatches to monitor arterial oxygenation.)

**THE ELASTIC HEADBAND:** Venous pulsations can be prominent in the forehead region (especially during positive-pressure ventilation), and can be misread as arterial pulsations, resulting in spurious SpO<sup>2</sup> recordings. Elastic headbands have been shown to reduce the risk of interference from venous pulsations [\(7](#page-12-7)), and these headbands are used routinely with forehead pulse oximetry.

<span id="page-4-0"></span>![](_page_4_Figure_1.jpeg)

**FIGURE 7.4** Forehead pulse oximetry., The forehead probe (circled in red) is placed just above the eyebrows, and is secured with an elastic headband to reduce venous pulsations. This method uses light reflectance to determine the SpO<sup>2</sup> . See text for further explanation.

# **CO-Oximetry**

Standard pulse oximeters do not detect carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) or methemoglobin (metHb) in blood. This requires additional wavelengths of light, and these are available in devices called "CO-oximeters" that generate up to 8 wavelengths of light to measure all forms of hemoglobin. These devices are located in clinical laboratories, and require an arterial blood sample. There is also a portable "pulse CO-oximeter" (Rainbow Pulse CO-oximeter, Masimo Corp, Irvine, CA) that has been used by firefighters and emergency personnel to detect carbon monoxide intoxication, but the accuracy of this device has been inconsistent [\(4](#page-12-4)).

Normally, metHb and COHb account for less than 5% of the total hemoglobin pool in blood ([7,](#page-12-7)[8\)](#page-12-8). When these hemoglobin variants are abnormally elevated, the arterial O<sup>2</sup> saturation (SaO<sup>2</sup> ) decreases because HbO<sup>2</sup> is a lower fraction of the total hemoglobin pool. However, the SpO<sup>2</sup> from pulse oximetry is only marginally influenced by COHb or metHb levels [\(9](#page-12-9)[–11](#page-12-10)). Therefore, *in cases of methemoglobinemia and carbon monoxide poisoning, the SpO<sup>2</sup> overestimates the actual SaO<sup>2</sup> , and is not a reliable marker of arterial O<sup>2</sup> desaturation.* When abnormal elevations of metHb or COHb are suspected, an arterial blood sample should be sent to the hospital laboratory for a complete oximetry assessment. (Carbon monoxide poisoning and methemoglobinemia are described in Chapter 53.)

# **Accuracy**

The accuracy of a single SpO<sup>2</sup> measurement is 3–4%, and the accuracy of serial measurements is 2–3% ([4\)](#page-12-4). The SpO<sup>2</sup> is usually higher than the arterial O<sup>2</sup> saturation (SaO<sup>2</sup> ), which may reflect the undetected decrease in SaO<sup>2</sup> from the small amounts of COHb and metHb in blood. The discrepancy between SpO<sup>2</sup> and SaO<sup>2</sup> is greater (by 1–3%) in subjects with dark skin pigmentation [\(12](#page-12-11)).

### *Undetected Hypoxemia*

The tendency for the SpO<sup>2</sup> to overestimate the SaO<sup>2</sup> can result in instances of undetected hypoxemia, and these are more frequent in patients with dark skin pigmentation [\(8](#page-12-8)[,9](#page-12-9)). In one study that included 88,000 paired measurements of SaO<sup>2</sup> and SpO<sup>2</sup> , the incidence of undetected hypoxemia (i.e., SaO<sup>2</sup> <88% with SpO<sup>2</sup> ≥92%) was 6.9% in Blacks, 6.0% in Hispanics, and 4.9% in Whites and Asians. Since these discrepancies were recorded at one point in time, their clinical significance is unclear.

# **OXIMETRY: APPLICATIONS**

Pulse oximetry is indicated in any situation where arterial oxygenation is a concern, and it is considered a requirement for patient safety in certain areas of the hospital (e.g., ICUs and operating suites). Therefore, the important issue concerning pulse oximetry in the ICU is not when to use it, but how to use it. The following information is relevant in this regard.

## **Arterial Oxygenation**

As a surrogate measure of the arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO<sup>2</sup> ), the SpO<sup>2</sup> provides information about the oxygen concentration in arterial blood (CaO<sup>2</sup> ). The determinants of CaO<sup>2</sup> are identified in the following equation:

$$CaO_2 = 1.34 \times [Hb] \times SaO_2 \tag{7.2}$$

where 1.34 is the oxygen binding capacity of hemoglobin (mL/g), [Hb] is the hemoglobin concentration (g/dL), and SaO<sup>2</sup> is expressed as a percentage, but in decimal notation (e.g., 0.75 instead of 75%). For a healthy adult with [Hb] = 15 g/dL and SaO<sup>2</sup> = 0.98, the CaO<sup>2</sup> is (1.34 × 15 x 0.98) = 19.7 mL/dL (or 197 mL/L).

# *Target SpO<sup>2</sup>*

The most recent clinical practice guideline for oxygen therapy recommends a target SpO<sup>2</sup> of 90– 94% for most patients, and a slightly lower target (88–92%) for patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure ([10\)](#page-12-12). (For more on the target SpO<sup>2</sup> during oxygen therapy, see Chapter 25.) A change in SpO<sup>2</sup> of 3–4% is considered a significant change [\(4](#page-12-4)).

### **Venous Oximetry**

Oximetry can also be used to measure the O<sup>2</sup> saturation in venous blood from the pulmonary artery (i.e., mixed venous blood) or the superior vena cava (i.e., central venous blood). This

measurement can be obtained by sending a blood sample (from either site) to the lab for CO-oximetry, but there are also specialized "oximetry catheters" that can continuously monitor the venous  $O_2$  saturation in the superior vena cava or pulmonary artery. The operation of these catheters is illustrated in Figure 7.5. Oximetry catheters contain fiberoptic bundles that emit two wavelengths of light from the tip of the catheter (the same two wavelength used in pulse oximeters). Another channel of the catheter is connected to a photodetector that records the intensity of light that is reflected back from the hemoglobin in circulating erythrocytes. This technique (reflectance oximetry) is similar to the one used in forehead pulse oximetry. Oximetry catheters process and display the venous  $O_2$  saturation every 5 seconds.

<span id="page-6-0"></span>![](_page_6_Picture_1.jpeg)

**FIGURE 7.5** Continuous monitoring of venous  $O_2$  saturation (SvO<sub>2</sub>) using catheters capable of reflectance oximetry. See text for explanation.

### Venous O2 Saturation

The venous  $O_2$  saturation (SvO<sub>2</sub>) is a reflection of the balance between systemic  $O_2$  delivery (DO<sub>2</sub>) and  $O_2$  consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>), as described by the equation below:

$$SvO_2 = 1 - VO_2/DO_2$$
 (7.3)

(For the derivation of this equation, see Chapter 9.) Thus, a decrease in  $SvO_2$  from its normal value of 70 - 75% indicates a decrease in  $O_2$  delivery relative to  $O_2$  consumption.

## Mixed Venous O<sub>2</sub> Saturation

The  $O_2$  saturation in the pulmonary arteries (called the "mixed venous"  $O_2$  saturation) is an "averaged"  $SvO_2$  from all venous effluents (except the bronchial veins, which drain into the pulmonary veins). This measurement requires a pulmonary artery catheter (described in the next chapter), and there are specialized pulmonary artery oximetry catheters that continuously monitor the  $SvO_2$  with an accuracy of 1–2% (13). Studies in ventilator-dependent patients

showed that the  $SvO_2$  varies an average of 5–6% over just a few hours in patients who are clinically stable (14). Therefore as a general rule, a change in  $SvO_2$  is considered significant if it exceeds 5% and persists for longer than 10 minutes (15).

### Central Venous O<sub>2</sub> Saturation

The decreased popularity of the pulmonary artery catheter has shifted attention to the  $O_2$  saturation in the superior vena cava, called the "central venous  $O_2$  saturation" ( $ScvO_2$ ), as a surrogate measure of the  $SvO_2$ . The  $ScvO_2$  measured by central venous oximetry catheters is slightly lower than the  $SvO_2$ , but in patients with circulatory shock, the  $ScvO_2$  is greater than the  $SvO_2$  (16). (This change is attributed to the redistribution of blood flow to the cerebral circulation in circulatory shock.) Single measurements of  $ScvO_2$  can differ from  $SvO_2$  by as much as 10% in patients who are hemodynamically unstable, but the difference is reduced (to within 5%) when multiple measurements are obtained (17). Therefore, the  $ScvO_2$  seems most valuable in identifying *trends* in the balance between  $DO_2$  and  $VO_2$ .

### **Dual Oximetry**

The interpretive value of  $SvO_2$  (or  $ScvO_2$ ) can be enhanced by adding the  $SpO_2$  from pulse oximetry. The difference ( $SpO_2 - SvO_2$ ) is roughly equivalent to the  $O_2$  extraction from capillary blood (18), so the following relationships should hold:

$$VO_2 = DO_2 \times (SpO_2 - SvO_2) \tag{7.4}$$

(These relationships are described in detail in Chapter 9.) When  $O_2$  delivery (DO<sub>2</sub>) begins to decline (from a decrease in cardiac output, anemia, or hypoxemia), there is an increase in  $O_2$  extraction from capillary blood (SpO<sub>2</sub>–SvO<sub>2</sub>), and this helps to maintain a constant  $O_2$  consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>). The (SpO<sub>2</sub>–SvO<sub>2</sub>) increases in a linear fashion from a normal value of about 0.25 (25%) up to a value of about 0.50 (50%). Beyond this, any further decrease in DO<sub>2</sub> elicits less of an increase in (SpO<sub>2</sub>–SvO<sub>2</sub>), and this marks the onset of oxygen-limited metabolism. Therefore, the following interpretations of the (SpO<sub>2</sub>–SvO<sub>2</sub>) are possible:

- . An  $(SpO_2-SvO_2) > 25\%$  indicates that  $O_2$  delivery is reduced (from low cardiac output, anemia, or hypoxemia) relative to  $O_2$  consumption.
- . An  $(SpO_2-SvO_2)$  >25% but <50% indicates that  $O_2$  delivery is reduced, but not enough to compromise aerobic metabolism.
- . An (SpO<sub>2</sub>– SvO<sub>2</sub>)  $\geq$ 50% indicates a threat to aerobic metabolism.

The utility of  $(SpO_2-SvO_2)$  monitoring is demonstrated by a study showing that an  $(SpO_2-SvO_2)$   $\geq 50\%$  is a valid indicator for the transfusion of packed red blood cells to correct anemia (19).

# **CAPNOGRAPHY: METHODOLOGY**

The detection of CO<sup>2</sup> in exhaled gas can be done qualitatively (using colorimetric CO<sup>2</sup> detectors to verify entry into the trachea during endotracheal intubation) or quantitatively (using infrared capnography); this section will focus on the latter methodology and how it can be used.

### **Infrared Capnography**

The quantitative method of monitoring exhaled CO<sup>2</sup> is based on the ability of CO<sup>2</sup> to absorb light in the infrared spectrum. The use of this method during mechanical ventilation is illustrated in [Figure](#page-8-0) 7.6 ([20,](#page-12-20)[21\)](#page-12-21). An infrared CO<sup>2</sup> probe is placed between the ventilator and the patient, and it emits a continuous infrared light beam that travels through the respired gas [\(22](#page-12-22)). On the opposite side of the probe is a rapid-response photodetector that records the intensity of infrared light transmission and processes the information to generate a display of the changes in PCO<sup>2</sup> that occur during each exhalation. This is called a *capnogram*.

<span id="page-8-0"></span>![](_page_8_Figure_3.jpeg)

**FIGURE 7.6** Infrared capnography during mechanical ventilation. The CO<sup>2</sup> probe sits between the ventilator and the patient, and transmits a continuous infrared light beam through the respired gas. The photodetector processes the transmitted light and generates a record of the changes in PCO<sup>2</sup> that occur during each exhalation (the capnogram). See text for further explanation.

## *The Capnogram*

As shown in [Figure](#page-8-0) 7.6, the capnogram is separated into four phases. Phase I represents the very start of expiration, where the expired gas is from the anatomic dead space, and has negligible amounts of CO<sup>2</sup> . In phase II, the exhaled CO<sup>2</sup> steadily rises, and the rate of rise is rapid when alveolar ventilation is well matched to perfusion (i.e., in the normal lung). A slowly rising phase II indicates an increase in alveolar dead space (since these alveoli have a low PCO<sup>2</sup> ), which occurs in COPD. Phase III is normally a plateau, indicating that alveolar emptying has reached a

steady state, and Phase IV is the onset of inhalation.

#### **Nonintubated Patients**

End-tidal  $CO_2$  monitoring is also available for spontaneously breathing (non-intubated) patients using infrared  $CO_2$  probes that are specially designed for nasal cannulas and facemasks. An example of a  $CO_2$  detection system for nasal cannulas is illustrated in Figure 7.7. In this case, a miniaturized infrared  $CO_2$  probe (like the one in Figure 7.6) is placed in-line with a nasal cannula and an adapter that collects orally exhaled gas. Oxygen is delivered through another cannula in the system.

**FIGURE 7.7** A modified infrared  $CO_2$  probe (capONE, Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan) for monitoring end-tidal  $PCO_2$  during spontaneous breathing.

# **CAPNOGRAPHY: APPLICATIONS**

### **Procedures**

#### **Procedural Sedation**

The sedation used for a variety of procedures creates a risk of hypoventilation, especially in patients with any of the following conditions: advanced age, obesity, sleep apnea, or chronic  $CO_2$  retention from obstructive lung disease. Hypoventilation causes an increase in end-tidal  $PCO_2$  (PetCO<sub>2</sub>), and this change occurs before the decrease in  $SpO_2$ . Capnography has proven superior to oximetry for detecting hypoventilation during procedural sedation (20,23); as a result, monitoring  $PetCO_2$  is recommended in all instances where procedural sedation is used (24).

#### **Endotracheal Intubation**

For placement of endotracheal tubes, verification of tracheal placement with exhaled CO<sup>2</sup> detection (either with colorimetric or infrared CO<sup>2</sup> detectors) has become a "standard of care" ([25\)](#page-12-25) for the following reasons:

- 1. Unrecognized esophageal intubation (which can be fatal) is reported in one of every 18 emergency intubations in critically ill patients ([26\)](#page-12-26).
- 2. Clinical assessment, such as auscultation for breath sounds, does not always differentiate between tracheal and esophageal intubation ([27\)](#page-12-27).

There are also situations where exhaled CO<sup>2</sup> is negligible despite tracheal placement of an endotracheal tube. This occurs primarily during cardiac arrest, when there is little or no venous return to deliver CO<sup>2</sup> to the alveoli. Severe bronchospasm has also been proposed as a cause of this condition, but this has not been adequately verified ([24\)](#page-12-24).

## **Changes in Cardiac Output**

One of the most promising applications of end-tidal PCO<sup>2</sup> monitoring is the detection of acute changes in cardiac output. The correlation between changes in PETCO<sup>2</sup> and changes in cardiac output is demonstrated in [Figure](#page-10-0) 7.8 (28). This relationship suggests that PETCO<sup>2</sup> monitoring might be valuable for detecting cardiac output responses to interventions such as volume loading. In this context, the available studies have shown that changes in PETCO<sup>2</sup> are predictive of fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients (29), but not in spontaneously breathing healthy patients (30). This application deserves further attention.

**FIGURE 7.8** Relationship between changes in end tidal PCO<sup>2</sup> and changes in cardiac output in a group of postoperative patients. r = correlation coefficient. Data from Reference 28. See text for further explanation.

### *Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation*

One successful application of the relationship between PETCO<sup>2</sup> and cardiac output has been the predictive value of end-tidal CO<sup>2</sup> monitoring during cardiopulmonary resuscitation; i.e., studies indicate that return of spontaneous circulation is unlikely if the PETCO<sup>2</sup> is ≤10 mm Hg after 20 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (31). This topic is presented in detail in Chapter 21.

# **PaCO<sup>2</sup> – PETCO<sup>2</sup> Difference**

Although the PETCO<sup>2</sup> is roughly equivalent to the PaCO<sup>2</sup> in healthy subjects, the PETCO<sup>2</sup> will decrease relative to the PaCO<sup>2</sup> in any condition associated with an increase in "dead space" ventilation (i.e., when alveoli are overventilated relative to perfusion). Most causes of respiratory failure are [accompanied](#page-11-0) by an increase in physiologic dead space (see the left column in Table 7.1), and the magnitude of the

(PaCO<sup>2</sup> - PETCO<sup>2</sup> ) difference can be used to follow the clinical course of the underlying disorder ([21\)](#page-12-21). During mechanical ventilation, an increase in the (PaCO<sup>2</sup> - PETCO<sup>2</sup> ) difference can be partly due to overventilation (e.g., from excessive inflation volumes), so the PaCO<sup>2</sup> - PETCO<sup>2</sup> difference can help to identify the optimal inflation volume during mechanical ventilation.

# **A FINAL WORD**

# **Helping Fill the Void**

The fall from grace of the pulmonary artery catheter has created a void in the ability to evaluate tissue perfusion and oxygenation, but oximetry and capnography can help to fill this void in the following ways:

- 1. Monitoring the SpO<sup>2</sup> with pulse oximetry provides no information about tissue oxygenation, but the use of "dual oximetry" to monitor the (SpO–SvO<sup>2</sup> ) difference provides information about the threat of inadequate tissue oxygenation.
- 2. Monitoring the end-tidal PCO<sup>2</sup> (PETCO<sup>2</sup> ) can be useful for detecting acute changes in cardiac

output, and it is particularly valuable as a prognostic aid in cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
