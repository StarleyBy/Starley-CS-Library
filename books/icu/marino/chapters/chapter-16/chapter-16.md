# **Cardiogenic Shock**

*When is a piece of matter said to be alive? When it goes on "doing something," moving, exchanging material with its environment.*

Erwin Schrödinger (*[a](#page-13-0)*)

The human organism goes on exchanging material with its environment by virtue of a circulatory system equipped with an automatic stroke pump that averages about 100,000 stroke cycles daily, and pumps a daily volume of about 8,000 liters through a network of conducting vessels that, if placed end-to-end, would stretch more than 60,000 miles (more than twice the circumference of the Earth!) [\(1](#page-13-1)). Failure of this remarkable circulatory system begins and ends with cardiac pump failure, which can be categorized as "concerning" (conventional heart failure), "life-threatening" (cardiogenic shock), or "catastrophic" (cardiac arrest).

This chapter focuses on the challenging condition of cardiogenic shock, where management is designed to allow time for the heart to heal from a recent insult (e.g., acute myocardial infarction), or for a definitive procedure to be performed (e.g., bypass surgery). The real challenge in cardiogenic shock, however, is that half of the patients do not survive despite the best management efforts ([2\)](#page-13-2).

# **PATHOPHYSIOLOGY**

Cardiogenic shock can be described as cardiac pump failure that results in inadequate O<sup>2</sup> delivery to tissues and impaired oxidative metabolism. The culmination of this condition is multiorgan failure and a fatal outcome.

## **Etiologies**

Acute myocardial infarction is responsible for about two-thirds of the cases of cardiogenic shock ([3\)](#page-13-3), while the remaining cases can arise from a variety of cardiac disorders (see later).

# *Acute Myocardial Infarction*

Cardiogenic shock develops in 5–10% of cases of acute myocardial infarction [\(3](#page-13-3)), and the mechanisms involved are shown in [Figure](#page-1-0) 16.1. Infarction of the left ventricle is responsible for

about 80% of the cases, and requires loss of at least 40% of the functional mass of the ventricle ([2\)](#page-13-2). Infarction of the right ventricle is implicated in less than 5% of cases [\(3](#page-13-3)). There are also three infarct-related complications that can produce cardiogenic shock, as described below.

- 1. Rupture of the papillary muscles (7% of cases) results in acute and life-threatening mitral insufficiency. (*Note:* The papillary muscles attach, via the chordae tendinae, to the leaflets of the mitral valve, and contraction of these muscles prevents prolapse of the mitral valve during ventricular systole.)
- 2. Rupture of the interventricular septum (4% of cases), is accompanied by a large left-to-right shunt, which floods the pulmonary circulation and diverts flow away from the systemic circulation.
- 3. Rupture of the ventricular wall (1% of cases) is a catastrophic complication of transmural infarctions, and results in a rapidly-accumulating hemopericardium and pericardial tamponade.

These complications typically appear within 24 hours of the infarction ([2\)](#page-13-2), which is contrary to the traditional notion that they are late-onset complications.

#### *Other Conditions*

The last decade has witnessed an increase in cases of cardiogenic shock that are unrelated to acute myocardial infarction [\(3](#page-13-3)), and the major ones are listed in [Table](#page-2-0) 16.1. Acute exacerbations of chronic heart failure have been identified in as many as 30% of cases of cardiogenic shock ([2\)](#page-13-2), and stress-induced (Takotsubo's) cardiomyopathy has emerged as a potential culprit. Other notable conditions are summarized below.

**DYNAMIC OUTFLOW OBSTRUCTION:** In cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the flow of blood through the narrowed left ventricular outflow tract can create a suction effect that pulls the mitral valve leaflets anteriorly, and mid-systolic contact of the mitral valve and the interventricular septum creates a "dynamic left ventricular outflow obstruction"([4\)](#page-13-4). The diagnosis of this condition is made with continuous wave Doppler ultrasound in the apical four-chamber view, which is used to calculate the peak systolic pressure gradient across the subaortic region of the left ventricle ([5\)](#page-13-5).

Recognition of this condition is important because it is treated differently than other causes of cardiogenic shock: i.e., the goal of management in this case is to slow the heart rate and increase diastolic filling, using nonvasodilating beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol, nadolol).

**CARDIAC SURGERY:** Cardiogenic shock is reported in 2–5% of patients who undergo cardiac surgery [\(6](#page-13-6)), and this *postcardiotomy shock* can begin in the operating room or in the early postoperative period. Presumed mechanisms include myocardial hibernation or "stunning", and inadequate cardioprotection. Vasodilation may also play a role in the hypotension [\(6](#page-13-6)).

**PREGNANCY:** There is an idiopathic cardiomyopathy that can appear in the later stages of pregnancy or in the early months following delivery, and is characterized by systolic dysfunction and a variable clinical course. The incidence of this *peripartum cardiomyopathy* in the United States is 1 case per 3,000–4,000 pregnancies [\(7](#page-13-7)), and the risk factors include age >30 years, multigestational pregnancy, African heritage, and a family history of cardiomyopathy. This condition can progress to cardiogenic shock and even cardiac arrest, and it has a reported mortality rate of 7–20% in the United States [\(7](#page-13-7)).

#### *Obstructive Shock*

The category known as "obstructive shock" is essentially cardiogenic shock that is caused by conditions that are extrinsic to the heart. These conditions include acute pulmonary embolism, pericardial tamponade, and tension pneumothorax. The hemodynamic consequences are the same as those of cardiogenic shock, and the management is aimed at correcting the responsible condition.

# **Hemodynamic Changes**

The hemodynamic changes in cardiac pump failure are demonstrated in [Figure](#page-3-0) 16.2. The decrease in cardiac output is accompanied by an increase in cardiac filling pressures (either the central venous pressure or the pulmonary artery wedge pressure, depending on which ventricle has failed), and an increase in systemic vascular resistance (due to activation of both the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system). These changes occur in both heart failure and cardiogenic shock, and *cardiogenic shock is distinguished from heart failure by the presence of tissue hypoperfusion (e.g., hypotension, decreased urine output) and inadequate tissue oxygenation (e.g., elevated plasma lactate levels)*.

#### *Right Heart Failure*

<span id="page-3-0"></span>Cardiogenic shock from right ventricular (RV) failure has many similarities to shock from left ventricular (LV) failure, but it has a lower mortality rate ([8\)](#page-13-8). Some of the features that identify RV failure include an increase in the CVP/PAWP ratio, a dilated RV, and a normal LV ejection fraction. Severe RV dilation can push the interventricular septum into the chamber of the left ventricle, which reduces LV filling and further impairs cardiac stroke output. (The diagnosis and management of RV failure is presented in Chapter 18.)

**FIGURE 16.2** Graph showing the hemodynamic changes in cardiac pump failure.

#### *Exceptions*

The cardiac index (CI) in cardiogenic shock is typically <2.2 L/min/m2 (normal CI = 2.4–4.0 L/min/m2) [\(9](#page-13-9)), but the cardiac filling pressures are not increased in as many as 30% of patients with infarct-related cardiogenic shock [\(2](#page-13-2)). In addition, the systemic vascular resistance may not be elevated when cardiogenic shock is accompanied by systemic inflammation (see later). Finally, hypotension is absent in about 5% of cases of cardiogenic shock [\(2](#page-13-2)).

#### *The Microcirculation*

Studies using sublingual videomicroscopy have shown that cardiogenic shock is associated with a decrease in capillary perfusion that is independent of the changes in global hemodynamic measures (i.e., cardiac output and blood pressure), and it has a greater impact on mortality than the "macrocirculatory" changes [\(10](#page-13-10)). This *microcirculatory dysfunction might explain why correcting the cardiac output and blood pressure in cardiogenic shock does not ensure survival* ([10,](#page-13-10)[11\)](#page-13-11). Monitoring microcirculatory perfusion with the PCO<sup>2</sup> gap is potentially useful in this regard (see later).

# **Systemic Inflammation**

Myocardial necrosis triggers a localized inflammatory response [\(12](#page-13-12)), which can progress to a systemic inflammatory response. Signs of systemic inflammation (e.g., fever, leukocytosis, etc.) have been reported in 20–40% of patients with cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction, and these patients have a lower SVR (due to the vasodilating effects of nitric oxide) and a higher mortality rate ([13\)](#page-13-13). This *systemic inflammation has been linked to the microcirculatory dysfunction in cardiogenic shock* ([13\)](#page-13-13).

# **MANAGEMENT**

Since most cases of cardiogenic shock are associated with acute myocardial infarction, the management of cardiogenic shock often includes measures aimed at coronary revascularization (i.e., coronary angioplasty, bypass surgery, antithrombotic therapy). These measures are described in Chapter 20; the focus here is on measures that promote tissue perfusion.

# **Monitoring**

The management of cardiogenic shock requires a reliable measure of the cardiac output, and the most reliable measurement available is the thermodilution cardiac output provided by pulmonary artery (PA) catheters (see Chapter 8). These catheters also provide measurements of the cardiac filling pressures (the central venous and wedge pressures), the systemic vascular resistance, and the oxygen transport variables (see Table 8.1), which makes them ideal for the management of cardiogenic shock. In fact, the use of PA catheters has been shown to improve outcomes in cardiogenic shock ([14\)](#page-13-14), and the most recent guidelines from the American Heart Association emphasizes the value of PA catheters in the management of cardiogenic shock [\(15](#page-13-15)).

# *Tissue Perfusion & Oxygenation*

As mentioned earlier, cardiogenic shock can be accompanied by deficits in microcirculatory flow that are independent of the changes in cardiac output, and can persist after the cardiac output and blood pressure are normalized. This highlights the value of monitoring tissue perfusion with the PCO<sup>2</sup> gap (described in Chapter 14), and with clinical signs of organ perfusion (e.g., urine output).

Tissue oxygenation is probably the most important parameter to monitor in cardiogenic shock, since shock is defined as an abnormality in cellular oxygen utilization (see Chapter 14). Although it is not possible to directly monitor tissue O<sup>2</sup> levels, the mixed venous O<sup>2</sup> saturation

(SvO<sup>2</sup> ) can provide information about the balance between O<sup>2</sup> delivery and O<sup>2</sup> consumption, and plasma lactate levels provide an indirect assessment of the adequacy of tissue oxygenation. (These measures are described in Chapter 9.)

#### *Goals of Management*

The goals of hemodynamic management in cardiogenic shock are summarized in [Table](#page-5-0) 16.2. Some of these goals are based on the normal range of values for the variable, and some are based on the lowest or highest tolerable levels. An example of the latter instance is presented next.

### **Optimizing Filling Pressures**

As mentioned earlier, the left ventricular filling pressure (i.e., the pulmonary artery wedge pressure) is not always elevated in cardiogenic shock [\(2](#page-13-2)), and when this occurs, volume infusion can be instrumental in augmenting the cardiac output. The target of volume infusion is the highest filling (wedge) pressure that will augment cardiac output without producing pulmonary edema, and this "optimal" pressure is dependent on the colloid osmotic pressure (COP) of plasma. The plasma COP is normally about 28 mm Hg (16), but a lower COP of 20–25 mm Hg seems more reasonable in critically ill patients, who often have a subnormal plasma albumin concentration (the major determinant of plasma COP). Thus, *the optimal left ventricular filling pressure (i.e., wedge pressure) is considered to be 18–20 mm Hg* (17).

<sup>§</sup>Wood Units = mm Hg/L/min/m2.

# **Vasopressor Therapy**

Hypotension is almost universal in cardiogenic shock, and vasoconstrictor agents (vasopressors) are used to raise the blood pressure to a systolic BP ≥90 mm Hg or a mean BP ≥65 mm Hg. The vasopressors available for clinical use are described in Chapter 14. *The vasopressor of choice in cardiogenic shock is norepinephrine* ([15,](#page-13-15)18,19), a catecholamine that produces systemic vasoconstriction and mild cardiac stimulation. One exception to the norepinephrine preference is cardiogenic shock from dynamic LV outflow obstruction, where a pure vasoconstrictor like phenylephrine (which can trigger a reflex bradycardia) is more appropriate ([15\)](#page-13-15).

#### *Norepinephrine*

The preference for norepinephrine in cardiogenic shock comes from studies comparing norepinephrine with other popular vasopressors (epinephrine and dopamine), which showed that norepinephrine had a lower risk of tachycardia and troublesome arrhythmias, and was associated with fewer deaths (18,20,21). The mild cardiac stimulation produced by norepinephrine tends to preserve cardiac output in the face of vasoconstriction, at least in the lower dose range.

**DOSING:** Norepinephrine is given by continuous infusion (without a loading dose) starting at a rate of 5 μg/min (or 0.05 μg/kg/min), and titrating upward every 5 minutes to achieve the desired blood pressure. The usual dose rate in studies of cardiogenic shock is 5–30 μg/min (or 0.05–0.5 μg/kg/min) (20).

# **Inotropic Therapy**

Vasopressor therapy does not alleviate the cardiac pump failure, and can aggravate it. As a result, drugs that increase cardiac contractile force (inotropic agents) are typically added to vasopressor therapy. There are only a few inotropic agents used in this setting, and these are included in [Table](#page-6-0) 16.3, along with their dosing regimens. Inotropic therapy is contraindicated in cardiogenic shock from dynamic LV outflow obstruction.

#### *Dobutamine*

*The most widely used inotropic agent in cardiogenic shock is dobutamine* (18,22), a synthetic catecholamine that stimulates β<sup>1</sup> receptors in the heart, and increases both cardiac stroke output and heart rate. Dobutamine also has mild vasodilator effects, but it does not decrease the blood pressure because the vasodilator effect is offset by the increase in cardiac stroke output. This ability to preserve (and sometimes augment) the blood pressure is the principal advantage of dobutamine over other inotropic agents in cardiogenic shock.

The major disadvantages of dobutamine include an increase in heart rate (which is usually 5– 15 beats/min, but can exceed 30 beats/min), and an increase in myocardial O<sup>2</sup> consumption (23). These changes are associated with an increase in cardiac work, which is deleterious in the setting of acute myocardial infarction, and also in the failing myocardium (where cardiac work is already increased).

<sup>§</sup>Dosing adjustments are manufacturers recommendation (24).

#### *Milrinone*

Milrinone is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that acts as an inotrope by virtue of inhibiting the breakdown of cyclic AMP, which enhances cyclic AMP-mediated calcium influx into cardiac myocytes. It also acts as a vasodilator, which further promotes cardiac stroke output. However, the vasodilator actions of milrinone can produce troublesome hypotension (23), which is a major drawback in cardiogenic shock. The elimination half-life of milrinone (2.5 hrs) is significantly prolonged in patients with renal insufficiency, and a dosing adjustment is recommended when the creatinine clearance is <50 mL/min/1.73 m2 (24), as shown in [Table](#page-6-0) 16.3.

The inotropic effects of milrinone are comparable to those of dobutamine, but there is less risk of troublesome tachycardia (23). Despite this lower risk of tachycardia, milrinone has a significant risk of hypotension, and this limits its popularity as an inotrope in cardiogenic shock. Milrinone is more appropriate for the management of decompensated heart failure without hypotension.

#### *Levosimendan*

Levosimendan increases cardiac contractility by sensitizing cardiac myofilaments to calcium, and also promotes vasodilation by facilitating potassium influx into vascular smooth muscle (25). This drug is particularly appealing in infarct-related cardiogenic shock because it dilates coronary arteries and does not stimulate myocardial O<sup>2</sup> consumption. This might explain why studies comparing dobutamine and levosimendan show a mortality benefit with levosimendan (26). However, there is a risk of hypotension with levosimendan, which is a disadvantage. Levosimenden has a long half-life (80 hrs), and infusions are usually limited to 24 hours.

Levosimendan has been a popular inotrope in Europe and South America since it was introduced in 2000 (25), but it is not approved for use in the United States.

#### **Cardiac Workload**

The pharmacological management of cardiogenic shock has the unfortunate consequence of increasing the workload of the heart (e.g., vasopressors will increase left ventricular afterload, and inotropes will increase contractility, and can increase heart rate). The increase in cardiac work is counterproductive in the failing myocardium, and seems unlikely to facilitate any improvements in "native" cardiac function. On the other hand, mechanical support devices (described next) are designed to reduce cardiac work, and thus it is important to *avoid delays in proceeding to mechanical cardiac support if there is no evidence of rapid improvement during pharmacological support* ([15\)](#page-13-15).

# **MECHANICAL CARDIAC SUPPORT**

Mechanical cardiac support (MCS) is generally reserved for cases of refractory cardiogenic shock where improvement in cardiac function is an expectation (usually after myocardial infarction or cardiac surgery), or another intervention is planned (e.g., coronary bypass surgery) (27).

# **Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump**

The intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) is the oldest form of MCS (introduced in the 1960s), and continues to be used despite evidence that it does not improve survival (28). However, *studies comparing the IABP with other forms of MCS have shown no improvement in survival with any of the methods* ([15\)](#page-13-15). (This seems to be a testament to the whole MCS approach to cardiogenic shock, however there are individual patients who benefit from MCS, and it is often difficult to predict who will benefit prior to the intervention.) The IABP is the most readily available form of MCS in hospitals other than large, tertiary medical centers, but it is only a temporary measure. It is contraindicated in patients with aortic valve insufficiency or aortic dissection.

#### *The Method*

The intra-aortic balloon is an elongated polyurethane balloon that is inserted percutaneously into the femoral artery and advanced up the aorta until the tip lies just below the origin of the left subclavian artery (see [Figure](#page-9-0) 16.3). A pump attached to the balloon uses helium, a low density gas, to rapidly inflate and deflate the balloon (inflation volume is generally 35 to 40 mL). Inflation begins at the onset of diastole, just after the aortic valve closes (the R wave on the ECG is a common trigger). The balloon is then deflated at the onset of ventricular systole, just before the aortic valve opens (during isovolumic contraction). This pattern of balloon inflation and deflation produces two changes in the aortic pressure [waveform,](#page-9-0) which are illustrated in Figure 16.3.

- 1. Inflation of the balloon during diastole increases the peak diastolic pressure, which augments coronary blood flow (which occurs predominantly during diastole), and also increases the mean arterial pressure (equivalent to the integrated pressure under the aortic pressure waveform), which augments systemic blood flow.
- 2. Deflation of the balloon creates a suction effect that reduces pressure in the aorta when the aortic valve opens, and this decreases left ventricular afterload and augments ventricular stroke output.

<span id="page-9-0"></span>![](_page_9_Figure_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 16.3** Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, showing balloon inflation in early diastole (on the left), and balloon deflation in late diastole (on the right). The associated changes in the aortic pressure (indicated by the dotted lines) are shown above each maneuver. The arrows show the direction of enhanced flow.

The IABP thus reduces cardiac work by unloading the left ventricle while also increasing coronary blood flow and systemic flow.

#### *Complications*

The principal concern with IABP is limb ischemia, which can appear while the balloon is in place or shortly after balloon removal., Most cases are the result of in-situ thrombosis at the catheter insertion site, but aortoiliac injury may also be responsible. Loss of distal pulses alone does not warrant removal of the balloon as long as sensorimotor function in the legs is intact (29). Loss of sensorimotor function in the legs should always prompt immediate removal of the device, and surgical intervention may be required.

Other complications of IABP include septicemia, balloon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, and pseudoaneurysm. Fever is reported in 50% of patients during IABP support, but bacteremia is reported in only 15% of patients (30).

### **Impella Catheters**

Impella® catheters (ABIOMED, Inc., Danvers, MA) provide flow assistance for ventricular output. These catheters are primarily used as left-ventricular assist devices (LVADs), but there is also a catheter designed to assist the right ventricle (an RVAD).

An example of an Impella catheter shown in [Figure](#page-10-0) 16.4. The catheter is equipped with a miniature centrifugal pump (i.e., the type of pump that uses rotational "propeller" blades to create non-pulsatile flow), and it is inserted percutaneously into a femoral artery and advanced into the left ventricle. (The pigtail at the tip of the catheter allows the catheter to be advanced safely.) The pump moves blood from the left ventricle to the proximal aorta at flow rates of 2.5– 5.5 L/min (flow rates differ with different catheters). The device shown in [Figure](#page-10-0) 16.4 monitors the native cardiac output, and automatically adjusts the pump flow to achieve a (pre-selected) total cardiac output (31).

**FIGURE 16.4** An Impella catheter, which is equipped with a miniature centrifugal pump. The tip of the catheter is placed in the left ventricle so that the pump's rotational propellers are positioned across the aortic valve. The pump then transfers blood from the ventricle to the proximal aorta (see directional arrows) to unload the ventricle. See text for further explanation.

The hemodynamic effects of Impella catheters are similar to the IABP; i.e., they unload the left ventricle and increase cardiac output, while also increasing coronary blood flow (32). This similarity also extends to survival value, since Impella catheters have not shown a survival advantage over IABP in patients with infarct-related cardiogenic shock (28,33). Impella catheters have more of an advantage in patients with end-stage left ventricular failure, since they can be implanted for long-term use. These catheters are contraindicated in patients with aortic valve disease or a prosthetic aortic valve, and in patients with an LV thrombus.

#### *Complications*

The complications of the Impella catheter are similar in type to the IABP, but there is evidence that major bleeding and limb ischemia are more common with Impella catheters (33,34). The incidence of significant hemolysis (5–10%) is also greater with Impella catheters than with other forms of mechanical support (35).

#### **ECMO**

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is designed to support both circulatory flow and pulmonary gas exchange. Veno-arterial ECMO (VA-ECMO) is used for cardiogenic shock, and is gaining in popularity for the management of refractory cardiogenic shock associated with acute myocardial infarction and cardiac surgery. VA-ECMO offers some advantages, including the ability to provide full biventricular support (matched only by combining RV and LV Impella catheters), and the ability to support oxygenation and CO<sup>2</sup> removal, which is advantageous in patients with respiratory failure (a common complication of cardiogenic shock). *VA-ECMO is the preferred method of mechanical support in cases of cardiogenic shock associated with respiratory failure* (36).

The basic elements of a VA-ECMO circuit are shown in [Figure](#page-12-0) 16.5. Vascular access can be achieved by percutaneous cannulation of the femoral artery and vein. The femoral vein catheter is advanced along the inferior vena cava until the tip is situated close to the right atrium. Blood from the femoral vein catheter is passed through a centrifugal pump (which generates the desired pressures and flow rates) and then flows through a membrane oxygenator before being warmed to 37° C and returned via the femoral artery catheter. Retrograde flow up the aorta is intended to reach the aortic arch so it can enhance cerebral blood flow. Flow rates vary according to each patients native cardiac output, but they can reach 5–6 L/min to provide full circulatory support. As in the other forms of mechanical support, full anticoagulation is necessary.

#### *Complications*

The complications of VA-ECMO are varied and considerable. Reported complications and their frequency of appearance are as follows (36): major bleeding (41%), sepsis (30%), limb ischemia (17%), lower extremity compartment syndrome (10%), stroke (6%), and lower limb amputation (5%).

**LV AFTERLOAD:** VA-ECMO has one problem that is not shared by the other forms of mechanical support: i.e., the retrograde flow in the aorta increases left ventricular (LV) afterload, and this can be severe enough to reduce LV output and cause acute pulmonary edema (36). Efforts to tackle this problem have included combining IABP or Impella catheters with VA-ECMO to

reduce LV afterload, and draining blood from the left ventricle to reduce end-diastolic pressure (known as "venting") (37).

#### *Outcomes*

The largest registry of ECMO patients has reported a 42% survival rate to hospital discharge when VA-ECMO is used for cardiogenic shock (38). A comparison of survival rates with VA-ECMO versus other forms of mechanical support (IABP or LVAD) has had inconsistent results; i.e., survival rates have been better with VA-ECMO in some reports (39) and better with the Impella catheter in other reports (40).

#### **Device Selection**

The choice of mechanical support device will largely be determined by availability and individual preferences at your hospital. VA-ECMO is the method of choice for cardiogenic shock associated with respiratory failure, and there is a trend in favor of VA-ECMO for all mechanical support. However, ECMO is not available in many hospitals, and mechanical support with IABP or an LVAD may be the only options (patients can then be transferred for ECMO if there is no improvement). Impella catheters are preferred to IABP in many hospitals, even though the outcomes appear to be the same with both devices.

# **A FINAL WORD**

The following information in this chapter deserves emphasis.

1. The management of cardiogenic shock is aimed at "buying time" until either the heart begins to heal from an acute insult (e.g., an acute coronary event), or another intervention is

performed (e.g., bypass surgery).

- 2. Pharmacological support is an immediate need for maintaining tissue perfusion, but this approach increases the workload of the heart, and is counterproductive. For this reason, proceeding to mechanical cardiac support should be a priority if there is no evidence of improvement with pharmacological support.
- 3. Mechanical support devices can "unload" the ventricle (intra-aortic balloon pump), provide flow assistance for ventricular output (Impella catheters), or provide support for gas exchange and circulatory blood flow (VA-ECMO).
- 4. VA-ECMO is the support method of choice if cardiogenic shock is accompanied by respiratory failure. Otherwise, there is no consistent evidence showing that one method is superior to the others for a satisfactory outcome.
- 5. Avoiding delays to initiation of mechanical support will optimize outcomes. Mechanical support that is initiated after the onset of multiorgan failure has been described as a "bridge to nowhere" (36).
