# **Anemia and Red Blood Cell Transfusions**

*A conscientious man would be cautious how he dealt in blood.*

Edmund Burke (*[a](#page-16-0)*)

As many as 50% of ICU patients are transfused with red blood cells [\(1](#page-16-1)), and in a large majority (90%) of cases, these transfusions are used to boost the hemoglobin level in nonbleeding patients ([2\)](#page-16-2). The practice of transfusing red blood cells (RBCs) based on the hemoglobin level creates a question about the correlation between the hemoglobin level in blood and the adequacy of tissue oxygenation (since the goal of RBC transfusions should be to promote tissue oxygenation). This is a relevant issue because there are considerable risks associated with RBC transfusions, and there is a concern that these risks may outweigh the risks of the anemia they are meant to correct ([3\)](#page-16-3).

This chapter focuses on the influence of anemia and RBC transfusions on tissue oxygenation. It begins by describing the causes and consequences of anemia in the critically ill, and then presents the indications, physiological effects, and adverse consequences associated with RBC transfusions. Current practices that lack a rational or scientific basis are highlighted, to address the need for a more judicious use of RBC transfusions.

### **ANEMIA IN THE ICU**

Anemia is almost universal in the ICU; i.e., it is present on admission in two-thirds of the patients, and the prevalence increases to 97% after one week in the ICU [\(4](#page-16-4)). However, the standard definition of anemia can be problematic in ICU patients, as explained next.

### **Definition of Anemia**

Anemia is defined as a *decrease in the oxygen carrying capacity of blood*. The most accurate measure of the O<sup>2</sup> carrying capacity of blood is the *red cell mass*, which is the volume of circulating red blood cells, and is measured using chromium-tagged erythrocytes. This measurement is not typically used in clinical settings; instead, the hematocrit (Hct) and

hemoglobin concentration are used as clinical measures of O<sup>2</sup> carrying capacity. (Reference ranges for these red cell parameters are shown in [Table](#page-1-0) 12.1) *The clinical definition of anemia is a hemoglobin (Hb) concentration <13 g/dL (Hct <40%) in males, and <12 g/dL (Hct <38%) in females* ([4\)](#page-16-4). Since this definition is based on a concentration, it will be influenced by the plasma volume.

#### *Influence of Plasma Volume*

The confounding influence of the plasma volume on a clinical measure of O<sup>2</sup> carrying capacity (Hct) is demonstrated in [Figure](#page-2-0) 12.1. The panel on the left shows the postural changes in Hct in a group of healthy adults [\(5](#page-16-5)). Note that there is a 4.1% absolute decrease in Hct in the supine position. This is the result of a decrease in the hydrostatic pressure within the capillaries in the legs (due to loss of the gravitational effect), which promotes the movement of interstitial fluid into the bloodstream and increases the plasma volume (by 420 mL in this study). The panel on the right shows the effect of a bolus infusion of isotonic saline (20 mL/kg), which causes a similar (4.2%) decrease in Hct [\(6](#page-16-6)). In both cases, the decrease in Hct is equivalent to the change produced by the loss of one unit of red blood cells.

<span id="page-2-0"></span>![](_page_2_Figure_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 12.1** The influence of plasma volume on the hematocrit (Hct). The panel on the left shows the postural decrease in Hct in the supine position, which is explained in the text. The panel on the right shows the decrease in Hct 90 minutes after a bolus infusion of isotonic saline at 20 mL/kg. In both cases, the absolute decrease in Hct is equivalent to the change produced by loss of one unit of blood (500 mL). From References 6 and 7.

An increased plasma volume is common in critically ill patients, as emphasized in Chapter 11 (see Figure 11.3), and this means that *the Hct and Hb concentration will overestimate the prevalence and severity of anemia in ICU patients*. Clinical studies have confirmed that the Hct and Hb concentration are unreliable measures of anemia in critically ill patients ([7,](#page-16-7)[8\)](#page-16-8). Unfortunately, these are the measures used in all the clinical studies evaluating anemia and erythrocyte transfusions in critically ill patients.

### **ICU-Related Anemia**

Two conditions can add to the prevalence and severity of anemia during the ICU stay: systemic inflammation, and repeated phlebotomy for laboratory studies.

#### *Inflammation*

Systemic inflammation is accompanied by iron sequestration in tissue macrophages, which is attributed to the actions of cytokines, and also to the hepatic release of *hepcidin* ([9\)](#page-16-9), a small peptide that reduces plasma iron levels by promoting iron sequestration in tissue macrophages ([9\)](#page-16-9). The sequestered iron cannot be transferred to developing red blood cells, and this results in a hypochromic microcytic anemia that resembles iron-deficiency anemia. (This is the same mechanism for the "anemia of chronic disease"). The plasma iron profile in the *anemia of*

*inflammation* includes a decrease in plasma iron, total iron binding capacity, and transferrin levels, which can be indistinguishable from iron deficiency, but there is an increase in plasma ferritin levels.

**PLASMA FERRITIN:** The ferritin level in plasma is used to evaluate tissue iron stores, and thus can distinguish between iron deficiency anemia (plasma ferritin <30 μg/L) and the anemia of inflammation (plasma ferritin >100 μg/L) ([9\)](#page-16-9).

#### *Phlebotomy*

An average of 40–70 mL of blood is withdrawn daily in ICU patients to perform laboratory tests ([4,](#page-16-4)[10\)](#page-16-10), and the cumulative blood loss can reach 500 mL (one unit of whole blood) after one week.

The daily phlebotomy volume can be reduced by reinfusing the initial sample on a blood draw; i.e., when blood is withdrawn through vascular catheters for laboratory testing, the initial aspirate is discarded to eliminate interference from intravenous fluid in the lumen of the catheter. The volume of discarded blood is typically about 5 mL for each laboratory blood draw, and returning this blood to the patient can reduce the daily phlebotomy volume by 50% (11).

### **The Physiology of Anemia**

Anemia elicits two responses that help to preserve tissue oxygenation: [\(1](#page-16-1)) an increase in cardiac output (the result of a decrease in blood viscosity), and ([2\)](#page-16-2) an increase in O<sup>2</sup> extraction from capillary blood.

### *Blood Viscosity*

Viscosity is defined as the resistance of a fluid to changes in flow rate (12), and has also been described as the "gooiness" of a fluid (13). The viscosity of blood is the result of cross-linking of erythrocytes by plasma fibrinogen, and the principal determinant of whole blood viscosity is the concentration of erythrocytes (the hematocrit). The influence of hematocrit on blood viscosity is shown in [Table](#page-3-0) 12.2. Note that blood viscosity can be expressed in absolute or relative terms (relative to water). The viscosity of plasma (zero hematocrit) is only slightly higher than that of water, while the viscosity of whole blood at a normal hematocrit (45%) is about 3 times greater than plasma and about 4 times greater than water. Thus, anemic blood flows much more readily than normal blood.

**RESISTANCE TO FLOW:** The influence of blood viscosity on peripheral blood flow can be described with the Hagen-Poiseuille equation shown below (14), which is also used in Chapter 1 to describe flow through vascular catheters.

$$Q = \Delta P \times (\pi r^4 / 8\mu L) \tag{12.1}$$

This equation states that flow (Q) through a blood vessel is directly related to the pressure gradient along the vessel (∆P) and the fourth power of the radius (r) of the vessel, and is inversely related to the length (L) of the vessel and the viscosity (µ) of the fluid. The final term in the equation is the reciprocal of resistance (1/R), so resistance to flow can be described as:

$$R = 8\mu L / \pi r^4$$
 (12.2)

This equation indicates that flow resistance in the peripheral circulation is directly related to blood viscosity.

#### *Cardiac Output*

The effects of anemia on blood viscosity are responsible for the increase in cardiac output shown in [Figure](#page-5-0) 12.2 (15). Note that the increase in cardiac output is proportionally greater than the decrease in hematocrit. This is because blood is a *non-Newtonian fluid,* which means that viscosity is influenced by blood flow; i.e., an increase in blood flow will reduce viscosity. (In a teleological sense, this property would be advantageous in helping to reduce blood loss through a punctured blood vessel; i.e., blood loss through a puncture would lead to a decrease in local blood flow, which would then "thicken" the blood and reduce the tendency for further blood loss.) The increase in cardiac output helps to maintain systemic O<sup>2</sup> transport in the face of a declining hematocrit.

**FIGURE 12.2** The influence of progressive isovolemic hemodilution on cardiac output in a patient with polycythemia. From Reference 15.

#### Systemic Oxygenation

The influence of progressive anemia on measures of systemic oxygenation are shown in Figure 12.3 (16). The principal findings are explained using the following relationships between  $O_2$  uptake ( $VO_2$ ),  $O_2$  delivery ( $DO_2$ ), and  $O_2$  extraction:

<span id="page-5-1"></span>
$$VO_2 = DO_2 \times O_2$$
 Extraction (12.3)

The upper panel in Figure 12.3 shows that, despite the increase in cardiac output in anemia, the decrease in hemoglobin results in an overall decrease in systemic  $O_2$  delivery. However, there is a compensatory increase in  $O_2$  extraction, and this maintains a constant  $O_2$  uptake (shown in the lower panel). However, when the hematocrit falls below 10%, the increase in  $O_2$  extraction is no longer able to fully compensate for the decrease in  $O_2$  delivery, and the  $O_2$  uptake then begins to fall. When this occurs, the lactate level begins to rise, indicating inadequate tissue oxygenation. Note that the maximum  $O_2$  extraction is about 50 %, and this marks the threshold for impaired tissue oxygenation.

There are two features in Figure 12.3 that deserve emphasis:

- . Anemia did not impair tissue oxygenation until the hematocrit fell to 10% (equivalent to a Hb concentration of 3 g/dL), indicating that even the most severe anemias are tolerated (thanks to the compensatory increase in  $O_2$  extraction).
- . An  $O_2$  extraction that has increased to 50% marks the point where tissue oxygenation is threatened, and this point could serve as an indication for RBC transfusions. (More on this a little later).

TOLERANCE TO SEVERE ANEMIA: Animal studies have shown that, when the intravascular volume

is maintained, hematocrits as low as 5 to 10% (Hb = 1.5 to 3 g/dL) do not adversely affect tissue oxygenation (16–18), even in awake animals breathing room air (18). Human studies of the lowest tolerable hematocrit or hemoglobin mostly involve Jehovah's Witness (JW) patients. In a large study that included 300 postoperative JW patients, 50% of the patients survived with a Hb level of 2–3 g/dL, and 75% of the patients survived with a Hb level of 3–4 g/dL (19). Another study of progressive hemodilution in healthy adults showed that Hb levels of 5 g/dL produced no apparent harm (20). Thus, the available studies suggest that Hb levels down to 5.0 are safe, and individual patients can tolerate Hb levels as low as 2–3 g/dL!

# **THE TRANSFUSION TRIGGER**

In 1942, a hemoglobin (Hb) level of ≤10 g/dL was recommended as an indication for RBC transfusions (21), and this was the standard *transfusion trigger* for the next 60 years, until concern about the risks associated with RBC transfusions prompted studies which showed that outcomes were not adversely affected if Hb levels were allowed to decrease to 7 g/dL (22,23). A

recent review of 48 clinical studies confirmed that outcomes were similar (including cardiac events) when Hb levels were maintained at 7–8 g/dL instead of 9–10 g/dL, and that the lower Hb threshold for transfusion resulted in a 41% reduction in the consumption of RBC products (24).

### **Guidelines**

There are 21 clinical practice guidelines for RBC transfusions in critically ill patients who are not actively bleeding (for the recommendations of each, see Ref. 25), and the majority of the recommendations state the following:

- 1. The threshold for RBC transfusions is a Hb <7 g/dL for critically ill patients who are hemodynamically stable, and do not have coronary artery disease. This includes post-cardiac surgery patients and patients with septic shock.
- 2. The transfusion threshold should be a Hb <8 g/dL for patients with coronary artery disease, and for patients undergoing cardiac surgery or orthopedic surgery.

Compliance with these guidelines has been poor; e.g., one survey of close to 5,000 RBC transfusions revealed that 60% of transfusions did not follow the recommendations of the guidelines (26).

### **What's Wrong?**

There are two problems with the use of the Hb concentration as a transfusion trigger:

- 1. The Hb concentration provides no information about the adequacy of tissue oxygenation, and since the goal of RBC transfusions is to promote tissue oxygenation, transfusions based on the Hb concentration are given without evidence of need or benefit.
- 2. Acute decreases in the Hb concentration can be a dilutional effect, and this can result in inappropriate RBC transfusions.

Some clinical practice guidelines have recommended abandoning the Hb level as a transfusion trigger and adopting more physiologic measures of tissue oxygenation (27), like the ones described next (27).

### *Oxygen Extraction*

As described earlier (and shown in [Figure](#page-6-0) 12.3) anemia elicits a compensatory increase in O<sup>2</sup> extraction, which helps to maintain a constant rate of O<sup>2</sup> uptake into tissues. However, the O<sup>2</sup> extraction reaches a maximum of about 50%, and beyond this point, further decreases in Hb will result in a decrease in O<sup>2</sup> uptake, which is a marker of impaired tissue oxygenation. Therefore, a*n O<sup>2</sup> extraction of 50% can be used as a transfusion trigger* because it identifies the threshold for impaired tissue oxygenation (28). The O<sup>2</sup> extraction is roughly equivalent to the difference between the arterial and central venous O<sup>2</sup> saturation, (SaO2–ScvO<sup>2</sup> ), and this can be monitored continuously using pulse oximetry (for the SaO<sup>2</sup> ) and a central venous "oximetry" catheter (for the ScvO<sup>2</sup> ).

When the SaO<sup>2</sup> is close to 100%, the ScvO<sup>2</sup> can be used alone as a transfusion trigger; e.g., an ScvO<sup>2</sup> <70% has been proposed as a transfusion trigger (29).

Unfortunately, despite the physiological advantages of these approaches, they have received little attention.

### **RED BLOOD CELL TRANSFUSIONS**

Whole blood is stored only on request, and is otherwise separated into its component parts; i.e., red blood cells (RBCs), platelets, plasma, and cryoprecipitate. This practice allows each unit of donated blood to serve multiple transfusion needs.

### **Preparations**

The RBC preparations that are available for transfusion are shown in [Table](#page-8-0) 12.3.

From Reference 30.

#### *Packed RBCs*

The erythrocyte fraction of donated blood is placed in a preservative fluid and stored at 1 to 6° C. Newer preservative solutions contain adenine, which helps to maintain ATP levels in stored erythrocytes, and allows storage of donor erythrocytes for up to 42 days (30). Each unit of concentrated erythrocytes, known as *packed red blood cells* (packed RBCs), has a hematocrit of about 60% and a volume of about 350 mL, which includes about 30 – 50 mL of residual plasma, and a considerable number of leukocytes (30).

#### *Leukocyte-Reduced RBCs*

The leukocytes in packed RBCs can trigger an antibody response in the recipient after repeated transfusions, and this is responsible for febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions (see later). To reduce the risk of this reaction, donor RBCs are passed through specialized filters to remove most of the leukocytes. This is performed routinely in many blood banks, but universal leukocyte reduction has yet to be adopted in the United States. Leukocyte-reduced RBCs are recommended for patients with prior febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions (30).

#### Washed RBCs

Donor RBCs can be washed with isotonic saline to remove residual plasma. This reduces the risk of hypersensitivity reactions caused by prior sensitization to plasma proteins in donor blood. Washed RBC preparations are recommended for patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to blood transfusions, and for patients with immunoglobulin A deficiency, who have an increased risk of transfusion-related anaphylaxis (30). Saline washing does not effectively remove leukocytes.

### **Infusing Packed RBCs**

Packed RBCs (PRBCs) have a high viscosity (due to the Hct of 60%) and thus have a sluggish flow rate. As a result, saline is often added to PRBC transfusions to increase the flow rate and reduce infusion time. The data in Table 12.4 shows the infusion time for one unit of PRBCs through 18- and 20-gauge peripheral catheters, and the influence of dilution with 100 mL isotonic saline (31). Note that the infusion time is almost 2 hrs when the undiluted RBCs are infused through a 20-gauge catheter, and the infusion time is reduced to almost one hour with an 18-gauge catheter. Also note that the RBCs infuse six times faster when diluted with saline. The recommended infusion time is typically 2 hrs per unit of packed RBCs for hemodynamically stable patients (30), so the saline dilution is probably not necessary when PRBCs are infused to correct anemia.

#### **Blood Filters**

Standard blood filters (pore size 170 to 260 microns) are required for the transfusion of all blood products (30). These filters trap blood clots and other debris, but they do not trap leukocytes, and are not effective for leukocyte reduction (30). These filters can become an impediment to flow as they collect trapped debris, and sluggish infusion rates are an indication to replace filters.

### **Effects on Systemic Oxygenation**

In an average-sized adult, one unit of packed RBCs is expected to raise the hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit by 1 g/dL and 3%, respectively (30). The effects of RBC transfusions on measures of systemic oxygenation are shown in Figure 12.4 The data in this figure is from a group of postoperative patients with severe normovolemic anemia (Hb <7 g/dL) who were transfused with 1-2 units of packed RBCs to raise the Hb above 7 g/dL. The RBC transfusions increased the mean Hb concentration from 6.4 to 8 g/dL (25% increase), and there was a similar increase in  $O_2$  delivery (DO<sub>2</sub>). However, the systemic  $O_2$  uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>) was

unchanged. The constant  $VO_2$  in the face of an increased  $DO_2$  indicates that  $O_2$  extraction was reduced by the RBC transfusions, as predicted by Equation 12.3. These changes in  $DO_2$  and  $O_2$  extraction are the reverse of the changes produced by anemia, as shown in Figure 12.3.

#### No Improvement in Tissue Oxygenation

The lack of an effect on  $VO_2$  in Figure 12.4 indicates that *RBC transfusions do not enhance tissue oxygenation*. This has been confirmed in several clinical studies (32–35), and prolonged storage of RBCs can actually *impair* tissue oxygenation after transfusion (36). These studies have prompted the following statement in a clinical practice guideline for red blood cell transfusions (27):

"RBC transfusion should not be considered an absolute method to improve tissue oxygenation in critically ill patients."

**FIGURE 12.4** Effect of RBC transfusions (1–2 units packed RBCs) to correct severe anemia (Hb < 7g/dL) on systemic oxygen delivery (DO $_2$ ), and oxygen uptake (VO $_2$ ) in 11 postoperative patients. Data points represent mean values for each parameter. Numbers in parentheses indicate the mean hemoglobin concentrations before and after transfusion. Data from personal observations.

**COMMENT:** The inability of RBC transfusions to enhance tissue oxygenation raises serious questions about the practice of transfusing RBCs simply to boost the Hb level. This concern is especially relevant in light of the multiple risks associated with RBC transfusions, which are described in the next section.

### **TRANSFUSION RISKS**

The spectrum of adverse events associated with RBC transfusions is shown in Table 12.5, along

with the risk of each event per unit of RBCs transfused (37–42). Note that transfusion errors are much more frequent than the feared transmission of infectious agents. The following is a brief description of the principal transfusion reactions.

### **Acute Hemolytic Reactions**

Acute hemolytic reactions are prompted by the transfusion of RBCs that are ABO-incompatible with the recipient. When this occurs, antibodies in recipient blood bind to ABO antigens on the donor RBCs, and the ensuing lysis of donor RBCs triggers a systemic inflammatory response that can be accompanied by hypotension and multiorgan failure. *These reactions are usually the result of human error* (43).

#### *Clinical Features*

The hallmark of acute hemolytic reactions is the abrupt onset of fever, dyspnea, chest pain, low back pain, and hypotension within minutes after starting the transfusion. Severe reactions are accompanied by a consumptive coagulopathy and progressive multiorgan dysfunction.

#### *Management*

- 1. If a hemolytic reaction is suspected, STOP the transfusion immediately and verify that the correct blood was given to the correct patient. It is imperative to stop the transfusion as soon as possible because the severity of hemolytic reactions is a function of the volume of blood transfused (39).
- 2. If the donor blood is correctly matched to the patient, an acute hemolytic reaction is unlikely. However, the blood bank must be notified, and they will ask for blood samples to perform a plasma-free hemoglobin determination (for evidence of intravascular hemolysis) and a direct Coomb's test (for evidence of the anti-ABO antibody).
- 3. If an acute hemolytic reaction is confirmed, the management is general supportive care, with volume support and vasopressors for hypotension, and ventilatory support for respiratory distress. These reactions are rarely fatal (see [Table](#page-11-0) 12.5).

### **Febrile Nonhemolytic Reactions**

Febrile reactions that are unrelated to hemolysis are the most common adverse reactions to RBC transfusions (see [Table](#page-11-0) 12.5). These reactions are characterized by a temperature elevation >1 °C (1.8 °F) that occurs during, or up to 6 hours after, the transfusion, and there is no other apparent cause (e.g., acute hemolytic reaction) (40). The culprit is the presence of antileukocyte antibodies in recipient blood that react with antigens on leukocytes in donor blood. This triggers the release of endogenous pyrogens from phagocytes, which is the source of the fever. This reaction typically occurs in patients who have received prior transfusions, and in multiparous women. Transfusion of leukocyte-reduced RBCs reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of this reaction (40).

#### *Clinical Features*

The fever does not usually appear in the first hour after the start of the transfusion (unlike the fever associated with acute hemolytic reactions), but it can be accompanied by rigors and chills.

#### *Management*

- 1. The initial approach to transfusion-related fever is the same as described for hemolytic transfusion reactions, even though the fever may not appear until after the transfusion is completed. The diagnosis is confirmed by excluding the presence of hemolysis with the tests described previously.
- 2. The blood bank will perform a Gram stain on the donor blood, and may request blood cultures from the recipient.
- 3. More than 75% of nonhemolytic fevers will not recur with subsequent transfusions (44). Therefore, no special precautions are needed for future transfusions. If a second febrile reaction occurs, leukocyte-reduced RBCs are advised for all subsequent transfusions.

### **Hypersensitivity Reactions**

Hypersensitivity reactions are the result of sensitization to plasma proteins in donor blood from prior transfusions. Patients with IgA deficiency are prone to hypersensitivity transfusion reactions, and prior exposure to plasma products is not required. The most common hypersensitivity reaction is urticaria, which is reported in one of every 100 units transfused (41). More severe anaphylactic reactions (e.g., bronchospasm) are much less common, and anaphylactic shock is rare

#### *Clinical Features*

The usual manifestation is mild urticaria that appears during the transfusion and is not accompanied by fever. The abrupt onset of dyspnea and wheezing during a transfusion could be a sign of an anaphylactic reaction, and hypotension from anaphylactic shock can be mistaken for an acute hemolytic reaction.

#### *Management*

1. Mild urticaria without fever does not require interruption of the transfusion. However, the

popular practice is to stop the transfusion temporarily and administer an antihistamine for symptom relief (e.g., diphenhydramine, 25–50 mg PO, IM, or IV).

- 2. Severe anaphylactic reactions should be managed as described in Chapter 17. The transfusion should be stopped immediately if severe anaphylaxis is suspected.
- 3. For patients who experience an allergic reaction, washed RBCs should be used for all future transfusions, and for patients who experience an anaphylactic reaction, future transfusions should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.
- 4. Patients who develop hypersensitivity reactions should be tested for an underlying IgA deficiency.

### **Acute Lung Injury**

The condition known as *transfusion-related acute lung injury* (TRALI) is an inflammatory lung injury that resembles the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and is associated with RBC and platelet transfusion. It is uncommon (one case per 12,000 RBC transfusions), but is considered the leading cause of transfusion-related deaths, and has a mortality rate that approaches 50% (45).

#### *Etiology*

In 80% of cases, TRALI is the result of antibodies in donor blood that bind to antigens on circulating neutrophils in the recipient (45). This triggers neutrophil activation, and the activated neutrophils become sequestered in pulmonary capillaries and migrate into the lungs to produce the inflammatory injury. Antibodies are not involved in about 20% of cases, but the responsible agent has not been identified.

#### *Clinical Features*

TRALI presents with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure that often appears in the first hour after the transfusion begins, but can appear anytime in the first 6 hours after the start of the transfusion (46), Fever is common, and the chest x-ray can eventually look like the one in [Figure](#page-14-0) 12.5, with extensive infiltration in both lungs that is indistinguishable from ARDS (which is described in Chapter 24). The respiratory failure can be severe at the outset, and often requires mechanical ventilation.

TRALI can be difficult to distinguish from the hydrostatic pulmonary edema in transfusionassociated circulatory overload (described next), which can appear in the same time frame after the onset of transfusion and can even be accompanied by fever (45). Evidence of systemic inflammation (elevated C-reactive protein) will support the diagnosis of TRALI, along with the absence of heart failure or fluid overload (45).

#### *Management*

- 1. If the transfusion is not completed, it should be stopped at the first signs of respiratory difficulty. The blood bank should be notified for all cases of suspected TRALI. (Assays for antileukocyte antibodies are available, but are not routinely used).
- 2. The management of TRALI is supportive, and is similar to the management of ARDS described in Chapter 24.

3. There are no firm recommendations regarding future transfusions in patients who develop TRALI. Some recommend using washed RBCs to remove antibodies from donor blood, but the effectiveness of this measure is unknown.

### **Hydrostatic Pulmonary Edema**

The most common pulmonary complication of red blood cell transfusions is a condition known as *transfusion-associated circulatory overload* (TACO), which has a reported incidence of 1% (45,46). The hallmark of this condition is acute hydrostatic pulmonary edema that appears in the first 6 hours after the transfusion begins. The resulting acute hypoxemic respiratory failure often requires mechanical ventilation, and the reported mortality rate is 20% (46).

**FIGURE 12.5** Portable chest film from a patient with transfusion-related acute lung injury. Note the homogeneous pattern of infiltration in the lungs, which is a characteristics of inflammatory lung injury.

### *Etiology*

There is no correlation between the number of transfused units and the appearance of TACO (46), but the condition appears more frequently in patients with pre-existing heart failure and renal failure, who are prone to fluid overload (45,46). It is also possible that factors other than the infusion volume are operative in this condition.

#### *Clinical Presentation*

The clinical presentation can be indistinguishable from TRALI, with acute onset of hypoxemic respiratory failure in the first 6 hours after the transfusion begins, and a chest x-ray that shows pulmonary edema. Patients are febrile in 30% of cases (45), and mechanical ventilation is required in three-quarters of patients (46). Conditions that favor the diagnosis of TACO include pre-existing heart failure, evidence of fluid overload, or underlying renal insufficiency.

#### *Management*

- 1. The transfusion should be stopped if not completed, and the blood bank should be notified.
- 2. An intravenous loop diuretic is appropriate. Otherwise, the care is supportive (e.g., with mechanical ventilation, if needed), similar to the management of TRALI.
- 3. There are no recommendations regarding future transfusions, although identifying and correcting a positive fluid balance (with diuretics) prior to transfusions is advised.

### **Nosocomial Infections**

The immunosuppressive effects of blood transfusions became evident with the discovery (in the early 1970s) that pre-transplant blood transfusions improve the survival rate of renal allografts (47). Since then, a multitude of clinical studies have shown that *patients who receive blood transfusions have a higher incidence of nosocomial infection*s (42,48,49). The risk of infection increases with the volume of blood transfused, and with the storage time of donor blood (49). There is a possibility that patients who receive blood transfusions are sicker and thus more prone to infections, but at least 22 studies have shown that blood transfusion is an independent risk factor for nosocomial infections (49).

### **What's Worse – Anemia or RBC Transfusions?**

A review of 45 clinical studies involving RBC transfusions for anemia in critically ill patients, which included 272,596 patients, revealed the following (50):

- 1. In 42 of the 45 studies, the risks of RBC transfusions outweighed the benefits, and only one study showed that the benefit of RBC transfusions exceeded the risks.
- 2. Eighteen studies evaluated the impact of RBC transfusions on survival, and 17 of the 18 studies showed that RBC transfusions were an independent risk factor for a fatal outcome.

Not a very good report card for the use of RBC transfusions to increase the hemoglobin concentration. Wouldn't diuresis do the same thing?

## **A FINAL WORD**

### **Blood Volume vs. Blood Cells**

The practice of boosting hemoglobin levels in critically ill patients is rooted in the belief that anemia is a significant threat to tissue oxygenation. However, it seems that even extreme

reductions in hemoglobin or hematocrit do not impair tissue oxygenation when the intravascular volume is maintained (which allows the cardiac output to increase in response to anemia). Blood volume may have supremacy over the hemoglobin and hematocrit for supporting tissue oxygenation, because hypovolemia is a recognized cause of shock (a state of impaired tissue oxygenation), but anemia is not.

The importance of blood volume is often overlooked in discussions of anemia and RBC transfusions, even by the American Red Cross, whose popular slogan, *blood saves lives,* deserves a more accurate upgrade, as shown in [Figure](#page-16-11) 12.6.
