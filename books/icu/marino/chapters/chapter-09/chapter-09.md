# **Systemic Oxygenation**

If one were to name the universal factor in all death... it would certainly be loss of oxygen.

Sherwin Nuland, MD (a)

The management of critically ill patients is dominated by interventions that promote tissue oxygenation, yet it is not possible to monitor tissue  $O_2$  levels in a clinical setting. Instead, tissue oxygenation is evaluated indirectly using global measures of systemic oxygen transport (i.e.,  $O_2$  delivery and  $O_2$  uptake) along with a presumed marker of inadequate tissue oxygenation (i.e., the plasma lactate level). This chapter describes these measures, and how they are used (and misused). The information in this chapter is part of the core knowledge base in critical care; i.e., the knowledge that distinguishes ICU-level care from patient care on a general medical or surgical service.

### **OXYGEN IN BLOOD**

The relevant measures of oxygen  $(O_2)$  in blood include the partial pressure of  $O_2$  (PO<sub>2</sub>), the  $O_2$  saturation of hemoglobin (SO<sub>2</sub>), the concentrations of hemoglobin-bound  $O_2$  and dissolved  $O_2$ , and the total  $O_2$  concentration (also called the  $O_2$  content). The reference values for these measures in arterial and venous blood are shown in Table 9.1.

### **Oxyhemoglobin Dissociation Curve**

The oxygenation of the hemoglobin pool is expressed as the *oxygen saturation of hemoglobin* (SO<sup>2</sup> ), and is the fraction of the hemoglobin pool that is fully saturated with oxygen. The SO<sup>2</sup> is measured (by oximetry) as the ratio of oxygenated hemoglobin to total hemoglobin. (See Chapter 7 for a description of oximetry.) The principal determinants of SO<sup>2</sup> are the PO<sup>2</sup> in blood, and the affinity of hemoglobin for binding O<sup>2</sup> . These relationships are described by the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, which is shown in [Figure](#page-2-0) 9.1. The "S" shape of the curve offers two advantages. First, the arterial PO<sup>2</sup> (PaO<sup>2</sup> ) is normally on the upper, flat part of the curve, which means that a large drop in PaO<sup>2</sup> (down to 60 mm Hg) results in only minor changes in the oxygenation of hemoglobin (the SO<sup>2</sup> ). Secondly, the venous PO<sup>2</sup> (which is ≈40 mm Hg) is on the steep portion of the curve, which facilitates O<sup>2</sup> uptake in the pulmonary capillaries.

**SHIFTS IN THE CURVE:** A number of conditions can alter the affinity of hemoglobin for O<sup>2</sup> and thereby shift the position of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve. These conditions are listed in [Figure](#page-2-0) 9.1. A shift of the curve to the right facilitates O<sup>2</sup> release in tissues, while a shift to the left impedes O<sup>2</sup> release. The position of the curve is indicated by the P50, which is the PO<sup>2</sup> that corresponds to an SO<sup>2</sup> of 50%. The P50 is normally about 27 mm Hg (1), and will increase when the curve shifts to the right, and decrease when the curve shifts to the left. For example, a decrease in the P50 to 15 mm Hg (indicating a leftward shift of the curve) has been reported in blood that is stored in acid-citrate-dextrose (ACD) preservative for 3 weeks, and is attributed to depletion of 2,3 diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) in the red blood cells (2).

**FIGURE 9.1** Oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve showing the normal relationship between the  $PO_2$  in blood and the  $O_2$  saturation of hemoglobin ( $SO_2$ ). The  $P_{50}$  is the  $PO_2$  that corresponds to an  $SO_2$  of 50%. Abbreviations:  $PaO_2$  = arterial  $PO_2$ ,  $PvO_2$  = venous  $PO_2$ ,  $SaO_2$  = arterial  $SO_2$ ,  $SvO_2$  = venous  $SO_2$ .

Shifts in the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve have opposing effects in the pulmonary and systemic capillaries; i.e., a shift to the left impedes  $O_2$  release systemically but facilitates  $O_2$  uptake in the lungs. Therefore, the significance of these shifts for overall  $O_2$  exchange is unclear.

### **Oxygen Content of Blood**

The concentration (content) of  $O_2$  in blood is the summed contribution of the  $O_2$  that is bound to hemoglobin and the  $O_2$  that is dissolved in plasma.

### Hemoglobin-Bound Oxygen

The concentration of hemoglobin-bound  $O_2$  (HbO<sub>2</sub>) is determined by the concentration of hemoglobin [Hb] (usually expressed as grams per deciliter (100 mL), the  $O_2$  binding capacity of hemoglobin (which is 1.34 mL  $O_2$  per gram Hb), and the  $O_2$  saturation of hemoglobin (SO<sub>2</sub>).

This relationship is expressed as follows (3):

$$HbO_2 = 1.34 \times [Hb] \times SO_2 (mL/dL)$$
 (9.1)

(The  $SO_2$  in this equation is expressed as a decimal rather than percentage: e.g., 0.75 instead of 75%.)

#### Dissolved Oxygen

Plasma is about 93% water, and oxygen does not readily dissolve in water (which is why hemoglobin is needed as an  $O_2$  carrier). The solubility of  $O_2$  in plasma is temperature-dependent, and varies inversely with a change in body temperature. At a normal body temperature (37 °C), each increment in  $PO_2$  of 1 mm Hg will increase the concentration of dissolved  $O_2$  in plasma by 0.03 mL/L (4). This is expressed as a *solubility coefficient* of 0.03 mL/L/mm Hg (or 0.003 mL/dL/mm Hg) The concentration of dissolved  $O_2$  in plasma at 37 °C is then determined as follows:

Dissolved 
$$O_2 = 0.003 \times PO_2 \text{ (mL/dL)}$$
 (9.2)

This equation emphasizes the limited volume of dissolved  $O_2$  in the physiological  $PO_2$  range (see next).

#### **Arterial O<sub>2</sub> Content**

The  $O_2$  content in arterial blood (CaO<sub>2</sub>) is determined by combining Equations 9.1 and 9.2 and inserting the  $SO_2$  and  $PO_2$  of arterial blood (SaO<sub>2</sub> and  $PaO_2$ ): i.e.,

$$CaO_2 = (1.34 \times [Hb] \times SaO_2) + (0.003 \times PaO_2) (mL/dL)$$
 (9.3)

Using normal values for {Hb] (15 g/dL),  $SaO_2$  (0.98), and  $PaO_2$  (90 mm Hg) yields the following:

<span id="page-3-0"></span>
$$CaO_2 = (19.7) + (0.27)$$
 (9.4)

Thus, the normal arterial  $O_2$  content is about 20 mL/dL (or 200 mL/L), and *only 1.5% represents dissolved oxygen*.

### Anemia vs. Hypoxemia

The relative impact of anemia and hypoxemia on the arterial  $O_2$  content ( $CaO_2$ ) is shown in Figure 9.2. Note that a 50% reduction in [Hb] (from 15 to 7.5 g/dL) results in an equivalent 50% reduction in  $CaO_2$  (from 20 to 10 mL/dL), while a 50% reduction in the  $PaO_2$  (from 90 to 45 mm Hg, corresponding to a decrease in  $SaO_2$  from 98% to 78%) results in only a 20% decrease in  $CaO_2$  (from 20 to 16 mL/dL). This demonstrates that *anemia has a much greater influence on arterial oxygenation than hypoxemia*.

<span id="page-4-0"></span>![](_page_4_Figure_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 9.2** The influence of proportional degrees of anemia and hypoxemia on the oxygen content in arterial blood  $(CaO_2)$ .

#### **Venous O<sub>2</sub> Content**

The venous  $O_2$  content ( $CvO_2$ ) represents the  $O_2$  content in "mixed" venous blood (from the right heart or pulmonary artery). The equation describing  $CvO_2$  is similar in format to Equation 9.3, but the  $SO_2$  and  $PO_2$  are for mixed venous blood ( $SvO_2$  and  $PvO_2$ ).

$$CvO_2 = (1.34 \times [Hb] \times SvO_2) + (0.003 \times PvO_2)$$
 (9.5)

As shown in Table 9.1, the normal mixed venous  $O_2$  content is about 15 mL/dL, and less than 1% (0.1 mL/dL) represents dissolved  $O_2$ . Note also that the difference between the arterial and venous  $O_2$  content ( $CaO_2 - CvO_2$ ) is 5 mL/dL, or 50 mL/L, which means that 50 mL of  $O_2$  is extracted from each liter of blood flowing through the capillaries. At a normal cardiac output of 5 L/min, the  $O_2$  extracted from capillary blood would be 5 × 50 = 250 mL/min, which is the normal  $O_2$  consumption in an adult at rest. This demonstrates how the oxygenation of blood can provide information about the oxygen utilization in tissues.

### Simplified O<sub>2</sub> Content Equation

The dissolved  $O_2$  is such a small fraction of the total  $O_2$  content that it is usually eliminated from the equation describing  $O_2$  content, as shown below.

### **Volume Distribution of O<sup>2</sup> in Blood**

Although the O<sup>2</sup> content in arterial blood exceeds that in venous blood, the volume of O<sup>2</sup> (i.e., the product of the O<sup>2</sup> content and blood volume), in arterial blood is far lower than in venous blood. This is shown in [Table](#page-0-0) 9.1, where the volume of O<sup>2</sup> in arterial blood (250 mL) is less than half the volume in venous blood (555 mL). This is a reflection of the uneven distribution of blood volume in arteries and veins: i.e., the arteries contain only 25% of the total blood volume, while the remaining 75% is in the venous circulation. Thus, of the total volume of O<sup>2</sup> in the blood (250 + 555 = 805 mL), about 70% (555/805) is not available for aerobic metabolism because it is in the venous circulation.

### **OXYGEN TRANSPORT**

The transport of O<sup>2</sup> from the lungs to metabolizing tissues is described by three parameters: the rate of O<sup>2</sup> delivery in arterial blood (O<sup>2</sup> delivery), the rate of O<sup>2</sup> uptake from the systemic microcirculation (O<sup>2</sup> uptake), and the fractional extraction of O<sup>2</sup> from capillary blood (O<sup>2</sup> extraction ratio). The reference ranges for these measures are listed in [Table](#page-5-0) 9.2, including both absolute and size-adjusted ranges. The preferred measure of body size for hemodynamic parameters is the body surface area (BSA) in square meters (m2). (See Equation 8.3 for the calculation of BSA.) An average-sized adult has a BSA of about 1.7 m2.

<sup>†</sup>Size-adjusted values are the absolute values divided by the patient's body surface area in square meters (m2).

## **Oxygen Delivery (DO2)**

The rate of O<sup>2</sup> delivery in arterial blood (DO<sup>2</sup> ) is the product of the cardiac output (CO) and the O<sup>2</sup> content of arterial blood (CaO<sup>2</sup> ) (5); i.e.,

<span id="page-5-1"></span>
$$DO_2 = CO \times CaO_2 \times 10 \text{ (mL/min)}$$
(9.7)

(The multiplier of 10 is used to convert the CaO<sup>2</sup> from mL/dL to mL/L.) If the CaO<sup>2</sup> is broken down into its components (1.34 × [Hb] × SaO<sup>2</sup> ), [Equation](#page-5-1) 9.7 can be rewritten as:

$$DO_2 = CO \times (1.34 \times [Hb] \times SaO_2) \times 10$$
(9.8)

Three measurements are needed to calculate the DO<sup>2</sup> : cardiac output, hemoglobin concentration, and arterial O<sup>2</sup> saturation. If the DO<sup>2</sup> is expressed in relation to body size (BSA), the "cardiac index" (CI = CO/BSA) is used instead of the cardiac output. The DO<sup>2</sup> in healthy adults at rest is 900**–**1,100 mL/min, or 500**–**600 mL/min/m2 when ad-justed for body size.

### **Oxygen Uptake**

The rate of O<sup>2</sup> transport from the systemic capillaries into the tissues is called the *oxygen uptake* (VO<sup>2</sup> ). Since oxygen is not stored in tissues, the VO<sup>2</sup> is also a measure of the *oxygen consumption* in systemic tissues. The VO<sup>2</sup> can be calculated as the product of the cardiac output (CO) and the difference between arterial and venous O<sup>2</sup> content (CaO<sup>2</sup> – CvO<sup>2</sup> ).

<span id="page-6-0"></span>
$$VO_2 = CO \times (CaO_2 - CvO_2) \times 10 \text{ (mL/min)}$$
(9.9)

(The multiplier of 10 is included for the same reason as explained for the DO<sup>2</sup> .) This equation is a modified version of the Fick equation for cardiac output (i.e., CO = VO<sup>2</sup> / CaO<sup>2</sup> – CvO<sup>2</sup> ), and has been called the *reverse Fick method* (6). The CaO<sup>2</sup> and CvO<sup>2</sup> in [Equation](#page-6-0) 9.9 share a common term (1.34 × [Hb]), so the equation can be restated as:

$$VO_2 = CO \times 1.34 \times [Hb] \times (SaO_2 - SvO_2) \times 10$$
 (9.10)

Thus, four measurements are required to calculate the VO<sup>2</sup> : the same 3 measurements used to calculate the DO<sup>2</sup> , plus the O<sup>2</sup> saturation in "mixed" venous blood in the pulmonary arteries (SvO<sup>2</sup> ), which requires a pulmonary artery catheter. When the VO<sup>2</sup> is expressed in relation to body size (BSA), the "cardiac index" (CI = CO/BSA) is used instead of the cardiac output. The VO<sup>2</sup> in healthy adults at rest is 200–300 mL/min, or 110–160 mL/min/m2.

#### *Variability*

Each of the 4 measurements used to derive the VO<sup>2</sup> has an inherent variability, and these are shown in [Table](#page-7-0) 9.3 (6–8). The variability of the calculated VO<sup>2</sup> is ±18%, which is the summed variability of the individual components. Therefore, *the VO<sup>2</sup> that is calculated from the modified Fick equation must change by at least 18% for the change to be considered significant.*

### *Calculated vs. Measured VO<sup>2</sup>*

*The calculated VO<sup>2</sup> is not the whole-body VO<sup>2</sup> because it does not include the VO<sup>2</sup> of the lungs*. Normally, the VO<sup>2</sup> of the lungs accounts for less than 5% of the whole-body VO<sup>2</sup> (9), but it can make up 20% of the whole body VO<sup>2</sup> when there is inflammation in the lungs (10).

**MEASURED VO<sup>2</sup> :** The measurement of the whole body VO<sup>2</sup> involves simultaneous measurements of the O<sup>2</sup> concentration in inhaled and exhaled gas. This requires an instrument that is equipped with an oxygen analyzer, such as the "metabolic carts" used for indirect calorimetry (see Chapter

48). The  $O_2$  analyzer is connected to the proximal airway (usually in intubated patients) to record the fractional concentration of  $O_2$  in inhaled and exhaled gas (Fi $O_2$  and Fe $O_2$ ). The instrument also records the minute ventilation (VE), and the VO<sub>2</sub> is derived as follows:

$$VO_2 = VE \times (FiO_2 - FeO_2)$$
 (9.11)

The measured  $VO_2$  has a reported variability of  $\pm 5\%$  (6,8), which is much less than the variability of the calculated  $VO_2$  ( $\pm 18\%$ ). The major drawback of the  $VO_2$  measurement is the need for specialized equipment and trained personnel, which limits availability.

From References 6-8.

### **Oxygen Extraction Ratio**

The fractional uptake of  $O_2$  into tissues is expressed as the *oxygen extraction ratio* ( $O_2$ ER), which is the ratio of  $O_2$  uptake ( $VO_2$ ) to  $O_2$  delivery ( $DO_2$ ).

<span id="page-7-2"></span><span id="page-7-1"></span>
$$O_2ER = VO_2 / DO_2$$
 (9.12)

This ratio can be multiplied by 100 and expressed as a percentage. The  $VO_2$  and  $DO_2$  share common terms (Q × 1.34 x [Hb] x 10), which allows Equation 9.12 to be restated as follows:

$$O_2ER = (SaO_2 - SvO_2) / SaO_2$$
 (9.13)

If the  $SaO_2$  is close to 100% (close to 1.0), the denominator in Equation 9.13 can be eliminated; i.e.,

$$O_2ER = (SaO_2 - SvO_2)$$
 (9.14)

or the equation can be futher simplified to include only a single variable:

<span id="page-7-4"></span><span id="page-7-3"></span>
$$O_2ER = 1 - SvO_2$$
 (9.15)

The VO<sup>2</sup> is normally about 25% of the DO<sup>2</sup> , so the normal O2ER is 0.25 (range = 0.2–0.3), as shown in [Table](#page-5-0) 9.2. Thus, *only 25% of the O<sup>2</sup> delivered to the capillaries is taken up into the tissues* when conditions are normal. This changes when O<sup>2</sup> delivery is reduced, as described next.

# **OXYGEN EXTRACTION**

The oxygen transport system operates to maintain a constant VO<sup>2</sup> in the face of decreases in O<sup>2</sup> delivery (DO<sup>2</sup> ), and this is accomplished by compensatory increases in the O<sup>2</sup> extraction ratio (O2ER) (11). This is explained by rearranging the terms in [Equation](#page-7-1) 9.12 so that VO<sup>2</sup> is the derived variable:

<span id="page-8-0"></span>
$$VO_2 = DO_2 \times O_2 ER \tag{9.16}$$

This equation predicts that the VO<sup>2</sup> will remain constant when DO<sup>2</sup> is decreased if there is an proportional increase in O<sup>2</sup> extraction. However, if the increase in O<sup>2</sup> extraction cannot fully compensate for a decrease in DO<sup>2</sup> , then the VO<sup>2</sup> will begin to decrease, and this marks the onset of oxygen-limited (anaerobic) metabolism.

The relationships in [Equation](#page-8-0) 9.16 are illustrated in [Figure](#page-9-0) 9.3. The graph shows the effects of a progressive decrease in DO<sup>2</sup> on the VO<sup>2</sup> , and the boxes show the O<sup>2</sup> extraction at relevant points on the curve. In this case, O<sup>2</sup> extraction is represented by the (SaO2–SvO<sup>2</sup> ) difference, which is allowed because the SaO<sup>2</sup> is typically maintained at >90% (i.e., close to 1.0). This creates the following relationships:

$$VO_2 = DO_2 \times (SaO_2 - SvO_2)$$
 (9.17)

The graph indicates that, as DO<sup>2</sup> decreases below normal (moving to the left along the curve), the VO<sup>2</sup> initially remains unchanged, indicating that there is a compensatory increase in (SaO2– SvO<sup>2</sup> ). However, a point is eventually reached where the VO<sup>2</sup> begins to decrease, and at this point, the (SaO2–SvO<sup>2</sup> ) difference has increased from 25% to 50%. Beyond this point, the VO<sup>2</sup> decreases in response to a decrease in DO<sup>2</sup> , indicating that O<sup>2</sup> extraction is no longer able to fully compensate for the declining DO<sup>2</sup> . The point where the VO<sup>2</sup> becomes "delivery-dependent" is the threshold for O<sup>2</sup> -limited metabolism (12).

**FIGURE 9.3** Graph showing the relationship between  $O_2$  delivery (DO<sub>2</sub>) and  $O_2$  uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>). The  $O_2$  extraction ratio (O<sub>2</sub>ER) is represented by (SaO<sub>2</sub> – SvO<sub>2</sub>) difference. See text for explanation).

The relationships in Figure 9.3 indicate that the  $(SaO_2-SvO_2)$  difference can be used to assess the balance between  $O_2$  delivery and  $O_2$  consumption, and more importantly, to identify when tissue oxygenation is threatened or impaired.

### The (SaO<sub>2</sub> - SvO<sub>2</sub>) Difference

As shown in Equation 9.14, the  $(SaO_2-SvO_2)$  difference can be used as a measure of  $O_2$  extraction as long as the  $SaO_2$  exceeds 90%. The following are some guidelines for the interpretation of the  $(SaO_2-SvO_2)$  difference, which are summarized in Table 9.4. (*Note:*  $O_2$  extraction is influenced by the metabolic rate, and the following guidelines are valid only if the metabolic rate is normal.)

- . The normal  $(SaO_2 SvO_2)$  is 20–30%.
- . An increase in  $(SaO_2 SvO_2)$  above 30% indicates a decrease in  $O_2$  delivery (from hypoxemia, anemia, or decreased cardiac output).
- . An increase in  $(SaO_2 SvO_2)$  to  $\geq 50\%$  indicates that tissue oxygenation is threatened or impaired. This has been validated in animal studies (13).
- . A decrease in (SaO $_2$  SvO $_2$ ) to <20% indicates a defect in O $_2$  utilization in tissues, which is

usually the result of sepsis. This condition has also been called "peripheral shunting", since it mimics the changes produced by peripheral arteriovenous shunts.

The SaO<sup>2</sup> is monitored continuously with pulse oximetry (which is mandatory in ICU patients), and the SvO<sup>2</sup> is measured in "mixed venous" blood in the pulmonary arteries, which requires a pulmonary artery (PA) catheter. The SvO<sup>2</sup> can be monitored continuously with specialized PA catheters capable of venous oximetry (e.g., Triox™-PAC, ICU Medical, San Clemente, CA). The technique of venous oximetry is described in Chapter 7, and illustrated in Figure 7.5.

## **Venous O<sup>2</sup> Saturation (SvO2)**

When the SaO<sup>2</sup> approaches 100%, the SvO<sup>2</sup> can be used alone to evaluate O<sup>2</sup> extraction, as described in [Equation](#page-7-4) 9.15. This equation demonstrates that the SvO<sup>2</sup> varies inversely with changes in O<sup>2</sup> extraction: e.g., an increase in O<sup>2</sup> extraction will result in a decrease in SvO<sup>2</sup> . The following are some guidelines for interpreting the SvO<sup>2</sup> , which are summarized in [Table](#page-10-0) 9.4.

- 1. The normal range for SvO<sup>2</sup> in pulmonary artery blood is 65–75% (14).
- 2. The SvO<sup>2</sup> varies spontaneously by an average of 5% (15), so a change in SvO<sup>2</sup> should exceed 5% to be considered significant.
- 3. A decrease in SvO<sup>2</sup> to <65% indicates a decrease in O<sup>2</sup> delivery (from hypoxemia, anemia, or decreased cardiac output).
- 4. A decrease in SvO<sup>2</sup> to ≤50% indicates that tissue oxygenation is threatened or impaired (16).
- 5. An SvO<sup>2</sup> that is 80% or higher is a sign of impaired O<sup>2</sup> utilization in metabolizing tissues, and is usually the result of sepsis.

### **Central Venous O<sup>2</sup> Saturation (ScvO2)**

The decline in popularity of pulmonary artery catheters has shifted attention to the O<sup>2</sup> saturation in the superior vena cava; i.e., the "central venous O<sup>2</sup> saturation" (ScvO<sup>2</sup> ). The relevant information about ScvO<sup>2</sup> is summarized in the following statements.

1. The ScvO<sup>2</sup> is lower than the SvO<sup>2</sup> in healthy subjects. However, it is higher than the SvO<sup>2</sup> (by an average of 7%) in critically ill patients (14,17), and this difference can be as high as 18% in patients with circulatory shock (17,18). The ScvO<sup>2</sup> is heavily influenced by the cerebral

venous O<sup>2</sup> saturation, and the elevated ScvO<sup>2</sup> in circulatory shock is attributed to peripheral vasoconstriction with relative preservation of cerebral blood flow.

- 2. Despite the discrepancy between ScvO<sup>2</sup> and SvO<sup>2</sup> , changes in ScvO<sup>2</sup> generally mirror those in the SvO<sup>2</sup> (17), and *trends in the ScvO<sup>2</sup> are considered more reliable than individual measurements* (19). The definition of a significant change in ScvO<sup>2</sup> is the same as that mentioned for the SVO<sup>2</sup> (i.e., Δ >5%).
- 3. The normal range of ScvO<sup>2</sup> is not well defined, but an ScvO<sup>2</sup> of 70% is one of the recommended goals of hemodynamic management in circulatory shock (20).

The ScvO<sup>2</sup> can be monitored with central venous catheters or peripherally-inserted central catheters (PICCs); both catheters are available as oximetry catheters (e.g., Triox™-CVC and Triox™-PICC, ICU Medical, San Clemente, CA) that provide continuous ScvO<sup>2</sup> monitoring.

### **Tissue O<sup>2</sup> Saturation (StO2)**

The technique of *near-infrared spectroscopy* (NIRS) is a form of oximetry that uses an optical probe on the skin to measure the O<sup>2</sup> saturation of hemoglobin in the microcirculation of the underlying tissue. This measurement is known as the *tissue O<sup>2</sup> saturation* (StO<sup>2</sup> ), which is a misleading term because the measured variable is mostly in blood. Since most of the blood in the microcirculation is in the venules, the StO<sup>2</sup> is primarily a reflection of venous O<sup>2</sup> saturation (SvO<sup>2</sup> or ScvO<sup>2</sup> ) (21). (The StO<sup>2</sup> in muscle can also be influenced by the O<sup>2</sup> saturation of myoglobin) (22).

In adults, NIRS has been used to monitor the StO<sup>2</sup> in the cerebral cortex (23) and in skeletal muscle (24). In patients with circulatory shock, there is a close correlation between changes in skeletal muscle StO<sup>2</sup> and changes in systemic O<sup>2</sup> delivery (DO<sup>2</sup> ), suggesting that StO<sup>2</sup> monitoring could serve as a noninvasive means of tracking changes in O<sup>2</sup> delivery (24).

One of the major limitations of the StO<sup>2</sup> measurement is the inability to define normal and abnormal levels, since there is a marked variability in the StO<sup>2</sup> in healthy subjects, and in patients with circulatory shock (25). This could be a reflection of the methodology, because photons scatter in tissues (i.e., they do not follow a straight path from light source back to the photodetector), and the degree of scatter can vary greatly in individual subjects and in different pathological states.

## **LACTATE**

An increase in the plasma lactate concentration (>2 mmol/L) is considered the most reliable marker of inadequate tissue oxygenation, and it is a stated requirement for the diagnosis of circulatory shock (26). However, the traditional concepts about lactate are changing, as explained in this section.

#### **Lactate and Survival**

Clinical studies have consistently shown that the mortality rate in critically ill patients is directly

related to the initial plasma lactate level, and to the time required for the lactate level to return to normal after treatment is initiated. This is demonstrated in [Figure](#page-13-0) 9.4. The graph on the left shows the relationship between the initial lactate level and in-hospital mortality (27), and the graph on the right shows the relationship between mortality and the time required to normalize the plasma lactate (called "lactate clearance") (28).

The relationship between plasma lactate levels and survival highlights the importance of monitoring plasma lactate in critically ill patients. However, this relationship is *not* evidence that lactate is a marker of inadequate tissue oxygenation, as explained next.

#### *Circular Reasoning*

The relationship between plasma lactate levels and survival is considered evidence that lactate is a marker of inadequate tissue oxygenation because of the popular notion that oxygen deprivation is the universal source of cell death in critically ill patients. However, this notion is largely *based* on the relationship between plasma lactate levels and survival.

#### *Contrary Evidence*

Because of the difficulties in recording the PO<sup>2</sup> in cells (and especially in mitochondria), there is no evidence that cell death in critically ill patients is the result of O<sup>2</sup> deprivation. However, there is evidence to the contrary: i.e., in animal studies using a positron-emitting marker of cell hypoxia (18F-fluoromisonidazole), there was no evidence of cell hypoxia in any of the major organs in septic shock (29), and human studies using PO<sup>2</sup> recordings from skeletal muscle have reported that *tissue PO<sup>2</sup> levels are actually increased in patients with septic shock* (30,31).

Considering that the intracellular PO<sup>2</sup> in skeletal muscle averages 5 mm Hg, and can be <1 mm Hg (32), while the recorded PO<sup>2</sup> in cardiac myocytes is 0.2–2.4 mm Hg (33), it seems that cells normally operate at very low PO<sup>2</sup> levels, which is contrary to the idea that cell death is the result of low PO<sup>2</sup> levels. In fact, an oxygen-poor environment in cells is advantageous because it limits the risk of oxidative cell injury.

The observations just presented suggest that cellular O<sup>2</sup> deprivation may not be the universal culprit in cell death (and organ failure) in critically ill patients, and this implies that aerobic lactate production may be much more common than suspected (see next).

<span id="page-13-0"></span>![](_page_13_Figure_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 9.4** Graphs showing the relationship between plasma lactate levels and in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients. The graph on the left shows the relationship between the initial lactate level and mortality (27), and the graph on the right shows the relationship between the mortality rate and the time for increased lactate levels to normalize (lactate clearance) (28).

#### **Aerobic Lactate Production**

The role of aerobic lactate production is explained using the pathways of glucose metabolism in [Figure](#page-15-0) 9.5. There are two general pathways for glucose metabolism: one is located in the cytoplasm, and is known as *glycolysis*, and the other is located in mitochondria, and is involved in *oxidative phosphorylation* (i.e., the production of ATP). The glycolytic pathway operates in the presence or absence of oxygen, while the mitochondrial pathway proceeds only in the presence of oxygen. The traditional teaching is that glycolysis reaches a pivotal point with the formation of pyruvate: when O<sup>2</sup> is available, pyruvate moves into mitochondria via the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase, and when O<sup>2</sup> is not available, pyruvate is reduced to lactate using the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).

According to the scheme just presented, pyruvate is the end-point of aerobic glycolysis, and lactate is the end-point of anaerobic glycolysis. However this is not the case, because lactate is produced under aerobic conditions: i.e., the daily production of lactate averages about 20 mmol/kg body weight (34). In fact, the reaction that converts pyruvate to lactate has an equilibrium constant that strongly favors lactate formation. The aerobic production of lactate is enhanced in several clinical conditions, including those listed in [Table](#page-14-0) 9.5. Many of the conditions in this table are likely to be encountered in critically ill patients, including those described next.

#### *Sepsis*

Hyperlactatemia is considered a universal consequence of sepsis and septic shock (26, 35), and two sources of this phenomenon have been identified. The principal source is inhibition of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) enzyme that allows pyruvate to enter mitochondria and fuel oxidative phosphorylation (see [Figure](#page-15-0) 9.5) (36). The culprits in this inhibition are bacterial products (e.g., endotoxin) and proinflammatory cytokines (37,38). The result is enhanced lactate production that is not the result of cellular hypoxia. Sepsis-induced inhibition of the PDH enzyme would explain why the cell injury in sepsis is attributed to a defect in O<sup>2</sup> utilization in mitochondria (38). Sepsis is also associated with a catecholamine-driven increase in the rate of glycolysis (39), and this (especially when combined with inhibition of the PDH enzyme) is the second source of aerobic lactate production in sepsis.

As just described, there is considerable evidence that the hyperlactatemia in sepsis is the result of aerobic (not anaerobic) lactate production. Considering that sepsis is the leading cause of in-hospital deaths in the United States (40), it is reasonable to conclude that aerobic hyperlactatemia is much more common than suspected in critically ill patients.

#### *Physiological Stress*

Stressful conditions are associated with an increase in glucose uptake into cells, which is attributed to the accumulation of a glucose transporter protein at the cell surface (41). This effect, combined with the stimulatory effect of catecholamines mentioned previously (39), results in a considerable (40–50%) increase in the rate of aerobic glycolysis, and a subsequent increase in aerobic lactate production (29).

### *Thiamine Deficiency*

The PDH enzyme that draws pyruvate into the mitochondrion (and thereby fuels oxidative phosphorylation) requires thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) as a cofactor (see [Figure](#page-15-0) 9.5), and deficiency of this cofactor will divert pyruvate to the production of lactate and enhance aerobic lactate production. This is the mechanism for the hyperlactatemia in thiamine deficiency (42), which is considered a common and often unrecognized condition in critically ill patients (43).

See text for further explanation.

#### *Conclusion*

The information just presented indicates that *increased lactate production in critically ill patients may be predominantly aerobic in origin*. In fact, anaerobic lactate production is likely to be an uncommon event, as stated in a recent review of this topic (44):

Today, it is well established that any increase in lactate concentration typically represents something other than O<sup>2</sup> limitation; hypoxia-driven lactate accumulation is very much the exception rather than the rule.

So why is lactate production increased in critical illness? One possible answer is presented next.

#### **Lactate as an Oxidative Fuel**

Lactate can be viewed, not as a waste product of anaerobic metabolism, but rather as an alternative fuel source during periods of metabolic stress (39,44). The energy yield from the oxidative metabolism of lactate is equivalent to that of glucose, and this is shown in [Table](#page-16-0) 9.6. The caloric density (kcal/g) of lactate and glucose are equivalent and, since one glucose molecule

produces 2 lactate molecules, the energy yield from the complete oxidation of lactate and glucose are equivalent. Thus, lactate can serve as a source of energy when glucose availability is threatened by heightened metabolic demands.

|              |                                                       | Energy Yield |          |

| Glucose      | 180                                                   | 673          | 3.74     |
| Lactate      | 90                                                    | 326          | 3.62     |
| Lactate x 2  | 180                                                   | 652          | 3.62     |

In conditions of metabolic stress (such as sepsis), lactate is often used as an oxidative fuel by the heart and brain. In this situation, lactate can provide 60% of the energy needs of the myocardium (44), and there is evidence that lactate improves cardiac performance in circulatory shock (45). Lactate can also provide about 25–30% of the energy needs of the brain in stressful conditions (46). Adaptations like these help to preserve the viability of the heart and brain in lifethreatening conditions.

# **A FINAL WORD**

### **Is Cellular Hypoxia a Common Cause of Death?**

Since it is not possible to monitor tissue O<sup>2</sup> levels, the notion that impaired tissue oxygenation is responsible for multiorgan failure and fatal outcomes in critically ill patients is largely based on studies showing a correlation between plasma lactate levels and mortality. However, this interpretation is based on the assumption that lactate elevation is a marker of anaerobic metabolism in critically ill patients, which is likely not the case (as presented in the latter part of this chapter).

There is evidence (from animal studies) that intracellular PO<sup>2</sup> levels are as low as 1 mm Hg (47), and further, that aerobic production of ATP can continue down to PO<sup>2</sup> levels of ≤0.5 mm Hg (33,48). These observations indicate that *there is an oxygen-poor environment in the interior of cells, and that aerobic metabolism is designed to operate in such an environment* (49). As such, cell injury from a low PO<sup>2</sup> seems unlikely. The culprit in multiorgan failure is more likely to be inflammatory cell injury, especially in sepsis/septic shock, which is the leading cause of inhospital deaths in the United States (40).

So, why is there an oxygen-poor environment in our cells? For the same reason that we store food in vacuum-sealed containers, and wrap our sandwiches in cellophane; i.e., because *oxygen disrupts or decomposes organic (carbon-based) matter,* which includes all of our vital cell components. (See Chapter 25 for more on oxygen-related cell injury.)
