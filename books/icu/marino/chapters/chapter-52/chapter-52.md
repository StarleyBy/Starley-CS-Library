# **Pharmaceutical Drug Overdoses**

*A desire to take medicine is, perhaps, the great feature which distinguishes man from other animals.*

Sir William Osler (*[a](#page-14-0)*)

Prescription drug use in the United States is commonplace, (see [Figure](#page-1-0) 52.1), indicating that man's desire to take drugs may be matched by physicians' desire to prescribe them, and this may explain, at least in part, why deaths from drug overdoses have increased more than 5-fold in the past 20-odd years (from 20,000 deaths in the year 2000, to 108,000 deaths in 2022) ([1\)](#page-14-1). This chapter describes some of the more frequent or more problematic pharmaceutical drug overdoses, including intoxications from acetaminophen, benzodiazepines, β-blockers, opioids, and salicylates. You won't have to spend much time in an ICU to encounter one of these overdoses.

## **ACETAMINOPHEN**

Acetaminophen is a ubiquitous, over-the-counter analgesic-antipyretic agent that is included in over 600 commercial drug preparations. It is also a hepatotoxin, and is *the leading cause of acute liver failure in North America, Europe, and Australia* ([2\)](#page-14-2). In the United States, acetaminophen is responsible for almost half of the cases of acute liver failure (see Figure 39.1) ([3\)](#page-14-3), and about *half of the overdoses are unintentional* [\(4](#page-14-4)). In 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a mandate for more prominent labeling of the risks of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity, along with a requirement that prescription acetaminophen products be limited to 325 mg per dosage (5). Unfortunately, this mandate has had little impact on the prevalence of acute liver failure from acetaminophen. (See A FINAL WORD for more on this issue.)

**FIGURE 52.2** The hepatic metabolism of acetaminophen. See text for explanation.

## **Toxic Mechanism**

The toxicity of acetaminophen is related to its metabolism in the liver, and the metabolic pathways are shown [Figure](#page-2-0) 52.2. The bulk of acetaminophen metabolism involves the formation of nontoxic sulfate and glucuronide conjugates, which are excreted in the urine. About 10% of the metabolism involves the oxidation of acetaminophen by a cytochrome P450 oxidase group of enzymes to form a toxic metabolite that is capable of lethal cell injury. When the daily dose of acetaminophen is not excessive, the toxic metabolite is removed by conjugation with the cysteine moiety in glutathione, the major intracellular antioxidant. (*Note:* Glutathione is a tripeptide that is composed of cysteine. glutamine, and glycine.) When the daily dose of acetaminophen is excessive (i.e., above 4 grams/day), the nontoxic conjugation pathway becomes saturated, which diverts acetaminophen metabolism to the pathway with the toxic metabolite. The increased traffic in this pathway begins to deplete glutathione reserves, and when glutathione levels fall by 70%, the toxic acetaminophen metabolite accumulates and causes hepatocellular injury [\(3](#page-14-3)).

#### *Toxic Dose*

- 1. The toxic dose of acetaminophen can vary in individual patients, but is somewhere between 7.5 and 15 grams daily in most adults (6,7). Many poison control centers use 10 grams as a threshold dose that requires further investigation (8). However, certain conditions can increase the susceptibility to acetaminophen hepatotoxicity (see next section).
- 2. According to the FDA, the maximum dose of acetaminophen that is safe in adults is 4 grams per day (9). However, some clinical practice guidelines recommend that for chronic acetaminophen use, the daily dose should not exceed 3 grams (10).

## *Predisposing Conditions*

The following conditions can increase the risk of liver damage from acetaminophen. In the presence of these conditions, a daily acetaminophen dose of >4 grams should be considered as potentially toxic (8).

- 1. Malnutrition, or prolonged periods of fasting, are recognized risk factors because of the potential for depletion of hepatic glutathione stores.
- 2. Patients with chronic alcohol use disorder are at increased risk of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity, *even when daily acetaminophen doses are below the recommended safe level (i.e., <4 grams daily)* (11). This is likely due to the ability of alcohol to increase the activity of the cytochrome P450 enzyme, plus the possible contribution of glutathione depletion from poor nutrition.
- 3. Patients with chronic liver disease are also considered high risk for acetaminophen hepatotoxicity (8), although the evidence for this is not convincing (12).
- 4. Drugs that stimulate cytochrome P450 activity can increase the risk of liver damage from acetaminophen. These drugs include anticonvulsants (carbamazepine and phenytoin) and antituberculosis drugs (INH and rifampin) (12). Opioids can also increase the risk by competing for the nontoxic conjugation pathway, thereby diverting acetaminophen metabolism toward the production of the toxic metabolite (12).

## **Clinical Presentation**

The clinical presentation of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity can be divided into three stages:

- 1. *Stage 1 (First 24 hours):* Symptoms are absent or nonspecific (e.g., nausea, vomiting, malaise), and there may be no evidence of hepatic injury.
- 2. *Stage 2 (24–72 hours):* Hepatic aminotransferases (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase, [ALT]) begin to rise at 24 hours, and can reach levels of 10,000 IU/L (13). Signs of progressive hepatic injury (e.g., jaundice and prolonged INR) begin to appear, and there may be signs of renal impairment.
- 3. *Stage 3 (72–96 hours):* The hepatic injury peaks at 72–96 hours (12). Hepatic encephalopathy may be evident at this time, along with progressive lactic acidosis and acute, oliguric renal failure. Death from multiorgan failure usually occurs at this time.

## **Risk Assessment**

The evaluation of acetaminophen overdoses must include the following: (*a*) the time and dose

ingested, (*b*) the type of ingestion (acute overdose versus unintentional supratherapeutic dosing), (*c*) the drug preparation (immediate vs. extended release), (*d*) the presence of predisposing conditions, and (*e*) evidence of hepatic injury. If an overdose presents within 24 hours of ingestion of an immediate-release preparation, the plasma acetaminophen level can identify the need for antidotal therapy.

<span id="page-4-0"></span>![](_page_4_Figure_1.jpeg)

**FIGURE 52.3** Nomogram for predicting the risk of hepatotoxicity according to the plasma acetaminophen level between 4 and 24 hours after ingestion. See text for explanation. Nomogram redrawn from Reference 14.

## *Predictive Nomogram*

Plasma acetaminophen levels obtained from 4 to 24 hours after an acute drug ingestion can be used to predict the risk of hepatotoxicity using the nomogram in [Figure](#page-4-0) 52.3 (14). If the plasma level is above the treatment line (which extends from 150 μg/mL at 4 hrs, to 5 μg/mL at 24 hrs), the risk of hepatotoxicity is high enough to warrant antidotal therapy with N-acetylcysteine. If the plasma level is above the high-risk line (from 300 μg/mL at 4 hrs, to 10 μg/mL at 24 hrs), there is a 90% chance of developing hepatotoxicity, and these cases may require extended treatment with N-acetylcysteine (see later).

The predictive nomogram is useful only for acute ingestions that can be accurately timed. If an extended-release preparation was ingested and the plasma acetaminophen level is not above

the treatment line at 4–12 hours after ingestion, a repeat level should be obtained after another 4– 6 hours (14). For repeated supratherapeutic ingestions, plasma levels do not predict the risk of hepatotoxicity, and evaluating risk can be challenging.

## **N-Acetylcysteine**

Glutathione does not readily cross cell membranes, so exogenous glutathione is not a viable treatment option for acetaminophen hepatotoxicity. However, glutathione is a tripeptide (i.e., glutamine, cysteine, and glycine), and the cysteine moiety is involved in clearing the toxic acetaminophen metabolite, so a cysteine surrogate, such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC), is a logical (and effective) antidote for acetaminophen hepatotoxicity (see Fig. [52.2](#page-2-0)).

Treatment with NAC is indicated for any patient with a plasma acetaminophen level above the treatment line in the predictive nomogram. However, *NAC is also recommended for any case of potential acetaminophen hepatotoxicity when the hepatic aminotransferase levels are increased* (14).

#### *Intravenous Regimen*

The treatment with NAC can be intravenous or oral. The intravenous route is preferred, and the IV regimen is shown in [Table](#page-5-0) 52.1. The treatment proceeds in two stages (14). The first stage involves a 21-hour infusion of NAC, which is given in 3 separate aliquots, at a total dose of 300 mg/kg [\(2](#page-14-2)). This is followed by an [evaluation](#page-5-0) of 4 goals of treatment, which are listed in Table 52.1 as the "NAC stopping criteria". If these goals have not been achieved, the NAC infusion is continued at a dose rate of at least 6.25 mg/kg/hr (14), and the goals are re-evaluated again 12– 24 hours later. The NAC infusion is continued until the goals have been achieved.

## <span id="page-5-0"></span>**TABLE 52.1 Intravenous N-Acetylcysteine for Acetaminophen Hepatotoxicity**

#### **1. Regimen:**

Use 20% NAC (200 mg/mL) for each of the doses below, and infuse in sequence.

- 1. 150 mg/kg in 200 mL D5W over 1 hr.
- 2. 50 mg/kg in 500 mL D5W over 4 hrs.
- 3. 100 mg/kg in 1,000 mL D5W over 16 hrs.

Total Dose: 300 mg/kg over 21 hrs.

#### **2. NAC Stopping Criteria:**

- 1. Plasma acetaminophen <10 μg/mL.
- 2. AST/ALT normal for patient, or decreased by 25–50%.
- 3. INR <2.0.
- 4. Patient feeling well.
- a. If NAC stopping criteria are not satisfied, continue IV NAC at a rate of at least 6.25 mg/kg/hr.
- b. Recheck criteria every12–24 hrs, and continue NAC until criteria are satisfied.

NAC Regimen from Reference 2; NAC stopping criteria from Reference 14.

## *Oral Regimen*

There is an oral NAC regimen that is as effective as the IV regimen (15), but it is rarely used

because NAC has a very disagreeable taste (due to the sulfur content). The oral regimen is as follows:

- 1. Use 10% NAC, and dilute 2:1 in water to make a 5% solution (50 mg/mL).
- 2. Start with a dose of 140 mg/kg, and follow with a maintenance dose of 70 mg/kg every 4 hours for 72 hours.
- 3. The total dose is 1,330 mg/kg, administered over 72 hours.

There are no clear instructions on checking for improvement or extending the treatment period for oral NAC, as there is for intravenous NAC.

#### *Adverse Reactions*

Adverse reactions to intravenous NAC include nausea, vomiting, and cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions (rash, angioedema), which are more common in the first hour (when the NAC dose is the largest), and have a reported incidence that varies from 9% to 77% (16). Other IV regimens have been proposed that reduce the frequency of adverse reactions ([2,](#page-14-2)16), but the efficacy of these regimens is unclear.

## **Hemodialysis**

The elimination of acetaminophen is enhanced by hemodialysis, which is recommended, in addition to NAC, when the plasma acetaminophen concentration exceeds 900 μg/mL, and there is evidence of hepatic encephalopathy (14). During hemodialysis, the intravenous NAC dose should be at least 12.5 mg/kg/hr (because NAC can also be eliminated by dialysis). No dose adjustment is required for the oral NAC regimen.

## **Outcomes**

Most patients respond favorably to NAC, and the reported mortality rate in acetaminophen hepatotoxicity is 0.4% ([2\)](#page-14-2). However, an occasional patient will show progressive signs of hepatic injury despite NAC treatment, and these patients should be considered for liver transplantation.

## **BENZODIAZEPINES**

Benzodiazepines are second only to opiates as the drugs most frequently involved in medicationrelated deaths (17). However, benzodiazepines are rarely fatal when ingested alone (18), and other respiratory depressant drugs (e.g., opiates) are almost always involved in benzodiazepinerelated fatalities (17).

## **Clinical Features**

Because overdoses involving benzodiazepines also involve other drugs, the clinical presentation can vary (according to the drugs ingested). Pure benzodiazepine overdoses produce deep sedation but rarely result in coma (18). Respiratory depression (2–12% of cases), bradycardia (1– 2% of cases) and hypotension (5–7% of cases) are also uncommon (18). Benzodiazepine intoxication can also produce an agitated confusional state, with hallucinations, that could be

mistaken for alcohol withdrawal (18).

Involvement of benzodiazepines in an apparent overdose can be difficult to establish because there are no serum assays for benzodiazepines, and screening tests for benzodiazepines in urine can miss common agents like lorazepam (19). As a result, benzodiazepine involvement is usually based on the clinical history.

## **Management**

The management of benzodiazepine overdose involves general supportive care, including blood pressure support and mechanical ventilation, if needed. An antidote (flumazenil) is available, but is not popular.

## *Flumazenil*

Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine antagonist that binds to benzodiazepine receptors (GABA-A receptors), but has minimal agonist activity (20). It is effective in reversing benzodiazepineinduced sedation, but is inconsistent in reversing benzodiazepine-induced respiratory depression (21,22).

**DOSING REGIMEN:** Flumazenil is given as intravenous boluses of 0.2 mg that can be repeated every few minutes to a cumulative dose of 1.0 mg. The response is rapid, with onset in 1–2 minutes, and peak effect at 6–10 minutes (20). The effect lasts about one hour. Since flumazenil has a shorter duration of action than the benzodiazepines, sedation can return after 30–60 minutes. To reduce the risk of re-sedation, the initial dose of flumazenil can be followed by a continuous infusion at 0.3–0.4 mg/hr (23).

**ADVERSE REACTIONS:** Flumazenil has suffered from reports of frequent adverse effects, as shown in [Table](#page-7-0) 52.2. The data in this table represents the pooled results of 13 clinical trials that compared flumazenil to placebo in patients who presented to an emergency department with impaired consciousness from suspected benzodiazepine overdose (23). As indicated, the minor and major adverse events were significantly more frequent with flumazenil, but the major events (which included seizures) were infrequent, and were significantly different from placebo only at the p <0.05 level. *The issue that is not addressed in these studies is the benefit of awakening with flumazenil.*

<span id="page-7-0"></span>

| TABLE<br>52.2<br>Relative | Frequencies<br>of<br>Adverse<br>Events<br>with<br>Flumazenil |         |         |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|
|                           | Flumazenil                                                   | Placebo | p value |
| Number of Patients        | 498                                                          | 492     |         |
| †<br>Minor Adverse Events | 28%                                                          | 10%     | <0.001  |
| §<br>Major Adverse Events | 2.4%                                                         | 0.4%    | 0.02    |

<sup>†</sup>Most common minor events were agitation, nausea, and vomiting. §Most common major events were supraventricular arrhythmias and seizures. Data from Reference 23.

Because of the risks associated with flumazenil, it is not recommended for patients who present with coma of undetermined etiology, or for patients who have a history of seizures or

chronic benzodiazepine dependence. Its major use at the present time is for rapid awakening following procedural sedation.

## **Β-RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS**

Intentional β-blocker overdoses are uncommon, but can be life-threatening. An effective antidote is available, if needed.

## **Toxic Manifestations**

The typical manifestations of β-blocker overdose are *bradycardia* and *hypotension* (24). The bradycardia is usually sinus in origin, and is well tolerated. The hypotension can be due to peripheral vasodilation (renin blockade), or a decrease in cardiac output (negative inotropic effect), or both.

## *Membrane Stabilizing Effect*

Excessive doses of β-blockers can exert a membrane stabilizing effect that is independent of the β-receptor blockade, and can be life-threatening. The principal consequence is prolonged atrioventricular (AV) conduction, which can progress to complete heart block (25).

## *Neurotoxicity*

Most β-blockers are lipophilic, and have a tendency to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues like the central nervous system, where they can promote *lethargy, depressed consciousness,* and *generalized seizures*. The latter manifestation is more prevalent than suspected, and has been reported in 60% of overdoses with propranolol (26). The CNS effects of β-blockers are the result of the membrane stabilizing effect, and not β-receptor blockade.

## **Glucagon**

Glucagon is a regulatory hormone that acts in opposition to insulin by stimulating glycogen breakdown to raise blood glucose levels. In a seemingly unrelated role, glucagon antagonizes the cardiac depression produced by β-receptor antagonists.

#### *Mechanism of Action*

The illustration in [Figure](#page-9-0) 52.4 shows how glucagon can correct the cardiac depression caused by β-blockers and calcium channel blockers. The glucagon receptor and β-receptor are linked to the adenyl cyclase enzyme on the inner surface of the cell membrane. Activation of each receptorenzyme complex results in the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). The cyclic AMP then activates a protein kinase that promotes the inward movement of calcium through the cell membrane. The influx of calcium promotes interactions between contractile proteins to enhance the strength of cardiac contraction.

The sequence of reactions just described is responsible for the positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of β-receptor stimulation. Since the same reactions occur with activation of the glucagon receptor, *glucagon has cardiostimulatory effects that are not affected by β-receptor*

*blockade* (27). This allows glucagon to serve as an antidote for β-blocker overdoses.

#### *Clinical Use*

Glucagon is indicated for the treatment of hypotension and *symptomatic* bradycardia associated with toxic exposure to β-blockers. When used in the appropriate doses, glucagon will elicit a favorable response in 90% of patients (27). However, *glucagon will not reverse the prolonged AV conduction or neurological abnormalities in β-blocker overdoses* because these effects are not mediated by β-receptor blockade.

**CALCIUM ANTAGONIST TOXICITY:** Glucagon is also capable of antagonizing the effects of calcium channel blockers, as illustrated in [Figure](#page-9-0) 52.4. However, glucagon is less effective in reversing the cardiac depression in calcium channel blocker overdoses.

<span id="page-9-0"></span>![](_page_9_Figure_4.jpeg)

**FIGURE 52.4** Mechanisms of drug-induced alterations in cardiac contractile strength. See text for explanation.. Abbreviations: ATP = adenosine triphosphate, cAMP = cyclic adenosine monophosphate, PDE = phosphodiesterase, AMP= adenosine monophosphate.

## *Dosing Regimen*

Dosing recommendations for glucagon are as follows:

- 1. The effective dose of glucagon can vary in individual patients, but *a bolus dose of 3–5 mg IV should be effective in most adults* (26,28). The initial dose is usually 3 mg (or 0.05 mg/kg), and the response should be evident within 3 minutes (29).
- 2. If the response to the initial dose is not satisfactory, a second IV bolus dose of 5 mg (or 0.07 mg/kg) can be given.

- 3. The chronotropic response to glucagon is optimal when the plasma ionized calcium is normal (30).
- 4. The effects of glucagon can be short-lived (5 minutes), and so a favorable response should be followed by a continuous infusion (5 mg/hr).

## *Adverse Effects*

Nausea and vomiting that are refractory to ondansetron are common at glucagon doses above 5 mg/hr (27). Mild hyperglycemia is common, and is the result of glucagon's actions to stimulate glycogenolysis. The insulin response to the hyperglycemia can drive potassium into cells and promote hypokalemia. Finally, glucagon stimulates catecholamine release from the adrenal medulla, and this can cause unwanted increases in blood pressure in patients with hypertension (27).

## **Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors**

Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g., milrinone) augment cardiac contractile strength by inhibiting the breakdown of cyclic AMP, as illustrated in [Figure](#page-9-0) 52.4. These agents can increase cardiac output in the setting of β-blockade (31), and they should add to the increase in cyclic AMP produced by glucagon. However, it is unclear if phosphodiesterase inhibitors add to the effectiveness of glucagon in β-blocker toxicity. Because these drugs are vasodilators, and can produce unwanted decreases in blood pressure, they are generally reserved for the occasional case of β-blocker toxicity that does not respond to glucagon.

## **OPIOIDS**

The problem with opioid overdoses in the United States is certainly no secret, and most cases involve prescription opioids rather than street drugs (32). The adverse effects of opioids are described in Chapter 6, and this section focuses on the use of the narcotic antagonist, naloxone.

## **Clinical Features**

The classic "textbook" description of an opiate overdose is the patient with stupor, pinpoint pupils, and slow breathing (bradypnea), but in reality, it is not possible to identify an opiate overdose based on the clinical presentation or physical examination (33). The response to the narcotic antagonist, naloxone, is probably the most reliable method of identifying an opioid overdose.

#### **Naloxone**

Naloxone (Narcan®) is a pure opioid antagonist; i.e., it binds to endogenous opioid receptors, but does not elicit any opioid-like responses. It is most effective in blocking mu (µ) receptors, which are responsible for analgesia, euphoria, and respiratory depression (33). Naloxone can be given by intranasal spray or intravenous injection.

#### *Intranasal Naloxone*

The intranasal route is favored for naloxone administration because it is as effective as the

intravenous route (34), but is much easier to administer, and can be given in the field with minimal training.

- 1. Narcan is available as a single-dose nasal spray containing 2 mg or 4 mg naloxone hydrochloride in 0.1 mL of diluent (35). A single dose is delivered into one nostril.
- 2. The recommended dose is either 2 mg or 4 mg, but 2 mg is probably sufficient in most cases, since intranasal doses of 0.4 mg have been effective in clinical studies (34). If there is no response within 3 minutes after the initial dose, a second dose can be given in the other nostril. If the 4 mg dose of naloxone is used, it may be more effective if given in two divided (2 mg) doses in each nostril, as suggested by the plasma naloxone levels in Fig. [52.5](#page-11-0) (35).
- 3. The average response time to intranasal naloxone is about 3 minutes (34), and peak blood levels are reached after about 20 minutes (see Fig. [52.5\)](#page-11-0). The elimination half life is between 1.5 and 2 hours (35).
- 4. Intranasal naloxone is effective for reversing both the impaired consciousness and the respiratory depression caused by opioids (34,35). However, the opioid effects are likely to return after 1–2 hours, so a favorable response to naloxone should be followed by a continuous intravenous infusion, at an hourly dose that is two-thirds of the effective dose (diluted in 250 or 500 mL of isotonic saline and infused over 6 hours) (36).

<span id="page-11-0"></span>![](_page_11_Figure_5.jpeg)

**FIGURE 52.5** Plasma naloxone levels after intranasal naloxone in the doses indicated. Note that a dose of 4 mg results in higher plasma levels if the dose is divided, and 2 mg is administered in each nostril. Data from Reference 35.

#### *Intravenous Naloxone*

Despite the advantages of intranasal naloxone, intravenous naloxone continues to be the gold standard method for treating opioid overdoses in the hospital setting. The IV route provides greater bioavailability, and a quicker response time, than the intranasal route (34,37) (although the clinical relevance of these differences is unproven). However, the IV route is generally reserved for situations where the nasal spray is not immediately available.

- 1. For patients with a depressed sensorium but no respiratory depression, the initial dose of IV naloxone should be 0.4 mg. This can be repeated in 2 minutes, if necessary. A total dose of 0.8 mg should be effective if the mental status changes are caused by an opioid derivative (38).
- 2. Respiratory depression can be more difficult to reverse than depressed consciousness. The initial naloxone dose for respiratory depression should be 2 mg IV push (33). If there is no response in 2–3 minutes, double the dose to 4 mg. Further doses, if necessary, can be increased to 15 mg. If there is no response to a dose of 15 mg, then opioids are not the cause of the respiratory depression (33).
- 3. The reversal by IV naloxone lasts only about one hour, and opioid effects will return thereafter. Therefore, a favorable response to IV naloxone should be followed by a continuous infusion, using the dosing recommendations described for intranasal naloxone.

#### *Adverse Reactions*

Naloxone has few undesirable effects. The most common adverse effect is opioid withdrawal (39). There are also case reports of acute pulmonary edema associated with high-dose naloxone, which is attributed to pulmonary venoconstriction from activation of the sympathetic nervous system (39).

## **SALICYLATES**

Salicylate poisoning receives relatively little attention, but it is second only to acetaminophen poisoning as a cause of suicide-related deaths from over-the-counter analgesics (40). Ingestion of 10–30 grams, or 150 mg/kg, of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) can have fatal consequences.

## **Pathogenesis**

Once ingested, acetylsalicylic acid is converted to *salicylic acid*, which is the active form of the drug. Salicylic acid is readily absorbed from the upper GI tract, and metabolism takes place in the liver. *The hallmark of salicylate intoxication is the combination of a respiratory alkalosis and a metabolic acidosis with an elevated anion gap* (41).

## *Respiratory Alkalosis*

Salicylic acid directly stimulates the respiratory centers in the lower brainstem, producing an increase in respiratory rate and tidal volume, and a subsequent decrease in the arterial PCO<sup>2</sup> (i.e., acute respiratory alkalosis). This is one of the earliest signs of salicylate poisoning.

## *Metabolic Acidosis*

Salicylic acid is a weak acid that does not readily dissociate, and thus does not produce a metabolic acidosis. However, salicylic acid uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, which results in a compensatory increase in glycolysis (to generate ATP) and an increase in lactate production. The accumulation of lactic acid (and also ketoacids) results in a high anion-gap metabolic acidosis. This is a relatively late complication, and an acidemic pH is a poor prognostic sign (42).

#### *Other Features*

Salicylate-induced uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation results in an increased metabolic rate, which increases the body temperature and promotes diaphoresis and dehydration.

## **Clinical Manifestations**

The earliest signs of salicylate intoxication are hyperpnea, tinnitus, vertigo, nausea and vomiting, which can appear in the first few hours after a toxic ingestion. These can be followed by agitation and fever, and in severe cases, by coma, cerebral edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and hemodynamic instability (41). Laboratory studies can reveal hypocapnia and respiratory alkalosis, lactic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, hypernatremia (from dehydration) and acute kidney injury.

## **Diagnosis**

The plasma salicylate level is used to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of salicylate toxicity.

- 1. The therapeutic plasma salicylate level is 10–30 mg/dL (0.7–2.2 mmol/L).
- 2. Plasma salicylate levels above 40 mg/dL (2.9 mmol/L) are considered toxic, and levels above 75 mg/dL (5.4 mmol/L) are considered life-threatening (41).
- 3. Salicylate levels are often lower in cases of chronic salicylate toxicity.

## **Management**

Management of salicylate toxicity includes general supportive care (e.g., fluids, vasopressors, and mechanical ventilation), plus the following measures.

## *Activated Charcoal*

Because salicylates can slow gastric emptying, and enteric-coated or extended-release aspirin preparations can promote retention of the drug in the gastric lumen, activated charcoal is recommended for all salicylate intoxications, regardless of the time of drug ingestion (41). (However, activated charcoal is most effective if given within 2 hours of drug ingestion.) The dose is 1 g/kg to a maximum dose of 100 grams, which is repeated every 4 hours until the charcoal appears in the stool or the plasma salicylate levels begin to decrease (41).

#### *Alkalinization of the Urine*

Alkalinization of the urine increases salicylate excretion, and is one the cornerstones of management for salicylate intoxication. Bicarbonate infusions are used to raise the urine pH using the regimen in [Table](#page-14-5) 52.3 (42,43). This should be continued until the plasma salicylate

levels fall into the therapeutic range.

#### <span id="page-14-5"></span>**TABLE 52.3 Protocol for Alkalinization of the Urine**

- 1. Create a bicarbonate solution by adding 3 amps NaHCO<sup>3</sup> (44 mEq /amp) to 1 liter D5W (132 mEq/L). Add 40 mEq KCL.
- 2. Start with a bicarbonate loading dose of 1–2 mEq/kg.
- 3. Follow with infusion of the bicarbonate solution at 2–3 mL/kg/hr.
- 4. Maintain a urine output of 1–2 mL/kg/hr, and a urine pH ≥7.5.

**HYPOKALEMIA:** Bicarbonate infusions will lower the serum potassium (by driving K+ into cells), and hypokalemia hampers the ability to alkalinize the urine (by increasing the secretion of H+ into the lumen of the distal tubules). This provides a reason to add K+ (40 mEq) to the bicarbonate solution, as shown in [Table](#page-14-5) 52.3.

#### *Hemodialysis*

Hemodialysis is the most effective method of clearing salicylates from the body (41,44). The indications for hemodialysis include (41): (*a*) a plasma salicylate level >90 mg/dL (>6.5 mmol/L), (*b*) a salicylate level >80 mg/dL (>5.8 mmol/L) plus impaired renal function, or (*c*) evidence of life-threatening intoxication (e.g., cerebral edema, ARDS, multiorgan failure) (41).

## **A FINAL WORD**

## **Regulating Acetaminophen**

If any over-the-counter drug deserves to be regulated, it's acetaminophen. Not only because it is the leading cause of acute liver failure in North America, Europe, and Australia, but also because *half of the overdoses are unintentional* (i.e., the drug ingestion is for therapeutic reasons), indicating a general lack of awareness of the potential for harm with acetaminophen. The FDA issued a mandate for stronger warnings on drug packaging, but who reads that small print? Requiring a prescription that indicates how the drug should be used seems to be the right step for promoting the safe use of acetaminophen.

Acetaminophen gained its popularity in the 1970s because of concerns about the toxicity of aspirin, and it looks like we replaced a potentially toxic drug with a potentially lethal one.
