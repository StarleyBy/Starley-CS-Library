## **INTRODUCTION**

One of the most dramatic events in medical self-experimentation took place in a small German hospital during the summer of 1929, when an intrepid surgical resident named Werner Forssmann inserted a plastic urethral catheter into the basilic vein in his right arm and advanced the catheter into the right atrium of his heart [\(1](#page-19-1)). This was the first documented instance of a right-heart catheterization in a human subject, but Dr. Forssmann received no accolades, as he had acted in defiance of the senior surgical staff at his hospital. Instead, he was promptly dismissed from his residency for actions that were perceived as inappropriate and reckless. Upon dismissal, he was told that "such methods are good for a circus, but not for a respected hospital" ([1\)](#page-19-1). Dr. Forssmann went on to become a country doctor, but his achievement in vascular cannulation was finally recognized in 1956, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine.

Werner Forssmann's achievement was possible because he used a flexible plastic catheter that could safely follow the contours of the venous system as it was advanced. This was a departure from the traditional practice of cannulating blood vessels with rigid needles and metal cannulas, and it heralded the modern era of vascular cannulation, which employs a wide array of flexible plastic catheters like the ones described in this chapter.

# **CATHETER BASICS**

Vascular catheters are made of synthetic plastic polymers that are chemically inert, biocompatible, and resistant to chemical and thermal degradation. Catheters that are used for short-term cannulation (days to weeks) are typically made of *polyurethane*, a versatile polymer that is pliable, yet provides enough tensile strength to resist kinking during catheter insertion. (The elastic fibers used in stretchable clothing are made of polyurethane.) Catheters that are used

for long-term vascular access (months) are typically made of *silicone*, which is much more pliable than polyurethane (e.g., the nipple on baby bottles is made of silicone) and is less likely to cause vascular damage. Because of their pliability, silicone catheters are difficult to insert percutaneously, and are used primarily as implantable catheters (such as those used for long-term chemotherapy).

## **Catheter Size**

The size of vascular catheters is a reflection of the *outside diameter* of the catheter. There are two expressions of catheter size: gauge size and French size. The correlation between the two is shown in [Table](#page-2-0) 1.1.

#### *Gauge Size*

The gauge system was introduced (in England) for sizing solid iron wires, and was later adopted for hollow needles and catheters. Gauge size is a measure of how many wires (or catheters) can be placed side-by-side in a given space, and it varies inversely with outside diameter (OD); i.e., the higher the gauge size, the more catheters will fit in a given space, and thus the smaller the OD. Unfortunately, the actual OD for each gauge size is not standardized, and varies with each manufacturer. Gauge sizes are typically used for needles, small-bore single-lumen catheters, and the infusion channels in multilumen catheters; sizes typically range from 16 gauge (largest diameter) to 21 gauge (smallest diameter).

### *French Size*

The French system was introduced (guess where) for sizing hollow tubes (catheters), and it provides a more predictable measure than the gauge system. The French scale begins at zero, and each increment of one French unit represents an increase in OD of 0.33 millimeters ([2\)](#page-19-2): i.e.,

French size (Fr) 
$$\times$$
 0.33 = OD (mm). (1.1)

French sizes are used for multilumen catheters and large-bore single-lumen catheters; sizes typically range from 4 Fr (1.2 mm OD) to 9 Fr (3.2 mm OD). French sizing is also used for urinary catheters, nasogastric tubes, and pleural drainage tubes.

## **Flow Through Catheters**

The determinants of flow through narrow, rigid tubes (e.g., catheters) was first described by a German civil engineer (Gotthilf Hagen) and a French physician (Jean Marie Poiseuille), working independently in the mid-19th century. Their observations are expressed in the following equation, known as the *Hagen-Poiseuille equation* ([3\)](#page-19-3).

<span id="page-1-0"></span>
$$Q = \Delta P \times (\pi \, r^4 / 8\mu L). \tag{1.2}$$

This equation states that the steady or laminar flow rate (Q) in a rigid tube is directly related to the pressure gradient along the tube (∆P = Pin – Pout) and the fourth power of the radius of the tube (r4), and is inversely related to the length of the tube (L) and the viscosity of the fluid (µ). The term enclosed in parentheses is equivalent to the reciprocal of resistance (according to the relationship: Q = ∆P × 1/R), so the resistance to flow can be expressed as: R = 8µL/πr4.

### *Catheter Dimensions*

The Hagen-Poiseuille equation describes the influence of catheter dimensions on flow through the catheter. This is an important consideration because *the infusion rate of intravenous fluids is determined by the dimensions of the indwelling catheter, and not by the size of the cannulated vein*. The inner radius of the catheter has a profound influence on flow (because flow rate is directly related to the fourth power of the radius), and this is demonstrated in the bar graph on the left in [Figure](#page-3-0) 1.1 [\(4](#page-19-4)). In this case, the gravity-driven flow of water through a 16 gauge catheter was more than double the flow through an 18 gauge catheter, and was almost four times greater than the flow through a 20 gauge catheter (with all catheters being equal in length). The large difference in flow rates between 16 and 20 gauge catheters is associated with less than a one millimeter difference in outside diameter (see [Table](#page-2-0) 1.1), which highlights the importance of catheter diameter as a determinant of flow.

The Hagen-Poiseuille equation also shows that flow will vary in an opposite direction to changes in the length of a catheter; this is demonstrated in the graph on the right in [Figure](#page-3-0) 1.1 ([5\)](#page-19-5). Note that the transition from a two-inch catheter (a common length for peripheral vein catheters) to a six-inch catheter (a common length for central venous catheters) is associated with a 40% reduction in flow, and a further transition to a 12-inch catheter (an available length for central venous catheters) is associated with an additional 40% decline in flow.

The information just presented indicates that *when rapid volume infusion is needed, a largebore catheter is the appropriate choice, and a short, large-bore catheter is the optimal choice.*

### *Infusion Pressure*

The resistance to flow created by vascular catheters can be overcome by increasing the pressure gradient for flow (i.e., the ∆P in [Equation](#page-1-0) 1.2). In a gravity-driven infusion system, this is accomplished by increasing the height of the infusate container (bag or bottle) above the cannulation site: e.g., a height of 68 cm (27 inches) will create an infusion pressure of 50 mm Hg (or one pound per square inch, psi), and an increase in height to 100 cm (39 inches) will increase the infusion pressure to 75 mm Hg (1.5 psi) ([6\)](#page-19-6).

**INFUSION PUMPS:** Intravenous fluids and drugs are typically delivered at specific infusion (or dose) rates, and this control is achieved with programmable infusion pumps that adjust the infusion pressure (up to 15 psi) to deliver a preselected infusion (or dosage) rate. There are two types of infusions pumps: *volumetric pumps*, which can deliver one liter of fluid (from a bag or bottle) at flow rates of 0.1 to 1,000 mL/hr, and *syringe drivers* that operate with a lower volume (up to 100 mL) and deliver fluid at rates of 0.1 to 100 mL/hr [\(6](#page-19-6)). *Volumetric pumps* are generalpurpose devices that are used to deliver intravenous fluids and most intravenous drugs, while syringe pumps are popular for patient-controlled analgesia. There are also specialized infusion pumps for the resuscitation of massive hemorrhage. These devices deliver warmed fluids or blood products at rates of up to 1.5 L/min when combined with specialized "rapid infusion catheters" that are typically 7–8 French in diameter and 2–2.5 inches in length.

# **GENERAL-PURPOSE CATHETERS**

Intravenous catheters are classified as central or peripheral catheters based on the following simple distinction: central catheters extend into one of the vena cavae, and peripheral catheters do not. The following is a description of the peripheral and central catheters that are used in everyday patient care in the ICU. Catheters with a specialized function, like hemodialysis catheters and pulmonary artery catheters, are described elsewhere in the book. (Chapter 8 is devoted entirely to the pulmonary artery catheter.)

## **Peripheral Catheters**

Peripheral catheters are typically inserted into one of the veins in the upper extremity, and they do not extend beyond the shoulder. Three distinct types of peripheral catheter have been identified ([7,](#page-19-7)[8\)](#page-19-8): short peripheral catheters (<6 cm in length), long peripheral catheters (6 to <15 cm in length), and midline catheters (15 to 20 cm in length).

### *Short Peripheral Catheters*

The traditional method of cannulating peripheral veins involves a 16–22 gauge catheter that is 3– 5 cm (1–2 in) in length, and is placed in a visible or palpable vein (usually in the upper extremity) using a catheter-over-needle device like the one in [Figure](#page-4-0) 1.2. The tip of the catheter is recessed back from the tip of the introducer needle, and is tapered to prevent fraying as the catheter is advanced into the blood vessel. When the tip of the probe needle enters the vein, a "flashback" of blood appears in the clear hub of the needle. When this occurs, the catheter is advanced over the needle and into the lumen of the blood vessel.

Cannulation with short peripheral catheters is favored because it provides rapid vascular access (when a superficial vein is visible or palpable), although the initial cannulation attempt fails in about one-third of cases ([9\)](#page-19-9). The major disadvantage of short catheters is their limited "dwell time" (the time an indwelling catheter remains functional); the reported failure rate of these catheters is 40–60% within the first 3 days [\(8](#page-19-8)). Common causes of failure include localized phlebitis, catheter occlusion or dislodgement, and vascular perforation with extravasation of infused fluids. Short peripheral catheters are especially problematic in ICU patients, who are often agitated and prone to dislodging these catheters.

**FIGURE 1.2** A catheter-over-needle device used to cannulate superficial peripheral veins.

#### *Long Peripheral Catheters*

Long peripheral catheters (also known as "extended dwell catheters") are typically 8 cm (3.1 inches) in length, and were introduced to improve the stability and dwell time of the short peripheral catheters. Clinical studies have consistently shown a longer dwell time with the longer catheters (about 7–9 days) [\(10](#page-19-10)). Despite this advantage, long peripheral catheters have not been embraced (at least not in North America), possibly due to the growing popularity of midline catheters (see next).

#### *Midline Catheters*

Midline catheters are the longest of the peripheral vein catheters (15–20 cm in length), and are inserted into one of three deep veins above the antecubital fossa: the basilic, brachial, or cephalic veins (see [Figure](#page-6-0) 1.3). The basilic vein is preferred because it runs a direct course up the arm, and is not in close proximity to an artery or nerve (like the brachial vein). Because the major veins in the upper arm are deeply situated ultrasound guidance is used for midline catheter insertion (see later for a description of ultrasound guided cannulation). When properly placed and maintained, midline catheters can remain functional for weeks; e.g., in one clinical study, the average dwell time for midline catheters was 14 days ([11\)](#page-19-11). This same study also demonstrates that *vasopressors can be infused through midline catheters for as long as 7–8 days* without evidence of extravasation or limb compromise ([11\)](#page-19-11).

The extended dwell time of midline catheters have made them a popular choice when more than a few days of venous access is anticipated. In fact, midline catheters are now considered a safer alternative to the much longer "peripherally inserted central catheters" or PICCS (described in the next section), which have traditionally been favored for prolonged venous access. Comparative studies have shown that midline catheters have a lower incidence of catheter occlusions and catheter-related bloodstream infections than PICCs [\(12](#page-19-12)). Although there is a slightly higher risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with midline catheters, the incidence of DVT with midline catheters is low (<5%), and the difference between midlines and PICCs is small (<2%) ([13\)](#page-19-13).

Midline catheters are available in lengths of 15 cm and 20 cm, and can have one to three infusion channels. The double-lumen catheter that is 15 cm in length is a popular choice, and some features of this catheter are included in [Table](#page-6-1) 1.2. Note that the increased length of the midline catheter is accompanied by a decrease in flow capacity; in this case, the gravity-driven flow rate in each lumen of the midline catheter is only about 20% of the flow rate in the short peripheral catheter. Despite this flow decrement, the gravity-driven flow capacity in the midline catheter still exceeds the maximum flow provided by volumetric infusion pumps (i.e., 1 L/hr).

## **Central Catheters**

As mentioned earlier, central vein catheters have a tip in one of the vena cavae. There are two types of central catheters, based on the location of the insertion site: *peripherally inserted central catheters* (PICCs) are inserted into one of the veins in the upper arm, while *centrally inserted central catheters* (commonly known as *central venous catheters*) are inserted into one of the major veins near the thoracic inlet, or in the groin.

### *Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters*

Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are essentially a longer version of the midline catheters: i.e., they are inserted via the same veins as the midline catheters, but are long enough to be advanced into the superior vena cava. These catheters have been popularized as a safer alternative to central venous catheters when peripheral vein cannulation is problematic, or when more than one week of vascular access is anticipated ([14\)](#page-19-14). However, the emergence of midline catheters as a safer alternative to PICCs has led to a steady decline in the popularity of PICCs in hospitalized patients.

PICCs are available in lengths ranging from 40 cm to 55 cm, and can have one to three infusion channels. A popular choice is the double-lumen PICC that is 50 cm in length, and some features of this catheter are shown in [Table](#page-7-0) 1.3. Note that the extended length of the PICC results in a marked decrease in flow capacity: e.g., the PICC in [Table](#page-7-0) 1.3 is more than three times the length of the midline catheter in [Table](#page-6-1) 1.2, and the resulting flow capacity is only 20% of that in the midline catheter. The compromised flow capacity in PICCs may explain the relatively high incidence of occlusions in these catheters [\(12](#page-19-12)).

### *Central Venous Catheters*

<span id="page-7-0"></span>Central venous catheters (CVCs) have played a prominent role in providing both secure and multifunctional venous access in critically ill patients. (The insertion of CVCs is described in detail in the next chapter.) These catheters are available in lengths of 15 cm, 20 cm, and 30 cm, and can have as many as 4 infusion channels. The most popular CVC is a triple-lumen catheter like the one shown in [Figure](#page-8-0) 1.4. Note that the distal lumen has a larger bore (16 gauge) than the proximal or medial lumens (18 gauge); as a result, the flow capacity in the distal lumen is more than double that in the other lumens, as indicated in [Table](#page-7-0) 1.3. For this reason, the distal lumen of a CVC is best suited for rapid volume infusions.

| Catheter             | Size   | Length           | Lumens                                               | Flow (L/hr) <sup>†</sup> |
|----------------------|--------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Triple Lumen<br>CVC  | 7 Fr   | 20 cm<br>(8 in)  | Distal (16 ga)<br>Medial (18 ga)<br>Proximal (18 ga) | 2.28<br>0.91<br>0.99     |
| Double Lumen<br>PICC | 5.5 Fr | 50 cm<br>(20 in) | Distal (18 ga)<br>Proximal (18 ga)                   | 0.26<br>0.27             |

**FIGURE 1.4** A triple-lumen central venous catheter, showing the gauge size of each lumen and the position of the outflow ports at the distal end of the catheter. This is currently the most popular design for central venous catheters.

The insertion of CVCs has been a staple of patient care in ICUs, but the popularity of CVCs is waning, as safer alternatives (i.e., PICCs and midline catheters) have emerged. (For more on the insertion of CVCs, see Chapter 2.)

## **The Guidewire**

Cannulation of all but the most superficial, palpable veins is accomplished by advancing the catheter over a guidewire that is placed in the lumen of the vein. This technique of guidewireassisted vascular cannulation, first introduced by a Swedish angiographer named Sven-Ibar Seldinger (and known as the *Seldinger technique*) [\(15](#page-19-15)), is illustrated in [Figure](#page-10-0) 1.5. A small bore needle is used to probe for the target vessel. When

the tip of the needle enters the vessel, a thin wire with a flexible tip is passed through the needle and into lumen of the blood vessel. (The flexible tip reduces the risk of en dothelial injury as the guidewire is advanced.) The needle is then withdrawn over the guidewire, and the catheter is advanced over the guidewire and into the lumen of the blood vessel. (In actual practice, a "dilator catheter" is first threaded over the guidewire to create a tract that facilitates catheter insertion.)

## **Summation**

The advantages and disadvantages of general-purpose vascular catheters are summarized in [Table](#page-10-1) 1.4. The following is a brief summary of how these catheters are used for patient care in the ICU. Short peripheral catheters are preferred for quick intravenous (IV) access at the outset, but in patients who spend more than a few days in the ICU, more stable IV access is needed. This has been traditionally supplied by CVCs, but over the past decades, PICCs began to replace CVCs for longer-term IV access. More recently, midline catheters have emerged as an acceptable choice for longer-term IV access, and they are replacing CVCs and PICCS for this purpose. However, PICCS continue to be popular for patients who require extended (several weeks) IV therapy. The major drawback of midline catheters and PICCs is the use of specially trained teams to insert the catheters; this limits the availability of these catheters.

Central venous catheters are the final (go-to) catheters for stable venous access, and are especially preferred in patients with life-threatening hemodynamic instability.

## **VASCULAR ULTRASOUND**

The emergence of real-time ultrasound to guide vascular cannulation has added considerably to the success rate and safety of cannulating both central and peripheral veins [\(16](#page-19-16)[,17](#page-19-17)). The following is a brief introduction to the methodology.

### **The Method**

Vascular ultrasound uses linear array probes that emit high-frequency ultrasound waves (5–15 MHz); this produces high-resolution images, but limits the depth of tissue penetration (to about 9 cm). The waves that are reflected back to the probe (called *echoes*) are processed by a transducer that converts the ultrasound waves to gray scale images. Higher amplitude echoes produce brighter or whiter images, while lower amplitude echoes produce darker or blacker images. This methodology is known as B-mode (brightness-mode) ultrasound, and it produces twodimensional, gray-scale images. Ultrasound waves pass readily through fluids, so blood vessels will have a dark gray or black interior on the ultrasound image.

## **Orientation of the Beam**

The ultrasound beam can be aligned along the long axis of a blood vessel to produce a sagittal image of the vessel (long-axis view), or it can be oriented to transect a blood vessel, which produces a [cross-sectional](#page-12-0) view of the vessel (short-axis view). This is demonstrated in Figure 1.6. Note that in the long-axis view, the probe needle advances along the plane of the ultrasound beam, and can be visualized along its entire path, while in the short-axis view, the probe needle does not meet the ultrasound beam until it reaches the target vessel, where it is visible only as a high-intensity dot on the ultrasound image.

### *Which View is Better?*

Neither view is clearly superior to the other, and each has advantages and disadvantages. The advantage of the short axis view is greater ease in locating the target vein, and the ability to visualize both the vein and its affiliated artery (which reduces the risk of arterial puncture), while the disadvantage is the limited ability to view the probe needle. The long axis view allows visualization of the probe needle, guidewire, and catheter during the cannulation, but is unable to visualize an affiliated artery, and requires a vein that runs a relatively straight course.

At the present time, the short-axis view seems to be the preferred one for locating the target vessel and confirming puncture of the vessel with the probe needle. The long-axis view is preferred for confirming intraluminal placement of the guidewire and catheter (see next).

## **Protocol**

The recommended protocol for ultrasound-guided vascular cannulation includes the following sequential steps [\(16](#page-19-16)): a) identify the target vein, b) verify puncture of the vein by the probe needle, and c) confirm intraluminal placement of the guidewire and catheter.

#### *Distinguishing Veins from Arteries*

There are two methods for distinguishing arteries from veins using ultrasonography. The easiest (and most popular) method is to determine the compressibility of the blood vessel; i.e., when pressure is applied to the skin overlying a blood vessel, a vein will collapse much more readily than an artery. This is demonstrated in [Figure](#page-13-0) 1.7, which shows an internal jugular vein that is compressed by pressing down on the overlying skin, while the nearby carotid artery is unaffected. (*Note:* One exception to this behavior is the presence of venous thrombosis, because a vein that is filled with a thrombus will not be compressible).

The other method for identifying arteries and veins is color Doppler imaging, where the frequency shift produced by the direction of blood flow (the Doppler effect) is converted into color images, and superimposed on the gray-scale ultrasound image [\(18](#page-19-18)). An example of this is shown in [Figure](#page-13-1) 1.8, with the red color marking the femoral artery and the blue color marking the femoral vein. These colors are not specific for arteries and veins, but instead represent the direction of blood flow in relation to the ultrasound probe. (The color assignments are indicated on the color legend in [Fig.](#page-13-1) 1.8.)

#### *The Probe Needle*

Advancing the probe needle to puncture the target vein is easily visualized in the long-axis view, as shown in [Figure](#page-12-0) 1.6. In the short-axis view, the probe needle is advanced using short, stabbing thrusts to produce tissue displacement, which marks the path of the needle, and puncture of the target vein is verified by observing a high-intensity dot in the lumen of the vessel, as shown in [Figure](#page-12-0) 1.6.

#### *Confirming Catheter Placement*

Veins tend to collapse when punctured, creating a tendency for probe needles to puncture the posterior wall of the vein. In one study, posterior wall perforation occurred in 40% of ultrasoundguided cannulations using the short-axis view, and 18% of cannulations using the long-axis view ([19\)](#page-19-19). Because of this risk (and the popularity of the short-axis view), it is important to confirm that the catheter has been placed in the lumen of the blood vessel. This begins by confirmating that the guidewire has been advanced into the vessel lumen, as shown on the left in [Figure](#page-13-2) 1.9 ([16\)](#page-19-16). The catheter can then be advanced over the guidewire, and the intraluminal placement of the catheter is then confirmed, as shown on the right in [Figure](#page-13-2) 1.9.

## **INTRAOSSEOUS VASCULAR ACCESS**

The discovery that fluids could be infused into the marrow cavity of bones and reach the systemic circulation occurred in the mid-1930s. However, this observation gained little attention until the London bombings during World War II, when the poor lighting from the frequent citywide blackouts created difficulties in establishing venous access, and an enterprising surgeon named Hamilton Bailey began infusing fluids into the marrow cavity of the sternum to resuscitate bombing victims ([20\)](#page-19-20). Despite early enthusiasm, the intraosseous (IO) route was relegated to obscurity when plastic catheters were introduced for intravenous cannulation (in the 1950s). A rebirth of the IO route occurred in the 1980s, when it was adopted for pediatric resuscitation, and it has subsequently gained favor in adults as an alternative route for emergency

vascular access.

## **Indications**

The principal indication for IO access is the need for emergent vascular access when intravenous (IV) access is problematic, or is not immediately available. This scenario is most likely to occur in patients with cardiac arrest, major trauma, or circulatory shock; in each of these conditions, IO access has proven to be a viable alternative to IV access ([21](#page-19-21)[−23](#page-19-22)). One appealing feature of the IO route is the rigid structure of the medullary cavity and its drainage system, which (unlike veins) will not collapse in the setting of hypotension, hypovolemia, or cardiovascular collapse.

Acceptance of the IO route is demonstrated in the most recent guidelines on advanced life support from the American Heart Association, which recommends proceeding to IO access when an initial attempt at IV access is unsuccessful, or IV access is not feasible ([21\)](#page-19-21). Since about twothirds of cases of cardiac arrest occur outside the hospital [\(24](#page-19-23)), the need for IO access occurs primarily in the field. As a result, prehospital personnel (emergency medical technicians and paramedics) have been the major focus of training for IO access, and the success rate in the field is as high as 97% (25). IO access in the field is also important for the early management of major trauma ([22\)](#page-19-24), including combat casualties (25), and IO access is included in the knowledge base for Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) certification from the American College of Surgeons (26).

### *Contraindications*

Contraindications to IO access include a fractured or previously entered bone (because of possible leakage of infused fluids), vascular injury in the target extremity, and burn injury, cellulitis, or osteomyelitis at the cannulation site. Osteopetrosis (abnormally dense bone) is also a contraindication ([23\)](#page-19-22), but is a rare condition.

## **Establishing IO Access**

There are two popular sites for IO access in adults: the proximal tibia (just below the knee), and the proximal humerus (just below the shoulder). The proximal tibia has two advantages: a higher success rate (25,27), and a location that does not interfere with intubation or chest compressions. The proximal humerus has the advantage of a higher flow capacity (28), but the proximal tibia is the favored site in adults.

### *The Proximal Tibia Site*

The access site in the proximal tibia is on a flat surface of bone just below the medial condyle (see [Figure](#page-17-0) 1.10). The point of needle insertion is 3 cm below the inferior tip of the patella, and 2 cm medial to that point.

## *Inserting the Needle*

Inserting the IO needle can be done manually, but a powered "needle driver" is preferred. A popular choice in recent years is a battery-powered device like the one shown in [Figure](#page-17-0) 1.10 (28,29). There are three different IO needles that attach to this device: each is a 15 gauge needle, available in lengths of 15 mm (for children), 25 mm (for average-sized adults), and 45 mm (for large or obese adults). The appropriate length for an individual patient can be determined by first

advancing a probe needle until it hits the bone. (In awake patients, the probe needle should also be used to inject lidocaine locally, especially at the level of the periosteum, which is well endowed with pain fibers.) The IO needles have horizontal markers, and the measured distance from the skin to the periosteum should leave the horizontal marker closest to the hub of the needle at or slightly above the skin surface.

After appropriate skin antisepsis (sterile gloves are not required for inserting IO needles), the IO needle is advanced manually until it hits the bony surface of the tibia. The needle driver is then attached and, with the needle at an angle of 90° from the skin surface, the needle driver is engaged. This will spin the needle in a clockwise direction, and the needle is then advanced while applying downward pressure, until a sudden loss of resistance indicates entry into the medullary cavity. This should be verified by the aspiration of blood. This is not always possible, because bone marrow is viscous (like a jelly), which can prevent the aspiration of blood. Flushing the needle with 5–10 mL of saline can liquify enough marrow to correct this problem.

<span id="page-17-0"></span>![](_page_17_Figure_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 1.10** Illustration depicting the insertion of an intraosseous needle into the proximal femur, of the right leg and the surface measurements used to identify the insertion point. A battery powered needle driver is used to advance the needle into the marrow cavity. See text for further explanation.

#### *Pre-Infusion Pain Control*

The infusion of fluids into the marrow cavity is painful, presumably from stretching the periosteum. Therefore in awake patients, lidocaine injection into the medullary cavity is advised prior to infusing fluids. The recommended protocol is as follows ([23,](#page-19-22)30):

- 1. Use a 2% solution (20 mg/mL) of preservative-free lidocaine for intravenous use, and inject 40 mg (2 mL) into the marrow cavity over 2 minutes.
- 2. Allow lidocaine to dwell for one minute, then flush with 10 mL of saline.
- 3. Start the desired IO infusion. If pain relief is incomplete, readminister lidocaine at half the

initial dose (20 mg) over one minute.

The lidocaine effect may be lost after one hour, and additional analgesia may be necessary. Intraosseous fentanyl (in the usual IV doses) can be used for this purpose.

## **IO Infusions**

Intraosseous infusions are relatively sluggish, with flow rates that are about 25% of peripheral vein infusions ([22,](#page-19-24)[23\)](#page-19-22). This is due to the viscous nature of bone marrow, and the relatively high pressure in the marrow cavity (which averages about 30 mm Hg). To counter the sluggish flow rates, IO infusions are routinely pressurized (with infusion pumps or inflatable pressure bags). However, pressures of 300 mm Hg or even higher may be inadequate for replacing massive blood loss, and dual IO infusions have been advocated by some in this situation [\(22](#page-19-24)).

Intraosseous access is considered a temporary intervention, and IO infusions are not recommended for longer than 24 hours (26). (There is, however, no firm evidence to validate this recommendation.) When IO infusions are discontinued, the IO needle is removed by attaching a luer-lock syringe and slowly rotating the needle in a clockwise direction as it is pulled upward at a 90° angle with the skin surface. (Rocking the needle back and forth to facilitate removal is not advised, and will promote leakage from the bone.)

## **Complications**

Complications of IO access are infrequent (possibly due to its limited lifespan), with several studies showing complication rates below 1% ([22,](#page-19-24)[23\)](#page-19-22). Potential complications include skin abscesses, osteomyelitis, tibial fracture, compartment syndrome, and fat or marrow emboli ([22,](#page-19-24)[23,](#page-19-22)30,31).

# **A FINAL WORD**

One of the rarest sights in any ICU is a patient with no intravenous access. While this may not be a revelation, it does indicate that a working knowledge of vascular access has universal relevance for patient care in the ICU. This chapter is a first step in acquiring that knowledge. The following points in the chapter deserve emphasis.

- 1. Infusion rates are influenced by the dimension of a vascular catheter, not by the size of the cannulated vein.
- 2. The radius (lumen size) of a catheter has a much greater influence on flow than the length of the catheter. For rapid infusions, a large bore catheter is desirable, and a short, large-bore catheter is optimal.
- 3. Midline catheters (15 20 cm catheters inserted into one of the major veins above the antecubital fossa) have become a popular choice for extended venous access, and can be used for prolonged vasopressor infusions.
- 4. Real-time ultrasonography has become an essential tool for cannulating veins that are not visible or palpable.

5. The intraosseous (IO) route is recommended for emergency vascular access when intravenous access is problematic, or not immediately available. The proximal femur is a popular site for IO access because the procedure does not interfere with intubation or chest compressions.
