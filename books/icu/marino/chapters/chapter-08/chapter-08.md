# **The Pulmonary Artery Catheter**

*A searchlight cannot be used effectively without a fairly thorough knowledge of the territory to be searched.*

Fergus Macartney (*[a](#page-15-0)*)

In 1970, a vascular catheter was introduced that would revolutionize the practice of bedside hemodynamic monitoring [\(1](#page-15-1)). It was a very long, centrally-placed catheter with a small inflatable balloon at its distal end. When inflated, the balloon allowed the flow of venous blood to carry the catheter through the right side of the heart and into one of the pulmonary arteries (like floating down a river on an inflatable inner tube). This balloon flotation effect allowed a right heart catheterization to be performed at the bedside, without the need for fluoroscopic guidance. An added bonus was a temperature-sensitive thermistor on the catheter, which allowed measurements of cardiac output using the *thermodilution* technique. When used appropriately, this *pulmonary artery balloon flotation catheter* could generate a comprehensive set of physiological measurements for evaluating cardiac performance and systemic oxygen transport ([2\)](#page-15-2).

Not surprisingly, the pulmonary artery (PA) catheter gained rapid and widespread acceptance, and became a staple of critical care management in the latter years of the twentieth century. However, storm clouds appeared in the early years of the twenty-first century, when a series of (poorly designed) clinical studies showed that PA catheters did not improve survival ([3\)](#page-15-3). The fallout from these studies was a swift and precipitous decline in the use of PA catheters; e.g., one large survey showed a 70% decrease in PA catheter use over the years from 1999 to 2013 ([4\)](#page-15-4).

The PA catheter's fall from grace is undeserved (see A FINAL WORD at the end of the chapter), as this catheter provides a wealth of information that can be useful if applied appropriately ([5,](#page-15-5)[6\)](#page-15-6). The goal of this chapter is to introduce you to these measurements, and how they are obtained. As suggested in the introductory quote, the benefit derived from the PA catheter will depend on your knowledge of cardiovascular physiology.

# **THE CATHETER**

The basic features of a PA catheter are shown in [Figure](#page-1-0) 8.1. The catheter is 110 cm long and has an outside diameter of 2.3 mm (about 7 French). There are two internal channels: one channel emerges at the tip of the catheter (the distal or PA lumen), and the other channel emerges 30 cm proximal to the catheter tip (the proximal or RA lumen), which should be situated in the right atrium. The tip of the catheter has a small inflatable balloon (1.5 mL capacity) that helps to carry the catheter to its final destination. When the balloon is fully inflated, it creates a recess for the tip of the catheter that prevents the tip from scraping along the vessel wall as the catheter is advanced. A small thermistor (a temperature-sensing transducer) is placed near the tip of the catheter, and is used to measure the cardiac output using the thermodilution technique (described later in the chapter).

**FIGURE 8.1** The basic features of a pulmonary artery (PA) catheter. Note that the PA catheter has been threaded through a large-bore introducer catheter that has a side-arm infusion port.

## **Catheter Placement**

The PA catheter is inserted through a large bore (8–9 French) introducer sheath that has been placed in the subclavian vein or internal jugular vein (see [Figure](#page-1-0) 8.1). The distal lumen of the catheter is attached to a pressure transducer to monitor vascular pressures as the catheter is advanced. When the catheter is passed through the introducer sheath and enters the superior vena cava, a venous pressure waveform appears. When this occurs, the balloon is inflated with 1.5 mL of air, and the catheter is advanced with the balloon inflated. The location of the catheter tip is

determined by the pressure tracings recorded from the distal lumen, as shown in [Figure](#page-3-0) 8.2.

- 1. The superior vena cava pressure is identified by a venous pressure waveform, which appears as small amplitude oscillations. This pressure remains unchanged until the catheter enters the right ventricle, and it represents the mean pressure in the right atrium, more commonly known as the *central venous pressure*.
- 2. When the catheter tip is advanced across the tricuspid valve and into the right ventricle, a pulsatile waveform appears. The peak (systolic) pressure is a function of the strength of right ventricular contraction, and the lowest (diastolic) pressure is equivalent to the mean right atrial pressure.
- 3. When the catheter moves across the pulmonic valve and into a main pulmonary artery, the pressure waveform shows a sudden rise in diastolic pressure with no change in the systolic pressure. (*Note:* The systolic pressure will increase in the presence of pulmonary hypertension). The rise in diastolic pressure is caused by resistance to flow in the pulmonary circulation.
- 4. As the catheter is advanced along the pulmonary artery, the pulsatile waveform disappears, leaving a nonpulsatile pressure that is normally at the same level as the diastolic pressure of the pulsatile waveform. This is the *pulmonary artery occlusion pressure*, more commonly known as the *wedge pressure*, and is a reflection of the filling pressure on the left side of the heart (see the next section).
- 5. When the wedge pressure tracing appears, the balloon is deflated, and the pulsatile pressure waveform should reappear. The catheter is then secured in place, and the balloon is left deflated. (*Note:* Prolonged balloon inflation creates the risk of pulmonary artery rupture or pulmonary infarction.)
- 6. On occasion, the pulsatile pressure in the pulmonary arteries never disappears despite advancing the catheter maximally. In this situation, the pulmonary artery diastolic pressure can be used as a surrogate measure of the wedge pressure, but only if there is no evidence of pulmonary hypertension (see next section).

**FIGURE 8.2** The pressure waveforms at different points along the normal course of a pulmonary artery catheter. These waveforms are used to identify the location of the catheter tip as it is advanced.

# **THE WEDGE PRESSURE**

The wedge pressure is obtained by slowly inflating the balloon at the tip of the PA catheter until the pulsatile pressure disappears, as shown in [Figure](#page-4-0) 8.3. Note that the wedge pressure is at the same level as the diastolic pressure in the pulmonary artery. This relationship is altered in pulmonary hypertension, where the wedge pressure is lower than the pulmonary artery diastolic pressure.

# **Wedge Pressure Tracing**

The wedge pressure represents the venous pressure on the left side of the heart, and the magnified section of the wedge pressure in [Figure](#page-4-0) 8.3 shows a contour that is similar to the venous pressure on the right side of the heart. The *a* wave is produced by left atrial contraction, the *c* wave is produced by closure of the mitral valve (during isometric contraction of the left ventricle), and the *v* wave is produced by systolic contraction of the left ventricle against a closed mitral valve. These components are often difficult to distinguish, but prominent *v* waves are readily apparent in patients with mitral regurgitation.

<span id="page-4-0"></span>![](_page_4_Figure_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 8.3** Pressure tracing showing the transition from a pulsatile pulmonary artery pressure to a balloon occlusion (wedge) pressure. The magnified area shows the components of the wedge pressure: *a* wave (atrial contraction), *c* wave (mitral valve closure), and *v* wave (ventricular contraction).

# **Wedge Pressure Principle**

The underlying principle for the wedge pressure is illustrated in [Figure](#page-5-0) 8.4. When the balloon on the PA catheter is inflated to obstruct flow (Q = 0), there is a static column of blood between the tip of the catheter and the left atrium, and the wedge pressure at the tip of the catheter (PW) is equivalent to the pulmonary capillary pressure (PC) and the pressure in the left atrium (PLA). To summarize: if Q = 0, then PW = PC = PLA. If the mitral valve is behaving normally, the wedge pressure (left atrial pressure) will be equivalent to the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Therefore, *in the absence of mitral valve disease, the wedge pressure is a measure of the filling pressure of the left ventricle*.

# *Respiratory Variations*

The wedge pressure is a reflection of the left atrial pressure only if the pulmonary capillary pressure is greater than the alveolar pressure (PC > PA in [Figure](#page-5-0) 8.4), otherwise the wedge pressure will reflect the alveolar pressure. This latter condition occurs when there are respiratory variations in the wedge pressure tracing [\(7](#page-15-7)). When this occurs, the wedge pressure should be measured at the end of expiration, as explained next.

<span id="page-5-0"></span>![](_page_5_Figure_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 8.4** The basis of the wedge pressure measurement. When flow ceases because of balloon inflation (Q = 0), the wedge pressure (PW) is equivalent to the pulmonary capillary pressure (PC) and the pressure in the left atrium (PLA). This occurs only when the pulmonary capillary pressure is greater than the alveolar pressure (PC > PA).

Changes in intrathoracic pressure can be transmitted into intrathoracic blood vessels (usually low pressure vessels like veins and capillaries), and this creates respiratory variations in the recorded pressure. This is illustrated in [Figure](#page-6-0) 8.5 for a central venous pressure (CVP) tracing. The undulating pattern in the recorded (intravascular) pressure is misleading, because the physiologically important (transmural) pressure is not changing. When this occurs, *the pressure should be measured at the end of expiration, when the intrathoracic pressure is zero (i.e., atmospheric pressure) and the intravascular and transmural pressures are equivalent*. The pressure tracing in [Figure](#page-6-0) 8.5 was recorded during positive pressure mechanical ventilation, so the end-expiratory pressure is the lowest point in each of the pressure undulations. (If this tracing was obtained during spontaneous breathing, the end-expiratory pressure would be the peak pressure for each respiratory cycle.)

**POSITIVE END-EXPIRATORY PRESSURE:** Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) can falsely elevate the wedge pressure (and CVP) at end-expiration because the intrathoracic pressure is higher than atmospheric (zero) pressure. When PEEP is applied during mechanical ventilation (which is a routine practice), the patient can be briefly disconnected from the ventilator to measure the wedge pressure ([8\)](#page-15-8). For patients with "intrinsic PEEP" (caused by incomplete emptying of the lungs), accurate measurements of the wedge pressure can be difficult ([9\)](#page-15-9). Chapter 29 includes a description of intrinsic PEEP and a method for correcting the wedge pressure in the presence of intrinsic PEEP.

<span id="page-6-0"></span>![](_page_6_Figure_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 8.5** Respiratory variation in the central venous pressure (CVP) during mechanical ventilation. The CVP should be measured at the end of expiration, which corresponds to the lowest points in the pressure undulations. See text for further explanation.

### *Spontaneous Variations*

In addition to respiratory variations, the wedge pressures can vary spontaneously. This variation in wedge pressure is ≤4 mm Hg in 60% of patients, but it can be as high as 7 mm Hg ([10\)](#page-15-10). In general, *a change in the wedge pressure of >4 mm Hg is considered a clinically significant change*.

# **Wedge vs Hydrostatic Pressure**

The wedge pressure is often mistaken as the hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary capillaries. However, this is not the case ([11,](#page-15-11)12), because the wedge pressure is measured in the absence of blood flow. When the balloon is deflated and flow resumes, the pressure in the pulmonary capillaries (PC) will be higher than the pressure in the left atrium (PLA), and the difference in pressures will dependent on the flow rate (Q) and the resistance to flow in the pulmonary veins (RV); i.e.,

$$PC - PLA = Q \times RV \tag{8.1}$$

Since the wedge pressure (PW) is equivalent to left atrial pressure (PLA), Equation (8.1) can be restated as:

$$PC - PW = Q \times RV \tag{8.2}$$

*Therefore, the capillary hydrostatic pressure must be greater than the wedge pressure to create a pressure gradient for venous flow to the left side of the heart*. The magnitude of this difference is unclear because it is not possible to determine the resistance to flow in the pulmonary veins (RV). However, the PC – PW difference will be magnified by conditions that promote pulmonary venoconstriction, such as hypoxemia, endotoxemia, vasopressor infusions, and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (13,14).

# *Wedge Pressure in ARDS*

The wedge pressure has been used to differentiate hydrostatic (cardiogenic) pulmonary edema from the leaky-capillary pulmonary edema that characterizes the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); i.e., a normal wedge pressure is considered evidence of ARDS (15). However, since the capillary hydrostatic pressure is normally higher than the wedge pressure, and this difference is magnified in ARDS (14), *a normal wedge pressure does not exclude the*

*diagnosis of hydrostatic pulmonary edema*. Therefore, the use of a normal wedge pressure as a diagnostic criterion for ARDS should be abandoned.

# **THERMODILUTION CARDIAC OUTPUT**

The presence of a temperature-sensitive thermistor on the PA catheter allows a measurement of the cardiac output by the thermodilution technique. This is considered the gold standard method for measuring cardiac output at the bedside.

# **The Method**

The indicator dilution method of measuring blood flow is based on the premise that, when an indicator substance is added to circulating blood, the rate of blood flow is inversely proportional to the change in concentration of the indicator over time. The thermodilution method employs temperature as the indicator.

The thermodilution method is illustrated in [Figure](#page-8-0) 8.6. A bolus (usually 10 mL) of a saline solution that is colder than blood is injected through the proximal port of the catheter in the right atrium. The cold fluid mixes with blood in the right heart chambers, and the cooled blood is ejected into the pulmonary artery and flows past the thermistor on the distal end of the catheter. The thermistor records the change in blood temperature with time. The area under this curve is inversely proportional to flow rate in the pulmonary artery, which is equivalent to the cardiac output (in the absence of intracardiac shunts). Electronic PA monitors integrate the area under the temperature–time curves and provide a digital display of the cardiac output.

#### *Thermodilution Curves*

Examples of thermodilution curves are shown in [Figure](#page-9-0) 8.7. The low cardiac output curve (upper panel) has a gradual rise and fall, whereas the high output curve (middle panel) has a rapid rise, an abbreviated peak, and a steep downslope. Note that the area under the low cardiac output curve is greater than the area under the high output curve (i.e., indicating that the area under these curves is inversely related to the flow rate).

<span id="page-8-0"></span>![](_page_8_Picture_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 8.6** The thermodilution method of measuring cardiac output. See text for explanation.

<span id="page-9-0"></span>![](_page_9_Figure_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 8.7** Thermodilution curves for a low cardiac output (upper panel), a high cardiac output (middle panel), and tricuspid insufficiency (lower panel). The sharp inflection in each curve marks the end of the measurement period. CO = cardiac output.

#### *How Many Measurements?*

Serial measurements are recommended for each cardiac output determination. Three measurements are sufficient if they differ by 10% or less, and the cardiac output is taken as the average of all measurements. Serial measurements that differ by more than 10% are considered unreliable (16).

### *Variability*

Thermodilution cardiac output can vary by as much as 10% without any apparent change in the clinical condition of the patient (17). Therefore, *a change in thermodilution cardiac output should exceed 10% to be considered clinically significant*.

### **Sources of Error**

As mentioned earlier, thermodilution is considered the gold standard method for measuring cardiac output at the bedside. However there are sources of error in the methodology, and the

more notable ones are summarized here.

### *Operator Error*

Low-volume or inappropriately warm injectates can result in overestimation of the cardiac output, and variability in the timing of the injectate in relation to the respiratory cycle can also produce spurious results ([6\)](#page-15-6).

## *Tricuspid Regurgitation*

Tricuspid regurgitation can result in underestimation or overestimation of the cardiac output ([6](#page-15-6)). Regurgitant flow across the tricuspid valve causes the injectate to be recycled, producing a prolonged, low amplitude [thermodilution](#page-9-0) curve similar to the one in the bottom frame of Figure 8.7. This results in a falsely low cardiac output measurement (18). Overestimation of the cardiac output can occur when the injectate is warmed because of recycling across the tricuspid valve.

### *Intracardiac Shunts*

Intracardiac shunts produce falsely elevated cardiac output measurements. In right-to-left shunts, a portion of the cold indicator fluid passes through the shunt, thereby creating an abbreviated thermodilution curve similar to the high-output curve in the middle panel of [Figure](#page-9-0) 8.7. In leftto-right shunts, the thermodilution curve is abbreviated because the shunted blood increases the blood volume in the right heart chambers, and this dilutes the indicator solution that is injected.

# **Continuous Cardiac Output Measurements**

Pulmonary artery catheters are available that can provide thermodilution cardiac output measurements as rapidly as every 20 seconds, without the need for bolus injections of cold fluid. These catheters have a small heating filament (near the proximal port of the catheter) that is activated by brief, randomly-generated electrical pulses that raise the surrounding blood temperature by about 0.02°C. The downstream thermistor averages the temperature-time curves over a 3 minute period to determine the cardiac output, which is updated every 20–30 seconds. (The small temperature change creates a poor signal-to-noise ratio, which is why multiple temperature-time curves must be measured and averaged.) This "pulsed warm thermodilution technique" has shown a good correlation with the traditional "intermittent bolus" technique (19,20).

The automated continuous thermodilution technique provides a more dynamic assessment of the cardiac output, and it also eliminates the time commitment, risk of operator error, and the volume infusions associated with the intermittent bolus technique. Moreover, there are PA catheters that allow continuous monitoring of both cardiac output and mixed venous O<sup>2</sup> saturation (SvO<sup>2</sup> ) (21), which adds the ability to monitor an indirect measure of tissue oxygenation. (See Chapter 9 for an explanation of the SvO<sup>2</sup> .)

# **CATHETER-DERIVED HEMODYNAMICS**

The PA catheter provides a wealth of information on cardiovascular function and systemic oxygen transport The following is a description of 10 hemodynamic parameters that can be

monitored using PA catheters. These are listed in [Table](#page-11-0) 8.1.

# **Body Size**

Hemodynamic parameters are often expressed in relation to body size, and the favored measure of body size for hemodynamic measurements is the body surface area (BSA), which can be determined with the following simple equation (22):

BSA 
$$(m^2)$$
 = Ht  $(cm)$  + Wt  $(kg)$  –  $60/100$  (8.3)

(*Note:* BSA is preferred over weight as an index of body size because cardiac output is linked to metabolic rate, and the basal metabolic rate is expressed in terms of body surface area.) Measurements that are expressed in relation to BSA are referred to as an "index" (e.g., cardiac index instead of cardiac output). The average-sized adult has a body surface area of 1.7 m2.

## **Cardiovascular Parameters**

The following parameters are used to evaluate cardiac performance and global tissue perfusion. The reference ranges for these parameters are included in [Table](#page-11-0) 8.1 Size-adjusted parameters are expressed as an *index* (e.g., cardiac index instead of cardiac output).

#### *Central Venous Pressure*

When the PA catheter is properly placed, the proximal port of the catheter will be in the right atrium, and the pressure recorded from this port should be the right atrial pressure (PRA). As mentioned previously, the pressure in the right atrium is the same as the pressure in the superior vena cava, and these pressures are collectively called the central venous pressure (CVP). In the absence of tricuspid valve dysfunction, the CVP should be equivalent to the right ventricular end diastolic pressure (RVEDP).

$$CVP = PRA = RVEDP (8.4)$$

The CVP is then a measure of the filling pressure for the right side of the heart. The normal range for the CVP is 0–5 mm Hg, and it can be a negative pressure in the sitting position.

### *Wedge Pressure*

As described earlier, the pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) is a measure of the left atrial pressure (PLA), and this pressure should be equivalent to the left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) when mitral valve function is normal.

$$PAWP = PLA = LVEDP (8.5)$$

The wedge pressure is thus a measure of the filling pressure for the left side of the heart. This pressure is slightly higher than the CVP (to keep the foramen ovale closed), and the normal range is 6–12 mm Hg.

### *Cardiac Index*

The cardiac output (CO) measurement is the single most important contribution of the PA catheter to hemodynamic assessments, as it not only provides an assessment of cardiac contractile strength (using the stroke volume), it also creates the ability to monitor systemic oxygen transport (see later). The cardiac output is typically expressed in relation to body surface area (BSA), and is called the *cardiac index* (CI).

$$CI = CO/BSA$$
 (8.6)

The normal range for the cardiac index is 2.4–4 L/min/m2, which is typically about 60% of the normal range for the cardiac output.

#### *Stroke Index*

The stroke volume (i.e., the volume of blood ejected during systole) is used to assess the strength of ventricular contractions, and the relationship between stroke volume and the pulmonary artery wedge pressure can be used to generate ventricular function curves. When adjusted for body size, the stroke volume is called the *stroke index* (SI), and it is derived as the cardiac index (CI) divided by the heart rate (HR):

$$SI = CI/HR$$
 (8.7)

The normal range of the SI in adults is 20–40 mL/m2.

#### *Systemic Vascular Resistance Index*

The hydraulic resistance in the systemic circulation is not a measurable quantity for a variety of reasons (e.g., resistance is flow-dependent and varies in different regions). Instead, the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) is a global measure of the relationship between systemic pressure and flow. The SVR is directly related to the mean pressure drop from the aorta to the right atrium (i.e., mean arterial pressure or MAP minus the CVP), and is inversely related to the cardiac

output. The size-adjusted SVR index (SVRI) is derived using the cardiac index (CI).

$$SVRI = (MAP - CVP)/CI$$
 (8.8)

The SVRI is expressed in Wood units (mm Hg/L/min/m2), which can be multiplied by 80 to obtain more conventional units of resistance (dynes∙sec-1∙cm-5/m2), but this conversion offers no advantage (23).

### *Pulmonary Vascular Resistance Index*

The pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) has the same limitations as mentioned for the systemic vascular resistance. The PVR is a global measure of the relationship between pressure and flow in the lungs, and is derived as the mean pressure drop from the pulmonary artery to the left atrium, divided by the cardiac output. Because the pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) is equivalent to the left atrial pressure, the pressure gradient across the lungs can be expressed as the difference between the mean pulmonary artery pressure and the wedge pressure (PAP – PAWP). The size-adjusted PVR index (PVRI) is derived using the cardiac index (CI):

$$PVRI = (PAP - PAWP)/CI$$
 (8.9)

Like the SVRI, the PVRI is expressed in Wood units (mm Hg/L/min/m2).

# **Oxygen Transport Parameters**

The oxygen transport parameters provide a global measure of oxygen supply and oxygen consumption. These parameters are described in detail in Chapter 9.

# *Oxygen Delivery*

The rate of oxygen transport in arterial blood is called the *oxygen delivery* (DO<sup>2</sup> ), and is the product of the cardiac output and the oxygen concentration in arterial blood (CaO<sup>2</sup> ).

$$DO_2 = CO \times CaO_2 \tag{8.10}$$

The O<sup>2</sup> concentration in arterial blood (CaO<sup>2</sup> ) is a function of the hemoglobin concentration (Hb), the O<sup>2</sup> carrying capacity of hemoglobin (1.34 mL per gram), and the arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO<sup>2</sup> ): i.e., CaO<sup>2</sup> = 1.34 × Hb × SaO<sup>2</sup> . Therefore, the DO<sup>2</sup> equation can be rewritten as:

$$DO_2 = CO \times (1.34 \times Hb \times SaO_2)$$
 (8.11)

The size-adjusted DO<sup>2</sup> is calculated using the cardiac index instead of cardiac output, and it is expressed as mL/min/m2. The normal range is shown in [Table](#page-11-0) 8.1

#### *Oxygen Uptake*

Oxygen uptake (VO<sup>2</sup> ), also called *oxygen consumption*, is the rate at which oxygen is taken up from the systemic capillaries into the tissues. The VO<sup>2</sup> is calculated as the product of the cardiac

output (CO) and the difference in O<sup>2</sup> concentration between arterial and venous blood (CaO<sup>2</sup> – CvO<sup>2</sup> ). The venous blood in this instance is "mixed" venous blood in the pulmonary artery.

$$VO_2 = CO \times (CaO_2 - CvO_2)$$
 (8.12)

If the CaO<sup>2</sup> and CvO<sup>2</sup> are each broken down into their component parts, the VO<sup>2</sup> equation can be rewritten as:

$$VO_2 = CO \times 1.34 \times Hb \times (SaO_2 - SvO_2)$$
(8.13)

SaO<sup>2</sup> and SvO<sup>2</sup> are the oxyhemoglobin saturations in arterial and mixed venous blood, respectively. The SaO<sup>2</sup> is continuously monitored with pulse oximetry, and the SvO<sup>2</sup> can also be continuously monitored with specialized PA catheters (mentioned earlier). The SvO<sup>2</sup> can also be measured in a blood sample drawn through the distal port of the PA catheter.

The size-adjusted VO<sup>2</sup> is calculated using the cardiac index instead of the cardiac output, and it is expressed as mL/min/m2. The normal range is shown in [Table](#page-11-0) 8.1. Note that the VO<sup>2</sup> is much lower than the DO<sup>2</sup> (see next).

### *Oxygen Extraction Ratio*

The oxygen extraction ratio (O<sup>2</sup> ER) is the ratio of O<sup>2</sup> uptake to O<sup>2</sup> delivery:

$$O_2 ER = VO_2/DO_2$$
 (8.14)

The normal range for the O<sup>2</sup> ER is 0.2 to 0.3, which means that O<sup>2</sup> uptake into tissues represents only 20% to 30% of the O<sup>2</sup> delivered to the systemic microcirculation. Oxygen extraction can increase to 0.50 or even higher to compensate for decreases in O<sup>2</sup> delivery. (See Chapter 9 for a more detailed explanation of this topic.)

# **Applications**

The following are some examples of clinical situations where the information generated by PA catheters can be useful:

- 1. The management of acute, decompensated heart failure, especially when complicated by labile blood pressures or worsening renal function.
- 2. Perioperative management of patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
- 3. The management of circulatory shock (24), especially cardiogenic shock, where use of the PA catheter has had some success in improving outcomes (25).

The measurements generated by PA catheters will appear in many chapters in this book, including Chapter 9 (Systemic Oxygenation), Chapter 11 (Fluid Management), Chapter 12 (Anemia and Red Blood Cell Transfusions), Chapters 14–17 (Shock Syndromes), Chapter 18 (Acute Heart Failure), Chapter 25 (Oxygen Inhalation), Chapter 26 (Noninvasive Ventilation), and Chapter 30 (Discontinuing Mechanical Ventilation).

# **A FINAL WORD**

# **An Undeserved Reputation**

Despite the wealth of physiologically relevant information it provides, the PA catheter has been vilified and almost abandoned because clinical studies have shown no survival benefit associated with use of the catheter ([3\)](#page-15-3). The following are some points in support of the PA catheter.

- 1. First and foremost, *the PA catheter is a monitoring device, not a therapy*, and clinical outcomes (e.g., mortality rate) should be used to evaluate therapies, not measurements.
- 2. Surveys indicate that *physicians often don't understand the measurements provided by PA catheters* (27,28), and any tool can be ineffective in the wrong hands.
- 3. Finally, the incessant use of mortality rates to evaluate critical care interventions is problematic because *the presumption that every intervention has to save lives to be of value is not valid*. Interventions have more specific and immediate goals other than life or death (e.g., the goal of a vasopressor drug infusion is to increase the blood pressure). In the case of a monitoring device, the goal is to provide useful information, and the PA catheter achieves this goal with distinction.
