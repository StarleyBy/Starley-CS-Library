# **The Ventilator-Dependent Patient**

*Eyes and ears are bad witnesses to men if they have souls that understand not their language.*

> Heraclitus 6th Century BC

This chapter describes the common practices and daily concerns involved in the care of ventilator-dependent patients. The focus is on artificial airways (endotracheal and tracheostomy tubes), the management of respiratory secretions, and mechanical complications of positivepressure ventilation (i.e., barotrauma and occult PEEP). The infectious complications of mechanical ventilation are described in the next chapter.

# **ARTIFICIAL AIRWAYS**

Positive pressure ventilation is delivered through a variety of plastic tubes that are passed into the trachea through the vocal cords (endotracheal tubes) or are inserted directly into the trachea (tracheostomy tubes). These tubes are equipped with an inflatable balloon at the distal end (called a cuff) that is used to seal the trachea and prevent positive-pressure inflation volumes from escaping out through the larynx.

### **Endotracheal Tubes**

Endotracheal (ET) tubes vary in length from 25 to 35 cm, and are sized according to their internal diameter, which varies from 5 to 10 mm (e.g., a size 7 ET tube will have an internal diameter of 7 mm). The size of the airways is primarily related to body height, and the recommended size of ET tubes according to height is as follows: size 7 ET tube for height ≤5 feet, 2 inches (5'2"), size 7.5 for height 5'3" to 5'10", and size 8 for height of 5'11'' or taller ([1\)](#page-16-0). Despite these recommendations, there is no evidence that ET tube size affects clinical outcomes ([2\)](#page-16-1).

#### *Proper Tube Position*

Evaluation of ET tube position is mandatory after intubation, and the portable chest film in

[Figure](#page-1-0) 28.1 shows the proper position of an ET tube. When the head is in a neutral position, *the tip of the ET tube should be 3 to 5 cm above the tracheal bifurcation or midway between the bifurcation and vocal cords*. (This bifurcation is often identified as the *carina*, which is a ridge of cartilage situated at the tracheal bifurcation.) If the bifurcation or carina is not visible, it can be located at the level of the T4–T5 interspace on a portable chest x-ray. Flexion or extension of the head and neck causes a 2 cm displacement of the tip of the endotracheal tube [\(3](#page-16-2)).

**FIGURE 28.1** Portable chest x-ray showing proper position of an endotracheal tube, with the tip of the tube located midway between the thoracic inlet and the tracheal bifurcation (carina).

**ESTIMATING LENGTH OF INSERTION:** For endotracheal intubation, the proper length of ET tube insertion can be estimated by locating the manubriosternal joint, which forms a convex angle on the chest wall (known as the angle of Louis) that is in the same horizontal plane as the tracheal bifurcation. With the head fully extended, the distance between the upper incisors and the manubriosternal joint is the insertion distance that should place the tip of the ET tube in the appropriate position [\(4](#page-16-3)).

# *Migration of Tubes*

ET tubes can migrate in either direction along the trachea (from manipulation of the tube during suctioning, turning, etc.), and when tubes move distally into the lungs, they often end up in the right mainstem bronchus (which runs a straight course down from the trachea). This is demonstrated in [Figure](#page-2-0) 28.2 [\(5](#page-16-4)), which shows the tip of the ET tube in the right mainstem

bronchus, resulting in atelectasis of the non-ventilated left lung. The risk of ET tube migration can be reduced by keeping the tip of ET tube no further than 21 cm from the teeth in women and 23 cm from the teeth in men ([6\)](#page-16-5).

#### *Laryngeal Damage*

Laryngeal injury has been demonstrated in more than one-half of ICU patients that are intubated for longer than 12 hours ([7\)](#page-16-6), and is more common with difficult intubations, large ET tubes, and prolonged intubations. The spectrum of laryngeal damage includes posterior and subglottic ulceration, granulomas, and laryngeal edema. Long-term problems with voice and shortness of breath have been reported [\(7](#page-16-6)), and laryngeal edema can be problematic after extubation (described in Chapter 30).

### *Subglottic Drainage Tubes*

The prominent role played by aspiration of mouth secretions in the pathogenesis of ventilatorassociated pneumonia has led to the introduction of specially-designed endotracheal tubes capable of draining mouth secretions that accumulate just above the inflated cuff. These tubes can reduce the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia [\(8](#page-16-7)), and they are described in more detail in the next chapter (see Figure 29.2).

### **Tracheostomy**

Tracheostomy is preferred in patients who require prolonged mechanical ventilation (>2 weeks). The are several advantages with tracheostomy, including greater patient comfort, easier access to the airways for clearing secretions and bronchodilator administration, reduced resistance for breathing, and reduced risk of laryngeal injury.

#### *Tracheostomy Timing*

Several studies have compared early tracheostomy (within one week after intubation) with late tracheostomy (two weeks or later after intubation), and the bulk of the evidence shows that early tracheostomy can reduce sedative requirements and reduce the time on mechanical ventilation, but it does not reduce the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia, and does not reduce the mortality rate [\(9](#page-16-8)[–11](#page-16-9)). The common practice is to *consider tracheostomy after one week of intubation if there is little chance of extubation in the following week*.

#### *Techniques*

The traditional method of performing a tracheotomy as an open surgical procedure has been replaced in popularity by *percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy*, where a guidewire is passed through a small needle puncture in the anterior wall of the trachea, and a tracheostomy tube is advanced over the wire and into the tracheal lumen. This technique, which is performed at the bedside, has several advantages over surgical tracheostomy (including less cost, avoiding general anesthesia, and fewer infections) ([12\)](#page-16-10), and is the preferred method of tracheostomy ([13\)](#page-16-11). However, the percutaneous technique has more technical difficulties than the surgical procedure ([12\)](#page-16-10), emphasizing the importance of a skilled and experienced operator.

The technique known as *cricothyroidotomy* is used only for emergency access to the airway. The trachea is entered through the cricothyroid membrane, just below the larynx, and there is high incidence of laryngeal injury and subglottic stenosis. Patients who survive following a cricothyroidotomy should have a regular tracheostomy (surgical or percutaneous) as soon as they are stable.

### *Complications*

Combining surgical and percutaneous tracheostomy, the mortality rate is less than 1%, the incidence of major bleeding is <5%, and the infection rate is 2–10% (with the lower rates in the percutaneous tracheostomies) [\(12](#page-16-10)).

**ACCIDENTAL DECANNULATION:** One acute complication that deserves mention is accidental decannulation. If the tracheostomy tube is dislodged before the stoma tract is mature (which takes about one week) the tract closes quickly, and blind reinsertion of the tube can create false tracts. *If a tracheostomy tube is dislodged within a few days of insertion, the patient should be reintubated orally before attempting to reinsert the tracheostomy tube*.

**TRACHEAL STENOSIS:** The most feared complication of tracheostomy is tracheal stenosis, which is a late complication that appears in the first 6 months after the tracheostomy tube is removed. Most cases of tracheal stenosis occur at the site of the tracheal incision, and are the result of tracheal narrowing after the stoma closes. The incidence of tracheal stenosis ranges from zero to 15% in individual reports [\(14](#page-16-12)), but most cases are asymptomatic. The risk of tracheal stenosis is the same with surgical and percutaneous tracheostomies [\(15](#page-16-13)).

# **Cuff Management**

Positive pressure ventilation requires a seal in the trachea that prevents gas from escaping out through the larynx during lung inflation, and this seal is created by inflatable balloons (called cuffs) that surround the distal portions of endotracheal and tracheostomy tubes. A tracheostomy tube with an inflated cuff is shown in [Figure](#page-5-0) 28.3. The cuff is attached to a pilot balloon that has a one-way valve. A syringe is attached to the pilot balloon and air is injected into the cuff until there is no audible leak around the cuff. (The pilot balloon will inflate as the cuff inflates.)

The pressure in the cuff (measured with a pressure gauge attached to the pilot balloon) should not exceed 25 mm Hg ([16\)](#page-16-14). This pressure limit is based on the assumption that the capillary hydrostatic pressure in the wall of the trachea is 25 mm Hg, and thus external (cuff) pressures above 25 mm Hg can compress the underlying capillaries and produce ischemic injury in the tracheal mucosa. Modern cuffs have an elongated design that reduces the pressure needed for a tracheal seal.

<span id="page-5-0"></span>![](_page_5_Picture_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 28.3** A tracheostomy tube with an inflated cuff.

#### *Cuff Leaks*

Cuff leaks are usually detected by audible sounds during lung inflation (created by gas flowing through the vocal cords). When a cuff leak becomes audible, the volume of the leak can be estimated as the difference between the desired tidal volume and the exhaled tidal volume measured by the ventilator. Cuff leaks are usually not caused by disruption of the cuff ([17\)](#page-16-15), but are instead the result of: (*a*) nonuniform contact between the cuff and the wall of the trachea, or (*b*) dysfunction of the valve on the pilot balloon.

**TROUBLESHOOTING:** If a cuff leak is apparent, the patient should be separated from the ventilator and the lungs should be manually inflated with an anesthesia bag. Then check the pilot balloon:

1. If the pilot balloon is inflated, then the cuff is inflated, and the problem is likely to be a nonuniform seal with the wall of the trachea. In this situation, deflate the cuff, and reposition the tube, then re-inflate the cuff. (You can put more air into the cuff, but make sure the pressure does not exceed 25 cm H2O). If this does not correct the leak, then replace the tube with a larger one.

2. If the pilot ballon is deflated, then the likely problem is a faulty one-way valve on the pilot balloon, or a disrupted cuff. In this situation, attempt to re-inflate the cuff, and if the pilot balloon does not inflate, then replace the tube.

# **AIRWAY CARE**

The clearance of respiratory secretions in intubated patients is often referred to as "pulmonary toilet". However, because the lungs are not a toilet, the term "airway care" seems more appropriate.

# **Suctioning**

Aspiration of airway secretions is a standard practice in the care of ventilator-dependent patients. However, this can have a number of unfavorable effects, including increases in heart rate, blood pressure, intracranial pressure, and occult PEEP (described later), and a decrease in arterial O<sup>2</sup> saturation [\(18](#page-16-16)). More importantly, biofilms containing pathogenic organisms are found on the inner surface of ET tubes and tracheostomy tubes (see [Figure](#page-7-0) 28.4), and passing a suction catheter through the tubes can dislodge these biofilms and inoculate the lungs with pathogenic organisms ([19\)](#page-16-17). As a result of these risks, *clinical practice guidelines do not recommended routine suctioning of the airways* ([18\)](#page-16-16). Instead, suctioning should be performed only when there is evidence of respiratory secretions (see next).

#### *Indications*

The following are considered the best indicators for airway suctioning ([18,](#page-16-16)[20\)](#page-16-18): (*a*) visible secretions in airway tubes or ventilator tubing, (*b*) auscultatory evidence of airway secretions, and (*c*) a sawtooth pattern on the ventilator flow waveform. Other indications could include xray evidence of segmental atelectasis and an abrupt decrease in arterial oxygenation, which could be the result of retained secretions.

<span id="page-7-0"></span>![](_page_7_Figure_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 28.4** Electron micrograph showing a biofilm on the inner surface of an endotracheal tube. Image from Reference 19.

# **Saline Instillation**

Once a standard practice, *the routine use of saline to facilitate the aspiration of secretions is NOT recommended* ([18\)](#page-16-16). There are two reasons for this: (*a*) saline will not reduce the viscosity of respiratory secretions (as described next), and (*b*) injection of saline can dislodge pathogenic organisms colonizing the inner surface of airway tubes. One study has shown that *injection of 5 mL of saline can dislodge up to 300,000 colonies of viable bacteria from the inner surface of endotracheal tubes* (21).

#### *Viscosity of Respiratory Secretions*

The respiratory secretions create a blanket that covers the mucosal surface of the airways. This blanket has a hydrophilic (water soluble) layer that faces inward to keep the mucosal surface moist, and a hydrophobic (water insoluble) layer that faces outward to trap particles and debris in the airways. This trapping is achieved by a meshwork of mucoprotein strands that are held together by disulfide bridges, and the combination of the mucoprotein meshwork and the trapped debris determines the viscoelastic behavior of the secretions. Thus, the layer that contributes to the viscosity of respiratory secretions is not water soluble, and hence *saline will not reduce the viscosity of respiratory secretions*. Adding saline to viscous respiratory secretions is like pouring water over grease.

# **Mucolytic Therapy**

When respiratory secretions are thick and tenacious, a mucolytic agent like *N-Acetylcysteine* can help to clear the airways. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a sulfhydryl-containing tripeptide that is

better known as the antidote for acetaminophen overdose, but it is also a mucolytic agent that acts by disrupting the disulfide bridges between mucoprotein strands in respiratory secretions (22). The drug is available in a liquid preparation (10 or 20% solution) that can be given as an aerosol spray, or injected directly into the airways ([Table](#page-8-0) 28.1). Aerosolized NAC is irritating and can provoke coughing and bronchospasm (especially in asthmatics), and direct instillation of NAC into the airway should be preferred for clearing secretions in ventilator-dependent patients.

# **PULMONARY BAROTRAUMA**

As described in Chapter 24, one of the principal mechanisms of ventilator-induced lung injury is overdistension of alveoli in normal lung regions (23), which ruptures the alveolar-capillary interface (see Figure 24.6). This is known as *volutrauma*, and it produces an inflammatory infiltration in the lung that is very similar to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Another consequence of alveolar rupture is the escape of gas from the distal airspaces, but this is called *pulmonary barotrauma*. If you are confused about the terms volutrauma and barotrauma, consider that *volutrauma is an expression of the strain (i.e., degree of deformation) on alveoli, while barotrauma is an expression of stress (i.e., the forces that produce deformation) imposed on alveoli, which is the transpulmonary pressure* (24).

### **Clinical Presentation**

Escape of gas from the alveoli can produce a variety of clinical manifestations. The alveolar gas can dissect along tissue planes and produce *pulmonary interstitial emphysema,* and can move into the mediastinum and produce *pneumomediastinum*. Mediastinal gas can move into the neck to produce *subcutaneous emphysema*, or can pass below the diaphragm to produce *pneumoperitoneum*. Finally, if the rupture involves the visceral pleura, gas will collect in the pleural space and produce a *pneumothorax*. Each of these entities can occur alone or in combination with the others.

#### **Pneumothorax**

The incidence of pneumothorax is 3–10% in ventilator-dependent patients who receive limitedvolume "lung protective ventilation" (25), and it has been reported in 35% of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (mode of ventilation unknown) (26). In addition to barotrauma,

iatrogenic pneumothoraces can be the result of procedures (i.e., insertion of central venous catheters, thoracentesis, and bronchoscopy).

#### *Clinical Presentation*

Pneumothoraces from procedures can be small and clinically silent, while those caused by barotrauma are usually larger and can cause hypoxemia and even hypotension (see later). *The most specific clinical finding is subcutaneous emphysema*, which appears initially in the neck and upper thorax. The absence of breath sounds is an unreliable finding in ventilator-dependent patients because sounds transmitted from the tracheal tubes and ventilator tubing can be mistaken for airway sounds.

#### *Radiographic Detection*

The radiographic *detection of pleural air can be difficult in the supine position, because pleural air does not collect at the lung apex when patients are supine* (27). This is illustrated in Figure 28.5. In this case of a traumatic [pneumothorax,](#page-10-0) the chest x-ray is unrevealing, but the CT scan reveals an anterior pneumothorax on the left. Pleural air will collect in the most superior region of the hemithorax, which in the supine position, is the region just anterior to both lung bases. Therefore, *basilar and subpulmonic collections of air are characteristic of pneumothorax in the supine position* (27).

#### *Ultrasound Detection*

Ultrasound of the lungs has consistently proven to be more sensitive than chest radiography for the detection of pneumothorax (28), but the yield is highly dependent on the skill and experience of the operator.

**METHOD:** The linear ultrasound probe is placed on the anterior chest and perpendicular to the 3rd or 4th intercostal space along the midclavicular line. The goal is to identify the pleural line (see [Figure](#page-11-0) 28.6), a bright, hyperechoic line that represents the apposition of the parietal and visceral pleura. Normally, the visceral pleura moves along the parietal pleura as the lung inflates and deflates, and this sliding movement creates a shimmering effect on the ultrasound image. When air is present in the pleural space, the two pleural surfaces separate, and the sliding movement of the pleural line is lost. The absence of "lung sliding" is therefore suggestive (but not pathognomonic) of pneumothorax (29). (However, the presence of lung sliding rules out the diagnosis of pneumothorax.)

<span id="page-10-0"></span>![](_page_10_Picture_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 28.5** A portable chest x-ray and CT image of the thorax in a young male with blunt trauma to the chest. An anterior pneumothorax is evident on the CT image (indicated by the asterisk) but is not apparent on the portable chest x-ray.

When lung sliding is absent, the ultrasound probe should be moved laterally and inferiorly in increments, to reach the point where the two pleural surfaces meet again (at the edge of the pneumothorax), which is indicated by the return of lung sliding. This is known as the "lung point", and it is pathognomonic of pneumothorax (29).

#### *Tension Pneumothorax*

Pleural air can accumulate rapidly when a pneumothorax is the result of positive pressure ventilation, and this accumulation can eventually produce a life-threatening *tension pneumothorax* where the increase in intrathoracic pressure collapses the ipsilateral lung, and causes a progressive decrease in cardiac output that culminates in "obstructive shock", and

cardiac arrest from pulseless electrical activity. This condition should be considered in any ventilator-dependent patient who develops unexplained hypoxemia or hypotension. It is easily recognized on a portable chest x-ray, as shown in [Figure](#page-12-0) 28.7 (30). Note the absence of lung markings in the left hemothorax (indicating complete collapse of the left lung), and the mediastinal shift to the right (indicating a marked increase in pressure in the left hemithorax. The left hemidiaphragm is also depressed, which is another sign of increased intrapleural pressure.

**FIGURE 28.6** Ultrasound image showing the hyperechoic pleural line, which represents the apposition of the visceral and parietal pleura. A sliding movement in the pleural line with respirations occurs normally, and the absence of "lung sliding is suggestive of a pneumothorax. See text for further explanation.

**FIGURE 28.7** Tension pneumothorax. Note the absence of lung markings in the left hemithorax, with depression of the left hemidiaphragm and contralateral shift of the mediastinum. X-ray from Reference 30.

**DECOMPRESSION:** Tension pneumothorax is a medical emergency, and requires immediate decompression. The recommended procedure is insertion of a 14-gauge, 8 cm (3.25 inch) angiocatheter in the fifth intercostal space just anterior to the midaxillary line (31,32). (The failure rate is higher when shorter catheters are used, and when the catheters are inserted in the second interspace at the midclavicular line).

Needle decompression is not always successful, either because the needle does not reach the pleural space, or because the catheters kink or are dislodged. If this is the case, then "finger decompression" is recommended (i.e., placing a finger in the pleural space) (31). Following decompression, a small-bore chest tube (8.5–14 French) should be inserted.

#### **Pleural Evacuation**

Evacuation of pleural air is accomplished by inserting a chest tube through the fourth or fifth intercostal space along the mid axillary line. The tube should be advanced in an anterior and superior direction to evacuate air (and is directed inferiorly to evacuate fluid). Pleural evacuation

<span id="page-13-0"></span>is achieved with a three-chamber system, which is depicted in [Figure](#page-13-0) 28.8.

![](_page_13_Figure_1.jpeg)

**FIGURE 28.8** A three-compartment pleural drainage system for evacuating air and fluid from the pleural space.

#### *Fluid Collection*

The first chamber in the system collects fluid from the pleural space and allows air to pass through to the next chamber. Because the inlet of this chamber is not in direct contact with the fluid, the accumulating fluid does not exert a back pressure on the pleural space.

#### *Water Seal Chamber*

The second chamber creates a one way valve for the pleural space using a column of water (usually 2 cm in height) to produce a slightly positive pleural pressure (2 cm H2O) that prevents atmospheric air from entering the pleural space. The water thus "seals" the pleural space from the surrounding atmosphere, hence this is called the "water seal chamber".

**BUBBLING:** Air that is evacuated from the pleural space will pass through the water and create bubbles. Thus, *the presence of bubbles in the water seal chamber is evidence of an air leak through a bronchopleural fistula (a hole in the lungs)*.

#### *Suction Control*

The final component of the system is an adjustable valve that is connected to wall suction and controls the level of negative pressure used for pleural drainage. This pressure is usually set at – 20 cm H2O.

#### *Why Suction?*

The practice of using suction to evacuate pleural air is often unnecessary, and can be counterproductive. Suction may help to reinflate the lungs when the pleural air is evacuated, but thereafter the negative pressure in the pleural space will increase the transpulmonary pressure (the pressure difference between alveoli and the pleural space), and this will promote the flow of air through a bronchopleural fistula. Thus *applying suction to the pleural space will promote air*

*leaks from the lungs and prevent the closure of bronchopleural fistulas*. If there is a persistent air leak when suction is being applied to the pleural space, the suction should be turned off. Air leaks from the lungs will continue to be evacuated when the pleural pressure becomes more positive than the water seal pressure.

# **OCCULT (INTRINSIC) PEEP**

Occult PEEP (also called intrinsic PEEP and auto-PEEP) is the result of incomplete emptying of the lungs. It is common in patients with severe airflow obstruction (e.g., it is responsible for the hyperinflation in acute asthma), and is exacerbated by rapid breathing and high tidal volumes (33). In ventilator-dependent patients, occult PEEP is considered universal in those with asthma and COPD (34,35), and low levels (≤3 cm H2O) are also common in patients with ARDS (36).

# **Adverse Effects**

Occult PEEP has several adverse effects, which are summarized below (33).

- 1. Occult PEEP increases mean intrathoracic pressure, which can impair venous return and decrease cardiac output.
- 2. The hyperinflation associated with occult PEEP increases the work of breathing because greater negative pressures are required to draw the tidal volume into the lungs. (To appreciate this effect, take a deep breath, and then try breathing from there.)
- 3. Occult PEEP increases end-inspiratory alveolar volume and pressure, which increases the risk of volutrauma and barotrauma.
- 4. Occult PEEP can be transmitted into the superior vena cava and create a spurious increase in central venous pressure measurements.

# **Monitoring Occult PEEP**

As indicated by its name, occult PEEP is not evident in the airway pressures monitored during mechanical ventilation. It is easy to detect but difficult to quantify. Evidence of occult PEEP is provided by the expiratory flow waveform, which shows the presence of airflow at the end of expiration (see Figure 23.5). Determining the level of occult PEEP requires an end-expiratory occlusion maneuver.

# *End-Expiratory Occlusion*

Occlusion of the expiratory circuit at the end of expiration will reveal occult PEEP, because in the absence of airflow, the pressure in the proximal airways will be equivalent to end-expiratory alveolar pressure. This is demonstrated in [Figure](#page-15-0) 28.9. Accuracy requires that the occlusion occur at the very end of expiration, and this cannot be timed properly if patients are breathing spontaneously. Therefore, *the end-expiratory occlusion method is reliable only in patients who are not breathing spontaneously*.

<span id="page-15-0"></span>![](_page_15_Figure_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 28.9** The features of occult PEEP. The presence of airflow (V) at end expiration indicates a pressure drop from the alveolus (PALV) to the proximal airways (PPROX). As shown at the top of the figure, the proximal airway pressure returns to zero at end expiration while the alveolar pressure remains positive; hence the term *occult* PEEP. The upper left panel illustrates the end expiratory occlusion method for measuring the level of occult PEEP.

# **Management**

The maneuvers used to prevent or reduce hyperinflation and occult PEEP are all directed at promoting alveolar emptying during expiration. These maneuvers include reducing the tidal volume, increasing the inspiratory flow rate, reducing the inspiratory time (in pressure control ventilation), and reducing the respiratory rate, if possible. Some of these maneuvers will reduce the minute ventilation, which may not be desirable.

# *Applied PEEP*

The addition of external PEEP can reduce hyperinflation (and occult PEEP) by holding the small airways open at end-expiration. The level of applied PEEP must be enough to counterbalance the pressure causing small airways collapse, but should not exceed the level of occult PEEP (so that it does not impair expiratory flow) (37). To accomplish this, the level of applied PEEP should be just below the level of occult PEEP. Since occult PEEP is difficult to quantify in spontaneously breathing patients, an alternative method is to monitor the level of end-expiratory airflow in response to applied PEEP; i.e., if the applied PEEP reduces or eliminates end-expiratory flow, then it is reducing the level of occult PEEP. However, the end result is still PEEP (applied PEEP instead of occult PEEP), but the applied PEEP will help to reduce the risk of atelectrauma from repetitive opening and closing of small airways at the end of expiration. (*Note:* The effect of

applied PEEP on occult PEEP is included for completeness, but attempting to reduce occult PEEP with applied PEEP is probably not worth the trouble.)

# **A FINAL WORD**

The patient's clinical course in the first few days of mechanical ventilation will give you an indication of what is coming. If the patient is not improving after the first week, proceed to tracheostomy (for patient comfort and improved clearance of secretions). Most of the day-to-day management of the ventilator-dependent patient involves vigilance for adverse events (i.e., "putting out fires"). You will learn that, in many cases, you are not the one controlling the course of the patient's illness.
