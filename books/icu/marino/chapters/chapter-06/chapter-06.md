# **Analgesia and Sedation in the ICU**

*To cure sometimes, to relieve often, and to comfort always.*

Edward Livingston Trudeau, MD (1848−1915)

Contrary to popular perception, our principal function is not to save lives (since this is impossible on a consistent basis), but rather to *relieve pain and suffering,* and the ICU is the flagship of pain and suffering in hospitalized patients. In surveys of patients who have been discharged from the ICU, anxiety and unrelieved pain are the dominant recollections of the ICU stay ([1\)](#page-16-0). While it is not possible to completely eliminate the unpleasantness of the ICU stay, attention to patient comfort is always warranted, and surveys like one in [Figure](#page-1-0) 6.1 [\(2](#page-16-1)) indicate that there is much work to be done.

This chapter describes the pharmacological approach to pain and stress relief in the ICU, with a focus on intravenous drug regimens and recommendations from expert commentaries on the subject ([3](#page-16-2)[−7](#page-16-3)). Nonpharmacological measures are not included here, but are available in a clinical practice guideline listed at the end of the chapter [\(4](#page-16-4)).

## **THE ICU EXPERIENCE**

It is axiomatic to state that the ICU stay is a stressful experience for patients. Several stressors have been identified, including unrelieved pain and anxiety, dyspnea, the inability to communicate (in intubated patients), and disrupted sleep. The stress of a prolonged ICU stay can have far-reaching neuropsychiatric consequences, as post-traumatic stress disorder has been reported in patients who required prolonged periods of mechanical ventilation [\(8](#page-16-5)).

## **Pain in The ICU**

Unrelieved pain is the most frequently cited stressor in the ICU [\(9](#page-16-6)), and the frequency of painful experiences is equivalent in surgical and medical ICUs [\(10](#page-16-7)).

#### *Altered Pain Perception*

Pain is generally defined as an unpleasant sensory experience [\(11](#page-16-8)). The degree of this unpleasantness (i.e., pain intensity) varies with the type and strength of the *nociceptive* (pain

producing) stimulus, and is also influenced by the presence and severity of disease. This latter condition applies to critically ill patients, as summarized in the following statements:

- 1. The sensation of pain is magnified in critically ill patients, and this condition of *hypernociception* can transform a minor event into a painful experience.
- 2. A common source of pain in ICU patients is the simple act of being turned in bed ([9\)](#page-16-6), and about 50% of patients experience pain at rest (usually in the lower back and legs), in the absence of a noxious stimulus ([4,](#page-16-4)[9,](#page-16-6)[10\)](#page-16-7).
- 3. The heightened pain sensation in critically ill patients is attributed to systemic inflammation (via the production of prostenoids) and prolonged immobility.

<span id="page-1-0"></span>Failure to recognize the exaggerated pain sensation in ICU patients is a source of inadequate pain control. However, this can be corrected with the use of pain assessment tools, like the ones described next.

## *Monitoring Pain*

Routine assessments of pain intensity can be used to guide analgesic therapy. Because pain is a subjective sensation, the patient's self-assessment is the most accurate measure of pain intensity.

- 1. When patients are capable of self-assessment, the *Numerical Ranking Scale* is recommended to quantify pain intensity ([4\)](#page-16-4). This is a horizontal scale with 10 equally spaced divider markings, numbered 1 (no pain) to 10 (maximum pain). The patient points to the numbered marking that corresponds to the intensity of pain. A score greater than 3 indicates unacceptable pain.
- 2. When patients are not capable of self-assessment due to heavy sedation (e.g., during assisted ventilation), then physical signs can be used to assess pain. This is the basis for the *Behavioral Pain Scale* shown in [Table](#page-2-0) 6.1 ([12\)](#page-16-9), which includes 12 individual behaviors separated into

three categories: facial expression, arm flexion, and tolerance of mechanical ventilation. The final score ranges from 3 (no pain) to 12 (maximum pain). A score of 6 or higher indicates unacceptable pain.

#### *Vital Signs*

There is a tendency to look for changes in heart rate or blood pressure as evidence of pain, but this practice should be abandoned, because there is a poor correlation between pain intensity (as reported by patients) and changes in any of the vital signs ([3,](#page-16-2)[4](#page-16-4)).

## **ANALGESIA WITH OPIOIDS**

The drugs described in this section are the most effective analgesics available (and hence the most popular drugs used for pain relief in the ICU). At the outset, a few definitions deserve mention:

- 1. An *opiate* is a natural chemical derivative of opium.
- 2. An *opioid* is a naturally-occurring or synthetic derivative of opium that acts by stimulating specific receptors (called *opioid receptors*) in the central nervous system and elsewhere. Stimulation of opioid receptors produces a variety of effects, including analgesia, sedation, euphoria, pupillary constriction, respiratory depression, bradycardia, constipation, nausea and vomiting, urinary retention, and pruritis.

3. A *narcotic* is an outdated term for an opioid, but it has also been adopted by law enforcement agencies to refer to an opioid that is obtained illegally and used for non-medical purposes.

The terms opiate and opioid are often used interchangeably, but opioid is used here because it is a more accurate term for the drugs included in this section. In addition to their analgesic effects, opioids have the added benefit of producing mild sedation, but without amnesic effects ([13\)](#page-16-10). All opioids are metabolized in the liver, and the metabolites are excreted in the urine.

## **Drugs and Dosing Regimens**

The opioids used most frequently in the ICU are morphine, fentanyl, and hydromorphone, and the recommended intravenous dosing for each drug is shown in [Table](#page-3-0) 6.2 ([3\)](#page-16-2). It is important to emphasize that opioid dose requirements can vary widely in individual patients, and therefore *the effective dose of an opioid is determined by each patient's response, and not by the recommended dosing of the drug*.

## *Morphine*

Morphine is the principal alkaloid of opium, and has been the traditional opioid used for pain control in the ICU. However, morphine has the following disadvantages that have curbed its popularity:

- 1. Morphine has active metabolites that accumulate in renal failure. One metabolite (morphine 3 glucuronide) can produce agitation with myoclonus and seizures (14), while another metabolite (morphine-6-glucuronide) has more potent analgesic effects than the parent drug (15). To avoid accumulation of these metabolites, *the maintenance dose of morphine should be reduced by 50% in patients with renal failure* (16).
- 2. Morphine promotes the release of histamine, which produces systemic vasodilation and a decrease in blood pressure (17). Hypotension is typically seen in patients with a

hyperadrenergic state and increased peripheral vascular tone [\(3](#page-16-2)). Morphine-induced histamine release does not promote bronchoconstriction, as morphine doses of 1.5 mg/kg have been given to asthma patients without adverse consequences (18).

#### *Fentanyl*

Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that has replaced morphine as the most popular opioid analgesic in ICUs [\(9](#page-16-6)). The advantages of fentanyl over morphine include the following:

- 1. Fentanyl is 600 times more lipid soluble than morphine, and has a more rapid onset of action.
- 2. Fentanyl does not promote histamine release (17), and thus has less risk of hypotension than morphine. The hemodynamic tolerance to fentanyl is a major source of its appeal in critically ill patients.
- 3. Fentanyl has no active metabolites. (However, the parent drug can accumulate in renal failure, and some recommend avoiding fentanyl in patients with end-stage renal disease) ([5\)](#page-16-11).

One disadvantage of fentanyl is its lipophilicity, which promotes accumulation in the brain with continued usage.

#### *Hydromorphone*

Hydromorphone (Dilaudid®) is a semi-synthetic derivative of morphine that may produce more effective analgesia than morphine (19), and does not require dose alteration in renal failure. It seems to be favored for the treatment of cancer-related pain, but has no proven advantages over fentanyl for analgesia.

#### *Remifentanil*

Remifentanil is an ultra-short acting opioid that is 250 times more potent than morphine ([6\)](#page-16-12). The recommended intravenous dose begins with a loading dose of 1.5 µg/kg, and follows with a continuous infusion at 0.5–15 µg/kg/hr [\(3](#page-16-2)). Analgesic effects appear in about one minute, and are lost within 10 minutes after stopping the infusion. The short duration of action is a reflection of drug metabolism; i.e., remifentanil is broken down by nonspecific esterases in plasma ([6\)](#page-16-12). Since drug metabolism does not take place in the liver or kidneys, dose adjustments are not necessary in renal or hepatic failure.

Remifentanil has not been a popular drug for pain control in ICUs, but it has been used in patients with traumatic brain injury (20), where its short duration of action allows for frequent evaluations of neurologic status. The abrupt cessation of opioid activity can precipitate acute opioid withdrawal [\(6](#page-16-12)), which can be prevented by combining remifentanil with a longer-acting opioid.

#### *Meperidine*

Meperidine (Demerol®, Pethidine®) is an opioid analgesic that is no longer favored for pain control in the ICU because of the potential for *neurotoxicity*. Meperidine is metabolized in the liver to normeperidine, a metabolite that is slowly excreted by the kidneys (elimination half-life is 15–40 hours). Accumulation of normeperidine can produce central nervous system excitation, with agitation, myoclonus, delirium, and generalized seizures (21). Since renal dysfunction is

prevalent in ICU patients, accumulation of normeperidine is an unacceptable risk.

## **Patient-Controlled Analgesia**

For patients who are awake and capable of drug self-administration, *patient-controlled analgesia* (PCA) can be an effective method of pain control, and may be superior to intermittent opioid dosing. The PCA method uses an electronic infusion pump that can be activated by the patient. When pain is sensed, the patient presses a button connected to the pump to receive a small intravenous bolus of drug. After each bolus, the pump is disabled for a mandatory time period called the *lockout interval*, to prevent overdosing. The opioid dosing regimens for PCA are shown in [Table](#page-3-0) 6.2. The minimum lockout interval is determined by the time required to achieve peak drug effect (22). When writing orders for PCA, you must specify the initial loading dose (if any), the lockout interval, and the repeat bolus dose. PCA can be used alone or in conjunction with a low-dose opioid infusion.

## **Adverse Effects of Opioids**

Opioids can produce a multitude of adverse effects;, and the following are the ones of most concern in ICU patients. (See also Chapter 52 for a description of opioid overdoses.)

#### *Respiratory Depression*

Opioids produce a centrally-mediated, dose-dependent decrease in respiratory rate and tidal volume, but *respiratory depression and hypoxemia are uncommon when opioids are given in the usual doses* (23). However, opioid doses that impair arousal can impair ventilation and promote hypercapnia (24). Patients with sleep apnea syndrome or chronic hypercapnia are particularly prone to respiratory depression from opioids.

#### *Cardiovascular Effects*

Opioid analgesia is often accompanied by decreases in blood pressure and heart rate, which are the result of decreased sympathetic activity and increased parasympathetic activity. (Morphineinduced hypotension may also be the result of histamine release.) Opioid effects on blood pressure are usually mild and well-tolerated, at least in the supine position (25). Decreases in blood pressure can be pronounced in patients with hypovolemia or heart failure (where there is an increased baseline sympathetic tone), or when opioids are given in combination with benzodiazepines (26). Opioid-induced hypotension is rarely a threat to tissue perfusion, and the blood pressure responds to intravenous fluids or small bolus doses of vasopressors.

## *Intestinal Motility*

Opioids are well known for their ability to depress bowel motility via activation of opioid receptors in the GI tract. This is a source of troublesome constipation in cancer patients; in critically ill patients, impaired GI motility can promote reflux of enteral tube feedings into the oropharynx, creating a risk for aspiration pneumonia.

**METHYLNALTREXONE:** Methylnaltrexone is a peripheral opioid receptor antagonist that can block the GI effects of opioids without influencing the analgesic effects. This drug has proven successful in treating opioid-induced constipation in palliative care settings, but a preliminary

study in ICU patients is not encouraging (27). In this study, intravenous methylnaltrexone in a dose of 12 mg daily (in adults weighing >60 kg) did not significantly increase laxation in patients with opioid-induced constipation.

#### *Nausea and Vomiting*

Opioids can promote vomiting via stimulation of the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the lower brainstem (24). All opioids are equivalent in their ability to promote vomiting, but vomiting induced by one opioid occasionally resolves when another opioid is used.

## **ANALGESIA WITH NON-OPIOIDS**

Recent concerns about the rise in opioid dependency have prompted recommendations to reduce opioid use in hospitalized patients, if possible. To this end, the following analgesic agents should be considered as first-line agents or adjuvants to opioid analgesia in the ICU. The intravenous dosing regimens for these agents are presented in [Table](#page-6-0) 6.3.

| Ketorolac     | Dosing: 30 mg IV every 6 hrs. Reduce dose by 50% for patients with renal failure, age ≥65 yrs,<br>or body weight <50 kg.<br>Comment: Serious complications (e.g., renal impairment) are uncommon with short-term use. |  |
| Ketamine      | Dosing: 60–120 µg/hr, in combination with an opioid.<br>Comment: Psychomimetic effects are not prominent at the doses used for opioid-sparing<br>analgesia.                                                           |  |

## **Acetaminophen**

Acetaminophen was approved for intravenous use in 2010, and is intended for the short-term treatment of pain and fever in postoperative patients who are unable to receive the drug via the oral or rectal routes. The recommended dose is 1 gram IV every 6 hrs, with a maximum allowable dose of 4 grams daily (to prevent acetaminophen hepatotoxicity) (28). This dosing regimen has a documented opiate-sparing effect in postoperative patients (29). The major disadvantage of acetaminophen (in addition to the risk of hepatotoxicity) is the lack of an antiinflammatory effect.

#### **Ketorolac**

Ketorolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that produces analgesia without respiratory depression. The drug can be used alone for mild pain, but is more often used in combination with an opioid analgesic for moderate-to-severe pain. Ketorolac co-administration can reduce the opioid dose by 25−50% (30).

#### *Dosing Regimen*

Ketorolac can be given by intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) injection, but IM injections of ketorolac can produce hematomas (31), so the IV route is preferred. The recommended dosing regimen for moderate-to-severe pain is 30 mg IV every 6 hrs (32). A 50% dose reduction (15 mg every 6 hrs) is recommended for patients with renal impairment, advanced age, and for those with a body weight <50 kg (32).

#### *Risk*

The beneficial actions of ketorolac and other NSAIDs are attributed to inhibition of prostaglandin production, but this also creates a risk for gastric mucosal injury and impaired renal function. These adverse effects are typically associated with excessive dosing or prolonged exposure to NSAIDs, and they are uncommon with short-term ketorolac use in the recommended doses (32–34).

## **Ketamine**

Ketamine is a phencyclidine (PCP!) derivative that has anesthetic and analgesic properties, but it also has psychomimetic effects (e.g., dissociative reactions, hallucinations, and delirium after discontinuation), and these latter effects have limited its use as an analgesic outside the operating room. However, low doses of ketamine (60–120 µg/kg/hr) have been used in combination with opioids (opioid-sparing effect) without troublesome psychomimetic side effects [\(6](#page-16-12)).

Other notable effects of ketamine include increases in blood pressure and heart rate (sympathomimetic effects), bronchodilation, nausea and vomiting, and hypersalivation ([6\)](#page-16-12). The sympathomimetic effects may be advantageous in patients with circulatory shock, while the bronchodilation is desirable in patients with asthma. However, the non-analgesic effects of ketamine are diminished in the dose range used for opioid-sparing analgesia. Ketamine is generally not advised for patients with myocardial ischemia ([6\)](#page-16-12).

## **Neuropathic Pain**

Non-opioid analgesia is usually required for neuropathic pain (e.g., from diabetic neuropathy), and the recommended drugs for this type of pain are *gabapentin* and *carbamazepine* [\(3](#page-16-2)). Both drugs must be given enterally. Effective drug doses vary in individual patients, but typical doses are 600 mg every 8 hrs for gabapentin, and 100 mg every 6 hours for carbamazepine.

## **ANXIETY IN THE ICU**

Anxiety and related disorders (agitation and delirium) are observed in as many as 85% of patients in the ICU (35). These disorders can be defined as follows:

- 1. *Anxiety* is characterized by exaggerated feelings of fear or apprehension that are sustained by internal mechanisms more than external events.
- 2. *Agitation* is a state of anxiety that is accompanied by increased motor activity.
- 3. *Delirium* is an acute confusional state that may, or may not, have agitation as a component. Although delirium is often equated with agitation, there is a hypoactive form of delirium that is

characterized by lethargy. (Delirium is described in more detail in Chapter 45.)

The common denominator in these disorders is the *absence of a sense of well-being*.

## **Sedation**

Sedation is the process of relieving anxiety and establishing a state of calm. This process includes general supportive measures (like frequent communication with patients and families), and drug therapy. Several drugs are available for sedation in ICU patients, including benzodiazepines (e.g., midazolam), propofol, dexmedetomidine, and haloperidol.

## **Monitoring Sedation**

The routine use of sedation scales is instrumental in achieving effective sedation in the ICU. The sedation scales that are most reliable for ICU patients are the Sedation-Agitation Scale (SAS) and the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) [\(3](#page-16-2)), which is shown in [Table](#page-8-0) 6.4 (36). The RASS includes 4 possible scores for progressive agitation (+1 to +4) and 5 possible scores for progressive sedation (–1 to –5). The optimal RASS score is zero (alert and calm). The added advantage of RASS is the ability to monitor serial changes in a patient's mental state (37). This latter feature allows the RASS score to be used as the end-point of sedative drug therapy. (Sedative drug infusions can be titrated to achieve a RASS score of –1 to –2, which represents light sedation.)

To determine the RASS, proceed as follows:

**Step 1 Observation:** Observe the patient without interaction. If patient is alert, assign the appropriate score (0 to +4). If patient is not alert, go to Step 2.

**Step 2 Verbal Stimulation:** Address the patient by name in a loud voice and ask the patient to look at you. Can repeat once if necessary. If patient responds to voice, assign the appropriate score (−1 to −3). If there is no

response, go to Step 3.

**Step 3 Physical Stimulation:** Shake the patient's shoulder. If there is no response, rub the sternum vigorously. Assign the appropriate score (−4 to −5).

From Reference 36.

## **BENZODIAZEPINES**

Benzodiazepines have been the traditional sedative agents used in the ICU, but they are gradually losing ground to other sedatives because of drug accumulation with prolonged use, and an increased risk of ICU-related delirium (see later). There are two benzodiazepines that are favored for intravenous delivery: midazolam (Versed®) and lorazepam (Ativan®). Diazepam (Valium®) is generally avoided because the long half-life (90 hours) and presence of active metabolites promotes prolonged sedation, especially with renal impairment. The intravenous dosing regimens for midazolam and lorazepam are shown in [Table](#page-10-0) 6.5 [\(3](#page-16-2)).

## **Midazolam**

Midazolam is a short-acting drug that is favored for procedural sedation. Sedative effects are apparent within 5 minutes, and they last for 1–2 hours. Because of the short-lived effect, midazolam can be given as a continuous IV infusion for more prolonged sedation. However, midazolam is highly lipid soluble, and will accumulate in the central nervous system when infused continuously. To avoid prolonged sedation from drug accumulation, *midazolam infusions should be limited to ≤48 hrs* ([4\)](#page-16-4).

Midazolam is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system in the liver, and drugs that interfere with this enzyme system (e.g., diltiazem, erythromycin) can potentiate the sedative effects. Midazolam has one active metabolite that is cleared by the kidneys, and renal impairment can add to the tendency for prolonged sedation [\(3](#page-16-2)[,4](#page-16-4)).

## **Lorazepam**

Lorazepam has a rapid onset of action, like midazolam, but the effect lasts longer (up to 6 hours). Continuous infusions of lorazepam can also lead to drug accumulation and prolonged sedation, but this effect is less pronounced (38), because lorazepam is less lipid soluble than midazolam, and has no active metabolites. However, there is a more serious risk associated with lorazepam infusions: i.e., propylene glycol toxicity (see next).

## *Propylene Glycol Toxicity*

Propylene glycol is added to certain intravenous drug preparations to enhance drug solubility in plasma, and intravenous lorazepam has the highest concentration of propylene glycol of all drug preparations. Propylene glycol is converted to lactic acid in the liver, and excessive intake can produce a clinical syndrome characterized by a metabolic (lactic) acidosis, altered mentation, systemic inflammation, and renal failure (39). The risk of this "toxidrome" emerges when the lorazepam infusion rate exceeds the upper limit of the recommended rate (0.1 mg/kg/hr), or is >10 mg/hr, for longer than 48 hours (39,40).

Dosing recommendations from Reference 3.

**OSMOLAL GAP:** Plasma levels of propylene glycol are not routinely available, but an elevated osmolal gap (i.e., >10 mosm/kg H2O) has shown a good correlation with propylene glycol accumulation (41). (Lactate levels are unreliable for predicting either propylene glycol levels or the risk of clinical symptoms.) Therefore, monitoring the osmolal gap is recommended when the lorazepam infusion rate is ≥0.1 mg/kg hr, or >10 mg/hr, for 48 hours (39–41). (See Chapter 31 for more on the osmolal gap, and how to calculate the plasma osmolality.)

## **Advantages**

The advantages of sedation with benzodiazepines include the following:

- 1. The rapid onset of action makes benzodiazepines well-suited for the acute management of anxiety and agitation.
- 2. Benzodiazepines cause a dose-dependent anterograde amnesia that is distinct from the sedative effect (42). Short-term memory is less affected than long-term memory. This is considered advantageous because it eliminates memories of stressful experiences, and it may explain why as many as 40% of patients who leave the ICU have no recollection of events that occurred while in the ICU ([1,](#page-16-0)43).
- 3. Benzodiazepines are the sedatives of choice for the management of alcohol and opioid withdrawal.

## **Disadvantages**

The major disadvantages of benzodiazepines are drug accumulation with prolonged use, and a perceived tendency to promote delirium.

## *Prolonged Sedation*

The major disadvantage of benzodiazepines is their tendency to accumulate and produce excessive sedation and delayed awakening, which can delay weaning from mechanical ventilation and prolong the ICU stay. As mentioned earlier, this is more of a problem with midazolam than lorazepam; e.g., in one study of prolonged sedation in ventilator-dependent patients, the time to emerge from sedation was 30 hours for midazolam and 4–5 hours for

lorazepam (38). Lorazepam is thus the benzodiazepine-of-choice for prolonged periods of continuous-infusion sedation (e.g., in ventilator-dependent patients) [\(4](#page-16-4)).

#### *Delirium*

Clinical studies have shown a relationship between benzodiazepine use and delirium in ICU patients [\(4](#page-16-4),44). The link may be gamma-amino-butyric-acid (GABA), the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain; i.e., benzodiazepines act by binding to GABA receptors in the brain, and GABA-mediated neurotransmission is also involved in the development of delirium (44). This is supported by evidence that sedation with drugs that do not involve GABA receptors is less likely to be accompanied by delirium (44).

#### *Preventive Measures*

The following strategies are available for reducing the risks of oversedation and/or delirium associated with the prolonged use of benzodiazepines:

- 1. Daily interruption of benzodiazepine infusions, known as a "sedation holiday", is an effective measure to hasten weaning from mechanical ventilation [\(4](#page-16-4),45).
- 2. Maintaining light sedation by titrating benzodiazepine dosing to a specific target on one of the sedation scales has been shown to promote weaning from mechanical ventilation and reduce the risk of delirium ([4,](#page-16-4)44).
- 3. Avoiding benzodiazepines for prolonged sedation during mechanical ventilation, if possible, is the recommendation of the most recent guidelines on sedation in the ICU [\(4](#page-16-4)).

## **SEDATION WITH RAPID-AROUSAL AGENTS**

Concerns about the risks associated with benzodiazepines has prompted a shift in attention to two agents that allow rapid arousal from sedation: propofol and dexmedetomidine.

## **Propofol**

Propofol (Deprivan®) is a rapidly-acting, GABAergic sedative that was introduced for the induction of general anesthesia, and has subsequently become a popular agent for sedation during mechanical ventilation. A profile of this drug is presented in [Table](#page-11-0) 6.6

<span id="page-11-0"></span>

|-----------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
|                 | • Propofol Infusion Syndrome      |                                |

**†**Arousal time is influenced by depth of sedation and duration of the infusion (see [Table](#page-13-0) 6.7). Dosing recommendations from Reference 3.

#### *Actions*

Propofol has sedative, amnesic, and anticonvulsant effects, but no analgesic effects (46). A single intravenous bolus produces sedation within 1–2 minutes, and the drug effect lasts 5–8 minutes (46). Prolonged sedation requires a continuous drug infusion, and termination of the infusion can lead to arousal in only 10–15 minutes (46). However, the arousal time is dependent on the depth of sedation and the duration of the continuous infusion. This is demonstrated in [Table](#page-13-0) 6.7, which shows the arousal times in ICU patients who were maintained at different levels of sedation (light or deep sedation) during propofol infusions that varied from one day to 14 days (47). Note that arousal times were longer with deep sedation and longer infusion times, and that the depth of sedation had the most profound effect on the time to arousal. These result highlight the importance of maintaining light sedation with propofol (if possible) to ensure more rapid emergence from sedation.

#### *Preparation and Dosage*

Propofol is suspended in a 10% lipid emulsion to enhance solubility in plasma. This lipid emulsion is almost identical to the 10% lipid formulation used in parenteral nutrition formulas, and it has a caloric density of 1 kcal/mL (which should be included as part of the daily caloric intake). *Propofol dosing is based on ideal rather than actual body weight*, and no dose adjustment is required for renal failure or hepatic insufficiency (46).

## *Adverse Effects*

The most common side effects of propofol are respiratory depression and hypotension ([5,](#page-16-11)48). The risk of respiratory depression mandates that only patients receiving mechanical ventilation can be sedated with propofol. The hypotension is attributed to systemic vasodilation [\(5](#page-16-11)), and can be profound in conditions like hypovolemia and heart failure, where blood pressure is maintained by systemic vasoconstriction. Loading doses of propofol are not advised in patients who are hemodynamically unstable ([3\)](#page-16-2).

Other notable consequences of propofol sedation include hypertriglyceridemia (attributed to the lipid emulsion used to deliver the drug) (48), necrotizing pancreatitis (rare) (49), anaphylactoid reactions (uncommon), a greenish hue in urine (from harmless phenolic metabolites) (46), and the life-threatening condition described next.

**PROPOFOL INFUSION SYNDROME:** Propofol infusion syndrome is an uncommon condition characterized by the abrupt onset of systolic heart failure, unrelenting lactic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and eventual multiorgan failure (50). The etiology is unclear, but may be the result of propofol-induced inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (which produces high-energy ATP molecules). This syndrome typically occurs during high-dose propofol infusions (>80 µg/kg/min, or >5 mg/kg/hr) for longer than 48 hours (51), but it has also been reported at moderate infusion rates (36 µg/kg/min) (52). The prevalence

of this condition is unclear, since many of the manifestations are shared by other severe illnesses, but an incidence of 3% has been reported (52). Management involves general supportive care, and ECMO has been used in a few cases (50). The mortality rate is 30–35% (52,53).

From Reference 47.

## **Dexmedetomidine**

Dexmedetomidine (Precedex®) is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that has sedative, amnesic, and mild analgesic effects, and does not depress ventilation (54). A brief profile of the drug is presented in [Table](#page-11-0) 6.6. The most distinguishing feature of dexmedetomidine is the type of the sedation it produces, which is described next.

#### *Cooperative Sedation*

The sedation produced by dexmedetomidine is unique because *arousal is maintained, despite deep levels of sedation*. Patients can be aroused from sedation without reducing or halting the drug infusion, and when arousal is no longer necessary, the patient will spontaneously return to the prior state of sedation. This has been called *cooperative sedation* ([6\)](#page-16-12), and it is more like a sleep state than the drug-induced stupor produced by the benzodiazepines and propofol. In fact the EEG changes in dexmedetomidine-induced sedation are similar to the changes that occur in natural sleep ([6\)](#page-16-12).

### *Advantages*

Sedation with dexmedetomidine is well-suited for situations where temporary arousal is desirable, such as weaning attempts during mechanical ventilation, or periodic evaluations of mental status in stroke or traumatic brain injury. Other advantages include the following:

- 1. Sedation with dexmedetomidine obviates the need for periodic or daily interruption of sedative infusions (the sedation holiday), thereby allowing patients to be maintained at constant level of sedation.
- 2. Since dexmedetomidine does not depress ventilation, it can be used in patients who are not ventilator-dependent.
- 3. The analgesic effects of dexmedetomidine can be advantageous for reducing opioid requirements (opioid sparing effect).

4. Delirium is less frequent with dexmedetomidine compared to benzodiazepines or propofol (55). In addition, dexmedetomidine is the drug-of-choice for the treatment of ICU-related delirium [\(4](#page-16-4)). This is a significant advantage for dexmedetomidine, since about 40% of ICU patients above the age of 65 will develop delirium (56).

Because of these advantages, dexmedetomidine is steadily growing in popularity for the sedation of critically ill patients, and it is considered superior to benzodiazepines for sedation during mechanical ventilation [\(4](#page-16-4)).

## *Disadvantages*

- 1. Dexmedetomidine produces dose-dependent decreases in heart rate, blood pressure, and circulating norepinephrine levels (sympatholytic effect) ([6\)](#page-16-12), and this effect is particularly marked in conditions where heart rate and blood pressure are supported by increased sympathetic activity; e.g., heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (57).
- 2. Dexmedetomidine can have a withdrawal syndrome characterized by signs of sympathetic overactivity (i.e., tachycardia, hypertension, and agitation) (58). Dexmedetomidine withdrawal is reported in 30% of patients (58), and is unrelated to the infusion rate or duration.

## **ANTIPSYCHOTIC AGENTS**

Several antipsychotic agents are used for sedation in hospitalized patients, including Ziprasidone (Geodon®), quetiapine (Seroquel®), risperidone (Risperdal®), and haloperidol (Haldol®). The following presentation focuses on haloperidol, which is the only antipsychotic agent that can be given intravenously, and has a long history of treating agitation and delirium in hospitalized patients.

## **Haloperidol**

Haloperidol is a dopamine receptor antagonist that promotes sedation without troublesome respiratory depression or cardiovascular compromise (although hypotension is a risk in hypovolemic patients) (59). The principal use of haloperidol has been the treatment of agitation and delirium that are not the result of alcohol or drug withdrawal. As mentioned earlier, dexmedetomidine is considered the drug of choice for hospital-related delirium [\(4](#page-16-4)), but haloperidol still has a role for patients who do not tolerate dexmedetomidine because of bradycardia or hypotension.

## <span id="page-14-0"></span>**TABLE 6.8 Intravenous Halperidol for Sedation†**

- 1. Begin with 5 mg of haloperidol as an intravenous bolus.
- 2. For severely agitated or disruptive patients, add midazolam (1 mg) for a more rapid onset of sedation.
- 3. Wait 15 minutes.
- 4. If no response, double the dose of haloperidol (10 mg IV).
- 5. If no response after the second dose, switch to another agent.
- 6. If the response is satisfactory, maintain sedation with periodic doses of haloperidol (at 25% of the effective dose)

†Do not use if the corrected QT interval (QTc) is >500 msec.

## *Dosing Recommendations*

Haloperidol is given in intravenous bolus doses for the acute management of agitation and delirium. Following a single intravenous dose, the sedative effect begins after 10–20 minutes, and it lasts for 3−4 hours (59).

A dosing regimen for intravenous haloperidol is outlined in [Table](#page-14-0) 6.8. (*Caveat:* Do not use haloperidol if the corrected QT interval (QTc) on the ECG is >500 msec.) The initial dose of haloperidol is typically 5 mg (60). Since haloperidol is not a rapidly-acting drug, midazolam (1−2 mg) can be given with the haloperidol to achieve more rapid control in patients who are severely agitated or disruptive. If the initial dose of haloperidol does not produce the desired level of sedation after 20 minutes, a second dose is given at twice the strength of the initial dose (10 mg). If the second dose of haloperidol is ineffective, then switch to another agent. If the response to haloperidol is satisfactory, then sedation is maintained with periodic doses (at 25% of the effective initial dose) at 4−6 hour intervals (61).

#### *Adverse Effects*

The following are the notable risks associated with haloperidol:

- 1. *Extrapyramidal reactions* (e.g., rigidity, spasmodic movements) are dose-related side effects when haloperidol is given orally, but these reactions *are uncommon when haloperidol is given intravenously* (for unclear reasons) (62).
- 2. The most noted risk with haloperidol is prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG, which can trigger a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia known as *torsade de pointes* (which is described in more detail in Chapter 19). This arrhythmia has been reported in 3–4% of patients who received intravenous haloperidol (63), and most cases occurred when the corrected QT interval (QTc) was >500 msec, or the daily dose of haloperidol exceeded 35 mg. Therefore, a QTc >500 msec is considered a contraindication to intravenous haloperidol.
- 3. One of the more egregious (and often overlooked) complications of haloperidol is the *neuroleptic malignant syndrome*, which is an idiosyncratic reaction that presents with hyperpyrexia, severe muscle rigidity, and rhabdomyolysis. This condition has been reported in ICU patients receiving intravenous haloperidol (64), and it can be fatal if left unnoticed. (See Chapter 43 for a more detailed description of this condition.)

## **A FINAL WORD**

## **From Opiophobia to Opiophilia, and Back Again**

## *Opiophobia*

The term "opiophobia" was introduced in the 1980s (65) to describe the reluctance of physicians to prescribe opioids for pain relief, based on the fear of promoting opioid abuse in the community. The general consensus at that time was that pain was undertreated, and opiophobia

was tagged as the culprit. To correct this, The American Pain Society named pain as the "fifth vital sign" (to increase awareness of untreated pain) (66) and to encourage the use of opioids, emphasis was placed on a single study involving 11,000 patients who received opioids during their hospital stay, which showed that only four of the patients developed an opioid addiction (67). (This study was actually a letter to the editor.)

#### *Opiophilia*

The efforts to encourage opioid use that began in the 1990s were a smashing success, and by 2010, opioid prescription hit a peak of 81 prescription for every 100 Americans (68)! This "opiophilia" has, of course, been blamed for the current "epidemic" of opioid abuse and opioidrelated deaths. In the twenty years from 1999 to 2019, there were an estimated 500,000 deaths from opioid overdose (69). Of interest, opioid prescribing has declined in recent years, but the opioid death toll continues to rise.

#### *Back to Opiophobia*

The current opioid abuse problem has prompted efforts to curb the clinical use of opioids. The aim is to foster a reluctance to prescribe opioids for pain relief, based on the fear of promoting opioid abuse in the community, which is opiophobia (again)! *And so it goes*.
