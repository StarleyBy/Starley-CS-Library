# **Thermoregulatory Disorders**

*Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot that you singe yourself.*

Shakespeare *Henry VIII*

The human body is a metabolic furnace that generates enough heat to raise the body temperature by 1° C every hour, even at rest ([1\)](#page-12-0). Fortunately, the external surface of the body acts like a radiator, and discharges excess heat into the surrounding environment. The behavior of this radiator is guided by a thermostat (the thermoregulatory system) that limits the daily variation in body temperature to ±0.6° C ([2\)](#page-12-1). This chapter describes what happens when this thermostat fails, and allows the body temperature to rise or fall to life-threatening levels.

## **HEAT-RELATED ILLNESS**

## **Hyperthermia vs. Fever**

The distinction between *hyperthermia* and *fever* deserves mention at the outset. Both conditions are characterized by an elevated body temperature, but hyperthermia is the result of a defect in temperature regulation, while fever is the result of a normal thermoregulatory system operating at a higher set point. The elevations in body temperature in this chapter represent hyperthermia, not fever. Because the underlying mechanisms involved in the production of hyperthermia and fever are different, *the antipyretic agents used to treat fever (e.g., acetaminophen) are ineffective in hyperthermia*.

## **Response to Thermal Stress**

The maintenance of body temperature in conditions of thermal stress (e.g., hot weather, strenuous exercise) is primarily achieved by enhanced blood flow to the skin (convective heat loss) and the loss of sweat (evaporative heat loss).

#### *Convective Heat Loss*

When heat is lost from the skin, it warms the air just above the skin surface, and the increase in

surface temperature limits the further loss of body heat by conduction. However, when an air current (e.g., from a fan or gust of wind) is passed across the skin, it displaces the warm layer of air above the skin and replaces it with cooler air, and this process facilitates the continued loss of body heat by conduction. The same effect is produced by increases in blood flow just underneath the skin. The action of currents (air and blood) that promote heat loss is known as *convection*.

#### *Evaporative Heat Loss*

The transformation of water from a liquid to a gas requires heat (called the 'latent heat of vaporization'), and the heat required for the evaporation of sweat from the skin is provided by body heat. The evaporation of one liter of sweat from the skin is accompanied by the loss of 580 kilocalories (kcal) of heat from the body [\(3](#page-12-2)). This is about one-quarter of the daily heat production by an average-sized adult at rest. Thermal sweating (as opposed to "nervous sweating") can achieve rates of 1 to 2 liters per hour [\(3](#page-12-2)), which means that over 1,000 kcal of heat can be lost in one hour during profuse sweating. It is important to emphasize that *sweat must evaporate to ensure loss of body heat. Wiping sweat off the skin will not result in heat loss*, so this practice should be discouraged during strenuous exercise.

## **Syndromes**

Heat-related illnesses are conditions where the thermoregulatory system is no longer able to maintain a constant body temperature in response to thermal stress. There are a number of minor heat-related conditions, such as *heat edema* (dependent soft tissue swelling), *heat cramps* (exercised-induced muscle cramps), and *heat rash* (a papular rash caused by blocked sweat pores) ([4\)](#page-12-3), but the following descriptions are limited to the major heat-related illnesses: *heat exhaustion* and *heat stroke*. The [comparative](#page-1-0) features of these conditions are shown in Table 43.1 ([3–](#page-12-2)[5\)](#page-12-4).

## **Heat Exhaustion**

Patients with heat exhaustion experience flu-like symptoms that include hyperthermia (usually <38–39° C or 100.4–102° F), muscle cramps, nausea and malaise. The hallmark of this condition is *dehydration without signs of hemodynamic compromise*. The volume loss can be accompanied by hypernatremia (from sweat loss) or hyponatremia (when sweat loss is replaced with water

intake). Mentation is usually intact.

The management of heat exhaustion includes volume repletion and other general supportive measures (e.g., placing the subject in an air conditioned room). Active cooling measures are not necessary.

## **Heat Stroke**

Heat stroke is a life-threatening condition characterized by extreme elevations in body temperature (≥41° C [≥106° F]), severe neurologic dysfunction (e.g., delirium, coma, and seizures), severe volume depletion with hypotension, and multiorgan involvement that includes rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), and marked elevation in serum transaminases, presumably from "ischemic hepatitis". The inability to produce sweat (anhidrosis) is a typical, but not universal, feature of heat stroke [\(5](#page-12-4)).

There are two types of heat stroke: (*a*) *classic heat stroke*, which is related to environmental temperatures, and (*b*) *exertional heat stroke*, which is related to strenuous exercise. Exertional heat stroke tends to be more severe, with a higher incidence of multiorgan dysfunction.

#### *Management*

The management of heat stroke includes volume resuscitation and active cooling measures to reduce the body temperature to 38° C (100.4° F).

**EXTERNAL COOLING:** External cooling in the field is best achieved by immersion in cold water or ice water. If these are not available, *evaporative cooling* is effective. This involves spraying the skin with cool water and then fanning the skin to promote evaporation. This method can reduce the body temperature at a rate of 0.3° C (0.6° F) per minute ([6\)](#page-12-5). Evaporative cooling is most effective when the weather is hot and dry (which enhances evaporation from the skin).

External cooling in the emergency department is accomplished by placing ice packs in the groin and axilla, and covering the upper thorax and neck with ice ([7\)](#page-12-6). Cooling blankets are then placed over the entire length of the body.

The major drawback of external cooling is the risk of shivering, which is counter-productive because it raises the body temperature.

**INTERNAL COOLING:** Internal cooling can be achieved with intravenous infusion of cold saline (4° C). Faster cooling has been reported with automated intravascular cooling devices [\(8](#page-12-7)) (i.e., the ones used for targeted temperature management in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest), but this approach requires central venous access, and the impact on outcomes has not been adequately studied.

## **Rhabdomyolysis**

Skeletal muscle injury (rhabdomyolysis) is a common complication of hyperthermia syndromes, including heat stroke and the drug-induced hyperthermia syndromes (described later in the chapter). Disruption of myocytes in skeletal muscle leads to the release of creatine kinase (CK) into the bloodstream, and the measurement of CK levels in plasma is used to determine the presence and severity of rhabdomyolysis. There is no standard plasma CK level for the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis, but levels that are at least five times normal have been suggested [\(9](#page-12-8)).

The adverse consequence of rhabdomyolysis are muscle weakness and acute kidney injury. The latter condition is the result of renal tubular injury from the myoglobin released by disrupted myocytes ([10\)](#page-12-9). The acute kidney injury from rhabdomyolysis is described in Chapter 34, along with the management of rhabdomyolysis.

## **DRUG-INDUCED HYPERTHERMIA SYNDROMES**

Hyperthermia can also be a drug-related disorder, and three drug-related hyperthermia syndromes are recognized:

- 1. Malignant Hyperthermia
- 2. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome
- 3. Serotonin Syndrome

Each of these is briefly described in this section.

## **Malignant Hyperthermia**

The relevant features of malignant hyperthermia (MH) are summarized in [Table](#page-3-0) 43.2. This condition is a rare inherited disorder with an autosomal dominant pattern that affects about 1 in 50,000 adults [\(11](#page-12-10)). It is characterized by excessive release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscle in response to halogenated inhalational anesthetic agents (e.g., halothane, isoflurane) and depolarizing neuromuscular blockers (e.g., succinylcholine) [\(11](#page-12-10)).

## <span id="page-3-0"></span>**TABLE 43.2 Malignant Hyperthermia**

#### *Predisposing Conditions:*

A susceptible patient who has received:

- 1. A halogenated volatile anesthetic agent (e.g., halothane) or
- 2. A depolarizing neuromuscular blocker (e.g., succinylcholine)

#### *Clinical Presentation:*

- 1. Muscle rigidity
- 2. Increase in temp to ≥40° C
- 3. Altered mentation
- 4. Autonomic instability

#### *Management:*†

- 1. Dantrolene:
  - a. 1–2 mg/kg as a rapid IV bolus, and repeat every few minutes until symptoms resolve or the cumulative dose reaches 10 mg/kg.
  - b. Follow with oral or IV doses of 1–2 mg/kg every 6 hours for at least 24 hrs (to prevent recurrence).
- 2. Aggressive fluid infusion may be necessary for autonomic instability or rhabdomyolysis.

<sup>†</sup>Advice for acute management is available on the Malignant Hyperthermia Hotline: 1-800-644-9737. Dantrolene dosing regimen from Reference 13.

### *Clinical Manifestations*

The first sign of MH may be a sudden and unexpected rise in end-tidal PCO<sup>2</sup> ([11,](#page-12-10)[12\)](#page-12-11), which is a reflection of the increased metabolic rate caused by calcium-induced uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. This is followed (within minutes to a few hours) by muscle rigidity, which can begin in the masseter muscle before it becomes generalized. The heat generated by the combination of the hypermetabolism and muscle rigidity results in a marked rise in body temperature (often >40° C or 104° F), which generally occurs later in the presentation [\(12](#page-12-11)).

Neurologic dysfunction is commonplace in MH, with altered mentation (e.g., confusion, delirium, coma) and autonomic instability (e.g., fluctuating blood pressure, tachycardia). Rhabdomyolysis is also common, and can be accompanied by acute kidney injury from myoglobinuria.

#### *Management*

The first suspicion of MH should prompt immediate discontinuation of the offending anesthetic agent.

**DANTROLENE:** Specific treatment for the muscle rigidity is available with *dantrolene* sodium, a muscle relaxant that blocks the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. When given early in the course of MH, dantrolene can reduce the mortality rate from ≥70% (in untreated cases) to ≤10% [\(11](#page-12-10)[,12](#page-12-11)). The dosing regimen for dantrolene is shown in [Table](#page-3-0) 43.2 ([13\)](#page-12-12).

The most common side effect of dantrolene is muscle weakness, particularly grip strength, which usually resolves in 2 to 4 days after the drug is discontinued [\(13](#page-12-12)). The most troublesome side effect is hepatocellular injury, which is a risk with oral dantrolene, but requires months of treatment [\(13](#page-12-12)).

**OTHER CONCERNS:** Aggressive fluid infusion may be necessary for autonomic instability or rhabdomyolysis. If rhabdomyolysis develops, vigilance for hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury is necessary. Control of the rigidity should reduce the body temperature, and active cooling measures are usually not necessary.

*Note:* There is a Malignant Hyperthermia Hotline (1-800-644-9737) that provides advice for the acute management of MH.

## *Followup*

All patients who survive an episode of MH should be given a medical bracelet that identifies their susceptibility to MH. In addition, because MH is a genetic disorder with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, immediate family members should be informed of their possible susceptibility to MH. (For testing options, see the website for the Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States – [mhaus.org.](http://mhaus.org))

## **Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome**

The neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is similar to MH in that it is a drug-induced disorder characterized by hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, and altered mentation [\(14](#page-12-13)[,15](#page-12-14)).

## *Pathogenesis*

NMS is the result of a decrease in dopamine-mediated transmission in the basal ganglia and hypothalamic-pituitary axis [\(14](#page-12-13)). As indicated in [Table](#page-5-0) 43.3, NMS can be caused by drugs that inhibit dopaminergic transmission (most cases), or it can be triggered by discontinuing drugs that *facilitate* dopaminergic transmission. The drug most frequently implicated in NMS is *haloperidol* ([14\)](#page-12-13).

<sup>†</sup>Discontinuing these drugs can trigger the neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

Despite the association with certain drugs, NMS appears in fewer than 1% of patients treated with high-risk drugs [\(15](#page-12-14)), and there is no relationship between drug doses and the appearance of NMS ([14\)](#page-12-13). It is thus an idiosyncratic reaction, rather than a dose-dependent toxic reaction.

#### *Clinical Features*

Most cases of NMS begin to appear 24 to 72 hours after the initiation of drug therapy, and almost all cases are apparent in the first 2 weeks of drug therapy. The onset is usually gradual, and the initial manifestations are muscle rigidity and agitation or confusion [\(14](#page-12-13)). The increase in body temperature can be delayed for 8 to 10 hours after the onset of muscle rigidity ([16\)](#page-12-15). Autonomic hyperreactivity is also common, and can produce tachycardia and diaphoresis ([15\)](#page-12-14). Severe cases are characterized by *lead-pipe rigidity*, rhabdomyolysis, and depressed consciousness.

Dystonic reactions, which are common complications of neuroleptic agents, can be difficult to distinguish from NMS, especially in the early stage of NMS, when muscle rigidity may be the only manifestation. The plasma level of creatine kinase (CK) can help in this regard, because plasma CK levels are only mildly elevated in dystonic reactions, but are typically higher than 1,000 Units/L in NMS ([17\)](#page-12-16).

#### *Management*

The single most important therapeutic measure is *immediate* removal of the offending drug. If NMS is caused by discontinuation of dopaminergic drugs, the drug should be restarted immediately, with gradual reduction of the drug dosage at a later time. General measures for NMS can include the following [\(15](#page-12-14)):

- 1. Aggressive fluid infusion may be necessary for patients with rhabdomyolysis or hypotension.
- 2. External cooling may be needed to reduce the body temperature, but control of the muscle

rigidity usually corrects the problem [\(15](#page-12-14)).

- 3. Prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism is mandatory, because there is an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis in NMS ([14\)](#page-12-13).
- 4. Benzodiazepines are often used in patients who are agitated [\(15](#page-12-14)[,17](#page-12-16)).

Management of the muscle rigidity is possible with the following drugs:

**BROMOCRIPTINE:** Bromocriptine mesylate is a dopamine agonist that has been successful in treating NMS when given orally in a dose of 10 mg three times daily ([15\)](#page-12-14). Some improvement in muscle rigidity can be seen within hours after the start of therapy, but the *full response often takes days to develop* [\(18](#page-12-17)). Hypotension and hallucinations are troublesome side effects [\(15](#page-12-14)).

**DANTROLENE:** Dantrolene (the same muscle relaxant used in the treatment of MH) can be used for severe cases of NMS (when a more rapid response is desirable), although the success in clinical trials has been inconsistent ([15\)](#page-12-14). The optimal dosing regimen is not clearly defined, but one suggested regimen is as follows ([15\)](#page-12-14):

- 1. Start with IV dantrolene in a bolus dose of 1 mg/kg every 8 hours, until symptoms resolve, or the cumulative dose reaches 10 mg/kg.
- 2. Follow the initial regimen with oral dantrolene in a daily dose of 50–200 mg given in 3–4 divided doses.

Treatment of NMS should continue for about 10 days after clinical resolution because of delayed clearance of many neuroleptics. When depot preparations are implicated, therapy should continue for 2 to 3 weeks after clinical resolution ([14\)](#page-12-13).

## **Serotonin Syndrome**

Overstimulation of serotonin receptors in the central nervous systems produces a variety of neurologic abnormalities that make up what is known as the *serotonin syndrome* ([19\)](#page-12-18). This syndrome has received much more attention in recent years, thanks to the popularity of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for the treatment of depression.

antidepressants.

#### *Pathogenesis*

Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that participates in sleep-wakefulness cycles, mood, and thermoregulation. A variety of drugs can enhance serotonin neurotransmission and thereby promote the serotonin syndrome, and a list of these drugs is shown in [Table](#page-6-0) 43.4. Many of these drugs are mood enhancers, including illegal substances like "ecstasy", an amphetamine derivative implicated in life-threatening cases of SS ([20\)](#page-12-19). Note also that fentanyl and linezolid (two drugs used in the care of ICU patients) are capable of causing NMS. The serotonin syndrome occurs most often when two serotonergic drugs are used together.

## *Clinical Manifestations*

The clinical features of serotonin syndrome (SS) can be placed in three categories: motor hyperactivity, adrenergic hyperactivity, and altered mentation. This is shown in [Table](#page-7-0) 43.5, along with the frequency of clinical manifestations in each category [\(21](#page-12-20)). The following points about the clinical presentation of SS deserve mention:

- 1. The clinical features that are most specific for SS are hyperreflexia, myoclonus, and clonus (spontaneous or inducible) ([21,](#page-12-20)22).
- 2. Although infrequent, *ocular clonus (spontaneous horizontal eye movements) is considered the most reliable clinical finding for the diagnosis of SS* (22).
- 3. Mild cases of SS are often characterized by hyperreflexia, tachycardia, and agitation. Muscle rigidity appears in more severe cases, and can mask the more specific manifestations of SS (e.g., hyperreflexia).
- 4. Although hyperthermia is considered one of the hallmarks of SS, elevated body temperatures are reported in only 60% of cases [\(21](#page-12-20)).
- 5. Rhabdomyolysis is reported in 15% of cases of SS ([21\)](#page-12-20), and usually appears along with muscle rigidity.

| Category                  | Manifestations                                                                          |
| Motor Hyperactivity       |                                                                                         |

|                   | Confusion (64%) |
|                   | Coma (11%)      |

The frequency of clinical manifestation (in parentheses) are from Reference 21. (\*) Clinical findings that are the most specific for serotonin syndrome.

**SS VERSUS NMS:** Many of the clinical features of SS are similar to NMS: i.e., both are characterized by muscle rigidity, altered mental status, increased body temperature, and adrenergic hyperactivity. The distinguishing features of SS are the hyperreflexia and clonus, but severe cases of SS (where muscle rigidity predominates and can mask the hyperreflexia and clonus) can be difficult to distinguish from NMS [\(15](#page-12-14)). A careful drug history is often helpful, although these two conditions share some of the causative agents.

#### *Management*

As in other drug-induced hyperthermia syndromes, removal of the precipitating drug(s) is the single most important therapeutic measure in SS. The general supportive measures in SS are the same as described for NMS. Most cases of SS resolve within days with general supportive care. Severe cases of SS can benefit from a serotonin antagonist like cyproheptadine.

**CYPROHEPTADINE:** Cyproheptadine is a serotonin antagonist that is available for oral administration only, but tablets can be broken up and administered through a nasogastric tube. The initial dose is 12 mg, followed by 2 mg every 2 hrs for persistent symptoms, and the maintenance dose is 8 mg every 6 hours [\(15](#page-12-14)). This drug is sedating, but that can benefit the agitation in SS.

**PARALYSIS:** Severe rigidity and rhabdomyolysis that does not improve with conventional measures may require neuromuscular paralysis with a nondepolarizing agent (e.g., rocuronium).

## **HYPOTHERMIA**

Hypothermia is defined as a body temperature <35° C (<95° F), and can be either primary (i.e., the result of environmental conditions), secondary (i.e., triggered by illness or trauma), or therapeutic (i.e., targeted temperature management). The focus of this section is primary (environmental) hypothermia.

## **Pathogenesis**

Physiologically, the human body is better equipped to survive in hot rather than cold environments. The physiological response to cold includes *cutaneous vasoconstriction* (to reduce convective heat loss) and *shivering* (which can double metabolic heat production), but these physiological responses provide protection only in the early stages of hypothermia. Instead, the behavioral responses to cold (e.g., wearing warm clothing or seeking shelter from the cold) play a major role in the adaptation to cold.

## **Predisposing Conditions**

Environmental hypothermia is most likely to occur in the following situations:

- 1. Immersion in cold water (<15° C or <59° F) can be fatal after 30 minutes (23), because heat loss to cold water occurs much more rapidly than heat loss to cold air. This is also why exposure to cold in wet clothing predisposes to hypothermia.
- 2. Windy conditions promote hypothermia in cold environments, because wind promotes heat loss by convection (as described earlier). This is the basis for the wind-chill index, which describes the combined effect of ambient temperature and wind speed on the temperature at the skin surface (24).
- 3. Hpothermia is a risk when the behavioral responses to cold are impaired; e.g., by alcohol or drug intoxication.

## **Clinical Presentation**

The clinical manifestations in progressive hypothermia are summarized in [Table](#page-9-0) 43.6 (23,25).

#### *Mild Hypothermia*

Mild hypothermia is defined as a body temperature of 32–35° C (90–95° F). At this stage, patients are often confused, but they shows signs of adaptation to cold; i.e., the skin is pale and cold from cutaneous vasoconstriction, and shivering is brisk. Tachycardia also predominates at this stage, and the blood pressure can be elevated (26).

## *Moderate Hypothermia*

Patients with moderate hyperthermia (i.e., 28–31.9° C or 82–89.9° F) are lethargic, and shivering may be present if the body temperature is above 30° C (23). Bradycardia and a decreased respiratory rate (bradypnea) predominate at temperatures below 32° C (26).

### *Severe Hypothermia*

Patients with severe hypothermia (<28° C or <82° F) are usually obtunded or comatose, and have dilated, fixed pupils. Additional findings include hypotension, severe bradycardia, oliguria, and generalized edema.

Apnea and asystole are expected at body temperatures below 24° C (75° F), but *the diagnosis*

*of death cannot be made in the setting of hypothermia* (25,26). The body must be warmed to a normal temperature before the pronouncement of death. (See also the brain death determination in Chapter 45).

## **Diagnostic Evaluation**

Exposure to a cold environment results in skin temperatures that are lower than interior (core) temperatures, so peripheral temperature measurements (i.e., oral, axillary, temporal artery, and tympanic temperatures) are not appropriate in hypothermic patients (27). Core temperature measurements are advised, using bladder, esophageal, or rectal probes.

#### *Laboratory Evaluation*

The following points deserve mention concerning the laboratory evaluation of hypothermic patients:

- 1. Arterial blood gas measurements (which are performed at 37° C) should be adjusted to the patient's body temperature (26). In moderate-to-severe hypothermia, expect a combined respiratory and metabolic acidosis.
- 2. Serum electrolytes can reveal hyperkalemia, from potassium release by skeletal muscle, as a result of shivering and/or rhabdomyolysis.
- 3. Serum creatinine levels can be elevated as a result of rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, or *cold diuresis* (caused by diminished renal tubular responsiveness to antidiuretic hormone).
- 4. A generalized coagulopathy (i.e., thrombocytopenia, and prolongation of the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin times) is common at temperatures below 34° C (93° F) (26), but may not be evident if the coagulation profile is run at normal body temperatures (28).

## *Electrocardiogram*

The electrocardiogram in hypothermia can show positive J (Osborn) waves at the junction between the QRS complex and the ST segment (see [Figure](#page-11-0) 43.1), especially in leads II and V6 (26). These *Osborn waves* are not specific for hypothermia, and can occur with hypercalcemia, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral injuries, and myocardial ischemia (29). Despite the attention these waves have received, they are merely a curiosity, and have little or no diagnostic or prognostic value in hypothermia.

**ARRHYTHMIAS:** The threshold for atrial and ventricular arrhythmias is reduced at temperatures below 32° C (90° F), and there is also a progressive bradycardia at temperatures <32° C that is resistant to atropine. Finally, there is a risk of ventricular fibrillation and asystole at temperatures below 28° C (82.4° F) (26).

## **Rewarming**

There are several approaches to rewarming, depending on the severity of the hypothermia.

## *External Rewarming*

External rewarming is adequate for most cases of hypothermia Passive rewarming (e.g., removing wet clothes, covering the patient in blankets) prevents heat loss, and allows the patient's body to rewarm physiologically. Active warming (e.g., with heating pads or automated warming systems) prevents heat loss and accelerates warming.

#### *Internal Rewarming*

Internal rewarming is generally reserved for severe cases of hypothermia where active external warming is ineffective. The following are some relevant points about internal rewarming:

- 1. For intubated patients, heating the inhaled gases to 40–45° C (104–113° F) can raise the core temperature 2.5° C per hour (28).
- 2. Heated IV fluids prevent further cooling, but they do not promote rewarming (23).
- 3. Internal rewarming methods that are not recommended include gastric lavage with heated fluid (risk of aspiration), and warmed bladder lavage (ineffective) (23).
- 4. For hypothermic cardiac arrest, venoarterial ECMO has been used successfully (30).

#### *Volume Resuscitation*

Patients with moderate-to-severe hypothermia are often volume depleted (from cold diuresis), and the vasodilation that accompanies rewarming promotes hypotension. Therefore, attention to fluid infusion is needed during the rewarming process. However, the infusion of fluids at room temperature (21° C or 70° F) promotes further cooling, so the infused fluids should be heated.

Patients who are refractory to volume infusion should be considered for venoarterial ECMO, if available.

## **A FINAL WORD**

## **The Adaptable Human**

One of the notable features of heat-related illness and accidental hypothermia is the relatively low number of fatalities. For example, there were an average of 702 deaths yearly in the United States from heat-related illness over the years from 2004 to 2018 (31), compared to 695,000 deaths yearly from heart disease (32), and a 10-year survey in New York City (from 2009 to 2019) showed only 139 deaths from hypothermia, with an annualized death rate of 1.7 per million (33). These relatively small numbers are a testament to the ability of humans to adapt (both physiologically and behaviorally) to environmental extremes.
