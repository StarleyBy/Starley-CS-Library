# **Acute Pulmonary Embolism**

*Doubt is not a pleasant condition, but certainty is absurd.*

Voltaire

Venous thromboembolism (i.e., deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) is cited as the third leading cause of cardiovascular deaths worldwide (behind myocardial infarction and stroke) ([1\)](#page-11-0), and has an annual risk of almost 10% in adults over the age of 45 ([2\)](#page-11-1). There is a heightened risk of VTE in ICU patients, which mandates the preventive measures for VTE described in Chapter 5. This chapter focuses on the condition that is responsible for the life-threatening potential of VTE; i.e., acute pulmonary embolism.

There are two features of pulmonary embolism that deserve emphasis at the outset. First, pulmonary embolism is more common than suspected; e.g., autopsy studies in hospitalized patients report the presence pulmonary emboli in as many as 30% of patients ([3\)](#page-11-2), and in most of these cases, the condition was not suspected prior to death. Second, the clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism is confirmed by diagnostic testing in as few as 10% of cases [\(4](#page-11-3)). These observations indicate that *pulmonary embolism suffers from both underdiagnosis and excessive diagnostic testing* (a rather unique pairing). This conundrum is adequately summarized in the following statement:

The one certainty surrounding the issue of thromboembolism diagnosis in critically ill patients is that considerable uncertainty remains [\(5\)](#page-11-4).

The emphasis in this chapter is on acute pulmonary embolism that requires admission to an ICU, or develops during the ICU stay. Many of the recommendations in the chapter are based on clinical practice guidelines, which are listed in the bibliography at the end of the chapter (6–9).

# **CLINICAL EVALUATION**

The diagnostic problems mentioned in the introduction are explained by the clinical manifestations of acute pulmonary embolism, which are neither sensitive nor specific (see next).

# **Clinical Presentation**

The typical presentation of acute pulmonary embolism (acute PE) is a patient with dyspnea, tachycardia, and hypoxemia, but these are signs of cardiopulmonary disease, and do not implicate an acute PE. The common manifestations of acute PE are listed in [Table](#page-1-0) 22.1, along with the predictive value of each for the likelihood of disease (10). Note that none of the findings provides more than a 50% chance of identifying an acute PE (i.e., the positive predictive value), and that the absence of these findings does not exclude an acute PE (i.e., a negative predictive value of ≥98% is used to exclude the presence of a condition). Of particular interest is the negative predictive value of 70% for hypoxemia, which means that *30% of patients with an acute PE have a normal arterial PO<sup>2</sup>* . The alveolar–arterial PO<sup>2</sup> (A-a PO<sup>2</sup> ) gradient can also be normal in acute PE (11).

<sup>†</sup>Positive predictive value is the percentage of patients with the finding who have a pulmonary embolus.

Less common manifestations of acute PE include fever (15% of cases), which is usually below 102° F (12), and syncope (10% of cases), which is often associated with right heart strain (13). However, neither of these manifestations is specific for acute PE. Also worthy of mention, acute PE can be the cause of an acute exacerbation of COPD in a small percentage (<10%) of cases (14).

#### *Predisposing Factors*

Because the clinical manifestations of acute PE are non-specific, the presence or absence of predisposing factors for venous thrombosis is used to determine the probability that an acute PE is present (and hence the need for diagnostic testing). These predisposing factors are presented in Chapter 5, and will not be repeated here. However, all patients who spend more than a few days in the ICU should be considered at-risk for venous thrombosis (and hence acute PE), and this risk is especially high in postoperative patients and those with spinal cord injuries or multisystem trauma.

<sup>‡</sup>Negative predictive value is the percentage of patients without the finding who do not have a pulmonary embolus. From Reference 10.

# **D-Dimer Assay**

Active thrombosis is accompanied by some degree of clot lysis, and this produces cross-linked fibrin monomers, also called fibrin D-dimers, or simply *D-dimers*. Plasma D-dimer levels are elevated in the presence of acute thrombosis, and the D-dimer assay has become a popular tool for determining the probability of an acute PE.

#### *Predictive Value*

D-dimer levels have a positive predictive value of 27%, and a negative predictive value of 92% (15), which means that an elevated D-dimer level does not indicate a high probability of acute PE, but a normal D-dimer level is evidence against the presence of acute PE (and venous thrombosis). There are several conditions other than thrombosis that elevate D-dimer levels, including sepsis, inflammatory conditions, heart failure, renal failure, pregnancy, and advanced age (15). This would explain why a majority (up to 80%) of ICU patients have elevated plasma D-dimer levels (16), and for this reason, the D-dimer assay is not considered a useful diagnostic test in the ICU setting.

### **Summary**

There are no clinical or laboratory findings that predict the presence of a pulmonary emboli with certainty, and the suspicion of acute PE is usually based on the presence of predisposing factors, and the absence of evidence for other conditions that could be responsible for the clinical presentation. Unfortunately, this is a flawed practice, since pulmonary emboli are found in as few as 10% of the diagnostic imaging studies obtained for suspected PE [\(4](#page-11-3)).

# **DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING**

The imaging methods in [Table](#page-2-0) 22.2 are used to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of acute PE. The following is a brief description of each method.

# **Venous Ultrasound**

Most pulmonary emboli originate from deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the thigh and groin (6), so the evaluation of suspected PE can begin with a bedside ultrasound examination of the proximal leg veins. Venous ultrasound is advantageous in patients who are not suitable candidates for the other imaging methods (see later), and it is appealing in ICU patients because it eliminates the risk associated with transport to the radiology suite.

### *Methodology*

Venous ultrasound is described in Chapter 1. There are two methods for identifying venous thrombosis. The principal method is *compression ultrasound*, where a compressive force is applied to a vein that is situated under the ultrasound probe. This normally compresses the vein and obliterates the lumen, (see Figure 1.7), but veins that are filled with thrombi will not compress. Therefore, an incompressible vein is used as evidence of venous thrombosis (17).

The *color Doppler mode* of ultrasound can be used as an adjunct to venous compression. This method converts flow velocities into color images, and the flow in arteries and veins can be identified by the direction of flow in relation to the ultrasound probe (see Figure 1.8). Venous thrombosis is then characterized by sluggish or absent flow in an incompressible vein. The combination of compression and color Doppler ultrasound is known as *duplex ultrasound*.

#### *Test Performance*

For the detection of proximal DVT in the legs, duplex ultrasound has a sensitivity ≥95%, a specificity ≥97%, a positive predictive value of 97%, and a negative predictive value of 98% (17). These numbers indicate that duplex ultrasound is a reliable method for the detection of proximal DVT in the legs.

Clinical studies have shown that 30–50% of patients with acute PE will have ultrasound evidence of proximal DVT in the legs (6,18). When DVT is detected by ultrasound, no further workup for pulmonary emboli is necessary (unless the patient is hemodynamically unstable), and anticoagulation is started using the same regimens used for acute PE. (Anticoagulation for DVT and PE differs only in the duration of treatment.) When venous ultrasound is unrevealing, another diagnostic imaging test is required.

# *Upper Extremity DVT*

Thrombosis in the axillary and subclavian veins can develop as a result of indwelling central venous catheters. Upper extremity DVT does not frequently result in symptomatic acute PE (<10% of cases) (19), but inspection for swelling of the upper arms is warranted in patients with indwelling central venous catheters. Venous ultrasound is reliable for the detection of upper extremity DVT, with a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 96% (19). A positive study warrants anticoagulation and immediate removal of the responsible catheter ([Table](#page-2-0) 22.2.).

### **CT Pulmonary Angiography**

The diagnostic test of choice for acute PE is computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) (6–9), which has replaced conventional pulmonary angiography. This is a specialized method of CT that uses a spiral or helical scanner that rotates around the patient to produce a "volumetric" two-dimensional view of the lungs. When multidetector scanners are used, peripheral injection of a radiocontrast agent allows visualization of the pulmonary arteries down to the subsegmental level. Pulmonary emboli appear as filling defects, as shown in [Figure](#page-4-0) 22.1.

<span id="page-4-0"></span>![](_page_4_Figure_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 22.1** CT pulmonary angiogram showing a pulmonary embolus, which appears as a filling defect in the left main pulmonary artery. AO = aorta, PA = pulmonary artery. Image digitally retouched

Multidetector CTPA has a negative predictive value of 95% (20), which means a normal CTPA essentially eliminates the possibility of acute PE.

### *Subsegmental Emboli*

The detection of pulmonary emboli on CTPA usually prompts immediate anticoagulant therapy, but there is some evidence that small emboli in subsegmental arteries (<2.5 mm in diameter) may not require anticoagulation. An analysis of the pooled results of 14 clinical studies showed that withholding anticoagulation in patients with subsegmental emboli and no evidence of DVT had no significant influence on mortality rate or recurrence rate for PE (21). However, a more recent study showed that withholding anticoagulation was not detrimental if there was a single subsegmental embolus, but if there were multiple subsegmental emboli, the recurrence rate for PE was much higher without anticoagulation (22).

**WHAT TO DO:** Based on the available studies, it seems reasonable to withhold anticoagulation for

subsegmental pulmonary emboli if the following conditions are satisfied: 1) there is a single subsegmental embolus, 2) there is no residual clot burden in the legs (by venous ultrasound), 3) there is no evidence of RV dysfunction, and 4) there are no significant co-morbidities (e.g., hypoxemia).

#### *Adverse Effects*

The major concern with CTPA is the risk of nephrotoxicity from the radiocontrast dye. Predisposing factors include renal insufficiency, diabetes, and volume depletion. The current recommendation is to avoid radiocontrast dye, if possible, when renal function is unstable, or the creatinine clearance is <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (23). If CTPA is considered necessary, protection from dye-induced nephropathy is possible with a regimen of volume infusion and intravenous Nacetylcysteine (24). (See Chapter 34 for more on dye-induced nephropathy.) CTPA is also contraindicated in patients with a history of dye-induced anaphylaxis.

**RADIATION EXPOSURE:** An undesirable feature of CTPA that is often overlooked is the relatively high radiation exposure, which averages 15 millisieverts (mSv) per procedure (25). To place this in perspective, the average radiation exposure from a chest x-ray (single view) is 0.02 mSv (25), and the annual radiation limit for workers is 50 mSv (26). Because of the radiation dose, alternatives to CTPA should be considered during pregnancy and breast feeding (6). (Appendix 2 contains a table that lists the radiation dose of common radiographic procedures.)

# **Lung Scintigraphy**

Radionuclide ventilation-perfusion scans (V/Q scans) were popular prior to the introduction of CT pulmonary angiography. However, they are no longer favored because the presence of lung disease (particularly infiltrative disease) produces abnormal scans. As a result, V/Q scans have diagnostic value in only 20–30% of cases (27). They are most reliable in younger patients with no underlying lung disease (which excludes most ICU patients, and have a much lower radiation exposure (~2 mSv) than CTPA studies.

The major role of V/Q scans is in cases of suspected PE where CT angiography is not performed (e.g., because of renal failure or a history of dye-induced anaphylaxis). V/Q scans have three possible results (6):

- 1. A normal V/Q scan has no ventilation or perfusion defects, and excludes the diagnosis of acute PE.
- 2. A high probability V/Q scan has perfusion defects without associated ventilation defects, and confirms the diagnosis of acute PE.
- 3. An indeterminate V/Q scan has matching ventilation and perfusion defects, and can neither exclude nor confirm the diagnosis of acute PE.

About three-quarters of V/Q scans are indeterminate, which has no diagnostic value, but the combination of an indeterminate scan and a negative venous ultrasound study can be used to exclude the diagnosis of acute PE, but only in patients who are hemodynamically stable (6).

# **Echocardiography**

Transthoracic echocardiography is typically obtained after the diagnosis of acute PE has been confirmed, to look for signs of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction (see Figure 18.2). Evidence of right heart strain (i.e., RV dilation with elevated troponin levels) has prognostic significance in acute PE, but has no diagnostic significance (i.e., is not specific for PE).

#### *Diagnostic Aids*

There are two findings on transthoracic cardiac ultrasound that are specific for acute PE:

- 1. Mobile thrombi in the right heart have been reported in 2–18% of patients with acute PE (28,29), and are more prevalent in cases of massive PE (28).
- 2. Akinesis of the free wall of the RV, combined with normal motion at the apex (called McConnell's sign) is considered specific for acute PE (30), and is reported in 20% of cases (28).

These two findings are relatively infrequent, but they add diagnostic value to cardiac ultrasound in cases where the other imaging modalities are nondiagnostic.

# **MANAGEMENT**

The early management of acute PE is organized according to a risk stratification system (based on the risk of an unfavorable outcome) that has three levels of illness severity:

- 1. Low-risk PE: No right ventricular dysfunction, hemodynamic instability, or significant comorbid conditions (e.g., hypoxemia).
- 2. Intermediate-risk PE: (Also known as submassive PE) Evidence of right ventricular dysfunction (with or without elevated troponin levels), but no hemodynamic instability.
- 3. High-risk PE: (Also known as massive PE.) Evidence of right heart strain (RV dysfunction plus elevated troponin levels) with hemodynamic instability.

The antithrombotic strategies for each risk level are summarized in [Table](#page-6-0) 22.3.

- b. Check PTT at 6 hrs, and adjust dose to a target PTT of 46–70 sec.
- 2. Initiate thrombolytic therapy as soon as possible (if no contraindications). The recommended drug regimens are:
  - a. Alteplase (tPA): 100 mg infused over 2 hrs.
  - b. For impending cardiovascular collapse, give 0.6 mg/kg over 15 minutes (max = 50 mg).
- 3. If the condition does not improve, consider catheter-directed thrombolysis or embolectomy.

# **Low-Risk PE**

Oral anticoagulation (started as soon as possible after the diagnosis) is suitable for low-risk PE, and the direct-acting oral anticoagulants DOACs) are preferred to warfarin for reasons explained in Chapter 19. The drug regimens with documented success in treating venous thromboembolism are *rivaroxaban* in a dose of 15 mg twice daily for 3 weeks, then 20 mg once daily (31) and *apixaban* in a dose of 10 mg twice daily for 7 days, then 5 mg twice daily (32). The starting dose for both of these drugs is higher than usual (see Table 19.3), but there is no increase in the risk of bleeding.

DOACs are not recommended when renal function is impaired and the creatinine clearance is ≤30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (6). (*Note:* 1.73 m2 is the body surface area of an average-sized adult.) In this situation, warfarin is the recommended oral anticoagulant. However, at least 2–3 days are required to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation after starting warfarin, and reduced-dose enoxaparin (i.e., 1 mg/kg once daily) is recommended for maintaining anticoagulation until the INR reaches the therapeutic range (6). Enoxaparin can be used down to a CrCL of 15 mL/min (33).

Finally, since oral anticoagulants are used for low-risk PE, and the drug effect is not monitored, patients can be discharged (from the emergency department or the hospital) if there are no significant co-morbidities (e.g., hypoxemia).

### **Intermediate-Risk PE**

Because patients with intermediate-risk PE have some degree of RV dysfunction, and may have right heart strain (i.e., RV dysfunction plus elevated troponins) (34), they are monitored in the hospital for 24–48 hours for signs of hemodynamic deterioration. During this time, enoxaparin is recommended for anticoagulation (6), using a dose of 1 mg/kg every 12 hours. If there is no deterioration after the observation period, oral anticoagulation can be started, using the drugs and dosing regimens recommended for low-risk PE.

Thrombolytic therapy is not officially recommended for intermediate-risk PE, but it has been used (by this author and others) in cases of severe RV dysfunction or unresolving right-heart strain (i.e., RV dysfunction plus elevated troponin levels). Studies in patients with PE and right heart strain have shown that thrombolytic therapy reduces the risk of cardiovascular decompensation, but is also increases the risk of serious bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage (see later). The risk of bleeding, more than lack of a hemodynamic benefit, has discouraged the use of thrombolytic therapy in hemodynamically stable cases of PE.

# **High-Risk RE**

High-risk PE is a life-threatening condition, with severe RV dysfunction leading to

hemodynamic instability. The principal goals of management are reperfusion of the pulmonary circulation and hemodynamic improvement.

### *Anticoagulation*

Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is recommended for early anticoagulation in high-risk patients using the weight-based dosing regimen in [Table](#page-6-0) 22.3 (which uses actual body weight) 6). Weight-based dosing achieves more rapid anticoagulation than fixed dosing (35). As always with unfractionated heparin, therapy is aimed at achieving an activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 46–70 seconds, or 1.5 to 2.5 times control. (Most ICUs have a heparin dosing guideline.) Heparin is continued through thrombolytic therapy until the condition improves or stabilizes.

**HEPARIN DOSING IN OBESITY:** The popular weight-based dosing regimen for heparin was derived in patients weighing less than 130 kg (286 lbs). For body weights in excess of 130 kg, this regimen will overestimate the heparin dose and promote excessive anticoagulation (36). To avoid this problem, the adjusted body weight shown here is recommended for weight-based heparin dosing in patients with morbid obesity (i.e., a body mass index ≥40 kg/m2) (37).

Adjusted Weight (kg) = IBW + 
$$0.4 \times$$
 (actual – ideal body weight) (22.1)

where IBW = ideal body weight. (Appendix 2 has a table of ideal body weights in adults). The adjusted body weight is almost halfway between the ideal and actual body weights.

### *Thrombolytic Therapy*

Thrombolytic therapy is recommended for all patients with high-risk PE and hemodynamic instability. Absolute contraindications to thrombolytic therapy include active bleeding, a prior hemorrhagic stroke, an ischemic stroke within the past 6 months, central nervous system neoplasm, and major trauma, surgery, or head injury in the past 3 weeks (6).

**DRUG REGIMEN:** The recommended drug regimen is alteplase (tPA), 100 mg infused over 2 hours, and an accelerated regimen (0.6 mg/kg over 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 50 mg) is recommended if there is impending (or actual) cardiovascular collapse (6).

Heparin is used in conjunction with thrombolytic therapy, and the infusion can be continued during the thrombolytic treatment period (although it is frequently stopped and restarted after the fibrinolytic agent is given). Heparin therapy is particularly advantageous after thrombolysis because clot dissolution releases thrombin, and this can promote thrombotic reocclusion of the involved vessel.

**SYSTEMIC VS. DIRECTED THROMBOLYSIS:** Traditional (systemic) thrombolytic therapy provides some hemodynamic benefit (e.g., a decrease in pulmonary artery pressures), but there is a 10– 12% incidence of major bleeding (including intracranial hemorrhage in 1–2% of cases) (38,39), and this erases the overall benefit of the treatment. Catheter-directed thrombolysis (through a catheter placed in the pulmonary artery) uses a lower thrombolytic dose, and causes fewer major bleeding episodes than systemic thrombolysis (40). (The effects on pulmonary artery pressures are similar to systemic thrombolytic therapy.) The major shortcoming of catheter-directed

thrombolysis is availability (an interventional radiologist is needed to place the catheter under fluoroscopic guidance), especially since the benefit of thrombolytic therapy is time-dependent; i.e., the greatest benefit occurs within 48 hours of symptom onset (6).

### *Mechanical Thrombectomy*

Clot removal from the pulmonary arteries is possible using specialized catheters that are inserted percutaneously into the femoral vein and advanced into the pulmonary arteries. The emboli are located by contrast injection, and are then removed by aspiration. The clot burden that can be removed with this procedure is shown in [Figure](#page-9-0) 22.2.

Mechanical thrombectomy can result in dramatic improvements in pulmonary artery pressures and RV function (much greater than seen with thrombolytic therapy), and these changes persist for at least three months after the procedure (41). Although it is currently recommended as a rescue procedure when thrombolytic therapy fails or is contraindicated (6), it could be used as a replacement for thrombolytic therapy, if available. In fact, a look at the amount of clot removed from the pulmonary arteries in [Figure](#page-9-0) 22.2 provides an explanation of why thrombolytic therapy has had such a limited impact in life-threatening pulmonary embolism.

# **Hemodynamic Management**

The management of cardiovascular compromise from an acute PE is challenging, because the primary problem is a physical obstruction in the pulmonary arteries. The following are some relevant points about management:

- 1. Aggressive volume infusion can be detrimental in acute PE because it can increase volume overload in the right ventricle, which will push the interventricular septum into the left ventricle and impede left ventricular filling (see Figure 18.2). Because of this risk, cardiac ultrasound should be used to guide fluid management in acute PE.
- 2. In the setting of right heart failure, a normal central venous pressure (4–6 mm Hg) can be used as evidence of hypovolemia (and the subsequent need for volume infusion). However, the volume infused should be limited to 500 mL (6), because of the previously mentioned risk. Once again, cardiac ultrasound should be used to guide volume infusion.

- 3. Current guidelines recommend dobutamine as a consideration when there is right heart strain and the blood pressure is normal (i.e., intermediate-risk PE) (6). Dobutamine is a vasodilator, and should not be used alone if acute PE results in hypotension. (See Table 16.3 for the dobutamine dosing regimen.)
- 4. Norepinephrine is recommended for hypotension in acute PE because it does not increase pulmonary vascular resistance (6).

## **Vena Cava Filters**

The aim of anticoagulation in acute PE is not to dissolve the existing embolus, but to prevent the next one. When anticoagulation is not possible, or is not effective, meshlike filters can be placed in the inferior vena cava (IVC) to prevent recurrent PEs from leg veins (42).

### *Filter Design*

Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters have progressed through several iterations. The earliest filters were shaped like an umbrella, and were problematic because as they filled with trapped blood clots, they would obstruct the IVC and create troublesome leg edema. The design that led to the popularity of IVC filters is shown in [Figure](#page-10-0) 22.3. The design benefit is an elongated, conical shape (like a badminton birdie), which allows the basket to fill to 75% of its capacity without compromising the cross-sectional area of the vena cava. This limits the risk of vena cava obstruction and leg edema.

IVC filters are inserted percutaneously into the internal jugular vein or femoral vein, and are placed below the renal veins, if possible. The early filters (like the one in [Figure](#page-10-0) 22.3) were permanent, but retrievable filters were introduced in 2003 (43), and the most recent iteration is a biodegradable filter with a basket that dissolves after 60 days (44).

and the struts have hooked ends to anchor the filter to the wall of the vena cava.

#### *Indications*

The consensus indications for placement of an IVC filter are as follows:

- 1. The presence of a DVT or acute PE and an absolute contraindication to anticoagulation (e.g., from active bleeding).
- 2. An acute PE that occurs while receiving therapeutic doses of an anticoagulant, and the likely source is DVT in the legs or pelvis (and not in an upper extremity).

IVC filters are also used as a preventive measure in conditions with a high risk of venous thromboembolism, such as multisystem trauma or bariatric surgery. Clinical studies have shown that the prophylactic use of IVC filters reduces the risk of acute PE by about 60%, but there is also a 70% increase in the incidence of DVT (45), so the overall benefit of the practice is questioned (6).

### *The Clinical Experience*

Although not devoid of risk, IVC filters are remarkably safe and effective. The incidence of symptomatic PE after filter placement is about 5% (46), and life-threatening complications (e.g., migration of the filter) are reported in less than 1% of cases (46). One of the intriguing features of IVC filters (and one that is rarely mentioned) is that they never seem to get infected, even when exposed to bacteremia.

# **A FINAL WORD**

# **An Exercise in Diagnostic Uncertainty**

The experience with venous thromboembolism, which is far from satisfying, can be summarized as follows:

- 1. When you think it's there, it usually isn't; i.e., when a pulmonary embolism is suspected, the diagnosis is confirmed in as few as 10% of cases.
- 2. When it is there, you usually don't know it; i.e., in most cases of pulmonary embolism, the source of the embolus is clinically silent.
- 3. The best thing to do, then, is to prevent it (as described in Chapter 5).
