# **Conventional Mechanical Ventilation**

*Medicine is a science which has been more laboured than advanced. For I find much iteration, but small addition.*

Sir Francis Bacon (*[a](#page-14-0)*)

The earliest ventilators (introduced in the late 1920s) were negative pressure chambers known as *iron lungs* that enclosed the patient from the neck to the ankles. These behemoths (early models weighed about a ton) were the sole means of ventilatory support until the polio epidemic in the 1950's, when the demand for assisted ventilation exceeded the supply of iron lungs. In Copenhagen, Denmark, tracheostomies were introduced, and medical students worked in 8 hour shifts as human ventilators, manually inflating the lungs of afflicted patients [\(1](#page-14-1)). In Boston, the local Emerson Company had a prototype device for positive pressure lung inflations, which was put to use at the Massachusetts General Hospital, and became an instant success.

Fast forward about 70 years, and there are estimated 174 different modes of ventilation ([2\)](#page-14-2). However, only one has shown evidence of improved clinical outcomes [\(3](#page-14-3)[,4](#page-14-4)), and only because it limits the lung damage produced by positive pressure ventilation (see Chapter 24). What this means is that mechanical ventilation is much more complicated than it needs to be, and that "less is better" with this form of support.

This chapter describes the basic methods of positive pressure ventilation. Although far fewer than the bloated number of available methods, they will provide effective ventilatory support for most (if not all) of your patients.

## **THE VENTILATOR BREATH**

There are two basic methods of positive-pressure lung inflation. These are summarized below, and are illustrated in [Figure](#page-1-0) 27.1.

- 1. *Volume-control ventilation*, where the desired inflation volume (tidal volume) is preselected. The gas is delivered at a constant flow rate, and there is a steady rise in volume and airway pressure until the target volume is reached. Exhalation is then passive.
- 2. *Pressure-control ventilation*, where the desired inflation pressure is preselected. In this case,

the inspiratory flow rate has a decelerating pattern, with the peak flow rate in the initial phase of inspiration, and the flow rate then decreasing to zero by the end of inspiration. Because of this flow profile, the increments in lung volume and airway pressure are greater in the early phase of inspiration. The desired (peak) pressure is reached early, and a preselected inspiratory time then determines the end of inspiration. Exhalation occurs passively.

**FIGURE 27.1** Changes in lung volume, airway pressure, and flow rate during a single ventilator breath using volume control and pressure control methods of lung inflation. I = inspiration, E = expiration. See text for further explanation.

All variables (i.e., volume, pressure, and flow) are recorded and displayed by the ventilator, but the measurements are made at the level of the endotracheal tube, and may not reflect conditions in the distal airspaces (the alveoli). In addition, the airway pressures are measured as *transthoracic* pressures (i.e., airway pressure relative to atmospheric pressure), and are influenced by both the lungs and the chest wall. The measurement of *transpulmonary* pressure (i.e., airway pressure relative to pleural pressure) eliminates the influence of the chest wall, but requires an esophageal balloon to measure the intrapleural pressure.

### **Volume Control**

Volume-control ventilation (VCV) delivers a preselected tidal volume at a constant flow rate, and the peak airway pressure (Ppeak), is determined by the mechanical properties (resistance and elastance) of the lungs and chest wall. This can be expressed as follows:

$$Ppeak = Pres + Pel$$
 (27.1)

where Pres is the pressure attributed to airflow resistance in the airways, and Pel is the pressure attributed to the elastic recoil force of the lungs and chest wall (elastance). (*Note:* Elastance is the resistance of an object to being deformed.)

#### *The Plateau Pressure*

The relative contributions of resistance and elastance to the peak airway pressure can be identified by briefly occluding the ventilator circuit at the end of lung inflation [\(5](#page-14-5)). This "inflation-hold" maneuver is illustrated in [Figure](#page-2-0) 27.2. The peak pressure decreases initially during the inflation hold, and then reaches a constant *plateau pressure* until the occlusion is released and exhalation proceeds. Since there is no airflow during the inflation hold maneuver, the plateau pressure is equivalent to the pressure in the alveoli (Palv), and this is the pressure generated by the elastic recoil force of the lungs and chest wall (Pel): i.e.,

$$Pplateau = Palv = Pel (27.2)$$

(*Note:* Positive end-expiratory pressure or PEEP is used commonly during mechanical ventilation, as described later, and this must be subtracted from the plateau pressure to obtain the actual alveolar pressure.) The difference between the peak and plateau pressures is then the pressure needed to overcome the resistance to airflow (Pres): i.e.,

$$(Ppeak - Pplateau) = Pres$$
 (27.3)

<span id="page-2-0"></span>![](_page_2_Figure_7.jpeg)

**FIGURE 27.2** Airway pressure profile for a volume-controlled lung inflation with a brief endinspiratory occlusion (inflation-hold). Ppeak is the peak airway pressure, Pplateau is the endinspiratory occlusion pressure, Palv is the alveolar pressure, Pres is the pressure attributed to airway resistance, and Pel is the pressure attributed to the elastic recoil force of the lungs and chest wall. See text for explanation.

**RISK OF ALVEOLAR INJURY:** The peak airway pressure is higher with VCV than with pressure control ventilation (see [Figure](#page-1-0) 27.1), and there is a misconception that this increases the risk of alveolar rupture. However, this risk is a function of the alveolar pressure; i.e., the plateau pressure. Clinical studies indicate that *the risk of alveolar rupture is negligible if the alveolar pressure (plateau pressure) is ≤30 cm H2O* [\(2](#page-14-2)[,4](#page-14-4)), and this is one of the major goals of *lung protective ventilation* [\(2](#page-14-2)), which is described later (see [Table](#page-12-0) 27.1).

#### *Advantages*

The major advantage of VCV is the ability to maintain a constant tidal volume despite changes in the mechanical properties of the lungs. This is especially important for limiting the tidal volumes used during mechanical ventilation, which is the basis of lung protective ventilation.

## *Disadvantages*

The constant inspiratory flow rate during VCV creates two potential disadvantages. First, the duration of inspiration is relatively short, and this can lead to uneven alveolar filling. Second, the maximum inspiratory flow is limited when flow is constant; as a result the inspiratory flow rate can be inadequate for patients with high ventilatory demands. A decelerating flow pattern is available for VCV, and has been shown to improve patient comfort ([6\)](#page-14-6).

## **Pressure Control**

With pressure control ventilation (PCV), the desired inflation pressure is preselected, and a decelerating inspiratory flow rate provides high flows at the onset of the lung inflation, to attain the desired inflation pressure quickly. The inspiratory time is adjusted to allow enough time for the inspiratory flow rate to fall to zero at the end of inspiration. *Since there is no airflow at the end of the inspiration, the end-inspiratory airway pressure is equivalent to the alveolar pressure*.

#### *Advantages*

The major advantage of PCV is the increased patient acceptance and reduced risk of ventilatory asynchrony when compared to VCV [\(7](#page-14-7)). This advantage is attributed to the high initial flow rates and the longer duration of inspiration with PCV.

### *Disadvantages*

The major disadvantage with PCV is the change in tidal volume that occurs with changes in airway resistance or lung elastance, since this can increase the risk of alveolar overdistension and ventilator-induced lung injury (see Chapter 24). However, this disadvantage is corrected with the adaptive mode of ventilation described next.

### *Pressure-Regulated, Volume Control*

Pressure-regulated, volume control ventilation (PRVC) is an adaptive mode of ventilation that provides a constant tidal volume (like volume control) but limits the end-inspiratory airway pressures (like pressure control). PRVC operates like an intelligent form of volume control; i.e., the ventilator monitors lung compliance, and uses these measurements to select the lowest airway pressure needed to deliver the desired tidal volume (8). This has become a popular mode of mechanical ventilation, but patients with a high ventilatory drive may not receive the needed

inspiratory flow rate, leading to ventilator asynchrony (9).

## **End-Expiratory Pressure**

The end-expiratory pressure is the minimum pressure in the alveoli during a ventilatory cycle. The different forms of end-expiratory pressure are illustrated in [Figure](#page-4-0) 27.3.

#### *ZEEP*

During appropriate ventilation in the normal lung, there is no airflow at the end of expiration, and the pressure in the alveoli is equivalent to atmospheric pressure. Since atmospheric pressure is a zero reference point for breathing, this condition is called *zero end-expiratory pressure*, or ZEEP.

#### *Applied PEEP*

Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) can be added through the ventilatory circuit (via a pressure-sensitive valve in the expiratory limb of the circuit) so that exhalation will cease when the airway pressure falls to the preselected PEEP level. Applied PEEP is used routinely during mechanical ventilation to prevent the collapse of small airways at the end of expiration, and to open collapsed alveoli (recruitment). The uses, advantages, and disadvantages of applied PEEP are described later in the chapter.

#### *Occult PEEP*

When there is continued airflow at the end of expiration, the lungs do not completely empty, and the alveolar pressure remains positive even though the proximal airway pressure falls to atmospheric (zero) pressure. This pressure is sometimes called intrinsic PEEP or auto-PEEP, but *occult PEEP* is also used because the PEEP *is not apparent in proximal airway pressure recordings* (10). Occult PEEP can be the result of dynamic hyperinflation in patients with asthma and COPD, as described in Chapter 23, or it can be the result of ventilator settings that predispose to end-expiratory airflow (e.g., high tidal volumes, decreased time for exhalation).

<span id="page-4-0"></span>![](_page_4_Figure_9.jpeg)

**FIGURE 27.3** Different types of end-expiratory pressure. See text for explanation.

Occult PEEP can be detected on the flow tracing by noting the presence of airflow at the end of expiration, as illustrated in Figure 23.5. If occult PEEP is present, it can be quantified by occluding the expiratory circuit at the end of expiration. During an end-expiratory occlusion, alveolar pressure will equilibrate with proximal airway pressure, and the occult PEEP becomes apparent as a abrupt increase in airway pressure, as shown in [Figure](#page-4-0) 27.3. This maneuver is successful *only in patients who have no respiratory efforts*. Occult PEEP is described in more detail in Chapter 28.

#### **Mean Airway Pressure**

The mean airway pressure is the average pressure in the airway during the ventilatory cycle, and is influenced by several variables, including the peak airway pressure, the contour of the pressure waveform, the PEEP level, the respiratory rate, and the inflation time relative to the total time of the ventilatory cycle (T<sup>I</sup> /Ttot). The mean airway pressure that is displayed by ventilators is obtained by integrating the area under the airway pressure waveform.

The mean airway pressure is linked to the hemodynamic effects of positive pressure ventilation. (The intrapleural pressure is the important influence on cardiac function, but this pressure requires measurement with an intraesophageal balloon, and is not monitored routinely.) Typical values for mean airway pressure during positive pressure ventilation are 5–10 cm H2O for normal lungs, 10–20 cm H2O for airflow obstruction, and 20–30 cm H2O for noncompliant (stiff) lungs (11).

## **Thoracic Compliance**

Compliance (∆volume/∆pressure) is the reciprocal of elastance, and is the traditional term used to express the elastic properties of structures with chambers (like the heart and lungs). Compliance expresses *distensibility*, or the tendency of a chamber to increase in volume when exposed to a given distending pressure. The compliance that is measured during mechanical ventilation is a *thoracic compliance*, and includes both the lungs and the chest wall.

#### *Volume-Control Ventilation*

During VCV, the static compliance of the thorax (Cstat) is expressed as the preselected tidal volume (VT) divided by the difference between the plateau pressure and the total PEEP level (applied plus occult PEEP):

$$Cstat = V_T/[Pplateau - PEEP(tot)]$$
 (27.4)

This is a "static" compliance because the pressures involved are measured in the absence of airflow. In patients with normal lungs, Cstat is 50–80 mL/cm H2O (12), and in patients with infiltrative lung diseases (e.g., pulmonary edema or acute respiratory distress syndrome), Cstat is typically <25 mL/cm H2O (13).

#### *Pressure-Control Ventilation*

During PCV, Cstat is the exhaled tidal volume (exhaled VT) divided by the difference between the end-inspiratory airway pressure (Paw) and the total PEEP level:

#### *Sources of Error*

- 1. During passive ventilation, the chest wall can account for 35% of the total thoracic compliance (14,15), and this contribution increases when the chest wall muscles contract. Therefore, to avoid errors in interpreting changes in thoracic compliance, the *compliance measurements should be performed in patients with minimal or no breathing efforts*.
- 2. Thoracic compliance is volume-dependent; i.e., it decreases as lung volume increases. Absolute lung volumes cannot be measured during mechanical ventilation, so *compliance measurements should be performed at the same tidal volume*.
- 3. The tidal volume used for the compliance measurement should be adjusted for the compliance of the ventilator tubing, which is typically 3 mL/cm H2O (13). For example, if the preselected tidal volume during VCV is 500 mL and the peak airway pressure is 40 cm H2O, then 3 × 40 = 120 mL of the delivered volume will be lost to expansion of the ventilator tubing, and the actual tidal volume reaching the patient will be 500 – 120 = 380 mL. When using exhaled tidal volumes during PCV, the airway pressure at end-inspiration should be used for the volume adjustments.

## **ASSIST-CONTROL VENTILATION**

Assist-control ventilation (ACV) allows the patient to initiate the ventilator breath, but if this is not possible, ventilator breaths are delivered at a preselected rate (controlled or time-triggered ventilation). The ventilator breaths during ACV can be volume-cycled or pressure-cycled.

<span id="page-7-0"></span>![](_page_7_Figure_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 27.4** Airway pressure patterns in assist-control ventilation (ACV) and synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV). See text for further explanation.

## **Triggers**

The ventilator breaths in ACV can be initiated (triggered) in two ways, as shown in the upper panel of [Figure](#page-7-0) 27.4. The pressure waveform on the left is preceded by a negative pressure deflection, which represents a spontaneous inspiratory effort by the patient. This is a *patienttriggered* ventilator breath. The pressure waveform on the right is not preceded by a negative pressure deflection, indicating the absence of a spontaneous inspiratory effort. In this case, there is no interaction between the patient and the ventilator, and the ventilator breaths are delivered at a preselected rate. This is a *time-triggered* ventilator breath.

### *Patient-Related Triggers*

There are two types of signals that allow patients to trigger a ventilator breath: negative pressure and inspiratory flow rate.

**NEGATIVE PRESSURE:** Patients can trigger a ventilator breath by generating a negative airway pressure of 2 to 3 cm H2O, which opens a pressure-sensitive valve in the ventilator. Despite this low pressure requirement, about one-third of inspiratory efforts fail to trigger a ventilator breath when negative pressure is the trigger signal (16).

**FLOW RATE:** Flow triggering involves little or no change in pressures and volumes, and thus

involves less mechanical work than pressure triggering. For this reason, flow has replaced pressure as the standard trigger mechanism. The flow rate that is required to trigger a ventilator breath differs for each brand of ventilator, but rates of 1–10 L/min are usually required. Autotriggering from system leaks (which create flow changes) is the major problem associated with flow triggering (17).

## **The Respiratory Cycle**

A general rule of thumb during mechanical ventilation is to allow at least twice the amount of time for expiration as allowed for inspiration. This is equivalent to an inspiration:expiration time ratio (I:E ratio) of at least 1:2. The goal is to allow enough time for complete exhalation to prevent dynamic hyperinflation and intrinsic or occult PEEP (see Figure 23.5) If the duration of exhalation is too short, the I:E ratio can be increased by: (a) increasing the inspiratory flow rate, (b) reducing the tidal volume, or (c) decreasing the inspiratory time (for pressure control).

#### *Rapid Breathing*

When each breath is a patient-triggered ventilator breath, rapid breathing like that shown in [Figure](#page-7-0) 27.4 can severely curtail the time for exhalation and increase the risk of dynamic hyperinflation and occult PEEP. When rapid breathing is the result of a condition other than discomfort or anxiety, attempts to reduce the respiratory rate with sedation or inspiratory flow adjustments are often unsuccessful. In this situation, the ventilator mode described next may be the answer.

## **INTERMITTENT MANDATORY VENTILATION**

Difficulties with rapid breathing during ACV in neonates with respiratory distress syndrome, who typically have respiratory rates above 40 breaths/minute, led to the introduction of *intermittent mandatory ventilation* (IMV).

## **The Method**

IMV is designed to allow spontaneous breathing between ventilator breaths. This is accomplished by placing a spontaneous breathing circuit in parallel with the ventilator circuit, with a unidirectional valve that opens the spontaneous breathing circuit when a ventilator breath is not being delivered. The ventilatory pattern in IMV is illustrated in the lower panel of Figure 27.4. Note that the ventilator breath is delivered in synchrony with the [spontaneous](#page-7-0) breath, which is called *synchronized IMV* (SIMV).

The ventilator breaths during SIMV can be volume-cycled or pressure-cycled. The rate of ventilator breaths can be started at 10 breaths/min, and then adjusted as needed to achieve the desired minute ventilation (spontaneous plus assisted breaths).

## **Adverse Effects**

The principal adverse effects of IMV are: (a) an increased work of breathing, and (b) a decrease in cardiac output, primarily in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Both effects are the result of the spontaneous breathing period.

#### *Work of Breathing*

The heightened work of breathing during the spontaneous breathing period in IMV is attributed to resistance in the ventilator circuit. Spontaneous breathing with pressure support, which is described in Chapter 26 (see Figure 26.2), overcomes the added resistance of the ventilator circuit and reduces the work of breathing (18). As a result, pressure-support ventilation (at 10 cm H2O) is now used routinely during the spontaneous breathing periods in IMV.

#### *Cardiac Output*

As described in Chapter 26, positive pressure ventilation reduces left ventricular afterload and can increase cardiac output (see Figure 26.6) (19). IMV has the opposite effect and increases left ventricular afterload (during the spontaneous breathing periods), which results in a decrease in cardiac output in patients with left ventricular dysfunction (20).

## **Summary**

The major indication for IMV is rapid breathing with incomplete exhalation during assist-control ventilation. The spontaneous breathing periods during IMV promote alveolar emptying and reduce the risk of air trapping and intrinsic PEEP. IMV can increase the work of breathing and impair cardiac output in patients with left ventricular dysfunction; as a result, *IMV is not advised for patients with respiratory muscle weakness or left heart failure*.

## **POSITIVE END-EXPIRATORY PRESSURE**

Ventilator-dependent patients usually have an increase in airway resistance (e.g., from COPD) or a decrease in lung compliance (e.g., from lung consolidation), and both of these conditions promote the collapse of small airways and alveoli at the end of expiration. This impairs gas exchange in the lungs and promotes hypoxemia. In addition, collapsed airspaces can reopen in the ensuing lung inflation, and the repetitive opening and closing of small airways can damage the airway epithelium by generating excessive shear forces (21). This type of injury is called *atelectrauma* (22), and it is one of the mechanisms for *ventilator-induced lung injury* (which is described in detail in Chapter 24).

To combat this tendency for alveolar collapse, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is used routinely during mechanical ventilation. The standard practice is to begin with a pressure of 5–8 cm H2O, but the optimal level of PEEP may differ for each patient, as described next.

### **Best PEEP**

Relatively small levels of PEEP (5–10 cm H2O) can prevent the collapse of distal airspaces, while higher PEEP levels (10–20 cm H2O) can open airspaces that are collapsed. This latter effect is known as *alveolar recruitment*, and it increases the available surface area in the lungs for gas exchange (23). However, higher levels of PEEP can also overdistend and rupture alveoli in normal lung regions. This is known as *volutrauma*, and is the principal form of ventilatorinduced lung injury (23). The following are some ways to determine whether PEEP is promoting alveolar recruitment (favorable response) or promoting alveolar overdistension (unfavorable response).

#### *Lung Compliance*

When PEEP is promoting alveolar recruitment, the compliance (distensibility) of the lungs will increase, but when PEEP is overdistending alveoli, lung compliance will decrease. Therefore, monitoring the changes in thoracic compliance (as in Equations 27.4 and 27.5) in response to incremental levels of PEEP can identify whether PEEP is beneficial or harmful. This is demonstrated in [Figure](#page-10-0) 27.5 (24). The upper curve in this figure shows that compliance initially increases in response to PEEP, but eventually begins to decrease. The transition point then identifies the "best PEEP" level.

#### *Driving Pressure*

At any given tidal volume, lung compliance is a function of the difference between the peak alveolar pressure and the PEEP level (as shown in Equations 27.4 and 27.5). This pressure difference is the "driving pressure" for alveolar distension, and the changes in this pressure can identify if PEEP is promoting alveolar recruitment or overdistension. This is demonstrated in the lower curve in [Figure](#page-10-0) 27.5 (24). The driving pressure decreases with lower levels of PEEP (indicating that alveolar recruitment is the predominant response), but begins to increase at higher levels of PEEP (indicating that alveolar overdistension is a risk), and the transition point is then the "best PEEP" level.

<span id="page-10-0"></span>![](_page_10_Figure_4.jpeg)

**FIGURE 27.5** The effects of incremental levels of PEEP on thoracic compliance and driving pressure, which were measured at a constant tidal volume (V<sup>T</sup> ) of 4 mL/kg predicted body weight (PBW). The point of transition in each curve identifies the "best PEEP". Data from Reference 24. See text for further explanation.

### *PaO<sup>2</sup> /FIO<sup>2</sup> Ratio*

The relationship between the arterial PO<sup>2</sup> and the fractional concentration of inspired oxygen, as expressed by the PaO<sup>2</sup> /FIO<sup>2</sup> ratio, is a measure of the efficiency of gas exchange in the lungs.

When PEEP promotes alveolar recruitment, the  $PaO_2/FiO_2$  ratio will increase, and when PEEP does not promote alveolar recruitment, the  $PaO_2/FiO_2$  ratio will remain unchanged or will decrease. An example of a beneficial response in the  $PaO_2/FiO_2$  ratio (indicating alveolar recruitment) is shown in Figure 27.6. However, an increase in the  $PaO_2/FiO_2$  ratio is not synonymous with an increases in  $O_2$  delivery to tissues, as explained next.

**OXYGEN DELIVERY**: The beneficial effects of PEEP on arterial oxygenation may not be accompanied by a similar benefit in oxygen delivery to tissues, because the rate of  $O_2$  delivery in arterial blood ( $DO_2$ ) is dependent on the cardiac output (CO) as well as the arterial  $O_2$  content ( $CaO_2$ ): i.e.,

$$DO_2 = CO \times CaO_2 \tag{27.6}$$

The effects of positive pressure ventilation that impair cardiac filling are described in Chapter 26 (see Figure 26.7), and PEEP magnifies these effects (25). This means that PEEP can decrease the cardiac output and negate the beneficial effects on arterial oxygenation. This is shown in Figure 27.6, where the progressive increase in  $PaO_2/FiO_2$  ratio in response to incremental PEEP is accompanied by a progressive decrease in cardiac output (26). Thus, PEEP can promote alveolar recruitment and increase arterial oxygenation, but systemic  $O_2$  delivery may not improve if PEEP also decreases the cardiac output.

<span id="page-11-0"></span>![](_page_11_Figure_4.jpeg)

**FIGURE 27.6** The opposing effects of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) on oxygenation (PaO<sub>2</sub> /FIO<sub>2</sub>) and cardiac index in patients with ARDS. Data from Reference 26.

The opposing effects of PEEP on arterial oxygenation and cardiac output emphasize the need to include a measure of systemic O<sup>2</sup> delivery in the determination of "best PEEP". Since cardiac output is not frequently monitored during mechanical ventilation, the central venous O<sup>2</sup> saturation can be used as a surrogate measure of changes in cardiac output and O<sup>2</sup> delivery, as explained in Chapter 9.

## **VENTILATOR SETTINGS**

When mechanical ventilation is initiated, the respiratory therapist will ask you for the following parameters: (a) mode of ventilation, (b) tidal volume, (c) respiratory rate, (d) PEEP level, and (e) inspired O<sup>2</sup> concentration. The following is a list of suggestions for setting up mechanical ventilation.

## **Assist-Control Ventilation**

- 1. Select assist-control as the initial mode of ventilation.
- 2. It may be necessary to switch to synchronized IMV in patients who are breathing too rapidly in the assist-control mode (see later).

## **Volume vs. Pressure Control**

- 1. Use volume control of some form (either standard volume control or pressure-regulated volume control) in order to use *lung protective ventilation*, where control of the tidal volume is a necessity.
- 2. If lung protective ventilation is not improving gas exchange in patients with ARDS, consider switching to "airway pressure release ventilation" (see Figure 24.7).

### **Tidal Volume**

The following recommendations are from the protocol for lung protective ventilation, which is summarized in [Table](#page-12-0) 27.1.

- 1. Select an initial tidal volume of 8 mL/kg using *predicted body weight*. (The formulas for predicted body weight are in [Table](#page-12-0) 27.1.)
- 2. Reduce the tidal volume to 6 mL/kg over the next 2 hours, if possible.
- 3. Monitor the end-inspiratory alveolar pressure (i.e., the plateau pressure) and keep it ≤30 cm H2O (to limit the risk of volutrauma).

#### **Inspiratory Flow Rate**

- . Select an inspiratory flow rate of 60 L/min if the patient is breathing quietly or has no spontaneous respirations.
- . Use higher inspiratory flow rates (e.g., ≥80 L/min) for patients with respiratory distress or a high minute ventilation (≥10 L/min).

#### I:E Ratio

- . The I:E ratio should be  $\geq$ 1:2.
- . If the I:E ratio is <1:2, the options for increasing the I:E ratio include: (a) increasing the inspiratory flow rate, (b) decreasing the tidal volume, or (c) decreasing the respiratory rate, if possible.

## **Respiratory Rate**

- . If the patient has no spontaneous respirations, set the respiratory rate to achieve your estimate of the patient's minute ventilation just prior to intubation, but do not exceed 35 breaths/minute.
- . If the patient is triggering each ventilator breath, set the machine rate just below the patient's spontaneous respiratory rate.
- . After 30 minutes, check the arterial  $PCO_2$ , and adjust the respiratory rate, if necessary, to achieve the desired  $PCO_2$ .
- . For patients who are breathing rapidly and have an acute respiratory alkalosis or evidence of occult PEEP, consider switching to synchronized IMV (SIMV) as the mode of ventilation.

#### **PEEP**

- 1. Set the initial PEEP to 5–8 cm H2O.
- 2. Further increases in PEEP may be necessary for the following reasons:
  - a. To increase the PaO<sup>2</sup> /FIO<sup>2</sup> ratio in cases where a toxic level of inhaled oxygen (>60%) is required to maintain adequate oxygenation (SaO<sup>2</sup> ≥90%).
  - b. To determine the "best PEEP" for that patient.

## **Occult PEEP**

- 1. Check the flow rate at the end of expiration: if the expiratory flow rate has not returned to zero at end-expiration, this is evidence of dynamic hyperinflation and occult PEEP (see Figure 23.5).
- 2. If there is evidence of occult PEEP, attempt to prolong the time for expiration by increasing the I:E ratio using the maneuvers described previously.
- 3. If increasing the I:E ratio is not possible or is not successful, then measure the level of occult PEEP with the end-inspiratory occlusion method, and add extrinsic PEEP at a level that is just below the occult PEEP. (The rationale for this maneuver is explained in Chapter 28.)

## **A FINAL WORD**

## **A Loss of Focus**

Since the advent of mechanical ventilation, an enormous amount of time and energy has been devoted to the development of newer methods of ventilation (174 of them at last count), with only one of these showing evidence of improved outcomes (and only because it involves a decrease in ventilatory support) ([3\)](#page-14-3). What has been lost in these endeavors is the simple fact that mechanical ventilation is a temporary support measure for acute respiratory failure, and is not a treatment modality for lung disease. Therefore, if we want to improve outcomes in ventilatordependent patients, less attention should be given to the knobs on ventilators, and more attention should be directed at the diseases that create ventilator dependency.
