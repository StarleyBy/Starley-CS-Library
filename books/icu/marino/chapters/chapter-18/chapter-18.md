# **Acute Heart Failure(s)**

*Movement is the cause of all life.*

Leonardo da Vinci

Despite the emphasis on a "heart healthy" lifestyle in modern times, heart failure has grown in prevalence and associated mortality in recent years; i.e., the number of adults in the United States with heart failure increased from 6 million in 2018 to 6.7 million in 2020, and deaths attributed to heart failure were 50% higher in 2020 than in 2010 ([1\)](#page-14-0). Current surveys show that one of every 8 deaths in the United States is related to heart failure [\(1](#page-14-0)), indicating that heart failure is a leading health problem in this country.

Heart failure is not a single entity (as the title suggests), and is classified according to the portion of the cardiac cycle that is affected (systole or diastole) and the side of the heart that is involved. This chapter describes each type of heart failure, and focuses on the acute, decompensated stage of heart failure that requires management in the hospital. (*Note:* This chapter does not include cardiogenic shock, which is described in Chapter 16.) Many of the recommendations in this chapter are borrowed from the clinical practice guidelines listed at the end of the chapter [\(2](#page-14-1)[–5](#page-14-2)).

## **TYPES OF HEART FAILURE**

Heart failure can be the result of impaired cardiac filling (diastolic dysfunction) or a decrease in contractile strength (systolic dysfunction), and these abnormalities can predominate in the left or right side of the heart.

## **Systolic vs. Diastolic Dysfunction**

The influence of systolic and diastolic dysfunction on measures of cardiac performance are shown in [Figure](#page-1-0) 18.1. The upper graph shows the relationship between ventricular end-diastolic pressure (EDP) and stroke volume (which are known as "ventricular function curves"). The curve representing heart failure has a decreased slope, and the point on the curve indicates that heart failure is associated with an increase in EDP and a decrease in stroke volume. The lower graph shows the relationship between ventricular end-diastolic pressure and end-diastolic volume

(EDV). The curve representing diastolic dysfunction has a decreased slope, which reflects a decrease in ventricular compliance (distensibility) according to the following relationship:

Compliance = 
$$\Delta EDV/\Delta EDP$$
 (18.1)

The points on the ventricular compliance curves indicate that the increase in EDP in heart failure is associated with an increase in EDV if the problem is systolic dysfunction, and a decrease in EDV if the problem is diastolic dysfunction. Therefore, *the end-diastolic volume (not the enddiastolic pressure) can distinguish between systolic and diastolic dysfunction in patients with heart failure*. An end-diastolic volume of 97 mL/m2 (measured relative to body surface area in m2) is used to distinguish between systolic and diastolic dysfunction i.e., an EDV >97 mL/m2 indicates systolic dysfunction, and an EDV ≤97 mL/m2 indicates diastolic dysfunction [\(6](#page-14-3)). Because EDV is not easily measured at the bedside, the "ejection fraction" is used to distinguish between systolic and diastolic dysfunction (see next).

#### *Ejection Fraction*

The fraction of the ventricular volume that is ejected during systole is called the *ejection fraction* (EF), and is the ratio of stroke volume (SV) to end-diastolic volume (EDV):

$$EF = (SV/EDV) \times 100 \tag{18.2}$$

(The ratio is multiplied by 100 to express it as a percentage.) The EF is directly related to the strength of ventricular contraction, and is used a measure of systolic function. The normal EF of the left ventricle is ≥55%, but a lower value of ≥50% is used as normal in patients with heart failure because increases in afterload can reduce the EF by 5–10% [\(2](#page-14-1)).

The classification of left heart failure based on the left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is shown in [Table](#page-2-0) 18.1 ([2\)](#page-14-1).

- 1. Heart failure caused by diastolic dysfunction has a normal LVEF (≥50%), and is called *heart failure with preserved ejection fraction* (HFpEF).
- 2. Heart failure caused by systolic dysfunction has a reduced LVEF (<50%), and is subdivided into *heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction* (HFmrEF) if the LVEF is 41–49%, and *heart failure with reduced ejection fraction* (HFrEF) if the LVEF is ≤40%.

## *Diastolic Dysfunction*

Early descriptions of heart failure attributed most cases to systolic dysfunction, but diastolic dysfunction is now recognized as a cause of at least 50% of cases of left heart failure [\(2](#page-14-1)). The functional problem with diastolic dysfunction is a decrease in ventricular distensibility that impairs ventricular filling during diastole. The result is a decrease in end-diastolic volume (EDV), and although the EF is preserved, the stroke volume is reduced because the EF is a fraction of a lower EDV.

Common causes of heart failure with preserved EF (HFpEF) include ventricular hypertrophy, myocardial ischemia (stunned myocardium), restrictive (fibrotic) cardiomyopathy, and pericardial tamponade. High intrathoracic pressures during mechanical ventilation can also impair ventricular filling and aggravate HFpEF.

## **Right Heart Failure**

Right-sided heart failure is usually a consequence of pulmonary hypertension (e.g., from pulmonary emboli or chronic lung disease) or inferior wall myocardial infarction. The principal

mechanism is systolic dysfunction, and the result is an increase in right-ventricular end-diastolic volume (RVEDV). This can be difficult to detect clinically because the central venous pressure (CVP) does not rise (and jugular venous distension does not occur) until the increase in RVEDV is restricted by the pericardium (*pericardial constraint*) ([7\)](#page-14-4).

#### *Echocardiography*

Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the standard method for detecting right heart failure at the bedside. An example of a 2D ultrasound image showing right heart failure is shown in Figure 18.2 ([7\)](#page-14-4). This is a parasternal short-axis view showing right ventricular [enlargement.](#page-3-0) The right ventricular (RV) cavity is normally about two-thirds the size of the left ventricular (LV) cavity ([8\)](#page-14-5), and the image in [Figure](#page-3-0) 18.2 shows that the RV cavity is larger than the LV cavity. Note also that the interventricular septum flattens during diastole, which is a sign of volume overload in the right ventricle. Further distension of the right ventricle will push the interventricular septum towards the left ventricle and reduce the size of the left ventricular chamber. This septal displacement impairs left ventricular filling and increases the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. In this way, *right-sided heart failure can produce diastolic dysfunction in the left ventricle* by the process known as *interventricular interdependence*.

<span id="page-3-0"></span>![](_page_3_Figure_3.jpeg)

**FIGURE 18.2** Transthoracic ultrasound image in the parasternal short-axis view showing right ventricular (RV) enlargement, where the RV cavity is larger than the left ventricular (LV) cavity. Note also that the interventricular septum is flattened during diastole (indicated by the arrows), which is a sign of RV volume overload. Image retouched from Reference 9.

Quantitative measurements of RV chamber size and fractional shortening are also available for the diagnosis of RV failure [\(9](#page-14-6)), but measurements obtained with 2D echocardiography are prone to errors because of alterations in the normal RV geometry, and interobserver differences in probe positioning. 3D echocardiography overcomes the problem with altered RV geometry, and provides measures of RVEDV and RVEF (normal RVEF >45%) (10). However, the most accurate measures of RV size and systolic function are provided by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (not covered here).

#### *Cardiac Filling Pressures*

When a pulmonary artery catheter is in place, right heart failure is a consideration if the CVP is equal to, or greater than, the pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) (11). However, equalization of the CVP and PAWP also occurs with pericardial tamponade, so echocardiography is needed to identify which condition is present.

## **CARDIOVASCULAR CONSEQUENCES**

The physiological and clinical consequences of heart failure are the result of venous congestion and a reduction in forward flow. The extent to which these derangements occur depends on the stage of heart failure, as described next.

### **Progressive Stages of Heart Failure**

The changes in cardiac performance that occur in progressive stages of left heart failure are shown in [Figure](#page-5-0) 18.3. Three distinct stages are identified, and each is summarized below (using the corresponding numbers in [Figure](#page-5-0) 18.3).

- 1. The earliest sign of ventricular dysfunction is an increase in end-diastolic filling pressure (i.e., the pulmonary artery wedge pressure). The stroke volume is maintained, but at the expense of the elevated filling pressure, which produces venous congestion in the lungs and the resulting sensation of dyspnea.
- 2. The next stage is marked by a decrease in stroke volume and an increase in heart rate. The tachycardia offsets the reduction in stroke volume, so the cardiac output is preserved.
- 3. The final stage is characterized by a decrease in cardiac output and a further increase in the ventricular filling pressure. The point at which the cardiac output begins to fall marks the transition from compensated to decompensated heart failure.

### **Neurohumoral Responses**

Heart failure triggers a multitude of endogenous responses, some beneficial and some counterproductive. The following responses have the most clinical relevance (12).

#### *Natriuretic Peptides*

Increases in atrial and ventricular wall tension are accompanied by the release of four structurally similar *natriuretic peptides* from cardiac myocytes. These peptides "unload" the ventricles by promoting sodium excretion in the urine (which reduces ventricular preload) and dilating systemic blood vessels (which reduces ventricular preload and afterload). Natriuretic peptides are also used as diagnostic markers for heart failure, as described later.

#### *Sympathetic Nervous System*

Decreases in stroke volume are sensed by baroreceptors in the carotid and pulmonary arteries, and activation of these receptors results in brainstem activation of the sympathetic nervous system. This occurs in the early stages of heart failure, and the principal results are positive inotropic and chronotropic effects in the heart, peripheral vasoconstriction, and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

<span id="page-5-0"></span>![](_page_5_Figure_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 18.3** Changes in cardiac performance during progressive stages of left-sided heart failure in a postoperative patient. Data from personal observations. See text for further explanation.

### *Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System*

Specialized cells in the renal arterioles release renin in response to renal hypoperfusion and adrenergic β-receptor stimulation. Renin release has three consequences: the formation of angiotensin II, the production of aldosterone in the adrenal cortex, and the (angiotensintriggered) release of arginine vasopressin from the posterior pituitary. Angiotensin produces systemic vasoconstriction, while aldosterone promotes renal sodium and water retention, and vasopressin promotes both vasoconstriction and renal water retention. Angiotensin also helps to preserve the glomerular filtration in the kidneys by vasoconstricting the arterioles on the efferent side of the glomerulus, which increases the filtration pressure across the glomerulus.

Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system can be counterproductive in the advanced stages of heart failure, when the vasoconstriction can impede systemic blood flow, and the renal retention of sodium and water can promote unwanted (especially pulmonary) edema.

## **Venous Congestion**

Although decompensated heart failure is associated with a decrease in cardiac output, peripheral vasoconstriction is usually sufficient to maintain blood pressure and tissue perfusion. As a result,

the principal manifestations of acute, decompensated heart failure are related to venous congestion (13). The following are two of the more serious consequences of venous congestion.

#### *Pulmonary Edema*

The clinical presentation of acute heart failure is dominated by complaints of dyspnea and evidence of pulmonary congestion (i.e., basilar crackles on lung auscultation, chest x-ray changes, and hypoxemia). The chest x-ray may show minimal changes, or it may show evidence of pulmonary edema. The chest film in [Figure](#page-7-0) 18.4 shows the classic appearance of "cardiogenic" pulmonary edema, with infiltrates spreading out from the hilar regions bilaterally. Pleural effusions are also commonplace with cardiogenic pulmonary edema. (For a comparison with "noncardiogenic pulmonary edema", see Chapter 24).

#### *Cardiorenal Syndrome*

Heart failure is often accompanied by renal insufficiency, which had been attributed to a reduction in cardiac output. However, there is no correlation between cardiac output and renal dysfunction in patients with heart failure (14), and renal autoregulation typically maintains renal blood flow until the mean arterial pressure drops below 70 mm Hg (15). Observations like these have led to the notion that *the renal dysfunction in acute heart failure is primarily the result of increased venous pressure* (which impairs glomerular blood flow by reducing the renal arteriovenous pressure gradient), and that a low cardiac output plays a role only in patients with hypotension (i.e., cardiogenic shock). This new entity (where venous congestion links heart failure and renal failure) is known as the *cardio-renal syndrome* [\(5](#page-14-2),16), and the principal treatment is diuresis.

#### **Biomarkers**

Plasma levels of natriuretic peptides are recommended in patients who present with signs of acute heart failure [\(2](#page-14-1)). The principal peptide that is assayed is brain-type or B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), which is released as a prohormone (proBNP) from both ventricles in response to increased wall tension. The prohormone is cleaved to form BNP (the active hormone) and Nterminal (NT)-proBNP, which is metabolically inactive. The clearance of BNP and NT-proBNP is primarily via the kidneys. However, peptide receptors in adipose tissue also contribute to peptide clearance (17), which may explain why plasma BNP and NT-proBNP levels are lower in obese patients [\(2](#page-14-1)). NT-proBNP has a longer half-life than BNP, resulting in plasma levels that are 3–5 times higher than BNP levels.

From Reference 2.

#### *Diagnostic Value*

Heart failure is unlikely if BNP levels are <100 picograms/mL (18,19), or NT-proBNP levels are <300 picograms/mL (20). However, there are several conditions other than heart failure that can elevate natriuretic peptide levels, as shown in [Table](#page-7-1) 18.2. Because of the nonspecific nature of elevated peptide levels (especially in critically ill patients), *natriuretic peptide levels are better suited for excluding the presence of heart failure* [\(2](#page-14-1)).

## **MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES**

The management described here is for acute left-sided heart failure that does not result in cardiogenic shock; i.e., is not associated with hypotension or elevated plasma lactate levels. (The management of cardiogenic shock is described in Chapter 16.) As mentioned earlier, this condition typically presents with signs and symptoms related to pulmonary venous congestion. The initial approach is dictated by the blood pressure.

#### **High Blood Pressure**

Hypertension is common in acute heart failure [\(2](#page-14-1)), and is often a secondary phenomenon (e.g., from agitation, hypoxemia, etc.), but occasionally is the primary problem (e.g., hypertensive emergency). In this situation, management begins with infusion of a vasodilator like the ones in [Table](#page-8-0) 18.3 [\(2](#page-14-1),21).

#### *Vasodilators*

The vasodilators in [Table](#page-8-0) 18.3 are capable of dilating both arteries and veins, and will decrease both ventricular preload and afterload. The decrease in preload reduces venous congestion in the lungs, and the decrease in afterload promotes cardiac output. The overall effect is a decrease in arterial blood pressure, an increase in cardiac output, and a decrease in hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary capillaries.

The<br>effective dose is 2–5 µg/kg/min in most cases, and the maximum dose allowed is 10 µg/kg/min.<br>2. To reduce the risk of cyanide toxicity, avoid prolonged infusions at >3 µg/kg/min, and do not use<br>the drug in patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency. Thiosulfate (500 mg) can be added to the<br>infusate to bind the cyanide released from nitroprusside.<br>3. Not recommended for heart failure associated with coronary ischemia (see text for explanation). |  |  |

**NITROGLYCERIN:** Nitroglycerin is the vasodilator of choice for hypertensive acute heart failure ([2\)](#page-14-1). The drug binds to soft plastics like polyvinylchloride (PVC), which is a common constituent of the plastic bags and tubing used for intravenous infusions. *As much as 80% of nitroglycerin can be lost to adsorption in PVC-based infusion systems* (22), so it is imperative to use glass bottles and polyethylene tubing when infusing nitroglycerin.

Infusions of nitroglycerin should not continue for longer than 24 hours, because *tachyphylaxis* is common after 24 hours of continuous infusion [\(2](#page-14-1)). Prolonged infusions of nitroglycerin can also produce *propylene glycol toxicity* (23), which is characterized by lactic

acidosis, delirium, hypotension, and multiorgan failure in severe cases (24), and is a result of the propylene glycol used as a solvent to promote the water solubility of intravenous nitroglycerin. Finally, very high doses of nitroglycerin can produce *methemoglobinemia*, due to the breakdown of nitroglycerin to nitrite ions, which can oxidize hemoglobin to form methemoglobin (25). However, this almost never occurs during therapeutic drug dosing.

**NITROPRUSSIDE:** About 20% of patients with acute heart failure are resistant to nitroglycerin ([2\)](#page-14-1), and in this situation, nitroprusside is available as an alternate vasodilator. Unfortunately, the nitroprusside molecule contains 5 cyanide atoms, and release of the cyanide during nitroprusside breakdown can lead to life-threatening *cyanide intoxication* (26). Both the liver and kidneys participate in cyanide clearance, and thus *nitroprusside is not recommended in patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency*. Thiosulfate binds cyanide and reduces the risk of cyanide toxicity (26), and sodium thiosulfate can be added to nitroprusside infusions as a preventive measure (see [Table](#page-8-0) 18.3).

Nitroprusside has an additional risk in patients with ischemic heart disease because it can produce a *coronary steal syndrome* by diverting blood flow away from ischemic regions of the myocardium (27). Because of this risk, *nitroprusside is not recommended in patients with ischemic heart disease.*

Acute treatment with an intravenous diuretic (described later) is considered only after vasodilator therapy has normalized the blood pressure, *and* there is continued evidence of venous congestion. The most popular diuretic, *intravenous furosemide, produces an acute vasoconstrictor response* (28) by stimulating renin release and promoting the formation of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. Because of this response, intravenous furosemide should delayed until the blood pressure is controlled with vasodilator therapy.

For patients with indwelling pulmonary artery catheters, the desired pulmonary artery wedge pressure in left heart failure is the highest pressure that will augment cardiac output without producing pulmonary edema. This pressure usually corresponds to a wedge pressure of 18 to 20 mm Hg (29). Therefore, diuretic therapy can be added if the wedge pressure remains above 20 mm Hg during vasodilator therapy. The specifics of diuretic therapy are described later.

#### **Normal Blood Pressure**

For acute heart failure with a normal blood pressure, vasodilator therapy with nitroglycerin is a consideration if there is evidence of reduced peripheral blood flow (e.g., increased PCO<sup>2</sup> gap). Otherwise, an intravenous diuretic (most often furosemide) is indicated, and there is evidence that *administration of a diuretic within one hour of presentation is associated with improved outcomes* (30).

#### *Diuretic Therapy*

At the outset, there are three concerns about intravenous diuretics in acute heart failure that deserve mention:

1. Intravenous furosemide causes a *decrease* in cardiac output in acute heart failure (31–33). This

is the combined result of a decrease in venous return and an increase in left ventricular afterload; the latter effect being attributed to an acute vasoconstrictor response mentioned earlier (28).

- 2. The presence of pulmonary edema in acute heart failure is not evidence of fluid overload, and could be the result of an increase in pulmonary venous pressures from ischemic myocardial "stunning" (often called "flash" pulmonary edema). Diuretics should be used cautiously in this situation.
- 3. Diuretics should be used cautiously in acute heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) because there can be a decrease in cardiac filling in this form of heart failure.

Evidence of a decrease in tissue perfusion after an intravenous diuretic should prompt consideration of vasodilator therapy (e.g., with nitroglycerin) (33), and sometimes a bolus dose of intravenous fluids is advantageous in this situation.

| Furosemide              | 1. For patients who are furosemide-naïve, start with an IV dose of 40 mg (for normal renal function)<br>or 60–80 mg (for renal impairment).                                                                                      |  |  |  |
|                         | 2. For patients already receiving furosemide, start with an IV dose equal to the total daily furosemide<br>dose.                                                                                                                 |  |  |  |
|                         | 3. If response not satisfactory after 2 hrs, double the dose, and continue this, if necessary, to a<br>maximum dose of 200 mg.                                                                                                   |  |  |  |
|                         | 4. The effective IV dose is then given twice daily.                                                                                                                                                                              |  |  |  |
| Bumetanide<br>Torsemide | 1. These loop diuretics have a greater bioavailability than furosemide, and can be effective in cases<br>of furosemide resistance.                                                                                               |  |  |  |
|                         | 2. Dose equivalence: 40 mg furosemide = 1 mg bumetanide = 20 mg torsemide                                                                                                                                                        |  |  |  |
| Metolazone              | 1. A thiazide diuretic that can augment the effect of loop diuretics.<br>2. Dose is 2.5–10 mg PO daily, and should be given a few hours prior to the loop diuretic.<br>3. Combination therapy increases the risk of hypokalemia. |  |  |  |

**FUROSEMIDE:** Furosemide is the most popular diuretic for the treatment of heart failure, and acts by blocking sodium reabsorption in the ascending loop of Henle (a "loop diuretic"). The following are some relevant points about furosemide dosing in acute heart failure. (See also [Table](#page-10-0) 18.4.)

- 1. Following an intravenous dose of furosemide, diuresis begins within 5 minutes, peaks at 20–60 minutes, and lasts 2 hours (34).
- 2. For patients who are not on outpatient therapy with furosemide, the initial intravenous dose is 40 mg if renal function is normal. Higher doses (60–80 mg) are needed in the presence of renal insufficiency (35).
- 3. For patients who are receiving furosemide as an outpatient, the initial IV dose should be equivalent to the total daily outpatient dose (35).

- 4. If the diuresis is not adequate (at least 1 liter) at 2 hours after the initial dose, the dose is doubled, and this is continued until a satisfactory response is achieved, or the furosemide dose reaches 200 mg. Failure to respond to an IV dose of 200 mg is evidence of furosemide resistance.
- 5. The effective IV dose of furosemide is then given twice daily. When the venous congestion (e.g., pulmonary edema) is no longer problematic, the drug can be given orally. Although IV and oral doses are often used interchangeably, only 50% of an oral dose of furosemide is absorbed (36), so oral dosing may need to be adjusted upwards to maintain an equivalent response.

#### *Furosemide Resistance*

Critically ill patients can have an attenuated response to furosemide, particularly with continued use. This may be the result of hypoalbuminemia (because furosemide is highly protein-bound), renal hypoperfusion, or "diuretic braking' (i.e., decreased responsiveness as hypervolemia resolves) (37). The following options are available when the diuretic response to furosemide is inadequate.

**TRY ANOTHER LOOP DIURETIC:** Bumetanide and torsemide are loop diuretics that have a greater bioavailability than furosemide, and will occasionally produce satisfactory diuresis in cases of furosemide resistance. For equivalent dosing, *40 mg of furosemide is equivalent to 1 mg of bumetanide or 20 mg of torsemide* (35).

**ADD A THIAZIDE:** Thiazide diuretics have a different mechanism of action than loop diuretics (i.e., they block sodium reabsorption in the distal renal tubules), and addition of a thiazide can augment the diuretic response to furosemide. The thiazide most favored for this purpose is *metolazone* because it retains its efficacy in renal insufficiency (37). The dose of metolazone is 2.5–10 mg daily in a single oral dose. The response to metolazone begins at one hour and peaks at 9 hours, so the metolazone dose should be given a few hours prior to the furosemide dose. One concern that deserves mention is that *combined treatment with thiazides and loop diuretics increases the risk of hypokalemia*.

#### *Continuous-Infusion Diuretics*

For patients who are massively volume-overloaded, continuous infusions of a loop diuretic can produce a more sustained diuresis than bolus drug injection (38), although this is not a consistent finding (39). The following is a dosing regimen for continuous-infusion furosemide (40):

- 1. Start with an IV bolus dose of 80 mg.
- 2. If the estimated GFR is ≥30 mL/1.73 m2, start the furosemide infusion at 5 mg/hr. If this does not produce the desired response (i.e., urine output ≥100 mL/hr), give a second bolus dose and increase the infusion rate to 10 mg/hr. Thereafter, the infusion rate can be increased, if needed, to a maximum rate of 40 mg/hr.
- 3. If the estimated GFR is <30 mL/1.73 m2, start the furosemide infusion at 20 mg/hr. If this does not produce the desired response (i.e., urine output ≥100 mL/hr), give a second bolus dose and increase the infusion rate to 40 mg/hr.

#### **Long-Term Therapies**

The following therapies, which are outlined in [Table](#page-12-0) 18.5, have shown evidence of improved long-term outcomes and reduced hospitalizations for patients with heart failure [\(2](#page-14-1)). *The principal benefit of these therapies is in heart failure associated with reduced ejection fraction* (HFrEF) ([2\)](#page-14-1), but they are also popular in cases of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), if tolerated. All treatments are oral, and are started (or continued) after the acute episode has resolved, and the patient's condition has stabilized. These therapies are NOT advised for patients with hypotension or evidence of impaired tissue perfusion.

#### *RAA Suppression*

Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system are recommended for all patients with HFrEF ([2\)](#page-14-1). RAA suppressant drugs include angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), and the combination of an ARB and a neprilysin inhibitor. (Neprilysin is an enzyme that degrades natriuretic peptides.)

All RAA suppressant drugs are considered effective in improving long-term outcomes in patients with HFrEF, and may derive their benefit via left ventricular remodeling [\(2](#page-14-1)). *The most effective drug (at this time) is a combination drug that contains sacubitril (a neprilysin inhibitor) and valsartan (an ARB)* [\(2](#page-14-1),41). The dosing regimen is shown in [Table](#page-12-0) 18.5. Low doses are given initially (especially in patients who do not have hypertension), and the dose is gradually increased to the target level over a 4–8 week period (41).

**CONCERNS:** There are several potential complications with RAA suppression, including hypotension, worsening renal function, hyperkalemia, and angioedema. These drugs are contraindicated in patients with a history of angioedema from any cause. Also worthy of mention is that RAA suppression has shown no consistent benefit in patients with heart failure associated with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) ([2\)](#page-14-1).

#### *Beta Blockers*

Long-term treatment with beta blockers is recommended for all patients with HFrEF ([2\)](#page-14-1). The drugs that have proven effective in improving long-term outcomes include *carvedilol* and *sustained-release metoprolol (succinate),* and the dosing regimens for these agents is shown in [Table](#page-12-0) 18.5. *De novo* therapy is started at low doses and gradually advanced to target levels.

**CONCERNS:** Sudden withdrawal of beta blockers can result in a hyperadrenergic state known as "beta blocker rebound" (42). Therefore, for patients on long-term beta blocker therapy, treatment should be restarted as soon as the patient's condition has stabilized. Also worthy of mention is that the current guidelines for managing heart failure [\(2](#page-14-1)) includes no recommendation for beta blockers in heart failure associated with preserved ejection fraction.

#### *SGLT2 Inhibitors*

For unclear reasons, oral hypoglycemic therapy with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors is associated with improved long-term outcomes in heart failure. This effect is independent of the glucose-lowering effect of the drugs, and occurs in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients (43). SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended for all patients with advanced heart failure (both HFrEF and HFpEF), regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes [\(2](#page-14-1)). The specific drugs and recommended doses are shown in [Table](#page-12-0) 18.5.

**CONCERNS:** There is an increased risk of *euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis* with SGLT2 inhibitors (44).

#### *Aldosterone Antagonists*

Aldosterone antagonists block sodium reabsorption in the renal collecting ducts, and can augment the diuretic effect of loop diuretics. These drugs (i.e., spironolactone, eplerenone) have shown a survival benefit in patients with HFrEF ([2\)](#page-14-1), and the recommended dosing regimens are shown in [Table](#page-12-0) 18.5. As with all diuretics, these drugs should be used cautiously in cases of heart failure associated with a preserved ejection fraction, where the diastolic dysfunction can impair ventricular filling.

**CONCERNS:** Aldosterone antagonists can promote hyperkalemia, and should not be used in patients with renal failure (i.e., GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) or recent problems with hyperkalemia.

## **Positive Pressure Breathing**

Positive intrathoracic pressures will reduce left ventricular afterload by decreasing the transmural wall pressure developed by the ventricle during systole. This promotes ventricular emptying by facilitating the inward movement of the ventricular wall during systole. As a result, positive pressure breathing can augment the stroke output of the left ventricle (see Figure 11.5).

Clinical studies have demonstrated that breathing with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) increases cardiac output in patients with left-sided heart failure (45), and hastens clinical improvement in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema (46,47). As a result of these observations, noninvasive positive-pressure breathing has become an accepted treatment

modality for acute heart failure associated with pulmonary edema.

## **A FINAL WORD**

#### **Be Cautious with Diuretics**

The principle consequence in heart failure (other than cardiogenic shock) is venous congestion, hence the popular term "congestive heart failure", and the popular use of diuretics. However, the following are reasons to avoid the overzealous use of diuretic therapy in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.

- 1. The presence of acute, cardiogenic pulmonary edema is not always evidence of fluid overload, as the problem may be acute myocardial stiffening from cardiac ischemia, as seen in "flash pulmonary edema".
- 2. Intravenous furosemide causes a decrease in cardiac output in acute heart failure (31–33) via the dual effect of a drug-induced increase in left ventricular afterload (28) and a diuresisinduced decrease in ventricular preload.
- 3. The tendency for diuresis to decrease cardiac output will be magnified in the 50% of cases of heart failure due to myocardial stiffening (i.e., heart failure with preserved ejection fraction), which impairs cardiac filling during diastole.

The above concerns might explain the observation that diuretic management in acute heart failure improves outcomes only when the diuretic dosing is limited (48).
