# **Nutritional Requirements**

The more impure bodies are fed,. the more diseased they will become

Hippocrates Aphorisms

The fundamental goal of nutritional support is to provide the daily nutrient and energy needs of each patient. This chapter describes what is known about providing those needs, according to the most recent clinical practice guidelines (1–3) and expert commentaries (4,5) on the subject. However, it is important to mention at the outset that it is impossible to accurately determine the nutritional needs of critically ill patients, or whether we should be feeding "impure bodies", at all. This latter point (i.e., the notion that feeding critically ill patients can be harmful) is the focus of the very last section of this chapter.

#### **DAILY ENERGY EXPENDITURE**

#### **Oxidation of Nutritional Fuels**

The energy from the sun is stored in the covalent carbon bonds that hold organic (carbon-based) molecules together. Carbon bonds have differing amounts of stored energy (e.g., double bonds have more energy than single bonds), and molecules that are rich in high-energy carbon bonds are known as *fuels*. The energy in organic fuels is released by a chemical reaction with oxygen, which breaks the carbon bonds and releases the energy. This reaction is known as *oxidation*.

The oxidative metabolism of *nutritional fuels* (i.e., lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates) releases the stored energy and utilizes it to sustain life. This process consumes oxygen, and generates carbon dioxide, water, and heat. The quantities involved in the oxidation of each type of nutritional fuel are shown in Table 48.1. The following points deserve mention.

- . The energy yield from nutritional fuels is expressed as heat production (in kilocalories or kcal per gram of fuel).
- . The energy yield is highest with lipids (9.1 kcal/g) and lowest with carbohydrates (3.7 kcal/g).
- . The respiratory quotient (RQ) is a measure of the  $CO_2$  production (VCO<sub>2</sub>) relative to the  $O_2$  consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>) (i.e., RQ = VCO<sub>2</sub>/VO<sub>2</sub>). Carbohydrates have the highest RQ (1.0), and

lipids have the lowest (0.7).

|               |                                                |  |  |  |
|               |                                                |  |  |  |
|               |                                                |  |  |  |
|               |                                                |  |  |  |

The oxidative metabolism of all three nutritional fuels determines the whole body VO<sup>2</sup> , VCO<sup>2</sup> , and RQ. The VO<sup>2</sup> and VCO<sup>2</sup> can be used to determine the energy expenditure (see next) while the whole-body RQ indicates the balance of energy being provided by the nutritional fuels (e.g., an RQ of 1.0 indicates that carbohydrates are the predominant fuel source).

### **Indirect Calorimetry**

It is not possible to directly measure energy expenditure (i.e., heat production) in hospitalized patients. However, it is possible to calculate the resting energy expenditure (REE) from the whole-body VO<sup>2</sup> and VCO<sup>2</sup> using the following equation ([6\)](#page-13-4):

REE (kcal/min) = 
$$(3.6 \times VO_2) + (1.1 \times VCO_2) - 61$$
 (48.1)

This is the principle of *indirect calorimetry*, which measures the whole-body VO<sup>2</sup> and VCO<sup>2</sup> to derive the energy expenditure.

### *Methodology*

Indirect calorimetry is performed with "metabolic carts" that measure whole-body VO<sup>2</sup> and VCO<sup>2</sup> at the bedside by measuring the concentrations of O<sup>2</sup> and CO<sup>2</sup> in inhaled and exhaled gas. This can be done in spontaneously breathing patients (using a special canopy placed over the patient's head) and during mechanical ventilation (by placing O<sup>2</sup> and CO<sup>2</sup> sensors in line with the ventilator tubing) ([7\)](#page-13-5). Steady-state measurements are obtained for 15–30 minutes to determine the REE (kcal/min), which is then multiplied by 1,440 (the number of minutes in 24 hours) to derive the daily energy expenditure (kcal/24 hr). Clinical studies have shown that REE measurements obtained over 30 minutes and extrapolated to 24 hours are equivalent to REE measurements performed for 24 hours ([8\)](#page-13-6). The oxygen sensor in the newest indirect calorimetry devices is accurate to inhaled O<sup>2</sup> concentrations up to 70% ([9\)](#page-13-7), which is an improvement over the prior upper limit of 60% [\(10](#page-13-8)). However, there is still the risk that indirect calorimetry will be unreliable when the inhaled O<sup>2</sup> concentration is above 70%.

*All clinical practice guidelines recommend indirect calorimetry for determining the daily energy needs in critically ill patients* [\(1](#page-13-0)[–3](#page-13-1)). However, indirect calorimetry is not universally

available, because the equipment is expensive, and it requires trained personnel to operate. When indirect calorimetry is not available, the REE can be estimated, as described next.

### **A Simple Formula**

There are more than 200 cumbersome equations available for estimating daily energy requirements, but none is considered more predictive than the following relationship:

REE (kcal/day) = 
$$25 \times \text{body weight (kg)}$$
 (48.2)

This simple predictive relationship is considered suitable for estimating daily energy requirements when indirect calorimetry is not available ([2,](#page-13-9)[3\)](#page-13-1). Actual body weight is used unless it is 25% higher than ideal body weight. When actual body weight is more than 125% of ideal body weight, the adjusted body weight is recommended, using the following equation [\(11](#page-13-10)):

Adjusted weight (kg) = 
$$[(actual - ideal weight) \times 0.25] + ideal weight$$
 (48.3)

### **Recommendations**

Some form of nutrition support should be provided within 24–48 hours of ICU admission [\(1](#page-13-0)[–3](#page-13-1)). However, the most recent guidelines recommend that nutrition support should begin at REE levels that are less than the measured or estimated REE ([1,](#page-13-0)[3\)](#page-13-1). The basis for this recommendation is evidence that endogenous nutritional adjustments (e.g., increased gluconeogenesis) are operative in the early stages of acute illness, and adding a normal nutritional intake to these adjustments results in overfeeding (which can result in hyperglycemia and lipogenesis) ([12\)](#page-13-11). In patients who are malnourished at the outset, avoiding aggressive early nutrition will also reduce the risk of the refeeding syndrome ([13\)](#page-13-12).

The following recommendations are from the European guidelines for nutrition support ([3\)](#page-13-1):

- 1. If indirect calorimetry is used to measure REE, then no more than 70% of the REE should be provided for the first 3 days of nutrition support. Thereafter, the REE can be gradually increased to 100% over the remainder of the first week.
- 2. If predictive equations are used to estimate REE, then no more than 70% of the REE should be provided for the first 7 days of nutrition support.
- 3. In patients who require norepinephrine doses >0.2 μg/kg/min (>14 μg/min in a 70 kg adult), a daily caloric intake of 10–15 kcal/kg/day should be considered for 7 days, or until the clinical condition improves ([5\)](#page-13-3).

## **SUBSTRATE REQUIREMENTS**

The daily energy requirement should be provided by nonprotein calories from carbohydrates and lipids, while protein intake is used to maintain essential enzymatic and structural proteins.

### **Carbohydrates**

Standard nutrition regimens use carbohydrates to provide about 70% of the nonprotein calories. The human body has limited carbohydrate stores ([Table](#page-3-0) 48.2), and daily intake of carbohydrates

is considered necessary to ensure proper functioning of the central nervous system, which uses about 100–120 grams of glucose daily ([3\)](#page-13-1). Therefore, a daily carbohydrate intake of at least 130 grams is advised ([3\)](#page-13-1).

Physiological stress is common in critically ill patients, and this promotes insulin resistance and hyperglycemia [\(14](#page-13-13)). In addition, excessive carbohydrate intake promotes CO<sup>2</sup> production (see [Table](#page-1-0) 48.1) and lipogenesis ([14\)](#page-13-13). For these reasons, carbohydrate intake should be limited to no more than 5 mg/kg/min ([3\)](#page-13-1), which is about 500 grams daily in a 70 kg adult.

### **Lipids**

Standard nutrition regimens use lipids to provide approximately 30% of the daily energy needs. Dietary lipids have the highest energy yield of the three nutrient fuels [\(Table](#page-1-0) 48.1), and lipid stores in adipose tissues represent the major [endogenous](#page-3-0) fuel source in healthy adults (Table 48.2).

#### *Linoleic Acid*

Dietary lipids are triglycerides, which are composed of a glycerol molecule linked to three fatty acids. The only dietary fatty acid that is considered essential (i.e., must be provided in the diet) is linoleic acid, a long chain, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). A deficient intake of this essential fatty acid produces a clinical disorder characterized by a scaly dermopathy, cardiac dysfunction, and increased susceptibility to infections ([15\)](#page-13-14). This disorder is prevented by providing 0.5% of the dietary fatty acids as linoleic acid. Soybean oil is used as the source of linoleic acid in most nutritional support regimens.

#### *Propofol*

Propofol, an intravenous anesthetic agent that is popular for short-term sedation in the ICU, is mixed in a 10% lipid emulsion that provides 1.1 kcal/mL ([2,](#page-13-9)[3\)](#page-13-1). As a result, *the calories provided by propofol infusions must be considered when calculating the nonprotein calories in a nutrition support regimen*. Propofol infusions can also promote hypertriglyceridemia [\(16](#page-13-15)), so triglyceride levels should be monitored during prolonged infusions of propofol.

#### *Excessive Lipid Intake*

Excessive intake of lipids, especially PUFAs (which are highly oxidizable), can lead to oxidative damage in tissues, especially the lungs [\(17](#page-13-16)), and can impair immune function [\(3](#page-13-1)). To prevent

lipid overload, *the recommended maximum lipid intake is 1.5 grams/kg per day* ([3\)](#page-13-1). (*Note:* It is also possible to adjust the type of lipid intake to reduce the risk of inflammatory injury. This is described in chapters 49 and 50.)

### **Protein Requirements**

The normal protein requirement is 0.8–1.0 grams/kg/day in healthy patients, but because hypercatabolism is common *in critically ill patients, a protein intake of 1.2– 2.0 grams/kg/day is recommended* [\(1](#page-13-0)[,2](#page-13-9)).

#### *Nitrogen Balance*

The adequacy of protein intake can be evaluated with the nitrogen balance; i.e., the difference between intake and excretion of protein-derived nitrogen. However, *patients should be in a stable condition before this evaluation is performed*.

1. *Nitrogen Excretion:* Two thirds of the nitrogen derived from protein breakdown is excreted in the urine [\(18](#page-13-17)), and about 85% of this nitrogen is contained in urea (the remainder is in ammonia and creatinine). Thus, the urinary urea nitrogen (UUN), measured in grams excreted in 24 hours, represents the bulk of nitrogen derived from protein breakdown. The remainder of the protein-derived nitrogen (usually about 4–6 grams/day) is excreted in the stool. Therefore, protein-derived nitrogen excretion can be expressed as follows:

Nitrogen Excretion 
$$(g/24 h) = UUN + (4-6)$$
 (48.4)

In the presence of diarrhea, non-urinary nitrogen losses cannot be estimated accurately, and nitrogen balance determinations are unreliable.

2. *Nitrogen Intake:* Protein is 16% nitrogen, so each gram of protein contains 1/6.25 grams of nitrogen. Therefore, protein-derived nitrogen intake is derived as follows:

Nitrogen Intake 
$$(g/24 h)$$
 = Protein Intake  $(g/24 h)/6.25$  (48.5)

3. *Nitrogen Balance:* The equations for nitrogen intake and nitrogen excretion are combined to determine the daily nitrogen balance.

Nitrogen Balance 
$$(g/24 h)$$
 = Protein Intake/6.25 -  $[UUN + (4-6)]$  (48.6)

4. The goal of nutritional support is a positive nitrogen balance of 4–6 grams.

#### *Nitrogen Balance & Nonprotein Calories*

The first step in achieving a positive nitrogen balance is to provide enough nonprotein calories to spare proteins from being degraded to provide energy. This is demonstrated in [Figure](#page-5-0) 48.1. When the daily protein intake is constant, the nitrogen balance becomes positive only when the intake of nonprotein calories is sufficient to meet the daily energy needs (i.e., the REE). Therefore, *increasing protein intake will not achieve a positive nitrogen balance unless the intake of nonprotein calories is adequate*.

## **VITAMIN REQUIREMENTS**

Thirteen vitamins are considered an essential part of the daily diet, and [Table](#page-5-1) 48.3 shows the recommended daily requirement for these vitamins in healthy adults. Daily vitamin requirements are likely to be higher in critically ill patients, and will also vary in individual patients. The following is a description of vitamin deficiencies that deserve particular attention in critically ill patients.

### **Thiamine Deficiency**

Thiamine (vitamin B<sup>1</sup> ) plays an essential role in carbohydrate metabolism, because thiamine is converted to thiamine pyrophosphate, which is a cofactor for pyruvate dehydrogenase, the enzyme that allows pyruvate to enter mitochondria and generate high-energy ATP molecules (see Figure 9.5) [\(19](#page-13-18)). Thiamine deficiency thus creates an energy deficit from impaired glucose metabolism. (There are other metabolic consequences of thiamine deficiency, which are beyond the scope of this text.) Healthy adults have a limited store of thiamine (about 30 mg), which is depleted after 2–3 weeks in the absence of thiamine intake ([19\)](#page-13-18). The normal thiamine requirement is about 1 mg/day in healthy adults (see [Table](#page-5-1) 48.3).

#### *Predisposing Factors*

There are several conditions in ICU patients that promote thiamine deficiency, and the major ones are listed in [Table](#page-6-0) 48.4. Alcoholism is considered the major cause of thiamine deficiency; an effect that is attributed to alcohol's ability to inhibit thiamine absorption from the GI tract ([20\)](#page-13-19). Thiamine deficiency has also been reported in as many as 70% of ICU patients with septic shock ([21\)](#page-13-20). Other predisposing factors that are common in ICU patients include the chronic use of furosemide ([22\)](#page-13-21), which promotes thiamine excretion by the kidneys, and magnesium depletion (23), which inhibits the conversion of thiamine to thiamine pyrophosphate (24). Thiamine deficiency has also been reported following gastric surgery for obesity (25), presumably as a result of impaired thiamine absorption from the GI tract.

**REFEEDING:** Patients who are admitted with borderline thiamine stores can become thiamine deficient when they receive a glucose load (usually from nutrition support regimens). This is similar in principle to the refeeding syndrome, although it is a distinct entity (26).

#### *Treatment*†

- 1. 500 mg thiamine IV every 8 hours for 2–3 days, then
- 2. 250 mg thiamine IV once daily for 3–5 days, then
- 3. 100 mg thiamine PO three times daily for 1–2 weeks, then
- 4. 100 mg thiamine PO once daily for maintenance therapy.

#### *Clinical Manifestations*

The clinical manifestations of thiamine deficiency are also common occurrences in ICU patients (see [Table](#page-6-0) 48.4), and include: (*a*) a cardiomyopathy, also known as "wet beriberi", (*b*) Wernicke's encephalopathy, (*c*) a peripheral neuropathy, also known as "dry beriberi", and (*d*) lactic acidosis.

**CARDIOMYOPATHY:** The cardiomyopathy associated with thiamine deficiency may be the result of increased oxidative stress (27), and it typically produces a high output heart failure (28). Thiamine deficiency from chronic furosemide use could also aggravate other forms of cardiomyopathy, although thiamine supplementation in patients with heart failure has no convincing effects on cardiac function or symptomatology (29).

**ENCEPHALOPATHY:** Wernicke's encephalopathy is the most cited consequence of thiamine deficiency. The clinical presentation is classically described as the combination of mental status changes, ocular abnormalities, and ataxia, but this "triad" occurs in only 20% of cases (30). About 80% of patients have mental status changes (e.g., somnolence, confusion, stupor), and 30% have ocular abnormalities (e.g., nystagmus, lateral gaze paralysis) (30). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can show characteristic abnormalities, like the ones in [Figure](#page-8-0) 48.2, and these may be the only clue to the diagnosis (see later).

<span id="page-8-0"></span>![](_page_8_Picture_0.jpeg)

Case courtesy of Ashutosh Gandhi, [Radiopaedia.org](http://Radiopaedia.org), rID: 19865.

**LACTIC ACIDOSIS:** As explained, thiamine deficiency impairs the movement of pyruvate into mitochondria, and this results in an increase in lactate formation (see Figure 9.5). Thiamine deficiency may be responsible for some of the lactic acidosis associated with sepsis (31), and for the lactate elevation in diabetic ketoacidosis (32). Lactate elevation of unclear etiology should always prompt suspicion of thiamine deficiency.

**PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY:** Relatively little is written about the peripheral neuropathy in thiamine deficiency, other than it often coexists with Wernicke's encephalopathy (30).

#### *Diagnosis*

The diagnosis of thiamine deficiency is challenging. Plasma thiamine levels are unreliable. Most of the thiamine in the body is present as thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), which is located predominantly in red blood cells, so a whole blood assay for TPP has some merit for evaluating thiamine status. The normal level is 63–229 nmol/L (30). However, this test is not available in many clinical laboratories, and results are often not immediately available.

Because of the limitations in the laboratory evaluation of thiamine status, thiamine deficiency is considered a clinical diagnosis (30). Unfortunately, the manifestations of thiamine deficiency are common occurrences in critically ill patients. Thiamine deficiency should be suspected when one of the manifestations (heart failure, encephalopathy, or lactic acidosis) has no apparent etiology, especially in the presence of a predisposing condition (e.g., alcohol abuse).

**IMAGING:** MRI is considered the most reliable method for confirming the diagnosis of Wernicke's encephalopathy (30). Common abnormalities include an increased T2 signal bilaterally in the medial regions of the thalamus (see [Figure](#page-8-0) 48.2), and in the hypothalamus, mamillary bodies, and midline regions of the cerebellum (30). MRI has a sensitivity of 53% and a specificity of 93% for the diagnosis of Wernicke's encephalopathy (30).

#### *Treatment*

Patients who are considered at risk for thiamine deficiency (e.g., alcoholics) are often given *thiamine in a conventional dose of 100 mg daily* (33), but this *is inadequate for correcting thiamine deficiency* (33). The recommended treatment for suspected or confirmed cases of thiamine deficiency is shown in [Table](#page-6-0) 48.4 (33,34). The intravenous route is always preferred for acute thiamine replacement, as thiamine uptake from the GI tract is often erratic in critically ill patients. When replenishing thiamine, it is important to *identify and correct magnesium deficiency*, so the infused thiamine can be utilized (by conversion to thiamine pyrophosphate).

## **Vitamin D Deficiency**

Vitamin D deficiency is reported in 40–100% of ICU patients (35). This is not surprising because the recommended daily requirement for vitamin D is 600 IU for adults (and is likely to be even higher in critically ill patients), yet enteral and parenteral nutrition regimens typically provide only about 200–400 IU of vitamin D daily.

#### *Consequences*

The major consequence of vitamin D deficiency is bone health, which should have a relatively minor impact in critically ill patients. However, vitamin D is also involved in regulation of the immune response, and vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased rates of infection in ICU patients (36).

#### *Diagnosis*

The diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency is based on the plasma concentration of a vitamin D

metabolite, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD). Plasma levels below 50 nmol/L indicate a deficiency state, and plasma levels below 30 nmol/L indicate a severe deficiency (37).

**TREATMENT:** The reliability of oral vitamin D supplementation in critically ill patients is unclear. A single IM injection of 150,000 IU of cholecalciferol can increase plasma 25-OHD levels to normal in 90% of ICU patients (37).

#### **Antioxidant Vitamins**

The following vitamins are considered major endogenous antioxidants that protect tissues against oxidative injury (38).

- 1. *Vitamin E* (α-tocopherol) is the major lipid-soluble antioxidant in the body, and protects all cell membranes from oxidative damage (39).
- 2. *Vitamin C* (ascorbic acid) is a major water-soluble antioxidant, and scavenges (detoxifies) reactive oxygen species. It is also essential for maintaining vitamin E in its active form (40).

Both antioxidant vitamins can be deficient in critically ill patients (41,42) and there is evidence that supplementing vitamin C and vitamin E can improve outcomes (43), although this is not a consistent finding (38). Nevertheless, considering that oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory-mediated organ injury (44), it seems wise to maintain adequate antioxidant protection in critically ill patients.

## **ESSENTIAL TRACE ELEMENTS**

A trace element is one that is present in amounts less than 50 μg per gram of body tissue (45). Seven trace elements are considered essential in humans (i.e., are associated with deficiency syndromes), and these are listed in [Table](#page-11-0) 48.5 along with the daily requirements for each element in healthy men and women. As mentioned for vitamins, the essential trace element requirements are likely to be higher in critically ill patients. The following trace elements deserve mention because of their relevance to oxidative tissue injury.

#### **Iron**

Healthy adults have about 4.5 grams of iron, but very little of this is free, unbound iron (46). Most of the iron in the body is bound to hemoglobin, and the remainder is bound to ferritin in tissues and transferrin in plasma. Circulating transferrin is only 30% saturated with iron, so any increase in iron will be quickly bound by transferrin, thus preventing a rise in free iron in plasma. The paucity of free iron in the body has survival value, because free iron has a pivotal role in oxidative tissue injury (47).

#### *Iron and Oxidative Injury*

Iron has two actions that promote oxidative cell injury.

1. Iron in its reduced form (Fe2+) is necessary for the production of hydroxyl radicals (see Figure 25.6), which are the most destructive of the reactive oxygen species, capable of damaging all

vital cell components.

2. Iron-induced lipid peroxidation can produce a form of regulated cell death known as *ferroptosis* (48). This process is triggered by inflammation, and it is has a major role in inflammatory tissue injury (49).

The risk of harm from free iron would explain why hypoferremia is common in conditions associated with systemic inflammation (50). This risk is also reason to avoid administering iron in critically ill patients unless there is evidence of iron depletion in tissues with resultant anemia. Tissue iron stores can be assessed with the plasma ferritin level; i.e., a ferritin level below 18 μg/L indicates probable iron deficiency, while iron deficiency is unlikely if the ferritin level exceeds 100 μg/L (51).

### **Selenium**

Selenium is an essential cofactor for the enzyme glutathione peroxidase, which is a major source of intracellular antioxidant activity (see Figure 25.7). The daily requirement for selenium is 55 μg in healthy adults (see [Table](#page-11-0) 48.5), but selenium utilization is increased in acute illness (52), and selenium deficiency is common in critically ill patients (45).

Plasma selenium levels can be monitored in patients at risk for oxidative stress (e.g., from systemic inflammation). Plasma levels below 100 μg/L are associated with reduced activity of glutathione peroxidase (53). Selenium supplementation can be given intravenously (as sodium selenite), and the maximum dose considered safe is 225 μg daily (54).

## **A FINAL WORD**

## **A Fly in the Ointment**

The rationale for providing nutrition support in critically ill patients is to prevent or alleviate malnutrition. This is a valid reason if the malnutrition is due to decreased nutrient intake (i.e., starvation), but *the malnutrition associated with critical illnesses is the result of abnormal nutrient processing*, and providing nutrients will not correct this type of malnutrition until the causative illness is corrected, and the metabolic derangements are resolved. In fact, nutrition support can be harmful in this situation (55), as explained next.

An example of abnormal nutrient processing in acute illness is the fate of a glucose load; i.e., less than 5% of glucose is metabolized to lactate in healthy subjects, while as much as 85% of a glucose load can be recovered as lactate in acutely ill patients (56). This is demonstrated in [Figure](#page-12-0) 48.3 (57). In this case, patients undergoing a major surgical procedure were randomized to receive either Ringer's lactate or a 5% dextrose solution as the IV fluid during the procedure. As indicated in the graph, the dextrose infusions (which averaged 200 grams) resulted in an increase in the plasma lactate to abnormally high levels (>2 mmol/L), which did not occur in the patients who received a dextrose-free fluid.

**FIGURE 48.3** Influence of dextrose infusions on arterial lactate levels during abdominal aortic surgery. Each data point represents a mean value for patients randomized to receive either Ringer's lactate or a 5% dextrose solution during the procedure. Total volume infused was equivalent with both fluids. Data from Reference 57.

Another potential for "nutrient harm" would be the infusion of lipids in conditions that favor oxidation (e.g. inflammation), because oxidation of the infused lipids can be a source of tissue injury ([17\)](#page-13-16), as mentioned earlier.

To summarize, because of the metabolic derangements in critical illness, nutrition support is unlikely to provide the desired nutritional benefit, and can instead be a source of harm. Maybe

this is why we lose our appetite when we get sick? It seems Hippocrates had the right idea about 2,500 years ago.
