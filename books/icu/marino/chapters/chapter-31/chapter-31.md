# **Acid-Base Analysis**

*Seek simplicity, and distrust it.*

Alfred North Whitehead (*[a](#page-12-0)*)

Acid-base physiology and pathology is one of the fundamental knowledge bases in the care of acutely ill patients, and mastery is required for the management of critically ill patients. This chapter presents a structured approach to the identification of acid-base disorders based on the relationships between the pH, PCO<sup>2</sup> and bicarbonate (HCO<sup>3</sup> ) concentration in extracellular fluid (plasma). Much of this information will be a review of what you learned in your general physiology course, but it will now be expanded for use at the bedside. A number of useful reviews are included in the bibliography at the end of the chapter [\(1](#page-12-1)[–4](#page-12-2)).

# **BASIC CONCEPTS**

# **Hydrogen Ion Concentration and pH**

The hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in aqueous solutions is traditionally expressed by the pH, which allegedly is an abbreviation for the *power of hydrogen*, and is a logarithmic function of the [H+]; i.e.,

$$pH = log (1/[H^+]) = -log [H^+]$$
 (31.1)

The physiological range of pH and corresponding [H+] is shown in [Figure](#page-1-0) 31.1. The normal pH of plasma is 7.40, which corresponds to a [H+] of 40 nEq/L.

The relationships in [Figure](#page-1-0) 31.1 show that changes in pH are not linearly related to changes in [H+]. Note that the change in [H+] in the acidotic range (60 nEq/L) is about 2.5 times greater than in the alkalotic range (24 nEq/L), which means that changes in pH will have different implications for acid-base balance at different points along the pH spectrum.

### *Hydrogen Ion as Trace Element*

Also evident in [Figure](#page-1-0) 31.1 is that the concentration of H+ is expressed in nanoequivalents per liter (nEq/L, or 10−9 Eq/L). One nanoequivalent is *one-millionth* of a milliequivalent (1 nEq = 1

 $\times$  10<sup>-6</sup> mEq), so hydrogen ions are about a million times less dense than the principal ions in extracellular fluid (sodium and chloride), whose concentrations are expressed in mEq/L. This gives hydrogen ions the status of a trace element, but it is a very influential one, as shown by the fact that the normal pH range (7.36–7.44) corresponds to a change in [H<sup>+</sup>] of less than 10 nEq/L (!).

**FIGURE 31.1** Graph describing the relationship between the extracellular (plasma) pH and hydrogen ion concentration. Note that the relationship is different in the acidotic and alkalotic ranges of plasma pH.

#### **Classification of Acid-Base Disorders**

According to traditional concepts of acid-base physiology, the  $[H^+]$  in extracellular fluid is determined by the balance between the partial pressure of carbon dioxide  $(PCO_2)$  and the concentration of bicarbonate  $[HCO_3]$  in the fluid. This relationship is expressed as follows (3):

<span id="page-1-2"></span>
$$[H^+] = 24 \times (PCO_2/HCO_3)$$
 (31.2)

The  $PCO_2/HCO_3$  ratio identifies all the primary acid-base disorders and compensatory responses, as shown in Table 31.1.

### *Primary Acid-Base Disorders*

According to [Equation](#page-1-2) 31.2, a change in either the PCO<sup>2</sup> or the HCO<sup>3</sup> will cause a change in the [H+] of extracellular fluid. When a change in PCO<sup>2</sup> initiates the change in [H+], the condition is called a *respiratory* acid-base disorder: an increase in PCO<sup>2</sup> is a *respiratory acidosis*, and a decrease in PCO<sup>2</sup> is a *respiratory alkalosis*. When a change in HCO<sup>3</sup> initiates the change in [H+], the condition is called a *metabolic* acid-base disorder: a decrease in HCO<sup>3</sup> is a *metabolic acidosis*, and an increase in HCO<sup>3</sup> is a *metabolic alkalosis*.

#### *Compensatory Responses*

Compensatory responses are designed to limit the change in [H+] produced by the primary acidbase disorder, and this is accomplished by changing the other component of the PaCO<sup>2</sup> /HCO<sup>3</sup> ratio in the same direction as the component involved in the primary acid-base disturbance. For example, if the primary change is an increase in PaCO<sup>2</sup> (respiratory acidosis), the compensatory response will be an increase in HCO<sup>3</sup> , which limits the final change in [H+]. It is important to emphasize that *compensatory responses limit, but do not correct, the change in [H+] produced by the primary acid-base disorder.* The expected compensatory changes in each of the primary acid-base disorders are shown in [Figure](#page-3-0) 31.2, and each of these is described next.

**FIGURE 31.2** Predictive equations for evaluating secondary responses to primary acid-base disorders. All equations are from Reference 3.

# **Responses to Metabolic Acid-Base Disorders**

The physiological response to a metabolic acid-base disorder is a change in minute ventilation, which is mediated by peripheral chemoreceptors in the carotid body located at the carotid bifurcation in the neck.

#### *Metabolic Acidosis*

The response to metabolic acidosis is an increase in minute ventilation (tidal volume and respiratory rate) and a subsequent decrease in PaCO<sup>2</sup> . This response appears in 30–120 minutes,

and the magnitude of the response is defined by the equation below [\(3](#page-12-3)):

$$\Delta \text{ PaCO}_2 = 1.2 \times \Delta \text{ HCO}_3 \tag{31.3}$$

Using a normal PaCO<sup>2</sup> of 40 mm Hg and a normal HCO<sup>3</sup> of 24 mEq/L, the above equation can be rewritten as follows:

Expected 
$$PaCO_2 = 40 - [1.2 \times (24 - current HCO_3)]$$
 (31.4)

**EXAMPLE:** For a metabolic acidosis with a plasma HCO<sup>3</sup> of 14 mEq/L:

- 1. The ∆ HCO<sup>3</sup> is 24 – 14 = 10 mEq/L
- 2. The ∆ PaCO<sup>2</sup> is 1.2 × 10 = 12 mm Hg
- 3. The expected PaCO<sup>2</sup> is 40 – 12 = 28 mm Hg.
  - a. If the measured PaCO<sup>2</sup> >28 mm Hg, there is a *secondary respiratory acidosis*.
  - b. If the measured PaCO<sup>2</sup> is <28 mm Hg, there is a *secondary respiratory alkalosis*.

### *Metabolic Alkalosis*

The compensatory response to metabolic alkalosis is a decrease in minute ventilation, which increases the PaCO<sup>2</sup> . This response is not as vigorous as the response to metabolic acidosis because the peripheral chemoreceptors are not very active under normal conditions, so they are more readily turned on than turned off. The expected change in PaCO<sup>2</sup> is defined by the equation below [\(3](#page-12-3)).

$$\Delta \text{ PaCO}_2 = 0.7 \times \Delta \text{ HCO}_3 \tag{31.5}$$

Using a normal PaCO<sup>2</sup> of 40 mm Hg and a normal HCO<sup>3</sup> of 24 mEq/L, the above equation can be rewritten as follows:

Expected 
$$PaCO_2 = 40 + [0.7 \times (current HCO_3 - 24)]$$
 (31.6)

**EXAMPLE:** For a metabolic alkalosis with a plasma HCO<sup>3</sup> of 40 mEq/L:

- 1. The ∆ HCO<sup>3</sup> is 40 – 24 = 16 mEq/L
- 2. The ∆ PaCO<sup>2</sup> is 0.7 × 16 = 11 mm Hg
- 3. The expected PaCO<sup>2</sup> is 40 + 11 = 51 mm Hg.
  - a. If the measured PaCO<sup>2</sup> is >51 mm Hg, there is a *secondary respiratory acidosis*.
  - b. If the measured PaCO<sup>2</sup> is <51 mm Hg, there is a *secondary respiratory alkalosis*.

# **Responses to Respiratory Acid-Base Disorders**

The compensatory response to primary changes in PaCO<sup>2</sup> occurs in the kidneys, where HCO<sup>3</sup>

reabsorption in the proximal tubules changes in the same direction as the change in PaCO<sup>2</sup> . This renal response is relatively slow, and can take 2 or 3 days to reach completion. Because of this delay, respiratory acid-base disorders are classified as acute or chronic (compensated).

### *Acute Respiratory Disorders*

Acute changes in PaCO<sup>2</sup> have a minor effect on the plasma HCO<sup>3</sup> , as described by the equations below [\(3](#page-12-3)).

For acute respiratory acidosis:

$$\Delta \text{ HCO}_3 = 0.1 \times \Delta \text{ PaCO}_2 \tag{31.7}$$

For acute respiratory alkalosis:

$$\Delta \ HCO_3 = 0.2 \times \Delta \ PaCO_2 \tag{31.8}$$

**EXAMPLE:** For an acute change in PaCO<sup>2</sup> of 20 mm Hg, the ∆ HCO<sup>3</sup> is 0.1 × 20 = 2 mEq/L for an acute respiratory acidosis, and 0.2 × 20 = 4 mEq/L for an acute respiratory alkalosis. Neither of these changes would be recognized as significant.

### *Chronic Respiratory Disorders*

The renal response to a respiratory acidosis (i.e., an increase in PaCO<sup>2</sup> ) is an increase in HCO<sup>3</sup> reabsorption in the proximal renal tubules, which raises the plasma HCO<sup>3</sup> concentration. The response to a respiratory alkalosis (i.e., a decrease in PaCO<sup>2</sup> ) is a decrease in renal HCO<sup>3</sup> reabsorption, which lowers the plasma HCO<sup>3</sup> concentration. The magnitude of this response is similar, regardless of the directional change in PaCO<sup>2</sup> , so the equation below applies to both chronic respiratory acidosis and alkalosis.

$$\Delta HCO_3 = 0.4 \times \Delta PaCO_2 \tag{31.9}$$

Using a normal PaCO<sup>2</sup> of 40 mm Hg and a normal HCO<sup>3</sup> of 24 mEq/L, the above equation can be rewritten as follows:

For chronic respiratory acidosis:

Expected 
$$HCO_3 = 24 + [0.4 \times (current PaCO_2 - 40)]$$
 (31.10)

For chronic respiratory alkalosis:

Expected 
$$HCO_3 = 24 - [0.4 \times (40 - \text{current PaCO}_2)]$$
 (31.11)

**EXAMPLE:** For an increase in PaCO<sup>2</sup> to 60 mm Hg that persists for at least a few days:

- 1. The ∆ PaCO<sup>2</sup> is 60 – 40 = 20 mm Hg,
- 2. The ∆ HCO<sup>3</sup> is 0.4 × 20 = 8 mEq/L,

# **STEPWISE APPROACH TO ACID BASE ANALYSIS**

The following is a structured, rule-based approach to the diagnosis of primary, secondary, and mixed acid-base disorders using the relationships between the [H+], PCO<sup>2</sup> , and HCO<sup>3</sup> just described. Several examples are included as instructional aids. The reference ranges for arterial pH, PCO<sup>2</sup> and HCO<sup>3</sup> are shown below.

> pH = 7.36–7.44 PCO<sup>2</sup> = 36–44 mm Hg HCO<sup>3</sup> = 22–26 mEq/L

## **Stage I: Identify Primary Acid-Base Disorders**

The first stage of the approach uses the directional changes in the PaCO<sup>2</sup> and pH to identify the primary acid-base disorder.

*Rule 1:* If the PaCO<sup>2</sup> and pH are both abnormal, compare the directional change.

- *1a:* If the PaCO<sup>2</sup> and pH change in the same direction, there is a primary metabolic acid-base disorder.
- *1b:* If the PaCO<sup>2</sup> and pH change in opposite directions, there is a primary respiratory acidbase disorder.

**EXAMPLE:** Consider a case where the arterial pH = 7.23 and the PaCO<sup>2</sup> = 23 mm Hg. The pH and PaCO<sup>2</sup> are both reduced (indicating a primary metabolic disorder) and the pH is low (indicating an acidosis), so the diagnosis is a *primary metabolic acidosis*.

*Rule 2:* When the PaCO<sup>2</sup> is abnormal but the pH is normal, the condition can be called a *mixed* metabolic and respiratory disorder. The directional change in PaCO<sup>2</sup> identifies the type of respiratory disorder, and the metabolic disorder is then in the opposite direction. (This rule is based on the notion that compensatory responses do not correct the primary acidbase change.)

**EXAMPLE:** Consider a case where the arterial pH = 7.41 and the PaCO<sup>2</sup> = 60 mm Hg. Only the PaCO<sup>2</sup> is abnormal, so there is a mixed metabolic and respiratory disorder. The PaCO<sup>2</sup> is elevated, indicating a respiratory acidosis, so the metabolic disorder must be a metabolic alkalosis.

# **Stage II: Identify Secondary Acid-Base Disorders**

The second stage uses the expected compensatory responses to identify any additional or secondary acid-base disorders. (*Note:* If a mixed acid-base disorder was identified in Stage I, this stage is not necessary).

*Rule 3:* For a primary metabolic disorder, determine the expected PaCO<sup>2</sup> . *3a:* If the measured PaCO<sup>2</sup> is higher than expected, there is a secondary respiratory acidosis.

*3b:* If the measured PaCO<sup>2</sup> is lower than expected, there is a secondary respiratory alkalosis. **EXAMPLE:** Consider a case where the arterial pH = 7.28, PaCO<sup>2</sup> = 23 mm Hg, and the HCO<sup>3</sup> = 14 mEq/L. The pH and PaCO<sup>2</sup> change in the same direction, indicating a primary metabolic disorder, and the pH is below normal, indicating an acidosis, so the disorder is a primary metabolic acidosis. Using Equations 31.3 and 31.4:

- 1. The ∆ PaCO<sup>2</sup> is 1.2 × (24 – 14) = 12 mm Hg,
- 2. The expected PaCO<sup>2</sup> is then 40 – 12 = 28 mm Hg.

The measured PaCO<sup>2</sup> (23 mm Hg) is lower than the expected PaCO<sup>2</sup> , so there is an additional respiratory alkalosis. Therefore, this condition is a *primary metabolic acidosis with a secondary respiratory alkalosis*.

*Rule 4:* For a primary respiratory disorder, determine the expected HCO<sup>3</sup> for both acute and chronic (compensated) conditions. If the measured HCO<sup>3</sup> is between the expected HCO<sup>3</sup> for the acute and chronic conditions, it is a *partially compensated respiratory disorder*.

*4a:* For a primary respiratory acidosis,

- 1. If the measured HCO<sup>3</sup> is less than the expected HCO<sup>3</sup> for the acute condition, there is a secondary metabolic acidosis.
- 2. If the measured HCO<sup>3</sup> is higher than expected for the chronic condition, there is a secondary metabolic alkalosis.

*4b:* For a primary respiratory alkalosis:

- 1. If the HCO<sup>3</sup> is higher than expected for the acute condition, there is a secondary metabolic alkalosis.
- 2. If the HCO<sup>3</sup> is lower than expected for the chronic condition, there is a secondary metabolic acidosis.

**EXAMPLE:** Consider a case where the PaCO<sup>2</sup> = 26 mm Hg, the pH = 7.50, and the HCO<sup>3</sup> = 14 mEq/L. The PaCO<sup>2</sup> and pH change in opposite directions, indicating a primary respiratory disorder, and the pH is alkaline, so the disorder is a primary respiratory alkalosis. Using Equations 31.8 and 31.9:

- 1. The ∆ PCO<sup>2</sup> is 40 – 26 = 14 mm Hg
- 2. The acute ∆ HCO<sup>3</sup> should be 0.2 × 14 = 3 mEq/L
- 3. The chronic ∆ HCO<sup>3</sup> should be 0.4 × 14 = 6 mEq/L
- 4. The expected HCO<sup>3</sup> range is then 18–21 mEq/L.

The measured HCO<sup>3</sup> is 14 mEq/L, which is lower than the expected range of HCO<sup>3</sup> values, so this condition is a *primary respiratory alkalosis with a secondary metabolic acidosis*.

### **Stage III: Use The "Gaps" to Evaluate a Metabolic Acidosis**

The final stage of this approach is for patients with a metabolic acidosis, where the use of measurements called "gaps" can help to uncover the underlying cause of the acidosis. These are described in the next section.

# **THE GAPS**

There are numerous potential sources of a metabolic acidosis in critically ill patients, and the measurements described in this section are designed to help narrow the list of suspects.

### **The Anion Gap**

The anion gap is a rough estimate of the relative abundance of unmeasured anions, and is used to determine if a metabolic acidosis is due to an accumulation of non-volatile acids (e.g., lactic acid) or a primary loss of bicarbonate (e.g., diarrhea) [\(5](#page-12-4)[,6](#page-12-5)).

### *Determinants*

To achieve electrochemical balance, the concentration of negatively charged anions must equal the concentration of positively charged cations. This electrochemical balance is expressed in the equation shown below using the most abundant electrolytes in the extracellular fluid, along with the unmeasured cations (UC) and unmeasured anions (UA).

$$(Na) + UC = (CL + HCO_3) + UA$$
 (31.12)

Rearranging the terms in this equation yields the following relationships:

<span id="page-8-0"></span>
$$(Na) - (CL + HCO_3) = UA - UC$$
 (31.13)

The difference (UA − UC) is a measure of the relative abundance of unmeasured anions in extracellular fluid, and is called the *anion gap* (AG). The electrolytes in [Equation](#page-8-0) 31.13 are all routinely obtained in hospitalized patients, and this provides a simple and readily available method for calculating the AG.

$$AG = (Na) - (CL + HCO_3)$$
 (31.14)

**REFERENCE RANGE:** The reference range for the AG is typically stated as 8–12 mEq/L ([5,](#page-12-4)[6\)](#page-12-5), but electrolyte measurements can differ slightly in different clinical laboratories, so each laboratory should publish their reference range for the AG.

#### *Influence of Albumin*

The [unmeasured](#page-9-0) anions and cations that normally contribute to the anion gap are shown in Table 31.2. Note that albumin is the principal unmeasured anion, and thus is the principal determinant

of the anion gap. Albumin is a weak acid that contributes about 2.5 mEq per gram to the anion gap [\(5](#page-12-4),7). A low albumin level in plasma will lower the AG, and this could mask the presence of an unmeasured anion (e.g., lactate) that is contributing to a metabolic acidosis. Since hypoalbuminemia is present in as many as 90% of ICU patients, the following formula for the "corrected AG" (AGc) is recommended (7):

Corrected AG = AG + 
$$[2.5 \times (4.5 - \text{albumin})]$$
 (31.15)

where 4.5 represents the normal concentration of albumin in plasma (in g/dL).

**EXAMPLE:** For a patient with a normal AG of 10 mEq/L and a plasma albumin of 2 g/dL, the corrected AG is 10 + (2.5 × 2.5) = 16 mEq/L, so the albumin conversion turned a normal AG into an elevated AG, which has significant implications for determining the cause of a metabolic acidosis, as explained next.

|               |                                           |  |  |

### *Using the Anion Gap*

The AG can be used to identify the underlying mechanism of a metabolic acidosis, which then helps to identify the underlying clinical condition. An elevated AG occurs when there is an accumulation of fixed or non-volatile acids (e.g., lactic acid), while a normal AG occurs when there is a primary loss of bicarbonate (e.g., diarrhea) (7) . [Table](#page-9-1) 31.3 shows the causes of metabolic acidosis grouped according to the AG.

<sup>†</sup>Also known as 5-oxoproline, and associated with chronic acetaminophen ingestion.

**HIGH ANION GAP:** Common causes of high AG metabolic acidosis include lactic acidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis, and advanced renal failure (where there is loss of H+ secretion in the distal tubules of the kidneys). Also included are toxic ingestions of methanol (which produces formic acid), ethylene glycol (which produces oxalic acid), and salicylates (which produce salicylic acid) [\(5](#page-12-4)). Two often unrecognized causes of a high gap metabolic acidosis that deserve mention are summarized as follows.

- 1. Lactic acid has two optical isomers (named *dextro* and *levo* by the direction of light reflection), and most clinical laboratories measure only the levo form (L-lactic acid). However, some gut microbes can produce D-lactic acid from carbohydrate metabolism, and a high anion gap metabolic acidosis from elevated D-lactate levels has been reported in patients with short bowel syndrome (8). These patients often develop neurologic manifestations, such as confusion, agitation, ataxia, and nystagmus (9). Although this is an uncommon condition, it will be missed unless a formal request for a D-lactate measurement is submitted to the hospital laboratory. Of interest, D-lactic acid may also contribute to the metabolic acidosis produced by propylene glycol toxicity [\(5](#page-12-4)).
- 2. Another often unrecognized cause of a high anion gap metabolic acidosis is 5-oxoproline (also known as pyroglutamic acid), which is associated with chronic ingestion of acetaminophen (10). 5-oxoproline is involved in glutathione synthesis, but why it accumulates in some cases of chronic acetaminophen ingestion is unclear. Serum levels of acetaminophen are usually in the therapeutic range (10). Although this condition is considered rare, the actual incidence is unknown because 5-oxoproline levels are not routinely available.

**NORMAL ANION GAP:** In the ICU, most cases of normal AG metabolic acidosis are the result of isotonic saline infusions (see Chapter 10), diarrhea, or early renal insufficiency (where there is a defect of bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal tubules). This type of acidosis is characterized by an increase in chloride concentration (to electrically balance the decrease in HCO<sup>3</sup> ); hence the term *hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis* is used for normal AG metabolic acidoses. (In high AG metabolic acidoses, the remaining anions from the dissociated acids balance the loss of HCO<sup>3</sup> , so there is no associated hyperchloremia.)

# **The Delta Gap**

The delta gap is the ratio of the increase in the anion gap to the decrease in plasma HCO<sup>3</sup> , and is described by the following equation:

AG Excess/HCO<sub>3</sub> Deficit = 
$$(AG - 12)/(24 - HCO_3)$$
 (31.16)

where 12 is the normal anion gap (in mEq/L) and 24 is the normal plasma HCO<sup>3</sup> (in mEq/L). This ratio is sometimes called the *gap-gap* because it involves two gaps (the AG excess and the HCO<sup>3</sup> deficit). The delta gap can be useful in identifying mixed acid-base disorders (11), as

described next.

### *Mixed Metabolic Acidoses*

In metabolic acidoses caused by non-volatile acids (high AG metabolic acidosis), the increase in the anion gap should be equivalent to the decrease in plasma HCO<sup>3</sup> : i.e., the delta gap should be 1.0. (In the real world, differences in distribution and clearance rate create slightly different delta gaps for different acids). However, if there is a second source of acidosis that is a normal AG (hyperchloremic) acidosis, the decrease in HCO<sup>3</sup> is greater than the increase in AG, and the delta gap ratio falls below 1.0. Therefore, *in the presence of a high AG metabolic acidosis, a delta gap <1 indicates the co-existence of a normal AG (hyperchloremic) metabolic acidosis* (12).

**DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS:** Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a high AG metabolic acidosis with delta gap = 1. However, during the management of DKA, the aggressive infusion of isotonic saline creates a normal AG metabolic acidosis. In this situation, the serum bicarbonate decreases relative to the anion gap, resulting in a delta gap <1 (12). Therefore, monitoring the plasma HCO<sup>3</sup> alone will create a false impression that the DKA is not resolving, while the delta gap provides an accurate assessment of the changing acid-base status.

### *Metabolic Acidosis and Alkalosis*

When alkali is added in the presence of a high AG acidosis, the decrease in serum bicarbonate is less than the increase in AG, and the delta gap is >1. Therefore, *in the presence of a high AG metabolic acidosis, a delta-gap >1 indicates the co-existence of a metabolic alkalosis* ([4\)](#page-12-2). This is an important consideration because metabolic alkalosis is common in ICU patients (e.g., from the frequent use of diuretics).

# **Osmolal Gap**

The osmolality of plasma can be calculated using the concentrations of the major solutes in extracellular fluid (i.e., sodium, chloride, glucose, and urea): i.e.,

<span id="page-11-0"></span>Posm = 
$$2 \times [Na^+] + \frac{Glucose}{18} + \frac{BUN}{2.8}$$
 (31.17)

where Posm is the plasma osmolality in mosm/kg H2O, [Na+] is the plasma sodium concentration in mEq/L, glucose and BUN are the glucose and urea concentrations in plasma in mg/dL, and the factors 18 and 2.8 are the molecular weights of glucose and urea divided by 10, respectively, to express their concentrations in mosm/kg H2O. The [Na+] is doubled to include the osmotic activity of chloride.

Using normal plasma concentrations of Na+ (140 mEq/L), glucose (90 mg/dL), and BUN (14 mg/dL), in [Equation](#page-11-0) 31.17 yields a calculated plasma osmolality of 290 mosm/kg H2O. The plasma osmolality can also be measured, and the difference between the measured and calculated plasma osmolality is normally <10 mosm/kg H2O (13). This difference is known as the *osmolal gap*.

### *Detecting Hidden Solutes*

When a solute other than those in [Equation](#page-11-0) 31.17 is added to the extracellular fluid, the measured plasma osmolality will increase, while the calculated osmolality will be unaffected; i.e., the osmolal gap will increase. Thus, an increased osmolal gap can be used to detect an occult toxin (14), and in cases of high AG metabolic acidosis where the common offenders (lactic acid, ketoacids) are not responsible, an elevated osmolal gap can indicate the presence of an occult, unmeasured acid (e.g., D-lactic acid, oxalic acid, formic acid, salicylates, pyroglutamic acid).

# **A FINAL WORD**

### **Distrusting the Simplicity**

For more than 100 years, the evaluation of acid-base balance has been based on a single reaction sequence (shown below), and a single determinant of the plasma pH (i.e., the PaCO<sup>2</sup> /HCO<sup>3</sup> ratio).

$$CO_2 + H_2O \Leftrightarrow H_2CO_3 \Leftrightarrow H^+ + HCO_3$$
 (31.18)

This approach is appealing because of its simplicity, but as Lord Whitehead advises in the introductory quote, simplification can have drawbacks. The following are some major drawbacks with the traditional acid-base paradigm.

- 1. The use of the PaCO<sup>2</sup> -HCO<sup>3</sup> relationship to identify acid-base disorders is flawed because the CO<sup>2</sup> in plasma is present primarily as HCO<sup>3</sup> , so it is difficult to establish an independent identity for HCO<sup>3</sup> .
- 2. Bicarbonate does not act as a buffer in the physiological pH range (which is demonstrated in the next chapter). In fact, the plasma [H+] is a function of the anionic charge equivalence of the plasma proteins, and is not directly related to the plasma HCO<sup>3</sup> (15,16).

There is an alternative (and more valid) physicochemical view of acid-base balance, which was introduced by Peter Stewart (a Canadian physiologist), and the bibliography includes a textbook and original paper by Stewart for any who are interested (15,16).
