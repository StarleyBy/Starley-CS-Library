# **Metabolic Alkalosis**

*The first step in the scientific method consists in being curious about the world.*

Linus Pauling (*[a](#page-9-0)*)

Although the spotlight usually falls on metabolic acidosis, the most common acid-base disturbance in hospitalized patients is metabolic *alkalosis* ([1\)](#page-9-1). The prevalence of metabolic alkalosis can be attributed to three factors: (a) common predisposing conditions, (b) the ability of alkalosis to sustain itself, and (c) the tendency for the condition to go unnoticed and untreated.

This chapter begins with an attempt to simplify the rather complex electrolyte involvement in metabolic alkalosis, and then describes an organized approach to the evaluation and management of metabolic alkalosis. Some comprehensive reviews of the topic are included in the bibliography at the end of the chapter ([2,](#page-9-2)[3\)](#page-9-3).

## **PATHOGENESIS**

Metabolic alkalosis is defined as an increase in the bicarbonate (HCO<sup>3</sup> ) concentration in venous blood to >30 mEq/L [\(2](#page-9-2)). The generation and maintenance of this condition involves several factors, including the state of the extracellular volume, the activity of aldosterone, the function of the kidneys, and the plasma chloride and potassium concentrations. Each of these factors is explained briefly in this section.

## **Bicarbonate Homeostasis**

Under normal. steady state conditions, the concentration of bicarbonate in extracellular fluid is kept constant by the actions of the kidneys.

## *Bicarbonate Reabsorption*

About 4,000–4,500 mEq of bicarbonate (HCO<sup>3</sup> ) is filtered daily in the kidneys ([2\)](#page-9-2), and all of it is reclaimed by the renal tubules. Most (85–90%) of the filtered HCO<sup>3</sup> is reabsorbed in the proximal tubules, which is also the major site for sodium reabsorption. The remaining 10–15%

<span id="page-1-0"></span>of the filtered HCO<sup>3</sup> is reabsorbed by specialized cells in the collecting ducts, and the mechanism for this is shown in the middle cell in [Figure](#page-1-0) 33.1. (Note that chloride moves out of the blood in exchange for HCO<sup>3</sup> .) These cells also secrete H+ into the tubular lumen, which is then excreted as ammonium.

### *Bicarbonate Secretion*

There are other specialized cells in the collecting ducts that are involved in HCO<sup>3</sup> secretion via a chloride-bicarbonate exchange protein (called *pendrin*) that is on the luminal surface of the cells (see the lower cell in [Figure](#page-1-0) 33.1). This process is only minimally active under normal conditions, but the pendrin gene is up-regulated in metabolic alkalosis, to help clear the excess HCO<sup>3</sup> ([4\)](#page-9-4).

## **Conditions That Promote Metabolic Alkalosis**

Several conditions promote the production and maintenance of metabolic alkalosis, as briefly summarized here.

## *Loss of Gastric Acid*

Gastric secretions are rich in hydrogen ions (50–100 mEq/L), chloride (120–160 mEq/L), and to a lesser degree, potassium (10–15 mEq/L) ([5\)](#page-9-5). Loss of H+ in gastric secretions generates an equimolar addition of HCO<sup>3</sup> to the extracellular fluid, which creates a metabolic alkalosis. Loss of chloride and potassium will help to sustain the alkalosis, by mechanisms described later.

## *Hypovolemia*

Many causes of metabolic alkalosis are associated with a decrease in extracellular (plasma) volume. This condition promotes metabolic alkalosis in two ways. First, there is a decrease in glomerular filtration rate, which results in a decrease in filtered HCO<sup>3</sup> . Secondly, the decrease in renal perfusion stimulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and the aldosterone promotes metabolic alkalosis by mechanisms described next. (*Note:* The metabolic alkalosis associated with hypovolemia is often called "contraction alkalosis", but this is a misnomer because it implies that the problem is a decrease in free water rather than an excess of HCO<sup>3</sup> .)

### *Aldosterone*

Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid produced in the adrenal cortex that stimulates a sodiumpotassium exchange pump in the renal collecting ducts (depicted by the uppermost cell in Figure 33.1) to promote Na+ [reabsorption](#page-1-0) and K+ secretion. This can lead to K+ depletion, which promotes metabolic alkalosis by mechanisms described later. Aldosterone also stimulates the membrane ATPase pump responsible for H+ secretion into the renal tubules (see the middle cell in [Figure](#page-1-0) 33.1) ([6\)](#page-9-6).

## *Chloride Depletion*

Chloride depletion plays a major role in promoting metabolic alkalosis by increasing HCO<sup>3</sup> reabsorption and inhibiting HCO<sup>3</sup> secretion in the renal collecting ducts [\(2](#page-9-2)[,3](#page-9-3)). Both effects are mediated by a decrease in luminal chloride concentration. The inhibition of HCO<sup>3</sup> secretion is due to inhibition of the anion exchange protein, pendrin, which is the principal mechanism for the ability of chloride depletion to promote metabolic alkalosis ([7\)](#page-9-7).

### *Hypokalemia*

Hypokalemia promotes metabolic alkalosis via a transcellular shift of H+ into cells (in exchange for a shift of K+ out of cells). The resulting decrease in intracellular pH in renal tubular cells also promotes HCO<sup>3</sup> reabsorption [\(8](#page-9-8)).

#### *Diuretics*

Thiazide diuretics and "loop" diuretics like furosemide promote metabolic alkalosis via chloride

and K+ depletion. The principal action of these diuretics is to increase sodium loss in the urine, and urinary chloride excretion usually matches sodium excretion, so this can lead to chloride depletion The increased Na+ delivery to the distal tubules also promotes K+ loss via a Na+–K+ exchange pump (see the cell at the top in [Figure](#page-1-0) 33.1).

## **CLINICAL CONSEQUENCES**

Metabolic alkalosis is clinically silent in most patients. Severe alkalosis can be accompanied by neurologic manifestations and hypoventilation, but these are rarely life-threatening. In one remarkable case report, an elderly patient with protracted vomiting and a plasma [HCO<sup>3</sup> ] of 151 mEq/L was hemodynamically stable, and recovered uneventfully after volume and electrolyte replacement ([9\)](#page-9-9).

## **Neurologic Manifestations**

The neurologic manifestations attributed to alkalosis include depressed consciousness, generalized seizures, paresthesias, and carpopedal spasms, but these are usually associated with *respiratory alkalosis*, not metabolic alkalosis.

## **Hypoventilation**

The ventilatory response to metabolic alkalosis is hypoventilation, with a subsequent rise in arterial PCO<sup>2</sup> . However, this is not a vigorous response, and a considerable rise in plasma HCO<sup>3</sup> may be necessary to produce significant CO<sup>2</sup> retention ([10\)](#page-9-10).

The ventilatory response to metabolic alkalosis is described by the following equation ([11\)](#page-9-11):

$$\Delta \text{ PaCO}_2 = 0.7 \times \Delta \text{ HCO}_3 \tag{33.1}$$

where PaCO<sup>2</sup> is the arterial PCO<sup>2</sup> and HCO<sup>3</sup> is the plasma (usually venous) HCO<sup>3</sup> concentration. This equation was used to construct the curve in [Figure](#page-5-0) 33.2 showing the relationship between PaCO<sup>2</sup> and plasma HCO<sup>3</sup> in progressive metabolic alkalosis. Note that hypercapnia (i.e., PaCO<sup>2</sup> > 46 mm Hg) does not occur until the plasma HCO<sup>3</sup> increases almost 10 mEq/L (which represents a 40% increase in plasma HCO<sup>3</sup> ) and that worrisome hypercapnia (i.e., PaCO<sup>2</sup> > 50 mm Hg) does not occur until the metabolic alkalosis is severe.

**FIGURE 33.2** The relationship between plasma bicarbonate (HCO<sup>3</sup> ) and arterial PCO<sup>2</sup> (PaCO<sup>2</sup> ) in metabolic alkalosis, as predicted by the equation shown at the top of the graph. Note that the plasma HCO<sup>3</sup> must increase almost 10 mEq/L to produce hypercapnia (PaCO<sup>2</sup> > 46 mm Hg), and that worrisome hypercapnia (i.e., PaCO<sup>2</sup> > 50 mm Hg) does not occur until the alkalosis is severe.

## **Oxyhemoglobin Dissociation Curve**

Alkalosis shifts the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve to the left (Bohr effect), which results in a decreased tendency for hemoglobin to release oxygen into the tissues. When the O<sup>2</sup> extraction from capillary blood is constant, a leftward shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve results in a decrease in venous PO<sup>2</sup> ([12\)](#page-9-12), which typically indicates a decrease in tissue PO<sup>2</sup> . However, there is no evidence of inadequate tissue oxygenation from this effect.

## **EVALUATION**

The conditions that promote metabolic alkalosis can be organized according to the state of the extracellular volume, and the urinary chloride concentration, as shown in [Table](#page-5-1) 33.1 [\(2](#page-9-2)[,3](#page-9-3)).

<span id="page-5-1"></span>

| TABLE<br>33.1        | Principal<br>Sources<br>of<br>Metabolic<br>Alkalosis |                      |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Extracellular Volume | Urine Chloride                                       | Conditions           |
| Low                  | <20 mEq/L                                            | Vomiting, NG Suction |

## **Low ECV, Low Urine CL**

Metabolic alkalosis associated with a low extracellular volume (ECV) and a low urinary chloride concentration (<20 mEq/L) is also called *chloride-sensitive metabolic alkalosis* [\(2](#page-9-2)[,3](#page-9-3)). This is the usual type of metabolic alkalosis in ICU patients, and can be the result of gastric acid loss (from vomiting or nasogastric suction), secondary hyperaldosteronism (from hypovolemia), or excessive use of thiazide or loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide). The diuretic effect must be dissipated for the urine chloride to be low.

### *Laxative Abuse*

Diarrhea usually produces a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis from bicarbonate losses in stool, but the diarrhea associated with chronic laxative abuse is rich in potassium and chloride (70–90 mEq/L), and typically results in a metabolic alkalosis with a low ECV and a low urinary chloride ([13\)](#page-9-13). The diagnosis can be elusive, because patients often deny laxative abuse.

## **High ECV, High Urine CL**

Metabolic alkalosis associated with an increased ECV and a high urinary chloride concentration (>20 mEq/L) is also called *chloride-resistant metabolic alkalosis*, and the principal cause is primary hyperaldosteronism. This is an unlikely cause of metabolic alkalosis in the ICU, and is typically the result of aldosterone-producing adrenal adenomas or idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia (14). Analogous conditions include chronic ingestion of licorice, and exogenous mineralocorticoid excess ([2,](#page-9-2)[3\)](#page-9-3).

## **Other Causes**

Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia can cause a metabolic alkalosis in which the extracellular volume status and urinary chloride concentration are variable [\(3](#page-9-3),15).

## **MANAGEMENT**

The management of metabolic alkalosis with a low ECV and a low urinary chloride (i.e., chloride-responsive metabolic alkalosis) involves replenishment of chloride and potassium with isotonic saline and potassium chloride.

## **Isotonic Saline**

The volume of isotonic saline needed to correct a metabolic alkalosis can be estimated by first

estimating the chloride (CL–) deficit, as shown below (16,17):

$$CL^-$$
 deficit (mEq) = 0.2 × wt (kg) × (100 – plasma  $CL^-$ ) (33.2)

where wt is lean body weight in kg, and 100 is the desired plasma chloride concentration (in mEq/L). The required volume of isotonic saline (in liters) is then estimated as follows:

Volume of isotonic saline (L) = 
$$CL$$
- deficit/154 (33.3)

where 154 is the chloride concentration (in mEq/L) in isotonic saline. This method is summarized in [Table](#page-7-0) 33.2. Rapid saline infusion is not necessary, and a rate of 100 mL/hr above hourly fluid losses is appropriate.

**EXAMPLE:** A 70 kg adult with protracted vomiting has a metabolic alkalosis with a plasma chloride of 80 mEq/L. The chloride deficit in this case is 0.2 × 70 × (100–80) = 280 mEq. The volume of isotonic saline needed to correct this deficit is 280/154 = 1.8 liters.

<span id="page-7-0"></span>![](_page_7_Figure_6.jpeg)

## **Potassium Chloride**

Potassium replacement with KCL may be needed in addition to saline infusions. However it important to emphasize that *diuretic-induced hypokalemia can be resistant to potassium replacement if there is concurrent magnesium depletion* (18). Since magnesium depletion is also common during diuretic therapy, the plasma magnesium level should be checked before starting K+ replacement in patients receiving diuretics. (The evaluation and management of magnesium depletion is described in Chapter 37.)

### **Edematous States**

Patients with edema from heart failure, cirrhosis, or cor pulmonale can have a metabolic

alkalosis from diuretic therapy. In these cases, saline infusion is counterproductive, and K+ replacement is used to correct the alkalosis. These patients can also benefit from acetazolamide, as described next.

### *Acetazolamide*

Acetazolamide (Diamox) is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that inhibits HCO<sup>3</sup> reabsorption in the proximal tubules. The increase in HCO<sup>3</sup> excretion is accompanied by an increase in Na<sup>+</sup> excretion (as NaHCO<sup>3</sup> ), so acetazolamide also acts as a diuretic, which is advantageous in edematous states associated with a metabolic alkalosis. The recommended dose is 250 to 375 mg IV or PO, once or twice daily (19).

## *Hydrochloric Acid Infusion*

Severe metabolic alkalosis that is not corrected with K+ replacement and acetazolamide can be treated with an infusion of dilute hydrochloric acid, but this can be risky, and is reserved only for patients with severe alkalosis (plasma HCO<sup>3</sup> > 50 mEq/L or pH > 7.55).

**METHOD:** The dose of HCL is determined by estimating the H+ deficit with the equation below (see also [Table](#page-8-0) 33.3) (19).

$$H^+$$
 Deficit (mEq) =  $0.5 \times \text{wt (kg)} \times \text{(plasma HCO}_3 - 24)$  (33.4)

where wt is the lean body weight in kg, and 24 is the normal plasma HCO<sup>3</sup> .

<span id="page-8-0"></span>![](_page_8_Figure_8.jpeg)

The HCL solution is prepared by adding 100 mL of 1 normal (1N) HCL to 900 mL of isotonic saline or sterile water, which makes a 0.1N HCL solution (100 mEq H+/L) The volume of 0.1N HCL (in liters) needed to correct the H+ deficit is determined by the ratio (H+ deficit/100), as shown in [Table](#page-8-0) 33.3. Because HCL solutions are corrosive, they *should be infused through a large, central vein* (20), and *the infusion rate should not exceed 0.2 mEq/kg/hr*

(17). The entire H+ deficit does not have to be replaced; i.e., the HCL infusion can be stopped when the plasma pH falls to acceptable levels (e.g., <7.5).

**ADVERSE EFFECTS:** The major concern with HCL infusions is the corrosive effect on blood vessels. Extravasation of HCL solutions can produce severe tissue necrosis, even when the solution is infused through a central vein (21).

## **A FINAL WORD**

## **Spotlight on Chloride**

Chloride is the second most abundant electrolyte in the extracellular fluid, and has emerged as a major factor in metabolic acid-base disorders, including both metabolic alkalosis (via chloride depletion) and metabolic acidosis (i.e., hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis). It also plays a major role in determining the extracellular volume (which is described in Chapter 35).

In recognition of its importance in acid-base balance and volume regulation, chloride has been given the title "queen of electrolytes" (22), emphasizing that chloride is much more than an inconsequential partner for sodium in the extracellular fluid.
