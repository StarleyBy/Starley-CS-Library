# **Abdominal Infections in the ICU**

*My dear Watson, you see, but you do not observe.*

Arthur Conan Doyle (*[a](#page-10-0)*)

The concept of the bowel as noxious reservoir first appeared in the early years of the twentieth century, when a Scottish surgeon named William Arbuthnot-Lane began performing total colectomies in patients with chronic constipation, to prevent "autointoxication" from toxic bowel contents ([1\)](#page-10-1). This practice was eventually abandoned (along with the surgeon), but the concept of autointoxication has been revived, as the bowel is now recognized as a leading source of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients.

This chapter describes abdominal infections that are related to the ICU stay, including infections of the gallbladder (acalculous cholecystitis), the bowel (*Clostridium diffcile* enterocolitis), and the peritoneal cavity (e.g., postoperative infections).

# **ACALCULOUS CHOLECYSTITIS**

Acalculous cholecystitis (i.e., inflammation of the gallbladder without cystic duct obstruction by gallstones) is an uncommon form of acute cholecystitis that typically occurs in critically ill patients, and is more severe than its "calculous" counterpart (2,3).

## **Pathogenesis**

Predisposing conditions include stroke, sepsis, circulatory shock, prolonged periods of bowel rest (i.e., during total parenteral nutrition), and the postoperative period (especially following cardiopulmonary bypass surgery) (3–6). Possible mechanisms include hypoperfusion, decreased gallbladder contractions (which allows the buildup of gallbladder "sludge"), relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi (which allows enteric pathogens to enter the biliary tree), and a change in the composition of bile. The latter mechanism is based on the observation that biliary sludge contains small crystals called "microliths" that can promote cholecystitis (7).

#### **Clinical Features**

The clinical presentation can be nonspecific, as fever, hypotension, and multiorgan failure are

common but nonspecific findings, while *pain and tenderness in the right upper quadrant can be absent in one-third of patients* (8). Blood cultures are positive in 90% of cases (8) and gramnegative aerobic bacilli are isolated in almost all cases.

### **Diagnosis**

Ultrasound is favored as the initial diagnostic test for acalculous cholecystitis, but the diagnostic yield can be limited. Gallbladder distension and sludge are suggestive findings, but are nonspecific. Advanced disease may yield more specific findings, such as the ultrasound image in [Figure](#page-1-0) 41.1, which shows sloughed mucosa in the lumen of the gallbladder that is characteristic of gangrenous cholecystitis.

The diagnostic yield from ultrasound varies widely in different reports; the pooled results from 26 studies show a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 83% (9). If ultrasound is not diagnostic, *the gold standard test for acalculous cholecystitis is the hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan* (2), but this requires a functional liver to move the tracer into the bile ducts. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the same diagnostic yield as abdominal ultrasound, and the accuracy of computed tomography is poor (2).

| Tigecycline                 | Vancomycin                  |  |  |  |  |

#### **Management**

Prompt intervention is mandatory, as this condition can deteriorate rapidly. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice (2), but for patients who are too unstable for surgery, percutaneous drainage of the gallbladder is a suitable alternative.

Empiric antibiotic therapy should be started as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed, and coverage should include gram-negative enteric organisms. [Table](#page-2-0) 41.1 shows the penetration of different antibiotics into bile.

# **CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE**

As described in Chapter 4, the normal microbial environment in the GI tract, known as the *microbiome*, has an important role in preventing colonization by undesirable pathogens (10). Disruption of the microbiome, which is known as *dysbiosis*, can lead to a variety of infections (both localized and disseminated), and the most prominent of these infections is *Clostridium difficile* enterocolitis, which *is considered the most common healthcare-associated infection* (11). (*Note: Clostridium difficile* has been renamed *Clostridioides difficile*, but the original name will be used here.)

## **Pathogenesis**

*Clostridium difficile* is a spore-forming gram-positive anaerobic bacillus that is an uncommon inhabitant of the bowel in healthy subjects, but is able to proliferate in the bowel when the normal microbial population has been altered. The major risk factors for *C. difficile* colonization are advanced age, contact with a healthcare facility, and antibiotic therapy (12,13). The organism is occasionally found in poultry, fish, and red meat (14), but the major route of transmission is the fecal-oral route.

*C. difficile* is not an invasive organism, but releases cytotoxins (Toxins A and B) that damage the bowel mucosa. This leads to inflammatory infiltration of the bowel wall and symptomatic disease. Severe inflammation is accompanied by raised, plaque-like lesions on the mucosal surface known as 'pseudomembranes'. The presence of these lesions (*pseudomembranous colitis*) is evidence of severe disease.

The enterocolitis from *C. difficile* is primarily a nosocomial infection (i.e., appears after 48 hours of the hospital stay), and the organism is transmitted from patient-to-patient via the hands of hospital personnel. However, there has been a drastic rise in community-acquired *C. difficile* infections in recent years, and they now account for 34–48% of all cases (11).

#### *Gastric Acid Suppression*

There are several reports showing that use of acid-suppressing drugs, particularly proton pump inhibitors, is associated with an increased risk of *C. difficile* infection (15–17). This is consistent with the role of gastric acidity as an antibacterial defense mechanism, which is described in Chapter 4 (see Figure 4.3). The protective effect of gastric acid on *C. difficile* infections has important implications for the escalating and excessive use of gastric acid-suppressing drugs, particularly proton pump inhibitors, for stress ulcer prophylaxis in hospitalized patients. (This topic is revisited in the very last section of the chapter.)

### **Clinical Features**

The principal manifestation of *Clostridium difficile* infection (CDI) is a watery diarrhea, which can be accompanied by a low-grade fever (≤101° F) and mild leukocytosis (WBC count <15,000/mm3). Fulminant CDI occurs in 3–5% of cases (18), and is characterized by hypotension and abdominal distension from ileus, or from the most feared complication of CDI, toxic megacolon. The latter condition, which is shown in [Figure](#page-3-0) 41.2, is a surgical emergency.

<span id="page-3-0"></span>![](_page_3_Picture_4.jpeg)

**FIGURE 41.2** Radiographic appearance of toxic megacolon in a patient with *C. difficile* enterocolitis.

#### *Diagnostic Evaluation*

The following laboratory tests (on stool samples) are used for the diagnostic evaluation of CDI.

- 1. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that detects the gene for Toxin B. A positive test confirms the presence of toxigenic *C. difficile*, but does not differentiate colonization from infection.
- 2. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that detects toxins A and B. A positive test confirms the diagnosis of CDI.

The flow diagram in [Figure](#page-4-0) 41.3 shows how these tests are used in a case of suspected CDI. The PCR is highly sensitive, and is used as an initial screening test. A negative PCR eliminates the diagnosis of CDI (by eliminating the presence of toxigenic *C. difficile*). However, a positive PCR confirms colonization, but not infection, so an ELISA test for cytotoxins is warranted. A positive ELISA test confirms the diagnosis of CDI. However, the ELISA test has a low sensitivity, and can miss about 20% of cases of CDI (12), so a negative ELISA does not eliminate the possibility of CDI. Nevertheless, most patients who are PCR-positive but toxinnegative do well without treatment for CDI (19).

<span id="page-4-0"></span>![](_page_4_Figure_5.jpeg)

**FIGURE 41.3** Flow diagram for the diagnostic evaluation of *C. difficile* infection. See text for explanation.

**CAVEAT:** There is a tendency to treat patients for CDI based on a positive PCR test only, but about half of patients who are PCR-positive do not have cytotoxins by immunoassay (19), and these patients do well without antibiotics (as just mentioned). Therefore, the treatment of CDI based on the PCR test alone should be discouraged, as it leads to the overdiagnosis of CDI, and the unnecessary use of antibiotics.

**COLONOSCOPY:** Direct visualization of the bowel mucosa is reserved for the occasional case where there is a high clinical suspicion of CDI that is not confirmed by the cytotoxin assay. The presence of pseudomembranes confirms the diagnosis of CDI. Colonoscopy is preferred to proctosigmoidoscopy for optimal results.

#### **Treatment**

The recommended antibiotic regimens for CDI are shown in [Table](#page-5-0) 41.2 (13), and are summarized below.

- 1. The treatment of choice for routine cases of CDI is oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin in the doses shown in [Table](#page-5-0) 41.2. The fever resolves in 24 to 48 hrs, and the diarrhea resolves in 4 to 5 days (20), but treatment is continued for 10 days.
- 2. Fulminant cases of CDI should be treated with a combination of enteral vancomycin and IV metronidazole. If surgery is needed for toxic megacolon, subtotal colectomy is preferred (13).
- 3. Relapses (usually within 3 weeks) are reported in 25% of cases treated with vancomycin (21), and 13% of cases treated with fidaxomicin (22). If vancomycin was used initially, the first recurrence is treated with a 10-day course of fidaxomycin or an extended course of vancomycin, as shown in [Table](#page-5-0) 41.2.

From the clinical practice guidelines in Reference 13.

#### *Fecal Transplantation*

About 5% of patients with CDI have more than one relapse (20), and the most effective treatment for multiple relapses is "fecal microbiota transplantation", which is a fancy term for the instillation of liquid stool from healthy donors (via nasogastric tube, endoscopy, or enemas) to re-establish a normal microbial environment in the GI tract. The reported cure rate is a remarkable 80–100% for recurrent CDI (23).

#### **Preventive Measures**

Prophylactic measures are aimed at preventing transmission of the organism from patient to

patient, and preventing colonization of the organism in susceptible patients.

#### *Infection Control*

The guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends gloves and gowns for any contact with an infected patient, and handwashing before and after each patient contact (13). However, these measures are unlikely to eliminate spread of this disease, because asymptomatic carriers of *C. difficile* are important sources of transmitted disease (13).

#### *Probiotics*

Probiotics (i.e., non-pathogenic organisms that bind to epithelial cells and prevent the attachment of *C. difficile*) are widely used during and after treatment of CDI (24), but this is not recommended by the American College of Gastroenterology (12) because of inconclusive study results, and evidence that *probiotics can actually impede recolonization of the colon following antibiotic therapy* (25).

# **COMPLICATED INTRA-ABDOMINAL INFECTIONS**

Complicated intra-abdominal infections are defined as infections that involve the peritoneal cavity, and can be a generalized peritonitis or a localized abscess (26). They are often the result of a rupture or tear somewhere along the gastrointestinal tract, or an anastomotic leak following abdominal surgery. These infections can be difficult to treat, and they require prompt source control (i.e., closure of the bowel perforation) and appropriate empiric antibiotics.

#### **Bowel Perforation**

Perforations of the GI tract can arise from a wide variety of conditions, including trauma, peptic ulcer disease, bowel ischemia or obstruction, inflammatory or neoplastic disease, rupture of diverticuli, or unintentional laceration of the bowel during surgery. Abdominal pain is almost universal, and there may be signs of peritoneal irritation (guarding and rebound tenderness). Progression to circulatory shock can be rapid (26).

#### *Diagnosis*

The diagnosis of bowel perforation requires evidence of free air in the peritoneal cavity (pneumoperitoneum). The presence of free air under the diaphragm in an upright chest x-ray, as shown in [Figure](#page-7-0) 41.4, has a reported sensitivity of up to 85% for the detection of bowel perforations (27). CT scans are more sensitive than plain radiographs, and they can localize the site of the perforation in 85% of cases (28). Pneumoperitoneum is not a useful finding shortly after abdominal surgery, as it can persist for at least one week after the procedure (29).

#### *Management*

Immediate surgical exploration is typically the first priority for bowel perforations, but the perioperative management should include the following measures.

<span id="page-7-1"></span>**FLUIDS:** Soiling with bowel contents can be accompanied by considerable fluid loss into the peritoneal cavity, so signs of circulatory compromise (i.e., a decrease in urine output or blood pressure) should prompt appropriate volume resuscitation. Avoiding vasopressor therapy is optimal prior to surgery (if possible), because it promotes splanchnic vasoconstriction, which will aggravate an underlying ischemic condition in the bowel.

**ANTIBIOTICS:** Empiric antibiotic therapy should be started as soon as possible using antibiotics that are active against enteric pathogens. The coverage of selected antibiotics is shown in Table 41.3. This is used to make the following [recommendations,](#page-7-1) which are taken from recently published guidelines on intra-abdominal infections (26):

- 1. If no resistant organisms are suspected, *piperacillin-tazobactam* is suitable for single-agent empiric coverage (26). The combination of *ceftriaxone* and *metronidazole* is an alternative recommendation for patients that are not seriously ill, but the coverage is far inferior to piperacillin-tazobactam.
- 2. Organisms that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are resistant to penicillins and third-generation cephalosporins. If these organisms are suspected (e.g., from prior colonization or infection), the antibiotic options are *meropenem, tigecycline*, and *ceftazidime/avibactam*.
  - a. Meropenem provides the broadest coverage, and is the treatment of choice in patients with septic shock (26). However, there is a reason to limit its use because of rapidly developing resistance (30). Of note, meropenem is not active against methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA) or vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).
  - b. Tigecycline does not cover *Pseudomonas* species, but it is active against MRSA and VRE. It is not recommended in patients with septic shock (26).
  - c. Ceftazidime/avibactam is one of the newer group of beta-lactam antibiotics that contains a beta-lactamase inhibitor (avibactam). Ceftazidime provides coverage for *Pseudomonas*

species, but it is not active against enterococci or anaerobic organisms. The experience with this antibiotic combination is limited at present.

3. For patients that are allergic to beta-lactam antibiotics, the combination of amikacin and metronidazole provides suitable coverage.

**CANDIDA COVERAGE:** *Candida albicans* and related species can be prominent inhabitants of the bowel (especially in patients who have received antibiotics recently), and *perforation in the upper GI tract has been identified as a major risk factor for Candida peritonitis* (31). If this is a concern, empiric coverage should include an antifungal agent that covers all *Candida* species, such as one of the echinocandins (i.e., *micafungin, anidulafungin*, or *caspofungin*).

### **Postoperative Infections**

Postoperative peritonitis is the most common abdominal infection in ICU patients (32), and is usually the result of anastomotic leakage. The management is similar to that described for bowel perforations, with the following exceptions (32):

- 1. The empiric antibiotic regimen should include coverage for ESBL-producing organisms.
- 2. Empiric coverage for *Candida* species is recommended in unstable or critically ill patients.

These infections are problematic because there is often a delay in recognizing an anastomotic leak, which is partly due to the presence of peritoneal air for at least one week after abdominal surgery. Return to the operating room is often prompted by a deterioration in the patient's clinical condition, which increases the risk associated with the reoperation. There is some evidence that C-reactive protein levels can be used to predict the likelihood of an anastomotic leak (33), but this has not gained widespread acceptance.

#### *Abscess*

Postoperative abdominal abscesses are often an occult source of sepsis, and are difficult to uncover with routine clinical evaluations. Fever is almost always present, but localized abdominal tenderness can be absent in 60% of cases, and a palpable abdominal mass is evident in less than 10% of cases (34,35). Abdominal x-rays can show extraluminal air, but this occurs in less than 15% of cases (35).

**DIAGNOSIS:** Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen is the most reliable method of detecting abdominal abscesses. However, CT imaging in the early postoperative period can be misleading because collections of blood or irrigant solutions in the peritoneal cavity can be misread as an abscess. CT scans are most reliable when performed after the first postoperative week (when peritoneal fluid collections have resorbed) (35). The CT appearance of an abdominal abscess is shown in [Figure](#page-10-2) 41.5.

<span id="page-10-2"></span>![](_page_10_Picture_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 41.5** Abdominal CT scan showing a multiloculated abscess in the left upper quadrant in a post-splenectomy patient.

**MANAGEMENT:** Immediate drainage is advised for postoperative abdominal abscesses. CT-guided drainage is successful in 90–95% of cases (36), and surgery is rarely needed. The empiric antibiotic regimen is the same as described for postoperative peritonitis.

# **A FINAL WORD**

#### *C. difficile* **and Gastric Acid**

The role of gastric acid as an antibacterial defense against ingested microbes (which is described in Chapter 4) does not receive the attention it deserves. One example of this is the evidence that suppression of gastric acidity with proton pump inhibitors promotes the transmission of *Clostridium difficile* infections (15–17), which has hardly curbed the excessive use of proton pump inhibitors for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The following observation deserves mention:

There was a marked increase in the incidence of *C. difficile* infections in the first decade of the 21st century, at the same time that proton pump inhibitors gained widespread use for stress ulcer prophylaxis (37).

Is this serendipity, or a causal link? Whatever the answer, the antibacterial actions of gastric acidity are reason enough to curb the excessive use of gastric-acid suppressing drugs for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
