# **Acute Coronary Syndromes**

*The study of the causes of things must be preceded by the study of things caused.*

John Hughlings Jackson (1835–1911)

One of the seminal moments in cardiac critical care was the discovery (in 1980) that transmural myocardial infarction (MI) was the result of an occlusive thrombus in a coronary artery. This led to the introduction of thrombolytic therapy (in the mid-1980s), followed by the superseding technology of balloon angioplasty and stent placement. Advances in reperfusion therapy have improved outcomes, and have contributed to 20% decline in the annual mortality rate from coronary disease over the past decade (from 2010 to 2020) ([1\)](#page-15-0). However, coronary artery disease continues to be the leading cause of death in the United States ([1\)](#page-15-0), so there is more work to be done.

This chapter describes the diagnosis and early management of acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina (the *acute coronary syndromes*), with an emphasis on management in the first 24–36 hours after presentation. Also included is a section on acute aortic dissection, which has a clinical presentation that can be confused with acute coronary syndromes. Many of the recommendations in this chapter are derived from the clinical practice guidelines listed in the bibliography at the end of the chapter ([2–](#page-15-1)[7\)](#page-15-2).

# **CORONARY THROMBOSIS**

# **Pathogenesis**

As just mentioned, acute myocardial infarction is the result of an occlusive thrombus in one or more coronary arteries. The trigger for thrombus formation is rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque, which releases thrombogenic lipids (see [Figure](#page-1-0) 20.1). Plaque disruption is attributed to inflammation [\(8](#page-15-3)), but hydraulic shear stress may also play a role, because ruptured plaques are typically located at branch points in the coronary circulation [\(9](#page-15-4)).

### *Role of Oxidative Injury*

Inflammation plays a major role in both the genesis and rupture of atherosclerotic plaques ([10\)](#page-15-5). The damaging effects of inflammation are largely due to the oxidative actions of "reactive oxygen species", as described in Chapter 17 (see Figure 17.1), and this implicates oxidative injury as a major participant in coronary artery disease. The principle culprit in this scenario appears to be *myeloperoxidase* (MPO), an enzyme released by leukocytes that generates hypochlorite (the active ingredient in household bleach), and oxidizes lipoproteins in atherosclerotic plaques ([11\)](#page-15-6). Clinical studies have shown a direct correlation between plasma levels of MPO and the presence and severity of coronary artery disease [\(12](#page-15-7)[,13](#page-15-8)), and autopsy studies in humans have shown extensive staining for MPO at the rupture site of coronary artery plaques ([13\)](#page-15-8). These observations suggest that inhibition of MPO is a potential treatment modality for coronary artery disease.

# **Clinical Syndromes**

Acute coronary thrombosis produces three distinct clinical syndromes (which are the acute coronary syndromes, or ACS), which are classified by the presence or absence of ST-segment elevation on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG):

- 1. ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), which is a transmural infarction caused by complete occlusion of the infarct-related artery.
- 2. Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), which is the result of incomplete or partial occlusion of the infarct-related artery.
- 3. Unstable angina (UA), which is not associated with ST elevation on the ECG, and is the result of repetitive on-off episodes of coronary occlusion.

NSTEMI and UA are typically grouped together as "non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes", or NSTE-ACS.

#### *Diagnostic Evaluation*

The success of treating ACS is time-dependent, so the diagnostic evaluation must be completed as quickly as possible, The evaluation has three components: the clinical presentation, the 12 lead ECG, and the high-sensitivity troponin assay.

**CLINICAL PRESENTATION:** The clinical presentation of ACS can vary widely, but about 80% of patients have some type of chest discomfort (e.g., pain, pressure, tightness, etc.) ([3,](#page-15-9)[4\)](#page-15-10). The onset is abrupt, and lasts for longer than 15 minutes. The discomfort is a deep sensation that cannot be localized to a specific point, and can involve the shoulders, neck, arms, and abdomen. Patients are often apprehensive, and can complain of nausea, vomiting, and dyspnea.

ACS is unlikely when chest pain is sharp or fleeting, or can be localized to a precise point, and also if the pain occurs during inspiration, or can be elicited by body movements or chest percussion. Of particular note, *chest pain that is relieved by nitroglycerin is not evidence of myocardial ischemia, since nitroglycerin can also relieve chest pain from esophageal spasm* ([14\)](#page-15-11).

The initial evaluation may also reveal evidence of acute heart failure or cardiogenic shock. These complications are not considered in this chapter, but are described in detail in Chapters 16 and 18.

**ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:** A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) *should be obtained within 10 minutes of the first patient contact* [\(2](#page-15-1)). Some of the ECG changes in ACS are shown in [Table](#page-3-0) 20.1 ECG evidence of ST-elevation MI (STEMI) merits emergency reperfusion therapy (described later). NSTEMI and UA (NSTE-ACS) may be accompanied by ST depressions or T-wave inversions, but the ECG can also be normal in these conditions. Finally, ischemic changes in the ST segment can be masked by a bundle branch block or a paced rhythm, and when coronary ischemia is suspected, the presence of these ECG abnormalities is managed like a STEMI (i.e., with emergent reperfusion therapy).

**TROPONIN ASSAY:** Plasma levels of cardiac troponin (cTn) are used to detect the presence of myocardial cell injury, and a high-sensitivity assay (hs-cTn) can detect elevations of plasma cTn as early as 3 hours after the onset of symptoms [\(15](#page-15-12)). There are several commercial hs-cTn assays, and the normal or reference levels differ for each assay, and can differ for each hospital. The following protocol is recommended for hs-cTn levels [\(2](#page-15-1)[–6](#page-15-13)).

- 1. Plasma levels of hs-cTn are measured at the time of presentation, and again one hour later.
- 2. Myocardial necrosis is likely if the initial hs-cTn level is elevated (usually above the 99% upper reference level for the assay), and there has been at least 3 hours since the onset of symptoms. Conditions other than ischemia can cause myocardial injury, hence a repeat hs-cTn level at one hour is used to determine if the myocardial injury is ischemic in origin (see next).
- 3. A significant change (usually >10%) in the second hs-cTn level is evidence of acute ischemia (i.e., acute MI).

There are several non-ischemic causes of elevated hs-cTn levels (e.g., cardiomyopathy, sustained tachycardia, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and even sepsis) ([2,](#page-15-1)[3\)](#page-15-9) but these conditions should not cause an acute change in the hs-cTn levels. However, patients with markedly elevated hs-cTn levels are usually admitted to the hospital for further testing.

# **REPERFUSION STRATEGIES**

When the likelihood of an acute coronary occlusion is very high using the evaluation just described, the next step is to determine the appropriate strategy for restoring flow in the occluded artery. Three methods are available for coronary reperfusion:

- 1. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which involves coronary angiography (to identify the obstruction), balloon angioplasty (to restore patency), and placement of a stent (to prevent re-occlusion). This is the standard reperfusion method.
- 2. Thrombolytic drug therapy, which is a less effective alternative when PCI is not available.
- 3. Coronary artery bypass surgery, which is reserved for cases where PCI is not warranted, or is not successful.

### **Strategies**

The reperfusion strategies for ACS are based on the presence or absence of ST-elevation on the ECG, and the availability of PCI. The following recommendation are from the most recent clinical practice guidelines ([2,](#page-15-1)[3,](#page-15-9)[5–](#page-15-14)[7\)](#page-15-2).

### *ST-Elevation MI*

The management outlined below is for patients with ECG evidence of STEMI, and for cases where myocardial ischemia is likely and there is a bundle branch block on the ECG.

- 1. The optimal management is emergency PCI, performed within 90–120 minutes of hospital arrival (i.e., the "door-to-balloon" time) [\(2](#page-15-1)[,6](#page-15-13)).
- 2. If PCI is unavailable, patients should be transferred immediately to a PCI-capable hospital, with a target door-to-balloon time of 120 minutes. If the transfer time is expected to exceed 120 minutes, thrombolytic therapy can be given prior to the transfer, and should be initiated within 30 minutes of hospital arrival (i.e., the "door-to-needle" time) [\(6](#page-15-13)).
- 3. Coronary artery bypass surgery is reserved for cases where PCI fails to establish reperfusion and there is ongoing ischemia.

**DOOR-TO-BALLOON TIME:** The negative impact of delays in performing balloon angioplasty is shown in [Figure](#page-5-0) 20.2 ([16\)](#page-15-15). Note that the mortality rate is significantly increased when the time from hospital arrival to coronary angioplasty (the "door-to-balloon" time) exceeded 120 minutes. The American Heart Association recommends 90 minutes as the target door-to-balloon time [\(6](#page-15-13)), which allows a 30-minute buffer period.

**INTERHOSPITAL TRANSFERS:** Less than 30% of hospitals in the United States are equipped to perform PCI [\(17](#page-15-16)), and about one of every four patients with a STEMI is brought to a non-PCI hospital ([18\)](#page-15-17). When this occurs, transfer to a PCI-capable hospital can provide a survival benefit if the total door-to-balloon time does not exceed 120 minutes (19). When long delays are anticipated, thrombolytic therapy can be used as a bridge to PCI [\(2](#page-15-1)[,6](#page-15-13)).

**FIGURE 20.2** Mortality rate in relation to the time from hospital arrival to coronary angioplasty in patients with STEMI. Asterisks indicate a significant difference compared to the initial time period (0–60 min). Adapted from data in Reference 16.

#### *Non-ST-Elevation ACS*

- 1. Urgent (as soon as possible) PCI is advised for cases of non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI) that are complicated by hemodynamic instability, cardiogenic shock, acute heart failure, or persistent chest pain [\(2](#page-15-1)[,5](#page-15-14)). Otherwise, PCI can be performed 24–72 hours after presentation ([5\)](#page-15-14).
- 2. Thrombolytic therapy has no survival benefit in NSTEMI, and is not used as an alternative to PCI.
- 3. Patients with unstable angina who are hemodynamically stable and devoid of pain may not require PCI during hospitalization.

# **Thrombolytic Therapy**

Thrombolytic therapy is less effective than PCI (19), and is limited to uncomplicated cases of STEMI where PCI is not immediately available. The following are additional limiting factors for thrombolytic therapy.

- 1. The survival benefit of thrombolytic therapy is time-dependent; i.e., it is greatest in the first few hours after symptom onset, and then gradually declines and is lost after 12 hours (20). This is demonstrated in [Figure](#page-6-0) 20.3, and is the basis for the recommendation that *thrombolytic therapy is not advised if more than 12 hours have elapsed from symptom onset* [\(6](#page-15-13)).
- 2. In addition to time constraints, the use of thrombolytic therapy is limited by the risk of bleeding. Absolute and relative contraindications to thrombolytic therapy are presented in Chapter 47.

### *Thrombolytic Agents*

Thrombolytic agents act by converting plasminogen to plasmin, which then breaks fibrin strands into smaller subunits. The [thrombolytic](#page-6-1) agents approved for clinical use, are shown in Table 20.2. These agents act on the plasminogen that is bound to fibrin strands in the blood clot, and this limits the extent of systemic fibrinolysis, and reduces the risk of troublesome bleeding. The lytic agents in [Table](#page-6-1) 20.2 are equally capable of restoring patency in occluding coronary arteries ([6\)](#page-15-13).

**FIGURE 20.3** The survival benefit of thrombolytic therapy in relation to the time elapsed from the onset of chest pain. Data from 45,000 patients with STEMI or left bundle branch block in Reference 20.

- 1. *Alteplase* (Activase) is a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) that was the first clotspecific fibrinolytic agent approved for clinical use. However, it is no longer favored because it is relatively slow-acting (21), and requires 90 minutes to complete the dosing regimen.
- 2. *Reteplase* (Retavase) is a recombinant variant of tPA that is given as two bolus doses over a 30-minute period. It produces more rapid clot lysis than alteplase (21), but clinical trials show no survival advantage (22).
- 3. *Tenecteplase* (TNK-tPA) is another variant of tPA that is given as a single IV bolus, and produces more rapid clot lysis than reteplase (23). It is currently the most popular thrombolytic agent, but has no proven survival advantage (24).

#### *Major Bleeding*

Thrombolytic therapy for ACS is complicated by significant bleeding (i.e., requires blood transfusions) in about 10% of cases, and life-threatening bleeding (shock or intracranial hemorrhage) occurs in about 1% of cases (25). The bleeding is associated with low plasma fibrinogen levels (usually <100 mg/dL) and can be treated with concentrated fibrinogen products such as cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen concentrates (see the last section of Chapter 13). The use of antifibrinolytic agents such as tranexamic acid is discouraged because of the risk of thrombosis (26).

# **CARDIOPROTECTIVE MEASURES**

The following measures are aimed at improving the balance between myocardial O<sup>2</sup> supply and O<sup>2</sup> demand, and are initiated when myocardial ischemia is first suspected (sometimes in the prehospital setting). These measures are summarized in [Table](#page-7-0) 20.3.

# **Oxygen**

Despite a long history of routine use in ACS, supplemental O<sup>2</sup> provides no benefit in patients with ACS who have a normal arterial O<sup>2</sup> saturation (i.e., SaO<sup>2</sup> ≥90%) (27). As a result, the current recommendation is to *use supplemental oxygen only in patients who are hypoxemic; i.e., have an SaO<sup>2</sup> <90%* ([2,](#page-15-1)[5,](#page-15-14)[6\)](#page-15-13). More compelling reasons to avoid the unnecessary use of oxygen in ACS are as follows:

- 1. Oxygen promotes vasoconstriction in the coronary arteries, and can decrease coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease (28).
- 2. Reactive oxygen species are implicated in the myocardial injury that follows coronary reperfusion (29).

(For more on the dark side of oxygen, see Chapter 25.)

### **Relieving Chest Pain**

Relieving chest pain helps to alleviate unwanted cardiac stimulation from anxiety-induced adrenergic hyperactivity.

#### *Nitroglycerin*

Nitroglycerin is given as a sublingual tablet or aerosol spray to relieve chest pain, and a total of 3 doses can be given in 5-minute intervals if necessary. (The mechanism of pain relief with nitroglycerin is unclear; i.e., it is often attributed to its vasodilator effects, but other vasodilators do not relieve ischemic chest pain.) If the pain recurs, a nitroglycerin infusion can be started using the dosing regimen in [Table](#page-6-1) 20.2. Nitroglycerin infusions can also benefit cases of ACS that are accompanied by hypertension or decompensated heart failure.

**CONCERNS:** Nitroglycerin is not advised in patients with right ventricular infarction (because the venodilator effects of nitroglycerin can be counterproductive in this condition), severe aortic stenosis, or in patients who have received a phosphodiesterase inhibitor for erectile dysfunction within the past 24–48 hours (because of the risk of hypotension) ([2,](#page-15-1)[5,](#page-15-14)[6\)](#page-15-13). (Complications of nitroglycerin infusions are described in Chapter 18.)

### *Morphine*

Morphine is the drug of choice for chest pain that is refractory to nitroglycerin. Morphine also has a sedating effect, but the addition of a benzodiazepine (e.g., midazolam, 0.01 mg/kg IV) is sometimes needed to relieve anxiety.

**CONCERNS:** The complications of opioids are described in Chapter 6. Morphine (and fentanyl) can also impair the antiplatelet effects of the P2Y12 inhibitors used in ACS (see later), but the clinical significance of this effect is unproven [\(2](#page-15-1)).

# **β-Receptor Antagonists**

β-blockers have several actions that reduce myocardial O<sup>2</sup> demand, and are usually started in the first 24 hours after diagnosis of ACS. The agent most often studied in ACS is *metoprolol*, and the dosing recommendations are shown in [Table](#page-7-0) 20.3. Intravenous metoprolol can be useful in patients with troublesome tachycardia or hypertension, or prior to PCI in patients with STEMI (30).

#### *When to Avoid*

Traditional contraindications to β-blockers include bradycardia, hypotension, and high-degree

AV block. Other caveats for ACS are as follows:

- 1. Early treatment with β-blockers is not advised in ACS associated with acute heart failure ([2,](#page-15-1)[5,](#page-15-14)[6\)](#page-15-13), but after the condition is stabilized, β-blockers are recommended for long-term therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (see Table 18.5).
- 2. When the systolic BP is <120 mm Hg, β-blockers increase the risk of cardiogenic shock (31).
- 3. β-blockers are contraindicated in cocaine-induced myocardial ischemia because they promote unopposed α-adrenergic vasoconstriction (32).

# **ANTITHROMBOTIC MEASURES**

Antithrombotic measures are used to prevent growth of an existing thrombus (prior to reperfusion), and to reduce the risk of recurrence (after reperfusion).

# **Antiplatelet Agents**

Antiplatelet therapy has a more important role in coronary thrombosis than in other thrombotic conditions (probably because of the vascular manipulation involved in coronary angioplasty). The antiplatelet agents and recommended dosing regimens for ACS are shown in [Table](#page-9-0) 20.4.

#### *Aspirin*

Aspirin produces irreversible inhibition of platelet aggregation by inhibiting thromboxane production. It has a proven survival benefit in ACS (1 life saved per 42 treated) (33), and is given to all patients with suspected ischemia, as soon as possible after first patient contact. The initial dose is given as a chewable (non-enteric coated) formulation, and is intended for buccal absorption (i.e., should not be swallowed). Rectal aspirin is advised when oral delivery is not possible. Aspirin is continued indefinitely in cases of ACS, often together with a second antiplatelet agent (see next). For patients with an aspirin allergy, clopidogrel is a suitable alternative.

#### *P2Y12 Inhibitors*

P2Y12 inhibitors block the platelet surface receptors that mediate ADP-induced platelet aggregation. The drugs available for use include clopidogrel, prasugrel and ticagrelor, and their dosing regimens are shown in [Table](#page-9-0) 20.4. (Cangrelor is an intravenous P2Y12 inhibitor that is rarely used, and is not included here.) *A P2Y12 inhibitor should be added to aspirin (dual antiplatelet therapy) for all patients with ACS, and the first dose should be given prior to PCI* ([2,](#page-15-1)[5,](#page-15-14)[6\)](#page-15-13).

**CLOPIDOGREL (PLAVIX):** Clopidogrel is a prodrug that is converted to its active form in the liver, and this results in variable antiplatelet effect. Activation in the liver is also blocked by proton pump inhibitors (34), but the clinical significance of this is questioned. Once activated, clopidogrel causes irreversible platelet inhibition, and the drug should be stopped at least 5 days before a major surgical procedure. This prolonged effect is also reason to avoid clopidogrel if coronary bypass surgery is imminent.

**TICAGRELOR (BRILINTA):** Ticagrelor is a direct-acting drug that provides more potent and more consistent P2Y12 inhibition than clopidogrel, and it is superior to clopidogrel for improving outcomes (mortality rate, reinfarction) in patients with ACS (35). There is, however, an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) with ticagrelor (35), and the drug is contraindicated in patients with a prior ICH.

**PRASUGREL (EFFIENT):** Prasugrel is a prodrug like clopidogrel, but is more effective as an antiplatelet agent, and is superior to clopidogrel for preventing stent thrombosis and recurrent ischemia (36). However, the bleeding risk is higher with prasugrel (36), and the drug is contraindicated in patients with recent stroke or TIA [\(2](#page-15-1)[,5](#page-15-14)[,6](#page-15-13)).

#### *Glycoprotein Receptor Antagonists*

When platelets are activated, specialized glycoprotein receptors on the platelet surface (named IIb and IIIa) change their configuration and begin to bind fibrinogen. This allows fibrinogen molecules to form bridges between adjacent platelets, which promotes platelet aggregation. Glycoprotein receptor antagonists (also called *IIb/IIIa inhibitors*) block fibrinogen binding to activated platelets and inhibit platelet aggregation. These drugs are the most potent antiplatelet agents available, and are sometimes referred to as the *superaspirins*.

The IIb/IIIa inhibitors include *eptifibatide* (Integrilin), and *tirofiban* (Aggrastat). They are given by intravenous infusion, using the dosing regimens in [Table](#page-9-0) 20.4. These drugs are used in high-risk patients who receive emergent PCI, and are given just before or at the start of the procedure. They are managed primarily by invasive cardiologists, and are not described further here.

### **Anticoagulant Therapy**

Anticoagulation with heparin is recommended for all patients with ACS, and is started at the time of diagnosis. The options are as follows:

- 1. Unfractionated heparin is preferred for patients who receive emergent PCI or thrombolysis. The recommended dose is 60 Units as an IV bolus (maximum 4,000 Units), followed by an infusion of 12 Units/kg/hr (maximum 1,000 Units/hr) initially, titrated to achieve an activated PTT(aPTT) of 1.5–2 times control [\(3](#page-15-9)[,5](#page-15-14)). This is typically continued for 24–48 hrs.
- 2. Low-molecular-weight heparin can be used when PCI is non-emergent or deferred. The dosing regimen for *enoxaparin* is 30 mg as an IV bolus, followed in 15 minutes by 1 mg/kg by subcutaneous injection every 12 hrs [\(3](#page-15-9)[,5](#page-15-14)). (The bolus dose is not recommended in patients older than 75 years of age.) The dose is reduced by 50% (e.g., 1 mg/kg every 24 hours) when the creatinine clearance is <30 mL/min.
- 3. For patients with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (see Chapter 19), the following alternative regimens are available ([6\)](#page-15-13):
  - a. For PCI: *Bivalirudin* (a direct thrombin inhibitor), 0.75 mg/kg as IV bolus, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg/kg/hr. Reduce infusion rate to 1 mg/kg/hr for creatinine clearance <30 mL/min. Discontinue after successful PCI.
  - b. For Thrombolytic Therapy: *Fondaparinux* (factor Xa inhibitor), 2.5 mg as IV bolus, and on following day, start 2.5 mg by subcutaneous injection daily until cardiac catheterization. Contraindicated if creatinine clearance <30 mL/min.

# **LONG-TERM THERAPIES**

The treatments summarized here are instituted when patients are clinically stable (e.g., after emergent PCI), and are continued indefinitely, as tolerated.

- 1. High-intensity statin treatment with *atorvastatin,* 80 mg daily, has been shown to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events following ACS (37), and is recommended for all patients with ACS [\(5](#page-15-14)[,6](#page-15-13)).
- 2. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system is recommended for all patients with ACS, especially patients with hypertension, anterior STEMI, or heart failure associated with reduced ejection fraction ([6\)](#page-15-13). At the present time, the favored drug for this purpose is *sacubitril/valsartan* (Entresto) (38), a combination drug with an angiotensin receptor blocker, and a drug (sacubitril) that inhibits neprilysin (an enzyme that degrades natriuretic peptides). The dosing of this drug is shown in Table 18.5. RAA inhibitors are contraindicated in patients with a history of angioedema (from any source), and they should be used cautiously in patients with renal impairment who are prone to hyperkalemia.
- 3. Long-term treatment with β-blockers is recommended for all patients with ACS, especially in cases of heart failure associated with reduced ejection fraction (see Chapter 18). Metoprolol is the β-blocker most often used in this setting, and the dosing recommendations are shown in [Table](#page-7-0) 20.3.

# **ACUTE AORTIC DISSECTION**

At the outset, the following points about acute dissection of the ascending aorta deserve emphasis:

- 1. The clinical presentation can mimic, or include, ACS.
- 2. This condition is a surgical emergency, and about 60% of patients will perish without prompt surgical intervention (39).
- 3. One of every three cases is missed (40).

#### **Pathophysiology**

Aortic dissection occurs when a tear in the aortic intima allows blood to dissect between the intimal and medial layers of the aortic wall, creating a false lumen. This process can be the result of atherosclerotic damage, or accelerated degradation of the aortic wall from a genetic disorder (e.g., Marfan's syndrome). The dissection can originate in the ascending or descending aorta, and can propagate in antegrade and retrograde directions. When a dissection involves the ascending aorta between the aortic valve and the brachiocephalic artery (type A dissection), retrograde propagation can cause aortic valve insufficiency, coronary artery occlusion, and pericardial tamponade,while antegrade propagation can lead to neurologic deficits from occlusion of the aortic arch vessels.

# **Clinical Presentation**

The most common complaint is the abrupt onset of sharp chest pain, which may be described as "ripping" or "tearing", and can be substernal (ascending aortic dissection) or in the back (descending aortic dissection). Only 5% of patients with acute aortic dissection are pain-free (41). Most importantly, *the chest pain can subside spontaneously for hours to days* (42,43), and the return of chest pain is often a sign of impending aortic rupture. *The spontaneous resolution of chest pain is an important source of missed diagnoses*.

### *Clinical Findings*

The most frequent clinical findings are hypertension (50% of patients) and aortic insufficiency (50% of patients) (42,44). Unequal pulses in the upper extremities (from obstruction of the left subclavian artery) is a classic but infrequent finding (15% of cases) (42). The chest x-ray can show mediastinal widening (60% of cases) (42), but normal chest x-rays are reported in up to 20% of cases (41). The ECG can show ischemic changes (15% of cases) but it is normal in 30% of cases (41). Because of the limited sensitivity of clinical findings, additional imaging studies are required for the diagnosis.

# **Diagnostic Imaging**

The diagnosis of aortic dissection requires one of four imaging modalities (43): magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (sensitivity and specificity 98%), transesophageal echocardiography (sensitivity 98%, specificity 77%), contrast enhanced computed tomography (sensitivity 94%, specificity 87%), and aortography (sensitivity 88%, specificity 94%). As indicated, *MRI is the*

*most sensitive and specific imaging modality for the diagnosis of aortic dissection*, but CT angiography is also acceptable.

The CT image in [Figure](#page-13-0) 20.4 shows a dissection of the ascending aorta. The small arrows point to the intimal flap that separates the dissecting blood in the wall of the aorta (false lumen) from blood in the true lumen of the aorta. The presence of this flap distinguishes an aortic dissection from a saccular aneurysm of the aorta.

**FIGURE 20.4** Contrast-enhanced CT image showing an acute dissection in the ascending aorta. The intimal flap that separates the true and false lumens (indicated by the small arrows) distinguishes an aortic dissection from a saccular aneurysm. PA = pulmonary artery, DA = descending aorta.

# **Management**

The management goals in acute, type A aortic dissection include control of hypertension (to prevent aortic rupture), relief of pain (to assist in management of blood pressure), and prompt surgical intervention (the treatment of choice).

#### *Antihypertensive Therapy*

There is one major caveat for blood pressure control in aortic dissection; i.e., *the reduction in blood pressure should NOT be accompanied by tachycardia or an increase in cardiac output*, as these conditions will augment the shear forces that promote dissection. As a result, β*-blockers are preferred* for blood pressure control in aortic dissection, and vasodilators (e.g., nicardipine) should only be used in combination with β-blockers (39). The drug regimens that are used in aortic dissection are shown in [Table](#page-13-1) 20.5. Esmolol is the preferred β-blocker because it is rapidly titratable. The goal of antihypertensive management in aortic dissection is a systolic pressure of 120 mm Hg, although pressures down to 90 mm Hg are usually tolerated (39).

#### *Pain Relief*

Pain can aggravate an acute aortic dissection by activating the sympathetic nervous system, which promotes an increase in heart rate, cardiac output, and blood pressure. Thus, pain relief with intravenous opioids is an early goal of management (39).

#### *Surgical Intervention*

Open surgical repair of the ascending aorta is the standard of care in patients with acute, type A aortic dissection, and timely intervention is critical, because the mortality rate increases 1–2% per hour after the onset of symptoms (39). If the patient is at a hospital that does not provide acute cardiac surgery, then transfer to another hospital for surgical intervention is imperative. Surgical repair can reduce the mortality rate to as low as 10% (30).

# **A FINAL WORD**

# **The O<sup>2</sup> Supply-Demand Dogma**

The traditional notion that myocardial infarctions are the result of an imbalance between O<sup>2</sup> supply and O<sup>2</sup> demand is misleading, because it implies that conditions like anemia and hypoxemia can cause myocardial infarctions. However, *myocardial infarctions are caused by a blood clot that obstructs a coronary artery, not by conditions that cause a global decrease in myocardial O<sup>2</sup> delivery*.

Ever wonder why acute MIs do not occur in patients with progressive circulatory shock (where O<sup>2</sup> delivery is severely impaired)? Now you have the answer.
