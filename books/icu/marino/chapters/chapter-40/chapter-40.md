# **Acute Pancreatitis**

*Medicine cures the man who is fated not to die.*

Chinese Proverb

Acute pancreatitis is cited as one of the leading abdominal disorders that requires hospitalization ([1\)](#page-8-0), but most cases are not severe enough to warrant ICU admission. However, the cases that do require ICU admission are often (or quickly become) the sickest patients in the ICU.

This chapter describes the clinical features and management of acute pancreatitis, with emphasis on the severe cases that require ICU-level care. Management of severe pancreatits is challenging, because there is no specific treatment (other than removing any predisposing condition), and the overall mortality rate (about 25%) has not changed over the past two decades ([2\)](#page-8-1).

# **PATHOGENESIS & PRESENTATION**

The pancreas houses two types of cells: (*a*) "islet" cells that have an endocrine function, and secrete insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin, and (*b*) "acinar" cells that have an exocrine function, and secrete digestive enzymes such as amylase, lipase, and trypsin. Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory process that primarily affects the acinar (exocrine) cells. Disruption of these cells releases digestive enzymes, and proteolytic enzymes like trypsin can aggravate the pancreatic injury and promote "autodigestion" of the pancreas. The pancreatic injury triggers a systemic inflammatory response, which can lead to inflammatory injury in other organs, culminating in multiorgan failure.

# **Etiologies**

The causes of acute pancreatitis are listed in [Table](#page-1-0) 40.1. About three-quarters of the cases are the result of gallstones, alcohol abuse, or are idiopathic [\(1](#page-8-0)[,3](#page-8-2)), while the other causes that deserve mention are hypertriglyceridemia ([4,](#page-8-3)[5\)](#page-8-4), drugs [\(6](#page-8-5)), and infections ([7\)](#page-8-6).

# *Hypertriglyceridemia*

Severe hypertriglyceridemia (serum triglyceride levels >1,000 mg/dL) is responsible for up to

7% of cases of acute pancreatitis [\(4](#page-8-3)), and the frequency of cases has increased considerably in recent years ([5\)](#page-8-4). Several mechanisms may be involved, but one of the major ones is the release of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) from triglycerides, since PUFAs are highly oxidizable, and are capable of inciting an inflammatory response. (*Note:* The oxidation of PUFAs in food products is responsible for "rancidity".)

The pancreatitis from hypertriglyceridemia is more severe than other types of pancreatitis, and is associated with a greater degree of systemic inflammation and extrapancreatic organ injury ([4\)](#page-8-3). Fortunately, there is an effective treatment, which is described later in the chapter.

<sup>†</sup>Reported prevalence indicated in parentheses.

#### *Drugs*

At least 36 drugs have been implicated as a causative factor in acute pancreatitis [\(1](#page-8-0)[,6](#page-8-5)), but many of the cases are idiosyncratic reactions in case reports. The most frequently reported drugs are hydrochlorothiazide, azathioprine, and doxycycline ([6\)](#page-8-5), while the other implicated drugs include (in alphabetical order) acetaminophen, enalapril, furosemide, metronidazole, procainamide, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and valproic acid [\(1](#page-8-0)[,6](#page-8-5)).

#### *Infections*

A variety of infectious agents can cause pancreatitis ([7\)](#page-8-6), including viruses (HIV, cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster, herpes simplex, and hepatitis B), bacteria (Mycoplasma, Legionella, Leptospira, and Salmonella), fungi (Aspergillus) and parasites (Toxoplasma, Cryptosporidium). Suspicion of an infectious agent is based on the presence of other manifestations of the infection.

## **General Features**

The general features of acute pancreatitis are summarized in [Table](#page-2-0) 40.2. This is the revised Atlanta classification for acute pancreatitis [\(8](#page-8-7)), and it has three components: (*a*) a classification based on morphology, (*b*) diagnostic criteria, and (*c*) a severity of illness classification. Each of these is described next.

# **Morphology**

There are two types of acute pancreatitis, based on the presence or absence of pancreatic necrosis.

1. *Edematous pancreatitis* is characterized by diffuse inflammation of the pancreas, with no

evidence of pancreatic necrosis. This is the most common type of pancreatitis, and the clinical presentation is typically mild and self-limited, with no involvement of other organs ([1,](#page-8-0)[2\)](#page-8-1).

2. *Necrotizing pancreatitis* is characterized by areas of necrotic destruction in the pancreas, which can extend into the peripancreatic tissues. This condition can be complicated by local infection and extrapancreatric organ injury. The incidence of this type of pancreatitis varies in different reports, from as low as 5% [\(8](#page-8-7)) to as high as 40% ([4\)](#page-8-3).

<sup>†</sup>The revised Atlanta classification, from Reference 8.

# **Diagnostic Criteria**

The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires two of the following: (*a*) abdominal pain that is characteristic of acute pancreatitis, (*b*) an increase in serum amylase or lipase levels to three times the normal range, and (*c*) a contrast enhanced CT scan (or MRI) showing edema or necrotic lesions in the pancreas.

## *Pancreatic Enzymes*

Although no distinction is made between amylase and lipase in the diagnostic criteria, *lipase should be favored over amylase* for the following reasons:

- 1. An increase in serum lipase to three times normal has a greater specificity for acute pancreatitis than a similar increase in serum amylase [\(9](#page-8-8)).
- 2. The elevation in lipase occurs earlier than the elevation in amylase (4–8 hrs vs. 6–12 hrs, respectively), and it lasts much longer (i.e., 8–14 days for lipase, versus 3–5 days for amylase) ([9\)](#page-8-8).
- 3. Monitoring the lipase level alone has the same diagnostic accuracy as monitoring both (amylase and lipase) levels [\(9](#page-8-8)).

The combination of abdominal pain and increased pancreatic enzymes is diagnostic in about 75–80% of cases of acute pancreatitis ([1\)](#page-8-0), but imaging studies are a valued addition (see next).

#### *Imaging*

CT scans of the abdomen (contrast-enhanced) are often included in the diagnostic evaluation of pancreatitis because they can identify the type of pancreatitis (edematous vs. necrotizing) and reveal localized complications (e.g., infection). [Figure](#page-3-0) 40.1 shows a contrast-enhanced CT image of edematous pancreatitis. The pancreas is thickened and enhances completely, and the border of the pancreas is blurred, which is characteristic of pancreatic edema. Compare this with the image in [Figure](#page-4-0) 40.2, which shows a large area in the pancreas that is not contrast-enhanced. This represents pancreatic necrosis, and identifies the condition as necrotizing pancreatitis. Pancreatic necrosis may not appear for the first week after the onset of symptoms ([1\)](#page-8-0), so repeat imaging is advised in patients with persistent symptoms or severe pancreatitis.

<span id="page-3-0"></span>![](_page_3_Picture_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 40.1** Contrast-enhanced CT image showing edematous pancreatitis. The pancreas (outlined by the dotted line) is enlarged and enhances completely. There is also blurring of the pancreatic border, which is characteristic of edema formation.

When IV contrast cannot be administered (e.g., because of a dye allergy), CT imaging is less likely to distinguish between edematous and necrotizing pancreatitis. In this situation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a suitable alternative.

# **Severity of Disease**

The revised Atlanta classification of acute pancreatitis includes three categories for severity of disease, based on the presence or absence of complications, and extrapancreatic organ failure (see [Table](#page-2-0) 40.2). About 50% of cases are classified as *mild disease* (symptoms self-limited, and no evidence of complications or organ failure), while the remaining 50% are equally divided

between *moderately severe disease* (transient organ failure, resolves in less than 48 hours) and *severe disease* (organ failure persists for longer than 48 hours) ([10\)](#page-8-9). The mortality in acute pancreatitis is mostly limited to patients with severe disease, and is about 20–25% [\(1](#page-8-0)[,2](#page-8-1)). *Pancreatic enzymes and CT images have a poor correlation with the severity of illness*.

The extrapancreatic organ involvement in acute pancreatitis is related to the systemic inflammatory response, and can involve single or multiple organs. The organs typically involved are the lungs (i.e., acute respiratory distress syndrome), the kidneys (acute kidney injury), and the circulatory system (hypotension and circulatory shock). This organ involvement may not appear in the early stages of illness.

**FIGURE 40.2** Contrast-enhanced CT image showing necrotizing pancreatitis. The area that is not contrast-enhanced (indicated by the arrows) represents necrosis in the neck and body of the pancreas. Image from Reference 8.

# **Biliary Evaluation**

Since gallstones are the leading cause of acute pancreatitis, an evaluation of the gall bladder and biliary tree is advised in all cases of confirmed acute pancreatitis. Contrast-enhanced CT images may suffice for this evaluation, but in cases where a CT scan is unavailable or inconclusive, bedside ultrasonography is recommended.

# **MANAGEMENT**

Management in the ICU is primarily for patients with moderately severe or severe disease, and mostly involves supportive care, especially with fluids and nutrition.

### **Fluid Management**

Severe pancreatitis is associated with loss of intravascular fluid through leaky systemic capillaries, and the resulting hypovolemia can produce additional pancreatic necrosis. For this reason, attention to volume resuscitation is recommended early in the course of severe pancreatitis. The following fluid regimen is recommended:

- 1. Ringer's lactate (RL) is the recommended fluid, based on evidence of improved outcomes with RL compared to isotonic saline ([11,](#page-8-10)[12\)](#page-8-11). However, since RL contains calcium, it should not be used in hypercalcemia-related pancreatitis.
- 2. Start with a bolus infusion of 10 mL/kg in patients with hypovolemia, and follow with a continuous infusion of 1.5 mL/kg per hour ([13\)](#page-8-12). Avoid the bolus infusion if there is no evidence of hypovolemia.
- 3. *Caution:* More aggressive volume infusion (i.e., bolus of 20 mL/kg, and a rate of 3 mL/kg/hr) promotes fluid overload, and does not improve outcomes [\(13](#page-8-12)).
- 4. The goal of fluid management is to maintain a mean arterial pressure ≥65 mm Hg, and a urine output ≥0.5 mL/kg per hour.

#### *Vasopressors*

As always, vasopressors are advised if fluid therapy does not achieve the desired blood pressure. There are no official recommendations regarding vasopressor therapy in severe pancreatitis, but norepinephrine is an appropriate choice. All vasoconstrictor drugs can reduce splanchnic blood flow (especially phenylephrine), which could promote pancreatic necrosis, so careful titration of infusion rates (and avoidance of phenylephrine) is advised.

# **Nutrition**

Nutrition should be started early (within 48 hours after the onset of illness) using an oral diet (if tolerated) or enteral tube feedings [\(1](#page-8-0)[,14](#page-8-13)). Parenteral nutrition is reserved for cases where enteral feeding is not tolerated (e.g., from an ileus).

#### *Enteral Nutrition*

The preference for enteral nutrition is based on the ability of oral feeding to exert a trophic effect on the bowel mucosa. This helps to maintain the integrity of the bowel mucosa and reduce the risk of bacterial translocation across the bowel wall, which is considered the major source of pancreatic infections [\(15](#page-8-14)). Clinical studies have shown that *enteral nutrition is associated with fewer infections, less multiorgan failure, and a lower mortality rate than total parenteral nutrition* in patients with severe pancreatitis ([16\)](#page-8-15).

When enteral tube feedings are used, it is unclear if gastric or jejunal feeding is optimal ([17\)](#page-8-16). Based on evidence that nasogastric feeding produces no apparent harm in severe pancreatitis ([18\)](#page-8-17), it is reasonable to start with nasogastric feeding. Elemental feeding formulas (which are

low in fat) should be preferred.

# **Abdominal Complications**

Local complications of pancreatitis include infection, pseudocyst formation, and abdominal compartment syndrome.

#### *Pancreatic Infection*

About one-third of patients with necrotizing pancreatitis develop an infection in the necrotic areas of the pancreas, which typically appears 7–10 days after the onset of illness [\(19](#page-8-18)). Infection may be heralded by persistent or recurrent fever and leukocytosis, but these findings are also common in necrotic pancreatitis without infection. A contrast-enhanced CT image can reveal probable infection by the presence of gas bubbles, as shown in [Figure](#page-6-0) 40.3.

If infection is suspected, antibiotic therapy should be started, with coverage for gramnegative enteric pathogens. (*Note:* Prophylactic antibiotics do not reduce the incidence of pancreatic infections, and are not recommended [\(20](#page-8-19)).) However, these infections are difficult to treat with antibiotics, and CT-guided drainage may be necessary. There is some debate about the timing of drainage, but there is evidence that early drainage produces better results than delayed drainage [\(21](#page-8-20)). If noninvasive drainage is not successful, then surgical debridement (necrosectomy) may be necessary.

<span id="page-6-0"></span>![](_page_6_Picture_6.jpeg)

**FIGURE 40.3** Contrast-enhanced CT image showing extensive necrosis of the pancreas with numerous gas bubbles, indicating infection.

#### *Abdominal Compartment Syndrome*

There are several sources of increased intra-abdominal pressure in severe pancreatitis, including peripancreatic fluid collections, ascites, and edema of the bowel wall (from aggressive volume infusion). An increase in intra-abdominal pressure (>12 cm H2O) has been reported in 55% of patients with severe pancreatitis ([22\)](#page-8-21), and pressures that exceed 20 cm H2O can cause oliguria (as described in Chapter 34). Therefore, an abdominal pressure measurement is recommended for any patient with severe pancreatitis complicated by oliguria.

### **Specific Therapies**

The following management is specific to the cause of the pancreatitis.

### *Hypertriglyceridemia*

The pancreatitis associated with hypertriglyceridemia can be treated with insulin, which acts on lipoprotein lipase to reduce serum triglyceride levels ([4\)](#page-8-3). An intravenous infusion of insulin (0.1–0.4 Units/kg/hr) can reduce triglyceride levels by 85–90% in 24 hours if combined with fasting ([23\)](#page-8-22). The goal of treatment in acute pancreatitis is a serum triglyceride below 500 mg/dL ([4\)](#page-8-3). A 5–10% dextrose infusion is advised during the insulin infusion, along with careful monitoring of serum glucose levels. Once the pancreatitis has been successfully managed, continued treatment with lipid-lowering drugs like gemfibrozil or fenofibric acid may be needed to keep triglyceride levels below 500 mg/dL ([4\)](#page-8-3).

#### *Gallstone Pancreatitis*

When acute pancreatitis is associated with gallstones, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with sphincterotomy is indicated if there is evidence of biliary obstruction (e.g., by ultrasound). Cholecystectomy can be performed during the initial hospitalization for mild pancreatitis, but it is delayed (4–6 weeks) after an episode of severe pancreatitis.

# **A FINAL WORD**

# **Alcohol & Pancreatitis (?)**

Although alcohol is widely regarded as a major source of pancreatitis, the strong link between alcohol and pancreatitis was made at a time when the diagnosis of pancreatitis was based solely on elevation of the serum amylase. The problem is that amylase is also secreted by the parotid glands, and alcohol stimulates the release of salivary amylase. In fact, *hyperamylasemia of salivary origin is reported in 40% of cases of acute alcohol intoxication* ([6\)](#page-8-5). It is thus possible that elevations of salivary amylase created the strong association of alcohol abuse and pancreatitis.

There are about 30 million alcoholics in the United States ([24\)](#page-8-23), and the number of hospital admissions for pancreatitis is 275,000 per year ([25\)](#page-8-24), or about 69,000 per year if you assume that 25% of cases of acute pancreatitis are caused by alcohol. This means that less than 1% (0.2%) of alcoholics develop acute pancreatitis each year, which is not a very strong association.

Why is this important? Because, whenever a patient with acute pancreatitis has a history of alcohol abuse, no efforts are made to find another cause of the illness. It seems wise not to continue this behavior.
