# **Sodium**

*People say life can't exist without air, but it does under water; in fact, it started in the sea.*

Richard Feynman (*[a](#page-14-0)*)

Life originated in a 3.5% salt water solution (i.e., the salinity of the ocean), and humans have retained some of that heritage, since our cells are bathed in a 0.6% salt water solution. The salinity (sodium concentration) of this extracellular bath is highly regulated, because it plays an important role in determining the volume of the intracellular and extracellular fluid compartments.

This chapter begins by describing the forces that determine the distribution of total body water, and the importance of sodium in determining these forces, and then presents an organized approach to the "dysnatremias" ([1,](#page-14-1)[2\)](#page-14-2); i.e., hypernatremia and hyponatremia.

# **OSMOTIC ACTIVITY**

The movement of water between fluid compartments is determined by a property of fluids known as *osmotic activity*, which is a reflection of the *number of solute particles* per unit volume of solvent (3). Osmotic activity is a *colligative property*, and depends only on the number of solute particles in a fluid, and not on the electrical charge, size, or chemical behavior of the solutes. The total osmotic activity of a solution is the summed osmotic activity of all the solute particles in the solution.

# **Relative Osmotic Activity**

When two fluid compartments are separated by a membrane that is permeable to solutes and water, the solutes in each fluid compartment will equilibrate across the membrane, and the osmotic activity will be equivalent in both fluid compartments. Since water movement follows solute movement, the volume in both fluid compartments will be equivalent. This is illustrated in the [Figure](#page-1-0) 35.1 (see the panel on the left).

# *Effective Osmotic Activity*

When two fluid compartments are separated by a membrane that is not freely permeable to solutes, the solutes will not distribute evenly in the fluid compartments, and the osmotic activity will be different in each compartment. In this situation, water moves from the fluid with the lower osmotic activity (which has a higher water content) to the fluid with the higher osmotic activity (which has a lower water content), as demonstrated in the panel on the right in Figure 35.1. The difference in osmotic activity between the fluid [compartments](#page-1-0) is called the *effective osmotic activity*, and it is the force that drives the movement of water between the fluid compartments. This force is also called the *osmotic pressure*.

The relative osmotic activity between two fluid compartments is expressed as *tonicity*; i.e., if the osmotic activity in the two compartments is equal, the fluids are described as *isotonic* (see the left-side panel in [Figure](#page-1-0) 35.1), and if the osmotic activity differs, the fluid with the higher osmotic activity is described as *hypertonic*, and the fluid with the lower osmotic activity is described as *hypotonic* (see the right-side panel in [Figure](#page-1-0) 35.1).

# *Summary*

The following statements summarize the relationship between osmotic activity and the transcellular shift of water.

- 1. A change in the effective osmotic activity or *tonicity* of extracellular fluid produces a transcellular water shift.
  - a. When the extracellular fluid is hypertonic, water moves out of cells.
  - b. When the extracellular fluid is hypotonic, water moves into cells.

# **Units of Osmotic Activity**

The unit of measurement for osmotic activity is the osmole (osm), which is defined as one gram molecular weight (one mole) of a nondissociable substance, and is equivalent to 6 × 1023 particles (Avogadro's Number). Osmotic activity can be expressed in relation to the volume of water in a solution, or in relation to the volume of the solution (4,5).

- 1. Osmotic activity per volume of solution is called *osmolarity*, and is expressed as milliosmoles per liter (mosm/L).
- 2. Osmotic activity per volume of water is called *osmolality*, and is expressed as milliosmoles per kilogram of H2O (mosm/kg H2O, or mosm/kg).

Plasma is mostly (95%) water, so the osmotic activity in plasma is typically expressed as osmolality (mosm/kg H2O). However, there is little difference between the osmolality and osmolarity of extracellular fluid, and the two terms are often used interchangeably (5).

#### *Conversion Factors*

The following formulas (where n is the number of nondissociable particles) can be used to convert plasma solute concentrations to units of osmolality:

1. For solute concentrations expressed in mEq/L:

$$\frac{\text{mEq/L}}{\text{valence}} \times n = \text{mosm/kg H}_2\text{O}$$
 (35.1)

Thus, for univalent ions like sodium, the plasma concentration in mEq/L is equivalent to the osmotic activity in mosm/kg H2O.

1. For solute concentrations expressed in mg/dL:

$$\frac{\text{mg/dL} \times 10}{\text{mol wt}} \times n = \text{mosm/kg H}_2\text{O}$$
 (35.2)

where mol wt is molecular weight, and the factor 10 is used to convert deciliters (dL) to liters. For example, glucose has a molecular weight of 180, so a plasma glucose concentration of 90 mg/dL is equivalent to (90 × 10/180) × 1 = 5 mosm/kg H2O.

# **Plasma Osmolality**

The plasma osmolality can be measured or calculated.

### *Measured Plasma Osmolality*

The standard method for measuring plasma osmolality is the *freezing point depression* method. Solute-free water freezes at 0º C, and this temperature decreases by 1.86° C for each osmole of solute that is added to one kilogram of water. Therefore, the extent of depression of the freezing point of an aqueous solution can be used to determine the osmotic activity of the solution. This method is considered the "gold-standard" for measuring plasma osmolality, and is available in most clinical laboratories. The normal plasma osmolality is 285–295 mosm/kg H2O.

#### *Calculated Plasma Osmolality*

Plasma osmolality can also be calculated using the concentrations of the principal solutes in plasma; i.e., sodium, chloride, glucose, and urea (3); i.e.,

$$Posm = 2 \times Na + \frac{glucose}{18} + \frac{BUN}{2.8}$$
 (35.3)

where Posm is the plasma osmolality in mosm/kg H2O, Na is the plasma sodium concentration in mEq/L, glucose and BUN are the plasma glucose and urea concentrations in mg/dL, and the factors 18 and 2.8 are the molecular weights of glucose and urea divided by 10, respectively (which converts their concentrations to mosm/kg H2O). The sodium concentration is doubled to account for the negative ions (mostly chloride) that electrically balance sodium.

**EXAMPLE:** Using normal plasma concentrations of Na (140 mEq/L), glucose (90 mg/dL), and BUN (14 mg/dL), the plasma osmolality is: (2 × 140) + 90/18 + 14/2.8 = 290 mosm/kg H2O. This is within the range of the measured plasma osmolality (285–295 mosm/kg H2O).

**EFFECTIVE PLASMA OSMOLALITY:** Urea readily crosses cell membranes, so an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) will not increase the effective osmotic activity of plasma. In other words, *azotemia is a hyperosmotic, but not a hypertonic, condition*. Therefore, the calculation of effective plasma osmolality does not include the BUN; i.e.,

<span id="page-3-0"></span>Effective Posm = 
$$(2 \times Na) + \frac{glucose}{18}$$
 (35.4)

**EXAMPLE:** Using normal plasma concentrations of Na (140 mEq/L) and glucose (90 mg/dL), the effective plasma osmolality is (2 × 140) + 90/18 = 285 mosm/kg H2O, which is very close to the total osmolality (290 mosm/kg H2O).

### *Spotlight on Sodium*

If the glucose is removed from [Equation](#page-3-0) 35.4, the calculated Posm is 280 mosm/kg H2O, which is 98% of the calculated Posm that includes glucose (i.e., 285 mosm/kg H2O). This demonstrates the following:

- 1. Sodium is responsible for 98% of the effective plasma osmolality.
- 2. The sodium concentration in extracellular fluid (plasma) is the principal factor that determines the distribution of total body water in the intracellular and extracellular fluid compartments, and hence it is also the principal determinant of the extracellular volume.

# **HYPERNATREMIA**

Hypernatremia (i.e., plasma sodium >145 mEq/L) has been reported in as many as 25% of ICU patients, and *in most cases, it is acquired during the ICU stay* (6). The mechanisms and management of hypernatremia are outlined in [Figure](#page-5-0) 35.2. This approach is based on the extracellular volume (ECV), and this creates three categories of hypernatremia: hypovolemic, normovolemic, and hypervolemic.

# **Hypovolemic Hypernatremia**

Hypernatremia associated with a low ECV is due to fluid loss that is hypotonic to plasma. The average sodium concentration in fluids that can be lost is shown in [Table](#page-4-0) 35.1 (7–9). Note the following:

- 1. All the fluids are hypotonic to plasma (i.e., have a sodium concentration <135 mEq/L), so loss of these fluids will in hypernatremia.
- 2. All the fluids contain sodium, so loss of these fluids will result in sodium depletion as well as water depletion.

Common sources of hypotonic fluid loss in ICU patients include vomiting, diarrhea, and urine loss from diuretics or glycosuria.

#### *Consequences*

Hypernatremia increases the osmolality of the extracellular fluid, which draws water out of cells and decreases cell volumes. This effect is most prominent in the brain. However, the shrunken brain cells begin to regain volume after about 9 hours, thanks to the intracellular accumulation of "idiogenic osmolytes", and the cells can return to their normal volumes after just 48 hours (10).

**HYPERNATREMIC ENCEPHALOPATHY:** The most common complication of hypernatremia is an encephalopathy that varies widely in incidence and severity. It is more likely to appear when the rise in serum sodium is rapid, and can present with lethargy, cognitive impairment, delirium, seizures and even coma (6,11). Cell shrinkage and osmotic demyelination are recognized as the culprits (11).

**OTHERS:** Hypernatremia has surprisingly few adverse consequences other than the encephalopathy. There are occasional reports of rhabdomyolysis (12), which often appears along with the encephalopathy (11). Hypertonicity also has negative inotropic effects, but there is no evidence that this results in heart failure. Finally, hypotonic fluid loss does not decrease the blood pressure unless fluid losses are severe, because the loss of hypotonic fluids increases the osmotic pressure in plasma, which draws fluid from the interstitial space into the plasma to help maintain intravascular volume.

#### *Management*

Isotonic saline is used to correct hypotension, but not to correct the hypernatremia (because it is

ineffective) (13). The recommended fluid regimens to correct the hypernatremia include the infusion of 5% dextrose in water (D5W), or the addition of water to enteral tube feedings (e.g., 200 mL every 8 hours) (6,13). However, hypotonic fluid loss also results in the loss of sodium, so 0.45% (half-normal) saline seems more appropriate than D5W as a replacement fluid.

**RATE OF CORRECTION:** Aggressive infusion of hypotonic fluids has always been discouraged because of the risk of cerebral edema, which is heightened by the accumulation of osmolytes in shrunken brain cells that helps regain the original cell volume. The optimal correction rate for hypernatremia is not known, but the traditional recommendation has been to limit the rate of correction to ≤0.5 mEq/L/hr [\(2](#page-14-2),14). However, correction rates exceeding 0.5 mEq/L/hr have been used safely, without causing cerebral edema (14).

# **Normovolemic Hypernatremia**

Hypernatremia in the setting of a normal ECV is usually the result of water loss without significant sodium loss. This condition is common in ICU patients with hypernatremia (15), and occurs when the replacement fluid is hypertonic to the fluid that is lost. (With this scenario, sodium losses are replaced, but a net water deficit remains.) Selective loss of free water is also characteristic of diabetes insipidus.

<span id="page-5-0"></span>![](_page_5_Figure_4.jpeg)

#### *Diabetes Insipidus*

Diabetes insipidus (DI), is a disorder of renal water conservation, and is characterized by loss of urine that is largely devoid of solute (16,17). The underlying problem in DI is loss of the effect produced by the antidiuretic hormone (ADH), a polypeptide released by the posterior pituitary gland that promotes water reabsorption in the distal renal tubules. Three types of DI are recognized:

- 1. *Central DI* is characterized by failure of ADH release from the posterior pituitary (16). Common causes include surgical resection of a pituitary tumor, traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and autoimmune diseases (16).
- 2. *Nephrogenic DI* is characterized by impaired renal responsiveness to ADH. Possible causes in critically ill patients include drugs (amphotericin, aminoglycosides, dopamine, lithium, etc.), hypokalemia, and the recovery phase of ATN (17).
- 3. *Gestational DI* is the result of a vasopressinase enzyme that is produced by the placenta and inactivates arginine vasopressin (ADH) (18). Production of the enzyme increases throughout pregnancy, and the DI usually appears at the end of the second, or in the third, trimester.

**DIAGNOSIS:** The hallmark of DI is a dilute urine in the face of hypertonic plasma. In central DI, the urine osmolarity is often below 200 mosm/L, whereas in nephrogenic DI, the urine osmolarity is 200–500 mosm/L (19). The diagnosis of DI is based on the response of the urine osmolality to fluid restriction. Failure of the urine osmolarity to increase more than 30 mosm/L in the first few hours of complete fluid restriction will identify a case of DI. The response to vasopressin can then differentiate central from nephrogenic DI; i.e., in central DI, the urine osmolality increases by at least 50% after vasopressin administration, whereas in nephrogenic DI, the urine osmolality is unchanged after vasopressin.

**DESMOPRESSIN:** In central DI, renal water retention can be restored with the administration of *desmopressin*, a synthetic analog of vasopressin that lasts longer, and has no vasoconstrictor effects. Desmopressin is available as an oral tablet, an intranasal spray, and a parenteral preparation for subcutaneous or intravenous injection. Only 5% of the drug is absorbed from the GI tract (20), so the oral route is least desirable. The parenteral dose of desmopressin is 1 μg by subcutaneous injection every 12 hours, or 2 μg by IV injection every 12 hours (20).

**NSAIDS:** The approach to nephrogenic DI involves removing any offending drug, but this does not always correct the problem. When this occurs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can increase renal responsiveness to ADH (because prostaglandins block the actions of ADH, and NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis). Indomethacin (2 mg/kg/day) has been more successful than other NSAIDs in restoring ADH responsiveness (21).

# **Hypervolemic Hypernatremia**

Hypernatremia with a high extracellular volume can be the result of sodium bicarbonate infusions, but it is more frequently associated with excessive infusions of isotonic saline for

hypotonic fluid loss.

### *Management*

In patients with normal renal function, excess sodium and water are excreted rapidly. When renal sodium excretion is impaired, it might be necessary to increase renal sodium excretion with a diuretic (e.g., furosemide). Because the urinary sodium concentration during furosemide diuresis (~80 mEq/L) is less than the plasma sodium concentration, diuresis can aggravate the hypernatremia. Therefore, the diuresis should be combined with infusions of D5W to correct the hypernatremia.

# **HYPONATREMIA**

Hyponatremia (plasma [Na] < 135 mEq/L) is considered the most common electrolyte abnormality in clinical practice (22), and is found in 30–40% of hospitalized patients (23).

# **Pseudohyponatremia**

Plasma has an aqueous phase and a solid (nonaqueous) phase. Small electrolytes like sodium are confined to the aqueous phase, while larger molecules like lipids and proteins are located in the solid phase. The automated measurements performed in the clinical laboratory include both phases of plasma (24), and thus the measured plasma sodium could underestimate the actual (aqueous phase) sodium level. However, 95% of the plasma is water (i.e., aqueous phase), so there is normally little difference between the measured and actual sodium concentrations.

However, a problem arises when there is a marked increase in protein or lipid levels in blood. In this situation, there is an increase in the nonaqueous or solid phase of plasma, which will decrease the measured plasma sodium concentration, while the actual (aqueous phase) sodium concentration is unchanged. This spurious decrease in the measured plasma sodium is called *pseudohyponatremia* (24), and it becomes significant when plasma protein levels reach 12 g/dL (normal range is 5.5–8 g/dL), and triglyceride levels rise to 1,500 mg/dL (normal range is 25– 175 mg/dL). The clinical conditions that can produce [pseudohyponatremia](#page-7-0) are listed in Table 35.2 (24).

From Reference 24.

#### *Diagnosis*

Pseudohyponatremia can be uncovered by measuring the plasma osmolality, which will be normal (285–295 mosm/kg H2O) with pseudohyponatremia, and will be reduced (<275 mosm/kg H2O) with true hyponatremia.

### *Hyperglycemia*

Hyperglycemia is another potential cause of spurious hyponatremia. When glucose does not readily enter cells, the resultant hyperglycemia draws fluid out of cells. This increases the aqueous phase of plasma, and has a dilutional effect on sodium. For every 100 mg/dL increase in blood glucose, there is a 2.4 mEq/L decrease in the serum sodium concentration (22,25). This is expressed in the following equation:

Corrected [Na] = Measured [Na] + 
$$\left[2.4 \times \frac{\text{glucose} - 100 \text{ (mg/dL)}}{100 \text{ (mg/dL)}}\right]$$
(35.5)

**EXAMPLE:** If a patient with a serum sodium concentration of 130 mEq/L also has a blood glucose of 600 mg/dL, the corrected serum sodium is 130 + (2.4 × 5) = 142 mEq/L.

# *The Approach*

The evaluation and management of true hyponatremia can be organized around the extracellular volume (ECV), as shown in [Figure](#page-9-0) 35.3. This approach is similar to the one used for hypernatremia, and it has three types of hyponatremia: hypovolemic, normovolemic, and hypervolemic.

<span id="page-9-0"></span>![](_page_9_Figure_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 35.3** Flow diagram for hyponatremia based on the extracellular volume (ECV).

# **Hypovolemic Hyponatremia**

Hyponatremia with a low ECV is the result of sodium loss in the urine or GI tract, combined with impaired water excretion by the kidneys (26). Water retention is needed to produce the hyponatremia (because loss of hypotonic fluids results in *hyper*natremia), and is the result of the following events: (*a*) the sodium losses result in hypovolemia, which stimulates the reninangiotensin-aldosterone system, (*b*) the released angiotensin stimulates the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland, and (*c*) ADH promotes water retention by the kidneys.

#### *Etiologies*

The clinical conditions that promote hypovolemic hyponatremia are listed in [Figure](#page-9-0) 35.3. The most cited causes are thiazide diuretics, adrenal insufficiency, and cerebral salt wasting.

**THIAZIDE DIURETICS:** Hypernatremia is reported in about one-third of patients being treated with a thiazide diuretic, and usually appears after 3 weeks of treatment (27). The mechanism for the hyponatremia is complex, and beyond the intent of this chapter.

**ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY:** Primary adrenal insufficiency involves mineralocorticoid deficiency, which promotes renal sodium wasting. The hyponatremia usually appears in the chronic (not acute) form of illness. Secondary adrenal insufficiency (which originates in the hypothalamus or pituitary) is primarily a deficiency of glucocorticoids, and is not associated with hyponatremia.

**CEREBRAL SALT WASTING:** Cerebral salt wasting is a condition of urinary sodium loss and hyponatremia that is associated with neurologic disorders, especially subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, CNS infections, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, and neurosurgery (28).

## *Diagnostic Considerations*

The source of sodium loss (i.e., kidneys or GI tract) is usually apparent, but if not, a spot urine sodium can help to distinguish renal from extrarenal losses; i.e., urine Na+ > 20 mEq/L suggests a renal source of sodium loss, while a urine Na+ < 20 mEq/L suggests an extrarenal site of sodium loss.

# **Normovolemic Hyponatremia**

Hyponatremia with a normal ECV is the result of water retention with minimal sodium loss. This is usually the result of uncontrolled, "nonosmotic" release of ADH from the pituitary, or excessive water intake.

# *Etiologies*

This causes of normovolemic hyponatremia include: the syndrome of inappropriate ADH (SIADH), primary polydipsia, physiological stress, and (rarely) [hypothyroidism](#page-9-0) (see Figure 35.3).

**SIADH:** SIADH is a condition of uncontrolled or nonosmotic release of ADH that is associated with a variety of other conditions, including neoplasms, infections, and drugs. The hallmark of SIADH is the combination of hypotonic plasma, inappropriately concentrated urine (urine osmolality >100 mosm/kg H2O) and an elevated urine sodium (>20 mEq/L) (29). This condition can be difficult to distinguish from cerebral salt wasting, and the only difference may be the ECV (which is decreased with cerebral salt wasting, and normal with SIADH).

**PHYSIOLOGICAL STRESS:** Physiological stress is well known for promoting the release of ACTH from the anterior pituitary, but a lesser known component of the stress response is the release of ADH from the posterior pituitary. (Teleologically, water retention from the actions of ADH should be advantageous during periods of stress, when insensible losses are likely to be high.)

Stress-induced release of ADH would explain the increased risk of hyponatremia in postoperative patients (22), and this should also apply to critically ill patients. The popularity of hypotonic IV fluids like Ringer's lactate adds further to the risk of hyponatremia in hospitalized patients (30). (See Table 10.2 for the osmolarity of intravenous fluids.)

**PRIMARY POLYDIPSIA:** Water intoxication (primary polydipsia) is a source of hyponatremia that occurs primarily in patients with developmental or psychiatric disorders (31). Patients with hyponatremia from polydipsia also have impaired free water clearance by the kidneys (32), and both factors may be necessary to produce sustained hyponatremia.

Another example of hyponatremia caused by heavy consumption of a dilute fluid is *beer potomania* (33), which is typically found in chronic alcoholics who are poorly nourished and are prone to binge drinking.

**HYPOTHYROIDISM:** Although hypothyroidism is considered a cause of hyponatremia, the evidence for this is not convincing. For example, a retrospective analysis of 8,000 patients with hypothyroidism revealed that 5% of the patients had hyponatremia, but almost all (98%) of these patients had other conditions that could have caused the hyponatremia (34). Despite the difficulty establishing a causal link between hypothyroidism and hyponatremia, a serum TSH assay is recommended in the evaluation of hyponatremia of undetermined etiology (34).

## *Diagnostic Considerations*

When the cause of normovolemic hyponatremia is unclear, the urine osmolality can help to distinguish between SIADH and primary polydipsia: i.e., in SIADH, the unregulated actions of ADH produce a concentrated urine (urine osmolality 300–500 mosm/kg H2O), whereas water intoxication produces a dilute urine (i.e., urine osmolality <200 mosm/kg H2O).

# **Hypervolemic Hyponatremia**

Hypervolemic hyponatremia is the result of salt and water retention, with water retention exceeding sodium retention. This condition occurs in advanced heart failure, cirrhosis, and renal failure. Renal failure is associated with a high urine [Na+] (>20 mEq/L), while the urine [Na+] is low (<20 mEq/L) in heart failure and cirrhosis (except when a diuretic is active).

# **MANAGEMENT OF HYPONATREMIA**

The management of hyponatremia is determined by two factors: the ECV, and the presence or absence of hyponatremic encephalopathy.

# **Hyponatremic Encephalopathy**

Hyponatremia results in a hypotonic extracellular fluid, which then causes fluid to move across the blood-brain barrier and into brain parenchyma. This process culminates in diffuse cerebral edema with an increased intracranial pressure (35), and when this condition produces symptoms, it is called *hyponatremic encephalopathy* (36). This is considered an immediate threat to life, and thus requires prompt action to reduce the cerebral edema with hypertonic saline.

Hyponatremic encephalopathy is more likely appear when the hyponatremia is acute (i.e., develops in less than 48 hours), but there is no correlation between the severity of the hyponatremia and the appearance or severity of the encephalopathy (36). As a result, *the plasma Na+ concentration has no role in the decision about initiating hypertonic saline*.

#### *Symptoms*

Hyponatremic encephalopathy can present with a wide variety of symptoms, but the earliest symptoms usually include nausea, vomiting, headache, and ataxia, while advanced symptoms can include agitation, confusion, seizures, and coma. Although the early symptoms can be nonspecific, *the presence of any symptom that suggests possible cerebral edema is an indication for rapid correction of the hyponatremia with hypertonic saline*.

# **Hypertonic (3%) Saline**

The treatment of symptomatic hyponatremia with hypertonic saline is summarized in [Table](#page-12-0) 35.3. A 3% NaCL solution (Na+ = 513 mEq/L, osmolarity = 1,026 mosm/L) is given in bolus doses of 2 mL/kg (or 150 mL), which are repeated every few hours until the symptoms resolve. Each bolus dose can increase the sodium concentration by as much as 2 mEq/L, and an increase of 5–6 mEq/L should produce some improvement in symptoms. If there is no improvement at this point, it is possible that hyponatremia is not the cause of the symptoms.

The 3% NaCL solution can be delivered safely through a peripheral vein (36,37), and treatment continues until the symptoms resolve. However, there are limits placed on the rate and extent of Na correction, as explained next.

- 1. Use 3% NaCL (Na+ = 153 mEq/L, osmolarity = 1,026 mosm/L).
- 2. Give IV bolus doses of 2 mL/kg (or 150 mL), which are repeated every few hours until the symptoms resolve. This regimen can be given via peripheral veins.
- 3. Assess after the serum Na+ has increased by 5 mEq/L if there is no improvement, consider another cause for the symptoms.
- 4. The following limits are recommended as a preventive measure for osmotic demyelination.
  - a. The initial increment in serum Na+ should not exceed 5 mEq/L in 2 hrs, or 10 mEq/L in 5 hrs.
  - b. The daily increment in serum Na+ should not exceed 10 mEq/L on the first day, and 8 mEq/L on subsequent days.
  - c. The final plasma Na+ should not exceed 130 mEq/L.

# **Osmotic Demyelination Syndrome**

Correction of the sodium that is too rapid, or overshoots the normal sodium concentration can produce a devastating neurologic disorder caused by osmotic damage to the myelin sheath of brainstem neurons. This *osmotic demyelinating syndrome*, also known as "central pontine myelinolysis", has a biphasic course. The initial presentation includes varying degrees of altered mentation, along with seizures, but this improves, only to be followed at a later time by profound deterioration in overall health, with dysarthria, oculomotor dysfunction, quadriparesis, and even

locked-in syndrome. (38). Chronic hyponatremia poses a greater risk for this complication than acute (within 48 hrs) hyponatremia.

To reduce the risk of osmotic demyelination, the maximum rate of correction for Na+ is limited to 8–10 mEq/L over any 24-hour period, and the end-point of Na+ correction is a serum concentration of 130 mEq/L. (22,36). This end-point is below the normal range, but it provides a buffer against overshooting the end-point.

## *Overcorrection*

Overcorrection of the serum sodium occurs in as many as 25% of cases (39), even when preventive measures are used. The tendency for overcorrection can be attributed to a spontaneous water diuresis that occurs in some patients during treatment with hypertonic saline. This diuresis decreases the extracellular volume, which concentrates the sodium and augments its rate of correction.

The water diuresis is more frequent in hyponatremia caused by drugs (especially thiazides) and by water intoxication. This diuresis can be prevented or terminated by desmopressin.

**DESMOPRESSIN:** [Desmopressin](#page-13-0) (a synthetic analog of vasopressin) can be used as shown in Table 35.4 (40,41). It should be started when there is an abrupt increase in urine flow (indicating water diuresis) during corrective therapy with hypertonic saline, and it can be used routinely in cases of hyponatremia that have a high risk of overcorrection (i.e., hyponatremia from adrenal insufficiency, drugs, and primary polydipsia.) Fluid restriction is mandatory during therapy with desmopressin, to prevent the development of severe hyponatremia.

# <span id="page-13-0"></span>**TABLE 35.4 Desmopressin to Prevent or Reverse Overcorrection of Hyponatremia**

#### *Indications:*

- If the increment in serum Na+ exceeds the limits listed in [Table](#page-12-0) 35.3.
- If there is an abrupt increase in urine output (e.g., >100 mL/hr) during corrective therapy with hypertonic saline
- As a routine measure in conditions where overcorrection is a risk (see text).

#### *Dose:*

• 2 μg by subcutaneous injection every 12 hrs.

#### *Caveats:*

- Desmopressin is not advised when the hyponatremia is due to unregulated release of ADH.
- Fluid restriction is mandatory during R<sup>x</sup> with desmopressin.

# **Asymptomatic Hyponatremia**

Rapid correction of the hyponatremia is not necessary in asymptomatic patients. Instead, the fluid management is based on the ECV, as shown in [Figure](#page-9-0) 35.3.

## *Hypovolemia*

In cases of hypovolemic hyponatremia, isotonic saline will help to improve blood pressure and tissue perfusion, but the hyponatremia may not show significant improvement until the

responsible conditions are treated or eliminated.

#### *Normovolemia*

The problem in normovolemic hyponatremia is water excess without sodium excess, so fluid restriction is indicated. The usual goal is a daily fluid intake that is 500 mL less than the daily urine output (26). Fluid restriction is notoriously intolerable for patients, but the following drug options available for patients with SIADH.

**DEMECLOCYCLINE:** Demeclocycline is a tetracycline derivative that blocks the effects of ADH in the renal tubules. It is intended for patients with chronic SIADH who do not tolerate fluid restriction, and is given in a dose of 600–1,200 mg daily in divided doses (26). Maximum effect takes several days, and success is variable. Demeclocycline can be nephrotoxic, so monitoring renal function is advised while using the drug.

**THE VAPTANS:** The vaptans are vasopressin antagonists that block the actions of vasopressin (ADH) in the kidneys and elsewhere. There are two drugs in this class: conivaptan and tolvaptan. Conivaptan can be given intravenously, while tolvaptan is an oral medication. Both agents can increase the serum sodium by 6 or 7 mEq/L (42,43). These drugs are expensive and are not currently popular.

#### *Hypervolemia*

Patients with hypervolemic hyponatremia are both salt and water overloaded, with the water overload exceeding the salt overload. Furosemide diuresis could theoretically correct this problem. However, continued activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in heart failure and cirrhosis helps to maintain the hyponatremia.

# **A FINAL WORD**

## **What You See is Not What You Get**

The fundamental truth about hypernatremia and hyponatremia is that they are disorders of water balance, not sodium balance. This "sleight of hand" is unique among electrolyte disorders; e.g., hypomagnesemia is a sign of magnesium depletion, but hyponatremia is a sign of water overload (absolute or relative), not sodium depletion. Understanding this basic distinction may help you to navigate through the maze of possibilities when confronting a patient with hypernatremia or hyponatremia.
