# **Calcium and Phosphorus**

*Nature never deceives us, it is always we who deceive ourselves.*

Jean Jacques Rousseau (1754)

Calcium and phosphorus are responsible for much of the structural integrity of the bony skeleton. Although neither element is found in abundance in soft tissue, both have important roles in vital cell functions. Phosphorus participates in aerobic energy production, whereas calcium participates in blood coagulation, neuromuscular transmission, and smooth muscle contraction. In light of these roles, it is surprising that abnormalities in calcium and phosphorus balance are devoid of adverse consequences in most patients.

### **CALCIUM BASICS**

Calcium is the most abundant electrolyte in the human body, (the average adult has more than half a kilogram of calcium), but 99% is in bone ([1,](#page-11-0)[2\)](#page-11-1). Parathyroid hormone and vitamin D (calcitriol) promote calcium resorption from bone and thereby maintain plasma calcium levels, while calcitonin (from the thyroid gland) has the opposite effect and inhibits calcium release from bone.

### **Plasma Calcium**

The calcium in plasma is present in three forms, as depicted in [Figure](#page-1-0) 38.1. Approximately half of the calcium is ionized (biologically active) and the remainder is either bound to albumin (80%) or complexed with sulfate and phosphate anions (20%) ([1,](#page-11-0)[2\)](#page-11-1). The concentration of total and ionized calcium in plasma is shown in [Table](#page-0-0) 38.1. These values may vary slightly in different clinical laboratories.

#### *Total vs. Ionized Calcium*

The calcium assay used by most clinical laboratories measures all three fractions of calcium in plasma, and this can be misleading in patients with hypoalbuminemia. This is demonstrated in [Figure](#page-1-0) 38.1, which shows that a decrease in plasma albumin will decrease the total calcium concentration without affecting the ionized calcium concentration. Since the ionized calcium is the physiologically active fraction, the hypocalcemia caused by hypoalbuminemia is not physiologically significant.

A variety of correction factors have been proposed for adjusting the plasma calcium concentration in patients with hypoalbuminemia. However, none of these are reliable [\(3](#page-11-2)[,4](#page-11-3)), and *the measurement of ionized calcium with ion-specific electrodes is necessary for accuracy.*

**FIGURE 38.1** The three fractions of calcium in plasma and the contribution of each to the total calcium concentration. The column on the right shows how a decrease in plasma albumin can reduce the total plasma calcium without influencing the ionized (active) fraction.

Some precautions are necessary when collecting blood samples for an ionized calcium measurement. Loss of carbon dioxide from a blood sample could falsely lower the ionized calcium (by increasing calcium binding to albumin), so it is important to avoid gas bubbles in the blood sample. Anticoagulants (e.g., heparin, citrate, and EDTA) can bind calcium, so blood samples should not be placed in collection tubes that contain these anticoagulants. Tubes with red stoppers ("red top" tubes) contain silicone and are adequate for measuring ionized calcium in serum samples.

## **IONIZED HYPOCALCEMIA**

Ionized hypocalcemia (plasma ionized Ca++ < 4.6 mg/dL or <1.7 mmol/L) is extremely common in ICUs [\(5](#page-11-4)[–7](#page-11-5)), with one multicenter survey reporting an incidence of 88% in ICU patients ([7\)](#page-11-5). The conditions that predispose to ionized hypocalcemia in ICU patients are listed in [Table](#page-2-0) 38.2.

### **Predisposing Conditions**

Hypoparathyroidism is a leading cause of hypocalcemia in outpatients, but is not a consideration in the ICU unless a patient has had recent thyroid surgery.

<span id="page-2-0"></span>

| TABLE<br>38.2<br>Causes<br>of | Ionized<br>Hypocalcemia<br>in<br>the<br>ICU |  |  |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--|--|
| Most Common                   | Others                                      |  |  |
| Alkalosis                     | Massive Transfusion                         |  |  |
| Magnesium Deficiency          | Pancreatitis                                |  |  |
| Renal Failure                 | Rhabdomyolysis                              |  |  |
| Sepsis                        | Tumor Lysis Syndrome                        |  |  |

#### *Alkalosis*

Alkalosis promotes the binding of calcium to albumin, and thereby reduces the fraction of ionized calcium in blood. Infusions of sodium bicarbonate can also promote ionized hypocalcemia because the infused bicarbonate forms complexes with free calcium.

#### *Magnesium Depletion*

Magnesium depletion promotes hypocalcemia by inhibiting parathormone secretion [\(8](#page-11-6)) and reducing end organ responsiveness to parathormone ([9\)](#page-11-7). *Hypocalcemia from magnesium depletion is refractory to calcium replacement therapy, and magnesium replacement often corrects the hypocalcemia*.

#### *Systemic Inflammation*

Systemic inflammation promotes ionized hypocalcemia via the actions of cytokines to stimulate calcitonin release and blunt the response to parathormone [\(5](#page-11-4)[,6](#page-11-8)). This makes sepsis a common cause of hypocalcemia in the ICU.

#### *Renal Failure*

Renal failure can promote ionized hypocalcemia as a result of phosphate retention and impaired conversion of vitamin D to its active form in the kidneys. However, the acidosis in renal failure will decrease the binding of calcium to albumin, which helps to maintain ionized calcium levels.

#### *Massive Transfusion*

Ionized hypocalcemia is almost universal in trauma victims who receive massive blood transfusions, and the hypocalcemia can be severe (<0.9 mmol/L) in over half of the patients ([10\)](#page-11-9). The culprit is the citrate anticoagulant used in banked blood, which complexes with calcium.

#### *Others*

Other sources of ionized hypocalcemia include acute pancreatitis (usually severe),

rhabdomyolysis, and tumor lysis syndrome.

### **Clinical Manifestations**

Potential consequences of hypocalcemia include enhanced cardiac and neuromuscular excitability, and reduced contractile force in cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle. However, *most cases of ionized hypocalcemia in the ICU have no apparent adverse consequences* [\(5](#page-11-4)[–7](#page-11-5)), and this has prompted the suggestion that routine monitoring of calcium should be abandoned in ICU patients ([6\)](#page-11-8).

#### *Neuromuscular*

The neuromuscular manifestations of hypocalcemia that are often cited include hyperreflexia, paresthesias, seizures and tetany [\(11](#page-11-10)). However, these rarely occur in ICU patients ([5–](#page-11-4)[7\)](#page-11-5). *Chvostek's sign* (facial twitching when tapping the facial nerve) is cited as a sign of hypocalcemia, but this sign *has been reported in over 50% of healthy subjects with normocalcemia* [\(12](#page-11-11)). Trousseau's sign (i.e., carpopedal spasms in the same arm where a blood pressure cuff is inflated to exceed the systolic pressure) is also considered a reliable sign of hypocalcemia ([13\)](#page-11-12), but this is poorly documented.

#### *Cardiovascular*

The cardiovascular complications of hypocalcemia include hypotension, decreased cardiac output, and ventricular ectopic activity. However, these complications are rare, and are reported only in cases of extreme ionized hypocalcemia (<0.65 mmol/L) ([14\)](#page-11-13).

### **Calcium Replacement Therapy**

Calcium replacement therapy is recommended only in the rare instances where hypocalcemia causes a serious adverse reaction. (The principal use of intravenous calcium is to block the cardiotoxic effects of hyperkalemia.) If calcium replacement is necessary, the intravenous calcium solutions and a recommended dosing regimen are shown in [Table](#page-3-0) 38.3.

<span id="page-3-0"></span>

| TABLE<br>38.3                                 | Intravenous<br>Calcium<br>Replacement<br>Therapy |                                |                            |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Solution                                      | Elemental Ca                                     | Unit Volume                    | Osmolarity                 |
| 10% Calcium chloride<br>10% Calcium gluconate | 27 mg/mL<br>9 mg/mL                              | 10 mL ampules<br>10 mL ampules | 2,000 mosm/L<br>680 mosm/L |

For symptomatic hypocalcemia:

- 1. Give a bolus dose of 200 mg elemental calcium (e.g., 22 mL of 10% calcium gluconate) in 100 mL isotonic saline over 10 minutes.
- 2. Follow with a continuous infusion of 1–2 mg/kg per hour for 6–12 hrs.
- 3. Monitor ionized calcium levels hourly for the first few hours.

#### *Calcium Salt Solutions*

The calcium solutions for intravenous use are 10% calcium chloride and 10% calcium gluconate. *Calcium chloride contains three times more elemental calcium than calcium gluconate*, but calcium gluconate is usually preferred because it has a lower osmolarity, and is less irritating

when injected.

#### *Dosing Regimen*

A bolus dose of 200 mg elemental calcium (diluted in 100 mL isotonic saline and given over 5– 10 minutes) should raise the total serum calcium by 0.5 mg/dL ([14\)](#page-11-13), but levels will begin to fall after 30 minutes. Therefore, the bolus dose of calcium should be followed by a continuous infusion at a dose rate of 1–2 mg/kg/hr (elemental calcium) for at least 6 hours. Individual responses will vary, so calcium dosing should be guided by the level of ionized calcium in blood.

**CAUTION:** Intravenous calcium has been shown to promote multiorgan failure in critically ill patients ([15\)](#page-11-14), possibly by promoting intracellular calcium overload, which can produce a lethal cell injury ([16\)](#page-11-15).

### **Summation**

Hypocalcemia in ICU patients is considered to be more of a general marker of illness than a pathological condition that requires treatment. Most cases of symptomatic hypocalcemia occur in patients with hypoparathyroidism, which is rarely encountered in the ICU.

### **HYPERCALCEMIA**

Hypercalcemia is usually the result of a hyperparathyroidism or malignancy, with malignancy being the usual culprit in ICU patients [\(17](#page-11-16)). The malignancies associated with hypercalcemia include multiple myeloma, breast, lung, and ovarian cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and some lymphomas (18).

### **Clinical Manifestations**

The manifestations of hypercalcemia are varied and nonspecific. Potential manifestations can be organized as follows:

- 1. *Gastrointestinal:* nausea, vomiting, constipation, and ileus.
- 2. *Cardiovascular:* hypovolemia, hypotension, and shortened QT interval.
- 3. *Renal:* polyuria and acute kidney injury.
- 4. *Neurologic:* confusion, depressed consciousness, and coma.

Manifestations usually begin to appear when the serum calcium is >12.5 mg/dL (or the ionized calcium is >3.0 mmol/L), and they are almost always present when the serum calcium is >14 mg/dL (or the ionized calcium is >3.5 mmol/L) [\(17](#page-11-16)). Manifestations are more likely to appear with rapid increases in serum calcium.

### **Management**

Treatment is indicated when the serum calcium is >14 mg/dL (or ionized calcium is >3.5 mmol/L), or when there are neurologic symptoms. The treatment options for hypercalcemia are summarized in [Table](#page-5-0) 38.4

#### *Saline Infusion*

Hypercalcemia promotes calcium loss in the urine (hypercalciuria), and this produces an osmotic diuresis that can result in hypovolemia. When this occurs, urinary calcium excretion decreases, resulting in a more rapid rise in the serum calcium. Therefore, *volume resuscitation to correct hypovolemia and promote renal calcium excretion is the first goal of management* for hypercalcemia. Isotonic saline is recommended to maintain a urine output of 100–150 mL/hr, and this can decrease the serum calcium by 1–2 mg/dL [\(17](#page-11-16)).

#### *Furosemide*

Loop diuretics like furosemide can increase urinary calcium excretion, but there is no evidence that intravenous furosemide adds to the benefit of saline infusions (19), and it can be counterproductive by promoting hypovolemia. Therefore, *furosemide is recommended only to alleviate volume overload* ([17,](#page-11-16)19).

From References 17,18.

#### *Calcitonin*

As mentioned earlier, calcitonin lowers serum calcium by inhibiting calcium release from bone. Salmon calcitonin can be given subcutaneously in a dose of 4 Units/kg every 12 hours. The response is rapid (onset within a few hours), and the serum calcium can decrease by 1–2 mg/dL (18). However, tachyphylaxis is common, and the treatment is discontinued after 24–48 hrs.

#### *Glucocorticoids*

Glucocorticoids have several effects that can decrease the serum calcium, including decreased osteoclast activity in bone, and decreased extrarenal production of calcitriol (in lymph nodes). The glucocorticoid regimen usually begins with IV hydrocortisone (200–400 mg daily) for 3 days, followed by prednisone (10–20 mg/day) for 7 days (18). Effectiveness is most evident in patients with multiple myeloma and lymphoma ([17\)](#page-11-16).

#### *Bisphosphonates*

The bisphosphonates are potent inhibitors of osteoclast activity. Two drugs in this class, *zoledronate* (4 mg IV over 15 min) and *pamidronate* (90 mg IV over 2 hours) are considered first line agents in the treatment of severe hypercalcemia ([17,](#page-11-16)18). Zoledronate is favored because it is easier to administer, and it may be more effective than pamidronate ([17,](#page-11-16)18). Both drugs have a delayed onset of action (2–4 days), and should be started as soon as the decision to treat is made. The peak effect is at 4–7 days, and the effect lasts 1–4 weeks. These agents can be nephrotoxic, and some recommend reduced dosing when the creatinine clearance is <50 mL/min (18).

#### *Dialysis*

If necessary, hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis can be used to remove calcium in patients with renal failure.

## **HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA**

Inorganic phosphate (PO<sup>4</sup> ) is predominantly intracellular in location, where it participates in glycolysis and high energy phosphate (ATP) production. The normal concentration of PO<sup>4</sup> in plasma is shown in [Table](#page-0-0) 38.1 (18).

Hypophosphatemia (serum PO<sup>4</sup> < 2.5 mg/dL or <0.8 mmol/L) is present in as many as 80% of ICU patients (20), and is especially common after major surgery, and in multisystem trauma and fulminant sepsis.

### **Predisposing Conditions**

Hypophosphatemia can be the result of reduced phosphate absorption from the GI tract, increased phosphate excretion in the urine, or the transcellular movement of phosphate into cells.

<span id="page-7-0"></span>![](_page_7_Figure_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 38.2** The effect of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) on the serum phosphate level. Data from Reference 21.

#### *Glucose Loading*

The movement of glucose into cells is accompanied by a similar movement of PO<sup>4</sup> into cells (presumably because PO<sup>4</sup> is needed for glycolysis), and this can lead to hypophosphatemia if extracellular PO<sup>4</sup> levels are marginal. *Glucose loading is the most common cause of hypophosphatemia in hospitalized patients* (21,22), and typically occurs with refeeding in alcoholic, malnourished, or debilitated patients. In fact, hypophosphatemia is considered a major source of *refeeding syndrome*, which can culminate in respiratory failure and cardiovascular collapse (22,23).

An example of the glucose loading effect is demonstrated in [Figure](#page-7-0) 38.2, which shows the effect of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) on serum PO<sup>4</sup> levels (21). Note that hypophosphatemia appeared after 2 days of TPN, and reached severe levels (serum PO<sup>4</sup> < 1 mg/dL) after one week. TPN regimens are characteristically rich in carbohydrates (see Chapter 50), and the risk of hypophosphatemia mandates close monitoring of the serum PO<sup>4</sup> levels during TPN.

The glucose loading effect is also responsible for the hypophosphatemia that occurs in *diabetic ketoacidosis* (see Chapter 32). In this situation, the prolonged hyperglycemia results in an osmotic diuresis (from glycosuria) that promotes urinary PO<sup>4</sup> losses, and the hypophosphatemia appears when insulin is given (which drives glucose and PO<sup>4</sup> into cells).

#### *Respiratory Alkalosis*

Respiratory alkalosis can increase intracellular pH, and this accelerates glycolysis. The increase in glucose utilization is then accompanied by an increase in glucose and PO<sup>4</sup> movement into cells (24). This may be an important source of hypophosphatemia in ventilator-dependent patients, because overventilation and respiratory alkalosis are common in these patients.

#### *Physiological Stress*

Stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors can move PO<sup>4</sup> into cells, and this creates a risk of hypophosphatemia during periods of physiological stress (from the actions of endogenous catecholamines). This is demonstrated by the common association of hypophosphatemia with panic attacks (25).

#### *Systemic Inflammation*

There is an inverse relationship between serum PO<sup>4</sup> and circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines (26). Possible explanations include increased PO<sup>4</sup> utilization by activated neutrophils, and a transcellular shift of PO<sup>4</sup> caused by endogenous catecholamines.

#### *Phosphate Binding Agents*

Aluminum can form insoluble complexes with inorganic phosphates. As a result, aluminumcontaining compounds such as sucralfate can impede the absorption of phosphate in the upper GI tract and promote phosphate depletion (27).

### **Clinical Manifestations**

Hypophosphatemia is often clinically silent, even when the serum PO<sup>4</sup> falls to extremely low levels. In one study of patients with severe hypophosphatemia (i.e., serum PO<sup>4</sup> < 1 mg/dL), none of the patients showed evidence of harm (28). However, severe phosphate depletion creates a risk for impaired oxidative metabolism.

#### *Oxidative Metabolism*

Phosphate depletion has several effects that could impair oxidative metabolism. These are summarized below, and indicated in [Figure](#page-9-0) 38.3.

- 1. *Cardiac output:* Phosphate depletion can impair myocardial contractility and reduce cardiac output. Hypophosphatemic patients with heart failure have shown improved cardiac performance after phosphate supplementation (29).
- 2. *Erythrocytes:* Reduction of high energy phosphate production from glycolysis in erythrocytes can reduce the deformability of red cells. This may explain why severe hypophosphatemia can be accompanied by a hemolytic anemia (30).
- 3. *Oxyhemoglobin Dissociation:* Phosphate depletion is accompanied by depletion of 2,3 diphosphoglycerate, and this shifts the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve to the left. When this occurs, hemoglobin is less likely to release oxygen to the tissues.
- 4. *Energy Availability:* Phosphate depletion can reduce the availability of cellular energy by impeding the production of high-energy phosphate compounds (ATP).

#### *Muscle Disorders*

Hypophosphatemia is a reported cause of rhabdomyolysis (31) and respiratory muscle weakness (32), but the clinical significance of these associations is unclear.

**FIGURE 38.3** The effects of hypophosphatemia that threaten oxidative metabolism and cellular energy production. See text for explanation

### **Phosphate Replacement**

Intravenous phosphate replacement is recommended for all patients with severe hypophosphatemia (i.e., serum PO<sup>4</sup> < 1.0 mg/dL or 0.3 mmol/L), and for patients with hypophosphatemia of any degree who also have cardiac dysfunction, respiratory failure, or rhabdomyolysis. The phosphate solutions and dosing regimen are shown in [Table](#page-9-1) 38.5 (33).

<sup>†</sup>If the plasma K+ is ≥4 mEq/L, use sodium phosphate, and if the plasma K+ is <4 mEq/L, use potassium phosphate.

### **Summation**

Like hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia is common and often clinically silent, and is considered more of a general marker of illness than a pathological condition that deserves corrective action (20).

### **HYPERPHOSPHATEMIA**

The principal cause of hyperphosphatemia in the ICU is end-stage renal disease (usually chronic, and often dialysis-dependent). Less common sources are tumor lysis syndrome and hypoparathyroidism.

### **Clinical Manifestations**

The consequences of hyperphosphatemia include the formation of insoluble calcium–phosphate complexes (with deposition into soft tissues), and hypocalcemia ([11\)](#page-11-10). However, neither of these manifestations has any proven significance in ICU patients.

### **Management**

The management of hyperphosphatemia usually involves the use of phosphate binders to reduce GI absorption of phosphate.

### *Phosphate Binders*

Phosphate binders are separated into calcium-containing and non-calcium-containing products. Some prefer the non-calcium-containing binders because there is a daily limit of calcium intake (<800 mg) in patients with chronic kidney disease. However, there is no evidence that one type of phosphate binder is superior to the other (34). The following are examples of each type of phosphate binder.

**SEVELAMER:** Sevelamer is a non-calcium-containing phosphate binder that is provided as a powder, and is reconstituted in water. The dose is determined by the serum PO<sup>4</sup> level (35):

| Serum<br>PO4<br>(mg/dL) | Dosage                   |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| 5.6–7.4                 | 800<br>mg<br>TID         |
| 7.5–8.9                 | 1,200–1,600<br>mg<br>TID |
| >9                      | 1,600<br>TID             |

(TID is three times daily). Sevelamer gluconate is preferred to sevelamer hydrochloride because the latter preparation can cause a metabolic acidosis (36).

**CALCIUM ACETATE:** Calcium acetate (PhosLo®) is available in tablets (667 mg per tab) or an oral solution (667 mg/5 mL). The initial dose is 1,334 mg (2 tabs or 10 mL) three times daily, and

this can be increased to achieve a serum PO<sup>4</sup> < 6 mg/dL, as long as hypercalcemia does not develop (37).

### **A FINAL WORD**

### **The Normalization Heuristic**

Disorders of calcium and phosphate in ICU patients are notable for the lack of apparent adverse consequences in most patients. This is especially true for hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia, which seem to be general markers of illness rather than pathologic disorders that need corrective treatment.

The practice of correcting abnormal electrolyte values, even when there is no apparent harm, has been termed the *normalization heuristic* (38), and has two characteristic features: it is very common, and is lacking in merit. It is important to emphasize that the normal range for electrolytes is a statistically-determined domain (i.e., two standard deviations around the mean), and values outside this domain can be normal outliers, and not pathological entities that need corrective action.
