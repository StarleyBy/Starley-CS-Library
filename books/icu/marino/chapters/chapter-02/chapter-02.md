# **Central Venous Access**

*Good doctors leave good tracks.*

J. Willis Hurst, MD (*[a](#page-14-0)*)

As a medical student in the early 1970s, I recall that vascular access was achieved almost exclusively by inserting narrow-bore needles into superficial veins in the arms (or wherever we could find them). The practice of inserting flexible plastic catheters into larger, more centrally placed veins was in its infancy (e.g., cannulation of the internal jugular vein was introduced only a few years earlier, in 1969) ([1\)](#page-14-1), and the procedure was often performed in the operating room, using a skin incision to introduce the (single-lumen) catheters, and forceps to advance the catheters through the subcutaneous tissues.

Now fast forward to modern times, and central venous access is a staple of patient care in ICUs, with multilumen catheters inserted percutaneously at the bedside, using real-time ultrasonography to guide the cannulation process (as described in Chapter 1). Central venous cannulation has become an essential skill for the care of critically ill patients, and this chapter will supplement the procedural skill (which must be acquired at the bedside) by presenting the relevant considerations involved in establishing central venous access.

## **CONSIDERATIONS IN PREVENTION**

Central venous catheters have risks that far outweigh those of peripheral vein catheters [\(2](#page-14-2)), so the decision to insert a central venous catheter has implications for patient safety. There are, however, safer alternatives to central venous catheters in certain situations, as described next.

## **Shrinking Indications**

The following are the traditional indications for inserting a central venous catheter.

- 1. When peripheral venous access is difficult to obtain or maintain.
- 2. For prolonged venous access (i.e., more than a few days).
- 3. When multiple intravenous therapies are required (taking advantage of the multilumen

capabilities of central venous catheters).

- 4. For the infusion of vasopressors, hypertonic fluids (including total parenteral nutrition), or vesicants (e.g., antineoplastic agents).
- 5. For patients with life-threatening hemodynamic instability.
- 6. For specialized interventions, such as acute hemodialysis, temporary transvenous pacing, or invasive hemodynamic monitoring.

It is now possible to avoid central venous access for many of the traditional indications, thanks to the emergence of midline catheters and peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs). These catheters are described in Chapter 1. Both are inserted in the arm, just above the antecubital fossa (see Figure 1.3), and both can be used for prolonged venous access (especially PICCs, which can remain in place for months), and for infusions of vasopressors and hypertonic fluids ([3\)](#page-14-3). These catheters are also available with multiple lumens, for patients who require multiple intravenous therapies. Central venous access is still preferred for patients with lifethreatening hemodynamic instability (circulatory shock), and it is mandatory for specialized interventions like acute hemodialysis. Thus, 4 of the 6 traditional indications for central venous access have alternative solutions.

Midline catheters and PICCs have fewer risks than central venous catheters (e.g., there is no risk of pneumothorax because the catheters are inserted in the arm) and they are more readily accepted by patients. Because of these advantages, the demand for central venous catheters is steadily declining (4), and midline catheters are becoming the preferred replacement (5).

#### *Contraindications*

There are no absolute contraindications to central venous cannulation, including the presence or severity of a coagulation disorder (6,7). There is a recommendation to correct a platelet count that is <20,000 x 106/L or an INR >3 prior to catheter insertion (7), but there is no evidence to support this recommendation.

## **Infection Control Measures**

Infection control is an essential part of vascular cannulation, and the preventive measures recommended for central venous access are shown in [Table](#page-1-0) 2.1 (8). When used together as a "bundle", these measures have been effective in reducing the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections (9–11). The following is a brief description of these preventive measures.

Cannulation Site When possible, avoid femoral vein cannulation.

### *Hand Hygiene*

Proper hand hygiene is considered one of the most important, and most neglected, methods of infection control. Alcohol-based, waterless hand rubs are preferred, if available; otherwise, handwashing with soap (plain or antimicrobial soap) and water is acceptable (8,12). Hand hygiene should be performed before and after palpating catheter insertion sites, and before and after donning gloves to insert, replace, or manipulate catheters.

#### *Skin Antisepsis*

The catheter insertion site should be decontaminated just prior to cannulation, and the preferred antiseptic agent is chlorhexidine (usually in alcohol). This preference is based on clinical studies showing that chlorhexidine is superior to other antiseptic agents for limiting the risk of catheterassociated infections (13). The enhanced efficacy of chlorhexidine is attributed to its prolonged (≥6 hours) antimicrobial activity on the skin, which is maximized if allowed to air-dry on the skin (14). The drying time is typically 30 seconds for dry skin, and up to 2 minutes for moist skin (11).

#### *Barriers*

All vascular cannulation procedures, except those involving small peripheral veins, should be performed using full barrier precautions, which includes caps, masks, sterile gloves, sterile gowns, and a sterile drape from head to foot. (*Note*: The only barrier precaution advised for peripheral vein cannulation is the use of gloves, and nonsterile gloves are acceptable as long as the gloved hands do not touch the catheter) (8).

## *Site Selection*

Cannulation of the femoral vein is considered the least desirable of the central venous access sites, primarily due to an increased risk of thrombosis with femoral vein catheters (15). When the central line bundle was introduced, there was also a higher risk of catheter-related septicemia with femoral catheters. However, *studies in more recent years have shown no increase in the risk of catheter-related septicemia with femoral catheters* (16). This is attributed to increased attention to infection control measures, and the current belief is that *the risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections is not related to the location of the insertion site, but rather to how the site is maintained* (in terms of infection control measures) (11).

## **INTERNAL JUGULAR VEIN**

The most popular site for central venous access is the internal jugular vein at the base of the neck. The right side is preferred because the vessels run a relatively straight course, which reduces the risk of catheter misplacement.

## **Anatomy**

The internal jugular vein (IJV) is located under the sternocleidomastoid muscle on either side of the neck, and it runs obliquely down the neck along a line drawn from the pinna of the ear to the sternoclavicular joint. In the lower neck region, the vein is typically located just anterior and lateral to the carotid artery (although anatomic relationships can vary), and both vessels run through the triangle created by the two heads of the sternocleidomastoid muscle (see [Figure](#page-4-0) 2.1). At the base of the neck, the IJV and subclavian vein join to form the innominate vein, and the convergence of the right and left innominate veins forms the superior vena cava.

## **Cannulation Techniques**

#### *Positioning*

Tilting the body so the head is below the horizontal plane (the Trendelenburg position) distends the IJV to facilitate cannulation, and increases venous pressure to reduce the risk of air embolism. In healthy subjects, a head-down body tilt to 15° is associated with a 20–25% increase in the diameter of the IJV, while greater degrees of tilt have no further effect (17). Thus, *only a limited (15*°*) body tilt is needed for IJV cannulation*. The head-down tilt is not necessary (and is usually not tolerated) in patients with venous congestion (e.g., from heart failure), and it is not advised in patients with increased intracranial pressure.

The head should be rotated slightly in the opposite direction to straighten the course of the vein. Excessive head rotation (beyond 40° from midline) pulls the IJV over the carotid artery, and this overlap increases the risk of carotid artery puncture (18). This risk is highlighted by evidence of posterior wall puncture in as many as 40% of ultrasound guided IJV cannulations (19).

### *Ultrasound Guidance*

When real-time ultrasound is used to guide cannulation of the IJV, there is an increased success rate, fewer cannulation attempts, a shorter time to cannulation, and a reduced risk of carotid artery puncture (20). As a result, ultrasound guidance is a standard practice for catheterization of the IJV (21). (*Note:* The technique of ultrasound-guided vascular cannulation is described in Chapter 1.)

The IJV is well suited for ultrasound imaging because it is close to the skin, and there are no intervening structures to interfere with transmission of the ultrasound beam. A short-axis (crosssectional) view of the IJV on the right side of the neck is shown in [Figure](#page-4-1) 2.2. This image was obtained by placing the ultrasound probe at the apex of the triangle formed by the clavicular and sternal heads of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. (The probe should be oriented so it transects the muscle.) Note that the IJV is anterior and lateral to the carotid artery, and that there is some overlap of the vessels. This overlap creates the risk of carotid artery puncture, as explained earlier, and mandates that intraluminal placement of the catheter is confirmed. (See Figure 1.9.)

**FIGURE 2.2** Short-axis view of the internal jugular vein (IJV) and carotid artery (CA), obtained by placing the ultrasound probe at the apex of the triangle formed by the two heads of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The green dot marks the lateral side of the image. See text for further explanation.

#### *Landmark Method*

When ultrasound imaging is not available, cannulation of the IJV is guided by surface landmarks. There are two approaches using surface landmarks, as described next.

**ANTERIOR APPROACH:** For the anterior approach, the operator first identifies the triangular area at the base of the neck created by the separation of the two heads of the sternocleidomastoid muscle (see [Figure](#page-4-0) 2.1). The IJV and carotid artery run through this triangle. The operator first locates the carotid artery pulse in this triangle; once the artery is located by palpation, it is gently

retracted toward the midline and away from the IJV. The probe needle is then inserted at the apex of the triangle (with bevel facing up) and the needle is advanced toward the ipsilateral nipple at a 45° angle from the skin. If the vein is not entered by a depth of 5 cm, the needle should be drawn back and advanced again in a more lateral direction.

**POSTERIOR APPROACH:** For the posterior approach, the insertion point for the probe needle is 1 cm above the point where the external jugular vein crosses over the lateral edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The probe needle is inserted at this point (with the bevel at 3 o'clock) and then advanced along the underbelly of the muscle in a direction pointing to the suprasternal notch. The internal jugular vein should be encountered 5 to 6 cm from the insertion point.

## **Complications**

Accidental puncture of the carotid artery is the most feared complication of IJV cannulation. In a review of six randomized controlled trials of IJV cannulation by experienced operators, the summed incidence of carotid artery puncture was 9.2% when anatomic landmarks were used, and 1.8% with ultrasound guidance (20). If the carotid artery is punctured by the small-bore probe needle, it is usually safe to remove the needle and compress the site for at least 5 minutes (double the compression time for patients with a coagulopathy). Insertion of a catheter into the carotid artery is more of a problem because removing the catheter can be fatal (22,23). *If confronted with accidental cannulation of the carotid artery, leave the catheter in place and consult a vascular surgeon or interventional radiologist.*

|                       | IJV                                                            | SV   | FV   |  |

Data from Reference 15. IJV = internal jugular vein, SV = subclavian vein, FV = femoral vein.

Other mechanical complications (e.g., hemo/pneumothorax) are less common, and have an aggregated incidence of 2% when anatomic landmarks are used, and <1% with ultrasound guidance (20). Finally, the risk of catheter-related septicemia with IJV catheters is slightly higher than the risk with [subclavian](#page-5-0) catheters (15), but the difference is small (0.5% vs 1.4%, see Table 2.2), and the infectious risk at both sites is considered equivalent (11).

## **SUBCLAVIAN VEIN**

The subclavian vein was once the favored site for central venous access, but the emergence of ultrasound guidance has eroded its popularity because of interference from the overlying clavicle.

## **Anatomy**

The subclavian vein is a [continuation](#page-4-0) of the axillary vein as it passes over the first rib (see Figure 2.1). It runs most of its course along the underside of the clavicle (sandwiched between the clavicle and the first rib), and at some points is only 5 mm above the apical pleura of the lungs. The underside of the vein sits on the anterior scalene muscle along with the phrenic nerve, which comes in contact with the vein along its posteroinferior side. Situated just deep to the vein, on the underside of the anterior scalene muscle, is the subclavian artery and brachial plexus. At the thoracic inlet, the subclavian vein meets the internal jugular vein to form the innominate vein. The subclavian vein is 3–4 cm in length, and the diameter is 7–12 mm in the supine position (24). The diameter of the vein does not vary with respiration (unlike the IJV), which is attributed to strong fascial attachments that fix the vein to surrounding structures and hold it open (24). These attachments may also prevent collapse of the vein with volume depletion.

## **Cannulation Techniques**

## *Positioning*

The head-down body tilt (Trendelenburg position) to 15° increases the diameter of the subclavian vein by about 10%, with no further effect from greater degrees of tilt (14). Despite this minimal effect, the increase in venous pressure in the Trendelenburg position (which reduces risk of air embolism) has justified the recommendation for the head-down body tilt during subclavian vein cannulation (25). Other popular maneuvers (aimed at bringing the subclavian vein closer to the clavicle), such as turning the head or placing a rolled towel under the shoulder, are not advised because they decrease the cross-sectional area of the vein (24,26).

#### *Ultrasound Guidance*

The use of real time ultrasound improves the success rate of subclavian vein cannulation (from 82% to 97%) and decreases the complication rate (from 30% to 11%) (27). However as mentioned earlier, ultrasound imaging is a challenge for the subclavian vein because of interference from the overlying clavicle. The vein can be visualized from above or below the clavicle, but the infraclavicular approach is the popular choice.

**INFRACLAVICULAR APPROACH:** This approach begins by identifying the clavicular head of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and its insertion on the clavicle; this marks the portion of the clavicle that overlies the subclavian vein (as shown in [Figure](#page-4-0) 2.1). Orient the ultrasound probe so it transects the clavicle (with the orientation marker pointing cephalad), and place the probe just below the lower edge of the clavicle in this region. This should produce a short-axis view like the image in [Figure](#page-7-0) 2.3, which includes the subclavian vein and artery, as well as the apical pleura. Note the proximity of the subclavian vein to the apical pleura, highlighting the risk of pneumothorax during the cannulation procedure.

Identifying the subclavian vein by compression may not be possible because of the overlying clavicle, and color Doppler imaging may be necessary (see Figure 1.8). At the end of the cannulation procedure, the pleural line should be inspected for evidence of *lung sliding* to rule out iatrogenic pneumothorax (see later).

#### *Landmark Method*

To cannulate the subclavian vein without ultrasound, first mark the region of the clavicle that overlies the subclavian vein, as shown in [Figure](#page-4-0) 2.1. The vein can be entered from above or below the clavicle in this region, but the infraclavicular approach is the popular route.

<span id="page-7-0"></span>![](_page_7_Figure_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 2.3** Infraclavicular, short-axis view of the subclavian vein (SV), subclavian artery (SA), and apical pleura, obtained by placing the ultrasound probe just below the clavicle in the region where it overlies the subclavian vein. See text for further explanation. Ultrasound image from Reference 25.

**INFRACLAVICULAR APPROACH:** At the lateral edge of the marked area, insert the probe needle (with the bevel at 12 o'clock) just below the clavicle, and advance the needle along the underside of the clavicle, in the direction of the suprasternal notch. The needle should enter the subclavian vein within a few centimeters. When the vein is punctured, turn the bevel to 3 o'clock to help direct the guidewire into the superior vena cava. It is important to keep the needle on the underside of the clavicle to avoid puncturing the subclavian artery (which lies deep to the subclavian vein) and the apical pleura.

In obese patients, the subclavian vein can be more deeply situated, and a deeper trajectory for the probe needle may be needed. This creates the risk for puncture of the subclavian artery or apical pleura. *In morbidly obese patients, the depth of the subclavian vein can exceed the reach of the probe needle* (26). For these reasons, the landmark approach to subclavian vein cannulation should be avoided, if possible, in morbidly obese patients.

## **Complications**

The acute complications of subclavian vein cannulation (using ultrasound to landmark rates) include puncture of the subclavian artery (1% to 6%), pneumothorax (1% to 4%), brachial plexus injury (0% to 3%), phrenic nerve injury (0% to 2%), and catheter malposition (8% to 9%) (27). Complications associated with indwelling catheters include septicemia, thrombosis, and subclavian vein stenosis. The latter complication appears days or months after catheter removal,

and has a reported incidence of 15–50% (28). The risk of stenosis is the principal reason to *avoid cannulation of the subclavian vein in patients who might require long-term hemodialysis access in the ipsilateral arm*.

## **FEMORAL VEIN**

The femoral vein is considered the least desirable site for central venous access, although the unfavorable reputation is mostly undeserved (see later).

## **Anatomy**

The femoral vein is a continuation of the long saphenous vein in the groin, and is the main conduit for venous drainage of the legs. It is located in the femoral triangle along with the femoral artery and nerve, as shown in [Figure](#page-9-0) 2.4. The superior border of the femoral triangle is formed by the inguinal ligament, which runs from the anterior superior iliac spine to the pubic symphysis, just beneath the inguinal crease on the skin. At the level of the inguinal ligament (crease), the femoral vein lies just medial to the femoral artery, and is only a few centimeters from the skin. The vein is easier to locate and cannulate when the leg is placed in abduction.

## **Cannulation Techniques**

Real-time ultrasound is recommended for femoral vein cannulation (21), although there is little evidence of benefit with ultrasound at this site (29).

## *Positioning*

Elevation of the upper body to 15° above horizontal (the "reverse" Trendelenburg position) can increase the cross-sectional area of the femoral vein by about 50% (30), so mild upper body elevation should be advantageous, especially for the landmark approach. Placing the leg in abduction is also recommended to facilitate the cannulation procedure.

<span id="page-9-0"></span>![](_page_9_Picture_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 2.4** Anatomy of the femoral triangle.

## *Ultrasound Guidance*

Ultrasound visualization of the femoral artery and vein is possible by placing the ultrasound probe over the femoral artery pulse, which is typically located just below and medial to the midpoint of the inguinal crease. A short-axis view of the femoral artery and femoral vein in this location is shown in Figure 1.8. Note that the vein lies a little deeper than the artery.

#### *Landmark Method*

To cannulate the femoral vein without ultrasound imaging, begin by locating the femoral artery pulse just below the inguinal crease. Then insert the probe needle (with the bevel at 12 o'clock) 1–2 cm medial to the pulse, and the vein should be entered at a depth of 2 to 4 cm from the skin. If the femoral artery pulse is not palpable, draw an imaginary line from the anterior superior iliac crest to the pubic tubercle, and divide the line into three equal segments. The femoral artery should be just underneath the junction between the middle and medial segments, and the femoral vein should be 1–2 cm medial to this point. This approach has a reported success rate of >90% (31).

## **Complications**

The principal concerns at the femoral site are thrombosis and septicemia, which are considered enough of a risk to discourage femoral vein cannulation (as indicated in [Table](#page-1-0) 2.1). However, study results like those in [Table](#page-5-0) 2.2 (15) are not as foreboding as advertised. These results (from a multicenter study that included 2,532 central venous catheters) show a remarkably low rate of

infectious and thrombotic complications at all sites. The risk of catheter-related septicemia at the femoral site was actually lower than the risk at the internal jugular vein site (the favored site for central venous access). The femoral site did have the highest risk of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but the overall risk was minor (1.5%). Results like these are supported by other studies (32), and they demonstrate the safety of the femoral vein site for central venous access.

## **IMMEDIATE CONCERNS**

## **Venous Air Embolism**

Air entry into the venous circulation is an uncommon but potentially lethal complication of central venous cannulation (33).

## *Pathophysiology*

Pressure gradients that favor the movement of air into the venous circulation are created by the negative intrathoracic pressure generated during spontaneous breathing. A pressure gradient of only 5 mm Hg across a 14 gauge catheter (internal diameter = 1.8 mm) can entrain air at a rate of 100 mL per second, and this is enough to produce a fatal venous air embolism (34).

The impact of air entry into the venous circulation is determined by the volume of air and the rate of entry. The outcome can be fatal when air entry reaches 200–300 mL (3–5 mL/kg) over a few seconds (34). Entrained air can produce an air lock in the right ventricle, leading to acute right heart failure and cardiogenic shock, while air reaching the pulmonary circulation can produce leaky-capillary pulmonary edema (33,34). Finally, air can pass through a patent foramen ovale and produce an acute embolic stroke.

#### *Prevention*

The standard preventive measure for air embolism is the head-down body tilt (the Trendelenburg position) to increase venous pressure during cannulation of the internal jugular and subclavian veins. Elevation of the upper body (the reverse Trendelenburg position) is not necessary as a preventive measure during femoral vein cannulation because femoral vein catheters do not enter the thorax and thus are not exposed to negative pressures.

#### *Clinical Presentation*

Venous air entry can be clinically silent (33). In symptomatic cases. the earliest manifestation is sudden onset of dyspnea, which may be accompanied by a distressing cough. This can progress rapidly to acute respiratory failure and circulatory shock. In the most advanced cases, the mixing of air and blood in the right ventricle can produce a splashing auscultatory sound called a 'mill wheel' murmur (35).

Venous air embolism is usually a clinical diagnosis. Transesophageal echocardiography is considered the most sensitive method of detecting air in the right heart (capable of detecting as little as 0.02 mL/kg) (33), but this procedure is often not readily available. Precordial Doppler ultrasound can be useful (air in the cardiac chambers produces a high-pitched sound), but the Doppler signal can lack specificity (33).

### *Management*

The following measures are recommended for the management of venous air embolism (33,34), although their efficacy is unproven.

- 1. If air entrainment is suspected through an indwelling catheter, attach a syringe to the catheter and attempt to aspirate air from the bloodstream.
- 2. Place the patient on 100% oxygen (to promote the movement of nitrogen out of the air bubbles in the bloodstream, and thereby decrease the volume of entrained air.
- 3. Place the patient in the left lateral decubitus position (to move an air pocket that is blocking the outflow of the right ventricle).
- 4. For patients with cardiovascular collapse, consider extracorporeal support.

## **Pneumothorax**

Pneumothorax is a feared but infrequent complication of central venous access, and most cases are associated with subclavian vein cannulation (where the incidence is 1% using ultrasound and 4% otherwise) (27). The detection of post-procedure pneumothoraces can be problematic, as explained next.

## *Portable Chest Radiography*

The portable chest x-ray has been the standard method for detecting pneumothorax after central venous cannulation, but clinical studies have shown that *portable chest x-rays fail to detect as many as 50% of pneumothoraces in critically ill patients* (36,37). This lack of sensitivity is attributed to the supine position (which is the position of most patients in the ICU during portable chest radiography), because pleural air does not collect at the apex of the lungs in the supine position, but instead collects in the anterior region of the pleural cavity (which can be close to the base of the lung) (38,39). Pleural air in this location will be in front of the lungs, and can be missed on a portable chest x-ray because of the lung markings behind the pleural air. An example of an anterior pneumothorax that is not apparent on a supine chest x-ray is shown in [Figure](#page-12-0) 2.5.

<span id="page-12-0"></span>![](_page_12_Picture_0.jpeg)

**FIGURE 2.5** Portable chest x-ray and CT image of the chest in a young male with blunt chest trauma. The chest film is unrevealing, while the CT image shows an anterior pneumothorax (indicated by the asterisk).

#### *Ultrasound*

The pleura can be visualized on ultrasound imaging using a high-frequency, linear array probe (the same probe used for vascular ultrasound) that is placed across the intercostal spaces. The normal movement of the pleural surfaces creates a shimmering effect on the pleural image that is known as "lung sliding" (40). The absence of lung sliding then suggests the presence of a pneumothorax. Other conditions (e.g., blebs, pleurodesis) can be accompanied by the absence of lung sliding, so this sign is not pathognomonic of pneumothorax.

Several clinical studies have shown that ultrasound has a higher sensitivity than portable chest x-rays for the detection of pneumothoraces (36,37), including those associated with central venous cannulation (41). As a result, ultrasound has been recommended as a replacement for

<span id="page-13-0"></span>chest radiography after central venous cannulation.

**FIGURE 2.6** Portable chest x-ray showing the proper placement of a central venous catheter. Note that the tip of the catheter is at the level of the carina (i.e., the tracheal bifurcation, highlighted by the dotted lines), which lies just above the junction between the superior vena cava and right atrium. Image digitally enhanced

## **Catheter Position**

Catheters inserted via the internal jugular and subclavian veins should be in the superior vena cava, with the tip 1–2 cm above the right atrium. Misplacement of catheters is reported in 15– 18% of cannulations (41), mostly those involving the subclavian vein.

## *Chest Radiography*

The standard practice is to evaluate catheter placement with a portable chest x-ray, and the one in [Figure](#page-13-0) 2.6 shows a catheter that is appropriately placed. Note that the catheter follows a straight course down the mediastinum, and the tip of the catheter is just above the carina (i.e., the tracheal bifurcation). The carina is located just above the junction between the superior vena cava and the right atrium, so a catheter tip that is at the level of the carina, or slightly above it, is in the appropriate position. The carina is thus a useful landmark for evaluating catheter position (42).

#### *Ultrasound*

Ultrasound has been recommended as a replacement for chest radiography to evaluate catheter

placement. There are two aspects of the ultrasound examination. The first pertains to subclavian vein catheters, and involves imaging the internal jugular vein on both sides to identify cephalad misplacement of the catheter (which must be corrected). This can be done during the catheterization procedure to save time in repositioning the catheter.

The second aspect of the ultrasound exam uses a phased array transducer in the subcostal window to visualize the catheter in the right atrium. If the catheter is not in the right atrium, then a "bubble study" is performed. This involves the rapid injection of 10 ml of saline through the distal port of the catheter, and observing for the appearance of microbubbles in the right atrium. A positive test confirms that the catheter is in the venous system, while the appearance of the bubbles within 2 seconds of injection is evidence that the catheter tip is in the superior vena cava (43).

## *Catheter Tip in Right Atrium*

Catheters that have been advanced into the right atrium have traditionally been repositioned because of the perceived risk of right atrial perforation and cardiac tamponade. However, this practice is being questioned because of the rarity of this complication (44). In one study that included 2,348 patients with a catheter tip that remained in the right atrium, there were no cases of cardiac perforation or troublesome cardiac arrythmias (45). As a result of studies like this, the practice of repositioning catheters that enter the right atrium is being abandoned.

## **A FINAL WORD**

The following points related to central venous access deserve emphasis.

- 1. The indications for central venous access are shrinking, thanks to the emergence of safer alternatives like midline catheters and peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs).
- 2. The use of real-time ultrasound improves the success rate, and reduces the complication rate, at all sites of central venous access.
- 3. The perception that femoral vein catheters are particularly risky is not supported by clinical studies (see [Table](#page-5-0) 2.2).
- 4. Ultrasound is superior to portable chest radiography for detecting post-insertion pneumothoraces, and is a suitable alternative to chest radiography for evaluating catheter position.
- 5. Catheters that have been advanced into the right atrium pose no great danger of cardiac perforation, and can be left in place.
