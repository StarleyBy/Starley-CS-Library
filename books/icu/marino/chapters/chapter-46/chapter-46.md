# **Disorders of Movement**

*When we contemplate this life, we see motion as its principal characteristic, and when we take a farther view, we see that this motion must necessarily waste the machine in which it resides.*

John Young (*[a](#page-13-0)*)

This chapter describes three movement disorders that you are likely to encounter in the ICU: (*a*) involuntary movements (i.e., seizures), (*b*) weak or ineffective movements (i.e., neuromuscular weakness), and (*c*) no movements (i.e., drug-induced paralysis). These conditions are aberrations of the motion described by John Young in the introductory quote, but they retain the ability to "waste" the human machine.

### **SEIZURES**

The risk of seizures in critically ill patients is determined primarily by the presence and type of brain injury, rather than the general condition of the patient (e.g., severity of shock). The conditions that typically produce new-onset seizures are listed in Table 46.1, along with the reported frequency of seizures [\(1](#page-13-1)[–3](#page-13-2)). Also included in Table 46.1 is the frequency of troublesome seizures that either persist or recur before the patient recovers from the prior one. This condition is known as *status epilepticus*, and it is the principal focus of this section.

| TABLE<br>46.1<br>Reported | Occurrence<br>Rates<br>of<br>Seizures |                    |  |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------|--|
| Condition                 | Seizures                              | Status Epilepticus |  |

### **Types of Seizures**

Seizures are classified by the presence or absence of abnormal movements (convulsive versus nonconvulsive seizures), the type of abnormal movement (e.g., tonic–clonic, myoclonic), and the extent of involvement (generalized versus focal seizures).

#### *Abnormal Movements*

The movements associated with seizures can be *tonic* (caused by sustained muscle contraction), *clonic* (rhythmic movements with a regular amplitude and frequency) or *myoclonic* (irregular, jerky movements that vary in amplitude and frequency). The abnormal movements can also be familiar but repetitive (e.g., chewing or lip smacking); these are called *automatisms*. Of interest, myoclonus is not universally regarded as a seizure because it is not associated with rhythmic discharges on the EEG ([4\)](#page-13-3).

#### *Generalized vs. Focal Seizures*

Generalized seizures arise from synchronous, rhythmic electrical discharges that involve most of the cerebral cortex, and they are always associated with loss of consciousness. However, they are not always associated with abnormal (convulsive) movements. Focal seizures arise from discrete areas of the brain, and may or may not be accompanied by loss of consciousness. However, focal seizures often progress to generalized seizures [\(1](#page-13-1)).

#### *Partial Complex Seizures*

Partial complex seizures are nonconvulsive seizures that produce behavioral changes. The typical manifestation is a patient who is awake but not aware of the surroundings (similar to absence seizures). These are often preceded by an *aura* (e.g., a particular smell), and can be accompanied by automatisms.

### **Status Epilepticus**

Status epilepticus (SE) in adults is traditionally defined as *≥5 minutes of continuous seizure activity, or two or more discrete seizures without an intervening period of consciousness* ([5\)](#page-13-4). There are about 20 different types of SE ([5\)](#page-13-4), but the ones most likely to be seen in the ICU are (*a*) generalized convulsive and nonconvulsive SE, (*b*) myoclonic SE, and (*c*) focal motor SE (with and without loss of consciousness). Nonconvulsive SE is of particular interest as a source of impaired consciousness.

Frequency of occurrence in parentheses. From Reference 6.

#### *Nonconvulsive SE*

Nonconvulsive SE is an elusive diagnosis because the clinical manifestations are varied and atypical for seizures. This is demonstrated in [Table](#page-1-0) 46.2, which shows the clinical manifestations in 105 reported cases of nonconvulsive SE ([6\)](#page-13-5). Impaired consciousness (i.e., confusion, coma, or lethargy) was the most common manifestation, and was present in about 80% of cases. The remaining manifestations included speech disturbances, bizarre behavior, agitation, delirium, and hallucinations.

The importance of nonconvulsive seizures as a cause of impaired consciousness is demonstrated by the following observations:

- 1. In ICU patients with impaired consciousness, nonconvulsive seizures have been detected in 16% of the patients when continuous EEG monitoring is used (usually for 1–2 days) ([7\)](#page-13-6), and in 4–8% of the patients when intermittent EEG recordings are used [\(7](#page-13-6)[,8](#page-13-7)).
- 2. Nonconvulsive seizures have been detected in 37% of the EEGs obtained for the evaluation of impaired consciousness [\(9](#page-13-8)).

Observations like these emphasize the need to consider nonconvulsive seizures in any ICU patient with impaired consciousness, and to use continuous EEG monitoring when available.

#### *Treatment*

The pharmacotherapy of SE is divided into three steps, and the drugs involved in each of these steps are presented in Tables 46.3 and 46.4. Seizures that continue uninterrupted for longer than 30 minutes can result in permanent neuronal injury [\(5](#page-13-4)), emphasizing the need for prompt suppression of SE. *Note:* The treatment of SE presented here is primarily intended for generalized convulsive SE [\(10](#page-13-9)), but it is also used (with less success) for nonconvulsive SE.

#### *Step 1: Benzodiazepines*

Benzodiazepines are the first-line drugs of choice for the rapid termination of generalized SE ([10\)](#page-13-9). *Intravenous lorazepam is the preferred agent* ([10,](#page-13-9)[11\)](#page-13-10), *and intramuscular midazolam is effective when IV access is problematic* ([12\)](#page-13-11). Intravenous diazepam is also effective, but is not favored because of rapid washout from the brain, which increases the risk of seizure recurrence ([1\)](#page-13-1).

**LORAZEPAM:** Intravenous lorazepam can terminate generalized convulsive SE in about two minutes, and the effect lasts for 6–12 hours [\(11](#page-13-10)). The recommended dosage is 0.05–0.1 mg/kg (or 4 mg) IV over 2 minutes, which can be repeated once if needed.

**MIDAZOLAM:** Midazolam can be given by IV or intramuscular (IM) injection, and the

recommended dose is 0.15 mg/kg, or 10 mg ([10\)](#page-13-9). IM midazolam is as effective as IV lorazepam ([12\)](#page-13-11), and the IM route is advantageous when IV access is problematic (e.g., in the prehospital setting).

#### *Step 2: Anticonvulsants*

About one-third of cases of generalized SE do not respond to benzodiazepines [\(13](#page-13-12)), and the next step is the administration of a nonsedating anticonvulsant: i.e., levetiracetam, fosphenytoin, or valproic acid. All are equivalent in terminating SE (which occurs in about half of the cases) ([14\)](#page-13-13), but *levetiracetam is often favored because it has fewer side effects.*

**LEVETIRACETAM (KEPPRA®):** The recommended dose of levetiracetam in generalized SE is 60 mg/kg IV, infused over 5–15 minutes, with a maximum single dose of 4,500 mg ([10\)](#page-13-9). If necessary, the drug can be continued at a dose of 1,000 mg IV every 12 hours, and serum drug levels can be used to adjust dosage. There is no risk of hypotension or respiratory depression, and no drug interactions.

**FOSPHENYTOIN:** Fosphenytoin is a water-soluble prodrug that produces less cardiac depression and hypotension than phenytoin because it does not contain the solvent propylene glycol. (See Chapter 6 for a description of propylene glycol toxicity.) As a result, fosphenytoin can be infused three times faster than phenytoin (at 150 mg/min) ([15\)](#page-13-14). The dosing is the same as phenytoin, but is expressed as phenytoin equivalents (PE), as shown in [Table](#page-3-0) 46.3. If the drug is effective, maintenance therapy is started at 100 mg PE IV every 8 hours, and serum levels are monitored to guide dosing.

The parent drug, phenytoin, has several undesirable features, including CNS toxicity (lethargy, confusion, ataxia) and multiple drug interactions (due to its metabolism by the cytochrome P450 system in the liver). The conversion of fosphenytoin to phenytoin is increased in liver failure, and careful monitoring of serum phenytoin levels is advised in patients with hepatic insufficiency.

Drug dosing from the guidelines in Reference 10. PE = phenytoin equivalents.

**VALPROIC ACID:** Valproic acid is equivalent to the other anticonvulsants for terminating SE ([14\)](#page-13-13) (see [Table](#page-3-0) 46.3 for the recommended dose), and has relatively few side effects [\(16](#page-13-15)). However, it is far less popular than the other anticonvulsants (author's observation). One side effect that has gained some attention is a 40% risk of hyperammonemia [\(17](#page-13-16)), which can produce an encephalopathy.

#### *Step 3: Refractory Status Epilepticus*

About 10–15% of cases of generalized SE are refractory to step 1 and 2 drugs, and the treatment for these cases is anesthetic doses of one of the drugs in [Table](#page-4-0) 46.4. There is no evidence that one drug regimen is superior to the others, and selection is often based on familiarity. Patients should be intubated and on mechanical ventilation prior to starting these drugs, as they all depress ventilation in the recommended doses. Continuous EEG monitoring is also advised, and at this point, consultation with a critical care neurologist or epileptologist is the best option. (*Note:* Drugs other than those in [Table](#page-4-0) 46.4 can be used for refractory SE, including thiopental, phenobarbital, and ketamine. The dosing regimens for these drugs are available in Reference 1.)

### **Outcomes**

The in-hospital mortality rates are as high as 21% for generalized convulsive SE, about 50% for generalized nonconvulsive SE, and as high as 61% for refractory SE [\(7](#page-13-6)).

### **NEUROMUSCULAR WEAKNESS SYNDROMES**

The following is a description of neuromuscular weakness syndromes that you may encounter in the ICU.

#### **Myasthenia Gravis**

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease produced by antibody-mediated destruction of acetylcholine receptors on the postsynaptic side of neuromuscular junctions ([18\)](#page-13-17). Skeletal muscles are the only target of this illness.

#### *Predisposing Conditions*

MG can be triggered by major surgery or a concurrent illness. Thymomas are responsible for 10% of cases of MG ([18\)](#page-13-17). MG can also be aggravated by major surgery, physiological stress, and drugs that can impair neuromuscular transmission. The drugs that can aggravate MG are listed in [Table](#page-5-0) 46.5. These drugs should not be used in patients with MG. However, note that high-dose corticosteroids are listed as aggravating MG, which is concerning because high-dose steroids are used to *treat* MG. (For more on this, see Reference 20.)

#### <span id="page-5-0"></span>**TABLE 46.5 Drugs that can Exacerbate Myasthenia Gravis**

- 1. *Antibiotics:* aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, penicillins
- 2. *Cardiovascular Drugs:* β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, class Ia antiarrhythmics (procainamide, quinidine, disopyramide)
- 3. *Neuromuscular Blockers:* both depolarizing and non-depolarizing agents
- 4. *Others:* high-dose steroids\*, inhalational anesthetics, magnesium, lithium

#### *Clinical Features*

Skeletal muscle weakness is the sole manifestation of MG, and the weakness has the following characteristics:

- 1. The eye muscles (i.e., eyelid and oculomotor muscles) are always involved, and the earliest signs of MG are diplopia and ptosis. Symmetrical limb weakness usually follows, but in 15% of cases, the weakness is confined to the eye muscles ([18\)](#page-13-17).
- 2. The muscle weakness typically worsens with muscle activity, and improves with rest.
- 3. The deficit is purely motor, and deep tendon reflexes are preserved.
- 4. Progressive disease leads to weakness of the diaphragm and chest wall muscles, and rapid progression to respiratory failure, called *myasthenic crisis*, occurs in 15–20% of patients ([21\)](#page-13-18).

#### *Diagnosis*

The diagnosis of MG is suggested by the pattern of muscle weakness, with ptosis as a dominant feature. Confirmatory diagnostic tests include the ice test, and serum antibody levels.

**ICE TEST:** The ice test is based on the premise that cooling can improve neuromuscular transmission in MG. The test is performed on an eyelid with ptosis, and the distance between the upper and lower eyelids (the edges of the palpebral fissure) is measured. An ice pack (or plastic glove filled with ice) is then placed on the eyelid (with the eyes closed) for 2 minutes. An increase of 2 mm in the distance between the upper and lower eyelids is a positive test, and helps

<sup>\*</sup>High-dose steroids are also used to treat myasthenia gravis. The list of drugs is from References 19 and 20.

confirm the diagnosis of MG. This is illustrated in [Figure](#page-6-0) 46.1. A positive ice test has a sensitivity and specificity of 80% for the diagnosis of MG ([22\)](#page-13-19).

**AUTOANTIBODY ASSAYS:** The presence of acetylcholine (Ach) receptor antibodies in the serum confirms the diagnosis of MG. About 10–15% of patients with MG will not have Ach antibodies in the blood ([18\)](#page-13-17), and for these cases, a muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) antibody should be assayed. This antibody is present in about 40% of MG patients who have no detectable Ach antibodies [\(23](#page-13-20)).

#### *Management in the ICU*

Most cases of MG that are severe enough to warrant ICU-level care have respiratory muscle weakness, with some degree of respiratory insufficiency. The principal concern in these patients is determining when intubation is necessary.

<span id="page-6-0"></span>![](_page_6_Picture_4.jpeg)

**FIGURE 46.1** Illustration of a positive ice test for the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. An icepack is applied to the eyelid with ptosis for 2 minutes, and this results in an increase in the distance between the upper and lower eyelids.

**INTUBATION:** The deterioration in ventilatory status can be very rapid in MG, so intubation should not be delayed until the patient is *in extremis*. Measurements of vital capacity and maximum inspiratory pressure (i.e., the negative pressure generated by a maximum inspiratory effort against a closed valve) can be used to guide decisions about intubation. *A vital capacity of ≤15 mL/kg (or <1 liter), and a maximum inspiratory pressure of –20 cm H2O (normal being >–100 cm H2O) should prompt serious consideration of intubation and mechanical ventilation* ([21\)](#page-13-18). Noninvasive ventilation with BIPAP (described in Chapter 26) should only be considered if an improvement in respiratory status is expected in the next few days (which is usually not the case).

**TREATMENT FOR MYASTHENIC CRISIS:** There are two options for treating severe MG with

respiratory failure (i.e., myasthenic crisis) ([21\)](#page-13-18):

- 1. *Intravenous immunoglobulin,* or IVIG, (to neutralize the pathologic antibodies) in a dose of 2 grams per kilogram body weight, administered over 2–5 days.
- 2. *Plasmapheresis* (to remove the pathologic antibodies from the bloodstream), which typically involves 5 sessions over 7–10 days, with each session exchanging 1.0 to 1.5 plasma volumes.

Both treatments are equally effective, and will produce a favorable response in about 70% of patients [\(21](#page-13-18)). However, plasmapheresis is favored because it produces a faster response: i.e., the response to IVIG is not evident for 4–5 days, while the response to plasmapheresis may be apparent after the second session ([21\)](#page-13-18).

**PYRIDOSTIGMINE:** Pyridostigmine (Mestinon®) is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that is typically given to patients with mild-to-moderate MG [\(24](#page-13-21)[,25](#page-13-22)). However, the drug is not used when MG progresses to respiratory failure, because one of the side effects is to increase respiratory secretions (cholinergic effect).

**CORTICOSTEROIDS:** High-dose methylprednisolone (2 grams daily for two days) has been used to treat myasthenic crisis, with some evidence of success [\(26](#page-13-23)). However, this treatment is debated because of reports that high-dose corticosteroids can also aggravate MG, as mentioned earlier. It certainly seems wise to withhold this treatment in patients who are responding satisfactorily to IVIG or plasmapheresis.

#### **OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:**

- 1. Prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism (e.g., enoxaparin 40 mg daily) is considered particularly important in diseases with neuromuscular weakness, because of limited mobility.
- 2. Patients with bulbar weakness can also have difficulty swallowing, which creates a risk of aspiration of saliva into the airways. Patients who are not intubated should therefore have a swallowing evaluation to assess the risk of aspiration.
- 3. Patient's with new-onset MG should have a contrast-enhanced CT of the chest to search for a thymoma. If one is present, a thymectomy may be appropriate to reduce the need for immunotherapy. This decision, and the use of immunotherapy for long-term management of MG, will be the purview of a neurologist.

#### *Outcomes*

About 95% of patients who are hospitalized with MG will survive the hospitalization [\(21](#page-13-18)), but few will recover completely ([18\)](#page-13-17).

### **Guillain–Barré Syndrome**

The Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) is an *inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy* that often follows an acute infectious illness (by 1 to 3 weeks). Infectious organisms that predispose to GBS include *Campylobacter jejuni*, Zika virus, and SARS coronavirus-2 [\(27](#page-13-24)). An immune mechanism is suspected, and *molecular mimicry* has been implicated [\(27](#page-13-24)). (*Note:* In molecular

mimicry, antibodies to a component of pathogens cross-react with a component of peripheral nerves.)

#### *Clinical Features*

The clinical presentation of GBS is characterized by paresthesias and symmetrical limb weakness (upper and lower limbs) that progresses over a few days to a few weeks. Progression to respiratory failure occurs in 25% of cases (28), and autonomic instability is a feature in advanced cases (29). The condition resolves spontaneously in about 80% of cases, but residual neurological deficits are common (28).

The features that distinguish GBS from myasthenia gravis are shown in [Table](#page-8-0) 46.6. There is no oculomotor weakness in GBS, although there is a GBS variant known as the *Miller Fisher syndrome* that presents with ophthalmoplegia and ataxia (30). Another characteristic feature of GBS is the deep tendon reflexes, which are diminished or absent.

#### *Diagnosis*

The diagnosis of GBS is based on the clinical presentation (symmetrical limb weakness presenting within a few weeks of an infection), and nerve conduction studies that show a decrease in nerve conduction velocity. Lumbar puncture is often performed to rule out other conditions, and the cerebrospinal fluid shows elevated protein levels in patients with GBS (31).

#### *Treatment*

Patients with GBS who require ICU-level care are managed in a very similar fashion to the management described for myasthenia gravis.

- 1. Respiratory deterioration can be rapid, and monitoring the vital capacity and negative inspiratory pressure can help in timely intubation, before the patient is *in extremis*.
- 2. Patients who are unable to walk unaided, or have respiratory failure, should be treated with *intravenous immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis* (31), using the same regimens described earlier for myasthenia gravis. Both treatments are considered equivalent, and no preference is given in the most recent guidelines on GBS (31).

**PAIN:** Pain can be prominent in the acute and resolving stages of GBS, and is considered to be neuropathic rather than nociceptive pain. The recommendation from the guidelines on GBS is *gabapentin* (Neurontin®) in a dose of 300 mg three times daily (31). However, opioids should also be considered for more immediate pain relief, since they can be effective for relieving neuropathic pain (32).

#### *Outcomes*

In the United States, about 97% of patients who are hospitalized for GBS will survive the hospital stay (33), but 10–15% of these patients will be severely disabled (34).

### **Critical Illness Neuromyopathy**

The disorders known as *critical illness polyneuropathy* (CIP) and *critical illness myopathy* (CIM) are secondary disorders, and typically occur in patients with severe systemic inflammatory diseases (35–37). These disorders often co-exist in the same patient, and become apparent when patients fail to wean from mechanical ventilation.

#### *Pathogenesis*

- 1. CIP is a diffuse sensory and motor axonal neuropathy that is particularly prevalent in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock (37). It affects both limb and truncal muscles, and is considered the most common peripheral neuropathy in critically ill patients (38).
- 2. CIM is a diffuse inflammatory myopathy that involves both limb and truncal muscles (39). Predisposing conditions include severe sepsis and septic shock, immobility (e.g., by neuromuscular paralysis), and hyperglycemia (36,37). An acute myopathy that resembles CIM has also been reported in ventilator-dependent asthmatic patients who were paralyzed and treated with high dose steroids (40).

*The common denominator in both CIP and CIM is severe or progressive systemic inflammation* (36,37), so both conditions could represent inflammatory organ injury. This would then add to the spectrum of inflammatory organ injury described in critically ill patients (see Table 17.1). This topic is revisited in the very last section of the chapter (A FINAL WORD).

#### *Clinical Features*

Both CIP and CIM produce a flaccid paralysis in limb and truncal muscles, associated with hyporeflexia or areflexia (36). However as just mentioned, these conditions often go undetected until there is an unexplained failure to remove a patient from mechanical ventilation.

- 1. The diagnosis of CIP is secured by nerve conduction studies, which show slowed conduction in sensory and motor fibers (41).
- 2. The diagnosis of CIM can be confirmed by electromyography (which shows myopathic change) and by muscle biopsy (which shows loss of myosin filaments, and inflammatory infiltration) (39).

#### *Management*

There is no treatment for CIP or CIM. Several measures have been proposed to reduce the risk of

these disorders (e.g., early ambulation, improved nutrition), but none have been validated (and none are directed at the inflammatory nature of the disorders).

#### *Outcomes*

These conditions can be devastating in ventilator-dependent patients, because they prevent weaning from ventilatory support. Complete recovery is expected in about half the patients (41), but it can takes months to recover.

### **DRUG-INDUCED PARALYSIS**

Neuromuscular blocking agents produce a flaccid paralysis that is used in the following situations: (*a*) to facilitate endotracheal intubation, (*b*) to prevent shivering during induced hypothermia, and (*c*) to promote synchronous mechanical ventilation in patients who are severely agitated (42).

These agents act by binding to acetylcholine (Ach) receptors on the postsynaptic side of neuromuscular junctions. Once bound, there are two different modes of action: (*a*) *depolarizing agents* produce a sustained depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane, and (*b*) *nondepolarizing agents* act by competitive inhibition of Ach binding to the postsynaptic receptors. Both actions effectively block the transmission of electrical impulses from nerve to muscle.

### **Commonly Used Agents**

The comparative features of three commonly used neuromuscular blocking agents are shown in [Table](#page-10-0) 46.7 (43). *Note:* Many experts recommend that ideal body weight be used for dosing of neuromuscular blockers (42).

<sup>†</sup>Contraindications to succinylcholine include hyperkalemia, malignant hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, burns, and immobility from spinal chord injury.

Properties of the neuromuscular blockers from Reference 43.

### *Succinylcholine*

Succinylcholine is the only depolarizing agent available, and has both a rapid onset of action (60–90 seconds) and a rapid recovery time (7–12 minutes). Because of these features, succinylcholine is popular for rapid-sequence endotracheal intubation.

**SIDE EFFECTS:** Succinylcholine-induced depolarization of skeletal muscle promotes the efflux of K+ from muscle cells. This can be associated with up to a 0.5 mEq/L rise in the serum K+ (44), but this effect is without consequence if the baseline serum K+ is not elevated. However, lifethreatening hyperkalemia can occur when succinylcholine is given to patients with hyperkalemia, or to patients with malignant hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, burns, or immobility from spinal cord injury. As a result, succinylcholine is contraindicated in these conditions.

#### *Rocuronium*

Rocuronium is a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker with a rapid onset of action (1.5–3 minutes) and an "intermediate" duration of clinical effect (30–70 min). It has no cardiovascular side effects, and has gradually replaced vecuronium, a related drug with a more delayed onset of action. Rocuronium has a prolonged effect in patients with hepatic dysfunction (43), but the extent of the prolongation has not been adequately studied.

**INTUBATION:** Because of the rapid onset of action, rocuronium can be used for endotracheal intubation when succinylcholine is contraindicated. At a dose of 1.0 mg/kg, rocuronium has a rapid onset that is equivalent to a 1.0 mg/kg dose of succinylcholine (45). The only concern with rocuronium is the prolonged duration of effect (about one hour), which can be problematic if the airway is not secured in a timely fashion. In this situation, rapid reversal of rocuronium with sugammadex (16 mg/kg) is advised. (See later for reversal agents.)

#### *Cisatracurium*

Cisatracurium is a non-depolarizing agent with a prolonged onset of action (5–7 min) and an intermediate duration of effect (35–50 min). Unlike a related agent (atracurium), cisatracurium does not cause histamine release, and it has no cardiovascular side effects (43). Blood levels of cisatracurium are not influenced by renal or liver failure, which makes it an appealing neuromuscular blocker for ICU patients.

### **Monitoring**

The standard method of monitoring drug-induced paralysis is to apply a series of four lowfrequency (2 Hz) electrical pulses to the ulnar nerve at the forearm, and observe for adduction of the thumb. Total absence of thumb adduction is evidence of excessive block. The desired goal is 1 or 2 perceptible twitches, and the drug infusion is adjusted to achieve that end-point (30).

### **Reversal Agents**

There are two agents that can reverse neuromuscular blockade: *neostigmine* and *sugammadex*.

#### *Neostigmine*

Neostigmine blocks the breakdown of Ach (by inhibiting the acetylcholinesterase enzyme), and the subsequent increase in Ach is enough to overcome the competitive blockade by the

nondepolarizing agents. (There are two other "anticholinesterases", edrophonium and pyridostigmine, but neither is used as a reversal agent.)

**DOSAGE:** The dose of neostigmine needed to reverse neuromuscular paralysis is dependent on several factors, including the neuromuscular blocker, the depth of paralysis, and the anesthetic agent that is used. An intravenous neostigmine dose of 70 μg/kg can reverse a moderate level of paralysis, but the recovery time can vary from 8 to 45 minutes, depending on the other factors just mentioned (43). The dose of neostigmine should never exceed 70 μg/kg because of the risk of parasympathomimetic side effects (43).

#### *Sugammadex*

Sugammadex is a reversal agent that binds directly to the aminosteroid class of neuromuscular blockers (i.e., rocuronium, vecuronium, and pancuronium). It binds most tightly to rocuronium, but is equally effective for vecuronium. (The binding to pancuronium is far less extensive.)

**DOSAGE:** The dose of sugammadex depends on the depth of paralysis. To reverse rocuronium within minutes after it is administered (i.e., after an intubation), the sugammadex dose is 16 mg/kg, and the reversal time is only 2–3 minutes (which is less than the recovery time for succinylcholine) (43). With deep paralysis, the dose of sugammadex is 4 mg/kg; with moderate paralysis, the dose is 2 mg/kg, and the time for reversal is always 2–3 minutes (43). *The reversal with sugammadex is much faster than with neostigmine, and there are no cholinergic side effects*.

### **A Plea to Avoid Prolonged Paralysis**

The experience of being awake while paralyzed is both horrifying and painful (46), and it is imperative to use heavy sedation, and at least some analgesia, while patients are paralyzed. However, it is not possible to evaluate the adequacy of sedation or pain control while a patient is paralyzed without continuous EEG monitoring (which is often not available for this purpose). The inability to ensure adequate sedation and pain control is a major reason to avoid prolonged periods of neuromuscular paralysis whenever possible. This will also reduce the risk of the following complications: (*a*) critical illness myopathy, (*b*) "hypostatic" pneumonia (from pooling of respiratory secretions in dependent lung regions), (*c*) venous thromboembolism, and (*d*) pressure ulcers on the skin.

## **A FINAL WORD**

### **Inflammation Strikes Again**

One of the central themes in this book is the harm inflicted by severe or progressive systemic inflammation in critically ill patients. Inflammatory injury is responsible for the acute respiratory distress syndrome (see Chapter 24) and for many cases of acute kidney injury (see Chapter 34), and inflammation has a pivotal role in the multiorgan failure associated with septic shock (see Chapter 17) and with the post-cardiac arrest period (see Chapter 21). This chapter adds to this list by revealing that inflammation can damage peripheral nerves (i.e., critical illness polyneuropathy) and skeletal muscle (i.e., critical illness myopathy). Considering the swath of

damage that can be inflicted by inflammation, it seems apparent that inflammation is the most lethal force that you (and the patients) will face in the ICU.
