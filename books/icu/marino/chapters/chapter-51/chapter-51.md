# **Adrenal and Thyroid Dysfunction**

*Judge a tree from its fruit, not from the leaves.*

Euripides

(484–406 BC)

Adrenal and thyroid disorders are rarely the primary reason for admission to an ICU. However, critical illness can influence adrenal and thyroid function, and there is concern that this influence can have a negative impact on outcomes in critically ill patients. This chapter describes the spectrum of adrenal and thyroid disorders that occur in critically ill patients, and how critical illness influences adrenal and thyroid function.

# **ADRENAL SUPPRESSION IN THE ICU**

The adrenal gland plays a major role in the adaptive response to stress. The adrenal cortex releases glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids that promote glucose availability and maintain extracellular volume, while the adrenal medulla releases catecholamines that support the circulation. Attenuation or loss of this adrenal response leads to hemodynamic instability, volume depletion, and defective energy metabolism ([1,](#page-10-0)[2\)](#page-10-1). Adrenal insufficiency can remain silent until the adrenal gland is called on to respond to a physiologic stress. When this occurs, adrenal insufficiency becomes an occult catalyst that speeds the progression of acute, life threatening conditions.

# **Adrenal Activity**

The activity of the adrenal glands is governed by the release of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary gland, which, in turn, is governed by the production of corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) in the hypothalamus (see [Figure](#page-2-0) 51.1). Adrenal insufficiency can be the result of suppression at the hypothalamic-pituitary level, or primary suppression of adrenal gland activity.

#### *Cortisol*

Cortisol (hydrocortisone) is the major glucocorticoid released by the adrenal cortex. The daily production of cortisol in the normal (unstressed) adult is 15–25 mg/day, and this can increase up to 350 mg/day during periods of maximum physiological stress ([3\)](#page-10-2).

**PLASMA CORTISOL:** About 90% of the cortisol in plasma is bound to corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) and albumin, while the remaining 10% is the free or biologically active form ([3\)](#page-10-2). The commercial assay for plasma cortisol measures both bound and unbound fractions; i.e., total cortisol. This assay can be misleading in acutely ill patients because plasma levels of CBG fall by as much as 50% during an acute illness [\(3](#page-10-2)). Studies of the correlation between free and total cortisol in critically ill patients have shown inconsistent results ([1\)](#page-10-0). However, free cortisol levels are not readily available, so total cortisol levels are recommended for assessing adrenal function ([1\)](#page-10-0).

# **Critically Ill Patients**

Adrenal insufficiency is common in critically ill patients. The overall incidence is 10–20% ([4\)](#page-10-3), but rates as high as 60% have been reported in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock (5). The adrenal suppression in critically ill patients is *often reversible*, and is called *critical illnessrelated corticosteroid insufficiency* (CIRCI) [\(1](#page-10-0)[,3](#page-10-2)). The mechanisms involved in CIRCI are complex, and not fully elucidated; [Figure](#page-2-0) 51.1 shows some of the known mechanisms [\(3](#page-10-2)–6). As indicated, the systemic inflammatory response plays a major role in CIRCI. *Suppression at the hypothalamic-pituitary level* is particularly prominent, and *is responsible for as many as 75% of the cases of adrenal suppression in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock* (5).

#### *Predisposing Conditions*

Severe sepsis and septic shock are the leading causes of adrenal suppression in critically ill patients. Specific infectious causes of adrenal suppression include HIV infection, systemic fungal infections, and meningococcemia (which can result in adrenal hemorrhage) [\(3](#page-10-2),6).

Noninfectious sources of adrenal suppression in ICU patients include: (*a*) abrupt discontinuation of chronic steroid therapy, (*b*) adrenal hemorrhage from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or anticoagulant therapy, and (*c*) drugs that inhibit the synthesis of cortisol (e.g., etomidate and ketoconazole) or accelerate the metabolism of cortisol (e.g., phenytoin or rifampin) [\(3](#page-10-2),6).

## **Clinical Manifestations**

The principal manifestation of adrenal suppression in critically ill patients is *hypotension that is refractory to volume resuscitation* ([3–](#page-10-2)5). The typical electrolyte abnormalities that accompany chronic adrenal insufficiency (i.e., hyponatremia and hyperkalemia), are uncommon in the adrenal suppression associated with critical illness.

# **Diagnosis**

Adrenal suppression should be suspected in any ICU patient with labile blood pressure, or with hypotension of unclear etiology that does not respond to volume resuscitation.

### *Rapid ACTH Stimulation Test*

A popular (but often unnecessary) test of adrenal function in ICU patients is the rapid ACTH stimulation test. This test can be performed at any time of the day or night. A blood sample is obtained for a baseline (random) plasma cortisol level, and the patient is given synthetic ACTH (Cosyntropin) intravenously in a dose of 250 µg. Sixty minutes after the ACTH injection, a second blood sample is obtained for a repeat plasma cortisol level. The interpretation of the test results is described next.

### *Diagnostic Criteria*

Unfortunately, the diagnosis of adrenal suppression in critically ill patients is steeped in uncertainty. The following recommendations represent the current consensus opinion on the subject ([1\)](#page-10-0).

1. The best predictor of adrenal suppression in critically ill patients is a random plasma cortisol level <10 µg/dL, *or* an increment in plasma cortisol of <9 µg/dL after the intravenous injection

of synthetic ACTH (250 µg).

2. In patients with septic shock, plasma cortisol levels are not necessary for identifying patients who might benefit from corticosteroid therapy. In these patients, a trial of intravenous hydrocortisone is recommended when hypotension is refractory to volume resuscitation and moderate doses of a vasopressor agent ([1\)](#page-10-0).

The popular approach is to forego the rapid ACTH stimulation test and rely on the random plasma cortisol level for the diagnosis of adrenal suppression (except in patients with septic shock). A random plasma cortisol level that is ≥35 μg/dL is evidence of normal or adequate adrenal function, while a baseline cortisol level that is below 10 μg/dL is evidence of adrenal suppression. A rapid ACTH stimulation test can be performed when the random serum cortisol level is indeterminate. However, *a normal response to ACTH (i.e., an increment in serum cortisol of ≥9 µg/dL) does not eliminate the possibility of secondary adrenal suppression from hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction* (which may be more common than suspected in ICU patients). A plasma ACTH level is needed for the diagnosis of secondary adrenal insufficiency ([2\)](#page-10-1), but this is rarely performed in the ICU setting (for unclear reasons).

### **Treatment**

The treatment of critical illness-related adrenal suppression is *intravenous hydrocortisone in a dose of 200–300 mg daily* (i.e., 100 mg every 8 hours) [\(4](#page-10-3)). The addition of a mineralocorticoid (i.e., fludrocortisone, 50 µg orally once daily) is considered optional [\(4](#page-10-3)), because hydrocortisone has excellent mineralocorticoid activity (see [Table](#page-4-0) 51.1) (7).

<sup>†</sup>1 = best, 4 = worst. From Reference 7.

Hydrocortisone can be discontinued after satisfactory resolution of the underlying condition. In septic shock, hydrocortisone can be discontinued when vasopressor therapy is no longer necessary, and serum lactate levels have normalized. A gradual taper of the hydrocortisone dose (over at least a few days) is recommended to prevent a rebound increase in proinflammatory mediators [\(4](#page-10-3)).

# **Steroids as Anti-Inflammatory Agents**

Regardless of the presence or absence of CIRCI, corticosteroids are used liberally as antiinflammatory agents in conditions like septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, autoimmune diseases, and severe infections like pneumonias and meningitis. However, the popular steroid for these conditions is methylprednisolone, despite the fact that *dexamethasone is*

*the most potent anti-inflammatory corticosteroid* (see [Table](#page-4-0) 51.1). The reason for this discrepancy is unclear.

# **EVALUATION OF THYROID FUNCTION**

Laboratory tests of thyroid function can be abnormal in up to 90% of critically ill patients (8). In most cases, the abnormality is a consequence of non-thyroidal (systemic) illness, and is not a sign of pathologic thyroid disease (8,9). This section describes the laboratory evaluation of thyroid function, and explains how to identify non-thyroidal illness as a cause of abnormal thyroid function tests.

# **Thyroxine (T4) and Triiodothyronine (T3)**

Thyroxine (T<sup>4</sup> ) is the principal hormone secreted by the thyroid gland, but the active form is triiodothyronine (T<sup>3</sup> ), which is formed by deiodination of thyroxine in extrathyroidal tissues. Both T<sup>3</sup> and T<sup>4</sup> are extensively (>99%) bound to plasma proteins (especially thyroxine-binding globulin), and less than 1% of either hormone is present in the free, or biologically active form (10). Because of the potential for alterations in plasma proteins and protein binding in acute illness, free T<sup>4</sup> and T<sup>3</sup> levels are more reliable for assessing thyroid function in ICU patients. Free T<sup>3</sup> levels are not routinely available, so *free T<sup>4</sup> levels are used to evaluate thyroid function in acutely ill patients*.

# **Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH)**

The plasma level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is considered the most reliable test for the evaluation of thyroid illness, as it can distinguish primary from secondary thyroid disorders, and can also identify nonthyroidal influences on thyroid function. The following general rules apply to the interpretation of thyroid function tests:

- 1. In primary thyroidal illness, the plasma TSH will change in the opposite direction to changes in thyroid hormone levels, and in secondary thyroidal illness (due to aberrations in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis), plasma TSH levels will change in the same direction as changes in thyroid hormone levels.
- 2. For nonthyroidal influences on thyroid function tests, TSH levels are usually in the normal range.

# **Patterns of Abnormal Thyroid Function Tests**

[Table](#page-5-0) 51.2 shows the variety of patterns of free T<sup>4</sup> and TSH levels that can occur with abnormal thyroid function. These patterns will be explained in the following sections on hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism.

<span id="page-5-0"></span>

| TABLE<br>51.2<br>Patterns<br>of | Abnormal<br>Thyroid | Function<br>Tests |
|---------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Condition                       | Free T4             | TSH               |

| Normal Range                | 0.8–1.8 ng/dL | 0.3–4.5 mU/mL |
|-----------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Primary Hyperthyroidism     | ↑             | ↓             |
| T3<br>-Toxicosis            | NL            | ↓             |
| Euthyroid Hyperthyroxinemia | ↑             | NL            |
| Primary Hypothyroidism      | ↓             | ↑             |
| Secondary Hypothyroidism    | ↓             | ↓             |
| Euthyroid Sick              | ↓             | NL            |

NL = normal.

# **THYROTOXICOSIS**

Thyrotoxicosis is almost always the result of primary hyperthyroidism, and the most common cause is autoimmune thyroiditis (Graves disease) (11,12).

# **Clinical Manifestations**

The principal manifestations of thyrotoxicosis include agitation, heat intolerance, tachycardia (including atrial fibrillation), and fine tremors. *Elderly patients with hyperthyroidism can be lethargic* rather than agitated; this condition is called *apathetic thyrotoxicosis*. The combination of lethargy and atrial fibrillation is a frequently cited presentation for apathetic thyrotoxicosis in the elderly (13).

### *Thyroid Storm*

An uncommon but severe form of hyperthyroidism known as *thyroid storm* can be precipitated by acute illness or surgery. This condition is characterized by hyperpyrexia (body temperatures can exceed 104° F), severe agitation or delirium, and severe tachycardia with high output heart failure. Advanced cases are associated with obtundation or coma, generalized seizures, and hemodynamic instability. The mortality rate in this condition is as high as 25%, even with treatment (11).

# **Diagnosis**

The plasma TSH assay is the most sensitive and specific diagnostic test for hyperthyroidism, and is recommended as the initial screening test for suspected hyperthyroidism (11). TSH levels are almost undetectable (<0.01 mU/dL) in most cases of primary hyperthyroidism, and a normal TSH level excludes the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism (11). The free T<sup>4</sup> level is typically elevated in cases of overt hyperthyroidism.

# *T3-Toxicosis*

In mild or subclinical hyperthyroidism, the plasma TSH level is low, but the free T<sup>4</sup> level can be normal. This condition is sometimes called *T<sup>3</sup> -toxicosis*, even though T<sup>3</sup> levels can also be normal (11).

#### **Euthyroid Hyperthyroxinemia**

Drugs that block the conversion of  $T_4$  to  $T_3$ , such as amiodarone (14) and amphetamines (15) can produce a condition called *euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia* where free  $T_4$  levels are elevated, but TSH levels are normal (11). Heparin therapy can also produce this condition by activating lipoprotein lipase, which increases free fatty acids that will displace  $T_4$  from its binding proteins (11).

### **Management**

The drugs used to treat thyrotoxicosis and thyroid storm are presented in Tables 51.3 and 51.4.

### **β-Receptor Antagonists**

Treatment with  $\beta$ -receptor antagonists relieves the tachycardia, agitation, and fine tremors in thyrotoxicosis. *Propranolol* has been the most widely used  $\beta$ -receptor antagonist in hyperthyroidism (see Table 51.3 for the dosing recommendations), and is preferred in thyroid storm because it blocks the conversion of  $T_4$  to  $T_3$  in high doses (11). However, it is a non-selective  $\beta$ -blocker, which makes it less than ideal for patients with asthma or systolic heart failure. More selective  $\beta$ -blockers like *metoprolol* (25–50 mg PO twice or three times daily) can be used for patients with heart failure or a history of asthma. (*Note:* All  $\beta$ -receptor antagonists are contraindicated during acute exacerbations of asthma). Finally, the ultra rapid-acting agent *esmolol* can be given by continuous infusion for rapid control of heart rate.

 $<sup>^{\</sup>dagger}$ All  $^{}$ B-blockers are contraindicated during acute exacerbations of asthma. Dosing regimens from Reference 11.

#### **Antithyroid Drugs**

Two drugs are used to suppress thyroxine production: methimazole and propyl-thiouracil (PTU). Both are given orally. *Methimazole is preferred for the treatment of thyrotoxicosis, while PTU is favored for the treatment of thyroid storm* (11). Uncommon but serious side effects include cholestatic jaundice for methimazole, and fulminant hepatic necrosis plus agranulocytosis for PTU (11). (See Table 51.4 for the dosing regimens for each drug.)

#### **Inorganic Iodine**

In severe cases of hyperthyroidism, iodine (which blocks the synthesis and release of  $T_4$ ) can be added to antithyroid drug therapy. The iodine is given orally as a saturated potassium iodide solution (Lugol's solution). In patients with an iodine allergy, lithium (300 mg orally every 8 hours) can be used as a substitute (16).

### **Additional Measures in Thyroid Storm**

In addition to the above measures, the management of thyroid storm often requires the following measures:

- . Aggressive volume resuscitation is often needed to replace fluid losses from vomiting, diarrhea, and heightened insensible fluid loss.
- . Thyroid storm can accelerate glucocorticoid metabolism and create a relative adrenal insufficiency. Prophylactic therapy with intravenous hydrocortisone (300 mg IV as a loading dose, followed by 100 mg IV every 8 hours) is recommended (1).

Successful management of thyroid storm also requires treatment of the precipitating event.

# **HYPOTHYROIDISM**

Symptomatic hypothyroidism is reported in 3–7% of the general population in the United States (17). Most cases are the result of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's thyroiditis), while less common causes include radioiodine or surgical treatment of hyperthyroidism, hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction from tumors and hemorrhagic necrosis (Sheehan's

syndrome), and drugs (lithium, amiodarone, tetracyclines, and antineoplastic agents).

## **Clinical Manifestations**

The clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism are often subtle, and include dry skin, fatigue, muscle cramps, and constipation. Contrary to popular perception, obesity is not a consequence of hypothyroidism (18). More advanced cases can be accompanied by hyponatremia and a skeletal muscle myopathy, with elevations in creatine phosphokinase (CPK), and an increase in the serum creatinine (from creatine released by skeletal muscle) in the absence of renal dysfunction (19).

#### *Cardiovascular*

Hypothyroidism can be a source of diastolic heart failure (from impaired relaxation during diastole) and exudative pericardial effusions (from increased capillary permeability) (20). Hypothyroidism also prolongs the Q-T interval, and increases the risk of torsade de pointes (see Figure 19.9) (20).

### *Myxedema Coma*

The most life-threatening presentation of hypothyroidism is a condition characterized by depressed consciousness, hypothermia, hyponatremia, and cardiovascular instability. This condition is referred to as *myxedema coma*, but this is a misnomer, since neither coma nor myxedema is a feature of this condition (21). (Myxedema is nonpitting edema that is associated with hypothyroidism, and is caused by the intradermal accumulation of glycosaminoglycans.)

# **Diagnosis**

Free T<sup>4</sup> levels are always reduced in hypothyroidism (T<sup>3</sup> levels can be normal), while TSH levels are increased (often above 10 mU/dL) in primary hypothyroidism, and are depressed in hypothyroidism due to hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction (17,18).

### *Euthyroid Sick*

Acute, non-thyroidal illness is associated with low plasma levels of free T<sup>3</sup> , which is the result of impaired conversion of T<sup>4</sup> to T<sup>3</sup> in non-thyroidal tissue (8). With increasing severity of illness, both free T<sup>3</sup> and free T<sup>4</sup> levels are depressed, which is the pattern reported in 30–50% of ICU patients (9,10). This condition has also been called the *euthyroid sick syndrome* (8), and is usually associated with normal TSH levels (see [Table](#page-5-0) 51.2).

### **Treatment**

The treatment for mild to moderate hypothyroidism is *levothyroxine* (T<sup>4</sup> ), which is started at an oral dose of 1.5–1.8 μg/kg/day (22). Therapy is then advanced while monitoring the plasma TSH level. The optimal dose of levothyroxine is the lowest dose that returns the TSH to within the normal range. The usual dose is 75 to 150 μg/day.

#### *Myxedema Coma*

Prompt treatment of myxedema coma is mandatory, although the mortality rate is as high as 60%

(22), even with treatment. The recommended therapy is as follows (23):

- 1. Myxedema coma is often accompanied by adrenal insufficiency, so *hydrocortisone* (100 mg IV every 8 hours) is recommended at the outset, with the first dose given before thyroid replacement begins.
- 2. *Levothyroxine* is started with a slow intravenous bolus of 200 to 400 μg, followed by a maintenance dose of 50 to 100 μg orally per day (or 1.6 μg/kg/day). For IV dosing, use 75% of the oral dose.
- 3. Since the conversion of T<sup>4</sup> to T<sup>3</sup> can be depressed in critically ill patients, therapy with *liothyronine* (T<sup>3</sup> ) can be added, using an IV loading dose of 5–20 μg, followed by a maintenance dose of 2.5–10 μg IV every 8 hours, which is continued until the patient awakens and stabilizes.

### *Euthyroid Sick*

No treatment is recommended for patients with the euthyroid sick syndrome (23), as these patients are not considered to be clinically hypothyroid.

# **A FINAL WORD**

## **Much Ado About Not Much**

The introduction to this chapter included the concern that critical illness has a deleterious influence on adrenal and thyroid function, and that this influence has a negative impact on clinical outcomes in critically ill patients. The following observations do not support this concern.

- 1. Critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) is common in illnesses like septic shock, but there is no evidence that steroid therapy in these illnesses improves outcomes.
- 2. Critical illness can influence plasma thyroid hormone levels (e.g., euthyroid sick syndrome), but this condition is not considered to be clinically relevant, and does not warrant treatment.

Based on these observations, it seems that the interaction between critical illness and adrenal or thyroid function has little relevance or clinical import. (A tree with little fruit, as Euripides might say.)
