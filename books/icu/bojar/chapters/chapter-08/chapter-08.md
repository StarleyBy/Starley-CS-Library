# **8** Early Postoperative Care

The early postoperative course for most patients undergoing cardiac surgery with use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is characterized by a typical pattern of pathophysiologic derangements that benefits from standardized management.1 CPB is associated with a systemic inflammatory response that causes systemic vasodilatation and a capillary leak, which, along with hemodilution from a crystalloid prime, leads to total body volume overload. Use of CPB causes a dilutional and functional coagulopathy, and cardioplegic arrest may cause transient myocardial depression. Intraoperative monitoring to assess filling pressures and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) are used to direct hemodynamic management and fluid administration upon termination of CPB. Anesthetic techniques and early extubation protocols should be designed to achieve "fast‐track" recovery of most patients (Table 8.1).2 The pathophysiology noted after off‐pump surgery is slightly different in that patients are not subjected to the insults of CPB and cardioplegic arrest. This chapter will summarize the basic clinical features of the post‐CPB patient and will then present scenarios commonly seen in the early postoperative period. It will then discuss aspects of postoperative care unique to various types of cardiac surgery, including off‐pump and catheter‐based procedures. The subsequent chapters will describe in greater detail the assessment and management of the major concerns of the postoperative period: mediastinal bleeding and respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic problems.

# **I. Basic Features of the Early Postoperative Period**

# **A. Overview**

- **1.** Following most cardiac procedures, patients arrive in the intensive care unit (ICU) fully anesthetized and sedated, requiring mechanical ventilation for several hours. Considerations during transfer to the ICU and a discussion of ICU monitoring techniques are presented in Chapter 7.3 Adequate pharmacologic sedation and pain control are essential at this time and during the weaning process from the ventilator, which generally should be started once standard criteria are met (Table 10.3, page 475). Early extubation is usually defined as withdrawal of mechanical ventilation within six hours of surgery, and many protocols are designed to achieve "ultra‐fast" extubation within a few hours.
- **2.** Extubation can be accomplished at the conclusion of surgery following both on‐ and off‐pump surgery.4,5 After extubation, the blood pressure may be higher due to increased sympathetic tone and less vasodilation from sedatives (i.e. propofol, dexmedetomidine, and morphine). Right ventricular (RV) function may be improved when positive‐pressure ventilation is not required. However, it is important to provide adequate analgesia at this time without producing respiratory depression,

- generally using nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), intravenous (IV) acetaminophen, or low doses of narcotics.
- **3.** Ventricular function is commonly compromised for several hours following operations on CPB with cardioplegic arrest.6 Inotropic medications may be required for postcardiotomy hemodynamic support during this time as the heart recovers from the insult imposed by ischemia and reperfusion. Furthermore, diastolic function is impaired with reduced compliance. Therefore, volume administration to achieve satisfactory preload will require higher filling pressures than noted preoperatively.
- **4.** Urine output may be copious because of hemodilution during surgery. However, even though the patient is total body fluid overloaded, fluid administration is usually necessary to maintain intravascular volume to optimize hemodynamic status. Hypokalemia associated with excellent urine output must be monitored and treated. Renal function is generally a good marker of hemodynamic function, although it is subject to numerous variables. Consequently, an initial good urine output may be noted despite poor cardiac function, but a low urine output is of more concern.
- **5.** Hyperglycemia is commonly noted, even in nondiabetic patients, and the blood sugar should be maintained at <180 mg/dL using intravenous insulin protocols (see Appendix 6).
- **6.** Patients may have mediastinal bleeding as a result of surgical issues or a coagulopathy, and careful monitoring of chest tube drainage is essential. Blood or blood product transfusions may be indicated for profound anemia or ongoing bleeding.
- **7.** Postoperative care requires an integration of a myriad of hemodynamic measurements and laboratory tests to ensure a swift and uneventful recovery from surgery. Use of a comprehensive handwritten or computerized flowsheet is essential in evaluating the patient's course in the ICU.

# **B. Warming from hypothermia to 37 °C**

- **1.** Hypothermia (<36 °C) upon admission to the ICU has been associated with adverse outcomes.7 Therefore, it is imperative that adequate rewarming be performed prior to termination of CPB, since the temperature at that time correlates best with core temperature at the time of arrival in the ICU.8 Hypothermia upon arrival to the ICU must be actively treated since it may:
  - **a.** Predispose to atrial and ventricular arrhythmias and lower the ventricular fibrillation threshold
  - **b.** Produce peripheral vasoconstriction, increasing the systemic vascular resistance (SVR). This will elevate filling pressures, masking hypovolemia, increase afterload, raising myocardial oxygen demand, and often cause hypertension, potentially increasing mediastinal bleeding.
  - **c.** Precipitate shivering, which increases peripheral O2 consumption and CO2 production
  - **d.** Produce platelet dysfunction and a generalized impairment of the coagulation cascade
  - **e.** Prolong the duration of action of anesthetic drugs and prolong the time to extubation9
  - **f.** Increase the risk of wound infection, possibly related to immunosuppression
- **2.** CPB for most nonaortic surgery is usually accompanied by mild systemic hypothermia to 33–35 °C and is terminated after the patient has been rewarmed to a core

- body temperature of at least 36.5 °C. Although it is common practice to warm patients to 37 °C before terminating bypass, this may require higher arterial inflow temperatures and may be associated with impairment in neurocognitive function.10 The brain temperature is several degrees warmer than the nasopharyngeal temperature during rewarming, suggesting that temperatures measured at other sites may underestimate the degree of cerebral hyperthermia. Even the rectum and bladder, two commonly monitored sites considered to represent the core temperature, are in an "intermediate compartment" where the temperature is close, but not identical, to core temperature. Thus, although hypothermia has potential adverse effects, aggressive "overwarming" during CPB may also prove detrimental.
- **3.** Despite adequate core rewarming on pump, progressive hypothermia may ensue in the post‐pump period when the chest is still open and hemostasis is being achieved (so‐called temperature afterdrop). This results from insufficient rewarming of peripheral tissues that leaves a significant temperature gradient between the core temperature and the periphery. Thus, heat is subsequently redistributed to the periphery, resulting in a gradual reduction in core temperature. Heat loss is further exacerbated by continued intraoperative heat loss from exposure to cool ambient temperatures in the operating room, poor peripheral perfusion, administration of cold blood products or room‐temperature fluids, and anesthetic‐induced inhibition of normal thermoregulatory control.
- **4.** Prevention of temperature afterdrop can be achieved by prolonging the warming phase on CPB, warming the periphery, warming blood products before administration, or using pharmacologic vasodilation. Increasing the ambient air temperature to a tolerable level for the surgeon is helpful, especially in patients undergoing off‐ pump surgery. In these patients, the use of the Kimberly‐Clark temperature‐ management system11 or a cutaneous forced‐air warming device, such as the Bair Hugger (3M), is helpful in avoiding hypothermia (Figure 8.1). These devices are also very helpful in preventing temperature afterdrop when deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) is used, but they cannot actively warm the patient or reduce redistribution of heat.12 Sodium nitroprusside has been successful in reducing postbypass afterdrop because it produces peripheral vasodilation and improves peripheral perfusion. However, this benefit is usually noticed only in patients cooled to less than 32 °C.12,13
- **5.** In the ICU, most patients are peripherally vasoconstricted as a compensatory mechanism to provide core warming. Pharmacologic vasodilation with medications such as nitroprusside, clevidipine, or propofol may facilitate the redistribution of core heat to peripheral tissues and improve tissue perfusion, but at the same time they may delay central warming because peripheral vasodilation augments heat loss. Forced‐air warming systems, radiant warming systems, and resistive heating blankets all appear to be effective in treating postoperative hypothermia, although forced‐air systems appear to be most comfortable for the patient.14 Other measures, such as heating intravenous fluids or using heated humidifiers in the ventilator circuit, are of some benefit in preventing progressive hypothermia, but generally they do not contribute to warming.
- **6.** Shivering is associated with hypothermia and increases oxygen consumption and patient discomfort. Control of shivering is important in the postoperative period and is best controlled with meperidine (25 mg IV), which has specific antishivering

properties related to several possible mechanisms.15 Dexmedetomidine is also effective in controlling shivering.16

**7.** Occasionally a patient will rapidly rewarm to 37 °C and then "overwarm" to higher temperatures due to resetting of the central thermoregulating system. Narcotics tend to increase the core temperature required for sweating and may contribute to this problem.17 Since warming may lead to profound peripheral vasodilation and hypotension, gradual vasodilation with nitroprusside or clevidipine and concomitant volume infusion can minimize this problem (see postoperative scenarios II.A and II.B, pages 376–380.

# **C. Control of mediastinal bleeding** (see Chapter 9)

- **1.** Numerous factors may predispose to mediastinal bleeding following CPB. These include residual heparin effect, thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction, clotting factor depletion, fibrinolysis, technical issues during surgery, hypothermia, and postoperative hypertension.18,19
- **2.** Antifibrinolytic medications, including ε‐aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid, are recommended for all cardiac surgical procedures to reduce intraoperative bleeding. These medications not only inhibit fibrinolysis but, to varying degrees, also preserve platelet function.20
- **3.** A universal definition of perioperative bleeding was proposed by an expert panel in 2014.21 This took into consideration the amount of bleeding over 12 hours, the administration of transfusions, and the need for exploration, but did not define a specific amount of bleeding for which interventions were indicated. As anticipated, the more significant the degree of bleeding, the greater the risk of low cardiac output syndrome, inotrope use, acute kidney injury, and mortality.22

- Generally, an arbitrary bleeding rate of >200 mL/h of bleeding is of concern, since it may contribute to hemodynamic problems and trigger blood and blood product transfusions.23
- **4.** Careful monitoring of the extent of postoperative bleeding dictates the aggressiveness with which bleeding should be treated. Many patients with "nonsurgical" causes will drain about 100–200 mL/h for several hours before bleeding eventually tapers. Unless that produces anemia with a hematocrit <22–24% or there is evidence of hemodynamic compromise or end‐organ dysfunction, transfusion should not be necessary. A faster rate of bleeding without evidence of diminution requires systematic evaluation and treatment, often prompting re‐exploration, as described in Chapter 9.
- **5.** Thromboelastography is helpful in delineating the specific coagulation defect that needs to be addressed and may improve clinical outcomes.24 Routine coagulation studies (INR, PTT, fibrinogen, platelet count) should also be analyzed. Even though they tend to be abnormal in patients with coagulopathic bleeding, they may also be abnormal in patients with ongoing surgical bleeding. Thus, abnormal coagulation studies should not delay exploration for significant bleeding. Persistent bleeding with normal coagulation studies tends to be more surgical in nature.
- **6.** Recognition of the early signs of cardiac tamponade and the importance of prompt mediastinal exploration for severe bleeding or tamponade are critical to improving patient outcomes.25

#### **D. Ventilatory support, emergence from anesthesia, weaning, and extubation** (see Chapter 10)

- **1.** Following off‐pump or uneventful on‐pump surgery, some groups prefer to extubate patients in the OR or upon arrival in the ICU.4,5 This can be accomplished using short‐acting narcotics, such as remifentanil, low doses of another narcotics, such as sufentanil 0.15 μg/kg/h, or primarily inhalational agents.26 Sevoflurane rather than isoflurane may be used as an inhalational agent to allow for early awakening and extubation in the OR or soon after arrival in the ICU.27Alternative approaches to achieve early extubation include high thoracic epidural analgesia or spinal (intrathecal) analgesia with bupivacaine, fentanyl, or morphine with clonidine, often combined with remifentanil.28–31 Neuromuscular blockers that have a short duration of action and do not require renal or hepatic elimination, such as cisatracurium or rocuronium, are best in this regard.
- **2.** Careful monitoring of the patient's mental status and respiratory drive is imperative after extubation as the patient is still in an early phase of recovery from anesthesia. Just prior to and after extubation, analgesia should be provided to minimize splinting and improve inspiratory effort, but narcotics must be used with caution as they depress the respiratory drive. NSAIDs are usually helpful and might reduce narcotic requirements.32,33 Ketorolac is a COX‐1 inhibitor that inhibits platelet aggregation, so in addition to providing analgesia, it also been shown to improve graft patency and reduce mortality after CABG.34,35 Ibuprofen given with a proton‐pump inhibitor has also been effective and devoid of major side effects.36 However, NSAIDs must be used with caution in patients with ongoing bleeding or chronic kidney disease. Intravenous acetaminophen might also be beneficial, although a randomized trial failed to show a reduction in opioid use.37 Acetaminophen combined with propofol or dexmedetomidine has been shown to reduce the incidence of delirium.38

- **3.** Most groups select anesthetic agents to allow for early extubation within 6–8 hours of arrival in the ICU. Thus, fentanyl or sufentanil are used for narcotic‐based balanced anesthesia. Patients will remain anesthetized and sedated upon arrival in the ICU and will require mechanical ventilation for a short period of time. Propofol or dexmedetomidine will provide sedation as the narcotic effects dissipate, the latter generally being associated with shorter intubation times.39 The initial fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2 ) of 1.0 is gradually weaned to below 0.5 as long as the PaO2 remains above 80 torr or the arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2 ) exceeds 95%. The respiratory rate or tidal volume of the mechanical ventilator is adjusted to accommodate the increased CO2 production that occurs with warming, awakening, and shivering. Use of a low tidal volume (6 mL/kg rather than 10 mL/kg) has been shown to be beneficial in patients with ARDS, and a study in cardiac surgery patients found a trend towards earlier extubation, with fewer patients requiring reintubation with this ventilatory strategy.40
- **4.** Early extubation is feasible in most patients, conditional upon their mental status, gas exchange, and hemodynamic performance.
  - **a.** Virtually all patients have some compromise of pulmonary function after surgery related to a median sternotomy, entrance into the pleural cavity, and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema from the capillary leak caused by a systemic inflammatory response and fluid overload from crystalloid hemodilution. These issues are more prominent in patients undergoing prolonged complex operations with long bypass runs, who often receive multiple blood products as well. Superimposing these insults on preexisting heart failure or underlying lung disease, such as COPD, will predictably result in suboptimal oxygenation and ventilatory issues after surgery that might require a longer period of intubation.
  - **b.** Even so, as long as certain criteria are met, there is no reason to exclude a patient based upon age, comorbidities, cardiac disease, or the extent of surgery from a protocol of early extubation. Even if it takes a few hours longer to extubate a patient, the benefits of an early extubation strategy usually translate into a quicker recovery from surgery.41–43 The longer the patient remains intubated receiving sedation, the greater the risk of delirium.44
  - **c.** Once criteria for weaning are satisfied (see Table 10.3, page 475), propofol is weaned off, neuromuscular blocking agents are allowed to wear off, low‐dose narcotics or nonopioids may be given for analgesia (note that propofol is not an analgesic), and hypertension is controlled with nonsedating antihypertensive medications. If extubation criteria are met, the patient is extubated. Propofol‐ based regimens allow for earlier extubation than fentanyl‐based regimens,45 but as noted, dexmedetomidine allows for earlier extubation than propofol because it has less sedative and respiratory depressant effects, and can "take the edge off " because of its anxiolytic properties.39 As such, it is also extremely useful when a patient exhibits agitation and dyssynchronous breathing while still on the ventilator.
- **5.** Despite the desirability of early extubation, there are patients in whom it is ill‐ advised to "rush to extubate" (Table 10.2, page 472).41–43,46,47
  - **a. Preoperative** factors predictive of prolonged postoperative ventilation are often cardiac in origin, including poor left ventricular (LV) function with congestive

- heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or pulmonary edema, especially if an intra‐aortic balloon pump (IABP) is required for hemodynamic support. Other risk factors include need for urgent or emergent surgery, reoperations, and the presence of significant comorbidities, including severe COPD, marked obesity, peripheral vascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. In these cases, use of sufentanil or fentanyl is advisable, rather than shorter‐acting medications. It is reasonable to use narcotics for the control of hypertension.
- **b. Postoperative** clinical issues that may necessitate prolonged ventilation include hemodynamic instability requiring multiple inotropes and/or IABP dependence, low cardiac output syndrome, depressed level of consciousness or a stroke, ongoing mediastinal bleeding, oliguria from renal failure, and especially poor oxygenation or poor respiratory mechanics. In these patients, propofol can provide adequate sedation for several days and may be converted to other sedatives, such as fentanyl, if prolonged intubation is required. Careful review of the patient's chest x‐ray, ECG, arterial blood gases, hemodynamic parameters, and renal function should allow for identification of problems that need to be addressed. Issues related to the management of hypoxia and acute respiratory failure are discussed in detail in Chapter 10.

#### **E. Analgesia and sedation**

- **1.** An essential element of postoperative care is the provision of adequate analgesia without inducing too much sedation that may contribute to delirium or respiratory depression.48,49 Pain control reduces the sympathetic response, reducing the risk of myocardial ischemia and arrhythmias, and improves the patient's respiratory efforts, overall mental status, mobilization, and physical rehabilitation after surgery. Pain is especially prominent with coughing and deep breathing as well as with movement. "Cough pillows" to brace the chest wall are very helpful in reducing splinting. Pain often improves following removal of chest tubes.
  - **a.** Parasternal intercostal blocks or subcutaneous local anesthetic infusions of bupivacaine 0.5% 4 mL/h (ON‐Q Pain Relief System, Avanos) initiated at the time of surgery can ameliorate chest wall pain and decrease opioid requirements.50,51 This is especially beneficial when patients are extubated in the operating room.
  - **b.** While the patient remains intubated, there may be some residual analgesic effects of the intraoperative narcotics, but propofol is not an analgesic, and additional analgesic medications may be required around the time of extubation. Dexmedetomidine is beneficial in this regard since it has both sedative and analgesic properties. Use of narcotics is appropriate in patients in whom prolonged ventilation is anticipated. However, if extubation is considered imminent, a variety of analgesic regimens may be able to reduce or eliminate opioid requirements around the time of extubation. These include use of an NSAID, such as ketorolac 30 mg IV, and IV acetaminophen. A multimodal approach using a combination of dexamethasone, gabapentin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen has been shown to provide superior analgesia to opiates with less nausea after surgery through a median sternotomy incision.52
  - **c.** After extubation, adequate analgesia can be provided by a variety of medications and via different routes.
    - **i.** Use of nonopioid analgesia is always preferable and may provide adequate pain relief in most patients. IV ketorolac (15–30 mg) for 72 hours or IV

- acetaminophen can often bridge the patient to oral analgesics within a few days. Gabapentin 300 mg up to three times a day is usually recommended to treat nerve pain, but it is often helpful in providing analgesia early after surgery. Tramadol 50–100 mg every 4–6 hours may also be considered.
- **ii.** Patient‐controlled analgesia (PCA) IV pumps using a variety of opioids provide excellent analgesia.53,54 One study found that use of morphine (1 mg bolus and 0.3 mg/h infusion), fentanyl (10 μg bolus and 1 μg/kg/h infusion), or remifentanil (0.5 mg/kg bolus and 0.05 μg/kg/min infusion) started after the completion of surgery for 24 hours provided comparable analgesia, but fewer side effects were noted with use of remifentanil.54
- **iii.** Thoracic epidural or intrathecal analgesia with narcotics and bupivacaine are beneficial in reducing pain, expediting extubation, and improving pulmonary function, especially in patients with COPD and obesity.28–30,55,56
- **iv.** Small bolus doses of IV narcotics or a continuous infusion of narcotics (such as morphine sulfate 0.02 mg/kg/h for patients under age 65 and 0.01 mg/ kg/h for patients over age 65) may be considered to provide analgesia while minimizing respiratory depression.
- **v.** On occasion, persistent pain refractory to the above regimens, especially in opioid tolerant patients, may require use of IV hydromorphone (Dilaudid) 1–2 mg q2–3h, which runs the risk of respiratory depression, or a fentanyl patch (25–50 μg/h patch every 72 hours).

#### **2. Sedation**

- **a.** If the patient does not tolerate the weaning process, often becoming agitated with the weaning of propofol, substitution of dexmedetomidine can provide anxiolysis, analgesia, sympatholysis, and mild sedation to expedite a more tolerable weaning process from the ventilator.57 It can be continued after the patient is extubated.
- **b.** If delayed extubation is anticipated, propofol remains an excellent choice for several days and may be converted to IV fentanyl for longer‐term sedation.58 It should be noted that the offset of action of propofol depends on the duration of use, the depth of sedation, and body habitus. One study showed that, with light sedation for up to 24 hours, emergence occurs in only 13 minutes, but in heavily sedated patients it may take up to 25 hours!59 Although use of dexmedetomidine has only been recommended for 24 hours, several studies have found it to be comparable to or better than propofol or midazolam for long‐term sedation.60,61
- **F. Hemodynamic support** during a period of transient myocardial depression (see Chapter 11)1,6,62
  - **1.** Myocardial function following a period of cardioplegic arrest may be transiently depressed from ischemia/reperfusion injury and will often benefit from low‐dose inotropic support for several hours. Systolic dysfunction may also be accompanied by diastolic dysfunction due to impaired ventricular compliance from cardioplegic arrest and myocardial edema. The reduction in ejection fraction (EF) is about 10–15% in patients with relatively normal LV function, but it may be even greater in those with preexisting LV dysfunction. Additionally, hypothermia and elevated levels of catecholamines lead to an increase in SVR and systemic hypertension, which increase afterload and can further depress myocardial performance. Factors influencing the need for inotropic support include the extent of preoperative LV

- dysfunction, a recent infarction or ongoing ischemia at the time of surgery, and the duration of aortic cross-clamping. In patients sustaining a perioperative infarction, the period of myocardial depression tends to last somewhat longer, and may require more prolonged support.
- 2. Serial assessments of filling pressures, cardiac output and cardiac index (CI), and SVR allow for the appropriate selection of fluids, inotropes, and/or vasodilators to optimize preload, afterload, and contractility to provide hemodynamic support during this period of temporary myocardial depression. The objective is to maintain a cardiac index above 2.2 L/min/m² with a stable blood pressure (systolic 100–130 mm Hg) or a mean pressure of 70–80 mm Hg. Adequate tissue oxygenation is the primary goal of hemodynamic management and can be assessed by measuring the mixed venous O<sub>2</sub> saturation (SvO<sub>2</sub>) from the pulmonary artery port of the Swan-Ganz catheter (normal >65%).
- 3. Traditionally, the Swan-Ganz catheter has been used to monitor filling pressures, assess the cardiac output, and measure the SvO<sub>2</sub>. Numerous studies have documented an imprecise correlation of measured filling pressures with intravascular volume and fluid responsiveness and have questioned the benefits of this catheter.<sup>63</sup> In most low-risk patients, not using a Swan-Ganz catheter has not influenced outcomes; in fact, some have found its use prolongs the duration of ventilation with no impact on outcomes even in high-risk patients.<sup>64</sup> One study found not only poor correlation between echocardiography and a Swan-Ganz catheter or FloTrac device in the assessment of hemodynamics, but also little correlation between the latter two devices!<sup>65</sup> Nonetheless, numerous studies have suggested that a "goal-directed" hemodynamic approach to optimize fluid status and cardiac output may reduce complications, facilitate recovery, and shorten the hospital length of stay, although a mortality benefit may not be evident.<sup>66,67</sup> A survey reported that most centers are still using a Swan-Ganz catheter as a matter of routine because of a perceived benefit in postoperative management.<sup>68</sup>
- 4. The initial intervention to augment cardiac output is fluid administration. The filling pressures do tend to underestimate volume status, because of impaired ventricular compliance. Furthermore, the response to volume may differ, depending on whether the heart is hypertrophied with a "pressure overload" condition, as noted with hypertension or aortic stenosis (AS), or is somewhat dilated from a "volume overload" condition, as noted with long-standing aortic or mitral regurgitation. Observation of trends in filling pressures is essential when making clinical decisions about fluid administration.
- 5. Atrial or atrioventricular (AV) pacing at a rate of 80–90 beats/min is commonly required at the conclusion of surgery to achieve optimal hemodynamics, especially in hypertrophied hearts. Pacing is frequently required in patients taking β-blockers before surgery. A slow heart rate may reduce myocardial oxygen demand but will compromise cardiac output. In a well-revascularized heart, raising the heart rate to augment cardiac output is indicated and generally well tolerated. Ventricular pacing to increase heart rate will always produce inferior hemodynamic performance to atrial pacing, so atrial pacing wires should be placed in virtually all patients with preoperative sinus rhythm.
- **6.** Inotropes should be selected based on an understanding of their hemodynamic benefits and potential complications (see pages 535–548). If a marginal cardiac output

is present after adequate fluid status has been achieved, inotropic support is initiated and should improve the cardiac output to acceptable levels. When the thermodilution cardiac output appears inconsistent with the patient's clinical course, a mixed venous oxygen saturation reflects the adequacy of tissue oxygenation. This indirectly correlates with cardiac output, since it is also influenced by arterial oxygen saturation. If a satisfactory cardiac output still cannot be achieved or begins to deteriorate, additional inotropes, an IABP, or rarely an assist device may be necessary. However, in most patients, cardiac function improves to baseline within a few hours and inotropes can be usually weaned off within 12 hours of surgery. In patients with preexisting severe ventricular dysfunction or acute perioperative cardiac insults (ischemia, infarction, prolonged cross‐clamp time), it may take somewhat longer.

- **7.** Monitoring of serial hematocrits is important to ensure the adequacy of tissue oxygen delivery. The hematocrit may be influenced by hemodilution or mediastinal bleeding and should generally be maintained at a level greater than 22%. In elderly or critically ill patients, especially those with a low cardiac output state, hypotension, tachycardia, low mixed venous oxygen saturation, evidence of ischemia, metabolic acidosis, or hypoxemia, transfusion to a higher level should be considered, weighing the potential risks and benefits of transfusion.69
- **G. Fluid administration** to maintain filling pressures in the presence of a capillary leak and vasodilation (see Chapter 12)
  - **1.** Following CPB, the patient will be total body salt and water overloaded and should theoretically be diuresed. However, numerous factors may contribute to inadequate preload that may compromise hemodynamic performance.
    - **a.** Mediastinal bleeding or bleeding from leg incisions from vein harvesting.
    - **b.** A capillary leak from the CPB‐induced systemic inflammatory response which contributes to interstitial edema.
    - **c.** Peripheral vasodilatation from medications (propofol, narcotics, antihypertensive medications), and rewarming. Note that peripheral vasoconstriction that is present when the patient is hypothermic or in a low flow state will mask intravascular hypovolemia despite adequate left‐heart filling pressures.
    - **d.** Decreased ventricular compliance producing higher filling pressures at lower intravascular volumes.
    - **e.** Impaired systolic function due to transient myocardial depression that requires increased preload to maintain stroke volume.
  - **2.** Fluid administration is necessary in most patients to maintain adequate preload and cardiac output. Crystalloid and colloid infusions are used to maintain intravascular volume, although this usually occurs at the expense of expansion of the interstitial space. After the capillary leak has ceased and hemodynamics have stabilized, the patient may be aggressively diuresed to eliminate the excessive salt and water administered during surgery and the early postoperative period. Scenario B in the next few pages addresses issues related to fluid resuscitation in the vasodilated patient.

#### **H. Electrolytes and acid–base balance**

**1.** Monitoring of serum **potassium (KCl)** is essential in the early postoperative period. Potassium levels may be elevated from cardioplegia solutions delivered for myocardial protection, but most patients with normal renal function and preserved myocardial function will make large quantities of urine during the first few hours after CPB, often

- resulting in hypokalemia. To minimize the risk of developing arrhythmias, potassium levels should be checked every four hours and KCL replaced as necessary.
- **2.** Magnesium levels are usually lower due to hemodilution on CPB and should be replenished because of potential benefits in reducing postoperative arrhythmias.70
- **3.** Metabolic acidosis may result from the use of epinephrine, but may be an ominous sign of inadequate tissue perfusion, especially in the vasoconstricted patient. In several studies that evaluated central venous oxygen saturations (ScvO2), an elevated lactate level was found to be a sensitive sign of inadequate perfusion, with levels >4 mmol/L that cleared slowly, even with a normal ScvO2, correlating with a higher rate of complications.71,72 In fact, complications were also found to be common in patients with lactate levels of 2–4 mmol/L and a ScvO2 <70%, despite normal mean arterial pressures, CVP, and urine output, and may be a marker of global tissue hypoxia from "occult hypoperfusion".73 Metabolic acidosis generally resolves with improvement in hemodynamic parameters. Use of sodium bicarbonate may be considered for profound acidosis because of its adverse effects on cardiac function, but it only acts as a "bandaid" until the cause of the acidosis is corrected (see pages 715–716 in Chapter 12).
- **I.** Strict management of **hyperglycemia** has been shown to reduce the incidence of sternal wound infection and surgical mortality.74,75 Factors that contribute to hyperglycemia are insulin resistance, endogenous catecholamine release on pump, and use of epinephrine post‐pump for hemodynamic support. A hyperglycemia protocol should be utilized to determine the appropriate amount of insulin to be given to maintain blood glucose <180 mg/dL (see Appendix 6).

# **II. Management of Common Postoperative Scenarios**

There are several typical hemodynamic scenarios that are noted during the early phase of recovery from open‐heart surgery. An understanding of these patterns allows for therapeutic maneuvers to be undertaken in anticipation of hemodynamic changes, rather than as reactions to problems once they have occurred.

#### **A. Vasoconstriction from hypothermia with hypertension and borderline cardiac output**

**1.** The patient arriving in the ICU with a temperature below 35–36 °C will vasoconstrict in an attempt to increase core body temperature. The elevation in SVR may produce hypertension at a time when cardiac function is still somewhat depressed from surgery. These patients should be managed by a combination of fluid replacement to reach a pulmonary artery diastolic (PAD) pressure or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) around 15–20 mm Hg, pharmacologic vasodilation to maintain a systolic pressure of 100–120 mm Hg (mean pressure 70–80 mm Hg), and inotropic support if the cardiac index remains <2.0 L/min/m2 . Warming methods noted above should also be employed. Among the commonly used vasodilators, clevidipine is a short‐acting calcium channel blocker that reduces SVR and is usually the drug of first choice.76 Nitroprusside is preferable to intravenous nitroglycerin (IV NTG) in reducing SVR, but it is a very powerful drug which requires careful monitoring. IV NTG is useful in patients with potential ischemia, but it tends to lower preload and reduce cardiac output to a greater degree while producing less systemic vasodilation than the other drugs. Nicardipine is a longer‐acting calcium channel blocker that can also be considered.

- **2.** The use of arterial vasodilators is beneficial in the vasoconstricted patient in that they:
  - **a.** Reduce afterload, improving myocardial metabolism and LV function
  - **b.** Improve peripheral tissue perfusion and redistribute heat to the periphery
  - **c.** Facilitate gentle and adequate fluid administration
- **3.** Vasodilators will reduce the SVR and blood pressure, and left‐sided filling pressures will fall modestly, requiring the simultaneous infusion of fluids to maintain cardiac output. The optimal left‐sided filling pressures depend on the state of myocardial contractility and compliance. Preload (generally the PA diastolic pressure) should generally not be raised above 20 mm Hg, because of the deleterious effects of elevated wall tension on myocardial metabolism and function. However, if preload is allowed to fall too low, the patient may become hypovolemic and hypotensive when normothermia is achieved. The general principle is to "optimize preload **→** reduce afterload **→** restore preload".
- **4.** If the patient has a marginal cardiac index (<2.0 L/min/m2 ), has adequate filling pressures, yet is somewhat hypertensive, a low dose of a vasodilator can be initiated. If the patient is already on inotropic support, it is imperative to assess the cardiac index before modifying the therapeutic approach. Despite the temptation to do so, **stopping an inotropic medication in a hypertensive patient without first ensuring that a satisfactory cardiac output is present can be very dangerous**. Some patients with very marginal cardiac function maintain a satisfactory blood pressure by intense vasoconstriction from enhanced sympathetic tone. Loss of this compensatory mechanism may result in rapid deterioration from loss of perfusion pressure.

#### **B. Vasodilation and hypotension during the rewarming phase**

- **1.** Vasodilation reduces filling pressures and, in the hypovolemic patient, may produce hypotension and often a decrease in cardiac output despite good cardiac function. There are several reasons why a patient may vasodilate during the early postoperative period.
  - **a.** Medications used for analgesia and anxiolysis are vasodilators (narcotics, propofol, midazolam). Recent use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) tends to cause hypotension during and after bypass.
  - **b.** Intravenous NTG used in the OR or in the ICU to control blood pressure, minimize ischemia, or prevent radial artery spasm will lower preload and cardiac output as well as blood pressure. To counteract these problems, significant fluid administration is frequently required. Unless active ischemia is present, IV NTG is best avoided during the rewarming phase to reduce fluid requirements.
  - **c.** Resolution of hypothermia leads to peripheral vasodilation, which is accentuated in patients who warm to higher than 37 °C.
  - **d.** Improvement in cardiac output often leads to relaxation of peripheral vasoconstriction.
  - **e.** A vasoplegic state of refractory hypotension may develop despite the presence of an adequate cardiac output. This may be a consequence of a systemic inflammatory response (although it has been noted after off‐pump surgery as well) and may be related to vasodilation induced by nitric oxide.

- **f.** Transfusion reactions or anaphylactic reactions to medications will cause vasodilation.
- **g.** Sepsis is very uncommon immediately after surgery but should be considered in the differential diagnosis.
- **2.** To avoid hypotension, fluids must be given to maintain filling pressures. The quandary is whether crystalloid or colloid should be selected and how much should be given. If the basic reason for hypovolemia is a capillary leak syndrome, the use of colloid could be detrimental, because its oncotic elements may pass into the interstitial tissues, exacerbating tissue edema and compromising organ function. However, if vasodilation of the peripheral and splanchnic beds is the major problem, then colloids should be preferable, because they will augment the intravascular volume to a greater extent than crystalloids. Generally, if filling pressures are not elevated, the amount of extravascular lung water will not be influenced significantly whether colloid or crystalloid is infused.77 Volume resuscitation is usually required during the initial six hours after arrival in the ICU, following which most mechanisms for vasodilation are no longer present and the capillary leak begins to abate.
- **3.** It is generally best to start with a 500 mL bolus of lactated Ringer's, rather than normal saline. The latter may contribute to a hyperchloremic acidosis and worsen acute kidney injury.78,79 If there is a minimal increase in filling pressures, a colloid such as 5% albumin may be chosen because more volume is retained in the intravascular space. Hetastarch compounds increase the intravascular volume more effectively than crystalloid and for longer than 5% albumin, but they have fallen out of favor as they may contribute to a coagulopathy or renal dysfunction. If given, tetrastarches should be used and the total infusion volume limited to 1500–1750 mL (20 mL/kg) per 24 hours.80 If the patient's hematocrit is low (<22%), a packed red cell transfusion is the most appropriate means of increasing intravascular volume. If the patient is bleeding, use of blood component transfusions may be indicated as well. It must always be remembered that any volume, but more so colloids and blood products than crystalloids, will also lower the hematocrit from hemodilution.
- **4.** There is often a tendency to administer a tremendous amount of fluid during the period of vasodilation in order to maintain filling pressures and systemic blood pressure. Although most patients with satisfactory cardiac function will simultaneously produce a copious amount of urine, many patients will not. One should resist the temptation to "flood" the patient with fluid, because excessive fluid administration (>2 L within six hours) will exacerbate interstitial pulmonary edema and delay extubation, and may contribute to cerebral or bowel edema. It will also produce significant hemodilution, often necessitating blood transfusions for anemia, and will reduce the levels of clotting factors, possibly increasing mediastinal bleeding and necessitating plasma or platelet administration. **Preload should be increased only as necessary to maintain satisfactory cardiac output and tissue perfusion.**
- **5.** The response to fluid administration is not always predictable and depends on the compliance of the left atrium and ventricle, the degree of "capillary leak", and the intensity of peripheral vasoconstriction.
  - **a.** An increase in preload with repeated fluid challenges will generally raise the cardiac output and blood pressure to satisfactory levels. Less volume is required in noncompliant hearts, usually those with LV hypertrophy. Peripheral vasoconstriction tends to relax as the cardiac output improves and the patient

warms. As this occurs, filling pressures tend to fall and some additional volume may be necessary. If cardiac function and filling pressures are adequate, yet the blood pressure remains marginal, use of an α‐agent (phenylephrine or norepinephrine) to support the blood pressure can limit the amount of fluid that needs to be given. If these drugs cannot maintain a satisfactory blood pressure with adequate filling pressures, yet the cardiac output is satisfactory, a "vasoplegic syndrome" may be present. This generally responds to vasopressin 0.01–0.1 units/ min.81 This syndrome may be attributable to leukocyte activation and release of proinflammatory mediators caused by the systemic inflammatory response to CPB, although it has been described after off‐pump surgery as well. If vasoplegia persists, methylene blue 2 mg/kg IV followed by 0.5–1 mg/kg/h may be beneficial.82

- **b.** Failure of filling pressures to rise with volume infusions may be noted in patients with highly compliant, volume‐overloaded hearts (such as mitral regurgitation), in whom the cardiac output improves before the filling pressures are noted to increase. Thus, further fluid therapy can be guided by the cardiac output. Consideration must always be given to possible sources of blood loss, including accumulation in the chest cavity not drained by chest tubes.
- **c.** In other patients, filling pressures may not rise due to persistent vasodilation and the capillary leak of fluid into the interstitial space rather than retention in the intravascular space. This is particularly common in very sick patients with a long duration of CPB. Sometimes it seems virtually impossible to maintain filling pressures and cardiac output despite a tremendous amount of fluid administration, yet, on occasion, this may be necessary. One often has to accept the adverse consequences of excessive total body water to improve hemodynamics. Use of drugs to provide inotropic support and produce an increase in systemic resistance may reduce the amount of fluid administered.
- **d.** If filling pressures do rise with fluid administration, but the blood pressure and cardiac output remain marginal, RV and LV distention may ensue, increasing myocardial oxygen demand and decreasing coronary blood flow. At this point, further fluid administration is contraindicated, and inotropic support must be initiated. An echocardiographic assessment may be necessary to rule out tamponade or assess for unsuspected additional pathology (ventricular septal defect, valvular pathology). A chest x‐ray may demonstrate a tension pneumothorax.
- **6.** The following is a general guideline to hemodynamic management during the rewarming phase.
  - **a.** If the blood pressure is marginal, push the PAD pressure or PCWP to 18–20 mm Hg (often up to 25 mm Hg in hypertrophied hearts) using crystalloid and then colloid. Once this level is reached and the patient remains hypotensive, if the urine volume begins to match the infused volume, or if more than 2000 mL of fluid has been administered and filling pressures are not rising, consider the following:
    - **i.** If CI >2.2 L/min/m2 , use phenylephrine (pure α), or if unsuccessful, vasopressin for a potential "vasoplegic" state
    - **ii.** If CI is 1.8–2.2 L/min/m2 , use norepinephrine (α and β)
    - **iii.** If CI <1.8 L/min/m2 , use an inotrope, then norepinephrine to support the blood pressure

- **b. Note:** use of an α‐agent may not be able to minimize a capillary leak, but it does counteract vasodilation. This may decrease the volume requirement and improve SVR and blood pressure with little effect on myocardial function.
- **C. Copious urine output and falling filling pressures.** Some patients will make large quantities of urine, resulting in a reduction in filling pressures, blood pressure, and cardiac output. Several factors should be considered when determining why this might be occurring.
  - **1.** Did the patient receive mannitol or furosemide in the OR because of a low urine output or hyperkalemia? Urine output is no longer a direct reflection of myocardial function when a diuretic has been administered. Excessive urine output often necessitates a significant amount of fluid administration to maintain filling pressures and confounds the selection of the appropriate fluid to administer (crystalloid vs. colloid).
  - **2.** Is the patient hyperglycemic and developing an osmotic diuresis? A hyperglycemia protocol should be used routinely to maintain blood glucose below 180 mg/dL (see Appendix 6).
  - **3.** Does the patient have normal LV function and the kidneys are simply mobilizing excessive interstitial fluid from hemodilution on pump? This beneficial effect is often seen in healthy patients with a short CPB run and reflects excellent cardiac output and renal function that should lead to a rapid postoperative recovery. However, copious urine output can be problematic when it lowers filling pressures, blood pressure, and cardiac output.
    - **a.** Any contributing factors or medications causing the diuresis should be addressed.
    - **b.** Crystalloid and colloid should be administered to keep the fluid balance modestly negative during this phase of spontaneous diuresis. The temptation should be resisted to administer too much colloid, because this can produce hemodilution and progressive anemia despite the negative fluid balance and can dilute clotting factors, potentially contributing to mediastinal bleeding. Use of an α‐agent or vasopressin may maintain filling pressures and decrease the volume requirement in some of these patients.

# **D. Low cardiac output syndrome with impaired left ventricular function**

- **1.** Isolated LV dysfunction requiring postcardiotomy inotropic support may be noted in patients with active ischemia at the time of surgery, preexisting LV dysfunction, a remote or recent myocardial infarction, or advanced valvular heart disease. It may also result from intraoperative problems, such as a prolonged period of cardioplegic arrest, inadequate myocardial protection, incomplete revascularization, or compromised graft flow. Poor RV or LV function often reflects reversible myocardial stunning rather than perioperative ischemia and infarction. Both are managed in similar fashion, but the suspicion of ongoing ischemia by ECG may require reevaluation and potential treatment in the cardiac cath lab.83–86
- **2.** Appropriate measures should be taken at the conclusion of surgery to assess and optimize a patient's hemodynamic status before arrival in the ICU, including pacing, optimal preload, inotropic support, and use of an IABP, if indicated. It is critical that the surgeon, along with the anesthesiologist, establish a "game plan" for how the patient should be managed in the ICU. Assessment of cardiac function by

direct visualization and TEE allows for correlation with hemodynamic parameters obtained with the Swan‐Ganz catheter to establish an individualized therapeutic approach. Decisions on desired filling pressures, inotropic selection, plans for maintaining or weaning inotropes, and ventilatory requirements must be communicated to those caring for the patient in the ICU on a minute‐by‐minute basis. Careful monitoring and continuous reevaluation in the ICU are essential to identify whether the patient is recovering as desired or requires further evaluation and intervention.

- **3.** In addition to careful examination and standard monitoring of critically ill patients, **echocardiography** in the ICU is very beneficial in clarifying potential problems. A typical scenario that may benefit from echo evaluation is the patient with a low cardiac output on substantial doses of inotropes, borderline and labile blood pressure, elevated filling pressures (often ascribed to volume infusions), worsening oxygenation, and bleeding that is ongoing or has tapered. In such a situation, an echo is indicated to assess whether there are factors other than LV dysfunction that may be causing the low cardiac output syndrome. Conditions such as circumferential or regional cardiac tamponade, severe diastolic dysfunction, RV dysfunction, regurgitant valvular lesions, or septal shunting may be identified. The most likely alternative cause of the scenario noted is cardiac tamponade, which, fortunately, is the most remediable. If a transthoracic echo does not provide adequate acoustic windows, a transesophageal study can easily be performed, especially in the intubated patient.87
- **4.** A comprehensive discussion of the management of the low cardiac output syndrome is provided starting on page 521 in Chapter 11.

# **E. Normal left ventricular function but low cardiac output: diastolic dysfunction**

- **1.** A disturbing postoperative scenario is that of a low cardiac output syndrome associated with normal or elevated left‐heart filling pressures yet preserved LV function. This scenario is noted most commonly in small women with systemic hypertension who have small, hypertrophied LVs. A variant of this problem is seen in patients with AS and hyperdynamic hearts that manifest near cavity obliteration.88
- **2.** The problem of severe diastolic dysfunction is characterized by reduced ventricular compliance exacerbated by myocardial edema from ischemia/reperfusion injury. Contributing factors to the low cardiac output are lack of AV synchrony with impaired ventricular filling, occasionally impaired RV function, and perhaps excessive use of inotropic agents.
- **3.** The hemodynamic data derived from the Swan‐Ganz catheter typically show elevated filling pressures and a low cardiac output, suggestive of LV dysfunction. Thus, a typical therapeutic response would be to ensure AV conduction, administer some volume, and initiate inotropic support. However, this may lead to little improvement in cardiac output, even higher filling pressures leading to pulmonary congestion, a reduction in renal blood flow (often exacerbated by systemic venous hypertension), and progressive oliguria. The use of inotropes may also produce a significant sinus tachycardia that is detrimental to myocardial metabolism and recovery.
- **4.** Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has been invaluable in the assessment and management of this problem. TEE will usually confirm a hypertrophic, stiff

- LV with hyperdynamic systolic function and signs of diastolic dysfunction. Fluid should be administered to raise the PAD pressure to about 20–25 mm Hg. This will increase the LV end‐diastolic volume, which tends to be lower than would be suggested by pressure measurements because of poor LV compliance. Lusitropic drugs that relax the LV should be substituted for catecholamines that have strong β‐adrenergic inotropic and chronotropic properties. Dobutamine or milrinone may be beneficial in this regard and can support RV function as well.
- **5.** Other considerations include use of low‐dose calcium channel blockers or β‐blockers to improve diastolic relaxation, although it is conceptually difficult to start these when the cardiac output is compromised. Aggressive diuresis to reduce interstitial edema while providing colloid (salt‐poor albumin) to maintain intravascular volume may also improve diastolic relaxation. If the patient can survive the first few days of low output syndrome without end‐organ dysfunction, a gradual improvement in cardiac output generally results.

# **F. Low cardiac output states from right ventricular dysfunction**

- **1.** The problem of a marginal cardiac output and blood pressure with preserved LV function may also be noted in patients with markedly impaired RV function. This may result from RV infarction and prior RV dysfunction from pulmonary hypertension (PH) of any cause, most commonly mitral valve disease. Intraoperative issues include surgical correction of severe TR with preexisting RV dysfunction, poor intraoperative protection of the RV, especially with RV hypertrophy in patients with PH, and use of multiple blood products. Inadequate pulmonary blood flow compromises oxygenation, and RV dilatation and distention can then cause septal shift, compromising LV filling.
- **2.** RV function can be improved by moderate volume infusions, maintenance of a satisfactory systemic perfusion pressure, and measures to improve RV contractility and reduce RV afterload. These include normalizing arterial blood gases with correction of acidosis, use of appropriate inotropes (usually milrinone or dobutamine), and initiation of a pulmonary vasodilator (inhaled nitric oxide, epoprostenol [Flolan], iloprost or milrinone).89–91 If these steps are insufficient, consideration should be given to use of an RV assist device or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
- **3.** The management of RV dysfunction is discussed in more detail on pages 530–534.

# **III. Postoperative Considerations Following Commonly Performed Procedures92**

# **A. On‐pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)**

**1.** Even with relatively normal preoperative LV function, most centers use a low‐ dose inotrope to support myocardial function at the termination of bypass and for several hours in the ICU during the early phase of transient myocardial dysfunction. The initial first‐line drug is usually epinephrine or dobutamine. Epinephrine (1–2 μg/min) is the preferred inotrope and usually produces less tachycardia than the other drugs. If there is an inadequate response to one of these catecholamines, milrinone is of great benefit in improving cardiac output. It is a positive inotrope that produces systemic vasodilation that frequently requires the addition of norepinephrine to support systemic resistance. When hemodynamic performance

- remains very marginal, placement of an IABP should be considered. In contrast to the catecholamines, the IABP can reduce myocardial oxygen demand and improve coronary perfusion. Inotropic support beyond 6–12 hours may be necessary if the patient has sustained a perioperative infarction or has a severely "stunned" myocardium that exhibits a prolonged period of dysfunction in the absence of infarction. A persistent low output state despite optimal pharmacologic therapy and an IABP may require placement of an assist device.
- **2.** While the patient is intubated, propofol is an effective vasodilator to mitigate hypertension, but the blood pressure tends to creep upwards as the level of sedation is weaned. At this point, if the patient is otherwise hemodynamically stable, it is advisable to start a vasodilator which reduces SVR, such as clevidipine or nitroprusside, rather than give additional sedation or narcotics to control hypertension, in order to minimize respiratory depression. IV NTG may be used, especially if there is evidence of ischemia, but it will lower preload and cardiac output. Short‐acting antihypertensives are preferable, because, as the patient warms, hypertension will start to resolve as peripheral vasoconstriction abates.
- **3.** Although patients who are β‐blocked preoperatively frequently require pacing at the conclusion of bypass, tachycardia may be present in those who are not well β‐blocked, especially in young, anxious patients. Although the potential causes of a tachycardia always need to be assessed, the combination of hypertension and tachycardia with a supranormal cardiac output can be managed by β‐blockers (esmolol or intermittent doses of IV metoprolol). Patients with a **hyperdynamic left ventricle** may develop progressive tachycardia when vasodilators are used to control hypertension. This should be managed by allowing the blood pressure to drift up to 140 mm Hg systolic and then using a β‐blocker to control both the tachycardia and the hypertension.
- **4.** Atrial and ventricular pacing wires should be placed in all patients undergoing CABG. If the patient has sinus bradycardia or a junctional rhythm, atrial pacing at 90 beats/min should be used to ensure optimal LV filling and improve the cardiac output. If there is normal AV conduction, it is always preferable to use atrial pacing rather than AV sequential pacing, since the latter involves pacing of the right atrium (RA) and right ventricle (RV), which will produce ventricular dyssynchrony. If second‐ or third‐degree heart block is present, pacing in the DVI or DDD mode is appropriate. In patients with moderate–severe LV dysfunction, biventricular pacing (RA–BiV) using an extra set of leads will provide a superior cardiac output to standard RA–RV pacing.93,94 If the patient has a slow ventricular response to atrial fibrillation (AF), VVI pacing should be initiated. Atrial pacing wires are probably not necessary in patients with long‐standing AF, but many of these patients will be in sinus rhythm at the conclusion of surgery and for a few days afterwards, and, if bradycardic, they might benefit from atrial pacing.
- **5.** A common practice is to initiate antiarrhythmic therapy with lidocaine in the OR to suppress ventricular arrhythmias, although there is little documented evidence of benefit.95 It is given at the time of removal of the aortic cross‐clamp and then continued on a prophylactic basis until the following morning. Alternatively, prophylactic amiodarone may be used to reduce the incidence of postoperative AF, especially in elderly patients, and it can also provide benefits in controlling ventricular ectopy. A common approach is to give the initial load intravenously during

- surgery, although protocols of preoperative oral loading or a postoperative IV load may be just as effective in reducing the incidence of postoperative AF.96
- **6. Atrial fibrillation** is noted in about 25% of patients following CABG. It may be related to poor atrial preservation during surgery or to withdrawal of β‐blockers. Most centers initiate a β‐blocker by the first postoperative morning (usually metoprolol 25–50 mg bid) because of the overwhelming evidence that β‐blockers reduce the incidence of AF.97 Magnesium sulfate has been shown in several studies to reduce the incidence of AF as well as the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias.70,98 Administration of 2 g at the termination of CPB and on the first postoperative morning can be recommended. Amiodarone may be used alone or in addition to β‐blockers for AF prophylaxis, the latter being perhaps the best approach.97,99 A detailed discussion of the prevention and management of AF is presented on pages 620–632.
- **7.** Close attention must be paid to the postoperative **ECG**. Evidence of ischemia may represent incomplete revascularization, poor myocardial protection, or impaired myocardial perfusion due to anastomotic stenosis, acute graft occlusion, or coronary spasm (Figure 8.2).100 Regardless of the etiology, IV NTG (starting at 0.25 μg/kg/min) is usually indicated. Calcium channel blockers (nifedipine 30 mg SL or diltiazem 0.25 mg/kg IV over two minutes, then 5–15 mg/h IV) are useful if coronary spasm is suspected. These medications may resolve ischemic changes or minimize infarct size if necrosis is already under way. Placement of an IABP should also be considered. If a problem with a bypass graft is suspected as the cause of the ischemia, emergency angiography followed by percutaneous coronary intervention or re‐exploration may be indicated.83–86 Coronary spasm can be so refractory as to cause cardiogenic shock that can only be treated by emergency ECMO.101

**Figure 8.2 •** An ECG obtained from a patient following a coronary bypass operation that required an endarterectomy of a diffusely diseased LAD. Note the profound ST elevations in precordial leads consistent with a current of injury. The patient was returned to the cath lab and found to have an obstruction distal to the anastomosis from an elevated plaque, and a stent was satisfactorily placed.

- **8.** ST elevation noted in multiple ECG leads is often consistent with acute pericarditis, although computerized interpretation of these ECGs often indicates "acute infarction" (Figure 8.3). The ECG must be interpreted carefully, taking into consideration the heart's hemodynamic performance and an accurate perception by the surgeon of the quality of revascularization. An echocardiogram should be considered to assess for regional wall motion abnormalities.
- **9.** The development of new postoperative ventricular arrhythmias should always raise the specter of ischemia and may prompt consideration of postoperative coronary angiography. A full 12‐lead ECG should be reviewed. Reentrant ventricular tachycardias are usually related to prior heart damage. Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) in patients with an EF >35% is best managed with β‐blockers and/or amiodarone. In patients with a low EF, amiodarone should be given, and if VT recurs, an electrophysiologic study may be indicated and placement of an implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator (ICD) may be considered. The timing of placement may depend on the frequency and severity of VT, since randomized studies have suggested waiting three months after revascularization, during which time improvement in LV function may occur. A LifeVest (ZOLL Medical Corporation) might be considered in the interim.
- **10.** Virtually all open‐heart surgery on pump is associated with some degree of perioperative myocardial injury with elevation in cardiac biomarkers. For that reason, some surgeons do not routinely obtain troponin or CK‐MB values postoperatively. Therefore, the diagnosis of a **perioperative myocardial infarction (PMI)** can be difficult to make, but may be suspected when there are persistent ECG changes and new regional wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography.102,103 Biomarkers are very sensitive to myocardial injury, and higher levels do reflect more myocardial necrosis and correlate with adverse outcomes. Management of a PMI consists primarily of hemodynamic support. A common finding in the patient sustaining a small PMI is a low SVR that requires a vasopressor for several days to support blood pressure. A more extensive infarction may require pharmacologic support or an IABP for longer periods of time. The diagnosis and management of a PMI are discussed in more detail on pages 586–589.

**Figure 8.3 •** An ECG obtained several hours after an uneventful valve operation. Note the diffuse elevation in ST segments with PR depression, which is consistent with acute pericarditis.

- **11.** For patients receiving **radial artery grafts**, a vasodilator is used to prevent graft spasm. A variety of "cocktails" including IV NTG with verapamil or nicardipine may be used during preparation of the conduit, and IV diltiazem 10 mg/h or IV NTG 10–15 μg/min (0.1–0.2 μg/kg/min) is given intraoperatively and continued for 18–24 hours postoperatively. These intravenous medications are then converted to amlodipine 5 mg qd, long‐acting diltiazem 120–180 mg PO qd, or isosorbide mononitrate (Imdur) 20 mg PO qd, and arbitrarily continued for six months.100
- **12. Antiplatelet therapy** has been shown to inhibit platelet deposition on vein grafts and may delay or attenuate the development of fibrointimal hyperplasia and atherosclerosis. This may translate into reduced perioperative mortality and long‐ term improvement in graft patency rates.
  - **a.** The immediate postoperative period is a time of increased platelet reactivity, and aspirin should be started within 6–24 hours after surgery.104 There are concerns that platelet aggregation may not be sufficiently inhibited at doses of 75–100 mg, suggesting that 325 mg daily may be more beneficial.105,106 Aspirin can be recommended for one year to improve graft patency and indefinitely for secondary prevention of coronary disease. Thus, it should also be given to patients receiving all arterial grafts as well. If a patient is unable to take aspirin, a 300 mg clopidogrel load followed by 75 mg daily is recommended, since failure to give a load will cause inadequate platelet inhibition for several days.
  - **b.** Most studies suggest that dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with ASA and a P2Y12 inhibitor does not provide any additional benefit in patients with stable ischemic heart disease undergoing CABG, including diabetics, as shown in the FREEDOM trial.107–109 However, the AHA guidelines give a level IIb indication to consider DAPT for one year in such patients,104 whereas the European guidelines give a level IIb indication to consider DAPT only for patients who had coronary endarterectomies during on‐pump CABG (but for all off‐pump CABGs).109
  - **c.** For patients undergoing CABG for an acute coronary syndrome, the AHA guidelines give a level IIa indication for DAPT, with the recommendation to use aspirin with ticagrelor or prasugrel rather than clopidogrel.104 A meta‐ analysis showed the former two P2Y12 inhibitors were effective in reducing mortality and graft occlusion rates.110 The ESC guidelines recommend DAPT only if the patient had received DAPT preoperatively, which is often the case in most patients presenting with a non‐STEMI undergoing surgery.109
  - **d.** Statins should be given following surgery to improve vein graft patency.111 Better efficacy may be achieved by giving a loading dose rather than regular dosing immediately after surgery.112 The 2015 AHA recommendations were to give a high‐dose statin (atorvastatin 40–80 mg or rosuvastatin 20–40 mg) after surgery to patients <age 75 and a lower dose to patients >age 75.104
- **B. Off‐pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB)** is performed through a sternotomy incision and avoids use of CPB. Numerous studies have documented that OPCAB is associated with reduced blood loss, reduced transfusion requirements, less renal dysfunction, and arguably less AF, less neurocognitive decline, and a lower risk of stroke.113,114 However, most studies indicate that it is associated with less complete revascularization, more repeat revascularization, and compromised long‐term

surivval.115–120 Patients are intensively monitored during OPCAB using continuous cardiac output measurements, in‐line mixed venous oxygen saturations, and TEE to ensure stability during the procedure. Aspects of this operation which can impact postoperative care include temperature regulation, the influence of intraoperative ischemia on cardiac performance, potential anastomotic problems or incomplete revascularization causing perioperative ischemia or infarction, fluid administration to maintain hemodynamics during cardiac positioning, and bleeding due to use of heparin or transfusion of scavenged blood.

- **1.** Patient temperature tends to drift during surgery and must be maintained by having a higher temperature in the OR, warming all intravenous fluids,121 and using a topical warming device, such as the Bair Hugger or Kimberly‐Clark temperature‐controlling system. The Thermogard XP endovascular heating system (ZOLL Medical Corporation), which is placed within the inferior vena cava, has also been found to be very effective in maintaining normothermia.122 If the patient arrives in the unit hypothermic, the standard measures noted in section I.B, pages 367–369 should be utilized.
- **2.** Hemodynamic performance is generally stable after arrival in the ICU, although ischemia occurring during construction of anastomoses may lead to transient diminution in cardiac performance. Generally, the initial deterioration in cardiac output noted in CPB patients does not occur. However, low doses of inotropes are commonly used during surgery, especially in patients with impaired ventricular function, and should be continued until a satisfactory output can be maintained.
- **3.** The immediate postoperative ECG must be evaluated. Intraoperative assessment of graft patency by Doppler flow analysis should be considered. The likelihood of an anastomotic problem is greater during OPCAB than an on‐pump CABG due to suboptimal visualization from bleeding or cardiac motion. This may be evidenced by ECG changes or regional wall motion abnormalities on TEE, but this is not always the case. Occasionally, an abnormal ECG reflects incomplete revascularization when arteries have not been bypassed, either to exposure issues, hemodynamic instability, or small size. There should be a low threshold for postoperative coronary angiography if there is any question about graft flow and patency.
- **4.** Pacing wires should be placed on all patients, because patients well managed preoperatively on β‐blockers will have slower heart rates that will persist into the postoperative period. Although heart rates of 60–70 bpm are acceptable, cardiac output can be optimized by achieving a heart rate of at least 80 bpm in the early postoperative period.
- **5.** The benefits of OPCAB in reducing the incidence of AF are controversial, with benefits most likely seen in elderly patients.114,123 Thus, the early initiation of β‐ blockers remains essential. Magnesium is usually given in the OR to raise the arrhythmia threshold during construction of anastomoses, and may also be given on the first postoperative day to reduce the risk of AF. Use of amiodarone in high‐ risk patients may be considered.
- **6.** Although the hemodilution of CPB has been avoided, there is a tendency for anesthesiologists to administer a significant amount of fluid during surgery to maintain preload and offset the adverse effects of cardiac manipulation and positioning on hemodynamic performance, especially during grafting of the

- posterolateral wall. Thus, patients tend to be somewhat fluid overloaded and need to be diuresed once hemodynamic stability has been achieved. Although the incidence of renal dysfunction may arguably be less with OPCAB, there is an obligatory period of relative hypotension during the construction of proximal anastomoses with an aortic sideclamp that can adversely affect kidney function in patients with preexisting renal dysfunction. This is less of a problem when proximal anastomoses are constructed using devices such as the HEARTSTRING proximal seal system (MAQUET Cardiovascular).
- **7.** Many centers extubate OPCAB patients in the OR or soon after arrival in the ICU. Standard criteria for weaning and extubation should be used. These include the achievement of normothermia, hemodynamic stability, absence of bleeding, an adequate level of alertness without significant pain, and satisfactory gas exchange. Use of short‐acting anesthetic agents and propofol or dexmedetomidine should allow for the safe early extubation of most patients once these criteria are met.124 Because of the increased fluid administration to maintain hemodynamic stability, pulmonary compliance is reduced.125 Although one comparative study of OPCAB and routine CABG showed better gas exchange and earlier extubation after OPCABs, another showed no difference, and both studies showed comparable deterioration in pulmonary function tests after either type of operation.125,126
- **8.** Anemia is less common after OPCAB than on‐pump surgery because hemodilution and other adverse effects of CPB on the coagulation system are avoided. Thus, significant mediastinal bleeding should be extremely uncommon in the absence of a surgical bleeding site. However, the potential for a coagulopathy may still exist.
  - **a.** Heparinization is necessary during the procedure, and some degree of fibrinolysis is also probably present. Antifibrinolytic drugs have been shown to be beneficial in reducing bleeding in OPCAB, and thus should be utilized.127
  - **b.** Insidious blood loss occurring during the construction of distal anastomoses is scavenged into a cell‐saving device. Centrifugation and washing eliminate clotting factors and platelets from reinfused blood.
  - **c.** Both pleural spaces are entered during OPCAB, and failure to place a chest tube in a pleural cavity (or poor drainage through a pleural tube that is placed) may result in the undetected collection of blood that spills over from the mediastinum. Vigilance remains necessary in assessing and managing significant mediastinal bleeding, with a high level of suspicion that it might be occurring if the patient is hemodynamically unstable.
- **9.** Following OPCAB, a hypercoagulable state may exist, in part related to enhanced platelet reactivity and less platelet dysfunction than noted with use of CPB.128 Early institution of aspirin plus clopidogrel has been shown to reduce postoperative cardiac events without an increased risk of bleeding. A meta‐analysis showed a reduction in early vein graft occlusion and perioperative infarction (yet an increased risk of bleeding) with DAPT after OPCAB.129 Thus, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommendation is to use DAPT for one year after surgery,104 although one study showed no additional benefit of giving clopidogrel for more than one month after surgery.130

- **C. Minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass grafting (MIDCAB)** entails performance of an anastomosis of the left internal thoracic artery (LITA) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD). This is performed through a left thoracotomy incision using one‐lung anesthesia. The LITA may be taken down with direct vision, thoracoscopically or robotically.
  - **1.** Patients are generally extubated in the OR or soon after arrival in the ICU. Epidural or intrathecal morphine analgesia (Duramorph) is helpful in reducing splinting and improving respiratory efforts in patients who might otherwise have significant chest wall pain from rib retraction, resection, or fracture.131 A local infusion of bupivacaine into the wound is also helpful and may provide superior pain relief to the use of PCA alone.132
  - **2.** No pacing wires are placed, so a heart rate in the 60–70 bpm range is acceptable. Ventricular pacing wires placed through a Swan‐Ganz Paceport catheter can be used for bradycardia, but generally they do not provide optimal hemodynamics. External pacing may be used, if necessary.
  - **3.** A postoperative ECG must be obtained and carefully reviewed for any evidence of ischemia, because anastomotic problems are more common when surgery is performed on a beating, rather than an arrested, heart.
  - **4.** Intrapericardial or intrapleural bleeding may originate from the chest wall, the anastomotic site, or side branches of the ITA. Blood will more readily accumulate in the pleural space during spontaneous ventilation. The possibility of bleeding should be monitored by observing chest tube drainage and a postoperative chest x‐ray.

#### **D. Aortic valve surgery and TAVRs (surgical and transcatheter)**

- **1. Aortic stenosis (surgical aortic valve replacement [SAVR])**
  - **a.** Aortic stenosis (AS) leads to the development of a hypertrophied, noncompliant LV that depends on synchronized atrial and ventricular contractions for nearly 30% of its stroke volume. Postoperatively, it is imperative that sinus rhythm be present or that atrial or AV pacing be used. The optimal heart rate early after surgery is probably around 80–90 bpm for patients with LVH. There should be a low threshold for cardioversion of AF, because profound hemodynamic deterioration may occur, especially during the first 24 hours after surgery.
  - **b.** Adequate **preload** must be maintained (PCWP often >20 mm Hg) to ensure adequate LV filling. Filling pressures may rise rapidly with minimal volume infusion because of the noncompliant hypertrophied LV.
  - **c.** Although the LV pressure is often very high in patients with high transvalvular gradients, significant **systolic hypertension** is usually not seen at the conclusion of surgery, despite elimination of most of the gradient by valve replacement. However, hypertension tends to develop after several hours in the ICU and must be controlled to reduce myocardial oxygen demand and protect the aortic suture line. Use of vasodilators for a hyperdynamic heart may reduce diastolic perfusion pressure and produce a tachycardia. A β‐blocker, such as esmolol or IV metoprolol, is beneficial in this situation. Subsequently, if the patient remains hypertensive, an oral β‐blocker should be used. ARBs have been shown to improve diastolic function and should be considered as well.133

**d.** The patient with a hypertrophied, hyperdynamic LV may demonstrate midcavity obliteration and intracavitary flow acceleration, a problem associated with increased perioperative risk.88 The LV demonstrates diastolic dysfunction with increased stiffness after surgery and is unable to fill well. This results in elevated filling pressures, low stroke volumes, and a low cardiac output. This problem may be exacerbated by patient/prosthesis mismatch. TEE in the OR can define the nature of the pathophysiology and direct management appropriately. Volume infusions to improve LV filling are beneficial despite the high filling pressures, but initiation of inotropic support with catecholamines for a low cardiac output state is counterproductive. Milrinone or dobutamine might be beneficial because of their lusitropic effects that promote ventricular relaxation. β‐blockers can be used cautiously. ARBs, as noted, may also promote diastolic relaxation.

# **2. Aortic stenosis (transcatheter aortic valve replacement [TAVR])**

- **a.** TAVR has become the procedure of choice for most patients with AS. Even in elderly patients in whom this initially had been performed, recovery is expeditious and most patients are discharged from the hospital the day after the procedure.
- **b. Hemodynamics.** Most patients following TAVR are somewhat hypertensive and may require intravenous antihypertensive medications (preferably clevidipine) until their oral medications can be started. Instability and hypotension during the procedure may be related to tamponade from wire perforation or annular disruption, or to ischemia from coronary ostial occlusion or significant coronary stenoses that were left unaddressed. Hypotension and bradycardia commonly result from the use of dexmedetomidine for sedation and improve once it is weaned off. In the absence of myocardial ischemia or bleeding, most patients respond to phenylephrine.
- **c. Conduction abnormalities.** A pre‐procedural ECG is helpful in determining whether the patient is at risk for advanced heart block, but telemetry is recommended overnight for all patients following a TAVR procedure.
  - **i.** A temporary pacemaker wire may be left at the conclusion of the procedure if the heart rate is very slow or there is evidence or predictors of advanced heart block. An ACC expert consensus panel recommended leaving the temporary pacing wire in overnight for patients with a pre‐ existing right bundle branch block (RBBB), who are at the highest risk for developing advanced or complete heart block, or with a pre‐existing QRS >120 ms or first‐degree AV block if there is an increase in the PR or QRS duration >20 ms.134 If there is no progression in these parameters, the wire can be removed the following morning.
  - **ii.** A post‐procedure ECG should be reviewed to ascertain the likelihood of needing a permanent pacemaker (PPM).135 Generally, PPM implantation is indicated for patients with complete heart block, and further monitoring and possibly an electrophysiologic evaluation should be considered to evaluate the need for a PPM if there are pre‐existing conduction abnormalities (QRS >120 ms or first‐degree AVR block) with an increase >20 ms in the PR or QRS intervals, or a RBBB or LBBB with a QRS >150 ms or PR interval >240 ms.

- **iii.** Some patients may develop advanced heart block after 48 hours, and this may develop after hospital discharge. Independent predictors of the development of late (>48h) advanced heart block are a baseline RBBB and the amount of increase in the PR length.136
- **iv.** The development of a new LBBB or the requirement for a PPM has adverse effects on LV function, and both may impact survival, although the latter has not be noted in all studies.137,138
- **v.** A follow‐up study reported that only 40% of patients receiving a PPM within 10 days after TAVR were pacer‐dependent at one year, and this was more likely to occur in patients receiving self‐expanding valves.139
- **d. Renal function.** Contrast used during the procedure can contribute to acute kidney injury, especially in elderly patients with compromised renal function. A similar fluid protocol to that used during cardiac catheterization, which may be based on the patient's LVEDP that is measured when the valve is crossed, should be used (see page 688).
- **e. Mental status** can be influenced by the use of anesthesia or sedatives, including dexmedetomidine, which is commonly used for deep sedation. Elderly patients may be very sensitive to medications and have delayed clearance. Depressed mental status may lead to hypoxemia and hypercarbia during recovery from sedation or after extubation, so careful monitoring of pulse oximetry and respiratory effort is mandatory until the patient is more alert. Delirium is noted more commonly in patients with AF, NYHA class III/IV, dementia, and nonfemoral TAVRs (usually done under general anesthesia), with delirium noted in 7% with a femoral approach vs. 21% with a nonfemoral approach in one study.140 Although postprocedure delirium may be associated with increased mortality, after adjusting for other postoperative events, it was not found to be an independent predictor of mortality.141
- **f. Neurologic deficits** have decreased in incidence to about 2% with improvements in transcatheter valve design and delivery systems.142 However, MRI studies have demonstrated new ischemic lesions in more than 75% of patients,143 although they are generally not associated with immediate neurocognitive decline. Use of cerebral embolic protection devices may reduce the volume and size of embolic material, but these devices have not reduced the incidence of new lesions or improved neurologic outcome.143,144
- **g. Anticoagulation** is recommended following TAVR to reduce the risk of thromboembolism. A 300–600 mg load of clopidogrel is given along with aspirin 81 mg a few hours after the procedure, followed by clopidogrel 75 mg daily for six months and aspirin 81 mg daily indefinitely. However, a few studies have found that DAPT increases the risk of bleeding without any impact on the risk of stroke and may therefore be unnecessary.145,146 In patients with AF, warfarin or a non‐vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC) is recommended without an antiplatelet medication. The GALILEO study comparing rivaroxaban + aspirin with clopidogrel + aspirin in patients without AF showed that rivaroxaban reduced the incidence of subclinical leaflet thrombosis, but increased the risk of bleeding, thromboembolism, and death. Thus, this study indicated that use of a NOAC plus aspirin cannot be recommended in the absence of AF, but it did not address whether a NOAC alone was noninferior to aspirin plus clopidogrel in these patients.147

**h. Bleeding.** Most TAVR procedures are performed transfemorally, and assessment for femoral arterial or venous bleeding causing a hematoma or thigh ecchymosis is important. Distal pulses should also be assessed, because closure devices (Perclose ProGlide [Abbott] and Angio‐Seal [Terumo]) may produce moderate compromise of the femoral access site. Elderly TAVR patients often have poor‐quality, calcified vessels that are more prone to bleeding, especially with the early institution of antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulants. Hemodynamic instability may lead to suspicion of a retroperitoneal hematoma with transfemoral or transcaval access, prompting evaluation by a CT scan (see Figure 2.38, page 163). A chest wall hematoma from percutaneous transaxillary access or intrapleural bleeding with a transapical approach should be considered in the unstable patient.

#### **3. Aortic regurgitation**

- **a.** Aortic regurgitation (AR) produces both volume and pressure overload of the LV, resulting in a dilated and frequently hypertrophied chamber. Maintenance of a supraventricular rhythm is important. Filling pressures often rise minimally despite large fluid challenges because of the enlarged, compliant LV, although the cardiac output will usually improve.
- **b.** Despite the placement of a competent aortic valvular prosthesis, most patients with AR remain vasodilated after surgery and require the use of an α‐agent, such as phenylephrine or norepinephrine, to maintain a satisfactory blood pressure. Systolic hypertension is often better controlled with β‐blockers than with vasodilators.
- **4. Heart block** may complicate a SAVR because of edema, hemorrhage, suturing, or debridement near the conduction system, which lies adjacent to the base of the right coronary cusp near the commissure with the noncoronary cusp.
  - **a.** Preoperative conduction system disease (first‐degree block, left anterior hemiblock, RBBB, or LBBB) has been shown to be a risk factor for heart block in most studies.148,149 Other risk factors for heart block requiring a PPM include procedures that require more manipulation in the region of the conduction system (endocarditis, reoperations, bicuspid valves, annular calcification) and the presence of AR, septal hypertrophy, larger end‐systolic diameters, longer pump times, and preexisting hypertension.148–150 The incidence of bundle branch blocks and complete heart block is much higher following implantation of rapid‐deployment valves (23% for the Sorin Perceval and 14% for Edwards Intuity in separate studies).151–153
  - **b.** Both the presence of a bundle branch block and the necessity for a PPM early after surgical AVR (noted in about 5% of patients) have adverse prognostic significance, with a compromise in long‐term survival.154–156
- **5.** On rare occasions, the sewing ring of the valve may compromise flow into the left or right coronary ostium. This should be identified by the surgeon prior to closing the aorta, but if not, there is usually evidence of severe RV or LV dysfunction or ventricular arrhythmias upon termination of bypass. This problem must be addressed at the time of surgery. If not, a postoperative ECG may show significant ischemia, although this may be obscured by the presence of LVH or a bundle branch block pattern. Coronary embolization of residual calcium fragments or

even small amounts of thrombus forming on sutures or the sewing ring may also produce evidence of ischemia.

# **6. Anticoagulation (ACC and European 2017 guidelines)**157,158

- **a. Tissue aortic valves:** most surgeons implanting tissue aortic valves do so to avoid the use of anticoagulant therapy since the evidence supporting the superiority of a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) such as warfarin over aspirin is weak.159 Hence antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 75–100 mg once daily is commonly used and is a level IIa recommendation in the European guidelines.158 However, because of some evidence that the risk of stroke and subclinical leaflet thrombosis is greater during the initial 3–6 postoperative months, the 2017 ACC updated guidelines give a level IIa recommendation ("is reasonable") to use a VKA with a target INR of 2.5 for "at least three months and for as long as six months" if the patient is at low risk for bleeding.157 Aspirin also received a level IIa recommendation, and it was not specified whether the recommendation was to use either aspirin or a VKA or both together. These guidelines did give a level IIa recommendation to use aspirin indefinitely. The European guidelines give a level IIb indication for a VKA and recommend it for three months.158 These guidelines reflect the uncertainty of the preferable medication in patients at low risk for thromboembolism. Previous recommendations were to use warfarin for patients at high risk, including AF, a prior thromboembolic event, EF <35% or a hypercoagulable state. It may be feasible to use a NOAC for patients receiving tissue valves as an alternative to warfarin, but preferably after three months if the patient is in AF.160
- **b. Mechanical aortic valves:** all patients with current‐generation single tilting‐ disc or bileaflet aortic valves should receive warfarin indefinitely to achieve a target INR of 2.5 (1.5–2.0 for On‐X valves). The ACC guidelines also recommend aspirin 75–100 mg, but the European guidelines only recommend aspirin if there has been a thromboembolic event at a therapeutic INR or there is concomitant atherosclerotic disease. The 2017 ACC guidelines recommend a target INR of 3.0 if any of the above‐mentioned additional risk factors for thromboembolism are present.157
- **c.** In patients receiving mechanical valves, there is a potential increased risk of thromboembolism in the early postoperative period when the patient is not therapeutically anticoagulated. Therefore, use of heparin is recommended until the INR becomes therapeutic. However, the timing of initiation of heparin as a bridge is not well defined. Early postoperative use of either unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low‐molecular‐weight heparin (LMWH) 1 mg/kg bid is effective, but both increase the risk of cardiac tamponade.161,162 Since patients are generally hypocoagulable and often thrombocytopenic for several days after surgery, a safe approach would be to give aspirin as soon as mediastinal bleeding is minimal, give warfarin the night of surgery, and then start either heparin product on the 3rd–5th postoperative day if the INR is less than 1.8. The heparin is continued until the INR is >2.0 for two consecutive days. A bridge is important after hospital discharge if the INR is still <2.0 in a patient with a mechanical valve, AF, or a hypercoagulable disorder. Use of a NOAC is contraindicated as the anticoagulant for patients receiving a mechanical valve.163

#### **E. Mitral valve surgery**

- **1. Mitral stenosis (MS).** Most patients with MS have a small LV cavity with preserved function. They are prone to a low cardiac output syndrome following surgery because of small LV end‐diastolic and end‐systolic volumes. Maintenance of adequate filling pressures is essential to ensure a satisfactory stroke volume, especially in patients with permanent AF. The "ideal" filling pressure varies for each patient, depending on the level of preexisting PH and the degree of its reversibility. Generally, there is a substantial reduction in PA pressures postoperatively, even in patients with severe preoperative PH, and this may translate into a greater reduction in associated tricuspid regurgitation.164 One study found that, for patients with severe PH, the use of IV NTG, induced hypocarbia, and longer ventilation times were associated with a significant reduction in PA pressures, improved cardiac outputs and improved oxygenation, with comparable results to patients without severe PH.165
  - **a.** Hemodynamic support may be required for RV dysfunction. Use of dobutamine and milrinone are most effective, but the use of pulmonary vasodilators, such as inhaled epoprostenol (Flolan) or nitric oxide, may also be beneficial.
  - **b.** Postoperative ventilatory failure is not uncommon in patients with chronic MS as a result of PH, fluid overload, and chronic cachexia with poor ventilatory reserve. Aggressive diuresis, nutritional support, and a plan for ventilatory support and weaning are essential.
  - **c.** Most patients with MS are diuretic‐dependent. Despite correction of their valvular abnormality, they often require substantial doses of diuretics during the hospital stay to achieve their preoperative weight. They should be maintained on diuretics for several months after discharge.
  - **d.** A Maze procedure should be considered in any patient undergoing mitral valve surgery with AF. However, this procedure may not be effective in patients with long‐standing permanent AF or a markedly enlarged left atrium, and atrial inactivity may remain even if successful. A rapid ventricular response to AF will reduce LV filling and lower cardiac outputs, and should usually be managed by a calcium channel blocker or low‐dose ß‐blocker. Additional comments on the Maze procedure are provided in section III.E.7, pages 397–399.
  - **e.** Anticoagulation following mitral surgery is noted in section III.E.9, pages 399–400.
- **2. Mitral regurgitation (MR)** reduces LV wall stress by systolic unloading through the regurgitant valve. An EF in the normal range may represent early LV dysfunction, supporting the concept of early mitral valve repair for asymptomatic patients with severe MR.166 When mitral valve competence has been restored, eliminating low pressure unloading, there may be unmasking of LV dysfunction because of the greater systolic wall stress required to achieve forward ejection. Although wall stress may be attenuated to some degree by a reduction in preload, this newly created "afterload mismatch" may result in LV failure, requiring inotropic support and systemic unloading with vasodilators.
  - **a.** A reduction in LVEF should be anticipated after surgery, whether MR is addressed by mitral valve repair or mitral valve replacement (MVR) with preservation of the subchordal apparatus. This decline is more prominent in

- patients with large left ventricular end‐diastolic dimensions (LVEDD), lower EFs, more advanced NYHA class, large left atria, and AF. It was found that, after surgery, the LVEDD decreased due to reduced volume overload, but the left ventricular end‐systolic diameter (LVESD) remained the same, resulting in a reduction in EF.167
- **b.** Postoperative LV dysfunction is common when there is evidence of preoperative LV dysfunction (EF <40%), LV dilatation (LVESD >19 mm/m2 ), an RV systolic pressure >45 mm Hg, or an ischemic etiology of the MR.168,169 One study reported that the postoperative EF recovered to preoperative levels in only two‐thirds of patients with a preoperative EF >50% and in only one‐ third of patients with a preoperative EF <50%.166 Thus, one can anticipate hemodynamic issues after surgery in any patient with a dilated, dysfunctional LV preoperatively, and even in those with documented "normal" LV function as well.166 Use of TEE with speckle tracking to determine LV strain measurements may be useful in identifying LV dysfunction despite preserved preoperative EF.170 One study found that EF normalized after surgery only in patients with an EF >65% and an LVESD <36 mm.171
- **c.** Current guidelines for surgery reflect these concerns that long‐term results will be compromised by delaying surgery until symptoms or LV dysfunction develop. Nonetheless, LV dysfunction remains a significant issue after mitral valve surgery. Notably, patients requiring valve replacement for mitral valve endocarditis often require excision of the entire subvalvular apparatus, leading to even worse LV function.
- **d.** On rare occasions, LV dysfunction may be attributable to inadvertent circumferential entrapment of the circumflex coronary artery during suture placement, either for valve repair or replacement (usually in left‐dominant circulations) or during a left atrial reduction procedure.172 This should be identifiable by significant regional wall motion abnormalities on TEE and by ECG changes in the distribution of the artery.
- **3.** Management of **left ventricular dysfunction** after MV surgery for MR entails optimizing preload, providing inotropic support, and reducing afterload.
  - **a.** To optimize the systemic output, the LV volume status usually has to be maintained at fairly high levels. Administering a large quantity of fluid is frequently required because of increased left atrial and ventricular chamber size and compliance. In the presence of concomitant RV dysfunction, this can be problematic, because attempts to achieve adequate left‐sided filling may lead to progressive RV dilatation and failure, with subsequent impairment in LV filling. Careful monitoring of CVP and RV end‐diastolic volumes with volumetric Swan‐Ganz catheters may indicate when fluid challenges are detrimental rather than beneficial.
  - **b.** Assessment of LV end‐diastolic volumes requires echocardiographic evaluation because of the imprecise correlation with Swan‐Ganz catheter pressure measurements. It is generally best to correlate the PAD pressure with direct observation of LV volumes by TEE at the conclusion of surgery. This can establish a baseline from which trends can be identified in the ICU.
  - **c.** The extent of reversibility of preexisting PH is unpredictable, and PAD pressures may not correlate well with the volume status of the LV. The PCWP is

- more accurate than PAD pressures, especially in patients with a high transpulmonary gradient (PA mean pressure minus PCWP), but "wedging" of the balloon is ill advised in patients with PH. Left atrial pressures measured through a left atrial line provide the most accurate assessment of LV volume status, but these are rarely used.
- **d.** Inotropic support is usually selected to support both RV and LV function, since most patients with mitral valve disease have some degree of PH causing RV dilatation and dysfunction. Use of epinephrine or dobutamine and the addition of milrinone, as necessary, is the best approach. Milrinone is effective as an "inodilator" that can also reduce afterload to improve forward flow with a competent mitral valve. If the blood pressure is elevated, use of clevidipine or nitroprusside is helpful in reducing systemic resistance. If the patient still has a low output state, unloading with an IABP is helpful.
- **4. Right ventricular dysfunction** is not uncommon following mitral valve surgery, especially in patients with preexisting PH.173 RV failure may be precipitated by poor myocardial protection or factors that increase RV afterload. These include positive‐pressure ventilation, increased extravascular lung water, blood and blood component transfusions, blood gas and acid–base abnormalities, and reversible pulmonary vascular spasm associated with perfusion‐related phenomena and the systemic inflammatory response. In the OR, various TEE measurements can be used to identify RV dysfunction, which include RV fractional area change (FAC) <35% or a tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) <16 mm.174 However, once the patient is transferred to the ICU, assessment of RV function is more difficult. Volumetric Swan‐Ganz catheters that measure RVEF and end‐ diastolic volumes may be helpful.
  - **a.** Isolated RV dysfunction may be present at times and is manifested by a high CVP, variable PA pressures, a hypovolemic LV, and a low cardiac output. However, these hemodynamic parameters may be influenced by the presence of LV dysfunction or preexisting PH (causing an elevated PA pressure), inability to calculate a thermodilution cardiac output (due to the presence of residual TR), inaccuracy of the FloTrac system (if in AF), and lack of continuous echo monitoring.
  - **b.** The initial management of RV dysfunction is fluid administration to optimize preload. However, if the CVP rises above 20 mm Hg without achieving a satisfactory cardiac output, further volume should not be given. This may cause further deterioration of RV function and also impair LV filling by producing a septal shift.
  - **c.** Inotropic drugs should be given to support both RV and LV performance. Preferably, those that can also reduce the PVR, such as milrinone, should be chosen. Low‐dose epinephrine or dobutamine may be helpful. Probably the strongest drug to improve RV performance is isoproterenol, which is commonly used following heart transplantation, but its utility may be limited by a significant tachycardia.
  - **d.** In patients with severe RV dysfunction, selective pulmonary vasodilators may improve RV function by lowering RV afterload. IV NTG is effective in reducing preload, although it also produces systemic vasodilation at higher doses. Selective pulmonary vasodilators include inhaled nitric oxide (20–40 ppm

- through the ventilator), inhaled epoprostenol (Flolan) (up to 50 ng/kg/min), inhaled iloprost (Ventavis) (25 μg of a 20 μg/mL mixture via nebulizer), inhaled milrinone (5 mg bolus in the endotracheal tube), or oral sildenafil.175–181 Additional comments on the management of RV failure are noted on pages 530–534.
- **5.** Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) has been described following MVR due to strut malposition in the outflow tract, especially in patients with small LV cavities or septal hypertrophy. It may also occur when there has been retention of the anterior mitral leaflet.182 In many patients, the obstruction requires an additional procedure, but in some, it can be minimized by volume infusions and avoidance of β‐agonists. Systolic anterior motion (SAM) producing LVOTO is most commonly noted following mitral valve repair when there is excess posterior leaflet height. If this does not respond to volume, stopping catecholamines and increasing systemic resistance, it may require revision of the repair with a "sliding plasty" technique to lower posterior leaflet height.183 SAM is commonly noted preoperatively in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy due to mitral–septal apposition with a hypertrophied basal septum. This produces not only outflow tract obstruction but also MR from incomplete leaflet apposition as the leaflet is displaced anteriorly and pulled into the outflow tract. With an adequate extended septal myectomy, SAM and MR should be eliminated, but, if persistent, additional subvalvular surgery may be indicated. If organic MR is present, a MVR may be necessary.184
- **6.** Maintenance of **sinus rhythm** is beneficial to optimize cardiac output after mitral valve surgery, although it is not as critical as in hypertrophied hearts. Faster heart rates are preferable in volume‐overloaded hearts to reduce diastolic filling, which, by reducing wall stress, may improve systolic emptying.
  - **a.** It is controversial whether exposure to the mitral valve through the dome of the left atrium (superior approach), the superior transseptal approach which divides the sinus node artery, or a biatrial transseptal approach with or without connecting the atrial incisions ("minitransseptal" approach) is associated with more junctional rhythms or an increased need for pacemakers than the standard posterior left atriotomy approach.185–187 Nonetheless, it is not uncommon to have some difficulty with atrial pacing despite preoperative sinus rhythm with transseptal approaches.
  - **b.** In patients with long‐standing persistent AF, it is frequently possible to atrially or AV pace the heart for several hours or days after surgery, but most patients will revert back to AF. Maintenance of sinus rhythm beyond the early postoperative period is highly unlikely when AF has been present for more than one year or the left atrial dimension exceeds 50 mm. β‐blockers or calcium channel blockers may be used for rate control, but medications to maintain sinus rhythm, such as amiodarone, are generally not indicated in patients with long‐standing persistent AF.
- **7.** Because the presence of AF with degenerative MR compromises long‐term survival with or without mitral valve reparative surgery,188 the Cox‐Maze IV (CMIV) procedure using radiofrequency and cryoablation technologies (see Figures 1.28 and 1.29, pages 85 and 86) can be used to treat paroxysmal or persistent AF. Although widely adopted as a simpler procedure than the "cut‐and‐sew"

Cox‐Maze III (CMIII), freedom from recurrent AF does appear to be superior with the latter. These procedures are most commonly performed as an adjunct to mitral valve surgery. Bilateral pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) with resection and oversewing of the left atrial appendage is an acceptable operation for paroxysmal AF, but additional ablation lines within the left atrium are essential for persistent AF. Biatrial Maze procedures may produce greater freedom from recurrent AF, but this has not been uniformly demonstrated.189,190

- **a.** Sinus node (SN) dysfunction or high‐grade AV block may be present after the Cox‐Maze procedures, so it is essential that epicardial atrial and ventricular pacing wires are functional at the conclusion of surgery. Subsequently, careful follow‐up for recurrence of AF or the development of SN dysfunction or AV block is important to optimize long‐term outcomes.
  - **i.** A study from an experienced arrhythmia center found that PPMs were implanted in 5 and 11% of patients undergoing lone and concomitant CMIV procedures, respectively, mostly due to SN dysfunction which appeared unlikely to recover.191 Their data contrasted with previously reported PPM rates of 8 and 23% for lone and concomitant CMIII procedures. Thus, there is a tradeoff of a lower need for PPM vs. a higher AF recurrence rate with the CMIV procedure.
  - **ii.** However, other studies have reported an even higher rate of PPM after Maze procedures, which in fact increased one‐year mortality.192 A study from the Cardiothoracic Surgery Network of patients undergoing mitral valve surgery with preoperative AF reported that, at one year, pacemakers were required in 7.8% of patients after isolated mitral valve surgery alone, but in 16% after mitral valve surgery with PVI and in 25% after mitral valve surgery with a biatrial Maze. The primary risk factors were advanced NYHA class, multivalve surgery, and performing a biatrial Maze. Nearly 83% of patients who required a PPM received it during their initial hospitalization, the indications being equally divided between SN dysfunction and high‐grade AV block. These data also reiterate the importance of placing and utilizing pacemaker wires immediately after surgery to optimize hemodynamics.
- **b.** Recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmias (ATAs) during the early postoperative period is quite common after a Maze procedure, especially in older patients, but it does not appear to correlate with the late recurrence of AF, since the mechanism triggering the AF differs.
  - **i.** One report of patients undergoing "cut‐and‐sew" Maze procedures found a 43% incidence of postoperative ATA, with equal incidence in those with persistent and paroxysmal AF. AF was present in 59% of patients, atrial flutter in 14%, and both in 27%. With initiation of antiarrhythmic drugs once ATA developed, ATAs persisted for more than five days in 21% of patients, but lasted over two weeks in less than 3% of patients.193
  - **ii.** Since this study found a correlation of ATA with the duration of aortic cross‐clamping and CPB, it might be inferred that expediting the procedure with a CMIV approach might reduce the incidence of postop AF. There was also no protocol to initiate amiodarone prior to the development of ATAs, which might have reduced their occurrence. Generally,

- amiodarone is recommended prophylactically and continued for about 3–6 months. If the patient reverts to AF, a cardioversion should be attempted after three months. Generally, if a patient had been in AF for more than five years prior to a CMIV, the three‐year freedom from AF is only about 55%.194
- **iii.** Both right and left atrial flutter have been noted to occur after Maze procedures and may require an endocardial ablation.195
- **c.** After a Maze procedure, anticoagulation with warfarin or a NOAC is given for about six months and can be safely stopped at that time if synchronous atrial contractions are noted on echocardiogram. However, ongoing monitoring is required because AF has about a 15% recurrence rate at five years and may be greater in older patients and those with longer durations of AF.196 The decision to stop anticoagulation must be individualized, taking into account the patient's bleeding risk and echo findings, not just their CHADS2 score.197 If the patient desires to be off of, or has a contraindication to, anticoagulation with evidence of AF recurrence, a Watchman device should be offered. However, some form of anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy is recommended for a short course after implantation.198
- **8.** The acute onset of exsanguinating bleeding through the chest tubes or the development of tamponade soon after a MVR suggests the possibility of **left ventricular rupture**. This may occur at the AV groove, at the base of the papillary muscles, or in between. This problem can be avoided by meticulous surgical technique (especially if there is mitral annular calcification), chordal preservation during MVR, and avoiding tissue valves in patients with very small LV chambers (usually in elderly women with MS). LV rupture may be precipitated by LV distention or excessive afterload after bypass. Once identified, emergency surgical intervention on bypass is required and carries a significant mortality rate.199

#### **9. Anticoagulation**

- **a. Mitral annuloplasty rings.** There are insufficient data to determine whether aspirin is an acceptable alternative to a VKA following ring annuloplasties for patients in sinus rhythm. Some studies have shown that aspirin alone is sufficient,200 yet both the ESC and ACC/AHA guidelines recommend three months of warfarin, albeit based on very limited evidence.157,158 One rationale for using warfarin is that many of these patients will develop AF during the early postoperative period for which they should be on a VKA. If the patient has AF beyond three months, warfarin is recommended, but NOACs may be a reasonable alternative despite lack of confirmatory data.
- **b. Tissue mitral valves.** Guidelines on anticoagulation are essentially identical for tissue valves in the aortic and mitral position.157 Thus, 3–6 months of a VKA given with aspirin is recommended per the ACC guidelines157 and three months of a VKA is recommended per the European guidelines.158 Similar to aortic tissue valves, one might consider initiating heparin before the INR becomes therapeutic, usually starting heparin on the 4th–5th postoperative day and continuing it until the INR exceeds 1.8 if the patient is in sinus rhythm. After three months, aspirin may be substituted if the patient remains in sinus rhythm. A VKA is recommended if the patient remains in AF after three months, with limited evidence supporting use of a NOAC.160

**c. Mechanical mitral valves.** Aspirin is given on the first postoperative day along with warfarin to achieve a target INR of 3.0. The warfarin is continued indefinitely with aspirin 75–100 mg per the ACC guidelines to further reduce the thromboembolic risk.157 The European guidelines only recommend the addition of aspirin if there has been a thromboembolic event at a therapeutic INR or there is concomitant atherosclerotic disease.158 Heparin should be started around the fourth postoperative day if the INR is <2.0 and should be given until the INR is >2.0 for two consecutive days, and this can easily be accomplished using LMWH in the hospital and as an outpatient. It should be reemphasized that early postoperative initiation of either UFH or LMWH may increase the risk of tamponade, although some surgical groups do recommend very early initiation of anticoagulation in these patients.

#### **F. Minimally invasive/robotic surgery**

- **1.** Procedures performed through small incisions limit surgical exposure to the heart. Since all minimally invasive valve procedures and some totally endoscopic/robotic coronary bypass grafting are performed on‐pump, CPB‐related problems, whether pulmonary, cardiac, or renal in nature, are similar to those noted above for specific valve pathology. However, there are a few specific issues that may arise in these patients.
- **2.** Pain control is essential following ministernotomy and rib‐spreading procedures. Similar to MIDCABs, use of epidural analgesia or intercostal blocks can optimize patient comfort and pulmonary status.
- **3.** Access to the RV is limited, making placement of pacemaker wires somewhat difficult. The ability to pace the heart using pacing pads (which are fairly uncomfortable) or using a ventricular pacing wire placed through a Swan‐Ganz Paceport catheter is useful.
- **4.** Placement of chest tubes may not be ideal, because of exposure limitations. Usually one pleural and one anterior mediastinal tube are placed, but they may not provide ideal drainage. It is essential to be alert to the potential for undetected accumulation of blood in the pleural space or for the development of tamponade when the patient is hemodynamically unstable.
- **5.** Although some minimally invasive incisions allow for central aortic and venous cannulation, all robotic cases and other minimally invasive cases with limited exposure require alternative cannulation sites – usually the femoral artery and/or vein. The presence of aortoiliac disease, tortuosity with calcification, very small femoral arteries, or thoracic or abdominal aneurysmal disease generally contraindicates femoral cannulation, so axillary or central cannulation must be used. Insertion of a femoral cannula is accomplished by direct cutdown or percutaneous placement. Following decannulation, the artery is repaired under direct vision unless placed percutaneously. The potential for hemorrhage, femoral artery injury, development of an AV fistula or false aneurysm, focal thrombosis, or distal atheroembolism exists. It is absolutely essential that distal perfusion be assessed at the conclusion of surgery by pulse or Doppler examination.
- **6.** Because these operations can be tedious, especially in the early part of the learning curve, the bypass run may be quite long, often over four hours. This could potentially lead to a lower‐extremity compartment syndrome. Since the anesthetized patient cannot complain of pain or sensory changes or exhibit motor function,

assessment of calf size and tenseness at the conclusion of surgery and in the ICU on a frequent basis is essential to recognize the very early stages of a compartment syndrome. Early fasciotomy can salvage muscle and limb function; delayed fasciotomy may be the first step towards an amputation.

#### **G. Aortic dissections**

- **1.** Virtually all patients with dissections that involve the ascending aorta (type A dissections) undergo surgical repair (see Figure 1.23, page 75). The reestablishment of vascular continuity involves suturing of a Dacron graft to very fragile tissues, often supplemented with PTFE felt, and suture‐line bleeding is commonly noted. In addition, surgical repair is predicated on stabilization of the entry site of the dissection, but this does not completely eliminate the distal false channel or a distal exit site, which may then be converted to an entry site. Thus surgery is palliative and leaves the patient predisposed to distal aneurysm formation in the future.
- **2.** Aggressive management of hypertension following surgery is just as important as preoperative control, although the primary indication after surgery is to protect suture lines and minimize bleeding. Similar antihypertensive medications should be used to reduce systolic blood pressure and the force of cardiac contraction (dp/ dt). The most common regimens are a β‐blocker (IV esmolol, metoprolol, or labetalol) alone or in combination with clevidipine or nitroprusside. The patient is then converted to oral metoprolol or labetalol with use of additional antihypertensives, such as calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs as necessary. The risk of subsequent aneurysmal disease in the descending aorta is reduced with the use of β‐blockers, reinforcing that heart rate control is an important component of postoperative long‐term care.201 This is also true for patients with type B dissections (not involving the ascending aorta), in whom control of both blood pressure and heart rate reduces the frequency of aortic events, including distal ischemia, recurrent dissection, expansion, and aortic rupture.202
- **3.** The repair of a type A dissection usually involves a period of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) while the distal anastomosis is performed. The extensive period of profound cooling and rewarming may be associated with a significant coagulopathy, but bleeding can be minimized by use of felt reinforcement at the suture lines and use of tissue adhesives, such as BioGlue. Early and aggressive use of blood products is indicated if a coagulopathy is suspected to be the cause of significant bleeding, but early re‐exploration is indicated for suspected surgical bleeding.
- **4.** Careful preoperative and postoperative neurologic assessments are important to distinguish a preoperative neurologic deficit from a new stroke. Although antegrade and retrograde cerebral perfusion can be used to provide neuroprotection during the period of DHCA, the occurrence of a stroke may be related to the use of circulatory arrest, cerebral malperfusion on CPB, or air or atheroembolism.203 Although femoral cannulation would seemingly increase the risk of retrograde malperfusion, and axillary cannulation can provide unilateral cerebral perfusion during a period of DHCA, outcomes are fairly similar with either cannulation site.204 Distal perfusion in the cannulated limb (leg or arm) must be assessed following the procedure.
- **5.** For type B dissections, medical therapy is associated with a 95% hospital survival rate, and interventions are usually reserved for patients with "complicated" dissections,

defined as those with refractory pain or hypertension, evidence of expansion, leaking or rupture, or malperfusion.205–207 Surgical repairs have high mortality and substantial potential morbidity, including respiratory failure and problems related to aortic cross‐ clamping or malperfusion (renal failure and paraplegia). Therefore, thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is the preferred approach to promote thrombosis of the false lumen, although it may still be associated with paraplegia. Patients with uncomplicated type B dissections who are considered at high risk for potential expansion may also be considered for early TEVAR.208 Careful preoperative assessment of branch artery flow is essential, and fenestration or branch artery stenting/grafting may be necessary if there is mesenteric or renal ischemia. A careful preoperative and postoperative neurologic examination of the lower extremities, and measures to support renal function in the perioperative period, are important. Other comments on management after descending thoracic aortic surgery are noted in section I.

## **H. Ascending aortic and arch aneurysms**

- **1.** Ascending aortic aneurysms may be associated with normal or dysfunctional bicuspid or trileaflet valves, and may involve or spare the sinuses of Valsalva. The extent of involvement dictates the type of operative procedure.
  - **a.** When there is an indication for AVR due to AS or AR, the procedure may be a root replacement using a valved conduit, which incorporates either a mechanical or tissue valve at the proximal end of the graft, or a stentless miniroot or homograft. If the sinuses are not involved, an AVR and supracoronary graft will be placed, sparing the proximal aortic segment from which the coronary arteries arise. If the sinuses are dilated but valve function is relatively preserved, a valve‐sparing root procedure can be performed.
  - **b.** In addition to postoperative concerns noted following AVR for AS or AR, the two concerns after ascending aortic surgery are bleeding and issues related to coronary button implantation, which is performed during root replacements or valve‐sparing root procedures. Strict control of hypertension is essential to minimize bleeding, and aggressive steps to control a coagulopathy should be taken starting intraoperatively to minimize bleeding from the suture lines. If there is compromise of coronary blood flow due to kinking of the proximal coronary arteries, ECG changes or ventricular dysfunction should be evident in the OR, but it may also occur later. A careful review of the postoperative ECG is essential to identify this problem.
- **2.** For aneurysms limited to the ascending aorta, cannulation sites for CPB include the proximal arch, the femoral artery (in the absence of significant distal atherosclerosis), or the axillary artery. It is important to confirm satisfactory distal flow in the limb beyond the cannulation site after decannulation. The risk of stroke is low, but it may occur if there is atherosclerotic disease at the level of the aortic cross‐clamp or in the thoracic or abdominal aorta that could embolize retrograde during femoral perfusion.
- **3.** For aneurysms extending to the proximal arch that require DHCA, the ascending aorta is cannulated. During these procedures, ACP, either directly or through the axillary artery, or RCP through the superior vena cava, can be utilized to optimize neuroprotection during the period of circulatory arrest.209 Although some surgeons use cold ACP with moderate (25 °C) systemic perfusion to eliminate some

- of the issues related to deep hypothermia, this may not be safe in older patients with long DHCA times and multiple comorbidities.210 An alternative approach in aortic arch surgery is a "debranching" operation, which restores cerebral flow to individual arch vessels before the distal aortic anastomosis is sewn. This may limit the duration of DHCA and optimize cerebral protection.211
- **4.** Following operations using DHCA, neurologic recovery can be expedited using short‐acting medications, but this may take up to 24 hours in some patients. The anesthetic agents and postoperative protocols for sedation and control of hypertension should acknowledge plans for a slightly prolonged duration of ventilation. It is enticing to promptly awaken the patient to assess a response to verbal commands and motor function of all extremities, but this could result in a period of inadequate analgesia and hypertension that is best avoided. The maintenance of adequate cerebral oximetry during the early rewarming phase from DHCA has been shown to reduce the incidence of delayed awakening.212
- **5.** Use of DHCA to 18 °C requires a substantial time to rewarm to normothermia, because it is important to maintain a perfusion temperature gradient of <10 °C between venous return and arterial inflow. Despite active rewarming to 37 °C on bypass, significant temperature afterdrop is common, and a temperature‐controlling device during surgery (Bair Hugger or Kimberly‐Clark) and a forced‐air system in the ICU (Bair Hugger) should be used. Coagulopathies are commonly present and require aggressive management to minimize mediastinal bleeding. The duration of DHCA correlates with perioperative bleeding and the need for transfusions, and both are risk factors for postoperative ARDS.213,214

# **I. Descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aneurysms**

- **1.** Surgical repairs of descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aneurysms are complex operations fraught with a significant incidence of postoperative complications involving numerous organ systems.
- **2.** Surgery involves a thoracotomy incision and often takedown of the diaphragm. Extensive blood loss requiring massive transfusions of blood is not uncommon and usually produces a coagulopathy requiring multiple blood components and often a re‐exploration. Prolonged ventilation should be anticipated and medications selected accordingly. The extensive incisions required for these operations can produce significant pain that requires adequate analgesia. More than 10% of patients undergoing these repairs may require a postoperative tracheostomy for prolonged ventilatory support.
- **3.** Cross‐clamping of the descending aorta can result in paraplegia or renal failure, even if distal perfusion is provided during the cross‐clamp period. Because hypoperfusion due to reduced collateral flow and ischemic intolerance is considered the mechanism producing spinal cord ischemia, intraoperative blood pressure management (avoidance of hypotension) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage initiated before surgery are important to improve spinal cord perfusion pressure.215–218 The drain is left in place for up three days after surgery to keep the CSF pressure less than 10 mm Hg. A mean arterial pressure of at least 90 mm Hg should be maintained with an understanding that this could worsen bleeding. Particular attention to a pre‐ and postoperative neurologic evaluation on a daily basis is essential.

- **4. Delayed onset of paraplegia** occurring in the ICU may develop after several days and is actually more common than immediate postoperative paraplegia even when protective steps, including distal perfusion, CSF drainage, or circulatory arrest, are used.219–221 It is usually, but not always, triggered by an episode of hypotension. If recognized immediately, it is usually reversible with elevation of the systemic blood pressure to a mean pressure of 95 mm Hg, and reinsertion of the CSF drain if it has been removed, to reduce the CSF pressure to 10 mm Hg. High‐dose steroids might prove beneficial.
- **5.** Cross‐clamping of the aorta impairs renal perfusion and can produce acute kidney injury in 10–15% of patients. When it occurs, it is associated with a 40% mortality rate and compromises long‐term survival as well. Numerous strategies to reduce the risk of acute kidney injury have been tried with minimal success, but the most useful technique may be cold crystalloid renal perfusion with the addition of mannitol.222–225
- **6.** TEVAR has proven very beneficial in the management of descending thoracic aneurysms, with a substantially lower mortality rate. However, significant complications may still occur, related to access issues, thromboembolism, and ischemia due to branch artery coverage by the endograft.
  - **a.** The risk of spinal cord ischemia is reported to be as high as 13%, comparable to that of open repairs. Thus, repeated assessment of neurologic function is essential during the few days following surgery. Delayed paraplegia should be treated as noted in section I.4. Spinal cord ischemia is more common in patients with prior TEVAR or open aneurysm repairs, extensive coverage of the aorta, internal iliac occlusions, with lengthy procedures, and with perioperative hypotension.226–229 Intraoperative measures to reduce the risk of paraplegia include use of somatosensory evoked potentials,230 CSF drainage to maintain a pressure <10 mm Hg, moderate hypothermia to 34 °C, maintaining a mean arterial pressure >90 mm Hg, and use of naloxone (1 μg/kg/h), methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg), and mannitol 12.5 g.231
  - **b.** Acute kidney injury is noted in 10–15% of patients, increases operative mortality, and compromises survival, just as after open surgery. It is more common in those with preexisting chronic kidney disease, extensive thoracoabdominal surgery, use of multiple stents, intraoperative hypotension, and extensive blood loss requiring transfusions.232,233 The best management is proactive, using intravascular ultrasound and less contrast, optimizing hemodynamics, and minimizing blood loss.
  - **c.** Stroke has been noted in 4–8% of patients and usually results from embolization of mobile arch or descending aortic atheroma during stent positioning and deployment, especially with a very proximal landing zone. Treatment is supportive.228
  - **d.** Upper extremity ischemia may occur if the proximal landing zone occludes the left subclavian artery. This should be avoidable if a preliminary carotid–subclavian graft is performed.

#### **J. Left ventricular aneurysms and ventricular arrhythmia surgery**

**1.** Patients undergoing resection of a LV aneurysm usually have markedly depressed LV function. Although ventricular size and geometry are better preserved using the endoaneurysmorrhaphy or endoventricular circular patch plasty techniques than with a linear closure, the LV chamber size is reduced, and the stroke volume is usually lower after surgery. Achieving adequate filling pressures (usually a PCWP around 20–25 mm Hg) is essential to optimize stroke volume. Filling pressures may rise precipitously with minimal volume infusion because of the small noncompliant LV chamber. Many patients generate a satisfactory cardiac output by virtue of a faster heart rate, which should not be reduced pharmacologically unless the stroke volume is satisfactory. Hemodynamic support and an IABP are frequently necessary to allow weaning from CPB.

- **2.** Surgery for VT is relatively uncommon and usually involves blind endocardial resection with cryoablation. To minimize the risk of postoperative ventricular arrhythmias, lidocaine may be used prophylactically for 24 hours. Most of these patients will be candidates for postoperative ICD placement with or without electrophysiologic testing. Recurrent VT may be managed by an ablation procedure in an attempt to reduce the use of antiarrhythmic drugs.
- **3.** Transvenous or subcutaneous ICDs are usually placed in the electrophysiology lab in patients with sustained VT, other suspected life‐threatening arrhythmias, or prophylactically in patients with poor LV function.234 If the patient has had heart surgery and had a preoperative indication for the device (other than poor LV function), it is placed several days after surgery. Similarly, if the patient has poor ventricular function and develops nonsustained or sustained VT after surgery, an ICD may be considered before hospital discharge. Otherwise, guidelines recommend that ICD placement should be delayed 90 days after surgery with reassessment of LV function, which may have improved. However, because the risk of sudden death remains elevated in patients with impaired LV function, it is not unreasonable to recommend a LifeVest (ZOLL Medical Corporation) in the interim.235,236
- **4.** An ICD device is tested and usually left in the active mode. There should be a card posted above the head of the patient's bed indicating the status of the ICD so that anyone who responds to an emergency knows whether the device is activated or not. Generally, patients are placed on either β‐blockers or amiodarone if they have malignant ventricular arrhythmias, but long‐term use of the latter is not recommended due to numerous adverse effects.
