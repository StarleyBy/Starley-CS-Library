<div class="details-content">
Although the general nature of a patient's cardiac disease can usually be ascertained from a thorough history and physical examination, diagnostic tests are essential to define the pathology and extent of cardiac disease more precisely. A variety of noninvasive and invasive modalities can be used to identify the presence and severity of cardiovascular abnormalities that may require surgery. This chapter briefly reviews <span class="t-green">the basic types of diagnostic tests</span> available to the clinician and defines their role in preoperative evaluation. In‐depth discussions of several of these modalities with extensive references can be found on medical websites, including <span class="t-indigo">www.uptodate.com</span> and <span class="t-indigo">www.emedicine.medscape.com</span>.

### **II. Electrocardiography**

**A.** A 12‐lead ECG must be reviewed prior to surgery because it can yield valuable information about the nature of the patient's disease, the urgency of surgery, the appropriate management of arrhythmias, and other considerations in perioperative management.

#### **B. Common disorders of rate and rhythm**

- **1.** The presence of sinus tachycardia in a patient with coronary disease suggests that the patient is inadequately ß‐blocked. This may predispose the patient to the development of ischemia preoperatively and to atrial fibrillation (AF) after surgery. Most patients undergoing CABG should be managed preoperatively with ß‐blockers.
- **2.** Patients with sinus bradycardia usually require temporary postoperative pacing and may not tolerate ß‐blockers or amiodarone that might otherwise be used prophylactically to prevent postoperative AF. Patients with sick sinus or tachycardia/bradycardia syndrome are more likely to require a permanent pacemaker postoperatively.
- **3.** A rapid ventricular response to AF must be controlled pharmacologically. It can precipitate myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and can compromise the cardiac output in patients with significant LVH. If longstanding persistent AF has been present, the use of prophylactic medications to prevent postoperative AF is usually of little benefit, but postoperative anticoagulation is indicated to prevent a thromboembolic stroke. A Maze procedure may be considered as an adjunct to other cardiac operations in patients with either paroxysmal or persistent AF.
- **4.** Ventricular tachyarrhythmias may result from active ischemia or remote myocardial infarction. If revascularization is indicated, a postoperative electrophysiology study should be considered in patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). An implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator (ICD) should be inserted if VT is inducible or if the ejection fraction (EF) remains <35% 90 days after revascularization.

### **C. Conduction problems**

- **1.** Ischemic ECG changes are difficult to assess in the patient with a bundle branch block. Early catheterization may be indicated in patients with acute coronary syndromes considered at high risk based on clinical criteria.
- **2.** The presence of a left bundle branch block (LBBB) increases the risk of asystole during insertion of a Swan‐Ganz pulmonary artery (PA) catheter. This should be deferred until after the sternotomy has been performed so that immediate epicardial pacing can be achieved.
- **3.** Patients with a right bundle branch block (RBBB) and a first degree block are more prone to the development of complete heart block after TAVR and may require placement of a permanent pacemaker.
- **4.** The development of conduction abnormalities in a patient with aortic valve endocarditis suggests annular extension of the infection, which is an indication for urgent surgery.
- **5.** Patients sustaining an inferior infarction may develop heart block and require temporary pacing preoperatively.

#### **D. Evidence of ischemia and infarction**

**1.** ST and T wave changes consistent with ischemia require aggressive management. This may entail use of intravenous nitrates, antiplatelet agents (aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitors [clopidogrel, ticagrelor, prasugrel], and/or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors), unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin, and/or placement of an IABP. An early invasive strategy with urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or surgery is usually indicated. Evidence of recent infarction may influence the timing and risk of surgery. Waiting several days may lower the

- surgical risk in stable patients, but is inadvisable if the patient develops recurrent chest pain, ischemia, or cardiogenic shock, or has threatening coronary anatomy.
- **2.** In patients with depressed LV function, an ECG with Q waves is more consistent with transmural infarction, but the absence of Q waves suggests that the myocardium may be chronically ischemic and hibernating, rather than infarcted. Further evaluation with viability studies may be indicated to determine whether surgery will prove beneficial in improving LV function and survival.

#### **E. Transvenous pacemaker and ICD issues**

- **1.** The function of a permanent transvenous pacing system can be disrupted by use of electrocautery at the time of surgery. A magnet must be available to convert the pacemaker to a fixed pacing mode.
- **2.** ICD units should be inactivated prior to surgery.
- **3.** Because the right atrial lead of a dual‐chamber pacemaker may be displaced during surgery or the pulse generator may be damaged by electrocautery, all permanent pacemaker systems must be interrogated immediately after surgery to ensure appropriate sensing and pacing.

# **III. Stress Testing and Myocardial Perfusion Imaging in Coronary Disease**

- **A.** Stress testing plays a major role in detecting the potential presence and functional significance of CAD. In addition to basic exercise stress testing, rest and stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) have greater sensitivity and specificity in identifying viable and ischemic myocardium that will benefit from an interventional procedure. The technology has become very sophisticated, and only the salient features are presented.3–5
- **B. Exercise ECG (exercise tolerance test or ETT).** In patients who can exercise, stress testing to maximal exercise (or at least >85% of maximal predicted heart rate to optimize sensitivity) is performed on a treadmill with a graded protocol (Figure 2.2). ECG changes of ischemia can be difficult to detect in patients with a LBBB, ventricular‐paced rhythms, significant LVH or ST changes on baseline ECG, so for these patients, an imaging study is preferable. The ECG leads that demonstrate ST depressions during exercise testing do not necessarily correlate with the site of ischemia, but this can be determined more precisely with imaging studies.
  - **1.** It is recognized that the sensitivity and specificity of ETTs are not ideal and the proper interpretation of a stress test depends on the pretest probability of CAD.6,7 For example, a positive ETT in an asymptomatic nondiabetic patient may be a false positive, and a negative ETT in a patient with symptoms and multiple risk factors does not exclude CAD. Therefore, exercise ECG testing is most useful for the patient with an intermediate probability of disease based on clinical criteria.
  - **2.** Exercise testing is of value in that it mimics the clinical circumstances during which the patient becomes symptomatic and can determine the workload level at which symptoms occur. The latter correlates with the likelihood of more severe coronary disease and also correlates with prognosis.

**Figure 2.2 •** Positive exercise stress test. (Left) baseline ECG before exercise (leads II, III, V5, V6). (Right) exercise ECG after four minutes of stage 2. At a heart rate of 157 bpm, note the presence of 3 mm of ST depression in these leads, suggesting inferolateral ischemia.

- **3.** The following findings are consistent with multivessel coronary disease and an adverse prognosis, especially when they occur at a low workload (<6 METs):
  - **a.** Development of anginal symptoms
  - **b.** More than 2 mm ST depression in multiple leads that persists more than five minutes into recovery
  - **c.** ST segment elevation
  - **d.** Failure to increase blood pressure to higher than 120 mm Hg or a sustained decrease in blood pressure greater than 10 mm Hg or below rest levels
  - **e.** Sustained ventricular tachycardia
- **C. Radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (rMPI).**8–11 Use of rest and stress imaging can assess myocardial perfusion, viability, global myocardial function and regional wall motion abnormalities. Stress may be induced either as part of an exercise protocol, pharmacologically using a coronary vasodilator, or with an inotrope (dobutamine) to increase myocardial oxygen demand with mild vasodilatation. Perfusion distal to a stenosis is maintained at rest by autoregulatory dilatation of resistance vessels that maintains distal flow despite a reduced perfusion pressure.

Exercise or use of vasodilators elicits regional differences in coronary flow reserve, as blood flow may increase three‐ to fivefold in normal arteries, but much less so beyond coronary stenoses. This discrepancy allows for the identification of ischemic zones and, inferentially, coronary stenosis.

- **1.** rMPI is more sensitive and specific than exercise stress testing in detecting CAD and is more effective in determining the severity and location of ischemia. It is most useful when the patient has baseline ECG changes that preclude adequate interpretation of an ECG exercise test or when the patient cannot adequately exercise. Single‐photon emission CT (SPECT) imaging and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning can be used, the former being more widely available. Radioactive tracers commonly used for SPECT MPI include Tc‐99m tetrofosmin (Myoview) and Tc‐99m sestamibi (Cardiolite), which have essentially supplanted the use of thallium‐201.
- **2.** If the patient can exercise, a treadmill or bicycle is used, and at peak exercise or when symptoms develop, a radioisotope is injected, exercise is continued for a minute, and SPECT imaging is obtained. Low‐level treadmill exercise combined with vasodilator stress imaging can give an assessment of exercise capacity, provides excellent images, and is associated with fewer noncardiac side effects.12
- **3.** If the patient cannot exercise, pharmacologic stress is generally induced with a vasodilator, most commonly regadenoson (Lexiscan), which is a selective adenosine A2A receptor agonist, and, less commonly, adenosine or dipyridamole. For purely stress imaging, regadenoson 400 μg is given intravenously (IV), flushed with saline, and is followed 10–20 seconds later by an injection of a radioisotope, and imaging is obtained 15–45 minutes later. These medications produce coronary vasodilation with a fourfold increase in myocardial blood flow above baseline in normal arteries (coronary flow reserve being the ratio of hyperemic to baseline coronary flow). With flow‐limiting coronary stenosis, there is less coronary flow reserve and less tracer uptake in the myocardium subtended by those vessels.13 At peak stress, lack of tracer update ("cold spot") may be consistent with either irreversible infarction or ischemia.
- **4.** In patients with contraindications to vasodilators, such as hypotension, sick sinus syndrome, high‐degree AV block, bronchospastic lung disease, or use of theophylline, dobutamine can be used for MPI.14 This is given in five three‐minute stages at increasing doses, starting at 5 μg/kg/min, followed by doses of 10, 20, 30, and eventually 40 μg/kg/min. Dobutamine will increase heart rate (chronotropy) and myocardial contractility (inotropy), producing an increase in oxygen demand and, consequently, myocardial blood flow. Once target heart rate is achieved (occasionally with the use of atropine) or the patient becomes symptomatic, the radionuclide is injected over 10 seconds, allowed to circulate for a minute, and then imaging is obtained.
- **5.** Rest/stress protocols are most commonly used because they can assess the presence of viability and ischemia. A common protocol involves infusion of the radioactive tracer for rest images (e.g. 9 μg of tetrofosmin), then injection of the vasodilator followed by re‐administration of a three‐times‐higher dose of tracer, with imaging obtained 15–60 minutes later (Figure 2.3).
- **6.** Stress/redistribution studies may be performed using thallium‐201, either given after exercise or after the administration of dipyridamole. After the tracer is

(A) Short‐axis (upper two rows) and vertical long‐axis views (lower two rows) at stress (top image of each pair) and redistribution (lower image of each pair). The stress images demonstrate reduced tracer uptake in the anteroapical region that improves during the redistribution phase, consistent with anteroapical ischemia. (B) Similar views demonstrating a defect in the inferolateral region in the stress images that does not improve with redistribution. This is consistent with infarction.

injected, the initial stress imaging is obtained within 10 minutes and then repeated 2.5–4 hours later for the redistribution imaging. If there is still a residual imaging defect, delayed reimaging is performed 18–24 hours later after a small reinjection of thallium‐201. The latter will improve sensitivity in determining myocardial viability.15 Alternatively, a rest‐only image may be obtained along with initial and delayed redistribution images to assess for viability.9

- **D. Stress MRI scanning** has excellent spatial and temporal resolution and is very effective in assessing regional wall motion abnormalities and in detecting, localizing, and quantifying the degree of ischemia.11 Various applications include rest/stress perfusion imaging and dobutamine cine stress cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), which has >80% sensitivity and specificity in identifying significant coronary stenosis. Some consider nuclear imaging the gold standard for assessing myocardial perfusion and recommend it as a noninvasive approach to assess intermediate‐ to high‐risk patients with equivocal stress tests. This approach entails a cardiac CT scan to assess for anatomic stenosis and, if present, a subsequent stress MRI to assess the hemodynamic significance of the lesion. Delayed gadolinium enhancement on cardiac MR can be used to identify areas of viability and nonviability (see section F.3.e).
- **E. Stress echocardiography** is based on the principle that stress‐induced ischemia caused by coronary artery stenosis will produce regional wall motion abnormalities.16 This may be performed using bicycle or treadmill exercise (ESE). An alternative to exercise is the use of **dobutamine** to increase myocardial oxygen demand (dobutamine stress echocardiogram, or DSE). If the demand cannot be met by an increase in blood flow, ischemia will produce regional wall motion abnormalities in the distribution of the stenotic coronary artery. Thus, this can determine the location and extent of ischemia. Stress echoes are more sensitive and specific than exercise ECG testing and provide comparable results to those of exercise nuclear imaging.
- **F. Viability studies.**17 Myocardial viability studies are useful in patients with severe LV dysfunction to distinguish areas of myocardial necrosis from "hibernating myocardium" that may recover function after revascularization. The clinical utility of these studies has been called into question and may not be as useful as previously thought.
  - **1.** Revascularization of viable areas generally improves LV function and symptoms in patients with CHF with or without angina, although in some patients, symptoms will improve without any improvement in global or regional function.18,19 Extensive remodeling and high end‐systolic volumes are associated with less improvement in LV function.
  - **2.** Numerous meta‐analyses have reported a strong association between viability and improvement in survival with CABG.20 However, other important studies suggest this may not be the case. In a 10‐year follow‐up of the STICH (Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure) trial, which is discussed on page 7, the presence of viability was associated with an improvement of LV function with both medical and surgical therapy, but this did not translate into improved survival.21 Another analysis of STICH data indicated that viability was predictive of a survival benefit in patients with moderate LV dysfunction but lost its prognostic benefit when LV dysfunction became severe.22
  - **3.** Among the modalities available to detect viability are the following:
    - **a. SPECT imaging with Tc‐99m tracers** (tetrofosmin or sestamibi) is based on intact mitochondrial function reflecting viability. Gated SPECT scanning allows for the assessment of ventricular function as well as viability using routine rest/stress imaging.

- **b. SPECT imaging with thallium** provides a comparable assessment of viability.23 Thallium uptake reflects cell membrane integrity, so that viable zones, whether ischemic or not, will perfuse and retain thallium at rest. With rest‐redistribution imaging, nonischemic viable tissue will retain thallium at rest. However, if there is rest ischemia, a defect may be evident initially but show redistribution four hours later, indicating viability. With stress‐redistribution imaging, an area of ischemia that produces a defect at stress may demonstrate redistribution either with reinjection of thallium or on delayed imaging up to 18–24 hours later.15
- **c. 18F‐deoxyglucose (FDG) uptake** using PET or SPECT imaging is a very sensitive test of viability. FDG is a marker of glucose uptake by the myocardium, thus assessing metabolism and cell viability. An assessment of perfusion is made with 13N‐ammonia or rubidium‐82, and then 18FDG is injected to assess metabolism. Zones with matching perfusion and metabolism are either not ischemic or are infarcted. Evidence of preserved metabolic activity in zones of reduced perfusion indicates viable, hibernating myocardium. These studies may detect viability in zones considered nonviable by thallium imaging.24
- **d. Dobutamine stress echo (DSE)** can be used to identify contractile reserve, which suggests viability.15 Low doses of dobutamine are administered during echocardiography to assess any change in global and regional wall motion. A biphasic response during dobutamine echocardiography (improvement in function at low dose and worsening of function at peak stress from high doses of dobutamine) is highly predictive of recovery of regional contractile function in patients with LV dysfunction.25
- **e. Delayed enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)** is indexed on cell membrane integrity and uses gadolinium‐based contrast as a means of assessing viability and nonviability. Normal myocardium has a very low concentration of gadolinium after its injection and will appear black on imaging, whereas abnormal myocardial tissue will accumulate gadolinium and appear hyper‐enhanced and bright.26 Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) is noted in regions of transmural nonviability. LGE >15% has been found to correlate with the risk of sudden death in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.27 MRI‐defined diastolic wall thickness >5.5 mm is predictive of contractile recovery after CABG. MRI provides excellent image quality with a precise identification of epicardial and endocardial borders to allow for the assessment of wall motion and thickening.28

# **IV. Stress Echocardiography in Valvular Heart Disease**

- **A. General comments.**29,30 Exercise stress echo (ESE) is very useful in assessing the physiologic and hemodynamic severity of valvular heart disease in patients without significant symptoms and can be used to assess prognosis (see section VII for discussion of non‐stress echo imaging). The patient should have a resting and then stress echocardiogram for the assessment of valve gradients, degree of regurgitation, stroke volume, PA and right ventricular systolic pressures (RVSP), and RV and LV size and function. The test is abnormal if:
  - ∙ Symptoms occur at lower than expected workload
  - ∙ Exercise capacity is <85% of predicted
  - ∙ Blood pressure falls or increases <20 mm Hg
  - ∙ RVSP rises to >60 mm Hg

- ∙ Degree of valvular regurgitation worsens
- ∙ EF falls or regional wall motion abnormalities develop
- ∙ Sustained ventricular arrhythmias occur
- **B. Aortic stenosis (AS)** is a progressive process, and patients often limit their activities and deny symptoms. Because of the adverse impact of symptoms on survival (mean survival of only 1–2 years), stress testing is recommended in "asymptomatic" stage C patients with severe AS. Studies have shown that an abnormal symptom‐limited ESE is associated with an eightfold higher risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and a 5.5 times higher risk of sudden death.29 In addition, an increase in mean gradient of >20 mm Hg or development of exercise‐induced pulmonary hypertension is associated with a higher risk of MACE. Therefore, both ACC/AHA and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines recommend aortic valve replacement (AVR) for patients who develop symptoms (class I) or an abnormal blood pressure response (class IIa) with exercise stress testing.
  - **1.** DSE is very useful in the assessment of patients with stage D2 low‐flow, low‐gradient AS with depressed LV function. DSE can differentiate true AS from pseudo‐severe AS, the latter being present if the aortic valve area (AVA) increases with dobutamine due to an increase in cardiac output without an increase in gradient.
    - **a.** In stage D2 patients, the diagnosis of severe AS is confirmed by an increase in the mean gradient to >40 mm Hg with dobutamine, but often the AVA will calculate to <1.0 cm2 even though the gradient does not reach that level. This AVA‐gradient discordance may occur when inadequate contractile reserve is present, i.e. when the stroke volume increases <20% or the EF falls. This suggests intrinsic myocardial dysfunction, not just afterload mismatch, as the cause of poor LV function. Even though the results of AVR (either surgical or TAVR) are suboptimal in these patients with a much higher mortality, AVR still improves upon the poor natural history of AS if left untreated.
    - **b.** In patients with poor contractile reserve, it may be difficult to differentiate true from pseudo‐severe AS. It has been proposed that a "projected AVA" based on a normal transvalvular flow rate be used to more appropriately assess the severity of AS.31
  - **2.** The role of DSE is not clear‐cut in patients with stage D3 AS, which is termed paradoxical low‐flow, low gradient AS with normal EF. The diagnosis is usually made because of a low stroke volume index <35 mL/m2 . If that is not present, one might presume that severe AS is not present. Again, use of the projected AVA may be helpful, but assessment of aortic valve calcium by CT scanning may be more suggestive of severe AS.32
- **C. Aortic regurgitation (AR).** The progression to symptomatic AR is fairly slow, and patients often remain asymptomatic despite the onset of progressive LV dysfunction. ESE can be used to elicit symptoms or assess contractile reserve, the absence of which correlates with potentially irreversible LV dysfunction even after AVR. An exercise‐induced fall in EF may also prompt early consideration of surgery. Other subtle changes, such as early RV systolic dysfunction or measurements approaching the guideline recommendations for surgery (EF 50–55% or LVESD approaching 50 mm) are considered high‐risk findings.
- **D. Mitral stenosis (MS).** ESE or DSE is useful in assessing the physiologic significance of MS when there is discordance between clinical symptoms and hemodynamics. Some patients appear asymptomatic with severe MS, while others are symptomatic with moderate MS. With exercise, the heart rate increases with less diastolic filling

- time, and the mitral gradient increases along with an increase in left atrial (LA) and PA pressures. Nearly 50% of patients with asymptomatic moderate–severe MS have been shown to develop symptoms during exercise.30 Other high‐risk features include an increase in the mean gradient to >18 mm Hg with DSE or >15 mm Hg with exercise and an RVSP >60 mm Hg at peak exercise, with dyspnea more likely to develop if there is a rapid rise in RV systolic pressure with less exercise.33
- **E. Mitral regurgitation (MR).** Stress echo is helpful in assessing exercise‐induced changes in MR when there is a discordance between symptoms and the severity of MR. For patients with primary degenerative MR, an increase in RVSP to >60 mm Hg, exercise capacity <85% of predicted, latent LV dysfunction, AF, or abnormal heart rate recovery are high‐risk features. For patients with secondary (functional or ischemic) MR, ESE may reveal subclinical LV dysfunction due to ischemia and is suggestive of severe MR if the patient develops pulmonary edema, ischemic wall motion abnormalities, or an increase in the effective regurgitant orifice area of >13 mm.

# **V. Cardiac Catheterization**

- **A.** The gold standard for the diagnosis of most forms of cardiac disease remains cardiac catheterization.34 It is indicated in most patients whose clinical presentation and diagnostic testing suggest that an interventional procedure (PCI or cardiac surgery) may be indicated. The exceptions are acute type A aortic dissections, which are surgical emergencies, and aortic valve endocarditis with vegetations, with which catheter manipulation in the root may cause embolization.
- **B. Techniques** (Tables 2.1 and 2.2; Figures 2.4–2.6)
  - **1. Right‐heart catheterization** is performed in patients with valve disease and those with coronary disease and LV dysfunction. It involves placement of a Swan‐Ganz PA catheter to obtain intracardiac pressures and measure oxygen saturations from each chamber to detect intracardiac shunts (atrial or ventricular septal defects). The mixed venous oxygen saturation from the PA port indirectly reflects the cardiac output. A thermodilution cardiac output is obtained and can be used along with pressure gradients obtained from right‐ and left‐heart catheterization to calculate valve areas using the Gorlin formula (see page 24).
  - **2. Left‐heart catheterization** involves advancing a catheter from the aorta through the aortic valve into the LV. This allows for the measurement of the left ventricular end‐diastolic pressure (LVEDP), obtaining a left ventriculogram to assess the EF (end‐diastolic volume minus end‐systolic volume divided by the end‐diastolic volume) (Figure 2.7), and identification of MR (Figure 2.8). A Fick cardiac output can be calculated. The aortic valve gradient can be measured during pullback of the catheter, but in patients with AS, crossing the valve has been reported to increase the risk of stroke.35 Therefore, this should not be performed if severe AS is confirmed by echocardiography.
  - **3.** Evaluation of both left‐ and right‐heart pressures is invaluable in making the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis (see Figure 1.32).36,37
  - **4.** An **aortogram** ("root shot") may be performed in patients with aortic valve disease to assess the degree of AR (Figure 2.9). Excessive whip of an angiographic catheter may suggest the presence of a dilated aortic root. An aortogram can provide an estimate of aortic size that might necessitate replacement of the ascending aorta, but a CT scan or echocardiogram can assess the size of the aorta more precisely.

#### **5. Fluoroscopy** can yield valuable information, including:

- **a.** Calcification of the ascending aorta that may require further evaluation by noncontrast CT scanning (Figure 2.10)
- **b.** Severe coronary calcification or extensive coronary stenting that may make bypass grafting virtually impossible
- **c.** The location of intravascular catheters or assist devices, or the position of an intra‐aortic balloon pump (IABP)

(B) Using fluoroscopy prior to injection of contrast, significant calcification can be seen in the wall of the ascending aorta.

This patient received a transcatheter heart valve because of the high risk of surgery.

- **e.** "Rocking" of a prosthetic valve suggestive of endocarditis with annular invasion and possible dehiscence
- **f.** Limitation of movement of prosthetic valve discs, consistent with valve thrombosis or restriction by pannus ingrowth (Figure 2.12)

(D) During diastole, the leaflets barely open due to valve thrombosis, preventing filling of the left ventricle and leading to elevated left atrial pressures.

#### **VI. Coronary Angiography**

**A.** Coronary angiography is performed as part of the cardiac catheterization procedure by placing special preformed catheters directly into the coronary ostia and injecting contrast into the coronary arteries (Figures 2.13 and 2.14). Angiography will assess whether the circulation is right or left dominant (i.e. whether the posterior descending artery arises from the right or left system), and will define the location, extent, and degree of coronary stenoses (Figure 2.15). This information is then used to determine if an interventional procedure is indicated and whether PCI or CABG is preferable. The SYNTAX and SYNTAX II scores (see pages 5–6) are often used to

**Figure 2.15 •** Significant coronary stenosis. (A) A 99% stenosis of the mid‐RCA. (B) PCI of this stenosis. (C) An 80% left main stenosis.

- make that determination. Among the anatomic factors to be considered when contemplating surgery are the quality and bypassability of the target vessels based on their size and the extent of distal disease.
- **B.** Anteroposterior (AP), right anterior oblique (RAO), and left anterior oblique (LAO) views are obtained at varying degrees of cranial and caudal angulation to optimally visualize each of the coronary arteries. For re‐operative procedures, imaging of the ITA pedicle in a true AP projection is indicated to identify whether the ITA pedicle is very close to the midline (Figure 2.16). A lateral projection can identify its relationship to the posterior sternal table. Occasionally, a very unique finding may be noted with angiography, such as a tumor blush (Figure 2.17).
- **C.** Coronary angiography is still considered the gold standard for the identification of CAD, but it has limitations that need to be understood when interpreting the significance of stenoses and making a decision to proceed with an interventional approach.
  - **1.** Lesions can be concentric or eccentric. For a purely concentric stenosis, the correlation of diameter and loss of cross‐sectional area (CSA) is estimated as follows:
    - ∙ 50% diameter = 75% loss of CSA
    - ∙ 67% diameter = 90% loss of CSA

Thus, >50% diameter stenosis is considered significant.

**2.** The calculation of % diameter stenosis with contrast injection is based upon a comparison of the luminal diameter of a narrowed segment to that of the largest segment of an artery, unless the artery is ectatic. In patients with diffuse CAD, the

**Figure 2.17 •** (A) A right coronary angiogram demonstrating a tumor blush at the terminal end of the LV branch. (B) Both CT and MRI scanning (shown here) demonstrated this mass to overlie the coronary sinus near the AV groove, which was found to be a paraganglioma.

larger segment may not reflect normal vessel diameter if the entire vessel is diseased and narrowed, and thus angiography will underestimate the extent of disease.

- **3. Intravascular ultrasound** (IVUS) can visualize the entire vessel wall and give a more precise calculation of the true extent of narrowing, measured as a "minimal luminal area" (MLA) in mm2 (Figure 2.18). IVUS can be used to identify a stenosis that may benefit from stenting, and it is particularly helpful in indeterminate left main stenosis. A left main MLA <7 mm2 in a symptomatic patient or <5.5–6 mm2 in an asymptomatic patient is considered significant.38,39 An MLA <4 mm2 in the other proximal arteries is considered significant. **Optical coherence tomography (**OCT) is an optical analog of IVUS which has a tenfold higher resolution than IVUS. It is beneficial in assessing plaque burden in native arteries, but is most often used to assess the result of coronary stenting, as it can identify dissections, thrombus, and incomplete stent apposition.40,41
- **4.** The correlation of the degree of stenosis and its functional significance is imprecise. **Fractional flow reserve (FFR)** measurements using a pressure wire can help to determine whether an intervention is indicated.42–44 This basically assesses the maximal myocardial flow that can be achieved beyond a stenosis relative to what it would be for a normal artery. Hyperemic flow decreases significantly when there is a >50% stenosis. To calculate the FFR, a catheter is placed through the stenosis in the coronary artery, and proximal and distal pressure measurements are obtained after inducing a hyperemic response with either intracoronary or IV adenosine. If the distal/proximal pressure ratio (FFR) is ≤0.8, the lesion is considered functionally significant, and revascularization will provide a clinical benefit; otherwise, intervention is generally not indicated. This is also beneficial in sorting out the significance of left main lesions.45
- **5.** The **instantaneous wave‐free ratio fractional flow reserve (iFR)** is a non‐hyperemic pressure‐based index of stenosis severity.46,47 It uses the wave‐free period of diastole to measure the physiologic impact of the stenosis on the distal coronary bed. Although conceptually more complex, an iFR ≤0.89 is considered functionally significant, has excellent correlation with an FFR ≤0.8, and provides a comparable outcome in guiding PCI.

![](_page_23_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 2.18 •** Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) study of the left main coronary artery. A 2 Fr echo probe is introduced into the vessel, producing images of the lumen and the surrounding vessel wall. This allows for the calculation of a minimal luminal area (MLA). In this case, the MLA was <4 mm2, consistent with severe left main stenosis.

- **6.** An FFR‐guided approach to surgical revascularization is uncommon. However, studies have shown that this approach results in less grafting, a higher graft patency rate, a lower rate of angina, and a significant reduction in myocardial infarction and mortality out to six years. Such information could be helpful in deciding which patients should undergo surgery and, in fact, which vessels need to be bypassed.48–50
- **7.** Occluded vessels that are underfilled via collateral flow may represent large vessels that are good surgical targets (but not always). Symptomatic patients with viable myocardium subtended by occluded vessels may benefit from PCI of the chronically occluded vessel or from CABG.

#### **D. Important indications for coronary angiography include:**

- **1.** Any patient with suspected CAD in whom an interventional procedure might be indicated on a clinical basis. This includes patients presenting with ST‐elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMIs), acute coronary syndromes (non‐ST elevation infarction [non‐STEMI] or unstable angina), stable ischemic heart disease with positive stress tests, or ischemic pulmonary edema.
- **2.** Patients >age 40 who require open‐heart surgery for other reasons. Angiography should also be considered in younger patients with multiple risk factors for premature CAD.
- **3.** Annual follow‐up of the cardiac transplant patient to detect the development of silent allograft CAD.

- **E.** Coronary angiography is preferably performed through a transradial approach, which avoids the risk of a groin hematoma, or even worse a retroperitoneal hematoma. Bleeding complications are more likely to occur in patients undergoing PCI, since they should receive aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor prior to the procedure, might also receive a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor, and may also receive heparin or bivalirudin during the procedure in the cath lab. Patients with critical left main disease may not tolerate catheter manipulation in the coronary ostium, and are more prone to develop a myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, hemodynamic compromise, or death. However, outcomes after catheterization are usually related to the patient's clinical status and preexisting comorbidities, especially renal dysfunction.
  - **1.** Patients taking metformin for diabetes should withhold this medication starting the day before their catheterization.
  - **2.** The efficacy of numerous medications to reduce the risk of contrast‐induced acute kidney injury (AKI) has not been consistently demonstrated. Thus, most protocols involve hydration prior to, during, and following catheterization to dilute contrast in the kidneys. However, excessive hydration can contribute to heart failure and venous hypertension, which can prove deleterious to renal function as well.51–53 Using hemodynamically‐guided hydration, based on either the central venous pressure54 or LVEDP55, has been shown to reduce the risk of contrast‐induced AKI, and is especially important in patients with HF and chronic kidney disease. A commonly used protocol from the POSEIDON study55 involves giving fluid before, during, and after the procedure as follows:
    - ∙ Pre‐procedure: 3.5 mL/kg/h × 4 h
    - ∙ 5 mL/kg/h for LVEDP <13 mm Hg
    - ∙ 3 mL/kg/h for LVEDP of 13–18 mm Hg
    - ∙ 1.5 mL/kg/h for LVEDP >18 mm Hg
    - ∙ Post‐procedure: 1.5 mL/kg/h for 1 h

# **VII. Echocardiography**

- **A.** Echocardiography provides real‐time two‐ and three‐dimensional (2D and 3D) imaging of the thoracic aorta and cardiac structures. It is an invaluable noninvasive means of evaluating RV and LV size and function, with use of color, continuous wave, and pulsed Doppler recordings to assess valve function before, during, and after surgery.56 Although adequate information can be ascertained from a transthoracic study in the preoperative patient (Figures 2.19 and 2.20), transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) provides superior imaging because of the proximity of the probe to the heart. Both 2D and 3D imaging are extremely helpful in assessing the nature of mitral valve pathology and the results of surgical or percutaneous mitral valve repair. A further discussion of TEE with images of the most important views in the surgical patient is presented in Chapter 4.
- **B.** TEE is very important in the preoperative evaluation of MR because it provides an assessment of the nature and degree of MR, which may be different from an intraoperative evaluation due to altered loading conditions. Two‐dimensional imaging will delineate the presence of leaflet prolapse, torn chords, a ruptured papillary muscle, and/or annular dilatation (Figure 2.21–2.24). Color flow analysis can

provide an estimate of the degree of regurgitant flow, and the nature of the pathology (eccentric jets from leaflet prolapse or tethering, or a central jet from annular dilatation). Several methodologies can be used to calculate the regurgitant fraction, the regurgitant volume, and the effective orifice area of the valve, which are often necessary to confirm the severity of MR (see page 47 in Chapter 1).57 Three‐ dimensional imaging is very helpful in identifying the location of pathology, especially prior to MitraClip procedures.58,59

- **1.** TEE also provides excellent images of vegetations in patients with endocarditis (Figure 2.25), which may result in severe valvular regurgitation (Figure 2.26). It is better than TTE in identifying periannular abscesses, vegetations on prosthetic heart valves, and involvement of endocardial pacing or defibrillator leads.
- **2.** Although most patients with suspected dissections undergo a CT scan with contrast as the initial imaging modality, TEE has very high sensitivity and specificity in identifying dissections, noting the intimal flap and its origin, potential differential flow in the true and false lumens, the degree of AR, and the presence of a pericardial effusion. The study is usually performed intraoperatively but may be performed preoperatively in indeterminate cases (Figure 2.27).
- **3.** TEE is usually the best technique to identify the location and site of attachment of a cardiac tumor (Figures 2.28 and 2.29).
- **4.** TEE is invaluable in identifying pericardial effusions and tamponade when transthoracic imaging is not adequate.
- **C.** DSE can be used to identify ischemia and myocardial viability and to determine contractile reserve and the severity of AS in patients with low‐flow, low‐gradient AS, primarily with decreased LV function (stage D2) and occasionally with normal LV function (stage D3).16,29,30
- **D.** A summary of information that can be derived from preoperative and postoperative echocardiography is noted in Tables 2.3 and 2.4. The utility of TEE in the operating room is noted in Table 4.1 (page 225).

# **VIII. Noninvasive Coronary Angiography**

- **A.** Technological advances in noninvasive imaging have led to the use of CT and MRI scanning for the evaluation of coronary anatomy. The temporal and spatial resolution is quite good in evaluating the proximal coronary arteries, although there are limitations to each modality. They are generally recommended for patients with equivocal stress tests, intermediate coronary risk, or atypical symptoms, but not as a screening tool in asymptomatic patients or for patients with typical symptoms that may warrant PCI or CABG.
- **B. Multidetector row or multislice CT scanning** (MDCT or MSCT) that can acquire at least 64 slices per gantry rotation (and preferably 256 or 320 slices) provides adequate imaging of arteries with little motion artifact when the heart rate is slowed to less than 70 bpm with β‐blockers.60–62
  - **1.** Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) provides excellent imaging of native coronary arteries and bypass grafts with a sensitivity and specificity of about 80–90% (Figure 2.30).63,64 It is able to detect clinically significant lesions (>50% stenosis) quite accurately. It does require contrast and radiation and produces suboptimal imaging with an irregular heart rhythm, severe coronary calcification or the presence of stents, or very small vessels <1.5 mm in size. Although stents do interfere with imaging, CCTA is quite accurate in assessing in‐stent stenosis.64 It is contraindicated in patients with renal dysfunction or an allergy to contrast.
  - **2.** CCTA is also beneficial in identifying the proximal course of the coronary arteries near the great vessels in patients with coronary anomalies. However, since this is usually a concern in younger patients, cardiac MRI is preferable to avoid radiation.
  - **3.** The ability to assess physiologic significance simultaneously with anatomic findings can be achieved using combined technologies. CCTA combined with SPECT MPI has improved the accuracy of CCTA.65 FFR derived from CCTA using special software is very accurate in detecting hemodynamically significant lesions in patients with multivessel disease, and was found to be superior to standard CTA, SPECT, or PET scanning in doing so.66–69

(B) Native coronary arteries can be evaluated more extensively in one view using multiplanar reconstruction. Here, the LAD has diffuse calcific disease. (C) Tight stenosis of the LAD on CCTA. (D) Corresponding stenosis noted on invasive coronary angiography. Adapted with permission from Cury, et al. *J Am Coll Cardiol Img* 2016;9:1099-113 (C & D).70

**C. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging** is able to visualize the proximal portions of coronary arteries, but it is not quite as sensitive and specific as CCTA and therefore is not recommended for the routine identification of coronary disease (Figure 2.31A and B).71,72

- **1.** The advantages of CMR are the lack of irradiation or contrast, less interference from coronary calcification, and less motion artifact at higher heart rates. However, suboptimal images will be obtained in patients with stents, arrhythmias, or irregular breathing patterns.
- **2.** The primary indications for CMR imaging in the assessment of CAD are:
  - **a.** Coronary anomalies, by identifying their proximal course (especially in young patients) (Figure 2.31C)

- **b.** Coronary aneurysms
- **c.** Saphenous vein graft stenosis or internal thoracic artery graft stenosis. CMR has a sensitivity and specificity >90% in identifying significant lesions.72 However, if the patient is symptomatic and may require an intervention, CMR is usually not indicated unless the graft cannot be selectively cannulated by routine angiography. CMR and CCTA have similar accuracy in assessing bypass grafts.
- **3.** CMR can provide important information about myocardial flow and function, and thus is preferentially used for the functional assessment of coronary disease (see section IX).
- **4.** Newer pacemakers and ICDs are considered MRI‐conditional and allow for performance of MRI scans. Older systems, termed "legacy devices", initially considered to contraindicate performance of an MRI, have been shown to be MRI safe using a field strength of up to 1.5 tesla.73

# **IX. Evaluation of Aortic and Cardiac Disease by CT and MR Scanning**

- **A. Computerized tomography (CT) scanning** is used primarily for the evaluation of aortic disease, but it has several other potential uses in identifying chest pathology in addition to CCTA. Sixty‐four or greater slice CT angiography with color volume‐rendered multiplanar reformation provides excellent angiographic images. Indications include:
  - **1.** Identification of an aortic dissection in a patient with a typical or atypical presentation (Figures 2.32–2.34). This requires a CT scan with contrast and can also simultaneously rule out a pulmonary embolism with appropriate gating. CT scans can also be used for postoperative follow‐up to identify distal aneurysmal disease.

#### **2.** Assessment of aortic size

- **a.** A contrast CT scan with 3D reconstruction can provide transverse, sagittal, and coronal cuts as well as a rotational 3D image (Figure 2.35). These can provide an exact measurement of aortic diameter, since an obliquely coursing structure (such as a tortuous or ectatic segment of aorta) will give a spuriously increased measurement on transverse cuts which will not reflect the true diameter of the aorta. Software programs can provide centerline analysis to overcome these shortcomings. They are usually applied to patients with descending thoracic aneurysms in anticipation of endografting.74 However, centerline analysis has also been used in models to predict the risk of aortic dissection.75 The volume‐rendered image often gives a better assessment of the distal extent of the aneurysm and is helpful in deciding whether the distal anastomosis will need to be sewn using circulatory arrest. If the aneurysm tapers proximal to the arch, it may be possible to sew a distal anastomosis with a cross‐clamp in place.
- **b.** Descending thoracic aneurysms (Figure 2.36). The proximal and distal extent of the aneurysm and vessel tortuosity are important elements in devising a strategy for thoracic endografting (TEVAR).

**Figure 2.32 •** CT scan with contrast demonstrating a type A aortic dissection visualized in (A) coronal, (B) sagittal, and (C) transverse cuts across the arch and (D) at the mid‐heart level. Note the intimal flap separating the true lumen (TL) and false lumen (FL), with opacification of the TL, which is significantly compressed by the FL as the dissection extends into the descending aorta.

- **3.** Evaluation of ascending aortic calcification suggested by chest x‐ray or fluoroscopy (see Figure 2.10). This should be done without contrast.
- **4.** Location of the RV, aorta, saphenous vein grafts, or ITA graft relative to the sternum in the planning of re‐operative surgery.76 This is also applicable to patients undergoing minimally invasive surgery to select the proper incision site and is useful for transaortic TAVR planning as well.

(A) The axial slice may not provide an accurate size assessment if the measurement is not coaxial. (B) The coronal (and sagittal) slices are helpful in defining the precise diameter of the aorta from the root to the arch. (C) A 3D volume‐rendered reconstruction image of the same patient can be rotated to give a better appreciation of the aortic diameter near the arch.

- **5.** Identification of pericardial (and pleural) effusions or the thickness of the pericardium in cases of constrictive pericarditis.
- **6.** Identification of intracardiac masses (see Figure 2.28B).
- **7.** Evaluation of the abdominal aorta and iliofemoral systems. This is essential prior to minimally invasive cases during which femoral arterial cannulation is to be utilized. Diffusely diseased vessels may dissect during retrograde perfusion, and atherosclerotic disease can embolize retrograde to the brain. Prior to TAVR procedures, the iliofemoral systems are assessed for size, calcification, and tortuosity and, if markedly abnormal, may mandate an alternate site for access (Figure 2.37).
- **8.** Evaluation for a retroperitoneal hematoma which may occur after percutaneous femoral vessel cannulation (Figure 2.38).

- **9.** Identification of pulmonary or mediastinal abnormalities noted on preoperative chest x‐ray. Obtaining a baseline CT scan prior to cardiac surgery eliminates the potential distortion of pulmonary pathology by postoperative changes.
- **B. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging** is useful in the identification of ischemic and nonischemic myocardial disease, imaging of the aorta and its branches, analyzing congenital heart disease, and providing images of coronary arteries and bypass grafts.77–81
  - **1.** CMR can be performed in patients with coronary stents (fields <3 tesla), current‐generation mechanical prosthetic heart valves (note that most bileaflet valves are composed of carbon and silicone and not metal), and retained epicardial pacing wires.82,83 It is safe for patients with legacy pacemakers and defibrillators using a field <1.5 tesla.73
  - **2.** The major advantage of MRI is the avoidance of radiation, and therefore it is preferable in the young patient. Contraindications to MRI are noted on multiple websites under a search for this topic.
  - **3.** Pharmacologic stress CMR with dobutamine or coronary vasodilators can identify areas of myocardial ischemia and may be more sensitive than DSE in detecting coronary disease and predicting functional recovery after revascularization.84,85 Myocardial viability may be evaluated using gadolinium (to distinguish viable from infarcted myocardium) or dobutamine (systolic wall thickening >2 mm being predictive of functional recovery).
  - **4.** CMR is the most sensitive and specific test for detection of an aortic dissection (Figure 2.39). It can demonstrate differential flow velocities in the true and

**Figure 2.39 •** MRI scan demonstrating the intimal flap separating the true and false lumens in a patient with an extensive aortic dissection involving both the ascending and the descending thoracic aorta.

false channels and can identify branch artery compromise. However, it generally cannot be performed in the unstable patient requiring careful monitoring and often IV infusions. However, it should be considered when the clinical suspicion of a dissection is very high, yet other tests have been inconclusive. Most commonly, it is used in the follow‐up of patients who have had repair of an aortic dissection to assess the status of the false channel or distal aneurysmal expansion.

- **5.** Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) identifies areas of focal myocardial fibrosis and infarction and thus can be used to assess for viability and the likelihood of improvement in contractility after revascularization. Greater degrees of LGE correlate with a higher risk of sudden death in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).27 CMR can identify variations in the pathology within the LV in patients with HOCM. It is very useful in identifying other types of nonischemic cardiomyopathies (Figure 2.40).
- **6.** Aortic and cerebrovascular diseases can be defined by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) using time‐of‐flight (TOF) MRA and gadolinium‐ enhanced MRA (Figure 2.41). Spin‐echo and cine steady‐state free precession (SSFP) CMR can also be used to provide excellent 3D images of aortic disease, including true and false aneurysms and periaortic abscesses or perigraft fluid collections.

**Figure 2.40 •** The various patterns of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) seen with different types of cardiomyopathies. Typical patterns include transmural, subendocardial (regional and global), epicardial, and midwall LGE. These may differentiate between ischemic (subendocardial and transmural) and nonischemic cardiomyopathies, HOCM, myocarditis, sarcoidosis, and amyloidosis.

- **7.** Cine CMR allows for differentiation of blood (bright images) from cardiac tissue (dark images). It is useful in the assessment of ventricular function, valvular pathology, and intracardiac masses (see Figure 2.28C).
- **8.** CMR is useful in the assessment of pericarditis or tumor invasion into the pericardium. It can differentiate restrictive from constrictive pathology.
