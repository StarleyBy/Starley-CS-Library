## **6** Myocardial Protection

Optimizing clinical outcomes in cardiac surgery depends upon the performance of a technically proficient operation without incurring myocardial damage during the procedure. Adherence to this principle is imperative, whether a minimally invasive, robotic, off‐pump, or conventional surgical approach through a median sternotomy is performed. With the widespread application of percutaneous coronary interventions, patients requiring surgical revascularization tend to have severe coronary disease and more impaired ventricular function, requiring optimal myocardial preservation. The same holds true for patients undergoing surgery for complex valve problems that may not be amenable to percutaneous approaches. In most of these cases, the surgeon must conscientiously apply the well‐developed principles of cardioplegic arrest to minimize ischemia/reperfusion injury, which contributes to postischemic myocardial dysfunction. Excellent myocardial protection is essential to optimize the short‐ and long‐term results of surgery. In some situations, modifications of traditional approaches to myocardial protection with cardioplegia may prove beneficial.

#### **I. Techniques to Minimize Myocardial Injury During Cardiac Surgical Procedures (Table 6.1)**

- **A. The problem of ischemic arrest.** Aortic cross‐clamping interrupts the coronary circulation and will result in conversion to anaerobic metabolism with lactate accumulation, myocardial acidosis, depletion of myocardial energy stores, and cellular swelling. There is an accelerated accumulation of intracellular calcium during ischemia as the ATP‐ dependent active transport mechanism to extract sodium and calcium is impaired. Upon reperfusion, the high intracellular calcium levels cause severe myocardial dysfunction. Thus, without a reduction in myocardial metabolism, either by hypothermia or chemical cardiac arrest, aortic occlusion producing ischemic arrest for more than 15–20 minutes results in severe myocardial dysfunction.
- **B. Cardioplegic arrest** with aortic cross‐clamping is used during most types of cardiac surgery to allow the surgeon to operate upon an arrested heart with a relatively bloodless field. This produces diastolic arrest, preserves energy stores, and minimizes calcium entry into myocardial cells. With appropriate replenishment, this allows the surgeon to arrest the heart for several hours without experiencing ischemic myocardial damage.1–3
- **C. Off‐pump coronary artery bypass surgery (OPCAB)** is performed without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and thus on a beating heart. The need to provide myocardial protection is limited, because only the region subtended by the artery which is transiently occluded while being bypassed should be in ischemic jeopardy. Careful positioning of the heart for anastomoses to the inferior and lateral walls is essential to

minimize systemic hypotension, which can also induce ischemia. If ischemia develops during vessel occlusion, as evidenced by ECG changes or ventricular dysfunction, intracoronary shunting or aortocoronary shunting can be used to provide distal flow until the anastomosis is completed.4,5 Additional support using miniaturized CPB systems or right ventricular (RV) assist can be used in high‐risk off‐pump cases.6–8 Despite fairly comparable morbidity and mortality to standard on‐pump/cardioplegic arrest techniques, off‐pump surgery may have some advantages in patients with severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction.9

- **D. On‐pump beating‐heart surgery** for coronary bypass grafting can be performed without aortic cross‐clamping, using stabilizing OPCAB platforms to allow for the construction of distal anastomoses on a beating heart while the pump provides systemic flow. Despite the lower oxygen demand of the empty beating heart, ischemia in the distribution of severely diseased nonbypassed arteries is often noted due to the lower perfusion pressures on pump. Although ischemia should be better tolerated than during a standard OPCAB, shunting techniques can still be used to optimize protection. Applications of this technique include:
  - **1.** When safe aortic clamping cannot be performed (usually with a calcified or severely atherosclerotic aorta), when off‐pump surgery is not technically feasible, or when the risk of arresting the heart is considered very high due to a recent myocardial infarction, ongoing ischemia, marked LV hypertrophy, or severe ventricular dysfunction.10 In these high‐risk cases, studies have shown equivalent if not better results with this technique than with OPCABs and conventional CABGs.11–13
  - **2.** Intracardiac operations, such as resection of a LV aneurysm or surgical ventricular restoration, allowing the surgeon to palpate the border zone between viable muscle and scar tissue better than if the heart were arrested.
  - **3.** Minimally invasive mitral valve surgery when access to the aorta for clamping may be difficult (although a balloon "endoclamp" can be used). This is tolerated as long

- as there is no aortic valve regurgitation, either at baseline or with retraction of the left atrial wall during valve exposure.14–18 The latter problem can be avoided using a transseptal approach.
- **4.** Reoperative aortic valve surgery with a patent internal thoracic artery (ITA) graft that cannot be dissected free and controlled during cardioplegic arrest. Use of continuous retrograde cold blood or blood cardioplegia with at least moderate systemic hypothermia can be used for myocardial protection.19–21 Performing reoperative aortic valve surgery using normothermic noncardioplegic retrograde blood perfusion has been used successfully as well.14,15
- **E. Hypothermic fibrillatory arrest** is a variant of the "empty beating heart" approach. It can be used for coronary surgery, with the aorta remaining unclamped and the distal anastomoses performed on a cold vented fibrillating heart with high perfusion pressures. Stabilizing platforms can be used if necessary to optimize exposure. This technique provides less than ideal protection, especially in the hypertrophied heart. Although it confirmed the concept that coronary surgery could be performed safely without aortic cross‐clamping, this technique is rarely used anymore.22
- **F. Intermittent ischemic arrest** involves multiple short periods of cross‐clamping during mild systemic hypothermia to perform each distal anastomosis. Conceptually, this is a violation of the principle of preserving the heart by inducing diastolic arrest during the period of aortic cross‐clamping. However, the heart is able to tolerate these brief periods of ischemia without adverse sequelae.23,24
- **G. Ischemic preconditioning** refers to a phenomenon in which a transient reduction in blood flow to myocardial tissue enables it to tolerate a subsequent longer period of ischemia. The ideal application of this concept is in off‐pump surgery, because, in the absence of collateral flow, there is obligatory transient ischemia with occlusion of a target vessel that might be lessened by ischemic preconditioning. Although some studies suggest that this technique reduces troponin leakage, myocardial dysfunction, and arrhythmias compared with surgery using cardioplegic arrest, others have not.25–28
- **H. Ischemic postconditioning** involves the administration of medications at the time of initial reperfusion when the aortic cross‐clamp is removed to modify ischemia/ reperfusion damage. Use of adenosine 1.5 mg/kg has been shown to reduce troponin leakage.29

#### **II. Principles of Cardioplegia1–3 (Table 6.2)**

**A.** Prompt **diastolic arrest** of the heart is achieved using a delivery solution containing about 20–25 mEq/L of potassium chloride (KCl). The potassium may be added to a crystalloid solution which is administered undiluted ("crystalloid cardioplegia"), or it may be concentrated in a smaller bag of crystalloid solution and administered in a mixture with blood in varying ratios (most commonly 4:1 or 8:1 blood:cardioplegia solution) ("blood cardioplegia"). Systems are available that add the potassium directly to blood to minimize hemodilution (so‐called miniplegia or microplegia). In these systems, the lack of hemodilution provides superior oxygen‐carrying capacity to diluted blood cardioplegia along with natural osmotic properties. They have been shown to reduce postoperative myocardial edema, increase buffering, and permit more rapid recovery of LV function compared with 8:1 blood cardioplegia.30–32

- **1. Crystalloid cardioplegia (CCP)** provides little substrate and no oxygen to the heart during the period of ischemic arrest. It functions primarily by arresting the heart at cold temperatures. It can be oxygenated by bubbling oxygen through the solution, but this is not a common practice.
  - **a. St. Thomas** and **Plegisol** are extracellular solutions with high potassium levels that produce arrest by depolarization. They require replenishment every 20 minutes or so to optimize protection. St. Thomas solution also contains procaine, and high doses can trigger postoperative seizures. A comparison of these two solutions showed less ventricular fibrillation after unclamping with use of St. Thomas solution.33
  - **b. Bretschneider solution (Custodiol**) is an intracellular hyperpolarizing solution with low sodium and potassium that contains histidine–tryptophan–ketoglutarate.34 The histidine provides a buffer and is a free‐radical scavenger, and this reduces the risk of ischemia‐reperfusion injury. This solution can provide myocardial protection for up to 2–3 hours with just one dose.35–37 Studies comparing cold antegrade blood cardioplegia with Custodiol showed similar or better protection with Custodiol for mitral valve surgery and equivalent results in aortic valve surgery, although better results were noted with blood cardioplegia in patients with reduced ejection fractions.36–38
- **2. Blood cardioplegia (BCP)** solutions provide oxygen, natural buffering agents, antioxidants, and free‐radical scavengers. Standard supplemental additives to these solutions include other buffers to achieve an alkaline pH (THAM), citrate‐ phosphate‐dextrose (CPD) or double‐dextrose (CP2D) to lower the level of calcium, and occasionally drugs to maintain slight hyperosmolarity (mannitol).

- **a. Buckberg solution** and its modifications contain the ingredients listed above in a variety of different concentrations. It produces potassium‐induced cellular depolarization and requires replenishment every 20–30 minutes. The cardioplegia mixture passes through a separate heater/cooler system in the extracorporeal circuit with a 4:1 or 8:1 mixture of blood:cardioplegia stock solution. The infusion rate, temperature, and pressure are controlled by the perfusionist. Various additives can be used to optimize protection in various clinical situations by replenishing ATP stores (see sections II.D and E).
- **b. del Nido (DN) cardioplegia** is a hyperkalemic, low calcium solution that contains lidocaine and magnesium (polarizing agents), bicarbonate (to maintain an intracellular pH), and mannitol (a free‐radical scavenger that also reduces myocardial edema). Myocardial protection is optimized by low diastolic intracellular calcium levels attributable to lidocaine blockade of Na+ channels and the presence of magnesium. The solution is given in a ratio of 1:4 blood to cardioplegia stock solution.39,40 Although it has been administered primarily antegrade in most studies, there is no specific reason why it could not be given retrograde as well.
  - **i.** DN cardioplegia was initially developed for congenital heart surgery and has now seen more widespread application in adult cardiac surgery. Earlier studies evaluated its benefits in valvular surgery, with subsequent studies reporting its use in adult congenital cases, complex valve and combined operations, reoperations, and coronary surgery.41–47 When used with mild hypothermic CPB, it provides equivalent protection in patients with and without LVH and with cross‐clamp times of up to about 90 minutes.48
  - **ii.** A dose of 20 mL/kg to a maximum of one liter is given antegrade, with half that dose given if the anticipated cross‐clamp time will be less than 30 minutes (except a full dose should be given if LVH is present).39 One dose usually suffices for cross‐clamp times less than 90 minutes, and not having to re‐administer cardioplegia generally shortens the cross‐clamp and bypass times. The heart usually does not fibrillate after unclamping of the aorta.
  - **iii.** If a longer cross‐clamp time is anticipated or has occurred, redosing with about 10 mL/kg after 45–90 minutes is suggested.42,43 However, the heart is often sluggish for a short period of time after unclamping the aorta, especially after redosing or when an additional dose is given close to unclamping.49,50 Furthermore, very few reports include patients requiring very prolonged cross‐clamp times (>2 hours). Thus, it is still not clear when redosing should take place in such patients.
  - **iv.** Clinical results are comparable to those with Buckberg‐type solutions and probably better than with St. Thomas solution.40,41,43–47,51,52
- **3.** The oxygen demand of the heart is reduced nearly 90% by simply arresting the heart at normothermia, so maintenance of arrest during the cross‐clamp period is essential (Figure 6.1). For Buckberg‐type solutions, this is accomplished by re‐ administering the solution every 15–20 minutes to deliver potassium and wash out metabolic byproducts. A low‐potassium solution (12–15 mEq/L) is used to maintain the arrest to avoid an excess potassium load. The high‐potassium solution should be re‐administered if the heart resumes any activity. For DN cardioplegia,

**Figure 6.1 •** Myocardial oxygen demand (mvO2 ). Notice that the most significant decrease in mvO2 occurs with the induction of the arrested state, and secondarily by the production of hypothermia.

re‐administration may be given empirically every 45–90 minutes or when the heart resumes activity. Cold blood alone can be given retrograde into the coronary sinus as an alternative to subsequent doses of cardioplegia to optimize tissue oxygenation and metabolism while minimizing the potassium load. This is adequate as long as the heart remains arrested. It is especially beneficial in patients with renal dysfunction, who are predisposed to the development of hyperkalemia.

- **4.** Clinical studies generally suggest that both cold and warm BCP provide superior myocardial protection to cold CCP, with less troponin release and better hemodynamic performance post‐pump. However, the rate of myocardial infarction and operative mortality has not been shown to differ.53–57 The advantage of BCP is probably most evident in patients with acute ischemia and more advanced LV dysfunction, especially when given both antegrade and retrograde. However, myocardial protection remains suboptimal even with BCP in hypertrophied hearts.58
- **B. Temperature.** Before the development of cardioplegia solutions, myocardial protection was provided entirely by systemic and topical hypothermia. It was found that myocardial oxygen consumption did decrease about 50% for every 10 °C decrease in myocardial temperature. It only seemed logical that administering cardioplegia at a cold temperature would be a significant factor in decreasing myocardial metabolism. However, the reduction in myocardial metabolism attributable to hypothermia is actually quite insignificant compared with that achieved by diastolic arrest (Figure 6.1). Nonetheless, systemic hypothermia and topical cold (not iced) saline are routinely used in patients receiving cold cardioplegia, with occasional use of a topical cooling insulation device to surround the LV and protect the phrenic nerve from cold injury.

- **1.** Some surgeons monitor myocardial temperatures with the presumption that adequate hypothermia (<15 °C) of the myocardium is providing satisfactory myocardial protection. However, in clinical practice, only one site is usually selected for monitoring (usually the LV apex or septum), and there is commonly a significant discrepancy between the temperatures of different areas of the LV, and especially between the left and right ventricles. It should be understood that temperature monitoring provides only a relative assessment of the degree of myocardial protection. A more scientific means of doing so can be accomplished using a pH probe. The development of significant acidosis caused by a derangement in myocardial metabolism is indicative of poor protection.59 Studies have shown little correlation between pH and temperature, suggesting that temperature is actually not a good indicator of the state of myocardial metabolism.60
- **2.** Use of intermittent "tepid" BCP (whether at 32 °C or 20 °C) allows the heart to utilize more oxygen and glucose than a colder heart.61 It may provide better metabolic and functional recovery than cold cardioplegia, with improved long‐term results.62 Optimizing its benefits may require administration through both antegrade and retrograde routes, especially in hypertrophied hearts.63,64
- **3.** Since enzymatic and cellular reparative processes function better at normothermia, some surgeons use "warm cardioplegia" for myocardial protection, with excellent results.56,57,63–68 Compared to cold cardioplegia, there may be a reduction in enzyme release and better ventricular function with comparable clinical events. However, because of the tendency for the heart to resume electrical activity at normothermia, this must be given continuously or with only short periods of interruption to protect the heart. An ischemic time of 15 minutes between repeat administrations is considered safe, and one study showed that supplementing cardioplegia with magnesium could safely extend this time to 25 minutes.69 When given continuously, it can obscure the operative field. To minimize hemodilution from excessive cardioplegia administration, the "miniplegia" system that simply adds potassium or other substances (magnesium) to the blood is useful. Warm cardioplegia can also be used as an adjunct to cold cardioplegia when given just after aortic cross‐clamping (warm induction) or just prior to removing the cross‐clamp ("hot shot").
  - **a. Warm induction** involves administering approximately 500 mL of warm cardioplegia immediately after aortic cross‐clamping. Studies suggest that this may be beneficial in actively ischemic hearts with energy depletion by providing a brief period of time during which oxygen can be used to repair cell damage and replace energy stores.70
  - **b.** Terminal warm BCP ("**hot shot**") is commonly given just before removal of the aortic cross‐clamp, because it has been shown to improve myocardial metabolism.71,72 The heart tends to remain asystolic for several minutes after removal of the aortic cross‐clamp, during which time it is able to "repair" cellular processes or replenish energy stores while the oxygen demand is low. A combination of warm induction and "hot shot" has been shown to reduce troponin leak in patients undergoing CABG.73,74 However, a study of patients with LV hypertrophy undergoing AVR did not show any clinical benefit of using "hot shot",75 and another study comparing standard "hot shot" with a modified reperfusion solution including aspartate and glutamate found no difference in clinical outcome.76

**Figure 6.2 •** (Top) Antegrade cardioplegia catheter with a side port for venting. (Bottom) A 14 Fr retrograde catheter with self‐inflating balloon that allows for measurement of coronary sinus pressures.

- **C. Route of delivery.** Cardioplegia is initially administered antegrade into the aortic root, and then may be given retrograde through a catheter placed into the coronary sinus (see Figure 5.9, page 298, and Figure 6.2).
  - **1.** The efficacy of **antegrade cardioplegia (ACP)** delivery may be compromised by severe coronary artery stenosis and is often dependent on collateral flow.77 In addition, in patients with more than mild aortic regurgitation, sufficient root distention may not be achieved, such that ACP delivery will be ineffective. In that situation, the initial dose should be given retrograde, and, if an AVR is being performed, it may be supplemented by an infusion of ACP directly into the coronary ostia once the aortotomy incision has been performed. ACP can be cumbersome and time‐ consuming to re‐administer during aortic valve operations. During mitral valve procedures, left atrial retraction usually distorts the aortic annulus, preventing adequate re‐administration of ACP. However, this can be accomplished by readjusting the position of the atrial wall retractor and making sure to eliminate air from the aortic root when ACP is re‐administered.
  - **2. Retrograde cardioplegia (RCP)** is easy to administer, either intermittently or continuously, and does not interrupt the flow of an operation. It is helpful in reducing the risk of atheroembolism from patent yet diseased saphenous vein grafts at reoperation. It generally provides excellent myocardial protection, although protection of the RV and the posterior LV is always of concern.78–80 Careful monitoring of coronary sinus pressure during the administration of RCP is essential: if it is too high (>50 mm Hg), coronary sinus rupture can occur; if it is too low (<20 mm Hg), there is usually a problem with catheter malposition or coronary sinus rupture.81 The desired flow rate for warm RCP has been determined to be about 200 mL/min.82 A variety of catheters, both self‐inflating and manual‐inflating, have been designed to maintain the catheter within the sinus, prevent retrograde flow of cardioplegia into the right atrium, and allow for pressure monitoring during cardioplegia administration. Transesophageal echocardiography is helpful in locating the position of the coronary sinus catheter, especially in minimally invasive cases or reoperative procedures, during which the surgeon cannot feel the coronary sinus or when the catheter has been placed by the anesthesiologist through the internal jugular vein.

- **3.** Studies that have analyzed the distribution of cardioplegia solutions suggest that the routes of delivery should be complementary, not exclusive. Contrast echo studies have shown that perfusion of the LV is better with warm antegrade delivery than retrograde delivery, and that delivery to the RV is poor with either approach, especially if there is right coronary artery occlusion.79,83 However, the latter may be improved by constructing the right coronary graft first and infusing cardioplegia down that graft.79 Use of combined ACP/RCP appears to provide the best protection and can be recommended for all cases.84–86 Cold RCP is generally given intermittently, although continuous cold RCP may improve ventricular performance with less myocardial ischemia compared with intermittent administration.87 Tepid or warm cardioplegia should be given as continuously as possible.
- **4.** Administration of simultaneous ACP/RCP usually involves administration down completed vein grafts at the same time as coronary sinus delivery. Despite concerns that this can be disruptive to myocardial cell homeostasis, with increased water accumulation in extracellular and intracellular compartments, this has not been demonstrated to jeopardize myocardial energy metabolism, especially when given for brief periods of time.88
- **D. Modified reperfusion.** Just prior to removal of the aortic cross‐clamp, the administration of a modified cardioplegia solution given under specific conditions has been shown to improve myocardial function.1–3 Such controlled reperfusion, with or without substrate enhancement, such as aspartate and glutamate, should provide a low potassium load (8–10 mEq/L), CPD or CP2D to limit calcium influx, provide hyperosmolarity, and should be given at a low pressure (<50 mm Hg) over several minutes. Such a regimen is a component of "integrated cardioplegia" but may be beneficial only in high‐risk cases.89 While one study suggested that a substrate‐enriched solution given during induction and reperfusion produced a transient improvement in LV function,72 another found no difference in clinical outcome compared to an unenriched "hot shot".76 Use of the Buckberg "integrated" cardioplegia approach (antegrade/retrograde with terminal warm substrate‐enriched reperfusion) has been shown to improve myocardial protection, especially of the septum.2,89
- **E. Other cardioplegia additives.** Studies have evaluated the potential myocardial protective benefits of a variety of additives to cardioplegia solutions, with variable results. Krebs cycle intermediates (aspartate and glutamate) appear to have the most benefit in energy‐depleted hearts. Studies evaluating use of esmolol and glucose–insulin– potassium given prior to cardioplegic arrest have also shown modest benefit in lowering troponin levels and improving systolic function in high‐risk patients.90,91

#### **III. Cardioplegia Strategy**

Numerous comparative studies have been done to elucidate the best cardioplegia strategy. These have evaluated the distribution of cardioplegia solutions, examined troponin levels and rates of infarction, and assessed hemodynamic performance, the requirement for inotropes, and mortality. There are so many variables that can influence outcomes that it is very difficult to conclude which method of myocardial protection is truly superior in influencing surgical results. In fact, excellent myocardial protection can be obtained with numerous strategies that adhere to the generally accepted principles of cardioplegia delivery.

- **A.** Most studies suggest that, in low‐risk cases, multidose cold crystalloid, cold, tepid, or warm BCP, whether given antegrade and/or retrograde, all produce relatively comparable clinical results. In general, protection of the RV is suboptimal with all strategies, especially in patients with right coronary artery disease. A combined ACP/RCP cold, tepid, or warm BCP approach seems to be best for high‐risk patients, and can be recommended for all operations. Del Nido cardioplegia appears to provide excellent protection, but the timing of redelivery to optimize protection in cases requiring prolonged periods of cardioplegic arrest has not been clarified.
- **B.** A proposal for BCP strategy (except DN cardioplegia) is as follows:
  - **1.** Use warm induction for severely ischemic hearts only.
  - **2.** Induce cardioplegic arrest with about one liter of cardioplegia, giving about 750 mL of antegrade infusion (warm, cold, or tepid) initially, followed by 250 mL of RCP. The latter is especially important in patients with severe coronary artery disease. If temperature monitoring is used for cold cardioplegia, it should be maintained at less than 20 °C. The amounts of both ACP and RCP delivered may need to be modified depending on how effective they appear to be, based on the nature of coronary disease, temperature, or pH monitoring.
  - **3.** For valve surgery, after the initial antegrade dose, use either continuous warm RCP or intermittent cold retrograde BCP with a low‐potassium solution every 20 minutes. If aortic insufficiency is present, administer cardioplegia retrograde, and if there is a large right coronary artery, consider direct antegrade administration into the right coronary ostium.
  - **4.** For redo aortic valve surgery in patients with a patent ITA, the ITA pedicle may be left unclamped. Systemic hypothermia to at least 28 °C with use of continuous cold retrograde blood or BCP should provide adequate myocardial protection.
  - **5.** For coronary surgery, perform the right coronary graft first and administer low‐ potassium cardioplegia down that graft simultaneously with RCP for all subsequent administrations. Antegrade delivery, of course, cannot be delivered down pedicled ITA grafts and is best avoided in free grafts (ITA or radial artery) to avoid the potential adverse impact of graft manipulation and hyperkalemia on endothelial function.
    - **a.** Administer cardioplegia down each saphenous vein bypass graft as it is completed along with additional RCP. Concomitant administration down all completed grafts along with RCP might be helpful (Figure 6.3). If it is elected not to use RCP, alternating distal and proximal anastomoses will allow for antegrade delivery down the completed grafts.
    - **b.** The duration of aortic cross‐clamping is lengthened when both proximal and distal anastomoses are performed during a single aortic cross‐clamp (SAC) period rather than performing the proximal anastomosis with partial aortic clamping (PAC). Although some literature supported the tradeoff of a longer period of cardioplegic arrest for the lower risk of stroke with SAC, other studies have not found any difference in stroke risk comparing SAC with PAC.92–94 However, the risk is least when the aorta is not clamped at all, using ITA inflow or proximal aortic seal devices, such as the Heartstring device (MAQUET), for the proximal anastomoses.95

**Figure 6.3 •** (A) Technique of administering cardioplegia simultaneously down the completed vein grafts and the retrograde cannula. If proximal anastomoses are done during the cross‐clamp period, cardioplegia is usually given retrograde, but it can be delivered into the aortic root and down the completed grafts after deairing the root. (B) Blood can be delivered off the aortic line during construction of the proximal anastomoses if they are performed with a sideclamp on the aorta.

- **6.** If warm RCP is used, it should be run as continuously as possible as long as it does not interfere with exposure. A high‐potassium solution should be used if there is return of cardiac activity.
- **7.** Administer approximately 500 mL of "hot shot" retrograde just prior to removal of the cross‐clamp. If RCP is not used, give this into the aortic root at a pressure that does not exceed 50–80 mm Hg after ensuring that there is no air in the aortic root. This is probably only beneficial in hearts that were actively ischemic or after long cross‐clamp times. The addition of aspartate–glutamate to the reperfusion solution may have benefit in actively ischemic hearts.
- **8.** In circulatory arrest cases for aortic root and arch surgery, cardioplegia should be either administered directly into the coronary ostia or given retrograde just prior to or at the time that circulatory arrest is initiated.
- **9.** Careful adherence to the basic principles of cardioplegia, including maintenance of arrest, antegrade and retrograde delivery, and multidosing, in particular for Buckberg‐type solutions, should allow surgeons to patiently yet expeditiously perform even the most complex, time‐consuming operations without worrying about poor myocardial protection.
