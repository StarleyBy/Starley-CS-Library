# **3** General Preoperative Considerations and Preparation of the Patient for Surgery

#### **I. General Considerations**

- **A.** When a patient is considered a potential candidate for cardiac surgery, a comprehensive evaluation of their overall medical condition and comorbidities is essential. This includes a detailed history and physical examination, which may identify cardiac and noncardiac problems that may need to be addressed perioperatively to minimize postoperative morbidity (Table 3.1). On occasion, the presence of multiple comorbidities and/or a compromised quality of life may contraindicate a surgical procedure that might otherwise seem to be indicated from a cardiac perspective. Attention should also be paid to identifying new cardiac abnormalities that may have arisen since the initial cardiac evaluation that may warrant further work‐up. Baseline laboratory tests, if not recently performed, are also obtained, and further evaluation and consultation are performed, if indicated.
- **B.** Evaluation of demographic factors, cardiac disease, and noncardiac comorbidities can provide the surgeon, the patient, and the patient's family an insight into the risk of surgery. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) operative risk calculator is available online at www.sts.org and is updated every few years with an increasing number of data entry fields. This provides a reliable computerized assessment of mortality for most types of cardiac surgical procedures and also quantitates the risk of important postoperative morbidities, such as re‐exploration for bleeding, stroke, prolonged ventilation, and renal failure. In other countries, the additive and logistic EuroSCORE, available at www.euroscore.pil‐media.com), is used for similar purposes. The cardiac surgeon can use this information when discussing the proposed operative plan with the patient, during which an informed consent discussion detailing potential complications is essential. Data entry into software programs compatible with the STS database allows surgeons to obtain an extensive analysis of their hospital's unadjusted and risk‐adjusted results and a comparison with national norms.
- **C.** A cardiac anesthesiologist should interview and examine the patient and discuss issues related to sedation, anesthetic medications, monitoring lines, awakening from anesthesia, and mechanical ventilation. The anesthesiologist should also carefully review the patient's medications and make recommendations (in conjunction with the surgeon's policies)

#### **Table 3.1 • Preoperative Evaluation for Open‐Heart Surgery**

#### **History (concerns in parentheses)**

- 1. Smoking (COPD, bronchospasm, oxygenation)
- 2. Alcohol (cirrhosis, postoperative withdrawal)
- 3. Diabetes (wound infections, use of bilateral ITAs, risk of protamine reaction)
- 4. Neurologic symptoms (transient ischemic attacks, remote stroke, previous carotid endarterectomy)
- 5. Vein stripping (alternative conduits)
- 6. Distal vascular reconstruction (alternative conduits)
- 7. Urologic symptoms (antibiotics for UTI, catheter placement problems)
- 8. Ulcer disease/GI bleeding (stress prophylaxis)
- 9. Active infections (urinary tract, leg ulcerations)
- 10. Coagulation issues (need for bridging off warfarin, cessation of medications)
- 11. Current medications, especially antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulants
- 12. Drug allergies
- 13. Previous cardiothoracic surgery or interventions (pleural adhesions during ITA takedown)

#### **Physical Examination**

- 1. Skin infections/rash
- 2. Dental caries (valve surgery)
- 3. Vascular examination: carotid bruits (stroke), abdominal aneurysm and peripheral pulses (IABP placement, groin cannulation for minimally invasive procedures or aortic surgery)
- 4. Differential arm blood pressures (use of pedicled ITA grafts)
- 5. Heart/lungs (congestive heart failure, new murmur)
- 6. Varicose veins (alternative conduits)

#### **Laboratory Tests**

- 1. Hematology: CBC, PT, PTT, platelet count
- 2. Chemistry: electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, blood glucose, liver function tests (baseline for use of statins)
- 3. Arterial blood gases if room air O2 saturation <90%
- 4. TSH (if amiodarone to be used)
- 5. Hemoglobin A1c level (assessment of diabetic control or to capture undiagnosed diabetes)
- 6. BNP/pro‐BNP level
- 7. Urinalysis
- 8. Chest x‐ray PA and lateral
- 9. Electrocardiogram
- 10. Vein mapping (varicosities, prior vein stripping)
- 11. Pulmonary function tests with room air blood gas (quantitate COPD in smokers)

- about whether certain medications should be modified or discontinued preoperatively.
- **D.** Providing patients with information booklets related to their cardiac disease and proposed procedure is invaluable in alleviating some of the stress and anxiety of having to undergo cardiac surgery. If possible, nurses or physician assistants with experience in postoperative care should discuss a clinical care pathway so that the patient has a realistic expectation of what will transpire during the hospital stay. Informing the patient of what procedures will take place and when, what is expected of them on each day, when discharge should be anticipated, and what the options are for posthospital discharge care (home healthcare, rehabilitation facility, or skilled nursing facility) is extremely beneficial in enhancing the patient's involvement in their own care and promoting a prompt recovery from surgery and early hospital discharge.

# **II. History**

- **A.** The nature, duration, and pattern of the patient's cardiac symptoms should be briefly summarized to allow for symptomatic classification using either the Canadian Classification System (for angina) or the New York Heart Association (NYHA) system (for both angina and heart failure symptoms) (see Appendices IB and IC). The latter is included in the STS risk model. A careful history of medical problems and a complete "review of systems" for noncardiac issues could influence care and draw attention to issues that may need to be addressed perioperatively.
- **B. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease** (COPD) is a term often applied to patients with a significant smoking history independent of the degree of respiratory impairment. However, the degree of COPD is best defined by pulmonary function testing (PFTs). Although this is not essential in patients without functional limitations, there is a significant discrepancy between clinical symptoms and spirometric values in 30–40% of patients.1,2 Thus, failure to perform spirometry testing may lead to underreporting of COPD and thus an underestimation of the risk of adverse outcomes in the STS database.
  - **1.** The definitions of chronic lung disease in version 2.40 (2020) of the STS database specifications are as follows:
    - **a.** Mild: forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1 ) 60–75% of predicted and/or on chronic inhaled or oral bronchodilator therapy
    - **b.** Moderate: FEV1 50–59% of predicted and/or on chronic steroid therapy
    - **c.** Severe: FEV1 <50% predicted and/or room air PO2 <60 torr or PCO2 >50 torr
  - **2.** Although there are reports that the severity of COPD does not correlate with the risk of respiratory failure or mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG),3,4 most studies have shown that patients with severe COPD have higher risks of pneumonia, prolonged ventilation, atrial fibrillation (AF), deep sternal wound infection, length of stay, and an increased operative mortality.2,5–8 These complications may be more prevalent in elderly patients and those on steroids. Because of the association of COPD with other risk factors, such as hypertension, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and poor left ventricular (LV) function, patients with COPD have compromised long‐term survival following CABG.3 One study found a higher, yet comparable, incidence of respiratory complications in patients with COPD after off‐pump and on‐pump coronary surgery.9

- **3.** The patient's physiologic reserve and functional status, including the ability to walk up a flight of stairs or several hundred feet on a level surface, are sometimes as important, if not more important, than spirometric values in determining whether the patient can tolerate a surgical procedure. However, markedly abnormal PFTs, including an FEV1 <0.6 or less than 50% predicted, a FEV1 /FVC ratio <70% predicted, and a diffusion capacity <50% predicted, are associated with greater morbidity and mortality after cardiac surgery.2,4–10
- **4.** The differential diagnosis of worsening dyspnea includes both exacerbation of COPD and congestive heart failure (HF). The chest x‐ray may be helpful in differentiating between these two entities, but they are often present concomitantly. It can be difficult to quantitate the cardiac contribution to abnormal PFTs or a low diffusion capacity, especially in patients with mitral valve disease. In this situation, careful clinical judgment must be used in deciding whether surgery will improve the patient's pulmonary status or will leave the patient a pulmonary cripple.
  - **a.** B‐type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is secreted by the atria and ventricles in patients with systolic and diastolic dysfunction, with levels generally correlating with the patient's age and ejection fraction (EF).11 BNP levels are helpful in differentiating whether dyspnea is primarily of cardiac or pulmonary origin. A BNP level <100 pg/mL indicates that a patient's dyspnea is most likely related to a primary pulmonary process, such as exacerbation of COPD. In contrast, dyspnea in a patient with a BNP level >500 pg/mL is usually caused by decompensated heart failure. Intermediate values may be associated with LV dysfunction without decompensation, but a pulmonary process must also be considered in the differential diagnosis.12
  - **b.** An elevated preoperative BNP level (>385 pg/mL in two studies) is a predictor of postoperative LV dysfunction, the requirement for inotropic or intra‐aortic balloon pump support, and is associated with greater perioperative one‐ and five‐year mortality after cardiac surgery.13–16
  - **c.** Some hospitals measure pro‐BNP levels, which are interpreted in a similar fashion to the BNP. Values may vary depending on the hospital's reference range and also differ with age. A normal pro‐BNP is <125 pg/mL for patients <age 75 and <450 pg/mL for patients >age 75. Levels >450 pg/mL under age 50, >900 pg/mL for ages 50–75, and >1800 pg/mL for patients over age 75 are consistent with acute heart failure.17
- **5.** Baseline pulse oximetry on room air should be obtained on every patient, and if the oxygen saturation is less than 90%, arterial blood gases (ABGs) on room air should be obtained. If the patient has significant COPD or interstitial lung disease, ABGs can be valuable for comparison with postoperative values when weaning the patient from the ventilator. An elevated PCO2 (>50 torr) is a significant marker for postoperative pulmonary morbidity and mortality. Additionally, patients on home oxygen or with a baseline PO2 <60 torr are extremely borderline operative candidates.
- **6.** In addition to significant COPD, pulmonary complications are more common in patients who actively smoke, as they often have a productive cough or lower respiratory colonization. Other risk factors include advanced age, obesity, diabetes, preoperative cardiac instability, pulmonary hypertension, emergency surgery, and a history of cerebrovascular disease.18–20 A logistic risk model in patients undergoing

- valve surgery found respiratory failure to be more common with age >70, diabetes, prior myocardial infarction (MI), congestive HF, reoperations or emergency operations, surgery for endocarditis, complex operations, and for bypass times over three hours (see Figure 10.2, p. 471).21
- **7.** Actively smoking patients should be advised to terminate smoking at least four weeks (and preferably two months) before surgery to decrease the volume of airway secretions and improve mucociliary transport.22 Actively smoking patients are more prone to postoperative hypoxemia, more obstructive and restrictive abnormalities in pulmonary function, more coughing that can lead to sternal dehiscence, increased fibrinogen levels and platelet aggregation leading to more thrombotic complications, and an increased risk of sternal wound infection.20,22,23 Use of medications to assist smokers to quit, such as varenicline (Chantix) or bupropion HCL (Zyban), should be recommended as soon as possible once the patient understands the adverse influence of smoking on the perioperative course and the long‐term results of surgery. However, some patients have extreme difficulty stopping smoking due to their nicotine addiction and simply cannot stop prior to surgery. Unfortunately, not smoking for just a few days before surgery is probably of little benefit and may increase airway secretions. If a patient indicates that they have stopped smoking, further inquiry as to when this occurred is important, because being off of cigarettes for a few days ("Yes, I quit") while hospitalized still places the patient at increased risk of pulmonary complications.
- **8.** An active pulmonary or bronchitic process (evidenced by a productive cough) should be resolved before surgery using antibiotics. Bronchospastic disease should be treated with bronchodilators and, if severe, with steroids. Pulmonary consultation may be indicated in this situation. Short‐term pulmonary rehabilitation is effective in improving perioperative pulmonary function in patients with significant COPD and can reduce the risk of pulmonary complications.24
- **9.** Some patients on chronic high‐dose amiodarone therapy are prone to the development of pulmonary toxicity and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after surgery. This is manifested by dyspnea, hypoxia, radiographic infiltrates, and a decrease in diffusion capacity. This problem carries a very high mortality rate.25 Evidence of preoperative pulmonary toxicity with a decrease in diffusion capacity may contraindicate a cardiac surgical procedure. Avoidance of potential contributing causes, such as a high inspired oxygen fraction, long duration of bypass, and fluid overload, is critical. On rare occasions, this syndrome may occur after a very short course of amiodarone, and it appears to be an idiosyncratic or hypersensitivity reaction.26 Although baseline PFTs are not necessary in patients on a short‐ term course of amiodarone for AF prophylaxis, they should be considered when it is anticipated that the amiodarone may be given for more than one month (e.g. after a Maze procedure).
- **C.** A history of heavy **alcohol** abuse identifies potential problems with intraoperative bleeding and postoperative hepatic dysfunction, agitation, and alcohol withdrawal. Prevention of postoperative delirium tremens (DTs) with thiamine, folate, and benzodiazepines should be considered. Bioprosthetic valves should be selected to avoid postoperative anticoagulation.
  - **1.** Mildly elevated liver function tests (LFTs) are often of unclear significance and usually do not require further evaluation. However, in a patient with a drinking

- history, this does not exclude the possibility of alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis, and a gastrointestinal (GI) consultation may be indicated. A common cause of mildly elevated LFTs is use of a statin medication for dyslipidemia. Patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) can also develop cirrhosis that should be evaluated in a similar fashion.
- **2.** A history of GI bleeding, an elevated prothrombin time (reported as the INR), a low serum albumin indicating impaired synthetic function or malnutrition, an elevated bilirubin, or a low platelet count may suggest the presence of severe cirrhosis with portal hypertension and/or hypersplenism. A liver biopsy may be indicated to evaluate the risk of surgery and the potential for postoperative hepatic failure. If surgery is performed in a patient with esophageal varices, transesophageal echocardiography should probably be avoided.
- **3.** Two risk models that have been used in cirrhotic patients to predict outcomes are the Child‐Turcotte‐Pugh (CTP) and the Mayo End‐Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores. Patients with CTP class A cirrhosis (Table 3.2) will usually tolerate cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), but may have a higher risk of postoperative complications, including infections due to immune dysfunction and poor nutritional status, bleeding from impaired coagulation factor synthesis and thrombocytopenia, GI complications, and respiratory, renal, and hepatic failure.27 Risk factors for mortality in patients with cirrhosis include older age, higher bilirubin levels, high central venous pressures, ascites, emergency surgery, prolonged CPB time, and perioperative thrombocytopenia.27,28
- **4.** Patients with advanced alcoholic cirrhosis (class C) or a CTP score ≥8 are generally not candidates for cardiac surgery. The operative mortality rate for patients with cirrhosis in general is very high, with a literature review in 2015 reporting that the average operative mortality after cardiac surgery was 9% for class A, 37.7% for class B, and 52% for class C cirrhosis.29 Furthermore, the one‐year mortality rates were also very high at 27.2, 66.2, and 78.9%, respectively. Nonetheless, there are isolated small series showing better survival rates. One study from Taiwan reported

|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------|--|
| Total bilirubin (mg/dL)                                           | Albumin (g/dL)                 | INR                   |  |
| <2: 1 point                                                       | >3.5: 1 point                  | <1.7: 1 point         |  |

- an overall operative mortality of 16%, and even though only 9% of the patients were CTP class C, mortality did not correlate with CTP or MELD class.30
- **5.** The MELD score includes both hepatic and renal variables and is considered a more sensitive indicator of surgical risk.28 It is calculated from a summation of multiples of natural logarithms of the INR, serum creatinine, and total bilirubin (see calculator at www.mayoclinic.org/meld). A surgical mortality risk of 50% for a MELD score ≥15 was noted in one study,31 and a mortality risk of 56% for a score exceeding >13.5 was reported in another, which also noted only a 23.8% one‐year survival in these patients.28 An additional ominous sign is an associated platelet count of less than 96,000/μL (reflecting advanced liver fibrosis).32
- **6.** With recognition that CPB is a major contributing factor to adverse outcomes, off‐pump surgery should be considered in patients with advanced liver disease if their lifestyle and lifespan are compromised primarily by their heart disease.33
- **D. Diabetes mellitus** is a condition associated with extensive and diffuse atherosclerotic disease due to metabolic derangements and a proinflammatory and prothrombotic state.34 It may range in severity from mild hyperglycemia controlled with diet or oral medications to more severe diabetes requiring insulin. The more severe and uncontrolled the diabetes, the greater the risk of obesity, congestive HF, PVD, extensive coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic kidney disease.35 Nonetheless, the long‐ term prognosis in diabetics with multivessel disease is improved with surgery.36,37
  - **1.** Generally, diabetes is associated with an increased postoperative risk of stroke, infection, renal dysfunction, and operative mortality, even after off‐pump surgery.35,38 A decrease in saphenous vein graft patency (hence the desire to use more arterial grafts) and a worse long‐term survival have also been noted.39 Noninsulin‐ dependent diabetics tend to fare somewhat better, with a lower immediate risk of postoperative complications, including respiratory and renal failure and mediastinitis. Their long‐term prognosis is favorable in the absence of significant comorbidities.34,37
  - **2.** An elevated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) >7% is a marker for poorly controlled diabetes in the previous 3–4 months and has been associated with more adverse outcomes, including sternal wound infection, stroke, renal failure, and MI, as well as reduced long‐term survival after CABG.40–43 One study showed that the CABG mortality risk increased fourfold when the HbA1c was >8.6%.44
  - **3.** To optimize perioperative care, careful attention to potential diabetic‐related complications is essential.
    - **a.** Any preexisting infections must be treated (urinary infections are particularly common in diabetic women).
    - **b.** The STS guidelines recommend that oral hypoglycemics should be withheld for 24 hours prior to surgery and insulin should not be used after an evening meal the night before surgery.45,46 Monitoring of intraoperative glucose levels and aggressive treatment to maintain blood glucose in the 120–180 mg/dL range is essential to reduce neurologic morbidity and the risk of infection.46 Interestingly, a literature review suggested that patients with perioperative hyperglycemia, even if not diabetic, had worse outcomes, with twice the mortality at one year compared with normoglycemic patients; however, patients with well‐controlled diabetes may have comparable outcomes to those without diabetes with similar glycemic control.47

- **c.** In diabetic patients with any element of chronic kidney disease, steps must be taken during cardiac catheterization and surgery to optimize renal function (see Chapter 12).
- **d.** The long‐term results of CABG in diabetics are improved with use of bilateral internal thoracic arteries (BITA) or radial artery grafts, since saphenous vein graft patency is compromised in diabetics. Despite multiple reports indicating an association between BITA use and the increased risk of deep sternal wound infections, especially in obese diabetic woman, other reports suggest that this is not the case with meticulous skeletonized ITA harvesting.48–52 Notably, diabetics may be more prone to phrenic nerve dysfunction after ITA harvesting, so cauterizing near the phrenic nerve must be avoided.53
- **e.** Although most patients are currently managed with glargine insulin (Lantus), which has improved efficacy and safety outcomes compared with NPH insulin,54 the few patients currently taking NPH insulin are at increased risk of experiencing an allergic reaction to protamine.55
- **f.** Management of postoperative hyperglycemia with a defined protocol (see Appendix 6) is an essential element of perioperative care and has been shown to reduce operative morbidity and mortality.45 An endocrine consultation may be helpful in patients with refractory hyperglycemia.
- **E. Neurologic symptoms**, whether active (transient ischemic attack [TIA]) or remote (history of a stroke), increase the risk of perioperative stroke and warrant evaluation.56,57 Approximately 10–15% of patients requiring CABG have significant carotid disease. Selective screening limited to patients >age 65, or those with carotid bruits, TIA, or stroke can identify most patients at high risk.58 Patients with hypertension, PVD, and particularly women with left main disease or calcified aortas are also at higher risk and should be screened.59
  - **1.** Generally, a carotid noninvasive study with ultrasound imaging and measurement of flow velocities should be performed in the patient with neurologic symptoms, a history of a carotid endarterectomy (CEA), or asymptomatic carotid bruits to assess for significant stenoses or flow‐limiting lesions. A peak systolic velocity (PSV) >230 cm/s in the internal carotid artery (ICA), an ICA/common carotid artery PSV >4.0 cm/s, or an end‐diastolic velocity >100 cm/s associated with significant plaque burden by ultrasonic imaging is consistent with significant stenosis. Further evaluation by carotid arteriography (usually magnetic resonance angiography) may be considered if noninvasive studies are inconclusive or a more precise visualization of the carotid vessels is desired.
  - **2.** Actively symptomatic carotid disease always warrants CEA either prior to or at the time of cardiac surgery. A combined CABG–CEA should be performed in the patient with unstable angina or significant myocardium at risk if neurologic symptoms are present.
  - **3.** The management of asymptomatic carotid lesions in patients requiring cardiac surgery is controversial and is noted in the discussion of carotid bruits (see section III.D, pages 184–185).
- **F.** A history of **saphenous vein stripping and/or ligation or distal vascular reconstructive procedures** using saphenous vein alerts the surgeon to potential problems obtaining satisfactory conduit for bypass grafting.

- **1.** Noninvasive venous mapping of the lower extremities may identify satisfactory greater or lesser saphenous veins for use, but it is not always reliable.60 Consideration should be given to whether bilateral ITAs can be used to reach the surgical targets or whether their use is contraindicated (morbidly obese and diabetic females in particular).
- **2.** Doppler assessment of the palmar arch or digital plethysmography with radial compression can be performed to assess the feasibility of using the radial artery as a bypass conduit (i.e. confirming that the arm is ulnar‐dominant). Contraindications may also include Raynaud's disease, radial dominance, and possibly prior radial artery catheterization. Informing the patient of potential complications of radial artery harvesting, specifically numbness of the dorsum of the thumb and part of the thenar eminence or thumb weakness from trauma to the superficial radial nerve, is essential, as it may occur in 30–35% of patients.61,62 An increased incidence of forearm neurologic deficits has been noted in smokers, older patients, and those with diabetes, obesity, and PVD.63,64
- **3.** Venipunctures and intravenous (IV) catheters should be avoided in the arm from which the radial artery will be harvested. The anesthesiologist should also be alerted to avoid placing a radial artery line or IV catheter in that arm for the surgical procedure.
- **G. Urologic symptoms** suggest the presence of an active urinary tract infection (UTI) that must be treated before surgery. In men, a history of prostatic cancer treated by irradiation, a prior transurethral resection, or other urinary symptoms consistent with prostatic hypertrophy identify potential problems with Foley catheter placement in the operating room. Use of a coudé catheter may be necessary. Urologic consultation should be obtained if a catheter cannot be passed. Either a catheter may be placed after dilating the urethra or a suprapubic tube may be inserted. Prolonged postoperative urinary drainage should be anticipated until the patient is fully ambulatory or until further urologic evaluation has been performed.
- **H.** A history of significant **ulcer disease** or **GI bleeding** may necessitate further evaluation by endoscopy, especially if the patient will require postoperative anticoagulation. However, invasive diagnostic tests may need to be deferred in patients with significant coronary disease. Use of postoperative proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) should be considered in these patients, but whether stress prophylaxis should be used routinely or even in ICU patients considered at high risk for GI bleeding remains controverisal.65–67 Gastric acid suppression with PPIs or histamine antagonists may be beneficial in reducing the risk of stress ulceration, but their use is associated with an increased risk of pneumonia. This risk is minimized with the use of sucralfate, which, however, has not been shown to reduce the risk of GI bleeding in critically ill patients.68 Nonetheless, sucralfate is commonly given routinely, and PPIs should be considered in patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy or receiving one antiplatelet drug with additional risk factors for bleeding.66
- **I.** The risk of **infection** is increased if another infectious source is present in the body (commonly a urinary tract or skin infection). Concurrent infections must be identified and treated before surgery. An upper respiratory infection may increase the risk of pulmonary complications, and bacterial infections may increase the risk of a hematogenous sternal wound infection and can seed a prosthetic heart valve. To reduce the risk of methicillin‐resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA) infections, prophylaxis

- with nasal mupirocin can be universally recommended unless a preliminary nasal swab is negative.69,70
- **J.** The patient's **medications** should be reviewed to determine which ones to continue up to the time of surgery and which ones to stop in advance or not take the morning of surgery (see section IV, starting on page 186, and section VII, pages 198–199). Patients on chronic steroid therapy should receive a stress dose of hydrocortisone 100 mg IV at the beginning of surgery and should be given a few doses afterwards as well.
- **K.** The patient's **allergies** must be carefully reviewed and listed in the medical record. Commonly, an adverse reaction is considered an allergy to the patient, but it does alert the healthcare team to medications that are best avoided after surgery to minimize side effects. Alternative antibiotic prophylaxis may be required for true antibiotic allergies. Just the mention of a potential latex allergy should be brought to the attention of the operating room to avoid any latex‐containing products (including gloves, urinary catheters, Swan‐Ganz catheters, and tourniquets used during surgery).
- **L.** Other significant past medical history, such as prior chest irradiation for cancer (usually for mediastinal lymphoma, breast, or lung cancer) or a psychiatric history, should be detailed in the medical record. A thorough review of systems should be able to identify other comorbid conditions likely to affect the outcome of surgery.

### **III. Physical Examination**

- **A.** The patient's general appearance, mental status, and affect should be evaluated and noted in the medical record as a baseline for comparison with the postoperative period. Prior to transcatheter procedures, a mini‐mental examination is performed as part of "frailty" testing.
- **B.** An active **skin infection** or **rash** that might be secondarily infected must be treated before surgery to minimize the risk of sternal wound infection.
- **C. Dental caries** must be treated before operations during which prosthetic material (valves, grafts) will be placed.71,72 Dental extractions, however, should be recommended cautiously in patients with severe ischemic heart disease or critical aortic stenosis. Cardiac complications may occur even if dental procedures are performed under local anesthesia. A report from the Mayo Clinic found that 3% of patients died within 30 days of dental work done in anticipation of surgery.73
- **D. Carotid bruits** are a marker of carotid disease, which is present in about 10–15% of patients with significant coronary disease. Carotid noninvasive studies are warranted in virtually all patients with bruits to assess for high‐grade unilateral or bilateral disease because of the association of severe carotid disease with postoperative stroke, which is associated with significant mortality.74,75
  - **1.** The management of the patient with an asymptomatic carotid lesion requiring open‐ heart surgery is controversial. A meta‐analysis from 1999 suggested that a combined CEA–CABG had a higher death or stroke rate than a staged approach.76 However, another meta‐analysis from 2014 showed equivalent results between the two approaches.77 Another study showed equivalent results between a staged carotid stenting–CABG approach and a combined CEA–CABG, with both having lower MI rates than a staged CEA–CABG approach.78 These studies suggest that combined approaches are noninferior to staged approaches, but, for the latter, there must not be too much of a delay before the second procedure (the CABG) to prevent cardiac events in the interim.

- **2.** Because carotid disease is a marker for aortic atherosclerosis, it is not surprising that stroke risk is greater in patients with aortic calcification or atherosclerosis, likely explaining why half of perioperative strokes following combined operations occur contralateral to the operated side.79
- **3.** If the patient presents with an acute coronary syndrome or has a large degree of myocardium at risk, most surgeons would consider performing a combined CABG–CEA for a unilateral carotid stenosis >90%. In contrast, preliminary CEA or stenting would be the preferred approach in patients with stable angina and might result in a lower overall risk of stroke, MI, and death. For patients requiring emergency CABG, that procedure alone is indicated, accepting the slightly increased risk of stroke with known carotid disease.
- **4.** The risk of stroke with bilateral disease (>75% bilaterally) is significant during isolated CABG (as high as 10–15% in one report), especially in patients with unilateral stenosis with contralateral occlusion.74 However, it remains quite significant even with a combined operation. Thus, the operations should be staged with the CEA performed first if cardiac disease permits. If this is not possible because of unstable angina, left main or severe three‐vessel disease with a large amount of "myocardium in jeopardy", preliminary carotid stenting or a combined operation should be performed, with the understanding that the risk of stroke is somewhat increased.
- **E. Bilateral arm blood pressures** should be measured. A differential systolic blood pressure of >10 mm Hg may identify significant subclavian artery stenosis, which is a relative contraindication to the use of a pedicled ITA graft.80 This finding is also noted in some patients presenting with a type A aortic dissection.
- **F.** The presence of a **heart murmur** warrants a preoperative echocardiogram if no valvular abnormality had been identified at the time of catheterization. Occasionally, new‐onset ischemic mitral regurgitation or unsuspected aortic valve disease will be detected. In terms of valve selection, risk assessment, and informed consent, it is certainly preferable that the need for an additional valve procedure be recognized before surgery, rather than being identified for the first time in the operating room.
- **G.** An **abdominal aortic aneurysm** detected upon palpation should be evaluated by ultrasound. IABP placement through the femoral artery should be avoided to prevent distal atheroembolism. Further evaluation by CT scanning is warranted before considering femoral artery cannulation for a minimally invasive procedure.
- **H.** Severe **peripheral vascular disease** (PVD) must be assessed by a careful pulse examination. It is often associated with cerebrovascular disease and may prompt a preoperative carotid noninvasive study.59 PVD adversely affects long‐term survival after cardiac surgery, but it is not predictive of operative mortality, although it is included in the STS risk calculator.81–83 Weak femoral pulses may be indicative of "inflow" aortoiliac disease. If the ascending aorta is also significantly diseased and an alternative cannulation site must be utilized for CPB, the axillary artery should be considered.84
  - **1.** Aortoiliac disease may dictate the unsuitability of the femoral arteries for cannulation, especially for minimally invasive valve surgery, or for placement of an IABP. An abdominal pelvic CT scan to assess the iliofemoral system may dictate whether percutaneous femoral cannulation is feasible or whether it runs the risk of a retrograde dissection or even retrograde embolization of atherosclerotic debris to the brain on CPB.

- **2.** Abdominal‐pelvic CT scanning is an essential component of the work‐up for transcatheter aortic valve replacements (TAVRs). Vessel tortuosity, calcification, and size need to be assessed to determine whether a transfemoral or alternate access approach is indicated.
- **3.** PVD may contribute to poor leg wound healing after saphenous vein harvesting, although this is generally not a significant problem with endoscopic vein harvesting. If there are plans for future peripheral vascular reconstruction, the vein should be harvested from the opposite leg.
- **I.** The presence of **varicose veins** or a history of **deep venous thrombosis** (DVT) identifies potential problems with conduits for CABG. The distribution of varicosities may indicate whether or not the greater saphenous vein is involved. Noninvasive venous mapping may identify a normal greater saphenous vein despite significant varicosities.60 The lesser saphenous vein distribution should be inspected to determine whether it might serve as a potential conduit. Assessment of the radial artery, as noted in section II.F, should be considered. BITA grafting may be required, so patients considered at increased risk for a sternal infection should be so informed.

# **IV. Adjustment of Medications Prior to Cardiac Surgery**

Review of the patient's prior and current medications is important. Particular attention should be paid to antiplatelet/anticoagulant medications, which should be either continued or stopped prior to surgery, depending on the clinical situation (Tables 3.3 and 3.4).

**A. Aspirin** (ASA) is commonly taken by patients with known ischemic heart disease and is given routinely to patients presenting with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Preoperative use of aspirin is considered beneficial in reducing perioperative

infarction and operative mortality, and improving graft patency and the outcomes of CABG.85–90 However, although this was documented in several meta‐analyses, a trial published by one of the same authors failed to confirm these benefits.88 Aspirin irreversibly acetylates platelet cyclooxygenase, impairing thromboxane A2 formation and inhibiting platelet aggregation for the lifespan of the platelet (7–10 days). Thus, aspirin will be superimposing impaired platelet dysfunction on the clotting derangements induced by CPB.

- **1.** Although the preoperative use of aspirin increases perioperative blood loss, this is generally noted in patients taking doses higher than 81 mg daily. Therefore, it is recommended to continue aspirin 81 mg daily up to the day of surgery in most patients undergoing CABG.87,89,90 In patients undergoing other forms of open‐heart surgery, stopping aspirin 3–5 days in advance should be sufficient to allow for significant regeneration of the platelet pool to minimize its antiplatelet effects.
- **2.** Patient response to the antiplatelet effects of aspirin is quite variable. Some patients are somewhat resistant (often from using enteric‐coated aspirin), and others have prominent platelet inhibition. A variety of platelet aggregometry tests are available to assess the antiplatelet effect of aspirin, but they do not necessarily correlate with the degree of platelet inhibition, and are rarely indicated before surgery.91 Patients taking higher doses of aspirin and those with conditions associated with platelet dysfunction, such as uremia and von Willebrand's disease, may also exhibit more bleeding. If these patients are recognized, it may be advisable to stop aspirin a few days before surgery.
- **3.** Studies have shown that there is enhanced platelet aggregation and thromboxane formation in the early postoperative period, even in patients receiving preoperative aspirin.92 Thus, patients with aspirin resistance will have greater platelet reactivity, which is associated with an increased risk of graft thrombosis.93 Although various studies provide conflicting data on whether platelet activation is greater following on‐ or off‐pump (OPCAB) surgery,94,95 routine use of preoperative aspirin and initiation of aspirin within 6–8 hours after surgery should mitigate the extent of platelet activation and aggregation to some degree, most likely accounting for the improved graft patency, lower rate of perioperative MI, and improved operative survival after both types of surgery.93,96
- **B. The P2Y12 inhibitors** are thienopyridines that inhibit platelet function by irreversibly modifying the platelet adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor P2Y12, which then inhibits ADP‐mediated activation of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor. This results in inhibition of platelet activation and aggregation. These medications are given along with aspirin for one month for patients receiving bare‐metal stents and for 6–12 months for patients with drug‐eluting stents to minimize the risk of stent thrombosis.97 However, many patients are maintained on them indefinitely after PCI. They are also given to patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes and to those in whom PCI is contemplated, whether elective or not.
  - **1. Clopidogrel** is biotransformed through a two‐step process into an active metabolite which produces its antiplatelet effects. Genetic polymorphisms in the CYP2C19 allele reduce this conversion, resulting in clopidogrel resistance. Prior to PCI, a 300–600 mg load is given, which achieves about 40% platelet inhibition within a few hours, followed by 75 mg daily. Despite a half‐life of about seven

- hours, the antiplatelet effect lasts for the lifespan of the platelet, so cessation for five days prior to surgery is recommended in elective situations.89
- **2. Ticagrelor** is a reversible noncompetitive inhibitor of the P2Y12 receptor that has a more rapid onset of action and more pronounced inhibition of platelet function than clopidogrel. Ticagrelor and its metabolite are both pharmacologically active with a peak effect in 1.5 hours after a 180 mg load, which is then followed by 90 mg twice a day. It is more effective than clopidogrel in reducing death in patients with an ACS with a comparable rate (12%) of major bleeding. It has a reversible effect on platelet function with a half‐life of 7–8 hours, with 80% recovery of platelet function by 72 hours.98 This suggests that surgery can be safely performed if ticagrelor has been withheld for 72 hours, although it is still recommended that it be stopped five days prior to surgery.89
- **3. Prasugrel** is a prodrug that is converted to an active metabolite which produces irreversible antagonism of the P2Y12 receptor. It is approximately 10 times more potent than clopidogrel and produces more rapid onset of action with 50% inhibition within one hour. The maximum platelet inhibition is 80%. Although clinically superior to clopidogrel in ACS patients undergoing PCI, it may be associated with a higher risk of bleeding and it is not recommended in patients >age 75 or patients with a history of TIAs or stroke. Despite a comparable half‐life of seven hours, the irreversible effect on platelet function mandates that it be stopped at least seven days before surgery.89
- **4. Cangrelor** is an intravenous reversible inhibitor of P2Y12 which produces nearly 100% platelet inhibition with a rapid onset of action within minutes since it does not require conversion to an active metabolite. It has a half‐life of 3–6 minutes with reversal of effect in 1–2 hours.99
- **5.** The risks of perioperative bleeding, need for transfusions, and re‐exploration for bleeding are unequivocally increased when patients have received a P2Y12 inhibitor within several days of surgery.100 This has led to the recommendation that surgery be delayed 5–7 days following cessation of these drugs.89 However, bleeding is more related to the patient's responsiveness to these medications (primarily clopidogrel) than to the timing of discontinuation.101 Use of platelet function testing can determine the patient's sensitivity to the P2Y12 inhibitor. If platelet inhibition (platelet reactive units, or PRUs) is <30%, surgery can be safely performed without an increased bleeding risk.102
  - **a.** Emergency surgery is indicated for patients with a STEMI or other ACS presentation with refractory ischemia when PCI is not feasible. It is associated with the highest bleeding risk, especially since platelet transfusions given within six hours of a loading dose or four hours after a maintenance dose of a P2Y12 may be less effective because some of the active metabolite may bind exogenous platelets.
  - **b.** Urgent surgery for patients with critical anatomy should usually be performed within a week of catheterization, when antiplatelet effects may not have completely dissipated. Timing of surgery balances the risk of an ischemic event versus the risk of bleeding requiring platelet transfusions. Clearly, surgery should never be delayed if clinically indicated. Use of platelet testing is invaluable in assessing when the risk of bleeding has lessened and surgery can be performed with a lower bleeding risk.

- **c.** Some patients require cardiac surgery despite having received a recent stent. For example, a patient with a STEMI may be found to have multivessel disease, but the culprit lesion may be stented to promptly reperfuse the potential infarct zone, and urgent surgery is then recommended to address the other lesions. Another example is the patient with recurrent chest pain within a few months of receiving a drug‐eluting stent. Stopping a P2Y12 inhibitor for one week prior to surgery will increase the risk of stent thrombosis, so two feasible approaches, other than operating without stopping the P2Y12 inhibitor, are to (1) stop the medication for three days, continue aspirin, and operate with mild residual antiplatelet activity or, preferably, (2) stop the P2Y12 inhibitor five days prior to surgery, continue aspirin, and admit the patient for a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor for a few days, and stop that four hours prior to surgery. Following the operation, the P2Y12 inhibitor is restarted as soon as possible with a loading dose.103
- **d.** It has been suggested that use of an antifibrinolytic medication, such as tranexamic acid, can mitigate some of the bleeding noted in patients in whom a P2Y12 inhibitor was not stopped prior to surgery.104
- **C. Heparin** is given to patients with an ACS before and after cardiac catheterization if urgent surgery is recommended. It is also used in patients in whom an IABP is placed preoperatively. It may also be used as a bridge to surgery in patients taking preoperative warfarin.

- **1. Unfractionated heparin (UFH)** is given using a weight‐based protocol (see Appendix 7) and requires monitoring by a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) to ensure a therapeutic range of approximately 50–60 seconds. Heparin is usually stopped about four hours before surgery. However, in patients with critical CAD, it is best to continue heparin into the operating room. This should not pose a significant risk during the insertion of central lines. When heparin is given for several days, the platelet count should be checked on a daily basis to assess for the development of heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) (see pages 251–253).
- **2. Low‐molecular‐weight heparin (LMWH)** (enoxaparin) binds to antithrombin, which then accelerates inhibition of activated factor Xa, with minimal inhibition of thrombin (factor IIa). It is commonly used in patients with an ACS (1 mg/kg SC twice a day) due to its efficacy and simplicity of use, with no requirement for blood monitoring. It may also be used as an alternative to UFH during cardiac catheterization procedures. It is commonly used for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in hospitalized patients at a dose of 40 mg SC once daily. Studies have reported an increased risk of perioperative bleeding in patients on LMWH.105 It has an elimination half‐life of 4–5 hours and exhibits 30% of anti‐ factor Xa activity at 12 hours. It is recommended that the last dose should be given five half‐lives or approximately 24 hours prior to surgery to minimize perioperative bleeding. Only 60% of LMWH can be neutralized by protamine, although its effect can be reversed by platelet factor 4.106
- **D. Warfarin** is given primarily to patients with mechanical prosthetic valves, AF, a history of DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE), or hypercoagulable disorders. Warfarin should be stopped five days prior to surgery and the INR should be rechecked within 24 hours before the procedure. Bridging anticoagulation is not necessary in low‐risk patients.107,108
  - **1.** Patients at high risk for a clinical event should be bridged to surgery with either UFH or LMWH. For outpatients, LMWH (enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC) is usually given for 2–3 days, starting when the INR is below therapeutic range (usually two days after stopping warfarin) and should be discontinued 24 hours prior to surgery. Since there will still be some residual anticoagulant effect after it is stopped, admission for UFH for a few hours prior to surgery is not necessary. Inpatients may receive UFH, which is then stopped four hours prior to surgery. High‐risk patients include those with the following:108
    - **a.** Mechanical mitral valve replacement
    - **b.** Mechanical aortic valve replacement with any thromboembolic risk factor (e.g. AF, prior thromboembolism, hypercoagulable condition, non‐bileaflet valve, LV systolic dysfunction, or >1 mechanical valve).
    - **c.** AF at high risk for embolic stroke (CHA2 DS2 ‐VASc score ≥5, stroke or systemic embolism within three months, associated rheumatic mitral stenosis)
    - **d.** VTE within the preceding three months
    - **e.** History of prior thromboembolism during interruption of anticoagulation
  - **2.** If the patient requires urgent surgery and has an elevated INR, administration of 5 mg of vitamin K given PO should reduce the INR within 12–24 hours. IV vitamin K given intravenously over 30 minutes is more expeditious in reversing the INR, but it runs the risk of an anaphylactic reaction. Subcutaneous vitamin K has unpredictable and delayed absorption and is not recommended. Fresh frozen plasma

- may be necessary if more emergent surgery is indicated and prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC [Kcentra]) in a dose of 500 units of factor IX (usually 25–50 units/kg) may also be considered for rapid reversal.109
- **3.** For patients requiring pacemaker or ICD implantation, bleeding risk is increased if the patient is on dual antiplatelet therapy or if a high‐risk patient is bridged off of warfarin with heparin. Most studies have not shown an increased bleeding risk if the patient has a therapeutic INR, so for high‐risk patients, it is best not to stop the warfarin prior to these procedures; for low‐risk patients, stopping the warfarin for four days without a bridge is the safest approach.110
- **E.** The **non‐vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants** (NOACs), also termed direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), inhibit either factor IIa (dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor) or factor Xa (apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban) (Table 3.5). They are equivalent, if not superior, to warfarin in reducing the risk of stroke in patients with nonvalvular AF and in the treatment of VTE. They are commonly used in many patients with AF with valvular and structural heart disease, but should **not be used** in higher‐risk patients with mechanical valves or rheumatic mitral valve disease.108,111 Their half‐lives average about 12 hours, so they should be stopped 4–5 half‐lives or approximately 48 hours prior to surgery. However, clinical studies have shown that this may not be sufficient in patients with renal dysfunction, so a longer interval of cessation is recommended.108,112 Reversal agents are available when patients require emergency surgery or have significant bleeding (Table 3.5). If these are not available, PCC can be used in a dose of 50–75 units/kg.
- **F. Fondaparinux** (Arixtra) is an indirect factor Xa inhibitor that acts by catalyzing factor Xa inhibition by antithrombin. It is given in a daily dose of 2.5 mg SC for VTE prophylaxis and in a higher weight‐based protocol for established thrombosis (5 mg if

\*Doses: Andexxa (andexanet alfa) = factor Xa (recombinant): 400–800 mg given at 30 mg/min, then 4–8 mg/min × 2 h

Prothrombin complex concentrate: 25–50 units/kg

<sup>1</sup>These are the estimated half-lives with normal renal function; the half-life is influenced by age and GFR.

- <50 kg, 7.5 mg if 50–100 kg, 10 mg if >100 kg). Its use has been essentially supplanted by the NOACs for VTE treatment. Its effects cannot be reversed by protamine and, because of its long elimination half‐life of 17–21 hours, the dose should be withheld for at least 60 hours prior to surgery.
- **G. Bivalirudin** (Angiomax) is a direct thrombin inhibitor that is approved as an alternative to UFH during PCI. Its benefits are a short half‐life (25 minutes) and avoidance of exposure to heparin. The usual dose is a 0.7 mg/kg IV bolus followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg/kg/h during the procedure. Due to its short half‐life, the potential risk of significant surgical bleeding (other than from a femoral artery puncture) would be increased only if an emergency procedure were required within 1–2 hours of its administration. It is the anticoagulant of choice for CPB in the patient with HIT.
- **H. Eptifibatide** (Integrilin) and **tirofiban** (Aggrastat) are short‐acting IV reversible antagonists of fibrinogen binding to the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa platelet receptor.113 They are occasionally used in patients with an ACS and non‐ST‐elevation myocardial infarctions (non‐STEMI) in whom an early invasive strategy is planned. They are usually continued after catheterization along with heparin if CABG is considered the best option for revascularization.
  - **1.** Eptifibatide is given as a 180 μg/kg bolus followed by an infusion of 2 μg/kg/min for 72–96 hours. It has a half‐life of 2.5 hours and platelet function returns to 50–80% of normal within four hours of its cessation.
  - **2.** Tirofiban is given in a dose of 0.4 μg/kg/min for 30 minutes followed by an infusion of 0.1 μg/kg/min for 48–96 hours. It has a half‐life of two hours and platelet aggregation returns to 90% of normal within 4–8 hours after it is stopped.
  - **3.** It is recommended that either medication be stopped approximately four hours prior to surgery (Table 3.3). It is noteworthy, however, that some studies have not identified an increased risk of postbypass bleeding even if these medications are stopped two hours preoperatively or even as late as the time of skin incision. This may be attributable to their transient "platelet anesthesia" effects, which may offset the adverse influence of CPB on platelet number and function.114
  - **4. Abciximab** (ReoPro) is the Fab fragment of a monoclonal antibody that binds to the IIb/IIIa receptor on the surface of platelets. Platelet aggregation is significantly inhibited by preventing the binding of fibrinogen and von Willebrand's factor to this receptor site on activated platelets. This drug has a half‐life of 12 hours, and platelet function may take up to 48 hours to recover. If possible, surgery should be delayed for at least 24 hours after a patient has received abciximab. If emergency surgery is indicated, significant bleeding can be anticipated. Platelet transfusions are effective in producing hemostasis by reducing the overall number of platelet receptors bound to abciximab.115 A hemoconcentrator can remove some of the residual free abciximab, allowing platelets to function more for hemostasis than for binding free antibodies.116 Fortunately, this medication has been supplanted in most centers by the shorter‐acting reversible IIb/IIIa antagonists.
- **I. Thrombolytic therapy** with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is rarely used for STEMI patients, except in centers where emergency catheterization and surgery are not available. If emergency surgery is recommended, one can anticipate a significant bleeding problem. Although the half‐life of these medications is less than 30 minutes, they cause persistent systemic hemostatic defects that outlive their short half‐lives.

- These effects include depletion of fibrinogen, reduction in factor II, V, and VIII levels, impairment of platelet aggregation, and the appearance of fibrin split products. Therefore, surgery should be delayed for at least 24 hours, if possible.
- **J. Nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs** have a reversible effect on platelet cyclooxygenases (COX‐1 and COX‐2), and cause platelet dysfunction by inhibiting formation of thromboxane A2. Their antiplatelet effects are primarily determined by their dosing and half‐lives. Generally, they only need to be stopped a few days before surgery.117
- **K. Omega‐3 fatty acids (fish oils)** have been shown to reduce the incidence of AF after surgery, but have seen limited use due to concerns that they may produce bleeding by inhibiting platelet adhesion and platelet‐stimulated thrombin generation. However, this is apparently evident only when taken with aspirin or factor Xa inhibitors.118,119 There is also a synergistic effect when taken with warfarin due to its inhibitory effect on thrombin generation. Because of these concerns, it has usually been recommended that fish oil, flaxseed oil, and krill oil should be stopped prior to surgery. However, numerous studies and the OPERA randomized trial published in 2018 reported that use of fish oils did not increase perioperative bleeding after cardiac surgery, but all antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulants were stopped preoperatively in these studies.118–120
- **L.** Other products, including vitamin E, ginkgo biloba, garlic, and even flavonoids in purple grape juice, have been shown to inhibit platelet function.121–124 Whether these have any impact on perioperative bleeding or operative outcomes is not defined, but it is not unreasonable to stop them prior to surgery. It is imperative to specifically ask the patient if these products are being taken, since they are usually not volunteered when a list of medications is reviewed.
- **M.** Inquiry should be made about any known clinical bleeding disorder or hypercoagulable state. This may direct perioperative anticoagulant management or provide direction in the treatment of bleeding problems.
  - **1. Antiphospholipid syndrome** is an autoimmune disorder in which antiphospholipid (APL) antibodies (anticardiolipin antibodies) and/or lupus anticoagulant are present. It is a rare phenomenon, but has been associated with valvular pathology. These antibodies produce a hypercoagulable state that may cause arterial and venous thrombosis, even though the coagulation profile shows an elevated PTT and commonly thrombocytopenia. The APL antibodies affect the kaolin‐activated activated clotting time (ACT), so Celite ACTs have been recommended for intraoperative monitoring. However, because the ACT does not necessarily correlate with heparin levels during surgery, it is suggested that the heparin–protamine titration test be used to ensure adequate anticoagulation, aiming for a heparin level of 3.4 units/mL.125,126 One report recommended a heparin level of 3 units/mL for a normal‐risk APS patient and 5 units/mL for a high‐risk patient with a history of APL‐antibody‐associated thrombocytopenia.126 Alternatively, bivalirudin might be considered as a substitute anticoagulant during bypass (see Chapter 4).
  - **2.** Other hypercoagulable states, such as **factor V Leiden mutation**, **prothrombin gene mutation**, **or protein C or S deficiency**, are usually not recognized until the patient sustains a postoperative thrombotic event. However, if these syndromes are known to be present, aggressive anticoagulant measures should be taken to reduce the risk of postoperative thrombosis. Bridging after discontinuation of warfarin

therapy is recommended when the INR is subtherapeutic. If the patient has **antithrombin III deficiency**, which is also a hypercoagulable condition, either fresh frozen plasma or antithrombin III concentrate (Thrombate) may be required to achieve adequate heparinization during CPB.127

# **V. Laboratory Assessment**

#### **A. Complete blood count (CBC), PT, PTT, and platelet count**

- **1.** Patients with moderate anemia (hemoglobin <10 g/dL) have a significantly higher risk of adverse events after surgery as well as a higher operative mortality.128–130 It is likely that the association of anemia with comorbidities such as congestive HF and chronic kidney disease leaves organ systems less tolerant to impaired oxygen delivery, thus contributing to an increase in noncardiac events, such as stroke, renal failure, and even sternal wound infection. Although both anemia and transfusions have been independently associated with adverse outcomes, including mortality, the stronger association may be with the use of transfusions.131,132 Studies continue to be published attesting to the adverse effects of transfusions on surgical results, including an increased risk of graft occlusion, mandating careful patient assessment prior to ordering a transfusion.133–136 Large studies and a meta‐analysis of restrictive vs. liberal transfusion strategies show comparable rates of postoperative infection, stroke, cardiac, respiratory, and renal complications, as well as mortality.137–139
  - **a.** It is not uncommon for hospitalized patients undergoing cardiac catheterization to have a moderate decrease in hematocrit. This may result from repeat blood draws, hydration prior to and after catheterization, and blood loss during the cath procedure itself, although this is much less extensive using radial rather than femoral access for catheterization.
  - **b.** Although a transfusion trigger of a hemoglobin <8 g/dL is recommended in patients with ischemic heart disease, it must be remembered that very low hematocrits on CPB are associated with adverse neurologic and renal outcomes. Furthermore, patients receiving multiple units of blood intraoperatively often have coagulopathies requiring the use of additional blood components. If the anticipated hematocrit on CPB is calculated to be less than 20%, it is not unreasonable to transfuse a hospitalized patient with a hematocrit <26% prior to surgery. This might be beneficial in reducing potential preoperative cardiac ischemia, but more importantly, it may reduce the extent of hemodilution during surgery and the amount of blood and blood component transfusions required during surgery.
- **2.** An elevated WBC may be associated with an infectious process that should be identified before surgery. However, it may also be a generalized marker of inflammation or could reflect the use of steroids or a myelodysplastic disorder. Studies indicate that preoperative leukocytosis is associated with an increased risk of perioperative myocardial injury, stroke, and operative mortality, as well as decreased one‐year survival.140,141
- **3.** It is important to check a daily platelet count in patients maintained on heparin to allow for prompt recognition of potential HIT. If this is suspected based on a falling platelet count, further work‐up is indicated with testing for heparin‐induced platelet aggregation (usually by the serotonin release assay) or serologic testing for

IgG‐specific heparin antibodies.142 If these tests are positive, an alternative means of anticoagulation during bypass may be necessary (see pages 251–253). Routine assessment for heparin antibodies in the absence of thrombocytopenia is not recommended. Preoperative platelet aggregation testing may be beneficial in assessing the residual antiplatelet effects of aspirin and, in particular, the P2Y12 inhibitors, and may influence the appropriate timing of surgery.102,103

#### **B. Basic metabolic panel** (electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, blood glucose) and **hemoglobin A1c**

- **1.** Postoperative acute kidney injury is more common in patients with stage III–IV chronic kidney disease, especially in diabetic patients, and this portends a higher operative mortality and lower long‐term survival.143,144 Adequate hydration during and after cardiac catheterization and delaying on‐pump (not off‐pump) surgery for at least 24 hours after catheterization may minimize renal toxicity.145,146 The serum creatinine should be rechecked after catheterization in patients at increased risk of developing renal dysfunction. If the serum creatinine has increased, surgery should be deferred, if clinically feasible, until it has returned to baseline. However, surgery should not be delayed in critically ill patients with hemodynamic compromise and worsening renal function, since delay will often lead to less reversible renal failure and multisystem organ failure. Specific intraoperative measures and postoperative hemodynamic support are critical to minimize the renal insult (see Chapter 12).
- **2.** Hyperglycemia is associated with adverse outcomes, including stroke, wound infection, renal failure, and mortality.46 Therefore, aggressive perioperative control of blood glucose is essential. An elevated hemoglobin A1c reflects poor diabetic control over the preceding three months and correlates with an increased risk of infection and compromised short‐ and long‐term survival.40–44
- **3.** Hyponatremia is often present in patients on diuretic therapy and those with worse LV function and HF. It is associated with a higher risk of coronary events, wound infections, pneumonia, a prolonged hospital stay, and increased operative mortality.147,148 It can be categorized as hyper‐, eu‐, or hypovolemic hyponatremia based on the serum osmolarity. Assessment of urine sodium levels will help dictate whether treatment may involve fluid restriction, modification of diuretics, or even IV saline solutions.149
- **4.** Hyperkalemia often reflects renal dysfunction and should be treated prior to surgery, since most cardioplegia solutions utilize potassium as the primary arresting agent.
- **C. Liver function tests (LFTs)** including bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (alk phos), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin, and serum amylase should be obtained. New York State registry data have shown that an elevated alk phos and AST were significant predictors of CABG mortality and suggested they should be included in risk models.150 Abnormalities suggestive of hepatitis or cirrhosis may warrant further evaluation. Those associated with chronic passive congestion (tricuspid valve pathology, right heart failure or constriction) may not improve until after surgery has been performed. Occasionally, emergency surgery is indicated in patients with cardiogenic shock and an acute hepatic insult with markedly increased liver enzymes. In this situation, there is a higher risk of severe hepatic dysfunction after surgery. Baseline LFTs are also valuable because all patients should be placed on pre‐ and postoperative statins, the most common side effect of which is an elevation in LFTs.

#### **D. Other laboratory tests to be considered**

- **1. Thyroid‐stimulating hormone (TSH)** levels should be measured preoperatively in the event that amiodarone will be used either prophylactically or therapeutically after surgery for AF. Amiodarone is an iodine‐rich compound that can have a variety of effects on thyroid function, producing either thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism in about 15% of patients receiving chronic amiodarone therapy.151
- **2. BNP and pro‐BNP levels** may be drawn to differentiate among the causes of dyspnea. In patients with systolic or diastolic dysfunction, or heart failure resulting from valvular dysfunction, levels are invariably elevated. Elevated BNP levels are associated with postoperative ventricular dysfunction, an increased need for inotropic or IABP support, and a higher mortality rate after CABG and aortic valve surgery.11–16
- **3. C‐reactive protein** levels are often drawn when patients are admitted to the medical service with acute coronary syndromes. Levels are elevated in patients with infections or inflammatory processes. An elevated preoperative level (>10 mg/L) is associated with increased operative mortality, and a level >5 mg/L is associated with reduced long‐term survival following CABG.152 Elevated levels are also associated with an increased incidence of graft occlusion.
- **E. Urinalysis.** If an initial urinalysis suggests contamination, a "clean‐catch" specimen with proper cleansing should be obtained. If there is suspicion of a UTI, a culture should be obtained. An appropriate antibiotic should be given for several days prior to elective surgery. If the patient requires urgent bypass surgery, one or two doses of an antibiotic providing gram‐negative coverage should suffice, although a few days of treatment might be considered before performing valve surgery.
- **F. Chest x‐ray (PA and lateral).** The x‐ray is essential to rule out any active pulmonary disease that should be treated prior to surgery. Identification of pulmonary nodules should be further evaluated by a preoperative chest CT scan, since radiographic interpretation can be difficult postoperatively. Evidence of severe aortic calcification should prompt a careful review of the ascending aorta from the catheterization films and often a noncontrast CT scan to identify ascending aortic calcification. If present, this may necessitate modification of the operative approach and, in some elderly patients, a determination of inoperability. A lateral film should always be obtained before reoperations through a median sternotomy incision in patients with prior bypass grafting. This gives an assessment of the proximity of the cardiac structures and the ITA pedicle clips to the posterior sternal table. The PA film allows for optimal planning of minimally invasive incisions. Additional significant information that can be derived from a chest x‐ray is noted on pages 123 and 125.
- **G. Electrocardiogram (ECG).** A baseline study should be obtained for comparison with postoperative ECGs. Evidence of an interval infarction or new ischemia since the time of catheterization may warrant reevaluation of ventricular function and, on occasion, a repeat coronary angiogram. Patients being evaluated for elective surgery with active ischemia on ECG should be hospitalized and undergo prompt surgery.
  - **1.** If AF is present, it should be rate‐controlled and its duration ascertained. The likelihood of conversion to sinus rhythm after surgery is nearly 80% for patients in AF for less than six months, but it is unlikely if the AF has been of longer duration. Thus, the duration of AF would influence the aggressiveness of postoperative treatment and possibly influence the decision to perform a Maze procedure in addition to the planned operation.

- **2.** The presence of a left bundle branch block raises the risk of complete heart block occurring during the insertion of a Swan‐Ganz catheter. Advancement of the catheter into the pulmonary artery may be delayed until after the chest is open, unless other provisions for urgent pacing (external pads, transvenous pacing wires) are available. The presence of a bundle branch block also makes it more difficult to detect ischemia. A right bundle branch block with a first‐degree block raises the risk of complete heart block following a TAVR procedure.
- **3.** Patients with significant preoperative bradycardia, especially if not taking β‐blockers, will often require pacing after surgery. Both atrial and ventricular pacing wires should be placed during surgery. Care must be taken to avoid using prophylactic β‐blockers and amiodarone to prevent postoperative AF in these patients since a profound bradycardia might ensue.
- **H.** Most test results are acceptable when performed within one month of surgery. However, it is beneficial to have a CBC, electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine checked within a few days of surgery.

# **VI. Preoperative Blood Donation and Management of Anemia**

- **A.** Preoperative autologous blood donation is a feasible objective in patients with stable angina or valvular heart disease.153 However, its limited use can be ascribed to several factors: (1) the urgency of surgery in most cases; (2) concerns about precipitating angina in patients with severe coronary disease; (3) lessened concern about the transmission of hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus; (4) questions about its cost‐effectiveness with the availability of other measures to reduce blood loss, such as antifibrinolytic drugs, cell‐saving devices, and off‐pump surgery; and (5) logistic blood bank considerations. Thus, it is commonly neither necessary nor encouraged. One unit of blood may be donated every week as long as the hematocrit exceeds 33%, allowing an additional 2–3 weeks before surgery for the hematocrit to return to normal.
- **B.** The use of recombinant erythropoietin with iron supplementation can induce erythropoiesis very rapidly. This is particularly helpful in anemic patients, patients who donate their own blood, and Jehovah Witness patients.154 Single doses in the range of 500–1000 units/kg SC given 1–2 days prior to surgery have been shown to reduce transfusion requirements.155,156 An alternative regimen of 14,000 units SC daily for two days prior to surgery and then 8000 units daily for three more days has also been effective.157
- **C.** Refinement in testing for hepatitis C (1/250,000–1/1,500,000 units) and human immunodeficiency virus (1/750,000 units) has lowered their risks to extremely low levels. This has allayed the morbid fear of many patients of receiving transfusions. Nonetheless, blood transfusions are not benign: they may still cause febrile, allergic, or transfusion reactions and are associated with an increased risk of infection, stroke, renal dysfunction, respiratory complications, and overall mortality.135 A conscientious blood conservation program is beneficial in reducing the need for transfusions (see Chapter 9).136
- **D.** The percentage of patients requiring perioperative blood transfusions has gradually been decreasing, with less than 40% of patients receiving any blood products. Although transfusions may be necessary to maintain a hematocrit >20% during CPB,

a restrictive postoperative transfusion policy (transfusing for a Hb <7.5 g/dL) has evolved with the recognition that clinical outcomes are comparable to those seen with a more liberal strategy (transfusing for a Hb <9 g/dL).137–139

# **VII. Preoperative Medications**

- **A.** All **antianginal medications** should be continued up to and including the morning of surgery to prevent recurrence of ischemia. The substitution of a shorter‐acting β‐blocker or calcium channel blocker for a longer‐acting one (metoprolol tartrate for succinate [Toprol XL], diltiazem for Cardizem CD) should be considered. Whether preoperative β‐blockers lower the mortality rate of coronary bypass surgery remains controversial, since several studies have shown this to be of benefit only in patients with a recent MI.158–160 Nonetheless, this is an STS quality measure incorporated into public reporting.
- **B. Anti‐hypertensive medications** such as β‐blockers or calcium channel blockers can be given preoperatively to prevent rebound hypertension and provide for a more stable anesthetic course. However, whether angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) should be withheld the morning of surgery remains controversial. Their use is associated with reduced systemic resistance and a vasoplegic state during and after CPB, and studies have shown an association with higher mortality rates, an increasing need for inotropic support, and a higher risk of AF.161,162 However, effects on kidney function are controversial, with various studies showing either an increased and decreased risk of renal dysfunction when given up to the time of surgery.163,164
- **C.** Digoxin should be given the morning of surgery if used for rate control.
- **D.** Any medication that can affect renal function during surgery should be withheld. This includes thiazides and loop diuretics, such as furosemide.
- **E.** Anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents should be modified as follows (see section IV on pages 186–193 for more details):
  - **1.** Aspirin 81 mg should be continued up to the time of surgery in patients with coronary disease, but may be stopped 3–5 days prior to noncoronary surgery.
  - **2.** Clopidogrel and ticagrelor should be stopped five days prior to surgery and prasugrel should be stopped seven days prior to surgery. If the patient has received a bare‐metal stent within the past month or a drug‐eluting stent within the past 6–12 months, options include (a) continuing the medication, (b) stopping it for only three days before surgery, or (c) considering bridging with a IIb/IIIa inhibitor. The urgency of surgery to prevent an ischemic event always takes precedence over the time interval over which the medication has been stopped.
  - **3.** Warfarin should be stopped five days before surgery to allow for normalization of the INR. Bridging with LMWH should be considered in high risk outpatients (see page 190). If the INR remains elevated, 5 mg of oral vitamin K is effective in reducing the INR within 1–2 days. If more urgent reversal is necessary, 5 mg of IV vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma, or prothrombin complex concentrate (25–35 units/kg) may be used.
  - **4.** UFH is generally continued up to the time of surgery in patients with critical coronary disease, but when used as a bridge, it can be stopped about four hours before surgery.

- **5.** LMWH: the last dose should be given 24 hours preoperatively.
- **6.** NOACs: the last dose should be given 48 hours preoperatively or stopped even earlier if the patient has renal dysfunction. If the patient requires emergency surgery, expensive antidotes are available but may not be on formulary (idarucizumab for dabigatran, activated factor Xa ([andexanet alfa] for apixaban or rivaroxaban)
- **7.** Fondaparinux should be stopped at least 60–72 hours prior to surgery.
- **8.** Short‐acting IIb/IIIa inhibitors should be stopped four hours preoperatively.
- **9.** Surgery should be delayed 12–24 hours in patients receiving abciximab or thrombolytic therapy.
- **10.** If the patient requires truly urgent or emergency surgery, platelets and clotting factors must be available to combat the lingering antihemostatic effects of any of the above drugs.
- **F.** Diabetic patients should refrain from taking insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications after the preceding evening meal. The STS guidelines recommend that oral hypoglycemic medications should be withheld for 24 hours prior to surgery, which should allow for an early‐morning dose on the day prior to surgery.46 Blood glucose should be routinely checked in the operating room and treated with IV insulin to maintain the blood glucose <180 mg/dL.
- **G.** Antiarrhythmic therapy should be continued until the time of surgery. Long‐term use of **amiodarone** may be associated with postoperative respiratory failure, and it should be stopped as soon as surgery is being contemplated if there is evidence of any pulmonary complications. Otherwise, there is little benefit in stopping it for a short period of time to reduce perioperative risks because it has a very long half‐life. Amiodarone may be used for AF prophylaxis, either starting with a preoperative oral load over several days (10 mg/kg/day) or initiating it IV in the operating room (see pages 623–624).
- **H. Statins** should be given to all patients undergoing cardiac surgery, as they have been shown to reduce the risk of AF, delirium, and operative mortality.165–169 Although several studies have shown a reduced risk of acute kidney injury after surgery in patients on statins,168,169 one study of rosuvastatin showed that it increased that risk.170
- **I.** Stress dose steroids are indicated in patients on chronic steroid therapy, usually for COPD or autoimmune disorders. Administration of perioperative steroids in other patients has marginal benefit.171
- **J.** Preoperative prophylactic **antibiotics** must be administered before surgical incision. Vancomycin should be started within two hours of incision, and other antibiotics within one hour of incision.
  - **1.** A first‐generation cephalosporin, such as cefazolin, is commonly chosen because of its effectiveness against Gram‐positive organisms. There is some evidence that overall infection rates may be lower with use of a second‐generation cephalosporin, such as cefuroxime.
  - **2.** Vancomycin is used if there is a severe allergy to penicillin or the cephalosporins and is often selected in patients undergoing valvular surgery because of its excellent efficacy against Gram‐positive organisms. Since vancomycin provides poor Gram‐negative coverage, the STS guidelines suggest that the addition of an aminoglycoside be considered to improve prophylaxis, although that is not a common practice.172 Some centers will use both vancomycin and cefazolin or levofloxacin in penicillin‐allergic patients. Vancomycin should not

- be used indiscriminately, however, to minimize the emergence of strains of vancomycin‐resistant enterococci, a growing concern in intensive care units. If the patient is allergic to vancomycin and it is preferred not to use a cephalosporin, daptomycin is the next best alternative.
- **K.** Preoperative medications are ordered by the anesthesia service. Although some patients may benefit from receiving mild sedation "on‐call" to the operating room, most patients are given midazolam and/or fentanyl by the anesthesiologist once the initial IV lines are inserted. The surgical or anesthesia team is responsible for ordering the preoperative antibiotics.

# **VIII. Preoperative Orders and Checklist**

Once the patient has been accepted for surgery, orders should be placed to address general and patient specific concerns (tests, medications) before surgery. Standardized preprinted order sheets that are usually incorporated into computerized order sets are helpful and can be individualized as necessary (Table 3.6 and Appendix 2). The evening before surgery, the covering physician/physician assistant/nurse practitioner should write a brief preoperative note summarizing essential information that should be reviewed before proceeding with the operation. Writing this note prevents important details from being overlooked (Table 3.7 and Appendix 3). For patients undergoing elective surgery, the surgical team must take the responsibility of confirming that all of the requisite information has been reviewed, abnormalities addressed, and the information placed in the patient's office chart the night before admission to be available to the operating room when the patient arrives in the morning. The following should be noted:

- **A.** The planned operative procedure
- **B.** Indication for surgery
- **C.** Brief summary of the cardiac catheterization data
- **D.** Results of the laboratory data obtained
- **E.** Surgical note and **consent** in chart
- **F.** Anesthesia note and consent in chart
- **G.** STS risk score (or EuroSCORE)
- **H.** Confirmation of blood bank cross‐match and blood setup
  - **1.** Guidelines for blood setup are shown in Table 3.8. One can generally determine the potential need for transfusion based on the patient's blood volume (which correlates with body size and usually with gender), and the preoperative hemoglobin level. More blood transfusions are commonly required during complex procedures requiring long durations of CPB, during which a large amount of crystalloid is usually given. Blood transfusions are indicated to maintain a satisfactory hematocrit (>18–20%) on pump.
  - **2.** Other comorbid factors that increase the need for transfusion include older age, urgent or emergent operations, poor ventricular function, reoperations, an elevated INR or use of preoperative antiplatelet drugs, insulin‐dependent diabetes, PVD, chronic kidney disease, and an albumin <4 g/dL, consistent with poor nutrition.173,174

- **I.** Preoperative orders are written (in some hospitals, the anesthesia team is responsible for this):
  - **1.** Antibiotics: (always check for allergy)
    - **a.** Cefazolin 1–2 g IV to be given in the operating room within one hour of incision. The dose should be weight‐based. The STS recommendation is to give 1 g to patients <60 kg and 2 g for patients >60 kg.172 Most groups routinely give 2 g to patients <120 kg and 3 g if >120 kg. An IV bolus injection achieves a peak plasma concentration within 20 minutes and peak interstitial levels within 60 minutes, so ideally, it should be given 20–30 minutes before surgery starts. Because the half‐life of cefazolin is 1.8 hours and serum levels fall up to 50% on pump, an additional 1 g should be given on pump or every 3–4 hours during surgery.

- **b.** Vancomycin 20 mg/kg to be started within two hours of surgery but infused over at least 30 minutes to avoid hypotension and the "red‐neck syndrome".172
  - **i.** It usually does not need to be redosed on pump.
  - **ii.** The STS guidelines recommend a dose of 15 mg/kg, but most groups use a weight‐based strategy of 20 mg/kg.175 This produces more satisfactory vancomycin levels. A simple method that approximates precise weight‐based dosing is to use 1 g for patients <80 kg, 1.5 g if 80–120 kg, and 2 g if >120 kg.
  - **iii.** The STS guidelines provide a level IIb indication to also administer an aminoglycoside, such as gentamicin 4 mg/kg, to provide gram‐negative coverage.172
- **2.** Specific orders to stop medications listed in section VII, pages 198–199.
- **3.** Antiseptic scrub (chlorhexidine) with which to shower the night before and the morning of surgery. Preferably, this should be applied several times rather than during a single shower.176
- **4.** Mupirocin 2% (Bactroban) nasal ointment is effective in reducing nasal carriage of *S. aureus* and can reduce the incidence of surgical‐site infections with these organisms. In patients who are not nasal carriers, mupirocin has no benefit and may potentially increase the risk of infection from antibiotic‐resistant organisms.177–180 If polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is available, mupirocin administration can be limited to patients who test positive for MRSA carriage. Otherwise, a routine policy of pre‐, intra‐, and a few days of postoperative nasal mupirocin can be recommended (one swab bid × three days).
- **5.** Chlorhexidine 0.12% (Peridex) mouthwash
- **6.** Skin preparation. This is best performed the morning of surgery, as it has been well documented that the closer the prep to the time of surgery, the lower the wound infection rate. Use of clippers is preferable to shaving with a razor, which increases the risk of infection.181
- **7.** NPO after midnight
- **8.** Preoperative medications per anesthesia service
- **J.** For outpatients, it is important that documentation of a very brief updated history and physical exam be written in the medical record the day of surgery, indicating whether there has been any change since the patient's preoperative evaluation.

# **IX. Risk Assessment and Informed Consent**

#### **A. General comments**

**1.** An important element of the preoperative preparation for cardiac surgery is an assessment of the patient's surgical risk. Risk stratification can afford patients and their families insight into the **real** risk of complications and mortality. It can also increase the awareness of the healthcare team to the high‐risk patient for whom more aggressive therapy in the perioperative period may be beneficial. Documentation in the chart of an informed‐consent discussion is **mandatory** prior to any cardiac surgical procedure. This note should quantify the predicted risk of operative mortality (PROM), preferably using the STS risk calculator (www.STS.org) or the EuroSCORE (www.euroscore.pil‐media.com), should list some of the more common complications of the operation being performed, and should address risks that may be unique to the individual patient.

- **2.** Although public reporting of hospitals' and individual surgeons' mortality rates is becoming more commonplace, the correlation of mortality with quality of care is imprecise. Mortality is more commonly related to the underlying cardiac disease and comorbidities and perhaps, most importantly, to patient selection. Nonetheless, the incidence of postoperative complications remains quite substantial, especially in older patient populations, and many of these complications are simply not preventable. Although the ability to predict and hopefully prevent postoperative complications may have some influence on overall mortality rates, it usually has more of an impact of the rapidity of the patient's recovery back to a satisfactory quality of life.
- **B. Risk stratification** is based on an assessment of four important interrelated categories of risk factors, many of which are included in the STS and EuroSCORE risk models.
  - **1. Patient demographics.** These include patient‐related factors independent of disease, such as age, gender, and race.
  - **2. Patient‐related comorbidities.** These refer to coexisting diseases that are not necessarily directly related to the cardiac disease, but can have significant impact on the patient's ability to recover from surgery. In fact, in most patients, mortality and morbidity are related to preexisting issues, such as diabetes, renal dysfunction, cerebrovascular disease, and COPD. These render the patient more susceptible to the insults of CPB or to complications from a low cardiac output state. Abnormal lab tests (e.g. anemia, leukocytosis, elevated creatinine or blood sugar) that are linked to increased mortality are usually associated with patient comorbidities.
  - **3. Cardiac and procedure‐related factors.** The clinical presentation (stable ischemic heart disease vs. acute coronary syndrome, recent MI, HF), nature and extent of cardiac disease (isolated CAD, associated valve disease, pulmonary hypertension), and the degree of ventricular dysfunction are important considerations in determining operative risk. Abnormal lab tests that reflect these conditions (elevated BNP, CRP, or troponin levels) are all associated with increased operative mortality.13,152,182 For the vast majority of patients at low to moderate risk, these clinical factors generally do not raise the operative risk significantly. The extent of the planned operation raises the baseline risk, and reoperations nearly always double or triple the operative risk. Uncommon surgical situations, such as a very recent MI (within 24 hours), profound LV dysfunction (EF <20%), or cardiogenic shock with or without mechanical complications of infarction (ventricular septal rupture or papillary muscle rupture) are powerful risk factors for mortality. Postcardiotomy ventricular dysfunction can exacerbate organ system dysfunction related to preexisting comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, and may contribute to operative mortality.
  - **4. Preoperative status.** The immediate risk of death is greatest in patients requiring emergency surgery. Such patients usually have a "critical preoperative state" with unstable cardiac disease, which may include ongoing ischemia, hemodynamic compromise (such as cardiogenic shock) that requires inotropes or IABP support, or even ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

# **C. Preoperative predictors of operative mortality**

**1.** Several risk models are available to determine a patient's operative risk. The STS risk model has been continuously upgraded with the incorporation of more data entry points and is available online at www.sts.org under the "resources" and "risk calculator" links.183,184 This model provides not just an estimated mortality but a delineation of the risk of re‐exploration for bleeding, renal failure, wound infection, respiratory failure, and a length of stay (LOS) analysis. With appropriate data entry for each patient and quarterly submissions of data to the STS database, each cardiac surgical program is provided with risk‐adjusted results and a comparison with STS benchmarks. The STS risk calculator has improved to include more lab tests and clinical conditions, but it is not inclusive of all factors that can influence operative risk. The STS risk model and the ASCERT long‐term survival probability calculator (both available at www.sts.org) provide comparable information on long‐term survival out to seven years.185,186

- **2.** Another risk model is the EuroSCORE (see www.euroscore.pil‐media.com). The initial additive EuroSCORE model tended to overestimate mortality in low‐risk patients and underestimate it in high‐risk patients compared with other risk models. A more sophisticated logistic EuroSCORE using a computerized model was then designed that appeared to be more accurate in predicting mortality in high‐risk patients. These scoring systems were updated in 2011 to the EuroSCORE II model, which added such fields as LFTs and creatinine clearance and adjusted the weight of some variables. This system was also more applicable to types of surgery not included in the STS risk model.
- **3.** Comparative studies suggest that the STS score and the EuroSCORE II score are comparable in predicting risk and are better than the original EuroSCORE system. However, based on the type of surgery being assessed, the STS model was felt to be most useful for patients having AVR or CABG–valve surgery, whereas the EuroSCORE II was more accurate for isolated CABGs and mitral valve surgery and was also more accurate in patients at high risk.187
- **4.** Clinical conditions that are considered the most important risk factors for operative mortality include, in approximate decreasing order of significance:
  - **a.** Emergency surgery, which includes some of the powerful but fairly uncommon risk factors (cardiogenic shock, ongoing CPR)
  - **b.** Renal dysfunction
  - **c.** Reoperations
  - **d.** Older age (>75–80)
  - **e.** Poor ventricular function (EF <30%)
  - **f.** Female gender
  - **g.** Left main disease
  - **h.** Other comorbidities, such as COPD, PVD, diabetes, and cerebrovascular disease
- **D.** Preoperative predictors of operative morbidity and their management
  - **1.** Although the risk factors for morbidity and mortality may differ slightly, complications are more common when any of the problems just listed are present.188 Although most factors are not modifiable, such as patient age, gender, redo status, urgency status, or the extent of cardiac disease, they do heighten awareness of the increased risk for postoperative complications. Recognizing preexisting organ system dysfunction or risk factors for their development is essential to reduce

- postoperative morbidity and mortality. This is especially important in elderly patients, who are more predisposed to renal dysfunction, ventilatory issues, stroke, bleeding, and atrial arrhythmias. The risk ratios and mortality rates for some of the most significant postoperative complications are noted in Table 3.9. Although these data are somewhat dated, and hopefully results have improved since that time, they do delineate the importance of trying to avoid complications at all costs to optimize surgical outcomes. Concern about the following complications should prompt specific measures to prevent their occurrence or minimize their impact if they occur.
- **2. Renal failure** that requires dialysis carries a mortality rate of nearly 50%. There are several models to predict the risks of postoperative acute kidney injury and the need for dialysis (see Figures 12.1–12.4, pages 684–686).189,190 Optimizing renal function before, during, and after surgery is critical in patients with preexisting renal dysfunction. Even if dialysis is not required, chronic kidney disease is associated with increased operative mortality and reduced long‐term survival (see Chapter 12).

- **3. Prolonged ventilation.** The STS database definition considers postoperative mechanical ventilation for over 24 hours, measured from the time the patient exits the operating room, to represent a postoperative complication. The operative mortality for patients requiring intubation for over five days is approximately 20%. Several risk models have been evaluated to predict the risk of postoperative prolonged ventilation (see Figure 10.2, page 471).21,191 In patients with compromised pulmonary function, aggressive preoperative treatment of remediable conditions is essential. This may involve use of antibiotics for pulmonary infiltrates or bronchitis (and delay of surgery), bronchodilators for bronchospasm, diuresis for congestive HF, or even mechanical ventilation for hypoxemia or hypercarbia. Intraoperative management should entail judicious fluid administration, steps to reduce pulmonary artery pressures, steroids and bronchodilators for bronchospasm, and inotropic support if indicated. Postoperatively, aggressive diuresis as tolerated by hemodynamic performance, bronchodilators, early mobilization, and incentive spirometry are a few of the routine measures that can be utilized to minimize pulmonary morbidity (see Chapter 10).
- **4.** Preexisting **cerebrovascular disease**, whether symptomatic or not, increases the risk of stroke. Oftentimes, it is a marker for severe atherosclerosis, and most strokes are related to aortic manipulation rather than to preexisting carotid disease. Although the overall risk of permanent stroke is only 1–2%, this incidence is higher in elderly patients. Development of a permanent perioperative stroke carries about a 25% mortality rate. Identifying carotid disease in patients at higher risk, using epiaortic imaging in the operating room to identify ascending aortic or arch atherosclerosis, using cerebral oximetry, maintaining a higher blood pressure on pump, or performing off‐pump surgery are a few examples of measures that should be considered in elderly patients to reduce the risk of stroke and neurocognitive dysfunction.
- **5. Mediastinal bleeding** remains a concern after all cardiac operations, whether performed on‐ or off‐pump. It may result from surgical bleeding sites, a coagulopathy, or a combination of both. A higher prevalence is noted following more complex operations, especially valve surgery. Meticulous attention to hemostasis remains imperative, especially in elderly patients with poor tissue quality. Bleeding may produce hemodynamic compromise from a low output state or tamponade, and also increases the requirement for blood and blood component transfusions, which independently increase the risk of infection, respiratory failure, renal dysfunction, and mortality. Reoperation for bleeding and the development of tamponade carry significant mortality rates (about 13% and 25%, respectively).192 Particular attention to modifying preoperative antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulants, use of antifibrinolytic drugs, and vigilance and patience in the operating room should minimize the risk of bleeding and its adverse consequences.
- **6. Anticoagulation‐related hemorrhage**, specifically delayed tamponade, is a potential complication of postoperative anticoagulation. Aspirin is routinely started within the first 24 hours after surgery once postoperative bleeding has tapered to a minimal level. Some surgeons use clopidogrel postoperatively, especially after OPCABs or CABG for non‐STEMIs. Heparin may be given to patients with AF, for mechanical valve prostheses until warfarin has achieved a therapeutic INR, or for VTE prophylaxis. The risk of delayed bleeding is heightened

- in patients receiving multiple antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs, which may be indicated for several concurrent issues. One must always weigh the risks and benefits of early anticoagulation and maintain constant vigilance for the early clinical signs of delayed tamponade. This is an easily correctable problem if identified. If not, it can be lethal.
- **7. Deep sternal wound infections** (DSWIs) occur in less than 1% of patients, but they can be difficult to treat. They occasionally occur in critically ill patients in the ICU and thus are associated with a significant mortality rate (about 10–20%). Treating infections noted preoperatively, using perioperative mupirocin in nasal carriers of *S. aureus*, administering prophylactic antibiotics appropriately in the operating room and continuing for no more than 48 hours, proper invasive line care, and strict control of intraoperative and postoperative hyperglycemia with an insulin protocol are essential in minimizing this problem. Unfortunately, it is highly unlikely that DSWIs can be entirely eliminated, no matter how ideal the care the patient receives.
