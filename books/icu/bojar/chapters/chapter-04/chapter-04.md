## **4** Cardiac Anesthesia

Although excellence in pre‐ and postoperative care can often make the difference between an uneventful and a complicated recovery, the care provided in the operating room (OR) usually has the most significant impact on patient outcome. Performing a technically proficient, complete, and expeditious operation is only one component of this phase. Refinements in anesthetic techniques and monitoring, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), and myocardial protection have enabled surgeons to operate successfully on extremely ill patients with far advanced cardiac disease and multiple comorbidities. Use of off‐pump modalities to avoid CPB is particularly useful in patients at high risk because of associated comorbidities. Minimally invasive surgery and percutaneous approaches to address valve pathology may lessen the trauma of a procedure and expedite recovery. This chapter describes intraoperative monitoring, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), concepts of anesthetic management unique to different types of cardiac surgical procedures, and various considerations in the management of patients undergoing procedures in the OR, hybrid OR, or hybrid cath lab with or without use of CPB.

## **I. Preoperative Visit**

- **A.** A preoperative visit by the cardiac anesthesiologist is essential before all operations. This provides an opportunity to review the patient's history, perform a relevant examination, and explain the techniques of monitoring and postoperative ventilatory support. This evaluation should identify any potential problems that might require further work‐up or could influence intraoperative management.
  - **1.** History: cardiac symptoms, significant comorbidities, previous anesthetic experiences, surgical procedures, allergies, medications, and recent use of steroids.
  - **2.** Examination: heart, lungs, loose teeth, intubation concerns based on oral anatomy (the Mallampati score), the thyromental distance, which is measured from the thyroid notch to the jaw with the head extended, >7 cm suggesting possible difficult intubation, range of motion of the neck, and jaw laxity.
- **B.** The anesthesiologist should confirm with the patient the surgeon's instructions on which medications to continue up to the time of surgery, which ones to stop, and which ones to take in modified doses. Specifically, they should tell the patient to:
  - **1.** Continue all antihypertensive and antianginal medications up to and including the morning of surgery. Exceptions may include angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which arguably should be withheld the morning of surgery to reduce the risk of low systemic resistance in the perioperative period.1–4

- **2.** Withhold long‐acting insulin the night before and not take any insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications the morning of the surgery. Blood glucose should be obtained on arrival in the OR and checked frequently during surgery with coverage provided by intravenous (IV) insulin.
- **3.** Follow the surgeon's recommendations for cessation of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents.5,6
  - **a.** Warfarin should be stopped at least four days preoperatively so that the INR will normalize before surgery. The INR can be reversed for more urgent surgery with vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma, or prothrombin complex concentrate (Kcentra).7
  - **b.** Aspirin can be stopped 3–5 days before valvular surgery in patients without coronary disease. However, aspirin 81 mg daily should be continued in most coronary patients and should have little impact on perioperative bleeding. The benefits of its preoperative use on improving graft patency remain controversial.8–11
  - **c.** The P2Y12 inhibitors should be stopped five days (clopidogrel and ticagrelor) and seven days (prasugrel) before elective surgery. If surgery is indicated within 6–12 months after a drug‐eluting stent (DES) has been placed, stopping these medications prior to surgery may increase the risk of stent thrombosis. Therefore, in this situation, as well as when the patient needs urgent surgery after DES placement, the surgeon may adopt a bridging plan, such as stopping the P2Y12 for a few days and then initiating a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor for a few days, which is then stopped four hours prior to surgery.12,13
  - **d.** Unfractionated heparin (UFH) may be continued into the OR for patients with critical coronary disease, but otherwise it can be stopped about four hours before surgery.
  - **e.** Dissipation of the full effect of other anticoagulants takes 4–5 half‐lives. Therefore, low‐molecular‐weight heparin (LMWH), which has a half-life of 4–5 hours, should be held for 24 hours. The non‐vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), including dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban have half‐lives of about 12 hours in older patients with normal renal function, so the last dose should be given 48 hours prior to surgery.6
- **C.** Informed consent should be obtained for anesthesia management, including the insertion of monitoring lines, with a discussion of potential complications.

## **II. Preoperative Medications**

These are usually not given before the patient is brought into the holding area or the OR for line insertion. Once the initial IV lines are inserted, low doses of midazolam (1–5 mg IV) with fentanyl (0.2–2 μg/kg or about 50–200 μg) can be given to reduce the patient's anxiety and produce amnesia and allow for the safe insertion of additional monitoring lines without producing hemodynamic stress. Prophylactic antibiotics should be given within one hour of skin incision (starting two hours beforehand for vancomycin).14

## **III. Intraoperative Monitoring and Transesophageal Echocardiography**

**A.** Patients undergoing cardiac surgical procedures are extensively monitored. Hemodynamic alterations and myocardial ischemia that occur during the induction of anesthesia, in the prebypass period, during CPB, and following resumption of cardiac activity can have significant adverse effects on myocardial function and recovery. It should be noted that, even though both hypertension and tachycardia can

- increase myocardial oxygen demand, an increase in heart rate results in more myocardial ischemia at an equivalent increase in oxygen demand.15
- **B.** Standard monitoring in the OR consists of a five‐lead ECG system, a radial (and occasionally femoral) arterial line, noninvasive blood pressure cuff, pressure monitoring from a central venous pressure (CVP) line or Swan‐Ganz pulmonary artery (PA) catheter, pulse oximetry, and an end‐tidal CO2 measurement (Figure 4.1). In addition, cerebral oximetry, core body temperature (usually from a "temp probe" Foley catheter) and urine output through the Foley catheter are monitored.
  - **1.** For uncomplicated coronary artery bypass surgery in patients with normal or mildly depressed ventricular function, the use of a CVP monitoring line instead of a PA catheter can provide an adequate assessment of filling pressures.16
  - **2.** Specially designed Swan‐Ganz catheters can be used to obtain continuous cardiac outputs and mixed venous oxygen saturations.
  - **3.** TEE is routine and is cost‐effective in providing useful information that may alter the operative approach.17–19 There should be provisions available to perform epiaortic scanning to assess for ascending aortic atherosclerosis, which may also influence the conduct of the operation.20,21

**Figure 4.1 •** Display monitor in the OR. From top to bottom are displays of two ECG leads, the arterial pressure, pulmonary artery and central venous pressures from the Swan‐Ganz catheter, a third pressure tracing (initially the retrograde cardioplegia pressure and later a second arterial tracing, usually from the femoral artery), and pulse oximetry. The right side displays the digital values of the heart rate and pressures (phasic and mean pressures), three temperature readings, reflecting the myocardial, systemic (Tblood from the pulmonary artery), and core (Tvesic) temperatures and cardiac output and index values. At the bottom are the doses of inhalational gases being administered, the inspired (FiO2) and end‐tidal O2 saturations, and the arterial oxygen saturation.

- **C. Swan‐Ganz pulmonary artery catheters** are usually placed after induction and intubation to minimize patient discomfort. However, they may be placed before the induction of anesthesia in patients with severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Flow‐directed catheters are used to measure right‐ (CVP) and left‐sided filling pressures (pulmonary artery diastolic [PAD] and pulmonary capillary wedge [PCW] pressures), and obtain thermodilution cardiac outputs. Despite the nearly universal use of these catheters to carefully monitor patients and provide objective data on cardiac performance in the pre‐ and postbypass periods, it has not been demonstrated that they influence the outcome of cardiac surgery.
  - **1.** The catheter is usually inserted through an 8.5 Fr introducer placed into the internal jugular (IJ) vein or, less commonly, the subclavian vein. Ultrasound‐guided access, using an echo probe on the neck to identify the IJ vein, is very helpful in facilitating line placement (Figure 4.2). The introducer sheath contains one side port that provides central venous access for the infusion of vasoactive medications and potassium. Multilumen introducers, such as the 8.5 Fr and 9 Fr high‐flow advanced venous access (AVA) device (Edwards Lifesciences) or the Teleflex

**Figure 4.2 •** (A) An echo probe is used to identify the location of the internal jugular (IJ) vein and its relationship to the carotid artery. (B) Using the echo probe, a small caliber finder needle is used to locate the IJ vein. (C) A larger needle then accesses the vein through which a wire and a dilator are placed into the IJ vein. (D) The introducer sheath is then advanced over the wire into the IJ through which the Swan‐Ganz catheter is then placed.

**Figure 4.3 •** Swan‐Ganz catheter pressures. Intracardiac pressures are recorded from the distal (PA) port as the catheter is passed through the right atrium (RA), right ventricle (RV), and pulmonary artery (PA), into the pulmonary capillary wedge (PCW) position.

multilumen access catheter (MAC) with a 12‐gauge proximal lumen and a 9 Fr distal lumen, can provide additional venous access in patients with poor arm veins and limited peripheral access. A manifold with multiple stopcocks is attached to the side port of the introducer or to one of the additional ports of the AVA/MAC through which all medications are administered.

- **2.** The catheter is passed into the right atrium, and the balloon at the catheter tip is inflated. The catheter is advanced through the right ventricle (RV) and PA into the PCW position, as confirmed by pressure tracings (Figure 4.3). The PA tracing should reappear when the balloon is deflated. **Note:** caution is essential in passing the catheter through the RV in patients with a left bundle branch block (LBBB), in whom complete heart block might occur. In this situation, unless provisions for urgent pacing are available, such as external pacing/defibrillator pads, it is best to wait until the chest is open before advancing the catheter, so that the surgeon can directly pace the heart if necessary.22
- **3.** The proximal port of the Swan‐Ganz catheter (30 cm from the tip) is used for CVP measurements from the right atrium and for fluid injections to determine the cardiac output. Care must be exercised when injecting sterile fluid for cardiac outputs to prevent bolusing of vasoactive medications that might be running through the CVP port. **Note:** one must **never** infuse anything through this port if the catheter has been pulled back so that the tip lies in the right atrium and the CVP port lies outside the patient! This might not be noticed, because the catheter is usually placed through a sterile sheath that allows for advancement or withdrawal of the catheter. This concept must always be kept in mind when critical medications, such as heparin prior to cannulation, are being administered.
- **4.** The distal port should always be transduced and displayed on a monitor to allow for the detection of catheter advancement into the permanent wedge position, which could result in PA injury. Balloon inflation ("wedging" of the catheter) is rarely necessary during surgery. Medication should never be given through the distal PA port.
- **5.** A variety of advanced technology Swan‐Ganz catheters are available that provide additional functions.

- **a.** Swan‐Ganz Paceport catheters have additional ports for the placement of right atrial and ventricular pacing probes, which is helpful during minimally invasive surgery when access to the heart is limited.
- **b.** Catheters have been designed for assessment of continuous cardiac outputs (CCO) or mixed venous oxygen saturations (SvO2 ) by fiberoptic oximetry (Figure 4.4). These are helpful during off‐pump surgery to evaluate the patient's hemodynamic status and may contribute to a therapeutic maneuver in many patients. The Vigileo/FloTrac (Edwards Lifesciences) cardiac output monitoring system is also useful during off‐pump surgery,23,24 and may be considered when there is difficulty placing a Swan‐Ganz catheter or when thermodilution cardiac outputs are unreliable (moderate–severe tricuspid regurgitation).25
- **c.** Swan‐Ganz catheters for CCO and SvO2 monitoring may also include the technology to provide measurements of RV ejection fraction and RV end‐ diastolic volume. They are particularly valuable in patients with pulmonary hypertension and compromised RV function.26
- **6.** The primary concerns during the insertion of a PA catheter are arterial puncture, arrhythmias during passage through the RV, and potential heart block in patients with preexisting LBBB. Other complications of Swan‐Ganz catheters are noted on pages 354–355.
- **7. Pulmonary artery perforation** is a very serious complication.27–29 It may occur during insertion of the catheter or during the surgical procedure when hypothermia causes the catheter to become rigid. Since a cold, stiff catheter may advance into the lung when the heart is manipulated, it is advisable to pull it back slightly during CPB to prevent perforation and then to re‐advance it after CPB. Migration of the catheter into the wedge position may be evident by a loss of pulse pressure in the PA waveform before or after bypass or by a very high PA pressure measurement on bypass when the heart is decompressed.
  - **a.** If perforation occurs, blood will appear in the endotracheal tube. The goals of management are to maintain gas exchange and arrest the hemorrhage. Positive end‐expiratory pressure (PEEP) should be applied to the ventilator circuit. If the degree of hemoptysis is not severe, it may abate once CPB is terminated and protamine is administered.

**Figure 4.4 •** Continuous cardiac output monitor display.

- **b.** If the airway is compromised by bleeding, CPB should be resumed with venting of the PA. Bronchoscopy is then performed with placement of a bronchial blocker or a double‐lumen endotracheal tube to provide differential lung ventilation. The pleural space should be entered to evaluate the problem. If significant bleeding does not abate after application of PEEP or occlusion of the hilar vessels, pulmonary resection may be required. Use of femoral artery– femoral venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been described to control bleeding by lowering the PA pressures, but it is risky because it requires persistent heparinization.30 Because of the risk of recurrence, pulmonary angiography and embolization may be considered once the bleeding is controlled.
- **D. Intraoperative TEE** has become routine in most cardiac surgical centers, being beneficial in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) operations and essential during valvular surgery.17–19,31 The probe is placed after the patient is anesthetized and before heparinization. TEE provides an analysis of regional and global RV and LV function, is very sensitive in detecting ischemia,32 and identifies the presence of valvular pathology or intracardiac masses (Table 4.1 and see Figures 2.21–2.28, pages 148–153). Color flow, continuous wave, and pulsed wave Doppler are used to analyze valvular function or suspected shunts. Although TEE may image the aorta for atheromatous disease, epiaortic imaging provides better visualization of the ascending aorta and arch when there are significant concerns about atheromatous disease.20,21 Having an individual trained in performing and reading TEEs, be they a cardiac anesthesiologist or a cardiologist, is essential to optimize its usefulness.

- **1.** Before the probe is placed, consideration must be given to contraindications to TEE placement that could produce catastrophic complications, such as hypopharyngeal, or proximal or distal esophageal perforation or bleeding, which are noted in less than 0.1% of patients.33–36 TEE must be used cautiously or avoided in patients with prior esophageal surgery or with known esophageal pathology, such as strictures, Schatzki's ring, or esophageal varices.
- **2.** TEE allows for advancement/withdrawal, rotation, and "multiplaning" of the probe through 180 degrees, thus affording excellent images of the heart in multiple views. The probe is advanced up and down the esophagus and then into the stomach for transgastric views. The American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) and the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists defined 20 standard views for a routine examination in their report from 199937 and expanded the recommendations to 28 standard views in their 2013 update.31 These include 15 mid‐esophageal (ME) views, nine transgastric (TG) views, and four aortic views, which can be obtained in a sequential fashion. These images provide multiple long‐axis (LAX) and short‐axis (SAX) views of all four cardiac valves, the four cardiac chambers, and the great vessels. The 2013 update can be accessed online at www.onlinejase.org and provides links to videos of each of the views. The most important views during cardiac surgery (Figures 4.5–4.7) include the following:
  - **a.** Multiplaning of the probe in the mid‐esophagus allows for acquisition of four‐ and five‐chamber views (0–10°), the mitral commissural view (50–70°), and the two‐chamber view (80–100°) (Figure 4.5). These views are helpful in assessing which mitral valve scallops are involved in patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation (MR). The bicaval view (Figure 4.5E) and SAX view at the base of the aortic valve are used to optimize the site for transseptal puncture during percutaneous mitral valve procedures. The ME SAX view (Figure 4.6A) is used to visualize the three aortic valve leaflets, and the ME LAX LVOT view (Figure 4.6B) is an excellent image for evaluation of aortic and mitral valve pathology, LV function, intracardiac air when weaning from CPB, and for positioning of MitraClip devices.
  - **b.** With the probe anteflexed in the TG position (Figure 4.7), the most helpful views include the following:
    - **i.** The LV SAX views (0–20°) extending from the apex toward the base to assess global and regional LV function and LV wall thickness.
    - **ii.** The TG two‐chamber view (90–110°) to identify the mitral valve, submitral apparatus, and the anterior and inferior walls of the LV.

**Figure 4.5 •** Best TEE views for mitral valve procedures. For mitral valve repairs, the probe is rotated in the mid‐esophagus (ME) to identify which scallops are involved. These views include the (A) five‐chamber, (B) four‐chamber, (C) mitral commissural, and (D) two‐chamber views. The ME LAX view (Figure 4.6B) shows A2‐P2 as well as the LVOT and aortic valve. The best TEE views for a MitraClip include (E) the bicaval view and the SAX at the base view for transseptal puncture, the mitral commissural view to determine lateral–medial orientation of the clip and the ME LAX (LVOT) view for proper anterior–posterior orientation of the clip.

**Figure 4.6 •** Best TEE views of the aortic valve are the (A) ME aortic valve SAX and (B) ME aortic valve LAX views. These views are also useful during MitraClip procedures, with the ME SAX at the base view used to determine the anterior–posterior location for transseptal puncture, and the ME LAX or LVOT view used to determine positioning of the clip below the anterior and posterior mitral valve leaflets. The ME LAX view is most helpful in assessing mitral valve function, LV function, and detecting air when weaning from bypass after both aortic and mitral valve surgery.

- **iii.** The TG RV two‐chamber (inflow) view (with clockwise rotation of the probe at 90–110°) to show the tricuspid valve and right heart chambers.
- **iv.** The TG LAX view (120–140°) to measure aortic valve gradients.
- **v.** The deep TG five‐chamber view to assess LV function, but primarily to measure the aortic valve gradient.
- **c.** Imaging of the aorta is usually performed after obtaining the TG views and is obtained in both SAX and LAX views as the probe is pulled back into the esophagus. This allows for imaging of the ascending and descending aorta and the aortic arch.

**Figure 4.7 •** Transgastric (TG) views. With the probe anteflexed in the TG position, the most helpful views are the (A) SAX views of the LV extending upwards from the apex to assess LV function, (B) the longitudinal TG two‐chamber LV view to image the mitral valve apparatus and anterior and inferior wall function, and (C) the TG two‐chamber RV (inflow) view to assess tricuspid valve pathology.

- **3.** During **on‐pump coronary artery surgery**, a prebypass TEE will provide a baseline analysis of regional and global ventricular function. The TG mid‐papillary SAX view and most ME LAX views of the LV can be used to assess regional wall motion (RWM). The ability of the heart muscle to thicken is consistent with viability, whereas areas of thinned‐out muscle represent infarcted areas. Following bypass, slight improvement in previously ischemic zones may be noted, especially with inotropic stimulation. Areas of hypokinesis may represent stunned or hibernating myocardium that have contractile reserve and may gradually recover function after revascularization. The new onset of hypokinesis raises the specter of hypoperfusion from an anastomotic or graft problem, incomplete revascularization, or inadequate myocardial protection. The new onset of MR may reflect loading conditions but is also consistent with ischemic dysfunction.
- **4.** During **off‐pump surgery**, the ME windows are best for assessing RV and LV function and the presence of MR. Baseline views are obtained. During vessel occlusion, TEE should assess for the acute development of regional LV dysfunction or acute MR during construction of left‐sided grafts and for RV dysfunction during right coronary grafting. The TG views are not helpful when the heart is elevated out of the chest.38,39 The development and persistence of a new RWM abnormality after a graft anastomosis is completed suggest a flow problem, usually at the anastomosis. However, the latter may be present even in the absence of a RWM abnormality.
- **5.** In **minimally invasive** access procedures (usually aortic or mitral valve surgery), TEE can confirm the location of the retrograde coronary sinus catheter since it cannot be palpated by the surgeon. It can also visualize the intracardiac location of a femoral venous catheter and identify the location of an aortic endoballoon. Upon weaning from bypass, TEE is essential to identify intracardiac air and assess valve competence.
- **6. Aortic valve surgery.** The best TEE views of the aortic valve are obtained in the ME SAX and LAX views, with use of the TG views to obtain aortic valve gradients. These images are important for the surgeon to:
  - **a.** Quantify the degree of aortic stenosis (AS) by planimetry and by continuous wave and pulsed wave Doppler flow analysis. This provides peak and mean transvalvular pressure gradients and calculates the aortic area using the continuity equation.
  - **b.** Quantify the degree of aortic regurgitation (AR) using color flow and continuous wave Doppler analysis. If moderate to severe, this will render delivery of antegrade cardioplegia into the aortic root ineffective.
  - **c.** Assess the degree of LV hypertrophy and its nature (concentric, septal).
  - **d.** Assess annular and aortic root size and identify an annular abscess in patients with endocarditis.
  - **e.** Identify the presence of systolic and/or diastolic dysfunction (by looking at transmitral flow), which may influence filling pressures and pharmacologic management coming off‐pump.

- **f.** After bypass, intracardiac air is best assessed in the ME LAX view, and ventricular function is best determined in the ME LAX, TG LAX, and SAX views. Imaging to assess opening and closing of valve leaflets, identify transvalvular and paravalvular leaks, and calculate aortic valve gradients is then performed. Transvalvular regurgitation should be minor and located centrally after a bioprosthetic AVR, but may be eccentric if a leaflet has been distorted by the aortic closure sutures. Multiple trace jets are anticipated after St. Jude (Abbott) bileaflet valve replacements. Paravalvular leaks may need to be reevaluated by direct visualization. Competence of homografts, autografts (Ross procedure), and the native aortic valve in a valve‐sparing root procedure should be confirmed. Rarely, an unusual finding may be demonstrated, such as a ventricular septal defect or an aorto‐left atrial fistula. Flow into the left main coronary artery can be visualized in the ME SAX view.
- **g.** Following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), TEE is used if the procedure is performed under general anesthesia. If the procedure is performed under sedation, transthoracic imaging is adequate to identify paravalvular leaks in the parasternal LAX and SAX views, and to calculate a transvalvular gradient in the apical four‐chamber view.
- **7. Mitral valve surgery.** TEE is essential to identify the anatomic abnormality responsible for the MR, quantitate its severity, and evaluate the surgical result. The best visualization of the mitral valve is from the mid‐lower esophagus and includes the ME two‐ and four‐chamber views, the ME mitral commissural view, and the ME LAX views. These, along with the three‐ dimensional (3D) en face views, allow for the visualization of all of the mitral valve scallops to help identify the precise location of the pathology causing the MR.40
  - **a.** Prebypass assessment should confirm the valvular pathology and identify the mechanism of MR. For example, degenerative MR with a flail leaflet will produce an eccentric jet, whereas functional MR with depressed LV function may produce a central jet from remodeling with papillary muscle displacement or an eccentric jet from leaflet tethering (see Figures 2.22–2.24, pages 148–150). Rotation of the probe to sequentially provide the four‐chamber, mitral commissural, and two‐chamber views should allow for localization of the prolapsed scallop.41 In some patients with MR, it is not uncommon to note a discrepancy in the degree of MR between preoperative echoes and intraoperative TEE due to alteration in loading conditions. The left atrial appendage should be evaluated for the presence of thrombus.
  - **b.** In anticipation of a mitral valve repair, markers for systolic anterior motion should be analyzed. These include an end‐diastolic diameter (EDD) <45 mm. aorto‐mitral angle <120°, coaptation–septum distance <25 mm, posterior leaflet height >15 mm, and basal septal diameter ≥15 mm.42
  - **c.** Assessment of RV function is also important during mitral valve surgery. Markers of RV dysfunction include an RV fractional area change (FAC) <35%

- or a tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE, the distance traveled between end‐diastole and end‐systole at the lateral corner of the tricuspid annulus) <16 mm.43
- **d.** During weaning from bypass, TEE is essential to identify intracardiac air. After termination of bypass, it should be used to assess the competence of valve repairs, identify paravalvular leaks after mitral valve replacement (MVR) (Figure 4.8), and assess LV and RV function. Occasionally, the TEE will reveal an unsuspected finding such as:
  - **i.** Systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the anterior mitral valve leaflet obstructing the LV outflow tract (after valve repairs or MVR with retention of the anterior leaflet)
  - **ii.** Evidence of valve dysfunction with a trapped or obstructed leaflet
  - **iii.** Aortic valve regurgitation after a difficult mitral valve operation (due to suture entrapment of an aortic valve cusp or distortion of the aortic annulus from placement of too small a mitral valve)
  - **iv.** Marked lateral wall hypokinesis from circumflex artery entrapment by valve sutures
- **e.** Percutaneous mitral valve repair with the MitraClip device is performed under general anesthesia with TEE guidance. Specific views are utilized to perform the septal puncture (bicaval, SAX at the base, four‐chamber) and then for

**Figure 4.8 •** Intraoperative TEE showing a paravalvular leak following tissue mitral valve replacement.

- maneuvering the system down to the mitral valve to avoid passage into the pulmonary veins or left atrial appendage. The mitral commissural and LVOT views are used to place the clip in the proper position with the aid of the 3D en face view to ensure correct clip orientation. Clip stability should be assessed prior to and after the clip has been deployed.
- **8.** The diagnosis of an **aortic dissection** can be confirmed by TEE once the patient is anesthetized (see Figure 2.27, page 152). It may not only identify the intimal flap but can also determine whether AR is present, mandating aortic valve resuspension or replacement. If a large pericardial effusion is present, axillary or groin cannulation may be necessary for the emergent institution of CPB before opening the pericardium. TEE can also identify flaps in cases of iatrogenic dissections at the cannulation or clamp sites.44
- **9.** In **thoracic aortic surgery**, TEE is useful in assessing cardiac performance and intracardiac volume status during the period of clamping and after unclamping, when PA pressures tend to be elevated out of proportion to preload. This may influence fluid and pharmacologic management.45 Positioning of an endograft for thoracic aortic repairs, including traumatic aortic tears, type B dissections, and thoracic aortic aneurysms, is usually confirmed by fluoroscopy, and the TEE probe should be pulled back to avoid interference with the x‐ray beam.

## **IV. Anesthetic Considerations for Various Types of Heart Surgery**

**A.** Anesthetic management must be individualized, taking into consideration the patient's age, comorbidities, the nature and extent of coronary or valvular disease, the degree of LV dysfunction, and plans for early extubation. These factors will determine which medications should be selected to avoid myocardial depression, tachycardia or bradycardia, or to counteract changes in vasomotor tone. Generally, a balanced anesthetic technique using a combination of narcotics and potent inhalational agents is used for all open‐heart surgery to minimize myocardial depression. Specific anesthetic concerns for various disease processes are presented in this section.

#### **B. Coronary artery bypass surgery**

- **1.** Factors that increase myocardial oxygen demand, such as tachycardia and hypertension, must be prevented in the prebypass period, especially during the induction of anesthesia. Hypotension, often resulting from the vasodilating effects of narcotics, anxiolytics (midazolam), and sedatives (propofol), should be counteracted with fluids and α‐agents, since hypotension is more likely to produce ischemia than hypertension.
- **2.** Detection and treatment of ischemia is critical in the prebypass period. TEE is the most sensitive means of detecting ischemic RWM abnormalities and can be recommended for all cardiac cases. Ischemia may also be manifested by an elevation in the PA pressures or by ST segment changes in the ECG leads. Aggressive management with nitroglycerin, β‐blockers (esmolol), and narcotics can usually control prebypass ischemia.46 Placement of an intra‐aortic balloon

- pump (IABP) may be considered for ischemia, but if the patient is truly unstable, prompt initiation of CPB may be necessary.
- **3.** Narcotic/sedative regimens are the standard for coronary surgery, especially in patients with LV dysfunction. Use of low‐dose fentanyl or sufentanil with inhalational anesthetics during the surgery, and use of propofol or dexmedetomidine at the conclusion of surgery allow for early postoperative extubation. Use of the short‐acting narcotic remifentanil along with a volatile inhalational anesthetic with rapid onset and offset of effect, such as sevoflurane or desflurane, allows for "ultra‐fast tracking" with extubation in the OR or upon arrival in the ICU.47 Remifentanil has been shown to minimize the systemic inflammatory response and shorten ventilation time, but it is associated with chest wall rigidity and the occurrence of chronic pain syndromes for up to one year.48,49
- **4.** Monitoring techniques for **off‐pump surgery** (OPCAB) commonly involve a continuous cardiac output Swan‐Ganz catheter with in‐line mixed venous oxygen saturation monitoring. Tilting of the OR table (Trendelenburg position and to the right) to augment cardiac filling, judicious fluid administration, antiarrhythmic therapy (lidocaine/magnesium), α‐agents (phenylephrine) and inotropes (epinephrine/milrinone), and, on occasion, insertion of an IABP may be used to produce hemodynamic stability when the heart is rotated for exposure of the coronary arteries. ß‐blockers to reduce the heart rate may be helpful to reduce cardiac motion during the distal anastomoses. The blood pressure may be lowered to the 80–90s during construction of the proximal anastomoses to reduce the risk of aortic injury when a sideclamp is placed on the aorta. Use of a warming system, especially the Kimberly‐Clark warming system (formerly the Arctic Sun temperature management system), is helpful in preventing hypothermia during OPCAB surgery.50 The essential elements of a successful off‐pump operation include a patient surgeon who uses good judgment in deciding when off‐pump surgery is feasible and when conversion to CPB or right‐heart assist is necessary, an anesthesiologist who is experienced and comfortable with off‐pump surgery, and a qualified, actively involved first assistant. See section IX (pages 262–264) for a more detailed discussion of anesthesia for off‐pump surgery.
- **5. MIDCAB** procedures involve internal thoracic artery (ITA) takedown either under direct vision or with endoscopic or robotic assistance. The anastomosis to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery is then performed through a small thoracotomy incision, but it can also be performed robotically. One‐lung anesthesia is generally used. Even with use of stabilization platforms, slowing the heart down pharmacologically may be helpful. Robotic coronary surgery can be performed off‐pump or on‐pump with groin cannulation.
- **C. Left ventricular aneurysms (LVAs).** Anesthetic drugs that cause myocardial depression must be avoided because of the association of LVAs with significant LV dysfunction. Swan‐Ganz monitoring is important in optimizing preload and contractility before and after bypass. TEE is the most sensitive means of detecting the presence of LV thrombus and provides an excellent assessment of ventricular wall thickness and motion (akinesia, hypokinesia, and dyskinesia noted with aneurysms). Aneurysm

- repairs may be performed with an unclamped aorta, allowing the surgeon to palpate the margin between viable and scarred myocardium. Proper deairing during closure is essential and can be monitored by TEE.
- **D. Ventricular septal defects** are usually operated upon on an emergent basis when the patient is in cardiogenic shock, usually on inotropic support and an IABP. Thus, myocardial depression must be avoided. Systemic hypertension may increase the shunt and should be prevented. TEE is invaluable in identifying the persistence of a left‐to‐right shunt.

#### **E. Aortic valve surgery**

- **1. Aortic stenosis (AS).** The induction of anesthesia is a critical period for patients with AS. The LV is generally hypertrophied and stiff with evidence of diastolic dysfunction. Avoidance of hypovolemia, myocardial depression, vasodilation, tachycardia, or dysrhythmias is important, as all of these can lower the cardiac output precipitously.
  - **a. Blood pressure issues.** Hypotension, usually as a result of vasodilation, can produce myocardial ischemia. Volume should be given to maintain intravascular volume, with the understanding that PA pressures may rise quickly with small infusions of volume in noncompliant ventricles and can adversely affect pulmonary function. Systemic resistance should be supported with a small bolus or infusion of an α‐agent, such as phenylephrine or norepinephrine. Hypertension can make aortic cannulation for CPB dangerous. It should be addressed by increasing the depth of anesthesia, use of propofol, or use of ß‐blockers. Post‐CPB, strict adherence to blood pressure control is essential to minimize bleeding from the aortotomy site and avoid the risk of dissection.
  - **b. Heart rate.** Loss of "atrial kick" can substantially compromise the cardiac output in patients with LV hypertrophy. Thus, atrial fibrillation (AF) developing before the initiation of bypass is often associated with profound hypotension for which cardioversion may be necessary. Tachyarrhythmias will compromise LV filling and can also precipitate ischemia. A short‐ acting ß‐blocker, such as esmolol or IV metoprolol, may be helpful to control a sinus tachycardia. A reentrant supraventricular or junctional tachycardia may require cardioversion. Sinus bradycardia or a slow junctional rhythm may cause hypotension and can be treated by attaching "alligator" leads to the right atrium to restore a supraventricular mechanism once the pericardium has been opened. Prior to that time, very slow rhythms can be treated by a bolus dose of 5–15 mg of ephedrine, 5–10 μg of epinephrine, or 0.2–0.4 mg of glycopyrrolate.
  - **c.** The best TEE views of the aortic valve are obtained in the ME SAX and LAX views (Figure 4.6). The important information prior to initiating CPB includes confirmation of the degree of AS and regurgitation and the estimated aortic annular diameter. During weaning from bypass, assessment for intracardiac air is essential and is best seen in the ME LVOT LAX view. Postbypass, valve competence, valve gradient, and LV function are important and should be evaluated by the anesthesiologist and surgeon. Significant abnormalities in valve

- function (primarily paravalvular or transvalvular regurgitation), and especially a significant RWM abnormality possibly related to coronary ostial obstruction by the valve sewing ring, need to be addressed.
- **d.** Most procedures are performed through a median sternotomy incision. "Minimally invasive" approaches include an upper sternotomy and right upper thoracotomy approach. Both central and peripheral cannulation for CPB may be used and the anesthesiologist may on occasion be asked to place venous drainage catheters, a PA vent, or a cardioplegia catheter. Anesthetic management of minimally invasive AVR is discussed in section XI on page 268.
- **e.** Transient AV block necessitating AV pacing upon termination of CPB is not uncommon in aortic valve surgery, and about 5% of patients may require a permanent pacemaker if this persists. It is critical that the pacing threshold be adequate prior to chest closure if the patient has third‐degree heart block.
- **f.** Comments on anesthetic management during TAVRs are noted in section VII on pages 268–269.
- **2. Aortic regurgitation (AR).** Chronic AR produces volume overload and progressive LV dilatation and compromise of ventricular function. It is associated with a low diastolic pressure that can compromise coronary perfusion.
  - **a.** Hypotension will worsen coronary ischemia while hypertension and bradycardia will increase regurgitation. Thus, a delicate balance must be sought to optimize hemodynamics by maintaining satisfactory preload, treating bradycardia, and avoiding hyper‐ or hypotension before going on CPB. Volatile anesthetics that depress contractility should be avoided. These patients tend to be vasodilated on pump and afterwards as well, often requiring vasopressor support.
  - **b.** The ME aortic valve LAX and SAX and TG LAX views with color Doppler are best for assessing AR, and allow for the measurement of the pressure half‐ time (P1/2t). Careful examination of the valve in the ME SAX view is best to determine whether it is repairable or not.
  - **c.** Myocardial protection, especially of the RV, may be compromised in patients with severe AR, since antegrade cardioplegia cannot be administered into the aortic root. Retrograde cardioplegia and use of ostial antegrade perfusion are usually used. Patients with occluded right coronary arteries are at higher risk for RV dysfunction. Post‐CPB, inotropic support may be necessary in patients with pre‐existing LV dysfunction, and many patients are vasodilated and hypotensive despite good cardiac function, requiring an α‐agent or vasopressin for blood pressure support.
  - **d.** The LV is usually dilated and compliant and significant volume infusions may be necessary to maintain preload and cardiac output coming off‐pump.
- **F. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.** Measures that produce hypovolemia or vasodilation must be avoided because they increase the outflow tract gradient. Volume infusions should be used to maintain preload, with the use of α‐agents to maintain systemic resistance. Use of β‐blockers and calcium channel blockers to reduce the heart rate and contractility are beneficial in the immediate preoperative and prebypass periods. Inotropic drugs with predominantly β‐adrenergic effects could provoke the gradient and must be avoided. TEE assessment of subvalvular pathology is

essential so that the surgeon can address issues with papillary muscle pathology in addition to performing a septal myectomy. Assessment of the degree of MR prior to and after surgical repair is essential.51

#### **G. Mitral valve surgery**

- **1. Mitral stenosis (MS).** Severe MS is associated with impairment to LV filling resulting in an elevation of left atrial and PA pressures to maintain cardiac output. This may result in RV dilatation and functional TR as well. The LV is usually small. Severe MS is often associated with AF with dilated atrial chambers, for which patients should be on preoperative anticoagulation to reduce the risk of formation of thrombus in the left atrial appendage. Attention should be paid to maintaining preload, reducing heart rate, and preventing an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in the prebypass period.
  - **a.** Preload must be adjusted judiciously to ensure adequate LV filling across the stenotic valve while simultaneously avoiding excessive fluid administration that could lead to pulmonary edema.
  - **b.** In patients with severe pulmonary hypertension and RV dysfunction, a volumetric (RVEF) Swan‐Ganz catheter is valuable in the assessment of RV volume and the RV ejection fraction. The PA diastolic pressure may be inconsistent with the left atrial pressure, and placement of a left atrial line for monitoring postbypass may be considered. Balloon inflation ("wedging") of a PA catheter should be avoided or performed with a minimal amount of balloon inflation in patients with pulmonary hypertension because of the increased risk of PA rupture. If the patient remains hypotensive despite adequate preload, an α‐agent is preferable to restore the blood pressure. Inotropic agents are usually not of much value, since LV function is usually normal, but they may be beneficial if there is evidence of RV dysfunction (usually epinephrine +/− milrinone).
  - **c.** Prebypass TEE is helpful in identifying left atrial thrombus. It should also be used to assess RV function, which can be compromised due to pulmonary hypertension.
  - **d.** The heart rate should be reduced to <80/min to prolong the diastolic filling period. For patients in AF, small doses of esmolol or diltiazem can be used to control a rapid ventricular response. If the AF is of short duration, cardioversion can be performed for an uncontrolled rate with hypotension as long as the TEE confirms absence of thrombus in the left atrial appendage. Cardiac output is usually marginal in patients with MS and can be further compromised if the ventricular rate is excessively slow.
  - **e.** Factors that can increase the PVR must be avoided. Preoperative sedation can induce hypercarbia and should be minimized. Hypoxemia, hypercarbia, acidosis, and nitrous (not nitric) oxide should be avoided in the OR. The PVR can be reduced with systemic vasodilators (propofol) or nonspecific pulmonary vasodilators (usually nitroglycerin) before bypass. Following bypass, RV support is best achieved using inotropic agents that can produce pulmonary vasodilation (usually milrinone). In patients with severe pulmonary hypertension and RV dysfunction, inhaled nitric oxide, epoprostenol (Flolan), or iloprost (Ventavis) can be used. Further discussion of the postoperative management of mitral valve surgery and the management of RV dysfunction is noted on pages 396–397 and 530–534.

- **f.** TEE should be used during weaning from bypass to identify intracardiac air. Once off bypass, TEE should assess the mean gradient if a commissurotomy is performed, and check for paravalvular or transvalvular leaks of a mitral prosthesis. For mechanical valves, proper opening and closing of the leaflets must be confirmed.
- **g.** Although the INR should be corrected prior to surgery, levels of clotting factors are rarely normal despite a lowering of the INR into the normal range, so one should anticipate a potential coagulopathy and the potential need for clotting factors (fresh frozen plasma and/or cryoprecipitate). Rarely, AV groove disruption may occur, especially in patients with mitral annular calcification, which will cause catastrophic hemorrhage.

#### **2. Mitral regurgitation (MR)**

- **a.** MR results in volume overload of the left atrium and ventricle, which subsequently dilate and develop increased compliance. Eventually, the PA pressure rises, causing RV dysfunction and TR, and then the LV, despite the low pressure unloading, begins to fail. Poor LV function with severe MR is an ominous prognostic sign since restoration of mitral valve competence will "unmask" LV dysfunction that was not appreciated due to LV unloading through the regurgitant valve.
- **b.** Measures that can increase PA pressure, such as hypoxemia, hypercarbia, acidosis, and nitrous oxide, should be avoided. Preoperative sedation should be light or avoided altogether.
- **c.** In the prebypass period, adequate preload must be maintained to ensure forward output. Some patients come to the OR "dry" because of chronic diuretic usage, while others may be in heart failure from severe MR. Systemic hypertension should be avoided, because the increased resistance to outflow will usually worsen MR. If the patient has ischemic MR or a borderline cardiac output, use of systemic vasodilators or an IABP will improve forward flow. Inotropes with vasodilator properties (i.e. milrinone or dobutamine) should be considered in patients with markedly compromised LV function. Heart rate should be optimized; a slightly faster heart rate in the 80–90s will reduce the degree of MR, and a slow heart rate may cause hypotension.
- **d.** TEE is invaluable in identifying the precise anatomic cause for MR, assessing the risk of SAM42 (see section D.7.b, page 231 and in evaluating the surgical result. TEE is performed once the patient is anesthetized. The critical views include the ME two‐ and four‐chamber views, the ME mitral commissural view, and the ME LAX views. These, along with the 3D en face views, allow for the visualization of all of the mitral valve scallops to help identify the precise location of the pathology causing the MR. Occasionally, there is a discrepancy between preoperative and intraoperative studies, due to alterations in systemic resistance and loading conditions. Elevating the blood pressure with an α‐agent may increase the amount of regurgitation in patients with moderate ischemic MR and aid in the decision to repair the valve during coronary bypass surgery. TEE is evaluated for intracardiac air when weaning from bypass and for evaluating mitral valve competence after a repair, regurgitant leaks after a mitral valve replacement, and RV and LV function.

- **e.** Measures noted above to decrease PA pressures may be used before or after bypass to optimize RV function. Both RV and LV function may be compromised after mitral valve surgery, requiring judicious hemodynamic support. This is discussed in detail on pages 385–396 and 530–534.
- **f. Percutaneous mitral valve repairs** (MitraClip) are performed under general anesthesia with the use of TEE monitoring. A Swan‐Ganz catheter may be placed for documentation of right heart pressures, but it is not essential. Left atrial pressures (assessment of the "v" wave) before and after clip placement are obtained by direct measurement through the guide catheter. Familiarity with all of the requisite TEE images and with 3D echo imaging is critical to the success of the procedure. Reduction in the degree of MR is anticipated but is generally not as successful as a surgical repair. Further comments on anesthesia for these repairs is noted in section XIII on pages 269–271.

#### **H. Maze procedure for atrial fibrillation**

- **1.** The cut‐and‐sew Cox‐Maze procedure to eliminate AF has been generally replaced by devices that produce comparable transmural ablation lines using either radiofrequency or cryoablation. A left atrial Maze procedure is most commonly performed as a concomitant procedure with mitral valve surgery, although a biatrial Maze may be more successful in eliminating AF (see Figures 1.28 and 1.29). Anesthesia management is directed toward the primary pathology for which surgery is being performed if the Maze procedure is performed as an adjunct. Medications may be used for rate control pre‐CPB.
- **2.** Bilateral pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) with resection and oversewing of the left atrial appendage is an appropriate procedure for patients with paroxysmal AF. This operation can be performed as an adjunct to any cardiac procedure or as an isolated operation. Surgery for lone AF may be performed through a sternotomy incision or through bilateral thoracoscopic ports. This requires repositioning of the patient with the operated side elevated about 30 degrees and the use of one‐lung anesthesia to allow the surgeon better exposure to isolate the pulmonary veins. The "convergent" procedure entails a subcostal incision to place epicardial ablation lines followed by an endocardial approach by the electrophysiologist (see Chapter 1).
- **3.** Most surgeons will use amiodarone for early AF prophylaxis, and this is usually given IV during the procedure (unless previously given) and then continued orally for several months.

#### **I. Tricuspid valve disease**

- **1.** Maintenance of an elevated CVP is essential to achieve satisfactory forward flow in tricuspid stenosis. A Swan‐Ganz catheter can be placed for monitoring PA pressures, although cardiac output determinations are of little value if TR is present. If placed at the beginning of surgery, it is withdrawn into the superior vena cava (SVC) when the tricuspid valve is being addressed and then is readvanced through a repaired valve or a bioprosthetic valve replacement. If not done under direct vision by the surgeon, advancement may need to be deferred until the SVC cannula has been removed. The Vigileo/FloTrac monitor can provide adequate cardiac output measurements based on the arterial line pulse wave, but it will be inaccurate with AF.
- **2.** Normal sinus rhythm provides better hemodynamics than AF, although the latter is frequently present. Slower heart rates are preferable for tricuspid stenosis and faster heart rates for TR.

- **3.** Tricuspid valve surgery requires entry into the right atrium. Therefore, tourniquets are placed around the SVC and inferior vena cava (IVC) cannulas to avoid air entry into the venous lines. With the SVC tourniquet tightened, the patient's head should be observed for congestion, which indicates inadequate drainage by the SVC cannula. An elevated CVP may be noted, depending on the location of the measurement.
- **4.** Functional TR usually results from RV dilatation and dysfunction due to increased RV afterload from pulmonary hypertension. TEE assessment of tricuspid annular diameter may be helpful to the surgeon in determining whether a tricuspid valve repair is indicated for functional TR even when mild–moderate in severity.52 A dilated annulus ≥40 or ≥21 mm2 is a Class IIa indication for tricuspid repair during left‐sided repairs.53
- **5.** RV dysfunction is not uncommon once valve competence has been restored and may be exacerbated by suboptimal RV protection during cardioplegic arrest. Tricuspid valve repair for severe TR in patients with preexisting RV dysfunction is very high risk, and use of inotropes that can also lower the PVR (milrinone, dobutamine, and rarely isoproterenol), selective pulmonary vasodilators, or right ventricular assist device (RVAD) support may be required.
- **6.** Patients with hepatic congestion often have abnormal liver function that can impair the synthesis of clotting factors. A coagulopathy may develop after CPB, necessitating use of multiple blood component transfusions (especially fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate) to control bleeding.

#### **J. Endocarditis**

- **1.** Anesthetic management is dictated by the hemodynamic derangements associated with the particular valve involved. TEE is invaluable in identifying valve pathology, vegetations, and perivalvular abscesses, and may occasionally demonstrate involvement of other valves not appreciated on preoperative studies.
- **2.** Surgery may be required urgently for HF or cardiogenic shock when there are acute regurgitant lesions, or for persistent sepsis. These patients tend to be quite ill, often with significant respiratory, cardiac, renal, and hematologic problems. Those operated upon for large vegetations or peripheral embolization tend to be more stable. Patients with aortic valve endocarditis may develop heart block from involvement of the conduction system by periannular infection. This may require preoperative placement of a transvenous pacing wire.
- **3.** Ongoing sepsis may produce refractory hypotension on pump despite the use of α‐agents. Vasopressin may be necessary to maintain blood pressure.

#### **K. Aortic dissections**

- **1.** Maintenance of hemodynamic stability and especially avoidance of hypertension are critical to prevent aortic rupture, especially during the induction of anesthesia and line insertion. Use of a Swan‐Ganz catheter is helpful in optimizing perioperative hemodynamics. Its insertion should be delayed until after intubation to minimize the stress response or can be performed later for postoperative management.
- **2.** Most patients require emergency surgery and should be considered to have a full stomach. A modified rapid‐sequence induction should be performed to minimize the risk of aspiration while ensuring hemodynamic stability.
- **3.** TEE is useful in localizing the site of the intimal tear and the proximal (and occasionally the distal) extent of the dissection, the degree of AR, and the presence of a

- hemopericardium. Because the diagnosis of an aortic dissection is usually obtained by a contrast CT scan, TEE is best performed once the patient has been anesthetized. If the diagnosis is in doubt, a TEE may be performed in an awake patient. In this situation, TEE must be performed **very cautiously** with light sedation for fear of precipitating hypertension, rupture, and then tamponade.
- **4.** Repair of a type A dissection is usually performed during a period of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA). The head is packed in ice, and medications may be given to potentially provide additional cerebral protection (see section L.1). To document reaching 18–20 °C for DHCA, tympanic temperatures correlate better with arterial blood temperatures than do bladder and rectal measurements, which are considered to represent the core temperature.54 Use of a temperature management system is important to prevent temperature afterdrop during the rewarming phase. Uncommonly, the repair does not require DHCA and these measures are not necessary.55 Coagulopathies should be anticipated with this procedure, and blood clotting factors should be requested early and should be available immediately after protamine administration, if needed.
- **5.** Repair of type B dissections should be accomplished by an endovascular approach if at all possible. An open surgical approach requires a period of descending aortic cross‐clamping. Because less collateral flow is present in patients with dissections than with atherosclerotic aneurysms, the risk of paraplegia is greater. Left‐heart bypass may reduce the risk of paraplegia.56 A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage catheter should be placed before the patient is anesthetized. Proximal hypertension must be controlled during application of the cross‐clamp, but it should not be so low as to compromise spinal cord perfusion. A CSF drain is also useful if an endovascular stent procedure is performed for a complicated type B dissection.57

#### **L. Ascending aortic and arch aneurysms**

- **1.** Aneurysms limited to the ascending aorta are repaired on CPB with application of an aortic cross‐clamp. If they extend more distally or the arch is extensively involved, a period of DHCA at 18–20 °C core temperature is used. This usually ensures a lower nasopharyngeal or tympanic temperature, which correlates best with brain temperature. At this point, it is inferred that there is EEG silence with a bispectral index (BIS) analysis reading of 0. This should provide about 45 minutes of safe arrest time and minimize the risk of neurologic insult.
- **2.** Adjuncts to improve cerebral protection include selective antegrade (ACP) or retrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP), and packing the head in ice.58–60 Administration of methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg may be considered, but evidence of any benefit is unclear.61,62 Some groups prefer to use cold cerebral perfusion techniques to protect the brain while maintaining the body at only moderate hypothermia (21–28 °C).62–64 One study found no difference in neurologic outcome between the use of DHCA + RCP and moderate HCA with ACP, but twice as many new diffusion‐weighted MRI lesions were noted in the latter group.64
- **3.** Profound hypothermia and warming are associated with a coagulopathy. Platelets, fresh frozen plasma, and cryoprecipitate are helpful in achieving hemostasis. Supplemental use of warming devices is beneficial in warming the patient and preventing temperature afterdrop.

#### **M. Descending aortic and thoracoabdominal aneurysms (TAAs)**

- **1.** Arterial monitoring lines are inserted in the right radial and femoral arteries to monitor proximal and distal pressures during the period of aortic cross‐clamping. The femoral line is valuable when left‐heart bypass techniques are used.
- **2.** A Swan‐Ganz catheter is important to monitor filling pressures during the period of cross‐clamping. TEE is helpful in evaluating myocardial function and often demonstrates a hypovolemic LV chamber despite elevated PA pressures when the cross‐clamp is removed. Ensuring adequate intravascular volume will reduce the risk of "declamping shock" upon release of the aortic cross‐clamp.
- **3.** One‐lung anesthesia using a double‐lumen or Univent tube with a bronchial blocker improves operative exposure.
- **4.** Control of proximal hypertension is essential during the cross‐clamp period to minimize the adverse effects of increased afterload on LV function. However, lowering the pressure too much can reduce renal and spinal cord perfusion and increase the CSF pressure, so maintaining a pressure >130 mm Hg is recommended. Additional steps should be taken to optimize distal perfusion pressure to minimize the risk of distal ischemic injury during aortic cross‐clamping. This includes use of CSF drainage, distal perfusion to maintain collateral network perfusion pressure, and reattachment of segmental arteries T8–12.65 Cold renal perfusion, epidural cooling, or use of DHCA may also be considered.66–68
- **5.** Endovascular stent placement is performed under conscious sedation or general anesthesia. Devices may be placed percutaneously or via a surgical groin incision with placement either directly into the femoral artery or through a side graft in patients with extensive aortoiliac disease. The landing zones are located by fluoroscopy. Spinal cord ischemia remains a concern with extensive endovascular repairs, and CSF drainage is recommended.69

### **N. Implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator (ICD) placement**

- **1.** Transvenous ICD implantation is usually performed in an electrophysiology laboratory under moderate sedation with propofol or dexmedetomidine, allowing the patient to breathe spontaneously. When ventricular fibrillation is induced, deepening the level of sedation and assisted ventilation usually suffices. This requires close nursing or anesthesia attendance and careful monitoring. Most patients have markedly depressed ventricular function, and provisions for cardiac resuscitation (personnel and equipment) should be immediately available. External defibrillator pads should be placed for rescue defibrillation.
- **2.** Medications that could be potentially arrhythmogenic, such as the catecholamines, must be avoided. Antiarrhythmic medications are continued unless there are plans for an electrophysiology study, which is usually performed with the patient off medications.
- **3.** Subcutaneous ICD implants may require a higher level of sedation than transvenous implants, but generally it can be accomplished without the use of general anesthesia.70

#### **O. Cardioversion**

**1.** Awake patients requiring emergency cardioversion in the ICU are generally hemodynamically unstable and should be given extremely light sedation prior to being cardioverted (1–2.5 mg of midazolam or 2–5 mg morphine). If the patient

- is still anesthetized and sedated, an increase in the infusion rate of propofol may be considered.
- **2.** Patients requiring less urgent cardioversion for hemodynamic compromise or undergoing elective cardioversion (usually after TEE confirmation of absence of left atrial appendage thrombus) should receive a small dose of propofol (0.5–1 mg/ kg or approximately 50–100 mg). Alternatively, etomidate (0.3 mg/kg or a 10–20 mg bolus) can be used, especially in patients with compromised ventricular function. Etomidate may produce myoclonus in up to 50% of patients, often causing ECG interference, which makes synchronized cardioversion very difficult.71 Anesthesia stand‐by is recommended to provide airway support during the short period of sedation.

#### **P. Surgery for pericardial disease**

- **1.** Pericardial drainage of a large pericardial effusion or for tamponade is often performed urgently or emergently. In the immediate postoperative period, emergent exploration through a full sternotomy incision may be carried out in the ICU if tamponade is associated with severe hypotension or cardiac arrest. Otherwise, emergency exploration is carried out in the OR. Most patients are still intubated and sedated, and most still have a Swan‐Ganz catheter and satisfactory venous access in place, and there is little time for insertion of additional lines. Patients are generally in a low cardiac output state, and blood pressure is dependent on adequate preload, increased heart rate, and increased sympathetic tone. Volume infusions and less commonly, β‐agonists are beneficial in trying to maintain hemodynamic stability. Any medications that slow the heart rate must be avoided, and sedatives and anesthetic drugs that produce vasodilation must be given judiciously to avoid profound hypotension and cardiac arrest. Since loss of sympathetic tone can be catastrophic in a patient with tamponade physiology, prepping and draping of the patient should be considered before the administration of additional anesthetic agents. There is generally striking hemodynamic improvement once the pericardial blood is evacuated.
- **2.** In less emergent situations, drainage is usually indicated for hemodynamically significant effusions. This may be accomplished by a pericardiocentesis performed in the cath lab with local anesthesia, depending on the size and location of the effusion. If this cannot be accomplished, the procedure is performed in the OR. A large‐bore central venous line should be inserted. A subxiphoid incision can be made under local anesthesia with moderate sedation, but more commonly it is done under general anesthesia. Again, if there is evidence of tamponade, blood pressure is dependent on adequate preload, heart rate, and increased sympathetic tone, so agents that produce vasodilation, bradycardia, or myocardial depression must be avoided. The patient may need to be prepped and draped before the induction of anesthesia, to prevent cardiovascular collapse.
- **3.** TEE is invaluable in identifying the size and hemodynamic effects of an effusion. With limited surgical approaches, such as a subxiphoid window or thoracoscopy, TEE can identify whether the effusion has been adequately drained.
- **4.** After resolution of tamponade, filling pressures generally fall, blood pressure increases, and a brisk diuresis occurs. Depending on the duration of tamponade, some patients may require transient inotropic support after the fluid is removed.

**5.** Patients with chronic constrictive pericarditis are usually in a chronic, compensated low cardiac output state. It is similarly essential to avoid hypovolemia, vasodilation, bradycardia, or myocardial depression. After the constricted heart is decorticated, filling pressures may transiently fall, but many patients develop a low output state associated with RV dilatation and will require inotropic support. Inadequate decortication may be evident when a fluid challenge that restores the preoperative filling pressures fails to increase cardiac output. Pulmonary edema may develop if the surgeon decorticates the RV while the LV remains constricted.

## **V. Induction and Maintenance of Anesthesia**

- **A.** Cardiac anesthesia is provided by a combination of medications, including induction agents, anxiolytics, amnestics, analgesics, muscle relaxants, and inhalational anesthetics.72 Although most centers used a "balanced anesthesia" technique, studies have reported comparable results with regimens of volatile inhalational anesthetics vs. total IV anesthesia for cardiac surgery.73
- **B.** Induction agents may include propofol, etomidate, ketamine, or a benzodiazepine. Most commonly, anesthesia is induced with a combination of propofol, a narcotic, and a neuromuscular blocker to provide muscle relaxation and prevent chest wall rigidity that is associated with high‐dose narcotic inductions. The most common doses for induction are propofol 1–2 mg/kg (50–100 mg), fentanyl 2.5–5 μg/kg (250–500 μg), and vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg IV followed by 0.01–0.03 mg/kg every 30 minutes. Alternative narcotics, such as sufentanil and remifentanil, are rarely used. Low‐dose fentanyl has a duration of action of 1–4 hours, which allows the patient to awaken within hours of completion of the operation. Remifentanil is a very short‐acting narcotic with a duration of action of only 10 minutes. It is beneficial in shorter operations and allows for very early awakening and extubation.
  - **1.** Succinylcholine is a depolarizing agent with rapid onset that can be used during rapid‐sequence inductions or in patients with difficult airways.
  - **2.** Although rarely used, ketamine given with a benzodiazepine is very useful in patients with compromised hemodynamics or tamponade. Ketamine does not produce myocardial depression, and its dissociative effects and sympathetic stimulant properties that produce hypertension and tachycardia are attenuated by use of a benzodiazepine.74
- **C.** Subsequently, anesthesia is maintained by additional dosing of narcotics and muscle relaxants in combination with an anxiolytic, such as propofol, and an inhalational agent (Tables 4.2 and 4.3). Bispectral electroencephalographic monitoring (BIS) can be used during on‐ and off‐pump surgery to titrate and minimize the amount of medication required to maintain adequate anesthesia (a level around 55–60) while minimizing hemodynamic alterations and preventing awareness.75,76 This is useful during off‐pump surgery and during bypass, when hemodilution increases the effective volume of distribution of anesthetic medications and may necessitate redosing. The dose and selection of anesthetic agents must provide adequate anesthesia and analgesia during surgery, but it may be modified to allow for extubation in the OR or, more frequently, several hours after arrival in the ICU.

- **D.** Midazolam has an elimination half‐life of over 10 hours in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Therefore, its use is best limited to the prebypass period.
- **E.** Propofol is used for induction, may be given during bypass at doses of 20–30 μg/kg/ min, and is usually given at the termination of CPB and continued in the ICU at a dose of 25–75 μg/kg/min.77 Propofol can be used to control postbypass hypertension because of its strong vasodilator properties. When the patient is stable, the propofol is turned off and the patient is allowed to awaken.
- **F.** Inhalational agents provide muscle relaxation and unconsciousness, with variable effects on myocardial depression. Agents commonly used include sevoflurane, desflurane, and isoflurane, with relatively comparable influence on outcomes.78–81 They are generally given during CPB to maintain anesthesia and reduce blood pressure, and allow for use of lower doses of IV medications, although they provide

no analgesia. Desflurane and sevoflurane have been found to be cardioprotective. They have less lipid solubility with a rapid onset of action and are quickly reversible, allowing for early extubation. Nitrous oxide is contraindicated in that it reduces the amount of oxygen that can be delivered and it also may increase PA pressures.

- **G.** Muscle relaxants are given throughout the operation to minimize patient movement and suppress shivering during hypothermia. Adequate muscle relaxation might reduce some of the paraspinal muscle soreness often noted after surgery due to sternal retraction. Most neuromuscular blockers have minimal effect on myocardial function or blood pressure other than atracurium, which tends to lower the blood pressure (Tables 4.2 and 4.3).
  - **1. Vecuronium** (Norcuron) does not undergo renal elimination and may be selected in patients with renal insufficiency. It does not have vagolytic properties, so the heart rate is generally fairly slow when used with fentanyl. **Rocuronium** (Zemuron) and **cisatracurium** (Nimbex) are short‐acting neuromuscular blockers with rapid onset of action that can be used if very early

- extubation is planned. **Pancuronium** is an excellent neuromuscular blocker that is beneficial in offsetting the bradycardia often noted with administration of narcotics. It has been in short supply since 2016 and is now used infrequently.
- **2.** Although some centers reverse muscle relaxants at the end of the operation to expedite extubation, this may prove detrimental if the patient becomes agitated and develops hemodynamic alterations. A conservative approach is to observe the patient in the ICU for several hours, during which time most of the neuromuscular blockade dissipates, and extubation can then be achieved. **Adequate sedation must be maintained in the ICU while a patient remains pharmacologically paralyzed.**
- **H. Dexmedetomidine** (Precedex) is an α<sup>2</sup> ‐adrenergic agonist with numerous properties, including sedation, analgesia, anxiolysis, and sympatholysis. However, it lacks an amnesic effect. During surgery, it can be used to reduce the dosage of other medications, allowing for early, comfortable extubation. It may also reduce shivering and myocardial ischemia and may improve hemodynamic performance. It can be used alone to provide sedation during a TAVR. Another benefit of this drug is that it aids in weaning the patient from the ventilator when they develop agitation or patient–ventilator dyssynchrony as the propofol dose is decreased. In comparison with propofol, dexmedetomidine appears to shorten the duration of ventilation and is associated with a lower incidence of delirium, especially in older patients.82,83 It is, however, associated with more bradycardia than propofol due to its sympatholytic effects. It is given as a loading dose of 1 μg/kg over 10 minutes followed by a continuous infusion of 0.2–1.5 μg/kg/h (most commonly in the 0.5–0.75 μg/kg/h range).

## **VI. General Prebypass Considerations**

- **A.** Prior to the commencement of surgery, the anesthesiologist is responsible for the safe insertion of monitoring lines, avoidance or treatment of hemodynamic or ischemic changes during the induction of anesthesia and intubation, and the placement and initial interpretation of the TEE (Table 4.4). In addition, the anesthesiologist is responsible for:
  - **1.** The administration of prophylactic antibiotics starting within one hour (cephalosporins) or two hours (vancomycin) of the initiation of surgery14
  - **2.** Placing external defibrillator pads (over the midaxillary line and back) for reoperations or TAVRs
  - **3.** Ensuring that positioning of the head and arms is safe (with nursing)
  - **4.** Ensuring adequate functioning of the cerebral oximetry pads (with perfusion)
- **B.** Avoidance of ischemia prior to initiating bypass is critical for all types of heart surgery. Identification of ischemic ECG changes, elevation in filling pressures, or RWM abnormalities on TEE requires prompt attention. Manipulation of the heart by the surgeon for cannula placement, blood loss during redo dissections, ongoing blood loss from leg incisions, and AF during atrial cannulation are a few of the potential insults that must be addressed. Judicious use of fluids and α‐agents to counteract vasodilation and hypotension, β‐blockers or additional anesthetic agents to treat hypertension or tachycardia, and nitroglycerin to treat ischemia must be selected

#### **Table 4.4 • Anesthetic Considerations Prior to Cardiopulmonary Bypass**

- 1. Line insertion and monitoring
- 2. Antibiotics prior to skin incision
- 3. External defibrillator pads for reoperations
- 4. Selection of medications for "balanced anesthesia" and plans for early extubation
- 5. Endotracheal intubation
- 6. Transesophageal echocardiography
- 7. Antifibrinolytic drug administration
- 8. Insertion of coronary sinus catheter or vents in minimally invasive surgery
- 9. Maintaining hemodynamics and avoiding or treating ischemia
- 10. Monitoring and treatment of abnormal cerebral oximetry
- 11. Heparinization for CPB

appropriately to maintain stable hemodynamics. In the prebypass period, fluids are usually administered in the form of crystalloid, but excessive infusions in vasodilated patients and those with significant preoperative anemia should be avoided. During minimally invasive surgery, the limited exposure may prevent the surgeon from directly visualizing most of the heart, reinforcing the importance of the anesthesiologist in using appropriate monitoring to identify and address abnormalities to ensure a stable perioperative course.

- **C. Transesophageal echocardiography** should be performed after intubation and line placement to provide a baseline assessment of RWM abnormalities and to identify known or overlooked valvular pathology. A comprehensive TEE examination should be performed according to ASE guidelines.31 In minimally invasive valve cases, it is used to identify the placement of the coronary sinus catheter and PA vent and the positioning of the femoral venous line in the right atrium. For off‐pump bypass surgery, it is utilized to assess RWM abnormalities during bypass grafting.
- **D. Autologous blood withdrawal** before the institution of bypass protects platelets from the damaging effects of CPB. The quality of this blood is excellent, with only slight activation of platelets, and it has been demonstrated to preserve red cell mass and reduce transfusion requirements.84,85 It can be considered in patients for whom the calculated hematocrit on pump will remain adequate after withdrawal of 1–2 units of blood with nonheme fluid replacement.
- **E. Steroids** might be considered to mitigate the systemic inflammatory response to CPB, although evidence of significant clinical benefit is weak. Use of high doses of methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg) or dexamethasone (1 mg/kg) may reduce emetic symptoms and improve appetite after surgery, but they have been associated with hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, an increased risk of delayed tamponade, transient subclinical organ system damage, as well as more pronounced pulmonary dysfunction.86–93
- **F. Antifibrinolytic drugs** have been demonstrated to reduce perioperative blood loss in cardiac operations.94,95 They should be used for all on‐pump procedures and may be of benefit in off‐pump cases as well. Most protocols include giving the first dose at

the time of skin incision, giving a dose in the pump prime, and administering a constant infusion throughout the operation. One report suggests that the initial dose should be given after heparinization, since thrombus was noted on a PA catheter when given earlier. 96

- 1. ε-aminocaproic acid (Amicar) is an inexpensive medication that has antifibrinolytic properties, and it may also preserve platelet function by inhibiting the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. It is primarily effective in reducing bleeding when given prophylactically, with questionable benefit if given only for postoperative bleeding with suspected fibrinolysis. There are not that many reports on its efficacy, but it is the most commonly used antifibrinolytic medication in the US. Studies suggest equal benefit to that of tranexamic acid. 98
  - **a.** One common regimen is to give 5 g after the induction of anesthesia, 5 g on pump, and 1 g/h during the procedure. Twice this dose is commonly used in patients weighing over 100 kg.
  - b. A pharmacokinetic study showed that the clearance of  $\epsilon$ -aminocaproic acid decreases and the volume of distribution increases during CPB. To maintain a plasma level of 260 mg/mL, an alternative weight-based protocol of a 50 mg/kg load over 20 minutes followed by a maintenance infusion of 25 mg/kg/h has been described. 99
  - c. Few adverse clinical effects have been noted with use of  $\epsilon$ -aminocaproic acid. There is no increased risk of stroke. 
    Although a subtle degree of renal tubular dysfunction may occur, as demonstrated by an increase in urine  $\beta_2$ -microglobulin levels, a 10 g dose was not shown to alter creatinine clearance. 
    101
- 2. Tranexamic acid (TXA) has similar properties to ε-aminocaproic acid, inhibiting fibrinolysis at a serum concentration of 10 μg/mL, and reducing plasmin-induced platelet activation at a level of 16 μg/mL.<sup>102</sup> It has been shown to reduce perioperative blood loss in on- and off-pump surgery.<sup>103,104</sup> Two studies showed that it significantly reduced blood loss in patients in whom aspirin and clopidogrel were given within seven days of surgery, possibly implying that surgery need not be delayed for a patient on clopidogrel. However, in those studies, the last dose was actually given on average five days prior to surgery, and there was most likely good recovery of platelet function within that time.<sup>105,106</sup> There are a variety of dosing protocols that have been recommended with slightly better efficacy at higher doses.<sup>107</sup> However, TXA has been associated with dose-related convulsive seizures in about 1% of patients. The commonly utilized protocols are the following:<sup>94</sup>
  - a. Modified low dose: 5 mg/kg load followed by 5 mg/kg/h
  - **b.** Low dose: 10 mg/kg over 20 minutes with 1–2 mg/kg in the pump prime, followed by a 1 mg/kg/h infusion probably preferable in patients at low risk for bleeding
  - c. High dose: 30 mg/kg loading dose, 2 mg/kg in the pump prime, and 16 mg/kg/h continuous infusion probably preferable in patients at high risk for bleeding<sup>108</sup>
- **3. Aprotinin** is a serine protease inhibitor that was found to be extremely effective in reducing perioperative bleeding in most cardiac procedures. It exhibited antifibrinolytic effects, preserved platelet function, and inhibited kallikrein, producing an anti-inflammatory effect. Although it was withdrawn from the US market in 2007, it is still available in other countries under select circumstances.

#### **G. Anticoagulation for cardiopulmonary bypass**

- **1.** Anticoagulation is essential during CPB to minimize the generation of thrombin and fibrin monomers caused by the interaction of blood with a synthetic interface. UFH is universally used because it is an effective anticoagulant and is reversible with protamine. In contrast, other anticoagulants that can be used for CPB, such as the direct thrombin inhibitors, are not reversible.109
- **2. Heparin dosing.** Heparin inhibits the coagulation system by binding to antithrombin (AT, previously called antithrombin III), inactivating primarily thrombin and factor Xa. Inactivation of thrombin prevents fibrin formation and also inhibits thrombin‐induced activation of platelets and factors V, VIII, and XI. A baseline activated clotting time (ACT) should be drawn after the operation has commenced and before systemic heparinization. One study recommended that the initial ACT should be drawn through the introducer sheath prior to placing a heparin‐coated PA catheter which may artificially elevate the baseline ACT.110 A small dose of heparin (5000 units = 50 mg) is given before division of the ITA or radial artery. The level IIa recommendation from joint societies is to administer an empiric total dose of 3 mg/kg of heparin prior to cannulation for CPB. Porcine heparin is associated with a lower risk of heparin antibody formation than bovine heparin and is therefore recommended.111
- **3. Heparin monitoring** is performed using a number of systems that measure the ACT.112
  - **a.** The ACT qualitatively assesses the anticoagulant effect of heparin, but does not measure nor necessarily correlate with heparin concentrations.113 There is great variability in patient response to heparin, and the ACT can be affected by hypothermia, hemodilution, and to a lesser degree by thrombocytopenia. Nonetheless, due to its simplicity and overall safety, achieving and maintaining a satisfactory ACT (>480 seconds for routine circuits and >400 seconds in biocompatible circuits) throughout the pump run is acceptable and universally utilized. ACTs should be monitored every 20–30 minutes during bypass (or prior to bypass if there is a significant delay before initiating bypass after initial heparinization), and additional heparin should be given as necessary. The Hepcon (Medtronic), Hemochron (Accriva Diagnostics), and i‐STAT (Abbott Point of Care) devices are commonly used to measure ACTs with this approach.
  - **b.** Because of individual patient variability in response to heparin, anticoagulation can also be assessed by calculating dose‐response curves using the Medtronic Hemostasis Management Systems (HMS or HMS Plus) or the Hemochron Response RxDx heparin and protamine dosing system. These systems measure circulating levels of heparin (desired level is >2–2.5 units/mL), determine the appropriate amount of heparin to achieve a desired ACT, and calculate the dose of protamine required to neutralize the heparin. Whole blood heparin concentrations correlate better with plasma anti‐Xa levels than the ACT. Achieving patient‐specific heparin levels more effectively suppresses hemostatic system activation than standard dosing based on an ACT alone, with less thrombin generation, less fibrinolysis, and less platelet activation. Although more heparin is often given with this system, less protamine is required for reversal, and less bleeding is noted after protamine neutralization.112,114 Despite these

- advantages, use of these systems has only a level IIb indication for use because they have not been shown to influence clinical outcomes.112 During cases involving DHCA, maintenance of blood heparin concentrations, rather than ACTs, has been shown to preserve the coagulation system better.115
- **c.** Use of heparin‐bonded circuits to reduce the inflammatory response has reduced the requisite level of heparinization necessary to minimize activation of the coagulation system. However, underanticoagulation results in thrombin generation, which then triggers platelet activation, resulting in clotting within the bypass circuit. An ACT exceeding 400 seconds is generally recommended with use of these circuits.
- **d.** During off‐pump surgery, the optimal ACT is most likely >250 seconds and can be achieved with 2.5 mg/kg of heparin in most cases. This should minimize thrombin formation, reduce activation of the coagulation system, and minimize fibrinolysis. This ACT level is not associated with an increased risk of thrombotic complications.116,117
- **4. Heparin resistance** is present when a heparin dose of 5 mg/kg fails to raise the ACT to an adequate level (>480 seconds). This is usually caused by AT deficiency, which can lead to a hypercoagulable state.
  - **a.** This is more likely to occur in patients on preoperative heparin, IV nitroglycerin, or an IABP, with elevated platelet counts >300,000/mm3 , and with infective endocarditis.118 Other risk factors associated with heparin resistance include high fibrinogen levels, which reduce the capacity of heparin to bind to AT, and smoking and COPD, which activate platelets and increase inflammatory markers and fibrinogen levels.119 Interestingly, it has been noted that heparin resistance can occur despite normal AT levels assessed by lab testing. Conversely, heparin resistance does not necessarily occur when AT levels are low. One study suggested that prophylactic AT administration in high‐risk patients might be considered despite a normal AT level to achieve optimal heparinization for CPB.119
  - **b.** If additional heparin does not elevate the ACT, fresh frozen plasma is usually given first to achieve an adequate ACT.120 However, this may not be effective and is associated with potential transfusion‐related side effects.121 Human AT is commercially available from a number of companies, the most common product being Thrombate III (Grifols) which contains 500 units per vial.122 Precise dosing of this product is difficult because baseline levels of AT are unknown in most cases and are most likely higher than levels noted in the rare patient with a hereditary AT deficiency. The amount needed is calculated as (desired – baseline AT level) × weight (kg) divided by 1.4. For example, to reach 120% of normal levels (which is recommended) in a 70 kg man with a baseline level 80% of normal would require [(120 – 80)/1.4] × 70 = 2000 units or 28 units/kg. If the baseline level is 50% of normal, 3500 units (50 units/kg) should be given. Another alternative is to use bivalirudin as the anticoagulant during bypass.123
- **5. Heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)** is a condition associated with the development of heparin-platelet factor 4 (PF4) complex antibodies that bind to platelets, triggering arterial and venous thrombosis.124,125 A fall of >50% in platelet count following administration of heparin is noted in most patients with HIT, but

- other potential etiologies for thrombocytopenia must be considered (especially the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors). If HIT is not identified and appropriately dealt with by using alternative anticoagulation regimens during surgery, it may be associated with life‐threatening postoperative complications.
- **a.** Most patients have been exposed to heparin for catheterization, and heparin-PF4 antibodies are detected by ELISA testing prior to surgery in 5–19% of patients in various studies.125–129 However, ELISA serologic testing for IgG‐ specific heparin‐dependent platelet antibodies has replaced prior testing that also detected non‐HIT causing IgM antibodies. Such testing was positive in about 20% of preoperative cardiac surgical patients, but only a minority of these patients actually have HIT‐causing antibodies and are susceptible to thrombotic complications that can be avoided by using alternative anticoagulation.130
- **b.** The benefit of assessing for the presence of preoperative heparin PF4 antibodies is not defined, and testing for preoperative antibodies in the absence of thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, or a known history of HIT is not indicated. The presence of antibodies alone is arguably not associated with an increased thrombotic risk, but it may be associated with other adverse outcomes, independent of the occurrence of HIT. However, if IgG platelet antibodies are present along with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis, it is beneficial to perform functional washed platelet activation assays, including the serotonin release assay to confirm the diagnosis of HIT.
- **c.** If HIT is present and the surgery is not urgent, it is best to wait three months before performing surgery. Antibodies usually clear in less than three months, at which time UFH can be used safely during surgery if the washed platelet activation assay is negative.
- **d.** When surgery is necessary on a more urgent basis and either acute HIT or subacute HIT (recovery from thrombocytopenia but a positive washed platelet activation assay) is present, use of UFH alone increases the risk of rapid‐onset HIT. Therefore, an alternate anticoagulation regimen is indicated.
  - **i. Bivalirudin**, a direct thrombin inhibitor, is the best alternative for anticoagulation for CPB when HIT is present. It has a rapid onset of action and a half‐life of 25 minutes. It is primarily metabolized by proteolytic cleavage with only 20% renal elimination, so slight modification is necessary in patients with renal dysfunction. It cannot be reversed, but it can be eliminated by hemofiltration and plasmapheresis. Studies comparing bivalirudin with UFH for cardiac surgery (on‐ and off‐pump) in patients with and without HIT have shown comparable outcomes.131–133 Attention must be paid to avoiding blood stagnation, which will cause nonenzymatic degradation of bivalirudin and allow for clotting to occur within the pump system, and to limiting the use of cardiotomy suction, so as to minimize the activation of the coagulation cascade.
    - ∙ Dosing for on‐pump surgery: 1.25 mg/kg load over five minutes, 50 mg in the pump prime, then a 2.5 mg/kg/h infusion. The infusion rate may be increased in increments of 0.1–0.5 mg/kg/h to maintain the ACT >2.5 times baseline or >500 seconds. The drug should be stopped 10–15 minutes before coming off CPB. If more than 20 minutes is anticipated before terminating bypass, the bivalirudin should be redosed with 0.5

- mg/kg and a 2.5 mg/kg/h infusion should be restarted. Ultrafiltration can remove 70% of the bivalirudin after coming off CPB.
- ∙ Dosing for off‐pump surgery: 0.75 mg/kg bolus, then 1.75 mg/kg/h to maintain an ACT >300 seconds.
- **ii.** If it is elected not to use bivalirudin for anticoagulation, other protocols include the use of UFH in the usual dose along with drugs that inhibit platelet activation, such as the prostacyclin analogs and IIb/IIIa inhibitors.
  - ∙ **Epoprostenol** is given in a dose of 5 ng/kg/min and increased by 5 ng/kg/min increments every five minutes (observing for systemic hypotension) up to 25 ng/kg/min, following which a heparin bolus is given. After protamine administration, the dose is weaned in 5 ng/kg decrements.134
  - ∙ **Iloprost** can be given starting at a dose of 3 ng/kg/min with a doubling of the dose every five minutes to a dose determined by preoperative *in vitro* testing. The usual dose required is 6–24 ng/kg/min.135
  - ∙ **Tirofiban**, a short‐acting glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor, can be given as a 10 mg/kg bolus 10 minutes prior to administration of standard‐dose heparin, followed by 0.15 μg/kg/min. It should be stopped one hour before the anticipated conclusion of CPB. Generally, 80% of the antiplatelet effect dissipates within four hours. Thus, bleeding may persist for a period of time after CPB has terminated, for which recombinant factor VIIa has been found beneficial.136

## **VII. Considerations During Cardiopulmonary Bypass**

- **A.** Virtually all valve surgery and most coronary bypass surgery is performed using CPB (Table 4.5). The essential components of the CPB circuit are discussed in Chapter 5. Basically, the blood drains by gravity or with vacuum assist from the right atrium into a reservoir, is oxygenated, cooled or warmed, and then returned to the patient through an arterial cannula, which is usually placed in the ascending aorta. The same principles apply during minimally invasive surgery, although the cannulation sites may vary. Desired hemodynamic and laboratory values during bypass are noted in Table 5.2 (page 299).
- **B.** The lungs are not ventilated during bypass, as oxygenation occurs within the oxygenator and carbon dioxide is eliminated by the gas flow into the oxygenator (the

#### **Table 4.5 • Anesthetic Considerations During Bypass (with Perfusionist)**

- 1. Use of vasopressor drugs to support systemic blood pressure
- 2. Administration of adjunctive drugs to optimize renal perfusion
- 3. Maintain adequate level of anesthesia with inhalational anesthetics or IV medications
- 4. Monitor cerebral oximetry
- 5. Sample blood for ACTs
- 6. Re‐administer antibiotics (cephalosporin) either when going on pump or at four‐hour intervals
- 7. Maintain blood glucose <180 mg/dL with IV insulin infusion

- sweep rate). Although some studies have suggested that the efficacy of gas exchange post‐pump is improved if the lungs remain inflated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during CPB, this is not common practice.137 Arterial blood gases are measured to ensure that the oxygenator is providing adequate oxygenation and that CO2 extraction is sufficient. Venous oxygen saturation is measured to determine if the systemic flow rate is adequate, and should be >65%. If in‐line monitoring is not available, studies should be repeated every 15–20 minutes by the perfusionist.
- **C.** Systemic hypothermia is utilized to varying degrees during on‐pump surgery as a means of organ system protection while the heart–lung machine provides nonphysiologic, nonpulsatile flow at low mean pressures. Cooling is initiated soon after CPB is started, and warming is commenced based on the amount of additional surgery anticipated so as to achieve near‐normothermia when CPB is terminated. Temperature is usually measured in the bladder using a Foley catheter with a temperature sensor, which is considered to represent core temperature. It is also measured in the venous return line and from the PA catheter. The STS guidelines recommend avoiding overwarming the patient to a core temperature greater than 37 °C to reduce the risk of neurologic damage, since the recorded bladder temperature will underestimate brain temperature and the brain receives the initial warmer flow from the aortic cannula.138 Temperature afterdrop is uncommon when mild–moderate hypothermia (>30 °C) is used, and warming devices are not necessary. In contrast, these devices are very helpful in preserving body temperature upon warming from deeper hypothermia. A warming device should be considered for blood and blood‐product transfusions, which may be given at a rapid rate.
- **D.** The serum level of antibiotics falls approximately 30–50% at the time of initiation of CPB, and an additional dose of a cephalosporin should be considered at that time. Alternatively, a second dose can be given 3–4 hours after the initial dose.14 An additional dose of vancomycin is not necessary.
- **E.** The optimal mean blood pressure during CPB to maintain adequate organ system perfusion is controversial. It has been shown that cerebral blood flow is more dependent on blood pressure than on flow rate.139,140 The brain is able to maintain cerebral blood flow by autoregulation until the pressure falls below 40 mm Hg, but this response is inadequate in diabetic and hypertensive patients, in whom a higher pressure must be maintained. Systemic pressures are subject to a number of variables.
  - **1.** Hypotension occurring on bypass is usually multifactorial. It may be related to hemodilution, use of preoperative vasodilators (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium channel blockers, and amiodarone), vasodilators used during bypass (inhalational anesthetics and propofol), vasodilation during rewarming, and autonomic dysfunction. It may also result from inadequate systemic flow rates, impairment of venous drainage, aortic regurgitation, the administration of cardioplegia, and the return of large amounts of cardiotomy‐suctioned blood into the circulation.
  - **2.** Hypertension may be related to vasoconstriction with hypothermia, inadequate levels of anesthesia and analgesia, elevation in endogenous catecholamine levels, and alterations in acid–base balance and blood gas exchange.
  - **3.** Standard management is to maintain a mean blood pressure around 65 mm Hg on CPB using vasodilators (narcotics, propofol, or inhalational anesthetics) or vasopressors (phenylephrine, norepinephrine, or vasopressin) as long as flow rates are

adequate. A venous oxygen saturation exceeding 65%, which is measured on-line by the perfusionist, generally indicates that the systemic flow rate is satisfactory, although there are usually differences in regional flow (i.e. less to the kidneys and splanchnic circulation). The venous saturation will be higher during systemic hypothermia, due to lower oxygen extraction, and may decrease significantly during rewarming, necessitating an increase in flow rates.

- **F.** Cerebral oximetry to assess the adequacy of cerebral oxygenation during CPB is an essential element of intraoperative care. Three commonly used systems are the INVOS (Medtronic), Equanox (NONIN Medical), and Foresight (Edward Lifesciences) devices. <sup>141</sup> They use near-infrared technology to assess regional cerebral oxygen saturations (rSO<sub>2</sub>) from bifrontal sensing pads placed on the patient's forehead (Figure 4.9).
  - 1. The rSO<sub>2</sub> tends to fall during initiation of bypass and during rewarming, even with an increase in systemic flow. The rSO<sub>2</sub> promptly detects problems with arterial desaturation even before it is evident by pulse oximetry. A reduction in rSO<sub>2</sub> greater than 20% may be associated with adverse neurologic outcomes and should be treated. Prior to bypass, steps to increase the systemic pressure or the PCO<sub>2</sub> will improve cerebral blood flow. Once on pump, modifications of flow rate, blood pressure, PCO<sub>3</sub>, or the hematocrit may be beneficial.
  - 2. Although a reduction in the monitored rSO $_2$  often reflects a poorly adherent sensor, a legitimate decrease in cerebral saturation may not only reflect moderate hypotension from vasodilatation or low pump flow rates, but could indicate cannula malplacement, aortic dissection, oxygenator or other pump-related failures, air embolism, or anaphylactic reactions to drugs, such as protamine. Although interventions to improve rSO $_2$  should intuitively reduce the adverse effects of desaturation, few studies have documented improvements in clinical outcome.  $^{143,144}$
  - 3. Cerebral oximetry may be a surrogate measure of cerebral autoregulation. Although most patients can autoregulate down to a pressure of 40–50 mm Hg, studies suggest that this level may vary quite considerably in different patients (between 40 and 90 mm Hg) and is unpredictable based on patient demographics. Because of a documented association between the duration and extent of time below the

- limits of autoregulation and major morbidity after cardiac surgery, it has been recommended that maintaining an adequate mean pressure within the autoregulatory range for the brain, as calculated from the cerebral oximetry readings, may ensure adequate perfusion to other organs such as the kidney, where blood flow is also autoregulated.145,146
- **G.** Blood glucose tends to be elevated due to the hormonal stress response to surgery and CPB with insulin resistance. An infusion of insulin to maintain blood glucose <180–200 mg/dL during surgery has not been shown to reduce inotropic requirements or the occurrence of arrhythmias, but it may reduce the incidence of neurocognitive dysfunction and other adverse outcomes, including death.147–150 Overly aggressive protocols to maintain blood glucose <100 mg/dL during surgery may increase the risk of stroke and death.151
- **H.** Measures to optimize renal function to reduce the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) should be considered in patients with preoperative renal dysfunction (stage III–IV chronic kidney disease), especially in diabetic, hypertensive patients. The primary considerations should be maintaining a higher mean perfusion pressure (around 80 mm Hg) or, at the minimum, above the cerebral autoregulatory threshold,145,146 keeping the pump run as short as possible, or avoiding it entirely with off‐pump techniques. Profound anemia (hematocrit <20%) should be avoided, as it may increase the risk of AKI.152,153 Pharmacologic means to optimize renal perfusion have been studied, with variable results.154–157 Fenoldopam (0.03–0.1 μg/kg/ min) may reduce the risk of AKI without any reduction in the need for renal replacement therapy or mortality.158,159 Sodium bicarbonate or statins cannot be recommended, and nesiritide, which did show some promise, has not been manufactured since 2018. Although both renal‐dose dopamine (3 μg/kg/min) and furosemide may increase urine output during CPB, neither has been found to be renoprotective.160 In fact, furosemide has actually been shown to increase the incidence of postoperative renal dysfunction. However, the major cause of postoperative renal dysfunction is a low output state, so maintenance of satisfactory hemodynamics at the termination of CPB is essential so that any intraoperative renal insults are transient.
- **I.** When the cross‐clamp is removed, lidocaine (100 mg) and magnesium (1–2 g) may be given to reduce the incidence of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.161 Ventricular fibrillation tends to occur when the heart is maintained at cold temperatures during the period of cardioplegic arrest and usually requires defibrillation, although spontaneous conversion to a sinus mechanism may occur. Del Nido cardioplegia uses lidocaine as a major ingredient, so the heart is less likely to fibrillate with removal of the aortic cross‐clamp.
- **J.** Administration of perioperative amiodarone reduces the incidence of postoperative AF.162 Based on the classic PAPABEAR trial published in 2005, amiodarone given for six days prior to and after surgery nearly halved the incidence of postoperative AF.163 Since this is rarely feasible or cost‐effective, a common protocol is to give a 150 mg bolus intraoperatively, followed by a 24‐hour IV infusion and then conversion to oral therapy. Postoperative initiation of IV and then PO amiodarone is also effective in reducing AF, so it is surprising that one study suggested that intraoperative initiation of amiodarone was not effective.164

### **VIII. Termination of Bypass and Reversal of Anticoagulation**

- **A.** Once the cardiac portion of the operation has been completed, the lungs are ventilated, and pacing is initiated, if necessary. Just prior to weaning from CPB, calcium chloride 1 g may be given to increase systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and provide some initial inotropic support (Table 4.6).
- **B.** Inotropic medications should be started before terminating bypass if it is anticipated that hemodynamic support may be necessary. This should be considered in patients with preexisting LV dysfunction, prebypass ischemia, recent infarction, suboptimal or incomplete revascularization, LV hypertrophy, and long cross‐clamp times. If an α‐agent (phenylephrine, norepinephrine) or vasopressin was necessary to support systemic pressure on pump, it will usually be required for a brief period of time after CPB is terminated.
- **C.** Bypass is weaned by gradually reducing the venous return to the CPB circuit, increasing intravascular volume in the patient and reducing the arterial flow rate.
- **D. Arterial blood pressure** monitoring in the radial artery is commonly inconsistent with the central aortic pressure, due to the presence of peripheral vasodilation. Measurement of the central aortic pressure using a stopcock on the aortic line is very helpful in sorting out discrepancies. If this problem persists for a short period of time, it is helpful to insert a femoral arterial monitoring line.
- **E. TEE** is utilized as the patient is being weaned from bypass and after bypass is terminated (Table 4.1). Significant benefits include:
  - **1.** Identifying intracardiac air. This is essential in valvular heart procedures or any procedure in which the left side of the heart has been entered (including venting). It is particularly valuable during minimally invasive procedures, in which exposure to the heart for deairing is limited.

#### **Table 4.6 • Anesthetic Considerations at the Conclusion of CPB**

#### When Terminating Bypass

- 1. Establish pacing as indicated
- 2. Resume mechanical ventilation
- 3. TEE to identify intracardiac air and assess ventricular function
- 4. Initiate pharmacologic therapy to support cardiac function and blood pressure as identified by TEE and Swan‐Ganz catheter assessments

#### After Terminating Bypass

- 1. TEE to assess ventricular function and valve issues (native valves, repairs, replacements); identify residual air
- 2. Adjustment of pharmacologic support based on systemic blood pressure, TEE, and Swan‐Ganz catheter measurements
- 3. Protamine administration
- 4. Use of blood and/or blood‐component therapy as indicated (point‐of‐care testing)

- **2.** Assessing regional and global ventricular function and correlating the cardiac output with loading conditions. TEE is the only means of assessing intravascular volume (preload) directly. The volume–pressure relationship is altered by decreased ventricular compliance after cardioplegic arrest, so higher filling pressures measured with the Swan‐Ganz catheter are usually necessary to achieve adequate intravascular volume, especially with hypertrophied hearts. The TEE assessment of ventricular volume should be correlated with pressure measurements to determine optimal filling pressures for subsequent management. TEE is invaluable in determining whether hypotension should be treated by volume infusions, inotropic medications, or α‐agents.
- **3.** After valve surgery, detecting paravalvular leaks, obstructed valve leaflets, or the competence of a valve repair.
- **F.** In most patients with satisfactory cardiac function, fluid administration to optimize preload is usually sufficient to obtain adequate hemodynamic parameters. Initially, filling pressures are increased by transfusing volume from the pump. After protamine administration, the blood remaining in the pump circuit is processed through the cell‐saving device into bags and reinfused by the anesthesiologist into the patient. If this is not immediately available, a colloid is often chosen to maintain intravascular volume. Albumin is preferable to hetastarch compounds, which have been shown to increase bleeding and transfusion requirements.165,166 Even the rapidly degradable low‐molecular‐weight hetastarch compounds have been shown to impair fibrin formation and clot strength and should be avoided.
- **G.** If hemodynamic performance is not ideal, the anesthesiologist must work with the surgeon in assessing myocardial function and the need for inotropes. Visual inspection of the heart, assessment of serial cardiac outputs and filling pressures with a Swan‐Ganz catheter, and TEE imaging can be used to assess ventricular function and identify potential problems.
  - **1.** Inotropic support is usually initiated with a catecholamine, such as epinephrine (1–2 μg/min) or dobutamine (5–10 μg/kg/min). If cardiac performance remains unsatisfactory, milrinone is extremely helpful in unloading the heart and providing inotropic support. Its preemptive use just prior to terminating bypass has been suggested as a means of ameliorating postoperative deterioration in cardiac performance and oxygen transport, and for reducing the need for catecholamine support.167
  - **2.** If the patient has a satisfactory cardiac output and good ventricular function on TEE, but has persistent hypotension ("vasoplegic" state), increasing doses of norepinephrine or phenylephrine are indicated. If the patient remains refractory to these medications, a bolus of 1 unit of vasopressin may be sufficient to "turn the corner". It may be necessary to continue vasopressin as an infusion of 0.01– 0.1 units/min to maintain vascular tone. If the patient remains hypotensive, methylene blue 1.5–2 mg/kg is recommended.168,169
  - **3.** If the patient has persistent hypotension or a low cardiac output state for more than a minute or so, reinstitution of CPB to reperfuse the heart at a low workload will frequently result in improved ventricular function. This will also allow time to sort out the nature of the problem. In most situations, time and patience are all that is required to allow the heart to recover on bypass as additional

inotropic support is initiated. Remediable problems that might be encountered include:

- **a.** Air embolism down the right coronary artery, which may cause RV dysfunction and hypotension, necessitating a brief period of resumption of bypass to resolve. This is not an uncommon phenomenon after mitral valve surgery.
- **b.** A new RWM abnormality, which may suggest a technical problem with graft flow (kinking, twisting, anastomotic problem) that can be remedied. In mitral valve surgery, it might suggest circumflex artery entrapment if associated with lateral ECG changes. After aortic valve surgery or aortic root procedures, it might suggest impairment of coronary ostial flow by the valve prosthesis or kinking of the proximal coronary artery after coronary button reimplantation, respectively.
- **c.** A paravalvular leak, unexplained transvalvular leak, or impairment in mechanical valve leaflet motion that may require additional surgery.
- **4.** If the heart still does not function well after being rested on bypass or after use of multiple pharmacologic agents, insertion of an IABP is usually necessary. When all of the above fail, consideration should be given to the use of an ECMO or a circulatory assist device in appropriate candidates (see pages 555–574).
- **H. Reversal of anticoagulation.** Protamine is a polycationic peptide administered to counteract the effects of heparin and is usually given in a 0.5:1 to 1:1 mg/mg ratio to the dose of heparin to return the ACT to baseline. The ACT may remain elevated from residual heparin effect, for which small additional doses of protamine may be given. This is helpful if the patient is transfused with several bags of cell‐ saver blood, which does contain a small amount of heparin. However, the ACT may also be elevated in patients with significant thrombocytopenia or a coagulopathy despite complete neutralization of heparin. Thus, additional protamine administered for an elevated ACT may not return it to baseline. Although moderate thrombocytopenia has not been shown to increase the ACT in patients with normally functioning platelets, it may increase it when associated with platelet dysfunction after bypass.170
  - **1.** The systems that perform heparin–protamine titration tests measure heparin levels in the bloodstream and determine the appropriate dose of protamine necessary to neutralize the remaining heparin. This usually results in less protamine being administered than empiric dosing based on the heparin dose. This may restore platelet responsiveness to thrombin and attenuate platelet α‐granule secretion, resulting in less bleeding.171 Thus, these systems should prevent the unnecessary administration of protamine to correct an abnormal ACT that is not attributable to excessive heparin. In fact, additional protamine, even just exceeding a 1:1 reversal ratio, may activate platelets and elevate the ACT, thus serving as an anticoagulant that may cause more bleeding!172,173
  - **2.** "Heparin rebound" may occur when heparin reappears in the bloodstream after protamine neutralization. This is more likely to occur in patients who have received large doses of heparin during bypass and is more common in obese patients. This may occur because the half‐life of protamine is only about 5 minutes and it has nearly completely disappeared from the bloodstream within 20 minutes.174 A normal ACT may be noted despite residual heparin activity,

- although the Medtronic HMS system and thromboelastography can assess whether there is still some circulating heparin.175 If there is residual heparin or a heparin "rebound", it can be reversed with additional doses of protamine.176
- **3.** IV administration of protamine may cause histamine release from the lungs, contributing to a decrease in systemic resistance and blood pressure, an effect not seen with intra‐arterial injection. Nonetheless, evidence supporting any hemodynamic advantage to intra‐arterial vs IV administration is controversial.177,178
- **I. Protamine reactions** are unusual and often unpredictable, although they have been noted with greater frequency in patients taking NPH insulin, those with fish (not shellfish) or medication allergies, those with prior protamine exposure, and men who have had vasectomies. Awareness of the possibility of a protamine reaction, with a prompt therapeutic response if it occurs, is essential because protamine reactions are associated with increased perioperative mortality.179–182
  - **1. Type I.** Systemic hypotension from rapid administration (entire neutralizing dose after CPB given within three minutes). This is caused by a histamine‐ related reduction in systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance. It can be avoided by infusing the protamine over a 10‐ to 15‐minute period and should be reversible with α‐agent support.
  - **2. Type II.** Anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reaction resulting in hypotension, tachycardia, bronchospasm, flushing, and pulmonary edema.
    - **a.** IIA. Idiosyncratic IgE‐ or IgG‐mediated anaphylactic reaction. Release of histamine, leukotrienes, and kinins produces a systemic capillary leak causing hypotension and pulmonary edema. This tends to occur within the first 10 minutes of administration.
    - **b.** IIB. Immediate nonimmunologic anaphylactoid reaction
    - **c.** IIC. Delayed reactions, usually occurring 20 minutes or more after the protamine infusion has been started, probably related to complement activation and leukotriene release, producing wheezing, hypovolemia, and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema from a pulmonary capillary leak.
  - **3. Type III.** Catastrophic pulmonary vasoconstriction (CPV) manifested by elevated PA pressures, systemic hypotension from peripheral vasodilation, decreased left atrial pressures, RV dilatation, and myocardial depression. This reaction tends to occur about 10–20 minutes after the protamine infusion has started. One proposed mechanism involves activation of complement by the heparin– protamine complex that triggers leukocyte aggregation and release of liposomal enzymes that damage pulmonary tissue leading to pulmonary edema. Activation of the arachidonic acid pathway produces thromboxane, which constricts the pulmonary vessels. Pulmonary vasoconstriction usually abates after about 10 minutes.182
  - **4.** Prevention of protamine reactions is usually not possible. Skin testing has not proved of any value. In patients considered at high risk, type II reactions might be attenuated by the prophylactic use of histamine blockers (ranitidine 150 mg IV, diphenhydramine 50 mg IV) and steroids (hydrocortisone 100 mg IV). This common practice has not been shown clinically to be of much benefit.

- **5.** Treatment of protamine reactions involves correction of any hemodynamic abnormalities that are identified. They must be differentiated from other conditions that can cause hemodynamic deterioration, such as hypoperfusion, air embolism, poor myocardial protection, or valve dysfunction. Measures must be taken to support the systemic blood pressure while reversing pulmonary vasoconstriction if also present. Preparations to reinstitute CPB are frequently necessary. The following options may be effective:
  - **a.** Calcium chloride 500 mg IV to increase systemic resistance and provide some inotropic support
  - **b.** α‐agents (phenylephrine, norepinephrine, vasopressin) to support systemic resistance
  - **c.** β‐agents for inotropic support that can also reduce pulmonary resistance (low‐dose epinephrine, dobutamine, milrinone)
  - **d.** Readily available drugs to reduce preload and pulmonary pressures (nitroglycerin)
  - **e.** Aminophylline for wheezing
  - **f.** Re‐administration of heparin to reverse the protamine reaction by reducing heparin–protamine complex size
  - **g.** Steroids (hydrocortisone 100 mg IV)
  - **h.** Methylene blue might be beneficial because of the possible involvement of nitric oxide in the pathogenesis of CPV.182
- **J. Alternatives to reverse anticoagulation.** Although simply not reversing heparin and administering clotting factors may suffice in ameliorating the bleeding caused by residual heparin when protamine cannot be used, other measures have been evaluated to reverse heparin effect. These include use of heparinase I, recombinant PF4, and heparin removal devices.183–186 Interestingly, PF4 has been shown to reverse the effects of LMWH, which is incompletely accomplished by protamine.187
- **K. Treatment of coagulopathy.** Cessation of antiplatelet medications (except low‐ dose aspirin) and other anticoagulants, performing a meticulous operation, and the routine use of antifibrinolytic drugs should result in minimal postoperative bleeding in most patients undergoing cardiac surgery. However, a coagulopathy of varying degrees is probably present in all patients after CPB. Generally, the longer the duration of CPB, the more profound the degree of systemic hypothermia, and the more blood transfusions required on pump, the greater the coagulopathy.
  - **1.** Most groups treat coagulopathies in the OR by the "shotgun approach". This entails the empiric administration of small additional doses of protamine for an elevated ACT, and the transfusion of platelets, fresh frozen plasma, and/or cryoprecipitate for suspected coagulopathic bleeding. It is best to prioritize these products based on suspicion of the hemostatic defect while awaiting the results of coagulation studies. For example, platelet transfusions should be given first to patients on aspirin or with recent use of P2Y12 inhibitors (clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or prasugrel) or with uremia; fresh frozen plasma should be considered first for patients on preoperative warfarin, with hepatic dysfunction, or when multiple transfusions are given on pump; and uremic patients might benefit from desmopressin (see page 439). Cryoprecipitate is helpful in improving platelet

- function, especially when the fibrinogen level is low. Alternative products include prothrombin complex concentrate and fibrinogen concentrates (see pages 444–445). Recombinant factor VIIa is particularly effective in achieving hemostasis when the coagulopathy is severe, although it may be associated with thrombotic complications.188,189
- **2.** Although this particular approach will usually stem the "coagulopathic tide", it is more scientific and cost‐effective to use point‐of‐care testing to assess the specific hemostatic defect and direct care accordingly.113 Systems are available to measure the PT, PTT, and platelet count, and several are capable of measuring platelet function as well. Rotational thromboelastometry and thromboelastography are valuable tests that evaluate the entire clotting process and are very effective in identifying the exact hemostatic defect in the bleeding patient that needs to be addressed (see Figure 9.1).190–192 However, their routine use in cardiac surgery may not be justifiable.
- **3.** Further comments on the prevention, assessment, and management of mediastinal bleeding can be found in Chapter 9.

### **IX. Anesthetic Considerations During Off‐pump Coronary Surgery193**

#### **A. Monitoring considerations**

- **1.** In contrast to on‐pump surgery, off‐pump surgery via a median sternotomy requires that the heart provide adequate systemic perfusion at all times. Hemodynamics may be compromised by positioning of the heart, myocardial ischemia, ventricular arrhythmias, bleeding, and valvular regurgitation (Table 4.7).
- **2.** To assess for myocardial ischemia and dysfunction when the heart is positioned at unorthodox angles, more intensive monitoring is required than for on‐pump surgery. Swan‐Ganz catheters that provide in‐line continuous cardiac outputs and mixed venous oxygen saturations are very beneficial. These will dictate whether volume infusion or pharmacologic management is indicated. Pulse contour analysis using the Vigileo/FloTrac or other available systems attached to the radial

#### **Table 4.7 • Key Elements of Anesthetic Management of Off‐Pump Surgery**

- 1. Continuous cardiac output and mixed venous oxygen monitoring
- 2. Transesophageal echocardiography
- 3. Antifibrinolytic drugs
- 4. Low‐level heparinization with ACT >250 seconds
- 5. Short‐acting anesthetic agents
- 6. Maintenance of systemic normothermia with use of warming devices
- 7. Arrhythmia prophylaxis with lidocaine and magnesium
- 8. Availability of pacing capability
- 9. Maintenance of hemodynamics with fluid, α‐agents, and inotropes
- 10. Patience and emotional support for the surgeon!

- artery catheter can also provide accurate cardiac output measurements during heart displacement when TEE imaging may be suboptimal.194 Simply maintaining an adequate blood pressure and heart rate pharmacologically may not suffice and often will provide no premonitory indication that the heart is becoming ischemic and subject to precipitous deterioration into ventricular fibrillation.
- **3.** TEE is helpful in assessing for the development of RWM abnormalities during construction of an anastomosis that may be indicative of acute ischemia.39 The anesthesiologist should be well trained in TEE and must immediately communicate any problem to the surgeon. Steps can then be taken to resolve the problem, often with the placement of a shunt to improve flow.195 During vessel occlusion, TEE should assess for the acute development of regional LV dysfunction or acute MR during construction of left‐sided grafts and for RV or inferior wall dysfunction during right‐sided grafting. If RWM abnormalities persist after the graft is completed, a technical problem with the anastomosis should be suspected. The ME windows are best for assessing RV and LV function. The TG views are not helpful when the heart is elevated out of the chest. TEE will lead to modifications of the surgical strategy in a significant number of patients.196
- **B. Anesthetic agents** are similar to those used for on‐pump surgery, although shorter‐ acting medications may be selected, depending on plans for extubation. Although patients can be extubated in the OR, a more common practice is to use propofol for sedation at the end of surgery and for several hours in the ICU before considering extubation.
- **C. Heparinization** is essential during off‐pump surgery during vessel occlusion, and the extrinsic coagulation system is still activated by release of tissue factor. Usually about 2–2.5 mg/kg of heparin suffices to raise the ACT to >250 seconds, with some patient variability. There have been concerns about the prothrombotic tendency noted after OPCAB, since the hemodilution, platelet dysfunction, and fibrinolysis associated with CPB may not be seen.197,198 This prothrombotic tendency may be related to the procoagulant activity of platelets or to the activation of fibrinogen and other acute‐phase reactants that result from the surgery. However, this recommended dose of heparin is not associated with significant thrombin generation, activation of the coagulation system, or fibrinolysis, and it has not been associated with graft closure problems.116,117
- **D. Antifibrinolytic therapy** with TXA has been to shown to minimize bleeding in OPCAB surgery.103 Although the blood is not subject to contact activation in an extracorporeal circuit, heparinization does induce fibrinolysis, and antifibrinolytic agents may be beneficial without causing a hypercoagulable state. ε‐aminocaproic acid (Amicar) can also be used with the same anticipated benefit.
- **E. Patient temperature** tends to drift during open‐chest procedures, but it should be maintained as close to normothermia as possible to prevent arrhythmias, bleeding, and subsequent shivering in the ICU. The ambient room temperature must be raised into the low‐70s Fahrenheit and some form of warming blanket should be considered. These include a sterile Bair Hugger (3M Company) and heat‐emitting devices, such as the Kimberly‐Clark temperature management system.199 The endovascular Thermogard system (Zoll Medical Corporation) has also been used effectively in optimizing intraoperative temperature control during OPCAB.200All fluids must be warmed as they are being administered.201

- **F. Maintenance of hemodynamics.** During cardiac positioning, the patient is placed in the Trendelenburg position and the OR table is rotated to the right. Deep pericardial sutures are placed to aid with retraction. Apical suction devices can also be used to rotate the heart cephalad and to the right. Central venous and PA pressures increase in the head‐down position, and care must be taken not to administer too much fluid and increase these pressures even further. Transducer location may need to be adjusted to ensure accuracy. The possibility of producing cerebral edema should be kept in mind.
  - **1.** Magnesium and lidocaine should be given to increase the arrhythmic threshold.
  - **2.** Blood pressure should be maintained in the 120–140 mm Hg systolic range to optimize coronary perfusion, especially via collateral flow. This can be done with some fluid administration, but usually with liberal administration of α‐agents.
  - **3.** Atrial pacing wires may be placed if there is a concern about bradycardia developing with heart positioning. Transesophageal pacing may be utilized. Induced bradycardia is not essential when using current stabilizing devices. However, tachycardia should be controlled. Ventricular pacing cables should be immediately available in case heart block develops. Coronary shunting may be helpful during bypass of the right coronary artery, during which there may be compromise of flow to the AV node, producing heart block.
  - **4.** Detection of ischemia can be difficult, since the ECG and TEE can be difficult to interpret in the translocated heart. A reduction in the SvO2 is one of the first signs of the struggling heart. Intracoronary shunting or aortocoronary shunting during construction of an anastomosis ameliorates distal ischemia. Upon the first suspicion of ventricular dysfunction, the surgeon should be informed immediately so that a shunt may be placed, if not done so prophylactically, to try to minimize ischemia.
  - **5.** If inotropic support is required, low‐dose epinephrine is given first, and then milrinone may be given if more support is needed. In high‐risk cases, such as severe left main disease, a prophylactic IABP may be helpful. Unless there is a strong indication for OPCAB, such as severe comorbidities, immediate conversion to an on‐pump procedure may be a wise decision if instability persists.
- **G. Blood loss** can be insidious during OPCAB if proximal and distal vessel control is suboptimal, especially if the proximal vessel does not have a critical stenosis. Blood should be scavenged into a cell saver and retransfused to the patient. Not infrequently, a significant amount of blood drains into the left pleural space that can be aspirated, processed with the cell saver, and transfused.
- **H. Proximal anastomoses** are usually performed last. During construction of proximal anastomoses with a sideclamp, the systolic blood pressure should be reduced to 90–100 mm Hg systolic to reduce the risk of aortic injury and atheroembolism. However, induced hypotension may increase the risk of renal dysfunction, and distal coronary perfusion through vein grafts is compromised until all grafts are sewn to the aorta and the clamp is removed. Thus, the patient may become unstable at this time. Induced hypotension is not necessary if an aortic sealing device, such as the Heartstring proximal seal system (MAQUET Cardiovascular), is used during the construction of proximal anastomoses.
- **I.** Protamine is given in a 1:1 ratio to heparin. Bleeding should be minimal if the anastomoses are hemostatic. Pacing wires may be placed on the atrium and ventricle, chest tubes are placed, and the chest is closed.

### **X. Anesthetic Considerations During Minimally Invasive or Robotic CABG and Mitral Valve Surgery202,203**

#### **A. General comments**

- **1.** Appropriate draping is essential in case an emergency conversion to a median sternotomy incision is required. Positioning of anesthesia and TEE equipment must be well planned in order to optimize access to the patient in robotic cases. Body warmers are useful in off‐pump procedures. External defibrillator pads must be placed in appropriate positions to avoid being near the operative field.
- **2.** Intubation for one‐lung anesthesia is required to improve surgical exposure with small thoracotomy incisions or multiple robotic ports, but it can compromise pulmonary function in patients with advanced lung disease. Hypoxemia may induce hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. One‐lung anesthesia is accomplished with either a double‐lumen endotracheal tube or a single‐lumen endotracheal tube with a bronchial blocker. Prior to going on CPB, hypoxemia can be managed by the addition of PEEP to the ventilated lung, although this may shunt blood to the nonventilated lung and worsen oxygenation. Applying CPAP to the nonventilated lung can also improve oxygenation, but this may be bothersome to the surgeon. A few moments of two‐lung ventilation can usually deal with these issues. It has been noted that oxygenation tends to be worse after CPB than it was before in these cases.203
- **3.** For robotic cases, CO2 is inflated into the chest to improve exposure and will reduce the amount of intracardiac air at the conclusion of CPB. As long as the intrapleural pressure remains <10 mm Hg with an insufflation rate of 2–3 L/min, a tension capnothorax should not occur. If it does, it can produce hypotension due to mediastinal shift, decreased venous return, and RV compression.
- **4.** Because these operations are less invasive, anesthetic agents should be selected to allow for early extubation, with the use of lower doses of narcotics. This requires the provision of additional analgesia because of the pain associated with lateral chest incisions. For thoracotomy approaches, intercostal blocks at the conclusion of surgery are beneficial. For robotic procedures, paravertebral nerve blocks are helpful in reducing postoperative pain. If the patient is not extubated in the OR and it is anticipated that mechanical ventilatory support will be necessary for more than an hour or so in the ICU, the endotracheal tube will need to be exchanged for a single‐lumen tube prior to transfer to the ICU.
- **5.** On‐pump procedures require femoral arterial and venous cannulation for CPB. TEE is essential to assist in the positioning of catheters, since limited exposure prevents the surgeon from palpating their location. Although antegrade cardioplegia can be administered with thoracotomy and robotic approaches, the anesthesiologist may be asked to place a retrograde cardioplegia catheter into the coronary sinus, a 15–18 Fr venous drainage catheter into the IJ vein, and/or a pulmonary "endovent" via the IJ vein. Their positions are monitored by TEE. Although direct clamping of the aorta is feasible in most cases, an "endoballoon" may be used for aortic occlusion. This requires placement of bilateral radial artery catheters (or contralateral radial and femoral lines if axillary cannulation is used) to monitor pressures during balloon inflation to identify distal migration. In addition, TEE can identify the distal and proximal locations of the inflated endoballoon, to avoid

- obstruction of the innominate artery distally and the coronary arteries proximally. TEE can identify aortic dissections and SVC injury from cannula placement.
- **6.** Cerebral oximetry should be used to assess cerebral perfusion, since perfusion from the heart–lung machine is retrograde from the femoral arteries. It is also helpful during endoballoon inflation, because a reduction in regional oxygen saturation (rSO2 ) on either side of the forehead may reflect compromise of flow into the ipsilateral brachiocephalic vessel. In the unusual case of an aberrant right subclavian artery, cerebral oximetry may show a reduction in cerebral oxygenation despite a normal right radial pressure.204
- **7.** If femoral arterial cannulation is used for a prolonged period of time, ischemia/ reperfusion injury to the leg may result, potentially causing a compartment syndrome of the lower extremity. The risk of leg ischemia is greater in larger patients, with use of large cannulas, and with longer operating times.205 The anesthesiologist should remind the surgeon to evaluate the patient's calves at the conclusion of surgery for tenseness. Although edema is common after a long case, there should be a low threshold for measuring compartment pressures if the leg has been ischemic for over 4–6 hours. If significantly elevated, a fasciotomy should be considered to prevent muscle necrosis.
- **B. Endoscopic or robotic CABG** through limited thoracotomy incisions are less extensive procedures than those performed through sternotomy incisions and do not result in much cardiac manipulation. Robotic surgery performed through small ports can be used for ITA takedown as well as for construction of coronary anastomoses, which may be performed with clips or distal anastomotic connector devices. However, despite endoscopic/robotic ITA takedown, many surgeons will hand‐sew anastomoses through small thoracotomy incisions. Procedures may be done on‐ or off‐pump.
  - **1.** The patient is positioned with the left side slightly elevated. The left arm may be abducted to improve exposure, but excessive abduction can cause brachial plexus stretch. The limited exposure to the heart and avoidance of CPB for off‐pump procedures mandate adequate monitoring for ischemia, comparable to that noted for OPCABs.
  - **2.** For robotic cases, the lateral ECG leads must be placed posteriorly and laterally to avoid the port access sites. Defibrillator pads must be placed out of the way of the ports as well, which may produce a suboptimal axis for defibrillation in the event of ventricular fibrillation.
  - **3.** For off‐pump procedures, a single radial arterial line is placed for monitoring. If the procedure will be done on CPB using cardioplegic arrest, two arterial lines should be placed if an endoballoon is used for aortic cross‐clamping. TEE is helpful in off‐pump procedures by identifying RWM abnormalities during construction of anastomoses or afterwards.
  - **4.** Pacing capabilities using Swan‐Ganz pacing catheters may be beneficial.
- **C. Minimally invasive mitral valve procedures** may be performed through lower sternotomy incisions, but are usually performed under direct vision through a limited right thoracotomy incision or robotically using small ports.203
  - **1.** The patient is positioned with the right side elevated about 15°. Defibrillator pads are placed with one pad on the patient's back to the left of the spine and the other

near the apex of the heart in the anterior axillary line. A left radial artery line is placed with consideration of another radial line (or femoral line in case of axillary cannulation) if a balloon endoclamp will be used. For most cases, antegrade cardioplegia administration and direct aortic clamping with a "Chitwood" clamp are feasible. This is usually placed through a separate stab wound on the chest wall. A supplemental retrograde cardioplegia catheter may be placed by the anesthesiologist via the right IJ vein. An additional 15–18 Fr catheter placed in the right IJ is beneficial to augment venous return, and drainage may be vacuum‐assisted. It is critical to pay attention to clamping and unclamping of the IJ catheter to prevent inadvertent (and potentially exsanguinating) drainage when the patient is not on bypass. A pulmonary endovent is rarely necessary.

- **2.** One‐lung anesthesia, femoral cannulation, and possible use of a Swan‐Ganz Paceport catheter are as described in section X.A. TEE is essential in identifying mitral valve pathology, the location of guidewires (arterial and venous) prior to cannulation, and the positions of the femoral venous cannula (which should be about 5 cm into the SVC to prevent dislodgment), the IJ venous cannula, the aortic endoballoon (which should be about 2 cm above the aortic root), and the coronary sinus catheter. It may also detect other previously unsuspected pathology that could impact the operative procedure (more than mild AR, atrial septal defect). During aortic clamping, TEE can visualize flow of antegrade cardioplegia into the coronary arteries, potential AR, and LV distention that the surgeon is unable to see. It may also visualize retrograde cardioplegia flow into the coronary sinus.
- **3.** During weaning from bypass, the antegrade cardioplegia catheter is attached to suction and used for venting of air. TEE is **essential** in identifying air during weaning from CPB, as the amount of air in the LV can be quite striking in these cases. If the mitral valve repair is satisfactory, bypass is briefly resumed to allow for the removal of the vent line under lower pressure, and then the patient is weaned off bypass.
- **4.** Special considerations in robotic mitral valve surgery
  - **a.** Robotic procedures are not pain‐free. Use of standard opiate‐based anesthesia may be considered, but the narcotic requirement may be lessened using alternative methods to provide analgesia and expedite extubation. Paravertebral nerve blocks at three sites are very useful in accomplishing this. Other approaches include intrathecal or thoracic epidural opiates, intercostal nerve blocks, or pectoral blocks. Local infiltration of long‐acting, liposomal bupivacaine has also been described.203
  - **b.** The endotracheal tube must be well secured because access to the patient's airway can be difficult with use of the robot.
  - **c.** Muscle relaxation is essential to prevent patient movement during use of the robotic arms that could damage the heart.
  - **d.** Defibrillation may be impaired by the presence of a capnothorax. Establishing two‐lung ventilation to reduce electrical impedance and using biphasic defibrillation at 150–200 joules will usually suffice to ensure defibrillation.
  - **e.** The importance of TEE in these procedures cannot be overemphasized.

## **XI. Anesthetic Considerations During Minimally Invasive Aortic Valve Surgery206**

- **A.** Minimally invasive AVR through an upper sternotomy incision leaves the lower sternum intact and may improve postoperative pulmonary function after surgery. This approach allows for the direct cannulation of the aorta with venous drainage either from the right atrium or from the right femoral vein, guided by TEE visualization of the cannula. It is usually possible for the surgeon to place a vent through the right superior pulmonary vein and a cardioplegia catheter into the coronary sinus, although its position will need to be confirmed by TEE. Deairing is more problematic than with a full exposure sternotomy, so use of CO2 insufflation is helpful, and TEE monitoring for evacuation of air prior to terminating bypass is essential. Otherwise, the anesthesia for this procedure is similar to that of a full sternotomy.
- **B.** The upper thoracotomy approach through the right second or third intercostal space limits access to the heart. Some surgeons prefer femoral arterial and venous cannulation, but others have used central aortic and right atrial cannulation successfully. The surgeon can place the vent through the right superior pulmonary vein and often the retrograde cardioplegia catheter as well, but it may be necessary for the anesthesiologist to insert that through the IJ vein. The surgeon can place an antegrade catheter and will directly clamp the aorta. Because of limited access to the LV, deairing is an issue requiring careful TEE monitoring during weaning from bypass. This procedure is more technically challenging with less exposure and usually has a longer pump run than a standard approach.

## **XII. Anesthetic Considerations During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR)**

- **A.** TAVR for calcific AS is preferentially performed through a percutaneous transfemoral approach using sedation. General anesthesia is only indicated if the patient has ventilatory issues lying flat, whether from advanced heart failure, COPD, or sleep apnea. Sedation with dexmedetomidine (1 μg/kg over 10 minutes followed by 0.2–1 μg/kg/h) with supplemental 2% lidocaine in the groins allows the patient to tolerate the procedure well. Occasionally at the time of rapid ventricular pacing and valve deployment (for Edwards valves), a small dose of propofol (10–20 mg) or fentanyl (25–50 μg) may be given.
- **B. Monitoring.** With use of sedation rather than general anesthesia, no monitoring lines need to be placed by the anesthesiologist, unless the patient has markedly impaired LV function or is in profound heart failure. Rarely is it necessary to place a Swan‐Ganz catheter. Arterial monitoring can be done through a femoral access site (usually using the side port of a 7 Fr sheath through which the pigtail catheter is placed), obviating the need for a radial artery line. One of the femoral venous sheaths (through which a transvenous pacing wire is placed) can be used for additional venous access. Proper placement of defibrillator pads is essential in the event of ventricular fibrillation. These need to be far enough to the right on the anterior chest wall to avoid interference with a potential sternotomy incision and far enough away from the LV apex to allow for transthoracic apical echo imaging to assess the gradient post deployment. On rare occasions, assessment of annular size is inadequate from preoperative studies and a TEE may need to be performed, but this can be accomplished without general anesthesia.

- **C. Hemodynamic stability.** Hypertension is common in these patients and is best controlled with clevidipine. For balloon‐deployed valves (Edwards SAPIEN series), hemodynamic instability most commonly occurs following a period of rapid ventricular pacing, whether for balloon valvuloplasty or valve deployment. Obstruction of the native valve by the undeployed transcatheter heart valve or production of significant AR can cause hypotension. Refractory hemodynamic instability at any point in the procedure may occur in patients with markedly impaired LV function, and can be managed by an IABP and rarely by the establishment of CPB via the femoral vessels. The blood pressure should be maintained above 100 mm Hg prior to valve deployment. Rapid ventricular pacing is initiated, and ventilation is held if performed under general anesthesia. The blood pressure should not be allowed to overshoot too much after valve deployment, although that is a fairly common phenomenon if phenylephrine or norepinephrine was given for hypotension prior to valve deployment.
- **D.** For self‐expanding valves (the Medtronic CoreValve/Evolut series), ventricular pacing at a rate of around 100–110/min is usually used as the valve is being unsheathed, and the valve is repeatedly checked for its position relative to the native annulus. There is a brief period of compromised blood pressure during mid‐deployment which then recovers just prior to reaching the "point of no return" at 80% unsheathing. If the valve remains in a good position, it is completely unsheathed.
- **E. Echocardiography.** Following valve deployment, a transthoracic echo is performed to assess for paravalvular leaks in the LAX and SAX views, and the transvalvular gradient is measured in the apical four‐chamber view. Persistent hemodynamic instability may indicate coronary ostial obstruction, ischemia with significant coronary disease, cardiac tamponade, aortic annular disruption, aortic dissection, or valve malposition. Virtually all of these can be identified by a root angiogram and echocardiogram.
- **F.** Following the procedure, the dexmedetomidine is stopped and the patient can be transferred to a routine recovery area. Occasionally, especially in patients with an underlying right bundle branch block and first degree block, complete heart block will develop and persist, and the transvenous pacing wire placed during the procedure will need to be retained. The wire should also be left in for marked bradycardia and for some patients with a new LBBB (see pages 390 and 615).
- **G.** In patients with extensive iliofemoral disease that precludes transfemoral access, alternatives include transcaval, transaxillary, transcarotid, upper sternotomy, and transapical approaches, all of which are usually performed under general anesthesia.207–209
- **H.** In patients undergoing a valve‐in‐valve procedure, the preliminary CT scan is critical in assessing whether displacement of the prosthetic valve leaflet may obstruct the coronary ostia. If that is the case, a BASILICA procedure (Bioprosthetic Aortic Scallop Intentional Laceration to prevent Iatrogenic Coronary Artery obstruction) can be performed.210

#### **XIII. Anesthetic Considerations During Transcatheter Mitral Valve Procedures211**

**A.** The mitral valve apparatus is a complex structure which has made percutaneous approaches more challenging. Devices producing leaflet repairs, such as the MitraClip system, are performed through a transseptal approach, whereas chordal repairs are performed through a transapical approach. Annuloplasty devices are also being investigated. A transcatheter MVR (TMVR) using a transcatheter aortic valve has primarily been used as a "valve‐in‐valve" and sometimes a "valve‐in‐ring" procedure to address bioprosthetic valve stenosis/regurgitation or a failed repair. "Valve‐in‐MAC" (mitral annular calcification) procedures have also been performed, with suboptimal results.212 Several other valves are being evaluated for MVRs in high‐risk patients.

- **B. Percutaneous mitral valve repair with the MitraClip system** can be considered in very high‐risk surgical patients with degenerative and functional MR. It reapproximates the anterior and posterior leaflets in the same plane, and is effective in reducing, but rarely eliminating MR.
  - **1.** The procedure is done under general anesthesia with TEE guidance. Femoral venous access with transseptal puncture is used. A Swan‐Ganz catheter may be helpful in assessing right‐heart pressures, but it is not essential. A radial arterial line is helpful.
  - **2.** Standard TEE images used for transseptal puncture include the bicaval and SAX at the base views for anterior–posterior positioning and the four‐chamber view for the height of the puncture site relative to the mitral valve coaption plane. After this has been accomplished, the patient is systemically heparinized to reach an ACT >300 seconds. Positioning of a ProTrack stiff pigtail wire (Baylis Medical) in the left atrium is confirmed by TEE. Once the steerable guide catheter has been positioned in the left atrium and the wire is removed, the left atrial "v" wave may be measured directly (see Figure 2.5, page 137).
  - **3.** The clip delivery system is then advanced into the left atrium. TEE imaging is critical to make sure the device clears the pulmonary veins and left atrial appendage as it is manipulated down to the mitral valve. Initial clip orientation is confirmed in the 3D en face view, then the clip arms are closed to 60° and the system is advanced into the LV. Using the mitral commissural view for medial–lateral orientation, the LVOT view for anterior–posterior orientation, and the 3D en face view, the clip is placed in the desired position. After the clip is closed, the quality of leaflet grasp, the degree of residual MR, and the degree of MS are assessed. If the mean gradient is <5 mm Hg, it is feasible to apply a second clip to improve the degree of regurgitation. A subsequent measurement of the left atrial "v" wave after removal of the clip delivery system gives an appreciation of the hemodynamic improvement from the clip application.
  - **4.** When the guide catheter is pulled back into the right atrium, the size of the residual atrial septal defect and the degree of shunting are evaluated by TEE. If the latter appears to be significant or there is evidence of hypoxemia from right‐ to‐left shunting, a septal occluder may be placed. The pericardium should be checked for the presence of an effusion.
  - **5.** Complications are uncommon with careful technique in wire and catheter placement and continuous visualization on TEE. This should prevent left atrial perforation and hemopericardium. The clip can get trapped in the subvalvular apparatus and can cause chordal rupture, worsening the MR. There appears to be less compromise of LV function with the reestablishment of valve competence than noted with surgical mitral valve repairs, so use of inotropic support is

unusual, even with markedly impaired LV function. Patients can usually be extubated at the conclusion of the procedure.

#### **C. Percutaneous mitral "valve‐in‐valve" and "valve‐in‐ring" procedures**

- **1.** These procedures require careful planning to select the proper size valve and to ensure that valve placement will not produce LV outflow tract obstruction. A radial arterial line should be placed, but a Swan‐Ganz catheter is not necessary. Defibrillators pads are essential.
- **2.** A transseptal or transapical approach via a small thoracotomy incision have been used for these procedures. General anesthesia with TEE and fluoroscopic guidance is utilized. The transseptal approach is similar to the MitraClip approach, using femoral venous access. However, these procedures usually require a balloon septostomy with a 12–14 Fr balloon to position an 8.5 Fr sheath across the septum through which a Safari (Boston Scientific) or Confida (Medtronic) extra stiff wire is passed into the LV. A transvenous pacing wire is passed from the contralateral femoral vein up to the RV apex for pacing during valve deployment. The transcatheter valve is then advanced over the wire and positioned in an appropriate position relative to each type of tissue valve using fluoroscopy. The valve is then deployed during a period of rapid ventricular pacing.
- **3.** Potential complications of these procedures include arrhythmias, hemopericardium, cardiac tamponade, and device embolization. With a TMVR, a paravalvular leak or LVOT obstruction may occur. The latter may result from displacement of the anterior mitral leaflet of a native valve or tissue prosthetic valve leaflet into the outflow tract. Preoperative assessment of the "neo‐LVOT" may dictate whether this may occur, and a LAMPOON procedure (intentional Laceration of the Anterior Mitral leaflet to Prevent left ventricular Outflow tract ObstructioN) may need to be performed in patients at risk.213,214
- **D.** The **transapical approach** is used for chordal procedures and has been used for TMVR in the native annulus and with severe mitral annular calcification.215 The Neochord device anchors a suture in the papillary muscle and then anchors the suture to the edge of the prolapsed leaflet segment. This is done primarily under TEE guidance.216
  - **1.** Large‐bore IV access is essential because there is a greater likelihood of bleeding from the apical puncture site. A central venous line is also helpful for volume infusions, but a Swan‐Ganz catheter may only be useful in patients with significant LV dysfunction. Defibrillator pads must be well positioned because arrhythmias may be triggered by cardiac manipulation, and the limited thoracotomy incision does not allow for internal defibrillation. One‐lung anesthesia is not necessary. The blood pressure should be kept around 100 during apical access and decannulation. Lidocaine may be given to reduce ventricular irritability. Heparin is administered just prior to apical access.
  - **2.** The most significant complications of any transapical procedure are malignant ventricular arrhythmias and hemorrhage from the cannulation site. Adequate pursestring or mattress suture placement prior to apical access and tying down of the sutures with the blood pressure lowered are important. Thoracotomy incisions are painful, so use of thoracic epidural analgesia or paravertebral blockade may reduce the intraoperative and postoperative opioid requirement.
