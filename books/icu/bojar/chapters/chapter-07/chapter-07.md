### **7** Admission to the ICU and Monitoring Techniques

#### **I. Admission to the ICU**

- **A.** The first critical phase of postoperative care begins at the completion of the surgical procedure. During transfer from the operating room table to an intensive care unit (ICU) bed, from one monitoring system to another, and from the operating room to the ICU, the potential exists for airway and ventilation problems, sudden hypotension or hypertension, arrhythmias, increased mediastinal bleeding, inadvertent medication changes, and problems with invasive catheters and monitoring.
  - **1.** The electrocardiogram (ECG), arterial pressure tracing, and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2 ) are transduced on the transport monitor, after which the patient is transferred to the ICU bed. During this transfer, the anesthesia team should coordinate all movements, paying particular attention to the airway, with hand ventilation provided by an Ambu bag connected to a portable oxygen tank. The entire team should also pay attention to invasive lines, the pacing wires, urinary catheter, and chest tubes to make sure nothing becomes dislodged during transfer.
  - **2.** Drug infusions should be placed on battery‐powered infusion pumps to ensure accurate infusion rates. These pumps should be plugged in during the surgical procedure so that battery function is fully charged when ready for transport. A selection of cardiac medications should always be available in the event of an emergency during transport.
- **B.** A standard handoff routine from the anesthesiology team and accompanying providers to the ICU team (nurses, mid‐level providers and/or physicians, respiratory therapists) is essential to ensure an expeditious and safe arrival in the ICU.1
- **C.** Upon arrival in the ICU, the endotracheal tube is connected to a mechanical ventilator, and the ECG, pressure monitoring lines, and pulse oximetry are transduced on a bedside monitor. Some hospitals have transport modules that plug directly into the ICU monitoring systems. Medication drip rates are confirmed or readjusted on controlled infusion pumps, preferably using the same pumps that were used in the operating room to avoid temporary disconnection from the patient. The thoracic drainage system is connected to suction.2
- **D.** During this transition phase, much attention is directed to getting the patient connected to the monitors and attached to the ventilator. To ensure that the patient remains stable while getting settled in, it is critical that the accompanying anesthesia and/or surgical personnel as well as the accepting nurses and respiratory therapists make sure that:

- **1.** The patient is being well ventilated by observing chest movement, auscultating bilateral breath sounds, and confirming that the oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry is acceptable (>90%).
- **2.** The ECG tracing demonstrates satisfactory rate and rhythm on the transport and then the bedside monitor.
- **3.** The blood pressure is adequate on the portable monitor and remains so after the arterial line is transduced and calibrated on the bedside monitor.
- **E.** Immediate assessment and response to any abnormalities suspected to be present at the time of admission to the ICU, whether real or spurious, is imperative. The two most common problems encountered are a low blood pressure and an indecipherable ECG.
- **F. Low blood pressure** (systolic BP <90 mm Hg or mean BP <60 mm Hg) is caused most commonly by hypovolemia or sudden termination of a drug infusion. However, the possibility of a more critical problem, such as acute blood loss, myocardial ischemia, severe myocardial dysfunction, arrhythmias, or ventilatory problems, should always be kept in mind. Low blood pressure may also result from inadequate zeroing of the transducer, or kinking or transient occlusion of the arterial line, producing a dampened tracing. If the transduced blood pressure is low, do the following:
  - **1.** Resume manual ventilation and listen for bilateral breath sounds.
  - **2.** Palpate the brachial or femoral artery to confirm a pulse and a satisfactory blood pressure. Attach the blood pressure cuff above the radial arterial line site and take an auscultatory or occlusion blood pressure. The latter is done by inflating the cuff until the arterial tracing on the monitor is obliterated; when the pressure tracing reappears, the systolic pressure can be read from the sphygmomanometer. **Never assume that a low blood pressure recording is caused by dampening of the arterial line unless a higher pressure can be confirmed by another method.** Insertion of an additional arterial monitoring line (usually in the femoral artery) may be indicated.
  - **3.** Make sure that all medication bottles are appropriately labeled and are connected to the patient and infusing at the designated rate through patent intravenous (IV) lines. **Note:** If hypotension is present, quickly ascertain whether the patient is receiving nitroglycerin or nitroprusside (in the silver wrapper), because both can lower the blood pressure precipitously. Unless you know how to change the drip rate on the particular drug infusion pump, let someone else who is familiar with it take care of it!
  - **4.** Quickly examine the chest tubes for massive mediastinal bleeding. Exsanguinating hemorrhage may require emergency sternotomy.
  - **5.** Evaluate the cardiac filling pressures on the ICU monitor. Confirm that the transducers are at the appropriate levels relative to the patient's position in the bed and that the monitors are calibrated. Not uncommonly, during the very early stages of admission to the ICU, the observed filling pressures will not be accurate and this may confound an assessment of the patient's volume status. The anesthesiologist should be aware of the filling pressures just prior to transport and can assist in assessing whether a significant change has occurred, with low filling pressures indicating hypovolemia and very high filling pressures consistent with myocardial dysfunction, excessive fluid administration, or tamponade.
  - **6.** The initial **treatment** of hypotension should include volume infusion, and, if there is no immediate response, administration of calcium chloride 500 mg IV. Vasoactive medications may be started or the rate of medications already being used can be

- adjusted. **If there is no response to these measures, and the ECG is abnormal, assume the worst and prepare to treat the patient as an imminent cardiac arrest until the problem is sorted out. If the patient cannot be immediately resuscitated, call for help and prepare for an emergency sternotomy.**
- **G.** An **indeterminate or undecipherable ECG** is usually caused by artifact with jostling or detachment of the ECG leads. If the arterial waveform and pulse oximetry readings are acceptable, this is usually the case. However, if the arterial pressure is low or not transduced, the pulse is irregular or slow, or the monitor is difficult to interpret, palpate for a pulse and take the steps mentioned above. **If the blood pressure is undetectable and an ECG reading is not available, assume the worst and treat the patient as a cardiac arrest.** Readjust the ECG leads on the patient and monitor. If interpretation remains difficult, attach a standard ECG machine to limb leads to ascertain the rhythm.
  - **1.** If ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia is present, immediate defibrillation and a cardiac arrest protocol are indicated (see pages 591–599).
  - **2.** If a pacemaker is being used, examine the connections and settings and confirm capture on the bedside monitor or an ECG. Make sure that the pacemaker is appropriately sensing the patient's rhythm, since inappropriate sensing may trigger malignant ventricular arrhythmias.
  - **3.** Attach a pacemaker and initiate pacing if bradycardia or heart block is present. The initial default setting on most external pacemakers is the VVI mode, which should produce a ventricular contraction. One should then attempt to pace the atrium (AOO) or initiate AV pacing (DDD or DVI) if atrial pacing wires are present and heart block is present. If there is no response to atrial pacing, ventricular pacing (VVI) should be used. If the patient has a rhythm, but the ventricle fails to pace, reverse the leads in the cable connector, and if that fails, consider placing a skin wire as a ground in case one of the wires has been dislodged from the heart. One of the atrial leads can also be used as the grounding wire (the anode or positive lead, which is the red connector on the pacing cables).
  - **4.** Look for the undetected development of atrial fibrillation that can develop during AV pacing. This may account for a fall in cardiac output and blood pressure, despite an adequate ventricular pacing rate.
  - **5.** Obtain a 12‐lead ECG, looking for evidence of arrhythmias or ischemia that may require treatment.
- **H.** Once the patient's heart rate, rhythm, and blood pressure are found to be satisfactory and adequate oxygenation and ventilation from the ventilator are confirmed, a full report should be given to the ICU staff by the accompanying anesthesiologist/CRNA and/or surgical house staff/PA/NP. This should include the patient's cardiac disease and comorbidities, the operative procedure and any technical issues, the aortic cross‐ clamp time and duration of cardiopulmonary bypass, medications used to come off bypass and those currently being administered, use of pacing, and special instructions for postoperative care.1 Further assessment as delineated in Table 7.1 can then be carried out to address the subtleties of patient care. A standardized set of preprinted orders that can be adapted to each patient is invaluable in ensuring that no essential elements of the early postoperative care are overlooked (Table 7.2 and Appendix 4). In most hospitals, this is incorporated into a set of electronic orders which must be individualized for each patient.

#### **Table 7.1 • Initial Evaluation of the Patient in the Intensive Care Unit**

- 1. The patient should be examined thoroughly (heart, lungs, peripheral perfusion).
- 2. Obtain hemodynamic measurements, including the central venous pressure (CVP) and PA pressures; obtain a cardiac output and calculate the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (see Table 11.1, page 517).
- 3. A portable supine chest x‐ray should be obtained either in the operating room or soon after arrival in the ICU. Specific attention should be paid to the position of the endotracheal tube and Swan‐Ganz catheter, the width of the mediastinum, and the presence of a pneumothorax, fluid overload, atelectasis, or pleural effusion (hemothorax).
- 4. A 12‐lead ECG should be reviewed for ischemic changes or arrhythmias.
- 5. Laboratory tests should be drawn (see Table 7.2 for sample admission order sheet).
  - **I.** It is very important to review the immediate postoperative chest x‐ray to assess the position of the endotracheal tube and make sure that a pneumothorax is not missed. If present, an additional chest tube may need to be placed. Obtaining a chest x‐ray prior to departure from the operating room is beneficial. However, even if the initial chest x‐ray does not show a pneumothorax, one may develop subsequently, usually due to positive pressure ventilation, and is often manifested by unexplained hypoxemia or unstable hemodynamics without evident cause. In addition, review of an ECG obtained soon after arrival in the ICU is essential to identify any ischemic changes that might require urgent attention.

#### **II. Monitoring in the ICU: Techniques and Problems**

Careful monitoring is required in the early postoperative period to optimize patient management and outcome.2 A continuous display of the ECG is provided, and pressures derived from invasive catheters, including arterial and Swan‐Ganz catheters placed in the operating room, are transduced on bedside monitors (Figure 7.1). The endotracheal tube is securely connected to the mechanical ventilator and appropriate ventilator settings are selected. A continuous readout of the arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2 ) determined by pulse oximetry should be displayed. The drainage outputs of chest tubes and the Foley catheter are measured and recorded. Conscientious data collection on computerized flowsheets is essential. Each invasive technique is used to provide an essential function or obtain special information about the patient's postoperative course, but each has potential complications. Each should be used only as long as necessary to maximize benefit while minimizing morbidity.

- **A. ECG display** on a bedside monitor is critical to allow for rapid interpretation of rhythm changes. Most bedside monitors have a memory, and abnormal rhythms will activate a printout. This is helpful in detecting the mechanism of arrhythmia development (such as an R‐on‐T phenomenon leading to ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation). ST segment analysis is provided by most monitoring systems, but abnormalities must be thoroughly analyzed from a 12‐lead ECG.
- **B.** Mechanical ventilation via an endotracheal tube is used for all patients, except those who are extubated in the operating room. The initial settings are determined by the anesthesiologist and respiratory therapist and generally provide a tidal volume around 6–8 mL/kg at a rate of 12–14/min with the initial FiO2 set at 1.0. Confirmation of bilateral breath sounds and chest movement, intermittent rechecking of ventilator settings, and assessment of the adequacy of gas exchange are essential.

**1.** Pulse oximetry is routinely used to continuously assess the status of peripheral perfusion and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2 ).3 It can draw attention to major problems with oxygenation during the period of intubation and following extubation. If the patient is severely vasoconstricted, the recordings from the patient's fingers may be inadequate and a better signal may be derived from the earlobe. Use of pulse oximetry obviates the need to draw arterial blood gases (ABGs) more than a few times during the period of intubation.4 Nonetheless, it should be kept in mind that pulse oximetry only provides a measurement of SaO2 (and heart rate), but it does not provide the same information as an ABG, which measures the PCO2 and pH. These values may be important in assessing the patient's respiratory drive during

the weaning process and can identify whether the patient has a metabolic or respiratory acidosis/alkalosis. This is particularly valuable in identifying a metabolic acidosis that may reflect borderline hemodynamic function that requires further pharmacologic intervention. A profound metabolic acidosis often suggests the presence of a catastrophic problem, such as mesenteric ischemia.

- **2.** Suctioning should be performed gently every few hours or as necessary to maintain a tube free of secretions but not so frequently as to induce endobronchial trauma or bronchospasm.5 The endotracheal tube bypasses the protective mechanism of the upper airway and predisposes the patient to pulmonary infection. It should be removed as soon as the patient can maintain satisfactory ventilation and oxygenation and is able to protect their airway. This is generally accomplished within 4–6 hours of surgery. A standard protocol for weaning and extubation is essential in any cardiac surgical ICU (see Tables 10.3–10.5, pages 475–476).
- **C. Arterial lines** are placed in either the radial or femoral artery during surgery and are transduced on the bedside monitor.6 Occasionally, a brachial arterial line may be necessary when a radial line cannot be placed and there are anatomic problems that preclude placement of a femoral arterial line. These may include extensive iliofemoral disease, vascular reconstructive grafts in the groin, or limited availability of the femoral vessels because of the use of an intra‐aortic balloon pump (IABP) or femoral cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass. Accurate pressure recording depends on proper calibration and elimination of air from the transducer.

- **1.** Radial arterial pressure measurements do not correspond to the central aortic pressure immediately after bypass in about one‐third of patients, and femoral lines are often placed for more accurate measurements. One study suggested that this phenomenon is more common in patients with short stature, hypertension, or after long complex procedures.7 This problem usually abates by the time the patient reaches the ICU. Generally, the mean pressures at these two sites do correlate, and systolic overshoot from the femoral lines can be eliminated by using resonance overshoot filters.
- **2.** There is often a discrepancy noted between the auscultatory or occlusion blood pressure and that recorded digitally on the bedside monitor. This may be ascribed to the dynamic response characteristics of catheter–transducer systems.8 The overdampening of signals usually results from gas bubbles within the fluid‐filled system. Underdampening of signals is related to excessive compliance, length, or diameter of the tubing connecting the arterial line to the transducer. If the intra‐arterial pressure appears to be dampened or exhibits overshoot, the analog display of the mean pressure is most reliable. The occlusion pressure is probably the most accurate measurement of the systolic pressure.
- **3.** Arterial lines should be connected to continuous saline flushes to improve patency rates and minimize thrombus formation. Heparin flushes do not provide any advantage in maintaining line patency and may potentially increase the risk of developing heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia, although this association has not been documented in studies of cardiac surgical ICU patients.9,10
- **4.** The incidence of complications associated with radial arterial lines, such as digital ischemia or infection, is extremely low, and empiric changing of arterial lines is not mandatory. However, attention must always be directed to perfusion of the hand when a radial arterial line is present, so that prompt therapy can be initiated if problems develop. Digital ischemia can occur within a few days and usually is associated with low output states and use of vasoconstrictive medications. This may then cause thrombosis at the insertion site with distal embolization.11 This is a serious problem that mandates immediate removal of the arterial line. It usually does not respond to radial revascularization but can be treated with vasodilators to minimize tissue loss. Infections usually respond to removal of the catheter and antibiotics. An infected pseudoaneurysm usually requires surgery.12
- **5.** Arterial lines are invaluable for sampling ABG specimens and obtaining blood for other laboratory tests, but they are often retained when invasive pressure monitoring is no longer essential but IV access for blood sampling is limited. Arterial lines should generally be removed when there is no longer a requirement for pharmacologic support and when satisfactory post‐extubation ABGs have been achieved. A room‐air blood gas before removal may give a baseline assessment of the patient's oxygenation. However, as long as the PaO2 and oxygen saturation obtained from an ABG are consistent with the SaO2 measured by pulse oximetry, the latter may then be used to follow the patient's oxygenation. After removal of a femoral arterial catheter, adequate manual pressure should be maintained to produce adequate hemostasis. A falling hematocrit of unclear etiology could result from bleeding into the groin or retroperitoneum from the femoral access site.
- **D. Central venous pressure (CVP)** monitoring may provide adequate information about filling pressures in patients with preserved ventricular function undergoing coronary

surgery.<sup>13,14</sup> Whereas a low CVP is invariably associated with hypovolemia, a high CVP is consistent with fluid overload, right ventricular (RV) dysfunction (that may be exacerbated by positive-pressure ventilation), severe tricuspid regurgitation, or cardiac tamponade. It is less precise in estimating left-heart filling pressures, especially in patients with left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy or LV dysfunction. Although both elevated CVP and PA pressures measured by a Swan-Ganz catheter are somewhat insensitive to the status of circulatory blood volume and are imprecise in predicting fluid responsiveness, PA catheter monitoring is still widely used to direct management in patients with compromised cardiac function, especially those undergoing valve procedures. An understanding of the patient's underlying heart disease and correlation of filling pressures with intraoperative echocardiographic findings allows for appropriate therapeutic decisions to be made.<sup>15–21</sup> Patients with PA catheters tend to receive more volume than those managed with only CVP lines, with a tendency towards delayed extubation.<sup>15</sup>

- **E.** Venous oxygen saturation reflects the balance between oxygen delivery and consumption by the tissues.<sup>22</sup> The mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO<sub>2</sub>) obtained from the distal PA port of a Swan-Ganz catheter has been considered the best means of assessing this balance, and, although subject to many variables, it is generally reflective of the cardiac output.<sup>23</sup> An improvement in SvO<sub>2</sub> with fluid administration generally correlates with increased oxygen delivery to tissues as noted with an improved cardiac output.<sup>24</sup>
  - 1. An inexpensive alternative to the SvO<sub>2</sub> is the central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO<sub>2</sub>) obtained from a CVP line, which in some studies has been demonstrated to correlate fairly well with SvO<sub>2</sub>.<sup>25</sup> However, there is often a significant discrepancy between these two values which reflects variation in regional blood flow, and it is most marked when the SaO<sub>2</sub>, hemoglobin, or cardiac index is low.<sup>26,27</sup> Although the SvO<sub>2</sub> is helpful in assessing the cardiac output, the lack of correlation with the ScvO<sub>2</sub> demonstrated in several studies suggests that the latter should only be used as a relative means of detecting trends in oxygen extraction.
  - 2. One study of goal-directed therapy (GDT) in moderate- to high-risk patients evaluated whether use of the Vigileo/FloTrac device (see pages 355–356) to measure cardiac outputs along with continuous ScvO<sub>2</sub> measurements provided any clinical benefits compared with standard monitoring including a CVP line. GDT resulted in increased volume infusions, more adjustment of inotropic medications, and a decrease in the duration of ventilation, but otherwise, there were few clinical benefits over standard CVP monitoring.<sup>28</sup>
- F. Swan-Ganz pulmonary artery catheters are commonly placed in patients undergoing open-heart surgery to assist with intraoperative and postoperative hemodynamic management. In some centers, they are used selectively; in others, they are used uniformly to aid with postoperative care. As noted, PA pressure measurements do not have a precise correlation with volume status, but an integration of filling pressures and cardiac output measurements usually can be used to make evidence-based, scientific decisions about fluid, inotropic, or vasopressor support, although their impact on clinical outcome may only be evident in high-risk patients. They are generally placed either prior to or more commonly after the induction of anesthesia and intubation.
  - 1. The basic flow-directed monitoring catheters measure the CVP, the pulmonary artery (PA), and pulmonary capillary wedge (PCW) pressures indicative of left-sided

filling, and allow for the determination of thermodilution cardiac outputs. Blood sampled from the PA port allows for measurement of the SvO2 . Although the correlation of SvO2 and cardiac output is subject to many variables (see pages 519–520), the SvO2 is helpful in several clinical situations:

- **a.** To follow trends in oxygen delivery with fluid administration or inotrope use.
- **b.** To corroborate that the thermodilution output is or is not consistent with the patient's clinical course.
- **c.** To obtain a general estimate of cardiac output in patients with tricuspid regurgitation, in whom the thermodilution cardiac output is inaccurate and tends to underestimate the cardiac output.29,30 This is a situation when a FloTrac is invaluable, unless the patient is in atrial fibrillation.
- **2.** The introducer sheath for a PA catheter (the Cordis) is an 8.5 Fr catheter with a sidearm for volume infusions. In patients with limited access, a Teleflex multilumen access catheter (MAC) with a 12‐gauge proximal lumen and a 9 Fr distal lumen is quite helpful.
- **3.** The proximal port of the Swan‐Ganz catheter (30 cm from the tip) is used for CVP measurements from the right atrium and for fluid injections to determine the cardiac output. Care must be exercised when injecting sterile fluid for cardiac outputs to prevent bolusing of vasoactive medications that might be running through the CVP port. **Note:** one must **never** infuse anything through this port if the catheter has been pulled back, such that the tip of the catheter lies in the right atrium and the CVP port is not within the bloodstream!
- **4.** The distal port should always be transduced and displayed on the bedside monitor to allow for detection of catheter advancement into the permanent wedge position, which could result in pulmonary artery injury. This will be detected by loss of the phasic PA trace on the monitor and is suggested by the position of the catheter on a chest x‐ray. Because the pulmonary artery diastolic (PAD) pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) are fairly similar (the PAD being slightly higher, in the absence of mitral valve pathology, because of the pulmonary vascular resistance) and tend to move in tandem, the PAD can be used as a surrogate for the PCWP for an assessment of LV volumes. Thus, balloon inflation ("wedging" of the catheter) does not need to be performed routinely, if at all. If it is desired to obtain a PCWP measurement, the balloon should not be inflated for more than two respiratory cycles to prevent PA injury. Balloon inflation should be performed cautiously with minimal inflation volume or should be avoided entirely in patients with pulmonary hypertension. Medications should never be given through the distal PA port.
- **5.** The interpretation of hemodynamic parameters derived from the PA catheter requires an understanding of the patient's underlying disease process, filling pressures and cardiac output at baseline and upon weaning from bypass, the nature and extent of the operative procedure, and the effects of surgery on ventricular compliance. Interpretation of these values can be optimized by integrating intraoperative echocardiographic assessments of ventricular volumes and function. The PA catheter provides pressure measurements and the correlation with the left ventricular end‐diastolic volume depends on ventricular compliance (i.e. the less compliant the ventricle, the higher the pressure at equal preload).18 With an understanding that

- "normal" hemodynamic measurements vary from patient to patient, a Swan‐Ganz catheter can provide invaluable information for patient management by assessing volume status and response to volume infusions, providing an indirect assessment of systolic function and response to vasoactive drug support, and identifying early evidence of ischemia (rising filling pressures).31
- **6.** Advanced technology Swan‐Ganz catheters available from Edwards Lifesciences (https://www.edwards.com/devices/hemodynamic‐monitoring/swan‐ganz‐ catheters) include those that provide continuous cardiac output measurements and those that provide in‐line oximetry (SvO2 ) assessments. These are invaluable during off‐pump bypass surgery. The most sophisticated catheters in the CCOmbo series used with the Vigilance II monitor can measure preload (right atrial pressure, PA diastolic and wedge pressures, and right‐ventricular end‐diastolic volume), calculate afterload (SVR), and assess contractility by assessing the stroke volume index and RVEF. There are also thermodilution Swan‐Ganz Paceport catheters available.
- **7.** Although there is a significant incidence of minor complications associated with the insertion and use of the Swan‐Ganz catheter, serious life‐threatening complications are very uncommon. The catheter is more commonly placed through the internal jugular vein than the subclavian vein for cardiac surgery, as the catheter may become displaced during sternal retraction with the latter approach.32 Using ultrasound imaging with an echo probe to identify the location of the internal jugular vein is helpful in avoiding arterial puncture (Figure 4.2, page 222).
  - **a.** Complications associated with insertion include:
    - ∙ Arrhythmias and heart block (especially in patients with a left bundle branch block)

- ∙ Arterial puncture
- ∙ Pneumothorax
- ∙ Air embolism
- ∙ Perforation of the right atrium or ventricle
- ∙ Catheter knotting
- **b.** Complications of indwelling PA catheters include:
  - ∙ Arrhythmias and heart block
  - ∙ Heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia (from heparin‐coated catheters)
  - ∙ Infection
  - ∙ Pulmonary artery rupture and hemorrhage; pulmonary pseudoaneurysms
  - ∙ Endocardial and valvular damage
  - ∙ Pulmonary infarction
  - ∙ Pulmonary infiltrates
  - ∙ Venous thrombosis
- **8.** Pulmonary artery perforation is a very serious complication that may occur during insertion of the catheter, during surgery, or at any time in the ICU.33–35 The position of the catheter should always be inspected on an immediate postoperative or any postinsertion chest x‐ray. Migration of the catheter into the wedge position should be evident by dampening of the PA tracing on the bedside monitor, and the catheter should be pulled back immediately. Perforation may lead to hemoptysis, bleeding into the endotracheal tube, or intrapleural hemorrhage. The chest x‐ray may demonstrate a hematoma surrounding the tip of the catheter. If perforation is suspected, the catheter should be withdrawn and positive end‐expiratory pressure (PEEP) added to the ventilator circuit. If bleeding persists, bronchoscopy can be performed with placement of a bronchial blocker to isolate the lung. Use of a double‐lumen endotracheal tube or even a thoracotomy with pulmonary resection may be indicated for ongoing pulmonary hemorrhage. Rarely, a false aneurysm of the pulmonary artery branches may develop. This has been treated by transcatheter embolization.36 The management of pulmonary artery perforation occurring during surgery is discussed on pages 224–225.
- **G. Cardiac output monitoring.** Although the flow‐directed Swan‐Ganz catheter is the gold standard for measuring cardiac outputs intra‐ and postoperatively, it is an invasive catheter associated with a number of potential complications. Similarly, the Edwards CCO and CCOmbo series are helpful during and after off‐pump surgery and can provide additional information. Alternative, less‐invasive means of determining the cardiac output may also be useful, and their correlation with thermodilution cardiac outputs is fairly good.37–42
  - **1.** Of particular value in cardiac surgery is the Edwards Vigileo/FloTrac device, which performs an analysis of the pressure wave signal from the arterial line, correlates the standard deviation of the pulse pressure with the stroke volume using patient demographic data, adjusts for vascular compliance, and then provides continuous cardiac output calculations (Figure 7.2). This is very valuable when a Swan‐Ganz catheter has not been placed, is not functioning well, provides cardiac output values that appear inconsistent with the patient's clinical picture, or when moderate-severe tricuspid regurgitation is present. Readings are inaccurate during

- conditions of hemodynamic instability or arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or frequent ventricular ectopy. During off‐pump surgery, it is extremely helpful in assessing cardiac function when the heart is displaced for posterior anastomoses or when significant ischemia occurs.40 The correlation with thermodilution cardiac outputs is reasonably accurate.41–46
- **2.** A number of other systems using pulse contour or pulse wave velocity analysis, bioimpedance, and esophageal Doppler have been developed to determine cardiac output less invasively. Their role in cardiac surgery patients has been somewhat limited.37,38,47,48
- **H. Left atrial (LA) lines** can be used in special circumstances to give the most accurate assessment of left‐sided filling pressures. They are placed through the right superior pulmonary vein and passed into the left atrium during surgery.
  - **1.** LA lines are particularly helpful in patients with high transpulmonary gradients, in whom the PAD pressure is significantly greater than true left‐sided filling pressures. They may be used in patients with severe LV dysfunction, severe pulmonary hypertension secondary to mitral valve disease, during use of circulatory assist devices, or following heart transplantation.
  - **2.** Although LA lines may provide important hemodynamic information, they are associated with rare but potentially significant complications.49,50 An LA line should always be considered dangerous because of the risk of air embolism. It must always be aspirated before being flushed to make sure there is no air or thrombus present within the system. It is then connected to a constant infusion flush line that includes an air filter to reduce the risk of systemic air embolism. The line should be removed when the chest tubes are still in place in the event of bleeding from the insertion site.
- **I. Chest tubes** are placed in the mediastinum and into the pleural spaces if they are entered during surgery. Straight and right‐angled 32 Fr PVC or silicone‐coated chest tubes are placed in the mediastinum, either two anteriorly or one anteriorly and one below the heart. The latter should be tacked by the surgeon away from inferior wall grafts, as compression could lead to inferior ischemia, which should be evident on a postoperative ECG. Pleural tubes can be placed subcostally or through the lateral chest wall. The latter may produce more chest wall pain with more impairment of pulmonary function, but theoretically are less likely to contribute to mediastinal infection if left in place for a prolonged period of time.51–53 Use of silicone fluted Blake drains ( J & J Medical Devices) or even Jackson‐Pratt silicone or PVC drains (CardinalHealth) has been reported to have equal if not better effectiveness in reducing residual pericardial effusions and the risk of atrial fibrillation, and are more comfortable for the patient.54–56
  - **1.** Drainage should be recorded every 15 minutes and then less frequently once mediastinal bleeding tapers to minimal levels. The chest tubes are connected to a drainage system to which −20 cm of H2 O suction is applied. The tubes should be gently milked or stripped to prevent blood from clotting within them. There is no particular advantage of any of the common practices (milking, stripping, fanfolding, or tapping) in maintaining chest tube patency.57–59 Aggressive stripping creates a negative pressure of up to −300 cm H2 O in the mediastinum. This may actually increase bleeding and is quite painful to a patient who has regained consciousness and is not adequately sedated. Suctioning of clotted chest tubes with endotracheal suction catheters is discouraged in the ICU because of the risk of introducing infection.

- This has led to the development of a silicone chest tube system with a clearance apparatus that allows for advancement of a loop over a guidewire into the chest tube to break up and extract clot (Pleuraflow ACT, ClearFlow Inc.).60
- **2.** Bloody drainage through chest tubes can be best observed if the tubes are not completely covered with tape. Plastic connectors must be tightly and securely attached to both the chest tubes and the drainage tubing to maintain sterility and prevent air leaks within the system. Although an air leak should always raise the possibility of a pulmonary parenchymal leak, the connections should be checked first since a loose connection or disconnection is an easily remediable problem. The development of subcutaneous emphysema may reflect an active air leak with clotted chest tubes, but more frequently is the result of kinking of the tubes.
- **3.** Excessive mediastinal bleeding requires immediate attention because it often leads to hemodynamic instability, metabolic acidosis, the requirement for multiple blood products, and the potential for cardiac tamponade (see Chapter 9).
- **4.** Autotransfusion of shed mediastinal blood can be used as a component of a blood conservation strategy, but its benefits are controversial. It provides volume expansion with the potential for reducing transfusion requirements. However, shed blood also has a low level of platelets, fibrinogen, and factor VIII and a high level of fibrin split products.61 Although reinfusion in moderate amounts (less than 1 L) does not significantly alter coagulation parameters, larger amounts may.62 If the patient has bled that much, re‐exploration is probably indicated. Autotransfusion can be accomplished either from soft plastic collection bags or directly from the plastic shell via a pump through a 20–40 μm filter.
- **J.** The **urinary Foley catheter** is attached to gravity drainage and the urine output is recorded hourly. Urine output is subject to many variables, but in a patient with normal renal function, it generally reflects the level of renal perfusion, which may be compromised in a low cardiac output state.
  - **1.** Foley catheters incorporating temperature probes are commonly used during surgery and can be used in the ICU to record the patient's core temperature.
  - **2.** The Foley catheter is usually removed at midnight entering the second postoperative day.63 It may be left in place if the patient is undergoing a significant diuresis or has a history of prostatic hypertrophy or urinary retention and has not been mobilized. Although earlier removal is associated with a higher risk of voiding problems, it does reduce the risk of developing a urinary tract infection, which is related to the duration of indwelling catheter time. Thus, early removal should be considered in patients with prosthetic valves and grafts when its use is no longer essential.
  - **3.** Suprapubic tubes should be left in place and clamped after several days to see if the patient can void per urethra.
- **K. Nasogastric tubes** or orogastric tubes may be inserted in the operating room or after the patient's arrival in the ICU to aid with gastric decompression. Insertion may cause hypertension, bradycardia, tachycardia, or arrhythmias if the patient is not well sedated. Insertion may also cause nasopharyngeal bleeding if the patient is still heparinized (during surgery) or has a coagulopathy. Instillation of a medication to reduce stress ulceration, such as sucralfate, should be considered for all patients during the first 12–24 hours. Proton‐pump inhibitors are preferred for patients at high risk for stress‐ulcer‐ related bleeding, and may provide some benefit to any patient taking aspirin, a P2Y12

- inhibitor, warfarin, or non‐vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC) soon after surgery, which basically includes all patients undergoing cardiac surgery.64,65
- **L. Pacing wires.** Most surgeons place two atrial and two ventricular temporary epicardial pacing wire electrodes at the conclusion of open‐heart surgery. If the pacing wires are being used, they must be securely attached to the patient and to the cable connector, and the cable must be securely attached to the pacing box. The pacemaker box itself should be easily accessible. **Everyone caring for the patient should understand how the particular pacemaker generator works and what the current pacemaker settings are.** Pacing wires that are not being used should be placed in insulating needle caps to isolate them from stray electrical currents that could potentially trigger arrhythmias. Particular issues of concern are pacing thresholds in patients with complete heart block and no escape mechanism, and inappropriate sensing and pacing that could trigger malignant arrhythmias. Issues regarding pacing wire removal are discussed on pages 609 and 758.

#### **III. Summary of Guidelines for Removal of Lines and Tubes in the ICU**

- **A.** The Swan‐Ganz catheter should be removed when inotropic support and vasodilators are no longer necessary. If central venous access is required after several days but hemodynamic monitoring is no longer essential, the Swan‐Ganz catheter can be replaced by a double‐ or triple‐lumen catheter. Alternatively, a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line can be placed. If the Swan‐Ganz catheter is removed but the introducer sheath is left in place for fluid or medication administration, the port must be covered with a small adhesive drape to minimize the risk of infection. A one‐way valve present on most introducer sheaths eliminates the possibility of air embolism. The introducer should be removed as soon as possible because of its size to minimize the risk of infection and venous thrombosis (let alone patient discomfort).
- **B.** Any central line should be removed when no longer necessary, to reduce the risk of infection. If central access is indicated but the patient has a fever of unknown origin or suspected bacteremia, the catheter should be removed and cultured, and another catheter inserted in a different site. If neither of these indications is present, the catheter can be changed over a guidewire to reduce the risk of mechanical complications associated with a new insertion. The catheter tip should still be cultured, and if this returns positive, the catheter should be changed to a new site.66,67 If the patient has very poor peripheral access but needs continued IV access, a PICC line through an upper arm vein is useful.
- **C.** An additional ABG obtained on room air is frequently worthwhile because it provides a relative indication of the patient's baseline postoperative oxygenation and it can be correlated with the SaO2 measured by pulse oximetry. Subsequently, the latter may be used to follow the patient's oxygenation. The arterial line should not be left in place as a convenience for blood sampling. Adequate pressure should be maintained over the groin upon removal of a femoral arterial catheter. Early removal of femoral artery catheters enables the patient to be mobilized out of bed.
- **D.** LA lines must be removed in the ICU with the chest tubes remaining in place in the event that intrapericardial bleeding occurs.

- **E.** The urinary catheter can be left in place if the patient is undergoing a vigorous diuresis or has an increased risk of urinary retention. It should otherwise be removed once the patient is mobilized out of bed, usually at midnight entering the second postoperative day.
- **F.** Chest tubes should be removed when the total drainage is less than 100 mL for eight hours.
  - **1.** Serous drainage related to fluid overload will usually taper with additional diuresis. One study found that prolonging the duration of drainage may increase total chest‐tube output without any effect on the incidence of postoperative pericardial effusions.68 Another showed that there was no difference in the incidence of pericardial effusions if tubes were withdrawn when drainage was less than 50 mL over five hours or when the fluid became serosanguineous (either upon visual inspection or when the drain:blood hematocrit ratio was <0.3).69 However, another study did find that leaving chest tubes in at least until the second postoperative day and removing them only after the drainage was <50 mL/4 h more than halved the incidence of delayed tamponade.70
  - **2.** Generally, there is a potential advantage and little downside to leaving mediastinal chest tubes in for a few additional days if there is evidence of persistent serosanguineous drainage. Additionally, leaving a supplemental drain in the pleural space for 3–5 days is useful in reducing the incidence of symptomatic pleural effusions. If this is contemplated at the time of surgery, this tube should preferably be placed through the lateral chest wall, although it may cause the patient more discomfort and adversely affect pulmonary function.51–53,71
  - **3.** Mediastinal tubes should **always be removed off suction**, because graft avulsion might theoretically occur if suction is maintained. A chest x‐ray is not essential after mediastinal tube removal, but it should be performed after removal of pleural chest tubes to check for the development of a pneumothorax.
