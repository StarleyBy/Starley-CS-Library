### **1B** New York Heart Association Functional Classification

**Class I** Patient has cardiac disease but without resulting limitations of ordinary physical activity. Ordinary physical activity (e.g. walking several blocks or climbing stairs) does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain. Limiting symptoms may occur with marked exertion.

- **Class II** Patient has cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of ordinary physical activity. Patient is comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity such as walking more than two blocks or climbing more than one flight of stairs results in limiting symptoms (e.g. fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain).
- **Class III** Patient has cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. Patient is comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary physical activity (e.g. walking one to two level blocks or climbing one flight of stairs) causes fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain.
- **Class IV** Patient has dyspnea at rest that increases with any physical activity. Patient has cardiac disease resulting in inability to perform any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms may be present even at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased.

### **1C** The Canadian Cardiovascular Society Classification for Grading of Angina

- **Class I** Ordinary activity does not cause angina. Angina with strenuous, rapid, or prolonged exertion only.
- **Class II** Slight limitation of ordinary activity. Angina on walking or climbing stairs rapidly, walking or stair climbing after meals, in cold weather, when under emotional stress, during the first few hours of awakening or walking more than two blocks on the level or climbing more than one flight of ordinary stairs at a normal pace under normal conditions.
- **Class III** Marked limitation of ordinary physical activity. Angina on walking one or two blocks on the level or one flight of stairs at a normal pace under normal conditions.
- **Class IV** Inability to carry out any physical activity without discomfort or angina at rest.

### **1D** Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) Profiles of Advanced Heart Failure

Patients with NYHA class IV and AHA stage D heart failure may be classified as INTERMACS profiles 1–6 indicating the severity of their clinical heart failure. Patients with INTERMACS 7 are those with advanced NYHA class III heart failure.

- **INTERMACS 1: Critical cardiogenic shock** with life‐threatening hypotension refractory to rapidly escalating inotropic pressor support, with critical organ hypoperfusion. *"Crash and burn."* Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is indicated within hours.
- **INTERMACS 2: Progressive decline** with acceptable blood pressure on inotropic support, but worsening renal function, nutritional status, or end‐organ function. *"Sliding fast."* MCS is indicated within a few days.
- **INTERMACS 3: Stable but inotrope‐dependent** with stable blood pressure and end‐organ function, but cannot be weaned from inotropic support without developing hypotension, HF symptoms, or worsening organ system function (usually renal). *"Dependent stability."* MCS may be considered within a few weeks to months.
- **INTERMACS 4: Resting symptoms** at home on oral medications with daily symptoms of HF at rest or with activities of daily living (ADLs). Temporary cessation of inotropic support may be possible, but patient has frequent symptoms of fluid overload requiring very high dose diuretics. Signs and symptoms include orthopnea, dyspnea with ADLs, and lower extremity edema. *"Frequent flyer."* MCS may be indicated within a few months.
- **INTERMACS 5: Exertion intolerant** being comfortable at rest without symptoms of HF, but unable to engage in any other activities; usually have underlying refractory elevated volume status, often with renal dysfunction. *"Housebound."*
- **INTERMACS 6: Exertion limited** patients are comfortable at rest without evidence of fluid overload, and able to do ADLs and minor activities outside of the home. *"Walking wounded."* However, any meaningful physical activity causes fatigue. Symptoms will occasionally worsen, with most patients hospitalized within the past year.
- **INTERMACS 7: Advanced NYHA Class 3** patients are clinically stable, being comfortable with a reasonable level of mild activity, such as walking a block.

### **Transition to Subcutaneous Insulin**

- □ units Insulin glargine (Lantus) SC daily
- □ units Insulin aspart (Novolog) SC tid with first dose 30 minutes prior to stopping insulin infusion
- **1.** Take the average hourly requirement for insulin (in units/h) for the past 4 hours and multiply by 24 for the total daily dose of insulin (e.g. 1 unit/h × 24 = 24 units/day)
- **2.** Give 80% of that dose for total daily dose of SC insulin (e.g. 24 units becomes 20 units/day), giving half as insulin glargine (basal) and half as insulin aspart (very fast acting) divided into 3 daily doses. Subsequent requirements may be adjusted based upon response to these initial doses.
- **3.** In this example, for 20 units/day, the patient would receive 10 units of Lantus and approximately 4 units of Novolog tid.

Medications metabolized by the liver do not require reduction in dosage for renal failure; medications metabolized by the kidneys must be adjusted according to the serum creatinine, or more precisely by the glomerular filtration rate. The reader should refer to the *Physician's Desk Reference* or online (PDR.net) or other online drug websites, such as Rxlist.com, for complete prescribing information.

Antianginal medications given four times a day (qid) are usually taken four hours apart during the daytime. Other medications should generally be taken at equally spaced intervals.

Medications metabolized by the liver do not require reduction in dosage for renal failure; medications metabolized by the kidneys must be adjusted according to the serum creatinine, or more precisely, by the glomerular filtration rate. The reader should refer to the *Physician's Desk Reference* or online (PDR.net) or other online drug websites, such as Rxlist.com, for complete prescribing information.

H, hepatic metabolism; R, renal elimination; M, metabolized in the bloodstream

# 14 Definitions from the STS Data Specifications (Version 4.20 2020)

### **4. Diabetes mellitus**

- **a.** Hemoglobin A1c ≥6.5%; or
- **b.** A history of diabetes diagnosed and/or treated by a healthcare provider
- **c.** Definitions in prior specifications included:
  - **i.** Fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L); or
  - **ii.** Two‐hour plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during an oral glucose tolerance test; or
  - **iii.** In a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis, a random plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L)
- **5. Renal failure** on dialysis is the only criterion listed on version 4.20 STS entry forms. The serum creatinine is a data entry, and the stage of chronic kidney disease noted below is helpful in assessing the risk of acute kidney injury or the risk of dialysis. GFR is measured in mL/min/1.73 m2 .
  - **a.** Stage 1 GFR >90
  - **b.** Stage 2 GFR 60–89
  - **c.** Stage 3a GFR 45–59
  - **d.** Stage 3b GFR 30–44
  - **e.** Stage 4 GFR 15–30
  - **f.** Stage 5 GFR <15

### **6. Hypertension**

- **a.** A history of hypertension diagnosed and treated with medication, diet, and/or exercise
- **b.** Currently undergoing pharmacological therapy for treatment of hypertension
- **c.** Definitions in prior specifications included prior documentation of blood pressure >140 mm Hg systolic and/or >90 mm Hg diastolic for patients without diabetes or chronic kidney disease, or prior documentation of blood pressure >130 mm Hg systolic or >80 mm Hg diastolic on at least two occasions for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease (see *J Am Coll Cardiol* 2017;71:e127–248).
- **7. Heart failure (HF):** unusual dyspnea on light exertion, recurrent dyspnea occurring in the supine position, fluid retention; or the description of rales, jugular venous distension, pulmonary edema on physical exam, or pulmonary edema on chest x‐ray presumed to be cardiac dysfunction. A low ejection fraction alone, without clinical evidence of heart failure, does not qualify as heart failure. An elevated BNP without other supporting documentation should not be coded as HF.
  - **a.** Acute HF: rapid onset of symptoms and signs of HF that may occur with or without previous cardiac disease occurring within 2 weeks of surgery. Acute decompensated HF is a sudden worsening of the signs and symptoms of HF, which typically include difficulty breathing (dyspnea), leg or feet swelling, and fatigue.
  - **b.** Chronic HF develops gradually over time with symptoms of shortness of breath, lower extremity swelling, and fatigue without exacerbation within the 2 weeks prior to admission.
  - **c.** Acute on chronic HF refers to patients with chronic HF who present with acute or worsening symptoms within 2 weeks of surgery.
- **8. Stable angina:** angina without a change in frequency or pattern for the six weeks prior. Angina is controlled by rest and/or oral or transcutaneous medications.

### **9. Unstable angina**

- **a.** Rest angina (occurring at rest and prolonged, usually >20 minutes)
- **b.** New‐onset angina (within the past two months, of at least Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) class III severity)
- **c.** Increasing angina (previously diagnosed angina that has become distinctly more frequent, longer in duration, or increased by one or more CCS classes to at least CCS III severity)
- **10. Non‐ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (non‐STEMI):** the patient was hospitalized for a NSTEMI as documented in the medical record. The definition in prior data specifications was the presence of both:
  - **a.** Cardiac biomarkers (creatinine kinase‐myocardial band, troponin T or I) that exceed the upper limit of normal. Laboratory confirmation of myocardial necrosis; laboratory parameters with a clinical presentation consistent or suggestive of ischemia. ECG changes and/or ischemic symptoms may or may not be present.
  - **b.** Absence of ECG changes diagnostic of a STEMI.
- **11. ST‐elevation MI (STEMI):** the patient presented with a STEMI of its equivalent as documented in the medical records. The definition in prior data specifications was the presence of both:
  - **a.** New/presumed new ST segment elevation or new left bundle branch block not documented to be resolved within 20 minutes. ST segment elevation is defined by new or presumed new sustained ST segment elevation at the J‐point in two contiguous ECG leads with the cut‐off points: ≥0.2 mV in men or ≥0.15 mV in women in leads V2–V3 and/or ≥0.1 mV in other leads and lasting greater than or equal to 20 minutes. ST elevation in the posterior chest leads (V7 through V9), or ST depression that is maximal in V1–V3, without ST segment elevation in other leads, demonstrating posterobasal myocardial infarction, is considered a STEMI equivalent.
  - **b.** Cardiac biomarkers (CK‐MB, troponin T or I) exceed the upper limit of normal with a clinical presentation which is consistent or suggestive of ischemia.
- **12. Cardiogenic shock:** a sustained (>30 min) episode of hypoperfusion evidenced by systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg and/or, if available, cardiac index <2.2 L/min/m2 secondary to cardiac dysfunction and/or the requirement for parenteral inotropic or vasopressor agents or mechanical support (e.g. IABP, extracorporeal circulation, VADs) to maintain blood pressure and cardiac index above those specified levels.
- **13. Resuscitation:** CPR required within 24 hours prior to induction of anesthesia for surgery, which may include use of ECMO or mechanical circulatory support exclusive of an IABP.

### **14. Urgency**

- **a.** Elective: the patient's cardiac function has been stable in the days or weeks prior to the operation. The procedure could be deferred without increased risk of compromised cardiac outcome.
- **b.** Urgent: procedure required during same hospitalization in order to minimize chance of further clinical deterioration. This includes but is not limited to: worsening or sudden chest pain, HF, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), anatomy, IABP, unstable angina with intravenous nitroglycerin (IV NTG), or rest angina. Any of the conditions that require that the patient remain in the hospital until surgery can take place, but the patient is able to wait for surgery until the next available OR schedule time. Delay in the operation may be necessitated by attempts to improve the patient's

- condition, availability of a spouse or parent for informed consent, availability of blood products, or the availability of results of essential laboratory procedures or tests.
- **c.** Emergent: surgery is indicated without any delay for ongoing, refractory (difficult, complicated, and/or unmanageable) unrelenting cardiac compromise, with or without hemodynamic instability, and not responsive to any form of therapy except cardiac surgery. Examples include:
  - **i.** Hemodynamic picture of shock that is being chemically or mechanically supported, such as IV inotrope or IABP to maintain cardiac output
  - **ii.** Pulmonary edema requiring intubation and ventilation
  - **iii.** An extending MI
  - **iv.** Signs of ongoing ischemia, i.e. ECG changes
  - **v.** Acute native valve dysfunction, (acute papillary muscle rupture or torn leaflet)
  - **vi.** Prosthetic valve dysfunction with structural failure (valve‐fractured or torn leaflet, thrombus formation, pannus development which impedes flow through the valve orifice, or valvular dehiscence)
  - **vii.** Acute aortic dissection, rupture or dissection during cardiac cath; perforation, tamponade following cardiac cath
- **d.** Emergent/Salvage: the patient is undergoing CPR en route to the OR prior to anesthesia induction or has ongoing ECMO to maintain life.

### **Postoperative Complications**

**1. Operative mortality:** all deaths, regardless of cause, occurring during the hospitalization in which the operation was performed, even if after 30 days (including patients transferred to other acute care facilities) and all deaths, regardless of cause, occurring after discharge from the hospital, but before the end of the 30th postoperative day.

### **2. Neurological deficit**

- **a.** Permanent stroke: any confirmed neurological deficit of abrupt onset caused by a disturbance in blood supply to the brain that did not resolve within 24 hours.
- **b.** Encephalopathy: altered mental state
- **c.** New postoperative paralysis, paraparesis, or paraplegia related to spinal cord ischemia and not related to a stroke.

### **3. Renal failure**

- **a.** An increase in serum creatinine level 3.0 × greater than baseline, or serum creatinine level ≥4 mg/dL. Acute rise must be at least 0.5 mg/dL.
- **b.** A new requirement for dialysis postoperatively.
- **4. Prolonged ventilation:** prolonged postoperative pulmonary ventilation >24 hours from time of OR exit plus any additional hours following reintubation.
- **5. Superficial wound infection:** an infection that occurs within 30 days after the procedure, **and** involves only skin/subcutaneous tissue of the incision, **and** the patient has at least one of the following:
  - **a.** Purulent drainage from the superficial incision
  - **b.** Organisms isolated from an aseptically obtained culture of fluid or tissue from the superficial incision
  - **c.** Superficial incision that is deliberately opened and is culture positive or not cultured **and** patient has ≥1 of the following: localized pain or tenderness, localized swelling, erythema, or heat. Note that cellulitis alone or a stitch abscess does not qualify as a superficial incisional infection.

- **6. Deep sternal wound infection:** an infection that occurs within 30 days after the procedure, **and** involves deep soft tissues of the incision (e.g. fascial and muscle layers) **with** at least one of the following:
  - **a.** Purulent drainage from the deep incision
  - **b.** A deep incision that spontaneously dehisces or is deliberately opened and is culture‐ positive or not cultured, **and** the patient has at least one of the following signs or symptoms: fever (>38 °C), localized pain or tenderness, an abscess or other evidence of infection involving the deep incision that is detected on direct examination, during invasive procedure, or by histopathologic examination or imaging test.
- **7. Organ system infection** that occurs within 30 days after the procedure that involves any part of the body deeper than the fascia or muscle layers that is opened or manipulated during the operative procedure and the patient has at least one of the following:
  - **a.** Purulent drainage from a drain that is placed into the organ/space
  - **b.** Organisms isolated from an aseptically obtained culture of fluid or tissue in the organ/space
  - **c.** An abscess or other evidence of infection involving the organ/space that is detected on direct examination, during invasive procedure, or by histopathologic examination or imaging test, **and** meets at least one of the following criteria for a specific organ/ space infection of mediastinitis:
    - ∙ Organisms cultured from mediastinal tissue or fluid obtained during an invasive procedure
    - ∙ Evidence of mediastinitis seen during an invasive procedure or histopathologic examination; **and**
    - ∙ **At least 1** of the following signs or symptoms: fever (>38 °C), chest pain, or sternal instability; **and**
    - ∙ **At least 1** of the following: purulent discharge from mediastinal area or organisms cultured from blood or discharge from mediastinal area

### **20** Technique of Thoracentesis

- **A.** The level of the fluid should be determined on chest x‐ray and confirmed by dullness to percussion. The skin is prepped and draped. One percent lidocaine is used for local anesthesia of the skin. A 22‐gauge needle is passed to the upper border of the rib and the periosteum is anesthetized. The needle is then passed over the rib into the pleural space.
- **B.** When the pleural space has been entered, fluid should be aspirated to confirm that the effusion has been located. A larger "intracatheter" needle is then passed into the pleural cavity, the plastic catheter advanced, and the metal needle withdrawn to prevent injury to the lung as it expands to appose the parietal pleura. The fluid is then aspirated into collection bottles.

### **21** Technique for Tube Thoracostomy

![](_page_42_Picture_3.jpeg)

**1.** Skin incision. One percent lidocaine is used for local anesthesia. A subcutaneous wheal is raised over the fifth or sixth intercostal space in the midaxillary line. The needle is passed to the upper border of the rib and the periosteum is anesthetized. Fluid should be aspirated from an effusion to confirm its location. A 1 cm incision is then made.

**2.** Pleural entry. The dissection is carried down to and through the intercostal muscles with a Kelly clamp, the parietal pleura is penetrated, and the pleural cavity is entered. Finger dissection should be used only if loculations are known to be present.

**3.** Chest tube placement. The chest tube is inserted and directed towards the apex for air and posteriorly for fluid. The tube should be clamped during insertion if fluid is being drained. The tube is then secured with a 2‐0 silk suture. A trocar should **never** be used to penetrate the pleura.
