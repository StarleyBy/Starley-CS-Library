## **5** Cardiopulmonary Bypass

Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is a form of extracorporeal circulation provided by a heart– lung machine that provides systemic perfusion of oxygenated blood during open‐heart surgery. It is utilized for "on‐pump" coronary bypass surgery and is required for all types of "surgical" valve and aortic procedures. Vascular access for the CPB circuit may vary, depending on the operative approach, but the technology and physiologic concepts remain virtually the same. Although there has been a significant trend toward "minimally invasive" approaches for many types of cardiac surgery, including transcatheter valve procedures, off‐pump bypass surgery, and endovascular procedures, CPB remains an essential element of cardiac surgical practice. Additional applications of CPB, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), have been invaluable in improving outcomes in patients with cardiogenic shock after surgery and other clinical situations requiring cardiac or respiratory support.

#### **I. General Comments**

- **A.** CPB (the "pump") involves an extracorporeal circuit that drains blood from the venous system and returns oxygenated blood to the systemic circulation when the heart and lungs are not functional. CPB is accompanied by normovolemic hemodilution and nonpulsatile flow.1
- **B.** The contact of blood with the extracorporeal circuit generates a systemic inflammatory response that is related to a multitude of pathophysiologic factors. CPB results in the activation of numerous cascades, including the kallikrein, coagulation, and complement systems.2,3 These may cause thrombin generation, the release of proinflammatory cytokines, and a systemic inflammatory response. Endothelial‐based reactions, including platelet adhesion, aggregation, and activation, as well as leukocyte adhesion and activation, have been implicated in myocardial reperfusion damage, pulmonary and renal dysfunction, neurocognitive changes, and a generalized capillary leak.
- **C.** Use of membrane oxygenators, biocompatible circuits and centrifugal pumps, adopting a restrictive transfusion threshold, avoiding cardiotomy suction, and equivocally use of leukocyte filters and steroids may reduce some of these inflammatory responses to CPB.4–9 Most patients will experience few adverse effects from the systemic inflammatory response, but those with long pump runs or with significant hemodynamic issues following surgery may experience significant tissue edema and organ system dysfunction that may persist for days.

### **II. The Cardiopulmonary Bypass Circuit**

- **A.** The extracorporeal circuit consists of polyvinylchloride tubing and polycarbonate connectors. Circuits with heparin coating (most commonly the Medtronic Cortiva BioActive Surface and Trillium Biosurface polymer coating circuits) have been shown to improve biocompatibility, which reduces complement, leukocyte, and platelet activation, and lessens the release of proinflammatory mediators.8,9 Although biocompatible circuits may reduce bleeding, atrial fibrillation, tissue edema, and the degree of pulmonary dysfunction, other clinical benefits of their anti‐inflammatory properties are modest. Studies have not shown that these circuits decrease thrombin generation, which is a marker of coagulation system activation and a trigger of endothelial cell dysfunction.
- **B.** The bypass circuit is a potent activator of the coagulation system with generation of factor Xa and thrombin, which may contribute to a systemic inflammatory response and ischemia/reperfusion injury.10 Anticoagulation, generally with heparin, is essential during CPB to minimize activation of the coagulation system, thrombus formation, and fibrinolysis.11 Use of heparin‐coated circuits allows for the safe use of lower doses of heparin, which might be associated with less bleeding.12,13 A number of factors associated with the use of CPB, including hemodilution of clotting factors and platelets, platelet dysfunction, and fibrinolysis, may contribute to a coagulopathy.
- **C.** The pump is primed with a balanced electrolyte solution, such as Lactated Ringer's, Normosol, or Plasmalyte, although normal saline may be used in patients with chronic kidney disease to reduce the potassium load associated with the use of cardioplegia solutions. The average priming volume is about 1000–1500 mL. A colloid, usually albumin, is usually not added to the pump prime, but it may be given during the pump run to increase oncotic pressure and reduce fluid requirements, thus decreasing extravascular lung water. It may also ameliorate bleeding by delaying fibrinogen absorption and reducing platelet activation.14 The use of acute normovolemic hemodilution reduces blood loss and the number of blood transfusions required.15
- **D.** Miniaturized circuits with lower priming volumes (500–800 mL) minimize hemodilution and reduce the blood–artificial surface interface, possibly minimizing the inflammatory response. These systems also allow for centrifugation of shed blood for retransfusion to reduce blood activation and lipid embolism. Studies using these circuits have demonstrated improved clinical outcomes, with decreased transfusion rates, lower troponin release, a reduced incidence of neurologic damage and atrial fibrillation, and a shorter duration of ventilation. The decrease in the inflammatory response may be equivalent to that seen during off‐pump surgery.16,17 However, these circuits do lower the safety margins for volume loss and air emboli, and make weaning and termination of bypass more difficult because of low volume reserve in the system.
- **E.** The establishment of CPB involves the drainage of venous blood from the right atrium or venae cavae into a hardshell cardiotomy reservoir or bag. This usually occurs by gravity, but it may also occur by vacuum‐assisted drainage. The blood then passes through an antifoam and sock filter into the oxygenator attached to a heater/cooler unit, and is returned to the arterial system through a filter using either a roller or, preferably, a centrifugal pump.
  - **1.** In a closed reservoir system, which contains a collapsible bag, air passing through the venous lines can be vented through ports at the top of the bag. In a hardshell open system, air can potentially get entrained into the oxygenator if the cardiotomy

- volume is too low, so low‐volume alarms must be utilized and keen attention paid to reservoir volumes.
- **2.** Active venous drainage using vacuum assist or kinetic assist (with a centrifugal pump) can be used to augment venous drainage.18,19 This is valuable during minimally invasive procedures or when small venous catheters are utilized. The least amount of negative pressure necessary to augment drainage should be used, although a pressure up to −60 mm Hg is acceptable. Vacuum assist causes an insignificant degree of hemolysis and may reduce hemodilution and transfusion requirements. However, one must always consider the possibility of venous air entrainment and undetected air microembolism when this technique is utilized. Excessive vacuum may pull air retrograde through the oxygenator membrane, causing depriming of a centrifugal pump. Monitoring for gaseous emboli on both the venous and arterial side should be utilized to minimize these risks.
- **F.** Centrifugal pumps have replaced roller pumps to provide systemic flow in most current systems. Both provide nonpulsatile flow, unless additional technology is utilized to provide pulsatile flow. Roller pumps are pressure‐insensitive and can pressurize the arterial line in the face of outflow obstruction. Centrifugal pumps are afterload‐sensitive, such that they will reduce flow if outflow is obstructed. Centrifugal pumps cause less blood trauma than roller pumps, but the inflammatory response and effects on perioperative bleeding are fairly similar with both types of pumps.20,21 Roller pumps are used, however, for suction lines and cardioplegia delivery (Figure 5.1).
- **G.** Oxygenators have integral heater–cooler coils which are located proximal to the oxygenator to minimize gas embolization. A separate heater–cooler unit is utilized to control the temperature of the arterial inflow to provide systemic warming and cooling. In 2015, the FDA published an alert that contamination occurring during manufacturing of the Sorin 3T heater–cooler units caused delayed sternal wound infections with *Mycoplasma chimaera*, leading to recommendations for strict adherence to instructions about the maintenance and cleaning of these units.
- **H.** Suction lines return extravasated blood from the surgical field to the cardiotomy reservoir to conserve blood and blood elements and to maintain pump volume.
  - **1.** Despite the nearly universal use of these suction lines, the benefits of blood salvage into the pump may be offset by the adverse effects of the aspirated blood. Studies have shown that blood in contact with tissue factor in the pericardium is replete with fat and procoagulant and proinflammatory mediators, such as complement and cytokines.22–25 Thus, aspirated blood is a significant activator of coagulation, causing increased generation of thrombin and complement that promote inflammation, and is a major cause of hemolysis. Cytokines may contribute to increased perioperative bleeding and neurologic sequelae. Elimination of cardiotomy suction may reduce thrombin generation, platelet activation, and the systemic inflammatory response.25 Notably, return of cardiotomy suction into the circuit usually causes systemic hypotension, most likely because of the high levels of inflammatory mediators present.
  - **2.** The routine use of cell‐saving devices to aspirate and wash shed blood can preserve red cells while eliminating many of these inflammatory mediators while also removing fat from the blood. However, centrifugation of shed blood does remove coagulation factors and platelets from the blood. Most surgeons continue to use cardiotomy suction while still using cell‐saving devices.26

**Figure 5.1 •** The basics of a "closed" extracorporeal circuit. Blood drains through the venous line (A) into a venous reservoir bag (B), while blood from vent lines and the cardiotomy sucker (C) are actively suctioned using a roller pump (D) into a cardiotomy reservoir (E), which drains into the venous reservoir. The blood is then pumped by a centrifugal pump (F) through an integrated oxygenator–heat exchanger unit (G) and returned through an arterial filter (H) to the arterial circulation (I). For blood cardioplegia setups, a mixture of blood from the oxygenator and a stock cardioplegia solution is pumped through a roller pump head (J) using different size tubing (depending on the mixture ratio) and returned to the ascending aorta for antegrade cardioplegia delivery (K) and the coronary sinus for retrograde cardioplegia. The heater–cooler system is used for systemic and cardioplegia temperature management (L).

- **I.** An additional suction line can be connected to an intracardiac vent, draining blood from the left ventricle (LV) or other cardiac chamber into the reservoir by active suctioning by a roller pump head. These lines are useful in providing ventricular decompression and/or improving surgical exposure. Active root venting should be used in all valve cases upon weaning from CPB to evacuate ejected air.
- **J.** Oxygen and compressed air pass into the oxygenator from a blender which regulates oxygen concentration by adjusting the FiO2 and determines the gas flow by adjusting a "sweep rate". The sweep rate is generally maintained at slightly less than the systemic flow rate to eliminate CO2 from the blood to achieve a desired value (generally around 40–50 mm Hg). To minimize blood activation, the oxygenator may be coated with heparin or Trillium to improve biocompatibility.27
- **K.** The pump setup includes a separate heat exchanger for cardioplegia delivery. Tubes of differing diameters are passed through the same roller pump head, delivering a preselected ratio of pump volume to cardioplegia solution (such as 4:1). The final mixture then passes through this heat exchanger for the delivery of cold or warm cardioplegia. Pressure monitoring of infusion pressure is essential, especially for retrograde delivery, which generally provides about 200 mL/min of flow at a pressure that should not exceed 40 mm Hg to prevent coronary sinus rupture. Very high line pressures indicate obstruction to flow, either because the line is clamped or kinked or because the cardioplegia catheter is obstructed. A low line pressure generally indicates misplacement of the catheter, either back into the right atrium or from perforation of the coronary sinus. Microplegia systems (such as the Quest MPS system) minimize the volume of crystalloid vehicle required during cardioplegia delivery. They mix the essential cardioplegia contents (primarily potassium and magnesium) with the blood in a specified ratio that is then delivered to the heart. This allows for a large amount of cardioplegia to be delivered with minimal hemodilution.
- **L.** Additional features of the CPB circuit usually include the following:
  - **1.** In‐line monitoring of arterial and venous blood gases, electrolytes, hematocrit, and temperatures at multiple sites simultaneously. The last of these is useful during deep hypothermia cases.
  - **2.** An arterial line filter (usually 40 μm), which is essential to remove microemboli before blood is returned to the patient. Microemboli may consist of air, blood, or platelet microaggregates, or other particulate matter. Fat microemboli are found in abundance in cardiotomy suction and can be removed by 20 μm filters. Large emboli may become fractionated before reaching the arterial line filter, and then may not be completely removed.
  - **3.** Recirculation lines to allow for venting of air and to prevent stagnation of blood. This is essential during circulatory arrest cases and when direct thrombin inhibitors are used for anticoagulation in patients with heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia.
  - **4.** Hemofilters or hemoconcentrators, which can be placed in the circuit to remove excessive volume in patients with preexisting fluid overload or renal dysfunction. Modified ultrafiltration (MUF) at the end of the pump run can hemoconcentrate the pump contents by pumping blood from the arterial cannula through the concentrator for retransfusion through the venous cannula into the right atrium.28

- **5.** A cell‐saving device into which blood is scavenged from the operative field to be centrifuged, washed, and collected in a bag. This can then be drained into the cardiotomy device for transfusion during CPB or after CPB is terminated, or placed in a transfer bag and given to the anesthesiologist for infusion. This has been shown to decrease blood transfusion requirements during cardiac surgical procedures.26
- **M.** A detailed checklist must be utilized by the perfusionist before every case to make sure that no detail is overlooked. The patient's life depends on the perfusionist and proper function of the heart–lung machine. Accurate record keeping during bypass is essential (Figure 5.2 and 5.3).

#### **III. Anticoagulation and Cannulation for Bypass**

- **A. Anticoagulation.** Prior to cannulation, achievement of adequate anticoagulation is essential to minimize thrombus formation on the cannulas and within the extracorporeal circuit (see also pages 250–251).1
  - **1.** Unfractionated heparin may be administered in a dose of 3–4 mg/kg for uncoated circuits with monitoring of its anticoagulant effect by the activated clotting time (ACT).11 A blood sample is drawn 3–5 minutes after heparin administration and

- should achieve an ACT >480 seconds in non‐heparin‐coated circuits and an ACT >400 seconds in heparin‐coated circuits. Patients with heparin resistance may require more heparin or administration of other blood products (2–4 units of fresh frozen plasma, antithrombin (AT) 500–1000 units) or even bivalirudin to achieve adequate anticoagulation (see page 251).29–32 Common systems to measure ACTs include the Hepcon (Medtronic), Hemochron (Accriva Diagnostics), and i‐STAT (Abbott) devices.
- **2.** Because of patient variability in response to heparin and the effects of hypothermia and hemodilution on the ACT, the correlation between ACTs and the level of thrombin markers is imprecise. Using the Medtronic Heparin Hemostasis Management System (HMS), an individual dose–response curve can be generated which calculates the precise amount of heparin necessary to achieve a specified ACT. Monitoring of heparin concentrations is important during CPB as this may reduce heparin over‐ or underdosing and has been shown to reduce thrombin generation, fibrinolysis, and neutrophil activation.33 A level of ≥2.0 units/mL is recommended. During off‐pump surgery, the ACT should reach 250 seconds because the coronary artery being bypassed is usually occluded during the procedure.
- **B.** In a patient with documented **heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)**, an alternative means of anticoagulation must be sought. Although one can give an antiplatelet medication (glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor or a prostaglandin analog) with heparin during bypass, the preferred approach is to use bivalirudin, a short‐acting direct thrombin inhibitor, to avoid heparin entirely.34,35 This issue is discussed in more detail on pages 251–253.
- **C. Antifibrinolytic drugs.** CPB is associated with a variety of abnormalities in coagulation, among which is fibrinolysis. ε‐aminocaproic acid (Amicar) and tranexamic acid decrease fibrinolysis by inhibiting plasminogen activation and through antiplasmin activity. When given prior to going on bypass and during the pump run, they have both been demonstrated to reduce perioperative bleeding. Although a variety of different dosing regimens are used, ε‐aminocaproic acid is usually given in a dose of 10 g intravenously (IV) with 5–10 g in the pump prime. A common dose of tranexamic acid is 10 mg/kg with 1 mg/kg/h infusion during surgery (see page 249).36,37 Although many groups give the initial dose of antifibrinolytic medication prior to skin incision, it may be best to defer the bolus dose until after heparinization, to avoid a transient procoagulant state.38
- **D. Arterial cannulation** is usually accomplished by placement of a cannula in the ascending aorta just proximal to the innominate artery (Figure 5.4). Cannula size is determined by the anticipated flow rate for the patient based on body surface area, so as to minimize line pressure and shear forces (Table 5.1).
  - **1.** Cannula designs have been modified in a variety of ways to minimize shear forces and jet effects on the aortic wall (Figure 5.5). Most commonly used are those with end holes and/or multiple side holes through which blood exits at lower velocity (the Medtronic EOPA and Soft‐flow cannulas).39
  - **2.** Steps to prevent systemic embolization, primarily to the brain, are imperative when CPB is used during surgery. Although gaseous microembolization can be addressed by improvements in CPB technology, cannulation and clamping are the primary causes of atheroembolism and stroke. Although most surgeons palpate the proposed

Note that smaller venous cannulas can be used when vacuum-assisted drainage is employed BSA, body surface area  $(m^2)$ 

cannulation site in the ascending aorta to assess for the presence of atherosclerotic plaque and calcification, this is a very insensitive means of detecting plaque. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) may identify protruding atheromas, but epiaortic imaging is the gold standard for identifying plaque and may lead to modification of the surgical approach.  $^{40\text{--}42}$  Cannulas with attached intra-aortic filtration devices (Embol-X catheter) and suction-based extraction devices have been devised to trap embolic material upon unclamping with equivocal benefits.  $^{43\text{--}45}$ 

3. If ascending aortic cannulation is not feasible, an alternative cannulation site must be sought. Femoral artery cannulation, either percutaneously or via cutdown, is feasible if aortoiliac atherosclerosis is not severe and the TEE does not demonstrate significant descending aortic atherosclerosis which could produce retrograde cerebral embolization and stroke. In fact, one study of reoperative mitral valve surgery demonstrated a greater than fourfold incidence of stroke comparing retrograde arterial perfusion to central cannulation.<sup>46</sup> Femoral cannulation also

- runs the risk of a retrograde dissection. Satisfactory flow into the cannula must be assured before connecting the cannula to the CPB circuit. After decannulation, distal flow must be confirmed after the femoral access site has been repaired.
- **4.** Although central aortic cannulation can be accomplished in many types of minimally invasive surgery, femoral arterial cannulation is commonly used. In these patients, it is important to assess the patient's iliofemoral system prior to surgery to identify whether femoral artery cannulation will be feasible. Furthermore, when a long duration of CPB is anticipated (complex minimally invasive or robotic surgery), there is an increased risk of a lower‐extremity compartment syndrome from ischemia/reperfusion injury.47–50 In these situations, options include placing the cannula percutaneously, placing it using the Seldinger technique to allow some distal flow, placing it through a sidearm graft sewn to the femoral artery to ensure distal flow, or placing an additional small cannula to provide distal perfusion.
- **5.** If femoral cannulation is not feasible, or for surgery of the ascending aorta and arch, cannulation of the distal subclavian/axillary artery is an excellent alternative (Figure 5.6).51 This may be performed directly through an arteriotomy or preferably through an 8 mm sidearm graft anastomosed to the vessel, which provides distal arm circulation during bypass. With snaring of the proximal innominate artery, axillary cannulation allows for selective antegrade brain perfusion during deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA). In these cases, additional cannulation of the left carotid artery may also be considered.52–54
- **6.** Either femoral or axillary arterial cannulation should be immediately available when there is concern about potential cardiac, aortic, or graft damage during resternotomy or for patients with ruptured ascending aortic aneurysms or aortic dissections with hemopericardium. The artery should be exposed and occasionally may need to be cannulated, either for immediate initiation of bypass if problems are encountered after sternotomy or, on occasion, to initiate bypass and systemic cooling before the sternotomy is performed, depending on the patient's clinical condition.

**Figure 5.6 •** Axillary artery cannulation. An 8 mm side graft is sewn to the distal subclavian/axillary artery, into which the cannula is placed and secured in position.

- **7.** In patients developing hemodynamic instability during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) despite pharmacologic management, an intra‐aortic balloon pump is usually placed first for additional support. If the patient remains unstable, develops refractory arrhythmias, or has a cardiac arrest or life‐threatening tamponade, institution of CPB may be life‐saving. Use of 15 Fr arterial and 17 Fr venous cannulas placed through a percutaneous transfemoral approach can allow for systemic flow rates of up to 2.5 L/min while problems are rectified.
- **E. Venous drainage** for most open‐heart surgery is accomplished with a double‐ or triple‐stage cavoatrial cannula (Figure 5.7). This is placed through the right atrial appendage or right atrial free wall with the distal end situated in the inferior vena cava (IVC) (Figure 5.8A). Blood drains from the IVC through several apertures near the end and from the right atrium through additional side holes. These catheters are used for most procedures that do not require opening of the right heart. The triple‐ stage cannula provides excellent flow and allows for use of a smaller outer‐diameter cannula, especially with vacuum‐assisted drainage.
  - **1.** Mitral valve surgery may be accomplished using a double‐ or triple‐staged cannula or with bicaval cannulation, the latter being required if a biatrial transseptal approach is planned. Tricuspid valve surgery through a sternotomy incision is performed using bicaval cannulation with placement of caval snares around the cannulas to prevent air entry into the venous lines. A cannula may be placed directly into the superior vena cava (SVC) or passed through the right atrial appendage into the SVC. The IVC cannula is placed through a pursestring suture low in the right atrial free wall (Figure 5.8B).
  - **2.** Femoral venous cannulation is used in robotic and minimally invasive cases and may be supplemented by a 15 or 17 Fr venous line placed into the internal jugular vein. The femoral catheter is 50 cm long and is passed through the femoral vein

(B) Bicaval cannulation. The SVC cannula may be placed into the SVC directly or via the right atrial appendage. The IVC cannula is placed through a pursestring low on the right atrial free wall.

to lie within the right atrium to ensure adequate venous drainage. Shorter venous catheters can be used, if necessary. Exposure of the femoral vein or even cannulation and establishment of CPB may also be used in high‐risk situations of hemodynamic instability or redo surgery. Minimally invasive tricuspid valve surgery can also be performed using femoral venous drainage. The transfemoral catheter is withdrawn into the IVC and the IVC is snared. An additional drainage catheter is placed in the SVC either directly or through the right atrium and the SVC is snared to eliminate air entry into the venous line. This is usually supplemented with vacuum‐assisted drainage. In redo cases, the cannula may be left in the SVC and snares are not necessary.55

- **3.** Femoral arterial and venous cannulation have been used to systemically warm patients presenting with profound accidental hypothermia and can be used in emergency situations, such as cardiac arrest, to establish an ECMO circuit (see pages 312–315 and 563–565).
- **F. Cannulation for cardioplegia administration.** Antegrade cardioplegia is delivered through a catheter placed in the aortic root just proximal to the position of the aortic cross‐clamp. This should provide the best myocardial protection in the absence of coronary disease. A retrograde catheter is routinely used to augment

protection and ease the flow of an operation. It is very useful in patients with coronary disease and those with severe aortic regurgitation in whom antegrade cardioplegia cannot be delivered into the root (it can subsequently be given directly into the coronary ostia). The catheter is placed through a pursestring suture in the right atrial free wall, although some surgeons open the right atrium to place the catheter under direct vision, and place a suture around the coronary sinus ostium to optimize flow. Cannulas are held in position within the sinus with a balloon which may be self‐inflating or manually inflated which allows for pressure measurements near the tip of the catheter to prevent overpressurization and potential coronary sinus rupture.56

**G.** Figure 5.9 provides an illustration of cannulation and clamping for a routine on‐pump coronary bypass operation.

#### **IV. Initiation and Conduct of Cardiopulmonary Bypass (Table 5.2)**

- **A. Retrograde autologous priming (RAP)** along with venous antegrade priming (VAP) can be used to reduce the hemodilutional effects of the priming solution and maintain a higher hematocrit on pump. The process involves back‐draining the arterial line, then the venous reservoir and oxygenator, and then the venous line to remove about 1100 mL of crystalloid from the pump setup prior to initiating bypass. Simultaneously, an α‐agent may be given to maintain systemic pressure. RAP does maintain a higher oncotic pressure during the pump run and has been shown to minimize the accumulation of extravascular lung water and postoperative weight gain. It may also improve tissue perfusion on pump leading to lower lactate levels. It is probably most beneficial in small patients with low blood volumes and low hematocrits, and might be considered in patients who refuse transfusions ( Jehovah Witnesses). Although the impact of RAP on clinical outcomes is not significant, it may reduce the overall number of transfusions required.57–61
- **B. Systemic pressures and flows.** When pump flow is initiated, the patient's pulsatile perfusion is replaced by nonpulsatile flow. The blood pressure initially decreases from hemodilution with a reduction in blood viscosity. The mean arterial pressure should then be maintained between 50 and 70 mm Hg during the pump run. It may transiently decrease during cardioplegia delivery (probably from potassium delivery into the systemic circulation), from return of large volumes of cardiotomy suction (from inflammatory mediators), and during rewarming (from vasodilation). Blood pressure may rise due to vasoconstriction from hypothermia, and from dilution of narcotics by the pump prime.

- **1.** The systemic flow rate is calculated based on the patient's body surface area and is modified by the degree of hypothermia and the venous oxygen saturation (SvO2 ). It should also take into account the degree of anemia, which can influence whole‐body oxygen delivery. The flow rate should exceed 2 L/min/m2 at normothermia and can be reduced to 1.5–1.7 L/min/m2 at 30 °C with "low flow" bypass. Flow needs to be increased during rewarming, when increased metabolism usually decreases the SvO2 . Low‐flow bypass during moderate hypothermia has been shown to improve myocardial protection, reduce collateral flow improving exposure, reduce hemolysis, and reduce fluid requirements without any compromise in tissue perfusion.62
- **2.** The optimal flow rate should be based on an assessment of adequate oxygen delivery. Means of assessing this include the SvO2 , blood lactate levels, and in‐line monitoring of CO2 production.63 The latter two together may be the best way of predicting anaerobic metabolism, which is not assessed by the SvO2 . Nonetheless, in most practices, as long as the SvO2 exceeds 65%, the flow rate is considered adequate, although this may not reflect regional flow.64,65
  - **a.** For example, at normothermia, the brain and kidney autoregulate to maintain perfusion as the flow rate is reduced at the expense of skeletal muscle and splanchnic flow. Due to concerns that the combination of hemodilution and a lower flow rate may reduce the mean arterial pressure below the autoregulatory threshold and compromise organ system function, there are proponents of using "high flow" (2–2.4 L/min/m2 ) rather than "low flow" bypass during hypothermia. Hypothermia may cause more regional variation in flow.65
  - **b.** CPB has significant adverse effects on renal perfusion, filtration, and oxygenation.66–68 Renal blood flow is determined primarily by the systemic flow rate, but hypothermia impairs renal autoregulation and induces renal vasoconstriction. This results in blood being shunted away from the kidneys while the glomerular filtrate rate and renal oxygen consumption remain unchanged. Thus, renal oxygen extraction increases significantly as there is a significant mismatch between oxygen supply and demand that is exacerbated by the anemia of hemodilution. One study demonstrated that renal function was not affected by using lower target blood pressures on CPB (<60 mm Hg vs. 60–69 mm Hg vs. >70 mm Hg), although urine output was less at the lower pressures.69 It does appear, however, that lower systemic flow rates and low hematocrits do adversely affect renal function, so in older patients, those with known chronic kidney disease, and with longer pump runs, maintenance of higher flow rates and a hematocrit above 21% may minimize the risk of acute kidney injury.67–73
- **3.** One of the primary concerns with CPB is maintenance of adequate cerebral oxygenation, which is determined by the blood pressure, the systemic flow rate, and the pCO2 . Cerebral autoregulation allows for maintenance of cerebral blood flow down to a mean arterial pressure as low as 40–50 mm Hg, but autoregulation may be inadequate in hypertensive or diabetic patients, in whom it may be desirable to maintain a higher pressure.74 In fact, some studies have shown that cerebral oxygenation is impaired at this level even if the flow rate is satisfactory, so the blood pressure must be maintained at an adequate level regardless of the flow rate, usually using vasopressors, such as phenylephrine, norepinephrine, or vasopressin.75 This may improve cerebral oxygenation but reduce flow to other regions, specifically the kidneys and splanchnic viscera.

- **4.** The adequacy of cerebral oxygenation during CPB is usually assessed by cerebral oximetry using bifrontal sensors with near‐infrared spectroscopy. Numerous products are available, including the INVOS (Medtronic), Equanox (NONIN Medical), and ForeSight (Edwards) cerebral oximeters (see Figure 4.9, page 255). The regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2 ) tends to fall during initiation of bypass and during rewarming, even with an increase in systemic flow. The rSO2 promptly detects problems with arterial desaturation even before it is evident by pulse oximetry.76 Studies have demonstrated that oxygen desaturation is associated with an increased incidence of neurocognitive changes.77 If the oxygen saturation falls more than 20% below baseline or below 40%, an intervention is recommended to restore cerebral blood flow. Before initiating bypass, an increase in blood pressure or an elevation in PCO2 will be effective in increasing cerebral blood flow. Once on bypass, modifications of flow rate, blood pressure, PCO2 , or the hematocrit are beneficial. This technology may also alert the cardiac surgical team to potential catastrophes associated with brain malperfusion from cannula malplacement, dissections, oxygenator or other pump‐related failures, air embolism, anaphylactic reactions (such as from protamine), and monitoring problems. Although interventions to improve rSO2 should intuitively reduce the adverse effects of cerebral oxygen desaturation, few studies have documented improvements in clinical outcome.78
- **C.** Both the **hematocrit (HCT)** on pump and the systemic flow rate determine the amount of oxygen delivery to the body. Hemodilution from the pump prime commonly reduces oxygen delivery by 25% as estimated from the following equation:

$$Predicted\ HCT\ on\ pump = \frac{\left(70 \times kg \times preop\ HCT/100\right)}{\left(70 \times kg\right) + prime\ volume + IV\ fluids\ pre-CPB}$$

where 70 × kg equals the blood volume and 70 × kg × preoperative HCT is the RBC volume.

- **1.** Hemodilution reduces blood viscosity and improves microcirculatory flow, but at the extremes of hemodilution, there is a significant reduction in oncotic pressure that increases fluid requirements. This can exacerbate the systemic inflammatory response and capillary leak, causing substantial tissue edema. This may contribute to cerebral edema, papilledema, and ischemic optic neuropathy,79 and can lead to respiratory compromise, among other adverse effects.
- **2.** Very low hematocrits on pump have been associated with increased mortality and an increase in the incidence of renal dysfunction, stroke, and prolonged mechanical ventilation.71,72,80 Profound anemia will compromise oxygen delivery despite adequate systemic flow rates and may lead to ischemic organ system damage that at its extreme can produce life‐threatening complications, such as mesenteric ischemia. Although the acceptable lower limit for a hematocrit on pump has been considered 18% according to the STS guidelines,81 numerous studies have shown that the risk of renal dysfunction increases below a hematocrit of 21%, and if that is considered a surrogate for organ system malperfusion, it is feasible to recommend that 21% should be the limit below which transfusion is indicated.69–72 However, transfusions are not benign: administering blood to raise the hematocrit

- to over 24% offers little advantage during bypass and may prove deleterious because of immunomodulatory effects and other potential adverse organ system sequelae of transfusions.
- **D. Temperature management.** The systemic temperature may be maintained at normothermia or at varying degrees of hypothermia, depending on the surgeon's preference and the operative procedure. Most surgeons use moderate hypothermia to 34–35 °C to provide some organ system protection during nonpulsatile perfusion and also in the event that a temporary problem arises with surgery (need to reduce flow to place sutures) or with perfusion (impaired drainage, low blood pressure, air embolism, pump head failure, oxygenator failure, etc.). No conclusive advantage of using either normothermic or hypothermic bypass has been established in terms of inflammatory activation, perioperative hemostasis, or neurocognitive outcome.82 However, the rate of rewarming and its extent may affect neurocognitive outcome.83,84 The STS guidelines suggest that the oxygenator arterial outlet temperature is a surrogate for cerebral temperature measurements even though it underestimates the cerebral perfusate temperature. It is recommended the outlet temperature be kept at less than 37 °C during rewarming. When the patient's arterial temperature is ≥30 °C, the difference between the arterial outlet and venous inflow temperatures should be ≤4 °C; when the patient's temperature is <30 °C, the gradient should be no more than 10° to minimize generation of gaseous emboli (during cooling) or "outgassing" when blood is returned to the patient upon warming.84
- **E. Gas exchange.** Oxygenation and elimination of CO2 are determined by the sweep rate, which is adjusted on the blender. Most oxygenators are not stressed until the flow rate exceeds 7 L/min, which should be adequate for even a 175 kg patient. The PO2 should be maintained above 250 torr in the event of a temporary reduction in flow or pump malfunction, and can be monitored in‐line or by intermittent blood gases every 30 minutes. Inhalational anesthetics, such as sevoflurane, desflurane, or isoflurane, are administered through the blender and must be scavenged via the oxygenator.
- **F. Ventilation.** Upon initiation of full flow on bypass, ventilation is stopped. Although ventilation or use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during bypass may improve pulmonary function and gas exchange with less release of inflammatory mediators, this is not a common practice.85,86
- **G. pH management.** With progressive hypothermia, CO2 production decreases and pH normally rises. With mild or moderate hypothermia, pH is generally maintained between 7.40 and 7.50 by adjusting the sweep rate and maintaining the PCO2 around 40–50 torr. Evidence of metabolic acidosis on pump may be a sign of inadequate tissue oxygenation despite normal blood gases. Regional hypoperfusion, especially of the splanchnic bed, may be contributory to this problem. In fact, lactate release with levels greater than 4 mmol/L during reperfusion is predictive of an increased risk of complications and death.87,88 During deep hypothermia, two pH management strategies can be used. With pH‐stat, the pH is temperature‐corrected and maintained at 7.40 by adding a mixture of O2 and CO2 ("carbogen") to the circuit. With this strategy, there is an increase in cerebral blood flow with a potentially increased risk of cerebral microembolism. This strategy is associated with improved tissue oxygenation during hypothermia.89 In contrast, with α‐stat, the pH is maintained at 7.40 measured at 37 °C (i.e. not temperature‐corrected). Cerebral blood flow is autoregulated and coupled to cerebral oxygen demand. The latter strategy is preferred during DHCA cases.90,91

- **H. Medications** to maintain anesthesia or to control blood pressure are given into a sampling manifold that flows into the venous reservoir. Medications that may be given by the perfusionist into the circuit during bypass include mannitol, insulin, sodium bicarbonate, calcium chloride, magnesium sulfate, antibiotics, vasopressors, and inotropes.
- **I.** Intermittent measurements of serum potassium, glucose, and hematocrit should be performed in addition to arterial and venous blood gases and ACTs. This should be performed using point‐of‐care machines in the operating room. Commonly used systems include the Siemens RAPIDpoint and the i‐STAT handheld system (Figure 5.10). An elevated potassium may necessitate a change in the composition or frequency of cardioplegia delivery and may require administration of diuretics or insulin for control. An elevated glucose is related to increased levels of endogenous epinephrine and insulin resistance and may be associated with an increased risk of neurologic injury.3 Blood glucose should generally be maintained at a level below 180 mg/dL, but excessively stringent control (glucose <100 mg/dL) may be more harmful than beneficial.92–94

#### **V. Terminating Bypass**

- **A.** Before terminating bypass, the patient should be warmed toward normothermia (to at least 36 °C). As noted above, the rate of rewarming should be appropriate and cerebral hyperthermia should be avoided, as both may affect neurocognitive outcome.84
- **B.** The lungs are ventilated, taking care to identify the course of the internal thoracic artery (ITA) to avoid tension on the ITA pedicle. Pacing is initiated, if necessary.

- Calcium chloride 1 g may be given prior to coming off bypass to provide an increase in systemic vascular resistance and some inotropic support. The heart is filled by restricting venous return as bypass flow is reduced and turned off by the perfusionist. Active root venting is used in cases of intracardiac entry (primarily valve operations) to evacuate any ejected air with the patient in the Trendelenburg position.
- **C.** Cardiac performance is assessed by incorporating visual assessment with echocardiographic imaging, filling pressures, and cardiac output measurements. Inotropic support should be considered for marginal cardiac performance. Low systemic resistance is common and α‐agents or vasopressin may be necessary to improve the blood pressure. In primarily valve cases, right ventricular (RV) dysfunction from coronary air embolism is not uncommon, and bypass occasionally must be resumed for a short period of time until myocardial function improves. Insertion of an intra‐aortic balloon may be necessary if cardiac performance is suboptimal on multiple inotropic medications. Attention should be paid to the ECG monitor to identify ischemic changes that may require revision of the procedure.
- **D.** When the patient is stable, protamine is administered to reverse any heparin effect and should return the ACT to normal. The dosage is commonly based on a 1:1 mg:mg ratio to the administered heparin, although with use of the HMS system, which measures heparin levels, a heparin–protamine titration test can be used to determine the actual heparin concentration in the blood and the precise dose of protamine needed to reverse its effects. A protamine reaction is uncommon, but can be life‐threatening (see pages 260–261). It requires immediate attention and occasionally the reinstitution of CPB after the re‐administration of heparin. Ongoing bleeding may be surgical in etiology, but the availability of routine coagulation studies and particularly thromboelastography may be helpful in ascertaining the exact nature of a hemostatic problem.95
- **E.** The suction lines are turned off once the protamine administration has started. The venous line is removed first and drained into the cardiotomy reservoir. Blood may then be transfused through the arterial cannula as needed to maintain filling pressures. Once the aorta is decannulated and the patient is stable, the pump contents are drained into a cell‐saving device, centrifuged and washed, and made available in transfer bags for the anesthesiologist to transfuse as necessary.
- **F.** The cannulation sites are secured. Hemostasis is then achieved and the chest is closed. Issues related to perioperative bleeding are discussed in detail in Chapter 9.

#### **VI. Potential Problems Encountered During Cardiopulmonary Bypass and upon Weaning from Bypass (Table 5.3)**

**A. Inadequate ACT** from standard doses of heparin usually results from antithrombin (AT) deficiency. AT is a major inhibitor of thrombin and factors Xa and IXa, and its deficiency leads to a hypercoagulable state. The basis for anticoagulation with heparin is the rapid activation of AT inhibitory activity. AT deficiency results in resistance to treatment with heparin and is noted most frequently in patients maintained preoperatively on heparin therapy or intravenous nitroglycerin or those with high platelet counts.96 Additional administration of 1–2 mg/kg of heparin will usually achieve an adequate ACT. If not, AT can be provided by transfusion of fresh frozen plasma or,

#### **Table 5.3 • Potential Problems on Pump and on Weaning from Bypass**

- A. Inadequate heparinization (low ACT)
- B. Inadequate venous drainage
- C. Distention of the heart (right and left)
- D. Air entry into the venous lines
- E. Inadequate systemic pressures
- F. Vasoplegia post‐pump
- G. Inadequate systemic oxygenation
- H. High arterial line pressure

if available, by a commercial AT product (Thrombate III), which provides 500 units per vial.29–31 Because preoperative AT levels are rarely known, the exact dose required to reach 120% of normal, which is recommended, can only be estimated. Studies have shown successful elevation of the ACT using a wide dosage range of AT doses to as high as 75 units/kg. The calculation of the amount needed equals the (desired − baseline AT level) × weight (kg) divided by 1.4. For example, to reach 120% of normal levels in a 70 kg man with a baseline level that is 80% of normal would require ([120 − 80]/1.4) × 70 = 2000 units (or 28 units/kg); if the baseline level is 50% of normal, 3500 units (50 units/kg) should be given.

- **B. Inadequate venous drainage** will be detected by the surgeon as a distended right heart and by the perfusionist as a drop in the blood level in the venous reservoir (which should trigger a low‐volume alarm with use of a hardshell reservoir), with an inability to maintain systemic flow rates. It may result from an airlock in the venous line, kinking of the line on the field or close to the reservoir, inadvertent clamping of the venous line, retraction of the heart impeding flow into the venous cannula, or malposition of the venous cannula (either being too far in or not in enough). Inadequate venous drainage not only warms the heart during systemic hypothermia, potentially compromising myocardial protection, but may adversely affect the organs that are not drained well. A high central venous pressure (CVP) may indicate impaired SVC drainage and can produce cerebral edema. More commonly, drainage from the IVC is impaired, which could result in renal impairment or hepatic or splanchnic congestion with significant fluid sequestration in the bowel. Simply readjusting the depth of the cannula in the IVC usually resolves this issue. Rarely, when the SVC or IVC is snared with a tourniquet and the catheter has inadvertently pulled back into the atrium, there will be compromise of virtually all flow into the cannula and the right atrium.
- **C. Distention of the heart** on bypass is indicative of poor venous drainage, aortic valve insufficiency, or significant collateral flow. It may stretch the ventricular fibers producing myocardial injury, increase pulmonary artery pressures producing pulmonary barotrauma, or contribute to ventricular warming, impairing myocardial protection.

- The cause of distention should be remedied, either by readjusting the venous lines and/or by placing a vent, either in the LV or in the pulmonary artery. Occasionally, a distended heart during aortic cross‐clamping is related to incomplete occlusion of the aorta, with creation of aortic regurgitation when the heart is retracted.
- **D. Air entry into the venous lines** usually arises from the venous cannulation site or the retrograde cardioplegia site, and can be controlled by an additional suture around the catheter. Rarely, it may result from inadvertent damage to the IVC or coronary sinus, or from an atrial septal defect. Air entrapment with use of vacuum assist can result in arterial gaseous embolization.18
- **E. Inadequate systemic pressures** on pump have been incriminated as the cause of multisystem organ dysfunction, including neurocognitive changes, renal failure, and splanchnic hypoperfusion. Whether low‐flow or high‐flow CPB is optimal for organ system protection is controversial, but a minimum pressure of 50–70 mm Hg should be maintained unless it is desired to intentionally maintain a higher pressure (e.g. the patient with significant uncorrected carotid disease or the hypertensive, diabetic patient with preexisting renal dysfunction). Phenylephrine or norepinephrine is commonly used on pump to maintain systemic pressures, accepting the transient dips that occur with cardioplegia infusion or reinfusion of shed blood aspirated through the cardiotomy suckers. However, adequate flow rates must be maintained, because α‐agents will shunt blood away from the muscles and splanchnic circulation.
- **F. Vasodilatory shock post‐pump ("vasoplegia").** Not infrequently, a patient may be hypotensive from profound peripheral vasodilation despite an adequate cardiac output when terminating bypass. These patients often require a substantial amount of pressor support on pump as well. This phenomenon of "vasoplegia" appears to be mediated by high levels of nitric oxide due to activation of nitric acid synthase, activation of vascular smooth muscle ATP‐sensitive potassium channels, and relative vasopressin deficiency.97 Risk factors include older age, recent myocardial infarction, dialysis‐dependent renal failure, and valve operations.98 It may also occur more frequently in patients on preoperative ACE inhibitors or ARBs, as well as those on amiodarone.99 Although norepinephrine or phenylephrine are initially used to offset hypotension, vasopressin may be given in doses of 0.01–0.1 units/min and is usually successful in restoring the blood pressure and has been shown to improve clinical outcomes.100 If vasopressin is not successful, methylene blue (1.5 mg/kg) has been recommended.101,102 Hydroxocobalamin has also been used successfully to treat vasoplegia on pump by its effect on nitric oxide metabolism.103
- **G. Inadequate systemic oxygenation** can result in tissue ischemia and acidosis, potentially resulting in multisystem organ dysfunction. Despite regional variations in flow, it is presumed that a SvO2 exceeding 65% is indicative of satisfactory oxygenation. If the saturation is low, as is often noted during rewarming, this problem can be mitigated by improving the systemic flow rates and/or increasing the hematocrit. Evidence of cerebral oxygen desaturation is first evident by cerebral oximetry, then by pulse oximetry, and eventually by systemic venous oxygen desaturation. Mild systemic hypothermia can provide some element of organ system protection. However, significant arterial desaturation may also result from a catastrophic problem requiring immediate attention. This may include failure of the oxygenator or oxygen blender, or disconnection from an oxygen source. It might also result from an aortic dissection or malperfusion syndrome. Pump issues should be immediately recognizable by a

- change in the color of the blood in the arterial return line. On rare occasions, when the patient is no longer on pump, inadequate systemic oxygenation may result from the anesthesiologist failing to provide adequate ventilation to the patient (usually after the surgeon has asked that the lungs not be ventilated to improve exposure and then forgetting that request!).
- **H. High arterial line pressure** measured by the perfusionist is a potentially alarming situation. With pressurized roller pumps, this could result in a catastrophic line disconnection. With centrifugal pumps, which are afterload‐sensitive, unsafe high line pressures should not occur, because the flow is automatically reduced. A high line pressure caused by a high flow rate through a small cannula should not occur if the appropriately sized cannula is selected. For example, a 20 Fr curved‐tip cannula may provide up to 5 L/min flow at acceptable line pressures, but excessive shear force with higher line pressures may be noted at higher flow rates. In contrast, a 7 or 8 mm Medtronic Soft‐flow or EOPA cannula can flow more than 6 L/min without producing high line pressures. Malposition of the tip of the aortic cannula, kinking or clamping of the line, or an aortic dissection can also account for a high line pressure. When a dissection occurs, the high line pressure is accompanied by very low systemic pressures, and mandates immediate cessation of pump flow and relocation of the arterial inflow cannula.
- **I. Inadequate retrograde cardioplegia delivery** may produce inadequate myocardial protection. Low retrograde cardioplegia line pressures may be associated with rupture of the coronary sinus, a left SVC, or catheter displacement back into the right atrium.56,104 High line pressures may be noted in patients with a small coronary sinus, impingement of the end of the catheter on the sinus wall, inadvertent clamping of the catheter, or kinking of the cardioplegia line or catheter. Placement too far into the sinus may reduce flow to the RV and impair its protection. Filling of the posterior descending vein suggests that the RV is being adequately protected, but this may not always be the case.
- **J. Inadequate antegrade cardioplegia delivery** is usually associated with the presence of aortic regurgitation, thus mandating the use of retrograde cardioplegia for myocardial protection unless direct coronary ostial cannulation is used after performing an aortotomy. The efficacy of antegrade delivery can also be in doubt in patients with very severe coronary disease, so monitoring of myocardial pH or temperature may provide the surgeon with some assurance that adequate protection is being achieved. If the antegrade catheter is not completely within the aortic lumen, it is possible to infuse cardioplegia into the aortic wall, creating a dissection. Note that there are very small side holes a few millimeters away from the tip of the cannula and flow exiting those holes within the aortic wall could also cause a dissection.
- **K. Cannulation/decannulation problems** in the ascending aorta can cause catastrophic bleeding or stroke and can be quite problematic. Always respect the ascending aorta! Femoral cannulation also can cause significant life‐threatening problems when complications develop.
  - **1.** The surgeon must carefully assess the ascending aorta prior to cannulation to avoid areas of plaque and calcification which could dislodge during cannulation (or clamping/unclamping) causing an embolic stroke.
  - **2.** Suture placement in dilated aortas, especially those with bicuspid valves, can produce significant bleeding even with superficial passage of the needle through the

- aortic wall. Cannulating these sites must be done carefully to avoid tearing of the wall, which can result in significant bleeding around the cannula and potentially can cause an iatrogenic dissection. The latter may on occasion be repaired by additional suturing but, in most cases, requires repair during circulatory arrest and carries a high mortality rate. Cannula malposition should be rare with ascending aortic cannulation, especially if multiple side hole cannulas are used. The cannula must be securely positioned with tourniquets to prevent dislodgement.
- **3.** Adequate imaging of the iliofemoral vessels is essential prior to femoral cannulation in patients undergoing minimally invasive surgery to determine if femoral cannulation can be safely performed. Nonetheless, retrograde aortic dissections can occur with femoral cannulation if not careful. Upstream malperfusion can occur in patients with aortic dissections despite true lumen femoral cannulation. All femoral cannulas must be securely sewn to the skin, because malposition may impair pump flow and dislodgement can cause catastrophic bleeding, often not initially noted when the cannula is covered by a towel.
- **4.** Right atrial cannulation is usually done through the atrial appendage, but free wall cannulation is used during bicaval cannulation and for placement of the retrograde cardioplegia catheter, except in some minimally invasive cases. The atrial wall can be inordinately fragile and can tear, requiring additional sutures for control upon decannulation. Care must be taken to properly place all venous cannulas to optimize venous return. Improper positioning of a cavoatrial or IVC cannula can impair venous drainage from the splanchnic bed causing organ system dysfunction, and poor positioning of an SVC cannula can cause cerebral edema. This will be extreme if a tourniquet is tightened around the SVC or IVC when the cannula has pulled back into the right atrium. Poor right‐sided drainage will cause RV and often LV distention and will compromise myocardial protection.
- **L. Systemic or coronary air embolism** is always a possibility upon termination of bypass when there has been intracardiac entry, but its occurrence during CPB is a catastrophic problem.
  - **1.** Careful attention to deairing of the left‐heart chambers is important when there has been intracardiac entry (valve surgery) or active intracardiac or root venting. Various maneuvers, including ventilating the lungs, restricting venous return, stopping LV vent return, and gently massaging the heart with the patient in the Trendelenburg position should be considered prior to removing the aortic cross‐ clamp in these cases. Needle aspiration of the LV apex should be considered after aortic valve surgery. Carbon dioxide flooding of the field may minimize the amount of air retained during intracardiac procedures.105 Active root venting with gentle cardiac massage and sideways "shaking" of the operating room table upon weaning from bypass are important maneuvers to evacuate any ejected air. It is not uncommon for some air to pass down the right coronary artery or an aortocoronary venous bypass graft and cause RV dysfunction upon weaning from bypass. This problem usually resolves quickly, but CPB should be reinstituted if hemodynamics are compromised. TEE monitoring is the best means of identifying retained air as the heart is weaned from bypass.
  - **2.** Systemic air embolism occurring during CPB is usually related to inattention to the venous reservoir level in open circuits with delivery of air through a roller pump head. It may also occur with use of vacuum‐assisted drainage. Air embolism may also occur on bypass when the aorta is not clamped and air trapped in the left

heart is ejected when the pressure generated by the LV exceeds that in the aorta. Significant air embolism requires cessation of bypass with immediate venting of air from the aorta with a needle or through a stopcock on the aortic line and then removal of air from the bypass circuit. Ventilation with 100% oxygen, steep Trendelenburg position, and retrograde SVC perfusion should be used to try to eliminate air from the cerebral circulation. Steroids, barbiturates, and reinstitution of bypass with deep hypothermia may also reduce the degree of cerebral injury.106

- **3.** Systemic air embolism may occur if there is air entry into the inflow drainage lines of an assist device, because there is no reservoir or means available for venting or filtration of the air. The air will fragment and be pumped back into the arterial system.
- **M.** Cold‐reactive autoimmune diseases are rarely detected preoperatively, but may result in red cell agglutination and hemolysis on bypass at cold temperatures. This may be noted in the bypass or cardioplegia circuit.107–109
  - **1.** Cold hemagglutinin disease is caused by an IgM autoimmune antibody that causes red cell agglutination and hemolysis at cold temperatures. This may cause microvascular thrombosis that may contribute to myocardial infarction, renal failure, or other organ system failure. Since less than 1% of patients have cold agglutinins, screening is not routinely performed, and it rarely poses a problem during bypass, because hemodilution lowers antibody titers. However, should antibody titers be measured and be in high concentration (>1:1000), agglutination will occur at warmer temperatures.
  - **2.** If high‐titer agglutinins are present, systemic hypothermia and cold blood cardioplegia must be avoided. Either warm cardioplegia or cold crystalloid cardioplegia after an initial normothermic flush can be used.108,109 Even better would be performance of off‐pump coronary bypass surgery or on‐pump beating‐ or fibrillating‐heart surgery.
  - **3.** De novo discovery of cold agglutinins may occur on‐pump by detecting agglutination and sedimentation in the blood cardioplegia heat exchanger or any stagnant line containing blood. It has also been identified when the retrograde cardioplegia line develops high pressure due to obstruction from agglutination. In these circumstances, the patient should be warmed back to normothermia, and crystalloid cardioplegia used to flush out the coronary arteries.
  - **4.** Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCH) is an autoimmune disease in which a nonagglutinating IgG antibody binds to red cells in the cold, causing hemolysis. It should be managed in a similar fashion.110

#### **VII. Modifications of Extracorporeal Circulation**

- **A. Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA)** is used primarily in situations when the aorta cannot be clamped to perform an aortic anastomosis.
  - **1.** Indications for DHCA include:
    - **a.** Severe aortic atherosclerosis or calcification (porcelain aorta for aortic valve replacement) (see Figure 2.10, page 139)
    - **b.** Acute type A aortic dissections to avoid aortic wall damage and perform the distal anastomosis
    - **c.** Clamp placement too close to a planned suture line ascending aortic or hemiarch repairs, arch repair, proximal descending thoracic aneurysms

- **d.** Complex descending thoracic aortic surgery to improve anastomotic exposure while providing neuroprotection for the brain and/or spinal cord
- **e.** Resection of IVC tumors
- **2.** With traditional DHCA, the patient is cooled systemically to 18 °C to achieve electroencephalographic (EEG) silence. The temperature is measured at multiple sites, including the tympanic membrane, nasopharynx, bladder, and/or rectum, with the presumption that this will ensure uniform cooling of the cerebral cortex. Since an EEG is usually not performed, surgeons rely on clinical studies that have shown that about 45 minutes of DHCA at 18 °C is safe in minimizing cerebral damage.111 The head is packed in ice, and methylprednisolone 20 mg/kg is also given. The arterial line is clamped and blood is drained from the circulation, taking care not to allow air entry into the lines.
- **3.** Near‐infrared spectroscopy usually shows an increase in rSO2 as the patient is cooled systemically, but it usually falls during the first five minutes of DHCA. If the rSO2 has not reached a steady state >90% of baseline despite reaching the desired temperature, a few additional minutes of cooling may be beneficial.112
- **4.** Measures that may extend the acceptable period of DHCA to minimize the risk of CNS injury include antegrade or retrograde cerebral perfusion.
  - **a. Antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP)** provides flow into the arch vessels during the period of circulatory arrest and provides cold oxygenated blood to the brain at temperatures between 20–28 °C. Although core cooling to 18 °C is commonly used, moderate hypothermia to 30 °C can also be used with ACP without an added risk of cerebral damage.113–116
    - **i.** Axillary artery cannulation with occlusion of the proximal innominate artery can provide flow to the right side of the brain, and, through the circle of Willis, to the left side. It may be augmented by a catheter placed into the left common carotid artery (LCCA), which may be beneficial for circulatory arrest times greater than 40 minutes.117 Generally, infusing arterial blood at a rate of 6–10 mL/kg at a pressure of 40–60 mm Hg appears to give the best protection.113,118
    - **ii.** If the patient is undergoing aortic arch reconstruction, use of a trifurcation graft sewn to the arch vessels can minimize the time during which there is no cerebral perfusion and can potentially shorten the duration of DHCA. The brain can then be perfused and the patient warmed while the distal aortic anastomosis is performed. The proximal end of the trifurcation graft is then sewn off the proximal aortic graft (Figure 1.26, page 81).119
  - **b. Retrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP)** provides oxygenated, cold blood into the SVC at a flow rate up to 500 mL/min and at a pressure of up to 20 mm Hg. Studies suggest that this is not effective in providing nutrients to the brain, but it can maintain cerebral hypothermia. Although this is an effective technique for neuroprotection, it is probably most effective when the duration of DHCA will not be prolonged much beyond 45 minutes. RCP is beneficial in flushing air and debris out of the cerebral vessels.120
- **5.** Extensive cooling and rewarming are often associated with a coagulopathy that may require blood‐product transfusions. Warming generally takes twice as long as cooling, and the gradient between the arterial inflow and the patient's

**Figure 5.11 •** Left‐heart bypass setup. Inflow to the pump comes from either the left atrial appendage (A) or the left inferior pulmonary vein (B). Blood is then returned by a centrifugal pump to the femoral artery or to the distal aorta in cases of limited disease, such as traumatic tears of the aorta.

temperature should be no more than 10–12 °C to prevent generation of gaseous emboli.84

**6.** When bypass flow is reinstituted, care must be taken to eliminate any air or atherosclerotic debris from the arterial tree.

#### **B. Left‐heart bypass for thoracic aortic surgery**

- **1.** Impairment of blood supply to the lower body is inherent to any aortic procedure involving descending aortic cross‐clamping. The greatest risks are those of paraplegia and renal dysfunction. Even though thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is the procedure of choice for most descending thoracic aneurysms, an open surgical approach may be indicated in some patients.121 To minimize the risk of ischemic complications during cross‐clamping, techniques such as circulatory arrest or left‐heart bypass can be used. The latter entails drainage of oxygenated blood from the left side of the heart and returning it more distally in the arterial tree (Figure 5.11).122
- **2.** Inflow to a centrifugal pump may come from the left atrium or preferentially from the inferior pulmonary vein, which may be associated with fewer complications.123 The blood is returned either to the femoral artery or to the distal aorta

- below the lowest clamp in patients with limited disease (such as traumatic tears or Crawford type I aneurysms; see Figure 1.25, page 79). The blood does not pass through an oxygenator, although one can be placed in the circuit to improve oxygenation during one‐lung anesthesia.124
- **3.** Minimal heparinization is necessary for this setup (about 5000 units to achieve an ACT of 250 seconds), which is beneficial in trauma cases or cases requiring extensive dissection. Flow rates of up to 3 L/min can be used, with monitoring of lower‐extremity mean pressures in the femoral artery that should approximate 50 mm Hg. Drainage should not be so excessive as to compromise antegrade flow from the heart to the brain.
- **C. Assisted right‐heart bypass for off‐pump surgery.** During manipulation of the heart for off‐pump surgery, especially with hypertrophied hearts, there may be compromise of RV filling. Several devices have been designed that provide right‐heart assist by draining blood from the right atrium and pumping it into the pulmonary artery during these procedures.125
- **D. Perfusion‐assisted direct coronary artery bypass (PADCAB).** During off‐ pump surgery, there is compromise of distal flow during temporary vessel occlusion required for the construction of an anastomosis. This may lead to a subtle or severe degree of ischemia and potential myocardial necrosis. Intracoronary or aortocoronary shunts can be used to provide distal perfusion when constructing the anastomosis, either routinely or if there is evidence of ischemia.126 PADCAB provides perfusion‐assisted flow at a designated pressure (usually 120 mm Hg) that is independent of the systemic blood pressure. Additionally, medications such as nitroglycerin can be administered in the perfusate to provide coronary vasodilation. Placing a small catheter directly into the coronary artery allows for distal perfusion as the anastomosis is being constructed. Subsequently, flow can be directed through 2–3 mm cannulas placed into the conduits until the proximal anastomoses are performed. A comparative study of no shunting, passive shunting, and active perfusion showed that myocardial protection (measured by troponin levels) and performance were superior with active perfusion.127,128

#### **VIII. Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO)**

- **A. Indications and circuit setup.** ECMO is a means of providing a prolonged period of either pulmonary or cardiac support or both, depending on the nature of the circuit. It can be used in anticipation of recovery of organ system function or as a bridge to an assist device or transplantation.129,130
  - **1.** Veno‐arterial (VA) ECMO can provide oxygenation and circulatory support in cases of LV and RV failure. Such conditions include refractory cardiogenic shock (postinfarction, postcardiotomy, myocarditis), cardiac arrest, or progressively worsening heart failure. After cardiac surgery, the right atrial and aortic cannulas can be utilized and connected to the ECMO circuit. Otherwise, a venous drainage cannula is placed in the femoral vein with return of oxygenated blood to the femoral, axillary, or carotid artery (see Figure 11.7, page 564). To avoid distal ischemia with femoral arterial cannulation, a cannula placed into a sidearm graft will ensure distal perfusion of the leg. Alternatively, a small distal cannula (such as a 6 or 7 Fr Pinnacle sheath) can be directed distal to the cannula, with distal perfusion directed through a stopcock in the arterial line tubing.

- 2. Veno-venous (VV) ECMO is only useful for patients with advanced respiratory failure, as it does not provide any cardiac support (Figure 5.12). This can be considered in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure with a PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> <100, hypercapneic respiratory failure with a pH <7.20 and as a potential bridge to lung transplantation. Dual-site cannulation involves drainage from the femoral vein with return of oxygenated blood to either the contralateral femoral vein or the internal jugular vein. A single-stage setup involves placing a dual-lumen single-stage cannula through the internal jugular vein which is positioned in the right atrium. The return port directs oxygenated blood flow toward the tricuspid valve to minimize recirculation. Oxygenation is not as good with VV ECMO as it is with VA ECMO.</p>
- 3. The ECMO circuit resembles that used for standard CPB with a gas exchange device (oxygenator), centrifugal pump, and heat exchanger. Advanced membrane oxygenators are constructed of a polymethylpentene membrane (e.g. the MAQUET Quadrox and Terumo CAPIOX membrane oxygenators) which can function efficiently for weeks, providing improved gas exchange and reducing blood and transfusion requirements. Cumbersome makeshift systems have been replaced by compact devices, such as the MAQUET Cardiohelp system, that incorporates a Rotaflow centrifugal pump and allows for easy transportability.
- 4. A modified circuit that can be used for pulmonary support and RV failure is called RVAD ECMO. One example is the Tandem Heart Protek Duo system, which uses a dual lumen cannula and a Tandem Heart pump. Blood is drained through a 29 Fr cannula from the right atrium with return of oxygenated blood through the inner 16 Fr cannula into the pulmonary artery (see Figure 11.6, page 561).

#### B. Management concerns during ECMO and prognosis

- 1. Satisfactory oxygenation can be achieved using a target SaO<sub>2</sub>>90% for patients on VA ECMO and >75% for VV ECMO. Reduction in FiO<sub>2</sub> and PEEP will reduce barotrauma until pulmonary function recovers. Patients with ARDS often take weeks to recover, but the 30-day survival is 50–70%.
- 2. Mediastinal bleeding is common when ECMO is used for postcardiotomy support due to an ongoing coagulopathy, the use of heparin to maintain an ACT >180 seconds, and platelet activation and consumption. Although heparin is required to minimize thrombus formation within the circuit and reduce the possibility of a stroke, heparinization is usually withheld immediately after surgery to minimize mediastinal bleeding. This is well tolerated with commonly used systems, such as the CentriMag circulatory support system with magnetically levitated pump heads, even as a coagulopathy is corrected with clotting factors. Once bleeding is under control, heparin in then started. Bivalirudin may be considered when the duration of ECMO is anticipated to be prolonged to reduce the risk of developing HIT.
- **3.** Renal failure requiring dialysis occurs in nearly 50% of patients on ECMO and compromises survival.
- 4. Cardiac issues
  - **a.** Ventricular thrombus may form if LV output is very poor. Therefore, it is advisable to maintain the patient on inotropic support during ECMO to promote ventricular contraction.

**Figure 5.12 •** Veno‐venous ECMO can be used to provide respiratory support but not cardiac support after cardiac surgery. (A) **Dual site VV ECMO** Blood is withdrawn from the femoral vein, pumped through an oxygenator and reinfused into a central vein to provide oxygenation. (B) **Single site VV ECMO** Bicaval dual lumen cannula withdraws blood, pumps it through an oxygenator and the reinfused blood is directed toward the tricuspid valve to minimize recirculation.

- **b.** In patients with severe LV dysfunction, left‐heart distention may occur, causing pulmonary edema and a reduction in subendocardial blood flow, and may reduce the potential for myocardial recovery. Decompression with a transseptal catheter or placement of an Impella device may be helpful.
- **c.** In patients on VA ECMO through femoral arterial and venous cannulation, coronary and cerebral hypoxia may occur, since femoral arterial return of oxygenated blood preferentially perfuses the lower extremities and the splanchnic viscera, while poorly oxygenated blood ejected from the heart perfuses the heart and brain and upper extremities. This so‐called Harlequin or North South syndrome can be assessed by monitoring oxygen saturations in the arms and legs as well as the brain. Placement of an additional return cannula in the right atrium neutralizes this problem.
- **d.** Return of pulsatility in the arterial waveform is an early sign of ventricular recovery. Failure to recover within 2–5 days of support is an ominous prognostic sign. However, if organ system function has stabilized, the patient may then be transitioned to an assist device if further support is required. The 30‐day survival is 20–30% for patients receiving ECMO after a cardiac arrest and about 35% for patients with cardiogenic shock or failure to wean from bypass.
- **e.** Further comments on the use of ECMO are found on pages 563–565 in Chapter 11.
