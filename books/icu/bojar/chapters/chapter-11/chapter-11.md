# **11** Cardiovascular Management

The achievement of satisfactory hemodynamic performance is the primary objective of postoperative cardiac surgical management. Optimal cardiac function ensures adequate perfusion and oxygenation of other organ systems and improves the chances for an uneventful recovery from surgery. Even brief periods of cardiac dysfunction can lead to impairment of organ system function, leading to potentially life‐threatening complications. This chapter presents the basic concepts in cardiovascular management and then reviews the evaluation and management of low cardiac output syndrome, hypertension, perioperative myocardial infarction, coronary spasm, cardiac arrest, and rhythm disturbances that can contribute to compromised cardiovascular function.

### **I. Basic Principles**

The important concepts of postoperative cardiac care are those of cardiac output, tissue oxygenation, and the ratio of myocardial oxygen supply and demand. Ideally, one should strive to obtain a cardiac index greater than 2.2 L/min/m2 with a normal mixed venous oxygen saturation, reflecting adequate oxygen delivery to meet metabolic needs, while optimizing the myocardial oxygen supply:demand ratio.1–4

- **A. Cardiac output** is determined by the stroke volume and heart rate (CO = SV × HR). The stroke volume is equal to the left ventricular end‐diastolic volume (LVEDV) minus the left ventricular end‐systolic volume (LVESV) and is calculated by dividing the cardiac output by the heart rate. The three major determinants of stroke volume are preload, afterload, and contractility.
  - **1. Preload** refers to the LV end‐diastolic fiber length and is generally considered to reflect the LVEDV. Although this can be estimated best by echocardiography, preload in the postoperative patient is more commonly assessed by a measurement of left‐sided filling pressures using a Swan‐Ganz pulmonary artery catheter. These include the pulmonary artery diastolic (PAD) pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). Thus, these pressure measurements acts as surrogates for the assessment of preload. The left atrial pressure (LAP) provides a more precise approximation of the left ventricular end‐diastolic pressure (LVEDP), but requires placement of a catheter directly into the left atrium at the time of surgery. The relationship between filling pressures and volumes is determined by ventricular compliance.
    - **a.** The PAD and PCW pressures generally correlate with each other, and in most patients "wedging" of the catheter is unnecessary. However, the PAD may be

higher than the PCW pressure in patients with preexisting precapillary pulmonary hypertension (PH) or intrinsic pulmonary disease, in whom there is an increased transpulmonary gradient (equal to the PA mean pressure minus the PCW pressure). In these patients, the PAD pressure will underestimate the LV volume status, yet wedging of the catheter is not recommended because of an increased risk of PA rupture.

- **i.** Filling pressures must be interpreted cautiously in the early postoperative period.5–7 The PAD and PCW pressures often correlate poorly with the LVEDV early after surgery and tend to be elevated relative to the intracardiac volume status due to altered ventricular compliance from myocardial edema resulting from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and the use of cardioplegia solutions. Furthermore, the release of various inflammatory substances during bypass and the administration of blood products may increase the pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), increasing the PAD out of proportion to actual left‐sided filling. A stiff, hypertrophied left ventricle noted in patients with hypertension or aortic stenosis has reduced ventricular compliance and frequently manifests diastolic dysfunction coming off bypass. These patients usually require high filling pressures to achieve adequate ventricular filling. In contrast, the dilated, volume‐overloaded heart may be highly compliant, with an elevated LVEDV at lower pressures.
- **ii.** Elevated filling pressures measured by a Swan‐Ganz catheter are somewhat insensitive to the status of intracardiac volume and in predicting fluid responsiveness.7–9 Numerous studies have shown that goal‐directed therapy (GDT) using alternative monitoring techniques, such as pulse pressure and stroke volume variation, is more accurate in predicting fluid responsiveness. GDT is designed to optimize fluid administration with subsequent use of inotropic medications to improve the cardiac output. GDT may increase volume administration, but it reduces vasopressor use, the duration of ventilation, and complications, producing a shorter hospital length of stay, but with no impact on mortality.4,10–14
- **b.** For patients with relatively normal ventricular function, many centers do not use Swan‐Ganz catheters, and they rely upon central venous pressure (CVP) measurements to assess preload. Although this is a less accurate means of assessing preload in the diseased heart, it gives a fairly good approximation of left‐heart filling in the normal heart.15,16 One study showed that use of a Swan‐Ganz catheter provided no mortality benefit in low‐risk patients and, in fact, increased mortality in high‐risk patients, although patient selection for use of the catheter had to be taken into consideration.17 Generally, if the CVP exceeds 15–18 mm Hg, inotropic support is indicated. If the patient has other signs of low cardiac output (poor oxygenation, tapering urine output, acidosis), additional monitoring, whether it be by transpulmonary thermodilution (PiCCO, Pulsion Medical Systems), pulse contour analysis (FloTrac/Vigileo, Edwards Lifesciences),18 or insertion of a Swan‐Ganz catheter, will allow for a more objective evaluation of the problem.
- **c.** Despite the invasiveness of the Swan‐Ganz catheter and concerns about its precise value in most patients, most anesthesiologists and cardiac surgeons still use it for perioperative management, since it is a less‐expensive, time‐proven means

- of providing scientific information about trends in hemodynamic management to those managing the patient in the critical early postoperative period.19 Its use actually supports the theory that GDT is beneficial, especially for the patient with tenuous hemodynamics after surgery.
- **2. Afterload** refers to the left ventricular systolic wall tension, which is related to the intraventricular systolic pressure and wall thickness. It is determined by both the preload (Laplace's law relating radius to wall tension) and the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) against which the heart must eject after the period of isovolumic contraction. The SVR can be calculated from measurements obtained from the Swan‐Ganz catheter (Table 11.1) and should be indexed to the patient's size. The use of vasodilators to lower the SVR may improve the stroke volume, often in combination with volume infusions and inotropic agents.

- **3. Contractility** is the intrinsic strength of myocardial contraction at constant preload and afterload. However, it can be improved by increasing preload or heart rate, decreasing the afterload, or using inotropic medications.
  - **a.** Contractility generally reflects systolic function as assessed by the ejection fraction (EF), but it is only indirectly related to the cardiac output. For example, the cardiac output generated by a dysfunctional dilated ventricle with a poor EF may be comparable to or greater than that generated by a normal sized heart with a normal EF, especially if a significant tachycardia is present. Furthermore, a low cardiac output does not necessarily imply that ventricular function is impaired. It may be noted with slow heart rates, hypovolemia, and with a small, hypertrophied ventricle.
  - **b.** Nonetheless, the state of contractility is usually inferred from an analysis of the cardiac output and filling pressures, based upon which steps can be taken to optimize hemodynamic performance. In cardiac surgery patients, the cardiac output is usually obtained by thermodilution technology using a Swan‐Ganz catheter and bedside computer. A measured aliquot of volume is infused into the CVP port of the catheter and the thermistor near the tip measures the pattern of temperature change from which the computer calculates the cardiac output. A continuous cardiac output catheter is frequently used during off‐pump surgery and can provide frequent in‐line assessments of the cardiac output. The FloTrac device calculates the cardiac output from the energy of the arterial pressure waveform and is helpful when thermodilution assessment appears inaccurate or the Swan‐Ganz PA catheter has been removed.18 There are numerous other less‐invasive hemodynamic monitoring system available, many of which have been used in the GDT studies.

#### **B. Tissue oxygenation**

**1.** Oxygen delivery to tissues is the basic principle upon which hemodynamic support should be based. It is determined by the cardiac output (CO), the hemoglobin (Hb) level, and the arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2 ). This is represented by the equation:

$$O_2$$
 delivery =  $CO(Hb \times \% \text{ sat})(1.39) + (PaO_2)(0.0031)$ 

where 1.39 is the mL of oxygen transported per gram of Hb and 0.0031 is the solubility coefficient of oxygen dissolved in solution (mL/torr of PaO2 ).

**2.** It should be noted in this equation that the majority of oxygen transported to the tissues is in the form of oxygen bound to Hb, not that dissolved in solution. Thus, one of the major factors lowering O2 delivery in the postoperative period is a low hemoglobin (Hb) or hematocrit (HCT). Increasing the Hb level by 1 g/dL can increase blood oxygen content by 1.39 vol%, whereas an increase in PaO2 of 100 torr will only transport an additional 0.3 vol% of oxygen. However, in the profoundly anemic patient, dissolved oxygen represents a greater proportion of the oxygen delivered to tissues. Therefore, it is important to maintain the arterial oxygen

- saturation as close to 100% and to normalize the cardiac output to achieve adequate  $\rm O_2$  delivery. However, trying to achieve supranormal cardiac outputs with excessive volume infusions and inotropes is probably more harmful than beneficial to myocardial metabolism.
- 3. Due to concerns that blood transfusions are not benign, numerous studies have attempted to identify the safe lower limit for hematocrit to establish an appropriate transfusion trigger. Transfused blood contains proinflammatory cytokines and low levels of 2,3-DPG with increased Hb affinity for oxygen, which reduces tissue oxygen delivery. Transfusions are associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI), respiratory complications, stroke, renal failure, infections, and mortality.<sup>20-22</sup> Thus, the transfusion trigger should be based on evidence of impaired oxygen delivery to tissues or hemodynamic issues. Numerous studies have demonstrated comparable outcomes using either a restrictive (transfuse if Hb <7-7.5 g/dL) and liberal (transfuse if Hb <9 g/dL) strategy.<sup>23,24</sup> Thus, it is reasonable to accept a hematocrit of 21% in the stable postoperative patient and to prescribe iron supplements or, on occasion, even erythropoietin. However, it is also reasonable to transfuse patients to a hematocrit over 25% when they are elderly, frail and deconditioned, have poor ventricular function, borderline respiratory function, hypotension, tachycardia, ischemic ECG changes, oliguria, or a metabolic acidosis.
- 4. Mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO<sub>2</sub>) can be used to assess the adequacy of tissue perfusion and oxygenation, aiming for an SvO<sub>2</sub> >60%. Swan-Ganz PA catheters using reflective fiberoptic oximetry are available to monitor the SvO<sub>2</sub> in the pulmonary artery on a continuous basis. Intermittent SvO<sub>2</sub> measurements can be obtained from blood samples from the distal PA port of the Swan-Ganz catheter. A change of 10% in the SvO<sub>2</sub> can occur before any change is noted in hemodynamic parameters. Despite its theoretical benefit, several studies have suggested that the SvO<sub>2</sub> is an unreliable and insensitive predictor of the cardiac output since it is really measuring the balance between oxygen delivery and consumption.<sup>25,26</sup> However, since it does reflect the adequacy of tissue oxygenation, it should indicate whether the cardiac output is sufficient to meet tissue needs. When analyzed in conjunction with other hemodynamic parameters, trends in the SvO<sub>2</sub> offer insight into both cardiac performance and tissue oxygen delivery.
  - a. In the postoperative cardiac surgical patient, a fall in SvO<sub>2</sub> generally reflects decreased oxygen delivery or increased oxygen extraction by tissues and is suggestive of a reduction in cardiac output. However, other constantly changing factors that affect oxygen supply and demand may also influence SvO<sub>2</sub> and must be taken into consideration. These include shivering, pain, agitation, temperature, anemia, alteration in FiO<sub>2</sub>, and the efficiency of alveolar gas exchange. The Fick equation, which uses the arteriovenous oxygen content difference to determine cardiac output, can be rearranged as follows:

$$SvO_2 = SaO_2 - \frac{VO_2}{Hb \times 1.39 \times CO} \times 10$$

```
where:
```

```
SvO_2 = mixed venous oxygen saturation SaO_2 = arterial oxygen saturation VO_2 = oxygen consumption normal PvO_2 = 40 torr and SvO_2 = 75% normal PaO_2 = 100 torr and SaO_2 = 99%
```

- **b.** This equation indicates that a decrease in  $SvO_2$  may result from a decrease in  $SaO_2$ , cardiac output, or hemoglobin level, or an increase in oxygen consumption.
- c. When the arterial O<sub>2</sub> saturation is normal (SaO<sub>2</sub> >95%), an SvO<sub>2</sub> <60% suggests the presence of a decreased cardiac output and the need for further assessment and therapeutic intervention. Conversely, a high SvO<sub>2</sub> may reflect less oxygen extraction, as seen with hypothermia, sepsis, or intracardiac or significant peripheral arteriovenous shunting. When this is noted, oxygen delivery or utilization may be impaired and an otherwise "normal" cardiac output may be insufficient to provide adequate tissue oxygenation.
- d. Studies have also analyzed whether the central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO<sub>2</sub>) has value in perioperative management. Many GDT protocols do utilize this parameter and have found that its use improved outcomes. Although a very low ScvO<sub>2</sub> is most likely associated with a low cardiac output, the ScvO<sub>2</sub> is not as accurate as the SvO<sub>2</sub> in assessing either tissue oxygenation or cardiac output.<sup>26,27</sup>
- 5. When the cardiac index exceeds 2.2 L/min/m² and the arterial oxygen saturation is adequate (>95%), it may be inferred that oxygen delivery to the tissues is satisfactory. Thus, SvO₂ measurements to assess oxygen delivery are not necessary. However, there are a few situations in which calculation of tissue oxygenation may be valuable in assessing cardiac function:
  - a. When the thermodilution cardiac output is unreliable (tricuspid regurgitation, improperly positioned Swan-Ganz catheter) or cannot be obtained (Swan-Ganz catheter has not been placed or cannot be placed, such as in the patient with a mechanical tricuspid valve or central venous thrombosis, or has been removed).<sup>28</sup>
  - **b.** When the thermodilution cardiac output may seem spuriously low and inconsistent with the clinical scenario (malfunctioning Swan-Ganz catheter or incorrect calibration of computer). A normal SvO<sub>2</sub> indicates that the cardiac output is sufficient to meet tissue metabolic demands.
  - c. When the cardiac output is marginal, in-line assessment of trends in the mixed venous oxygen saturation can provide up-to-date information on the relative status of cardiac function.

#### C. Myocardial oxygen supply and demand

1. Myocardial O<sub>2</sub> demand (mvO<sub>2</sub>) is influenced by factors similar to those that determine the cardiac output (afterload, preload, heart rate, contractility). Reducing afterload will generally improve cardiac output with a decrease in mvO<sub>2</sub>, whereas an increase in any of the other three factors will improve cardiac output at the expense of an increase in mvO<sub>2</sub>. Preoperative management of the patient with ischemic heart disease is primarily directed towards minimizing O<sub>2</sub> demand.<sup>29</sup>

- **2. Myocardial O2 supply** is determined by coronary blood flow, the duration of diastole, coronary perfusion pressure, the Hb level, and the arterial oxygen saturation When complete revascularization has been achieved, postoperative management is directed towards optimizing factors that improve O2 supply and, to a lesser degree, minimize an increase in O2 demand.
  - **a.** A heart rate of 80–90 bpm should be achieved and excessive tachycardia and arrhythmias must be avoided.
  - **b.** An adequate perfusion pressure (mean arterial pressure [MAP] >70 mm Hg) should be maintained, taking care to avoid both hypotension and hypertension.
  - **c.** Ventricular distention and wall stress (i.e. afterload) should be minimized by avoiding excessive preload, reducing the SVR, and using inotropic medications to improve contractility.
  - **d.** The hematocrit should be maintained at a safe level. Although an increased level of Hb should improve oxygen delivery, transfusions carry inherent risks. In general, myocardial ischemia should not occur in the well‐protected, revascularized heart unless the hematocrit drops into the low 20s.
  - **e.** Ischemic ECG changes suggest that coronary blood flow may not be adequate. This may result from stenosis, thrombus, or spasm in a native vessel, anastomotic stenosis, kinking, thrombus or spasm in a bypass graft, or incomplete revascularization. If ECG changes are noted, immediate attention and possible reevaluation by catheterization are indicated.

#### **II. Low Cardiac Output Syndrome**

- **A.** The achievement of a satisfactory cardiac output to achieve adequate tissue oxygenation is the primary objective of postoperative cardiovascular management. Hemodynamic norms for the patient recovering uneventfully from cardiac surgery are a cardiac index (CI) greater than 2.0 L/min/m2 , a PAD or PCW pressure below 20 mm Hg, and a heart rate below 100 bpm with an SvO2 >65%. The patient should have warm, well‐perfused extremities with an excellent urine output.
- **B. Risk factors** for low cardiac output states include:4,16,30,31
  - **1.** Preoperative clinical factors: advanced age, malnutrition, diabetes with chronic kidney disease, LV systolic dysfunction, (e.g. low EF or cardiac output), and diastolic dysfunction (e.g. low cardiac output often with a hyperdynamic ventricle and an LVEDP >20 mm Hg).
  - **2.** Preoperative abnormal lab values including anemia and elevated BNP levels
  - **3.** Operative factors: longer durations of aortic cross‐clamping or CPB, emergency surgery and reoperations, CABG with incomplete revascularization, concomitant CABG‐valve operations, mitral valve surgery.
  - **4.** Diastolic dysfunction. After weaning from CPB, this is a particularly difficult problem to treat and usually requires pharmacologic support for a low output state despite normal systolic function.32
  - **5.** Increased lactate release after five minutes of reperfusion is an independent predictor of a low cardiac output. It suggests that there is delayed recovery of aerobic metabolism, perhaps as a result of inadequate myocardial protection.33

- **C. Pathophysiology.** A basic principle of cardiac surgery is to prevent myocardial damage while a corrective procedure is being performed. Although this has led to the concept of off‐pump bypass surgery or even beating heart surgery, the vast majority of open‐heart operations involve use of CPB with cardioplegic arrest. Despite adherence to basic principles and with improvements in cardioplegic solutions, including the more recent adoption of del Nido cardioplegia, myocardial protection is never perfect, and more myocardial injury tends to occur with longer cross‐clamp times. In general, myocardial function declines for about 6–8 hours following surgery, presumably from ischemia/reperfusion injury with use of cardioplegic arrest, and from the systemic inflammatory response. It then usually returns to baseline within 24 hours in the absence of significant myocardial injury (see section VIII, pages 586–589, on perioperative myocardial infarction).34
  - **1.** Temporary inotropic support is often required during this period to optimize hemodynamic performance. Drugs used at the conclusion of CPB should generally be continued for this brief period of time and can be weaned once the cardiac output is satisfactory. Although use of low‐dose inotropes for several hours is fairly common in most practices, even independent of LV function, studies do suggest that patients who receive inotropes after surgery have a higher mortality rate.35
  - **2.** When marginal ventricular function is present in the anesthetized or sedated patient, the compensatory mechanisms that can augment cardiac output in the awake patient are blunted. These include sympathetic autonomic stimulation and endogenous catecholamine production that can increase heart rate, contractility, and arterial and venous tone, elevating both preload and afterload. All of these factors may improve cardiac output or systemic blood pressure, but they may also increase myocardial oxygen demand at a time when asymptomatic ischemia may be present.
  - **3.** When these compensatory mechanisms are not present in the sedated patient, therapeutic intervention is necessary to improve the cardiac output. It is imperative to intervene before or at the first sign of clinical manifestations of a low cardiac output syndrome. These include:
    - **a.** Poor peripheral perfusion with pale, cool extremities, and diaphoresis
    - **b.** Pulmonary congestion and poor oxygenation
    - **c.** Impaired renal perfusion and oliguria
    - **d.** Metabolic acidosis
  - **4.** The use of invasive monitoring to continuously evaluate a patient's hemodynamic status allows for appropriate therapeutic interventions to be undertaken before these clinical signs become apparent. Nonetheless, subtle findings, such as a progressive tachycardia or cool extremities, should alert the astute clinician to the fact that the patient needs more intensive management. Intervention is indicated for a low cardiac output state, defined as a cardiac index below 2.0 L/min/m2 , usually associated with left‐sided filling pressures exceeding 20 mm Hg and an SVR exceeding 1500 dyn‐s/cm5 . It cannot be overemphasized that observing trends in hemodynamic parameters, rather than absolute numbers, is important when evaluating a patient's progress or deterioration.
  - **5.** A general scheme for the management of postoperative hemodynamic problems is presented in Table 11.2.

| ↑ increased; ↓ decreased; N normal; ↑↓ variable       |     |     |     |                           |

- **D. Etiology.** A low cardiac output state is usually associated with impaired left or right systolic function and may result from abnormal preload, contractility, heart rate, or afterload. However, a variety of other factors may be contributory. It may also be noted in patients with satisfactory systolic function but marked left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and diastolic dysfunction.1–4,16,36
  - **1.** Decreased left ventricular preload
    - **a.** Hypovolemia (bleeding, vasodilation from warming, narcotics, or sedatives)
    - **b.** Cardiac tamponade
    - **c.** Positive‐pressure ventilation and PEEP
    - **d.** Right ventricular dysfunction (RV infarction, PH)
    - **e.** Tension pneumothorax
  - **2.** Decreased contractility
    - **a.** Low ejection fraction
    - **b.** Myocardial "stunning" from transient ischemia/reperfusion injury or myocardial ischemia; perioperative infarction
      - **i.** Poor intraoperative myocardial protection
      - **ii.** Incomplete myocardial revascularization
      - **iii.** Anastomotic complications/graft thrombosis
      - **iv.** Native coronary artery or graft spasm
      - **v.** Evolving infarction at time of surgery
    - **c.** Hypoxia, hypercarbia, acidosis
  - **3.** Tachy‐ and bradyarrhythmias
    - **a.** Tachycardia with reduced cardiac filling time
    - **b.** Bradycardia
    - **c.** Atrial arrhythmias with loss of atrial contraction

- **d.** Ventricular arrhythmias
- **e.** Second‐ or third‐degree heart block
- **4.** Increased afterload
  - **a.** Vasoconstriction
  - **b.** Fluid overload and ventricular distention
  - **c.** Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction following mitral valve repair or replacement (from struts or retained leaflet tissue or uncorrected hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy)
- **5.** Diastolic dysfunction with impaired relaxation and high filling pressures37
- **6.** Syndromes associated with cardiovascular instability and hypotension
  - **a.** Sepsis (hypotension from a reduction in SVR; hyperdynamic with a high cardiac output early and myocardial depression at a later stage)
  - **b.** Anaphylactic reactions (blood products, drugs)
  - **c.** Adrenal insufficiency (primary or in the patient on preoperative steroids)
  - **d.** Protamine reactions

#### **E. Assessment** (abnormalities of concern noted in parentheses)

- **1.** Bedside physical examination: breath sounds, jugular venous distention, murmurs, warmth of extremities, and peripheral pulses (cool extremities, weak pulses, distended neck veins)
- **2.** Hemodynamic measurements: assess filling pressures and determine the cardiac output with a Swan‐Ganz catheter; calculate SVR; measure SvO2 (low cardiac output, high filling pressures, high SVR, low SvO2 )
- **3.** Arterial blood gases (hypoxia, hypercarbia, acidosis/alkalosis) hematocrit (anemia), and serum potassium (hypo‐ or hyperkalemia)
- **4.** ECG (ischemia, arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities)
- **5.** Chest x‐ray (pneumothorax, hemothorax, position of the endotracheal tube or intra‐aortic balloon)
- **6.** Urinary output (oliguria)
- **7.** Chest tube drainage (mediastinal bleeding)
- **8.** Two‐dimensional echocardiography is very helpful when the cause of a low cardiac output syndrome is unclear. Along with hemodynamic measurements, it can help identify whether it is related to LV systolic or diastolic dysfunction, RV systolic dysfunction, or cardiac tamponade.
- **9. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)** provides better and more complete information than a transthoracic study and can be readily performed in the intubated patient. It should always be considered when the clinical picture is consistent with tamponade but a transthoracic study is inconclusive.38

#### **F. Treatment** (Table 11.3)

- **1.** Ensure satisfactory **oxygenation** and **ventilation** (see Chapter 10).
- **2.** Treat **ischemia** or **coronary spasm** if suspected to be present due to ECG changes. Myocardial ischemia often responds to intravenous nitroglycerin (IV NTG) but may require further investigation if it persists. Coronary spasm (see section IX, pages 589–591) can be difficult to diagnose but usually responds to IV NTG and/ or a calcium channel blocker (CCB), such as sublingual nifedipine or IV diltiazem.

#### **Table 11.3 • Management of Low Cardiac Output Syndrome**

- 1. Look for noncardiac correctable causes (respiratory, acid–base, electrolytes)
- 2. Treat ischemia or coronary spasm
- 3. Optimize preload (PAD/PCW or LA pressure of 18–20 mm Hg)
- 4. Optimize heart rate at 90 bpm with pacing
- 5. Control arrhythmias
- 6. Assess cardiac output and start an inotrope if cardiac index is less than 2.0 L/min/m2
  - Epinephrine unless arrhythmias or tachycardia
  - Dobutamine (if high SVR)
  - Milrinone along with a catecholamine
- 7. Calculate SVR and start a vasodilator if SVR over 1500
  - Clevidipine or nitroprusside if moderate–high filling pressures, SVR, and BP
  - IV NTG if high filling pressures or evidence of coronary ischemia or spasm
- 8. If SVR is low
  - Norepinephrine if marginal cardiac output
  - Phenylephrine if satisfactory cardiac output
  - Vasopressin 0.01–0.1 units/min if satisfactory cardiac output
- 9. Blood transfusion if hematocrit less than 22%
- 10. IABP if refractory to pharmacologic intervention
- 11. Ventricular assist device if no response to the above
  - **3.** Optimize **preload** by raising filling pressures with volume infusion to a PAD or PCW pressure of about 18–20 mm Hg. Despite concerns that these pressures are insensitive measures of preload, their trends generally indicate when additional measures may be required to optimize cardiac output. Most times, a volume infusion that raises the PAD is all that is necessary to achieve a satisfactory cardiac output. This can initially be achieved using crystalloid or colloid solutions (see Chapter 12, page 678). Volume infusion is preferable to atrial pacing for improving cardiac output because it produces less metabolic demand on the recovering myocardium.39
    - **a.** Again, because left‐sided filling pressures are only surrogates for ventricular volume, the correlation between the two is best assessed from a review of pre‐ and intra‐operative hemodynamic data and an understanding of the patient's cardiac pathophysiology. Filling pressures will differ once the patient is anesthetized due to alterations in loading conditions and autonomic tone. They will subsequently be affected by reduced ventricular compliance at the termination of CPB. Direct visual inspection of the heart, evaluation of TEE images to correlate ventricular end‐diastolic dimensions with filling pressures, and measurement of cardiac outputs at the same time will usually indicate the appropriate filling pressures for optimal ventricular filling and cardiac performance in the early postoperative period.
    - **b.** For example, a PAD or PCW pressure around 15–18 mm Hg is usually best for patients with preserved LV function. In contrast, a pressure in the low 20s may be necessary to achieve adequate preload in the patient with poor LV function, a stiff hypertrophied ventricle with diastolic dysfunction, a small LV chamber (mitral or aortic stenosis or after resection of a left ventricular aneurysm), or preexisting PH from mitral valve disease. Ventricular size and compliance

- should be kept in mind when deciding whether additional volume is the next appropriate step in the patient with marginal cardiac function.
- **c.** The response to volume infusion may be variable (see the postoperative scenario described on pages 377–380). Failure of filling pressures to rise with volume may result from the capillary leak that is present during the early postoperative period. It may also result from vasodilation associated with rewarming or the use of medications with vasodilator properties, such as propofol or narcotics. It is more common in the volume‐overloaded compliant ventricle. However, it may also reflect the beneficial attenuation of peripheral vasoconstriction that is attributable to an improvement in cardiac output caused by the volume infusion. As the SVR and afterload gradually decrease, the cardiac output may improve further without an increase in preload.
- **d.** A rise in filling pressures without improvement in cardiac output may adversely affect myocardial performance as well as the function of other organ systems. At this point, inotropic support is usually necessary. Thus, careful observation of the response to volume infusion is imperative.
  - **i.** Excessive preload increases left ventricular wall tension and may exacerbate ischemia by increasing myocardial oxygen demand and decreasing the transmyocardial gradient (aortic diastolic minus LV diastolic pressure) for coronary blood flow. It may also impair myocardial contractility.
  - **ii.** Excessive preload may lead to interstitial edema of the lungs, resulting in increased extravascular lung water, ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) abnormalities, and hypoxemia.
  - **iii.** Excessive preload in the patient with right ventricular dysfunction may impair myocardial blood flow to the RV, resulting in progressive ischemia. A distended RV may contribute to left ventricular dysfunction because of overdistention and septal shift that impairs LV distensibility and filling.
  - **iv.** The presence of RV or biventricular dysfunction may also cause systemic venous hypertension which may reduce perfusion pressure to other organ systems. This may affect the kidneys (causing oliguria), the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (causing splanchnic congestion, jaundice, or ileus), or the brain (contributing to altered mental status).
  - **v.** Thus, the temptation must be resisted to administer additional volume to the failing heart with high filling pressures. Excessive preload **must** be avoided because it may lead to deterioration, rather than improvement, in hemodynamic performance. Once a satisfactory cardiac output has been achieved, volume infusions can be minimized.
- **4.** Stabilize the **heart rate and rhythm**. All attempts should be made to achieve atrioventricular (AV) synchrony with a heart rate around 90 bpm. This may require atrial (AOO or AAI) or AV (DDD or DVI) pacing. These modalities take advantage of the 20–30% improvement in cardiac output provided by atrial contraction that will not be achieved with ventricular pacing alone. This is especially important in the hypertrophied ventricle. Temporary biventricular pacing may be beneficial in improving hemodynamics (both systolic and diastolic function) in patients with impaired ventricular function, especially with prolonged AV conduction (wide QRS complex).40–43 Antiarrhythmic drugs should be used as necessary to control ventricular ectopy or slow the response to atrial fibrillation (AF).

- **5. Improve contractility** with inotropic agents.1–4,16,44 This should be based on an understanding of the α, β, or nonadrenergic hemodynamic effects of vasoactive medications and their anticipated effects on preload, afterload, heart rate, and contractility. These medications and a strategy for their selection are noted in section III, starting on page 535.
  - **a.** The use of inotropic agents in the early postoperative period may seem paradoxical in that augmented cardiac output is being achieved at the expense of an increase in oxygen demand (e.g. increased heart rate and contractility). However, the major determinant of oxygen demand is the pressure work that the left ventricle must perform. This is reflected by the afterload, which is determined by preload and SVR. Inotropic drugs that increase contractility do not necessarily increase oxygen demand in the failing heart, because they may reduce preload, afterload, and frequently the heart rate as a result of improved cardiac function.
  - **b.** If the cardiac output remains low despite pharmacologic support, physiologic support with an **intra‐aortic balloon pump (IABP)** should be strongly considered. If the patient cannot be weaned from bypass or has hemodynamic evidence of severe ventricular dysfunction despite maximal medical therapy and the IABP, use of a **circulatory assist device** should be considered.
- **6. Reduce afterload** with vasodilators if the cardiac output is marginal while carefully monitoring systemic blood pressure to avoid hypotension. Vasodilators must be used cautiously when the cardiac index is very poor, because an elevated SVR from intense vasoconstriction is often a compensatory mechanism in low cardiac output states to maintain central perfusion. If the calculated SVR exceeds 1500 dyn‐s/cm5 , vasodilators may be indicated either alone or in combination with inotropic medications.
- **7.** It is essential to integrate all hemodynamic parameters when determining whether a patient is or is not doing well. For example, the blood pressure may be high when the heart is not performing well, the cardiac output may be acceptable when the heart is struggling, and the cardiac output can be low even when ventricular function is normal.
  - **a.** The presence of a satisfactory or elevated blood pressure is not necessarily a sign of good cardiac performance. Blood pressure is related directly to both the cardiac output and the systemic vascular resistance (BP = CO × SVR). In the early postoperative period, myocardial function may be marginal despite normal or elevated blood pressures because of an elevated SVR resulting from augmented sympathetic tone and peripheral vasoconstriction. Vasodilators can be used to reduce afterload in the presence of elevated filling pressures, thus reducing myocardial ischemia and improving myocardial function. However, **withdrawal of inotropic support in the hypertensive patient should be considered only after a satisfactory cardiac output has been documented**. Otherwise, acute deterioration may ensue.
  - **b.** One should not be deceived into concluding that myocardial function is satisfactory when the cardiac output is "adequate" but is being maintained by fast heart rates at low stroke volumes.
    - **i.** Although sinus tachycardia is often related to the use of catecholamines or even milrinone, it is often an ominous sign of acute myocardial ischemia or

infarction, and it may render the borderline heart ischemic. The stroke volume index (SVI) is an excellent method of assessing myocardial function, because it assesses how much blood the heart is pumping each beat, indexed for the patient's size. Once hypovolemia has been corrected, a low SVI (less than 30 mL/beat/m2 ) indicates poor myocardial function for which inotropic support is usually indicated. Although β‐blockers would theoretically be beneficial to control tachycardia in the injured or ischemic heart, they are poorly tolerated in the presence of LV or RV dysfunction and should be use cautiously, if at all. A potential role for ivabradine in this situation to lower the heart rate without affecting the inotropic effects of catecholamines is not clear.45

- **ii.** Sinus tachycardia may represent a beneficial compensatory mechanism for a small stroke volume in a patient with a small left ventricular chamber (following LV aneurysm resection or mitral valve replacement for mitral stenosis). In these situations, an attempt to slow the heart rate pharmacologically may compromise the cardiac output significantly. Not infrequently, sinus tachycardia is a means of compensating for hypovolemia and quickly resolves after fluid administration. It may also be present in the profoundly anemic patient.
- **iii.** Tachycardia may also be present in patients with marked LVH and diastolic dysfunction, especially after aortic valve replacement (AVR) for aortic stenosis. In these situations, the cardiac output may be low despite preserved ventricular function because of a small noncompliant LV chamber. β‐blockers or CCBs can be used to slow the heart rate after adequate volume replacement has been achieved, but they must be used with extreme caution. Use of a medication with lusitropic (relaxant) properties, such as milrinone, may be helpful.
- **iv.** Tachycardia accompanying a large stroke volume is often seen in young patients with preserved ventricular function. It can be treated safely with a β‐blocker, such as esmolol or IV metoprolol.
- **c.** The cardiac output may be marginal despite normal LV systolic and diastolic function when the patient is hypovolemic but does not develop a compensatory tachycardia. This is noted in patients who were well β‐blocked prior to surgery, require pacing at the conclusion of the operation, or are receiving other medications that slow the heart rate, such as dexmedetomidine. Pacing up to a rate of 90 bpm and moderate volume infusion are invariably successful in improving the cardiac output in these situations. If the cardiac output is not acceptable once the filling pressures are satisfactory, an inotrope should be added. The common temptation to continue to administer fluid once the filling pressures are elevated may do more harm than good to the struggling heart.

#### **8. Maintain blood pressure**

**a.** Tissue perfusion may be impaired when the systemic pressure is low despite a satisfactory cardiac output. The mean arterial pressure is the average pressure during each cardiac cycle, and generally represents the perfusion pressure to organ systems. In addition to optimizing cardiac output and oxygenation, the mean arterial pressure should be maintained at a level exceeding at least 70 mm Hg to ensure adequate tissue perfusion.

- **b.** If the patient has **a satisfactory cardiac output but a low systemic resistance and low blood pressure**, the filling pressures are often low, and a moderate volume infusion should improve the blood pressure. This scenario is common in sedated patients receiving medications that have potent vasodilator properties. It is also common in patients who had been taking certain medications up to the time of surgery, including ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), CCBs, and amiodarone (which blocks sympathetic stimulation by α and β blockade).
  - **i.** If hypotension persists after volume infusion, an α‐agent should be used to increase the SVR. Norepinephrine is the preferred drug when the cardiac output is marginal because it has β‐agonist properties, whereas phenylephrine is a pure α‐agonist and should be used only if the cardiac output is satisfactory. Some patients respond better to norepinephrine than phenylephrine, and others just the reverse.
  - **ii.** Although norepinephrine does induce renal vasoconstriction, it generally has little adverse effect on renal function.46 Furthermore, unless used in high doses, norepinephrine is effective in raising the systemic pressure without adversely affecting intestinal mucosal perfusion or the splanchnic oxygen supply:demand ratio.47 Thus, unless the patient remains hypotensive in a low cardiac output state, concerns about impaired regional perfusion are mitigated.
  - **iii.** When catecholamine‐resistant hypotension persists despite a satisfactory cardiac output, it may represent a condition of autonomic failure termed "vasoplegia". This may be a consequence of the systemic inflammatory response (although it has been noted after off‐pump surgery as well) and may be related to vasodilation induced by nitric oxide. Levels of vasopressin are low in most normotensive patients after bypass but are inappropriately low in patients with "vasodilatory shock". **Arginine vasopressin** acts on vasomotor V1 and renal V2 receptors and, given in a dose of 0.01–0.1 units/min, can restore blood pressure in these patients and may be preferable to use of norepinephrine.48,49 Such low doses may suffice because patients with vasodilatory shock tend to be hypersensitive to its effects. It induces intestinal and gastric mucosal vasoconstriction and also reduces renal blood flow while increasing renal oxygen consumption. Thus, if the cardiac output remains marginal, mesenteric and renal ischemia are more likely to occur.50,51
  - **iv.** When there is a poor response to vasopressin, **methylene blue** 1.5 mg/kg should be considered. It inhibits guanylate cyclase activation by nitric oxide and has been reported to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with postbypass vasoplegia, especially when given early.52 Another alternative is **hydroxocobalamin** (5 g IV), which can be used in patients taking serotonergic antidepressants (citalopram, sertraline, fluoxetine), in whom methylene blue is contraindicated.53
- **c. If the patient has a persistently low blood pressure and cardiac output** despite volume infusions and adequate filling pressures, inotropic support should be initiated or increased, anticipating a rise in systemic blood pressure. If this does not occur, an IABP may be required to improve the cardiac output. Frequently,

- an α‐agent must also be added simultaneously to augment the blood pressure, and norepinephrine is preferable because it provides some β effects. Sometimes, use of an α‐agent to improve coronary perfusion pressure leads to an improvement in cardiac output. Vasopressin and phenylephrine are best avoided when the cardiac output is marginal because they are pure vasoconstrictors with no inotropic properties and may compromise renal and splanchnic blood flow.
- **d.** Correct **anemia** with blood transfusions. The hematocrit is usually maintained above 21% in the postoperative period, but transfusions should be considered for persistent hypotension, ongoing bleeding, hemodynamic instability, metabolic acidosis, or evidence of myocardial ischemia.
- **G. Right ventricular failure and pulmonary hypertension (PH)** (also see pages 382 and 396–397)14,16,54,55
  - **1. Mechanisms.** Right ventricular dysfunction results from decreased RV contractility and may be exacerbated by excessive RV preload, elevated RV afterload (PH), or right coronary ischemia or infarction.
    - **a.** Volume overload (elevated preload) may occur with tricuspid regurgitation or excessive fluid administration.
    - **b.** Pressure overload (elevated afterload) may result from any condition causing PH, whether pulmonary (ARDS, positive pressure ventilation, pulmonary embolism) or left‐sided cardiac disease (LV dysfunction, left‐sided valve disease).
    - **c.** The right ventricle functions in a low‐pressure circuit, so when any of the above factors is present, the RV will dilate, causing an increase in RV end‐diastolic pressure, which will reduce right coronary perfusion pressure. RV dilatation will also shift the interventricular septum leftward, impairing LV distensibility and filling, which will reduce the cardiac output. Progressive LV dysfunction will then create a vicious cycle by reducing systemic perfusion pressure, causing RV ischemia, and raising PA pressures and RV afterload, which will worsen RV function.

#### **2. Risk factors**

- **a.** Preoperative risk factors
  - **i.** Proximal RCA occlusion with possible RV infarction
  - **ii.** PH of any cause: most commonly this is "postcapillary" and associated with mitral/aortic disease or severe LV dysfunction, but it may result from severe lung disease (cor pulmonale) or primary PH ("precapillary").
- **b.** Intraoperative and postoperative contributing factors:
  - **i.** Poor myocardial protection, usually due to poor collateral circulation with an occluded RCA or due to exclusive use of retrograde cardioplegia, which provides suboptimal RV protection
  - **ii.** Prolonged ischemic times/myocardial stunning
  - **iii.** Inadvertent RCA distribution ischemia (obstruction of a coronary ostium during AVR, kinking of the RCA ostial button in aortic root replacements)
  - **iv.** Coronary embolism from air (usually in valve operations), thrombi, or particulate matter (in reoperative CABG or valve operations)
  - **v.** Systemic hypotension causing RV hypoperfusion

- **vi.** Acute PH (increased PVR and RV afterload) from:
  - ∙ Vasoactive substances associated with blood product transfusions and CPB
  - ∙ Severe LV dysfunction
  - ∙ Protamine reaction ("catastrophic pulmonary vasoconstriction")
  - ∙ Hypoxemia and acidosis
  - ∙ Tension pneumothorax
- **vii.** RV pressure overload from intrinsic pulmonary disease, ARDS, pulmonary embolism

#### **3. Assessment**

- **a.** Echocardiography is the best way to identify RV dysfunction, which is usually associated with RV dilatation. Markers of RV dysfunction include an RV fractional area change <35% or a tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE – the distance traveled between end‐diastole and end‐systole at the lateral corner of the tricuspid annulus) <16 mm.56 These findings may be identified by TEE during surgery, but are uncommonly assessed in the ICU.
- **b.** Specially designed Swan‐Ganz catheters can measure RVEF and RVEDV, but the correlation with contractility is not that precise. The EF may increase with increased preload or decreased afterload without any change in contractility since, by definition, the EF only reflects contractility at constant preload and afterload. The presence of significant tricuspid regurgitation will render thermodilution cardiac outputs unreliable. Alternative means of assessing the cardiac output, directly by using the FloTrac system or indirectly by measuring the SvO2 , may be helpful, although the former cannot be relied upon if atrial fibrillation is present.
- **c.** CVP measurements alone often do not accurately reflect the RVEDV, but trends in the CVP with volume challenges along with cardiac output measurements are valuable in dictating the best course of action. If the CVP rises above 15–18 mm Hg without an improvement in cardiac output, further volume infusions should not be given, and steps to reduce RV afterload and increase contractility are indicated. Although isolated RV dysfunction is best characterized by a high RA/PCW pressure ratio, this is unreliable when LV dysfunction is also present.
- **d.** RV afterload is generally assessed by the mean PA pressure and less commonly by the PVR, since the latter is not influenced by RV dilatation and will be higher when the cardiac output is lower (mean PA = PVR × CO). However, sometimes a low PA pressure is encountered when the RV is failing, because the RV is simply incapable of generating an adequate PA pressure, yet the PVR will remain unchanged.
- **4. Treatment.** The goals of treatment are to optimize RV preload, ensure AV conduction, maintain systemic and coronary perfusion pressures, improve RV contractility, reduce RV afterload by reducing PVR, and optimize LV function (Table 11.4).
  - **a. RV preload** must be raised cautiously to avoid the adverse effects of RV dilatation on RV myocardial blood flow and LV function. It is generally taught that cardiac output can be improved by volume infusions in patients sustaining an RV infarction with compromised RV function. However, the CVP (RA

#### **Table 11.4 • Management of Right Ventricular Failure**

- 1. Optimize preload with CVP of 18–20 mm Hg
- 2. Ensure AV conduction
- 3. Maintain adequate systemic perfusion pressure with vasoactive medications or an IABP
- 4. Reduce RV afterload (PVR) and improve RV contractility
  - a. Correct hypothermia, hypoxemia, hypercarbia, acidosis
  - b. Select inotropes with vasodilator properties (milrinone, low‐dose epinephrine, dobutamine, isoproterenol)
  - c. Use a pulmonary vasodilator
    - Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO)
    - Inhaled epoprostenol
    - Inhaled iloprost
- 5. Optimize LV function
- 6. Mechanical circulatory assist (RVAD or ECMO) if no response to the above

pressure) should not be increased to more than 18–20 mm Hg, which indirectly indicates RV volume overload. If no improvement in cardiac output ensues when volume is given to reach this level, additional volume infusions should be avoided. Volume overload of the right ventricle contributes to progressive deterioration of RV function, impairment of LV filling, and systemic venous hypertension.

- **b. AV conduction** is essential if it can be achieved.
- **c.** Systemic perfusion pressure must be maintained while trying to avoid medications that can also increase PVR. Maintaining adequate perfusion of the RV might benefit from IABP support.
- **d.** Correction of hypothermia, hypoxemia, and respiratory acidosis by hyperventilation will decrease the PVR (acidosis rather than hypercarbia is most deleterious).
- **e. Inotropic medications** that can support RV and LV function and also reduce the pulmonary artery pressure should be selected, and they may be combined with a pulmonary vasodilator.
  - **i.** Milrinone is a phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor that is very beneficial in improving RV contractility and reducing PA pressures, although it usually causes systemic hypotension that requires an α‐agent to support the SVR. Unfortunately, the use of α‐agents may also increase the PVR. The combination of IV milrinone with oral sildenafil produces a synergistic reduction in PVR.55
  - **ii.** Isoproterenol may be the most effective drug to improve RV contractility. Its use must be tempered by the possibility of inducing a significant tachycardia.
  - **iii.** Dobutamine is an effective inotrope that improves RV contractility in patients with RV failure, although it has little effect on pulmonary hemodynamics. It has fairly similar effects to milrinone and acts synergistically with it, but it does cause more tachycardia.

- iv. If RV function remains depressed, addition of epinephrine may be considered. Norepinephrine may be necessary to maintain SVR in the hypotensive patient, although it will also increase PVR.
- v. Levosimendan (see section III.L.2, pages 544–545) exhibits similar inotropic effects to dobutamine but is more effective in reducing RV afterload.<sup>57</sup>
- f. Pulmonary vasodilators should also be considered to reduce RV afterload.<sup>58</sup>
  - i. Intravenous nitroso dilators, including NTG and nitroprusside, may be effective in reducing PA pressures, but NTG is usually associated with a reduction in cardiac output, and nitroprusside primarily reduces the SVR. Thus, they may be beneficial in patients with moderate PH and RV dysfunction, but they have relatively limited application in patients with severe RV dysfunction. They have been supplanted by other more potent and selective pulmonary vasodilators.
  - ii. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is a selective pulmonary vasodilator that can decrease RV afterload and augment RV performance with minimal effect on SVR, thus maintaining systemic perfusion pressure. Despite these benefits, a meta-analysis reported that iNO did not reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation or mortality when used for postoperative RV dysfunction.<sup>59</sup>
    - It does not increase intrapulmonary shunting and may reverse the hypoxic vasoconstriction that is frequently noted with other pulmonary vasodilators (such as nitroprusside) and may improve the PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio.<sup>60</sup>
    - The usual dose is 10–40 ppm administered via the ventilatory circuit. The circuit must be designed to optimally mix O<sub>2</sub> and NO to generate a low level of NO<sub>2</sub>, which is toxic to lung tissue. Measurements of the concentration of iNO in the inhalation limb and NO<sub>2</sub> in the exhalation limb of the ventilatory circuit by chemiluminescence are essential during delivery. Ideally, a scavenger system should be attached to the exhaust port of the ventilator. Once in the bloodstream, iNO is rapidly metabolized to methemoglobin, which rarely causes methemoglobinemia in adults but can be a significant problem in young children.
    - iNO should be weaned slowly to prevent a rebound increase in PVR. A general guideline is to decrease the dose no more than 20% every 30 minutes. Inhalation can be stopped once 6 ppm is reached.
    - Comparative studies in patients with postoperative PH have shown that iNO is comparable to inhaled epoprostenol, but not quite as effective as iloprost, in lowering PA pressures and improving RV function.<sup>61,62</sup> In comparison with IV milrinone, iNO is associated with lower heart rates, better RVEF, and less requirement for vasopressor support.<sup>63</sup>
  - iii. Prostaglandin and prostacyclin analogues are potent pulmonary vasodilators that have been used primarily to assess vascular reactivity in patients awaiting heart transplantation. However, they are also beneficial in reducing PA pressure and improving RV function in patients with severe PH during and after various types of cardiac surgery, including mitral valve surgery and heart transplantation. These medications can optimize the PVR/SVR ratio and maintain RV contractility without affecting systemic perfusion pressure.

- ∙ **Epoprostenol** (prostacyclin, PGI2 [Flolan]) is both a pulmonary and very strong systemic vasodilator when administered intravenously because it is not inactivated by the lungs. However, inhaled PGI2 is a very effective short‐acting selective pulmonary vasodilator that can improve RV performance without affecting SVR. It may also improve oxygenation by decreasing V/Q mismatch. A single 60 μg inhalation in the operating room may initially be used, but a continuous inhalation setup in the ICU, using either a weight‐based protocol (up to 50 ng/kg/min, at which dose some systemic vasodilation may occur) or a concentration‐based protocol, giving 8 mL/h of a 20 μg/mL solution, can be recommended. There is complete reversal of effect about 25 minutes after inhaled PGI2 is stopped. It is as effective as iNO while being less expensive and less cumbersome to administer.61
- ∙ **Iloprost** (Ventavis) is a synthetic prostacyclin analogue that also reduces PVR and increases cardiac output with little effect on blood pressure or SVR. It can be given in an aerosolized dose of 25–50 μg during and after surgery. Its hemodynamic effect lasts 1–2 hours after a single administration. Comparative studies have shown it to be more effective than iNO in reducing PVR,62,63 with the combination of iNO and iloprost having additive effects on the pulmonary vasculature.64
- **iv. Inhaled milrinone** has shown comparable effects to IV milrinone in reducing PA pressures while demonstrating more pulmonary selectivity by not influencing the SVR and mean arterial pressure.65 It also improves oxygenation by reducing intrapulmonary shunting and V/Q mismatch.66 Studies have found it to be less effective than iNO or inhaled iloprost,66,67 but to have an additive effect in reducing PA pressures and the requirement for vasoactive support when used with inhaled prostacyclin.68 The dose is 50 μg/kg when given as an inhalation, but a 5 mg bolus into the endotracheal tube might be just as effective in reducing PA pressures and improving RV function.69 Studies of preemptive pre‐CPB inhaled milrinone have shown some pulmonary vasodilatory effect without any effect on clinical outcome.70 Despite individual reports of efficacy, a meta‐analysis failed to show clinical benefits of inhaled milrinone.71
- **v. Sildenafil** is a PDE type V inhibitor that prevents the degradation of cGMP and reduces pulmonary vascular tone without any effect on the systemic vasculature. Studies have shown a significant pulmonary vasodilatory effect postoperatively when given for 24 hours before surgery (25 mg q8h),72 10 minutes before induction (50 mg),73 and when given in the ICU through an NG tube (20 mg every eight hours in one study74 and 0.5 mg/kg in another).75 It is also beneficial when given along with iNO.76 It may be helpful in weaning patients off intravenous or inhaled pulmonary vasodilator support.
- **g.** If RV dysfunction persists despite use of inotropic support, pulmonary vasodilators, and an IABP, implementation of mechanical assistance with a right ventricular assist device may be necessary. Commonly used systems are the Impella RP, the CentriMag device, TandemHeart RVAD, Protek Duo, or veno‐arterial ECMO (see pages 559–560).

- H. Diastolic dysfunction is a common cause of congestive heart failure (HF) in hypertensive patients, and can pose hemodynamic problems after surgery when ventricular compliance is affected by the use of CPB and cardioplegia. It is most prominent after a prolonged period of cardioplegic arrest, especially with small hypertrophied hearts.
  - 1. Diastolic dysfunction is caused by decreased diastolic compliance, often with an inappropriate tachycardia.<sup>77</sup> The end result is a low cardiac output syndrome with low end-diastolic volumes yet high left-sided filling pressures. The stiffness of the heart is usually evident on echocardiogram, which may confirm normal systolic function even though the patient is in a low output state.
  - 2. This problem can be difficult to manage and often results in end-organ dysfunction, such as renal failure, that progresses until the diastolic dysfunction improves (see pages 381–382). Although inotropic drugs are frequently given, they are of little benefit. In contrast, ACE inhibitors may improve diastolic compliance; lusitropic drugs, such as the CCBs, magnesium, and milrinone, may improve ventricular relaxation; and bradycardic drugs, such as β-blockers or CCBs, can be used for an inappropriate tachycardia. Aggressive diuresis may also be beneficial in reducing myocardial edema that might contribute to reduced compliance.

#### III. Inotropic and Vasoactive Drugs

#### A. General comments

- 1. A variety of vasoactive medications are available to provide hemodynamic support for the patient with marginal myocardial function.  $^{1-4,16,44}$  They should be chosen carefully to achieve a satisfactory cardiac index (>2.2 L/min/m²) and blood pressure (MAP >70 mm Hg) once adequate filling pressures have been achieved. The selection of a particular drug depends on an understanding of its mechanism of action and limitations to its use (see section M, page 545 for recommendations on drug selection). The catecholamines exert their effects on  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$ -adrenergic receptors. They elevate levels of intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) by  $\beta$ -adrenergic stimulation of adenylate cyclase. In contrast, the PDE inhibitors (milrinone) elevate cAMP levels by inhibiting cAMP hydrolysis. Elevation of cAMP augments calcium influx into myocardial cells and increases contractility.
  - **a.**  $\alpha_1$  and  $\alpha_2$  stimulation result in increased systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance. Cardiac  $\alpha_1$ -receptors increase contractility and decrease the heart rate.
  - **b.**  $\beta_1$  stimulation results in increased contractility (inotropy), heart rate (chronotropy), and conduction (dromotropy).
  - $\boldsymbol{c.}~~\boldsymbol{\beta_2}$  stimulation results in peripheral vasodilation and bronchodilation.
- 2. The net effects of medications that share  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$  properties usually depend on the dosage level and are summarized in Table 11.5.
- **3.** The concomitant use of several medications with selective effects may minimize the side effects of higher doses of individual medications. For example:
  - a. Inotropes with vasoconstrictive ( $\alpha$ ) properties can be combined with vasodilators to improve contractility while avoiding an increase in SVR (e.g. norepinephrine with clevidipine, propofol or nitroprusside).
  - **b.** Inotropes with vasodilator properties can be combined with  $\alpha$ -agonists or other vasoconstrictors to maintain SVR (e.g. milrinone with phenylephrine, norepinephrine, or vasopressin).

| Medication                                                       | SVR | HR   | PCW | CI | MAP | MvO2 |

<sup>↑</sup> increased; ↓ decreased; ↔ no change; ↓↑ variable effect. The relative effect is indicated by the number of arrows.

**Note:** the effect may vary with dosage level (particularly dopamine and epinephrine, in which case the effect seen at low dose is indicated by the first arrow). For some medications, an improvement in MAP may occur from the positive inotropic effect despite a reduction in SVR. The effects of inamrinone, milrinone, and calcium are not mediated by α and β receptors.

- **c.** Catecholamines can be combined with a PDE inhibitor to provide synergistic inotropic effects while achieving pulmonary and systemic vasodilation (e.g. epinephrine or dobutamine with milrinone).
- **d.** α‐agents can be infused directly into the left atrium to maintain SVR while a pulmonary vasodilator is infused into the right heart.
- **4.** The benefits of most vasoactive medications are noted when adequate blood levels are achieved in the systemic circulation. Thus, these medications should be given into the central circulation via controlled infusion pumps rather than peripherally. Although higher levels can be reached by drug infusion into the left atrium to avoid pulmonary vascular effects and reduce drug inactivation by the lungs, this is an uncommon practice.
- **5.** The standard mixes and dosage ranges are listed in Table 11.6.
- **6.** Inotropic drugs should be used to normalize the cardiac output after steps have been taken to improve preload, afterload, and rhythm issues. Although numerous studies have suggested that the use of inotropes is associated with increased morbidity and mortality after cardiac surgery, it is difficult to conclude that the patients who needed such support would have done better without hemodynamic support.78–80

#### **B. Epinephrine**

#### **1. Hemodynamic effects**

**a.** Epinephrine is a potent β<sup>1</sup> ‐inotropic agent that increases cardiac output by an increase in heart rate and contractility, generally increasing myocardial oxygen

|----------------|----------------|------------------------------------------|--|--|
| Medication     | Mix            | Dosage Range                             |  |  |
| Epinephrine    | 1 mg/250 mL    | 1–4 μg/min (0.01–0.05 μg/kg/min)         |  |  |
| Dobutamine     | 500 mg/250 mL  | 5–20 μg/kg/min                           |  |  |
| Milrinone      | 20 mg/200 mL   | 50 μg/kg bolus, then 0.25–0.75 μg/kg/min |  |  |

| Isoproterenol  | 1 mg/250 mL    | 0.5–10 μg/min (0.0075–0.1 μg/kg/min)     |  |  |
| Norepinephrine | 4 mg/250 mL    | 1–30 μg/min (0.01–0.3 μg/kg/min)         |  |  |
| Phenylephrine  | 40 mg/250 mL   | 5–150 μg/min (0.05–1.5 μg/kg/min)        |  |  |

**Table 11.6 • Mixes and Dosage Ranges for Vasoactive** 

**Note:** × milligrams placed in 250 mL gives an infusion rate of × micrograms (mg divided by 100) in 15 drops of solution. For example, a 200 mg/250 mL mix gives a drip of 200 μg in 15 drops. 60 microdrops = 1 mL. 15 drops/min = 15 mL/h.

> demand. At doses of less than 2 μg/min (<0.02–0.03 μg/kg/min), it has a β<sup>2</sup> effect that produces mild peripheral vasodilation, but the blood pressure is usually maintained or elevated by the increase in cardiac output. At doses greater than 2 μg/min (>0.03 μg/kg/min), α effects will increase the SVR and raise the blood pressure. Metabolic acidosis may also be noted at low doses of epinephrine when α effects are not evident, but this is not related to reduced tissue perfusion.81

- **b.** Epinephrine has strong β<sup>2</sup> properties that produce bronchodilation.
- **c.** Although epinephrine may contribute to arrhythmias or tachycardia, studies have shown that epinephrine given at a dose of 2 μg/min causes less tachycardia than dobutamine given at a dose of 5 μg/kg/min.82

#### **2. Indications**

- **a.** Epinephrine may be considered a first‐line drug for a **borderline cardiac output** in the absence of tachycardia or ventricular ectopy. Some authors state that it should be considered a second‐line inotrope because of the risk of tachycardia and arrhythmias, an increase in myocardial oxygen consumption, a decrease in splanchnic blood flow, and the risk of lactic acidosis.16 It is very helpful in the hypertrophied heart that often takes a while to recover adequate systolic function after cardioplegic arrest. Epinephrine is extremely effective and has very low cost.
- **b.** It is especially helpful in **stimulating the sinus node** mechanism when the intrinsic heart rate is slow. It is frequently beneficial in improving the atrium's responsiveness to pacing at the conclusion of bypass.
- **c. Bronchospasm** may respond well to epinephrine, especially when an inotrope is also required.

- **d. Anaphylaxis** (protamine reaction)
- **e.** Resuscitation from cardiac arrest
- **3. Starting dose** is 1 μg/min (about 0.01 μg/kg/min) with a mix of 1 mg/250 mL. Dosage can be increased to 4 μg/min (about 0.05 μg/kg/min). Higher doses are rarely indicated in patients following cardiac surgery.

#### **C. Dobutamine**

#### **1. Hemodynamic effects**

- **a.** Dobutamine is a positive inotropic agent with a strong β<sup>1</sup> effect that increases heart rate in a dose‐dependent manner and also increases contractility. Although it has a mild vasoconstrictive α<sup>1</sup> effect, this is offset by its mild vasodilatory β<sup>2</sup> effect, resulting in reduced filling pressures, a reduction in SVR, but maintenance of blood pressure due to improved cardiac performance. Although the increased heart rate may increase myocardial oxygen demand, this is mostly offset by augmented myocardial blood flow and a reduction in preload and afterload, reducing LV wall stress.83 This is particularly evident in volume‐ overloaded hearts (valve replacement for mitral or aortic regurgitation).84
- **b.** Dobutamine may cause more tachycardia than low‐dose epinephrine, so switching from one inotrope to another may be considered to minimize any increase in oxygen demand that could trigger ischemia.82
- **c.** Dobutamine and the PDE inhibitors (milrinone) provide comparable hemodynamic support, although dobutamine is associated with more hypertension, tachycardia, and a greater chance of triggering atrial fibrillation.85

#### **2. Indications**

- **a.** Dobutamine is most useful when the **cardiac output is marginal and there is a mild elevation in SVR**. Its use is usually restricted by development of a tachycardia. Some groups consider this the best first‐line drug for inotropic support.
- **b.** It is a moderate **pulmonary vasodilator** and may be helpful in improving RV function and lowering RV afterload.
- **c.** It has a synergistic effect in improving cardiac output when used with a PDE inhibitor (milrinone). This combination is commonly used in patients awaiting cardiac transplantation.
- **3. Starting dose** is 5 μg/kg/min using a mix of 500 mg/250 mL. Dosage can be increased to 20 μg/kg/min.

#### **D. Milrinone (Primacor)**

#### **1. Hemodynamic effects**

**a.** Milrinone is a phosphodiesterase (PDE) III inhibitor best described as an "inodilator".86 It improves cardiac output by reducing systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, lowers coronary vascular resistance,87 and exerts a moderate positive inotropic effect. There is usually a modest increase in heart rate, a lowering of filling pressures, and a moderate reduction in systemic blood pressure despite the improvement in myocardial contractility. This is generally associated with a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand. Although the unloading effect produced by the decrease in SVR may contribute a great deal to its efficacy, an α‐agent (phenylephrine or norepinephrine) is frequently required to maintain systemic blood pressure.

- **b.** Milrinone increases cyclic AMP levels, which causes relaxation of myofilaments. Although this lusitropic effect improves ventricular compliance after bypass, some studies suggest that milrinone has no effect on diastolic function and does not have lusitropic properties.88–92
- **c.** Additive effects on ventricular performance are noted when milrinone is combined with one of the catecholamines, such as epinephrine or dobutamine, due to differing mechanisms of action.
- **d.** Milrinone may produce a tachycardia, especially in the hypovolemic patient. However, in comparison with dobutamine, it generally produces a comparable increase in cardiac output with less increase in heart rate, suggesting strong inotropic properties, and is associated with a lower incidence of arrhythmias, although one study found that milrinone was an independent risk factor for atrial fibrillation.93 Since it is generally used in addition to a catecholamine in patients with poor RV or LV dysfunction, it is not clear if the risk of AF might still have been high without its use.
- **e.** Although it would seem counterintuitive to use a β‐blocker (with its negative inotropic properties) with a PDE inhibitor, one study did show that β‐blockers could offset the tachycardia produced by a PDE inhibitor without compromising the beneficial inotropic effects.94
- **f.** Prior to the availability of milrinone, inamrinone (known at the time as amrinone or Inocor) was the preferred PDE inhibitor. Both drugs had comparable effects, but inamrinone was associated with thrombocytopenia, so its use has declined.95
- **g.** Several meta‐analyses have found that milrinone use in cardiac surgery is associated with similar or higher mortality rates than use of other or no inotropes at all.96,97 However, it is difficult to justify using no inotropic support in a low cardiac output state. Thus, when milrinone is added due to inadequate response to a catecholamine, it is most likely beneficial in reducing the need for an IABP, optimizing organ system function, and improving outcomes in the early postoperative period.
- **h.** Inhaled milrinone has selective pulmonary vasodilator effects that can reduce PA pressures and improve RV function without any systemic effects. The literature provides conflicting evidence of its efficacy and benefits.66–71

#### **2. Indications**

- **a.** Milrinone is generally the second medication selected for a **persistent low cardiac output state** despite use of one of the catecholamines or when their use is limited by tachycardia. However, a preemptive bolus of milrinone given on pump significantly reduces the need for any catecholamine in the immediate perioperative period.98
- **b.** It is particularly valuable in patients with **right ventricular dysfunction** associated with an elevation in PVR, such as patients with PH from mitral valve disease or those awaiting and following cardiac transplantation. Use of inhaled or intratracheal milrinone shows selective pulmonary vasodilatory effects without influencing systemic hemodynamics, but is of unclear benefit.
- **c.** The lusitropic (relaxant) property may be of value in patients with significant **diastolic dysfunction** that may contribute to a low output state, even with preserved systolic function.

**d.** Milrinone is effective in dilating arterial conduits and may be beneficial when there is suspected coronary or graft spasm and the need for inotropic support.87

#### **3. Advantages and disadvantages**

- **a.** Milrinone has a long elimination half‐life of 1.5–2 hours that increases to 2.3 hours in patients with low cardiac output states or HF. Thus, an intraoperative bolus can be used to terminate bypass and provide a few hours of additional inotropic support without the need for a continuous infusion.
- **b.** Because the hemodynamic effects persist for several hours after the drug infusion is discontinued (in contrast to the short duration of action of the catecholamines), the patient must be observed carefully for deteriorating myocardial function for several hours as the hemodynamic effects wear off. The dose is generally sequentially halved, and if hemodynamic performance remains adequate, it is then stopped.
- **4. Starting dose** is a 50 μg/kg IV bolus over 10 minutes, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.25–0.75 μg/kg/min of a 20 mg/200 mL solution. Note that, because of its long half‐life, it takes up to six hours to reach a steady‐state level if not given with a loading dose. The inhalational dose is comparable to the IV bolus dose.

#### **E. Dopamine**

- **1.** The hemodynamic effects of dopamine vary with increasing doses, but reports of adverse effects have significantly reduced its usage. It tends to cause a tachycardia and arrhythmias, accelerates AV conduction in atrial fibrillation,99 will depress ventilation due to inhibition of peripheral chemoreceptors causing V/Q mismatch, and may worsen renal function despite producing an improvement in urine output.16,100
  - **a.** Renal dose dopamine (2–3 μg/kg/min) is effective in improving urine output, but it has adverse effects on renal function if used during surgery and does not alter the natural history of acute kidney injury if it develops.101,102
  - **b.** At moderate doses of 3–8 μg/kg/min, dopamine exhibits a β<sup>1</sup> inotropic effect that improves contractility, and, to a variable degree, a chronotropic effect that increases heart rate and the potential for arrhythmogenesis.
  - **c.** At doses greater than 8 μg/kg/min, there are increasing inotropic effects, but also a predominant α effect that occurs directly and by endogenous release of norepinephrine. This raises the SVR, systemic blood pressure, and filling pressures, and may adversely affect myocardial oxygen consumption and ventricular function. Concomitant use of a vasodilator, such as nitroprusside, to counteract these α effects allows for the best augmentation of cardiac output.

#### **2. Indications**

- **a.** Dopamine may be considered for a **low cardiac output state**, especially when the SVR is low and the blood pressure is marginal, but its use is usually limited by the development of a profound tachycardia and other potential adverse effects, so the other inotropes listed above are preferable.
- **b.** It does **improve urine output** in patients with or without preexisting renal dysfunction, but has no demonstrable benefit in preserving renal function, and may in fact worsen renal function if used intraoperatively.101

#### **F. Isoproterenol**

#### **1. Hemodynamic effects**

- **a.** Isoproterenol has a strong β<sup>1</sup> effect that increases cardiac output by a moderate increase in contractility and a marked increase in heart rate with a slight β<sup>2</sup> effect that lowers SVR. The increased myocardial O2 demand caused by the tachycardia limits its usefulness in coronary bypass patients. Isoproterenol may produce ischemia out of proportion to its chronotropic effects, and it also predisposes to ventricular arrhythmias.
- **b.** Isoproterenol's β<sup>2</sup> effect lowers PVR and reduces RV afterload.
- **c.** There is a strong β<sup>2</sup> bronchodilator effect.

#### **2. Indications**

- **a. Right ventricular dysfunction** associated with an elevation in PVR. Isoproterenol is both an inotrope and a pulmonary vasodilator and thus is helpful in supporting RV function following mitral valve surgery in patients with PH. Because it causes a profound tachycardia, it has generally been replaced by the PDE inhibitors and dobutamine. However, it is still used following heart transplantation to reduce PVR, improve RV function, and produce ventricular relaxation.
- **b. Bronchospasm** when an inotrope is required.
- **c. Bradycardia** in the absence of functioning pacemaker wires. It may be used after heart transplantation to maintain a heart rate around 100 bpm.
- **3. Starting dose** is 0.5 μg/min with a mix of 1 mg/250 mL. It can be increased to about 10 μg/min (usual dosage range is 0.0075–0.1 mg/kg/min).

#### **G. Norepinephrine** (Levophed)

#### **1. Hemodynamic effects**

- **a.** Norepinephrine is a powerful catecholamine with both α‐ and β‐adrenergic properties. Its predominant α effect raises SVR and blood pressure, while the β1 effect increases both contractility and heart rate.
- **b.** By increasing afterload and contractility, norepinephrine increases myocardial oxygen demand and may prove detrimental to the ischemic or marginal myocardium. Although it may also cause regional redistribution of blood flow, studies suggest that renal and intestinal perfusion are maintained if the systemic blood pressure improves. Furthermore, the addition of dobutamine has been shown to improve gastric mucosal perfusion in patients receiving norepinephrine.103
- **c. Note:** there is a tendency to think that norepinephrine is providing only an α effect, but it does possess strong β properties. Thus, it should be anticipated that both the stroke volume and heart rate will fall when the drug is weaned.

#### **2. Indications**

**a.** Norepinephrine is primarily indicated when the patient has a marginally **low cardiac output with a low blood pressure caused by a low SVR**. This is often noted when the patient warms and vasodilates. Use of a pure α‐agent is feasible if the cardiac index exceeds 2.5 L/min/m2 , but norepinephrine can provide some inotropic support if the cardiac index is borderline. If the cardiac index is below 2.0 L/min/m2 , another inotrope should probably be used in addition to norepinephrine.

- **b.** It is frequently effective in raising the blood pressure when little effect has been obtained from phenylephrine (and vice versa).
- **c.** It has been used as an inotrope to improve cardiac output in conjunction with a vasodilator to counteract its α effects.
- **3. Starting dose** is 1 μg/min (about 0.01 μg/kg/min) with a mix of 4 mg/250 mL. The dose may be increased as necessary to achieve a satisfactory blood pressure. Higher doses (probably >20 μg/min or >0.2 μg/kg/min) most likely will reduce visceral and peripheral blood flow and may produce a metabolic acidosis.

#### **H. Phenylephrine** (Neo‐Synephrine)

#### **1. Hemodynamic effects**

- **a.** Phenylephrine is a pure α‐agent that increases SVR and may cause a reflex decrease in heart rate. Myocardial function may be compromised if an excessive increase in afterload results. However, it is frequently improved by an elevation in coronary perfusion pressure that resolves myocardial ischemia.
- **b.** Phenylephrine has no direct cardiac effects.

#### **2. Indications**

- **a.** Phenylephrine is indicated only to **increase the SVR when hypotension coexists with a satisfactory cardiac output**. This is commonly noted at the termination of bypass or in the ICU when the patient warms and vasodilates. If the blood pressure remains low after volume infusions yet the cardiac output is satisfactory, phenylephrine can be used to maintain a systolic blood pressure around 100–110 mm Hg. Significantly higher pressures should be avoided to minimize the adverse effects of an elevated SVR on myocardial function.
- **b.** Phenylephrine can be used **preoperatively to treat ischemia** by maintaining perfusion pressure, while IV NTG is used to reduce preload. It is beneficial in maintaining the blood pressure in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy in whom inotropes will accentuate the outflow tract gradient and is useful in patients who exhibit systolic anterior motion (SAM) after mitral valve repair.

#### **3. Advantages and disadvantages**

- **a.** Patients often become refractory to the effects of phenylephrine after several hours, necessitating a change to norepinephrine. Conversely, some patients respond very poorly to norepinephrine and have an immediate blood pressure response to low‐dose phenylephrine.
- **b.** By providing no cardiac support other than an increase in central perfusion pressures, phenylephrine has limited indications.
- **c. Note:** be very careful when administering an α‐agent to the patient whose entire revascularization procedure is based on arterial grafts, as it may provoke spasm and causes profound ischemia, which can be fatal.
- **4.** Starting dose is 5 μg/min with a mix of 40 mg/250 mL. The dosage can be increased as necessary to maintain a satisfactory blood pressure. The usual dosage range is 0.05–1.5 μg/kg/min.

#### **I. Vasopressin**

#### **1. Hemodynamic effects**

**a.** Vasopressin acts on vasomotor V1 and renal V2 receptors to increase SVR. It has no direct cardiac effects, so any improvement in cardiac function is related to an improvement in perfusion pressure.

- **b.** It may improve renal perfusion in that it constricts the efferent rather than the afferent arterioles, in contradistinction to the effects of α‐agents on renal perfusion. However, one study suggested that it reduced renal blood flow, increased renal oxygen extraction, and impaired renal oxygenation.50
- **c.** It induces intestinal and gastric mucosal vasoconstriction; thus if the cardiac output remains marginal, mesenteric ischemia is more likely to occur.51
- **d.** It is beneficial in patients with a low SVR and PH as it does not produce a significant alteration in PA pressures.
- **e.** It may induce vasospasm in internal thoracic artery (ITA) and radial artery grafts.

#### **2. Indications**

- **a.** Low blood pressure that is poorly responsive to phenylephrine or norepinephrine.
- **b.** Vasodilatory shock ("vasoplegia") after CPB associated with a satisfactory cardiac output that is not responsive to norepinephrine or phenylephrine. Norepinephrine is preferable in patients with a compromised cardiac output.
- **3. Dosage** is an infusion of 0.01–0.1 units/min.

#### **J. Calcium chloride**

#### **1. Hemodynamic effects**

- **a.** The primary effect of calcium chloride (CaCl2 ) is an increase in SVR that improves the mean arterial pressure.104 It has little effect on the heart rate. It produces a transient improvement in systolic function at the termination of CPB, although it may increase ventricular stiffness, suggesting it produces transient diastolic dysfunction.105
- **b.** One study showed that CaCl2 produces a transient inotropic effect if hypocalcemia is present and a more sustained increase in SVR, independent of the calcium level.106
- **c.** A study that compared epinephrine and calcium chloride upon emergence from CPB showed that both increased the mean arterial pressure, but only epinephrine increased the cardiac output, suggesting that calcium did not provide any inotropic support.107 Although this study did not find any beneficial or negative effects of combining these two medications, another one did suggest that calcium salts may attenuate the cardiotonic effects of catecholamines, such as dobutamine or epinephrine, but have little effect on the efficacy of inamrinone (and presumably milrinone).108

#### **2. Indications**

- **a.** Frequently used **at the termination of CPB to augment systemic blood pressure** by either a vasoconstrictive or positive inotropic effect. This is a common practice despite concerns that calcium influx during reperfusion may contribute to myocardial dysfunction.109,110
- **b. To support myocardial function or blood pressure on an emergency basis** until further assessment and intervention can be undertaken. **Note:** calcium is not recommended for routine use during a cardiac arrest.
- **c. Hyperkalemia** (K+ >6.0 mEq/L).
- **3. Usual dose** is 0.5–1 g slow IV bolus.

#### **K. Triiodothyronine (T3 )**

#### **1. Hemodynamic effects**

- **a.** Thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine or T3 ) exerts a positive inotropic effect by increasing aerobic metabolism and synthesis of high‐energy phosphates. It causes a dose‐dependent increase in myocyte contractile performance that is independent of and additive to β‐adrenergic stimulation.111
- **b.** A low T3 level preoperatively is associated with low cardiac output syndrome and increased mortality after CABG.112 Most patients have reduced levels of free T3 for up to three days following operations on CPB.113,114 Routine administration of T3 to maintain normal levels produces a transient improvement in cardiac output, lowers troponin release, reduces SVR, and may reduce the need for inotropes, but it does not appear to influence outcomes.115–117 However, a significant improvement in hemodynamics has been noted in patients with impaired ventricular function, many of whom could not be weaned from bypass on multiple inotropes until T3 was administered.118
- **c. Note:** CCBs have been shown to interfere with the action of T3 .
- **d.** There is some evidence that postoperative atrial fibrillation is more common in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and low T3 levels, and administration of T3 may reduce the incidence of postoperative AF.119,120

#### **2. Indications**

- **a.** T3 may be indicated to provide inotropic support as a salvage step when CPB cannot be terminated with maximal inotropic support and an IABP.
- **b.** T3 is helpful in improving donor heart function in brain‐dead patients when ventricular function is depressed.
- **3. Usual dose** is 10–20 μg, although some studies have used a bolus of 0.8 μg/kg followed by an infusion of 0.12 μg/kg/h for six hours.116

#### **L. Other modalities to treat low cardiac output**

- **1. Glucose–insulin–potassium (GIK)** has been demonstrated to have an inotropic effect on the failing myocardium after cardioplegic arrest. It provides metabolic support to the myocardium by increasing anaerobic glycolysis, lowering free fatty acid levels, preserving intracellular glycogen stores, and stabilizing membrane function. It has been shown to reduce myocardial injury and improve hemodynamic performance.121 The mixture contains 50% glucose, 80 units/L of regular insulin, and 100 mEq/L of potassium infused at a rate of 1 mL/kg/h.
- **2. Levosimendan** is a calcium‐sensitizing "inodilator" that has been used for patients with decompensated HF and has been further evaluated in the management of cardiac surgical patients. There is vast literature suggesting that its administration before initiating CPB may improve myocardial function after revascularization, with a reduced requirement for additional inotropes, less IABP usage, and a reduction in mortality.122–124 However, several additional studies have not shown any survival benefit independent of the extent of LV dysfunction.125–129
  - **a. Mechanisms and effects.** Levosimendan improves cardiac function by both inotropic and vasodilatory effects. The positive inotropic effect results from sensitizing myofilaments to calcium without increasing intracellular calcium levels. It also has coronary, pulmonary, and systemic vasodilator effects by opening

ATP‐dependent potassium channels in vascular smooth muscle. Thus, it improves cardiac output by increasing stroke volume with little increase in heart rate, by reducing afterload from its vasodilating effects, and to a slight degree by lusitropic effects. Given at high doses, it may require use of an α‐agent to counteract systemic vasodilation. The one major difference between levosimendan and other inotropes is the enhancement of contractility without an increase in myocardial oxygen demand. At low doses, it is not arrhythmogenic. The half‐ life is 70–80 hours, so it has a long‐lasting effect after administration.

- **b. Indications.** Levosimendan is useful in improving hemodynamics in patients with anticipated postcardiotomy RV and LV dysfunction and in facilitating weaning from bypass. In patients with RV dysfunction, it decreases PVR and improves RV contractility (better than dobutamine in one study).57 An infusion started prior to bypass (with or without a loading dose of 24 μg/kg) is very effective in reducing troponin leakage, suggesting a cardioprotective effect, and in maintaining an improved cardiac output without the need for additional inotropic support. In view of numerous studies suggesting no significant impact on outcomes, the role for levosimendan in cardiac surgical patients remains undefined.
- **c. Starting dose.** It is given as a 12–24 μg/kg loading dose over 10 minutes, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.1 μg/kg/min.

#### **M. Recommended strategy for selection of vasoactive medications**

- **1.** The selection of a vasoactive medication should be based on several factors:
  - **a.** An adequate understanding of the underlying cardiac pathophysiology derived from hemodynamic measurements and echocardiography.
  - **b.** Knowledge of the α, β, or nonadrenergic hemodynamic effects of the medications and their anticipated influence on preload, afterload, heart rate, and contractility.
  - **c.** Assessment of intravascular volume, since preload should be optimized before inotropic drugs are initiated. However, it is common practice to initiate low‐ dose inotropic support at the termination of CPB, which may or may not need to be continued depending on volume status and cardiac performance.
- **2.** Vasoactive medications are usually started in the operating room and maintained for about 6–12 hours while the heart recovers from the period of ischemia/reperfusion. The doses are adjusted as the patient's hemodynamic parameters improve. Occasionally, when the heart demonstrates persistent "stunning" or has sustained a perioperative infarction, pharmacologic support and/or an IABP may be necessary for several days.
- **3.** When the cardiac index is satisfactory (>2.2 L/min/m2 ) but the blood pressure is low, an α‐agent should be selected. Phenylephrine is commonly used in the operating room, but norepinephrine is probably a better drug to use in that it provides some β effects that are beneficial during the early phase of myocardial recovery. Systolic blood pressure need only be maintained around 100 mm Hg (mean pressure >70 mm Hg) to minimize the increase in afterload. If neither of these medications suffices, vasopressin should be utilized. Occasionally, a simple bolus of 1–2 units of vasopressin overcomes the initial vasoplegic state after pump and minimizes the subsequent need for an α‐agent.

- **4.** When the cardiac index remains marginal (<2.0 L/min/m2 ) after optimizing volume status, heart rate, and rhythm, an inotropic agent should be selected. The first‐line drugs are usually epinephrine or dobutamine. The major limitation to their use is the development of tachycardia, which tends to be less prominent with low‐dose epinephrine. At inotropic levels, epinephrine tends to raise SVR, whereas dobutamine's effect on SVR is variable but usually not significant. If a satisfactory cardiac output has been achieved and the blood pressure is elevated, addition of a vasodilator is beneficial. If the blood pressure is low, an α‐agent can be added.
- **5.** If the cardiac output still remains suboptimal despite moderate doses of drugs (epinephrine 2–3 μg/min [0.03–0.04 μg/kg/min] or dobutamine 10 μg/kg/min), a second drug should be added. The PDE inhibitor milrinone exhibits additive effects to those of the catecholamines and should be selected. This will lower the SVR and may cause a modest tachycardia. It commonly requires the use of norepinephrine to maintain SVR, although blood pressure may be maintained by the improvement in cardiac function. If norepinephrine is used, its β effect may further improve contractility, but it can also increase the heart rate. Its α effect usually has minimal effect on organ system perfusion if a satisfactory cardiac output can be achieved, but it can compromise flow in arterial conduits (such as the ITA or radial artery). If the cardiac index remains marginal despite the use of two medications, an IABP should be inserted.
- **6.** If the patient cannot be weaned from bypass and has hemodynamic evidence of persistent cardiogenic shock (CI <1.8 L/min/m2 , PCWP >20 mm Hg) despite medications and the IABP, a circulatory assist device should be considered.
- **7. Note:** it is not uncommon for the cardiac output to fall to below 1.8–2.0 L/min/m2 during the first 4–6 hours after surgery, which represents the time of maximal myocardial depression. After optimizing fluid status, the dose of an inotrope may need to be increased transiently or, less frequently, another one added if the cardiac output does not improve. Such goal‐directed hemodynamic management usually improves outcomes. However, it is the **persistence of a low output state** beyond this time that raises concerns, especially if there is any evidence of myocardial ischemia on ECG, a low SvO2 , rising filling pressures out of proportion to fluid administration, oliguria, or a progressive metabolic acidosis. An IABP may need to be inserted in the ICU if these problems are present. However, in the absence of any specific identifiable problem, most patients will gradually improve, and one should not be overly alarmed by transient drops in cardiac output and respond too aggressively. If there is any concern, echocardiography is helpful in assessing whether ventricular dysfunction or cardiac tamponade is causing the low output state, and can direct management appropriately.
- **8. Note:** use of α‐agents can be dangerous in patients receiving radial artery grafts or when multiple grafts are based on ITA inflow. It is preferable to reduce the dose of the vasodilating drug (diltiazem or IV NTG used to prevent spasm), rather than increase the dose of a vasoconstricting medication if hypotension is noted.
- **N.** Vasoactive medications provide specific hemodynamic benefits, but their use may be limited by the development of adverse effects. Nearly all of the catecholamines will increase myocardial oxygen demand by increasing heart rate and contractility. Other side effects that may necessitate changing to or addition of another medication include:

- **1.** Arrhythmogenesis and tachycardia (epinephrine, dobutamine, isoproterenol)
- **2.** Vasoconstriction and poor renal, splanchnic, and peripheral perfusion (norepinephrine, phenylephrine, vasopressin)
- **3.** Vasodilation requiring α‐agents to support systemic blood pressure (milrinone)
- **4.** Excessive urine output (dopamine)
- **5.** Thrombocytopenia (inamrinone)
- **6.** Cyanide and thiocyanate toxicity (nitroprusside)
- **7.** Methemoglobinemia (IV NTG)

#### **O. Weaning of vasoactive medications**

- **1.** Once the cardiac output and blood pressure have stabilized for a few hours, vasoactive medications should be weaned. α‐agents should generally be weaned first. Their use should ideally be restricted to increasing the SVR to support blood pressure when the cardiac output is satisfactory. However, there are circumstances when α‐agents are required to maintain cerebral and coronary perfusion in the face of a poor cardiac output. In these desperate life‐saving situations, the resultant intense peripheral vasoconstriction can compromise organ system and peripheral perfusion, causing renal, mesenteric, and peripheral ischemia, acidosis, and frequently death.
  - **a.** In the routine patient, SVR and blood pressure increase when myocardial function improves, narcotic effects abate, and sedatives, such as propofol or dexmedetomidine, have been discontinued. As the patient awakens and develops increased intrinsic sympathetic tone, α‐agents can be stopped.
  - **b.** When milrinone or an IABP is used to support myocardial function, an α‐ agent is frequently required to counteract the unloading effect and decreased SVR that is achieved. It may not be possible to wean the α‐agent before the patient has been weaned from milrinone or the IABP, because the patient may become hypotensive despite an excellent cardiac output. It is usually necessary to wean the α‐agent in conjunction with the weaning of the other modalities.
  - **c.** An occasional patient who has sustained a small perioperative infarction will have an excellent cardiac output but a low SVR. This requires temporary vasoconstrictor support until the blood pressure improves spontaneously. Such support may be required for several days.
- **2.** The stronger positive inotropes with the most potential detrimental effects on myocardial metabolism should be weaned next. Those that possess α properties should be decreased to doses at which these effects do not occur. If an IABP is present, it should not be removed until the patient is on a low dose of only one inotrope, unless complications of the IABP develop. Otherwise, weaning of the IABP should usually be deferred.
  - **a.** The catecholamines should be weaned first to low doses. If the patient is on multiple drugs, epinephrine should be weaned to a low dose (2 μg/min or less) to avoid any α effects. Dobutamine (which lacks a significant α effect) should be weaned to doses of less than 10 μg/kg/min.
  - **b.** Milrinone is usually weaned off with the patient still supported by low doses of catecholamines. However, since it has few deleterious effects on myocardial function, and catecholamines may cause a tachycardia, it is not unreasonable to

- continue the milrinone while the catecholamine is weaned off. Because of its long half‐life, it should be withdrawn slowly, usually halving the dose and then discontinuing it if the patient remains hemodynamically stable. Occasionally, deterioration in myocardial function may occur several hours later and require the reinstitution of inotropic support.
- **c.** IABP removal may be performed once the patient is on low doses of inotropic support, such as epinephrine at 1 μg/min, dobutamine <10 μg/kg/min, or milrinone at ≤0.5 μg/kg/min.
- **d.** The requirement for vasoactive medications in patients on circulatory assist devices depends on the extent of support provided and the function of the unsupported ventricle. In patients receiving univentricular support, inotropic medications may be necessary to improve the function of the unassisted ventricle. Patients with biventricular support are usually given only α‐agents or vasopressin to support systemic resistance. If the device is being used for temporary support, rather than as a bridge to transplantation, inotropes may be given to assess cardiac reserve when flows are transiently reduced. If ventricular function is recovering, an inotrope, such as milrinone, can be given to provide support after removal of the device, if necessary. With the use of ECMO, it is beneficial to support some LV contraction to minimize the risk of LV thrombus formation.
- **3.** Vasodilators are commonly used during the early phase of postoperative recovery to reduce blood pressure when the patient is hypothermic, vasoconstricted, and hypertensive. They are weaned when the patient vasodilates to maintain a systolic blood pressure of 100–120 mm Hg.
  - **a.** Vasodilators may also be used alone or in conjunction with inotropic medications to improve myocardial function by lowering the SVR. In this situation, they are weaned concomitantly with the inotropes, depending on the cardiac output and the blood pressure. Sodium nitroprusside and clevidipine have half‐lives of only two and one minute, respectively, but nicardipine has a duration of action of 4–6 hours.
  - **b.** In patients with preexisting hypertension, conversion from intravenous antihypertensives to oral agents can be tricky. Some patients require significant doses of multiple drugs to control their blood pressure, only to become hypotensive when the drugs take effect and sympathetic stimulation and the hormonal response to surgery abate. The initial drug is usually a β‐blocker (unless the patient is bradycardic), which is routinely used for prophylaxis of atrial fibrillation. An ACE inhibitor or ARB is then added, starting at a low dose if not used before or at a lower dose than used preoperatively. Amlodipine is another option, especially if the patient is bradycardic. Intravenous hydralazine can be used on a prn basis until higher doses of medications take effect.

#### **IV. Intra‐aortic Balloon Counterpulsation**

Intra‐aortic balloon counterpulsation provides hemodynamic support and/or control of ischemia both before and after surgery.130–132 In contrast to the inotropic drugs, the IABP provides physiologic assistance to the failing heart by decreasing myocardial oxygen demand and improving coronary perfusion. Although it is an invasive device with several potential complications, it has proven invaluable in improving the results of surgery in high‐risk patients and allowing for the survival of many patients with postcardiotomy ventricular dysfunction.

#### **A. Indications**

- **1.** Ongoing ischemia refractory to medical therapy or hemodynamic compromise prior to urgent or emergent surgery.
- **2.** Prophylactic placement prior to surgery for high‐risk patients with critical coronary disease (usually left main disease) or severe LV dysfunction – usually following cardiac catheterization, but occasionally at the beginning of surgery.133–136
- **3.** Unloading for mechanical complications of myocardial infarction (acute mitral regurgitation, ventricular septal rupture) prior to emergent surgery.
- **4.** High‐risk patients undergoing off‐pump surgery to maintain hemodynamic stability during lateral wall or posterior wall grafting.137
- **5.** Acute myocardial infarction primarily with, but occasionally without, cardiogenic shock. This remains a common indication for use of an IABP, yet most studies have not demonstrated any mortality benefit even when percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is performed.138–143 In this situation, use of a mechanical circulatory assist device may be preferable.144
- **6.** Prophylactic use during high‐risk PCI145
- **7.** Postcardiotomy low cardiac output syndrome unresponsive to moderate doses of multiple inotropic agents. One study devised a clinical risk score to predict the need for an IABP after CABG. These factors included older age, poor LV function, redo and emergency procedures, left main disease, recent MI, and class 3–4 symptoms.146 Although this study reported a 19% mortality rate in this situation, others have reported mortality rates of 30–50%.147,148
- **8.** Postoperative myocardial ischemia
- **9.** Acute deterioration of myocardial function (refractory heart failure) to provide temporary support or serve as a bridge to transplantation.

#### **B. Contraindications**

- **1.** Aortic regurgitation (unless mild)
- **2.** Aortic dissection/extensive aneurysmal disease
- **3.** Severe aortic and peripheral vascular atherosclerosis (balloon can be inserted via the ascending aorta during surgery)
- **4.** Sepsis

#### **C. Principles**

- **1.** The IABP reduces the impedance to LV ejection ("unloads the heart") by rapid deflation just before ventricular systole.
- **2.** It increases diastolic coronary perfusion pressure by rapid inflation just after aortic valve closure with improvement in native coronary, ITA, and graft diastolic flow.
- **3.** This sequence reduces the time–tension index (systolic wall tension) and increases the diastolic pressure–time index, favorably altering the myocardial oxygen supply:demand ratio.
- **4.** The IABP may also improve left ventricular diastolic function after surgery.149
- **5.** In patients with RV failure, the IABP may improve RV function by improving right coronary perfusion pressure and reducing RV afterload by decreasing LV filling pressures. However, the benefit of an IABP for severe RV failure is limited and further mechanical circulatory assist may be necessary.54,150–153

#### **D. Insertion techniques**

- **1.** The IABP is placed through the femoral artery with the balloon situated just distal to the left subclavian artery so as not to impair flow into the left internal thoracic artery (LITA) (Figure 11.1). Generally, a 50 mL balloon is selected for patients >162 cm (5'4") tall, using smaller balloons with shorter lengths (the Datascope 25 mL or 34 mL or Arrow 40 mL balloons) for smaller patients.
- **2.** Percutaneous insertion is performed by the Seldinger technique, placing the balloon over a guide wire and either through a sheath or without a sheath ("sheathless"). The catheter is usually 7.5 Fr in diameter. The sheath can be left in place or removed from the artery, especially if the femoral artery is small. Smaller‐caliber systems can minimize the reduction in flow that could cause distal ischemia, and are preferable in patients with peripheral vascular disease and diabetes. Sheathless insertion may cause shearing of the balloon during placement if significant iliofemoral disease is present. Although insertion of the IABP can be performed blindly in the OR or at the bedside, preoperative placement is usually performed in the cardiac cath lab using fluoroscopy to visualize the wire and the eventual location of the balloon. This may allow for placement through a tortuous iliofemoral system, which otherwise might be fraught with danger. During surgery, the position of the balloon catheter can be identified by TEE.
- **3.** Surgical insertion can be accomplished by exposing the femoral artery and placing the balloon through a sidearm graft or directly into the vessel through a pursestring suture. This is rarely required with current systems.
- **4.** Alternative cannulation sites in patients with severe aortoiliac disease include the ascending aorta during surgery and the subclavian or brachial artery.154,155 For

**Figure 11.1 •** The intra‐aortic balloon (IABP) is positioned just distal to the left subclavian artery. Balloon inflation occurs in early diastole and improves coronary perfusion pressure. Deflation occurs just before systole to reduce the impedance to left ventricular ejection. (Reproduced with permission from Maccioli et al., *J Cardiothorac Anesth* 1988;2:365–73.)

patients in whom long‐term IABP support is considered prior to transplantation, percutaneous insertion into the left axillary/subclavian artery can be used.156

#### **E. IABP timing** is performed from the ECG or the arterial waveform.

- **1.** ECG: input to the balloon console is provided from skin leads or the bedside monitor. Inflation is set for the peak of the T wave at the end of systole with deflation set just before or on the R wave. The use of bipolar pacing eliminates the interpretation of pacing spikes as QRS complexes by the console.
- **2.** Arterial waveform: inflation should occur at the dicrotic notch with deflation just before the onset of the aortic upstroke. This method is especially useful in the operating room, where electrocautery may interfere with the ECG signal.
- **3.** A typical arterial waveform during a 1:2 ratio of IABP inflation is demonstrated in Figures 11.2 and 11.3. This shows the systolic unloading (decrease in the balloon‐assisted systolic pressure and end‐diastolic pressure) and the diastolic augmentation (increase in the balloon‐assisted diastolic pressure) that are achieved with the IABP.
- **4.** Appropriate timing of inflation and deflation is essential. Proper timing should improve stroke volume and reduce LVESV and pressure. Early inflation may decrease stroke volume due to the abrupt increase in LV afterload during late systolic ejection. Late deflation will increase afterload during early ejection and decrease afterload during late ejection. This may increase stroke volume but also increase stroke work.
- **5.** During a cardiac arrest, ballooning may be synchronized to cardiac contractions using the pressure trigger mode. Without cardiac massage, an internal trigger at 100 inflations/minute should be used.

#### **F. IABP problems and complications**

**1. Inability to balloon.** Once the balloon is situated properly and has unwrapped, satisfactory ballooning should be achieved by proper timing of inflation and deflation. However, unsatisfactory ballooning can occur in the following situations.

![](_page_37_Figure_11.jpeg)

**Figure 11.2 •** IABP tracing at 1:2 inflation ratio. Note that the balloon aortic end‐diastolic pressure (1) is lower than the patient's aortic end‐diastolic pressure (2), and that the balloon‐ assisted peak systolic pressure (3) is lower than the systolic pressure that is generated without a preceding assisted beat (4). These changes reflect a decreased impedance to ejection during systole. Coronary perfusion pressure is increased by diastolic augmentation achieved by balloon inflation (5).

![](_page_38_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 11.3 •** IABP monitor showing the ECG, arterial pressure tracing with balloon augmentation, and balloon inflation/deflation pattern.

- **a.** Unipolar atrial pacing. This produces a large atrial pacing spike that can be interpreted by the console as a QRS complex leading to inappropriate inflation. Use of bipolar pacing eliminates this problem. Most monitoring equipment suppresses pacing signals.
- **b.** Rapid rates. Some balloon consoles are unable to inflate and deflate fast enough to accommodate heart rates over 150 (usually when there is a rapid ventricular response to atrial fibrillation). Augmentation can be performed with a 1:2 ratio.
- **c.** Arrhythmias. Atrial and ventricular ectopy can disrupt normal inflation and deflation patterns and must be treated.
- **d.** Volume loss from the balloon detected by the console monitor alarms. This indicates a leak in the system, either at the connectors or from the balloon itself. Volume loss may also indicate that the balloon has not unwrapped properly, preventing proper inflation.
- **e.** Balloon rupture. When blood appears in the balloon tubing, the balloon has perforated. Escape of gas (usually helium) from the balloon into the bloodstream can occur. **The balloon must be removed immediately.** Difficulty with removal (balloon entrapment) may be encountered if thrombus has formed within the balloon, and this tends to occur extremely quickly. Most consoles have alarms that will call attention to this problem and prevent the device from inflating.

#### **2. Vascular complications**

**a.** Catastrophic complications, such as aortic dissection, usually from inadvertent advancement of the guide wire into the vessel wall creating a false lumen, or rupture of the iliac artery or aorta, are very uncommon. Paraplegia can result from development of a periadventitial aortic hematoma or embolization of atherosclerotic debris.157 Bleeding around the balloon cable may occur if placed into a diseased vessel and can be problematic upon percutaneous removal.

- **b.** Embolization to visceral vessels, especially the mesenteric and renal arteries, can occur in the presence of significant aortic atherosclerosis, although balloon placement usually does not affect mesenteric flow.158 Cerebral embolization can occur if there are mobile atheromas in the proximal descending thoracic aorta.159 Renal ischemia may occur if the balloon is situated too low and inflates below the level of the diaphragm.160
- **c.** Distal ischemia is the most common complication of indwelling balloons, occurring in 8–18% of patients.161–163 It is more likely to occur with use of larger catheter sizes, so sheathless techniques are preferable. Ischemia is more likely when the IABP remains in place longer, and when the patient has impaired ventricular function, often requiring inotropic or vasopressor support.164 Additional risk factors include female gender (small femoral arteries), comorbidities (including diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and smoking), and peripheral vascular disease, especially involving the iliofemoral system. Thrombosis near the insertion site or distal thromboembolism can also occur and is related more to the duration of IABP usage. Use of intravenous heparin (maintaining a PTT of 1.5–2 times control) is advisable to minimize ischemic and thromboembolic problems if the balloon remains in place for more than a few days after surgery. Otherwise, patients have a low‐grade coagulopathy in the early postoperative period and anticoagulation is not necessary.
- **d.** The presence of distal pulses or Doppler signals **must be assessed frequently** in all patients with an IABP. This should be compared with a preoperative peripheral pulse examination. Not infrequently, cool extremities with weak signals are noted in the early postoperative period from peripheral vasoconstriction that may be associated with a low cardiac output state, hypothermia, or use of vasopressors. This should resolve when the patient warms and myocardial function improves. However, persistent ischemia jeopardizes the viability of the distal leg and could also lead to a compartment syndrome. Options at this time include:
  - **i.** Removing the sheath from the femoral artery if the balloon has been placed percutaneously.
  - **ii.** Removing the balloon if the patient appears to be hemodynamically stable. If adequate distal perfusion cannot be obtained, femoral exploration is indicated.
  - **iii.** Removing the balloon and placing it in the contralateral femoral artery (if that leg has adequate perfusion) if the patient is IABP‐dependent. Using as small a caliber balloon as possible with sheath removal is essential.
  - **iv.** Considering placement of the balloon through another site, such as the axillary/subclavian artery.156
- **3. Thrombocytopenia.** Persistent inflation and deflation of the IABP will destroy circulating platelets, with thrombocytopenia being noted in about 50% of patients. It is not always clear whether progressive thrombocytopenia is caused by the IABP or by medications that the patient may be receiving, such as heparin. Platelet counts must be checked on a daily basis.
- **4. Sepsis** may occur with longer duration of IABP usage.

#### **G. Weaning of the IABP**

- **1.** IABP support can be withdrawn when the cardiac output is satisfactory on minimal inotropic support (usually 1 μg/min of epinephrine, 5 μg/kg/min of dobutamine, or ≤0.5 μg/kg/min of milrinone). However, earlier removal may be indicated if complications develop, such as leg ischemia, balloon malfunction, thrombocytopenia, or infection.
- **2.** Weaning is initiated by decreasing the inflation ratio from 1:1 to 1:2 for about 2–4 hours, and then to 1:3 or 1:4 (depending on which console device is used) for 1–2 more hours. If the patient is not heparinized, the duration at a low inflation ratio should be minimized. Once it is determined that the patient can tolerate a low inflation ratio with stable hemodynamics, the IABP should be removed. Recovery of LV function is usually suggested when the arterial tracing suggests a good stroke volume with a systolic pressure that approaches or exceeds the diastolic augmentation pressure on the monitor. Remember that the IABP produces efficient unloading, and the blood pressure noted on the monitor is lower during balloon assistance than with an unassisted beat (actually the diastolic pressure is higher, but the true systolic pressure is lower). Thus, visual improvement in blood pressure with weaning of the IABP is not, by itself, a sensitive measure of the patient's progress. If there is an anticipated delay in removal of more than a few hours for manpower reasons or because of the need to correct a coagulopathy, the ratio should be maintained at 1:1 or 1:2 to prevent thrombus formation on the balloon.

#### **H. IABP removal techniques**

**1.** Balloons inserted by the percutaneous technique can usually be removed percutaneously. This is performed by compressing the groin distal to the insertion site as the balloon is removed, allowing blood to flush out the skin wound for 1–2 heart beats, and then compressing just proximal to the skin hole where the arterial puncture site is located (Figure 11.4). Pressure must be maintained for at least 45 minutes to ensure satisfactory sealing at the puncture site. This may on occasion cause thrombosis of the vessel, so a distal pulse examination during and after compression is essential. **Note:** it is important to resist the temptation to remove manual pressure

![](_page_40_Figure_7.jpeg)

**Figure 11.4 •** Technique of percutaneous balloon removal. Initial compression is held below the level of the arterial puncture site to allow for flushing of blood. However, subsequent pressure should be maintained over the arterial puncture site to prevent bleeding. Note that the hole in the artery lies more cephalad than the hole in the skin. (Modified from Rodigas and Finnegan, *Ann Thorac Surg* 1985;40:80–1.)

- and peek to see if hemostasis is achieved. This can be counterproductive and flush away immature clot that is sealing the vessel. Improved hemostasis may be obtained using the D‐STAT Dry (Teleflex) or QuikClot (Z‐Medica) hemostatic pads.
- **2. Note:** coagulation parameters must be checked and corrected before percutaneous removal or the patient may require groin exploration for persistent hemorrhage or a false aneurysm.
- **3.** Surgical removal should be considered in patients with small or diseased vessels and in those with very weak pulses or Doppler signals with the balloon in place. The need for a thrombectomy and embolectomy may be anticipated in these patients. If the IABP has been in place for more than five days, percutaneous removal can be performed, but there is a greater chance that surgical repair of the femoral artery may be required.

#### **I. Results of IABP usage**

- **1.** The indications for placement of an IABP are virtually all high‐risk situations with high mortality rates despite some benefits of the IABP. Preoperative placement for cardiogenic shock or active ischemia is associated with high operative mortality. Results are the best when an IABP is placed prophylactically in the cath lab or prior to surgery in "high risk" patients, specifically those with threatening anatomy and/or poor LV function who are hemodynamically stable. In these situations, use of an IABP has been shown to lower the likelihood of postoperative low cardiac output syndrome and operative mortality.133–136 Patients receiving an IABP for postcardiotomy support have already demonstrated failure of pharmacologic management to achieve satisfactory hemodynamics, and most studies have shown a 30–50% mortality in such patients, which is greatest if the IABP is placed postoperatively.146–148
- **2.** One study showed that the most significant correlate of operative mortality in patients requiring an IABP was a serum lactate level >10 mmol/L during the first eight hours of support (100% mortality). Additional poor prognostic signs were a metabolic acidosis (base deficit >10 mmol/L), mean arterial pressure <60 mm Hg, urine output <30 mL/h for two hours, and the requirement for high doses of epinephrine or norepinephrine (>10 μg/min) during the early postoperative period.165

#### **V. Mechanical Circulatory Support**

- **A.** If a patient cannot be weaned from CPB despite maximal pharmacologic support and use of an IABP, consideration should be given to use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or placement of a circulatory assist device for mechanical circulatory support (MCS). These devices provide flow to support the systemic and/or pulmonary circulation while resting the heart, allowing it to undergo metabolic and functional recovery. In some cases, weaning and removal of the device may be possible after several days of recovery. In others, weaning is not possible, and conversion to a long‐term device as a bridge to transplantation or for destination therapy must be considered.
- **B. Clinical conditions** that may benefit from MCS include:
  - **1.** Postcardiotomy ventricular dysfunction refractory to maximal medical therapy and an IABP. Although left ventricular and right ventricular assist devices (LVADs and RVADs) may be used, biventricular failure is not uncommon and is often

- associated with hypoxemic respiratory failure from a long pump run. Therefore, short‐term ECMO is often the easiest way to provide initial support.166,167
- **2.** Acute myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock. Percutaneous LVADs can provide superior hemodynamic support to that which can be achieved with an IABP, but only the use of MCS prior to PCI improves results.142,168–171
- **3.** Supporting high‐risk interventions in the cath lab. Studies comparing Impella‐ and IABP‐supported procedures showed improved event‐free survival with use of an Impella, but not with IABPs.172–174
- **4.** Resuscitation from cardiac arrest175
- **5.** Patients with class IV heart failure and deteriorating clinical status in INTERMACS classes 1–5. Bridging to transplantation or destination therapy with long‐term devices may be indicated for patients with HF from advanced cardiomyopathies, but temporary support may also be useful in patients with myocarditis, which may have a self‐limited course.

#### **C. Basic principles of VADs**

- **1.** VADs are preload‐dependent, so their output is reduced with low filling pressures either from hypovolemia or cardiac tamponade, which restricts atrial filling and decreases cardiac output. The centrifugal and axial pumps are also afterload‐sensitive, such that an increase in blood pressure will decrease pump flow/output.
- **2.** VADs decompress an overdistended ventricle to allow it to recover some function, although unloading of the left ventricle with an LVAD can precipitate RV failure. Unloading is comparable with nonpulsatile continuous flow devices and earlier pulsatile devices.176,177 ECMO does not unload the left ventricle or reduce oxygen demand as well as VADs and can exacerbate myocardial ischemia or precipitate pulmonary edema, but additional support with an IABP or LVAD can address that concern.178
- **3.** VADs provide pulmonary (RVAD) or systemic (LVAD) flow, in contrast to the IABP, which supports ventricular function only by systolic unloading. The improvement in systolic flow, independent of pulsatility, usually allows organ system function to improve.179
- **4.** VADs function independently of the ECG and can keep a patient alive during ventricular fibrillation (VF).
- **5.** They require an energy source.
- **6.** They require anticoagulation despite attempts at biocompatibility.
- **7.** They are associated with multiple major complications, including infection, bleeding, stroke, and device malfunction.

#### **D. Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs)**

**1. Technique and hemodynamics.** Drainage of oxygenated blood from the left atrium or ventricle passes through the pump and is returned to the ascending aorta. This will provide systemic perfusion while decompressing the left ventricle. LV wall stress is reduced by about 80% with a 40% decrease in myocardial oxygen demand. LVAD flow is dependent on adequate intravascular volume and right ventricular function. Although volume unloading might be superior with the early generation pulsatile pumps, left ventricular pressure unloading is generally considered comparable with nonpulsatile (centrifugal or axial flow) pumps.176,177

- **2. Indications** (Table 11.7). The general indications for LVAD insertion are the presence of a cardiac index <1.8 L/min/m2 with a systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg and a PCW pressure or LAP >20 mm Hg on maximal medical support and an IABP. In the postcardiotomy patient, an extensive delay in initiating VAD support increases the risk of multisystem organ failure and death.180 Any of the clinical situations listed in section V.B with primarily LV failure may benefit from LVAD insertion.
- **3. Contraindications** to the use of an LVAD vary depending on the access and drainage sites of the particular device.
  - **a.** General contraindications include aortic regurgitation, a mechanical aortic valve, aortic aneurysm/dissection, left heart thrombus (atrial or ventricular), iliofemoral disease for percutaneous systems, and sepsis.
  - **b.** When the indications for LVAD placement are present, critical elements of decision‐making include whether there is a reasonable chance of recovery, whether the patient is a candidate for transplantation or destination therapy if there is little chance for recovery, whether RVAD placement is also indicated, and whether placement is contraindicated based upon noncardiac comorbidities. Generally, one must consider the patient's age and general medical condition, the status of RV function, noncardiac organ system function (neurologic, pulmonary, renal, hepatic), and other medical issues (infectious, vascular disease, diabetes), in making this critical decision, whether for postcardiotomy support or for heart failure patients. Risk models to assess survivability after LVAD implantation in heart failure patients are helpful in reaching the appropriate decision.181

#### **4. Devices to provide LVAD support** (see sections H and I, pages 565–571)

- **a.** Postcardiotomy support is most readily achieved using systems that use central cannulation sites that are exposed during open‐heart surgery via a sternotomy. The CentriMag system (Abbott) can be used for LVAD support using left atrial (LA) and aortic cannulation, for RVAD support using right atrial and pulmonary artery cannulation, and for ECMO using right atrial and aortic cannulation with an oxygenator added to the circuit.182–184 An alternative is the Impella LD (Abiomed), which is inserted directly through the ascending aorta into the left ventricle.185
- **b.** Percutaneous devices are used for procedures performed in the cath lab or hybrid operating room, and can be placed in a postcardiotomy patient. These include the Impella series and the TandemHeart (TandemLife, LivaNova).186 The Impella can also be inserted through the subclavian/axillary artery, either via a cutdown or percutaneously.
- **c.** Long‐term devices for bridging and destination therapy include the second‐ generation HeartMate II (HM II) and HeartWare, and the third‐generation HeartMate 3 (HM 3) (Abbott).

#### **5. Management** during LVAD support

- **a.** LVAD flow is initiated to achieve a systemic flow of 2.2 L/min/m2 with an LA pressure of 10–15 mm Hg. The flow rate of centrifugal or axial flow devices can be preset on a console, with limitations to flow being hypovolemia, improper position of the drainage catheter, or RV failure. Adequacy of tissue perfusion can be assessed by mixed venous oxygen saturations.
- **b.** To decrease myocardial oxygen demand and allow for ventricular recovery, vasoactive medications should be used only as necessary to support RV function or increase systemic resistance to maintain a MAP >75 mm Hg. α‐agents or vasopressin may be necessary because LVAD patients commonly manifest "vasodilatory shock".187
- **c.** Heparinization is recommended to achieve a PTT of 2–2.5 times normal or an ACT of 185–200 seconds for most short‐term assist devices once perioperative bleeding has ceased. An infusion of 500 units/h of heparin usually suffices, although most patients become heparin‐resistant. For pump flows <3 L/min or during weaning attempts, the PTT and ACT should be increased to 2.5–3 times normal and 250–300 seconds, respectively. Anticoagulation is also required in patients with bioprosthetic or mechanical valves.
- **d.** When used for temporary postcardiotomy support, LV function is assessed by TEE after at least 48 hours of support. However, weaning is rarely possible before five days of support. Flow is reduced in 0.5 L/min intervals every five minutes to 2 L/min with careful observation of regional and global wall motion, filling pressures, and systemic pressure. Low‐dose inotropic support can be initiated during the weaning process. If adequate recovery has occurred, the device may be explanted.
- **e.** Note that external compressions during VF are feasible with percutaneous and continuous flow devices, but generally are not recommended, because they can cause displacement of the devices.188
- **6. Overall results.** The mortality rate associated with VAD usage for postcardiotomy support depends on how aggressively one manages a low output syndrome. Because

of the high incidence of bleeding and other organ system problems associated with VADs, there is often a reluctance to insert the device "prematurely", because in many cases, the heart will gradually improve with time on pharmacologic and IABP support without organ system sequelae. Although there are concerns that complications associated with premature VAD insertion could compromise outcomes, an early, aggressive approach to VAD insertion may lower mortality rates, not just because the patient might have survived without it, but because it might avoid the adverse sequelae of a prolonged low cardiac output syndrome in some patients.

- **a.** In general, it has been estimated that about 50% of patients receiving LVADs for postcardiotomy support are discharged from the hospital.189 The RECOVER I study noted a 93% hospital survival with use of the Impella 5.0/ LD for postcardiotomy circulatory support.185 Improved survival may be noted in patients with preserved RV function, no evidence of a perioperative MI, and recovery of LV function within 48–72 hours.
- **b.** If ventricular function does not recover after a week of support with a short‐ term device, a longer‐term device should be considered for destination therapy or as a bridge to transplantation. Survival following transplantation is similar to that of patients not requiring bridging with mechanical circulatory support.190

#### **E. Right ventricular assist devices (RVADs)**142,191–197

- **1. Technique and hemodynamics.** Deoxygenated blood is drained from the right atrium and returned to the pulmonary artery, thus providing pulmonary blood flow while decompressing the right ventricle. Achieving satisfactory systemic flow rates depends on having adequate intravascular volume and satisfactory LV function. Although isolated RV failure may occur, it is more commonly associated with LV failure and often with oxygenation issues in the postcardiotomy period that might benefit preferentially from ECMO.
- **2. Indications** (Table 11.7). RVAD insertion is indicated when there is evidence of severe RV dysfunction with a high CVP (usually >20mmHg) and inability to maintain a satisfactory cardiac output despite maximal pharmacologic therapy (usually epinephrine/milrinone and an IABP). RV failure may result from an RV infarction, worsening of preexisting RV dysfunction caused by PH or correction of severe tricuspid regurgitation, or poor intraoperative protection. RV dysfunction is exacerbated by an elevation in PVR, which can often be attributed to proinflammatory cytokines due to CPB, noncardiogenic or cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and microembolization from multiple blood product transfusions. Evidence of severe RV dysfunction with vasopressor‐refractory low cardiac output syndrome, hypotension, oliguria, and lactic acidosis is highly predictive of mortality; therefore, early RVAD placement should be considered in such a patient. LVAD placement may also lead to RV failure, for which RVAD support may also be required.

#### **3. Available systems for RV assist**

- **a.** Postcardiotomy support is best provided by the CentriMag system using cannulas placed directly into the right atrium and pulmonary artery. The percutaneously placed systems can be used, but they require a hybrid OR with appropriate radiographic imaging for placement.
- **b.** The **Impella RP** is an 11 Fr catheter with a 22 Fr pump motor (Figure 11.5) that is placed via the femoral vein and propels blood from the right atrium

![](_page_46_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 11.5 •** (A, B) The Impella RP device is advanced from the femoral vein into the right atrium, across the tricuspid valve into the pulmonary artery. The inlet area lies in the inferior vena cava near the IVC–right atrial junction and the outlet lies in the pulmonary artery.

- directly into the PA at a rate of up to 4 L/min, resulting in a reduction in RA pressure and an increase in mean PA pressure. The device will increase LV preload, so it can only be used when there is satisfactory LV function; otherwise, increased LV preload and afterload may result in pulmonary edema.191–195
- **c.** The TandemHeart RVAD has been used to provide RV support by placing one 62 cm cannula into the RA through the femoral vein to drain blood into the pump, with blood return via a 72 cm cannula placed through the contralateral femoral vein and positioned in the PA. This produces similar hemodynamic benefits as the Impella RP, but it leaves the patient bedbound with femoral cannulas and has been replaced by the Tandem Protek Duo system.
- **d.** The TandemLife Protek Duo system uses a dual lumen catheter placed via the right internal jugular vein that drains blood from the right atrium, passes it through the TandemHeart pump, and returns it to the pulmonary artery at a rate of up to 4.5 L/min (Figure 11.6). An oxygenator can also be placed in the circuit to improve systemic oxygenation.196,197
- **e.** RV and LV support can also be achieved using a veno‐arterial ECMO circuit.

![](_page_47_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 11.6 •** The Tandem Heart Protek Duo system to provide RV support uses a dual lumen catheter that drains blood from the right atrium and returns it to the pulmonary artery. This can be combined with an oxygenator to provide ECMO support as well.

#### **4. Management** during RVAD support

- **a.** RVAD flow is initiated to achieve a flow rate of 2.2 L/min/m2 , increasing the LA pressure to 15 mm Hg while maintaining an RA pressure of 5–10 mm Hg. The flow rate of centrifugal or axial flow devices can be preset on a console. Inability to achieve satisfactory flow rates may indicate hypovolemia, improper position of the drainage catheter, or cardiac tamponade that compresses the right atrium. If intravascular volume is adequate and tamponade is not present, systemic hypotension may result from systemic vasodilation that requires use of an α‐agent or vasopressin. If impaired LV function is present, additional inotropic, IABP, LVAD, or ECMO support may be necessary. TEE is helpful in evaluating the status of LV function in patients on RVAD support.
- **b.** Pulmonary vasodilators, including IV milrinone, inhaled NO, epoprostenol, iloprost, or milrinone, or oral sildenafil, may be beneficial in reducing pulmonary artery pressures and RV afterload, allowing for recovery of RV function.
- **c.** The requirement for heparinization is similar to that for LVADs.
- **d.** Assessment of myocardial recovery by TEE and weaning of the device are similar to LVADs.

**5. Overall results.** Patients receiving isolated RVADs for acute RV failure have about a 70% one‐month survival.191–193 However, patients requiring RVAD support for postcardiotomy support fair much worse, with limited data suggesting survival rates of only 25%.194

#### **F. Biventricular assist devices (BiVADs)**

- **1. Technique and hemodynamics.** BiVADs incorporate the drainage sites of both RVAD and LVAD systems. They provide support of both the pulmonary and systemic circulations but do not provide oxygenation, and can function during periods of VF. In the postcardiotomy patient, ECMO is more readily accomplished using the cannulas already in place for CPB and is used for short‐term support.
  - **a.** In patients receiving continuous flow LVADs, RV failure is noted in about 15–20% of patients and can often be managed with pulmonary vasodilators and inotropic support. However, RVAD support will be necessary in about 4–5% of these patients. This is less than previously noted with pulsatile devices as complete LV unloading can be avoided, resulting in less septal shift with better preservation of RV mechanics.198 Generally, an acute increase in LV unloading with an increase in RV preload may distort RV geometry and unmask RV dysfunction.199
  - **b.** Numerous studies have evaluated predictors for RV failure and the necessity for additional RVAD assist in patients receiving LVADs.200–204 These predictors include:
    - **i.** A higher severity of global illness: patients in INTERMACS I‐II, preop ECMO or renal replacement therapy, severe tricuspid regurgitation, reoperative surgery, and concomitant procedures other than TV repair at the time of LVAD implantation.
    - **ii.** Hemodynamic instability: high RA pressures (specifically an RA/PCW ratio >0.63), reduced pulmonary artery pulse pressure, stroke volume, stroke work index, and cardiac output, and the requirement for multiple vasoactive drugs to maintain flow.
    - **iii.** End‐organ dysfunction: preoperative ventilatory support, hepatic or renal dysfunction.
    - **iv.** One study proposed an echo score which was predictive of RV failure to identify patients who might benefit from RVAD support. These included a higher RA pressure, lower RV fractional area change, and lower LA volume.203 Another study designed an RV failure risk score based on vasopressor requirement, abnormal LFTs, and abnormal renal function.204

#### **2. Available devices**

- **a.** Postcardiotomy BiVAD support can be achieved using two CentriMag devices using RA/PA and LA/aortic cannulation through a median sternotomy. Percutaneous systems combining an Impella RP or Protek Duo with a left‐ sided Impella device can also be used.205,206
- **b.** If the patient requires longer‐term BiVAD support, the HM II, HM 3, or the HeartWare system (Medtronic) is implanted and is combined with either an Impella RP inserted via the axillary artery or the TandemHeart Protek Duo inserted via the internal jugular vein.

#### **3. Management** during BiVAD support

- **a.** Sequential manipulations of RVAD and LVAD flow are used to achieve a systemic flow rate of 2.2 L/min/m2 . The RVAD flow is increased to raise the LA pressure to 15–20 mm Hg, and then the LVAD flow is increased to reduce the LA pressure to 5–10 mm Hg. Inability to achieve satisfactory flow rates usually indicates hypovolemia, tamponade, or catheter malposition on either side. Left‐ and right‐sided flow rates may differ because of varying contributions of the native ventricles to pulmonary or systemic flow.
- **b.** Heparin requirements are similar to those noted above for LVADs.
- **c.** Assessment of recovery and weaning are similar to the methods described for RVAD and LVAD devices.
- **4. Overall results.** The requirement for biventricular support has an adverse effect on survival. However, one report on BiVAD support for postcardiotomy low cardiac output syndrome with the CentriMag system showed a 56% 30‐day survival.182

#### **G. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)**207,208

- **1.** ECMO is a form of extracorporeal life support (ECLS) that serves as an alternative to ventricular assist devices. The system employs a membrane oxygenator, centrifugal pump, heat exchanger, oxygen blender, and a heparin‐coated circuit. The latter provides a more biocompatible surface that minimizes platelet activation and the systemic inflammatory response, and reduces the heparin requirement. This allows the ECMO circuit to be used for several days.
- **2. Indications.** ECMO is indicated for the short‐term treatment of severe postcardiotomy ventricular dysfunction with or without hypoxemia. Criteria for use are similar to those for left ventricular or biventricular assist. In many patients requiring VAD support, the duration of CPB is quite long due to the delay in deciding to proceed with VAD support, often resulting in both cardiogenic and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema that impairs oxygenation. ECMO can also be used emergently in patients sustaining a cardiac arrest and in patients with severe hypoxemic ARDS, while the lung recovers from the inciting pathologic insult. Veno‐venous ECMO is used for pulmonary support alone (see Figure 5.12, page 314).
- **3. Technique.** At the conclusion of surgery, the same cannulation setup used for CPB is maintained (right atrium and aorta). If ECMO is considered subsequently, it may be established with venous drainage from the internal jugular vein or femoral vein with return of blood to the femoral, axillary, or carotid artery (Figure 11.7). Steps should be taken to ensure distal perfusion with the use of femoral arterial cannulation (see page 312). Because ECMO does not produce LV unloading, it may cause ventricular distention with rising filling pressures and will worsen myocardial oxygen demand. Therefore, either an IABP or preferably an Impella should be considered to unload the LV.178 Percutaneous femorofemoral bypass may be used to resuscitate a patient from cardiac arrest.
- **4. Management.** Maximal medical support is essential to optimize the results of ECMO. Some of the essential elements are:
  - **a.** Optimizing preload to provide pulmonary perfusion.
  - **b.** Supporting SVR with α‐agents or vasopressin; however, elevated SVR and bronchial venous return to the left ventricle can elevate LV pressures and cause

**Figure 11.7 •** Cannulation sites for veno‐arterial ECMO. (A) Venous return from the femoral vein is pumped via a centrifugal pump through an oxygenator and returned to the femoral artery, axillary/subclavian artery, or the carotid artery. (B) The Cardiohelp system is a portable unit for ECMO that includes a centrifugal pump and oxygenator which allows for easy transport. At the conclusion of surgery, right atrial and aortic cannulation sites may be used instead of peripheral cannulation. (C) Close‐up of the front of the Cardiohelp console.

LV thrombus formation or pulmonary edema. Since the LV is not unloaded, additional support (IABP or Impella) may be indicated to prevent pulmonary edema and worsening of LV function.

- **c.** Use of femoral artery–femoral vein ECMO may cause coronary or cerebral ischemia if there is any cardiac ejection.142
- **d.** Aggressive use of pulmonary vasodilators for PH.
- **e.** Early and aggressive use of renal replacement therapy.

- **f.** Use of low tidal volume ventilation.
- **g.** Minimizing bleeding by initiating anticoagulation after mediastinal bleeding is at a minimum and use of low ACTs in the heparin‐coated circuit.
- **5.** If the patient has suffered a severe neurologic insult or is not considered a candidate for transplantation, ECMO is usually terminated after 48 hours. If the heart does not recover after up to one week of ECMO support, a clinical decision must be made about conversion to long‐term support. Detailed assessment of neurologic, pulmonary, hepatic, and renal status is essential. It is sometimes difficult to ascertain whether the patient has survivable or nonsurvivable organ system dysfunction that might contraindicate LVAD implantation.
- **6. Results.** The results of ECMO depend on the indication for its use and the degree of organ system failure at the time it is initiated.
  - **a.** About one‐third of patients receiving ECMO for postcardiotomy support will survive for 30 days, but most would have died without support.166,167,209–212 A study of ECMO vs. VAD support for postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock found better survival in patients receiving VADs, and in that study only 16% of patients on ECMO support survived the hospital stay.213
  - **b.** A large multicenter study provided a postcardiotomy ECMO score to quantify the mortality risk. This included female gender (1 point), advanced age (60–69, 2 points, >70, 4 points), prior cardiac surgery (1 point), lactate >6 mmol/L prior to ECMO (2 points), aortic arch surgery (2 points), and preoperative stroke/coma (5 points). Mortality rate was 45–57% for 1–3 points, but increased to 70% or greater for ≥4 points.210 Another study confirmed that older age, an elevated lactate level (>4 mmol/L after 48 hours), and hepatic and renal failure were associated with higher mortality.211
  - **c.** One study reported a 31% survival in patients undergoing emergent ECMO for prolonged cardiac arrest.214
  - **d.** Complications are not insignificant with ECMO. A meta‐analysis reported a 47% need for dialysis, 43% reoperations for bleeding, 15% mediastinal wound infections, 11% neurologic events, and an 11% incidence of lower limb ischemia.212

#### **H. Short‐term devices to provide ventricular assist**

- **1. Short‐term support for high‐risk PCI or cardiogenic shock** is best provided with percutaneous systems that require fluoroscopic imaging for their insertion. This is usually performed in the cath lab or hybrid operating room.
  - **a.** The **Impella** series includes LVAD devices, such as the Impella 2.5, CP, and 5.0 devices, which provide increasing amounts of systemic flow, and the Impella RP, which provides RV support.
    - **i.** The Impella 5.0 is a 9 Fr catheter with a 21 F pump motor that is inserted through the femoral artery and positioned across the aortic valve into the left ventricle (Figure 11.8). This axial‐flow device withdraws blood from the distal end of the catheter in the LV and pumps it into the ascending aorta. The Impella CP is a 9 Fr catheter with a 14 Fr pump motor that can provide 4L/min flow and is preferred during high‐risk PCI.
    - **ii.** The Impella RP is designed for RVAD support.

![](_page_52_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 11.8 •** The Impella devices. (A) The basic design of the catheter with an inlet that lies within the left ventricle and an outlet within the ascending aorta, next to which is located the rotary pump. (B, C) The Impella 2.5 device (12 Fr pump motor diameter), Impella CP (14 Fr diameter), and Impella 5 (21 Fr pump motor diameter) devices have similar designs and are placed percutaneously to lie across the aortic valve.

**b.** The **TandemHeart (PTVA)** system (LivaNova) is a continuous‐flow centrifugal pump that can provide up to 5 L/min flow (Figure 11.9). It consists of a 21 Fr transseptal cannula placed percutaneously through the femoral vein and positioned across the atrial septum into the left atrium. Blood drains into a dual‐chamber pump which uses a magnetically driven impeller to pump the blood back to the patient through 15 or 17 Fr cannulas placed into one or both femoral arteries. Anticoagulation with heparin to achieve a PTT of 2.5–3 times normal (65–80 seconds) or an ACT >200 seconds is recommended. This device can also be used for postcardiotomy LVAD support with direct LA or LV and aortic cannulation, or as an RVAD for postcardiotomy support or cardiogenic

shock from an RV infarct with percutaneous or direct placement of cannulas into the RA and PA. Use of the TandemLife Protek Duo allows for RV support through a cannula placed through the right internal jugular vein.196,197

- **2. Short‐term postcardiotomy support** can be achieved using continuous‐flow (centrifugal, axial) devices that can implanted during surgery. These are the most readily available, easy‐to‐use systems for uni‐ or biventricular short‐term support. Their use is usually limited to several weeks, at which time conversion to long‐ term devices may be necessary if recovery does not occur.
  - **a.** The **CentriMag** is a centrifugal pump that uses standard cannulation techniques and can provide RVAD, LVAD, or ECMO support by placing a membrane oxygenator in the circuit. This pump uses a magnetically levitated rotor to propel blood forward at a rate of up to 10L/min (Figure 11.10). This avoids friction to minimize blood trauma and hemolysis and can be used for several months of support, although the pump head and external circuit may need to be changed after six weeks. Heparinization to achieve a PTT of 60–100 seconds is recommended.

![](_page_54_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 11.10 •** The CentriMag centrifugal motor and pump and a larger image of the pump head.

- **b.** In the absence of an approved device, the **Bio‐Medicus** (Medtronic) centrifugal pump that is routinely used for CPB can be used successfully to provide a brief period of uni‐ or biventricular support until other devices can be implanted. These systems can also be used in ECMO circuits.
- **c.** The Impella LD device is inserted directly through a graft in the ascending aorta.
- **d.** The Impella 5.0 device can be inserted through an axillary/subclavian approach usually via a cutdown.215
- **e.** ECMO can be established using the right atrial and aortic cannulas from CPB. Several systems, including the CentriMag device with a oxygenator spliced into the system (Quadrox, MAQUET), and the Cardiohelp system (Getinge), which uses the MAQUET Rotaflow magnetically levitated centrifugal pump that produces minimal hemolysis, can be used to provide ECMO support (Figure 11.7). The latter is a fairly compact system that allows for transport to tertiary care hospitals.216,217
- **3.** If myocardial recovery does not occur, a clinical decision must be made as to whether a device capable of longer‐term support should be implanted either as a bridge to transplantation or destination therapy, based primarily upon the patient's neurologic function and organ system recovery. Thus, these devices are implanted as a "bridge to decision".218
- **I. Long‐term devices** have evolved from bulky, paracorporeal, and intracorporeal pulsatile systems to smaller, intracorporeal, nonpulsatile, continuous flow devices that are more biocompatible and have improved durability with newer designs. These systems are valve‐less and designed with a permanent magnetic field that rapidly spins a simple impeller supported by mechanical bearings. They are preload‐ and afterload‐sensitive and can provide unloading comparable to that of pulsatile devices. However, the degree of unloading can be prescribed, such that excessive LV unloading that can lead to RV failure can be minimized. These devices are effective in maintaining organ system perfusion and can be used as long‐term bridges to transplantation or for destination therapy

in patients who are not considered transplant candidates. Technologic advances in newer generation systems have resulted in smaller devices with improved biocompatibility, more durability, and fewer complications, including device thrombosis.

- **1.** The **Impella 5.0** can be used for long‐term support as a bridge to transplantation. It can flow up to 5 L/min. It is inserted through the axillary artery, thus enabling the patient to ambulate.215
- **2.** The **HeartMate II** (HM II) is a continuous axial flow device with a rotary pump that can provide up to 10 L/min flow.219 The inflow cannula is placed through the LV apex, and the outflow cannula is sewn to the ascending aorta (Figure 11.11). The pump is inserted in a preperitoneal pocket with a drive line exiting the right upper quadrant. Early anticoagulation with heparin has been used, but it can contribute to bleeding and is probably not essential. The patient is then maintained on warfarin with a target INR of around 2.0. This device is an excellent bridge to transplantation and has also been used for destination therapy.
- **3. The HeartWare** device (HVAD) (Medtronic) is a very small 160 g device implanted through the left ventricular apex which consists of a small centrifugal pump that relies on magnetic and hydrodynamic rotor levitation to generate up to 10 L/min of flow that is returned to the aorta through a 10 mm graft (Figure 11.12).220 It has one moving part and no mechanical bearings. It can be used as a bridge or for destination therapy.
- **4.** The **HeartMate 3** (HM 3) is a continuous flow centrifugal pump that is partially inserted into the left ventricular apex with return of up to 10 L/min of flow through a graft sewn to the ascending aorta (Figure 11.13). The technological advance is the use of "Full MagLev™" (magnetically levitated) technology that allows the device's

rotor to be suspended by magnetic forces. Since the parts "float", there is no friction and therefore less wear and tear on the rotor. This contact‐free environment is designed to optimize hemocompatibility and reduce blood trauma through gentle blood handling. There is also "artificial pulse technology" designed to promote washing of the pump to prevent the formation of zones of recirculation and stasis.221 It can be used as a bridge to transplantation or for destination therapy.

**5.** Other axial/rotary flow pumps that have been used successfully as bridges to transplantation and for destination therapy include the **Jarvik 2000** ( Jarvik Heart) and **Heart Assist 5** (Reliant Heart) devices.222,223

- **6.** The **HeartWare miniaturized VAD** (MVAD) uses hydrodynamic levitation with a layer of blood to lift the rotor. Blood flow follows the axis of rotation of the impeller, but exits perpendicular to inflow. This lowers shear stress on the impeller and optimizes blood flow paths, which is expected to improve hemodynamic performance. The system also incorporates a pulsatility algorithm called the qPulse™ Cycle individualized for each patient to enhance aortic valve function and reduce chronic bleeding. This device was not approved as of mid‐2020.224
- **7.** Total artificial hearts (TAHs) potentially hold promise for destination therapy, but are only approved as bridges to transplantation. The most commonly implanted TAH is the **SynCardia** system, which is an offshoot of the Jarvik 7 heart, first implanted in 1988 (Figure 11.14). It consists of two artificial ventricles with mechanical valves, and a pneumatic drive line that compresses a polyurethane diaphragm and can generate up to 9 L/min of flow.225–227
- **8.** A number of other devices have been developed and evaluated for long‐term ventricular assist with the objective of minimizing complications and improving durability. Advances include technology to provide pulsatility, enable physiologic feedback to control flow, and reduce shear stress to improve biocompatibility, which should reduce platelet activation, hemolysis, and von Willebrand factor degradation, which contributes to bleeding. Some of these advances are present in the HM 3 and HeartWare MVAD devices. Improved transcutaneous energy transmission systems should reduce the risk of infection.

- J. Complications. <sup>188,199</sup> The evolution from early-generation pulsatile pumps (Novacor, Thoratec, Abiomed BV, HeartMate XVE) to axial and continuous flow pumps has reduced but not eliminated the many complications associated with the use of MCS. The most common morbidities with use of short-term assist devices are bleeding, stroke, and organ system failure, the latter usually due to hypoperfusion or hypotension before circulatory assist is initiated. Other complications associated with these devices include the following:
  - 1. Bleeding. Despite reversal of anticoagulation, a substantial percentage of patients (up to 60%) require re-exploration for evacuation of mediastinal clot that can cause tamponade (manifested by inadequate drainage into the device). Contributing factors include coagulopathies related to a long duration of CPB in postcardiotomy patients, the large amount of dead space around the catheters in the mediastinum, often an open chest, and the use of early postoperative anticoagulation to minimize thrombus formation within the devices. Although early anticoagulation is desirable, it must be withheld until bleeding is at minimum.
    - **a.** Gastrointestinal bleeding is noted in 15–30% of patients due to the use of anticoagulation, low pulsatility, development of AV malformations, and acquired von Willebrand factor (vWF) deficiency. The latter is caused by the high sheer stress that causes degradation of vWF high-molecular-weight

- multimers and may be less common with the HM 3 system because of lower sheer stress.228
- **b.** Hemolysis, fibrinolysis, and platelet dysfunction are common with LVADs.229
- **c.** Heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) was noted in 26% of patients in one report.230 Use of warfarin for device thromboprophylaxis and an alternative anticoagulant at the time of transplantation may be necessary unless the time from the diagnosis of HIT to transplantation exceeds three months.
- **2. Mediastinitis and sepsis.** With the use of implantable devices, infection is usually related to the drive lines for energy transmission, which exit through the skin. About 20% of patients will develop drive line infections and 15–20% will develop mediastinitis or sepsis.231,232 Because long‐term antibiotic usage is commonplace, resistant organisms are often identified. In addition, many patients are debilitated and malnourished and have numerous intravascular and other invasive catheters that can become colonized. The most common organisms are *Staphylococcus aureus* and coagulase‐negative staph, *Candida*, and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*. Infection is associated with a significantly increased mortality, especially so in the case of fungal endocarditis, which occurs in about 20% of patients. If this develops, antifungal therapy along with either device removal and replacement or urgent transplantation may lead to a successful result. Generally, however, infections are controllable and do not influence the results of transplantation.
- **3. Neurologic complications** are noted in 10–20% of patients and are more commonly ischemic than hemorrhagic in nature, although the latter is associated with higher mortality.233 Ischemic strokes are related to device/graft thrombosis, whereas hemorrhagic strokes are related to anticoagulation, acquired von Willebrand syndrome, endocarditis, hypertension, and hemorrhagic conversion of ischemic cerebral infarcts. The ENDURANCE trial found that the stroke rate was 2.5 times higher with the HeartWare device compared with the HM II (30% vs. 12%),220 but was comparable with both devices at around 12–15% at two years with good blood pressure control.234 The MOMENTUM trial showed a 50% reduction in stroke with the HM 3 compared with the HM II devices (19% vs 10%).221 Patients with mechanical aortic valves should have them covered with tissue or sewn shut to prevent thromboembolism.
- **4. Malignant ventricular arrhythmias** may develop as a result of myocardial ischemia, infarction, or the use of catecholamines.235 BiVADs function during VF, as can LVADs as long as the PVR is not high. If LVAD flow cannot be maintained, the patient may require placement of an RVAD. VF may foster thrombus formation in the ventricles and should be treated aggressively. Early cardioversion should also be considered to prevent RV injury from prolonged VF. Chest compressions can be used for percutaneous and continuous flow devices, but are usually not necessary nor recommended.188
- **5. Renal failure** is usually caused by prolonged episodes of hypotension or low cardiac output prior to insertion of a VAD. Serum creatinine generally returns to the patient's baseline after VAD implantation, except when there is evidence of other organ system failure (especially hepatic) or infection. Early aggressive treatment with renal replacement therapy (usually continuous veno‐venous hemofiltration)

- should be considered. The mortality rate for patients with persistent renal failure on VAD support is very high.
- **6. Respiratory failure** is usually attributable to a prolonged duration of CPB, sepsis, and use of multiple blood products.
- **7. Vasodilatory shock** due to inappropriately low levels of vasopressin is not uncommon in patients requiring placement of VADs. In fact, vasopressin hypersensitivity may be noted. Use of arginine vasopressin in doses up to 0.1 units/min is effective in increasing the mean arterial pressure in these patients.187
- **8. Worsening heart failure** may result from:
  - **a. De novo aortic regurgitation**, which has been noted in 30% of patients with HM II devices after two years. This may be the result of excessive unloading and lack of valve opening, which may lead to cusp remodeling and commissural fusion. Maintaining some degree of pulsatility may minimize this problem.236
  - **b.** The development of **RV failure**, which occurs in 15–25% of patients early after LVAD implantation and may require an RVAD in 4%.194,201 This is usually caused by excessive LV unloading which increases RV preload and unmasks preexisting RV dysfunction. Signs of RV dysfunction by catheterization (high PVR, high PCW/CVP) or echocardiography, ventilator dependence, and renal dysfunction are predictors of the need for RVAD support (as noted in section F.1.b, page 562). The risk of right heart failure was greater with the HeartWare than the HM II device in the ENDURANCE trial.220
  - **c. Pump thrombosis** related to turbulent flow, device geometry, or underanticoagulation. This has become less common with newer device designs, with only a 1% incidence in the HM 3 studies.221
- **9.** Patients receiving LVADs become immunologically sensitized and have a reduced rate of transplantation due to crossmatch issues. Furthermore, they have a higher risk of rejection. However, after transplantation, survival appears to be similar to that of nonbridged recipients who are not sensitized. Immunomodulatory treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins and cyclophosphamide may be beneficial in offsetting the problems associated with sensitization.237

#### **VI. Systemic Hypertension**

#### **A. General comments**

- **1.** Systemic hypertension is fairly common after open‐heart surgery, even in patients with no prior history of hypertension. In the immediate postoperative period, it usually results from vasoconstriction due to systemic hypothermia, enhanced sympathetic tone, and altered baroreceptor sensitivity. Postoperative hypertension is more common in patients with chronic hypertension, diabetes, vascular disease, and chronic kidney disease.
- **2.** Hypertension more commonly results from elevated SVR than from hyperdynamic myocardial performance. Therefore, it is imperative that cardiac hemodynamics be assessed before therapeutic interventions are initiated. **One should never assume that hypertension is the result of hyperdynamic cardiac performance.** Withdrawal of inotropic support when hypertension is caused by intense

- vasoconstriction may precipitate rapid hemodynamic deterioration if the cardiac output is marginal.
- **3.** Treatment is indicated to maintain the systolic blood pressure <130 mm Hg or the MAP <90 mm Hg. Aggressive treatment is warranted to minimize the potential adverse effects of hypertension. These include an increase in afterload, which increases systolic wall stress and can precipitate myocardial ischemia and impair ventricular function, and the potential for mediastinal bleeding, suture‐ line disruption, aortic dissection, and stroke.

#### **B. Etiology**

- **1.** The hormonal milieu of CPB which raises levels of norepinephrine and vasopressin and alters the renin‐angiotensin system, increasing autonomic tone and inducing a hyperadrenergic state
- **2.** Vasoconstriction from hypothermia, vasopressors, or a low cardiac output state
- **3.** Fever, anxiety, pain, agitation, and awakening when sedatives wear off
- **4.** Abnormal ABGs (hypoxia, hypercarbia, acidosis)
- **5.** Pharyngeal manipulation (readjusting an endotracheal tube, placing a nasogastric tube or echo probe)
- **6.** A hyperdynamic LV, especially in patients with LVH
- **7.** Altered baroreceptor function following combined CABG‐carotid endarterectomy
- **8.** Severe acute hypoglycemia

#### **C. Assessment**

- **1.** Careful patient examination, especially for breath sounds and peripheral perfusion
- **2.** Assessment of cardiac hemodynamics
- **3.** Measurement of ABGs, serum potassium, HCT
- **4.** Review of a chest x‐ray and 12‐lead ECG
- **5.** Note: don't forget to check the chest drainage unit for the amount of mediastinal bleeding!
- **D. Treatment.** Systolic pressure should be maintained between 100 and 130 mm Hg (MAP around 80 mm Hg). The objective is to reduce the SVR sufficiently enough to lower myocardial oxygen demand without compromising coronary perfusion pressure. A secondary benefit is frequently an improvement in myocardial function. Ideally, an antihypertensive agent should prevent myocardial ischemia without adversely affecting heart rate, AV conduction, or myocardial contractility. When used in the early postoperative period, it should have rapid onset and offset of action in the event of changes in hemodynamics.
  - **1.** Ensure satisfactory oxygenation and ventilation.
  - **2.** Use vasodilator medications if the cardiac output is satisfactory (see section VII, starting on page 576).
  - **3.** Provide inotropic support along with vasodilators if the cardiac output is marginal (CI <2.0 L/min/m2 ).
  - **4.** Sedate with propofol 25–75 μg/kg/min, dexmedetomidine 0.5–1.5 μg/kg/h, midazolam 2.5–5.0 mg IV, or morphine 2.5–5.0 mg IV. Sedation is usually an

- appropriate first step in the fully ventilated patient when extubation is not imminently planned. However, antihypertensive drugs rather than sedatives are preferable to allow for early extubation.
- **5.** Control shivering with meperidine 25–50 mg IV, dexmedetomidine 0.75–1.0 μg/kg/h, or pharmacologic paralysis (always with sedation).238

#### **VII. Vasodilators and Antihypertensive Medications in the ICU**

#### **A. General comments**

**1.** A variety of medications can be used to control systemic hypertension (Table 11.8). Their hemodynamic effects depend on the patient's intravascular volume and myocardial function and the site at which they exert their antihypertensive action. Vasodilators may reduce blood pressure by increasing venous capacitance (which reduces preload) or decreasing arterial resistance (which reduces afterload and usually preload as well). Other antihypertensive medications reduce blood pressure by inhibiting central adrenergic discharge or exerting a

negative inotropic effect, a property also shared by several of the vasodilators. Thus, a careful cardiac assessment is required to ensure that the appropriate medication is selected.

- **2.** Antihypertensive medications are most commonly used during the early phase of postoperative recovery when the patient is hypothermic, vasoconstricted, and hypertensive. They are weaned off as the patient vasodilates in order to maintain a systolic blood pressure in the 100 to 130 mm Hg range. Vasodilators may also be used alone or in conjunction with inotropic medications to improve myocardial function by lowering SVR.
- **3.** The most commonly used intravenous antihypertensives in the ICU are sodium nitroprusside and clevidipine, which are both short‐acting medications. Other IV medications, such as NTG, CCBs (nicardipine), β‐blockers (intermittent IV boluses of metoprolol or continuous infusions of esmolol or labetalol), hydralazine, or fenoldopam can also be considered in selected situations.
- **4.** Most patients without chronic hypertension will exhibit only transient hypertension after surgery and usually do not require antihypertensive therapy after 24 hours. For those with a history of hypertension, oral medications must be initiated before transfer from the ICU. The appropriate choice depends on the patient's hemodynamic status and renal function (see pages 585–586).

#### **B. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP)**

#### **1. Hemodynamic effects**

- **a.** SNP primarily relaxes arterial smooth muscle and reduces SVR and PVR. It has a lesser effect on venous capacitance that will also reduce preload. The overall effect is a reduction in systemic blood pressure and filling pressures, often resulting in an improvement in LV function. Maintenance or improvement in cardiac output usually requires a modest volume infusion to restore filling pressures to an optimal level. The approach is: "optimize preload → reduce afterload → restore preload". The development of a reflex tachycardia during SNP infusion usually reflects hypovolemia.
- **b.** SNP is a very dangerous drug which always requires close monitoring with an indwelling arterial cannula. It has a very rapid onset of action (within seconds) and can lower the blood pressure precipitously. Fortunately, its effects dissipate within 1–2 minutes.

#### **2. Indications**

- **a. To control systemic hypertension** caused by an increase in SVR. SNP is an excellent drug to use if cardiac function is marginal, filling pressures are elevated, and SVR is high.
- **b. To improve myocardial function** when the SVR is elevated, usually when systemic hypertension is present. The best results are often obtained with concomitant inotropic support.
- **3.** The usual **starting dose** is 0.1 μg/kg/min with a mix of 50 mg/250 mL. The bottle must be wrapped in aluminum foil to prevent metabolic breakdown from light. The dose is gradually increased to a maximum of 8 μg/kg/min.

#### **4. Adverse effects**

- **a.** Potentiation of myocardial ischemia by:
  - **i.** A reduction in diastolic perfusion pressure. If filling pressures do not decrease when systemic perfusion pressure falls, the diastolic transmyocardial gradient for coronary blood flow will be reduced, potentially producing myocardial ischemia.
  - **ii.** Producing a coronary steal syndrome by dilating resistance vessels in the coronary circulation and shunting of blood away from ischemic zones.
  - **iii.** Causing a reflex tachycardia.
- **b.** Reflex increase in contractility and dp/dt. In the patient with an aortic dissection, SNP should generally not be given prior to administering a β‐blocker unless the patient is bradycardic.
- **c.** Inhibition of hypoxic vasoconstriction, which produces V/Q mismatch and hypoxia.
- **d.** Tachyphylaxis to its vasodilating effects
- **e. Cyanide toxicity.** Nitroprusside is metabolized to cyanide, which is then converted to thiocyanate in the liver. Cyanide toxicity, manifested by metabolic acidosis and an elevated mixed venous PO2 , may occur when large doses (>8 μg/kg/min) are given for several days (cumulative dose >1 mg/kg over 12–24 hours) or if hepatic dysfunction is present. Hemolysis and free Hb release during CPB may accelerate the release of free cyanide from SNP.239 Moderate cyanide toxicity is treated by converting the cyanide to thiocyanate for its excretion by the kidneys:
  - **i.** Sodium bicarbonate for metabolic acidosis in doses of 1 mEq/kg
  - **ii.** Sodium thiosulfate 150 mg/kg IV (approximately 12.5 g in a 50 mL D5W solution given over 10 minutes)
- **f. Thiocyanate toxicity** (level >5 mg/dL) may develop from chronic use of SNP especially when there is impaired renal excretion of this metabolite. It is manifested by dyspnea, vomiting, and mental status changes with dizziness, headache, and loss of consciousness. **Treatment** of both severe cyanide and thiocyanate toxicity involves use of nitrite preparations to induce methemoglobin formation. The methemoglobin combines with cyanide to form cyanmethemoglobin, which is nontoxic.
  - **i.** Amyl nitrite inhalation of 1 ampule over 15 seconds
  - **ii.** Sodium nitrite 5 mg/kg IV slow push. This is usually given at a rate of 2.5 mL/min of a 3% solution to a total of 10–15 mL. One‐half of this dose can be used subsequently if toxicity recurs.
  - **iii.** Sodium thiosulfate in the dose noted just above can then be administered to convert the cyanide, which is gradually dissociated from cyanmethemoglobin, into thiocyanate for excretion.

#### **C. Nitroglycerin (NTG)**

#### **1. Hemodynamic effects**

**a.** NTG is primarily a venodilator that lowers blood pressure by reducing preload, filling pressures, stroke volume, and cardiac output. If filling pressures are satisfactory, NTG will maintain aortic diastolic perfusion pressure, although at high doses some arterial vasodilation does occur. In the presence of hypovolemia or a marginal cardiac output, NTG should be avoided, because it will lower cardiac output further and produce a reflex tachycardia.

- b. NTG dilates coronary conductance vessels and improves blood flow to ischemic zones.<sup>240</sup>
- c. IV NTG is rapid-acting with an onset of action of 2–5 minutes and a duration of action of 10–20 minutes.

#### 2. Indications

- **a. Hypertension** in association with myocardial ischemia or high filling pressures
- **b.** ECG changes of **myocardial ischemia**. NTG is useful prior to surgery in conjunction with phenylephrine which is used to maintain coronary perfusion pressures.
- c. Coronary spasm
- d. Pulmonary hypertension, to reduce RV afterload and improve RV function
- 3. Starting dose is 0.1 μg/kg/min with a mix of 50 mg/250 mL. The dose can be titrated up to 5 μg/kg/min. The dose used prophylactically to prevent radial artery spasm is only 5–10 μg/min. NTG must be administered through non-polyvinyl chloride tubing, which absorbs up to 80% of the NTG.
- 4. Adverse effects. NTG is metabolized by the liver to nitrites, which oxidize Hb to methemoglobin. Methemoglobinemia and impaired oxygen transport can occur if the patient receives extremely high doses of IV NTG (over 10  $\mu$ g/kg/min) for several days or has renal or hepatic dysfunction. The diagnosis is suggested by the presence of chocolate-brown blood and a lower oxygen saturation measured by oximetry than one would expect from the PaO<sub>2</sub>. It can be confirmed by an elevated methemoglobin level (>1% of total Hb). Symptoms (cyanosis, progressive weakness, and acidosis) are usually not noted until the methemoglobin level exceeds 15–20%. The treatment is IV methylene blue 1 mg/kg of a 1% solution.  $^{241}$

#### D. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs)

#### 1. Hemodynamic and electrophysiologic effects

- **a.** CCBs control hypertension by relaxing vascular smooth muscle and producing peripheral vasodilation. The various CCBs have differing effects on cardiovascular hemodynamics and electrophysiology (Table 11.9). Use of these medications during the perioperative period has been shown to reduce the incidence of MI, ischemia, and supraventricular arrhythmias, and may also improve survival.<sup>242</sup>
- **b.** Other effects may include coronary vasodilation, negative inotropy, a reduction in sinoatrial (SA) nodal automaticity (slowing the sinus mechanism), and slowing of AV nodal conduction (decreasing the ventricular rate response to atrial tachyarrhythmias).

#### 2. Indications

**a.** Use as a first-line drug for control of **postoperative hypertension**. IV clevidipine and nicardipine lack a negative inotropic effect and can be used

0, no effect; ↑ increased; ↓ decreased. The relative effect is indicated by the number of arrows.

independent of the cardiac output; in contrast, other CCBs, which might be used for other indications (vasospasm or rate control in AF), have negative inotropic properties.

- **b.** Treatment of **coronary vasospasm**
- **c.** Prevention of **radial artery spasm**
- **d. Slowing the ventricular response** to AF/flutter (diltiazem)
- **3. Clevidipine** is a very short‐acting CCB that relaxes arterial vascular smooth muscle without producing myocardial depression. It does not reduce preload but may improve LV function by reducing afterload. It reduces the blood pressure within 2–4 minutes and has a half‐life of one minute with a duration of action of 5–15 minutes. It is metabolized by blood and tissue esterases and therefore is safe to use in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction.243,244
  - **a. Indications.** An excellent first‐line drug for control of early postoperative hypertension because it has a rapid onset of action with achievement of a target blood pressure usually within six minutes. It minimizes blood pressure fluctuations and has rapid offset of action in the event of hemodynamic problems. It is commonly used during TAVR procedures due to the rapid changes in hemodynamics that occur around the time of valve deployment. It is an excellent drug to supplement use of β‐blockers in the initial medical management of aortic dissections.245,246
  - **b. Dosage.** It is given in an initial dose of 1–2 mg/h; if the blood pressure remains elevated, the dose can be doubled every 90 seconds; as the blood pressure approaches the target range, the dose should be adjusted in smaller increments every 5–10 minutes. The usual maintenance dose is 4–6 mg/h, but doses up to 21 mg/h can be given. It comes premixed with a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL in 50 mL or 100 mL bottles.
  - **c.** Advantages. The ECLIPSE trial showed that clevidipine was more effective than SNP or NTG in maintaining the blood pressure within a target range,

and when the blood pressure range was narrowed, it was also more effective than nicardipine in minimizing blood pressure excursions.247

**4. Nicardipine** selectively relaxes arterial smooth muscle, reducing the SVR. It lacks a negative inotropic effect, produces a minimal increase in heart rate, and has no effect on AV conduction. It has a rapid onset of action, but a half‐life of about 45 minutes and a duration of action of 4–6 hours.

#### **a. Indications**

- **i.** An excellent first‐line drug for control of hypertension in the hemodynamically stable patient because of a rapid onset of action, selective arterial vasodilation, and minimal cardiac effects. The only concern is its long duration of action in the event of hemodynamic changes.
- **ii.** Radial artery spasm prophylaxis in a dose of 0.25 μg/kg/min.248 Prophylaxis may be optimized by combining nicardipine with IV NTG.249 However, one study of preexisting vasospasm in coronary artery conduits found that nicardipine added to NTG caused no more vasodilation than NTG alone.250
- **b. Dosage.** It is given with an initial dose of 5 mg/h using a mix of 50 mg/250 mL; the rate is then increased by 2.5 mg/h every 5–15 minutes to a maximum dose of 15 mg/h.
- **c.** Advantages over SNP include more stable blood pressure control and avoidance of a reduction in preload, a reflex tachycardia, and coronary steal. It is a potent coronary vasodilator that can improve distribution of blood to ischemic zones. It has been shown to decrease the extent and duration of postoperative ischemia more than NTG.251
- **d.** Disadvantages include having a long offset of action that can be problematic in a hemodynamically unstable patient, and an increase in V/Q mismatch that can produce hypoxemia.
- **5. Diltiazem** reduces systemic blood pressure by lowering the SVR, but it has significant cardiac effects that limit its use as an antihypertensive agent. It depresses systolic function by a negative inotropic effect, slows the heart rate, and suppresses AV conduction. A reduction in blood pressure is a benefit when used for other indications, but it can be deleterious when the blood pressure is not elevated in those situations.

#### **a. Indications**

- **i. Slowing the ventricular response** to AF. Diltiazem slows AV conduction and can produce heart block; therefore, pacemaker backup should be available when it is administered intravenously. **Note:** the patient's blood pressure and cardiac output are often marginal when AF develops and there is often some reluctance to use diltiazem for rate control. However, a reduction in ventricular response will usually improve stroke volume and blood pressure. If the blood pressure is marginal, a pure α‐agent may be given along with diltiazem. If the blood pressure is unacceptably low, then cardioversion should be performed.
- **ii.** Prevention of **radial artery spasm**
- **iii.** Treatment of **coronary artery spasm** (diltiazem is a potent coronary vasodilator)

- **iv. Systemic hypertension** when there is another indication for its use (such as radial artery prophylaxis or slowing the ventricular response to AF).
- **b. Dosage.** An IV bolus of 0.25 mg/kg IV is given over two minutes, which may be followed by a repeat bolus of 0.35 mg/kg 15 minutes later. A continuous infusion is then started at a rate of 5–15 mg/h with a 100 mg/100 mL mix.
- **6. Verapamil** reduces systemic blood pressure by lowering the SVR, but it also has significant cardiac effects that depress contractility, slow the heart rate, and depress AV conduction. In the early postoperative period, indications for its use are similar to those for diltiazem, which is preferentially used. The IV dosage is a 0.1 mg/kg IV bolus followed by a 2–5 μg/kg/min continuous infusion of a 120 mg/250 mL mix.
- **7. Nifedipine** is a potent arterial vasodilator that lowers blood pressure by reducing SVR, and may also increase cardiac output because of a baroreceptor‐ mediated reflex tachycardia and a slight reflex increase in cardiac inotropy and AV conduction. It is also a potent coronary vasodilator and is beneficial in treating coronary spasm. Although it has been shown to be an effective antihypertensive drug, it has a long duration of action (6–8 hours) and is rarely used in the ICU.
- **8. Amlodipine** is an oral CCB that reduces SVR and blood pressure and may improve cardiac output due to a decrease in afterload. It has no negative inotropic effects and no effect on the SA node or AV nodal conduction. It produces a gradual decrease in blood pressure that persists for 24 hours after an oral dose. Thus, it is indicated for the long‐term control of blood pressure. Because it is an effective antispasmodic agent, it is frequently used for the prevention of radial artery spasm in a 5 mg daily dose. It is useful in controlling hypertenson when given in addition to a β‐blocker or when a β‐blocker is contraindicated due to bradycardia.

#### **E. β‐blockers**

#### **1. Hemodynamic effects**

- **a.** In contrast to the vasodilating drugs, β‐blockers reduce blood pressure primarily by their negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. They reduce contractility, lowering the stroke volume and cardiac output, and also slow the heart rate by depressing the SA node. Their antihypertensive activity may also be attributable to a decrease in central sympathetic outflow and suppression of renin activity.
- **b.** β‐blockers slow AV conduction and can precipitate heart block. Pacemaker backup should be available when IV β‐blockers are given. This electrophysiologic effect is beneficial in reducing the ventricular rate response to atrial tachyarrhythmias.

#### **2. Indications**

**a.** β‐blockers can be used to control postoperative systolic hypertension associated with a satisfactory cardiac output. They are especially beneficial in the hyperdynamic, tachycardic heart that is often noted in patients with normal LV function and/or LVH. **Note:** intravenous β‐blockers should be avoided in hypertensive patients with compromised cardiac output.

- **b.** They are routinely used for prophylaxis (usually oral metoprolol or carvedilol) or treatment (usually IV metoprolol) of AF and will provide the additional benefit (or disadvantage) of reducing blood pressure.
- **c.** They are the treatment of choice for both hypertension and heart rate control during the initial evaluation and treatment of patients with suspected acute aortic dissection.
- **3. Esmolol** is a cardioselective, ultrafast, short‐acting β‐blocker with an onset of action of two minutes, reaching a steady‐state level in five minutes, with reversal of effect in 10–20 minutes. Because of its very short duration of action, esmolol is the β‐blocker of choice in the ICU for transient **hypertension control** in high cardiac output states, and is also beneficial in the initial management of **acute aortic dissection**.
  - **a.** Esmolol is contraindicated in the hypertensive patient with a low cardiac output. Frequently, blood pressure and cardiac output are maintained by fast heart rates at low stroke volumes. Use of esmolol in this circumstance will often reduce blood pressure and cardiac output by a negative inotropic effect with little reduction in heart rate. Even in patients with an excellent cardiac output, the reduction in blood pressure is generally more pronounced than the decrease in heart rate.
  - **b.** Esmolol can be used safely in the patient with a history of bronchospasm because of its cardioselectivity.
  - **c. Dosage.** Because patients tend to be very sensitive to esmolol in the immediate postoperative period, an initial dose of 0.25 mg/kg or less can be given to determine its effect on heart rate and blood pressure. If an adequate antihypertensive effect is not achieved, a repeat bolus dose of up to 0.5 mg/kg can be given and a maintenance infusion of 50–100 μg/kg/min started. Additional bolus doses can be given with an increase in the infusion rate by 50 μg/kg/min to a maximum infusion rate of 200 μg/kg/min of a 2.5 g/250 mL mix.
- **4. Labetalol** has both α‐ and β‐blocking properties as well as a direct vasodilatory effect. The ratio of β:α effects is 3:1 for the oral form and 7:1 for the intravenous form. In the postoperative cardiac surgical patient, IV labetalol reduces blood pressure primarily by its negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. The α‐ blocking effect prevents reflex vasoconstriction.252
  - **a.** The onset of action for IV labetalol is rapid with a maximum blood pressure response in five minutes for a bolus injection and in 10–15 minutes for a continuous infusion. Since the approximate duration of action is six hours, labetalol is useful when a **longer‐acting antihypertensive drug** is desired. It is a very useful medication for the patient with an **aortic dissection**, both pre‐ and postoperatively.
  - **b. Dosage.** Labetalol is given as a 0.25 mg/kg bolus over two minutes with subsequent doses of 0.5 mg/kg every 15 minutes until effect is achieved (to a total dose of 300 mg). Alternatively, a continuous IV infusion can be given at a rate of 1–4 mg/min, mixing 40 mL of the 5 mg/mL solution in 160 mL (200 mg/200 mL).

**5. Metoprolol** is a cardioselective β‐blocker that is given routinely in oral form for AF prophylaxis (starting at 12.5–25 mg bid). It can be supplemented by 2.5–5 mg doses IV every five minutes for three doses for a rapid ventricular response to AF. With IV usage, the onset of action is 2–3 minutes with a peak effect in 20 minutes and a duration of action of up to five hours. Although effective in reducing the blood pressure, which is often not desirable when being given for rapid AF, IV metoprolol is usually not selected for hypertension management in the ICU unless the patient is tachycardic. However, it is quite beneficial in reducing systolic hypertension postoperatively in increasing oral doses, as long as the heart rate remains above 60 bpm and the patient has adequate cardiac function.

#### **F. Hydralazine**

- **1.** Hydralazine is a direct arteriolar vasodilator that decreases SVR and systemic blood pressure. The reduction in afterload may improve myocardial function, but it is usually accompanied by a compensatory tachycardia.
- **2. Indication.** Hydralazine is most commonly used as a prn drug when adequate blood pressure control has not been achieved as the patient is being converted from IV to oral antihypertensive medications. Often patients are started back on lower doses of their preoperative medications yet still have persistent hypertension for a few days that subsequently abates. Use of prn hydralazine allows the clinician to avoid being too aggressive with the reinstitution of higher‐dose or multiple medications that might otherwise precipitate hypotension when the transient hyperadrenergic state improves.
- **3. Dosage.** The usual dose is 10 mg IV q15 min until effect and them q6h prn. Less commonly it is given in a dose of 20–40 mg IM. The onset of action after IV injection is about 5–10 minutes with a peak effect at 20 minutes and a duration of action of 3–4 hours.

#### **G. Fenoldopam mesylate**

- **1.** Fenoldopam is a dopamine (DA1 ) receptor agonist that is a rapid‐acting peripheral and renal vasodilator with an onset of action of five minutes and a duration of action of less than 30 minutes. Its antihypertensive effect is accompanied by a reflex tachycardia and an increase in stroke volume, which both increase the cardiac output.253 It also lowers PVR, with potential benefits in patients with preexisting RV dysfunction. A beneficial effect on renal function is related to dilatation of renal afferent arterioles, resulting in an increase in renal blood flow. It also produces hypokalemia, either through a direct drug effect or enhanced K+ –Na+ exchange.
- **2. Indication.** This drug is rarely used for postoperative hypertension, but, if used for renoprotection during surgery, the dose could be increased to control severe hypertension when rapid onset of effect is necessary.
- **3. Dosage.** A continuous infusion is given starting at 0.05–0.1 μg/kg/min using a 10 mg/250 mL mix. The dose may be increased in 0.05–0.1 μg/kg/min increments every 15 minutes until effect is achieved to a maximum rate of 0.8 μg/kg/ min. The dose used to provide a renoprotective effect (0.1 μg/kg/min) generally does not produce systemic hypotension.

#### **H. Selection of the appropriate antihypertensive medication in the postoperative cardiac surgical patient**

- **1.** When filling pressures are normal or slightly elevated and the cardiac output is adequate or marginal, a selective arterial vasodilator with minimal cardiac effects is the best selection.
  - **a. Clevidipine** is a very short‐acting arterial vasodilator that is able to achieve a target blood pressure fairly rapidly and has a rapid offset of action in the event of hemodynamic compromise. It is preferentially used during and following TAVR procedures and may be added to propofol at the conclusion of cardiac surgery procedures if the patient remains hypertensive.
  - **b. Nitroprusside** is both an arterial and a venous dilator, so it will reduce elevated filling pressures and improve cardiac output while lowering the blood pressure. In patients with low filling pressures, volume infusion may be necessary to prevent a precipitous drop in blood pressure. Because SNP is so powerful, caution is necessary in initiating the infusion to avoid excessive blood pressure reduction, and thus it tends to take longer than clevidipine to achieve the target blood pressure. Extreme care with its administration is necessary during patient transfer to the ICU.
  - **c.** It is best to avoid longer‐acting drugs, such as nicardipine, immediately after surgery because hypertension is often transient and hypotension might ensue before its effects dissipate.
  - **d.** With any of these medications, use of additional inotropic support must be considered if the cardiac output is marginal or low and does not improve with optimization of preload and a reduction in afterload.
- **2.** When filling pressures are high and the cardiac output is satisfactory, a venodilator, such as **IV nitroglycerin**, may be beneficial. This will reduce venous return, filling pressures, stroke volume, cardiac output, and blood pressure. It may be beneficial if there is evidence of myocardial ischemia. However, IV NTG is best avoided when hypovolemia or a marginal cardiac output is present.
- **3.** When the heart is hyperdynamic with adequate filling pressures, a high cardiac output, and frequently a tachycardia, a β‐blocker with negative inotropic and chronotropic properties, such as **esmolol**, should be selected. Any of the CCBs, including those with negative chronotropic properties, such as **diltiazem**, can also be selected in that they may improve myocardial oxygen metabolism, especially when there is evidence of ischemia. Tachycardia at the conclusion of surgery is often worrisome: it may be related to catecholamine infusions or hypovolemia, and thus easily remedied; however, it may be a sign of myocardial injury or ischemia, and the cause should be identified and corrected if possible. β‐blockers must be avoided in the tachycardic patient with compromised RV or LV function.
- **4.** Once the patient is able to tolerate oral medications, the IV medications should be weaned while monitoring the blood pressure response to oral medications. It is appropriate to restart the medications the patient was taking before surgery, but other medications should be considered under certain circumstances.
  - **a.** β‐blockers (**metoprolol** 12.5–75 mg PO bid) are initiated in virtually all patients to reduce the incidence of AF, are effective in treating a sinus

- tachycardia, and may also control the blood pressure. They can be used effectively if the patient is not bradycardic. In patients with impaired LV function, but in the absence of a low cardiac output syndrome or pressor dependence, **carvedilol**, which is an α‐ and β‐blocker, can be started at a dose of 3.125 mg twice daily and increased up to 25 mg twice daily as tolerated.
- **b.** The next choice is usually an **ACE inhibitor**, such as lisinopril 5–10 mg PO qd. This should be considered for all patients with poor ventricular function (EF <40%) and is not contraindicated in the presence of chronic kidney disease.254 However, in the early postoperative period, it must be used cautiously in patients with acute kidney injury in whom a higher blood pressure may improve renal perfusion. As an alternative, or if the patient cannot tolerate an ACE inhibitor (usually because of a cough), an **ARB** can be chosen, such as losartan 25–50 mg daily or valsartan 80 mg daily.
- **c.** The third choice is usually a **calcium channel blocker (CCB)**, such as amlodipine (Norvasc), which has no effects on cardiac inotropy or heart rate. Diltiazem may be useful when primarily used for heart rate control in AF or for spasm prophylaxis in patients receiving radial artery grafts.
- **d.** Long‐acting **nitrates** are alternative coronary vasodilators that can be used in patients receiving radial artery grafts and may also provide an antihypertensive benefit.

#### **VIII. Perioperative Myocardial Infarction**

Despite advances in myocardial protection, use of off‐pump procedures, and refinements in surgical technique, a small percentage of patients will sustain a perioperative myocardial infarction (PMI). Virtually all patients undergoing on‐pump surgery with cardioplegic arrest will have an elevation in cardiac biomarkers consistent with periprocedural myocardial injury, so the threshold for defining a PMI is somewhat arbitrary. The relevance lies in whether the degree of myocardial necrosis compromises the patient's outcome. In the short‐term, a PMI may lead to a low cardiac output state, HF, or malignant arrhythmias; in the long‐term, it may compromise the patient's survival.255,256

#### **A. Predisposing factors**

- **1.** Left main or diffuse three‐vessel disease
- **2.** Preoperative ischemia or infarction. This includes ST‐elevation infarctions (STEMIs), other acute coronary syndromes, or evidence of ongoing ischemia, often following a failed PCI.
- **3.** Poor LV systolic and diastolic function (low EF, HF, LVEDP >15 mm Hg, LVH)
- **4.** Reoperations, which predispose to atheroembolism of debris or to graft thrombosis
- **5.** Poor surgical targets; requirement for a coronary endarterectomy
- **6.** Uncontrolled diabetes

#### **B. Mechanisms**

**1.** Prolonged ischemia during anesthetic induction or before the establishment of coronary reperfusion. This is usually caused by tachycardia, hypertension,

- hypotension, or ventricular distention, but may occasionally result from damage to grafts during reoperation or embolization down a stenotic vein graft.
- **2.** Prolonged aortic cross‐clamp time/CPB time
- **3.** Inadequate myocardial protection or ischemia/reperfusion injury following cardioplegic arrest
- **4.** Incomplete revascularization
- **5.** Acute graft flow problems from anastomotic stenosis, graft spasm, or thrombosis; poor graft quality, small ITA
- **6.** Native coronary vasospasm, plaque rupture, thrombosis
- **7.** Coronary air or particulate embolization (usually from patent but atherosclerotic vein grafts during reoperations)
- **8.** Other problems causing impaired hemodynamics or oxygenation: tachyarrhythmias, shock, respiratory failure, severe anemia
- **C. Diagnosis.** A PMI can be difficult to diagnose since many groups do not routinely assess cardiac biomarkers after surgery because they are nearly always elevated. Management is dictated by hemodynamic performance, not biomarker elevation. Nonetheless, there is a spectrum of perioperative myocardial damage, and the definition of a **significant** PMI is based on the premise that enzyme levels beyond a certain threshold level are associated with more myocardial necrosis and adverse outcomes.
  - **1.** The Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction from 2018 considers a CABG‐related MI to be a type 5 MI.257 This is defined as:
    - **a.** cTn (troponin) >10 × the 99th percentile URL (the upper reference limit) within 48 hours of surgery with normal baseline values. If the preoperative cTn is elevated, the post‐procedure cTn must rise by >20% and must also be >10 times the 99th percentile URL. In addition, one of the following elements is required:
      - **i.** Development of new pathological Q waves
      - **ii.** Angiographic documentation of new graft occlusion or new native coronary artery occlusion
      - **iii.** Imaging evidence of loss of viable myocardium that is presumed to be new and in a pattern consistent with an ischemic etiology
    - **b.** In some cases, marked isolated elevation of cTn values may be noted within the initial 48 h postoperative period in the absence of ECG/angiographic or other imaging evidence of an MI. Levels of cTnT >7 × URL or cTnI >20 × URL are considered consistent with a prognostically significant cardiac procedural myocardial injury, especially when there was difficulty coming off pump, technical concerns during surgery, low cardiac output states, ECG changes, or recurrent ventricular arrhythmias. Such levels should prompt further evaluation to see whether a graft‐related failure is present and whether further revascularization, preferably by PCI, would be indicated.
  - **2.** Although low cardiac output states and regional wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram may be consistent with a PMI, in many cases they represent a

- period of reversible myocardial depression ("stunning") that can recover after several days of pharmacologic or mechanical support. However, the persistence of new regional wall motion abnormalities on serial evaluations is more consistent with the occurrence of a PMI.
- **3.** Significant ST elevation on a postoperative ECG suggests a problem with graft flow and an evolving infarction. Differentiation from acute pericarditis on ECG can be difficult, the latter being suggested not just by the ECG abnormalities but by the absence of hemodynamic or echocardiographic abnormalities (see Figures 8.2 and 8.3, pages 384 and 385). New Q waves on the ECG are noted in about 5% of patients after surgery, but in many cases they are not associated with significant enzyme elevation and therefore may be of little consequence. These "false positive" Q waves may be associated with areas of altered depolarization or unmasking of old infarcts.258 The persistence of ST segment depression, deep T wave inversions, ventricular tachyarrhythmias, or a new bundle branch block for over 48 hours suggests some degree of myocardial injury, especially if associated with new regional wall motion abnormalities. T wave inversions are commonly noted days to weeks after surgery when there has been no other evidence of a PMI.

#### **D. Presentations and treatment**

- **1. Intraoperative ischemia.** Identification of new regional wall motion abnormalities by TEE is a sensitive means of assessing intraoperative myocardial ischemia. These changes precede evidence of ischemia noted with Swan‐Ganz monitoring (elevation of PA pressures) or the ECG (ST segment elevation). Aggressive treatment to reduce myocardial oxygen demand and maintain perfusion pressure is essential to lower the risk of PMI. Placement of an IABP prior to going on bypass can often reduce the risk of PMI in patients with ongoing ischemia or poor LV function.259 In patients undergoing reoperative surgery, avoiding manipulation of patent but diseased grafts is essential to prevent atheroembolism.
- **2. Postcardiotomy low cardiac output syndrome with/without ECG evidence of ischemia.** Although enzyme elevation is more common with a longer duration of aortic clamping, fastidious attention to myocardial protection should offset the adverse effects of prolonged cross‐clamping. The occurrence of severe postcardiotomy ventricular dysfunction, whether caused by ischemia, "stunning", or an infarction, requires careful evaluation and treatment.
  - **a.** If myocardial dysfunction or ischemia is noted in the operating room at the conclusion of CPB, the adequacy of the operative procedure should be assessed. Supplemental grafts or graft revision may be necessary during bypass surgery, and other potential etiologies may have to be considered and addressed following valve surgery. An IABP or MCS may be indicated in addition to pharmacologic support.
  - **b.** If ECG changes are detected upon arrival in the ICU (especially ST elevations), IV NTG or CCBs (if spasm is suspected) should be given. Emergency coronary angiography with possible PCI or surgical graft revision should be strongly considered.260,261 An IABP is helpful in temporarily improving coronary perfusion and reducing the workload of the heart.

- **c.** Management of a hemodynamically significant MI involves supportive care until arrhythmias and hemodynamic instability resolve. Cardiac output should be optimized in standard fashion, but care must be taken to avoid excessive volume infusions and tachycardia that may increase myocardial oxygen demand and worsen the ischemic insult. Use of milrinone or placement of an IABP will minimize oxygen consumption. It is difficult to treat the sinus tachycardia that frequently accompanies a low cardiac output state because it usually represents a compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output. Sinus tachycardia is frequently a sign of an "injured heart" and can perpetuate myocardial ischemia and damage. It can only be treated once the cardiac output improves.
- **3. Good cardiac output but low SVR.** The patient sustaining a small PMI may have a normal cardiac output accompanied by systemic hypotension. This syndrome usually requires use of an α‐agent for several days to maintain an adequate systemic blood pressure until the SVR returns to normal.
- **4. Persistent ventricular ectopy** may reflect ischemia, infarction, or reperfusion of previously ischemic muscle. It may be treated short‐term with lidocaine or amiodarone. β‐blockers are generally used for their antiarrhythmic effect and are beneficial regardless of LV function, but they are contraindicated in low output states or with profound bradycardia. Nonsustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia occurring in patients with impaired ventricular function often requires electrophysiologic testing, use of amiodarone, and/or use of a LifeVest (ZOLL Medical Corporation) or placement of an ICD.
- **5.** Some patients will have an infarction diagnosed by electrocardiographic, enzymatic, or functional criteria but will have no clinical or hemodynamic sequelae. These patients do not require any special treatment, but should be maintained on β‐blockers.

#### **E. Prognosis**

- **1.** An uncomplicated PMI generally does not influence operative mortality or long‐term survival. Despite a return of ventricular function to baseline, the heart may fail to demonstrate functional improvement during exercise.
- **2.** However, significant enzyme elevation as well as the occurrence of a hemodynamically significant MI (i.e. one presenting as a low cardiac output syndrome or malignant arrhythmias) do increase operative mortality and decrease long‐ term survival.262–265
- **3.** The prognosis following a perioperative infarction is determined primarily by the adequacy of revascularization and the residual EF. One study reported that the prognosis for patients sustaining an MI with an EF >40% and with complete revascularization was comparable to patients not developing a perioperative infarction.266

#### **IX. Coronary Vasospasm**

**A.** Vasospasm has become increasingly recognized as a cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality following CABG. It can affect normal coronary arteries, bypassed vessels, saphenous vein grafts, or arterial grafts (ITA, radial, gastroepiploic artery).249,250,267,268

- **B. Etiology** may be related to mechanical or endothelial vein damage during harvesting, enhanced α‐adrenergic tone, use of α‐agents such as phenylephrine to support blood pressure, endothelial dysfunction from reduced nitric oxide production, hypothermia, hypomagnesemia, or CCB withdrawal.269,270 It has also been associated with the administration of 5‐HT3 antagonists, such as ondansetron (Zofran), which is commonly prescribed for postoperative nausea.271
- **C. Diagnosis** of vasospasm can be extremely difficult to confirm and requires further evaluation to differentiate it from other more common clinical conditions with similar manifestations. The usual presentation is ST elevation consistent with ischemia, often with a low cardiac output state, hypotension, ventricular arrhythmias, or heart block.

#### **D. Evaluation**

- **1.** An ECG will usually show localized, and occasionally diffuse, ST elevations, although these findings are more commonly associated with an anatomic compromise in graft flow, usually at an anastomosis. As noted, spasm may occur in native coronary arteries (unbypassed or beyond an anastomosis) as well as in arterial and rarely venous conduits. Spasm is most common in radial artery grafts, but is usually mitigated by the prophylactic use of perioperative vasodilators.
- **2.** Echocardiography will usually demonstrate an area of hypokinesis which corresponds to the ECG changes, but it is not diagnostic of spasm.
- **3.** Coronary angiography may be necessary to make the appropriate diagnosis if there is no response to IV therapy with coronary vasodilators. It will usually demonstrate sluggish flow through grafts, diffuse spasm, and poor flow into distal native vessels. Resolution of spasm with intracoronary NTG or a CCB (verapamil) confirms the diagnosis. Differentiation from technical problems at the anastomosis can be difficult to make due to poor flow. If there is little response to pharmacologic intervention, re‐exploration may be indicated.
- **E. Treatment** involves hemodynamic support and initiation of medications that can reverse the vasospasm. Improvement in ECG changes is consistent with spasm, but it does not eliminate the possibility of some compromise of graft flow from surgical issues.
  - **1.** Optimize oxygenation and correct acidosis.
  - **2.** Optimize hemodynamic parameters. If an inotrope is indicated, a PDE inhibitor (milrinone) is the best choice because it is a potent vasodilator of the ITA and perhaps of native vessels as well.
  - **3.** Correct hypomagnesemia (IV **magnesium sulfate** 1–2 g in 10 mL of D5W).
  - **4.** Although several vasodilators are effective in preventing or treating native coronary, arterial and vein graft spasm, the most effective approach may be the combination of IV nitroglycerin with a CCB.268
    - **a.** Start IV **nitroglycerin** at 0.5 μg/kg/min and raise as tolerated.
    - **b. Diltiazem** drip: 0.25 mg/kg IV bolus over two minutes, followed by a repeat bolus of 0.35 mg/kg 15 minutes later. A continuous infusion is then given at a rate of 5–15 mg/h using a 100 mg/100 mL mix.
    - **c.** IV nicardipine 5 mg/h with a mix of 50 mg/250 mL; the dose can be increased by 2.5 mg/h every 5–15 minutes to a maximum dose of 15 mg/h, if tolerated.

- **d.** IV verapamil drip: 0.1 mg/kg bolus, followed by a 2–5 μg/kg/min infusion of a 120 mg/250 mL mix (most likely to cause hypotension).
- **5.** If the patient does not improve and/or ECG changes persist, emergency cardiac catheterization is indicated to identify and possibly correct the problem. During catheterization, intracoronary NTG and verapamil are usually successful in reversing spasm.
- **6.** Once the patient has stabilized, an oral coronary vasodilator is recommended. These include isosorbide mononitrate sustained release (Imdur) 20 mg qd, nifedipine 30 mg q6h, diltiazem CD 180 mg qd, or amlodipine 5 mg qd.
- **7.** Statins may prove of benefit in reducing spasm.272
- **8.** Emergency ECMO has been utilized in patients with cardiogenic shock from diffuse spasm.273

#### **X. Cardiac Arrest**

- **A.** Cardiac arrest is a serious and dreaded complication of any cardiac operation that can occur unexpectedly at the conclusion of surgery, during transport from the operating room, in the ICU, or later during convalescence on the floor. The three leading causes of a postoperative cardiac arrest are ventricular fibrillation, cardiac tamponade, and mediastinal bleeding, with survival being least likely with VF since it is often caused by an MI or pump failure. The mortality rate for patients sustaining a cardiac arrest after cardiac surgery averages about 50%.274,275
  - **1.** For patients suffering a cardiac arrest in the ICU, protocols adapted for cardiac surgical patients, presented by the European Association for Cardio‐Thoracic Surgery in 2009, the European Resuscitation Council in 2015, and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons in 2017, should be followed.275–277 The two basic principles which differ from standard ACLS teachings are a one‐minute delay in initiating external compressions to establish pacing or perform defibrillation, and performance of a redo sternotomy within five minutes if the resuscitation is unsuccessful (Figure 11.15). A resternotomy addresses most contributory causes (especially bleeding or tamponade) and allows for the performance of internal cardiac massage, which is nearly twice as effective as external compressions in increasing the cardiac output and coronary perfusion pressure.278
  - **2.** In patients arresting outside of an ICU setting, basic and ACLS recommendations should be followed, with plans for an early resternotomy if resuscitation is unsuccessful and the patient is within 10 days of surgery. If the arrest is witnessed, the one‐minute rule of an initial defibrillation should be considered.
- **B.** Resuscitation from cardiac arrest is a team approach with seven key roles: airway and breathing, external cardiac massage, defibrillation/pacing, drug administration, a team leader to coordinate management, an ICU coordinator to coordinate peripheral activities, and individuals to perform an open sternotomy. In brief, the basic ABCD steps are the follows:
  - **1. AIRWAY & BREATHING:** manually ventilate the patient at 8–10/min
  - **2. CIRCULATION:** initiate external chest compressions (100–120/min) **only after** three serial attempts at defibrillation for ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) or attempted pacing for asystole in ICU patients within the first minute after arrest.

![](_page_78_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 11.15 •** A simplified algorithm for the management of a cardiac arrest in the ICU. Note that up to three defibrillations for VF or pacing for asystole should be attempted within the first minute prior to initiating external compressions in a patient with a witnessed arrest in the ICU.

- **3. DEFIBRILLATE** for pulseless VT/VF or **PACE** for asystole or bradycardia
- **4. DRUGS** (see Table 11.10)
- **C. Etiology/assessment/management.** While resuscitation is under way, an evaluation should be undertaken to determine the possible cause of the cardiac arrest (Table 11.11). The most common causes of non‐VF arrests in cardiac surgical patients are cardiac tamponade, marked hypovolemia from bleeding, asystole from pacing failure, and tension pneumothorax. All of these can be addressed with reopening of the sternotomy incision once adequate ventilation has been achieved.
  - **1.** Listen to the chest, check the ventilator function, ABGs, and recent acid–base and electrolyte status. If the patient is not intubated, secure an airway first, administer oxygen, and then intubate. Do **not** try to intubate before delivering oxygen by face mask because this may prolong the period of hypoxemia. This assessment may indicate whether the patient has:

- **2.** Examine the cardiac monitor and ECG. These may reveal:
  - **a.** Third‐degree heart block (may occur spontaneously or if AV pacing fails in a patient with complete heart block)
  - **b.** Acute ischemia (graft thrombosis, coronary spasm)
  - **c.** Ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT or VF)
- **3.** Check the chest tube drainage and review the chest x‐ray. These may indicate whether there is:
  - **a.** Acute impairment of venous return (tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, occasionally with sudden cessation of massive bleeding)
  - **b.** Acute hypovolemia (massive mediastinal bleeding)
- **4.** Assess whether inotropes, vasopressors, or vasodilators are being administered at the correct rate. Because there may have been inadvertent cessation of inotropic support or profound vasodilation from bolusing of a vasodilator, it is recommended that **all medication infusions should be stopped** to clarify matters until the patient is resuscitated.
- **D. Treatment.** Cardiac surgery patients are usually extensively monitored in the ICU, and ventilation can be provided immediately by Ambu bags present at the bedside. Many patients are still intubated and most arrests are "witnessed". Thus, immediate resuscitation using an ICU protocol should be used. On the floor, most patients are only monitored by telemetry and many arrests are not "witnessed". Immediate resuscitation using standard ACLS protocols should be used for those patients.
  - **1.** Disconnect the patient from the ventilator and **hand ventilate** with an Ambu bag with 100% oxygen at a rate of 8–10/min and listen for bilateral breath sounds. If not already intubated, intubate after establishing an adequate airway after a brief period of satisfactory manual ventilation. Perform endotracheal suctioning for a potential tube or airway obstruction. If the latter is present, it is best to remove the tube, hand ventilate, and have an experienced individual reintubate the patient. If breath sounds are not heard on one side and a tension pneumothorax is suspected, a large‐bore needle can be placed in the second intercostal space for immediate decompression and a chest tube may subsequently be placed. When the patient is reconnected to the ventilator, do not use PEEP.
  - **2.** In any patient sustaining a cardiac arrest after cardiac surgery, emergency **resternotomy for open‐chest resuscitation** should always be considered from the outset and performed within five minutes of the arrest if the resuscitation is unsuccessful (see below).
  - **3. Ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation** can be identified on a monitor and confirmed by lack of a pulse.
    - **a. ICU patients. Three attempts at defibrillation** with 200 joules (biphasic) or 360 joules (monophasic) should be performed, all **within one minute of arrest**. If the patient remains in VT/VF or has severe hypotension after one minute, **then external chest compressions** at a rate of 100–120/min should be commenced. Preparations should be made for an emergency resternotomy, which should then be performed within five minutes of the onset of the arrest. The rationale for delaying external massage is that it can cause disruption of the sternal closure, injury to bypass grafts, or damage to the ventricular myocardium from prosthetic valves. This potential damage can be minimized if

- compressions are **delayed for a very short period of time (one minute)** to prepare and use the defibrillator for VT/VF or attach the pacing wires to a pacemaker (or turn the pacemaker on if already attached) for asystole or bradycardia. After subsequent defibrillations, it is advisable to continue CPR briefly since the initial rhythm may be slow and may not generate an adequate perfusion pressure.
- **b. Floor patients or unwitnessed arrests. External compressions** should be started **immediately** because the onset of the arrest may not be known and it is less likely that defibrillation can be performed within one minute of the onset of arrest. External compressions are started and **defibrillation** should be done as soon as possible and then repeated every two minutes, if necessary. It is recommended that CPR be resumed immediately after each defibrillation, with assessment of the rhythm on the monitor and palpation for a pulse during CPR and for no more than 10 seconds with CPR stopped. If the patient is not monitored, CPR should be continued for two minutes before checking for a pulse. After two minutes of CPR, defibrillation should be attempted again. A postoperative cardiac floor should always be equipped with a "crash cart" and preparations started immediately for opening the sternotomy incision after five minutes.
- **c.** Initial medications are given after three unsuccessful shocks within the first minute in ICU patients or after two attempts for floor patients (Table 11.10). All drug infusions the patient was receiving prior to the arrest should be stopped. It is recommended in both the European and STS guidelines that neither vasopressin nor epinephrine should be given routinely except by those experienced with cardiac surgical management, because they may cause severe hypertension once cardiac activity resumes.
  - ∙ **Vasopressin** 40 units IV as a single dose provides comparable or superior efficacy to epinephrine in promoting return of spontaneous circulation.279
  - ∙ **Epinephrine** 1 mg IV push (10 mL of 1:10,000 solution) should be given if VT/VF persists or recurs after defibrillation. It may be repeated every 3–5 minutes. In a patient with a pending arrest, smaller doses are usually recommended (50–300 μg).
  - ∙ If the cardiac arrest occurs outside of the ICU setting and intravenous access is not immediately available, epinephrine, vasopressin, and lidocaine are effective when given down an endotracheal tube at 2–2.5 times the usual IV dose diluted in 10 mL of normal saline. Note that ACLS protocols recommend the intraosseous route as second choice, but this requires a special rigid needle from an access kit.
- **d.** Antiarrhythmic drugs may improve the success of defibrillation and should be used for persistent/recurrent VT/VF despite three shocks. Defibrillation should be repeated after each dose of medication.
  - ∙ **Amiodarone** should be given first in a bolus dose of 300 mg; a dose of 150 mg may be repeated every 3–5 minutes. It is then given as an infusion of 1 mg/ min for six hours, then 0.5 mg/min for 18 hours with conversion to oral dosing if necessary. The maximum dose is 2.2 g IV/24 h.
  - ∙ **Lidocaine** may be given for refractory VT/VF as a 1–1.5 mg/kg bolus followed by 0.5–0.75 mg/kg boluses twice every 5–10 minutes to a total dose of 3 mg/kg.

- ∙ **Magnesium sulfate** 1–2 g in 10 mL of D5W IV may be helpful for torsades de pointes, especially if hypomagnesemia is suspected.
- **4. Asystole or pulseless electrical activity (PEA)** (pacing spikes or QRS complex with no detectable pulse)
  - **a. Note that a patient being "paced" who develops suspected PEA may actually have underlying VF, which is not easily recognizable on a monitor.** The pacer may need to be turned off to identify this rhythm.
  - **b.** Initiate immediate epicardial pacing by connecting the patient's ventricular pacing wires to a pacing box, which should be available at the bedside or nearby. The default emergency setting of VOO can be used initially at a rate of 80–100/ min. However, most patients in the ICU have both atrial and ventricular pacing wires connected to the box, and DDD pacing should be initiated, which will also function if there is an adequate sinus mechanism and no atrial wires.
  - **c.** With a witnessed arrest, CPR may be delayed for one minute while the pacing wires are connected. If successful **pacing with a documented pulse** cannot be achieved **within one minute** of a witnessed arrest, **external compressions must be started.** Compressions should be started immediately in patients with an unwitnessed arrest, since it takes some effort to set this up.
  - **d. Epinephrine** bolus 1 mg IV (10 mL of a 1:10,000 solution) every 3–5 minutes; an infusion of 2–10 μg/min can be used for bradycardia.
  - **e. Vasopressin** one dose of 40 units IV can be given instead of epinephrine.
  - **f. Atropine** is not recommended for asystole or extreme bradycardia per the STS guidelines. In ACLS protocols, the recommended dose is 1 mg IV with repeat doses of 1 mg every 3–5 minutes to a total dose of 0.04 mg/kg.
- **5. Bradycardia** that is unresponsive to epicardial pacing
  - **a.** Attempt **transcutaneous** pacing
  - **b. Epinephrine** 2–10 mg/min (1 mg/250 mL mix)
- **6. Tachycardia with pulses** may be well tolerated at a rate of less than 150 bpm, but at higher rates the patient may develop chest pain, altered mental status, or hypotension.
  - **a.** If unstable, perform synchronized cardioversion with 200–360 joules.
  - **b. Stable with narrow QRS** usually represents a supraventricular mechanism.
    - ∙ **Regular rhythm:** give adenosine 6 mg IV push with two repeat doses of 12 mg IV; if conversion occurs, this probably represents a reentry supraventricular tachycardia (SVT); if the rhythm does not convert, it may represent atrial flutter, ectopic atrial tachycardia, or junctional tachycardia that should be managed with diltiazem and/or β‐blockers.
    - ∙ **Irregular rhythm** may be AF/flutter or multifocal atrial tachycardia that should be managed with IV diltiazem and/or β‐blockers.
  - **c. Stable with wide complex QRS** is usually VT or AF with aberrancy.
    - ∙ **Regular rhythm** is most likely VT and should be treated by amiodarone 150 mg IV over 10 minutes and then a synchronized cardioversion if persistent; if it represents SVT with aberrancy, it should be treated with adenosine.

∙ **Irregular rhythm** is most commonly AF with aberrancy, to be treated with diltiazem and/or β‐blockers; less common are AF with Wolff‐Parkinson‐ White (WPW) syndrome (use amiodarone), polymorphic VT, or torsades de pointes (give magnesium).

#### **7. Emergency sternotomy**

- **a.** The potential need for an open sternotomy should be considered immediately when a cardiac arrest occurs and should be performed within five minutes if resuscitation is unsuccessful. It usually takes at least that long to get everybody and everything organized to accomplish an open sternotomy. The team leader who is coordinating the resuscitation is most likely the best individual to keep track of time. During the stress of a cardiac arrest, sometimes one minute seems like five minutes, or vice versa. If defibrillation for VT/VF or pacing for asystole is unsuccessful in restoring a rhythm, uninterrupted chest compressions are essential to optimize perfusion and should be performed as long as necessary or until the chest can be opened. If one cannot achieve a systolic pressure >60 mm Hg with compressions, it is likely that tamponade or severe hypovolemia is present, and emergency resternotomy should be performed.
- **b.** Emergency resternotomy is a life‐saving procedure in patients with bleeding or tamponade as it will allow for evacuation of blood and control of bleeding. If the cardiac surgeon is not available to open the chest, manual control of the bleeding site by a less experienced person can often be achieved, allowing the surgeon to subsequently precisely control the bleeding site. Invariably, immediate hemodynamic improvement will be noted if the patient has been fluid resuscitated. In patients with other causes of cardiac arrest, such as myocardial ischemia from graft occlusion or primary arrhythmic events, internal massage is much more effective than external compressions.
- **c.** Emergency resternotomy is still feasible up to 10 days after surgery and may be considered later based on an experienced surgeon's judgment.
- **d.** Emergency re‐exploration for cardiac arrest can be problematic in patients whose surgery was performed through an approach other than a full sternotomy. A full sternotomy is usually required to perform effective internal cardiac massage, and it has been recommended that a sternal saw be available in the ICU for use by an experienced surgeon in these situations. Equipment to remove rigid fixation devices (sternal talons, plates) should be available at the bedside for patients whose sternums were reapproximated with these systems after a full sternotomy.
- **e.** Internal cardiac massage for most "first responders" requires two‐handed massage, with the right hand placed behind the heart after identifying the grafts (primarily the LITA graft) and the left hand placed anteriorly with the fingers flat to minimize cardiac damage. Massage should occur at 100–120/min. With experience, excellent internal massage can be carried out with the left hand alone.
- **f.** If the patient cannot be resuscitated successfully, placement of a transfemoral IABP may improve myocardial perfusion in cases of a primary cardiac event. A more supportive measure is the establishment of CPB through the open sternotomy incision to rest the heart. Peripheral ECMO can also be considered and

- may be beneficial for nonbleeding/tamponade arrests in patients without a full sternotomy incision or for those who require prolonged support.
- **8. Persistent hypotension.** Reestablishment of satisfactory myocardial blood flow is the most important element in a successful resuscitation. Because coronary perfusion occurs during compression "diastole" (i.e. when the aortic pressure exceeds the right atrial pressure), elevation of SVR and coronary perfusion pressure is critical. This is best achieved with medications that have predominantly α effects (epinephrine in high doses) or strong vasoconstrictor properties (vasopressin). Patients with a cardiac etiology to their arrest will often benefit from placement of an IABP.

#### **9. Other situations**

#### **a. Intra‐aortic balloon counterpulsation**

- **i.** The IABP will respond to a pacing spike, so in the presence of asystole or PEA, the monitor tracing may identify the spike and give the false impression of cardiac activity. Lack of pulsatility in other waveforms and no cardiac component to the IABP tracing are clues to the presence of asystole or very weak cardiac contractions.
- **ii.** The IABP should be set in the pressure trigger mode that will respond to external cardiac massage. If there is a prolonged period of no massage, the internal trigger at 100/min should be used.
- **b. Minimally invasive incisions.** As noted, a full sternotomy would need to be made to initiate internal massage if the patient had a hemisternotomy or limited thoracotomy incision for the original surgery.
- **c. Cardiac assist devices:** external compressions can be performed in patients with implantable centrifugal or axial flow pumps, but generally are not recommended, as they can displace the devices.

#### **10. Controversial medications**

- **a. Epinephrine and vasopressin** are the two recommended drugs in ACLS protocols for intractable VF as well as asystole. When given as a bolus dose, they may cause a hypertensive crisis after cardiac recovery, and therefore routine use has been discouraged in cardiac surgical patients.
- **b. Sodium bicarbonate** should not be given routinely for the attended arrest during which excellent ventilation and cardiac compressions are achieved. Administration of NaHCO3 reduces SVR and compromises cerebral perfusion, creates extracellular alkalosis that shifts the oxygen–hemoglobin dissociation curve to the left, inhibiting oxygen release to tissues, exacerbates central venous acidosis, inactivates catecholamines administered during an arrest, and can produce hypernatremia and hyperosmolarity. Its use should be guided by the results of ABGs drawn every 10 minutes during the arrest. If not drawn and there are questions about the timing of the arrest and the initiation of CPR or its adequacy, it is not unreasonable to presume that the patient is acidotic and give NaHCO3 in doses of 1 mEq/kg, with half that dose re‐administered 10 minutes later.
- **c. Calcium chloride** is not routinely recommended during a cardiac arrest as it may contribute to intracellular damage. Doses of 5–10 mL of a 10% solution can be given for hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, or CCB toxicity.

- **d. Atropine** is not recommended for bradycardia or asystole in the STS guidelines, as it has not been shown to improve outcomes.275 Pacing should be utilized instead, using the epicardial wires or transcutaneous pacing.
- **11. Post‐arrest care.** Virtually all patients following an arrest should be monitored and assessed in the ICU. Most will stabilize if an immediately treatable cause has been identified. If the chest has been opened, it may be closed in the ICU if provisions are available. Otherwise, it is beneficial to return the patient to the operating room for further evaluation and chest closure. The risk of wound infection is quite low despite opening the chest in the ICU under emergency circumstances.280
  - **a.** Most patients will require mechanical ventilatory support, and use of sedatives can confound a neurologic evaluation. Although there may be some benefit to a hypothermia protocol, early weaning of sedation is feasible once the patient's hemodynamics, ABGs, acid-base balance, electrolyte and and glucose status have improved.
  - **b.** Myocardial "stunning" is common, and an immediate post‐arrest assessment of myocardial function by echocardiography may be misleading as to whether the arrest was caused by a primary cardiac event. Similarly, cardiac biomarkers may be elevated from ischemia and defibrillation and may not necessarily reflect myocardial damage preceding the arrest. However, placement of an IABP is very beneficial when a myocardial insult is suspected, and cardiac catheterization should be considered if there are any associated ECG changes prior to or following the arrest. Patients suffering VF/VT arrests with known impairment of LV function should be further evaluated by an electrophysiologist, and implantation of an ICD should be considered.
  - **c.** The long‐term outcome of a patient sustaining a postoperative arrest is suboptimal. One study found that at a mean follow‐up of 7.5 years, the mortality rate was twice as high in those who arrested and survived the hospital stay compared with those who did not sustain an arrest.274

#### **XI. Pacing Wires and Pacemakers**

#### **A. General comments**281,282

- **1.** The use of cold cardioplegic arrest is commonly associated with temporary sinus node or AV node dysfunction. Placement of two temporary right atrial and two right ventricular epicardial pacing wire electrodes is beneficial in these situations to optimize hemodynamics at the conclusion of bypass and for several hours in the ICU (Figure 11.16). Pacing wires are also useful in the event that medications used to control atrial fibrillation precipitate advanced AV block. They can also be used for overdrive pacing and have diagnostic utility in delineating unusual rhythm problems.
- **2.** Reluctance to routinely place epicardial wires during surgery is based on concerns that bleeding and tamponade may complicate their removal. This is nearly always associated with the removal of ventricular wires and, although very uncommon, can be life‐threatening. Nonetheless, although most surgeons will place ventricular wires, many tend to avoid placement of atrial pacing wires. Bleeding is rare with their removal unless they are directly sewn to the right atrium. Placing the wires into a plastic button sewn low on the right atrial free wall will virtually never result

**Figure 11.16 •** (A) Atrial pacing wires (Medtronic 6500) are placed into a plastic disk that is sewn low on the right atrial free wall, permitting contact of the electrodes with the atrial wall. (B) The two ventricular wires are sewn superficially over the right ventricular free wall or inferiorly in the muscle.

PA; pulmonary artery; RV, right ventricle.

- in bleeding with wire removal (Medtronic model 6500 wires). The benefits of atrial pacing in bradycardic patients with LVH or LV dysfunction can be significant.
- **3.** To assess whether pacing wire placement should be performed routinely, one study found that 15% of patients needed pacing to terminate bypass, but less than 10% of patients required temporary pacing postoperatively.283 However, it is not always predictable which patients may require subsequent pacing, and it is recommended that at least one ventricular pacing wire (with a skin ground) should be placed; the risk:benefit ratio of atrial pacing wires suggests that they should be placed routinely as well.
- **B. Diagnostic uses.** When the exact nature of an arrhythmia cannot be ascertained from a 12‐lead ECG, atrial electrograms (AEGs) are helpful in making the appropriate diagnosis. Atrial pacing wires can be used to record atrial activity in both unipolar and bipolar modes. With suitably equipped monitors, these recordings can be obtained simultaneously with standard limb leads to distinguish among atrial and junctional arrhythmias and differentiate them from more life‐threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Simultaneous ECG and AEG tracings for each of the most commonly encountered postoperative arrhythmias are provided in section XII, starting on page 611. The technique for obtaining atrial wire tracings is either of the following:
  - **1.** A multichannel recorder can be used to print simultaneous monitor ECGs and AEGs. Most monitoring systems have cartridges with three leads for recording the AEG: two of them represent the arm leads and are connected with alligator clips to the atrial pacing wires; the third represents a left leg lead and is attached to an electrode pad over the patient's flank. When the monitor channel for the

![](_page_87_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 11.17 •** Sinus rhythm in simultaneous monitor leads and AEGs. In the upper tracing, note that the bipolar AEG (lead I) produces predominantly an atrial complex with essentially no visible ventricular complex. In contrast, the unipolar tracing (leads II and III) at the bottom shows both a large atrial wave and a smaller ventricular complex.

AEG is set on lead I, a bipolar AEG is obtained (Figure 11.17). This shows a large atrial complex and a very small or undetectable ventricular complex. When the AEG monitor channel is set on leads II or III, a unipolar AEG is obtained. This demonstrates a large atrial and slightly smaller ventricular complex.

**2.** When a standard ECG machine is used, the two arm leads are connected to the atrial wires with alligator clips, and the leg leads are attached to the right and left legs. A bipolar AEG will be recorded in lead I and a unipolar AEG in leads II or III. Alternatively, the atrial wires can be connected to the V leads. Bipolar AEGs give a better assessment of atrial activity than unipolar AEGs and can distinguish between sinus tachycardia and atrial arrhythmias. However, because the AEG and standard ECG tracings are not obtained simultaneously, a unipolar tracing is required to differentiate sinus from junctional tachycardia because it can demonstrate the relationship between the larger atrial and smaller ventricular complexes.

#### **C. Therapeutic uses**

**1.** Optimal hemodynamics are achieved at a heart rate of around 90 bpm in the immediate postoperative period. Use of temporary pacing wires attached to an external pulse generator (Figure 11.18) to increase the heart rate is preferable to the use of positive chronotropic agents that have other effects on myocardial function. Atrial pacing with normal conduction will nearly always demonstrate superior hemodynamics to AV pacing, which in turn is superior to ventricular pacing.

pacing can improve hemodynamics, especially in patients with impaired ventricular function.284

- **2.** Some, but not all, studies have showed that biventricular pacing with leads placed during surgery will improve LV systolic and diastolic function compared with RA or RA–RV pacing in patients with AV block who have LV dysfunction. Benefit is greatest in patients who also have a wide QRS complex.40–43
- **3.** Reentrant rhythms can be terminated by rapid pacing. Rapid atrial pacing can terminate type I atrial flutter (flutter rate of less than 350/min) and other paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias. Rapid ventricular pacing can terminate VT.

#### **D. Pacing nomenclature**

- **1.** The sophistication and reprogrammability of permanent pacemaker systems led to the establishment of a joint nomenclature by the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology (NASPE) and the British Pacing and Electrophysiology Group (BPEG). This nomenclature classifies pacemakers by their exact mode of function (Table 11.12).
- **2.** Use of the first three letters is helpful in understanding the temporary pacemaker systems that are used after cardiac surgical procedures (Table 11.13). The most

**Figure 11.19 •** Atrial pacing at a rate of 95 bpm. The atrial pacing stimulus artifact (Sa) is well seen in this tracing but is frequently difficult to identify on the monitor. The height of the atrial pacing spike may be increased on the monitor for better visualization, or it may be decreased to prevent problems with ECG interpretation or IABP tracking.

common modes are AOO (asynchronous atrial pacing), VVI (ventricular demand pacing), DVI (AV sequential pacing), and DDD (AV sequential demand pacing).

#### **E. Atrial pacing**

- **1.** Atrial bipolar pacing is achieved by connecting both atrial electrodes to the pacemaker. This produces a smaller pacing stimulus artifact on a monitor than unipolar pacing and can often be difficult to detect even in multiple leads (Figure 11.19). It does, however, prevent IABP consoles from misinterpreting large pacing spikes as QRS complexes.
- **2.** Atrial pacing can also be achieved using transesophageal electrodes or a pacing catheter placed through Swan‐Ganz Paceport catheters. These are particularly beneficial during minimally invasive surgery.285
- **3.** Pacing is usually accomplished in the AOO or AAI mode. The usual settings include a pulse amplitude of 10–20 mA in the asynchronous mode (insensitive to the ECG signal), set at a rate faster than the intrinsic heart rate. With the Medtronic 5392 External Dual‐Chamber Pacemaker, AAI demand pacing may be accomplished if atrial sensing is satisfactory.

- **4. Indications.** Atrial pacing requires the ability to capture the atrium as well as normal conduction through the AV node. It is ineffective during atrial fibrillation/ flutter (AF/flutter).
  - **a.** Sinus bradycardia or desire to increase the sinus rate to a higher level
  - **b.** Suppression of premature ventricular complexes (PVCs): set at a rate slightly faster than the sinus mechanism
  - **c.** Suppression of premature atrial complexes or prevention of AF (with dual‐site atrial pacing)
  - **d.** Slow junctional rhythm
  - **e.** Overdriving supraventricular tachycardias (atrial flutter, paroxysmal atrial or AV junctional reentrant tachycardia). Rapid atrial pacing can interrupt a reentrant circuit and convert it to sinus rhythm or a nonsustained rhythm, such as AF, which may allow for better rate control and which may terminate spontaneously.

#### **5.** Technique of overdrive pacing

- **a.** Overdrive pacing is accomplished using pacemakers that can produce rates as high as 800/min. When attaching pacemaker wires to the generator, **be absolutely certain** that the atrial wires, not the ventricular wires, are being attached. Pacing initially 10–15 beats/min above the ventricular rate will allow one to determine whether the ventricle is inadvertently being paced, which can occur when atrial pacing wires are placed close to the ventricle.
- **b.** The patient must be attached to an ECG monitor during rapid atrial pacing. Bipolar pacing should be used to minimize distortion of the atrial complex. Pacing spikes are often best identified by evaluation of lead II.
- **c.** Turn the pacer to full current (20 mA) and to a rate about 10 beats faster than the tachycardia or flutter rate. When the atrium has been captured, increase the rate slowly until the morphology of the flutter waves changes (atrial complexes become positive). This is usually about 20–30% above the atrial flutter rate. Pacing for up to one minute may be required.
- **d.** The pacer should be turned off abruptly. Sinus rhythm, a pause followed by sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation, or recurrent flutter may be noted (Figure 11.20). If severe bradycardia develops, the pacemaker may be turned on at a rate around 60 until the sinus mechanism recovers.

#### **F. Atrioventricular (AV) pacing**

- **1.** AV pacing is achieved by connecting both atrial wires to the atrial inlets and both ventricular wires to the ventricular inlets of a dual‐chamber pacer (Figure 11.21). If two ventricular wires are not available or not functioning, a skin lead can be used as a ground (the positive electrode) for ventricular pacing. The atrial and ventricular outputs are both set at 10–20 mA with a PR interval of 150 ms. Cardiac output can often be improved by increasing or decreasing the PR interval to alter ventricular filling time.284 The ECG will demonstrate both pacing spikes, although the atrial spike is often difficult to detect.
- **2.** Current external pacemakers, such as the Medtronic 5392 model, can pace in a variety of modes. The DDD mode senses atrial activity, following which the ventricle contracts at a preset time interval after the atrial contraction. This mode reduces the risk of triggering atrial, junctional, and pacemaker‐induced

**Figure 11.20 •** Rapid atrial bipolar pacing of atrial flutter in sequential ECG tracings. The upper tracings confirm the rhythm as type I atrial flutter (rate 300/min) with variable AV block. In the lower tracing, rapid atrial pacing at a slightly faster rate entrains the atrium; the pacer is turned off and sinus rhythm resumes after a brief pause. The arrows indicate the atrial pacing stimulus artifact.

arrhythmias. Careful monitoring is necessary in the event that the pacemaker tracks the atrial signal in atrial fibrillation/flutter, resulting in a very fast ventricular response. However, setting an appropriate upper rate limit on these pacemakers usually prevents this complication. Occasionally, a pacemaker‐mediated tachycardia can develop from repetitive retrograde conduction from premature ventricular complexes, producing atrial deflections that are sensed and tracked.

**3.** If atrial activity is absent, either the DDD or DVI mode can be used. The DVI mode senses only the ventricle, so if a ventricular beat does not occur, both chambers are paced. This may lead to competitive atrial activity if the atrium is beating at a faster rate.

#### **4. Indications**

- **a.** Complete heart block
- **b.** Second‐degree heart block to achieve 1:1 conduction

**c.** First‐degree heart block if 1:1 conduction cannot be achieved at a faster rate because of a long PR interval

#### **5.** Additional comments

- **a.** Sequential AV pacing is ineffective during AF/flutter.
- **b.** AV pacing is always preferable to ventricular pacing because of the atrial contribution to ventricular filling. This is especially important in noncompliant ventricles, for which atrial contraction contributes up to 20–30% of the cardiac output. Atrial pacing alone in patients with normal conduction is superior to AV pacing by ensuring virtually simultaneous biventricular activation. Biventricular pacing usually provides superior hemodynamics to RA–RV pacing in patients with impaired LV function, especially with a prolonged QRS interval.40–43
- **c.** If sudden hemodynamic deterioration occurs during AV pacing, consider the possibility that atrial fibrillation has occurred with loss of atrial contraction. If AV conduction is slow, the ECG will demonstrate two pacing spikes with a QRS complex suggesting AV sequential pacing, although only ventricular pacing is occurring. This may be noted in the DDD mode with undersensing of AF or in the DVI mode in which the atrium is not sensed. If the patient has no detectable blood pressure despite pacing spikes on the monitor, VF may be present.

#### **G. Ventricular pacing**

- **1.** Ventricular pacing is achieved by connecting the two ventricular wires to the pulse generator for bipolar pacing or connecting one ventricular wire to the negative pole and an indifferent electrode (skin wire or an atrial wire) to the positive pole for unipolar pacing.
- **2.** The pacemaker is used in the VVI mode. The ventricular output is set at 10–20 mA in the synchronous (demand) mode. The rate selected depends on whether the pacemaker is being used for bradycardia backup, pacing at a therapeutic rate, or for overdrive pacing (Figure 11.22). Ventricular pacing in the VOO mode or in the VVI mode with undersensing of native R waves may result in the delivery of an inappropriate spike on the T wave at a time when the ventricle is vulnerable, inducing ventricular tachyarrhythmias.

#### **3. Indications**

- **a.** A slow ventricular response to AF/flutter
- **b.** Failure of atrial pacing to maintain heart rate
- **c.** Ventricular tachycardia (overdrive pacing)

![](_page_93_Figure_14.jpeg)

**Figure 11.22 •** Ventricular pacing at a rate of 80 bpm, demonstrating the wide ventricular complex. Since the patient's own ventricular rate is slower, the pacemaker produces all of the ventricular complexes. Sv, ventricular pacing stimulus artifact.

- **4.** If a patient is dependent on AV or ventricular pacing, the pacing threshold must be tested. Gradually lower the mA until there is no capture. If the current necessary to generate electrical activity is rising or exceeds 10 mA, consideration should be given to placement of a transvenous pacing system (temporary or permanent).
- **5.** If the pacemaker is in the demand mode, the sensing threshold should be checked. This represents the least sensitive mV at which the pacemaker can detect an ECG signal. Since demand pacing relies on the native rhythm to determine when to pace, undersensing will result in inappropriate pacing, while oversensing will inhibit pacing. To determine the sensing threshold, set the pacemaker to the VVI or DDD mode and turn the outputs to a very low level. Decrease the sensitivity (which increases the mV) until the sense indicator stops flashing and the pace indicator starts flashing. Then increase the sensitivity (which decreases the mV) until the sense indicator flashes again. This represents the sensing threshold. **Ventricular tachycardia can be triggered by inappropriately sensing ventricular pacing wires.**

#### **H. Potential problems with epicardial pacing wire electrodes**

- **1. Failure to function** may result from:
  - **a.** Faulty connections of the connecting cord to the pacing wires or to the pulse generator
  - **b.** A defective pacing cord
  - **c.** Faulty pulse generator function (low battery)
  - **d.** Electrodes located in areas of poor electrical contact and high threshold
  - **e.** Undetected detachment of the wire electrode from the atrial or ventricular epicardium
  - **f.** Undetected development of AF/flutter causing failure of atrial capture
- **2.** Options to restore pacemaker function and/or reestablish a rhythm include:
  - **a.** Checking all connections; changing the connecting cord
  - **b.** Increasing the output of the pulse generator to maximal current (20 mA)
  - **c.** Using a different wire electrode as the negative (conducting) electrode (reversing polarity)
  - **d.** Unipolarizing the pacemaker by attaching the positive lead to a surface ECG electrode or skin pacing wire
  - **e.** Converting to ventricular pacing if the atrial stimulus fails to produce capture
  - **f.** Using a chronotrope (any of the catecholamines) to increase the intrinsic rate or possibly increase atrial sensitivity to the pacing stimulus
  - **g.** Placing a transvenous pacing wire if the patient has heart block or severe bradycardia and is pacer‐dependent
  - **h.** Attaching transcutaneous pacing pads
- **3. Change in threshold.** The pacing threshold rises from the time of implantation because of edema, inflammation, thrombus, or the formation of scar tissue near the electrodes. If an advanced degree of heart block persists for more than a few days, consideration should be given to the placement of a permanent transvenous pacemaker system.
- **4. Oversensing problems.** If the atrial activity of AF/flutter is sensed during DDD pacing, a very fast ventricular response will be noted. The upper rate limit should

- be programmed (i.e. lowered) to prevent this. If this is not possible, the pacemaker should be converted to the VVI mode. Oversensing of T waves may lead to inhibition of VVI pacing.
- **5. Competition with the patient's own rhythm.** When atrial or ventricular ectopy occurs during asynchronous pacing, suspect that the pacemaker is set at a rate similar to the patient's intrinsic mechanism. Turning off the pacemaker will eliminate the problem.
- **6. Inadvertent triggering of VT or VF.** Use of ventricular pacing in the asynchronous mode can potentially trigger ventricular ectopy by competing with the patient's own mechanism. Appropriate sensing should always be confirmed if the pacemaker generator is left attached to the patient and is turned on. Ventricular pacing must always be accomplished in a demand mode (DVI, VVI, DDD). Pacing wires that are not being used should be electrically isolated to prevent stray AC or DC current near the wires from triggering VF. Wires should be placed in needle caps and left in accessible locations.
- **7. Mediastinal bleeding** can occur if a pacing wire or the plastic carrier wire beyond the electrode (on Medtronic 6500 pacing wires) is placed close to bypass grafts, shearing them by intermittent contact during ventricular contractions. During epicardial wire removal, bleeding from vessels in the RV epicardial fat, muscle, the RV chamber, or even an adjacent graft can occur, especially if the wire was secured with sutures. This may occur despite easy removal or when excessive traction is applied. Bleeding is unlikely to occur when the atrial wires are placed in a plastic sleeve producing superficial contact with the atrial wall.
  - **a.** Pacing wires should be removed with the patient off heparin, before a therapeutic INR has been achieved in patients receiving warfarin, and off of a NOAC for about 12 hours. The patient should remain at bedrest and be observed carefully for signs of tamponade with frequent vital signs for several hours after removal of epicardial wires.
  - **b.** Some surgeons prefer that pacing wires be removed fairly early when chest tubes are still present, so any bleeding will be quickly detected. When wires are removed with chest tubes no longer present, progressive hemodynamic instability may warrant an echocardiogram to assess for a developing pericardial effusion. However, significant bleeding causing **cardiac tamponade can also occur within minutes** of pacing wire removal, for which arrangements for emergency sternotomy, commonly at the bedside, may be necessary.
- **8. Inability to remove the wire electrodes from the heart.** The wire can be caught beneath a tight suture on the heart or, more likely, between the sternal halves or within a subcutaneous suture. Constant gentle traction, allowing the heart to "beat the wire loose", should be applied. A lateral chest x‐ray may reveal where the wires are entrapped. If the wires cannot be removed, they should be pulled out as far as possible, cut off at the skin level, and allowed to retract. Infection can occur in pacing wire tracts, but it is unusual.
- **I.** Other temporary pacing modalities
  - **1.** Current monitor/defibrillators can provide transcutaneous pacing through gel pads attached to the patient's chest and back. This is most useful in emergency situations when epicardial pacing wires fail to function. This should not be relied

- upon for more than a few hours, because ventricular capture frequently deteriorates over time. This type of pacing is also very uncomfortable for the patient.
- **2.** Placement of a 5 Fr temporary transvenous ventricular pacing wire is indicated if the patient is pacemaker‐dependent and the threshold of the epicardial wires is high or the wires fail to function. These wires are usually placed through an introducer in the internal jugular or subclavian vein, but can also be placed through the femoral vein. The latter is routinely performed during TAVR procedures and may be left in place for advanced heart block or significant bradycardia. These wires have balloon tips that assist in floating the pacing wire into the apex of the right ventricle, although fluoroscopy may occasionally be required.
- **3.** Some Swan‐Ganz catheters have extra channels that open into the right atrium and ventricle (Paceport catheters) through which pacing catheters can be placed. This is convenient during and following minimally invasive cardiac operations. It is also helpful in emergency situations since central venous access has already been achieved. These pacing leads should not be relied upon for chronic pacing in the pacemaker‐dependent patient.
- **4.** Transesophageal atrial pacing is valuable during minimally invasive procedures and can be used in the intensive care unit on a temporary basis if AV conduction is preserved.285

#### **J. Indications for permanent pacemakers**

- **1.** Although the temporary use of epicardial pacing is not uncommon after surgery, most patients with preoperative sinus rhythm will achieve a satisfactory sinus rate within a few days and can receive β‐blockers for AF prophylaxis. Conduction abnormalities such as first‐degree block and bundle branch blocks are the most common abnormalities noted after CABG, but they have not been shown to affect long‐term outcome.286
- **2.** About 1–2% of patients require placement of a PPM after cardiac surgery. This is more likely in older patients, those with pulmonary hypertension or a preexisting left bundle branch block (LBBB), surgery that involves valve replacements (tricuspid > aortic > mitral), complex operations requiring a long cross‐clamp time, and reoperations.287–289
  - **a.** Tricuspid valve replacement involves suturing in close proximity to the AV node, and evidence of complete heart block should prompt placement of permanent epicardial pacing leads.
  - **b.** Mitral valve procedures performed through the superior transseptal approach are twice as likely to require a PPM, primarily for sinus node dysfunction.290 PPM placement is also more common following mitral annular reconstructive surgery and Maze procedures.287
  - **c.** AVR has about a 5% risk of requiring a PPM, more commonly when surgery is performed for endocarditis, aortic regurgitation, and with extensive calcification. The need for a PPM compromises the prognosis after a surgical AVR.291,292
- **3.** The risk of requiring a PPM after TAVR is greater with self‐expanding valves than balloon‐expandable valves, but newer designs and higher positioning have reduced the risk to less than 5%. Baseline conduction disturbances, especially a right bundle branch block (RBBB) with first‐degree block, increase the risk of complete heart block and the need for a PPM.293 In fact, a baseline RBBB also

- increases the risk of high‐grade AV block and sudden cardiac death after hospital discharge.294 A new LBBB leads to deterioration in LV function, increases the risk of requiring a PPM, and in most studies compromises intermediate‐term survival.295–298
- **4.** If a PPM is being considered in the postoperative patient, oral anticoagulation with warfarin should be withheld or given in low doses, with use of IV heparin for AF or valve thromboprophylaxis, when indicated. If the patient's INR is already in therapeutic range, the dose should be reduced to achieve an INR at the low therapeutic range if the patient is at high thromboembolic risk, at which point PPM implantation can be safely performed. It is preferable to avoid a heparin bridge, which is associated with more periprocedural bleeding.299
- **5.** PPM placement is indicated postoperatively for the following conditions:
  - **a.** Complete heart block
  - **b.** Symptomatic or significant sinus node dysfunction
  - **c.** Slow ventricular response to AF (usually at rates of less than 50 bpm) that persists despite cessation of potentially contributory medications, including β‐blockers, sotalol, amiodarone, CCBs, and digoxin.
  - **d.** Tachycardia‐bradycardia syndrome: when medications used to control a fast response to AF produce a very slow sinus mechanism upon conversion
  - **e.** Advanced second‐degree heart block with a slow ventricular response
- **6.** The optimal timing for placement of a PPM has not been determined. In some patients, the indication may be a transient phenomenon, and waiting a few extra days may obviate its need. However, it often seems more cost‐effective to implant a pacemaker after 3–4 days to expedite the patient's discharge from the hospital. A study from the Mayo Clinic showed that 40% of patients were not pacer‐ dependent at follow‐up, although about 85% of patients who required implantation for complete heart block had become pacer‐dependent.300 A follow‐up study of patients receiving PPMs after TAVR found that only 40% of patients receiving a PPM within 10 days were pacer‐dependent at one year.301

#### **XII. Cardiac Arrhythmias**

The development of cardiac arrhythmias following open‐heart surgery is fairly common. Supraventricular arrhythmias, especially atrial fibrillation, are noted in about 25% of patients. Ventricular arrhythmias are less common and usually reflect some degree of myocardial injury. Whereas AF is usually benign, ventricular arrhythmias may warrant further evaluation and treatment because of their potentially life‐threatening nature. The mechanisms underlying the development of most arrhythmias are those of altered automaticity (impulse formation) and conductivity (impulse conduction). An understanding of these mechanisms and the electrophysiologic effects of the antiarrhythmic drugs has provided a rational basis for their use. The treatment of arrhythmias commonly noted after open‐heart surgery is summarized in Table 11.14.

- **A. Etiology.** Although the factors that contribute to the development of various cardiac arrhythmias may differ, there are several common causes that should be considered.
  - **1.** Cardiac problems
    - **a.** Underlying heart disease
    - **b.** Preexisting arrhythmias

- **c.** Myocardial ischemia or infarction
- **d.** Poor intraoperative myocardial protection
- **e.** Pericardial inflammation
- **2.** Respiratory problems
  - **a.** Endotracheal tube irritation or misplacement
  - **b.** Hypoxia, hypercarbia, acidosis
  - **c.** Pneumothorax
- **3.** Electrolyte imbalance (hypo‐ or hyperkalemia, hypomagnesemia)
- **4.** Intracardiac monitoring lines (Swan‐Ganz PA catheter)
- **5.** Surgical trauma (atriotomy or ventriculotomy incisions), dissection near the conduction system (aortic valves) or suture placement near the AV node (tricuspid valve surgery)
- **6.** Drugs (vasoactive drugs, proarrhythmic effects of antiarrhythmic medications)
- **7.** Hypothermia
- **8.** Fever, anxiety, pain
- **9.** Gastric dilatation

#### **B. Assessment**

- **1.** Check the ABGs, ventilator function, position of the endotracheal tube, and chest x‐ray for mechanical problems.
- **2.** Check serum electrolytes (especially potassium).
- **3.** Review a 12‐lead ECG for ischemia and a more detailed examination of the arrhythmia. If the diagnosis is not clear‐cut, obtain an AEG. This is frequently beneficial in differentiating among some of the more common arrhythmias by providing an amplified tracing of atrial activity.

#### **C. Sinus bradycardia**

- **1.** Sinus bradycardia is present when the sinus rate is less than 60 bpm. It is frequently caused by persistent β‐blockade, dexmedetomidine, and the use of narcotics, and may result in atrial, junctional, or ventricular escape rhythms.
- **2.** Because sinus bradycardia reduces cardiac output, the heart rate should be maintained around 90 bpm following the termination of CPB to optimize hemodynamics. An increase in heart rate can improve myocardial contractility and cardiac output.
- **3. Diagnosis.** See Figure 11.23.

#### **4. Treatment**

- **a.** Atrial pacing should be used to take advantage of the 20–30% increase in stroke volume that results from the contribution of atrial filling. This is particularly helpful in the early postoperative period when reperfusion and myocardial edema impair ventricular compliance and cause diastolic dysfunction. Atrial contraction is especially important in patients with LVH, such as those with aortic valve disease or systemic hypertension, in whom loss of atrial "kick" reduces stroke volume by 25–30%.
- **b.** AV pacing should be used if abnormal AV conduction is present with a slow ventricular rate (second‐ or third‐degree AV block).

![](_page_100_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 11.23 •** Sinus bradycardia at a rate of 54 bpm recorded simultaneously in lead I and a unipolar AEG. The AEG demonstrates the larger atrial complex, a PR interval of 0.18 seconds, and the smaller ventricular complex.

- **c.** If atrial pacing wires were not placed at the conclusion of surgery or if they fail to function, one of the catecholamines can be used to stimulate the sinus mechanism. Epinephrine 1–2 μg/min, dobutamine 5–10 μg/kg/min, or isoproterenol 1–2 μg/min may be useful. However, these medications not only increase the heart rate but have other hemodynamic effects as well. Atropine 0.01 mg/kg IV (usually 0.5–1 mg IV) can be used for severe symptomatic bradycardia on an emergency basis.
- **d.** Ventricular pacing can be used if the atrium fails to capture or there is little response to pharmacologic management. It will nearly always produce less effective hemodynamics than a supraventricular mechanism. If the ventricular pacing wires fail to function, the other pacing modes listed on pages 609–610 can be considered.
- **e.** If sinus bradycardia is induced by medications used to either prevent or treat atrial fibrillation, lower doses or cessation of those medications should be considered if the heart rate remains <60 bpm. Patients with known sick sinus or tachycardia‐bradycardia syndrome often have problems with slow heart rates postoperatively when medications are used to slow the response to AF, and they may require placement of a PPM.

#### **D. Conduction abnormalities and heart block**

- **1.** Transient disturbances of conduction at the AV node are noted in about 25–45% of patients following coronary bypass surgery. They are more frequent when cold cardioplegic arrest is used for myocardial protection.
  - **a.** Conduction abnormalities are more common in patients with compromised LV function, hypertension, severe coronary disease (especially involving the right coronary artery in a right‐dominant system), long aortic cross‐clamp times, and extremely low myocardial temperatures. These findings suggest that ischemic or cold injury to the conduction system may be responsible for these problems. Although most will resolve within 24–48 hours, the persistence of a new LBBB suggests the possible occurrence of a perioperative infarction. The presence of a new LBBB after CABG does not appear to influence the long‐term prognosis.286

- **b.** Conduction abnormalities occurring after an AVR may be caused by hemorrhage, edema, suturing, or debridement near the AV node and bundle of His. A new LBBB, as well as the need for a PPM, is an ominous prognostic sign after both surgical and transcatheter AVRs, and has been found to compromise long‐term survival.291,295–298,302
- **c.** Algorithms for the management of conduction abnormalities following TAVRs were provided by a JACC scientific expert panel in 2019.303 Telemetry overnight was recommended for all patients following TAVR. PPM implantation was recommended for those who developed high‐grade AV block or complete heart block (CHB). If there was a new LBBB or persistent increase of >20 ms in the PR or QRS duration with a preexisting conduction disturbance (RBBB, LBBB, intraventricular conduction delay [IVCD] with QRS >120 ms, or first degree AV block), it was recommended that the pacemaker wire be left in overnight. If these changes persisted or the PR interval was >240 ms or the QRS duration was >150 ms with or without a LBBB, the patient was at higher risk of developing high‐grade AV block or CHB and may require monitoring for an additional 24 hours. In these patients, the options were implanting a PPM, continuous ECG monitoring after discharge, or invasive electrophysiologic evaluation to guide the decision about a PPM, with the presence of an infra‐Hisian block during atrial pacing or spontaneous HV interval >100 ms prompting consideration of a PPM.
- **d.** Exposure of the mitral valve by the biatrial transseptal approach involves division of the sinus node artery and anterior internodal pathways. Although some studies have not documented a higher incidence of postoperative rhythm disturbances, others have shown a high incidence of sinus node dysfunction with ectopic atrial rhythms, junctional rhythms, and varying degrees of heart block. About 10% of patients may require a PPM for bradycardia or complete heart block when this approach is used.290
- **2. Diagnosis.** See Figures 11.24–11.28.

#### **3. Treatment**

- **a.** Conduction abnormities are best treated using both atrial and ventricular pacing wires placed at the conclusion of surgery.
- **b. First‐degree AV block** is characterized by prolongation of the PR interval to greater than 200 ms and usually does not require treatment. If the PR interval is markedly prolonged, attempts to achieve faster atrial pacing will not achieve 1:1 conduction because the AV node will remain refractory when the next impulse arrives. This will produce functional second‐degree heart block. AV pacing in the DDD or DVI mode can be used in this situation. Shortening a prolonged AV interval can significantly improve hemodynamics, especially in patients with impaired LV function.284
- **c. Second‐degree AV** block is caused by intermittent failure of AV conduction.
  - **i.** Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) is characterized by progressive PR interval prolongation culminating in a nonconducted P wave with no QRS complex (Figure 11.25). This usually does not require treatment unless the ventricular rate is slow. In this situation, it can be treated by AV pacing

![](_page_102_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 11.24 •** First‐degree AV block recorded simultaneously in lead II and a bipolar AEG. The PR interval is approximately 0.26 seconds (260 ms).

![](_page_102_Figure_4.jpeg)

**Figure 11.25 •** Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) second‐degree block. The unipolar AEG demonstrates a constant atrial rate of 120 bpm with progressive lengthening of the A–V (PR) intervals until the ventricular complex is dropped. In the AEG, the atrial activity is represented by the larger of the two complexes (A, atrial complex; V, ventricular complex).

![](_page_102_Figure_6.jpeg)

**Figure 11.26 •** Second‐degree block. Atrial activity is present at a rate of 100/min with 2:1 block, producing a ventricular rate of 50/min.

(DVI) at a slightly faster rate. If the atrial rate is too fast to overdrive, it can be treated by DDD pacing.

**ii.** Mobitz type II is characterized by constant PR intervals and intermittent dropped QRS complexes. The P–P and R–R intervals remained unchanged. This reflects block in the His‐Purkinje system and therefore is associated with a wide QRS complex. If the ventricular rate is too slow,

![](_page_103_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 11.27 •** Complete AV block. The AEG demonstrates type I atrial flutter, but the monitor ECG shows no ventricular complex until ventricular pacing is initiated.

![](_page_103_Figure_4.jpeg)

**Figure 11.28 •** Complete AV block with AV dissociation. The unipolar AEG demonstrates an atrial rate of 140/min (large spikes) with no clear‐cut relationship to the QRS complex, which represents a junctional mechanism at a rate of 100/min.

AV pacing in the DVI or DDD mode should be used. If this rhythm persists, a PPM should usually be implanted because it is likely to progress to complete heart block.

- **iii.** 2:1 AV block entails a constant PR interval with a dropped QRS complex every other beat (Figure 11.26). It is treated in a similar fashion to Mobitz type II block with AV pacing.
- **iv.** High‐grade second‐degree heart block is evident when there is a constant PR interval but two or more consecutive atrial impulses do not conduct to the ventricle. It is treated by AV pacing and may require a PPM if persistent.
- **d. Third‐degree (complete) heart block** is characterized by failure of AV conduction of any atrial activity. Thus, there will usually be variable rates for the P waves and QRS complexes, which may be absent or represent escape rhythms at various rates (Figures 11.27 and 11.28). This usually requires AV pacing in either the DDD or DVI mode. If the atrial rate is acceptable, the DDD mode should be used to track the atrial rate and then provide a sequential ventricular contraction. If there is atrial inactivity or a slow atrial rate, either DDD or

- DVI pacing can be used. Ventricular pacing should be used if AF/flutter is present. Pacing is usually not necessary when there is an adequate junctional or idioventricular rate. However, AV pacing can be accomplished in the DVI mode or the DDD mode if the atrial rate is not too fast to take advantage of the atrial contribution to filling.
- **e.** If the patient is dependent on AV or ventricular pacing, the pacing threshold must be tested. Gradually lower the mA until there is no capture. If the current necessary to generate electrical activity is rising or exceeds 10 mA, consideration should be given to placement of a transvenous pacing system (temporary or permanent).
- **f.** If advanced degrees of heart block persist, the patient's medications should be reviewed. Those that might accentuate AV block (β‐blockers, amiodarone, CCBs, or digoxin) should be withheld to assess the patient's intrinsic rate and conduction. If complete heart block persists for more than a few days with the patient off these medications, a PPM should be placed. The most significant predictor of pacemaker dependency is its insertion for complete heart block.

#### **E. Sinus tachycardia**

- **1.** Sinus tachycardia is present when the sinus rate exceeds 100 bpm. It generally occurs at rates of less than 130. A faster and regular ventricular rate suggests atrial flutter with 2:1 block or paroxysmal supraventricular (atrial or junctional) tachycardia.
- **2.** Fast heart rates are detrimental to myocardial metabolism. They can exacerbate myocardial ischemia by increasing oxygen demand and decreasing the time for diastolic coronary perfusion. They also reduce the time for ventricular filling and can reduce stroke volume, especially in patients with LVH and diastolic dysfunction.

#### **3. Etiology**

- **a.** Benign hyperdynamic reflex response related to sympathetic overactivity:
  - ∙ Pain, anxiety, fever
  - ∙ Adrenergic rebound (patient on β‐blockers preoperatively)
  - ∙ Drugs (catecholamines)
  - ∙ Gastric dilatation
  - ∙ Anemia
  - ∙ Hypermetabolic states (sepsis)
- **b.** Compensatory response to myocardial injury or impaired cardiorespiratory status:
  - ∙ Hypoxia, hypercarbia, acidosis
  - ∙ Hypovolemia or low stroke volumes noted with small, stiff left ventricles with LVH and diastolic dysfunction
  - ∙ Myocardial ischemia or infarction
  - ∙ Cardiac tamponade

![](_page_105_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 11.29 •** Sinus tachycardia at a rate of 130 bpm on simultaneous recordings of monitor lead II and a unipolar AEG. Note the larger atrial and smaller ventricular complex in the unipolar AEG tracing, which demonstrates the 1:1 AV conduction.

- ∙ Tension pneumothorax
- ∙ Pulmonary embolism
- **c.** Once a patient is transferred from the ICU and is clinically stable, sinus tachycardia is usually caused by pain, anemia, hypovolemia, or respiratory issues. However, the possibility of delayed tamponade should always be kept in mind. Some patients have higher sympathetic activity and a higher baseline heart rate with no other identifiable cause.
- **4. Diagnosis.** See Figure 11.29.

#### **5. Treatment**

- **a.** Correction of the underlying cause
- **b.** Sedation and analgesia in the ICU setting; adequate analgesia subsequently on the postoperative floor
- **c.** β‐blockers can be used if the heart is hyperdynamic with an excellent cardiac output. They must be used cautiously, however, when cardiac function is marginal. Tachycardia is a compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output when the stroke volume is low, and attempts to slow the heart rate may prove detrimental. Even when the cardiac output is satisfactory, β‐blockers often lower the blood pressure significantly more than they reduce the heart rate.
  - **i.** Esmolol 0.25–0.5 mg/kg IV over one minute followed by a continuous infusion of 50–200 μg/kg/min. A trial bolus of 0.125 mg/kg is recommended to determine whether the patient can tolerate esmolol.
  - **ii.** Metoprolol 2.5–5 mg IV increments every five minutes for three doses
  - **iii.** Increasing doses of oral metoprolol (25–100 mg bid) are usually used to control a postoperative sinus tachycardia on the floor. Some patients are refractory to its effects and respond better to atenolol (25–100 mg qd).
- **d.** CCBs have mild negative chronotropic effects on the SA node, but they do not play a major role in the treatment of sinus tachycardia.
- **e. Note:** both IV β‐blockers and CCBs are safe to administer, but their simultaneous use must be done cautiously if functional pacing wires are not present.

![](_page_106_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 11.30 •** Premature atrial complexes (PACs) in monitor lead II and a unipolar AEG. Note the slightly different morphology of the normal (A) and premature (A′) atrial complexes and the slightly different PR interval following the PACs that indicates a focus different from the sinus node. The PR interval exceeds 120 ms, thus differentiating these beats from premature junctional complexes.

#### **F. Premature atrial complexes (PACs)**

- **1.** PACs are premature beats arising in the atrium that generally have a different configuration than the normal P wave and produce a PR interval that exceeds 120 ms. Although benign, they often herald the development of AF or flutter, and this occurrence can be very difficult to prevent.
- **2.** Magnesium sulfate may be beneficial in reducing the incidence of PACs in the immediate postoperative period. The dose is 2 g in 100 mL solution.
- **3. Diagnosis.** See Figure 11.30.

#### **4. Treatment**

- **a.** PACs generally do not need to be treated, but because they frequently precede the development of AF, medications that can alter atrial automaticity and conduction or slow the ventricular response to AF can be considered. These include β‐blockers, CCBs, and amiodarone.
- **b.** Digoxin is useful in decreasing the frequency of PACs and slows conduction through the AV node if AF does develop. However, by increasing conduction velocity in the atrium, digoxin can theoretically increase the risk of developing AF if PACs are present. It is rarely used in cardiac surgery patients anymore.
- **c.** Temporary right atrial pacing at a faster rate ("overdrive pacing") may suppress PACs, but it may also trigger atrial arrhythmias and induce AF. This may occur even in the AAI mode when there is difficulty sensing atrial activity leading to inappropriate pacing. This problem generally does not occur with permanent dual‐chamber pacemakers. If PACs occur during atrial pacing, one should suspect competition with the patient's own rhythm. Dual‐site atrial pacing may suppress PACs and also prevent AF.

#### **G. Atrial fibrillation or flutter**

**1.** Atrial fibrillation (AF) (atrial rate >380) and atrial flutter (atrial rate generally <380) are the most common arrhythmias noted after open‐heart surgery. Despite various prophylactic measures to decrease their incidence, they still occur in about

- 25–30% of patients. There is probably a reversible trigger that causes AF in postoperative patients in whom there is an underlying substrate for its development, such as increased dispersion of atrial refractoriness with nonuniform atrial conduction.
- **2.** Numerous **risk factors** for the development of AF have been identified, and their presence may indicate the aggressiveness with which prophylactic antiarrhythmic therapy should be used. Several models have been used to predict the risk of postoperative AF, although with limited success.
  - **a.** Risk models include the following:304–308
    - **i.** CHA2 DS2 ‐VASc score: HF, hypertension, older age, diabetes, stroke/ TIA, PVD, female gender
    - **ii.** POAF score: age >60 in increments, COPD, dialysis, emergency surgery, preoperative IABP, EF <30%
    - **iii.** AF risk index: older age, COPD, concurrent valve surgery, prior history of AF, withdrawal of β‐blockers and ACE inhibitors
    - **iv.** HATCH score: HF, stroke/TIA, age >75, COPD
    - **v.** CHARGE‐AF score: age, race, height/weight, blood pressure, and use of antihypertensive medications, smoking, diabetes, history of MI or HF
  - **b.** The most consistent risk factors in these models are those of older age, heart failure (systolic or diastolic), poor LV function, COPD, and withdrawal of β‐blockers. Other studies have shown an increased risk in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery, especially those with an enlarged left atrium, and with LVH, a baseline heart rate >100 bpm, or increased P‐ wave duration.309–312
  - **c.** Comparative studies of risk models suggest that some may be better than others in predicting the risk of AF. One analysis showed that the CHA2 DS2 ‐ VASc score, which was devised to predict the risk of stroke in nonanticoagulated patients with AF, may be more discriminative than the POAF and HATCH scoring systems in predicting the risk of postoperative AF.305 Another study found that, other than the CHARGE‐AF score, which is a predictor of AF in the general population, the best predictor of postoperative AF was the patient's age.308
- **3.** AF can compromise cardiac hemodynamics and also increases the risk of systemic thromboembolism and stroke from LA thrombus by two‐ to threefold.313 AF prolongs the hospital length of stay and increases hospital costs. Although it has not been shown consistently to influence operative mortality, its occurrence has been shown to increase the risk of early AF recurrence (28% within one month in one study),314 increase the risk of later AF eightfold, and reduce long‐term survival by twofold after coronary and valve surgery.315–320 The longer the duration of postoperative AF, the greater the impact on late survival.321
- **4.** AF occurs most commonly on the second and third postoperative day. By that time, myocardial function has recovered to baseline and few adverse hemodynamic effects are noted. However, when atrial tachyarrhythmias occur during the first 24 hours, especially when the patient is hemodynamically unstable, or in patients with noncompliant hypertrophied ventricles, a rapid ventricular response can

precipitate ischemia and lower the cardiac output by eliminating the atrial contribution to ventricular filling, leading to hypotension. Although slowing the ventricular response rate may improve the blood pressure, it may remain low because most drugs used to slow the rate tend to reduce the blood pressure as well (ß‐blockers and CCBs).

**5.** After the initial 24 hours, AF is frequently an incidental finding on the ECG monitor, and many patients do not even notice that it is present. Symptoms such as palpitations, nausea, fatigue, or lightheadedness may occur, especially in patients with LVH or poor ventricular function.

#### **6. Etiology**

- **a.** Enhanced sympathetic activity following surgery (intrinsic or with use of catecholamines) or adrenergic rebound in patients taking β‐blockers preoperatively, but not started postoperatively.322 However, it still occurs in those in whom β‐blockers are started the morning after surgery.
- **b.** Atrial ischemia from poor myocardial preservation during aortic cross‐ clamping. Since AF is associated with more complex procedures (redos, valve‐CABGs) during which there is a longer cross‐clamp time, inadequate protection of the atria and systemic hypothermia are likely to be contributory. Nonetheless, a reduced incidence of AF following off‐pump surgery has not been documented in most studies.323,324
- **c.** Acute atrial distention from fluid shifts and chronic atrial dilatation from preexisting structural heart disease, including hypertension, ischemic or valvular heart disease. These create the substrate that leads to the occurrence and persistence of postoperative AF.
- **d.** Surgical trauma, inflammation (pericarditis), or oxidative stress
- **e.** Metabolic derangements (hypoxia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia)
- **7. Diagnosis.** See Figures 11.31 and 11.32.
- **8. Prevention.** Prophylactic therapy can reduce the risk of AF by approximately 50% with a trend towards a reduction in stroke.309–312,325–328
  - **a.** The only class I pharmacologic recommendation is the initiation of a low‐ dose ß‐blocker, which has been shown to reduce the incidence of AF by up to 65%. It should be given to all patients after surgery whether taken prior to

surgery or not, unless contraindicated by bradycardia, hypotension, pressor dependence, or a low cardiac output state. Metoprolol 12.5–50 mg bid and atenolol 25 mg qd are most commonly used. Numerous studies have reported that carvedilol, an α‐ and β‐blocker with oxidative‐stress reducing properties, commonly used in patients with depressed LV function, is superior to metoprolol in reducing the incidence of AF.329–331

- **b. Amiodarone** (class IIa indication) is a class III antiarrhythmic with some class I, II, and IV properties that is effective in reducing the incidence of AF by 50%, either when given alone or in conjunction with β‐blockers.309,327,328,332–337
  - **i.** The timing (pre‐, intra‐, or postoperative), route (IV vs. PO), and dosage of amiodarone which provides the best prophylaxis has not been clarified, because different protocols have been used in virtually every study. Optimal benefit requires adequate dosing to achieve electrophysiologic effects at the time of highest risk for AF. Thus, regimens of preoperative oral loading must be long enough or use high enough doses to be effective since it takes several days to achieve effect.
  - **ii.** The vast majority of studies have shown that amiodarone reduces the incidence of postoperative AF. Whether amiodarone should be used for all patients or only in those at higher risk has yet to be determined. It has been recommended for patients with the commonly identified risk factors noted in section 2.a, but most specifically for older patients, whether >age 60 or 70. Amiodarone may be particularly beneficial in patients with COPD, in whom the incidence and morbidity of AF are greater.338 However, the potential for acute amiodarone toxicity that can produce hypoxemia must be kept in mind.339
  - **iii.** In general, for patients at higher risk of AF, it is recommended that oral loading be started prior to surgery. In the classic PAPABEAR trial, a 50% reduction in postoperative AF was noted using a six‐day preoperative load of 10 mg/kg daily and a 13‐day total course.335 This benefit was independent of age, but was greater in patients >age 65. Other recommended regimens for patients undergoing elective surgery include:312
    - ∙ 200 mg tid × 5 days prior to surgery, then 400 mg bid × 4–6 days postoperatively

- ∙ 400 mg qid × 1 day prior to surgery, then 600 mg bid on day of surgery, then 400 mg bid × 4–6 days after surgery (if surgery scheduled within 1–5 days)
- **iv.** Logistic considerations in patients requiring more urgent surgery suggest that an alternative approach must be used. Protocols have included:
  - ∙ 150 mg IV load over 15 minutes given at the end of CPB, followed by a 1 mg/min infusion × 6 hours, then 0.5 mg/min × 18 hours (which would correspond to 1,050 mg over 24 hours) with conversion to oral dosing starting at 400 mg bid × 4 days and reduced to 200 mg daily for a few weeks.
  - ∙ 300 mg IV over 20 minutes on POD #1 then 600 mg bid × 5 days336
  - ∙ 0.73 mg/min starting on call to the operating room and continuing for 48 hours with conversion to 400 mg q12h for three days.337
- **v.** The benefits of continuing amiodarone after hospital discharge are uncertain. Amiodarone can probably be stopped at the time of discharge if effective for prophylaxis since it will have persistent electrophysiologic effects for weeks. If the patient does develop intermittent AF and converts, it is usually continued for about one month, with the dosage being weaned down to 200 mg qd. Some have argued that one week of therapy is adequate if the patient is discharged home in sinus rhythm.340
- **c. Ranolazine** is used primarily for patients with refractory angina, but it is a very effective antiarrhythmic medication with properties similar to amiodarone. It is effective in reducing the incidence and recurrence of postoperative AF by about 60%.341–343 Concomitant use of IV amiodarone enhances efficacy and shortens the time to AF conversion, and this combination may be more effective in patients with a reduced EF.344 One study found that ranolazine produced more than a fourfold reduction in postoperative AF compared with use of a β‐blocker.345 One recommended dosing regimen is 1 g PO preoperatively, then 1 g PO bid × 7 days.
- **d. Sotalol** is a β‐blocker with class III antiarrhythmic properties that is equally if not more effective than standard β‐blockers and as effective as amiodarone in preventing supraventricular tachyarrhythmias when used at a dose of 80 mg bid.327,328,346 However, it is a negative inotrope and is not tolerated in about 20% of patients, in whom hypotension, bradycardia, or AV block may develop. Sotalol may also cause QT prolongation and polymorphic ventricular arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes. It is excreted by the kidneys and should be avoided in patients with renal dysfunction. It is available in IV form (75 mg IV = 80 mg oral) if the patient cannot take the oral dose.
- **e. Magnesium sulfate** (2 g in 100 mL) is often effective in decreasing the occurrence and number of episodes of postoperative AF, although a meta‐ analysis could not demonstrate much benefit.347 It appears to be most effective when given with sotalol and when the serum magnesium level is low.348,349 Since it is benign and of potential benefit, it is worthwhile administering to all patients during surgery and on the first postoperative day in addition to β‐blockers.
- **f.** Although standard right‐atrial pacing may increase atrial ectopy and does not reduce the incidence of AF, **dual‐site atrial pacing** has been shown in

numerous studies to reduce the incidence of AF, especially when given with a β‐blocker.350,351 It is theorized that intra‐atrial conduction delays may contribute to AF. Dual‐site pacing alters the atrial activation sequence and may achieve more uniform electrical activation of the atria. It may also overdrive/suppress PACs, eliminate compensatory pauses after PACs, and reduce the dispersion of refractoriness that may contribute to AF.

- **g.** A number of other medications and substances have been evaluated for their effectiveness in reducing the incidence of postoperative AF. Those that have few side effects might be considered routinely, but medications with potential morbidity are not commonly utilized with the more routine use of β‐blockers and amiodarone.
  - **i. Dofetilide** is effective in reducing the incidence of AF (by 50% in one study), but other medications are preferable due to its cost and risk of causing QT prolongation.352
  - **ii. Propafenone** 300 mg PO bid is also effective and was found comparable to atenolol in one study. 353
  - **iii. Colchicine** (class IIb indication) has an anti‐inflammatory effect and is useful in reducing the incidence of post‐pericardiotomy syndrome. A meta‐analysis found that it reduced the incidence of AF by 30%.354
  - **iv. Steroids** (class IIb indication) may reduce inflammation and possibly the risk of AF, but commonly cause hyperglycemia and may increase the risk of infection.355 Study protocols include use of hydrocortisone 100 mg prior to surgery followed by 100 mg q8h × 3 days356 or methylprednisolone 1 g before surgery followed by dexamethasone 4 mg q6h x 4 doses after surgery.357
  - **v. Statins** given in high doses (atorvastatin 40–80 mg) in statin‐naive patients have been found in some studies to reduce AF by 50%, but meta‐analyses have not demonstrated any benefit.358–362 Nonetheless, virtually all patients undergoing cardiac surgery receive statins for other reasons, so a reduction in AF would be an incidental benefit.
  - **vi. Ascorbic acid** (vitamin C) 2 g before surgery and 1 g daily for five days has been shown to enhance the benefits of β-blockers in reducing AF.363 One meta‐analysis showed a 60% reduction in AF with use of vitamin C,364 but some trials have not found any benefit.365,366
  - **vii. N‐3 fatty acids** (fish oils) 2 g/day started preoperatively have been shown to reduce AF in CABG patients, but only when the EPA/DHA ratio was <1.367 However, the OPERA study published in 2012 failed to show this benefit.368
  - **viii.** A combination of multiple antioxidants, including vitamin C, vitamin E, and polyunsaturated fatty acids produced a 22% absolute reduction (nearly threefold) in AF.369
    - **ix. N‐acetylcysteine** is an antioxidant medication has been shown in several studies to reduce the incidence of AF by about 30%.364,370 The protocol is 50 mg/kg after the induction of anesthesia with additional doses on the first and second postoperative days.
      - **x.** CCBs, including diltiazem and verapamil, as well as digoxin, have not been uniformly efficacious in preventing AF.

- **xi.** The presence of pericardial blood is considered to create a pro‐inflammatory and pro‐oxidant milieu in the pericardial space that may contribute to AF. Placement of a posterior mediastinal pericardial tube may improve drainage, and performing a posterior pericardiotomy to allow blood to drain into the pleural space has been shown to reduce the incidence of AF.371,372
- **9. Management** of the unstable patient developing AF initially involves cardioversion, whereas the strategy for the stable patient involves rate control, anticoagulation if AF persists, and attempts to achieve conversion to sinus rhythm (Table 11.15 and Figure 11.33). Although conversion to sinus rhythm will occur in 50–80% of patients before hospital discharge with use of ß‐blockers,373 additional pharmacologic intervention is usually recommended to promote conversion and avoid the requirement for anticoagulation. Although it has been presumed that most patients will subsequently remain in sinus rhythm, follow‐up studies have shown a recurrence rate of up to 30%, which may be one factor that increases long‐term mortality in patients who develop postoperative AF.314 This approach is in contradistinction to medical patients in whom a rate‐controlled strategy is considered acceptable due to comparable survival, potentially fewer adverse effects from medications, yet worse functional outcome.374
  - **a.** Electric **cardioversion** with 50–100 joules can be used in a variety of circumstances.
    - **i.** Cardioversion should always be considered first if there is evidence of significant hemodynamic compromise. This is more common in the early postoperative period, when a very rapid ventricular response may be present and myocardial function is moderately depressed from surgery. AF is also more likely to have adverse effects in patients with significant LVH.
    - **ii.** If a patient fails to convert to normal sinus rhythm with medications within 48 hours, one strategy is to perform cardioversion to avoid the necessity for anticoagulation. The administration of amiodarone may increase the likelihood of successful cardioversion.375 If the patient is recurrently going in and out of AF, it will most likely occur again, so cardioversion is probably not worthwhile. If AF has been present or recurrent for more than 48 hours and the patient has not been anticoagulated, a preliminary TEE must be performed to rule out LA thrombus before performing cardioversion.376,377 The decision to prescribe anticoagulation for one month after delayed cardioversion may be considered, because de novo thrombus may form due to mechanical atrial inactivity after electrical cardioversion.378
    - **iii.** If the patient cannot be converted pharmacologically or electrically, anticoagulation should be given for three weeks and then elective cardioversion attempted. If successful, anticoagulation is continued for an additional four weeks.
  - **b. Rapid atrial overdrive pacing** should be attempted to convert atrial flutter (see Figure 11.20 and page 605 for technique of rapid atrial pacing). It is usually successful in converting only type I flutter (atrial rate of less than 350/ min). Several medications, such as propafenone and ibutilide, increase the efficacy of rapid atrial pacing by prolonging the atrial flutter cycle length.379,380

  - c. Increase prophylactic oral β‐blocker dose if hemodynamically stable (heart rate <100)
  - d. Rate control if heart rate >100
    - IV **metoprolol** 5 mg IV q5 min × 3 doses
    - IV **amiodarone**: give initial bolus or rebolus if received prior dosing; 150 mg over 30 min, followed by an infusion of 1 mg/min × 6 h, then 0.5 mg/min × 18 h, then 400 mg orally bid
    - IV **diltiazem** 0.25 mg/kg IV over two minutes, followed 15 minutes later by 0.35 mg/kg over two minutes, followed by a continuous infusion of 10–15 mg/h, if necessarya
  - e. Conversion to sinus rhythm and anticoagulation
    - Magnesium sulfate 2 g IV
    - Option #1: Amiodarone in the dose noted above
      - → If successful, continue amiodarone for 1–4 weeks
      - → If unsuccessful, consider cardioversion at 36–48 hours without heparin or subsequently on heparin; consider TEE to rule out LA thrombus
      - → If unsuccessful, continue anticoagulation and β‐blockers, but stop amiodarone
    - Option #2: heparin/warfarin or NOAC after 48 hours; await spontaneous conversion on β‐blockers and discharge home in either SR or AF
    - Option #3: consider alternative pharmacologic management if cardioversion is not attempted or is unsuccessful; anticoagulation after 48 hours
      - ⚬ **Sotalol** 80 mg q4h × 4 doses, then 80 mg bid and stop other β‐blockers
      - ⚬ **Propafenone** 1 mg/kg IV over two minutes, followed 10 minutes later by another 1 mg/kg dose; if IV not available, give one oral dose of 600 mg

      - ⚬ **Dofetilide** 500 μg PO bid
        - **c. Rate control** can be achieved most readily with one of the rapid‐acting IV medications. Once the rate has been controlled, the IV medications can be converted to oral ones. One study showed that 80% of patients who received only "rate control" drugs, such as β‐blockers and CCBs, converted to sinus rhythm within 24 hours, suggesting either some conversion efficacy or possibly spontaneous conversion.373 It is not uncommon to require use of multiple medications to achieve rate control and pharmacologic conversion.

![](_page_114_Figure_2.jpeg)

Figure 11.33 • Simplified algorithm for management of AF.

- i. ß-blockers are very effective in achieving rate control and have the advantage of converting about 50% of patients to sinus rhythm (whether considered spontaneous or not). If an oral β-blocker has already been given, it can be supplemented by an IV dose if the ventricular response is rapid. If the patient has a relatively slow heart rate (whether already receiving a β-blocker or not) and then develops AF, amiodarone or diltiazem is a better selection to avoid the bradycardia that may occur after conversion.
  - **Metoprolol** is the preferred β-blocker in that it can be given in the ICU or on the postoperative floor. It is a negative inotrope, so it must be used cautiously in patients with significantly compromised LV function or hypotension. For fairly rapid rates (>100 bpm), it is given in 2.5–5 mg IV increments q5 min up to a total dose of 15 mg. The onset of action is 2–3 minutes with a peak effect noted at 20 minutes. The duration of action is approximately five hours. Slower rates (<100 bpm) can be managed with increasing doses of oral metoprolol.
  - Esmolol can be used in the operating room or ICU setting with arterial line monitoring, but it is a very dangerous drug due to its tendency to produce hypotension. It has a rapid onset of action of two minutes with rapid reversal of effect in 10–20 minutes. Thus, it may be safer to use than longer-acting drugs in the immediate perioperative period in case adverse effects develop, such as bronchospasm, conduction disturbances, excessive bradycardia, or LV dysfunction. The dose is 0.125–0.5 mg/kg IV over one minute, followed by an infusion of 50–200  $\mu g/kg/min.^{381}$
- ii. Amiodarone is effective in reducing the ventricular response to AF due to its multiple mechanisms of action ( $\beta$ -blockade, class III effects), but the

rapidity and degree of slowing is less than with the β‐blockers and CCBs. It is especially useful in the patient with borderline hemodynamics and more compromised LV function because it lacks negative inotropic effects. Thus, it can be recommended as a first‐line therapy if the ventricular response is not excessively rapid or β‐blockers and CCBs are contraindicated; otherwise, it should be added after rate control has been achieved, primarily in an attempt to achieve conversion to sinus rhythm.

- **iii. Diltiazem** is an excellent alternative for patients with rapid AF and mildly to moderately compromised LV function in that it is a fairly weak negative inotrope. It must be used cautiously in hypotensive patients because of its vasodilatory effects, but blood pressure commonly improves with rate control. Concomitant use of an α‐agent may be helpful if the blood pressure remains marginal. Diltiazem is also preferable to ß‐blockers to control very rapid ventricular rates if the antecedent sinus mechanism was slow. It is less effective in slowing the ventricular response to atrial flutter and it is also less effective than β‐blockers and amiodarone in converting AF back to sinus rhythm.
  - ∙ **Dosage.** It is given in a dose of 0.25 mg/kg IV over two minutes, followed 15 minutes later by 0.35 mg/kg over two minutes, followed by a continuous infusion of 10–15 mg/h, if necessary. Heart rate response is noted in about three minutes with a peak effect within seven minutes. The reduction in heart rate lasts 1–3 hours after a bolus dose. The median duration of action is seven hours after a 24‐hour continuous infusion.
  - ∙ **Note:** caution must be used when administering any IV CCB concomitantly with an IV β‐blocker because of the risk of inducing complete AV block. Availability of functional pacing wires is essential.
- **d. Anticoagulation.** Heparinization should be considered for patients with recurrent or persistent AF to minimize the risk of stroke from embolization of LA thrombus. The risk : benefit ratio of initiating anticoagulation has to be individualized for every patient, balancing the risk of stroke with the risk of mediastinal bleeding. Understandably, guidelines have provided inconsistent information as to when anticoagulation should be started and how aggressive to be in achieving a therapeutic level of anticoagulation (such as starting warfarin without concomitant heparin).382,383 One report suggested that transient self‐limited postoperative AF is not a high‐risk situation, and aggressive anticoagulation was not warranted.384 However, another study found that AF preceded the occurrence of stroke in 36% of patients at a mean time of only 21.3 hours.385 Furthermore, an echo study found that 14% of patients developed thrombus and 39% had spontaneous echo contrast in the left atrium within three days of the development of AF.386
  - **i.** It is generally recommended that anticoagulation should be initiated after 48 hours of persistent or intermittent AF. 313 If AF develops within the first few days of surgery, the risk of bleeding may supersede concerns about the risk of stroke. Use of the CHA2 DS2 ‐VASc score to assess the risk of stroke and the HAS‐BLED score (see Appendices 10A and 10B) to predict the risk of bleeding might be of some value in deciding when to

initiate anticoagulation and whether to continue it, but neither one has been evaluated in postoperative cardiac surgical patients.387 If the patient is to receive warfarin (patients with mechanical valves), heparinization should be initiated. Otherwise, it is not unreasonable to select a NOAC, which can provide adequate thromboprophylaxis from the outset and may be continued after discharge. A strategy of early cardioversion may avert the need for anticoagulation. However, anticoagulation is essential before later cardioversion to reduce the risk of thromboembolism. Alternatively, a TEE can be performed to rule out LA appendage thrombus prior to attempting cardioversion.

- **ii.** If the patient remains in AF and is to be discharged on warfarin rather than a NOAC, bridging with low‐molecular‐weight heparin should be considered in patients at high risk (older patients, low EF, valve surgery).
- **iii.** Whether continuation of anticoagulation is warranted for the patient who converts back to sinus rhythm after several days is controversial. One rationale would be that it provides protection against stroke if the patient develops recurrent AF after discharge, which in one study was noted in nearly 30% of patients.314 It is not unreasonable to utilize the CHA2 DS2 ‐ VASc score in making that determination, although this has not been validated for such patients.
- **e. Conversion to sinus rhythm.** Conversion to sinus rhythm is fairly common with the use of β‐blockers or amiodarone and, as noted, nearly 80% of patients receiving either β‐blockers or CCBs, but not given type I or III anti‐arrhythmics, will convert back to sinus rhythm without additional medications.373 Nonetheless, numerous medications can be used to achieve pharmacologic conversion. However, if a patient cannot be converted pharmacologically, a strategy of anticoagulation, rate control, and subsequent cardioversion is a viable and cost‐effective alternative strategy.
  - **i. Magnesium sulfate** 2 g IV over 15 minutes is a benign and relatively effective means of converting patients back to sinus rhythm, with a conversion rate of 60% within four hours in one study.388
  - **ii. β‐blockers** are effective for both rate control and conversion, more so than diltiazem.381 The dosage of the prophylactic dose can be increased if the patient's blood pressure and heart rate are acceptable. Substitution of sotalol (80 mg bid) for the selective β‐blockers may be considered, because it is slightly more successful in producing conversion. However, many patients cannot tolerate sotalol because of bradycardia or hypotension.
  - **iii. Amiodarone** is probably the most effective drug for conversion of AF and produces adequate rate control, although not as promptly or as effectively as β‐blockers. Because it lacks other significant cardiac effects, it has an excellent safety profile. Hypotension is usually seen only with rapid IV infusion, and QTc prolongation, although common, is usually not accompanied by a proarrhythmic effect. Note that the QT interval adjusted for heart rate (QTc) is normally <450–470 ms. For rapid effect, amiodarone is given with the standard IV load (150 mg IV over 15–30 minutes, followed by a 60 mg/h infusion × 6 hours, then 30 mg/h × 18 hours), followed by an oral taper (400 mg bid for 1 week, 400 mg qd × 1 week,

- 200 mg qd × 2 weeks). If AF develops despite the use of prophylactic amiodarone, an additional 150 mg bolus can be given over 30 minutes. Alternatively, an oral load of 400 mg tid × 1 week may be given and then reduced to 200 mg/day.
- **iv.** The type IC and other type III antiarrhythmics have been successful in converting 50–70% of patients with recent‐onset AF back to sinus rhythm. They generally cause less hypotension than amiodarone and produce more rapid conversion.
  - ∙ **Propafenone** (class IC) is effective in slowing the ventricular response and in rapidly converting patients to sinus rhythm within a few hours. Because it is a negative inotrope, it is contraindicated in the presence of LV dysfunction. Comparative studies reported equivalent efficacy to amiodarone in converting patients back to SR, but with more rapid conversion.389–391 Similar conversion rates have been noted with IV and oral dosing, although conversion takes longer with oral dosing.392 The IV dose is 1–2 mg/kg IV over 15 minutes, followed 10 minutes later by another 1 mg/kg dose. The oral dose is 600 mg given once. IV propafenone is not available in the USA.
  - ∙ **Ibutilide** (class III) is an effective medication for conversion of AF and especially atrial flutter.393 It is given as a 1 mg infusion over 10 minutes (0.01 mg/kg if <60 kg) with a second infusion 10 minutes later, if necessary. Most patients will convert within one hour. Because of the proarrhythmic risk (VT and torsades), careful monitoring is required, and the infusion should be stopped as soon as the arrhythmia has terminated, VT occurs, or there is marked prolongation of the QT interval. Although safe in patients with moderately impaired LV function, it is best avoided in patients with very low EFs. In comparative studies, ibutilide was found to be just as effective as amiodarone in converting AF/flutter to sinus rhythm.394
  - ∙ **Dofetilide** (class III) has no negative inotropic effects and is beneficial when there are contraindications to class I drugs (i.e. LV dysfunction) or β‐blockers (i.e. bradycardia and COPD). It is usually given in a dose of 500 μg PO bid. One study using IV dofetilide (up to 8 μg/kg over 15 minutes) found that it was more successful in converting atrial flutter (70%) than fibrillation (30%) within one hour.395 It also causes QT prolongation and is proarrhythmic. The dosage must be adjusted by creatinine clearance and the baseline QTc. One study showed that the addition of magnesium did not affect dofetilide conversion of AF, but did double the efficacy of electrical cardioversion.396 IV dofetilide is not approved for use in the USA.
  - ∙ **Flecainide** (class IC) is effective in converting AF to sinus rhythm, and in one study was found to be more effective than IV propafenone or amiodarone.391 Although it is contraindicated in patients with structural heart disease, it is not unreasonable to consider in patients who are completely revascularized if other drugs are ineffective.
- **v. Vernakalant** (class III) is an atrial‐selective potassium‐ and sodium‐channel blocking agent which has been shown to convert about 50% of patients

with new‐onset postoperative AF to sinus rhythm at a median time of just over 10 minutes. The dosage is 3 mg/kg infused over 10 minutes with a subsequent 2 mg/kg infusion over 10 minutes if AF is still present after 15 minutes. The drug received approval by the European Union in September 2010, but was not approved for use in the USA as of mid‐2020.397–400

**vi. Low‐energy internal cardioversion** using epicardial defibrillation wires sewn to the left and right atria at the time of surgery is 90% successful in restoring sinus rhythm.401

#### **H. Other supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs)**

- **1.** This designation refers to a tachycardia of sudden onset that arises either in the atrium (paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, PAT) or in the AV nodal region (atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, AVNRT), or uses the AV node as an integral part of the reentrant circuit (atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia, AVRT). These rhythms usually occur at a rate of 150–250/min and are uncommon after cardiac surgery. PAT with AV block may be associated with ischemic heart disease and commonly results from digoxin toxicity. As with any arrhythmia causing a rapid ventricular response, immediate treatment is indicated because of potential adverse effects on myocardial metabolism and function.
- **2. Diagnosis.** Differentiation among sinus tachycardia, PAT, AVNRT, AVRT, and atrial flutter with 2:1 block may require examination of an AEG (Figure 11.34). Carotid sinus massage is often recommended as a diagnostic modality to differentiate among various arrhythmias by slowing the ventricular response to atrial tachyarrhythmias. However, it must be used cautiously in patients with coronary artery disease, not only because it may precipitate asystole but because it may produce an embolic stroke in patients with coexistent carotid artery disease.

#### **3. Treatment**<sup>402</sup>

- **a.** Rapid atrial overdrive pacing may capture the atrium and cause reversion to sinus rhythm.
- **b.** Cardioversion should be considered if there is evidence of hemodynamic compromise.
- **c.** Vagal stimulation will often break a reentrant rhythm involving the AV node. Carotid sinus massage must be used cautiously as noted above.

![](_page_118_Figure_11.jpeg)

**Figure 11.34 •** AV junctional tachycardia at a rate of about 140 bpm recorded in simultaneous monitor and bipolar AEGs. Note the nearly simultaneous occurrence of retrograde atrial activation in the AEG and the antegrade ventricular activation in the monitor lead.

- **d.** Adenosine produces transient high‐grade AV block and is successful in terminating SVT caused by AVNRT.403 It is given as a 6 mg rapid IV injection via a central line followed by a saline flush. A repeat dose of 12 mg may be given two minutes later. The half‐life of adenosine is only 10 seconds. Adenosine can help distinguish AVRT and AVNRT, in which it terminates the circuit, from atrial flutter or fibrillation, in which it transiently slows AV conduction and the ventricular rate.
- **e.** Medications used for AVNRT that slow SA node and AV conduction include:
  - ∙ Verapamil 5–10 mg (0.075–0.15 mg/kg) IV push over two minutes, followed 30 minutes later by an additional 10 mg (0.15 mg/kg), then start an infusion of 5 μg/kg/min.
  - ∙ Diltiazem given in standard doses (0.25 mg/kg IV over two minutes, followed 15 minutes later by 0.35 mg/kg, then an infusion of 10–15 mg/min if necessary) is effective in converting AVNRT to sinus rhythm in about 90% of patients.404 The dose usually given is 20 mg IV, followed by a 10 mg/ min infusion.
  - ∙ Metoprolol 5 mg q5 min to a total dose of 15–25 mg
- **f.** PAT with block is usually associated with digoxin toxicity and treatment should be provided accordingly:
  - ∙ Digoxin should be withheld and a digoxin level obtained
  - ∙ Administration of potassium chloride (KCl)
  - ∙ Digibind (digoxin immune Fab [ovine]) starting at a dose of 400 mg (10 vials) over 30 minutes if severe digoxin toxicity
  - ∙ Phenytoin (Dilantin) 250 mg IV over five minutes

#### **I. AV junctional rhythm and nonparoxysmal AV junctional tachycardia**<sup>402</sup>

- **1.** An AV junctional rhythm occurs when junctional tissue has a faster intrinsic rate than the sinus node. This generally occurs at a rate of less than 60 bpm and is termed a junctional escape rhythm.
- **2.** Nonparoxysmal AV junctional tachycardia occurs at a rate of 70–130/min and usually results from enhanced automaticity in the bundle of His or from triggered activity. In the postoperative patient, this rhythm may reflect digitalis toxicity, pericarditis, or an inferior infarction. Its presence may be suggested by a regularized ventricular rate in a patient with underlying AF and can be confirmed with an AEG.
- **3.** As with any nonatrial rhythm, cardiac output is diminished by lack of synchronous atrial and ventricular contractions.
- **4. Diagnosis.** See Figures 11.34 and 11.35. The focus may be localized by the relationship of the P wave to the QRS on a surface ECG (short PR interval if high‐ nodal, invisible P wave if mid‐nodal, and P wave following the QRS if low‐nodal). The P–QRS relationship is more evident on an AEG.

#### **5. Treatment**

- **a.** Slow junctional rhythm (junctional escape rhythm)
  - **i.** Atrial pacing if AV conduction is normal.
  - **ii.** AV pacing if AV conduction is depressed.

- **iii.** Use of a vasoactive drug with chronotropic β<sup>1</sup> action to stimulate the sinus mechanism; any drug the patient is receiving that might slow the sinus mechanism should be stopped.
- **b.** Nonparoxysmal junctional tachycardia402
  - **i.** Overdrive pacing at a faster rate may establish AV synchrony.
  - **ii.** If the patient is receiving digoxin, it should be stopped. Severe digoxin toxicity may be treated with digoxin immune fab (ovine) (Digibind). Use of potassium, lidocaine, phenytoin, or a β‐blocker may be helpful.
  - **iii.** If the patient is not on digoxin, a β‐blocker or CCB (diltiazem or verapamil) can be considered to slow the junctional focus (class IIa indication), with use of atrial or AV pacing to establish AV synchrony. Flecainide or propafenone are helpful as well (class IIb indication), but both are rarely used after surgery since they are negative inotropes and contraindicated in patients with LV dysfunction.

#### **J. Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs)**

- **1.** Despite complete revascularization with good myocardial protection, the occurrence of PVCs after surgery is quite common. One study, in fact, identified PVCs and couplets in 100 and 82% of postoperative patients, respectively, but they were of relative insignificance as they rarely led to sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias.405
- **2.** PVCs commonly reflect transient perioperative phenomena, such as augmented adrenergic tone or increased levels of catecholamines (endogenous or exogenous), inflammation and oxidative stress, myocardial stretch (as they are more common in patients with any degree of mitral regurgitation), irritation from a Swan‐Ganz catheter or endotracheal tube, abnormal acid–base status, or hypoxemia. Thus, most PVCs are self‐limited, benign, and not predictive of more serious or life‐ threatening arrhythmias. Ventricular ectopy is also fairly common preoperatively in the postinfarction patient and may persist after surgery, although ischemia‐ induced ectopy may be improved.
- **3.** Nonetheless, PVCs developing de novo may also reflect poor intraoperative myocardial protection or myocardial ischemia or infarction, and may herald

**Figure 11.36 •** Premature ventricular complexes (ventricular bigeminy) recorded simultaneously from monitor lead II and bipolar (upper) and unipolar (lower) AEGs. Note the wide QRS complex of unifocal morphology representing the PVC on the ECG. The bipolar AEG shows that the interval between atrial complexes is maintained despite the PVCs. The unipolar tracing shows that the PVC directly follows the sinus beat but leaves the ventricle refractory to the following beat, producing a full compensatory pause. V, premature ventricular complex.

malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Therefore, some surgical groups believe that even occasional PVCs should never be ignored in the early postoperative period. During the first 24 hours after surgery, when a multitude of cardiac and noncardiac precipitating factors may be present, it is of potential benefit and little risk to treat any ventricular ectopy.

**4. Diagnosis.** See Figure 11.36.

#### **5. Treatment**

- **a.** Correct the serum potassium with an intravenous KCl infusion at a rate up to 10–20 mEq/h through a central line. Some patients require potassium levels between 4.5 and 5.0 mEq/L to eliminate ventricular ectopy.
- **b.** Atrial pace at a rate exceeding the current sinus rate (overdrive pacing) unless tachycardia is present.
- **c.** Magnesium sulfate (2 g in 100 mL IV) administered at the termination of CPB has been shown to reduce the incidence of ventricular ectopy.406
- **d.** In patients with impaired LV function, recent infarction, or ongoing ischemia, PVCs are more likely to lead to VT or VF, although both are still uncommon. Nonetheless, in these and potentially all patients, it is not unreasonable to pharmacologically suppress ventricular ectopy. Commonly used drugs include:

- **i.** Lidocaine 1 mg/kg with 1–2 repeat doses of 0.5 mg/kg 10 minutes apart. A continuous infusion of 1–2 mg/min of a 1 g/250 mL mix should be started and continued for 12–24 hours. Do not exceed 4 mg/min to avoid seizure activity. Consider the patient's weight, hepatic function, and any underlying congestive heart failure when calculating a maximum dose. Several studies have shown about a 50% reduction in PVCs with less VT/ VF with a strategy of prophylactic lidocaine, albeit with little evidence that this influences outcomes.407,408 Another study showed that lidocaine may reduce myocardial injury in patients undergoing OPCAB.409 Note that lidocaine is the major component of del Nido cardioplegia, which does provide excellent myocardial protection during surgery.
- **ii.** Amiodarone 150 mg IV load over 15 minutes, followed by a 60 mg/h infusion × 6 hours, then 30 mg/h × 18 hours. Control of ventricular ectopy is an added benefit when amiodarone is used prophylactically to prevent AF.

#### **K. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF)**

#### **1. Etiology**

- **a.** VT/VF occur postoperatively in about 1–3% of patients undergoing open‐ heart surgery and carry a mortality rate of about 20–30%.410–412 Risk factors include prior infarction, an EF <40%, NYHA class III–IV, unstable angina, pulmonary and systemic hypertension, long pump times, low cardiac output syndromes, use of an IABP, and when bypass grafts are placed to infarct zones or noncollateralized occluded vessels, especially the left anterior descending artery. One study of patients undergoing CABG with an EF <50% (20% of whom had concomitant procedures) reported a much higher incidence of VT/ VF of 15%, but a lower mortality rate of 7.6%. In addition to LV dilatation and remodeling following an infarction, this study reported that chronic kidney disease, an EF <30% and not being on a preoperative β‐blocker increased the risk of VT/VF.413
- **b.** Ventricular tachyarrhythmias result from disorders of impulse formation or propagation. When they are present preoperatively on the basis of ischemia, resolution may be anticipated with revascularization of the ischemic zones. However, reperfusion of zones of ischemia or infarction can trigger de novo malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Potential triggers include residual ischemia or development of a PMI secondary to incomplete revascularization, anastomotic problems, or acute graft closure. Elevated levels of catecholamines and autonomic imbalance early in the postoperative periods may be contributory.
  - **i.** Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) (VT lasting less than 30 seconds) may be encountered for reasons similar to those of PVCs and may occur in patients with normal or abnormal ventricular function.
  - **ii.** Sustained monomorphic VT (VT lasting over 30 seconds) is usually noted in patients with a previous MI and depressed LV function, often with formation of a left ventricular aneurysm. The border zone between scar and viable tissue provides the electrophysiologic substrate for a reentry mechanism that passes through myocyte bands surviving within the infarct.414–416

- **iii.** Sustained polymorphic VT with a normal QT interval is usually caused by increased dispersion of repolarization in areas of reperfused ischemia or infarction. Triggered activity in the form of delayed afterdepolarizations and occasionally enhanced automaticity are the mechanisms involved. Polymorphic VT may be facilitated by perioperative phenomena such as ischemia, hemodynamic instability, use of catecholamines or intrinsic sympathetic activity, withdrawal of β‐blockers, and other metabolic problems. VF may be triggered by an acute ischemic insult.
- **iv.** Polymorphic VT with QT prolongation is called **torsades de pointes**. The mechanism involves early afterdepolarizations, which is a form of triggered activity. It may complicate the use of type IA and III antiarrhythmic agents, especially if hypokalemia is present. Other medications that can contribute to torsades are metoclopramide, droperidol (for nausea), and high‐dose haloperidol (>35 mg/day) used for agitation in the ICU.417
- **c.** If the patient has a VVI or DDD pacemaker, the use of electrocautery during surgery can inactivate the sensing circuit, converting it to the VOO mode. This may result in bizarre‐appearing arrhythmias and may trigger VF. These pacemakers must be evaluated upon arrival in the ICU and reprogrammed if necessary.418
- **2. Diagnosis.** See Figures 11.37–11.40. An arrhythmia commonly confused with VT is AF with a rate‐dependent conduction block (aberrancy) that produces a wide QRS complex. This should be distinguished by its irregularity, although it may be difficult to detect at fast heart rates.
- **3. Evaluation and treatment** depend on the status of LV function, the nature of the arrhythmia (nonsustained vs. sustained, monomorphic vs. polymorphic VT), and whether the VT is inducible.419
  - **a.** Any potential triggering factors should be identified and managed. These include acid–base and electrolyte abnormalities, intracardiac catheters, myocardial ischemia or infarction, HF, and potentially proarrhythmic medications.

**Figure 11.40 •** Torsades de pointes on monitor lead. Note how the QRS complex appears to twist around the isoelectric baseline. Torsades usually has a pause‐dependent onset initiated by a premature ventricular complex discharging at the end of a T wave, usually associated with a long QT interval.

- **b.** NSVT with preserved LV function has a favorable prognosis. Although lidocaine or amiodarone may be considered when this rhythm develops, β‐blockers alone should suffice if evaluation reveals an EF >35%.420
- **c.** NSVT in patients with depressed LV function may be associated with a poor prognosis without treatment. Extrapolating from the MADIT and MUSTT trials, an electrophysiology study and ICD placement should be considered if NSVT develops after surgery in these patients.
- **d.** Sustained VT occurring without hemodynamic compromise can be managed by:

- **i.** Ventricular overdrive pacing to terminate the reentry circuit
- **ii.** Cardioversion if VT persists or hemodynamic compromise develops
- **iii.** Amiodarone 150 mg over 15 minutes, then 1 mg/min (60 mg/h) × 6 hours, then 0.5 mg/min (30 mg/h) × 18 hours
- **e.** Any patient developing **VF or sustained VT that is pulseless or associated with hemodynamic instability** requires immediate defibrillation per ACLS protocol (see pages 591–595). If unsuccessful, emergency resternotomy and open‐chest massage are indicated.
- **f.** Electrophysiologic evaluation is essential for patients with sustained VT and impaired ventricular function to improve the long‐term prognosis. In general, ICD placement can be justified in any patient with an EF <35%, using a LifeVest device upon hospital discharge if one wants to await the 90‐day moratorium after revascularization recommended in the ICD trials.419
  - **i. Monomorphic VT** is inducible in 80% of patients with spontaneous VT and is usually associated with a remote infarct and an arrhythmogenic substrate causing a reentry mechanism. This usually requires antiarrhythmic therapy (usually amiodarone) as well as the placement of an ICD.
  - **ii. Polymorphic VT** is usually associated with an MI, ischemia, or reperfusion, and should prompt further evaluation for ongoing ischemia. This may involve coronary arteriography to identify potential graft occlusion or an anastomotic stenosis, which may be a correctable problem. It is often transient and therapy must be individualized.

#### **g. Torsades de pointes**<sup>421</sup>

- **i.** Cardiovert immediately for hemodynamic compromise or prolonged episodes (usually because VF is suspected to be present).
- **ii.** Administer potassium chloride, unless hyperkalemia is present, to shorten the QT interval.
- **iii.** Ventricular pace at 90–100 beats/min or start an isoproterenol infusion at 1–4 μg/min.422 This will shorten the action potential to prevent early afterdepolarizations and triggered activity.
- **iv.** Magnesium 1–2 g and β‐blockers may eliminate triggered activity to prevent recurrence, but do not shorten the QT interval.

#### **XIII. Antiarrhythmic Medications**

A variety of medications are available for the control of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. A basic understanding of their mechanism of action is critical to the appropriate selection of these drugs for the treatment of various arrhythmias, as noted in the preceding sections. In this section, drugs that may be used in patients undergoing cardiac surgery are presented. The reader is referred to any of the major cardiology textbooks or websites for more detailed information.

**A.** The Vaughan‐Williams classification of antiarrhythmic medications has been updated and modified with further understanding of their mechanisms of action and the development of newer medications (Table 11.16).423,424

**Table 11.17 • Electrophysiologic Properties of Commonly Used** 

CV = conduction velocity; ERP = effective refractory period Many antiarrhythmic medications have properties of several classes of drugs

- **B.** Table 11.17 shows the effects of the various classes of antiarrhythmic drugs on automaticity, conduction velocity (CV), and the effective refractory period (ERP). Some medications have multiple properties (such as amiodarone and sotalol), so they may have additional electrophysiologic effects. The appropriate classes of antiarrhythmic drug that can be selected for the management of the common arrhythmias are as follows:
  - **1.** Alterations in automaticity
    - **a.** Sinus tachycardia (sinus node): class 0, II, IV
    - **b.** Ventricular ectopy (Purkinje and ventricular fibers): class IA, IB, IC, II, III
    - **c.** Digoxin‐toxic ectopy (delayed afterdepolarizations: class IB (phenytoin)
  - **2.** Alterations in conduction velocity and ERP
    - **a.** Conversion of AF (atrium): class IA, IC, II, III. IV
    - **b.** To slow the response to AF (AV node): class II, III, IV, digoxin
    - **c.** Conversion of AVNRT or AVRT: class II, IV, digoxin
    - **d.** Ventricular tachycardia (interrupt reentrant circuits in His‐Purkinje fibers or ventricle): class IA, IB, III

- **C. Note:** the clinical indications listed below for each of the antiarrhythmic medications are those for which there is documented efficacy. US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval has not necessarily been provided for each of these indications.
- **D.** Drugs that may be used in cardiac surgery patients are listed below in order from class 0 to class IV drugs.

#### **E. Ivabradine:** class 0

- **1.** Clinical indications: inappropriate sinus tachycardia; to slow the heart rate in ischemic heart disease if contraindications to ß‐blockers
- **2.** Dose: 2.5–5 mg PO bid
- **3.** Metabolism: >50% hepatic (CYP3A4); contraindicated with use of a CYP3A4 inhibitor (diltiazem, verapamil)
- **4.** Therapeutic level: unknown
- **5.** Hemodynamic effects: none, unless related to a slower heart rate
- **6.** Electrophysiologic effects and contraindications
  - **a.** Direct inhibitory effect on the Na+–K+ inward pacemaker currents that slows the sinus node mechanism without any effect on contractility
  - **b.** May increase risk of AF
  - **c.** Contraindicated in acute decompensated heart failure, hypotension, sick sinus syndrome, SA block, complete heart block, significant bradycardia
- **7.** Noncardiac side effects: sensation of bright lights, headache, dizziness

#### **F. Procainamide:** class IA

- **1.** Clinical indications (used infrequently due to the superiority of amiodarone)

- **b.** PO procainamide is no longer available
- **3.** Metabolism: hepatic to active metabolite *N*‐acetylprocainamide (NAPA) and then excreted by the kidneys
- **4.** Therapeutic level: 4–10 μg/mL of procainamide and 2–8 μg/mL of NAPA

- **c.** Evidence of toxicity
  - **i.** QT prolongation and polymorphic VT
  - **ii.** Myocardial depression
  - **iii.** NAPA may accumulate in patients with heart and renal failure. It has a longer half‐life than procainamide (7 h vs. 4 h) and can lead to cardiac toxicity, including early afterdepolarizations, triggered activity, and ventricular arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes.
  - **iv.** Amiodarone increases procainamide levels, so doses have to be reduced by 20–33%, but preferentially, procainamide should not be used.

  - **a.** 1 mg/kg IV followed by a continuous infusion of 2–4 mg/min (1 g/250 mL mix); a dose of 0.5 mg/kg may be given 15 minutes later to achieve a stable plasma concentration.
  - **b.** A rebolus of 0.5 mg/kg should be given to increase plasma levels if the infusion rate is increased.
- **3.** Metabolism: hepatic; half‐life is 15 minutes after one dose and two hours with constant infusion (often longer with hepatic impairment)

- **4.** Therapeutic level: 1–5 μg/mL
- **5.** Hemodynamic effects: none in the absence of severe LV dysfunction
- **6.** Electrophysiologic effects: benefits are derived from suppression of abnormal automaticity in ventricular fibers
- **7.** Noncardiac side effects: CNS (dizziness, delirium, tremors, seizures), GI (nausea)

#### **I. Propafenone:** class IC

- **1.** Clinical indication: conversion of AF
- **2.** Doses

- **5.** Hemodynamic effects: negative inotrope and generally contraindicated in patients with structural heart disease and LV dysfunction
- **6.** Electrophysiologic effects
  - **a.** Slows conduction in the atria (prolongs PR interval), AV node (can produce AV block), His‐Purkinje system, and ventricle (widens the QRS), and prolongs atrial refractoriness
  - **b.** Has some β‐blocker activity and can produce AV block and sinus node depression
  - **c.** Proarrhythmic effects are noted in 5% of patients
  - **d.** Doubles the digoxin level; warfarin dose should be decreased

#### **6.** Electrophysiologic effects

- **a.** Prolongs PR and QRS intervals, QT prolongation; prolonging AV conduction; can slow the atrial flutter rate but cause 1:1 AV conduction, necessitating use of an AV nodal blocking drug (ß‐blocker, digoxin)
- **b.** Blocks inward sodium and potassium channels
- **c.** Proarrhythmic even without QT prolongation
- **d.** Although generally not recommended to use a β‐blocker with flecainide to avoid bradycardia, its use with metoprolol in selected patients has been shown to reduce AF recurrence.425
- **7.** Noncardiac side effects: dizziness, tremors, blurred vision, headache, shortness of breath, fatigue, nausea

#### **K. Ranolazine:** class ID

- **1.** Clinical indications: prevention/treatment of AF; primarily used in ischemic heart disease
- **2.** Dose: 500–1000 mg PO preoperatively, then 1 g PO bid × 7 days
- **3.** Metabolism: hepatic by the CYP3A enzyme; dosage should be reduced when drugs that inhibit CYP3A are used (diltiazem, verapamil)
- **4.** Therapeutic level: unknown
- **5.** Hemodynamic effects: reduces intracellular calcium levels and myocardial wall tension, reducing myocardial oxygen demand and reducing ischemia
- **6.** Electrophysiologic effects
  - **a.** Blocks the inward sodium and potassium currents; this prevents calcium overload, which stabilizes membranes and reduces excitability; it also increases the atrial effective refractory period and atrial conduction velocity.426
  - **b.** Slows the SA node, prolongs action potential duration, and prolongs the QT interval
- **7.** Noncardiac side effects: dizziness, constipation, nausea, headache; contraindicated with liver disease

#### **L. β‐adrenergic blockers:** class IIA

  - **a.** Prevention/treatment of postoperative of AF/flutter
  - **b.** Sinus tachycardia
  - **c.** Ventricular arrhythmias associated with digoxin toxicity, myocardial ischemia, or QT prolongation
  - **d.** AVNRT and reciprocating tachycardias in WPW syndrome

#### **2.** Doses

  - **i.** IV: 5 mg q5 min for three doses
  - **ii.** PO: 25–100 mg q12h
- **b.** Atenolol: 25–100 mg PO qd

- **5.** Electrophysiologic effects
  - **a.** Reduces automaticity at all levels, slowing the heart rate
  - **b.** Decreases AV conduction (increases AV node refractoriness) and can cause heart block
- **6.** Noncardiac side effects: bronchospasm (less with the cardioselective β‐blockers atenolol and metoprolol), fatigue, diarrhea, impotence, depression, claudication

#### **M. Adenosine:** class IIE

- **1.** Clinical indication: paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias with AV nodal reentry (AVNRT or AVRT)
- **2.** Dose: 6 mg rapid IV injection through a peripheral line followed by a saline flush; a second dose of 12 mg may be given two minutes later if necessary.
- **3.** Metabolism: rapidly degrades in blood, with a half‐life of less than 10 seconds
- **4.** Electrophysiologic effects: negative effects on SA and AV nodes; can produce asystole and transient high‐grade AV block; the latter effect can unmask atrial activity to differentiate the causes of narrow and wide complex tachycardias.
- **5.** Side effects: flushing, dyspnea, or chest pressure of very brief duration

#### **N. Amiodarone:** class III

- **1.** Clinical indications
  - **a.** Prevention/conversion of postoperative AF
  - **b.** Pulseless VT/VF (first choice to facilitate defibrillation success)
  - **c.** Sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias

#### **2.** Doses

- **a.** PO: 400 mg tid, weaned down to 200 mg qd over several weeks (onset of action takes several days); 10 g should be given before reducing to the lower dose.
- **b.** IV: 150 mg over 15–30 min (300 mg during cardiac arrest), then 1 mg/min × 6 h, 0.5 mg/min × 18 h, then 1 g/day. Onset of action occurs within several hours, but serum levels fall within 30 minutes after infusion is stopped. Repeat bolus doses of 150 mg can be given over 30 min for recurrent AF.
- **3.** Metabolism: hepatic (half‐life of 58 days) and clinical effect dissipates after three months.
- **4.** Therapeutic level: 1.0–2.5 μg/mL
- **5.** Hemodynamic effects: β‐blocker (class II); coronary and peripheral vasodilator
- **6.** Electrophysiologic effects
  - **a.** Has class I, II, and IV properties as well
  - **b.** Initial effects of IV infusion are prolongation of AV conduction and refractoriness, to some degree related to class II (β‐blocking) and class IV (calcium channel blocking) effects. This accounts for its early benefit in slowing the ventricular response to AF. With the initial infusion, there is less effective

- prolongation of repolarization in the atria and ventricles. It also slows the sinus rate, so it may produce bradycardia and heart block.
- **c.** Prolongs the QT interval but rarely causes ventricular arrhythmias; lengthens the PR interval, and may increase the QRS duration
- **7.** Reduces clearance (and therefore increases serum levels) of drugs metabolized by the liver. These include **digoxin, procainamide, and warfarin**. Doses of these medications should be reduced by about one‐half. Due to the increased risk of rhabdomyolysis, no more than 20 mg of **simvastatin** should be given to patients on amiodarone.
- **8.** Noncardiac side effects are noted in more than 50% of patients, especially during chronic therapy. Minor problems include corneal microdeposits, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), photosensitivity, and alteration in thyroid function.427
- **9.** Baseline and follow‐up LFTs and thyroid function tests should be performed. Peripheral neuropathy and myopathy may produce an unstable gait. The most serious complication is pulmonary toxicity, which is more common in patients on high‐dose chronic amiodarone therapy, especially with abnormal chest x‐rays or pulmonary function tests prior to surgery. Acute pulmonary toxicity, which probably represents a hypersensitivity reaction, can also occur but is rare.339 Baseline PFTs are also recommended for any patient in whom amiodarone will be used for more than one month.

#### **O. Dofetilide:** class III

- **1.** Clinical indications: conversion of AF/flutter
- **2.** Dose: 125–500 μg PO bid (based on renal function and QT prolongation): first five doses must be given in hospital with an ECG obtained 2–3 hours after each dose to monitor for QT prolongation. An IV preparation has been used in numerous studies, but is not available in the USA.
- **3.** Metabolism: 50% renal, 50% hepatic
- **4.** Therapeutic level: unknown
- **5.** Hemodynamic effects: no negative inotropic effects, so can be used with structural heart disease
- **6.** Electrophysiologic effects
  - **a.** Slightly decreases the sinus rate, but no effect on AV conduction
  - **b.** Proarrhythmic effect from QT prolongation, so contraindicated if QT interval >440 ms (or if creatinine clearance <20 mL/min); torsades occurs in 4%
  - **c.** Has drug interaction with verapamil, which contraindicates its use
  - **d.** All class I or III antiarrhythmic medications should be stopped for three half‐lives before it is given.
  - **e.** Amiodarone must be stopped for three months (or a level <0.3 mg/L) before it is given.

#### **P. Sotalol:** class III

- **1.** Clinical indications
  - **a.** Prevention/treatment of postoperative AF
  - **b.** Suppression of ventricular tachyarrhythmias

#### **2.** Doses

- **a.** 80–160 mg PO bid
- **b.** 75–150 mg IV bid (administered over five hours)
- **3.** Metabolism: excreted unchanged in the urine (so give once daily if GFR <60 mL/min and contraindicated if GFR <40 mL/min)
- **4.** Hemodynamic effects: causes bradycardia; negative inotropic effect can cause hypotension, fatigue, and HF.
- **5.** Electrophysiologic effects
  - **a.** Prolongs atrial and ventricular action potential and refractory periods (slows SA node, increases AV node refractoriness); QT prolongation
  - **b.** Exhibits class II (β-blocking) and class III effects
  - **c.** Produces torsades de pointes or proarrhythmic effects in about 4% of patients. Torsades de pointes is dose‐related and predictable from the QT interval (avoid if QT >500 ms).
- **6.** Noncardiac side effects: fatigue, dyspnea, dizziness, heart failure exacerbation, nausea, and vomiting

#### **Q. Ibutilide:** class III

- **1.** Clinical indication: conversion of recent‐onset AF/flutter
- **2.** Dose: 1 mg IV over 10 minutes (0.01 mg/kg if <60 kg) with a second dose if no response
- **3.** Metabolism: hepatic
- **4.** Therapeutic level: unknown
- **5.** Hemodynamic effects: no significant hemodynamic effects, but not recommended if severely depressed LV function
- **6.** Electrophysiologic effects
  - **a.** Increases refractoriness of atrium, AV node, and ventricle
  - **b.** Dose‐related prolongation of the QT interval (avoid if the QT interval exceeds 440 ms). QT prolongation may contribute to torsades de pointes, but sustained polymorphic VT may occur even in the absence of a prolonged QT interval.
  - **c.** Monomorphic or polymorphic VT (sustained or nonsustained) is noted in about 10% of patients; careful monitoring in the ICU is essential for four hours after an administered dose (half‐life is six hours) or until the QT interval has returned to baseline.
- **7.** Noncardiac side effects: headache, nausea

#### **R. Vernakalant:** class III

- **1.** Clinical indications: conversion of AF
- **2.** Doses: 3 mg/kg infused over 10 minutes with a subsequent 2 mg/kg infusion over 10 minutes if AF is still present after 15 minutes. Not approved for use in the USA as of mid‐2020.
- **3.** Metabolism: hepatic > renal; half‐life of 3–4 hours
- **4.** Therapeutic level: unknown
- **5.** Hemodynamic effects: none

#### **6.** Electrophysiologic effects

- **a.** Blocks atrial sodium channels and the cardiac transient outward potassium current influencing atrial repolarization, such that it is beneficial at very fast heart rates.
- **b.** May cause bradycardia, hypotension, torsades de pointes and other ventricular arrhythmias.
- **7.** Noncardiac side effects: altered taste, sneezing, paresthesia, nausea and pruritus

#### **S. Calcium channel blockers** (verapamil and diltiazem): class IV

- **1.** Clinical indications
  - **a.** Control rapid ventricular response to AF/flutter
  - **b.** Treat supraventricular tachycardias including AVNRT, reciprocating tachycardias of WPW syndrome (AVRT), and multifocal atrial tachycardia; contraindicated for AF in WPW syndrome
  - **c.** Ischemic ventricular ectopy

#### **2.** Doses

- **a.** Diltiazem
  - **i.** IV: 0.25 mg/kg IV bolus over two minutes, with a repeat bolus of 0.35 mg/kg 15 minutes later; then a continuous infusion of 10–15 mg/h (100 mg/100 mL mix)
  - **ii.** PO: 30–90 mg q8h (or 180–360 mg qd of long‐acting preparation)
- **b.** Verapamil
  - **i.** 5–10 mg (0.075–0.15 mg/kg) IV push over two minutes, followed 30 minutes later by an additional 10 mg (0.15 mg/kg), then start an infusion of 2–5 μg/kg/min (120 mg/250 mL mix)
  - **ii.** PO: 80–160 mg q8h
- **3.** Metabolism: hepatic
- **4.** Therapeutic level: 0.1–0.15 μg/mL (verapamil)
- **5.** Hemodynamic effects: negative inotropes and vasodilators (verapamil more than diltiazem); cause hypotension and can worsen HF
- **6.** Electrophysiologic effects
  - **a.** Slows sinus rate, prolongs PR interval, slows AV conduction; can precipitate bradycardia, asystole, or heart block when used concomitantly with IV β‐blockers.
  - **b.** Verapamil reduces clearance of digoxin and increases the digoxin level by about 35%.
- **7.** Noncardiac side effects: GI (constipation, nausea), headache, dizziness, elevation in LFTs

#### **T. Digoxin**

- **1.** Clinical indications
  - **a.** Slowing ventricular response to AF/flutter. Since it is much less effective than CCBs or β‐blockers and has been shown to increase mortality, it no longer has much of a role in the postoperative cardiac surgical patient.428
  - **b.** Prevention of AVNRT

#### **2.** Doses

- **a.** IV: 0.5 mg, then 0.25 mg q4–6h to total dose of 1.0–1.25 mg, then 0.125 mg qd
- **b.** PO: 0.5 mg, then 0.25 mg q4–6h to total dose of 1.25 mg, then 0.25 mg qd (dosing without a load will take 7–10 days to reach a steady‐state level).
  - **i.** Maintenance dose depends on serum level and therapeutic effect.
  - **ii.** Dose is 0.125 mg qd for patients in renal failure.
  - **iii.** IV dose is two‐thirds of the PO dose.
- **3.** Metabolism: hepatic (but renal failure prolongs its half‐life and decreases its distribution)
- **4.** Therapeutic level: 1–2 ng/mL (drawn not less than six hours after an oral dose or four hours after an IV dose)
  - **a.** Serum levels are increased by medications that reduce its clearance or volume of distribution; thus digoxin dosing should be reduced accordingly.
  - **b. Levels are increased by amiodarone** (by 70–100%) and verapamil (by 35%)
- **5.** Hemodynamic effects: slight inotropic effect, peripheral vasodilation
- **6.** Electrophysiologic effects: enhances vagolytic activity which reduces sinus node automaticity (slows the heart rate) and prolongs AV conduction and refractoriness (controls ventricular response to AF)
- **7.** Noncardiac side effects: GI (anorexia, nausea, vomiting), CNS (headache, fatigue, confusion, seizures), visual symptoms

#### **U. Comments on digoxin toxicity**<sup>429</sup>

- **1.** Digoxin is used primarily to slow the ventricular response to AF/flutter by virtue of its vagotonic effect (at low dose) and a direct effect (high dose) on the AV node. It is less effective than other medications in slowing the ventricular response to AF in the early postoperative period when a high adrenergic state is present. Thus, it is not the drug of choice for acute rate control. However, it can provide additional rate control, especially when AF is persistent.
- **2.** Aggressive digitalization for rapid AF is usually not successful in achieving rate control and can lead to digoxin toxicity for a number of reasons in the early postoperative period.
  - **a.** There is increased sensitivity to digoxin related to augmented sympathetic tone, myocardial ischemia, electrolyte imbalance (hyper‐ or hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, hypomagnesemia), acid–base imbalance, or use of vasoactive or antiarrhythmic drugs (verapamil).
  - **b.** Large doses need to be given to achieve effect because digoxin's vagotonic effects are offset by increased sympathetic tone. IV doses are usually given to provide 1.25 mg within the first 24 hours, but subsequent IV doses should be two‐thirds of the oral doses to avoid toxicity.
  - **c.** The volume of distribution is less in many elderly patients with decreased lean body mass.
  - **d.** Hypokalemia from postoperative diuresis and hypomagnesemia predispose to digoxin toxicity.

- **e.** Renal excretion may be impaired in patients with chronic kidney disease. Elderly patients have reduced GFRs and excrete digoxin less efficiently.
- **3.** Digoxin toxicity should be considered in any patient receiving digoxin who develops a change in rhythm. These include, in decreasing order of frequency:
  - **a.** Premature ventricular complexes (multiform and bigeminy)
  - **b.** Nonparoxysmal AV junctional tachycardia
  - **c.** AV block: first‐degree or Wenckebach second‐degree block
  - **d.** Paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with 2:1 block
  - **e.** Ventricular tachycardia (especially bidirectional VT at a rate of 140–180 bpm)
  - **f.** Sinus bradycardia or SA block
- **4.** Digoxin toxicity in a patient with AF is usually manifested by:
  - **a.** Slow ventricular response (<50 bpm)
  - **b.** AV dissociation with AV junctional escape or accelerated junctional rhythm. Regularization of the ventricular rate in the presence of AF should always raise concern about the development of complete heart block with a junctional escape rhythm.

#### **5. Treatment**

- **a.** Bradyarrhythmias are treated by atrial, AV, or ventricular pacing, depending on the underlying atrial rhythm and the status of AV conduction. Atropine can be used, but isoproterenol should be avoided because it may induce malignant ventricular arrhythmias.
- **b.** Tachyarrhythmias
  - **i.** Potassium chloride, except in the presence of high‐grade AV block, because hyperkalemia can potentiate the depressant effect of digoxin on AV conduction.
  - **ii.** Lidocaine in usual doses
  - **iii.** Phenytoin (Dilantin), 100 mg IV every five minutes to a maximum of 1 g, then 100–200 mg PO q8h
- **c.** Digibind (digoxin immune Fab [Ovine]) 400 mg (10 vials) IV, which may be repeated after several hours, can be used for life‐threatening digoxin toxicity.
- **6.** Special concerns
  - **a.** Digoxin toxicity decreases the threshold for postcardioversion malignant arrhythmias. This may be exacerbated when hypokalemia or hypercalcemia is present. Use of lidocaine, phenytoin, or lower energy levels should be considered.
  - **b.** Dialysis is ineffective in removing digoxin. Its half‐life is 36–48 hours.

## **12** Fluid Management, Renal, Metabolic, and Endocrine Problems

Perioperative renal dysfunction is a major determinant of both operative and long‐term mortality following cardiac surgery.1–3 Even patients with mild renal dysfunction prior to surgery are more likely to experience acute kidney injury (AKI) afterwards, with compromised short‐ and long‐term outcomes.4,5 Therefore, it is essential to identify patients at high risk for developing postoperative AKI who may benefit from specific interventions aimed at optimizing renal function. Although many risk factors for AKI cannot be modified, measures can be taken preoperatively, during cardiac catheterization procedures, during surgery, and in the postoperative period to minimize the risk of developing AKI.6 If it does develop, careful medical management and, if necessary, early aggressive use of renal replacement therapy may reduce the high mortality associated with postoperative AKI.

#### **I. Body Water Distribution**

An understanding of body water distribution is important when administering fluids to patients after open‐heart surgery. Approximately 60% of the body's weight (50% in women) is water, with two‐thirds of this residing in the intracellular space and one‐third in the extracellular space. In the latter, two‐thirds is in the interstitial space (the so‐called third space), and one‐third constitutes the intravascular volume.

- **A.** Water moves freely among all three compartments and shifts so as to normalize serum osmolality (which generally reflects the serum sodium concentration).
- **B.** Sodium moves freely between the intravascular and interstitial spaces but does not move passively into cells. Therefore, if a patient receives a hypotonic sodium load (e.g. 0.45% saline) which would lower the serum osmolality and sodium concentration, water will move from the extracellular space into the intracellular space to normalize these values. The presence of **a low serum sodium concentration in the postoperative patient usually indicates total body water overload**.
- **C.** Starling's law governs the influence of hydrostatic and oncotic pressures on fluid shifts. The primary determinant of oncotic pressure is serum protein, which remains within the intravascular space. Elevated hydrostatic pressure (e.g. increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, PCWP) or lower intravascular colloid oncotic pressure (e.g. very low serum albumin, usually <2 g/dL) will shift fluid from the intravascular space into the interstitial space, contributing to lung and tissue edema. Conversely, raising the intravascular oncotic pressure with colloid (e.g. 25% albumin) in patients with hypoalbuminemia will tend to draw fluid from the lung interstitium back into the intravascular space.

- **D.** It should be kept in mind that Starling's law describes fluid shifts in the absence of abnormalities in membrane integrity. However, extracorporeal circulation is associated with a systemic inflammatory response, characterized by increased membrane permeability and a transient capillary leak. When this leak is present, administered fluid will shift more readily into the interstitial space. Clinically, one may note impaired oxygenation and decreased pulmonary compliance (higher peak pressures on the ventilator) associated with increased extravascular lung water. This can produce the picture of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Expansion of the interstitial space may also contribute to cerebral edema (mental obtundation), hepatic congestion (jaundice), and splanchnic congestion (ileus).
- **E.** Because of the capillary leak associated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), patients will be total body fluid overloaded, but can have low filling pressures with compromised cardiac output. Thus, until the capillary leak ceases, which is generally within 12 hours of surgery, fluid administration, whether colloid or crystalloid, will be required to optimize preload to maintain the cardiac output.

#### **II. Effects of CPB and Off‐Pump Surgery on Renal Function**

- **A.** The influence of CPB on renal function is multifactorial.7–11 It involves nonpulsatile perfusion with hemodilution and variable degrees of hypothermia. A number of factors can adversely affect renal vasomotor tone, triggering a reduction in renal blood flow (RBF). The longer the duration of CPB, the more protracted the exposure to these adverse elements, increasing the risk of AKI.
  - **1.** CPB increases levels of hormones (endogenous catecholamines, vasopressin) and induces the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone cascade, altering vascular tone, RBF, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), filtration fraction, and electrolyte balance.
  - **2.** Hemodilution reduces the hematocrit (HCT) and oxygen‐carrying capacity of blood.12–15
  - **3.** Vasodilation may also lower blood pressure during CPB, increasing fluid requirements and the need for vasopressor support to maintain an adequate mean arterial pressure. ACE inhibitors and ARBs may attenuate the effects of vasoconstrictors such as norepinephrine, so stopping them just prior to surgery may reduce the risk of hypotension during bypass and arguably will lower the risk of AKI.16–21 Judicious use of other vasodilators during surgery (propofol, narcotics, inhalational anesthetics, nitroglycerin) may minimize hypotension during surgery as well.
  - **4.** Extracorporeal circulation evokes an inflammatory response with activation of complement and neutrophils, release of cytokines, and production of oxygen free radicals ("oxidative stress").
  - **5.** Aortic cannulation and clamping can generate atheroembolism.
  - **6.** Low‐grade hemolysis from CPB may cause release of iron leading to oxidation from reactive oxygen species.22
- **B.** CPB is associated with an increase in virtually all kidney‐specific proteins that are markers for tubular damage.23 Some of these, such as neutrophil gelatinase‐associated lipocalin (NGAL), cystatin C, Kidney Injury Molecule‐1 (KIM‐1), and interleukin‐18 (IL‐18), have been shown to be early biomarkers of AKI that correlate with the severity and duration of AKI.24–26 However, very few centers routinely evaluate renal function other than by serum creatinine (SCr) levels, and in the vast majority of

cases, there is little significance to subtle changes in tubular function as long as the kidneys produce a satisfactory urine output with or without diuretics with minimal change in the SCr.

- **C.** The potential benefit of avoiding CPB by performing off‐pump coronary artery surgery (OPCAB) to reduce the risk of postoperative AKI is controversial.
  - **1.** Some studies have reported a reduction in AKI with OPCAB, but with no clear impact on the requirement for renal replacement therapy.27–31 Others suggest that OPCAB reduces the incidence of postoperative AKI only in patients with normal renal function, but not those with preexisting chronic kidney disease (CKD).32,33
  - **2.** In theory, avoidance of CPB might preserve RBF and glomerular function better by maintaining a higher systemic pressure. Tubular epithelial function may be better preserved because of decreased complement activation and a lessened inflammatory response.34 However, off‐pump surgery is associated with significant fluid administration, use of comparable anesthetic and vasoactive medications, cytokine release that can damage proximal tubules, and alterations in perfusion pressure (lower systemic pressures with elevated venous pressures during exposure of the posterior heart and lower systemic pressures during construction of proximal anastomoses), all of which can adversely affect renal function.
  - **3.** Because postoperative renal dysfunction is related more to preexisting renal disease or significant hemodynamic alterations than to the inflammatory response, particular attention to fluid and hemodynamic management remains paramount no matter whether CPB is used or not.

#### **III. Routine Fluid Management in the Early Postoperative Period**

- **A.** Hemodilution on CPB produces a state of total body sodium and water overload, expanding the body weight by about 5% (estimated at 800 mL/m2 /h, but quite variable in amount). Cardiac filling pressures usually do not reflect this state of fluid overload because of a capillary leak from the systemic inflammatory response, decreased plasma colloid osmotic pressure, impaired myocardial relaxation (diastolic dysfunction) from ischemia/reperfusion after cardioplegic arrest, and vasodilation.
  - **1.** Low filling pressures are consistent with hypovolemia despite the presence of body water overload, and additional fluid administration may be necessary to maintain satisfactory hemodynamics.
  - **2.** High filling pressures may suggest hypervolemia or ventricular dysfunction, but they may also be noted in the presence of hypovolemia, especially in patients with diastolic dysfunction or marked vasoconstriction, and additional fluid administration may be indicated in that situation. Use of Swan‐Ganz monitoring (and its correlation with echocardiographic findings) is helpful in providing a scientific basis for fluid management after surgery, especially in patients with significant right or left ventricular dysfunction or after very complex operations with long durations of CPB, although it may not be necessary in low‐risk patients.
- **B.** Giving fluids to optimize preload and cardiac output in the early postoperative period may be required whether urine output is adequate or marginal (<1 mL/kg/h). During the first 4–6 hours after surgery, cardiac output is often depressed, and the achievement of satisfactory hemodynamics to optimize renal perfusion is dependent

- on both preload and inotropic support. Thus, fluid must invariably be administered to maintain intravascular volume and cardiac hemodynamics at the expense of expansion of the interstitial space. It should be noted that early extubation is helpful in reducing fluid requirements because it eliminates the adverse effects of positive‐ pressure ventilation on venous return and ventricular function.
- **C.** It can be difficult to decide which fluid to administer to maintain filling pressures. Clearly, any fluid infused during a period of altered capillary membrane integrity will expand the interstitial space, but those that can more effectively expand the intravascular space while minimizing expansion of the interstitial space are preferable. Nonetheless, clinical outcomes are fairly comparable with colloid or crystalloid administration in critically ill patients, and this most likely holds true in most cardiac surgery patients who exhibit a systemic inflammatory response.35,36 Most patients have enough pulmonary reserve to tolerate the volume overload until it can be diuresed, but those developing AKI with oliguria will have a more tenuous course.
  - **1.** Blood and colloids are superior to hypotonic or even isotonic crystalloid solutions in expanding the intravascular volume.37,38 Although a rapid infusion of crystalloid is effective in increasing intravascular volume acutely, this benefit is transient.39 For example, in the absence of a capillary leak, after a five‐minute infusion of one liter of lactated Ringer's, the intravascular volume expands approximately 630 mL. Yet, due to rapid redistribution into the interstitial space, barely 20% of this volume is retained within the intravascular compartment after an hour. Similarly, only 25% (250 mL) of one liter of infused normal saline (NS) is retained in the intravascular compartment after one hour. In contrast, after a five‐minute infusion of one liter of 6% hetastarch, the intravascular volume expands by 1123 mL with more long‐ lasting effects. Five percent albumin can expand the plasma volume five times more than a comparable volume of normal saline.40
  - **2.** In general, it is reasonable to initially administer a moderate amount of inexpensive crystalloid (up to a liter) if the patient is oxygenating well. Infusing greater amounts may contribute to tissue edema, commonly impairing oxygenation. Colloids should be selected if additional volume is required, although at some centers, they are given first. The selection of colloid should be based on the patient's pulmonary and renal function and the extent of mediastinal bleeding.
    - **a. Albumin (5%)** provides excellent volume expansion (approximately 400 mL retained per 500 mL bottle administered), has a half‐life of 16 hours, and leaves the bloodstream at a rate of about 5–8 g/h. It has primarily dilutional effects on clotting parameters and preserves coagulation better than the hydroxyethyl starches.41 It has oxygen free‐radical scavenging and anti‐inflammatory properties, which may exert protective effects on the kidney. However, it will leak into the interstitial space due to the capillary leak and may cause movement of fluid out of the intracellular space. Furthermore, 5% albumin is a saline‐based colloid with a high chloride load, and studies suggest that use of albumin increases the risk of AKI in a dose‐dependent manner after cardiac surgery.42 Therefore, although some groups use 5% albumin as the preferential fluid after surgery, it can be inferred that large volumes of 5% albumin must be used with caution.
    - **b. Hydroxyethyl starch (HES)** preparations are nonprotein colloid volume expanders that provide excellent volume expansion in excess of the volume infused.

- **i.** The high‐molecular‐weight solutions, Hespan (6% hetastarch in saline) and Hextend (6% hetastarch in balanced electrolyte solution), maintain volume expansion for about 24 hours, but may cause renal dysfunction and produce a coagulopathy by binding to the von Willebrand/factor VIII complex, causing platelet dysfunction, and also by causing fibrinolysis.43 This risk may be slightly less with Hextend.44–46 Thus, despite a recommended maximum infusion of 20 mL/kg, their use has been discouraged in the early postoperative period and should absolutely be avoided in the bleeding patient.37,38,43
- **ii.** The low‐molecular‐weight solutions include pentastarch (Pentaspan [DuPont Pharma]), tetrastarch in 0.9% saline (Volvuven), and tetrastarch in a balanced electrolyte solutions (Volulyte [Fresenius Kabi, Canada]). These also produce excellent volume expansion, but for shorter periods of time (18–24 hours for pentastarch, six hours for tetrastarch). The risks of renal dysfunction and coagulopathy may be slightly less than with the high‐ molecular‐weight solutions, but they are still present.47 Therefore, these products are also not recommended in the bleeding patient. Otherwise, infusion volumes should be limited to 28 mL/kg (2 L/day maximum) for pentastarch and 50 mL/kg for tetrastarch (3.5 L/day maximum).
- **c. Note:** there is concern that saline‐based solutions (0.9% saline, 5% albumin, Hespan, Pentaspan and tetrastarch in saline) provide a high chloride load that, given in high doses, can produce progressive renal vasoconstriction, a decrease in GFR, and a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Studies show that use of chloride‐restricted solutions, such as lactated Ringer's, tetrastarch in balanced electrolyte solution, and Plasma‐Lyte, is associated with a lower risk of AKI.48–51 The development of a metabolic acidosis related to the use of high chloride solutions might raise the specter of poor tissue perfusion, prompting unnecessary interventions.
- **d.** Hypertonic solutions are effective in augmenting intravascular volume by extracting fluid from the interstitial and intracellular spaces. They may reduce the amount of fluid required to maintain intravascular volume when there is total body fluid overload. **Twenty‐five percent albumin** can increase the intravascular volume by 450 mL for every 100 mL administered. Other solutions are available that may increase intravascular volume without providing excessive free water, but they are usually used only in the setting of hyponatremia. **Hypertonic saline** (3%) can produce neurologic problems if it causes acute hypernatremia. Studies from Europe have shown that hypertonic saline (7.5%) can produce renal vasodilation, increase GFR, and produce a diuresis.52 It should be noted that use of these hypertonic colloids can produce hyperoncotic renal failure in dehydrated patients because the glomerular filtration of hyperoncotic colloid molecules may cause hyperviscosity and stasis of tubular flow, resulting in tubular obstruction. This effect may also be one of the mechanisms of high‐ molecular‐weight HES‐induced renal dysfunction.
- **D.** An ideal solution for volume expansion would be a commercially available hemoglobin (Hb) based oxygen carrier. Thromboelastographic studies of Oxyvita, a polymerized bovine‐Hb‐based oxygen carrier, have shown similar effects on the coagulation profile as Hespan at doses up to 23 mL/kg, but with minimal coagulopathic

- effects at the recommended dose of 2–3 mL/kg.53 These products enhance fibrinolysis and must be avoided in the bleeding patient.54
- **E.** It cannot be overemphasized that the objective of postoperative fluid management is to maintain **adequate** intravascular volume to ensure **satisfactory** cardiac output and tissue perfusion. Administration of excessive volume to maintain high filling pressures and the highest possible cardiac output will increase extravascular water, which will be primarily manifested by pulmonary edema that will delay extubation. The amount of fluid to administer can be confusing in patients with diastolic dysfunction who already have high filling pressures, but often a marginal cardiac output. In addition, the hemodilution caused by intravascular volume expansion may decrease the hematocrit and also reduce the level of clotting factors, possibly precipitating bleeding and necessitating homologous blood or blood product transfusions.
- **F.** When cardiac function is satisfactory, but there is an ongoing volume requirement to maintain filling pressures or blood pressure, often from a combination of the capillary leak, vasodilation, and an excellent urine output, "flooding" the patient with volume should be resisted. After 1.5–2 L of fluid is given, norepinephrine or vasopressin should be used to maintain filling pressures and improve the systemic blood pressure. Norepinephrine may provide some cardiac support, will improve RBF, and may lower renal vascular resistance by lowering renal sympathetic tone.55,56 Vasopressin (0.01–0.1 units/min) is very effective in restoring the blood pressure to within the renal autoregulatory range (generally a mean pressure >80 mmHg) in the vasodilated "vasoplegic" patient with a good cardiac output.57,58 In conditions of low cardiac output, however, it may cause splanchnic vasoconstriction, inducing bowel ischemia. Phenylephrine should be utilized only when the cardiac output is satisfactory, because it provides a pure α effect on systemic vascular tone, causing renal arteriolar vasoconstriction.
- **G.** If both cardiac output and urine output remain marginal after adequate filling pressures have been achieved, inotropic support must be considered first, with use of vasoconstrictor drugs only if systemic resistance remains low. Use of α‐agents at substantial doses is always of concern with a marginal cardiac output because they may produce renal vasoconstriction and compromise renal function.
- **H.** Generally, diuretics are best avoided in the first six hours after surgery unless pulmonary edema with borderline oxygenation is present. They may be beneficial if the pulmonary edema is cardiogenic in origin, but noncardiogenic pulmonary edema may be present even if the patient is hypovolemic. When the patient has achieved a stable core temperature and the capillary leak has ceased, usually after the first 6–12 hours, filling pressures will stabilize or rise with little fluid administration. By this time, myocardial function has usually recovered, inotropic support can be gradually withdrawn, and the patient can be extubated. Diuresis may then be initiated to excrete the excess salt and water administered during CPB and the early postoperative period. Patients who have undergone operations that require long periods of CPB (usually >3 hours) or who have persistent low output syndromes may experience a longer period of "capillary leak" that requires further fluid administration to maintain filling pressures. In either circumstance, if the patient has low filling pressures despite fluid overload, initiation of diuretics should probably be delayed.

- **I. Diuresis** can be augmented most efficiently by the use of loop diuretics.59,60
  - **1.** Loop diuretics inhibit sodium reabsorption in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle and increase solute (sodium) presentation to the distal tubules. By inhibiting tubular sodium and chloride reabsorption, they increase natriuresis and diuresis. To a lesser extent, they may also act as renal vasodilators, increasing RBF and GFR, and they may improve medullary oxygenation.
  - **2.** Most patients with preserved renal function respond to furosemide (Lasix) 10–20 mg IV. In the absence of renal insufficiency, furosemide has a half‐life of 1.5–2 hours, and thus it can be repeated every four hours, if necessary. Not infrequently, the diuresis persists after one dose. Some patients with advanced CKD appear to respond better to bumetanide 1–2 mg IV and then may be given torsemide 10–20 mg orally (10–20 mg can be given IV, but this preparation is not available in the USA).
  - **3.** A gentle continuous diuresis may be obtained in patients with significant fluid overload and hemodynamic instability using a 40–60 mg IV bolus dose of furosemide followed by a continuous infusion of 0.1–0.5 mg/kg/h (usually 10–20 mg/h).61 This may decrease the total dosage requirements and usually improves the diuretic response, especially in patients who are diuretic "tolerant". This benefit is also seen in patients with CKD. The addition of a thiazide (chlorothiazide 500 mg IV) is beneficial in overcoming this problem of tolerance, which may be caused by compensatory hypertrophy of the distal nephron segments in response to increased exposure to solute from chronic use of loop diuretics.
  - **4.** Diuretics are continued in IV or oral form until the patient has achieved their preoperative weight. This is a common practice, although most patients with normal renal function will auto‐diuresis several days after surgery in the absence of diuretics. One study did in fact show no clinical benefit to initiating early diuresis in low‐risk patients with normal renal function.62 Another study suggested that not only intraoperative furosemide but also use of any diuretic postoperatively increased the risk of AKI.63
- **J.** "Renal‐dose" dopamine (2–3 μg/kg/min) increases RBF and GFR in patients with normal renal function, resulting in effective diuresis and natriuresis and possibly reducing the need for diuretics. However, dopamine initiated during surgery and continuing afterwards for 24 hours is not renoprotective and, in fact, may cause a deterioration in renal function. This has led to the recommendation that dopamine should not be used in postoperative cardiac surgical patients.64–67
- **K.** Guidelines for the hemodynamic and fluid management of typical postoperative scenarios are presented in Chapter 8.

#### **IV. Identifying Risk for Acute Kidney Injury**

**A.** The risk of developing postoperative AKI is very low when a patient with normal renal function undergoes an uneventful operation and maintains satisfactory postoperative hemodynamics. In contrast, the presence of any degree of preoperative renal dysfunction increases the risk of postoperative AKI and mortality.1–5 Therefore, it is important to identify patients with preoperative renal dysfunction and those with other risk factors for developing postoperative AKI.

**B. Definition of preoperative renal dysfunction.** The staging of CKD should be based on GFR, rather than SCr, as GFR provides a better estimate of renal reserve and the ability of the kidneys to tolerate surgical stress. It also correlates with both in‐hospital mortality and the long‐term prognosis.68,69 SCr may be in the normal range even when there is a greater than 50% reduction in GFR, which reflects the number of functional neurons. The stages of CKD are defined as follows (in mL/min/1.73 m2 )

```
Stage I >90
Stage 2 60–89
Stage 3A 45–59
Stage 3B 30–44
Stage 4 15–29
Stage 5 <15 or on dialysis
```

- **1.** A GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (CKD stages 3–5) represents evidence of significant CKD and is the level below which there is an increased risk of postoperative AKI and increased mortality.1 However, a higher risk of adverse outcomes, including the need for renal replacement therapy and mortality has even been confirmed in patients with "occult" kidney disease (i.e. a low GFR but normal SCr), who account for about 13% of patients with a normal SCr.4,5 In fact, one study showed that patients with a normal GFR but impaired renal functional reserve demonstrated after a high oral protein load are also at risk for postoperative AKI.70
- **2.** A 24‐hour urine collection to precisely measure the creatinine clearance is considered to be no more reliable than an estimate based on formulas using the SCr.
  - **a.** Using the Cockcroft‐Gault equation, the GFR can easily be calculated at the bedside and is indexed to the patient's age and weight. This may be the best GFR equation to predict in‐hospital mortality.68

$$C_{Cr} = \frac{(140 - age) \times wt (kg) \times (0.85 \text{ if female})}{72 \times Scr (mg / dL)}$$

**b.** Other formulas include the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula and the 2009 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD‐EPI) equation which may be more accurate in calculating GFR, especially at higher levels of GFR.71,72 Hospital laboratories utilize one of these equations to provide GFR results routinely.

#### **C. Risk factors for postoperative AKI and predictive models (Table 12.1)3,8–11,73–77**

- **1.** The basic pathophysiology of postoperative AKI involves renal ischemia and other phenomena related to CPB, including inflammation, reperfusion injury, oxidative stress, and hemoglobinuria. Hemodynamic compromise in the pre‐, intra‐, or postoperative period will also heighten the risk of AKI and potentially affect its duration. Thus, more complex procedures requiring longer durations of CPB and the use of vasoactive drugs to support a low cardiac output are the major perioperative factors predisposing to AKI.
- **2.** AKI is usually categorized as prerenal (reduced renal perfusion), renal (intrinsic renal insults), or postrenal (obstructive uropathy). Mechanisms contributing to the first two categories in the perioperative period are noted in Table 12.1. When the

kidneys have sustained an acute preoperative insult, either from a cardiac catheterization or more ominously from decompensated heart failure (HF) or cardiogenic shock from an acute ischemic event, they seem to be particularly sensitive to the abnormal physiology of CPB and to tenuous postcardiotomy hemodynamics. This is especially true in patients with "acute on chronic" renal dysfunction. The BUN and SCr should therefore be allowed to return towards baseline, if possible, before proceeding with surgery.

- **3.** Most predictive models for AKI include similar risk factors, although several additional risk factors, such as a long duration of CPB and recent use of contrast, have been identified in other studies but are not included in many of the risk models.3,75–78 Common risk factors include:
  - **a.** Older age (2.5‐fold increase in risk for each 10‐year increment in one study)79
  - **b.** Pre‐existing comorbidities (CKD, diabetes, hypertension, vascular disease)
  - **c.** Use of preoperative diuretics, nephrotoxic drugs, or medications that interfere with renal vasomotor tone

- **d.** More tenuous hemodynamic status (shock, recent myocardial infarction, preoperative IABP, low EF), reoperations, and urgent or emergent surgery
- **4.** One simple risk model found that four factors were able to predict AKI with great accuracy (age >65, GFR <80 mL/min/m2, cross‐clamp time >50 minutes, and more complex surgery).80
- **5.** In virtually all of the risk models predicting AKI and the need for dialysis, the most significant risk factor is that of preexisting renal dysfunction, and most models use SCr rather than GFR as the marker of CKD.73 Risk models are useful to individualize the risks of AKI and RRT based upon an assessment of multiple contributing risk factors.
  - **a.** Figure 12.1 provides an estimate of the risk of developing severe AKI in patients with occult CKD.81
  - **b.** Figure 12.2 provides a model to predict AKI (defined as SCr >2.0 mg/dL and a 50% increase in SCr) based upon pre‐, intra‐, and postoperative parameters.82
  - **c.** Figures 12.3 and 12.4 provide the Cleveland Clinic and STS risk models for the prediction of RRT after cardiac surgery.83,84
- **6.** These models do not predict operative mortality, which may be related to other contributing factors. For example, patients undergoing urgent or emergent operations of high complexity will have a higher predicted mortality at any level of SCr. It is best to use the STS short‐term risk calculator available online at www.sts.org to incorporate other parameters to determine the risk of AKI and mortality. Generally, mortality risk is greater with increasing SCr levels, correlates with the degree and duration of oliguria,85 and averages about 10% for patients with non‐ dialysis‐dependent CKD.1
- **7.** The development of postoperative AKI is associated with about a fourfold increase in operative mortality.73,86 Although patients already on dialysis have an operative

8. These alarming statistics emphasize the crucial importance of taking any steps possible to minimize renal insults and preserve renal function in the perioperative period, especially in patients at increased risk. The presence of any degree of preoperative renal insufficiency should therefore lead to a search for potentially treatable causes that might lower the risk of AKI postoperatively. Identifying and correcting these contributing factors before surgery and using measures during and after surgery to optimize renal perfusion and tubular function to try to prevent AKI may ameliorate the complications associated with the development of oliguric renal failure. These may include electrolyte abnormalities, pulmonary and cardiac dysfunction, bleeding, delayed return of gastrointestinal (GI) function affecting nutrition, and infection from immune dysfunction, not to mention the possibility of requiring dialysis and its attendant complications.

#### V. Prevention of Acute Kidney Injury

#### A. Preoperative measures

- 1. Prior to and during cardiac catheterization, consider the following interventions (Table 12.2):
  - **a.** Avoid medications the day of the catheterization that may have adverse effects on renal function, including diuretics.
  - **b.** Adequately hydrate with normal saline before, during, and after catheterization. Leaving a patient NPO all day and performing a catheterization late in the day without hydration is a set-up for contrast-induced nephropathy. When this occurs, studies have shown a fourfold increase in operative mortality. Fluid administration may be based on the patient's estimated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP).

#### **Table 12.2 • Preoperative and Intraoperative Measures to Reduce the Risk of Acute Kidney Injury**

#### A. Preoperative measures

- 1. Hydrate before, during, and after cardiac catheterization
- 2. Use low‐volume, low‐osmolar contrast
- 3. Avoid preoperative use of diuretics unless clinically indicated
- 4. Repeat SCr if preoperative CKD, especially in diabetics, and defer surgery, if possible, until it has returned to baseline
- 5. Delay surgery if feasible at least 24 hours after catheterization
- 6. Withhold use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs the day of surgery; stop NSAIDs several days in advance
- 7. Optimize hemodynamic status
- 8. Treat profound anemia: erythropoietin plus iron for elective cases and preoperative transfusions for more urgent cases
- 9. Perform emergency surgery if feasible, for cardiogenic shock to reverse organ system dysfunction or consider mechanical circulatory support in very high‐risk patients
- 10. Correct all acid–base and metabolic problems
- 11. Perform hemodialysis the day prior to surgery in dialysis‐dependent patients and consider preoperative dialysis in patients with stage 4–5 CKD
- B. Intraoperative measures
  - 1. Perform off‐pump surgery if possible
  - 2. Optimize hemodynamics prebypass
  - 3. Use antifibrinolytics (ε‐aminocaproic [Amicar] or tranexamic acid) to minimize bleeding
  - 4. Pharmacologic renoprotection: possible use of fenoldopam or diltiazem
  - 5. Considerations during CPB
    - a. Use heparin‐coated circuits, miniaturized if possible
    - b. Prime pump with non‐potassium‐containing crystalloid (NS rather than lactated Ringer's, Normosol or Plasma‐Lyte)
    - c. Consider use of a leukocyte‐reducing filter
    - d. Maintain a high perfusion pressure (75–80 mm Hg) on bypass
    - e. Minimize extent of hypothermia and do not overwarm
    - f. Keep the pump run as short as possible
    - g. Maintain a hematocrit at least >20%
    - h. Be conservative with high‐potassium cardioplegia; consider using del Nido cardioplegia
    - i. Control hyperglycemia
    - j. Use hemofiltration to remove excess fluid

#### C. Postbypass measures

- 1. Optimize postbypass hemodynamics (drugs, IABP)
- 2. Use dexmedetomidine for sedation
- 3. Treat bleeding with factor concentrates, desmopressin (if suspect uremic platelet dysfunction) to minimize volume
- 4. Consider placement of a dialysis catheter for patients at high risk for requiring dialysis

#### **c.** A common protocol is to give:

| Preprocedure:     |                   | 3 mL/kg × 1 h                      |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------|
| During procedure: | LVEDP <13 mm Hg   | 5 mL/kg/h                          |
|                   | LVEDP 13–18 mm Hg | 3 mL/kg/h                          |
|                   | LVEDP >18 mm Hg   | 1.5 mL/kg/h                        |
| Postprocedure:    |                   | 1.5 mL/kg/h × 4 h or 1 mg/kg × 6 h |

- **d.** Although some studies have shown benefits of sodium bicarbonate or n‐acetylcysteine alone or together in minimizing the risk of contrast‐induced nephropathy, most groups have found hydration protocols to be the most beneficial.94–96
- **e.** Use low volumes of iso‐ or low‐osmolar nonionic contrast
- **2.** Repeat the SCr after contrast studies and defer surgery, if possible, until it has returned to baseline. Unfortunately, it can take up to 24–36 hours for the SCr to rise, so even delaying on‐pump (but probably not off‐pump) surgery for 24 hours after catheterization may not be sufficient to reduce the risk of postoperative AKI in patients with preexisting CKD.78,97–99 Some studies suggest that surgery should be delayed for five days after coronary angiography, especially when high‐contrast doses (>1.4 mL/kg) are used.100–102 However, surgery should not be delayed in critically ill patients with hemodynamic compromise and worsening renal function, since delay will often lead to less‐reversible renal failure and multisystem organ failure.
- **3.** Stop any medication with potential nephrotoxic effects, such as the NSAIDs, which impair autoregulation of RBF. Whether ACE inhibitors and ARBs should be withheld the morning of surgery remains controversial. They may cause refractory hypotension on CPB, which could contribute to kidney injury. However, studies have shown differing effects on the incidence of AKI, with evidence of both higher and lower risks of AKI in patients taking ACE inhibitors prior to surgery.16–21
- **4.** Fluid overload should be avoided as it is associated with a higher risk of AKI and worse surgical outcomes, most likely because of its association with decompensated HF and hemodynamic instability.103 In these patients, diuretics may need to be given to improve the clinical picture. Generally, in stable patients, diuretics should be withheld and consideration given to some preoperative hydration in patients with CKD.104
- **5.** Statins are routinely given to patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery, and often to those undergoing valvular surgery as well. There is some evidence that they lower levels of kidney biomarkers after surgery, suggesting that they might provide some degree of renoprotection.105 Although some individual studies show this benefit,106 a meta‐analysis and subsequent studies of high‐dose atorvastatin failed to do so.107,108 A study of rosuvastatin actually showed it increased the risk of AKI.109 Another meta‐analysis suggested that statin use did not influence the risk of AKI but did reduce the need for RRT.110 One review suggested continuation of statins might be beneficial for renoprotection, but starting them in statin‐naive patients may not.111
- **6.** Optimize hemodynamic status. Patients with poor cardiac function, fluid overload, and decompensated HF will often achieve substantial improvement in renal

function with appropriate medical care which should lower the risk of surgery. Patients in cardiogenic shock have a high mortality rate, which might be lessened by emergency surgical intervention. Consideration may be given to mechanical circulatory support if multisystem organ failure has developed, and this may allow for improvement in renal function. If surgery is performed in these high‐risk cases, postoperative AKI is inevitable but hopefully transient and reversible.

- **7.** Preoperative anemia is associated with an increased risk of AKI as is the use of multiple transfusions.6,112–114 Erythropoietin plus iron can be recommended to improve the hematocrit in patients undergoing elective surgery.115 In other patients in whom the calculated on‐pump hematocrit will be less than 21% based on the patient's size and blood volume, it is not unreasonable to transfuse patients preoperatively. It has been suggested that this strategy may be associated with a lower risk of AKI.116
- **8.** Correct acid–base and metabolic abnormalities that are often seen in patients with CKD. These patients are more susceptible to fluid overload, metabolic abnormalities (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hyperphosphatemia), and metabolic acidosis or alkalosis (from diuretics) in the perioperative period.
- **9.** Patients on chronic dialysis should be dialyzed within the 24 hours before and after surgery. The overall mortality rate for patients on chronic dialysis undergoing open‐heart surgery is approximately 10–15%, but even higher in those with advanced NYHA class and those undergoing urgent or emergent surgery and requiring complex surgery.
- **10.** Preoperative dialysis should also be considered in non‐dialysis‐dependent renal failure (stage 4–5), This approach to patients with a preoperative SCr ≥2.5 mg/dL has been shown to reduce the need for postoperative dialysis, with less morbidity and significantly less mortality.117–119
- **B. Intraoperative measures** should be taken to try to augment renal reserve by improving RBF, enhancing the GFR, and preventing tubular damage in patients with known renal dysfunction or risk factors for its development (Table 12.2).
  - **1.** Consider performing off‐pump coronary surgery, especially in diabetic patients with preoperative renal dysfunction. Whether this reduces the risk of AKI is controversial.27–33
  - **2.** Maintain optimal hemodynamic performance before CPB. This may require fluid administration, treatment of ischemia, or use of vasoactive drugs to support myocardial function or systemic resistance.
  - **3.** Use dexmedetomidine for sedation during surgery and afterwards. This may produce more hemodynamic stability and has been shown to reduce the incidence of AKI.67,120,121
  - **4.** Use antifibrinolytic drugs to minimize the bleeding diathesis that commonly accompanies renal dysfunction (uremic platelet dysfunction). ε‐aminocaproic acid (Amicar) is commonly used and is generally safe, although it is associated with some degree of renal tubular dysfunction without a significant change in creatinine clearance.122 Tranexamic acid is a good alternative.
  - **5.** Pharmacologic means to optimize renal perfusion have been studied with variable results.121,123

- **a. Fenoldopam** (0.03–0.1 μg/kg/min) may reduce the risk of AKI without any reduction in the need for renal replacement therapy or mortality, but this has not been uniformly demonstrated.123,124
- **b. Diltiazem** (0.1 mg/kg bolus followed by an infusion of 2 μg/kg/min) reduces renal vascular resistance by dilating afferent arterioles, resulting in an increase in RBF and GFR. It may limit calcium influx into renal tubular cells, preserving their integrity. It has been shown to increase sodium excretion and improve SCr and free water clearance by a direct effect on tubular reabsorption. However, the vasodilatory effect of diltiazem may adversely affect renal function during CPB, and in some studies has increased the risk of AKI.79 Studies do suggest that diltiazem is more likely to improve rather than reduce glomerular function in patients with mild–moderate renal dysfunction.125 One study showed that not using a calcium‐channel blocker perioperatively increased the risk of AKI.126 Another showed that the combination of dopamine and diltiazem started 24 hours before surgery and continued for 72 hours afterwards improved SCr and free water clearance compared with use of either drug alone.127
- **c.** Regimens using sodium bicarbonate, N‐acetylcysteine, and statins have shown mixed results and none can be recommended.10,121,123,128,129 Specifically, renal‐ dose dopamine (3 μg/kg/min) may increase urine output during CPB, but is not renoprotective.65,66 Spironolactone, a mineralocorticoid receptor blocker, may reduce ischemia‐reperfusion injury, but has also not been shown to reduce the risk of AKI.130
- **d. Mannitol** is commonly added to the pump to increase tubular flow and produce a diuresis. It increases oncotic pressure, reduces tissue edema, and may reduce cell swelling after cardioplegic arrest. Usually 25–50 g is added to the pump prime. However, mannitol has not been demonstrated to provide any benefit in preserving renal function in patients with both normal and abnormal preoperative renal function.131,132
- **e. Furosemide** is often given during surgery to augment urine output and is beneficial in treating patients with significant volume overload, severe oliguria, or hyperkalemia. However, although it may increase urine output, most studies have not demonstrated a renoprotective effect.66,133–135 There is one study that showed some benefit in patients with more than mild CKD.136 Although a lower urine output during CPB may be associated with an increased risk of AKI, this does not necessarily imply that pharmacologically increasing the urine output will reduce that risk.137

#### **6. Considerations during CPB**

- **a.** Use heparin‐coated and/or miniaturized circuits, and leukodepletion during the pump run, which may lower the incidence of postoperative AKI by reducing the systemic inflammatory response.138–140
- **b.** Use a non‐potassium‐containing crystalloid prime to reduce the risk of hyperkalemia induced by use of cardioplegia.
- **c.** Maintain a higher mean perfusion pressure on bypass (around 80 mm Hg) by increasing the systemic flow rate. If this does not raise the blood pressure to adequate levels, a vasopressor (phenylephrine, norepinephrine, or vasopressin) can be added. Autoregulation of RBF occurs down to a pressure of about 80 mm

- Hg, but below that flow is pressure‐dependent.141 Nonetheless, one study did indicate that the incidence of postoperative AKI was no different whether mean pressures <60, 60–69, or >70 mm Hg were used during CPB, although urine output was less at lower pressures.77
- **d.** Avoid more than mild hypothermia for routine cases and do not overwarm the patient prior to terminating CPB. Mild–moderate hypothermia probably has little impact on renal function, but rewarming to 37 °C may be deleterious.142,143 Therefore, it is generally recommended that patients only be warmed to 36.5 °C since the duration of a rewarming temperature above 37 °C contributes to AKI.144 This may occur because the kidneys may rewarm more rapidly than other organs, including the brain, resulting in hyperthermia‐related exacerbation of renal injury. For procedures involving deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, the incidence of AKI correlates with the duration of DHCA.145
- **e.** Keep the "pump run" as short as possible. Do what needs to be done and do it expeditiously. Generally, the longer the duration of CPB, the greater the incidence of AKI.75–77
- **f.** Avoid extreme hemodilution on CPB. Studies have suggested that there is a correlation between the lowest hematocrit on pump (usually <21%, but <24% in one study)14 and the incidence of AKI, especially in obese patients.12,13 However, the hematocrit is only one factor in oxygen delivery. Since AKI is more common below a critical level for oxygen delivery (272 mL/min/m2 ), lower hematocrits may be acceptable as long as oxygen delivery is maintained above the critical level with increased pump flow rates.146 There is a delicate balance between tolerating a lower hematocrit and administering blood transfusions, as administration of >2 units of blood has been associated with an increased risk of AKI.114 It has been suggested that patients who are chronically anemic tend to tolerate lower hematocrits on pump, and this might reduce the need to transfuse.147
- **g.** Avoid excessive use of cardioplegia to minimize the potassium load. Use low‐K+ reinfusions of standard blood cardioplegia, consider del Nido cardioplegia, which requires less frequent administration, and substitute intermittent cold blood (without cardioplegia) to minimize the risk of hyperkalemia.
- **h.** Prevent hyperglycemia or large variations in blood glucose levels during the pump run with intravenous (IV) insulin.148 Despite some concerns that a very strict hyperglycemia protocol may be associated with episodes of hypoglycemia, it has been shown that maintaining a blood sugar (BS) between 80 and 110 mg/ dL is associated with a significant reduction in AKI and the need for dialysis in nondiabetic patients.149 There may be additional potential benefits of insulin administration related to its anti‐inflammatory and antioxidant properties.
- **i.** Initiate hemofiltration towards the end of the pump run to reduce the positive fluid balance and increase the hematocrit. This is especially helpful in patients with preoperative HF and hypoxemia who require urgent surgery.150
- **j.** One study suggested that the use of sodium nitroprusside during rewarming on pump improved renal function in patients undergoing elective CABG, although this must not be allowed to occur at the expense of unacceptable hypotension.151 In addition, any hemolysis and free hemoglobin release during CPB may accelerate the release of free cyanide from SNP.152

#### **7. Considerations upon termination of CPB**

- **a.** Use Swan‐Ganz monitoring and frequent evaluations of transesophageal echocardiography to determine optimal filling pressures and the use of inotropes, vasopressors, or an IABP to support hemodynamics.
- **b.** Carefully monitor serum potassium in patients with preexisting CKD. Levels greater than 6 mEq/L may need to be treated with dextrose/insulin before coming off pump.
- **c.** Use dexmedetomidine for sedation post‐pump and during the early ICU stay.
- **d.** Desmopressin may be considered in uremic patients who manifest platelet dysfunction.153 In patients with coagulopathic bleeding after CPB, consider using factor concentrates (prothrombin complex concentrate or fibrinogen concentrate), rather than plasma, to minimize volume infusions.
- **e.** Consider placement of a central double‐lumen dialysis catheter if concerned about the possibility of needing dialysis in the early postoperative period.

### **VI. Postoperative Oliguria and Acute Kidney Injury**

- **A.** The use of hemodilution during CPB expands the extracellular volume and usually produces an excellent urine output in the immediate postoperative period. Oliguria is considered present in the postoperative cardiac surgical patient when the urine output is **less than 0.5 mL/kg/h**. Transient oliguria is commonly noted in the first 12 hours after surgery and usually responds to a volume infusion or low‐dose inotropic support. However, the persistence of oliguria is usually a manifestation of an acute renal insult caused by a prolonged pump run, prolonged hypotension, or a low cardiac output state. The SCr will frequently be lower immediately after CPB and the following morning due to hemodilution, and may have a delayed rise despite a marked reduction in GFR, as it takes time for SCr to accumulate in the bloodstream. Thus, it is important to recognize that AKI may be associated with an abrupt and sustained decrease in urine output and/or a decline in GFR, prior to noting an increase in SCr. Measurement of kidney biomarkers may be the most sensitive means of early detection of AKI.23–26
- **B. Definition of acute kidney injury.** The incidence of postoperative AKI depends on its definition, but it is estimated to occur in 30–50% of patients and is associated with a fourfold increase in mortality.73,86,154 Even very slight increases in postoperative SCr contribute to increased mortality.155
- **C.** The RIFLE system was devised in 2004 to classify progressively worsening degrees of renal dysfunction (Table 12.3).156 Since the function of the kidneys is both elimination of nitrogenous waste products and the production of urine, either the SCr level/GFR criteria **or** the urine output criteria were used for classification in this model as well as in two additional models noted below. It should be noted that urine output is determined by the difference between the GFR and the rate of tubular reabsorption. Therefore, if the GFR is low from CKD in association with poor tubular absorption, the patient can have good urine output initially. With AKI, tubular absorption is initially normal with a low GFR and then falls.
  - **1.** In the RIFLE system (Table 12.3), there is a seven‐day window to assess changes in SCr. As the degree of AKI worsens, the risk of dialysis increases and short‐ and intermediate‐term mortality rates increase.157 In fact, once RRT is necessary, the mortality rate is usually about 50%.

- **2.** In 2007, a slight modification of the RIFLE system was devised by the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) (Table 12.4).158 This did not utilize the GFR, did not require a baseline SCr, but did require two SCr determinations within 48 hours. It provided a fairly comparable assessment of AKI, but would not recognize AKI developing after 48 hours.159,160
- **3.** In 2012, another classification system was proposed, termed the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria.161 Acute kidney injury was defined as a 0.3 mg/dL increase in SCr from baseline within 48 hours of surgery, a 50% increase in SCr within seven days of surgery, or a decrease in urine output below 0.5 mg/kg/h for six hours.
- **4.** Using each of these systems, the prognosis was worse if both the elevated SCr and oliguria criteria were met.8,162
- **5.** The STS definition of AKI (version 2.42, available in 2020) was an increase in SCr to three times greater than baseline, or to >4 mg/dL with an acute rise

>0.5 mg/dL, or the requirement for dialysis. This essentially corresponds to the "failure" category of RIFLE and stage 3 of the AKIN. However, oliguria was not taken into consideration.

- **D. Diagnosis of AKI.** The early diagnosis of AKI can be difficult to make because of the delay in elevation of SCr and the maintenance of urine output despite nephron damage.
  - **1.** The SCr is influenced not just by glomerular function but also by tubular function and the generation of SCr. It is also influenced by patient gender, age, and muscle mass. Thus, it tends to underestimate the degree of renal dysfunction because, as the GFR falls, SCr secretion increases, minimizing the rise in SCr, upon which the GFR calculation is based. Although the SCr may not rise for several days after tubular injury has occurred, the eventual elevation in SCr does reflect changes in GFR, and is therefore valuable in confirming the diagnosis of AKI. A fall in SCr is an indicator of renal recovery from AKI, with the percentage decrease in SCr within 24 hours having the strongest correlation with long‐term outcomes.163
  - **2.** Elevation in plasma and urinary levels of kidney‐specific biomarkers, such as NGAL, cystatin C, KIM‐1, and IL‐18, may be noted within 2–6 hours of surgery and correlates with the extent and duration of AKI.23–26 These are valuable early indicators of AKI that precede elevation in SCr levels. Although cystatin concentration reflects baseline GFR more accurately than SCr and is independent of muscle mass, NGAL is rapidly induced in renal tubular cells in response to ischemic injury, and although its early appearance is independent of GFR, it is generally predictive of a subsequent decline in GFR. Because elevated NGAL levels may provide for earlier diagnosis and intervention of incipient AKI than elevations in SCr, some authors have recommended that all patients have baseline NGAL levels obtained for comparison with serial postoperative values.164
  - **3. Nonoliguric renal failure**, defined as a rise in SCr with a urine output >400 mL/ day, is the most common form of AKI and may occur after an uneventful operation in a patient with preexisting renal dysfunction or risk factors for its development, and occasionally without any precipitating factors. This condition usually reflects less renal damage and is associated with a mortality rate of about 5–10%. Most patients can be managed by judicious fluid administration, hemodynamic support as indicated, and high‐dose diuretics to optimize urine output while awaiting recovery of renal function. Patients experiencing AKI have a higher rate of hospital readmission, which is more frequent with more advanced levels of AKI.165

**4. Oliguric renal failure** may occur in patients with varying degrees of reduction in GFR, but, when the urine output is <0.3–0.5 mL/kg/h for 12–24 hours and there is a twofold increase in SCr, significant AKI is present with a higher likelihood of requiring RRT and a high mortality rate. It is estimated that the mortality of patients requiring dialysis is three times higher than those with nonoliguric AKI.166 This high mortality rate has not changed much over the past 10–15 years despite the early institution of various forms of RRT and general improvements in postoperative care. This reflects the higher‐risk population undergoing surgery and the morbidity of conditions frequently associated with renal failure, such as low cardiac output states, respiratory failure, infection, and stroke.

#### **E. Etiology and pathophysiology of postoperative AKI8–11,167**

- **1.** In patients with preexisting renal dysfunction, the complex effects of extracorporeal circulation will often induce some degree of AKI. Mechanisms include renal hypoperfusion from low‐flow, low‐pressure nonpulsatile perfusion with hemodilution and hypothermia, as well as an inflammatory response that may maintain afferent arteriolar constriction. The duration of CPB is therefore a major risk factor for the development of AKI.3,75–77 Using most of the recommendations delineated in Table 12.2, it may be possible to minimize the intraoperative insult and allow renal function to return to baseline within a few days if no additional insult occurs. However, the most common cause of a prolonged renal insult is a low cardiac output syndrome which may be present at the termination of CPB and may extend well into the early postoperative period in the ICU. An additional contributing factor is intense peripheral vasoconstriction, often related to use of α‐agents. Oliguria occurring as a consequence of reduced GFR is most clinically significant early after surgery when fluid overload and hyperkalemia can lead to pulmonary and myocardial complications and impair recovery from surgery.
- **2.** The kidneys have a tremendous capacity to autoregulate and maintain RBF, GFR, filtration fraction, and tubular reabsorption in the face of reduced renal perfusion pressure. Intrinsic renal mechanisms that maintain autoregulation include a reduction in afferent arteriolar resistance and an increase in efferent arteriolar resistance. However, when a low cardiac output state or hypotension persists or potent vasopressor medications are used, these compensatory reserves gradually become exhausted, filtration reserve is exceeded, and endogenous and/or exogenous vasoconstrictors increase afferent arteriolar resistance, resulting in a fall in GFR. At this point of prerenal azotemia, oliguria may occur, but tubular function may still be intact. Aggressive management to optimize renal perfusion at this time is essential to try to avoid tubular damage.
- **3.** However, a more protracted period of ischemia will eventually cause structural tubular injury with sloughing of cells that may obstruct the tubules with back leakage of fluid into the circulation. Impaired sodium absorption and increased sodium concentration in the distal tubules polymerizes proteins, contributing to cast formation. Oxidant injury and inflammatory phenomena result in further hypoperfusion and damage to tubular cells. Some of this damage is reversible and some results in apoptotic cell death. The term "acute tubular necrosis" (ATN) has commonly been applied to this condition, although it is a somewhat misleading term; therefore it is more commonly referred to as "acute kidney injury" (AKI). Thus, what usually originates as a prerenal "hypoperfusion" picture soon causes intrinsic renal damage.

- **4.** It should be noted that an acute ischemic renal insult is a hypoperfusion injury that may be undetected in a normotensive patient.168 If autoregulation is impaired, the kidney may be more susceptible to lesser degrees of hypoperfusion. Factors to consider are:
  - **a.** Renal arteriolar disease, notably in elderly patients and those with hypertension, CKD, or renal artery stenosis.
  - **b.** Failure of afferent arterioles to dilate appropriately. NSAIDs and Cox‐2 inhibitors decrease prostaglandin synthesis and allow endogenous vasoconstrictors to act unopposed; sepsis and liver failure increase afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction.
  - **c.** Use of vasoconstrictors during a low output state, which tend to reduce RBF despite achieving systemic normotension.
  - **d.** Failure of efferent arterioles to constrict, noted with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or direct renin inhibitors, such as aliskiren (Tekturna).
  - **e.** Systemic venous hypertension, often as a result of right ventricular failure, tamponade, or an abdominal compartment syndrome, which may reduce renal perfusion.169
- **5.** The acute development of oliguria and a rising SCr several days after surgery should always raise the specter of **cardiac tamponade**. The combination of systemic venous hypertension and a low output state can compromise renal perfusion even if hypotension is not evident. The patient may have nonspecific systemic symptoms, and a compensatory tachycardia may be absent with the use of β‐blockers.
- **6.** Conditions of impaired oxygen delivery (profound anemia from bleeding, hypoxemia from respiratory failure) may contribute to renal ischemia if there is borderline hypoperfusion.
- **F.** Three patterns of acute renal failure were described following open‐heart surgery over 30 years ago and in principle still hold true today (Figure 12.5).170 In the first, termed **"abbreviated ARF"**, a transient intraoperative insult occurs that causes renal ischemia without tubular damage. The SCr peaks on the fourth postoperative day and then returns to normal. In the second pattern, termed **"overt ARF"**, the acute insult is followed by a more prolonged period of cardiac dysfunction and is associated with mild tubular damage. The SCr usually rises to a higher level and gradually returns towards baseline over the course of 1–2 weeks once hemodynamics improve and tubular cell regenerate. The third pattern ("**protracted ARF**") is characterized by an initial insult followed by a period of cardiac dysfunction that resolves. Just as the SCr begins to fall, another insult, often from sepsis or a period of hypoperfusion or hypotension, occurs that triggers a progressive, often irreversible, rise in SCr. A fourth pattern of "protracted ARF" that may be added to this description is that of acute AKI that results from a very severe initial insult that may occur intraoperatively and/ or during the early postoperative period that causes extensive tubular damage from the outset and does not improve for quite some time, if at all.

#### **G. Assessment** (Table 12.5)

**1.** Assess cardiac hemodynamics (filling pressures, cardiac output). If the patient is no longer being intensively monitored, insertion of a Foley catheter is helpful in assessing urine output. Evidence of jugular venous distention or orthostatic vital

The reduction in creatinine clearance noted here is paralleled by a rise in SCr. (Reproduced with permission from Myers et al. *N Engl J Med* 1986;314(2):97–105. doi:10.1056/nejm198601093140207.)170

signs raise the specter of tamponade. An echocardiogram may be considered to assess ventricular function and the presence of a significant hemopericardium.

- **2.** Identify any drugs being prescribed with potential adverse effects on renal function (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs, nephrotoxic antibiotics).
- **3.** Obtain a serum BUN, SCr, and electrolytes. **Note:** an elevation in SCr with minimal or parallel rise in BUN is frequently noted with AKI. In contrast, a disproportionate rise in BUN with little rise in SCr may reflect a prerenal process or increased protein intake, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), GI bleeding (often associated with prerenal azotemia), hypercatabolism, or steroid administration, which increase urea production.

| Urinary sediment                                    | Hyaline casts | Tubular epithelial cells<br>Granular casts |  |

- **4.** Examine the urinary sediment. Tubular epithelial or granular ("muddy brown") casts are indicative of tubular injury, whereas hyaline casts are seen in low perfusion states. The sediment is important to examine because tests of tubular function, such as the urine sodium and osmolality, may be inaccurate with use of diuretics.
- 5. Measure the urine sodium  $(U_{N_a})$  and creatinine  $(U_{C_r})$  concentrations. These tests can differentiate prerenal from renal causes, but their interpretation will be influenced by the use of diuretics. A  $U_{N_a}$  <20 mEq/L is strongly suggestive of prerenal disease, but it could be elevated if the urine output is low. The fractional excretion of sodium (FE $_{N_a}$ ) is a better marker of renal sodium handling because it normalizes sodium handling against the secretion of creatinine, thus being independent of urine concentration. This is calculated as:

$$FE_{Na} = \frac{U_{Na} \times P_{Cr}}{P_{Na} \times U_{Cr}} \times 100$$

where U and P refer to the urinary and plasma concentrations, respectively, of sodium and creatinine.

a. In the oliguric patient, an  $FE_{Na}$  <1% reflects retained tubular function with absorption of sodium and water, consistent with a prerenal problem, except in some cases of contrast nephrotoxicity, HF, and hepatorenal syndrome. In contrast, an  $FE_{Na}$  >2% is usually caused by ATN with tubular damage. However, this may also be noted when a prerenal process is superimposed on CKD, with which the kidneys at baseline cannot conserve water and sodium appropriately. A rise in  $FE_{Na}$  may be noted during recovery of renal function due to sodium mobilization.

- **6.** Monitor other electrolytes (especially potassium), blood glucose, and acid–base balance frequently.
- **7.** Obtain a renal ultrasound to assess kidney size and rule out obstruction. A renal scan may be performed if a renal embolus is suspected.
- **H. Management of oliguria and AKI** (Table 12.6).171–173 Early aggressive intervention in patients with oliguria and early evidence of AKI may prevent progressive tubular injury and worsening of renal function. However, once AKI is established, very little can be done to promote recovery of renal function except to prevent additional insults. There is little evidence that strategies that increase RBF or increase urine flow to reduce tubular obstruction have any impact on enhancing tubular epithelial cell proliferation and recovery of function. Generally, attention should be directed towards maintaining urine output to reduce tissue edema and treating electrolyte or metabolic problems as they arise.
  - **1.** Ensure that the Foley catheter is within the bladder and is patent (this may rule out an obstructive uropathy). Irrigate with saline if necessary or consider changing the catheter empirically. If the Foley catheter has been removed, a bladder scan may indicate whether oliguria is real or spurious. Significant urinary retention may provide evidence of a post‐obstructive uropathy as the cause of an elevated SCr. Either way, replacement of the catheter may be helpful in further assessing the urine output.
  - **2.** Discontinue all potentially nephrotoxic drugs (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs, nephrotoxic antibiotics) and avoid any diagnostic studies requiring IV contrast.

#### **Table 12.6 • Management of Low Urine Output**

- 1. Ensure that Foley catheter is in the bladder and is patent
- 2. Optimize cardiac function
  - Treat hypovolemia: minimize use of chloride‐liberal solutions
  - Control arrhythmias and pace for slow rhythms
  - Improve contractility
  - Reduce elevated afterload, but allow BP to drift up to 130–140 mm Hg
- 3. Diuretics or other medications
  - Give increasing doses of furosemide (up to 500 mg IV) or a continuous infusion of 10–20 mg/h
  - Add chlorothiazide 500 mg IV to the loop diuretic
  - Consider bumetanide 4–10 mg or 1 mg bolus, then a 0.5–2 mg/h infusion
  - Consider use of fenoldopam 0.1 μg/kg/min, especially if hypertensive
- 4. If above fail
  - Limit fluid to insensible losses
  - Readjust drug doses
  - Avoid potassium supplements
  - Nutrition: essential amino acid diet
    - → High nitrogen tube feeds if on dialysis
    - →Total parenteral nutrition with 4.25% amino acid/35% dextrose
- 5. Consider early renal replacement therapy

- **3.** Optimize hemodynamics. Although augmenting the cardiac output may not be able to expedite recovery of renal function, it is clear that any additional insult that causes hypotension or hypoperfusion may contribute to a state of "protracted ARF". These insults include hypovolemia (often GI bleeding), low cardiac output states (tamponade), arrhythmias (rapid atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia), antihypertensive medications, or sepsis. Thus, there is little downside to optimizing hemodynamics to increase urine output even if the rate of renal recovery is not hastened.
  - **a.** Hemodynamic monitoring with a Swan‐Ganz catheter may be indicated if a low cardiac output state is suspected. If the diagnosis is not clear, echocardiography can differentiate ventricular failure from tamponade or significant hypervolemia. Otherwise, assessment of fluid balance, strict I & O's, and/or a careful physical examination may give an overall assessment of the patient's fluid balance and intravascular volume.
  - **b.** Optimize preload without being overzealous with fluid administration. Remember that, in a state of capillary leak (often seen following surgery with a long duration of CPB, with a persistent low output state, or with sepsis) or with reduced oncotic pressure (as noted from hemodilution or poor nutritional condition), excessive fluid administration may produce noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Fluid administration with solutions with high chloride content (5% albumin, normal saline, Hespan, Volvuven) should be minimized as they may increase the risk of AKI.42,49–51
  - **c.** Optimize heart rate and treat arrhythmias. Increasing the heart rate with atrial or AV pacing (V pacing only if there is no atrial capture) above 80/min to augment the cardiac output might prove beneficial in improving renal perfusion and GFR. Successful electrical or pharmacologic conversion of atrial fibrillation will improve cardiac output.
  - **d.** Improve contractility with inotropes if a low cardiac output state is present.
  - **e.** Reduce afterload with vasodilators to improve cardiac function, but do so carefully; eliminate drugs that can cause renal vasoconstriction; avoid ACE inhibitors and ARBs.
    - **i.** Do not be overly aggressive in the reduction of systemic blood pressure in patients with preexisting hypertension and CKD. They usually require a higher blood pressure (130–140 mm Hg systolic) to maintain renal perfusion. In fact, while the patient is in the ICU, adding an α‐agent to increase the blood pressure to that range often results in a significant improvement in urine output.
    - **ii.** If inotropic drugs with vasodilator properties are used, such as milrinone or dobutamine, an α‐agent may be necessary to maintain systemic blood pressure. Vasopressin can be used in vasodilated states with a good cardiac output ("vasoplegia"). Norepinephrine is preferable if the cardiac output is borderline because it will also provide some inotropic support. Use of a pure α‐agent, such as phenylephrine, is more likely to cause renal vasoconstriction unless the cardiac output is excellent.
  - **f.** If the cardiac output remains marginal despite the use of multiple inotropes, consider the placement of an IABP. This may result in an abrupt and dramatic increase in urine output.

- **4.** If oliguria persists despite optimization of hemodynamics, the next step is selection of a **diuretic**, conditional upon the patient's volume status. The majority of studies have shown that loop diuretics do not prevent AKI, do not improve renal functional recovery or alter the natural history of AKI, do not decrease the need for renal replacement therapy, and in fact may increase operative mortality and delay recovery of renal function.174–177 If the patient is euvolemic or mildly fluid overloaded, use of diuretics to simply improve urine output is not indicated. However, loop diuretics may improve urine output and can often convert oliguric to nonoliguric renal failure if administered early after the onset of renal failure. An improvement in urine output (diuretic‐responsive AKI) suggests that the extent of renal injury is less severe, coincidentally leading to an earlier decrease in SCr. Thus, it is potentially beneficially to administer diuretics to reduce fluid overload, primarily to optimize pulmonary function, although this will not hasten recovery of renal function.
  - **a. Furosemide** is given in incremental doses starting at 10 mg IV. However, once acute renal failure is established, a dose of 100 mg IV is commonly required and should be given over 20–30 minutes to minimize ototoxicity. If urine output fails to increase within a few hours, the following steps can be taken:
    - **i.** Increase the dose of furosemide up to 200 mg IV (limiting the cumulative daily dose to 1 g).
    - **ii.** Use a continuous infusion of IV furosemide. Give a loading dose of 40–100 mg, and then initiate an infusion of 10–20 mg/h. Rebolus before an increase in the infusion rate. This may be the best means of maintaining an adequate urine output.
    - **iii.** Alternatively, bumetanide can be given either as a bolus dose of 4–10 mg IV or as a 1 mg load followed by a continuous infusion of 0.5–2 mg/h depending on the estimated creatinine clearance. There is little evidence that one loop diuretic is better than any other, but some patients respond better to one than the other.
  - **b.** Various **combinations** of medications may be effective in improving diuresis.
    - **i.** Add a **thiazide** diuretic to the loop diuretic. These include chlorothiazide 500 mg IV, metolazone (Zaroxolyn) 5–10 mg PO or via a nasogastric tube, or hydrochlorothiazide 50–200 mg PO qd. Thiazides block distal nephron sites and act synergistically with the loop diuretics to increase exposure of the distal tubules to solute. This combination is particularly effective in patients who tend to be diuretic‐resistant.178 The thiazide should be given 20 minutes before the loop diuretic to prime the distal tubules; otherwise, there may be compensatory sodium reabsorption in the distal tubules.
    - **ii.** Although dopamine has not been shown to be effective in preventing AKI, reducing its severity and duration, or lowering the risk of dialysis, one study found that the combination of mannitol (500 mL of 20% Osmitrol) + furosemide (1 g) + dopamine (2–3 μg/kg/min) started within the first six hours of oliguria produced a significant diuresis with early restoration of renal function.179
- **5. Fenoldopam** has shown equivocal results in the treatment of established AKI after cardiac surgery. One study of patients receiving a 72‐hour infusion for early

- acute AKI (a 50% rise in SCr) showed a trend towards reduction in mortality and the need for dialysis in nondiabetic patients, but other studies have not shown much benefit.180,181
- **6. Diltiazem** given intra‐ and postoperatively (primarily to prevent radial artery graft spasm) has shown an insignificant improvement in creatinine clearance, so whether it has any role in the management of AKI is not clear.182
- **7. Note: mannitol** is an osmotic diuretic that is frequently used during surgery to increase serum osmolality during hemodilution to minimize tissue edema. It improves renal tubular flow, reduces tubular cell swelling, and also improves urine output. In patients with early postoperative AKI, it increases RBF by decreasing renal vascular resistance, but does not affect filtration fraction or renal oxygenation.183 Nonetheless, it is best avoided in the postoperative period because its oncotic effect mobilizes fluid into the intravascular space. This could theoretically lead to pulmonary edema if fluid overload is present and urine output does not improve. In fact, a significant increase in serum osmolality can cause renal vasoconstriction and induce renal failure.

#### **I. Management of established renal failure**

- **1.** Once oliguric renal failure is established, treatment should be directed towards optimizing hemodynamics while minimizing excessive fluid administration, providing appropriate nutrition, and initiating early renal replacement therapy to hopefully reduce morbidity and improve survival. The blood pressure should be maintained at a higher level than usual in hypertensive patients whose kidneys may require higher perfusion pressures.
- **2.** Restrict fluids with mL/mL of fluid replacement (i.e. input = output) plus 500 mL D5W/0.2% normal saline/day (about 200 mL/m2 /day). Daily weights are helpful in assessing changes in day‐to‐day fluid status, but must also take into consideration the influence of nutritional status on body mass.
- **3.** Monitor electrolytes and blood glucose
  - **a.** Avoid potassium supplements and medications that increase potassium levels (β‐blockers, ACE inhibitors). Correct hyperkalemia as described on pages 709–711.
  - **b.** Hyponatremia, if associated with inappropriate ADH (SIADH), should be treated with fluid restriction. The hypovolemic patient with hyponatremia may need isotonic saline.
  - **c.** Metabolic acidosis is common with acute/chronic kidney injury and does not need to be corrected if the serum bicarbonate is >15 mEq/L. If it is lower, a potential contributing cause to a hypoperfusion issue should be sought and corrected.
  - **d.** Correct hyperglycemia and abnormalities of calcium, phosphate, or magnesium metabolism.

#### **4.** Medications

- **a.** Eliminate drugs that impair renal perfusion or are nephrotoxic (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, aminoglycosides, NSAIDs).
- **b.** Avoid or adjust doses of medications that are excreted or metabolized by the kidneys (particularly low‐molecular‐weight heparin, and renally excreted

- antibiotics) (see Appendices 12 and 13). Unfractionated heparin may be used for patients with mechanical heart valves until the INR becomes therapeutic on warfarin. NOACs (especially apixaban) can be used in reduced dosage for other patients with indications for anticoagulation other than mechanical heart valves.
- **c.** Give antacid medications (proton pump inhibitors [PPIs]) to minimize the risk of GI bleeding, but avoid magnesium‐containing antacids and laxatives. However, PPIs have been linked to hypomagnesemia, interstitial nephritis, and other renal issues when used for more than one week.184
- **5.** Remove the Foley catheter and catheterize daily or prn depending on the urine output. Culture the urine if clinically indicated.
- **6.** Improve the patient's nutritional state with enteral nutrition if possible.185,186 If the patient is able to eat, an essential amino acid diet should be used. Protein should not be restricted if the patient is on hemodialysis, which can result in the loss of 3–5 g/h of protein. Patients on dialysis should receive approximately 25–30 Kcal/ kg of nutrition with a minimum of 1.5 g/kg/day of protein.
  - **a.** If a patient on dialysis is unable to eat but has a functional GI tract, a high nitrogen tube feeding can be used. For most patients with acute renal failure, there is no need to alter the amount of protein, and standard tube feedings can be used unless hyperkalemia is present. In patients with CKD who do not require dialysis, a low‐protein supplement can be used to provide 0.5–0.8 g/ kg/day of protein.
  - **b.** If the patient is unable to tolerate enteral feedings, total parenteral nutrition using a 4.25% amino acid/35% dextrose solution that contains no potassium, magnesium, or phosphate is recommended.
- **7.** Consider the prompt initiation of renal replacement therapy.

#### **VII. Renal Replacement Therapy**

- **A.** Various forms of renal replacement therapy (RRT) can be used to remove excessive fluid and solute to improve electrolyte balance and remove other nitrogenous waste products (Table 12.7).187
  - **1. Indications.** The most important indications for initiation of RRT are fluid overload, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis. Other signs of uremia, such as a change in mental status, pericarditis, or GI bleeding, should also prompt initiation of RRT, although these are uncommon in the acute setting. However, a very important and sometimes difficult decision to make is whether RRT should be initiated at the first sign of persistent oliguria or a rising SCr, especially since the latter tends to lag behind the extent of renal dysfunction. Some studies of cardiac surgical patients have shown that early and aggressive dialysis, before the patient develops signs and symptoms of renal failure and before a marked elevation in SCr occurs, improves outcomes.188,189 Other studies in ICU patients have shown conflicting results.190,191 Certainly, when marked oliguria is present early after surgery in a patient with significant fluid overload, and when there is a poor response to diuretics, a delay in initiating RRT may lead to respiratory compromise and prolonged ventilation with its attendant risks. On the other hand, some patients may recover renal function without the need for dialysis, which has numerous risks, including hypotension, which can prolong renal failure.

HD, hemodialysis; SCUF, slow continuous ultrafiltration; CVVH, continuous veno‐venous hemofiltration; CVVHD, continuous veno‐venous hemofiltration with dialysis

- **2.** An additional consideration in patients with moderate renal dysfunction (SCr >2–2.5 mg/dL) is use of "prophylactic" preoperative dialysis. Several studies have demonstrated that this reduces the need for postoperative RRT, with a reduction in overall morbidity and mortality.117–119
- **3.** RRT involves several processes to remove volume, solute, or waste products. A transmembrane gradient (basically hydrostatic pressure) drives plasma water (ultrafiltration) and solute (convection) across a semipermeable membrane. Solute removal by diffusion is driven by the difference in the solute concentration between plasma and an electrolyte solution on the other side of the membrane.
- **4.** The most common forms of RRT used in cardiac surgery patients are those of intermittent hemodialysis and continuous veno‐venous hemofiltration. Selection of the appropriate modality depends on the indications for its use (whether primarily for volume or solute removal), and the hemodynamic stability of the patient. Both of these approaches are associated with comparable outcomes, such as recovery of renal function and survival.189–191

#### **B. Intermittent hemodialysis (HD)**

- **1. Principle.** Solute passes by diffusion down a concentration gradient from the blood, across a hollow‐fiber semipermeable membrane, and into a dialysate bath. Fluid removal by ultrafiltration and solute transport by convection also occur due to the differences in hydrostatic pressure on either side of the membrane.
- **2. Indications.** HD is indicated for the management of hyperkalemia, acid–base imbalances, fluid overload, or a hypercatabolic state in the hemodynamically stable patient. It is the most efficient means of removing solute (urea, creatinine) and

<sup>–</sup> avoid; 0 minimal effect; + useful; + + better; + + + even better

- correcting severe acid–base abnormalities. It can be combined with ultrafiltration to remove excess volume.
- **3. Access.** Standard intermittent HD is performed using a single 12 Fr double‐ lumen catheter (such as the Mahurkar [Medtronic] or Niagara, DuoGlide and Power‐Trialysis catheters [Bard]) preferentially placed in the internal jugular vein for short‐term dialysis. Placement in the subclavian vein can cause venous thrombosis, which could impair ipsilateral fistula maturation if that is required in the future and should be avoided. Femoral venous access is feasible but impairs patient mobility. To reduce the risk of infection in patients requiring more extended periods of dialysis, a double‐lumen Permcath (Medtronic) or HemoGlide (Bard) long‐term hemodialysis catheter can be placed into the internal jugular vein and brought through a subcutaneous tunnel as a "midline" catheter. Subsequently, a fistula can be created for permanent dialysis. When recovery appears unlikely and a fistula is being considered, the arm vessels on one side should be protected from use as much as possible.
- **4. Technique.** Intermittent HD is performed over a three‐ to four‐hour period and is usually performed at least three times per week until renal function recovers. The blood is pumped into the dialysis cartridge at a rate of 300–400 mL/min, while the dialysate solution is infused at a rate of 500–700 mL/min in a direction countercurrent to blood flow. Although heparin is commonly used, heparin‐free HD is possible in patients with bleeding problems or heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia.

#### **5. Limitations**

- **a.** Circulatory instability with hypotension from a blunted sympathetic reflex response to hypovolemia is the most common complication of HD, especially if large volumes are being removed in a short period of time. Rapid removal of volume can cause myocardial stunning, and ultrafiltration exceeding 13 mL/ kg/h is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality.192 Too high a blood flow during initiation of dialysis will reduce plasma osmolality, prompting water movement into cells, exacerbating the depletion of extracellular volume. This problem has been mitigated to some degree by use of biocompatible membranes, bicarbonate baths, initial high dialysate sodium, cool temperatures, and volumetric control during dialysis. Colloid or blood transfusions and hemodynamic support (usually with α‐agents or PO midodrine) are frequently necessary. About 20–30% of patients develop hypotension during HD, and about 10% of patients cannot tolerate it because of hemodynamic instability. This is probably more common in patients early in the postoperative period, especially if hemodynamic compromise was a major contributing factor to their developing AKI. Therefore, HD is best avoided in the hemodynamically unstable patient.
- **b.** Dialysis machines are complex and costly, and require special expertise.
- **C. Continuous veno‐venous systems** can be used in a variety of ways, including slow continuous ultrafiltration (SCUF), continuous veno‐venous hemofiltration (CVVH), and continuous veno‐venous hemodialysis or hemodiafiltration (CVVHD).
  - **1. Principle.** An occlusive pump is included in a circuit that actively withdraws blood at a designated rate from the venous system, pumps it with hydrostatic pressure through the membrane of a hemofilter, and then returns the blood to the

- venous system. This circuit achieves filtration or convection of plasma water. For CVVHD, dialysis fluid runs countercurrent to the direction of blood flow within the ultrafiltration membrane. Solute then passes by diffusion down a concentration gradient across a hemofilter into the dialysate solution.
- **2. Indications.** These systems are indicated for the management of fluid overload, especially in the hemodynamically unstable or hypotensive patient. Slow correction of electrolyte imbalance can be achieved with CVVH using a crystalloid solution of different composition for replacement fluid. Severe electrolyte imbalance and hypercatabolic state are better managed with CVVHD.
- **3. Access** is obtained using a 12 Fr double‐lumen catheter (12 gauge for each lumen) placed in the internal jugular or femoral vein.
- **4. Technique** (Figure 12.6)
  - **a.** Most continuous veno‐venous circuits are "integrated" systems that include a blood pump, pressure monitors, air detector with shut‐off controls, and fluid balancing systems for ultrafiltrate control. A high‐efficiency biocompatible hemodialysis cartridge is attached downstream to an occlusive pump and heparin is infused into the inflow portion of the circuit to maintain a dialyzer output (venous) PTT of 45–60 seconds. Alternatively, regional citrate anticoagulation

**Figure 12.6 •** Continuous veno‐venous hemofiltration (CVVH). An occlusive pump withdraws blood from the venous circuit, pumps it through a ultrafiltration membrane, and returns it to the venous system through a double‐lumen catheter placed in the internal jugular vein.

- can be infused into the inflow limb instead of heparin, especially in patients with bleeding or heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia.193,194 When citrate is used, steps must be taken to avoid hypocalcemia and metabolic alkalosis. Calcium should be infused in the venous return line postfilter and alkaline buffers must be reduced in replacement fluids for CVVH or in the dialysate solution for CVVHD.
- **b. SCUF** removes fluid by ultrafiltration, but does not remove much solute. The blood flow rate is set at 50–80 mL/min and the ultrafiltrate rate is set at the desired amount (about 5 mL/min), which can potentially achieve a net negative fluid balance of up to 7 L/day. The filter is more prone to clotting due to the slow flow and because the postfilter hematocrit is high. Since no replacement fluid is given and minimal solute is removed, SCUF is used primarily to treat volume overload since it is ineffective for uremia or hyperkalemia.
- **c.** With **CVVH**, fluid and solute are transported by ultrafiltration and convection, respectively, and no dialysate solution is used. The pump is usually set to deliver blood at a rate of 50–300 mL/min and the ultrafiltrate rate is usually set at a preselected rate around 16.7 mL/min or 1 L/h (range of 0.5–4 L/h). The blood then passes through a bubble trap air detector and is returned to the patient. Replacement fluid (alternating 1 L of 0.9% NS plus 1 ampoule [10 mL of a 10% solution] of calcium gluconate with 1 L of 0.45% NS plus 1 ampoule [50 mEq/50 mL] of 8.4% NaHCO3 ) is infused into the outflow (return) circuit or into the venous chamber to correct electrolyte and acid– base imbalances. The amount administered is dictated by the desired negative fluid balance per hour. This technique can achieve a moderate amount of solute and fluid removal due to the high ultrafiltration rate. Clotting of the system is less likely because the dialyzer can be prediluted with a large volume of fluid.
- **d. CVV hemodialysis (CVVHD)** transports solute by diffusion with variable degrees of ultrafiltration to remove fluid, whereas **CVV hemodiafiltration** combines the convective solute removal of CVVH with the diffusive solute removal of hemodialysis, along with ultrafiltration. The blood flow is set at 50–300 mL/min and the dialysate (Dianeal 1.5% with 4 mL of 23% NaCl per 2 L bag) is infused into the dialysis cartridge at a rate of 1–2 L/h or even higher for hemodiafiltration. These techniques are most useful in the highly catabolic patient to remove a large solute load. The effluent flow rate (hemofiltration rate + the dialysate flow rate) should be about 20–25 mL/kg to achieve adequate solute clearance.

#### **5. Advantages and limitations**

- **a.** Citrate anticoagulation eliminates concerns about use of heparin.
- **b.** High flow rates of CVVH/CVVHD reduce the potential for clotting of the filter noted with SCUF.
- **c.** Use of the blood pump enables CVVH to be performed when the patient is hypotensive or hemodynamically unstable.
- **d.** Because CVVH removes so much fluid, it is essential to carefully monitor electrolytes and modify the replacement solutions as necessary to maintain electrolyte balance.
- **e.** The pump adds some complexity and cost to the system compared with arteriovenous hemofiltration.

- **D. Continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration (CAVH)** is used during surgery to remove excessive fluid before terminating CPB. It is beneficial in improving hemodynamics, hemostasis, and pulmonary function in higher‐risk patients. Postoperatively, its use is limited by the need for arterial access, heparinization to minimize clotting of the hemofilter, and the requirement for satisfactory arterial pressure to provide the hydrostatic pressure to achieve hemofiltration. Because of these drawbacks, CAVH has been replaced by CVVH in most units.
- **E. Peritoneal dialysis (PD)** is rarely used in cardiac surgical patients, because it produces abdominal distention and glucose absorption that can compromise respiratory status, and it carries the risk of peritonitis. Its use is usually limited to patients on chronic peritoneal dialysis.

#### **VIII. Hyperkalemia**

- **A. Etiology** in cardiac surgery patients
  - **1.** High‐volume, high‐potassium cardioplegia solutions used in the operating room. The potassium load is usually eliminated promptly by normally functioning kidneys, but hyperkalemia can be problematic in patients with acute or chronic renal dysfunction or oliguria from other causes.
  - **2.** Low cardiac output states associated with oliguria. Potassium levels may rise with alarming and life‐threatening rapidity.
  - **3.** Severe tissue ischemia, whether peripheral (from severe peripheral vascular disease or complication of an IABP) or intra‐abdominal (mesenteric ischemia). Hyperkalemia is often the first clue to the existence of these problems.
  - **4.** Acute and chronic renal insufficiency
  - **5.** Medications that impair potassium excretion or increase potassium levels (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, potassium‐sparing diuretics [triamterene, spironolactone, amiloride, eplerenone], NSAIDs, β‐blockers)
  - **6.** Severe hyperglycemia, which increases potassium release from cells into the extracellular fluid
  - **7. Note:** remember that hyperkalemia is exacerbated by acidosis, which often accompanies low‐output or ischemic syndromes. A 0.2 unit change in pH produces about a 1 mEq/L change in serum potassium concentration. However, in conditions of organic acidosis, the potassium is more likely to rise from tissue breakdown and release of potassium from cells (lactic acidosis) or from insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia (ketoacidosis), than from a change in pH.
- **B. Manifestations** are predominantly electrocardiographic due to depolarization of cardiac cell resting membrane potentials, which decreases membrane excitability. An asystolic arrest may occur when the potassium rises rapidly to a level exceeding 6.5 mEq/L. The ECG changes of hyperkalemia do not always develop in classic progressive fashion and are more related to the rate of rise of serum potassium than to the absolute level. These changes include:
  - **1.** Peaked T waves
  - **2.** ST depression
  - **3.** Smaller R waves
  - **4.** Prolonged PR interval

- **5.** Loss of P waves
- **6.** QRS widening, bradycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and asystole. When the heart is being paced, hyperkalemia may result in failure to respond to the pacemaker stimulus.
- **C. Treatment** entails stabilizing the cell membrane, shifting potassium into cells, and increasing its excretion from the body (Table 12.8).195,196 A hyperkalemic emergency is present when there are ECG changes, a serum potassium >6.5 mEq/L, or a level >5.5 mEq/L with acute renal impairment and ongoing tissue breakdown or potassium absorption (GI bleeding). These patients need an emergency reduction in their potassium levels. In other patients, a slower reduction is feasible.
  - **1.** It is essential to identify and remove any potential source of potassium intake or medications that may increase the potassium level (as above); use a low‐potassium diet in patients with renal dysfunction and persistent hyperkalemia.
  - **2.** Address cardiac toxicity:
    - **a.** If there is evidence of advanced cardiac toxicity or ECG changes, usually when the potassium is >6.5 mEq/L, administer **calcium gluconate** 10 mL of a 10% solution (1 g) IV over 2–3 minutes to stabilize the cell membranes. The beneficial effect should be noted within minutes, but lasts only about 30 minutes. Note that calcium potentiates the cardiotoxic effects of digoxin, so hyperkalemia in patients on digoxin should preferentially be treated with digoxin‐specific antibody fragments (Digibind), although a slow infusion of calcium gluconate can safely be given over 30 minutes.

**b.** Alternatively, calcium chloride 5–10 mL of a 10% solution (0.5–1 g) can be infused through a central line over several minutes. This may produce hemodynamic changes, but provides four times more elemental calcium than calcium gluconate.

#### **3.** Shift potassium into cells:

- **a. Regular insulin** 10 units in 50 mL of a 50% dextrose solution IV. This should lower the potassium about 0.5–1.5 mEq/L within 15 minutes and last for several hours. Another regimen is 10–20 units in 500 mL of 10% dextrose given over 60 minutes. This can be considered first if there is marked hyperkalemia but no ECG changes.
- **b. Sodium bicarbonate** (NaHCO3 ) administration in patients with acidosis results in hydrogen release from cells in exchange for potassium movement into cells. Thus, correction of acidosis should lower potassium levels. Bicarbonate also has a direct effect on hyperkalemia independent of a change in pH.197 However, boluses of bicarbonate are not that effective in reducing serum potassium, so in hyperkalemic emergencies, an infusion (150 mEq in one liter of D5W given over 2–4 hours) is recommended. In hyponatremic patients, the sodium load may reverse some of the ECG changes of hyperkalemia.
- **c.** β<sup>2</sup> ‐agonists activate the Na+ –K+ –ATPase system to drive potassium into cells and can lower the potassium level by 0.5–1.5 mEq/L. The only recommended drug is **albuterol** 10–20 mg in 4 mL NS by nebulizer over 10 minutes, which has a peak effect in about 90 minutes. Epinephrine (0.05 μg/kg/ min) may also be effective, but it is best avoided in the cardiac patient unless there is an inotropic requirement.
- **4.** Enhance potassium excretion because the effects of calcium and glucose‐insulin infusions are short‐lived.
  - **a. Furosemide** 20–40 mg IV is very effective in reducing serum potassium in patients without significant renal impairment. Diuretics may be given alone in patients with hypervolemia, but should be combined with a saline infusion in patients who are euvolemic or hypovolemic. Continuous infusions may also be used. In patients with impaired renal function, IV saline or isotonic bicarbonate should be given along with the diuretic, usually in higher doses, since sodium delivery to the distal tubules is essential to promote potassium excretion.
  - **b. Hemodialysis** is indicated in patients with hyperkalemia and severe renal dysfunction. It can remove up to 50 mEq of potassium per hour.
  - **c.** Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (**Kayexalate**) is as cation‐exchange resin that may be given orally (15–30 g in 60–120 mL of 20% sorbitol) or as an enema (50 g in 150 mL of tap water, but **NOT** with sorbitol). Each gram may bind up to 1 mEq of potassium. It may be considered if the other measures have failed to reduce the potassium or are not immediately available. However, it should not be given to patients with an ileus or receiving narcotics, which includes most postoperative patients. Kayexalate has been associated with the occurrence of colonic necrosis which may be related to decreased colonic motility, and may occur with or without use of sorbitol.198

- **d. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate** (ZC‐9) is a selective cation‐exchanger that entraps potassium in the intestinal tract in exchange for sodium and hydrogen. It is given in doses starting at 2.5 g three times a day and produces a rapid and dose‐dependent reduction in potassium levels within 48 hours.199,200
- **e. Patiromer** (8.4 g orally) is a GI cation‐exchanger that binds potassium ions in the GI tract in exchange for calcium ions, so less potassium is absorbed and more is excreted in the stool. Potassium starts falling in seven hours and continues to decrease for 48 hours. It should be considered if hemodialysis is not immediately available in a patient with severe renal impairment, but is usually used for the chronic, rather than acute, treatment of hyperkalemia.200

#### **IX. Hypokalemia**

#### **A. Etiology**

- **1.** Profound diuresis without adequate potassium replacement. Potassium excretion parallels the urine output after CPB, which tends to be copious because of hemodilution. The use of potent diuretics may produce a significant diuresis and kaliuresis in the early postoperative period.
- **2.** Insulin to treat hyperglycemia, which redistributes potassium from the extracellular fluid into cells ("redistributive hypokalemia")
- **3.** Hypomagnesemia (usually from diuresis) which can cause refractory hypokalemia
- **4.** Alkalosis (metabolic or respiratory) (the "L" in alkalosis tells you the potassium is "lowered")
- **5.** Significant nasogastric tube drainage
- **B. Manifestations.** The primary concern with hypokalemia in the cardiac patient is the induction of cardiac reentrant arrhythmias due to enhanced cardiac automaticity and delayed ventricular repolarization. Hypokalemia may produce atrial, junctional, or ventricular ectopy (PACs, PVCs), paroxysmal atrial and junctional tachycardias, AV block, and VT/VF. The ECG may demonstrate flattened ST segments, decreased T‐ wave amplitude, and the presence of "u" waves. Factors that may promote the development of hypokalemic arrhythmias include myocardial ischemia, enhanced sympathetic tone (often from epinephrine or β<sup>2</sup> ‐agonists), digoxin, and low magnesium levels (commonly seen after CPB). Hypokalemia can also result in weakness involving the respiratory muscles, the GI tract (producing an ileus), or the skeletal muscles.
- **C. Treatment** is indicated for any potassium level below the normal range, although ECG changes do not become evident until the level is <3 mEq/L.201,202 Most patients with diuretic‐induced hypokalemia have a metabolic alkalosis associated with chloride depletion. Low chloride levels enhance bicarbonate reabsorption in the kidneys, and sodium is exchanged for potassium rather than excreted with chloride. Thus, failure to replenish chloride leads to more potassium wasting.
  - **1.** It is essential that renal function and urine output be evaluated before a potassium chloride (KCl) drip is started, because acute hyperkalemia can develop very rapidly when oliguria or renal dysfunction is present. A slower infusion rate is advisable in this situation, with frequent rechecking of the serum potassium level. Particular attention should be paid to sources of urinary or GI loss of potassium that may require more aggressive replacement.

- **2.** Serum magnesium levels should be checked because hypomagnesemia can make the hypokalemia refractory to treatment; if low, magnesium should be replaced.
- **3.** In the ICU setting, KCl is administered through a central line at a rate of 10–20 mEq/h (mix of 20–40 mEq/100 mL in 0.45% NS). An infusion pump should always be considered when the IV bag contains more than 40 mEq or the infusion rate exceeds 10 mEq/h, to avoid a catastrophic hyperkalemic event. A dextrose carrier should be avoided because it may lower the potassium level by stimulating secretion of insulin. The serum potassium rises approximately 0.1 mEq/L for each 2 mEq of KCl administered. Repeat potassium levels should guide therapy.
- **4.** When a central line is not present, a concentrated potassium drip cannot be administered peripherally because it scleroses veins. The maximum concentration of KCl that can be administered peripherally is 60 mEq/L. IV bags containing 60 mEq/L or 10 mEq in a 100–200 mL bag are commonly used.
- **5.** Once the patient is extubated, oral potassium (10–20 mEq tablets up to three to four times a day) will usually suffice to treat potassium levels of 3–4 mEq/L. However, doses of 40–60 mEq three to four times a day may be necessary to maintain normal potassium levels when the potassium is <3 mEq/L.
- **6.** Potassium‐sparing diuretics should be considered in the chronic management of HF, but not acutely to raise serum potassium. The preferred drug is amiloride, which is an epithelial sodium channel blocker in cortical collecting ducts. The mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (spironolactone and eplerenone) can be considered in HF patients with normal or mildly abnormal renal function (SCr <2.5 mg/dL).
- **7.** Note that patients with uncontrolled diabetes may have movement of potassium out of cells due to insulin deficiency and hyperosmolality. Thus, the serum potassium may be elevated despite a marked potassium deficit. Aggressive treatment with insulin will lower the potassium, so potassium levels must be carefully evaluated to determine when to start replenishing potassium. If the patient has severe hyperglycemia and hypokalemia, potassium should be given prior to giving insulin, which will lower potassium levels.

#### **X. Hypocalcemia**

**A.** Calcium plays a complex role in myocardial energetics and reperfusion damage. Ionized calcium (normal = 1.1–1.3 mmol/L) should be measured because total calcium levels, which are affected by protein binding, usually decrease during surgery because of hemodilution, hypothermia, shifts in pH, hypomagnesemia, and the use of citrated blood. Hypocalcemia is usually associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG tracing. It reduces cardiac sensitivity to digoxin.

#### **B. Treatment**

- **1.** It is common practice to empirically administer a 500 mg bolus of calcium chloride at the termination of CPB to support systemic vascular resistance and possibly increase myocardial contractility.203 It may be given with protamine to offset its vasodilatory effects.204
- **2.** It is questionable whether treatment of hypocalcemia identified in the ICU is of any value in improving cardiovascular function. In fact, calcium salts may attenuate the cardiotonic effects of catecholamines, such as dobutamine or epinephrine,

although they have little effect on the efficacy of milrinone.205 Nonetheless, if the ionized calcium level is measured and found to be <1 mmol/L, calcium gluconate (10 mL of 10% solution in 50 mL D5W) may be given over 10–20 minutes, although there is no clear benefit to doing so. It may also be given as an infusion of 50 mL/h of a 10% solution (placing 100 mL in 1 L of D5W). Calcium chloride is best avoided for "asymptomatic" hypocalcemia to minimize any acute hemodynamic effects, but similar dosing is used. Because hypocalcemia can be difficult to correct if the serum magnesium level is low, an infusion of magnesium sulfate 2 g (16 mEq) of a 10% solution over 10–20 minutes may be given, with a subsequent infusion of 1 g (8 mEq) in 100 mL of fluid per hour.206

**3.** Calcium chloride (0.5–1 g IV) may be given in emergency situations to provide temporary circulatory support when a low cardiac output syndrome or profound hypotension develops suddenly. The transient improvement in hemodynamics allows time for analysis of causative factors and the institution of other pharmacologic support. It should not be given routinely during a cardiac arrest.

#### **XI. Hypomagnesemia**

- **A.** Magnesium plays a role in energy metabolism and cardiac impulse generation. Low levels have been associated with coronary spasm, low cardiac output syndromes, prolonged ventilatory support, a higher incidence of postoperative atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, perioperative infarction, and a higher mortality rate.207–210
- **B.** Magnesium levels (normal = 1.5–2 mEq/L) are usually not measured during surgery, but are reduced in the majority of patients. This is usually the result of hemodilution during CPB as well as urinary excretion, but it is also very common in patients undergoing off‐pump surgery.211 Medications contributing to low magnesium levels include diuretics and PPIs.
- **C.** Administration of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4 ) 2 g in 100 mL solution given over an hour to raise the serum level to 2 mEq/L is effective in reducing the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias after both on‐pump and off‐pump surgery.211 Notably, magnesium has been found to inhibit the vasoconstrictive response to epinephrine, but not its cardiotonic effects.212 Administering 1–2 g of MgSO4 at the conclusion of bypass and on the first postoperative morning can be recommended.
- **D.** Magnesium may be helpful in the treatment of torsades de pointes.

#### **XII. Metabolic Acidosis**

#### **A. Etiology**

- **1.** A low cardiac output state causing tissue hypoperfusion is usually the primary cause of metabolic (lactic) acidosis in the cardiac surgery patient. Poor peripheral and visceral perfusion will be exacerbated by use of vasopressors.
- **2.** Intra‐abdominal catastrophes, such as mesenteric ischemia from a low‐flow state, should always be considered when progressive metabolic acidosis occurs.
- **3.** Low‐dose epinephrine occasionally causes a metabolic acidosis out of proportion to its α effects when the cardiac output is satisfactory. This may reflect a metabolic type B lactic acidosis (not associated with tissue hypoxia) caused by metabolic factors that increase lactic acid production, such as hyperglycemia and lipolysis.213,214

- **4.** Sepsis
- **5.** High doses of sodium nitroprusside
- **6.** Renal failure (which reduces acid excretion)
- **7.** Acute hepatic dysfunction
- **8.** Diabetic ketoacidosis
- **9.** Aggressive crystalloid infusions with high chloride content (normal saline)

#### **B. Effects**

- **1.** Adverse effects of metabolic acidosis usually do not occur until the pH is less than 7.20.215,216 A primary metabolic acidosis (low serum bicarbonate with acidemic pH) may be noted in the heavily sedated patient in whom there is no respiratory compensation. However, compensatory hyperventilation to neutralize the acidosis will occur when the patient can breathe spontaneously, and for every 1 mEq/L fall in bicarbonate, the PCO2 is generally reduced about 1.2 torr. However, it is not uncommon to see incomplete compensation with a mixed respiratory/metabolic acidosis. Notably, some of the deleterious effects of metabolic acidosis may be related to the metabolic products associated with the acidosis, rather than the absolute level of pH, although they may be reversed by administration of sodium bicarbonate.
- **2.** The presence of a progressive or significant metabolic acidosis (as assessed by the serum bicarbonate level) is often an indication of a serious ongoing problem that must be corrected before adverse consequences occur. Occasionally, this may be identified surreptitiously. For example, after the patient is extubated and the arterial line has been removed, the patient may develop tachypnea of unknown etiology. An ABG or basic metabolic panel may reveal that the patient is compensating for a profound metabolic acidosis. Some adverse consequences of a metabolic acidosis include:
  - **a.** Cardiovascular effects
    - ∙ Decreased contractility and cardiac output; reduction in hepatic and renal blood flow
    - ∙ Attenuation of the positive inotropic effects of catecholamines
    - ∙ Venoconstriction and arteriolar dilatation which increase filling pressures and decrease systemic pressures
    - ∙ Increased pulmonary vascular resistance
    - ∙ Sensitization to reentrant arrhythmias and reduction in the threshold for ventricular fibrillation
  - **b.** Respiratory effects
    - ∙ Dyspnea and tachypnea
    - ∙ Decreased respiratory muscle strength
  - **c.** Metabolic changes
    - ∙ Increased metabolic demands
    - ∙ Hyperglycemia caused by tissue insulin resistance and inhibition of anaerobic glycolysis
    - ∙ Decreased hepatic update and increased hepatic production of lactate
    - ∙ Hyperkalemia
    - ∙ Increased protein catabolism

#### **d.** Cerebral function

- ∙ Inhibition of brain metabolism and cell volume regulation
- ∙ Obtundation and coma
- **3.** Type A lactic acidosis reflects impaired tissue oxygenation and anaerobic metabolism resulting from circulatory failure. The acidosis is self‐perpetuating in that excess lactate is being produced at a time when there is suppression of hepatic lactate utilization. The lactate ion, probably more than the acidosis, contributes to potential cardiovascular dysfunction. An elevated lactate level (>3 mmol/L) upon arrival in the ICU is associated with a worse outcome.217 This is more commonly noted in patients with preexisting renal dysfunction, after long pump runs, and with use of intraoperative vasopressors. It is likely that this reflects inadequate oxygen delivery during bypass that has contributed to splanchnic and renal ischemia, with the acidosis perpetuated by a low cardiac output syndrome. Needless to say, the presence of elevated lactate levels during bypass or upon arrival in the ICU requires prompt attention. The development of a metabolic acidosis several days after surgery raises the specter of mesenteric ischemia, especially in patients requiring additional days of ICU care.
- **4.** Type B lactic acidosis occurs in the absence of tissue hypoxia.213,214 It may be a catecholamine‐induced metabolic effect (especially with epinephrine) caused by hyperglycemia and alterations in fatty acid metabolism that cause pyruvate accumulation and elevated levels of lactic acid. Acute hepatic failure may also be present with severe lactic acidosis due to failure to clear lactic acid. Metformin is associated with lactic acidosis in patients with renal insufficiency, low cardiac output states, and liver disease, and with use of contrast agents.

#### **C. Assessment**

- **1.** Measurement of the anion gap (AG) is important is sorting out the etiology of acidosis (AG = Na+ − [Cl− + HCO3 ], with normal range being 10–12 mEq/L).
- **2.** Although there are a number of factors that can influence the AG, an increase in AG generally reflects additional acid production, and high AG metabolic acidosis from lactic acid accumulation is most commonly noted after cardiac surgery. It may also be elevated in diabetic ketoacidosis due to production of hydroxybutyrate, in renal failure from decreased acid excretion and increased bicarbonate excretion, and from excessive ingestion of aspirin/methanol/ethylene glycol.
- **3.** A normal or low AG represents loss of bicarbonate (diarrhea) or inability to excrete an acid load (renal tubular acidosis).
- **D. Treatment** should be directed primarily towards reversal of the underlying cause. This will allow for oxidation of lactate and regeneration of bicarbonate to correct the acidosis. Whether correction of a primary metabolic acidosis (not one that compensates for a primary respiratory alkalosis) should be considered when the serum bicarbonate is less than 15 mEq/L (base deficit greater than 8–10 mmol/L) is controversial.218–222
  - **1.** Proponents of bicarbonate administration suggest that severe metabolic acidosis does have significant deleterious effects on cardiovascular function that can be corrected with a more normal pH. Furthermore, more responsiveness to catecholamines does seem to occur with a more normal pH. Thus, correction of the

- acidosis may be important when the etiology of the acidosis is unclear or not imminently remediable.
- **2.** Others argue that the use of bicarbonate can cause metabolic derangements with little evidence of hemodynamic improvement.219,220 Sodium bicarbonate can cause fluid overload, hypernatremia, and hyperosmolarity, increased affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen (and thus less tissue release), and reduced ionized calcium, which may reduce cardiac contractility. It is proposed that bicarbonate may correct only the blood pH, not the intracellular pH, and that the increased production of CO2 that may not be eliminated in low output states may impair lactate utilization, perpetuating the elevated lactate levels.
- **3.** A randomized study of ICU patients with severe metabolic acidosis found that use of sodium bicarbonate reduced one‐month mortality only in patients with acute kidney injury, and did cause more hypernatremia and hypocalcemia.221 A clinical literature review suggested that there was little documented clinical benefit of using bicarbonate in critically ill patients with metabolic acidosis.222
- **4.** Nonetheless, if one elects to correct the pH, sodium bicarbonate is most commonly used. Tromethamine (THAM) is a good alternative in patients with hypernatremia with mixed metabolic/respiratory acidosis, but is no longer available in the USA.
  - **a. Sodium bicarbonate** is administered in a dose calculated from the following equation:

#### 0.5 body weight inkg base deficit mEq NaHCO3

This can be given either with bolus doses of 8.4% NaHCO3 (50 mEq/50 mL) or 7.5% NaHCO3 (44.6 mEq/50 mL), or preferably as an IV infusion over several hours (3 amps/1 L D5W, which provides approximately 150 mEq/L) with careful monitoring of the serum sodium concentration. Because the bicarbonate is metabolized to CO2 , this can worsen a respiratory acidosis in a patient with compromised pulmonary function.

**b. Tromethamine** 0.3 M (THAM or Tris buffer) limits CO2 generation and will not raise the serum sodium. In contrast to NaHCO3 , it does not lower serum potassium, but it can produce hypoglycemia and respiratory depression. It is usually given as a continuous infusion and is contraindicated in renal failure.223 It is still available outside of the USA and remains an essential component of Buckberg cardioplegia solutions (see Chapter 6). It may be given in a dose up to 0.5 g/kg/h.

#### kg basedeficit mL of 0.3 M THAM

- **5.** In a mechanically ventilated patient, it is not unreasonable to hyperventilate the patient to lower the PCO2 , which will increase the intracellular and extracellular pH.
- **6.** Critically ill patients with thiamine deficiency can develop lactic acidosis, which is rapidly reversed with thiamine 300 mg IV.224

#### **XIII. Metabolic Alkalosis**

#### **A. Etiology**

- **1.** Excessive diuresis, especially from the loop diuretics, which promotes hypovolemia and depletion of hydrogen ions and chloride
- **2.** Nasogastric drainage and inadequate electrolyte replacement by IV solutions
- **3.** Total parenteral nutrition with inappropriate solute composition
- **4.** Secondary as compensation for respiratory acidosis

#### **B. Pathophysiology**

- **1.** A reduction in effective circulating volume (hypovolemia) stimulates aldosterone secretion, which causes sodium retention, which then prevents excretion of sodium bicarbonate. Aldosterone also increases hydrogen secretion into the tubules, increasing bicarbonate reabsorption.
- **2.** Decreased available chloride delivered to the distal tubules results in less chloride–bicarbonate exchange and thus less bicarbonate excretion.
- **3.** Potassium depletion directly increases bicarbonate reabsorption. This shifts hydrogen into the cells in exchange for potassium, raising the plasma bicarbonate concentration, and the lower intracellular pH stimulates hydrogen secretion and bicarbonate reabsorption.

#### **C. Adverse effects**

- **1.** Lowers the serum potassium level, potentially leading to atrial and ventricular arrhythmias (especially digoxin‐induced arrhythmias) and to neuromuscular weakness.
- **2.** Has an adverse effect on the cardiovascular response to catecholamines that is comparable to that of acidosis.216
- **3.** Shifts the oxygen–hemoglobin dissociation curve to the left, impairing oxygen delivery to the tissues. This effect is offset in chronic metabolic alkalosis by an increase of 2,3‐DPG in red cells.
- **4.** Produces arteriolar constriction which can compromise cerebral and coronary perfusion. Neurologic abnormalities including headache, seizures, tetany, and lethargy may occur, probably because of the associated hypocalcemia induced by alkalosis. These effects are usually seen with a pH >7.60.
- **5.** Decreases the central respiratory drive, leading to hypoventilation, CO2 retention, and potentially hypoxemia.

#### **D. Treatment225**

- **1.** Metabolic alkalosis is sustained by volume depletion ("contraction alkalosis"), as well as by potassium and chloride depletion. Thus, therapy should be directed towards correction of these factors to improve renal excretion of bicarbonate.
- **2.** Potential contributors to alkalosis should be identified and addressed.
  - **a.** Reduce doses of loop diuretics or thiazides to avoid volume depletion. Use PPIs to minimize loss of gastric acid through a nasogastric tube.
  - **b.** Avoid lactated Ringer's solution and acetate (common in parenteral nutrition solutions) that are metabolized to bicarbonate.
- **3.** The administration of chloride, usually as potassium (KCl) or sodium (NaCl), is the primary treatment for metabolic alkalosis. The appropriate solution depends on the patient's volume status and potassium level.

- **a.** In hypovolemic patients, 0.9% NaCl is the primary replacement fluid, and KCl may also be given for hypokalemia. Volume repletion removes the stimulus for sodium reabsorption, allowing for more bicarbonate excretion. Chloride repletion increases chloride delivery to the distal tubules and augments the chloride– bicarbonate exchange mechanism. Potassium moves into cells in exchange for hydrogen ions which buffer the bicarbonate. The reduction in intracellular pH in renal tubular cells reduces hydrogen secretion and bicarbonate reabsorption.
- **b.** In patients with total body water overload, typical in the postoperative state or with HF, infusion of NaCl may exacerbate the edema. A KCl infusion is beneficial if the serum K+ is not elevated, but it can only be given at a limited rate (20 mEq/L). However, during a profound diuresis with significant potassium loss, a faster infusion rate can be used.
- **4.** Alternative means of treating alkalosis in fluid overloaded patients include the following:
  - **a. Amiloride** (5 mg daily) is a potassium‐sparing diuretic that may be helpful in improving a metabolic alkalosis. **Spironolactone** 25 mg PO qd or **eplerenone** 50 mg PO qd may also be considered, but they can quickly cause hyperkalemia in patients with HF.
  - **b. Acetazolamide** (Diamox) 250–500 mg IV can be given in conjunction with a loop diuretic to increase urine output while increasing bicarbonate excretion. Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that inhibits proximal bicarbonate reabsorption by the kidneys, but it is a weak diuretic when used alone. It can lead to potassium depletion, so normokalemia should be present before it is started.
  - **c. Hydrochloric acid** 0.1 N (100 mEq/L) may be administered through a central line at a rate of 10–20 mEq/h. It is rarely required in cardiac surgical patients. The total dose can be calculated based on a bicarbonate space of 50% body weight from either of the two following methods:
    - ∙ Chloride‐deficit method:

$$mEq\ HCl = 0.5 \times kg(IBW) \times (103 - measured\ chloride)$$

where IBW is ideal body weight.

∙ Base‐excess method:

mEq HCl = 
$$0.5 \times \text{kg(IBW)} \times (\text{serum HCO}_3^- - 24)$$

where (serum HCO3 − 24) represents the base excess. If a profound alkalosis is present, these doses should be given over 12 hours with intermittent reevaluation.

#### **XIV. Hyperglycemia**

#### **A. Etiology**

**1.** The hormonal stress response to surgery induces insulin resistance in both diabetics (who also have impaired insulin production) and nondiabetics.226 This is associated with elevated levels of the counterregulatory hormones, including cortisol, epinephrine, and growth hormone.

- **2.** Epinephrine, more so than norepinephrine, can exacerbate postoperative hyperglycemia.227
- **3.** Total parenteral nutrition with inadequate insulin response
- **4.** Sepsis (often the first manifestation of an occult sternal wound infection or an intra‐abdominal process)
- **B. Manifestations.** Intraoperative and postoperative hyperglycemia are associated with an increase in morbidity and mortality in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients.228–231 Protocols to control hyperglycemia can reduce those risks, although this benefit may be less evident in insulin‐dependent diabetics.232–235 Some of the problems associated with poorly controlled hyperglycemia include:
  - **1.** Increased urine output from an osmotic diuresis. Although the hypotonic fluid loss may cause hypernatremia, the glucose‐induced shift of water from cells into the extracellular fluid compartment may cause hyponatremia. In this situation, the plasma osmolality is elevated despite the low serum sodium, a condition treated by fluid administration, rather than restriction.
  - **2.** Impaired wound healing and increased risk of sternal wound infection. This is noted in diabetics and nondiabetics with hyperglycemia, indicating that the blood glucose level itself is an independent risk factor.236,237
  - **3.** Increased risk of atrial fibrillation, cardiac, respiratory, and renal complications.228–230
  - **4.** Worsened cognitive function, which has been noted in nondiabetics, but not in diabetics.238 However, one study found that control of hyperglycemia had no impact on neurologic or neurocognitive outcomes in nondiabetics.239
  - **5.** Postoperative delirium, which has been noted more commonly in diabetics with elevated preoperative HbA1c levels.240 Tight glucose control might actually increase the risk, but not the severity, of postoperative delirium.241

#### **C. Treatment242–245**

- **1.** Prevention of intraoperative hyperglycemia lowers the risk of infection, may lower the risk of AKI and the development of neurologic complications, and may lower mortality. Thus, it should be considered an integral component of perioperative glucose management. At the very least, IV insulin should be given during surgery to keep the blood sugar (BS) less than 180 mg/dL. Studies evaluating very stringent intra‐ and postoperative BS controls (keeping BS <100–130 mg/dL vs. <160 mg/dL) have not shown significant differences in outcomes.246,247 Although stringent BS control might lower the risk of AKI, this must be tempered with the potential for developing hypoglycemia.149 One study suggested that adverse outcomes correlated more with the preoperative HbA1c than the intraoperative blood glucose, although the latter is often more difficult to get into the target range in patients with elevated HbA1c levels.248 Another study found that elevated HbA1c levels were predictive of reduced intraoperative insulin sensitivity in diabetes.249
- **2.** In the intensive care unit, maintaining a blood glucose <180 mg/dL during the first 48 hours after surgery has been shown to reduce the risk of wound infection and mortality. This benefit has generally been shown in both diabetics and nondiabetics, although some have suggested this benefit is less in insulin‐dependent diabetics.235 It has been suggested that the percentage of time spent out of the

target range correlates best with the risk of wound infection.250 Therefore, a hyperglycemia protocol should be followed with careful monitoring of blood glucose (Appendix 6). Novolin R is the usual preparation used for IV boluses and infusions. An intravenous bolus of insulin is rapidly cleared from the blood and may lower the potassium level without affecting the blood glucose. Therefore, a bolus followed by an infusion (using a mix of 100 units of regular insulin/100 mL normal saline) is recommended. Excessively stringent control (keeping glucose <120 mg/dL) is potentially dangerous and probably not necessary.

- **3.** All diabetic patients should have a fingerstick blood glucose drawn before meals and at bedtime once they are started on an oral diet. The glucose level may be higher than suspected from the patient's oral intake because of the residual elevation of counterregulatory hormones from the operation. On the other hand, the blood glucose may remain acceptable without medications in some patients with poor oral intake.
- **4.** Patients with type I diabetes mellitus should have their insulin doses gradually increased back to preoperative levels depending on blood glucose levels and early postoperative insulin requirements. It is preferable to use a lower dose of intermediate or long‐acting insulin initially (usually one‐half of the usual dose) and supplement it with regular insulin as necessary (Table 12.9). Insulin doses may be increased when the patient becomes more active and has an improved caloric intake.
- **5.** In type II diabetics, oral hypoglycemic medications should be restarted once the patient is taking a normal diet, with frequent checking of fingersticks to assess the adequacy of blood glucose control. Additional coverage may be given with regular insulin (Novolin R). If blood glucose is not well controlled postoperatively, or in patients with preoperative HbA1c levels >7, an endocrine consultation should be considered to initiate the patient on insulin therapy.
- **D. Hyperosmolar, hyperglycemic, nonketotic coma** has been reported in type II diabetics following surgery. It commonly develops 4–7 days after surgery and is manifested by polyuria in association with a rising BUN or serum sodium. The resultant dehydration, often exacerbated by GI bleeding or use of high‐nitrogen, hyperosmolar tube feedings, results in the hyperosmolar state.251 Gradual correction of hypovolemia, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, and hypernatremia is indicated. Consultation with an endocrinologist is important in the assessment and management of these patients.
- **E. Diabetic ketoacidosis** is rarely seen following cardiac surgery, but may be noted in type I diabetics. An endocrine consultation and standard management with saline infusions, an insulin drip, and correction of potassium and acid–base abnormalities should be followed.
- **F. Note: hypoglycemia** is extremely uncommon after open‐heart surgery. Possible causes include:
  - **1.** Administration of excessive doses of insulin (either SC or as a continuous infusion). Repeating a blood glucose level every two hours is essential in patients on a continuous infusion, especially at high rates.
  - **2.** Premature resumption of preoperative insulin or oral hypoglycemic drug doses in patients with poor oral food intake
  - **3.** Residual effects of oral hypoglycemic agents in patients with renal dysfunction
  - **4.** A severe hepatic insult with impaired glucose production

#### **XV. Hypothyroidism**

- **A.** Hypothyroidism is difficult to treat preoperatively in the patient with ischemic heart disease because thyroid hormone replacement may precipitate ischemic symptoms. Even so, it may be present more often than realized even in patients taking thyroid hormone. It may be present more often than realized in patients taking thyroid hormone replacement. One study showed a significantly greater operative mortality in patients taking thyroxine preoperatively, perhaps for this reason.252 Nonetheless, cardiac surgery is well tolerated in most patients with mild–moderate hypothyroidism.
- **B.** Serum total and free triiodothyronine (T3 and free T3 ) are significantly reduced after both on‐ and off‐pump surgery and remain low for up to six days, whereas thyroxine (T4 ) is low immediately after surgery, but returns to normal within 24 hours.253–255 There is some evidence that patients with low T3 levels preoperatively are more prone to the "nonthyroidal illness syndrome" and to a low cardiac output state after surgery. Furthermore, a prolonged reduction in the conversion of T4 to T3 may account for the slower recovery of some patients after surgery. Patients with this syndrome may not feel that well, but there is generally little physiologic impact on cardiac function.256,257

<sup>2</sup>Onset, peak, and duration may vary depending in part on dose and patient activity Humulin products made by Lilly; Novolin products made by Novo Nordisk; Lantus made by Sanofi Aventis

- **C.** Patients with significant hypothyroidism may be somewhat lethargic and hypotensive from decreased myocardial contractility and bradycardia. They may occasionally have difficulty weaning from the ventilator.258
- **D.** Note that amiodarone is associated with thyroid dysfunction in 15–20% of patients. It can cause iodine‐induced hyperthyroidism or destructive thyroiditis and hypothyroidism.259 Therefore, it is essential that thyroid function tests be obtained in any patient taking amiodarone prior to surgery. For patients who will be given short‐ term amiodarone for atrial fibrillation prophylaxis (<1 month) it is not unreasonable to check thyroid function tests prior to surgery, although it is probably not necessary in the absence of known thyroid disease.

#### **E. Treatment**

- **1.** Should postcardiotomy ventricular dysfunction occur, triiodothyronine (T3 ) in a dose of 10–20 μg can be given in conjunction with an inotrope, such as milrinone, which does not depend on β‐receptors for its action.260
- **2.** For the hypothyroid patient who has tolerated surgery uneventfully, treatment is initiated postoperatively with levothyroxine (Synthroid) 50 μg PO qd and subsequently increased depending on TSH and T4 levels. If the patient is unable to take oral medications, one‐half of the oral dose can be given intravenously.
- **3.** If the patient is severely hypothyroid, consultation with an endocrinologist is imperative. Doses of T4 that have been recommended include an initial IV dose of 0.4 mg, followed by three days of 0.1–0.2 mg IV daily, and then a maintenance dose of 50 μg PO qd.

#### **XVI. Adrenal Insufficiency**

- **A.** CPB causes an elevation in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) which returns to baseline soon thereafter. However, cortisol levels tend to remain elevated and this has been linked to an increased risk of cognitive dysfunction.261,262
- **B.** Adrenal insufficiency is a rare complication of cardiac surgery that may result from adrenal hemorrhage associated with heparinization (or other anticoagulation) and the hormonal stress response in an elderly patient.
- **C.** Manifestations include flank pain, nonspecific GI complaints (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, ileus, abdominal pain, or distention), fever, and delirium. Late signs include hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and hypotension with poor response to vasopressors. The clinical scenario can be confused with sepsis. One study suggested that persistent vasopressor‐dependent hypotension was in fact associated with "relative adrenal insufficiency" and was present in more than 50% of patients following cardiac surgery performed on‐pump.263
- **D.** Diagnosis is confirmed by a low serum cortisol level and failure of cortisol levels to rise one hour after a 0.25 mg IV dose of cosyntropin (a synthetic ACTH analog). The level should rise fourfold or to a level greater than 20 mg/mL.
- **E.** Treatment is with 100 mg of hydrocortisone IV every eight hours along with administration of glucose and normal saline. If an additional mineralocorticoid is needed, fludrocortisone 0.05–0.2 mg qd can be given.

#### **XVII. Pituitary Abnormalities**

- **A. Pituitary apoplexy264–267**
  - **1. Etiology.** This rare phenomenon results from infarction of a pituitary tumor due to ischemia, edema, or hemorrhage. The risk is exacerbated by use of CPB with heparinization and reduced cerebral blood flow. If the patient has a pituitary adenoma, off‐pump surgery should be considered.266
  - **2. Presentation.** Compression of the optic chiasm and parasellar structures results in ophthalmoplegia, a third nerve palsy, visual loss, and headache. An Addisonian crisis may be precipitated by the hypopituitarism.267

#### **3. Treatment**

- **a.** Decrease intracerebral edema with hyperventilation, mannitol, and steroids (dexamethasone 10 mg q6h).
- **b.** Consider urgent hypophysectomy if no improvement.
- **B. Diabetes insipidus** (DI) is a rare complication of cardiac surgery caused by diminished production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). It has been noted in patients taking lithium preoperatively for depression.268 The presence of polyuria, a urine osmolarity of 50–100 mOsm/L, and hypernatremia should raise suspicion of the diagnosis. Treatment of central DI involves use of desmopressin, administered either intranasally (1–2 sprays = 10–20 μg) at bedtime or 0.05–0.4 mg PO bid. This is not effective in nephrogenic DI, which is usually treated with nonhormonal therapy.

# **13** Post‐ICU Care and Other Complications

#### **I. General Comments**

- **A.** Following a brief stay in the intensive care unit, most patients undergoing cardiac surgical procedures follow a routine pattern of recovery. The use of fast‐track protocols and critical care pathways ensures that the healthcare team and the patient have a clear understanding of what to expect at different junctures during recovery. These pathways are designed to standardize care and identify variances from the expected. However, they are not a substitute for careful patient evaluation, which may identify problems that might otherwise be ignored by rigid adherence to protocols.
- **B.** Most patients are transferred to an intermediate care unit or the postoperative cardiac surgical floor on the first postoperative day. Invasive monitoring is no longer utilized, although bedside telemetry should be considered for several days to identify arrhythmias. It should be remembered that patients are still in an early phase of recovery from surgery with many physiologic derangements still present. Restoring the patient to a normal physiologic state requires careful attention to the prevention, identification, and treatment of complications that may develop at any time during the hospital stay. A detailed daily examination of the patient must be performed, with particular attention paid to each organ system. Although pre‐printed or computerized order sets are available upon transfer, orders must be thought out carefully and individualized to ensure the best possible postoperative care.
- **C.** Although postoperative complications are more common in elderly patients and those with comorbidities, they may still develop unpredictably in low‐risk, healthy patients despite an uneventful surgical procedure and early postoperative course. Problems such as atrial arrhythmias are very common and quite benign, with little influence on the patient's hospital course or long‐term prognosis. In contrast, less common complications, such as stroke, mediastinitis, tamponade, renal failure, or an acute abdomen, may be devastating, resulting in early death or prolonged hospitalization with multisystem organ failure.

#### **II. Transfer from the ICU and Postoperative Routines**

The patient recovering uneventfully from open‐heart surgery is usually extubated within 6–8 hours and off all inotropic support by the first postoperative morning. The following interventions represent standardized steps in a critical care pathway which are applicable to most patients (Table 13.1). In more critically ill patients who may require an additional period of ventilatory or pharmacologic support, adherence to these time‐related recommendations may need to be modified, and withdrawal of "intensive care" must be carefully

not be taken lightly because they may indicate the presence of potentially serious problems that warrant investigation. Careful questioning and examination of the patient on a daily or more frequent basis can prioritize diagnoses, direct the evaluation, and lead to prompt and appropriate treatment.

#### **A. Chest pain**

- **1. Differential diagnosis.** The development of chest pain following cardiac surgery often raises the suspicion of myocardial ischemia, but the differential diagnosis must include several other potential causes. The greatest fear to a patient is that the recurrence of chest pain indicates a failed operation; the surgeon meanwhile may purposely try to provide an alternative explanation. Although musculoskeletal pain is the most common cause of chest discomfort, significant problems that must be considered include:
  - ∙ Myocardial ischemia
  - ∙ Pericarditis

- ∙ Arrhythmias
- ∙ Pneumothorax
- ∙ Pneumonia
- ∙ Pulmonary embolism
- ∙ Sternal wound infection
- ∙ Aortic dissection
- ∙ Gastroesophageal reflux
- **2. Evaluation.** Careful physical examination (breath sounds, pericardial rub, sternal wound), a chest x‐ray, and 12‐lead ECG will usually provide the appropriate diagnosis and direct additional testing. Differentiation of ST‐segment elevation related to ischemia vs. pericarditis is important and can be difficult to make (Figures 8.2 and 8.3, pages 384 and 385). Consultation with the cardiology service is essential in managing patients with a suspected cardiac origin to their chest pain. Stress imaging or even coronary angiography may be warranted. Other diagnostic modalities include echocardiography, computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography to rule out pulmonary embolism, and sternal wound aspiration.

#### **B. Shortness of breath**

- **1. Differential diagnosis.** Shortness of breath is usually caused by splinting from chest wall discomfort and is not uncommon in the anemic patient with underlying lung disease. However, significant shortness of breath, its acute onset, or deterioration in pulmonary status should raise awareness of a significant problem. The source may be of a primary pulmonary nature, but it may also be the consequence of cardiac dysfunction or oliguric acute kidney injury (AKI). Diagnoses to be considered include:
  - **a.** Pleuropulmonary problems
    - ∙ Atelectasis and hypoxia from mucus plugging or poor inspiratory effort
    - ∙ Pneumothorax
    - ∙ Pneumonia (possibly aspiration)
    - ∙ Bronchospasm
    - ∙ An enlarging pleural effusion
    - ∙ Pulmonary embolism
  - **b.** Cardiopulmonary problems low cardiac output states or acute pulmonary edema caused by:
    - ∙ Acute myocardial ischemia or infarction
    - ∙ Cardiac tamponade
    - ∙ Residual or new‐onset mitral regurgitation (ischemic, associated with systemic hypertension) or a recurrent ventricular septal defect
    - ∙ Fluid overload from surgery or heart failure, often associated with oliguric AKI
    - ∙ Severe diastolic dysfunction
    - ∙ Atrial or ventricular tachyarrhythmias
  - **c.** Compensatory response to metabolic acidosis (low cardiac output state)
  - **d.** Sepsis

**2. Evaluation.** Careful lung examination may reveal absent breath sounds or diffuse rales/rhonchi, suggesting a parenchymal process, a pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. Clinical evidence of cardiac tamponade (muffled heart sounds, orthostatic blood pressure changes, pulsus paradoxus) should be sought. An arterial blood gas (ABG), chest x‐ray, and ECG should be obtained. An echocardiogram gives an assessment of ventricular function, detects valve dysfunction or recurrent shunting, and may also identify a large left pleural or pericardial effusion or tamponade. A CT pulmonary angiogram should be performed if pulmonary embolism is suspected.

#### **C. Fever**

- **1. Differential diagnosis.** Fever is very common during the first 48–72 hours after surgery. Initially, it may be related to the systemic inflammatory response or cytokine release from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), but subsequently is usually ascribed to atelectasis from poor inspiratory effort after extubation. Thorough evaluation of recurrent fevers is warranted after the first 72 hours.1,2 Potential causes of postoperative fever include:
  - ∙ Atelectasis or pneumonia
  - ∙ Urinary tract infection (UTI)
  - ∙ Wound infections: sternum or leg
  - ∙ *Clostridium difficile* colitis or other intra‐abdominal process
  - ∙ Sinusitis (usually in patients with indwelling endotracheal or nasogastric tubes)
  - ∙ Catheter sepsis
  - ∙ Endocarditis (especially on a prosthetic valve)
  - ∙ Decubitus ulcer
  - ∙ Drug fever
  - ∙ Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism
  - ∙ Postpericardiotomy syndrome (PPS)
- **2. Evaluation.** The lungs, chest, and leg incisions should be examined carefully. A CBC with differential, chest x‐ray, urinalysis, and appropriate cultures should be performed. A stool sample for *C. difficile* should be obtained if the patient has abdominal pain or diarrhea. Indwelling central and arterial lines should be cultured and removed if in place for more than five days or if cultures return positive. If the WBC is normal or there is an eosinophilia, a drug fever may be present. Occult sternal infections may be investigated with a chest CT scan, but results are usually nonspecific; needle aspiration may be performed if suspicion is high. Head CT scans can identify sinusitis. A transesophageal echocardiogram can evaluate the heart valves for vegetations consistent with endocarditis.
- **3. Treatment.** It is best to defer antibiotic therapy until an organism has been identified. However, a broad‐spectrum antibiotic may be initiated based on the presumed source and organisms involved as soon as cultures have been obtained. This is especially important in patients who have received prosthetic material (valves, grafts). A more narrow‐spectrum antibiotic may be substituted subsequently. Empiric oral

vancomycin (125 mg four times a day) may be started for suspected *C. difficile* colitis. Occasionally a patient will have a fever and elevated WBC with no evident source, but will respond to a brief course of antibiotics. Further comments on nosocomial infections and sepsis can be found on pages 776–778.

#### **IV. Respiratory Care and Complications3,4**

- **A.** Respiratory function is still impaired when the patient is transferred to the postoperative floor, with many patients exhibiting shortness of breath with some splinting from chest wall discomfort. Arterial desaturation is not uncommon, and all patients should have an arterial saturation measured several times daily by pulse oximetry until the SaO2 remains above 90%. It is not uncommon to see significant desaturation when the patient becomes more ambulatory. Most patients have some degree of fluid overload and require diuresis, and steps must be taken to overcome a poor inspiratory effort and atelectasis. Potential complications, such as pneumonia, bronchospasm, pleural effusions, or pneumothorax, can be identified by examination and a chest x‐ray (Table 13.3). Standard orders should include:
  - **1.** Supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula at 2–6 L/min on the postoperative floor. In the ICU, high flow oxygen systems or BPAP are useful for hypoxemia, but after transfer to the floor, if the patient requires more than supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula or facemask to achieve an acceptable oxygen saturation, they should probably be transferred back to an ICU setting for more intensive respiratory care.
  - **2.** Frequent use of incentive spirometry to encourage deep breathing
  - **3.** Progressive mobilization
  - **4.** Provision of adequate, but not excessive, analgesia. Patient‐controlled analgesia (usually morphine) is particularly beneficial for one or two days following surgery, and may be supplemented with other pain medications, such as ketorolac (Toradol) 15–30 mg IV q6h for a few days. In patients with abnormal renal function, IV acetaminophen is beneficial in the ICU. Most patients obtain adequate analgesia with oral medications 2–3 days after surgery and seem to do better with regular, rather than prn, pain medications.

- Hypoxemic/hypercapneic respiratory failure/ARDS
- Pulmonary embolism
- Diaphragmatic dysfunction (phrenic nerve paresis)
- Chylothorax

- **5.** Bronchodilators administered via nebulizers should be used if copious secretions or bronchospasm are present (see pages 503–504). These commonly include albuterol, levalbuterol (Xopenex), or a combination of albuterol and ipratropium (Duoneb). Chest physical therapy may benefit patients having difficulty raising secretions.
- **6.** Measures to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism (antiembolism stockings, sequential compression devices, subcutaneous heparin or low‐molecular‐weight heparin [LMWH]) should be considered depending on the patient's mobility and risk (see section E on pages 750–752).
- **7.** Patients with a history of obstructive sleep apnea should utilize CPAP machines at night or any other device that has been helpful to them prior to surgery.
- **B.** Patients with preexisting lung disease and a history of heavy smoking often have a tenuous respiratory status postoperatively with borderline oxygenation, and acute decompensation can occur with little provocation, including ambulation. Mucus plugging, atelectasis from poor inspiratory effort, mobilization of "third space" fluid, or even a minor cardiac event can cause arterial desaturation and respiratory distress. In patients without significant underlying lung disease, acute decompensation usually indicates the presence of a significant process, such as a pleuropulmonary event (significant pneumothorax, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism), myocardial ischemia, worsening mitral regurgitation, cardiac tamponade, or acute fluid overload from AKI with oliguria.
- **C.** The management of respiratory insufficiency, pneumothorax, pleural effusions, and bronchospasm is discussed in Chapter 10. Other complications, including diaphragmatic dysfunction from phrenic nerve paresis and pulmonary embolism, are discussed below.
- **D. Diaphragmatic dysfunction** from phrenic nerve injury has been noted in 10–20% of patients following open‐heart surgery.5

#### **1. Etiology and prevention**

- **a.** Cold injury to the phrenic nerve from use of iced saline slush in the pericardial well is the primary cause of this problem. Systemic hypothermia may also be contributory. Use of insulation cooling pads that protect the phrenic nerve from cold solutions, minimizing systemic hypothermia, intermittently pouring cold saline over the heart (the "shallow technique"), and avoiding iced slush reduce the incidence of phrenic nerve paresis.6–8
- **b.** The phrenic nerve may be injured directly during dissection of the internal thoracic artery (ITA) in the upper mediastinum, especially on the right side. It may also be damaged when making a V‐incision in the pericardium to allow for better lie of the ITA pedicle. Phrenic nerve devascularization with compromise of the pericardiophrenic artery may also be contributory, especially in patients with diabetes.9

#### **2. Presentation**

- **a.** Most patients with unilateral phrenic nerve paresis have few respiratory symptoms and are extubated uneventfully. Difficulty weaning, shortness of breath, and the requirement for reintubation may be noted in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
- **b.** Bilateral phrenic nerve palsy usually produces tachypnea, paradoxical abdominal breathing, and CO2 retention during attempts to wean from mechanical ventilation.

#### **3. Evaluation**

- **a.** A chest x‐ray will demonstrate an elevated hemidiaphragm at end‐expiration during spontaneous ventilation, most commonly on the left side. This will not be evident during mechanical ventilation. An elevated hemidiaphragm may be difficult to appreciate if basilar atelectasis or a pleural effusion is present. Therefore, when planning a thoracentesis or tube thoracostomy for a pleural effusion, one must always consider the possibility of an obscured, elevated hemidiaphragm. The position of the gastric bubble on chest x‐ray should identify the position of the diaphragm on the left. If the diaphragm is elevated, one might inadvertently insert a needle below the diaphragm, risking injury to intra‐abdominal structures.
- **b.** Diaphragmatic fluoroscopy ("sniff test") will demonstrate paradoxical upward motion of the diaphragm during spontaneous inspiration if unilateral paralysis is present.
- **c.** Ultrasonography will show a hypokinetic, immobile, or paradoxically moving diaphragm during respiration.
- **d.** Transcutaneous phrenic nerve stimulation in the neck with recording of diaphragmatic potentials over the seventh and eighth intercostal spaces can measure phrenic nerve conduction velocities and latency times.10 This is helpful in assessing whether phrenic nerve dysfunction may be a contributing factor to a patient's respiratory problems.
- **e.** Transdiaphragmatic pressure measurements can be used to make the diagnosis in patients with bilateral phrenic nerve palsies.11
- **4. Treatment** is supportive until phrenic nerve function recovers, which may take up to two years. One study of patients with COPD found that nearly 25% of patients had persistent pulmonary problems with a decreased quality of life at midterm follow‐up.12 Diaphragmatic plication can provide significant symptomatic and objective improvement in patients with marked dyspnea. This can be performed robotically or via a thoracotomy (video‐assisted [VATS] or open) or laparoscopically.13 Ventilatory support is usually necessary for patients with bilateral involvement. Some patients can be managed at home with a cuirass respirator or a rocking bed.
- **E. Venous thromboembolism** (VTE) is a term that describes both deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and **pulmonary embolism** (PE). Screening noninvasive studies have documented a 15–20% incidence of DVT and a 6–20% incidence of PE after cardiac surgical procedures, with both being more common after OPCAB.14,15 However, symptomatic VTE is noted in only about 1–2% of patients.16,17 One study of routine CT pulmonary angiography and lower‐extremity venous studies in patients undergoing elective CABGs and considered at low risk for VTE reported a 21% incidence of DVT, and in more than half of these patients, PE occurred in the absence of lower‐extremity DVT.18
  - **1.** It has been presumed, perhaps inappropriately so, that the risk of postoperative VTE is low because of heparinization and hemodilution during surgery and the presence of thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction in the early postoperative period. However, platelet activity is increased immediately after surgery, and elevated fibrinogen levels, thrombin generation, tissue factor activation, and reduced fibrinolysis are also noted. Increased platelet reactivity and aspirin resistance are

particularly common after off‐pump surgery, although the risk of symptomatic VTE is still only 1%.19–22 A study of patients undergoing on‐pump CABGs found that the absorption of aspirin was reduced early after surgery, leading to reduced antiplatelet effect that could contribute to VTE.23 Thus low‐dose aspirin may not be sufficient to inhibit platelet aggregation early after surgery, although this may impact graft patency more than the risk of VTE.

- **2. Risk factors** for VTE in the perioperative period include older age, obesity (BMI >30), right‐ or left‐heart failure, a history of VTE, prolonged bed rest and immobility, prolonged ventilation, multiple blood and blood product transfusions, and the occurrence of significant postoperative complications, including acute kidney injury, infection/sepsis, and neurological complications.17,24,25 VTE may result from heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and may occur several weeks later.
- **3. Prevention.** Numerous studies have evaluated the use of mechanical or pharmacologic prophylaxis from which general recommendations can be made.25–27
  - **a.** Early mobilization is the most important factor in reducing the risk of VTE. Once the patient is stable, getting them out of bed and ambulating several times a day is very important. Having a patient sit in a chair is the least desirable position.
  - **b.** Elastic graduated compression stockings (GCS), such as T.E.D. stockings, should be placed after the initial leg dressing and ace wraps are removed, and should be placed on both legs. Use of sequential compression devices (SCDs) or intermittent pneumatic compression devices (IPCs) in well‐mobilized ambulatory patients provides little additional benefit to use of GCS alone.26,27
  - **c.** Although increased platelet reactivity and aggregation are present in postoperative patients, most patients are usually given aspirin 81 mg daily after surgery. This dose is insufficient to inhibit platelet aggregation and probably provides little benefit in reducing the risk of VTE.20 One study did demonstrate, however, that the addition of low‐dose aspirin to heparin 5000 units SC q8h reduced the risk of VTE nearly fivefold in patients undergoing OPCAB.28
  - **d.** ICU patients may be maintained at bedrest because of ongoing clinical issues and are usually poorly mobilized. For these patients as well as those with the risk factors listed above in section E.2, pharmacologic prophylaxis should be considered in addition to compression devices. One study found the combination of heparin plus one of these devices reduced the risk of PE by 60% compared with heparin alone,29 although another study of ICU patients found no added benefit of IPC when the patient was already receiving heparin.30 Nonetheless, the literature remains controversial on whether early initiation of pharmacologic prophylaxis with either SQ heparin (5000 units SC q12h) or LMWH (40 mg SC daily) should be considered in these patients and when it should be started. Some authors recommend initiating one of these medications on the first postoperative day once mediastinal bleeding has tapered off,24,25,31 but other guidelines have concluded that the bleeding risk outweighs the early benefits.32 The risk of developing a hemopericardium leading to cardiac tamponade must always be taken into consideration when deciding whether to initiate heparin early after surgery.

- **4. Manifestations.** Pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath with hypoxemia are usually present. The acute onset of these symptoms distinguishes them from typical postoperative respiratory symptoms. The new onset of atrial fibrillation (AF), sinus tachycardia, or fever of unknown origin may be clues to the diagnosis. Calf tenderness and edema are unreliable signs of DVT, especially in the leg from which the vein has been harvested. However, the new development of such findings several days to weeks after surgery should prompt further evaluation.
- **5. Assessment.** ABGs, a chest x‐ray, ECG, and CT pulmonary angiography should be obtained. The presence of a low arterial oxygen saturation is nonspecific, but may be compared with values obtained earlier in the postoperative course. A positive venous noninvasive study of the lower extremities in association with respiratory symptoms and hypoxia is suggestive evidence of a pulmonary embolism and should prompt further evaluation. A falling platelet count with VTE mandates evaluation for HIT, for which alternative anticoagulation should be initiated.
- **6. Treatment.** Traditionally, IV heparin has been recommended for 1 week (unless HIT is present), followed by warfarin for six months. However, equally effective therapy can be achieved with the use of a non‐vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC), such as apixaban (10 mg bid × 1 week, then 5 mg bid) or rivaroxaban (15 mg bid × 3 weeks, then 20 mg daily) – doses conditional upon renal function – and these medications do not require blood monitoring. Early ambulation has not been shown to increase the risk of extending the DVT or developing pulmonary embolism, although bedrest was traditionally considered part of routine management.33,34 An inferior vena cava filter should be placed if anticoagulation is contraindicated. Systemic thrombolytic therapy should be avoided because of the recent sternotomy incision, although ultrasound‐assisted catheter‐directed thrombolysis using the EKOS system might be considered.35,36 Other interventional methods, including suction embolectomy and fragmentation therapy, may be beneficial in patients with massive PE,37 reserving surgery for salvage situations to avoid a redo sternotomy and pump run. However, surgical pulmonary embolectomy may be applicable to hemodynamically stable patients with massive PE and may be preferable in the rare patient with massive pulmonary embolism early after cardiac surgery, when thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated.38,39

#### **V. Cardiac Care and Complications**

- **A.** Upon transfer to the postoperative floor, the patient should be attached to a telemetry system to continuously monitor the heart rate and rhythm for several days. Vital signs are obtained every shift if the patient is stable, but more frequently if the patient's heart rate, rhythm, or blood pressure is abnormal or marginal.
- **B.** The evaluation and management of complications noted most frequently in the intensive care unit are presented in Chapter 11. These include low cardiac output states, perioperative infarction, cardiac arrest, coronary spasm, hypertension, and arrhythmias. This section will discuss several cardiac problems commonly noted during subsequent convalescence (Table 13.4).

#### **C. Arrhythmias and conduction problems**

**1. Atrial arrhythmias** are the most common complication of open‐heart surgery and occur with a peak incidence on the second or third postoperative day. Although

#### **Table 13.4 • Cardiac Complications of Cardiac Surgery**

- Atrial and ventricular arrhythmias
- Low cardiac output syndrome: RV dysfunction, LV systolic or diastolic dysfunction
- Myocardial ischemia/infarction
- Coronary vasospasm
- Hypertension
- Hypotension
- Cardiac tamponade: early or delayed
- Acute pericarditis
- Postpericardiotomy syndrome
- Cardiac arrest
- Constrictive pericarditis (late)

some patients become symptomatic with lightheadedness, fatigue, or palpitations, many have no symptoms and are noted to be in AF or flutter on telemetry monitoring. Treatment entails rate control, attempted conversion to sinus rhythm, and anticoagulation if AF persists or recurs. Management protocols are discussed in detail on pages 626–632 and in Table 11.15 (page 627).

- **2. Ventricular arrhythmias** are always of concern because they may be attributable to myocardial ischemia or infarction and may herald cardiac arrest. Low‐grade ectopy or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) with normal ventricular function does not require aggressive therapy and may be managed with a ß‐blocker. In contrast, VT with impaired LV function requires further evaluation and may benefit from placement of an implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator (ICD). An echocardiogram should be considered and may identify new regional wall motion abnormalities attributable to a perioperative infarction, which may account for the arrhythmia. On occasion, when epicardial wires are still connected to a temporary pacemaker, VT may develop due to improper sensing, with inadvertent firing on the T wave triggering the malignant arrhythmias ("R on T" phenomenon).
- **3. Conduction abnormalities and heart block** (see pages 614–618). Temporary pacemaker wires are routinely removed by the third postoperative day unless there is evidence of symptomatic sinus bradycardia, lengthy sinus pauses, advanced degrees of heart block, or a slow ventricular response to AF. If these issues are present, medications that reduce atrial automaticity or reduce AV conduction (β‐ blockers, amiodarone, calcium‐channel blockers [CCBs], and digoxin) should be stopped. If they persist, permanent pacemaker implantation should be considered.
  - **a.** New bundle branch or fascicular blocks have been noted in up to 45% of patients after CABG and appear to correlate with longer aortic cross‐clamp times. However, they resolve in more than half of the patients before discharge.40,41
  - **b.** Patients with sick sinus or tachycardia/bradycardia syndrome may have a rapid ventricular response to AF intermixed with a slow sinus mechanism that limits use of ß‐blockers. A permanent pacemaker (PPM) system should be considered if these problems persist beyond three days. Studies have shown, however, that pacemaker dependence usually resolves within a few months, unless the indication was complete heart block.42

- **c.** Patients undergoing aortic valve surgery are more prone to conduction disturbances and heart block because of debridement, edema, hemorrhage, or suturing near the conduction system. The average incidence of PPM is 5–9% after AVR,43,44 but it is greater in patients receiving rapid deployment valves.45 Preoperative conduction system disease (first‐degree block, left anterior hemiblock, right bundle branch block [RBBB], or left bundle branch block [LBBB]) is generally the major risk factor for the development of heart block using both traditional and rapid deployment valves. Both the development of a new postoperative LBBB and the necessity for a permanent pacemaker early after AVR have adverse prognostic significance with a compromise in long‐term survival.46,47
- **d.** When pacemaker wires are removed, there is always the potential for bleeding and the development of tamponade. It is recommended that they be removed when the INR is less than 2, but this does not eliminate the possibility of bleeding. If the INR remains persistently elevated, the wires may be cut and left behind. After removal, the patient should remain at bedrest for one hour and vital signs should be taken every 15 minutes for the first hour and then hourly for a few hours to monitor for orthostatic changes. Tamponade can occur within minutes or hours and can prove fatal unless the possibility is entertained and addressed on an urgent, if not emergent, basis. If concern is raised because of hypotension or a complaint of chest pain, a STAT echocardiogram may be helpful. Emergency thoracotomy at the bedside may be life‐saving.
- **e.** A transfemoral temporary pacing wire may be retained at the conclusion of a TAVR procedure if the heart rate is very slow or there is evidence of advanced heart block. The latter is more likely to develop in patients with a preexisting RBBB and first‐degree AV block.
  - **i.** If the heart rate stabilizes above 50–60/min and there is no evidence of complete heart block, the wire may be removed several hours later or the following morning. Despite this common practice, some patients with these preexisting conduction abnormalities may still develop delayed heart block (>48 hours later). If heart block persists, permanent pacemaker implantation may be necessary. Guidelines for management of conduction disturbances after TAVR are noted on page 615.48 One study found that only 21% of patients receiving a PPM after TAVR were pacer‐dependent at one year; however, pacer dependence was more common with use of self‐expanding valves and post‐balloon dilatation, or when complete heart block was the indication for the PPM.49
  - **ii.** When the transvenous pacing wire and the 6 Fr transfemoral sheath are removed from the femoral vein after a TAVR, persistent bleeding may occur despite a short period of manual pressure, because antiplatelet therapy is routinely administered within a few hours of the procedure. If this persists, simply suturing the skin entrance site and applying a sandbag are usually effective in controlling the bleeding.
- **D. Hypertension.** When the patient is transferred to the postoperative floor, oral antihypertensive medications must be substituted for the potent intravenous drugs used in the ICU. Blood pressure tends to return to its preoperative level several days after surgery once myocardial function has returned to baseline, the patient has been mobilized, and chest wall pain improves with moderate analgesia. Aggressive patient‐specific

management is important to prevent issues related to blood pressure variability. For example, a patient with renal dysfunction may need a slightly higher blood pressure to ensure renal perfusion. In contrast, more strict control of blood pressure may be essential in an elderly patient with fragile tissues or in patients with perioperative bleeding. Not only can hypertension increase cardiac wall stress and cause myocardial ischemia, but it may increase any residual mitral regurgitation and can precipitate an aortic dissection from graft or cannulation sites.

- **1.** A decrease in systolic blood pressure from preoperative levels may be noted in patients who are hypovolemic or anemic, or have experienced a perioperative infarction. In these patients, preoperative antihypertensive medications can be withheld and then restarted at lower doses when the blood pressure increases. In contrast, patients who have ongoing pain issues or have undergone an AVR for aortic stenosis may develop significant systolic hypertension.
- **2.** ß‐blockers are recommended for virtually all patients after surgery as prophylaxis against AF and can be titrated up to control the heart rate and blood pressure as well. Resumption of the patient's preoperative medications should then be instituted to optimize blood pressure control. Other considerations when selecting an antihypertensive medication include the following:
  - **a.** Poor ventricular function (EF <40%): use one of the ACE inhibitors or ARBs. A ß‐blocker, preferably carvedilol, should also be given in this situation, but must be used cautiously if the patient has decompensated heart failure or a low output syndrome.
  - **b.** Sinus tachycardia with good LV function, or with evidence of residual myocardial ischemia: use higher doses of a ß‐blocker (metoprolol) or labetalol.
  - **c.** Coronary spasm or use of a radial artery graft: use a nitrate or CCB (amlodipine, diltiazem, or nicardipine).
  - **d.** Sinus bradycardia with good LV function: if initial use of an ACE inhibitor or ARB is insufficient, amlodipine should be considered.
- **E. Hypotension** may develop after transfer to the floor and should be evaluated using the differential diagnosis of shock or a low cardiac output state (see Chapter 11).
  - **1. Etiology.** The possibility of a significant clinical condition should always be considered in a patient with hypotension, although transient hypotension is usually of a benign etiology. It is best to correlate the patient's cuff pressure with an arterial line pressure in the ICU before the catheter is removed, because a significant discrepancy can confound interpretation of cuff pressures on the postoperative floor. Concerns must always include the possibility of hypoxemia, myocardial ischemia/infarction with cardiogenic shock, an aortic dissection (if discrepant upper extremity pulses), sepsis, and especially delayed **tamponade** (see section G, pages 757–761). However, the more common causes of hypotension several days after surgery include:
    - ∙ Hypovolemia, usually from aggressive diuresis
    - ∙ Profound anemia
    - ∙ β‐blockers or amiodarone used prophylactically to prevent AF
    - ∙ Significant bradycardia
    - ∙ Arrhythmias, especially a rapid ventricular response to AF/flutter and then the medications used to treat them, which usually lower the blood pressure (β‐blockers, CCBs, amiodarone)

- ∙ Vasoplegia from the residual effects of the systemic inflammatory response from CPB or from a diabetic autonomic neuropathy
- ∙ Initiating too high a dose of the patient's preoperative medications. Often the patient's initial postoperative hypertension is related to pain and sympathetic overactivity, and once these resolve, hypotension may result, necessitating fluid resuscitation and unnecessary transfusions.

#### **2. Assessment and management**

- **a.** Review of the patient's medications, fluid status, orthostatic blood pressure measurements, heart rate and rhythm, pulse oximetry reading, 12‐lead ECG, and hematocrit should be sufficient to delineate the mechanism for hypotension. If the patient appears warm and well perfused, administration of a moderate amount of volume and modification of the medical regimen should suffice.
- **b.** Management of hypotension associated with AF can be problematic, in that medications that slow the rate tend to cause vasodilation and lower the blood pressure further (especially metoprolol and diltiazem). Amiodarone is an excellent alternative, and usually causes hypotension only with rapid IV infusion. However, in most patients, rate control will improve left ventricular filling and the blood pressure. If the patient has refractory hypotension with a fast rate that is difficult to control pharmacologically, cardioversion may be indicated.
- **c.** If the patient has refractory hypotension and does not appear well perfused, the likelihood of tamponade is increased and a STAT echocardiogram should be performed.
- **F. Myocardial ischemia.** The development of recurrent angina or new ECG changes (usually ST segment elevation) postoperatively always requires careful evaluation for evidence of ischemia or myocardial infarction. Manifestations may include a low output state, hypotension, heart failure and pulmonary edema, ventricular arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.

#### **1. Etiology**

- **a.** Coronary hypoperfusion from:
  - **1.** Acute thrombosis of a graft after CABG, either from an anastomotic problem, a kinked graft, or occasionally grafting to an incompletely endarterectomized artery
  - **2.** Reduced flow from anastomotic narrowing (technical issue) or hypoperfusion through a small conduit (for example, using a very small ITA graft or replacing a moderately diseased vein graft with a small ITA at reoperation)
  - **3.** Coronary spasm (graft or native vessel)
  - **4.** Nonbypassed, diseased coronary arteries either due to failure to locate the vessel, small vessel size, or severe calcification (incomplete revascularization)
  - **5.** Coronary ostial narrowing, occlusion or kinking after AVR or aortic root procedures with coronary button reimplantation
  - **6.** Circumflex artery compromise during mitral valve surgery
- **b.** Poor myocardial protection during surgery

#### **2. Evaluation**

**a.** Careful review of the ECG may indicate whether the ECG changes are consistent with ischemia or pericarditis (see Figures 8.2 and 8.3 on pages 384 and 385)

- **b.** Empiric use of a nitrate and/or CCB may be helpful for ischemia or spasm and can be diagnostic.
- **c.** Urgent coronary arteriography should be considered when there are significant ECG changes.50 It may identify a technical problem with a graft or confirm the diagnosis of spasm.
- **d.** In less urgent situations, a nuclear stress imaging study can be performed to identify the presence of myocardial ischemia and differentiate between ischemic and nonischemic causes of chest pain.

#### **3. Treatment**

- **a.** Intensification of a medical regimen with nitrates and ß‐blockers is indicated.
- **b.** Placement of an intra‐aortic balloon pump (IABP) is beneficial for ongoing ischemia or evidence of hemodynamic compromise, especially in the immediate postoperative period. However, it should only be considered a supportive measure until the etiology of the problem is identified.
- **c.** If a technical problem with a graft is identified by coronary angiography, or on occasion, there is failure to graft the correct artery or the graft is placed proximal to the most significant stenosis, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is often the best treatment because it can be performed most expeditiously.50,51 If this is not feasible, but a major area of myocardium is in jeopardy and the patient has not suffered a significant perioperative myocardial infarction (PMI), reoperation should be considered. In contrast, medical management may be indicated if the coronary vessels supplying an ischemic zone are small and diffusely diseased, if they were bypassed but graft flow was limited by vessel runoff, or if they were not bypassable. Inability to address small vessels should only leave a minor area of the heart potentially ischemic. PCI of larger, more proximal stenotic segments may provide some benefit by improving inflow. If the patient has sustained an extensive infarction and has a delayed assessment, surgical intervention may not prove beneficial and may be high risk.
- **d.** The long‐term results of coronary bypass surgery are influenced by the development of atherosclerotic disease in bypass conduits, nonbypassed native arteries, or native arteries beyond the bypass sites. Factors that can improve these results include use of arterial grafting (one or both ITAs and a radial artery), aggressive control of risk factors, including abstinence from smoking, statins for dyslipidemia, optimal control of hypertension and diabetes, and use of aspirin for at least one year.52 Supplemental use of a P2Y12 inhibitor may be beneficial in patients undergoing surgery for acute coronary syndromes or after OPCABs. On rare occasions, the late development of ischemia has been attributed to a coronary steal syndrome, either from a coronary–subclavian steal or an ITA– pulmonary artery fistula.53
- **G. Pericardial effusions and delayed tamponade.** Pericardial effusions have been noted in about 60–75% of patients undergoing routine echocardiography in the first 1–2 weeks following surgery but usually resolve completely.54,55 Several large studies have shown that about 1–2% of patients may develop symptomatic effusions that gradually increase in size, leading to a low cardiac output state and tamponade that requires drainage.56,57 However, smaller series have suggested that invasive treatment for pretamponade or tamponade is indicated in about 5% of patients.58,59 This problem may

be noted within the first week of surgery or weeks later. Suspicion must remain high because symptoms may develop insidiously and can be difficult to differentiate from those noted in patients recovering slowly from surgery. **This is one of the most serious yet most potentially correctable of all postoperative problems.**

#### **1. Etiology**

- **a.** Risk factors for development of pericardial effusions and delayed tamponade include:57–60
  - ∙ Use of perioperative antiplatelet drugs (aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitors) or other anticoagulants (heparin, LMWH, NOACs)
  - ∙ Early postoperative bleeding that requires blood product administration or re‐exploration
  - ∙ Early initiation of anticoagulation for VTE prophylaxis, mechanical valves, or the development of AF: a decision that must be made with caution as slow intrapericardial bleeding may occur despite minimal early postoperative bleeding.
  - ∙ Comorbidities including larger body surface area, hypertension, immunosuppression, chronic kidney disease (CKD), hepatic dysfunction
  - ∙ More advanced heart failure
  - ∙ Urgent surgery, more complex operations requiring longer durations of CPB (more coagulopathy), and surgery for endocarditis
- **b.** Acute hemorrhage may occur during removal of ventricular pacemaker wires from laceration of a superficial artery or vein overlying the right ventricle or from the right ventricle itself. Some surgeons request that pacing wires be removed prior to chest tube removal, but most commonly they are removed a few days after the chest tubes have been removed. Because bleeding might be exacerbated by anticoagulation, it is advisable to remove pacing wires before the INR becomes therapeutic, by withholding 1–2 doses of a NOAC, or by stopping heparin for a few hours to minimize that risk. If the patient is therapeutically anticoagulated, it may be advisable to cut the wires rather than remove them (see also page 609). Bleeding during withdrawal of atrial pacing wires may occur if the wires are directly attached to the atrial wall rather than placed into a plastic sleeve that is sewn to the heart (the Medtronic model 6500 wires). Rarely, a patient may develop a delayed rupture of an infarct zone or LV rupture from a mitral valve prosthesis.
- **c.** In patients with the above risk factors, especially those taking pre‐ or postoperative anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs, a progressively worsening hemopericardium may develop and the presentation may be insidious. In a large series from the Mayo Clinic, nonspecific symptoms often led to performance of an echocardiogram, but 42% of patients had hemodynamic compromise consistent with tamponade. This report also noted that half of the patients who had insignificant effusions on echo after valve surgery were readmitted with tamponade within two weeks of discharge.56
- **d.** Acute pericarditis is occasionally noted on a postoperative ECG and can be difficult to distinguish from an evolving MI (see Figure 8.3). This may be related to epicardial hemorrhage, undrained blood, or an early inflammatory response, but it is often of unclear etiology. It may be asymptomatic and

- noted only on an ECG and may contribute to the formation of serous or serosanguineous effusions.
- **e.** Late serous or serosanguineous effusions may develop from PPS, which is considered one type of "postcardiac injury" syndrome.61

#### **2. Presentation**

- **a.** Acute hemorrhage will present with refractory hypotension and the clinical picture of acute cardiac tamponade.
- **b.** Acute pericarditis may cause chest discomfort, but in the early postoperative period may be indistinguishable from the pain of a sternotomy incision.
- **c.** The classic picture of delayed tamponade is a low output state manifest by malaise, shortness of breath, chest discomfort, anorexia, nausea, or a low‐grade fever. These symptoms are frequently ascribed to medications or simply a slow recovery from surgery. Jugular venous distention, a pericardial rub, progressive orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia (often masked by use of β‐blockers), and a pulsus paradoxus are often noted. Occasionally, the first sign is a decrease in urine output with a rise in the BUN and creatinine caused by progressive renal dysfunction from the low output state, arterial hypotension, and systemic venous hypertension.

#### **3. Evaluation**

- **a.** A chest x‐ray may reveal enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, but this may be attributed to obtaining an AP portable film during a poor inspiratory effort. However, the chest x‐ray is often normal, depending on the site and rapidity of blood accumulation.
- **b.** Two‐dimensional echocardiography can identify the pericardial effusion, confirm tamponade physiology (>40% inspiratory increase in tricuspid valve flow and >25% inspiratory decrease in mitral valve flow), and also assess the status of ventricular function. It is important to recognize that tamponade may be caused by selective compression of individual cardiac chambers, often by small effusions, and not necessarily by large circumferential effusions.57,62 **A transthoracic echocardiogram often has limitations in obtaining certain acoustic windows**, which may be related to the patient's body habitus. Thus, it will occasionally not identify an effusion.
- **c.** If the clinical suspicion remains high and transthoracic imaging is suboptimal, CT scanning can be used to identify and localize a significant effusion. This is useful in patients who are several days out from surgery, hemodynamically stable, and on the postoperative floor.63 However, in unstable patients and those in the ICU, a **transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE)** is preferable and is more sensitive than a TTE in detecting posterior fluid collections (Figure 13.1).64

#### **4. Prevention**

- **a.** Stopping antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications at the appropriate time prior to surgery should not be overlooked.
- **b.** Meticulous attention to obtaining hemostasis at the conclusion of surgery is essential to minimize the risk of bleeding, the use of blood products, and the development of a coagulopathy that may lead to delayed tamponade.

**Figure 13.1 •** Two‐dimensional echocardiograms of significant postoperative pericardial effusions. (A) A transthoracic study in the parasternal long‐axis view demonstrating a significant posterior effusion. (B) A transesophageal study in the transgastric short‐axis view. Note the circumferential pericardial effusion that prevents adequate ventricular filling. Evidence of diastolic collapse will confirm the hemodynamic significance of the effusion.

- **c.** Performance of a small posterior pericardiotomy incision at the conclusion of surgery reduces the incidence of posterior pericardial effusions.65 It is also likely that placing one of the mediastinal tubes below the heart, rather than two tubes anteriorly, might improve drainage and reduce the incidence of residual effusions.
- **d.** Chest tubes can be removed when drainage for the preceding eight hours is <100 mL. One study found that leaving chest tubes in at least until the second postoperative day and removing them only after the drainage was <50 mL/4h more than halved the incidence of delayed tamponade.66

- **e.** Early initiation of anticoagulation following valvular heart surgery, for VTE prophylaxis, or for the management of AF always requires careful judgment as to whether the patient might be at higher risk for mediastinal bleeding and the development of delayed tamponade.
- **f.** Prophylactic use of NSAIDs may reduce the incidence of postoperative pericardial effusions.67 A number of medications have been successful in reducing the risk of postoperative PPS (see next section), but none can be recommended for routine use for that purpose. However, colchicine, anti‐inflammatory medications and/or steroids might be utilized in treating effusions due to pericarditis or PPS which have not produced hemodynamic compromise.
- **g.** Remove pacing wires only in patients who are not therapeutically anticoagulated.

#### **5. Treatment**

- **a.** Emergency mediastinal exploration is indicated for active bleeding. If the patient is bleeding massively and/or is very unstable, this should be performed in the ICU or even at the bedside on the postoperative floor with equipment available in an "open chest kit". If the patient can be stabilized, but there is suspicion of an active bleeding source, transferring the patient to the operating room for re‐exploration is preferable.
- **b.** Pericardiocentesis is the least invasive means of draining a progressively enlarging effusion and is effective in about 50% of cases, usually when the effusion is anterior or circumferential.56,57 This is usually performed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory under ECG or two‐dimensional echocardiographic guidance. This will not be completely effective if the blood has clotted with loculated strands.
- **c.** Subxiphoid exploration should be considered when the echocardiogram suggests that the fluid collection cannot be successfully approached percutaneously (usually a posterior collection) or when it is loculated. If this approach is ineffective in draining the effusion, the entire sternal incision may need to be opened.
- **d.** A pericardial "window" or limited pericardiectomy through a left thoracotomy approach can be considered for loculated posterior effusions or recurrent effusions several weeks after surgery.
- **H. Postpericardiotomy syndrome** (PPS) has been reported in 10–20% of patients following open‐heart surgery and is considered to represent an autoimmune inflammatory response to injury, often associated with the occurrence of perioperative bleeding and the requirement for blood transfusions.68,69 It is associated with an elevation in inflammatory markers, including cytokines, markers of neutrophil activation, and oxidative stress mediators.70 It is one of several forms of "postcardiac injury" syndrome which may also occur after pacemaker implantation, PCI, transmural myocardial infarctions, or radiofrequency arrhythmia ablation, presumably as a response to cardiac injury.61 It may occur within the first week of surgery or several weeks to months later and appears to have a different etiology than the pericarditis and pericardial effusions noted early after surgery. The development of PPS may contribute to cardiac tamponade, early vein graft closure, or constrictive pericarditis.71
  - **1.** Risk factors for PPS include younger age, nondiabetics, CKD, lower hematocrits or platelet counts preoperatively (which most likely accounts for more perioperative

- bleeding and the need for transfusions), and valve or aortic surgery.68,69,72 A low preoperative level of interleukin‐8 is a high‐risk marker for its development.73
- **2. Presentation.** Fever, pleuritic chest pain, a pericardial friction rub, or a new or worsening pleural or pericardial effusion may be present, with the diagnosis of PPS being made if two or more of these are present. Malaise and arthralgias may also be present.
- **3. Prevention.** Colchicine (1 g bid × 1 day, then 0.5 mg bid × 1 month) started after surgery has seen the most promise in preventing PPS.74,75 The efficacy of prophylactic intraoperative steroids is uncertain76 – one study showing a benefit of methyprednisolone77 and another showing no benefit of dexamethasone.78 Diclofenac (representative of the NSAIDs) has also been effective in reducing the occurrence of postoperative PPS.79
- **4. Evaluation.** Lymphocytosis, eosinophilia, and an elevated ESR are noted, but a fever work‐up is negative. Effusions are usually demonstrable by chest x‐ray and echocardiography.

#### **5. Treatment**

- **a.** The best initial treatment for PPS is a combination of aspirin (750 mg tid × 2 weeks) and colchicine (0.5 mg bid × 6 months), given with a PPI.61 If there is minimal symptomatic relief or as an alternative to aspirin, a one‐ to two‐week course of an NSAID, such as ibuprofen 600 mg tid, can be given with cessation of aspirin. It should be noted that the regular use of NSAIDs (especially ibuprofen) may inhibit the cardioprotective antiplatelet effect of aspirin.80
- **b.** For patients with recurrent PPS, a one‐month tapering course of prednisolone starting with 0.5 mg/kg daily can be added to the regimen of colchicine and aspirin.61
- **c.** Colchicine (0.5 mg bid × 1 month) is recommended for the treatment of acute and recurrent pericarditis.75,81
- **d.** Pericardiocentesis may be necessary to drain a large symptomatic pericardial effusion.
- **e.** Pericardiectomy is recommended for recurrent large effusions or constriction, which is more common in younger patients with the early onset of PPS.
- **I. Constrictive pericarditis** is a late complication of cardiac surgery that is extremely uncommon despite the development of adhesions that form within the mediastinum following surgery. It has been noted in patients with undrained early postoperative hemopericardium, use of warfarin, early PPS, and previous mediastinal radiation, yet has also developed in the absence of any of these factors. It has been theorized that residual blood and proinflammatory conditions in the pericardium may contribute to the formation of both PPS and later the formation of dense adhesions that more readily cause thickening of the epicardium. This may produce ventricular constriction ("constrictive epicarditis") and also result in graft failure.70,82
  - **1. Presentation.** The patient will note the insidious onset of dyspnea on exertion, chest pain, and fatigue. Signs of right‐heart failure (peripheral edema, ascites, and jugular venous distention) are common, but pulsus paradoxus is infrequent.

#### **2. Evaluation**

- **a.** The chest x‐ray is frequently normal in the absence of a pericardial effusion.
- **b.** Two‐dimensional echocardiography will demonstrate signs of constriction, such as septal bounce and diminished respiratory variation in the inferior vena cava.

- **c.** A CT or preferably an MRI scan usually documents a thickened pericardium, with delayed enhancement on MRI and occasionally a small pericardial effusion. However, in cases of constrictive epicarditis, pericardial thickening may not be seen.
- **d.** Right‐heart catheterization provides the most definitive information. It will document the equilibration of diastolic pressures and demonstrate a diastolic dip‐and‐plateau pattern ("square‐root" sign) in the right ventricular pressure tracing (see Figure 1.32). On occasion, significant fluid overload will produce hemodynamics consistent with constriction, when in fact there is no anatomic evidence of a thickened pericardium or epicarditis other than standard postoperative scarring.
- **3. Treatment.** If there is no clinical response to diuretics and steroids, a pericardiectomy is indicated to decorticate the heart. This is best performed through a sternotomy incision, which allows for adequate decortication of the right atrium and ventricle and much of the left ventricle. It also allows for the institution of CPB in the event of a difficult or bloody operation. Relief of epicardial constriction is difficult and may result in surgical damage to bypass grafts or significant bleeding. A "waffle" or "turtle shell" procedure is performed with crisscrossing incisions made in the epicardial scar to relieve the constriction.82 Results are suboptimal when there is poor LV systolic function, higher RV and LV diastolic pressures, persistent impaired diastolic filling, which correlates with the duration of symptoms prior to surgery, and when significant tricuspid regurgitation is present, which usually will not improve with pericardiectomy alone.

#### **VI. Renal, Metabolic, and Fluid Management and Complications**

#### **A. Routine care**

- **1.** Most patients are still substantially above their preoperative weight when transferred to the postoperative floor. Comparison of the patient's preoperative weight with daily weights obtained postoperatively is a guide to the use of diuretics to eliminate excess fluid. Achievement of dry body weight may require more aggressive diuresis if heart failure (HF) was present before surgery. In the chronically ill patient, preoperative weight may be achieved after several days despite fluid overload, due to poor nutrition.
- **2.** Dietary restriction (sodium and water) need not be overly strict in most cases. With the availability of potent diuretics to achieve negative fluid balance and the common problem of a poor appetite after surgery, it is more important to provide palatable food without restriction to improve the patient's caloric intake.
- **3.** If a patient required diuretics before surgery (especially valve patients and those with poor myocardial function), it is advisable to continue them upon discharge from the hospital even if preoperative weight has been attained.
- **B. Transient renal failure** (see also Chapter 12). Patients with preoperative renal dysfunction, hypertension and diabetes, prolonged pump runs, postoperative low cardiac output syndromes, or those requiring substantial doses of vasopressors may develop postoperative AKI. Although diuretics are routinely used to reduce the immediate postoperative fluid overload, they have to be used with caution in patients developing

- AKI. They do not influence the course of AKI and can in fact exacerbate renal dysfunction by causing prerenal azotemia from intravascular volume depletion. Management can be very difficult on the postoperative floor when methods of monitoring intravascular volume are limited.
- **1.** A common scenario with mild AKI is gradual elevation in serum creatinine (SCr) with or without elevation in the BUN, along with a low serum sodium, reflective of persistent total body water overload. Oliguria may improve and AKI may be transient with adjustment of medications. Antihypertensive medications should be reduced to allow the normally hypertensive patient's blood pressure to rise to higher levels than normal. ACE inhibitors should be withheld, NSAIDs avoided, and diuretics used gently, if at all, to maintain adequate intravascular volume. If the patient was aggressively diuresed and has a poor appetite, additional hydration may be necessary to address prerenal azotemia which will elevate the BUN. In most patients, renal dysfunction is transient as long as the cardiac output remains satisfactory.
- **2.** If a rising SCr is associated with significant fluid retention, compromise of pulmonary function with oxygen desaturation often results. A high dose of diuretics may improve urine output to address this problem even if it does not directly promote renal recovery. If not successful, the patient may need to return to the ICU for more invasive monitoring and possibly use of intravenous inotropic support, more aggressive noninvasive or even mechanical ventilation, and ultrafiltration or dialysis if renal dysfunction is significant. **A rising BUN and creatinine of unclear etiology, especially when associated with new‐onset oliguria, should always raise the suspicion of delayed tamponade.** An echocardiogram should be performed to assess myocardial function and look for possible cardiac tamponade.
- **C. Hyperkalemia** usually occurs in association with renal dysfunction. Its manifestations and treatment are discussed on pages 708–711. Particular attention should be directed to stopping any exogenous potassium intake, ACE inhibitors ARBs, and NSAIDs, and reevaluating renal function.
- **D. Hyperglycemia** in diabetics, and occasionally in nondiabetics, is a common postoperative problem. The blood glucose level may be elevated due to insulin resistance and residual elevation of the counterregulatory hormones (glucagon, cortisol) after surgery.83 Adequate, but not overly stringent, control of blood glucose during the early postoperative period with an IV insulin protocol has been shown to reduce not only the incidence of wound infection but also other morbidities and operative mortality (see Appendix 6).84–87 Once the patient is transferred to the floor, frequent fingersticks should be obtained (usually before meals and at bedtime) to assess the adequacy of blood glucose control.
  - **1.** Insulin resistance is commonly noted during the early postoperative period. Insulin‐dependent diabetics should have their insulin doses gradually increased back to preoperative levels depending on oral intake and blood glucose levels. It is preferable to use a lower dose of intermediate‐acting insulin initially and supplement it with regular insulin as necessary (see Table 12.9, page 721, for commonly used insulin preparations).
  - **2.** Oral hypoglycemics can be restarted once the patient has an adequate oral intake, usually starting at half the preoperative dose, and increasing the dose depending on oral intake and blood glucose.

**E.** Other electrolyte and endocrine complications are fairly unusual once the patient has been transferred to the postoperative floor. Chapter 12 discusses the evaluation and management of some of these problems.

#### **VII. Hematologic Complications and Anticoagulation Regimens**

#### **A. Anemia**

- **1.** Despite the obligatory hemodilution associated with use of CPB, effective blood conservation strategies and performance of off‐pump surgery have reduced the requirements for perioperative blood transfusions. Although the STS guidelines recommend transfusion for a hemoglobin (Hb) <6 g/dL on CPB in low‐risk patients,88 such a restrictive strategy may increase the risk of renal failure, stroke, and neurocognitive dysfunction, and should not be applied to patients who are elderly, diabetic, have cerebrovascular disease, or are at risk for end‐organ ischemia.
- **2.** Most studies recommend maintaining a HCT above 20% on CPB and then at least 22% postoperatively. Multiple studies comparing a liberal (transfuse for a Hb <7 g/dL) and restrictive (transfuse for a Hb <9 g/dL) strategy after cardiac surgery have shown comparable outcomes.89,90 However, transfusion to a higher hematocrit postoperatively may be considered for elderly patients, those who feel significantly weak and fatigued, and those with ECG changes, hypotension, or significant tachycardia.
- **3.** Although the HCT may rise gradually with postoperative diuresis, it frequently will not as fluid is mobilized into the bloodstream from extracellular tissues. Furthermore, the HCT may be influenced by the shortened red cell lifespan caused by extracorporeal circulation and the loss of 30% of transfused red cells within 24 hours of transfusion. In one study, "hemoglobin drift" was noted in virtually all patients, averaging about 1.1 mg/dL, was greater with longer durations of CPB, but was unrelated to whether the patient received a transfusion.91 However, with diuresis, the Hb level improved in nearly 80% of patients prior to discharge, and this concept should be taken into consideration when contemplating a transfusion.
- **4.** Any patient with a HCT <30% should be placed on iron therapy (ferrous sulfate or gluconate 300 mg tid for one month) at the time of discharge. Exogenous iron may not be necessary if the patient has received multiple transfusions, because of the storage of iron from hemolyzed cells.
- **5.** Consideration may also be given to use of recombinant erythropoietin (Epogen or Procrit) to stimulate red cell production (50–100 units/kg SC three times a week), especially in patients with CKD with adequate iron stores (transferrin saturation >20% and ferritin >100 ng/mL).
- **B. Thrombocytopenia** is caused by platelet destruction and hemodilution during extracorporeal circulation, but platelet counts gradually return to normal within several days. Impaired hemostasis noted in the early postoperative period is caused more commonly by platelet dysfunction induced by CPB or use of antiplatelet medications, although it is attenuated somewhat by the use of the antifibrinolytic drugs.

#### **1. Etiology**

- ∙ Platelet activation or dilution during CPB
- ∙ Excessive bleeding and multiple blood transfusions without platelet administration

- ∙ Use of an intra‐aortic balloon pump
- ∙ Heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). **Note**: platelet counts must be monitored on a daily basis in any patient receiving heparin. A falling platelet count after the initial recovery of the platelet count should always raise the specter of HIT and is an indication for *in vitro* aggregation testing to identify HIT.
- ∙ Other medications that may reduce the platelet count, such as furosemide, NSAIDs, and ranitidine
- ∙ Sepsis
- ∙ Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), which is usually characterized by AKI, thrombocytopenia, and a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with schistocytes on blood smear. Occasionally, fever and altered mental status may be present.92
- **2. Treatment.** Platelet transfusions are indicated:
  - **a.** When the platelet count is <20,000–30,000/μL (<20−30 × 109 /L).
  - **b.** For ongoing bleeding when the platelet count is <100,000/μL and sometimes higher if platelet dysfunction is suspected.
  - **c.** For a planned surgical procedure (such as percutaneous IABP removal) when the platelet count is <60,000/μL (<60 × 109 /L).
- **C. Heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)** is a very serious problem that may result in widespread arterial and venous thrombosis, and carries a mortality rate of about 20%. Because of its high risk and the necessity for treatment with direct thrombin inhibitors, early suspicion, identification, and management are essential.93–96
  - **1.** HIT is an immune‐mediated phenomenon caused by the formation of IgG antibodies that bind to the heparin‐platelet factor 4 (PF4) complex, producing platelet activation. This results in release of procoagulant microparticles that lead to thrombin generation. This binding causes release of more PF4, promoting more platelet activation. Antibody binding to glycosaminoglycans on the surface of endothelial cells leads to endothelial cell damage and tissue factor expression. This procoagulant milieu promotes arterial and venous thrombosis in 30–50% of patients and may cause a stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, or deep venous thrombosis.

#### **2. Suspicion of the diagnosis**

- **a.** The diagnosis of HIT requires the presence of heparin antibodies and thrombocytopenia. HIT is more common with use of bovine heparin and is 8–10 times more likely to occur with UFH than LMWH.
- **b.** The suspicion of HIT is based on the "four Ts", which include the degree of **T**hrombocytopenia, the **T**iming of its occurrence, the occurrence of **T**hrombotic events, and the likelihood of o**T**her potential causes. One scoring system found that independent risk factors for HIT after CPB were a biphasic response to the platelet count, an interval of >5 days since CPB, and a bypass run exceeding about two hours.97
  - **i.** Thrombocytopenia is extremely common postoperatively and may be related to hemodilution, platelet damage on pump, clearance of transfused platelets, and sepsis. The platelet count is usually reduced about 40% after surgery on CPB, but begins to rebound by the third or fourth day after

- surgery. If the platelet count does not improve after four days or there is a subsequent fall in platelet count >50%, HIT should be suspected.
- **ii.** Although immediate‐onset HIT (occurring within hours of giving heparin) may develop in patients who received heparin within 100 days due to residual circulating HIT antibodies, it is rare for a patient receiving short‐ term preoperative heparin to develop HIT within the first four days after surgery. The general pattern is for HIT to occur 5–14 days after surgery.
- **iii.** Delayed‐onset HIT (occurring after heparin has been discontinued due to the presence of residual heparin‐PF4 platelet‐activating antibodies) is often manifested by venous thromboembolism, and is commonly not diagnosed, because platelet counts are rarely checked after heparin is stopped. If there is evidence of a thrombotic event (such as lower extremity VTE), a low platelet count should raise suspicion of this entity.
- **iv.** It is estimated that 30–50% of patients who develop HIT will develop evidence of thrombosis, mandating additional treatment beyond stopping heparin. Disturbingly, it is estimated that 25% of patients may develop thrombosis before developing thrombocytopenia.98 Thus, HIT can be a very difficult management problem because of the temptation to administer heparin for a thrombotic event when it might be contraindicated. More commonly, however, patients will develop thrombosis as the platelet count is falling and reaching its nadir, but, as noted, it may occur even after the heparin has been stopped (delayed‐onset HIT). Thus, there are clinical scenarios when HIT may be present but the suspicion is low, leading to complications from delayed recognition and management.
  - **v.** Other potential causes, especially medications, use of an IABP, and sepsis should be considered as possible causes of thrombocytopenia.
- **3. Diagnostic testing.** ELISA serologic testing for IgG specific heparin‐dependent platelet antibodies has replaced prior testing that also detected non‐HIT‐causing IgM antibodies. Such testing was positive in about 20% of preoperative and in up to 50% of postoperative cardiac surgical patients, but was uncommonly associated with thromboembolic events.94,99–102 It is estimated that only 1–2% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery will develop HIT. Use of optical densities (ODs) with ELISA testing and antibody titers may be helpful in improving specificity as well, since most cases of HIT are associated with an OD >1.4 units.95 More specific functional assays of washed platelet activation (serotonin release assay and heparin‐induced platelet aggregation studies) are able to more accurately identify antibodies that trigger platelet activation. Preoperative testing for heparin antibodies is not recommended in the absence of thrombocytopenia or thrombosis.

#### **4. Management95,102,103**

**a.** If HIT is identified preoperatively with positive testing and thrombocytopenia, an alternative method of anticoagulation (usually bivalirudin) must be used during surgery (see Chapter 4, pages 251–253). Antibodies generally clear within three months of the last heparin administration, and heparinization can be performed safely if HIT testing is negative.

- **b.** With any suspicion of postoperative HIT, even before testing results become available, **all heparin administration must be stopped**. This includes cessation of heparin flushes and removal of heparin‐coated pulmonary artery catheters. However, if the likelihood of HIT is low based upon clinical grounds, yet an anticoagulant is indicated for prophylaxis (such as for VTE), fondaparinux 5–10 mg qd SC (weight‐based) can be given safely.
- **c.** Platelets should not be routinely administered, because they may promote thrombosis, but may be considered if the patient is bleeding or to prevent bleeding if the platelet count is very low (<30,000). The platelet count generally begins to increase within about a week after cessation of heparin.
- **d.** Warfarin should **not** be started immediately, because tissue necrosis from microvascular thrombosis may occur due to depletion of the vitamin‐K‐dependent natural anticoagulant protein C. This has been noted in patients who rapidly develop a supratherapeutic INR. Warfarin may be started safely after the platelet count reaches 150 × 109 /L and should overlap the nonheparin anticoagulant for five days, even when the INR is in therapeutic range.
- **e.** Alternative anticoagulation is indicated to minimize the risk of thrombotic events and also to provide protection for the process for which the heparin was originally indicated. This is essential because the risk of symptomatic thrombosis remains greater than 25% if only the heparin is stopped.
  - **i. Argatroban** is a synthetic direct thrombin inhibitor that is preferred in patients with renal dysfunction because it undergoes hepatic metabolism. It has a plasma half‐life of about 40 minutes. It is given starting at a dose of 2 μg/kg/min once heparin effect has been eliminated (usually four hours for UFH and 12 hours after the last dose of LMWH), and maintained at a rate of 0.5–1.2 μg/kg/min and adjusted to maintain a PTT of 1.5–3 times baseline. Lower doses are recommended in patients with liver disease or heart failure. Conversion from argatroban to warfarin can be somewhat problematic because both affect the INR. Warfarin should be started once the platelet count exceeds 150 × 109 and is given in doses of 2.5–5 mg for five days of overlapping treatment. At that point, the usual protocol is to stop the argatroban if the INR is >4 and recheck an INR in four hours. If the new INR is >2, it does not need to be restarted; if it is <2, the argatroban should be restarted. However, it has been noted that even when the INR is >4, the risk of thrombosis may still exceed the risk of bleeding.104
  - **ii. Bivalirudin** is a direct thrombin inhibitor that produces reversible binding to thrombin and has a short half‐life of only 25 minutes. It can be used for the management of HIT with an initial bolus of 0.75 mg/kg followed by an infusion of 0.15 mg/kg/h to achieve a target PTT of 1.5–2.5 times baseline. Advantages include 80% enzymatic metabolism (although some modification is indicated in patients with a GFR <30 mL/min), non‐immunogenicity, and minimal effect on the INR.
  - **iii. Danaparoid** is a heparinoid that has a low degree of reactivity with heparin antibodies. It is given in a bolus dose of 2250 anti‐Xa units, followed by 400 units/h × 4 hours, then 300 units/h × 4 hours, then a maintenance infusion of 200 units/h. It is monitored by anti‐Xa levels, trying to achieve

- a level of 0.5–0.8 units/mL. It is available from Aspen Pharmacare, but is not available in the USA.
- **iv.** Non‐vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have had limited evaluation in the management of HIT, but may be considered off‐label as alternative medications using the doses recommended for acute VTE (see section IV.E, pages 750–752).
- **v.** Duration of antithrombotic therapy is generally one month without and three months with the occurrence of a thrombotic event.
- **D. Coronary bypass surgery.** Postoperative aspirin should be utilized to increase saphenous vein graft patency, although there is no documented benefit in improving the patency of arterial conduits.52
  - **1.** Class I recommendations for antiplatelet therapy after CABG in most guidelines (American College of Chest Physicians [ACCP], American College of Cardiology/ American Heart Association [ACC/AHA], the European Society of Cardiology [ESC], and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons [STS]) are to start aspirin in doses ranging from 75 mg to 325 mg starting 6–24 hours after surgery and to also prescribe clopidogrel 75 mg after OPCAB.105–108 The use of higher doses of aspirin may offset the increase in platelet reactivity and the decreased absorption of aspirin noted postoperatively.23 Non‐enteric‐coated aspirin has better absorption and is recommended. The timing of initiation of therapy may be influenced by the degree of postoperative mediastinal bleeding. It is recommended to continue aspirin indefinitely due to its benefits in the secondary prevention of coronary disease, although it may not influence graft patency when used beyond one year.
  - **2.** Class IIa recommendations are to prescribe dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor (preferably ticagrelor) in patients who have undergone CABG for an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Several meta‐analyses have suggested that DAPT after CABG for SIHD may reduce vein graft occlusion, with the greatest benefit noted following OPCABs (hence the level I recommendation), although it may be associated with more bleeding.109,110 However, DAPT did not improve cardiovascular outcomes in diabetic patients with multivessel disease undergoing CABG for stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) or an ACS in the FREEDOM trial.111 DAPT is only a class IIb indication following on‐pump CABG per the ACC/AHA guidelines. If the patient is aspirin‐intolerant, clopidogrel should be given with a 300 mg loading dose, followed by 75 mg daily.
  - **3.** DAPT should be resumed after surgery if the patient has received a drug‐eluting stent within the past year and it remains patent.
  - **4.** There is no documented superiority in graft patency comparing aspirin to warfarin or to a NOAC (rivaroxaban) whether used alone or in addition to aspirin.112 Whether one of these might be considered after coronary endarterectomy is not known.
- **E. Prosthetic heart valves.** All patients receiving mechanical heart valves must take a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) indefinitely following surgery, but the guidelines regarding the short‐term use of a VKA after tissue valve replacement provide differing recommendations.113 The following recommendations (summarized in Table 13.5) are a general consensus from the 2012 ACCP,114 2014/2017 ACC/AHA,115 and the 2017 ESC guidelines,116 all of which are updated every few years and are available online. The evolution and comparison of these guidelines are presented in a paper published in 2019.117

#### **1. Tissue valves**

- **a. Aortic valves (surgical).** Some reviews have concluded that use of either aspirin or a VKA provides similar outcomes after bioprosthetic AVR, and the slight decrease in thromboembolism and death from the combination of both is offset by an increased risk of bleeding.118 Although surgeons and patients often opt for a tissue valve to avoid a VKA, even for a short period of time, there is some evidence that patients not receiving VKAs are more susceptible to thromboembolic complications during the first three months after implantation, with a slightly increased risk of stroke.119 Furthermore, "subclinical leaflet thrombosis" has been identified on aortic tissue valves implanted surgically or with TAVR and has been associated with an increased risk of stroke after surgical AVR.120
  - **i.** The 2012 ACCP guidelines recommend aspirin 75–100 mg (usually 81 mg) indefinitely if the patient is in sinus rhythm, with the addition of warfarin to achieve a target INR of 2.5 if the patient is at higher risk for thromboembolism (AF, hypercoagulable disorder, EF <35%, previous thromboembolism, or a left atrial dimension >50 mm).114
  - **ii.** The 2017 AHA/ACC guidelines give level IIa indications to the indefinite use of aspirin and to the use of a VKA for 3–6 months with a target INR level of 2.5 if the patient is at low risk for bleeding. However, the guidelines do not specify whether the recommendation is to use either alone or both together. After 3–6 months, only aspirin is recommended unless there is another indication for warfarin.115 New guidelines should be available online towards the end of 2020.
  - **iii.** The 2017 ESC guidelines provide a class IIa indication for use of aspirin and a IIb indication for use of an oral anticoagulant (without concomitant use of aspirin), because the addition of a VKA will increase the bleeding risk despite a lower risk of thromboembolism.116 In contradistinction to the AHA/ACC guidelines, the ESC guidelines do not recommend the indefinite use of aspirin.
  - **iv.** Limited data have shown that a NOAC is noninferior to the use of warfarin in patients with AF and prior bioprosthetic valve replacement or repair. Therefore, it may be feasible to consider use of a NOAC after three months if there is an indication for continuing anticoagulation, such as AF.121
- **b. Aortic valves (TAVR).** Standard protocols following TAVR recommend clopidogrel 75 mg daily for six months and aspirin 81 mg daily indefinitely. For patients who are at high risk for bleeding on DAPT, there are data showing that outcomes are comparable with mono and dual antiplatelet therapy.118,122,123 For a patient in AF, either a VKA or a NOAC is used and may be combined with one antiplatelet medication, but not both.
  - **i.** Concerns about subclinical leaflet thrombosis causing an increased gradient across the valve and an increased risk of stroke have raised the question as to whether a VKA should be used in these patients. This has received an ACC/ AHA level IIb indication in patients at low risk for bleeding.115 This is probably less of an issue in elderly patients in whom anticoagulation is more dangerous, but may be applicable to younger, lower‐risk patients undergoing TAVR.
  - **ii.** A NOAC with aspirin cannot be recommended as an alternative approach based on the GALILEO study, which found a higher risk of bleeding, thromboembolism, and death with rivaroxaban + aspirin compared with clopidogrel + aspirin in patients with no other indication for anticoagulation.124 However, this study did not assess whether use of a NOAC alone might reduce subclinical leaflet thrombosis without increasing risks compared with warfarin or DAPT in patients without AF.

- **c. Mitral valves.** Warfarin should be started by the first postoperative day and given along with aspirin (ACC/AHA guidelines level IIa) for 3–6 months to achieve a target INR of 2.5 (range 2.0–3.0). ESC guidelines provide a IIa recommendation for three months of a VKA without aspirin. The initiation of heparin can be considered in the hospital before the INR reaches the target level. The patient can then be discharged on LMWH until the INR reaches the therapeutic range. After three months, warfarin is stopped and aspirin 75–100 mg (usually 81 mg) is given if the patient is in sinus rhythm. However, warfarin should be continued indefinitely in patients at high thromboembolic risk, and aspirin should be added to the regimen. NOACs may be feasible after three months in patients with AF.113,121
- **d. Mitral rings.** The benefit of using a VKA rather than aspirin after mitral valve repair is not clear. ACCP guidelines recommend aspirin alone if the patient is in sinus rhythm, whereas the ACC/AHA and ESC guidelines recommend use of a VKA for three months. This conclusion is based primarily on evidence that about 30% of patients discharged in sinus rhythm will experience AF shortly thereafter, but is not based upon thromboembolic risk from the prosthetic ring. However, some studies suggest that aspirin alone may be sufficient.125
- **2. Mechanical valves.** Based on the RE‐ALIGN study published in 2013, dabigatran, and inferentially the factor Xa inhibitor NOACs, are contraindicated as anticoagulants in patients receiving mechanical valves.126
  - **a. Aortic valves.** Current‐generation bileaflet valves (Abbott St. Jude, Medtronic ATS) should receive warfarin indefinitely starting by the day after surgery to achieve a target INR of 2.5 (range 2.0–3.0). In patients with older valves, which carry higher thromboembolic risk (Starr‐Edwards or Bjork‐Shiley valves), and in patients with double mechanical valves, the target INR should be 3.0 (range 2.5–3.5). The ESC guidelines recommend increasing the target INR by 0.5 if the risk factors noted in section 1.a.i on page 771 are present. The target INR for On‐X aortic valves is also 2.5, but may be lowered to 1.5–2 after three months.
  - **b. Mitral valves.** Patients should receive warfarin indefinitely starting by the day after surgery to achieve a target INR of 3.0 (range 2.5–3.5).
  - **c.** The ACC/AHA and ACCP guidelines recommend the addition of aspirin 75–100 mg daily to warfarin for all patients receiving mechanical valves. Because the evidence supporting this recommendation is weak and the risk of bleeding is unequivocally increased, the ESC recommends the addition of aspirin only if vascular disease, coronary stenting, or recurrent embolism is present.116,117
- **3.** In patients receiving mechanical valves or those in AF receiving tissue mitral valves, there is a potentially increased risk of early postoperative thromboembolism when the patient is not therapeutically anticoagulated. Therefore, use of heparin is recommended until the INR becomes therapeutic. However, the timing of initiation of heparin as a bridge is not well defined and must be individualized. Although some groups advocate initiating heparinization as early as the first postoperative day, this may increase the risk of bleeding. A safe approach is to initiate UFH or LMWH on the fourth or fifth postoperative day if the INR is less than 1.8. It is recommended that either of these be continued until the INR has been therapeutic for two days. The ESC recommends antifactor Xa monitoring if LMWH is used to ensure adequate anticoagulation.

- **F. Dosing and overanticoagulation.** Warfarin is a dangerous drug that requires thoughtful administration and careful monitoring to avoid overanticoagulation.127
  - **1.** Initiation of warfarin results in the more rapid depletion of factors VII, IX, and X than factor II (prothrombin), which has a longer half‐life. Thus, it exhibits an antihemostatic effect before it achieves an antithrombotic effect, the latter being attributable primarily to a reduction in factor II. Following cardiac surgery, it is essential that warfarin not be loaded and that doses be carefully individualized to avoid rapid overanticoagulation. An initial dose of 5 mg is given to most patients. However, 2.5 mg should be given to small elderly women, patients with hepatic dysfunction, chronic illness, and those receiving antibiotics or amiodarone (Table 13.6). The INR generally begins to rise in 2–3 days, but often takes 5–7 days to achieve a stable dosing level.

#### **Table 13.6 • Protocol for Initiation of Warfarin Doses**

- 1. Small, elderly females

<sup>\*</sup>Restart warfarin when INR is less than 3.0 WNL, within normal limits

- 2. Potential dangers of overanticoagulation include cardiac tamponade from intrapericardial bleeding, and gastrointestinal (GI), intracranial, or retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Although there are antithrombotic benefits to the combined use of warfarin and aspirin, which is generally recommended for valve patients, this combination does increase the long-term risk of bleeding for patients with a variety of indications for anticoagulation. <sup>128</sup> An ACC expert consensus pathway was written in 2017 for the management of bleeding related to oral anticoagulation. <sup>127</sup> A brief protocol for the management of overanticoagulation with warfarin is noted in Figure 13.2 and in Appendix 9.
- 3. If the patient has significant bleeding with a markedly elevated INR, warfarin should be held, and fresh frozen plasma (up to 15 mL/kg) should be given. Vitamin K 5–10 mg IV in 50 mL NS over 30 minutes should be given and may be repeated every 12 hours for persistent INR elevation. Use of four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC) 25–50 units/kg (approximately 1000–1500 units) or recombinant factor VIIa 40 μg/kg may also be considered.
- **4.** If the patient has no evidence of bleeding, general recommendations for management of elevated INRs are as follows, although rapid elevation of the INR in the early postoperative period may warrant more aggressive therapy.
  - a. INR  $\geq$ 9: hold warfarin, give vitamin K 2.5–5 mg orally (INR should fall within 24–48 hours)
  - **b.** INR ≥5 and <9: hold warfarin for 1–2 days and restart when INR is <4; alternatively, omit one dose of warfarin and give 1–2.5 mg of vitamin K orally
  - **c.** INR above therapeutic range but ≤5: lower or omit one dose until at therapeutic range

- **5.** Vitamin K given in small oral doses can reduce the INR to a therapeutic level within a few days and is usually the best approach when withholding warfarin does not reduce the INR. Use of large doses of IV vitamin K will produce more rapid reversal of the INR, but it is associated with a small risk of anaphylaxis. It may also lead to warfarin resistance and generally should be avoided. If the INR becomes subtherapeutic (which is usually safer than a markedly elevated INR), heparin can always be given until the INR rises back to the therapeutic range. In patients on long‐term warfarin with variable INR responses, concomitant administration of vitamin K 100–200 μg/day orally helps stabilize the INR.129,130
- **6.** For patients taking a NOAC, bleeding can be addressed using reversal agents:
  - **a.** For dabigatran, give idarucizumab 5 g IV (Praxbind); if not available, give 4F‐ PCC 25–50 units/kg.
  - **b.** For factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban, rivaroxaban), give recombinant factor Xa (andexanet alpha) (Andexxa) 400–800 mg at 30 mg/min. If not available, give 4F‐PCC 25–50 units/kg.
  - **c.** Prothrombin complex concentrates contains the vitamin‐K‐dependent coagulation factors II, IX, and X (so‐called three‐factor PCC [Profilnine]) and may contain variable amounts of factor VII (four‐factor PCC [Kcentra].
  - **d.** Another product called FEIBA (anti‐inhibitor coagulant complex or activated PCC) may be the best product to control bleeding. This contains nonactivated factors II, IX, and X, activated factor VII, factor VIII inhibitor bypassing activity, and some factor VIII coagulant antigen. It is usually given in a dose of 500–1000 units.

#### **VIII. Wound Care and Infectious Complications**

#### **A. General Comments**

- **1.** Prophylactic antibiotics are indicated prior to cardiac surgical procedures to minimize the risk of postoperative mediastinitis. A first‐generation cephalosporin is usually chosen (cefazolin), although there is some evidence that a second‐generation drug (cefuroxime) may be more effective.131 Vancomycin is substituted if there is a penicillin allergy and is commonly selected for patients undergoing valve or graft placement because of its effectiveness against Gram‐ positive organisms. The STS guidelines give a level IIb recommendation to give an antibiotic providing Gram‐negative coverage (gentamicin) when vancomycin is used, although this is not common practice, and many groups just use cefazolin along with vancomycin to accomplish that. Antibiotics are started within one hour (cephalosporins) or two hours (vancomycin) of surgery and continued for 24–48 hours. They should not be continued any longer even if invasive lines and catheters remain in place.132,133
- **2.** Wounds closed with subcuticular sutures and covered with 2‐octyl cyanoacrylate adhesive (Dermabond) at the conclusion of surgery do not require dressing coverage. Closed incision negative pressure wound management systems (PREVENA, KCI) applied to a sternotomy wound should be left in place for 5–7 days. If neither of the above is used, the wound should be cleansed and covered with a dressing every day for the first three postoperative days. Subsequent coverage is not necessary unless drainage is noted. All drainage should be cultured and sterile occlusive dressings applied.

- **B. Nosocomial infections** develop in 5–10% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery using CPB. Most infections involve the urinary or respiratory tracts, central IV catheters, or the surgical site. Infections are less common in patients undergoing OPCAB, presumably because of the reduced necessity for blood transfusions and the absence of the immunomodulatory effects of extracorporeal circulation.134,135 A nosocomial infection not only increases the length of stay but also significantly increases operative mortality (to about 20%) because of the frequent development of multisystem organ failure.135–137 *Staphylococcus* is the most common organism noted in bacteremia and wound infections, whereas Gram‐negative infections are more common in the respiratory tract. The high mortality rates of mediastinitis (about 20–25%) and septicemia (30–50%) do not differ much between patients with methicillin‐resistant *S. aureus* (MRSA) and other organisms.138
  - **1. Risk factors** have been identified in multiple studies, most of which are included in the STS risk model for major infection shown in Figure 13.3.139,140 To a large degree, these overlap the risk factors for major mediastinal infections noted on pages 778–779.
    - **a.** Comorbidities: older age, females, diabetes, obesity
    - **b.** Nasal carriage of *S. aureus*, which is associated with a significant incidence of postoperative MRSA infections (about 20%) with a mortality risk of 15–30%.141,142

- **c.** Operative factors: long complex operations, urgent/emergent surgery, reoperations, use of an IABP
- **d.** Postoperative factors (with specific relationships in parentheses)
  - ∙ Hyperglycemia (wound infections)
  - ∙ Prolonged duration of intubation or need for reintubation (pneumonia). The overall risk of ventilator‐associated pneumonia is 5–8%, but it has been estimated to be >50% in patients intubated over 48 hours.143
  - ∙ Prolonged duration of indwelling Foley catheter (UTI), with the risk of bacteriuria increasing 3–8%/day of catheter usage.144
  - ∙ Prolonged duration of central venous catheter placement (bacteremia). Central venous catheters with multiple lumens and those changed over guidewires increase the risk of bacteremia.145,146
  - ∙ Blood transfusions (pneumonia)
  - ∙ Reoperation for bleeding
  - ∙ Empiric use of broad‐spectrum antibiotics
  - ∙ Low cardiac output syndromes
  - ∙ Postoperative stroke
  - ∙ Early development of postoperative renal failure
- **2. Preventative measures** that may reduce the incidence of nosocomial infections include:
  - **a.** Perioperative use of intranasal mupirocin to reduce staphylococcal nasal carriage. Although selective use in carriers is most appropriate and can be accomplished using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assessment, this is not always logistically possible and is not cost‐effective, so it is easier to treat all patients as soon as possible before surgery and for 3–5 days postoperatively.147–149
  - **b.** Chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12% (Peridex) oral rinse has been shown to reduce the rate of nosocomial respiratory infections, wound infections, and mortality.150
  - **c.** Use of a hyperglycemia protocol to maintain early postoperative blood glucose <180 mg/dL.
  - **d.** Early removal of invasive catheters, especially central lines.
  - **e.** Strict adherence to guidelines to avoid prolonged usage of prophylactic antibiotics.133 One study showed that early postoperative pneumonia was usually caused by organisms that colonized the respiratory tract prior to surgery. However, prolonged use of antibiotics was ineffective in reducing the incidence of pneumonia.151
  - **f.** Aggressive ventilatory weaning protocols to reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and other steps to avoid ventilator‐associated pneumonia (see pages 492–493).
  - **g.** Raising the threshold for blood transfusions (transfuse only for a HCT <22% unless clinically indicated).89,90
- **3.** The **treatment** of a nosocomial infection requires appropriate antibiotic selection for the organism involved and recognition of the appropriate time course of treatment. Prolonged treatment is often unnecessary and may lead to the development of resistant strains or fungal infections, and not infrequently to hepatic or renal dysfunction. When a Gram‐positive bacteremia occurs in a

patient with a prosthetic heart valve, a six‐week course of treatment for presumed endocarditis may be indicated. In complex situations, infectious disease consultation is essential.

#### **C. Sepsis**

- **1. Clinical features.** Sepsis resulting in hemodynamic compromise and multisystem organ failure is an uncommon, yet highly lethal, complication of cardiac surgery, with an estimated mortality rate of greater than 30%.152,153 It is usually noted in critically ill patients who remain in the ICU with multiple invasive monitoring lines, develop respiratory complications, and often have some element of renal dysfunction. It may be the first manifestation of an occult sternal wound infection.
- **2. Management.** Basic principles of hemodynamic and ICU management should be initiated early to try to reduce the high mortality rate associated with sepsis. These should include:
  - **a.** Optimization of hemodynamics with fluid resuscitation, inotropic support, and selective use of vasoconstrictors (initially α‐agents, and then vasopressin, if necessary). This should be assessed by adequate hemodynamic monitoring (PA catheter and central or mixed venous oxygen saturations), aiming for an oxygen saturation >70%.
  - **b.** Initiation of broad‐spectrum antibiotic coverage after panculturing with prompt modification to cover the specific organism isolated
  - **c.** Low tidal volume ventilation if ARDS develops; minimizing sedation to promote early extubation
  - **d.** Early aggressive use of renal replacement therapies (CVVH)
  - **e.** Maintaining the blood glucose <180 mg/dL
  - **f.** Adequate nutrition, preferably by the enteral route
  - **g.** VTE prophylaxis (pneumatic compression devices, possibly SC heparin)
  - **h.** Stress ulcer prophylaxis (sucralfate, proton pump inhibitors)
  - **i.** Low‐dose stress steroids to be considered in patients with documented inadequate response to an ACTH challenge
- **D. Sternal wound infections (SWI)** complicate about 1% of cardiac surgical procedures performed via a median sternotomy and have been associated with significant hospital mortality (around 20%). Coagulase‐negative staphylococcus and *S. aureus* are the most common pathogens encountered despite the use of prophylactic antibiotics specifically directed at these organisms. An incidence of only 1% is amazingly low when one considers that open‐ heart surgery tends to be performed in the sickest patients with multiple comorbidities, involves the use of CPB, is associated with a high prevalence of transfusions, and entails prolonged wound exposure. Nonetheless, sternal infections remain a major source of physical, emotional, and economic stress when they occur.154
  - **1. Risk factors.** Numerous models have been devised to predict the risk of developing mediastinitis, including that from the STS (available as part of the risk calculator at sts.org). Among the risk factors identified in numerous studies are the following:135,155,156

- **a.** Comorbidities: obesity (BMI >40),157,158 diabetes (elevated HbA1c),159–161 smoking and COPD,162 HF, renal dysfunction, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), older age, impaired nutritional status (low serum albumin),158 use of steroids, and preoperative MRSA colonization142
- **b.** Surgical considerations that increase risk include:
  - **•** Performing hair removal with razors rather than clippers
  - **•** Emergency surgery
  - **•** Reoperations
  - **•** Bilateral ITA usage in diabetics (controversial)163
  - **•** Prolonged duration of CPB or surgery
  - **•** Need for an IABP
  - **•** Use of bone wax164
  - **•** Contaminated heater/cooler units with mycobacterium chimera, which give rise to latent sternal wound infections165
- **c.** Postoperative complications
  - **•** Excessive mediastinal bleeding, re‐exploration for bleeding, multiple transfusions
  - **•** Prolonged ventilatory support (usually in patients with COPD who are actively colonized)
  - **•** Low cardiac output states (cardiogenic shock) with use of an IABP
  - **•** Refractory hyperglycemia in the ICU, independent of whether the patient has a history of diabetes
  - **•** Acute kidney injury
  - **•** Central venous line‐related bacteremia, which increases the risk fivefold145
- **2. Prevention.**154,166 Because of the fairly universal adoption of the basic perioperative measures listed below, the risk of deep SWI in the STS database is about 1% – and this includes a high percentage of patients with multiple risk factors, especially diabetes, obesity, and smoking. The adoption of newer technologies, such as negative pressure management, has generally not been found to be cost‐effective, except perhaps in patients at highest risk for infection.167

#### **a. Preoperative measures**

- ∙ Identify and treat preexisting infections.
- ∙ Advise patients to stop smoking as soon as possible prior to surgery. Although it is suggested that smoking increases the risk of SWI,162 prominent coughing after surgery in such patients also increases the risk of sternal dehiscence.168
- ∙ Optimize diabetic control after initial evaluation of the patient if HbA1C is >7.5.
- ∙ Optimize nutritional status, if possible, in patients with a low serum albumin (<2.5 mg/dL).
- ∙ Chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12% (Peridex) oral rinse.150
- ∙ Chlorhexidine chest and leg wash several times the night before and the morning of surgery to reduce the bacterial skin count.

- ∙ Intranasal mupirocin (Bactroban) given at a minimum the morning of surgery and continuing for five days to reduce nasal carriage of staphylococcal organisms. This is not beneficial in patients who are MRSA negative, but, unless nasal swabs and PCR testing are performed in advance, it is recommended that all patients be treated with intranasal mupirocin.149 Although very effective against MSSA, mupirocin is only 50% effective in decolonizing patients with MRSA. One concern of universal decolonization is not just cost but the potential risk of developing antibiotic resistance.169
- ∙ Hair clipping just prior to surgery
- ∙ Appropriate timing and dosage of weight‐based prophylactic antibiotics:
  - ⚬ Cephalosporins should be given within one hour of surgery. Cefazolin is recommended and should be given in a dose of 2 g to patients <120 kg and 3 g if >120 kg. IV bolus injection achieves a peak plasma concentration within 20 minutes and peak interstitial levels within 60 minutes, so ideally it should be given 20–30 minutes before surgery starts.135 An additional dose should be given on pump or may be repeated in four hours in off‐pump cases.
  - ⚬ Vancomycin is usually selected for patients undergoing valve surgery or placement of prosthetic grafts and may be given as an alternative to cephalosporins in patients who are allergic to penicillin or cephalosporins. It should be started within two hours of surgery, and given in a dose of 20 mg/ kg. Although not common practice, the 2007 STS guidelines gave a level IIb indication for also giving a single preoperative dose of gentamicin, no more than 4 mg/kg, when vancomycin in used for prophylaxis.132
  - ⚬ If there are contraindications to the above antibiotics, daptomycin (6 mg/kg IV) is usually selected.

#### **b. Intraoperative measures**

- ∙ Careful skin prep with chlorhexidine alcohol may be superior to povidone‐iodine (without alcohol).170–172 Any skin preparation can only reduce the bacterial count but cannot sterilize the skin. One study showed that 89% of subcutaneous wound cultures and 98% of adjacent skin cultures were positive just prior to skin closure after cardiac procedures.173
- ∙ Consideration may be given to use of a microbial sealant that immobilizes bacteria (InteguSeal, Halyard Health). In some studies, this reduced the risk of SWI, but in others, it did not.174–176
- ∙ Use of Ioban rather than standard drapes177
- ∙ Ensure a midline sternotomy and provide a secure sternal closure. Some studies suggest that figure‐of‐eight wires or rigid fixation systems are superior to simple cerclage wires in producing sternal stability and reducing the incidence of wound infection, although a meta‐analysis of closure methods found no difference.178–182 Use of Robicsek basket‐weaving sutures may be considered if the sternum is narrow, osteoporotic, or divided off midline.

- ∙ Be selective in the use of bilateral ITAs in diabetic patients. Skeletonizing the ITA may be helpful, but avoidance of bilateral usage in patients with other risk factors, such as severe obesity and COPD, is prudent.163
- ∙ Use meticulous surgical technique with respect for tissues and obtain adequate hemostasis to minimize mediastinal bleeding.
- ∙ Avoid bone wax.
- ∙ Use intravenous insulin to maintain intraoperative blood sugar <180 mg/ dL.
- ∙ Redose cephalosporins after four hours. One study reported that the risk of SWI was greater when the surgical duration approached six hours and there was a low cefazolin plasma concentration (<104 mg/L) during wound closure.183
- ∙ Tolerate a HCT of 20% on pump; use blood products to help with hemostasis only if absolutely necessary.
- ∙ Use subcuticular sutures rather than skin staples and seal wound with a topical adhesive (Dermabond).
- ∙ One study suggested that application of bacitracin over the closed wound (if Dermabond is not used) was successful in virtually eliminating the risk of deep SWI.184
- ∙ Application of platelet-leukocyte rich gel185 and possibly gentamicincollagen sponges to the sternal edges may reduce the risk of deep SWI.171,186–188 Despite remote literature suggesting that vancomycin paste is helpful, a more recent study showed no benefit.189
- ∙ Consider using a negative pressure wound system in patients at high risk of infection. Studies in patients receiving bilateral ITA grafts had a trend towards a reduced rate of SWI.190 Universal use of these systems does not appear to be cost‐effective.167

#### **c. Postoperative measures**

- ∙ Maintain blood glucose <180 mg/dL in the early postoperative course (48 hours) using an IV insulin protocol.
- ∙ Use a restrictive transfusion trigger for blood (Hb <8 g/dL) and use blood products sparingly after surgery unless clinically indicated.191
- ∙ Plan early extubation and removal of invasive catheters as soon as possible as they can cause bacteremia and result in a SWI.
- ∙ Discontinue antibiotics after 48 hours.
- **3. Presentation** of a mediastinal wound infection can be either overt or occult and often depends on the infectious agent. For example, *S. aureus* infections tend to be virulent and present within the first 10 days of surgery. In contrast, coagulase‐negative staphylococcal infections tend to present late with an insidious onset and have a more indolent course.
  - **a.** A variety of classification systems for sternal wound infections have been proposed, varying with the time to occurrence, the depth and extent of the infection, and whether prior procedures had been attempted.192–194 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and STS definitions (see Appendix 14) differentiate between superficial incisional, deep incisional,

- and organ/space surgical site infections. However, the latter two categories tend to overlap. This is particularly true since it is difficult to rule out sternal or retrosternal infection when the prepectoral fascia or sternal wires are involved in the infectious process. The eventual approach to management usually depends on operative findings.
- **b.** Minor/superficial infections usually present with local tenderness, erythema, serous drainage, or a localized area of wound breakdown with purulent drainage. The sternum is usually stable.
- **c.** Major/deep incisional infections (deep subcutaneous, osteomyelitis, mediastinitis) may have any of the above, but usually present with significant purulent drainage, often with an unstable sternum. The patient commonly has fever, chills, lethargy, and chest wall pain. Leukocytosis is invariably present. Sternal instability may be noted when mediastinitis is present, but, in the absence of other clinical evidence, it may represent a sterile mechanical dehiscence.
- **d.** Inexplicable chest wall pain or tenderness, fever, Gram‐positive bacteremia, or leukocytosis should raise suspicion of a SWI which accounts for more than 50% of postoperative Gram‐positive bacteremias. Occult infections are particularly common in diabetic patients, who often mount a very poor inflammatory response and may present several weeks after surgery with extensive purulent mediastinitis but few systemic signs.
- **e.** A chronic draining sinus tract or sternocutaneous fistula is a common delayed presentation of chronic osteomyelitis, and often originates from the sternal wires.164

#### **4. Evaluation**

- **a.** Assessment of the degree of sternal instability is important in deciding how to proceed. If the sternum is unstable, operative exploration is indicated. If it is stable, further diagnostic tests are warranted in an attempt to identify a deep infection.
- **b.** Culture of purulent drainage may identify the organisms and direct appropriate antibiotic therapy.
- **c.** Wound aspiration may diagnose an infection when purulent drainage is not present.195
- **d.** Chest CT scanning may be beneficial if the sternum is stable. It may help identify a deep infection if there is loss of the integrity of retrosternal soft tissue fat planes or an undrained retrosternal abscess with air. Although there are reports that CT scanning is quite sensitive and specific for diagnosing wound infections,196 one must be cautious in its interpretation because hematoma formation and fibrin along the chest tube tracts are commonly present in the retrosternal area and may be interpreted as "consistent with infection". Clinical correlation and occasionally a wound aspirate are necessary before exploring a patient. A chest CT with three‐dimensional sternal reconstruction is very helpful in identifying a sternal dehiscence and allows the surgeon to adopt an appropriate strategy for closure, whether for a sterile dehiscence or an infection.

- **e.** White cell scanning, using indium111 or technetium labeling, and 99mTc‐ labeled monoclonal granulocyte antibody scintigraphy are among the radionuclide tests that have been helpful in identifying the presence and/or location of infections.197,198 FDG‐PET/CT scanning has also been helpful.199
- **f.** Occasionally, the infection will have to "declare itself " by spontaneous drainage when diagnostic techniques are inconclusive but the clinical suspicion remains high.

#### **5. Treatment of a sterile sternal dehiscence**

- **a.** When there has been a sterile mechanical dehiscence, the patient usually describes increased chest wall movement and pain with breathing that may have been precipitated by a bout of severe coughing. This problem should be repaired when identified. At the time of exploration, wound cultures should be obtained if there is any suspicion of infection to determine whether long‐ term antibiotics might be indicated. An attempt should be made to restabilize the sternum. Problems arise primarily when there has been an off‐center sternotomy or wires that have pulled through one or both sides of the sternum, producing a "chicklet" sternum. At times, placement of Robicsek basket‐weaving sutures on the affected site will allow for standard wire closure. If not, rigid fixation plates (SternaLock Blu, Zimmer Biomet) that extend onto the ribs may be used. If that does not suffice, sternectomy and placement of muscle flaps as described below may be necessary.
- **b.** Use of a rigid fixation system should be considered prophylactically in heavy patients at risk for dehiscence, but should not be used in patients with narrow or osteoporotic sternums. This has been shown to reduce the risk of dehiscence and wound infection.179–182

#### **6. Treatment of minor infections**

- **a.** Minor superficial site infections usually respond to oral antibiotics, opening of the wound, and local wound care. Use of negative pressure wound therapy can be used for larger wounds to expedite closure and may allow for secondary surgical closure, if desired. Persistence of a sinus tract or multiple areas of recurrent breakdown suggest a deeper‐seated infection, often involving the sternal sutures. This usually requires surgical exploration rather than repeated dressing changes. It may respond to simple wire removal and curetting of the involved bone with a six‐week course of antibiotics. Negative‐pressure wound therapy may also be helpful for sternocutaneous fistulas.
- **b.** If the sternal wires or the bone are exposed when the wound is explored, a deeper infection must be ruled out and mediastinal exploration is indicated. This may introduce infection into the mediastinum from the superficial tissues, but may allow for primary reclosure over drains depending on the extent of infection.
- **7. Treatment of major infections.**166,200 Major infections require mediastinal exploration for debridement of infected tissues, removal of foreign bodies (sternal wires or plates), drainage, and elimination of dead space. Antibiotic therapy is generally recommended for six weeks. The approach to achieving wound

- closure is conditional upon the time to development of the infection, the extent of mediastinal purulence, and the degree of sternal involvement.
- **a.** When there is a healthy‐appearing sternum that requires minimal debridement and minimal purulence in the retrosternal space with pliable mediastinal tissue that can eliminate dead space (usually within 2–3 weeks of surgery), primary sternal closure may be attempted with wires or rigid fixation plates.201
- **b.** If there is a large area of dead space behind the sternum or one is worried about exposure of prosthetic material or grafts, placement of omentum may be helpful.202
- **c.** Substernal dilute antibiotic (not povidone‐iodine) irrigation, suction‐irrigation systems, or closed vacuum substernal drainage systems have been used when there is residual mediastinal infection. However, failure to suction out irrigation solutions can lead to cardiac tamponade if more fluid is infused than drained.203,204
- **d.** Although skin closure can be performed, it is often advisable to leave the subcutaneous tissue open with use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), such as the V.A.C. Granufoam dressing (KCI, an Acelity Company), rather than continuous wound packing.
- **e.** If there is a very large wound defect, placement of pectoralis flaps with primary skin closure can be performed immediately or days later. Although more chest wall stability and an improvement in respiratory status can be achieved with sternal closure, performing primary sternal closure will predictably fail if the patient has significant mediastinitis or devascularized bone.
- **f.** When there is severe mediastinitis and purulence, marked sternal necrosis (more likely with bilateral ITA usage), or when sternal osteomyelitis requires extensive debridement or has recurred after previous interventions, the sternum should not be or most likely cannot be reapproximated upon first exploration.
  - **i.** Traditionally, the patient was left intubated and sedated for days with dressings applied directly on the heart until purulence improved. Nutrition was optimized, and then the patient would be returned to the OR for placement of muscle flaps over the heart with primary or delayed skin closure. This could include use of one or two pectoralis major flaps based on the thoracoacromial artery to cover the upper 75% of the wound, use of a right rectus flap (the side opposite LITA usage) based on the superior epigastric artery to cover the bottom 25% of the wound, or the use of an omental flap based on the gastroepiploic artery, which could be mobilized laparoscopically and could cover the entire wound.205 Unless the heart is well mobilized off the sternum at the initial exploration, there is a risk of right ventricular rupture with chest wall distraction, which usually proves fatal.206 Latissimus dorsi flaps are reserved for patients with very large wound defects.207
  - **ii.** To avoid prolonged intubation and potential cardiac damage, an alternative approach is that of immediate coverage after sternal debridement. This is feasible unless there is extensive mediastinitis. Muscle or omental

- flaps as described are placed over the heart using drains beneath the flaps to remove blood and serous fluid. The subcutaneous tissue can be closed primarily, but with an extensive infection, it should be treated with a NPWT dressing to close by secondary intention or secondary closure.
- **iii.** In the patient with extensive mediastinitis and gross purulence, immediate coverage may be unsuccessful or inadvisable and will lead to persistent infection. NWPT can be used, and a barrier (such as xeroform or petroleum gauze) should be placed between the heart and the NPWT dressing to avoid tissue erosion.157,208 This stabilizes the chest wall somewhat, but the coverage is not rigid and does not necessarily prevent displacement of the heart into the space between the sternal halves. Thus RV rupture, although rare, is not necessarily prevented.209 However, NPWT allows for earlier extubation, and will expedite time to eventual closure with muscle or omental flaps or, if there is adequate remaining sternum, to sternal reclosure. This approach of early NPWT dressings over the heart followed a few days later by primary sternal closure or flaps has significantly reduced the mortality associated with deep SWIs.208,210
- **iv.** NPWT dressings consist of a polyurethane ether foam with an evacuation tube that drains into an effluent canister connected to negative suction. This will decrease wound edema, reduce bacterial colonization, produce arteriolar dilatation, and improve microcirculatory flow, which encourages granulation tissue formation and accelerates wound healing. It can be used as a bridge to muscle flap coverage, to subsequent sternal rewiring if an adequate amount of sternum remains, or to closure by secondary intention or secondary suture closure of the subcutaneous tissue.
- **8.** The **prognosis** of patients developing a deep SWI is very poor, but has improved with early recognition and appropriate treatment. However, the long‐ term survival of patients discharged after the treatment of a deep SWI is compromised.211,212 One of the most significant risk factors for mortality is ventilator‐associated pneumonia, so earlier wound coverage or use of NPWT after appropriate mobilization of the heart should allow for earlier weaning from the ventilator. This may reduce the mortality associated with mediastinal wound infections.
- **E. Leg wound** complications have become less common with the universal use of endoscopic vein harvesting techniques.213 This involves a single knee incision and "poke holes" to ligate the vein proximally and distally. Significant bleeding in the endoscopic tract should be addressed surgically, with placement of a drain if there is persistent oozing. Nonetheless, the potential still exists for hematoma formation within the endoscopic tract which causes firmness and ecchymotic changes. Infection may occur at the incision site near the knee, but tract infections are fairly rare. Vein harvesting through one long open incision leads to cellulitis in about 20–30% of patients. This is more likely to occur in patients with severe PVD, diabetes and obesity, and is more common in women. Most complications are related to poor surgical technique with creation of flaps, failure to eliminate dead space, use of excessive suture material, or hematoma formation. With the technique of multiple

skip incisions, infections can also occur in a similar fashion to open incisions, especially since this technique may be accompanied by significant tissue trauma from retraction of the tissues for visualization.

#### **1. Presentation**

- **a.** Cellulitis
- **b.** Wound breakdown with purulent drainage
- **c.** Skin necrosis from thin flaps or a large subcutaneous hematoma; formation of eschar
- **d.** Warm, indurated wound overlying an endoscopic tract, often with accompanying hematoma or skin ecchymosis and significant leg edema

#### **2. Prevention**

- **a.** Use careful surgical technique: avoid tissue trauma, minimize flap formation, obtain meticulous hemostasis, and avoid excessive suture material and tissue strangulation, especially in the small knee incision for endoscopic harvesting.
- **b.** Use antibiotic wound irrigation prior to closure.
- **c.** Roll a sponge over the endoscopic tract prior to closure to evacuate any blood that may have accumulated during heparinization. If there is concern about ongoing bleeding, reinspect the wound after protamine administration to ensure hemostasis and then close the wound. If there remains a concern about bleeding, place a suction drain to evacuate blood and eliminate dead space in the endoscopic tract.
- **d.** Ace wrap the leg fairly tightly at the conclusion of surgery.
- **3. Treatment** of minor leg infections after endoscopic harvest requires oral antibiotics, removal of exposed foreign suture material, and drainage. Infections in endoscopic tunnels may require opening of the skin, but often can be managed by opening the skin incision and placing a Blake drain for antibiotic irrigation.214 If a large hematoma or necrotic skin edges are present after open harvesting, early return to the operating room should be considered to evacuate the hematoma and close the leg primarily. Eschar formation from devitalized flaps may require more aggressive debridement.
- **F. Radial artery harvesting.** Obtaining adequate hemostasis during open harvesting and before performing a layered closure that leaves the fascia open should prevent hematoma formation. Cellulitis is the most common manifestation of infection and will respond to antibiotics. Rarely, a purulent infection may occur that requires further drainage. Endoscopic harvesting is usually performed with a tourniquet in place, and blood accumulating in the endoscopic tract after the tourniquet is released should be manually evacuated. A drain is usually placed to evacuate blood and eliminate the dead space.
- **G. Antibiotic prophylaxis** for dental procedures is mandatory for all patients with prosthetic valves and grafts. The ACC/AHA guidelines for endocarditis prophylaxis changed significantly in 2007 with the recommendation to use antibiotics for dental procedures only in patients with prosthetic material and other patients at higher risk for infection. These recommendations are available online at www.acc. org and are shown in Table 13.7.115,215

Dental prophylaxis is recommended for patients at high risk:

- 1. Prosthetic heart valves and grafts, including homografts
- 2. Prosthetic material used for valve repair (rings, chords)
- 3. Previous infectious endocarditis
- 4. Cardiac transplant recipients with valvular regurgitation due to a structurally abnormal valve
- 5. Unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease
- 6. Repaired congenital heart disease with residual shunts or valvular regurgitation at the site of or adjacent to the site of a prosthetic patch or device

GI/GU procedures do not require prophylaxis, even in patients at high risk Reproduced with permission from Wilson et al., *Circulation* 2007;116:1736–54215; Nishimura et al. Circulation 2017;135:e1159-95.115

#### **IX. Neurologic Complications**

Neurologic complications following cardiac surgery may involve the central nervous system (CNS) or peripheral nerves. CNS injuries are subdivided into ischemic strokes, delirium (encephalopathy), and neurocognitive deficits. Ischemic strokes are usually attributed to either cerebral embolization or hypoperfusion, whereas the mechanism for delirium and neurocognitive deficits is often multifactorial or of unclear etiology. CPB has been incriminated as the culprit for many neurologic complications, since it is associated with aortic cannulation and clamping, periods of hypotension, production of a systemic inflammatory response, and possibly a disruption of the blood–brain barrier. A meta‐analysis did in fact show a 50% reduction in stroke with off‐pump surgery, but this was primarily noted in patients with prior TIAs or stroke.216,217 Otherwise, no difference in neurocognitive function has been shown between on‐ and off‐pump surgery.218,219

#### **A. Central nervous system deficits: ischemic stroke**

#### **1. Risk factors**

- **a. Preoperative factors.** A number of risk factors for postoperative ischemic stroke have been identified.220–224 A risk model incorporating several of these factors can be used to provide an estimated risk of stroke after surgery (Figure 13.4).220
  - ∙ A prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) suggests the presence of cerebrovascular disease or risk factors for its development (such as AF). It is likely that CPB can exacerbate preexisting cerebral ischemia or cause cerebral edema in areas where prior damage has caused disruption of the blood–brain barrier. One study reported that 44% of patients with a history of stroke developed a focal neurologic deficit after surgery. Of these, 8.5% were new, 27% represented reappearance of the old deficit, and 8.5% were worsening of the old deficit.225 Another study reported a fourfold increase in the risk of stroke in patients with prior strokes.226 Notably, a significant percentage of patients without known clinical strokes (ranging from 4.5 to 54% in various series) have preoperative evidence of silent cerebral infarctions on diffusion‐ weighted imaging (DWI) MRI scans, which tends to correlate with the occurrence of postoperative strokes.227–231 These patients tend to be older, have preoperative cognitive impairment, ascending aortic atherosclerosis, and intracranial arterial stenosis.
  - ∙ Cerebrovascular disease, including intracranial and extracranial cerebral artery disease, in addition to carotid disease.232 One study found that bilateral carotid disease of any grade increased the risk of stroke.233
  - ∙ Female gender
  - ∙ Comorbidities, including diabetes, smoking, hypertension, PVD, and renal dysfunction

| Risk Factors      | Weighted Score  |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Age (years)       | (Age-25) × 10/7 |
| Unstable angina   | 14              |
| Diabetes mellitus | 17              |
| Prior stroke/TIA  | 18              |
| Prior CABG        | 15              |
| PVD or CVD        | 18              |
| Pulmonary disease | 15              |

The risk of stroke starts rising exponentially with a score >80.

- ∙ Atrial fibrillation
- ∙ Low ejection fraction or HF; recent MI
- ∙ Reoperative surgery233
- ∙ Urgent/emergent surgery
- ∙ Valvular surgery

#### **b. Intraoperative/postoperative findings/events**

- ∙ Ascending aortic and arch atherosclerosis and calcification234,235
- ∙ Long duration of CPB (>2 hours)
- ∙ High transfusion requirement
- ∙ Left ventricular mural thrombus
- ∙ Opening of a cardiac chamber during surgery with possible air embolization
- ∙ Perioperative hypotension or cardiac arrest
- ∙ Postoperative AF

#### **2. Mechanisms220,236**

- **a.** Thromboembolic strokes account for about two‐thirds of strokes encountered after surgery, usually arise from the aorta, and most commonly affect the right hemiphere.221,237 Aortic manipulation and/or arch disease commonly account for the development of stroke, and minimizing aortic manipulation can reduce that risk.238,239 Transcranial Doppler studies have suggested an association between cerebral complications and the number of microemboli detected during surgery.240 However, despite demonstration that about 45% of patients will have new cerebral infarctions on postoperative DWI, which would be consistent with microembolization, overt manifestations of stroke are not that common.231,241 Embolic sources may be from:
  - ∙ Atherosclerotic aorta (during cannulation, cross‐clamping or unclamping, application of a sideclamp for proximal anastomoses)
  - ∙ Solid (lipid) or gaseous microembolism debris from the extracorporeal circuit, which is more significant in patients in whom cardiotomy suction is utilized
  - ∙ Air embolism from the left heart
  - ∙ Left atrial or left ventricular thrombus (AF is the most common cause of "delayed" stroke)
  - ∙ Platelet‐fibrin debris from carotid ulcerations
  - ∙ Multiple blood and blood component transfusions
- **b.** Cerebral hypoperfusion may result from systemic hypotension or impaired cerebral flow from intra‐ or extracranial carotid disease.
  - ∙ Systemic hypotension is common during CPB, although cerebral autoregulation can maintain cerebral blood flow down to a mean pressure of 40 mm Hg. This compensatory mechanism is usually inoperative in diabetic, hypertensive patients, and may be impaired by cerebral microembolization.242 The blood pressure should be maintained at a higher level in these patients to provide adequate cerebral flow independent of the systemic flow rate.243

- One study showed a fourfold greater incidence of watershed infarcts when there was a 10 mm Hg decrease in intraoperative mean blood pressure compared with preoperative levels.244
- ∙ The blood pressure may be compromised during off‐pump surgery with manipulation of the heart, and is usually reduced pharmacologically during construction of proximal anastomoses when a sideclamp is placed on the ascending aorta.
- ∙ Although stroke is more common in patients with symptomatic carotid disease, it is also higher in patients with asymptomatic high‐grade unilateral or bilateral disease.233 Thus, the potential exists in these patients for cerebral hypoperfusion during an episode of perioperative hypotension resulting in a watershed infarct. One study showed that there was a 3.8% risk of stroke after an isolated CABG in asymptomatic patients with 50–99% unilateral disease and a 6.5% risk in patients with bilateral 50–99% lesions.245
- ∙ Cerebral hypoxemia from a low HCT during CPB may be associated with an increased risk of stroke. One study showed that the risk of stroke increased 10% for every percentage point decrease in HCT, particularly once the HCT was below 21%.246
- **c.** Although risk factors may vary depending on when the stroke occurs, cerebral embolization appears to be the dominant mechanism. Consistent with this hypothesis is a study in which postoperative scanning revealed that 77% of patients had large territory embolic infarcts, 16% were watershed, and 7% had a mixed pattern.247
- **3. Presentation.** The percentage of "early strokes" (noted upon emergence from anesthesia) vs. "delayed strokes" (occurring after a period of normal neurologic recovery) varies in different studies, some indicating that early strokes are more common248 and some that delayed strokes are more common,249,250 with a meta‐ analysis finding there was an equal distribution.251 Although the clinical presentation depends primarily on the site and extent of the cerebral infarction, the prognosis is better for patients suffering delayed strokes.248–251 The risk factors also tend to differ depending on the time of occurrence of stroke: early strokes are more common in patients with prior stroke, aortic atherosclerosis, and a long duration of bypass.248 Delayed strokes are often noted in patients developing AF as well as in those with known cerebrovascular disease and low cardiac output states.248 However, one study found that AF was a risk factor for delayed stroke only if accompanied by a low cardiac output state.249
  - **a.** A significant percentage of patients develop silent brain injury during surgery with new DWI MRI abnormalities noted in 25–50% of patients.231,252 In fact, following TAVR, MRI scans show new "asymptomatic" abnormalities in 77.5–90% of patients!253,254
  - **b.** Focal deficits most commonly produce hemiparesis/hemiplegia, aphasia, or dysarthria. Visual deficits may occur as the result of retinal embolization, occipital lobe infarction, or anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.255 The latter is more common in patients with long pump runs with extreme hemodilution. One study found that posterior strokes involving the posterior cerebral artery

and cerebellum were the most common location, although embolization to the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was also encountered in about 50% of patients since multiple emboli were commonly noted.256 Another found that the distributions of the MCA and anterior cerebral artery were the most common locations.221

- **c.** TIAs or reversible neurologic deficits (RNDs)
- **d.** Dysphagia with risk for aspiration
- **e.** Severe confusion or delirium
- **4. Prevention** of neurologic complications requires the identification and appropriate management of potential precipitating factors in the pre‐, intra‐, and postoperative periods.
  - **a.** Preoperative **evaluation for extracranial carotid disease** should be considered in any patient with current or remote neurologic symptoms or the presence of a carotid bruit. Some centers do this routinely and others do this selectively, with no evidence that neurologic outcomes differ. Noninvasive studies followed by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), if indicated, may identify significant carotid disease. One study found that the presence of intracranial and extracranial cerebral artery disease detected by MRA was more predictive of stroke risk than extracranial carotid disease.233
    - **i.** The approach to symptomatic carotid disease invariably entails either a preliminary carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or stenting or a simultaneous CABG‐CEA procedure.257
    - **ii.** For patients with asymptomatic carotid disease, management is more controversial. With the hypothesis that hypoperfusion might occur during a period of hypotension during or after coming off CPB when significant carotid disease is present, a concomitant operation is often performed for unilateral carotid disease >80–90% or bilateral high‐grade disease or contralateral occlusion (a class IIa indication).106 Performing a preliminary carotid procedure or simultaneous procedure appears to lower the risk of stroke with comparable results for either approach.258
  - **b.** Perioperative use of aspirin has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke by 50%.259
  - **c.** Preoperative use of statins may lower not only the risk of stroke but also the risk of delirium.260,261
  - **d.** Intraoperative epiaortic echocardiography can be used to identify aortic atherosclerosis that might alter cannulation and clamping techniques to prevent manipulation of a diseased ascending aorta.262,263 If not used routinely, it should be considered in patients with other markers for aortic atherosclerosis, such as hypertension, PVD, cerebrovascular disease, CKD, and COPD, or when increased thickness of the descending aorta is noted by TEE.264
  - **e.** Optimize blood pressure during CPB. Studies have shown that maintaining a mean pressure >80 mm Hg rather than in the 50–60 mm Hg range will reduce neurologic complications.243

- **f.** Use of cerebral oximetry may identify a significant decrease in regional cerebral oxygenation that can be improved by various maneuvers, such as maintaining a higher mean arterial pressure during CPB, raising the PCO2 to increase cerebral blood flow, or transfusing for a profound anemia. Theoretically, these interventions should be able to reduce the incidence of neurologic impairment, especially watershed infarcts caused by low flow.265–267 Some studies have noted that impaired autoregulation of cerebral blood flow was present in 20% of patients and the amount of time below the lower limit of autoregulation correlated with perioperative neurologic morbidity.268,269
- **g.** Minimize aortic manipulation during surgery.238,239 For on‐pump bypass surgery, use of single aortic cross‐clamping for construction of both distal and proximal anastomoses, rather than application of a sideclamp for the latter, may reduce the incidence of stroke.270 For off‐pump surgery, use of a proximal anastomotic occluder, such as the Heartstring device (MAQUET) to avoid aortic side‐clamping, or avoidance of cross‐clamping altogether with use of the ITAs as inflow vessels may be beneficial. In patients with severe aortic calcification requiring CPB, circulatory arrest may be indicated to avoid aortic cross‐clamping.
- **h.** Avoidance of hyperglycemia may reduce the risk of neurocognitive dysfunction, especially in nondiabetics.271 However, excessively strict glucose control may actually increase the risk of stroke.272
- **i.** Avoid systemic (and inferentially cerebral) hyperthermia during rewarming, which is associated with a higher risk of stroke and neurocognitive deficits.273
- **j.** Maintain a satisfactory HCT on pump. Most studies suggest using a lower limit of 20% since lower levels have been linked to stroke and neurocognitive dysfunction.274 However, the STS guidelines only recommend transfusions for a Hb <6 g/dL (HCT <18%) unless the patient is at increased risk for decreased cerebral oxygen delivery, such as patients with diabetes, older age, known cerebrovascular disease, or myocardial dysfunction, or considered at risk for end‐organ ischemia.88 However, this includes a large proportion of patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
- **k.** Particulate emboli can be captured by use of the Embol‐X intra‐aortic filter (Edwards Lifesciences) that is deployed at the time of unclamping and used until the patient is off bypass.
- **l.** Flooding of the operative field with carbon dioxide to evacuate air, especially during valve cases, may reduce the incidence of neurologic impairment.275
- **m.**Pharmacologic prevention of AF and initiating anticoagulation when it occurs may reduce the risk of delayed stroke.223,248,276 Anticoagulation is usually started after 48 hours of continuous AF or for recurrent episodes of AF. Consideration should be given to ligating the left atrial appendage in all patients undergoing surgery with preoperative AF, even if a Maze procedure is not performed. Whether this should be done routinely because of the 25% overall incidence of postoperative AF is debatable.
- **n.** Routine MRI scanning following TAVR has shown new cerebral infarcts in up to 90% of patients.253,254 However, although cerebral protection devices have been reported to trap debris in 99% of patients,277 they have not been shown to reduce the total number of new ischemic lesions, despite a slight reduction in new lesion volume, and have not shown any impact on the risk of clinical stroke

- or neurocognitive changes.278 Nonetheless, these devices might be considered in patients in whom there is more calcific burden, such as patients undergoing valve‐in‐valve procedures for prosthetic valve stenosis.
- **5. Evaluation** of neurologic deficits requires an assessment of the degree of functional impairment by careful neurologic examination and identification of the anatomic extent of cerebral infarction by CT or DWI MRI scanning. Scanning is most important in assessing whether hemorrhage is present or not, since up to 30% of infarctions may develop hemorrhagic conversion that will contraindicate use of heparin.247 In nearly 70% of patients with focal deficits, the initial CT scan will not show evidence of an infarction, although abnormalities will usually be evident on subsequent scans.279 Ideally, a DWI MRI should be obtained because it is more sensitive than CT scanning in identifying ischemic changes, watershed infarcts, or multiple embolic infarcts. However, this procedure can be difficult to obtain in a critically ill patient on a ventilator and multiple infusion pumps. Furthermore, it is important to analyze whether the findings are consistent with an acute perioperative infarct or were preexistent, since preoperative MRI scans are usually not obtained and yet are abnormal in up to 50% of patients.231 Evaluation should also be undertaken to search for a possible source of the stroke that might require additional attention (echocardiogram, carotid noninvasive studies).

#### **6. Treatment**

- **a.** The use of heparin in patients suffering an embolic stroke is controversial. It is recommended for patients with AF, possible valve thrombus, or other sources of intracardiac thrombus, but has unclear benefit in preventing further aortic atheroembolism. It might improve cerebral microcirculatory flow, but the possibility of subsequent hemorrhage into an infarct zone must always be taken into consideration. Some neurologists feel that heparin should be withheld for at least 72 hours to minimize the risk of hemorrhagic conversion.
- **b.** Use of a clot retrieval device may be considered within 6–8 hours of the development of an ischemic stroke.
- **c.** Standard measures to reduce intracranial pressure, including diuresis, mannitol, and steroids, may be indicated depending on the extent of cerebral infarction.
- **d.** A CEA may be considered in patients with severe carotid stenosis and postoperative transient neurologic deficits or small strokes.
- **e.** Early institution of physical therapy is important.
- **7. Prognosis** is favorable for patients with small or temporary deficits, but the operative mortality rate for patients suffering permanent strokes is around 20%.221,224,280 The outlook for comatose patients is extremely poor, with over 50% dying or remaining in a vegetative state. Five‐year survival following a postoperative stroke is only about 50–60%, with most patients continuing to manifest moderate–severe disability.224,280–282 With such a dismal prognosis, any steps that can possibly be taken to reduce the occurence of stroke must be entertained.
- **B. Encephalopathy and delirium** represent an acute change in the patient's mental status that is associated with global impairment of cognitive function.
  - **1.** Several risk factors and contributory clinical scenarios for delirium have been identified, and risk models have been developed to predict its occurrence.283–287 However,

the etiology and pathophysiology are not always clear. The presence of both preexisting and new postoperative cerebral infarcts on MRI are independent risk factors for postoperative delirium, so underlying cerebral damage may leave the brain susceptible to an additional insult from surgery, whether it be microembolization or mild degrees of cerebral hypoperfusion.286–288 However, some studies suggest that there is no correlation of microembolization with the occurrence of delirium.289 Therefore, it has been suggested that neuroinflammation associated with the systemic inflammatory response, endothelial dysfunction, and disruption of the blood–brain barrier associated with use of CPB may be the underlying mechanism.290 However, although some studies have suggested that there is a slightly lower incidence of delirium after OPCABs,291 others have not found any difference.286 In general, it appears that various medications and metabolic and clinical issues that prolong the ICU stay are responsible for precipitating delirium in patients with predisposing risk factors.

#### **2. Predisposing risk factors236,285,286,292–296**

- **a.** Older age (estimated at >20% in patients >age 65 and >30% in patients >age 80)293
- **b.** Recent use of alcohol, opiates, benzodiazepines, or preoperative antipsychotics
- **c.** Preoperative organic brain diseases
  - **i.** Neurologic diseases: prior stroke, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and other forms of dementia
  - **ii.** Psychiatric disorders: depression, schizophrenia
  - **iii.** Impaired executive or cognitive function with low mini‐mental scores294
- **d.** Severe cardiac disease and high‐risk status at the time of surgery (cardiogenic shock, urgent status, severe LV dysfunction)
- **e.** Associated medical problems including AF, smoking, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, PVD, CKD, and poor nutritional status (low albumin)
- **f.** Complex and prolonged surgical procedures on CPB

#### **3. Precipitating factors**

- **a.** Abnormalities during CPB: low flow rates, low blood pressure, low HCT, low cerebral saturations by cerebral oximetry
- **b.** Medications: benzodiazepines, propofol, and analgesics292
- **c.** ICU issues: sleep deprivation, too much light at night, physical restraints
- **d.** Metabolic disturbances
- **e.** Alcohol withdrawal
- **f.** Multiple blood transfusions
- **g.** Postoperative adverse events: low cardiac output, AKI, hypoxia and prolonged ventilation, and stroke
- **h.** Infections, with or without sepsis

#### **4. Manifestations<sup>296</sup>**

- **a.** Hyperactive delirium is manifested by agitation and restlessness.
- **b.** Hypoactive delirium is associated with lethargy, flat affect, or decreased responsiveness.
- **c.** Disorientation, confusion, attention deficit, memory loss, disturbed sleep/wake cycle
- **d.** Paranoia and hallucinations

- **5. Evaluation.** Various models have been devised to identify delirium and can be used to ascertain when interventions may be indicated.
  - **a.** The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM‐ICU) includes four features required to diagnose delirium: the acute onset of changes or fluctuations in the course of mental status, inattention, and either disorganized thinking or altered level of consciousness.297
  - **b.** The Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) includes eight items: altered level of consciousness, inattention, disorientation, hallucinations or delusions, psychomotor agitation or retardation, inappropriate mood or speech, sleep/wake cycle disturbance, and symptom fluctuation. Most patients with delirium have at least four of these features.298
  - **c.** Review current medications and drug levels.
  - **d.** Identify possible history of recent alcoholism or substance abuse.
  - **e.** Neurologic examination and brain CT or MRI.

#### **6. Management296,299**

- **a.** Use soft restraints and keep siderails up to prevent falls out of bed.
- **b.** Avoid sleep deprivation, encourage early mobilization, use daily interruptions of sedation if on a ventilator.
- **c.** Correct metabolic abnormalities.
- **d.** Stop inappropriate medications. Try to avoid benzodiazepines and opiates, which can cause delirium, and if delirium is present, they can exacerbate confusion and produce agitation and stupor, especially in elderly patients. Olanzapine (Zyprexa), a thieno‐benzodiazepine, is considered an atypical antipsychotic which has been used successfully in delirious critically ill patients and has been associated with fewer side effects than haloperidol.300
- **e.** Carefully select sedative medications in the ICU to minimize the risk of delirium. Dexmedetomidine is associated with less postoperative delirium than propofol or midazolam when used for immediate postoperative sedation.301,302 It is also more effective than haloperidol in controlling the agitated, delirious, intubated patient, allowing for earlier extubation.303
- **f.** Select the appropriate medication to control agitation and the delirious state. Generally, most of these medications have equal efficacy, but side effects vary.304–306
  - **i.** Haloperidol 2.5–5.0 mg PO/IM/IV q6h is the most commonly prescribed medication for delirium. One should always be aware of the risk of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes in patients receiving IV haloperidol.307 It can cause extrapyramidal side effects, which may occur within 48 hours of starting the medication.
  - **ii.** Ondansetron (Zofran) is a 5‐HT3 ‐receptor antagonist that counteracts activation of the serotoninergic system. It is primarily indicated for the control of postoperative nausea, but is also successful in treating postcardiotomy delirium without major side effects. It is given in a dose of 4–8 mg IV or PO. One study showed equal efficacy to use of haloperidol for treatment of postcardiotomy delirium.308 A similar medication dolasetron (Anzemet) 12.5–25 mg IV can also be used.

- **iii.** Several atypical antipsychotics are also beneficial in managing delirium.304–307
  - **•** Risperidone (0.5 mg PO twice a day) acts by antagonizing dopamine D2 and serotonin 5‐HT2 receptors. It is generally well tolerated, but may be associated with extrapyramidal effects. One study showed that administration of 1 mg of risperidone upon regaining consciousness reduced the incidence of delirium by 67%.309 Another showed that early treatment with risperidone for subsyndromal delirium (a CAM‐ ICU score positive for 2/4 features or an ICDSC score of 1–3 out of 8) significantly reduced the risk of frank delirium.310
  - **•** Olanzapine starting at 2.5 mg daily and increasing to 10 mg daily provides comparable benefits to haloperidol, although it is more sedating.300
  - **•** Quetiapine (Seroquel) using a starting dose of 12.5 mg daily produces even more sedation and can cause hypotension as well as QT prolongation.
- **g.** Treat suspected alcohol withdrawal311
  - **i.** The Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA) score can be used in assessing the degree of withdrawal. Pharmacologic treatment is indicated for a CIWA score >10.
  - **ii.** Benzodiazepines (lorazepam, diazepam, or chlordiazepoxide) may need to be given for a few days, during which time the patient may require a few additional days of ventilatory support or may require reintubation while being sedated.
  - **iii.** Thiamine 50–100 mg IM/PO bid and folate 1 mg PO qd
  - **iv.** Psychotherapy: reassurance and support
- **7. Outcomes.** Delirium is associated with more postoperative complications, longer ICU stays, increased perioperative mortality, more hospital readmissions, and reduced quality of life. It contributes to cognitive dysfunction, including impaired attention span, memory, perception, and motor function that may persist for up to one year or even longer. It is also associated with greater functional impairment, reducing independence in activities of daily living and affecting mobility for at least six months. It may also increase the long‐term risk of death and stroke.312–315
- **C. Neurocognitive dysfunction** (NCD) is manifested by problems with memory and executive and cognitive function and is a fairly common complication of cardiac surgery. Depending on the timing and extent of neuropsychiatric testing, the incidence has been reported to be as high as 63%.316–318 Numerous studies have found that off‐ pump surgery does not reduce the risk of early or late NCD,319–322 despite one meta‐ analysis suggesting it does.323 In fact, the rate of cognitive decline or impairment in memory after six years appears to be no different in coronary artery disease patients managed medically or surgically.324–326 Thus, the development of progressive NCD after surgery is probably more related to the patient's baseline cognitive function and comorbidities than to specific precipitating factors postoperatively.

#### **1. Predisposing factors**

**a.** Risk factors include older age, diabetes, hypertension, preexisting cerebrovascular disease, chronic disabling neurologic illnesses, and lack of social support.327 Noncoronary atherosclerosis may be a risk factor, but aortic atheroma burden has not been consistently found to be associated with cognitive dysfunction.328,329

- **b.** Numerous studies have addressed the relationship between preexisting cognitive abnormalities or abnormal MRI scans and the development of postoperative cognitive decline.
  - **i.** Preoperative cognitive abnormalities have been noted in up to 45% of patients undergoing CABG.330,331 Patients with less cognitive reserve, dementia, or anxiety/depression are inclined to experience more disabling cognitive dysfunction.
  - **ii.** Although NCD may occur in the absence of demonstrable ischemic lesions on DWI, the presence of pre‐ or postoperative cerebral infarction, whether symptomatic or not, is likely to be associated with neurocognitive decline. It is estimated that up to 50% of patients have preexisting silent cerebral infarcts and 25–50% develop new postoperative infarcts.227–230,252,331–333 Although most new infarcts are silent,252,332 some studies suggest that virtually all patients with abnormal MRIs have evidence of NCD.317 One study found that two‐thirds of patients with multiple cerebral infarctions were asymptomatic, but 25% did develop cognitive decline.228 Another found that early NCD, but not new ischemic brain lesions, was predictive of late NCD.333
- **2. Mechanisms** for early and late postoperative cognitive decline appear to be different. Early decline may be related to cerebral microembolization, hypoperfusion, or the systemic inflammatory response to CPB, and may be reversible. Late decline is most likely related to preexisting cerebrovascular disease.334
  - **a.** Cerebral microembolization is often thought to be the cause of cognitive decline, but the fairly comparable incidence of NCD with on‐ and off‐pump surgery (despite more embolization during on‐pump surgery) and lack of strong evidence correlating embolization and cognitive decline call this hypothesis into question.335–338 The correlation between aortic atherosclerosis and NCD is also controversial, in contrast to the clear association of atherosclerosis with the occurrence of perioperative stroke. One study did show a slight reduction in early NCD with use of a cell‐saving device to reduce lipid embolization, but this benefit was not evident at one year, suggesting that progressive cerebrovascular disease was responsible for late NCD.339
  - **b.** Cerebral hypoperfusion is often considered the mechanism causing encephalopathy, delirium, and NCD. This may result from perioperative hypotension, either due to low pressures on CPB or soon thereafter, and may be incriminated if there is a significant or prolonged decrease in cerebral oxygen saturation noted by cerebral oximetry during CPB.267
  - **c.** The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) may be a contributory factor to neurologic injury, although not a causative mechanism.
  - **d.** Intraoperative hyperglycemia and hyperthermia during rewarming have been associated with NCD.271,273

#### **3. Presentation**

- **a.** Neurocognitive abnormalities include a deterioration in intellectual function and impaired memory. Forgetfulness, problems with word finding, altered attention span, reduction in psychomotor function, and impaired visual and verbal memory may be present.
- **b.** In some patients, the degree of cognitive dysfunction is immediately obvious; in others, it can only be detected by comparison of pre‐ and postoperative studies.

- **4. Prevention.** Steps to reduce cerebral embolization and maintenance of a higher perfusion pressure during surgery may be helpful in patients at high risk. Other recommended strategies include α‐stat pH regulation during profound hypothermia cases (see page 302), control of intraoperative glucose levels, and avoidance of cerebral hyperthermia during rewarming. Cerebral oximetry may be useful in identifying cerebral desaturation that has been associated with watershed infarcts, but it has not been shown conclusively to predict the occurrence of cognitive dysfunction.266
- **5. Evaluation.** MRI scanning often shows multiple infarctions, although such findings are also commonly seen in patients who are asymptomatic and may have been present preoperatively. Brain SPECT studies have shown worse cerebral perfusion at baseline and during surgery in patients with cognitive decline after surgery.
- **6. Natural history.** The duration of cognitive decline varies in numerous studies. One seminal study of CABG patients reported that 53% of patients had cognitive decline at hospital discharge, which decreased to 24% at six months but then increased to 42% at five years.316 Most studies conclude that cognitive function improves from the time of hospital discharge up to one year, and then remains relatively stable or slightly worse during subsequent follow‐up.340 The fact that long‐ term cognitive function was similar in patients with coronary disease managed surgically or medically suggests that the late decline is most likely due to the presence of poorly controlled risk factors for cerebrovascular disease, including hypertension and diabetes.324–326
- **D. Psychiatric problems** are fairly common in patients undergoing open‐heart surgery. Anxiety and depression occur frequently in patients with known psychiatric disorders, but are also noted in patients who have lost family members due to heart disease. The occurrence of these symptoms after surgery is associated with an unfavorable outcome, including early and late mortality.341–343 Exacerbation of preexisting disorders, including depression, bipolar disorder, and personality disorders, is also not unusual. A psychiatrist with an interest in postoperative problems is invaluable in helping patients resolve distressing psychiatric symptoms and in providing advice on the appropriate use of psychotropic medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy and stress management support are helpful in alleviating postoperative depression.344
- **E. Seizures** may accompany cerebral insults from hypoxia, or air and particulate emboli. However, they can also result from medication overdoses (e.g. lidocaine). Contributing factors should be addressed and the patient evaluated by a neurologist. A CT or MRI scan, EEG, or anticonvulsant therapy should be considered upon advice from a neurologist.
- **F. Critical illness polyneuropathy** is a syndrome of unknown etiology that complicates the course of sepsis and multisystem organ failure, and is associated with prolonged ventilation, longer ICU stays, and an increased mortality rate that approaches 50%. It usually presents as failure to wean from the ventilator due to weakness of the diaphragm and chest wall muscles. Axonal degeneration of motor and sensory fibers is the underlying pathologic process and is manifested by proximal muscle atrophy and paresis, decreased deep tendon reflexes, and, in some cases, by laryngeal and pharyngeal weakness, producing swallowing difficulties. It may produce motor and sensory deficits and can be diagnosed by electromyography and nerve conduction studies. The syndrome is self‐limited and is managed by supportive care (ventilatory support and

physical therapy), early mobilization, intensive insulin therapy to control hyperglycemia, and avoidance of neuromuscular blockers and steroids. About half of the patients developing this problem recover completely, but it may take 1–3 months to do so. It must be distinguished from other causes of postoperative muscle weakness, such as medications, nutritional deficiency, disuse atrophy, and other neuromuscular disorders.345,346

#### **G. Brachial plexus injuries**

- **1. Etiology and prevention.** Stretch of the inferior cords of the brachial plexus by lateral sternal retraction or asymmetric elevation during ITA harvesting with compression of the brachial plexus between the clavicle and first rib is the most common cause of this injury.347–349 The incidence may be minimized by cautious and limited asymmetric retraction for ITA takedown, ensuring a midline sternotomy, caudad placement of the retractor, opening it only as much as necessary for adequate exposure, and maintaining a neutral head position.11 The incidence may also be lessened by positioning the patient in the "hands up" position. Despite taking all of these precautions, a small number of patients will still develop a brachial plexus stretch injury, most likely related to their individual chest wall architecture. Routine electrophysiologic studies identify abnormalities in upwards of 20% of patients, although most patients are asymptomatic.350 First rib fractures are often noted by bone scan, although they are frequently missed by routine chest x‐rays.
- **2. Presentation.** Sensory changes, including numbness, paresthesia, and occasionally sharp pains as well as weakness are common in the ulnar nerve distribution (T8– T1), which commonly affects the fourth and fifth fingers. Weakness of the interosseous muscles may also be noted. In more extreme forms, the median or radial nerve distribution may be involved. Radial nerve deficits are more likely to be caused by direct arm compression from retraction bars used for the ITA takedown or from positioning issues.
- **3. Evaluation.** Electromyography, motor and sensory conduction velocities, and somatosensory‐evoked potentials can be used to assess changes in nerve function, but their significance is not clear. They may be useful in assessing the extent of the deficit and the return of function.
- **4. Treatment.** Symptoms resolve in more than 95% of patients within a few months. Rarely, recovery may take up to a year, and some patients may have persistent, bothersome symptoms. Physical therapy is essential to maintain motor tone. If the patient has significant pain, amitriptyline (Elavil) 10–25 mg qhs, gabapentin (Neurontin) starting at 300 mg qd, or carbamazepine (Tegretol) 50–100 mg qid may be helpful.
- **H. Paraplegia** is a very rare complication of open‐heart surgery caused by spinal cord infarction. It is most common after thoracoabdominal surgery or extensive endovascular stenting. It may also result from an aortic dissection or as a complication of an IABP, presumably on the basis of atherosclerotic plaque shift or rupture, or cholesterol embolism to the spinal cord. There are rare case reports of paraplegia occurring after isolated CABGs, usually caused by a period of hypotension in a patient with preexisting hypertension and severe vascular disease that compromises spinal cord perfusion.351–353 There is one case report of embolization to bilateral anterior cerebral arteries causing paraplegia.354

- **I. Common peroneal or sciatic/tibial nerve palsies** are rare complications of surgery that usually have no identifiable contributing factor. Common peroneal nerve injuries cause weakness and sensory changes over the lateral lower leg and foot, whereas tibial nerve problems affect the posterior calf and dorsum of the foot. Direct nerve injury is impossible during vein harvesting, so the suspected mechanism is ischemia caused by direct pressure on the nerves with leg positioning. Older patients with diabetes, PVD, and subnormal body weight with atrophic tissues may be more predisposed to this problem, which is more likely to occur during longer operations involving CPB. However, in most cases, this complication is an unpredictable and unpreventable event. Fortunately, most patients recover satisfactory sensorimotor function and are not limited in their activities.355
- **J. Compartment syndrome (CS)** may develop following periods of prolonged compromised blood flow to the lower extremities. It may rarely affect the thigh musculature.
  - **1. Mechanism.** A compartment syndrome develops when the interstitial tissue tension within a confined compartment exceeds the pressure in the microcirculation, resulting in tissue ischemia. A prolonged period of ischemia followed by reperfusion results in cell membrane damage with fluid leakage into the interstitial compartment, which initially compromises the blood supply to nerve tissue and eventually will compress major blood vessels, causing loss of pulses. Thus, loss of pulses is one of the last manifestations of a compartment syndrome, at which time tissue loss has already occurred.
  - **2. Predisposing factors.** CS is rarely encountered with use of an IABP, most likely because of vigilant attention to leg edema and distal perfusion and the absence of a documented period of prolonged severe leg ischemia. However, CS has been noted in patients requiring prolonged groin cannulation (usually >4–6 hours) for CPB (aortic surgery, minimally invasive or robotic surgery) or for prolonged ECMO support. There are case reports of its occurrence after CABG, following both open and endoscopic vein harvesting.356–360 With the latter technique, the proposed mechanism is retraction of divided venous or arterial branches, which then bleed into the muscle.
  - **3. Prevention.** CS can be prevented by using alternative methods of groin cannulation that allow for distal perfusion (sewing a graft to the femoral artery or proximal and distal cannulation).361,362 However, these are rarely done, because the anticipated duration of CPB may be unpredictable, usually being lengthened when there are technical problems during the surgical procedure. Although placing a femoral arterial cannula via the Seldinger technique avoids the placement of a distal snare, distal flow is quite limited by the size of the cannula and by vasoconstriction during periods of hypothermia during surgery. Distal perfusion with a small cannula or side‐arm sheath must be assured when a longer duration of femoral perfusion (such as with femoral cannulation for ECMO) is anticipated. Obtaining adequate hemostasis during endoscopic vein harvesting should avoid development of a CS after CABG.
  - **4. Monitoring and treatment.** Any patient with a prolonged period of groin cannulation requires careful assessment for the development of a CS. Because patients are anesthetized and sedated for a number of hours, they are unable to complain of severe leg pain, which is one of the first manifestations of a compartment syndrome. Assessment of calf diameter and palpation for tenseness and tenderness, if

possible, are essential. Comparison with the contralateral leg may be beneficial, although less helpful if vein harvesting has been performed. If there is any doubt, obtaining a compartment pressure with a needle attached to a manometer is helpful. A pressure greater than 35 mm Hg or within 20 mm of the diastolic pressure is generally consistent with a compartment syndrome. If suspected, the patient should be returned to the operating room for a four‐compartment fasciotomy. The wound can be closed several days later if muscle tissue is still viable once the edema resolves. The muscle becomes nonviable from inside to out, so the superficial muscle may bleed despite ongoing necrosis of deeper muscle, and careful reassessment is important.

- **5.** A compartment syndrome involving the hand and forearm may occur after endoscopic radial artery harvesting but is more common when there has been inadvertent infiltration of an intravenous line through which large volumes of fluid, especially blood, are given. This is often not recognized until the drapes have been removed, but is immediately obvious because the forearm and hand are pale, mottled, tense, and massively swollen. Removal of the arterial line from that side and an immediate fasciotomy are indicated.363,364
- **K. Saphenous neuropathy** is caused by damage to small branches of the saphenous nerve that lies adjacent to the saphenous vein in the lower leg.11,348 This causes sensory changes along the medial side of the calf and foot to the level of the great toe. It is fairly common after open vein harvesting and is more likely with vein harvesting from the ankle up than from the top down. It is proposed that the former is more likely to cause avulsion of the pretibial or infrapatellar branches of the nerve. Neuropathy is also more common when an open incision is closed in two layers, producing neuropraxia from too tight a closure. These symptoms are much less frequent when the vein is harvested endoscopically, but damage to the nerve in the lower leg can still occur.
- **L. Forearm neurologic symptoms** following radial artery harvesting are not unusual. In one study comparing open vs. endoscopic harvesting, symptoms occurred in 42% and 64% of patients after open and endoscopic harvesting, respectively. Impaired sensation and paresthesia were more common in the superficial radial nerve distribution with open harvesting, but damage to the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve was only seen with open harvests.365
- **M. Vocal cord paralysis** has been noted in 1–2% of patients after cardiovascular operations and is initially manifested by hoarseness. A number of possible etiologies have been elucidated, but most involve an indirect injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve producing a reversible neuropraxia.366,367 A major contributing factor is a longer operation, which is usually associated with a longer period of postoperative intubation. Direct injury may occur during ITA mobilization at the apex of the chest, during central line placement, or during aortic arch surgery. In addition to hoarseness, vocal cord paralysis leads to an ineffective cough, stridor, and the potential for aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. Diagnosis can be made by laryngoscopy, which will distinguish it from laryngeal edema. Symptomatic improvement usually occurs within a few months, but if symptoms persist, it is more likely that the injury is permanent. In that situation, vocal cord medialization or thyroplasty may be indicated for unilateral paralysis.

#### **X. Gastrointestinal Complications**

#### **A. Mechanisms and predisposing factors**

- **1.** Gastrointestinal (GI) complications develop in approximately 4% of patients undergoing open‐heart surgery. Because they frequently occur in critically ill patients, they are often associated with other major adverse postoperative complications, such as low cardiac output syndromes, stroke, and respiratory and renal failure. A US nationwide study of patients undergoing cardiac surgery from 2010– 2012 reported a threefold increase in operative mortality (10.8%), with doubling of the length of stay, when GI complications occur.368
- **2.** The common pathophysiologic mechanism is sympathetic vasoconstriction, hypoperfusion, and hypoxia of the splanchnic bed.369–371 This may occur during CPB when there is nonpulsatile flow at low mean pressures with regional redistribution of blood flow away from gut mucosa. However, studies have demonstrated that mesenteric hypoperfusion and gastric mucosal hypoxia are present to a similar extent with OPCAB.372,373 Postoperative low cardiac output states, hypotension, and use of vasoconstrictors may also result in inadequate tissue perfusion, causing mucosal hypoxia with a reduction in absorptive and barrier functions. This may result in stress ulceration, mucosal atrophy, bacterial overgrowth from stress ulcer prophylaxis, and increased permeability, which in turn may potentially lead to bacterial translocation, the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis, and multisystem organ failure.374
- **3.** Predictive factors for the development of GI complications have been evaluated in multiple studies and include:375–380
  - **a. Preoperative comorbidities:** older age, CKD, PVD, active smoking, prior GI surgery, use of anticoagulants
  - **b. Preoperative cardiac status:** poor LV function or NYHA class IV, preoperative inotropic support, urgent or emergent surgery
  - **c. Operative factors:** reoperations, combined valve‐CABG cases, long durations of CPB (>120–150 minutes), multiple blood transfusions
  - **d. Postoperative issues:** low cardiac output syndrome and hypotension (with use of inotropes, vasoconstrictors, and/or an IABP), bleeding and need for transfusions or re‐exploration, use of bicarbonate for a metabolic acidosis, prolonged ventilation, AF, excessive anticoagulation, vascular complications, sepsis, sternal infections
  - **e.** Three of the strongest predictors of GI complications are prolonged mechanical ventilation, AKI, and sepsis, which together contribute to splanchnic hypoperfusion, hypomotility, and mucosal hypoxia.376
- **4.** A risk stratification model using a gastrointestinal complication score (GCS) that assessed nine variables has been proposed to predict the risk of developing GI complications (Figure 13.5).381
- **5. Overall perspective.** The US nationwide survey found that GI complications were statistically more common following off‐pump than on‐pump CABGs,368 although other studies concluded that the risk was comparable.382,383 The risks were higher in patients undergoing valve repair, perhaps related to longer durations of CPB. Paralytic ileus accounted for more than half of the complications

| Risk Factors                 | Score |

identified, with no other condition occurring in more than 1% of patients. These included, in descending order of occurrence: GI bleeding, pancreatitis, mesenteric ischemia, bowel obstruction, acute cholecystitis, and intestinal perforation. The mortality rate for any of these conditions was quite high, being 37% for mesenteric ischemia, 32% for intestinal perforation, 18% for GI bleeding, 17% for cholecystitis, and 7% for ileus. Many patients had concomitant conditions that increased the mortality rate, including endocarditis, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and COPD. Those who developed GI complications were more prone to develop AKI, AF (which might cause thromboembolic events or require anticoagulation precipitating GI bleeding) or to have sustained a perioperative MI. However, the highest mortalities occurred when the GI complication was associated with shock (31% mortality), a stroke (30%), AKI (21%), or sepsis (20% mortality).

- 6. Smaller individual studies have shown differing occurrence rates and mortality figures, but all confirm that the development of GI complications, although uncommon, portends high morbidity and mortality.<sup>375–381</sup> Therefore, diligent adherence to common principles of perioperative care is important. These include optimizing the patient's preoperative status, performing an expeditious and complete surgical procedure with good myocardial protection, obtaining careful hemostasis to minimize use of blood transfusions, using sufficient inotropic support for a low cardiac output syndrome, optimizing renal function, achieving early extubation to allow for early mobilization, taking steps to prevent infection, and judiciously anticoagulating the patient when indicated after surgery. Prompt identification and aggressive management are necessary to decrease the mortality associated with GI complications.
- **B.** Routine care and common complaints. Most patients have a nasogastric tube inserted in the operating room before heparinization or after its reversal by

protamine. This maintains gastric decompression during positive‐pressure ventilation, removes gastric contents to minimize the risk of aspiration, decreases gastric acidity, and allows for the administration of oral medications and antacids in the ICU. Sucralfate is often given down the nasogastric tube for initial stress ulcer prophylaxis.384–386 The tube is usually removed after extubation if bowel sounds are present. An oral diet is then advanced from clear liquids to a regular diet.

- **1. Anorexia**, nausea, and a distaste for food are fairly common complaints after surgery and may be attributable to the side effects of medications (narcotics), and possibly to mineral deficiency (especially zinc). However, one must not overlook the possibility of an ileus or other intra‐abdominal pathology and should perform a careful physical examination and obtain radiographic studies, if necessary. Bothersome nausea can be treated by a number of medications, which have fairly comparable efficacy.
  - **a.** Metoclopramide (Reglan) 10–20 mg IM qid. This may also stimulate GI motility and decrease the incidence of abdominal distention.
  - **b.** The 5‐HT3 antagonists are powerful antiemetic medications that may be associated with a proarrhythmic effect from QT interval prolongation. The most commonly used medication is ondansetron (Zofran) 4 mg IV.
- **2. Pharyngeal dysfunction** with dysphagia and difficulty swallowing liquids or solids has been noted in 1–3% of patients undergoing CABG and can lead to silent or overt aspiration pneumonia.
  - **a.** Predisposing factors include older age, comorbidities (insulin‐dependent diabetes, COPD, and renal dysfunction), HF, a history of stroke or new perioperative stroke, or perioperative sepsis.387–390
  - **b.** Swallowing dysfunction (dysphagia) and pain with swallowing (odynophagia) are quite common in patients monitored with intraoperative TEE.390–392 Because TEE is routine in most institutions, one must be alert to this problem in the early postoperative period if the patient has impaired pharyngeal sensation or coughs at the time of initial oral intake. One study found that the risk of dysphagia correlated with the time the probe was in the esophagus. By removing the TEE probe after the initial evaluation and then reinserting it just before weaning from CPB, the risk of dysphagia was reduced from 51 to 29%.393 Dysphagia has been noted in up to 50% of patients who remain intubated for more than 48 hours, which results in a delay in resumption of oral feeding and a prolongation of the hospital stay.394 Most hospitals have policies requiring assessment for proper swallowing if the patient is intubated that long.
  - **c.** The occurrence of pharyngeal dysfunction in the absence of common contributing factors (TEE, ventilation) has been ascribed to a new neurologic deficit. Thus, a full neurological evaluation with CT or MRI scanning may be indicated to identify the causative mechanism.
  - **d.** Bedside swallowing tests (usually swallowing 50 mL of water and assessing for a reduction in oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry as well as coughing or choking) can be used as an assessment for aspiration, but they have variable sensitivity in detecting silent aspiration. A modified barium swallow using video fluoroscopy may be indicated before the patient is allowed to eat.395,396

- **e.** The management of the patient with pharyngeal dysphagia may include dietary modification, postural adjustments, and working with speech therapists on swallowing maneuvers. Early evaluation of patients with swallowing difficulties by an ENT specialist may identify problems with laryngeal edema or vocal cord paralysis that can be managed to reduce the risk of pneumonia.397 Persistent dysphagia may require insertion of a feeding tube until satisfactory swallowing can be demonstrated.
- **3. Constipation** is a common problem after surgery. Preoperative enemas are usually not given, narcotics are used for analgesia, and elderly patients are often poorly mobilized for several days. Milk of magnesia, bulk laxatives (Metamucil), or stool softeners (Colace) may be helpful in older patients, and rectal suppositories (bisacodyl [Dulcolax]) or enemas may be useful. The possibility of an ileus or bowel obstruction should always be entertained before being too aggressive with medications promoting bowel motility.

#### **C. Differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain**

**1. Manifestations.** The presence of an acute intra‐abdominal process can be difficult to detect in a critically ill patient in an ICU setting. It is frequently suspected by the presence of fever, an elevation in WBC count, marked tenderness to abdominal palpation, hemodynamic evidence of sepsis, or a positive blood culture. Arriving at the appropriate diagnosis can be even more challenging, but prompt assessment and management are essential because of the high associated mortality.

#### **2. Etiology**

- ∙ Cholecystitis (acalculous or calculous)
- ∙ Perforated viscus (gastric or duodenal ulceration, diverticulitis)398
- ∙ Gastritis
- ∙ Pancreatitis
- ∙ Ischemic bowel (mesenteric ischemia)
- ∙ *C. difficile* colitis
- ∙ Severe paralytic ileus (frequently idiopathic, but occasionally associated with an acute inflammatory process or colitis)
- ∙ Small bowel or colonic obstruction
- ∙ Severe constipation
- ∙ Urinary problems (infection or bladder distention)
- ∙ Retroperitoneal bleeding

#### **3. Evaluation**

- **a.** Review of preexisting conditions or prior abdominal surgery
- **b.** Serial abdominal examinations for tenderness or distention, bowel sounds
- **c.** Laboratory tests: liver function tests (LFTs), lactic acid, serum amylase and lipase, *C. difficile* titer if diarrhea is present
- **d.** Radiographic studies
  - **•** KUB (for obstruction or ileus)
  - **•** Semi‐upright chest x‐ray (for free air under the diaphragm)

- **•** An upper abdominal ultrasound or HIDA scan (if biliary tract obstruction is suspected)
- **•** CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
- **•** Mesenteric arteriography (if mesenteric ischemia is suspected)
- **•** Diagnostic laparoscopy if other tests are unable to provide a diagnosis399
- **4. Treatment.** General surgery consultation should be obtained from the outset because early exploration may reduce the high mortality associated with the development of GI complications. Laparoscopy is very sensitive in evaluating the nature of the problem, but an exploratory laparotomy may be necessary to further assess and potentially treat the problem. Although many patients with these complications are very ill and often septic, they are usually better able to tolerate exploration after cardiac surgery than they had been before.
- **D. Paralytic ileus** occasionally persists for several days after surgery. It is frequently a benign, self‐limited problem of unclear etiology and may be more common in diabetics (who may develop gastroparesis), but occasionally may reflect sepsis or a severe intra‐abdominal pathologic process. Acute colonic pseudo‐obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome) is a condition of massive colonic dilatation believed to result from autonomic imbalance with either decreased parasympathetic tone or enhanced sympathetic tone. It must be differentiated from mechanical obstruction or toxic megacolon, often related to *C. difficile*.

#### **1. Contributing factors**

- **a.** Drugs (catecholamines/cytokine stress response to surgery, opioids, neuromuscular blockade in ventilated patients)
- **b.** Gastric distention (possibly related to vagal injury)
- **c.** Congestion of the hepatic or splanchnic bed (from poor venous drainage during surgery or systemic venous hypertension)
- **d.** Inflammatory processes (e.g. cholecystitis, pancreatitis)
- **e.** Retroperitoneal bleeding (from groin catheterization, but occasionally spontaneously in an anticoagulated patient)
- **f.** *C. difficile* colitis
- **g.** Mesenteric ischemia

#### **2. Evaluation**

- **a.** Serial patient examinations for abdominal distention, bowel sounds, and tenderness consistent with an inflammatory process (ischemia or perforation)
- **b.** Laboratory tests: CBC, amylase, LFTs, *C. difficile* titers if diarrhea
- **c.** KUB: colonic dilatation to 9 cm is significant, but the risk of perforation increases when the cecal diameter exceeds 12 cm.
- **d.** CT scan of the abdomen with contrast

#### **3. Management**

- **a.** Decompression of the bowel is accomplished by keeping the patient NPO with nasogastric suction. This should prevent gastric distention until peristaltic activity returns. A rectal tube may also be beneficial when colonic distention is marked.
- **b.** Total parenteral nutrition should be started.

- **c.** Gum chewing may promote bowel motility.400
- **d.** Medications that can impair colonic motility must be stopped. These include narcotics, CCBs, and anticholinergic drugs. Although metoclopramide is commonly used to improve GI motility, it has not been shown to be effective in preventing or treating postoperative ileus. Peripheral mu‐opioid receptor antagonists (alvimopan and methylnaltrexone) may increase bowel motility in patients treated with narcotics, but they have not been evaluated in the management of ileus after cardiac surgery.401
- **e.** All metabolic disturbances must be corrected and therapy directed at any identifiable precipitating problem.
- **f.** Because "pseudo‐obstruction" may be caused by a deficiency in cholinergic tone, use of cholinesterase inhibitors may be beneficial in producing rapid colonic decompression. Neostigmine 2 mg IV has proven effective in 90% of patients with this condition, but it is not effective in treating a standard postoperative ileus.402 Although the initial response to an intermittent bolus or continuous infusion of neostigmine is comparable, a continuous infusion has been noted to give better resolution of colonic dilatation at 24 hours.403 Side effects include abdominal pain, sialorrhea (excessive salivation), vomiting, and bradycardia. In a patient with recurrent pseudo‐obstruction, pyridostigmine 10 mg bid may be beneficial.404
- **g.** When colonic distention (>12 cm) persists despite conservative or pharmacologic therapy, decompressive colonoscopy is indicated. If dilatation persists or worsens, urgent surgical intervention, usually by cecostomy or hemicolectomy, is indicated.
- **h.** Abdominal compartment syndrome may develop when there is marked colonic dilatation that produces severe intra‐abdominal hypertension (pressure >20 mm Hg). The abdomen is noted to be very tense. This may then produce systemic venous hypertension, impairing splanchnic and renal perfusion, producing hemodynamic and respiratory compromise, and even neurologic symptoms from compression of the inferior vena cava. The release of cytokines, generation of oxygen free radicals, and other factors may lead to bacterial translocation from the gut, interstitial edema, and eventually to multisystem organ failure. If not recognized, it may rapidly lead to progressive metabolic acidosis and death within hours.405

#### **E. Cholecystitis**

**1. Etiology and risk factors.** Cholecystitis is a rare late complication of cardiac surgery with an incidence of 0.1–0.3%. It is noted more commonly in older patients, after surgery requiring prolonged bypass times, and with low cardiac output syndromes requiring inotropes and/or an IABP and continued vasopressor dependence. These risk factors suggest that hypoperfusion is the major mechanism causing cholecystitis, which is more likely to be acalculous than calculous. Other predisposing factors include vascular disease, re‐exploration for bleeding or multiple transfusions, prolonged mechanical ventilation, bacteremia, and nosocomial infections. Fasting, parenteral nutrition, and narcotics can decrease gallbladder contractility and produce biliary stasis. If surgery is required because of an inadequate response to antibiotics, the mortality rate is significant, being 17% in the nationwide survey and 23–43% in three large series.  $^{406-408}$ 

#### 2. Evaluation

- **a.** Serial abdominal examinations may draw attention to an inflammatory process in the right upper quadrant.
- **b.** LFTs (elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase with minimal change in AST and ALT) may suggest extrahepatic biliary obstruction.
- **c.** Right upper quadrant ultrasound or HIDA scan can identify a dilated gallbladder and biliary obstruction.

#### 3. Treatment

- **a.** Antibiotic therapy may suffice in patients with acalculous cholecystitis who have no evidence of peritonitis.
- **b.** If significant clinical improvement does not occur within 24–48 hours, surgical intervention by percutaneous cholecystostomy (especially in critically ill patients) or cholecystectomy (open or laparoscopic) is indicated.

#### F. Upper GI bleeding

1. Etiology. Upper GI bleeding is the second most common GI complication after both on- and off-pump surgery with an incidence of 0.5–1%. It usually results from stress ulceration from duodenal ulcers and less commonly from gastric ulcers and esophagogastritis. 409,410 The causative mechanism is usually decreased blood flow, mucosal ischemia, and a hypoperfusion/reperfusion injury that may be exacerbated by increased gastric acidity. A thorough preoperative history and physical examination (stigmata of liver disease, stool guaiac) may identify patients at increased risk of developing postoperative GI bleeding.

#### 2. Risk factors

- **a.** Preoperative: older age, preexisting gastritis or ulcer disease, cirrhosis/portal hypertension/varices, CKD, smoking
- **b.** Intraoperative: long duration of CPB, valve operations, reoperations, increased lactate level during CPB (suggesting hypoperfusion)
- **c.** Postoperative: low cardiac output requiring vasopressors, prolonged mechanical ventilation, pulmonary infections, coagulopathy or anticoagulation (antiplatelet agents, heparin preparations, warfarin), blood transfusions
- 3. Prophylaxis. Any patient with a history of ulcer disease or gastritis should receive medications in the ICU to prevent stress-related mucosal damage and, potentially, GI bleeding. In addition, any patient on prolonged ventilatory support, with sepsis, or with a coagulopathy, should receive stress ulcer prophylaxis. Although routine prophylaxis may not be necessary in patients at low risk, there is little downside to initiating a short course of stress prophylaxis routinely during the early postoperative period of intubation when the patient may have a marginal cardiac output, visceral hypoperfusion, and some degree of coagulopathy. In the cardiac output, visceral hypoperfusion, and some degree of coagulopathy.
  - a. Sucralfate 1 g q6h can be given orally or down a nasogastric tube. It does not raise the gastric pH, which will increase gastric bacterial colonization, and thus reduces the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia compared with other medications that raise the gastric pH. However, it has not been shown to reduce the incidence of bleeding or mortality in ICU patients.<sup>385</sup>
  - **b.** Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been shown to be much more effective than histamine H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists (H<sub>2</sub> blockers), such as ranitidine, in reducing

the incidence of hemorrhagic gastritis and active ulcer formation, although they may increase the risk of pneumonia more than the H2 blockers.386,413,414 Pantoprazole (Protonix) 40 mg can be given IV or PO, whereas other common preparations, such as omeprazole (Prilosec) 20 mg qd, lansoprazole (Prevacid) 15 mg qd, or rabeprazole (Aciphex) 10 mg qd, can be given orally for prophylaxis. The SUP‐ ICU study found that use of pantoprazole increased mortality compared with placebo.415,416 Ranitidine is usually given as an oral dose of 150–300 mg bid.

- **c.** Patients should be prescribed non‐enteric‐coated aspirin after CABG or valve surgery because of more antiplatelet efficacy. Studies have not shown that enteric coating reduces the occurrence of GI bleeding or ulceration.417
- **d.** Although clopidogrel may cause fewer GI complications than aspirin in patients with no history of ulceration, either aspirin or clopidogrel (or both) can be used with a PPI if there is a history of a healed ulceration.418–421
- **4. Manifestations.** Drainage of bright red blood through a nasogastric tube or vomiting of blood is an overt sign of upper GI bleeding. Slow bleeding usually produces melena, but very rapid bleeding may produce bright red bloody stools. Attention should be drawn to potential GI bleeding in the critically ill or heparinized patient with an unexplained fall in HCT or progressive tachycardia or hypotension. If GI bleeding cannot be documented, a retroperitoneal bleed should be entertained as a possible diagnosis and evaluated by an abdominal CT scan.
- **5. Evaluation and treatment.** Bleeding that persists despite correction of coagulation abnormalities and intensification of a medical regimen requires further evaluation.421–423 Bleeding during anticoagulation is commonly associated with some underlying pathology.
  - **a.** It is essential to stop all antiplatelet medications or anticoagulants when there is evidence of GI bleeding, using reversal agents, if necessary, for persistent bleeding. This may entail vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma or prothrombin complex concentrate for high INRs from warfarin (see Figure 13.2 on page 774), or selective antidotes for the NOACs (idarucizumab for dabigatran, recombinant factor Xa for apixaban or rivaroxaban).
  - **b.** PPIs are superior to the H2 blockers in controlling and preventing recurrent bleeding.421 In the actively bleeding patient, an 80 mg IV bolus of pantoprazole followed by a continuous infusion of 8 mg/h × 72 hours has been recommended, and is able to quickly raise the gastric pH to >6.422,423 Ranitidine may be given as a 50 mg/h continuous infusion.
  - **c.** Upper GI endoscopy should be performed to identify the site of bleeding and can be used therapeutically with laser bipolar coagulation to control hemorrhage. It can achieve hemostasis in >90% of patients. However, in one series, about 30% of patients required surgery after an initial endoscopic procedure.424
  - **d.** Somatostatin 250 μg/h for five days has been shown to be effective in the treatment of severe upper GI bleeding.425
  - **e.** Once bleeding is under control, antiplatelet drugs should be restarted when feasible for patients undergoing CABG or valve surgery. Even in patients with a known history of aspirin‐induced GI bleeding, resumption of aspirin combined with a PPI is superior to using clopidogrel as an alternative antiplatelet drug.420 For patients requiring both aspirin and clopidogrel (usually after receiving drug‐eluting stents), both can be given safely with a PPI after endoscopic control of a bleeding site. If the patient requires anticoagulation indefinitely following surgery (e.g. for a mechanical

- prosthetic valve), a definitive procedure must be performed before resuming anticoagulation. The patient should understand that they are at higher thromboembolic risk while the anticoagulation is being held.
- **6. Results.** The overall mortality rate for patients developing upper GI bleeding after cardiac surgery is about 15%.368,424
- **G. Lower GI bleeding** may be manifest by bright‐red blood per rectum, blood‐streaked stool, or melena, and can usually be differentiated from upper GI bleeding if nasogastric tube drainage is guaiac negative.

#### **1. Etiology**

- **a.** Mesenteric ischemia or ischemic colitis caused by periods of prolonged hypoperfusion
- **b.** Bleeding from colonic lesions (polyps, tumors, diverticular disease) which may be precipitated by anticoagulation
- **c.** Intestinal angiodysplasia. This is termed "Heyde's syndrome" when associated with aortic stenosis and may be associated with acquired von Willebrand's disease (vWD‐IIA). Bleeding usually improves following aortic valve replacement with a tissue valve, but angiodysplasia may persist.426–428
- **d.** Antibiotic‐associated colitis (usually *C. difficile*)
- **2. Evaluation.** Once an upper GI source has been ruled out, sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy can be performed. A bleeding scan may identify the bleeding source. Mesenteric arteriography should be considered if bleeding persists.
- **3. Treatment** involves correction of any coagulopathy and elimination of precipitating causes.
  - **a.** Antibiotics (vancomycin 125 mg PO qid or fidaxomicin 200 mg twice daily) can be used for *C. difficile* colitis.
  - **b.** Mesenteric angiography with infusion of vasopressin (0.2–0.4 units/min) or selective embolization with microcoils, gelatin sponges, and other particles into the mesenteric arterial branches may be considered.429–432
  - **c.** Octreotide (50 μg over 30 minutes) or somatostatin (50 μg bolus followed by an infusion of 250 μg/h) decreases splanchnic blood flow and may be beneficial in patients with GI angiodysplasia.433
  - **d.** Surgical intervention is rarely required for persistent bleeding.
- **H. Mesenteric ischemia** is a rare (0.2–0.4% incidence) but highly lethal complication of cardiac surgery that is usually noted in elderly patients with generalized atherosclerotic disease. It is often associated with dehydration.
  - **1. Etiology.** Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia is the most common etiology, resulting from splanchnic hypoperfusion from a low cardiac output state. This may occur after on‐ or off‐pump surgery, but most commonly after a long pump run.434,435 Atherosclerotic embolism (usually with use of an IABP) or mesenteric thrombosis (possibly from HIT) occurs less commonly.

#### **2. Risk factors**434–438

- **a.** Preoperative: older age, poor LV function, more advanced NYHA class, extensive atherosclerosis, CKD
- **b.** Intraoperative: aortic cross‐clamp time >100 minutes
- **c.** Postoperative: low cardiac output, use of an IABP, inotropic use or use of two or more vasoconstrictor drugs, prolonged mechanical ventilation, AKI, or need for dialysis, blood transfusions, atrial fibrillation

- **3. Presentation.** Typical manifestations are a profound ileus or abdominal pain out of proportion to physical findings. The diagnosis can be very difficult to make in the critically ill patient who is frequently ventilated and heavily sedated. Sepsis with hemodynamic instability, lactic acidosis, respiratory distress, GI bleeding, or diarrhea are often present as well. The diagnosis is typically made about 5–10 days after surgery.
- **4. Diagnosis** may be suggested by the association of the clinical picture just mentioned with leukocytosis, severe lactic acidosis, and an ileus on KUB or evidence of free abdominal fluid. Endoscopy may be helpful in documenting colonic ischemia. Mesenteric CT angiography may show evidence of pneumatosis intestinalis, venous gas, bowel wall thickening, arterial occlusion, or venous thrombosis.439 Standard mesenteric arteriography may identify thromboembolism, but most commonly demonstrates vasoconstriction of the peripheral mesenteric vessels. Unfortunately, the diagnosis is frequently made at surgery when irreversible changes have occurred. Early suspicion of mesenteric ischemia, based on a persistent paralytic ileus, absent bowel movements for several days despite laxatives, and a borderline or elevated lactate level may allow for earlier successful intervention with a vasodilator infusion, such as papaverine.440
- **5. Treatment.** Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to lower the mortality rate of mesenteric ischemia, which was 37% in the US nationwide survey,368 but in most reports exceeds 65%.436–438 If mesenteric vasoconstriction is identified, an infusion of papaverine 0.7 mg/kg/h for up to five days may be helpful, especially at an earlier stage of ischemia.440 When ischemia is prolonged, irreversible intestinal necrosis may occur within hours. Emergency abdominal exploration is indicated if bowel necrosis is suspected. Although a limited bowel resection can be performed, a more likely finding is multiple areas of ischemic bowel that prohibit extensive bowel resection. A second‐look operation is indicated if the viability of the bowel is in doubt. The presence of an abdominal compartment syndrome may lead to rapid deterioration of other organ system function and requires emergency exploration.441
- **I. Diarrhea** developing in a patient in the ICU setting is often an ominous sign because it may result from bowel ischemia caused by a low flow state. However, it is frequently caused by treatable problems including:
  - **1.** Antibiotic usage, which can reduce bowel flora and can lead to diarrhea even in the absence of positive titers for *Clostridium difficile*
  - **2.** *C. difficile* colitis, which has an overall incidence of 0.8% and is usually, but not always, associated with a prolonged duration of antibiotic therapy. The incidence is similar with use of cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. *C. difficile* is more common in patients who are older, female, have CKD, and with postoperative acute hyperglycemia. It is also more common in patients taking PPIs and receiving multiple blood products. For a patient with persistent diarrhea or unexplained abdominal pain and a leukocytosis, this diagnosis should be considered, and stool specimens should be sent for *C. difficile* titers. Oral medication may be started immediately upon suspicion of the diagnosis using vancomycin (125 mg PO four times a day) or fidaxomicin (200 mg twice daily) for 10 days for positive titers.442–444
  - **3.** GI bleeding
  - **4.** Intolerance of hyperosmolar tube feedings: dilute with more water and start at a slower infusion rate.

**J. Hepatic dysfunction** manifested by a transient low‐grade elevation in LFTs, including ALT, AST, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase, is not uncommon after open‐heart surgery. About 25% of patients will develop transient hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin >3 mg/dL), with a higher incidence noted in patients undergoing valve repair or replacement.445–447 However, less than 1% of patients will have evidence of significant hepatocellular damage that may progress to chronic hepatitis or liver failure. The elevated bilirubin may be multifactorial, with increased bilirubin production from hemolysis as well as impaired liver function, contributing to both unconjugated and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

#### **1. Predisposing conditions**

- **a.** Preexisting liver disease. This may be manifest by elevated LFTs, but occasionally will be associated with normal values. However, impaired synthetic function (low serum albumin, high INR) is a marker for hepatic disease. An elevated bilirubin in patients with HF is one of the strongest predictors of the occurrence of postoperative hepatic dysfunction.448
- **b.** Cardiac conditions:
  - **i.** Right‐sided HF produces a high right atrial pressure causing passive hepatic congestion
  - **ii.** Preoperative cardiogenic shock (acute MI, papillary muscle rupture, valve thrombosis) may produce elevated LFTs consistent with a "shock liver" before surgery, predisposing the patient to the development of hepatic and multisystem organ failure after salvage open‐heart surgery.
  - **iii.** Endocarditis with evidence of sepsis may cause hepatic dysfunction.
- **c.** Operative factors: prolonged duration of CPB, complex operations (combined CABG–valve, multiple valves), greater number of blood transfusions
- **d.** Postoperative factors: low cardiac output syndrome, use of multiple inotropes or an IABP, sepsis, blood transfusions
- **e.** Medications, including statins, acetaminophen, and clopidogrel.449
- **2. Pathophysiology.** Hepatic dysfunction may result from either reduced hepatic perfusion or systemic congestion.
  - **a.** Hepatocellular necrosis
    - **•** Low cardiac output states usually requiring inotropic and/or vasopressor support
    - **•** Right‐heart failure or severe tricuspid regurgitation (chronic passive congestion)
    - **•** Sepsis injures the liver due to inflammatory mediators and other toxins; hepatic dysfunction due to sepsis is a major risk factor for multisystem organ failure and death.450
    - **•** Posttransfusion hepatitis C or cytomegalovirus infection (late)
  - **b.** Hyperbilirubinemia
    - **•** Hemolysis (paravalvular leak, long pump run, sepsis, multiple transfusions, drugs)
    - **•** Intrahepatic cholestasis (hepatitis, hepatocellular necrosis, benign postoperative cholestasis, parenteral nutrition, bacterial infections, medications)
    - **•** Extrahepatic obstruction (biliary tract obstruction)

- **3. Manifestations** depend on the specific diagnosis. Jaundice is a common accompaniment of hepatocellular damage or cholestasis. Severe liver failure may result in hypotension, coagulopathy, refractory lactic acidosis, hypoglycemia, renal failure, or encephalopathy from hyperammonemia, and sepsis.
- **4. Evaluation.** The specific LFT abnormalities usually indicate the nature of the problem. Additional tests may include those that detect hemolysis (LDH, low serum haptoglobin, schistocytes on peripheral blood smear), assess cardiac and valvular function (echocardiography), identify biliary pathology (right upper quadrant ultrasound or HIDA scan), or detect hepatitis (serologies).

#### **5. Treatment**

- **a.** An elevated bilirubin is usually a benign and self‐limited postoperative occurrence. Bilirubin levels will gradually return to normal when hemodynamics improve unless there is evidence of severe underlying liver pathology. In this situation, progressive and irreversible hepatic dysfunction may result, leading to multisystem organ failure and death.
- **b.** Coagulopathy with "autoanticoagulation" may occur during a period of hepatic dysfunction because of the impaired capacity of the liver to produce clotting factors. In patients requiring anticoagulation, small doses of warfarin should be used to prevent the INR from becoming elevated to dangerous levels. If this occurs, the patient may develop cardiac tamponade or GI bleeding. In addition, the doses of medications that undergo hepatic metabolism must be altered.
- **c.** Stress ulcer prophylaxis should be given using one of the PPIs (pantoprazole 40 mg IV/PO qd).
- **d.** Due to high caloric expenditure and protein catabolism, give 1–1.5 g/kg/day of enteral protein.
- **e.** Hyperammonemia may cause an encephalopathy, and at levels >150–200 μmol/L may cause intracranial hypertension and cerebral edema.451,452 This can be treated by:
  - **i.** Control of fever and use of hypothermia protocols
  - **ii.** Intubation and induced hypocarbia
  - **iii.** For intracranial hypertension:
    - **•** Hypertonic saline solutions (20 mL of 30% NaCl or 200 mL of 3% NaCl) keeping the serum sodium <150 mEq/L
    - **•** Mannitol (2 mL/kg of 20% mannitol)
  - **iv.** Medications such as lactulose 30 mL qid with sorbitol and oral neomycin 6 g daily. These may have a role in chronic liver disease but their benefits in acute liver failure are not clear.
    - **v.** Hemodialysis (rarely)
- **f.** Blood glucose should be carefully monitored to prevent hypoglycemia.
- **g.** Lactic acidosis may result from impaired lactate metabolism rather than lactate generation from impaired tissue perfusion. Partial correction with sodium bicarbonate should be considered if the base deficit exceeds 10. Thiamine deficiency causing lactic acidosis should be considered and is easily correctable.
- **K. Hyperamylasemia** is noted in a substantial number (35–65%) of patients in the early postbypass period, but is associated with clinical pancreatitis in only about 1–3% of patients. Isolated hyperamylasemia in the early postoperative period is usually not associated with clinical symptoms or an elevated lipase level, and most commonly

arises from a nonpancreatic source, such as the salivary glands, or results from decreased renal excretion. Transient hyperamylasemia has a comparable incidence after on‐ or off‐pump surgery, so it is not directly related to use of CPB.453 However, some patients with an amylase level >1000 units/L early after surgery may subsequently develop subclinical pancreatitis about one week later with mild symptoms (anorexia, nausea, ileus) and elevation of serum lipase levels. Late elevations in amylase levels tends to be pancreatic in origin. A brief period of bowel rest may be beneficial for these patients, but no specific treatment is indicated unless there is clinical evidence of overt pancreatitis or GI tract dysfunction.454

- **L. Overt pancreatitis** is noted in less than 0.5% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, but is a serious problem associated with a significant mortality rate. Pancreatic necrosis has been noted in 25% of patients dying from multisystem organ failure after cardiac surgery.455
  - **1. Etiology.** Pancreatitis usually represents an ischemic, necrotic injury resulting from a low cardiac output state and hypoperfusion. A prolonged duration of CPB may sensitize the pancreas to the subsequent insult of a persistent low output state requiring vasopressors that leads to necrotizing pancreatitis. Additional risks factors include a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, CKD, and a requirement for norepinephrine support.456,457
  - **2. Presentation** is atypical and relatively nonspecific. Fever, elevated WBC, paralytic ileus, and abdominal distention occur first, with abdominal pain, tenderness, and hemodynamic instability representing late manifestations.
  - **3. Diagnosis** is suggested by the association of abdominal pain with elevated lipase levels. An abdominal ultrasound or CT scan may demonstrate a pancreatic phlegmon or abscess.
  - **4. Treatment** should begin with nasogastric drainage and antibiotics. Exploratory laparotomy with debridement and drainage is usually performed as a desperation measure, but it may be the only hope for survival in patients with aggressive necrotizing pancreatitis.

#### **XI. Nutrition**

- **A.** Reversal of the catabolic state with adequate nutrition is important during the early phase of postoperative convalescence since malnutrition increases postoperative morbidity and mortality.458–461 The diet must provide enough calories to allow wounds to heal and to maintain immune competence. Although limitations in salt content, fluids, and cholesterol intake are important, overly strict restrictions should be secondary to providing tasty, high‐caloric foods that stimulate the patient's appetite. Too frequently, the combination of anorexia, nausea, and an unpalatable diet prevents the patient from achieving satisfactory nutrition. In non‐intubated patients who cannot meet their energy needs with an oral diet, oral supplements with low residue, such as Boost (Nestlé Health Science) or Ensure (Abbott Nutrition), are useful in meeting caloric requirements.
- **B. Enteral nutrition.** Patients requiring ventilatory support, those with swallowing difficulties after extubation, and many patients suffering strokes are unable to take oral feedings, but usually have a functional GI tract. If the patient cannot eat within 48 hours of surgery, enteral feeding should be initiated at a consistent hourly rate, not as

a bolus feed, and should be increased to goal within 3–7 days. Most patients requiring a tracheostomy after 1–2 weeks of mechanical ventilatory support will benefit from a feeding tube. If there is no evidence of gastroesophageal reflux, a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding tube can be placed for long‐term feeding. If reflux is present, a feeding jejunostomy may be considered at the time of the tracheostomy.

- **1.** General contraindications to enteral feeding include uncontrolled shock, uncontrolled hypoxemia/hypercarbia/acidosis, active upper GI bleeding, bowel ischemia or obstruction, or abdominal compartment syndrome. Enteral feedings can often be started even with absent bowel sounds, unless bowel ischemia or obstruction is suspected. Evidence of distention or high gastric residuals (>500 mL/6h) may indicate temporary intolerance to tube feedings. Despite a reluctance to initiate enteral feeding in hemodynamically unstable patients, especially those on vasopressors, it may be safe to do so as long as the patient has adequate intravascular volume.462,463 Early enteral nutrition can be used for patients on ECMO, with pancreatitis, and those given neuromuscular blocking drugs to aid with ventilation.
- **2.** A soft nasogastric feeding tube should be placed and tube feedings initiated after confirming the position of the catheter in the stomach. Postpyloric placement may lower the risk of aspiration, but is more difficult to accomplish. This is recommended if there is intolerance to gastric feeding due to gastroparesis or there is a high risk of aspiration. Factors increasing that risk generally include older age, use of mechanical ventilation, altered mental status, neurologic deficits, and gastroesophageal reflux. A three‐day course of prokinetic drugs, including erythromycin 200 mg IV in 50 mL NS through a central line or in 200 mL NS peripherally three times a day with or without metoclopramide 10 mg IV q12h, will stimulate gastric motility and increase tolerance to tube feedings.
- **C. Parenteral nutrition.** If the GI tract cannot be used, parenteral nutrition provided through a central line may be necessary. Because of the increased risk of infection compared with use of enteral nutrition, it has been recommended that parenteral feedings should be delayed for at least 3–7 days if the patient cannot tolerate any enteral feedings.459 In addition, if the caloric intake is <60% of the desired level after several days of enteral feedings, adding parenteral nutrition should be considered. Parenteral feedings may be supplemented with a lipid emulsion providing 0.1– 0.2 mg/kg of fish oil enriched with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) that are immunomodulatory and anti‐inflammatory.459,461
- **D.** Measures to reduce the risk of aspiration in patients on enteral feedings include the following:458
  - **1.** Elevate the head of the bed 30–45°.
  - **2.** Use chlorhexidine mouthwash twice a day to reduce the risk of pneumonia.
  - **3.** Use metoclopramide to promote GI motility.
  - **4.** Check the gastric residual volume; if it exceeds 500 mL, the tube feeds should be held for 2–4 hours and then restarted as a continuous infusion at a lower rate.
  - **5.** Advance the feeding tube into the small bowel if necessary.
- **E.** Initial enteral feedings should be hypocaloric relative to the patient's energy expenditure and should be increased to a full level by 3–7 days. Thus, one should initiate

feeding to provide 8–10 kcal/kg/day and gradually increase feeding to provide a total caloric intake of 25 kcal/kg/day (ideal body weight) within one week. In markedly obese patients, the dosing weight is the ideal body weight (IBW) + 0.4 × (actual body weight − IBW). General nutritional requirements for adult patients include 2–5 g/kg/day of glucose, 1.3 g/kg/day of protein, and 1.2–1.5 g/kg/day of fat provided as an omega‐3 enriched formula. A critically ill patient with multisystem organ failure may require 10–20% more calories with a protein requirement of 2–2.5 g/kg/day. A commonly used tube feeding such as Jevity 1.2 (Abbott Nutrition) will provide 1.2 kcal/mL. Thus, for a 70 kg man, 1500 mL/day will provide 1800 calories or 25 kcal/kg/day.

- **F.** Specific considerations in critically ill patients include the following:
  - **1.** Blood glucose levels should be monitored several times a day during the initial phase of enteral nutrition. Hyperglycemia must be prevented by use of intravenous insulin infusions.
  - **2.** Serum electrolytes, including potassium, magnesium, and phosphate, should be measured daily for the first week, especially looking for "refeeding hypophosphatemia", which may occur when enteral feedings are initiated in a malnourished patient.464 This is replaced with 0.3–0.6 mmol/kg/day of phosphate.
  - **3.** Soluble fiber and fibro‐oligosaccharides (FOS) should be included in enteral feedings to optimize bowel function and are indicated if the patient develops diarrhea. These are included in standard tube feeds such as Jevity.
  - **4.** Antioxidant vitamins and trace minerals, including vitamin C and selenium, should be provided to critically ill patients receiving parenteral nutrition. Many studies have shown that vitamin C (and fish oils) reduce the incidence of postoperative AF.
  - **5.** Patients with hypercarbic respiratory failure might benefit from a feeding that is high‐lipid and low‐carbohydrate, but this is rarely necessary. If fluid restriction is indicated, a calorie‐dense formulation, such as Isosource 1.5 (Nestlé Health Science) or Jevity 1.5, which both provide 1.5 kcal/mL, can be used. In patients with severe acute lung injury, an anti‐inflammatory formula containing omega‐3 fish oils and antioxidants, such as Impact (Nestlé Health Science) or Oxepa (Abbott Nutrition), may be beneficial.
  - **6.** Protein intake should be optimized to promote nitrogen retention while avoiding protein overload. Most patients with AKI can receive standard enteral feedings. Protein intake should be increased to 2.5 g/kg/day for patients on dialysis, which removes about 3–5 g/h of protein. Formulations such as Novasource Renal (Nestlé Health Science) or Nepro (Abbott Nutrition) provide high‐protein, low‐ carbohydrate, and low‐potassium loads.
  - **7.** Monitoring of visceral protein levels (transferrin and prealbumin) may indicate the adequacy of nutrition, but levels have not been shown to correlate with improved outcomes.

#### **XII. Valve‐associated Problems**

All patients receiving a prosthetic valve require careful follow‐up because of the risk of developing valve‐related complications, including thromboembolism, endocarditis, anticoagulant‐ related hemorrhage, and valve degeneration.465 It has been aptly stated that when a prosthetic valve is placed, "the patient is exchanging one disease process for another".466

- **A. Thromboembolism.** The annual risk of thromboembolism averages 1–2% for aortic valves and 2–4% for mitral valves, with a slightly higher incidence in patients with mechanical valves taking warfarin than in those with bioprosthetic valves taking only aspirin. The recommended regimens for tissue and mechanical valves are summarized in Table 13.5 on page 770.
- **B. Valve thrombosis** of a mechanical valve may occur despite therapeutic anticoagulation. It is very rare with a bioprosthetic valve, although echocardiographic findings often raise the specter of "subclinical leaflet thrombosis" on both TAVR and surgically implanted tissue valves in patients not taking warfarin, which may increase the risk of stroke.120,467–471 Suspicion of mechanical valve thrombosis is raised by loss of valve clicks on auscultation and confirmed by fluoroscopy (see Figure 2.10, page 139) or echocardiography. Although thrombolytic therapy can be used in selected circumstances, an immediate operation to replace the valve is usually required.472
- **C. Pregnancy** poses a serious problem for the woman with a prosthetic valve. The incidence of fetal loss is 60% if warfarin is used during the first trimester, and there is a significant incidence of other congenital defects if pregnancy is completed ("coumadin embryopathy"). Tissue valves have been used for women of childbearing age, acknowledging the limited durability of valves in this age group. Cryopreserved homograft valves or a pulmonary autograft (Ross procedure) can be considered for young women undergoing aortic valve replacement. One anticoagulation regimen recommended by both the ACC/AHA and the ESC for women with mechanical valves who become pregnant is as follows:473
  - **1.** First trimester (up through 13th week): use warfarin if dose <5 mg/day, or use dose‐adjusted LMWH or IV UFH. Doses are usually UFH 10,000 units SC bid to achieve a PTT of twice control or LMWH SC bid (to maintain a four‐hour postinjection anti‐Xa heparin level >0.5 units/mL).
  - **2.** Second and third trimesters: warfarin +/− aspirin
  - **3.** Peripartum (or last half of third trimester): dose‐adjusted UFH or LMWH (often up to 20,000 units SC q12h) until delivery
  - **4.** Resume warfarin after delivery.
- **D. Anticoagulant**‐**related hemorrhage** is a major source of morbidity in patients receiving warfarin, especially in patients over the age of 65. In fact, it has been estimated that more than 20% of patients will experience major or minor bleeding episodes. Patient response to warfarin after surgery is quite variable, and may be related to genetic factors. The use of medications that influence INR levels (most commonly amiodarone and antibiotics) must be taken into consideration when dosing warfarin. It is helpful to use an anticoagulation protocol to initiate warfarin therapy (see Table 13.6 and Appendix 8). **It is absolutely critical that careful follow**‐**up be arranged for any patient discharged on warfarin** to avoid under‐ or overanticoagulation. Home self‐testing systems make it easier for patients to check their INRs and have been noted to minimize the fluctuation in the INR levels, resulting in less thromboembolism and improved survival.474 In patients whose INRs are hard to regulate, concomitant administration of vitamin K 100–200 μg/day orally helps stabilize the INR.129,130
- **E. Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE)** may develop at any time during the lifespan of a prosthetic valve with an annual risk of approximately 1–2%, which appears to be

comparable with surgically implanted and transcatheter valves.475,476 Early endocarditis (within 60 days of surgery) most commonly results from infection with staphylococci (coagulase‐negative more often than *S. aureus*), fungi, Gram‐negative organisms, and enterococci. This carries a significantly higher mortality than late PVE, which is most commonly caused by coagulase‐negative staphylococci and *Streptococcus viridans*. Clinical manifestations may include recurrent fevers, valve dysfunction with regurgitation and heart failure, cerebral or peripheral embolization, and, most ominously, the development of conduction defects resulting from a periannular abscess. The indications for surgery are noted in Chapter 1 (pages 61–62). It is critical that the patient understands the need for prophylactic antibiotics when any dental procedure is performed. The ACC/AHA recommendations detailed in Table 13.5 should be followed.215

- **F. Hemolysis** usually indicates the development of a paravalvular leak and is often worse when the leak is smaller due to increased turbulence. It may also result from transvalvular leaks resulting from pannus ingrowth or thrombus formation on a mechanical valve that restricts leaflet movement and may keep one or both leaflets in a partially open fixed position. Subclinical hemolysis is manifest by elevation in the LDH and reticulocyte count with a low haptoglobin level. The patient may also develop mild jaundice or persistent anemia, necessitating transfusion. Valve re‐ replacement is indicated for severe hemolysis or a significant paravalvular leak.477
- **G. Valve failure** is defined as a complication necessitating valve replacement.465 Mechanical valve failure is usually caused by thrombosis, thromboembolism, endocarditis, or anticoagulation‐related bleeding, and rarely by structural failure. In contrast, primary tissue failure is the most common cause of bioprosthetic valve dysfunction necessitating valve replacement. This occurs more readily in mitral valves, which are subject to more leaflet stress than aortic valves. Current‐generation tissue valves (porcine or pericardial) generally have some form of anticalcification treatment to potentially extend their lifespan. Nonetheless, early and late failures can occur, so constant vigilance and follow‐up echocardiograms are essential. Bioprosthetic valve failure usually occurs gradually, and valve replacement surgery can thus be performed on an elective basis either surgically or with a transcatheter valve‐in‐valve approach in both aortic and mitral positions. In contrast, high‐risk emergency surgery is usually required for catastrophic mechanical valve failure.

#### **XIII. Discharge Planning**

- **A.** As the hospital length of stay continues to decrease, appropriate discharge planning is essential to ensure a smooth convalescence after hospital discharge. Patients requiring additional subacute care may be transferred to rehabilitation hospitals or skilled nursing facilities for several days before going home. Even when patients are well enough to be cared for at home, it is not uncommon for separation anxiety to develop, with both patients and family members experiencing difficulty handling minor problems.
- **B.** Appropriate discharge planning should involve the patient, family members, case managers, dietitians, nurses, mid-level providers, and physicians. Patients must be given explicit instructions as to how they will feel, how fast they should anticipate recovery, what they must not do, what they should look for, and when to contact the surgeon's office or the hospital. Several manuals are available that discuss

expectations and the reestablishment of standard routines at home (see www.sts. org and click on the "patients" link for a booklet on "What to Expect After Heart Surgery). Phone contact from the doctor's office is very beneficial in allaying patients' fears, answering routine questions, and dealing appropriately with potential problems. Since the definition of "operative mortality" extends out to 30 days after surgery, it is imperative that patients be contacted at that time to see whether they have been readmitted and to see how they are faring. This should be done in order to perform appropriate outcomes analysis and submit accurate data to the STS database.

- **C.** Most patients should have an available family member or friend at home for the first week after discharge. This provides reassurance for patients who may not yet be able to care for themselves, and it also provides an objective observer who is able to contact the hospital if serious problems arise.
- **D. Medications.**52,478 The patient should be provided with a list and schedule of all medications. The reason each medication has been prescribed as well as possible side effects and interactions with other medications should be discussed. If the patient is receiving an anticoagulant such as **warfarin**, it is **absolutely imperative that follow‐up be arranged** for prothrombin times (INR) and regulation of drug dosage. The adverse influence of alcohol, other medications, and certain foods on the level of anticoagulation must be emphasized (Appendix 11). The most commonly used medications at the time of discharge include the following:
  - **1. Aspirin** should be given to all CABG patients, not only to improve graft patency but also for the secondary prevention of coronary events. Aspirin has been shown to reduce long‐term mortality after CABG. It may be used alone for aortic bioprosthetic valves or combined with warfarin for patients receiving mechanical or bioprosthetic mitral valves.
  - **2. P2Y12 inhibitors** (clopidogrel, ticagrelor, and prasugrel) are given to patients with recently placed drug‐eluting stents and after TAVR or MitraClip procedures. They should be considered along with aspirin in patients undergoing CABG for acute coronary syndromes or after OPCABs.
    - **a.** Drugs that reduce clopidogrel's antiplatelet activity include omeprazole (but not pantoprazole), morphine, and amlodipine (which should not be given with ticagrelor), as well as grapefruit juice.
    - **b.** Drugs that enhance clopidogrel's antiplatelet activity include aspirin and ACE inhibitors.
  - **3. Warfarin** is prescribed for patients with AF, mechanical valves, and for some patients receiving tissue valves (see Table 13.3). NOACs may be used for AF or with use of tissue valves after three months, but are contraindicated in patients with mechanical valves.
  - **4. Statins** are indicated for all patients with coronary artery disease because of their lipid‐lowering and pleiotropic effects. Statins can stabilize plaque, potentially promote plaque regression, and mitigate the progression of saphenous vein graft disease. They have been shown to improve the short‐ and long‐term results of CABG and even valve surgery. All patients taking statins should have their LFTs checked at baseline and at six‐month intervals. High‐ intensity statins (atorvastatin 40–80 mg or rosuvastatin 20–40 mg) are recommended after CABG in patients <age 75, with moderate‐intensity dosing

- recommended in older patients. Potential drug–drug interactions may influence whether medications should not be prescribed or whether doses should be modified.
- **a.** Simvastatin has significant interactions with amiodarone, amlodipine, diltiazem and ticagrelor. No more than 10 mg of simvastatin should be given to patients on verapamil or diltiazem and no more than 20 mg of simvastatin should be given to patients on amiodarone or amlodipine.
- **b.** Atorvastatin has significant interactions with digoxin, diltiazem, and verapamil. No more than 40 mg of atorvastatin should be given to patients on diltiazem.
- **5. β**‐**blockers** are generally prescribed following CABG as prophylaxis against AF in the perioperative period, but they have also provided survival benefits in postinfarction patients treated medically or undergoing CABG, and in other patients with reduced EF or HF. There is some evidence that they may also improve long‐term survival in patients without a history of MI or HF.479 Carvedilol is often used in patients with impaired LV function. Otherwise, metoprolol is the most commonly prescribed β‐blocker and is beneficial for control of hypertension as well.
- **6. Amiodarone** may be given as prophylaxis for AF, although the optimal duration of therapy is not defined. It can usually be stopped after a couple of weeks if the patient remains in sinus rhythm. It is recommended for several months following a Maze procedure. Amiodarone can affect hepatic, thyroid, and pulmonary function, so any patient in whom therapy is anticipated beyond one month should have LFTs, thyroid function tests, and pulmonary function tests obtained at baseline. There are nearly 600 drugs which interact with amiodarone noted on the www.drugs.com website. Particular concerns in cardiac surgery patients are that amiodarone:
  - **a.** Decreases the metabolism of warfarin, necessitating a 25–50% reduction in warfarin dosing
  - **b.** May rarely reduce platelet inhibition by clopidogrel
  - **c.** Increases QT prolongation when used concurrently with fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin), 5‐HT3 antagonists (ondansetron), or haloperidol. These medications are generally contraindicated if amiodarone is being used.
  - **d.** Enhances bradycardia when given with β‐blockers or CCBs
- **7. ACE inhibitors** (or ARBs if ACE inhibitor intolerant) are recommended as the preferred antihypertensive drug after surgery, and are indicated in all patients with a reduced EF <40%, a history of infarction, diabetes, or CKD. Although short‐term mortality benefits have not been demonstrated, ACE inhibitors may provide long‐term mortality benefits.
- **E. Prophylactic antibiotics.** Any patient who has received prosthetic material (valves or grafts) must be aware of the necessity of taking prophylactic antibiotics if dental work is contemplated. Patients should be told to inform their physician or dentist accordingly and follow the ACC/AHA guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis delineated in Table 13.5.215
- **F. Diabetes mellitus** is associated with greater morbidity and mortality after CABG surgery, and poor diabetic control postoperatively may compromise graft patency and contribute to more rapid progression of native vessel disease. Diet and medications should be optimized to achieve a HbA1c <7%.

- **G. Diet.** Dieticians should meet with patients before discharge to discuss the particular dietary restrictions for their cardiac disease. This entails discussions of the significance of low‐cholesterol or low‐salt diets and the provision of appropriate dietary plans.
- **H.** The patient must participate in self‐evaluation at home. A daily assessment of pulse rate, oral temperature, and weight should be performed, and all incisions should be inspected for redness, tenderness, or drainage. Visiting nurses are usually recommended for patients discharged home to help with these assessments. Patients should be instructed to contact their physician's office if any abnormalities are noted.
- **I.** Patients should be encouraged to gradually increase their activity as tolerated. Patients with a median sternotomy incision should be discouraged from lifting objects weighing more than 10–15 pounds, because it puts strain on the healing sternum. Driving should be avoided for six weeks. In contrast, there are few physical limitations for patients who have small thoracotomy incisions for minimally invasive surgery or who have undergone TAVR or MitraClip procedures.
- **J.** Lifestyle modification and control of all modifiable risk factors are essential to optimize the long‐term results of surgery. These include weight loss, cessation of smoking (with nicotine patches and pharmacologic agents initially), and control of dyslipidemias, diabetes, and hypertension. Postoperative depression is not uncommon and should be identified and treated because it is associated with worse outcomes. Involvement in a cardiac rehabilitation program is an important aspect of long‐term care following surgery.

# **1B** New York Heart Association Functional Classification

**Class I** Patient has cardiac disease but without resulting limitations of ordinary physical activity. Ordinary physical activity (e.g. walking several blocks or climbing stairs) does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain. Limiting symptoms may occur with marked exertion.

- **Class II** Patient has cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of ordinary physical activity. Patient is comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity such as walking more than two blocks or climbing more than one flight of stairs results in limiting symptoms (e.g. fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain).
- **Class III** Patient has cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. Patient is comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary physical activity (e.g. walking one to two level blocks or climbing one flight of stairs) causes fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain.
- **Class IV** Patient has dyspnea at rest that increases with any physical activity. Patient has cardiac disease resulting in inability to perform any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms may be present even at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased.

# **1C** The Canadian Cardiovascular Society Classification for Grading of Angina

- **Class I** Ordinary activity does not cause angina. Angina with strenuous, rapid, or prolonged exertion only.
- **Class II** Slight limitation of ordinary activity. Angina on walking or climbing stairs rapidly, walking or stair climbing after meals, in cold weather, when under emotional stress, during the first few hours of awakening or walking more than two blocks on the level or climbing more than one flight of ordinary stairs at a normal pace under normal conditions.
- **Class III** Marked limitation of ordinary physical activity. Angina on walking one or two blocks on the level or one flight of stairs at a normal pace under normal conditions.
- **Class IV** Inability to carry out any physical activity without discomfort or angina at rest.

## **1D** Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) Profiles of Advanced Heart Failure

Patients with NYHA class IV and AHA stage D heart failure may be classified as INTERMACS profiles 1–6 indicating the severity of their clinical heart failure. Patients with INTERMACS 7 are those with advanced NYHA class III heart failure.

- **INTERMACS 1: Critical cardiogenic shock** with life‐threatening hypotension refractory to rapidly escalating inotropic pressor support, with critical organ hypoperfusion. *"Crash and burn."* Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is indicated within hours.
- **INTERMACS 2: Progressive decline** with acceptable blood pressure on inotropic support, but worsening renal function, nutritional status, or end‐organ function. *"Sliding fast."* MCS is indicated within a few days.
- **INTERMACS 3: Stable but inotrope‐dependent** with stable blood pressure and end‐organ function, but cannot be weaned from inotropic support without developing hypotension, HF symptoms, or worsening organ system function (usually renal). *"Dependent stability."* MCS may be considered within a few weeks to months.
- **INTERMACS 4: Resting symptoms** at home on oral medications with daily symptoms of HF at rest or with activities of daily living (ADLs). Temporary cessation of inotropic support may be possible, but patient has frequent symptoms of fluid overload requiring very high dose diuretics. Signs and symptoms include orthopnea, dyspnea with ADLs, and lower extremity edema. *"Frequent flyer."* MCS may be indicated within a few months.
- **INTERMACS 5: Exertion intolerant** being comfortable at rest without symptoms of HF, but unable to engage in any other activities; usually have underlying refractory elevated volume status, often with renal dysfunction. *"Housebound."*
- **INTERMACS 6: Exertion limited** patients are comfortable at rest without evidence of fluid overload, and able to do ADLs and minor activities outside of the home. *"Walking wounded."* However, any meaningful physical activity causes fatigue. Symptoms will occasionally worsen, with most patients hospitalized within the past year.
- **INTERMACS 7: Advanced NYHA Class 3** patients are clinically stable, being comfortable with a reasonable level of mild activity, such as walking a block.

#### **Transition to Subcutaneous Insulin**

- □ units Insulin glargine (Lantus) SC daily
- □ units Insulin aspart (Novolog) SC tid with first dose 30 minutes prior to stopping insulin infusion
- **1.** Take the average hourly requirement for insulin (in units/h) for the past 4 hours and multiply by 24 for the total daily dose of insulin (e.g. 1 unit/h × 24 = 24 units/day)
- **2.** Give 80% of that dose for total daily dose of SC insulin (e.g. 24 units becomes 20 units/day), giving half as insulin glargine (basal) and half as insulin aspart (very fast acting) divided into 3 daily doses. Subsequent requirements may be adjusted based upon response to these initial doses.
- **3.** In this example, for 20 units/day, the patient would receive 10 units of Lantus and approximately 4 units of Novolog tid.

Medications metabolized by the liver do not require reduction in dosage for renal failure; medications metabolized by the kidneys must be adjusted according to the serum creatinine, or more precisely by the glomerular filtration rate. The reader should refer to the *Physician's Desk Reference* or online (PDR.net) or other online drug websites, such as Rxlist.com, for complete prescribing information.

Antianginal medications given four times a day (qid) are usually taken four hours apart during the daytime. Other medications should generally be taken at equally spaced intervals.

Medications metabolized by the liver do not require reduction in dosage for renal failure; medications metabolized by the kidneys must be adjusted according to the serum creatinine, or more precisely, by the glomerular filtration rate. The reader should refer to the *Physician's Desk Reference* or online (PDR.net) or other online drug websites, such as Rxlist.com, for complete prescribing information.

# 14 Definitions from the STS Data Specifications (Version 4.20 2020)

#### **Preoperative Conditions**

#### 1. Chronic lung disease

- a. Mild: FEV, 60-75% of predicted, and/or on chronic inhaled or oral bronchodilator therapy
- b. Moderate: FEV, 50-59% of predicted, and/or on chronic oral/systemic steroid therapy aimed at lung disease
- c. Severe:  $FEV_1 < 50\%$  and/or room air  $pO_2 < 60$  or  $pCO_2 > 50$
- 2. Peripheral arterial disease (excludes carotid, cerebrovascular disease, or thoracic aorta)
  - a. Claudication, either with exertion or at rest
  - **b.** Amputation for arterial vascular insufficiency
  - c. Vascular reconstruction, bypass surgery, or percutaneous intervention to the extremities (excluding dialysis fistulas and vein stripping)
  - d. Documented abdominal aortic aneurysm with or without repair

#### **4. Diabetes mellitus**

- **a.** Hemoglobin A1c ≥6.5%; or
- **b.** A history of diabetes diagnosed and/or treated by a healthcare provider
- **c.** Definitions in prior specifications included:
  - **i.** Fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L); or
  - **ii.** Two‐hour plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during an oral glucose tolerance test; or
  - **iii.** In a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis, a random plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L)
- **5. Renal failure** on dialysis is the only criterion listed on version 4.20 STS entry forms. The serum creatinine is a data entry, and the stage of chronic kidney disease noted below is helpful in assessing the risk of acute kidney injury or the risk of dialysis. GFR is measured in mL/min/1.73 m2 .
  - **a.** Stage 1 GFR >90
  - **b.** Stage 2 GFR 60–89
  - **c.** Stage 3a GFR 45–59
  - **d.** Stage 3b GFR 30–44
  - **e.** Stage 4 GFR 15–30
  - **f.** Stage 5 GFR <15

#### **6. Hypertension**

- **a.** A history of hypertension diagnosed and treated with medication, diet, and/or exercise
- **b.** Currently undergoing pharmacological therapy for treatment of hypertension
- **c.** Definitions in prior specifications included prior documentation of blood pressure >140 mm Hg systolic and/or >90 mm Hg diastolic for patients without diabetes or chronic kidney disease, or prior documentation of blood pressure >130 mm Hg systolic or >80 mm Hg diastolic on at least two occasions for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease (see *J Am Coll Cardiol* 2017;71:e127–248).
- **7. Heart failure (HF):** unusual dyspnea on light exertion, recurrent dyspnea occurring in the supine position, fluid retention; or the description of rales, jugular venous distension, pulmonary edema on physical exam, or pulmonary edema on chest x‐ray presumed to be cardiac dysfunction. A low ejection fraction alone, without clinical evidence of heart failure, does not qualify as heart failure. An elevated BNP without other supporting documentation should not be coded as HF.
  - **a.** Acute HF: rapid onset of symptoms and signs of HF that may occur with or without previous cardiac disease occurring within 2 weeks of surgery. Acute decompensated HF is a sudden worsening of the signs and symptoms of HF, which typically include difficulty breathing (dyspnea), leg or feet swelling, and fatigue.
  - **b.** Chronic HF develops gradually over time with symptoms of shortness of breath, lower extremity swelling, and fatigue without exacerbation within the 2 weeks prior to admission.
  - **c.** Acute on chronic HF refers to patients with chronic HF who present with acute or worsening symptoms within 2 weeks of surgery.
- **8. Stable angina:** angina without a change in frequency or pattern for the six weeks prior. Angina is controlled by rest and/or oral or transcutaneous medications.

#### **9. Unstable angina**

- **a.** Rest angina (occurring at rest and prolonged, usually >20 minutes)
- **b.** New‐onset angina (within the past two months, of at least Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) class III severity)
- **c.** Increasing angina (previously diagnosed angina that has become distinctly more frequent, longer in duration, or increased by one or more CCS classes to at least CCS III severity)
- **10. Non‐ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (non‐STEMI):** the patient was hospitalized for a NSTEMI as documented in the medical record. The definition in prior data specifications was the presence of both:
  - **a.** Cardiac biomarkers (creatinine kinase‐myocardial band, troponin T or I) that exceed the upper limit of normal. Laboratory confirmation of myocardial necrosis; laboratory parameters with a clinical presentation consistent or suggestive of ischemia. ECG changes and/or ischemic symptoms may or may not be present.
  - **b.** Absence of ECG changes diagnostic of a STEMI.
- **11. ST‐elevation MI (STEMI):** the patient presented with a STEMI of its equivalent as documented in the medical records. The definition in prior data specifications was the presence of both:
  - **a.** New/presumed new ST segment elevation or new left bundle branch block not documented to be resolved within 20 minutes. ST segment elevation is defined by new or presumed new sustained ST segment elevation at the J‐point in two contiguous ECG leads with the cut‐off points: ≥0.2 mV in men or ≥0.15 mV in women in leads V2–V3 and/or ≥0.1 mV in other leads and lasting greater than or equal to 20 minutes. ST elevation in the posterior chest leads (V7 through V9), or ST depression that is maximal in V1–V3, without ST segment elevation in other leads, demonstrating posterobasal myocardial infarction, is considered a STEMI equivalent.
  - **b.** Cardiac biomarkers (CK‐MB, troponin T or I) exceed the upper limit of normal with a clinical presentation which is consistent or suggestive of ischemia.
- **12. Cardiogenic shock:** a sustained (>30 min) episode of hypoperfusion evidenced by systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg and/or, if available, cardiac index <2.2 L/min/m2 secondary to cardiac dysfunction and/or the requirement for parenteral inotropic or vasopressor agents or mechanical support (e.g. IABP, extracorporeal circulation, VADs) to maintain blood pressure and cardiac index above those specified levels.
- **13. Resuscitation:** CPR required within 24 hours prior to induction of anesthesia for surgery, which may include use of ECMO or mechanical circulatory support exclusive of an IABP.

#### **14. Urgency**

- **a.** Elective: the patient's cardiac function has been stable in the days or weeks prior to the operation. The procedure could be deferred without increased risk of compromised cardiac outcome.
- **b.** Urgent: procedure required during same hospitalization in order to minimize chance of further clinical deterioration. This includes but is not limited to: worsening or sudden chest pain, HF, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), anatomy, IABP, unstable angina with intravenous nitroglycerin (IV NTG), or rest angina. Any of the conditions that require that the patient remain in the hospital until surgery can take place, but the patient is able to wait for surgery until the next available OR schedule time. Delay in the operation may be necessitated by attempts to improve the patient's

- condition, availability of a spouse or parent for informed consent, availability of blood products, or the availability of results of essential laboratory procedures or tests.
- **c.** Emergent: surgery is indicated without any delay for ongoing, refractory (difficult, complicated, and/or unmanageable) unrelenting cardiac compromise, with or without hemodynamic instability, and not responsive to any form of therapy except cardiac surgery. Examples include:
  - **i.** Hemodynamic picture of shock that is being chemically or mechanically supported, such as IV inotrope or IABP to maintain cardiac output
  - **ii.** Pulmonary edema requiring intubation and ventilation
  - **iii.** An extending MI
  - **iv.** Signs of ongoing ischemia, i.e. ECG changes
  - **v.** Acute native valve dysfunction, (acute papillary muscle rupture or torn leaflet)
  - **vi.** Prosthetic valve dysfunction with structural failure (valve‐fractured or torn leaflet, thrombus formation, pannus development which impedes flow through the valve orifice, or valvular dehiscence)
  - **vii.** Acute aortic dissection, rupture or dissection during cardiac cath; perforation, tamponade following cardiac cath
- **d.** Emergent/Salvage: the patient is undergoing CPR en route to the OR prior to anesthesia induction or has ongoing ECMO to maintain life.

#### **Postoperative Complications**

**1. Operative mortality:** all deaths, regardless of cause, occurring during the hospitalization in which the operation was performed, even if after 30 days (including patients transferred to other acute care facilities) and all deaths, regardless of cause, occurring after discharge from the hospital, but before the end of the 30th postoperative day.

#### **2. Neurological deficit**

- **a.** Permanent stroke: any confirmed neurological deficit of abrupt onset caused by a disturbance in blood supply to the brain that did not resolve within 24 hours.
- **b.** Encephalopathy: altered mental state
- **c.** New postoperative paralysis, paraparesis, or paraplegia related to spinal cord ischemia and not related to a stroke.

#### **3. Renal failure**

- **a.** An increase in serum creatinine level 3.0 × greater than baseline, or serum creatinine level ≥4 mg/dL. Acute rise must be at least 0.5 mg/dL.
- **b.** A new requirement for dialysis postoperatively.
- **4. Prolonged ventilation:** prolonged postoperative pulmonary ventilation >24 hours from time of OR exit plus any additional hours following reintubation.
- **5. Superficial wound infection:** an infection that occurs within 30 days after the procedure, **and** involves only skin/subcutaneous tissue of the incision, **and** the patient has at least one of the following:
  - **a.** Purulent drainage from the superficial incision
  - **b.** Organisms isolated from an aseptically obtained culture of fluid or tissue from the superficial incision
  - **c.** Superficial incision that is deliberately opened and is culture positive or not cultured **and** patient has ≥1 of the following: localized pain or tenderness, localized swelling, erythema, or heat. Note that cellulitis alone or a stitch abscess does not qualify as a superficial incisional infection.

- **6. Deep sternal wound infection:** an infection that occurs within 30 days after the procedure, **and** involves deep soft tissues of the incision (e.g. fascial and muscle layers) **with** at least one of the following:
  - **a.** Purulent drainage from the deep incision
  - **b.** A deep incision that spontaneously dehisces or is deliberately opened and is culture‐ positive or not cultured, **and** the patient has at least one of the following signs or symptoms: fever (>38 °C), localized pain or tenderness, an abscess or other evidence of infection involving the deep incision that is detected on direct examination, during invasive procedure, or by histopathologic examination or imaging test.
- **7. Organ system infection** that occurs within 30 days after the procedure that involves any part of the body deeper than the fascia or muscle layers that is opened or manipulated during the operative procedure and the patient has at least one of the following:
  - **a.** Purulent drainage from a drain that is placed into the organ/space
  - **b.** Organisms isolated from an aseptically obtained culture of fluid or tissue in the organ/space
  - **c.** An abscess or other evidence of infection involving the organ/space that is detected on direct examination, during invasive procedure, or by histopathologic examination or imaging test, **and** meets at least one of the following criteria for a specific organ/ space infection of mediastinitis:
    - ∙ Organisms cultured from mediastinal tissue or fluid obtained during an invasive procedure
    - ∙ Evidence of mediastinitis seen during an invasive procedure or histopathologic examination; **and**
    - ∙ **At least 1** of the following signs or symptoms: fever (>38 °C), chest pain, or sternal instability; **and**
    - ∙ **At least 1** of the following: purulent discharge from mediastinal area or organisms cultured from blood or discharge from mediastinal area

# **20** Technique of Thoracentesis

- **A.** The level of the fluid should be determined on chest x‐ray and confirmed by dullness to percussion. The skin is prepped and draped. One percent lidocaine is used for local anesthesia of the skin. A 22‐gauge needle is passed to the upper border of the rib and the periosteum is anesthetized. The needle is then passed over the rib into the pleural space.
- **B.** When the pleural space has been entered, fluid should be aspirated to confirm that the effusion has been located. A larger "intracatheter" needle is then passed into the pleural cavity, the plastic catheter advanced, and the metal needle withdrawn to prevent injury to the lung as it expands to appose the parietal pleura. The fluid is then aspirated into collection bottles.

# **21** Technique for Tube Thoracostomy

![](_page_367_Picture_3.jpeg)

**1.** Skin incision. One percent lidocaine is used for local anesthesia. A subcutaneous wheal is raised over the fifth or sixth intercostal space in the midaxillary line. The needle is passed to the upper border of the rib and the periosteum is anesthetized. Fluid should be aspirated from an effusion to confirm its location. A 1 cm incision is then made.

**2.** Pleural entry. The dissection is carried down to and through the intercostal muscles with a Kelly clamp, the parietal pleura is penetrated, and the pleural cavity is entered. Finger dissection should be used only if loculations are known to be present.

**3.** Chest tube placement. The chest tube is inserted and directed towards the apex for air and posteriorly for fluid. The tube should be clamped during insertion if fluid is being drained. The tube is then secured with a 2‐0 silk suture. A trocar should **never** be used to penetrate the pleura.
