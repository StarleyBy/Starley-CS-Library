## **13** Post‐ICU Care and Other Complications

## **I. General Comments**

- **A.** Following a brief stay in the intensive care unit, most patients undergoing cardiac surgical procedures follow a routine pattern of recovery. The use of fast‐track protocols and critical care pathways ensures that the healthcare team and the patient have a clear understanding of what to expect at different junctures during recovery. These pathways are designed to standardize care and identify variances from the expected. However, they are not a substitute for careful patient evaluation, which may identify problems that might otherwise be ignored by rigid adherence to protocols.
- **B.** Most patients are transferred to an intermediate care unit or the postoperative cardiac surgical floor on the first postoperative day. Invasive monitoring is no longer utilized, although bedside telemetry should be considered for several days to identify arrhythmias. It should be remembered that patients are still in an early phase of recovery from surgery with many physiologic derangements still present. Restoring the patient to a normal physiologic state requires careful attention to the prevention, identification, and treatment of complications that may develop at any time during the hospital stay. A detailed daily examination of the patient must be performed, with particular attention paid to each organ system. Although pre‐printed or computerized order sets are available upon transfer, orders must be thought out carefully and individualized to ensure the best possible postoperative care.
- **C.** Although postoperative complications are more common in elderly patients and those with comorbidities, they may still develop unpredictably in low‐risk, healthy patients despite an uneventful surgical procedure and early postoperative course. Problems such as atrial arrhythmias are very common and quite benign, with little influence on the patient's hospital course or long‐term prognosis. In contrast, less common complications, such as stroke, mediastinitis, tamponade, renal failure, or an acute abdomen, may be devastating, resulting in early death or prolonged hospitalization with multisystem organ failure.

## **II. Transfer from the ICU and Postoperative Routines**

The patient recovering uneventfully from open‐heart surgery is usually extubated within 6–8 hours and off all inotropic support by the first postoperative morning. The following interventions represent standardized steps in a critical care pathway which are applicable to most patients (Table 13.1). In more critically ill patients who may require an additional period of ventilatory or pharmacologic support, adherence to these time‐related recommendations may need to be modified, and withdrawal of "intensive care" must be carefully

## **III. Differential Diagnosis of Common Postoperative Symptoms**

The development of chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, or just feeling "plain lousy" with a poor appetite and fatigue during the early convalescent period is not unusual, especially in elderly patients. Although the cause of these signs and symptoms may be benign, they should

not be taken lightly because they may indicate the presence of potentially serious problems that warrant investigation. Careful questioning and examination of the patient on a daily or more frequent basis can prioritize diagnoses, direct the evaluation, and lead to prompt and appropriate treatment.

## **A. Chest pain**

- **1. Differential diagnosis.** The development of chest pain following cardiac surgery often raises the suspicion of myocardial ischemia, but the differential diagnosis must include several other potential causes. The greatest fear to a patient is that the recurrence of chest pain indicates a failed operation; the surgeon meanwhile may purposely try to provide an alternative explanation. Although musculoskeletal pain is the most common cause of chest discomfort, significant problems that must be considered include:
  - ∙ Myocardial ischemia
  - ∙ Pericarditis

- ∙ Arrhythmias
- ∙ Pneumothorax
- ∙ Pneumonia
- ∙ Pulmonary embolism
- ∙ Sternal wound infection
- ∙ Aortic dissection
- ∙ Gastroesophageal reflux
- **2. Evaluation.** Careful physical examination (breath sounds, pericardial rub, sternal wound), a chest x‐ray, and 12‐lead ECG will usually provide the appropriate diagnosis and direct additional testing. Differentiation of ST‐segment elevation related to ischemia vs. pericarditis is important and can be difficult to make (Figures 8.2 and 8.3, pages 384 and 385). Consultation with the cardiology service is essential in managing patients with a suspected cardiac origin to their chest pain. Stress imaging or even coronary angiography may be warranted. Other diagnostic modalities include echocardiography, computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography to rule out pulmonary embolism, and sternal wound aspiration.

## **B. Shortness of breath**

- **1. Differential diagnosis.** Shortness of breath is usually caused by splinting from chest wall discomfort and is not uncommon in the anemic patient with underlying lung disease. However, significant shortness of breath, its acute onset, or deterioration in pulmonary status should raise awareness of a significant problem. The source may be of a primary pulmonary nature, but it may also be the consequence of cardiac dysfunction or oliguric acute kidney injury (AKI). Diagnoses to be considered include:
  - **a.** Pleuropulmonary problems
    - ∙ Atelectasis and hypoxia from mucus plugging or poor inspiratory effort
    - ∙ Pneumothorax
    - ∙ Pneumonia (possibly aspiration)
    - ∙ Bronchospasm
    - ∙ An enlarging pleural effusion
    - ∙ Pulmonary embolism
  - **b.** Cardiopulmonary problems low cardiac output states or acute pulmonary edema caused by:
    - ∙ Acute myocardial ischemia or infarction
    - ∙ Cardiac tamponade
    - ∙ Residual or new‐onset mitral regurgitation (ischemic, associated with systemic hypertension) or a recurrent ventricular septal defect
    - ∙ Fluid overload from surgery or heart failure, often associated with oliguric AKI
    - ∙ Severe diastolic dysfunction
    - ∙ Atrial or ventricular tachyarrhythmias
  - **c.** Compensatory response to metabolic acidosis (low cardiac output state)
  - **d.** Sepsis

**2. Evaluation.** Careful lung examination may reveal absent breath sounds or diffuse rales/rhonchi, suggesting a parenchymal process, a pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. Clinical evidence of cardiac tamponade (muffled heart sounds, orthostatic blood pressure changes, pulsus paradoxus) should be sought. An arterial blood gas (ABG), chest x‐ray, and ECG should be obtained. An echocardiogram gives an assessment of ventricular function, detects valve dysfunction or recurrent shunting, and may also identify a large left pleural or pericardial effusion or tamponade. A CT pulmonary angiogram should be performed if pulmonary embolism is suspected.

## **C. Fever**

- **1. Differential diagnosis.** Fever is very common during the first 48–72 hours after surgery. Initially, it may be related to the systemic inflammatory response or cytokine release from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), but subsequently is usually ascribed to atelectasis from poor inspiratory effort after extubation. Thorough evaluation of recurrent fevers is warranted after the first 72 hours.1,2 Potential causes of postoperative fever include:
  - ∙ Atelectasis or pneumonia
  - ∙ Urinary tract infection (UTI)
  - ∙ Wound infections: sternum or leg
  - ∙ *Clostridium difficile* colitis or other intra‐abdominal process
  - ∙ Sinusitis (usually in patients with indwelling endotracheal or nasogastric tubes)
  - ∙ Catheter sepsis
  - ∙ Endocarditis (especially on a prosthetic valve)
  - ∙ Decubitus ulcer
  - ∙ Drug fever
  - ∙ Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism
  - ∙ Postpericardiotomy syndrome (PPS)
- **2. Evaluation.** The lungs, chest, and leg incisions should be examined carefully. A CBC with differential, chest x‐ray, urinalysis, and appropriate cultures should be performed. A stool sample for *C. difficile* should be obtained if the patient has abdominal pain or diarrhea. Indwelling central and arterial lines should be cultured and removed if in place for more than five days or if cultures return positive. If the WBC is normal or there is an eosinophilia, a drug fever may be present. Occult sternal infections may be investigated with a chest CT scan, but results are usually nonspecific; needle aspiration may be performed if suspicion is high. Head CT scans can identify sinusitis. A transesophageal echocardiogram can evaluate the heart valves for vegetations consistent with endocarditis.
- **3. Treatment.** It is best to defer antibiotic therapy until an organism has been identified. However, a broad‐spectrum antibiotic may be initiated based on the presumed source and organisms involved as soon as cultures have been obtained. This is especially important in patients who have received prosthetic material (valves, grafts). A more narrow‐spectrum antibiotic may be substituted subsequently. Empiric oral

vancomycin (125 mg four times a day) may be started for suspected *C. difficile* colitis. Occasionally a patient will have a fever and elevated WBC with no evident source, but will respond to a brief course of antibiotics. Further comments on nosocomial infections and sepsis can be found on pages 776–778.

## **IV. Respiratory Care and Complications3,4**

- **A.** Respiratory function is still impaired when the patient is transferred to the postoperative floor, with many patients exhibiting shortness of breath with some splinting from chest wall discomfort. Arterial desaturation is not uncommon, and all patients should have an arterial saturation measured several times daily by pulse oximetry until the SaO2 remains above 90%. It is not uncommon to see significant desaturation when the patient becomes more ambulatory. Most patients have some degree of fluid overload and require diuresis, and steps must be taken to overcome a poor inspiratory effort and atelectasis. Potential complications, such as pneumonia, bronchospasm, pleural effusions, or pneumothorax, can be identified by examination and a chest x‐ray (Table 13.3). Standard orders should include:
  - **1.** Supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula at 2–6 L/min on the postoperative floor. In the ICU, high flow oxygen systems or BPAP are useful for hypoxemia, but after transfer to the floor, if the patient requires more than supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula or facemask to achieve an acceptable oxygen saturation, they should probably be transferred back to an ICU setting for more intensive respiratory care.
  - **2.** Frequent use of incentive spirometry to encourage deep breathing
  - **3.** Progressive mobilization
  - **4.** Provision of adequate, but not excessive, analgesia. Patient‐controlled analgesia (usually morphine) is particularly beneficial for one or two days following surgery, and may be supplemented with other pain medications, such as ketorolac (Toradol) 15–30 mg IV q6h for a few days. In patients with abnormal renal function, IV acetaminophen is beneficial in the ICU. Most patients obtain adequate analgesia with oral medications 2–3 days after surgery and seem to do better with regular, rather than prn, pain medications.

## **Table 13.3 • Postoperative Respiratory Complications**

- Atelectasis
- Pleural effusions
- Pneumothorax
- Pneumonia (possibly aspiration)
- Bronchospasm
- Pulmonary edema (noncardiogenic or cardiogenic)
- Hypoxemic/hypercapneic respiratory failure/ARDS
- Pulmonary embolism
- Diaphragmatic dysfunction (phrenic nerve paresis)
- Chylothorax

- **5.** Bronchodilators administered via nebulizers should be used if copious secretions or bronchospasm are present (see pages 503–504). These commonly include albuterol, levalbuterol (Xopenex), or a combination of albuterol and ipratropium (Duoneb). Chest physical therapy may benefit patients having difficulty raising secretions.
- **6.** Measures to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism (antiembolism stockings, sequential compression devices, subcutaneous heparin or low‐molecular‐weight heparin [LMWH]) should be considered depending on the patient's mobility and risk (see section E on pages 750–752).
- **7.** Patients with a history of obstructive sleep apnea should utilize CPAP machines at night or any other device that has been helpful to them prior to surgery.
- **B.** Patients with preexisting lung disease and a history of heavy smoking often have a tenuous respiratory status postoperatively with borderline oxygenation, and acute decompensation can occur with little provocation, including ambulation. Mucus plugging, atelectasis from poor inspiratory effort, mobilization of "third space" fluid, or even a minor cardiac event can cause arterial desaturation and respiratory distress. In patients without significant underlying lung disease, acute decompensation usually indicates the presence of a significant process, such as a pleuropulmonary event (significant pneumothorax, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism), myocardial ischemia, worsening mitral regurgitation, cardiac tamponade, or acute fluid overload from AKI with oliguria.
- **C.** The management of respiratory insufficiency, pneumothorax, pleural effusions, and bronchospasm is discussed in Chapter 10. Other complications, including diaphragmatic dysfunction from phrenic nerve paresis and pulmonary embolism, are discussed below.
- **D. Diaphragmatic dysfunction** from phrenic nerve injury has been noted in 10–20% of patients following open‐heart surgery.5

## **1. Etiology and prevention**

- **a.** Cold injury to the phrenic nerve from use of iced saline slush in the pericardial well is the primary cause of this problem. Systemic hypothermia may also be contributory. Use of insulation cooling pads that protect the phrenic nerve from cold solutions, minimizing systemic hypothermia, intermittently pouring cold saline over the heart (the "shallow technique"), and avoiding iced slush reduce the incidence of phrenic nerve paresis.6–8
- **b.** The phrenic nerve may be injured directly during dissection of the internal thoracic artery (ITA) in the upper mediastinum, especially on the right side. It may also be damaged when making a V‐incision in the pericardium to allow for better lie of the ITA pedicle. Phrenic nerve devascularization with compromise of the pericardiophrenic artery may also be contributory, especially in patients with diabetes.9

#### **2. Presentation**

- **a.** Most patients with unilateral phrenic nerve paresis have few respiratory symptoms and are extubated uneventfully. Difficulty weaning, shortness of breath, and the requirement for reintubation may be noted in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
- **b.** Bilateral phrenic nerve palsy usually produces tachypnea, paradoxical abdominal breathing, and CO2 retention during attempts to wean from mechanical ventilation.

## **3. Evaluation**

- **a.** A chest x‐ray will demonstrate an elevated hemidiaphragm at end‐expiration during spontaneous ventilation, most commonly on the left side. This will not be evident during mechanical ventilation. An elevated hemidiaphragm may be difficult to appreciate if basilar atelectasis or a pleural effusion is present. Therefore, when planning a thoracentesis or tube thoracostomy for a pleural effusion, one must always consider the possibility of an obscured, elevated hemidiaphragm. The position of the gastric bubble on chest x‐ray should identify the position of the diaphragm on the left. If the diaphragm is elevated, one might inadvertently insert a needle below the diaphragm, risking injury to intra‐abdominal structures.
- **b.** Diaphragmatic fluoroscopy ("sniff test") will demonstrate paradoxical upward motion of the diaphragm during spontaneous inspiration if unilateral paralysis is present.
- **c.** Ultrasonography will show a hypokinetic, immobile, or paradoxically moving diaphragm during respiration.
- **d.** Transcutaneous phrenic nerve stimulation in the neck with recording of diaphragmatic potentials over the seventh and eighth intercostal spaces can measure phrenic nerve conduction velocities and latency times.10 This is helpful in assessing whether phrenic nerve dysfunction may be a contributing factor to a patient's respiratory problems.
- **e.** Transdiaphragmatic pressure measurements can be used to make the diagnosis in patients with bilateral phrenic nerve palsies.11
- **4. Treatment** is supportive until phrenic nerve function recovers, which may take up to two years. One study of patients with COPD found that nearly 25% of patients had persistent pulmonary problems with a decreased quality of life at midterm follow‐up.12 Diaphragmatic plication can provide significant symptomatic and objective improvement in patients with marked dyspnea. This can be performed robotically or via a thoracotomy (video‐assisted [VATS] or open) or laparoscopically.13 Ventilatory support is usually necessary for patients with bilateral involvement. Some patients can be managed at home with a cuirass respirator or a rocking bed.
- **E. Venous thromboembolism** (VTE) is a term that describes both deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and **pulmonary embolism** (PE). Screening noninvasive studies have documented a 15–20% incidence of DVT and a 6–20% incidence of PE after cardiac surgical procedures, with both being more common after OPCAB.14,15 However, symptomatic VTE is noted in only about 1–2% of patients.16,17 One study of routine CT pulmonary angiography and lower‐extremity venous studies in patients undergoing elective CABGs and considered at low risk for VTE reported a 21% incidence of DVT, and in more than half of these patients, PE occurred in the absence of lower‐extremity DVT.18
  - **1.** It has been presumed, perhaps inappropriately so, that the risk of postoperative VTE is low because of heparinization and hemodilution during surgery and the presence of thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction in the early postoperative period. However, platelet activity is increased immediately after surgery, and elevated fibrinogen levels, thrombin generation, tissue factor activation, and reduced fibrinolysis are also noted. Increased platelet reactivity and aspirin resistance are

particularly common after off‐pump surgery, although the risk of symptomatic VTE is still only 1%.19–22 A study of patients undergoing on‐pump CABGs found that the absorption of aspirin was reduced early after surgery, leading to reduced antiplatelet effect that could contribute to VTE.23 Thus low‐dose aspirin may not be sufficient to inhibit platelet aggregation early after surgery, although this may impact graft patency more than the risk of VTE.

- **2. Risk factors** for VTE in the perioperative period include older age, obesity (BMI >30), right‐ or left‐heart failure, a history of VTE, prolonged bed rest and immobility, prolonged ventilation, multiple blood and blood product transfusions, and the occurrence of significant postoperative complications, including acute kidney injury, infection/sepsis, and neurological complications.17,24,25 VTE may result from heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and may occur several weeks later.
- **3. Prevention.** Numerous studies have evaluated the use of mechanical or pharmacologic prophylaxis from which general recommendations can be made.25–27
  - **a.** Early mobilization is the most important factor in reducing the risk of VTE. Once the patient is stable, getting them out of bed and ambulating several times a day is very important. Having a patient sit in a chair is the least desirable position.
  - **b.** Elastic graduated compression stockings (GCS), such as T.E.D. stockings, should be placed after the initial leg dressing and ace wraps are removed, and should be placed on both legs. Use of sequential compression devices (SCDs) or intermittent pneumatic compression devices (IPCs) in well‐mobilized ambulatory patients provides little additional benefit to use of GCS alone.26,27
  - **c.** Although increased platelet reactivity and aggregation are present in postoperative patients, most patients are usually given aspirin 81 mg daily after surgery. This dose is insufficient to inhibit platelet aggregation and probably provides little benefit in reducing the risk of VTE.20 One study did demonstrate, however, that the addition of low‐dose aspirin to heparin 5000 units SC q8h reduced the risk of VTE nearly fivefold in patients undergoing OPCAB.28
  - **d.** ICU patients may be maintained at bedrest because of ongoing clinical issues and are usually poorly mobilized. For these patients as well as those with the risk factors listed above in section E.2, pharmacologic prophylaxis should be considered in addition to compression devices. One study found the combination of heparin plus one of these devices reduced the risk of PE by 60% compared with heparin alone,29 although another study of ICU patients found no added benefit of IPC when the patient was already receiving heparin.30 Nonetheless, the literature remains controversial on whether early initiation of pharmacologic prophylaxis with either SQ heparin (5000 units SC q12h) or LMWH (40 mg SC daily) should be considered in these patients and when it should be started. Some authors recommend initiating one of these medications on the first postoperative day once mediastinal bleeding has tapered off,24,25,31 but other guidelines have concluded that the bleeding risk outweighs the early benefits.32 The risk of developing a hemopericardium leading to cardiac tamponade must always be taken into consideration when deciding whether to initiate heparin early after surgery.

- **4. Manifestations.** Pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath with hypoxemia are usually present. The acute onset of these symptoms distinguishes them from typical postoperative respiratory symptoms. The new onset of atrial fibrillation (AF), sinus tachycardia, or fever of unknown origin may be clues to the diagnosis. Calf tenderness and edema are unreliable signs of DVT, especially in the leg from which the vein has been harvested. However, the new development of such findings several days to weeks after surgery should prompt further evaluation.
- **5. Assessment.** ABGs, a chest x‐ray, ECG, and CT pulmonary angiography should be obtained. The presence of a low arterial oxygen saturation is nonspecific, but may be compared with values obtained earlier in the postoperative course. A positive venous noninvasive study of the lower extremities in association with respiratory symptoms and hypoxia is suggestive evidence of a pulmonary embolism and should prompt further evaluation. A falling platelet count with VTE mandates evaluation for HIT, for which alternative anticoagulation should be initiated.
- **6. Treatment.** Traditionally, IV heparin has been recommended for 1 week (unless HIT is present), followed by warfarin for six months. However, equally effective therapy can be achieved with the use of a non‐vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC), such as apixaban (10 mg bid × 1 week, then 5 mg bid) or rivaroxaban (15 mg bid × 3 weeks, then 20 mg daily) – doses conditional upon renal function – and these medications do not require blood monitoring. Early ambulation has not been shown to increase the risk of extending the DVT or developing pulmonary embolism, although bedrest was traditionally considered part of routine management.33,34 An inferior vena cava filter should be placed if anticoagulation is contraindicated. Systemic thrombolytic therapy should be avoided because of the recent sternotomy incision, although ultrasound‐assisted catheter‐directed thrombolysis using the EKOS system might be considered.35,36 Other interventional methods, including suction embolectomy and fragmentation therapy, may be beneficial in patients with massive PE,37 reserving surgery for salvage situations to avoid a redo sternotomy and pump run. However, surgical pulmonary embolectomy may be applicable to hemodynamically stable patients with massive PE and may be preferable in the rare patient with massive pulmonary embolism early after cardiac surgery, when thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated.38,39

## **V. Cardiac Care and Complications**

- **A.** Upon transfer to the postoperative floor, the patient should be attached to a telemetry system to continuously monitor the heart rate and rhythm for several days. Vital signs are obtained every shift if the patient is stable, but more frequently if the patient's heart rate, rhythm, or blood pressure is abnormal or marginal.
- **B.** The evaluation and management of complications noted most frequently in the intensive care unit are presented in Chapter 11. These include low cardiac output states, perioperative infarction, cardiac arrest, coronary spasm, hypertension, and arrhythmias. This section will discuss several cardiac problems commonly noted during subsequent convalescence (Table 13.4).

## **C. Arrhythmias and conduction problems**

**1. Atrial arrhythmias** are the most common complication of open‐heart surgery and occur with a peak incidence on the second or third postoperative day. Although

## **Table 13.4 • Cardiac Complications of Cardiac Surgery**

- Atrial and ventricular arrhythmias
- Low cardiac output syndrome: RV dysfunction, LV systolic or diastolic dysfunction
- Myocardial ischemia/infarction
- Coronary vasospasm
- Hypertension
- Hypotension
- Cardiac tamponade: early or delayed
- Acute pericarditis
- Postpericardiotomy syndrome
- Cardiac arrest
- Constrictive pericarditis (late)

some patients become symptomatic with lightheadedness, fatigue, or palpitations, many have no symptoms and are noted to be in AF or flutter on telemetry monitoring. Treatment entails rate control, attempted conversion to sinus rhythm, and anticoagulation if AF persists or recurs. Management protocols are discussed in detail on pages 626–632 and in Table 11.15 (page 627).

- **2. Ventricular arrhythmias** are always of concern because they may be attributable to myocardial ischemia or infarction and may herald cardiac arrest. Low‐grade ectopy or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) with normal ventricular function does not require aggressive therapy and may be managed with a ß‐blocker. In contrast, VT with impaired LV function requires further evaluation and may benefit from placement of an implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator (ICD). An echocardiogram should be considered and may identify new regional wall motion abnormalities attributable to a perioperative infarction, which may account for the arrhythmia. On occasion, when epicardial wires are still connected to a temporary pacemaker, VT may develop due to improper sensing, with inadvertent firing on the T wave triggering the malignant arrhythmias ("R on T" phenomenon).
- **3. Conduction abnormalities and heart block** (see pages 614–618). Temporary pacemaker wires are routinely removed by the third postoperative day unless there is evidence of symptomatic sinus bradycardia, lengthy sinus pauses, advanced degrees of heart block, or a slow ventricular response to AF. If these issues are present, medications that reduce atrial automaticity or reduce AV conduction (β‐ blockers, amiodarone, calcium‐channel blockers [CCBs], and digoxin) should be stopped. If they persist, permanent pacemaker implantation should be considered.
  - **a.** New bundle branch or fascicular blocks have been noted in up to 45% of patients after CABG and appear to correlate with longer aortic cross‐clamp times. However, they resolve in more than half of the patients before discharge.40,41
  - **b.** Patients with sick sinus or tachycardia/bradycardia syndrome may have a rapid ventricular response to AF intermixed with a slow sinus mechanism that limits use of ß‐blockers. A permanent pacemaker (PPM) system should be considered if these problems persist beyond three days. Studies have shown, however, that pacemaker dependence usually resolves within a few months, unless the indication was complete heart block.42

- **c.** Patients undergoing aortic valve surgery are more prone to conduction disturbances and heart block because of debridement, edema, hemorrhage, or suturing near the conduction system. The average incidence of PPM is 5–9% after AVR,43,44 but it is greater in patients receiving rapid deployment valves.45 Preoperative conduction system disease (first‐degree block, left anterior hemiblock, right bundle branch block [RBBB], or left bundle branch block [LBBB]) is generally the major risk factor for the development of heart block using both traditional and rapid deployment valves. Both the development of a new postoperative LBBB and the necessity for a permanent pacemaker early after AVR have adverse prognostic significance with a compromise in long‐term survival.46,47
- **d.** When pacemaker wires are removed, there is always the potential for bleeding and the development of tamponade. It is recommended that they be removed when the INR is less than 2, but this does not eliminate the possibility of bleeding. If the INR remains persistently elevated, the wires may be cut and left behind. After removal, the patient should remain at bedrest for one hour and vital signs should be taken every 15 minutes for the first hour and then hourly for a few hours to monitor for orthostatic changes. Tamponade can occur within minutes or hours and can prove fatal unless the possibility is entertained and addressed on an urgent, if not emergent, basis. If concern is raised because of hypotension or a complaint of chest pain, a STAT echocardiogram may be helpful. Emergency thoracotomy at the bedside may be life‐saving.
- **e.** A transfemoral temporary pacing wire may be retained at the conclusion of a TAVR procedure if the heart rate is very slow or there is evidence of advanced heart block. The latter is more likely to develop in patients with a preexisting RBBB and first‐degree AV block.
  - **i.** If the heart rate stabilizes above 50–60/min and there is no evidence of complete heart block, the wire may be removed several hours later or the following morning. Despite this common practice, some patients with these preexisting conduction abnormalities may still develop delayed heart block (>48 hours later). If heart block persists, permanent pacemaker implantation may be necessary. Guidelines for management of conduction disturbances after TAVR are noted on page 615.48 One study found that only 21% of patients receiving a PPM after TAVR were pacer‐dependent at one year; however, pacer dependence was more common with use of self‐expanding valves and post‐balloon dilatation, or when complete heart block was the indication for the PPM.49
  - **ii.** When the transvenous pacing wire and the 6 Fr transfemoral sheath are removed from the femoral vein after a TAVR, persistent bleeding may occur despite a short period of manual pressure, because antiplatelet therapy is routinely administered within a few hours of the procedure. If this persists, simply suturing the skin entrance site and applying a sandbag are usually effective in controlling the bleeding.
- **D. Hypertension.** When the patient is transferred to the postoperative floor, oral antihypertensive medications must be substituted for the potent intravenous drugs used in the ICU. Blood pressure tends to return to its preoperative level several days after surgery once myocardial function has returned to baseline, the patient has been mobilized, and chest wall pain improves with moderate analgesia. Aggressive patient‐specific

management is important to prevent issues related to blood pressure variability. For example, a patient with renal dysfunction may need a slightly higher blood pressure to ensure renal perfusion. In contrast, more strict control of blood pressure may be essential in an elderly patient with fragile tissues or in patients with perioperative bleeding. Not only can hypertension increase cardiac wall stress and cause myocardial ischemia, but it may increase any residual mitral regurgitation and can precipitate an aortic dissection from graft or cannulation sites.

- **1.** A decrease in systolic blood pressure from preoperative levels may be noted in patients who are hypovolemic or anemic, or have experienced a perioperative infarction. In these patients, preoperative antihypertensive medications can be withheld and then restarted at lower doses when the blood pressure increases. In contrast, patients who have ongoing pain issues or have undergone an AVR for aortic stenosis may develop significant systolic hypertension.
- **2.** ß‐blockers are recommended for virtually all patients after surgery as prophylaxis against AF and can be titrated up to control the heart rate and blood pressure as well. Resumption of the patient's preoperative medications should then be instituted to optimize blood pressure control. Other considerations when selecting an antihypertensive medication include the following:
  - **a.** Poor ventricular function (EF <40%): use one of the ACE inhibitors or ARBs. A ß‐blocker, preferably carvedilol, should also be given in this situation, but must be used cautiously if the patient has decompensated heart failure or a low output syndrome.
  - **b.** Sinus tachycardia with good LV function, or with evidence of residual myocardial ischemia: use higher doses of a ß‐blocker (metoprolol) or labetalol.
  - **c.** Coronary spasm or use of a radial artery graft: use a nitrate or CCB (amlodipine, diltiazem, or nicardipine).
  - **d.** Sinus bradycardia with good LV function: if initial use of an ACE inhibitor or ARB is insufficient, amlodipine should be considered.
- **E. Hypotension** may develop after transfer to the floor and should be evaluated using the differential diagnosis of shock or a low cardiac output state (see Chapter 11).
  - **1. Etiology.** The possibility of a significant clinical condition should always be considered in a patient with hypotension, although transient hypotension is usually of a benign etiology. It is best to correlate the patient's cuff pressure with an arterial line pressure in the ICU before the catheter is removed, because a significant discrepancy can confound interpretation of cuff pressures on the postoperative floor. Concerns must always include the possibility of hypoxemia, myocardial ischemia/infarction with cardiogenic shock, an aortic dissection (if discrepant upper extremity pulses), sepsis, and especially delayed **tamponade** (see section G, pages 757–761). However, the more common causes of hypotension several days after surgery include:
    - ∙ Hypovolemia, usually from aggressive diuresis
    - ∙ Profound anemia
    - ∙ β‐blockers or amiodarone used prophylactically to prevent AF
    - ∙ Significant bradycardia
    - ∙ Arrhythmias, especially a rapid ventricular response to AF/flutter and then the medications used to treat them, which usually lower the blood pressure (β‐blockers, CCBs, amiodarone)

- ∙ Vasoplegia from the residual effects of the systemic inflammatory response from CPB or from a diabetic autonomic neuropathy
- ∙ Initiating too high a dose of the patient's preoperative medications. Often the patient's initial postoperative hypertension is related to pain and sympathetic overactivity, and once these resolve, hypotension may result, necessitating fluid resuscitation and unnecessary transfusions.

## **2. Assessment and management**

- **a.** Review of the patient's medications, fluid status, orthostatic blood pressure measurements, heart rate and rhythm, pulse oximetry reading, 12‐lead ECG, and hematocrit should be sufficient to delineate the mechanism for hypotension. If the patient appears warm and well perfused, administration of a moderate amount of volume and modification of the medical regimen should suffice.
- **b.** Management of hypotension associated with AF can be problematic, in that medications that slow the rate tend to cause vasodilation and lower the blood pressure further (especially metoprolol and diltiazem). Amiodarone is an excellent alternative, and usually causes hypotension only with rapid IV infusion. However, in most patients, rate control will improve left ventricular filling and the blood pressure. If the patient has refractory hypotension with a fast rate that is difficult to control pharmacologically, cardioversion may be indicated.
- **c.** If the patient has refractory hypotension and does not appear well perfused, the likelihood of tamponade is increased and a STAT echocardiogram should be performed.
- **F. Myocardial ischemia.** The development of recurrent angina or new ECG changes (usually ST segment elevation) postoperatively always requires careful evaluation for evidence of ischemia or myocardial infarction. Manifestations may include a low output state, hypotension, heart failure and pulmonary edema, ventricular arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.

#### **1. Etiology**

- **a.** Coronary hypoperfusion from:
  - **1.** Acute thrombosis of a graft after CABG, either from an anastomotic problem, a kinked graft, or occasionally grafting to an incompletely endarterectomized artery
  - **2.** Reduced flow from anastomotic narrowing (technical issue) or hypoperfusion through a small conduit (for example, using a very small ITA graft or replacing a moderately diseased vein graft with a small ITA at reoperation)
  - **3.** Coronary spasm (graft or native vessel)
  - **4.** Nonbypassed, diseased coronary arteries either due to failure to locate the vessel, small vessel size, or severe calcification (incomplete revascularization)
  - **5.** Coronary ostial narrowing, occlusion or kinking after AVR or aortic root procedures with coronary button reimplantation
  - **6.** Circumflex artery compromise during mitral valve surgery
- **b.** Poor myocardial protection during surgery

#### **2. Evaluation**

**a.** Careful review of the ECG may indicate whether the ECG changes are consistent with ischemia or pericarditis (see Figures 8.2 and 8.3 on pages 384 and 385)

- **b.** Empiric use of a nitrate and/or CCB may be helpful for ischemia or spasm and can be diagnostic.
- **c.** Urgent coronary arteriography should be considered when there are significant ECG changes.50 It may identify a technical problem with a graft or confirm the diagnosis of spasm.
- **d.** In less urgent situations, a nuclear stress imaging study can be performed to identify the presence of myocardial ischemia and differentiate between ischemic and nonischemic causes of chest pain.

## **3. Treatment**

- **a.** Intensification of a medical regimen with nitrates and ß‐blockers is indicated.
- **b.** Placement of an intra‐aortic balloon pump (IABP) is beneficial for ongoing ischemia or evidence of hemodynamic compromise, especially in the immediate postoperative period. However, it should only be considered a supportive measure until the etiology of the problem is identified.
- **c.** If a technical problem with a graft is identified by coronary angiography, or on occasion, there is failure to graft the correct artery or the graft is placed proximal to the most significant stenosis, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is often the best treatment because it can be performed most expeditiously.50,51 If this is not feasible, but a major area of myocardium is in jeopardy and the patient has not suffered a significant perioperative myocardial infarction (PMI), reoperation should be considered. In contrast, medical management may be indicated if the coronary vessels supplying an ischemic zone are small and diffusely diseased, if they were bypassed but graft flow was limited by vessel runoff, or if they were not bypassable. Inability to address small vessels should only leave a minor area of the heart potentially ischemic. PCI of larger, more proximal stenotic segments may provide some benefit by improving inflow. If the patient has sustained an extensive infarction and has a delayed assessment, surgical intervention may not prove beneficial and may be high risk.
- **d.** The long‐term results of coronary bypass surgery are influenced by the development of atherosclerotic disease in bypass conduits, nonbypassed native arteries, or native arteries beyond the bypass sites. Factors that can improve these results include use of arterial grafting (one or both ITAs and a radial artery), aggressive control of risk factors, including abstinence from smoking, statins for dyslipidemia, optimal control of hypertension and diabetes, and use of aspirin for at least one year.52 Supplemental use of a P2Y12 inhibitor may be beneficial in patients undergoing surgery for acute coronary syndromes or after OPCABs. On rare occasions, the late development of ischemia has been attributed to a coronary steal syndrome, either from a coronary–subclavian steal or an ITA– pulmonary artery fistula.53
- **G. Pericardial effusions and delayed tamponade.** Pericardial effusions have been noted in about 60–75% of patients undergoing routine echocardiography in the first 1–2 weeks following surgery but usually resolve completely.54,55 Several large studies have shown that about 1–2% of patients may develop symptomatic effusions that gradually increase in size, leading to a low cardiac output state and tamponade that requires drainage.56,57 However, smaller series have suggested that invasive treatment for pretamponade or tamponade is indicated in about 5% of patients.58,59 This problem may

be noted within the first week of surgery or weeks later. Suspicion must remain high because symptoms may develop insidiously and can be difficult to differentiate from those noted in patients recovering slowly from surgery. **This is one of the most serious yet most potentially correctable of all postoperative problems.**

## **1. Etiology**

- **a.** Risk factors for development of pericardial effusions and delayed tamponade include:57–60
  - ∙ Use of perioperative antiplatelet drugs (aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitors) or other anticoagulants (heparin, LMWH, NOACs)
  - ∙ Early postoperative bleeding that requires blood product administration or re‐exploration
  - ∙ Early initiation of anticoagulation for VTE prophylaxis, mechanical valves, or the development of AF: a decision that must be made with caution as slow intrapericardial bleeding may occur despite minimal early postoperative bleeding.
  - ∙ Comorbidities including larger body surface area, hypertension, immunosuppression, chronic kidney disease (CKD), hepatic dysfunction
  - ∙ More advanced heart failure
  - ∙ Urgent surgery, more complex operations requiring longer durations of CPB (more coagulopathy), and surgery for endocarditis
- **b.** Acute hemorrhage may occur during removal of ventricular pacemaker wires from laceration of a superficial artery or vein overlying the right ventricle or from the right ventricle itself. Some surgeons request that pacing wires be removed prior to chest tube removal, but most commonly they are removed a few days after the chest tubes have been removed. Because bleeding might be exacerbated by anticoagulation, it is advisable to remove pacing wires before the INR becomes therapeutic, by withholding 1–2 doses of a NOAC, or by stopping heparin for a few hours to minimize that risk. If the patient is therapeutically anticoagulated, it may be advisable to cut the wires rather than remove them (see also page 609). Bleeding during withdrawal of atrial pacing wires may occur if the wires are directly attached to the atrial wall rather than placed into a plastic sleeve that is sewn to the heart (the Medtronic model 6500 wires). Rarely, a patient may develop a delayed rupture of an infarct zone or LV rupture from a mitral valve prosthesis.
- **c.** In patients with the above risk factors, especially those taking pre‐ or postoperative anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs, a progressively worsening hemopericardium may develop and the presentation may be insidious. In a large series from the Mayo Clinic, nonspecific symptoms often led to performance of an echocardiogram, but 42% of patients had hemodynamic compromise consistent with tamponade. This report also noted that half of the patients who had insignificant effusions on echo after valve surgery were readmitted with tamponade within two weeks of discharge.56
- **d.** Acute pericarditis is occasionally noted on a postoperative ECG and can be difficult to distinguish from an evolving MI (see Figure 8.3). This may be related to epicardial hemorrhage, undrained blood, or an early inflammatory response, but it is often of unclear etiology. It may be asymptomatic and

- noted only on an ECG and may contribute to the formation of serous or serosanguineous effusions.
- **e.** Late serous or serosanguineous effusions may develop from PPS, which is considered one type of "postcardiac injury" syndrome.61

## **2. Presentation**

- **a.** Acute hemorrhage will present with refractory hypotension and the clinical picture of acute cardiac tamponade.
- **b.** Acute pericarditis may cause chest discomfort, but in the early postoperative period may be indistinguishable from the pain of a sternotomy incision.
- **c.** The classic picture of delayed tamponade is a low output state manifest by malaise, shortness of breath, chest discomfort, anorexia, nausea, or a low‐grade fever. These symptoms are frequently ascribed to medications or simply a slow recovery from surgery. Jugular venous distention, a pericardial rub, progressive orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia (often masked by use of β‐blockers), and a pulsus paradoxus are often noted. Occasionally, the first sign is a decrease in urine output with a rise in the BUN and creatinine caused by progressive renal dysfunction from the low output state, arterial hypotension, and systemic venous hypertension.

## **3. Evaluation**

- **a.** A chest x‐ray may reveal enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, but this may be attributed to obtaining an AP portable film during a poor inspiratory effort. However, the chest x‐ray is often normal, depending on the site and rapidity of blood accumulation.
- **b.** Two‐dimensional echocardiography can identify the pericardial effusion, confirm tamponade physiology (>40% inspiratory increase in tricuspid valve flow and >25% inspiratory decrease in mitral valve flow), and also assess the status of ventricular function. It is important to recognize that tamponade may be caused by selective compression of individual cardiac chambers, often by small effusions, and not necessarily by large circumferential effusions.57,62 **A transthoracic echocardiogram often has limitations in obtaining certain acoustic windows**, which may be related to the patient's body habitus. Thus, it will occasionally not identify an effusion.
- **c.** If the clinical suspicion remains high and transthoracic imaging is suboptimal, CT scanning can be used to identify and localize a significant effusion. This is useful in patients who are several days out from surgery, hemodynamically stable, and on the postoperative floor.63 However, in unstable patients and those in the ICU, a **transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE)** is preferable and is more sensitive than a TTE in detecting posterior fluid collections (Figure 13.1).64

#### **4. Prevention**

- **a.** Stopping antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications at the appropriate time prior to surgery should not be overlooked.
- **b.** Meticulous attention to obtaining hemostasis at the conclusion of surgery is essential to minimize the risk of bleeding, the use of blood products, and the development of a coagulopathy that may lead to delayed tamponade.

**Figure 13.1 •** Two‐dimensional echocardiograms of significant postoperative pericardial effusions. (A) A transthoracic study in the parasternal long‐axis view demonstrating a significant posterior effusion. (B) A transesophageal study in the transgastric short‐axis view. Note the circumferential pericardial effusion that prevents adequate ventricular filling. Evidence of diastolic collapse will confirm the hemodynamic significance of the effusion.

- **c.** Performance of a small posterior pericardiotomy incision at the conclusion of surgery reduces the incidence of posterior pericardial effusions.65 It is also likely that placing one of the mediastinal tubes below the heart, rather than two tubes anteriorly, might improve drainage and reduce the incidence of residual effusions.
- **d.** Chest tubes can be removed when drainage for the preceding eight hours is <100 mL. One study found that leaving chest tubes in at least until the second postoperative day and removing them only after the drainage was <50 mL/4h more than halved the incidence of delayed tamponade.66

- **e.** Early initiation of anticoagulation following valvular heart surgery, for VTE prophylaxis, or for the management of AF always requires careful judgment as to whether the patient might be at higher risk for mediastinal bleeding and the development of delayed tamponade.
- **f.** Prophylactic use of NSAIDs may reduce the incidence of postoperative pericardial effusions.67 A number of medications have been successful in reducing the risk of postoperative PPS (see next section), but none can be recommended for routine use for that purpose. However, colchicine, anti‐inflammatory medications and/or steroids might be utilized in treating effusions due to pericarditis or PPS which have not produced hemodynamic compromise.
- **g.** Remove pacing wires only in patients who are not therapeutically anticoagulated.

## **5. Treatment**

- **a.** Emergency mediastinal exploration is indicated for active bleeding. If the patient is bleeding massively and/or is very unstable, this should be performed in the ICU or even at the bedside on the postoperative floor with equipment available in an "open chest kit". If the patient can be stabilized, but there is suspicion of an active bleeding source, transferring the patient to the operating room for re‐exploration is preferable.
- **b.** Pericardiocentesis is the least invasive means of draining a progressively enlarging effusion and is effective in about 50% of cases, usually when the effusion is anterior or circumferential.56,57 This is usually performed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory under ECG or two‐dimensional echocardiographic guidance. This will not be completely effective if the blood has clotted with loculated strands.
- **c.** Subxiphoid exploration should be considered when the echocardiogram suggests that the fluid collection cannot be successfully approached percutaneously (usually a posterior collection) or when it is loculated. If this approach is ineffective in draining the effusion, the entire sternal incision may need to be opened.
- **d.** A pericardial "window" or limited pericardiectomy through a left thoracotomy approach can be considered for loculated posterior effusions or recurrent effusions several weeks after surgery.
- **H. Postpericardiotomy syndrome** (PPS) has been reported in 10–20% of patients following open‐heart surgery and is considered to represent an autoimmune inflammatory response to injury, often associated with the occurrence of perioperative bleeding and the requirement for blood transfusions.68,69 It is associated with an elevation in inflammatory markers, including cytokines, markers of neutrophil activation, and oxidative stress mediators.70 It is one of several forms of "postcardiac injury" syndrome which may also occur after pacemaker implantation, PCI, transmural myocardial infarctions, or radiofrequency arrhythmia ablation, presumably as a response to cardiac injury.61 It may occur within the first week of surgery or several weeks to months later and appears to have a different etiology than the pericarditis and pericardial effusions noted early after surgery. The development of PPS may contribute to cardiac tamponade, early vein graft closure, or constrictive pericarditis.71
  - **1.** Risk factors for PPS include younger age, nondiabetics, CKD, lower hematocrits or platelet counts preoperatively (which most likely accounts for more perioperative

- bleeding and the need for transfusions), and valve or aortic surgery.68,69,72 A low preoperative level of interleukin‐8 is a high‐risk marker for its development.73
- **2. Presentation.** Fever, pleuritic chest pain, a pericardial friction rub, or a new or worsening pleural or pericardial effusion may be present, with the diagnosis of PPS being made if two or more of these are present. Malaise and arthralgias may also be present.
- **3. Prevention.** Colchicine (1 g bid × 1 day, then 0.5 mg bid × 1 month) started after surgery has seen the most promise in preventing PPS.74,75 The efficacy of prophylactic intraoperative steroids is uncertain76 – one study showing a benefit of methyprednisolone77 and another showing no benefit of dexamethasone.78 Diclofenac (representative of the NSAIDs) has also been effective in reducing the occurrence of postoperative PPS.79
- **4. Evaluation.** Lymphocytosis, eosinophilia, and an elevated ESR are noted, but a fever work‐up is negative. Effusions are usually demonstrable by chest x‐ray and echocardiography.

#### **5. Treatment**

- **a.** The best initial treatment for PPS is a combination of aspirin (750 mg tid × 2 weeks) and colchicine (0.5 mg bid × 6 months), given with a PPI.61 If there is minimal symptomatic relief or as an alternative to aspirin, a one‐ to two‐week course of an NSAID, such as ibuprofen 600 mg tid, can be given with cessation of aspirin. It should be noted that the regular use of NSAIDs (especially ibuprofen) may inhibit the cardioprotective antiplatelet effect of aspirin.80
- **b.** For patients with recurrent PPS, a one‐month tapering course of prednisolone starting with 0.5 mg/kg daily can be added to the regimen of colchicine and aspirin.61
- **c.** Colchicine (0.5 mg bid × 1 month) is recommended for the treatment of acute and recurrent pericarditis.75,81
- **d.** Pericardiocentesis may be necessary to drain a large symptomatic pericardial effusion.
- **e.** Pericardiectomy is recommended for recurrent large effusions or constriction, which is more common in younger patients with the early onset of PPS.
- **I. Constrictive pericarditis** is a late complication of cardiac surgery that is extremely uncommon despite the development of adhesions that form within the mediastinum following surgery. It has been noted in patients with undrained early postoperative hemopericardium, use of warfarin, early PPS, and previous mediastinal radiation, yet has also developed in the absence of any of these factors. It has been theorized that residual blood and proinflammatory conditions in the pericardium may contribute to the formation of both PPS and later the formation of dense adhesions that more readily cause thickening of the epicardium. This may produce ventricular constriction ("constrictive epicarditis") and also result in graft failure.70,82
  - **1. Presentation.** The patient will note the insidious onset of dyspnea on exertion, chest pain, and fatigue. Signs of right‐heart failure (peripheral edema, ascites, and jugular venous distention) are common, but pulsus paradoxus is infrequent.

#### **2. Evaluation**

- **a.** The chest x‐ray is frequently normal in the absence of a pericardial effusion.
- **b.** Two‐dimensional echocardiography will demonstrate signs of constriction, such as septal bounce and diminished respiratory variation in the inferior vena cava.

- **c.** A CT or preferably an MRI scan usually documents a thickened pericardium, with delayed enhancement on MRI and occasionally a small pericardial effusion. However, in cases of constrictive epicarditis, pericardial thickening may not be seen.
- **d.** Right‐heart catheterization provides the most definitive information. It will document the equilibration of diastolic pressures and demonstrate a diastolic dip‐and‐plateau pattern ("square‐root" sign) in the right ventricular pressure tracing (see Figure 1.32). On occasion, significant fluid overload will produce hemodynamics consistent with constriction, when in fact there is no anatomic evidence of a thickened pericardium or epicarditis other than standard postoperative scarring.
- **3. Treatment.** If there is no clinical response to diuretics and steroids, a pericardiectomy is indicated to decorticate the heart. This is best performed through a sternotomy incision, which allows for adequate decortication of the right atrium and ventricle and much of the left ventricle. It also allows for the institution of CPB in the event of a difficult or bloody operation. Relief of epicardial constriction is difficult and may result in surgical damage to bypass grafts or significant bleeding. A "waffle" or "turtle shell" procedure is performed with crisscrossing incisions made in the epicardial scar to relieve the constriction.82 Results are suboptimal when there is poor LV systolic function, higher RV and LV diastolic pressures, persistent impaired diastolic filling, which correlates with the duration of symptoms prior to surgery, and when significant tricuspid regurgitation is present, which usually will not improve with pericardiectomy alone.

## **VI. Renal, Metabolic, and Fluid Management and Complications**

## **A. Routine care**

- **1.** Most patients are still substantially above their preoperative weight when transferred to the postoperative floor. Comparison of the patient's preoperative weight with daily weights obtained postoperatively is a guide to the use of diuretics to eliminate excess fluid. Achievement of dry body weight may require more aggressive diuresis if heart failure (HF) was present before surgery. In the chronically ill patient, preoperative weight may be achieved after several days despite fluid overload, due to poor nutrition.
- **2.** Dietary restriction (sodium and water) need not be overly strict in most cases. With the availability of potent diuretics to achieve negative fluid balance and the common problem of a poor appetite after surgery, it is more important to provide palatable food without restriction to improve the patient's caloric intake.
- **3.** If a patient required diuretics before surgery (especially valve patients and those with poor myocardial function), it is advisable to continue them upon discharge from the hospital even if preoperative weight has been attained.
- **B. Transient renal failure** (see also Chapter 12). Patients with preoperative renal dysfunction, hypertension and diabetes, prolonged pump runs, postoperative low cardiac output syndromes, or those requiring substantial doses of vasopressors may develop postoperative AKI. Although diuretics are routinely used to reduce the immediate postoperative fluid overload, they have to be used with caution in patients developing

- AKI. They do not influence the course of AKI and can in fact exacerbate renal dysfunction by causing prerenal azotemia from intravascular volume depletion. Management can be very difficult on the postoperative floor when methods of monitoring intravascular volume are limited.
- **1.** A common scenario with mild AKI is gradual elevation in serum creatinine (SCr) with or without elevation in the BUN, along with a low serum sodium, reflective of persistent total body water overload. Oliguria may improve and AKI may be transient with adjustment of medications. Antihypertensive medications should be reduced to allow the normally hypertensive patient's blood pressure to rise to higher levels than normal. ACE inhibitors should be withheld, NSAIDs avoided, and diuretics used gently, if at all, to maintain adequate intravascular volume. If the patient was aggressively diuresed and has a poor appetite, additional hydration may be necessary to address prerenal azotemia which will elevate the BUN. In most patients, renal dysfunction is transient as long as the cardiac output remains satisfactory.
- **2.** If a rising SCr is associated with significant fluid retention, compromise of pulmonary function with oxygen desaturation often results. A high dose of diuretics may improve urine output to address this problem even if it does not directly promote renal recovery. If not successful, the patient may need to return to the ICU for more invasive monitoring and possibly use of intravenous inotropic support, more aggressive noninvasive or even mechanical ventilation, and ultrafiltration or dialysis if renal dysfunction is significant. **A rising BUN and creatinine of unclear etiology, especially when associated with new‐onset oliguria, should always raise the suspicion of delayed tamponade.** An echocardiogram should be performed to assess myocardial function and look for possible cardiac tamponade.
- **C. Hyperkalemia** usually occurs in association with renal dysfunction. Its manifestations and treatment are discussed on pages 708–711. Particular attention should be directed to stopping any exogenous potassium intake, ACE inhibitors ARBs, and NSAIDs, and reevaluating renal function.
- **D. Hyperglycemia** in diabetics, and occasionally in nondiabetics, is a common postoperative problem. The blood glucose level may be elevated due to insulin resistance and residual elevation of the counterregulatory hormones (glucagon, cortisol) after surgery.83 Adequate, but not overly stringent, control of blood glucose during the early postoperative period with an IV insulin protocol has been shown to reduce not only the incidence of wound infection but also other morbidities and operative mortality (see Appendix 6).84–87 Once the patient is transferred to the floor, frequent fingersticks should be obtained (usually before meals and at bedtime) to assess the adequacy of blood glucose control.
  - **1.** Insulin resistance is commonly noted during the early postoperative period. Insulin‐dependent diabetics should have their insulin doses gradually increased back to preoperative levels depending on oral intake and blood glucose levels. It is preferable to use a lower dose of intermediate‐acting insulin initially and supplement it with regular insulin as necessary (see Table 12.9, page 721, for commonly used insulin preparations).
  - **2.** Oral hypoglycemics can be restarted once the patient has an adequate oral intake, usually starting at half the preoperative dose, and increasing the dose depending on oral intake and blood glucose.

**E.** Other electrolyte and endocrine complications are fairly unusual once the patient has been transferred to the postoperative floor. Chapter 12 discusses the evaluation and management of some of these problems.

## **VII. Hematologic Complications and Anticoagulation Regimens**

## **A. Anemia**

- **1.** Despite the obligatory hemodilution associated with use of CPB, effective blood conservation strategies and performance of off‐pump surgery have reduced the requirements for perioperative blood transfusions. Although the STS guidelines recommend transfusion for a hemoglobin (Hb) <6 g/dL on CPB in low‐risk patients,88 such a restrictive strategy may increase the risk of renal failure, stroke, and neurocognitive dysfunction, and should not be applied to patients who are elderly, diabetic, have cerebrovascular disease, or are at risk for end‐organ ischemia.
- **2.** Most studies recommend maintaining a HCT above 20% on CPB and then at least 22% postoperatively. Multiple studies comparing a liberal (transfuse for a Hb <7 g/dL) and restrictive (transfuse for a Hb <9 g/dL) strategy after cardiac surgery have shown comparable outcomes.89,90 However, transfusion to a higher hematocrit postoperatively may be considered for elderly patients, those who feel significantly weak and fatigued, and those with ECG changes, hypotension, or significant tachycardia.
- **3.** Although the HCT may rise gradually with postoperative diuresis, it frequently will not as fluid is mobilized into the bloodstream from extracellular tissues. Furthermore, the HCT may be influenced by the shortened red cell lifespan caused by extracorporeal circulation and the loss of 30% of transfused red cells within 24 hours of transfusion. In one study, "hemoglobin drift" was noted in virtually all patients, averaging about 1.1 mg/dL, was greater with longer durations of CPB, but was unrelated to whether the patient received a transfusion.91 However, with diuresis, the Hb level improved in nearly 80% of patients prior to discharge, and this concept should be taken into consideration when contemplating a transfusion.
- **4.** Any patient with a HCT <30% should be placed on iron therapy (ferrous sulfate or gluconate 300 mg tid for one month) at the time of discharge. Exogenous iron may not be necessary if the patient has received multiple transfusions, because of the storage of iron from hemolyzed cells.
- **5.** Consideration may also be given to use of recombinant erythropoietin (Epogen or Procrit) to stimulate red cell production (50–100 units/kg SC three times a week), especially in patients with CKD with adequate iron stores (transferrin saturation >20% and ferritin >100 ng/mL).
- **B. Thrombocytopenia** is caused by platelet destruction and hemodilution during extracorporeal circulation, but platelet counts gradually return to normal within several days. Impaired hemostasis noted in the early postoperative period is caused more commonly by platelet dysfunction induced by CPB or use of antiplatelet medications, although it is attenuated somewhat by the use of the antifibrinolytic drugs.

#### **1. Etiology**

- ∙ Platelet activation or dilution during CPB
- ∙ Excessive bleeding and multiple blood transfusions without platelet administration

- ∙ Use of an intra‐aortic balloon pump
- ∙ Heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). **Note**: platelet counts must be monitored on a daily basis in any patient receiving heparin. A falling platelet count after the initial recovery of the platelet count should always raise the specter of HIT and is an indication for *in vitro* aggregation testing to identify HIT.
- ∙ Other medications that may reduce the platelet count, such as furosemide, NSAIDs, and ranitidine
- ∙ Sepsis
- ∙ Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), which is usually characterized by AKI, thrombocytopenia, and a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with schistocytes on blood smear. Occasionally, fever and altered mental status may be present.92
- **2. Treatment.** Platelet transfusions are indicated:
  - **a.** When the platelet count is <20,000–30,000/μL (<20−30 × 109 /L).
  - **b.** For ongoing bleeding when the platelet count is <100,000/μL and sometimes higher if platelet dysfunction is suspected.
  - **c.** For a planned surgical procedure (such as percutaneous IABP removal) when the platelet count is <60,000/μL (<60 × 109 /L).
- **C. Heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)** is a very serious problem that may result in widespread arterial and venous thrombosis, and carries a mortality rate of about 20%. Because of its high risk and the necessity for treatment with direct thrombin inhibitors, early suspicion, identification, and management are essential.93–96
  - **1.** HIT is an immune‐mediated phenomenon caused by the formation of IgG antibodies that bind to the heparin‐platelet factor 4 (PF4) complex, producing platelet activation. This results in release of procoagulant microparticles that lead to thrombin generation. This binding causes release of more PF4, promoting more platelet activation. Antibody binding to glycosaminoglycans on the surface of endothelial cells leads to endothelial cell damage and tissue factor expression. This procoagulant milieu promotes arterial and venous thrombosis in 30–50% of patients and may cause a stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, or deep venous thrombosis.

## **2. Suspicion of the diagnosis**

- **a.** The diagnosis of HIT requires the presence of heparin antibodies and thrombocytopenia. HIT is more common with use of bovine heparin and is 8–10 times more likely to occur with UFH than LMWH.
- **b.** The suspicion of HIT is based on the "four Ts", which include the degree of **T**hrombocytopenia, the **T**iming of its occurrence, the occurrence of **T**hrombotic events, and the likelihood of o**T**her potential causes. One scoring system found that independent risk factors for HIT after CPB were a biphasic response to the platelet count, an interval of >5 days since CPB, and a bypass run exceeding about two hours.97
  - **i.** Thrombocytopenia is extremely common postoperatively and may be related to hemodilution, platelet damage on pump, clearance of transfused platelets, and sepsis. The platelet count is usually reduced about 40% after surgery on CPB, but begins to rebound by the third or fourth day after

- surgery. If the platelet count does not improve after four days or there is a subsequent fall in platelet count >50%, HIT should be suspected.
- **ii.** Although immediate‐onset HIT (occurring within hours of giving heparin) may develop in patients who received heparin within 100 days due to residual circulating HIT antibodies, it is rare for a patient receiving short‐ term preoperative heparin to develop HIT within the first four days after surgery. The general pattern is for HIT to occur 5–14 days after surgery.
- **iii.** Delayed‐onset HIT (occurring after heparin has been discontinued due to the presence of residual heparin‐PF4 platelet‐activating antibodies) is often manifested by venous thromboembolism, and is commonly not diagnosed, because platelet counts are rarely checked after heparin is stopped. If there is evidence of a thrombotic event (such as lower extremity VTE), a low platelet count should raise suspicion of this entity.
- **iv.** It is estimated that 30–50% of patients who develop HIT will develop evidence of thrombosis, mandating additional treatment beyond stopping heparin. Disturbingly, it is estimated that 25% of patients may develop thrombosis before developing thrombocytopenia.98 Thus, HIT can be a very difficult management problem because of the temptation to administer heparin for a thrombotic event when it might be contraindicated. More commonly, however, patients will develop thrombosis as the platelet count is falling and reaching its nadir, but, as noted, it may occur even after the heparin has been stopped (delayed‐onset HIT). Thus, there are clinical scenarios when HIT may be present but the suspicion is low, leading to complications from delayed recognition and management.
  - **v.** Other potential causes, especially medications, use of an IABP, and sepsis should be considered as possible causes of thrombocytopenia.
- **3. Diagnostic testing.** ELISA serologic testing for IgG specific heparin‐dependent platelet antibodies has replaced prior testing that also detected non‐HIT‐causing IgM antibodies. Such testing was positive in about 20% of preoperative and in up to 50% of postoperative cardiac surgical patients, but was uncommonly associated with thromboembolic events.94,99–102 It is estimated that only 1–2% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery will develop HIT. Use of optical densities (ODs) with ELISA testing and antibody titers may be helpful in improving specificity as well, since most cases of HIT are associated with an OD >1.4 units.95 More specific functional assays of washed platelet activation (serotonin release assay and heparin‐induced platelet aggregation studies) are able to more accurately identify antibodies that trigger platelet activation. Preoperative testing for heparin antibodies is not recommended in the absence of thrombocytopenia or thrombosis.

#### **4. Management95,102,103**

**a.** If HIT is identified preoperatively with positive testing and thrombocytopenia, an alternative method of anticoagulation (usually bivalirudin) must be used during surgery (see Chapter 4, pages 251–253). Antibodies generally clear within three months of the last heparin administration, and heparinization can be performed safely if HIT testing is negative.

- **b.** With any suspicion of postoperative HIT, even before testing results become available, **all heparin administration must be stopped**. This includes cessation of heparin flushes and removal of heparin‐coated pulmonary artery catheters. However, if the likelihood of HIT is low based upon clinical grounds, yet an anticoagulant is indicated for prophylaxis (such as for VTE), fondaparinux 5–10 mg qd SC (weight‐based) can be given safely.
- **c.** Platelets should not be routinely administered, because they may promote thrombosis, but may be considered if the patient is bleeding or to prevent bleeding if the platelet count is very low (<30,000). The platelet count generally begins to increase within about a week after cessation of heparin.
- **d.** Warfarin should **not** be started immediately, because tissue necrosis from microvascular thrombosis may occur due to depletion of the vitamin‐K‐dependent natural anticoagulant protein C. This has been noted in patients who rapidly develop a supratherapeutic INR. Warfarin may be started safely after the platelet count reaches 150 × 109 /L and should overlap the nonheparin anticoagulant for five days, even when the INR is in therapeutic range.
- **e.** Alternative anticoagulation is indicated to minimize the risk of thrombotic events and also to provide protection for the process for which the heparin was originally indicated. This is essential because the risk of symptomatic thrombosis remains greater than 25% if only the heparin is stopped.
  - **i. Argatroban** is a synthetic direct thrombin inhibitor that is preferred in patients with renal dysfunction because it undergoes hepatic metabolism. It has a plasma half‐life of about 40 minutes. It is given starting at a dose of 2 μg/kg/min once heparin effect has been eliminated (usually four hours for UFH and 12 hours after the last dose of LMWH), and maintained at a rate of 0.5–1.2 μg/kg/min and adjusted to maintain a PTT of 1.5–3 times baseline. Lower doses are recommended in patients with liver disease or heart failure. Conversion from argatroban to warfarin can be somewhat problematic because both affect the INR. Warfarin should be started once the platelet count exceeds 150 × 109 and is given in doses of 2.5–5 mg for five days of overlapping treatment. At that point, the usual protocol is to stop the argatroban if the INR is >4 and recheck an INR in four hours. If the new INR is >2, it does not need to be restarted; if it is <2, the argatroban should be restarted. However, it has been noted that even when the INR is >4, the risk of thrombosis may still exceed the risk of bleeding.104
  - **ii. Bivalirudin** is a direct thrombin inhibitor that produces reversible binding to thrombin and has a short half‐life of only 25 minutes. It can be used for the management of HIT with an initial bolus of 0.75 mg/kg followed by an infusion of 0.15 mg/kg/h to achieve a target PTT of 1.5–2.5 times baseline. Advantages include 80% enzymatic metabolism (although some modification is indicated in patients with a GFR <30 mL/min), non‐immunogenicity, and minimal effect on the INR.
  - **iii. Danaparoid** is a heparinoid that has a low degree of reactivity with heparin antibodies. It is given in a bolus dose of 2250 anti‐Xa units, followed by 400 units/h × 4 hours, then 300 units/h × 4 hours, then a maintenance infusion of 200 units/h. It is monitored by anti‐Xa levels, trying to achieve

- a level of 0.5–0.8 units/mL. It is available from Aspen Pharmacare, but is not available in the USA.
- **iv.** Non‐vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have had limited evaluation in the management of HIT, but may be considered off‐label as alternative medications using the doses recommended for acute VTE (see section IV.E, pages 750–752).
- **v.** Duration of antithrombotic therapy is generally one month without and three months with the occurrence of a thrombotic event.
- **D. Coronary bypass surgery.** Postoperative aspirin should be utilized to increase saphenous vein graft patency, although there is no documented benefit in improving the patency of arterial conduits.52
  - **1.** Class I recommendations for antiplatelet therapy after CABG in most guidelines (American College of Chest Physicians [ACCP], American College of Cardiology/ American Heart Association [ACC/AHA], the European Society of Cardiology [ESC], and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons [STS]) are to start aspirin in doses ranging from 75 mg to 325 mg starting 6–24 hours after surgery and to also prescribe clopidogrel 75 mg after OPCAB.105–108 The use of higher doses of aspirin may offset the increase in platelet reactivity and the decreased absorption of aspirin noted postoperatively.23 Non‐enteric‐coated aspirin has better absorption and is recommended. The timing of initiation of therapy may be influenced by the degree of postoperative mediastinal bleeding. It is recommended to continue aspirin indefinitely due to its benefits in the secondary prevention of coronary disease, although it may not influence graft patency when used beyond one year.
  - **2.** Class IIa recommendations are to prescribe dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor (preferably ticagrelor) in patients who have undergone CABG for an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Several meta‐analyses have suggested that DAPT after CABG for SIHD may reduce vein graft occlusion, with the greatest benefit noted following OPCABs (hence the level I recommendation), although it may be associated with more bleeding.109,110 However, DAPT did not improve cardiovascular outcomes in diabetic patients with multivessel disease undergoing CABG for stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) or an ACS in the FREEDOM trial.111 DAPT is only a class IIb indication following on‐pump CABG per the ACC/AHA guidelines. If the patient is aspirin‐intolerant, clopidogrel should be given with a 300 mg loading dose, followed by 75 mg daily.
  - **3.** DAPT should be resumed after surgery if the patient has received a drug‐eluting stent within the past year and it remains patent.
  - **4.** There is no documented superiority in graft patency comparing aspirin to warfarin or to a NOAC (rivaroxaban) whether used alone or in addition to aspirin.112 Whether one of these might be considered after coronary endarterectomy is not known.
- **E. Prosthetic heart valves.** All patients receiving mechanical heart valves must take a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) indefinitely following surgery, but the guidelines regarding the short‐term use of a VKA after tissue valve replacement provide differing recommendations.113 The following recommendations (summarized in Table 13.5) are a general consensus from the 2012 ACCP,114 2014/2017 ACC/AHA,115 and the 2017 ESC guidelines,116 all of which are updated every few years and are available online. The evolution and comparison of these guidelines are presented in a paper published in 2019.117

## **1. Tissue valves**

- **a. Aortic valves (surgical).** Some reviews have concluded that use of either aspirin or a VKA provides similar outcomes after bioprosthetic AVR, and the slight decrease in thromboembolism and death from the combination of both is offset by an increased risk of bleeding.118 Although surgeons and patients often opt for a tissue valve to avoid a VKA, even for a short period of time, there is some evidence that patients not receiving VKAs are more susceptible to thromboembolic complications during the first three months after implantation, with a slightly increased risk of stroke.119 Furthermore, "subclinical leaflet thrombosis" has been identified on aortic tissue valves implanted surgically or with TAVR and has been associated with an increased risk of stroke after surgical AVR.120
  - **i.** The 2012 ACCP guidelines recommend aspirin 75–100 mg (usually 81 mg) indefinitely if the patient is in sinus rhythm, with the addition of warfarin to achieve a target INR of 2.5 if the patient is at higher risk for thromboembolism (AF, hypercoagulable disorder, EF <35%, previous thromboembolism, or a left atrial dimension >50 mm).114
  - **ii.** The 2017 AHA/ACC guidelines give level IIa indications to the indefinite use of aspirin and to the use of a VKA for 3–6 months with a target INR level of 2.5 if the patient is at low risk for bleeding. However, the guidelines do not specify whether the recommendation is to use either alone or both together. After 3–6 months, only aspirin is recommended unless there is another indication for warfarin.115 New guidelines should be available online towards the end of 2020.
  - **iii.** The 2017 ESC guidelines provide a class IIa indication for use of aspirin and a IIb indication for use of an oral anticoagulant (without concomitant use of aspirin), because the addition of a VKA will increase the bleeding risk despite a lower risk of thromboembolism.116 In contradistinction to the AHA/ACC guidelines, the ESC guidelines do not recommend the indefinite use of aspirin.
  - **iv.** Limited data have shown that a NOAC is noninferior to the use of warfarin in patients with AF and prior bioprosthetic valve replacement or repair. Therefore, it may be feasible to consider use of a NOAC after three months if there is an indication for continuing anticoagulation, such as AF.121
- **b. Aortic valves (TAVR).** Standard protocols following TAVR recommend clopidogrel 75 mg daily for six months and aspirin 81 mg daily indefinitely. For patients who are at high risk for bleeding on DAPT, there are data showing that outcomes are comparable with mono and dual antiplatelet therapy.118,122,123 For a patient in AF, either a VKA or a NOAC is used and may be combined with one antiplatelet medication, but not both.
  - **i.** Concerns about subclinical leaflet thrombosis causing an increased gradient across the valve and an increased risk of stroke have raised the question as to whether a VKA should be used in these patients. This has received an ACC/ AHA level IIb indication in patients at low risk for bleeding.115 This is probably less of an issue in elderly patients in whom anticoagulation is more dangerous, but may be applicable to younger, lower‐risk patients undergoing TAVR.
  - **ii.** A NOAC with aspirin cannot be recommended as an alternative approach based on the GALILEO study, which found a higher risk of bleeding, thromboembolism, and death with rivaroxaban + aspirin compared with clopidogrel + aspirin in patients with no other indication for anticoagulation.124 However, this study did not assess whether use of a NOAC alone might reduce subclinical leaflet thrombosis without increasing risks compared with warfarin or DAPT in patients without AF.

- **c. Mitral valves.** Warfarin should be started by the first postoperative day and given along with aspirin (ACC/AHA guidelines level IIa) for 3–6 months to achieve a target INR of 2.5 (range 2.0–3.0). ESC guidelines provide a IIa recommendation for three months of a VKA without aspirin. The initiation of heparin can be considered in the hospital before the INR reaches the target level. The patient can then be discharged on LMWH until the INR reaches the therapeutic range. After three months, warfarin is stopped and aspirin 75–100 mg (usually 81 mg) is given if the patient is in sinus rhythm. However, warfarin should be continued indefinitely in patients at high thromboembolic risk, and aspirin should be added to the regimen. NOACs may be feasible after three months in patients with AF.113,121
- **d. Mitral rings.** The benefit of using a VKA rather than aspirin after mitral valve repair is not clear. ACCP guidelines recommend aspirin alone if the patient is in sinus rhythm, whereas the ACC/AHA and ESC guidelines recommend use of a VKA for three months. This conclusion is based primarily on evidence that about 30% of patients discharged in sinus rhythm will experience AF shortly thereafter, but is not based upon thromboembolic risk from the prosthetic ring. However, some studies suggest that aspirin alone may be sufficient.125
- **2. Mechanical valves.** Based on the RE‐ALIGN study published in 2013, dabigatran, and inferentially the factor Xa inhibitor NOACs, are contraindicated as anticoagulants in patients receiving mechanical valves.126
  - **a. Aortic valves.** Current‐generation bileaflet valves (Abbott St. Jude, Medtronic ATS) should receive warfarin indefinitely starting by the day after surgery to achieve a target INR of 2.5 (range 2.0–3.0). In patients with older valves, which carry higher thromboembolic risk (Starr‐Edwards or Bjork‐Shiley valves), and in patients with double mechanical valves, the target INR should be 3.0 (range 2.5–3.5). The ESC guidelines recommend increasing the target INR by 0.5 if the risk factors noted in section 1.a.i on page 771 are present. The target INR for On‐X aortic valves is also 2.5, but may be lowered to 1.5–2 after three months.
  - **b. Mitral valves.** Patients should receive warfarin indefinitely starting by the day after surgery to achieve a target INR of 3.0 (range 2.5–3.5).
  - **c.** The ACC/AHA and ACCP guidelines recommend the addition of aspirin 75–100 mg daily to warfarin for all patients receiving mechanical valves. Because the evidence supporting this recommendation is weak and the risk of bleeding is unequivocally increased, the ESC recommends the addition of aspirin only if vascular disease, coronary stenting, or recurrent embolism is present.116,117
- **3.** In patients receiving mechanical valves or those in AF receiving tissue mitral valves, there is a potentially increased risk of early postoperative thromboembolism when the patient is not therapeutically anticoagulated. Therefore, use of heparin is recommended until the INR becomes therapeutic. However, the timing of initiation of heparin as a bridge is not well defined and must be individualized. Although some groups advocate initiating heparinization as early as the first postoperative day, this may increase the risk of bleeding. A safe approach is to initiate UFH or LMWH on the fourth or fifth postoperative day if the INR is less than 1.8. It is recommended that either of these be continued until the INR has been therapeutic for two days. The ESC recommends antifactor Xa monitoring if LMWH is used to ensure adequate anticoagulation.

- **F. Dosing and overanticoagulation.** Warfarin is a dangerous drug that requires thoughtful administration and careful monitoring to avoid overanticoagulation.127
  - **1.** Initiation of warfarin results in the more rapid depletion of factors VII, IX, and X than factor II (prothrombin), which has a longer half‐life. Thus, it exhibits an antihemostatic effect before it achieves an antithrombotic effect, the latter being attributable primarily to a reduction in factor II. Following cardiac surgery, it is essential that warfarin not be loaded and that doses be carefully individualized to avoid rapid overanticoagulation. An initial dose of 5 mg is given to most patients. However, 2.5 mg should be given to small elderly women, patients with hepatic dysfunction, chronic illness, and those receiving antibiotics or amiodarone (Table 13.6). The INR generally begins to rise in 2–3 days, but often takes 5–7 days to achieve a stable dosing level.

## **Table 13.6 • Protocol for Initiation of Warfarin Doses**

**Assess whether patient is at greater risk for sensitivity to warfarin – if so, use low‐ dose protocol**

- 1. Small, elderly females
- 2. Over age 75

<sup>\*</sup>Restart warfarin when INR is less than 3.0 WNL, within normal limits

- 2. Potential dangers of overanticoagulation include cardiac tamponade from intrapericardial bleeding, and gastrointestinal (GI), intracranial, or retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Although there are antithrombotic benefits to the combined use of warfarin and aspirin, which is generally recommended for valve patients, this combination does increase the long-term risk of bleeding for patients with a variety of indications for anticoagulation. <sup>128</sup> An ACC expert consensus pathway was written in 2017 for the management of bleeding related to oral anticoagulation. <sup>127</sup> A brief protocol for the management of overanticoagulation with warfarin is noted in Figure 13.2 and in Appendix 9.
- 3. If the patient has significant bleeding with a markedly elevated INR, warfarin should be held, and fresh frozen plasma (up to 15 mL/kg) should be given. Vitamin K 5–10 mg IV in 50 mL NS over 30 minutes should be given and may be repeated every 12 hours for persistent INR elevation. Use of four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC) 25–50 units/kg (approximately 1000–1500 units) or recombinant factor VIIa 40 μg/kg may also be considered.
- **4.** If the patient has no evidence of bleeding, general recommendations for management of elevated INRs are as follows, although rapid elevation of the INR in the early postoperative period may warrant more aggressive therapy.
  - a. INR  $\geq$ 9: hold warfarin, give vitamin K 2.5–5 mg orally (INR should fall within 24–48 hours)
  - **b.** INR ≥5 and <9: hold warfarin for 1–2 days and restart when INR is <4; alternatively, omit one dose of warfarin and give 1–2.5 mg of vitamin K orally
  - **c.** INR above therapeutic range but ≤5: lower or omit one dose until at therapeutic range

- **5.** Vitamin K given in small oral doses can reduce the INR to a therapeutic level within a few days and is usually the best approach when withholding warfarin does not reduce the INR. Use of large doses of IV vitamin K will produce more rapid reversal of the INR, but it is associated with a small risk of anaphylaxis. It may also lead to warfarin resistance and generally should be avoided. If the INR becomes subtherapeutic (which is usually safer than a markedly elevated INR), heparin can always be given until the INR rises back to the therapeutic range. In patients on long‐term warfarin with variable INR responses, concomitant administration of vitamin K 100–200 μg/day orally helps stabilize the INR.129,130
- **6.** For patients taking a NOAC, bleeding can be addressed using reversal agents:
  - **a.** For dabigatran, give idarucizumab 5 g IV (Praxbind); if not available, give 4F‐ PCC 25–50 units/kg.
  - **b.** For factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban, rivaroxaban), give recombinant factor Xa (andexanet alpha) (Andexxa) 400–800 mg at 30 mg/min. If not available, give 4F‐PCC 25–50 units/kg.
  - **c.** Prothrombin complex concentrates contains the vitamin‐K‐dependent coagulation factors II, IX, and X (so‐called three‐factor PCC [Profilnine]) and may contain variable amounts of factor VII (four‐factor PCC [Kcentra].
  - **d.** Another product called FEIBA (anti‐inhibitor coagulant complex or activated PCC) may be the best product to control bleeding. This contains nonactivated factors II, IX, and X, activated factor VII, factor VIII inhibitor bypassing activity, and some factor VIII coagulant antigen. It is usually given in a dose of 500–1000 units.

## **VIII. Wound Care and Infectious Complications**

## **A. General Comments**

- **1.** Prophylactic antibiotics are indicated prior to cardiac surgical procedures to minimize the risk of postoperative mediastinitis. A first‐generation cephalosporin is usually chosen (cefazolin), although there is some evidence that a second‐generation drug (cefuroxime) may be more effective.131 Vancomycin is substituted if there is a penicillin allergy and is commonly selected for patients undergoing valve or graft placement because of its effectiveness against Gram‐ positive organisms. The STS guidelines give a level IIb recommendation to give an antibiotic providing Gram‐negative coverage (gentamicin) when vancomycin is used, although this is not common practice, and many groups just use cefazolin along with vancomycin to accomplish that. Antibiotics are started within one hour (cephalosporins) or two hours (vancomycin) of surgery and continued for 24–48 hours. They should not be continued any longer even if invasive lines and catheters remain in place.132,133
- **2.** Wounds closed with subcuticular sutures and covered with 2‐octyl cyanoacrylate adhesive (Dermabond) at the conclusion of surgery do not require dressing coverage. Closed incision negative pressure wound management systems (PREVENA, KCI) applied to a sternotomy wound should be left in place for 5–7 days. If neither of the above is used, the wound should be cleansed and covered with a dressing every day for the first three postoperative days. Subsequent coverage is not necessary unless drainage is noted. All drainage should be cultured and sterile occlusive dressings applied.

- **B. Nosocomial infections** develop in 5–10% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery using CPB. Most infections involve the urinary or respiratory tracts, central IV catheters, or the surgical site. Infections are less common in patients undergoing OPCAB, presumably because of the reduced necessity for blood transfusions and the absence of the immunomodulatory effects of extracorporeal circulation.134,135 A nosocomial infection not only increases the length of stay but also significantly increases operative mortality (to about 20%) because of the frequent development of multisystem organ failure.135–137 *Staphylococcus* is the most common organism noted in bacteremia and wound infections, whereas Gram‐negative infections are more common in the respiratory tract. The high mortality rates of mediastinitis (about 20–25%) and septicemia (30–50%) do not differ much between patients with methicillin‐resistant *S. aureus* (MRSA) and other organisms.138
  - **1. Risk factors** have been identified in multiple studies, most of which are included in the STS risk model for major infection shown in Figure 13.3.139,140 To a large degree, these overlap the risk factors for major mediastinal infections noted on pages 778–779.
    - **a.** Comorbidities: older age, females, diabetes, obesity
    - **b.** Nasal carriage of *S. aureus*, which is associated with a significant incidence of postoperative MRSA infections (about 20%) with a mortality risk of 15–30%.141,142

- **c.** Operative factors: long complex operations, urgent/emergent surgery, reoperations, use of an IABP
- **d.** Postoperative factors (with specific relationships in parentheses)
  - ∙ Hyperglycemia (wound infections)
  - ∙ Prolonged duration of intubation or need for reintubation (pneumonia). The overall risk of ventilator‐associated pneumonia is 5–8%, but it has been estimated to be >50% in patients intubated over 48 hours.143
  - ∙ Prolonged duration of indwelling Foley catheter (UTI), with the risk of bacteriuria increasing 3–8%/day of catheter usage.144
  - ∙ Prolonged duration of central venous catheter placement (bacteremia). Central venous catheters with multiple lumens and those changed over guidewires increase the risk of bacteremia.145,146
  - ∙ Blood transfusions (pneumonia)
  - ∙ Reoperation for bleeding
  - ∙ Empiric use of broad‐spectrum antibiotics
  - ∙ Low cardiac output syndromes
  - ∙ Postoperative stroke
  - ∙ Early development of postoperative renal failure
- **2. Preventative measures** that may reduce the incidence of nosocomial infections include:
  - **a.** Perioperative use of intranasal mupirocin to reduce staphylococcal nasal carriage. Although selective use in carriers is most appropriate and can be accomplished using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assessment, this is not always logistically possible and is not cost‐effective, so it is easier to treat all patients as soon as possible before surgery and for 3–5 days postoperatively.147–149
  - **b.** Chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12% (Peridex) oral rinse has been shown to reduce the rate of nosocomial respiratory infections, wound infections, and mortality.150
  - **c.** Use of a hyperglycemia protocol to maintain early postoperative blood glucose <180 mg/dL.
  - **d.** Early removal of invasive catheters, especially central lines.
  - **e.** Strict adherence to guidelines to avoid prolonged usage of prophylactic antibiotics.133 One study showed that early postoperative pneumonia was usually caused by organisms that colonized the respiratory tract prior to surgery. However, prolonged use of antibiotics was ineffective in reducing the incidence of pneumonia.151
  - **f.** Aggressive ventilatory weaning protocols to reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and other steps to avoid ventilator‐associated pneumonia (see pages 492–493).
  - **g.** Raising the threshold for blood transfusions (transfuse only for a HCT <22% unless clinically indicated).89,90
- **3.** The **treatment** of a nosocomial infection requires appropriate antibiotic selection for the organism involved and recognition of the appropriate time course of treatment. Prolonged treatment is often unnecessary and may lead to the development of resistant strains or fungal infections, and not infrequently to hepatic or renal dysfunction. When a Gram‐positive bacteremia occurs in a

patient with a prosthetic heart valve, a six‐week course of treatment for presumed endocarditis may be indicated. In complex situations, infectious disease consultation is essential.

## **C. Sepsis**

- **1. Clinical features.** Sepsis resulting in hemodynamic compromise and multisystem organ failure is an uncommon, yet highly lethal, complication of cardiac surgery, with an estimated mortality rate of greater than 30%.152,153 It is usually noted in critically ill patients who remain in the ICU with multiple invasive monitoring lines, develop respiratory complications, and often have some element of renal dysfunction. It may be the first manifestation of an occult sternal wound infection.
- **2. Management.** Basic principles of hemodynamic and ICU management should be initiated early to try to reduce the high mortality rate associated with sepsis. These should include:
  - **a.** Optimization of hemodynamics with fluid resuscitation, inotropic support, and selective use of vasoconstrictors (initially α‐agents, and then vasopressin, if necessary). This should be assessed by adequate hemodynamic monitoring (PA catheter and central or mixed venous oxygen saturations), aiming for an oxygen saturation >70%.
  - **b.** Initiation of broad‐spectrum antibiotic coverage after panculturing with prompt modification to cover the specific organism isolated
  - **c.** Low tidal volume ventilation if ARDS develops; minimizing sedation to promote early extubation
  - **d.** Early aggressive use of renal replacement therapies (CVVH)
  - **e.** Maintaining the blood glucose <180 mg/dL
  - **f.** Adequate nutrition, preferably by the enteral route
  - **g.** VTE prophylaxis (pneumatic compression devices, possibly SC heparin)
  - **h.** Stress ulcer prophylaxis (sucralfate, proton pump inhibitors)
  - **i.** Low‐dose stress steroids to be considered in patients with documented inadequate response to an ACTH challenge
- **D. Sternal wound infections (SWI)** complicate about 1% of cardiac surgical procedures performed via a median sternotomy and have been associated with significant hospital mortality (around 20%). Coagulase‐negative staphylococcus and *S. aureus* are the most common pathogens encountered despite the use of prophylactic antibiotics specifically directed at these organisms. An incidence of only 1% is amazingly low when one considers that open‐ heart surgery tends to be performed in the sickest patients with multiple comorbidities, involves the use of CPB, is associated with a high prevalence of transfusions, and entails prolonged wound exposure. Nonetheless, sternal infections remain a major source of physical, emotional, and economic stress when they occur.154
  - **1. Risk factors.** Numerous models have been devised to predict the risk of developing mediastinitis, including that from the STS (available as part of the risk calculator at sts.org). Among the risk factors identified in numerous studies are the following:135,155,156

- **a.** Comorbidities: obesity (BMI >40),157,158 diabetes (elevated HbA1c),159–161 smoking and COPD,162 HF, renal dysfunction, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), older age, impaired nutritional status (low serum albumin),158 use of steroids, and preoperative MRSA colonization142
- **b.** Surgical considerations that increase risk include:
  - **•** Performing hair removal with razors rather than clippers
  - **•** Emergency surgery
  - **•** Reoperations
  - **•** Bilateral ITA usage in diabetics (controversial)163
  - **•** Prolonged duration of CPB or surgery
  - **•** Need for an IABP
  - **•** Use of bone wax164
  - **•** Contaminated heater/cooler units with mycobacterium chimera, which give rise to latent sternal wound infections165
- **c.** Postoperative complications
  - **•** Excessive mediastinal bleeding, re‐exploration for bleeding, multiple transfusions
  - **•** Prolonged ventilatory support (usually in patients with COPD who are actively colonized)
  - **•** Low cardiac output states (cardiogenic shock) with use of an IABP
  - **•** Refractory hyperglycemia in the ICU, independent of whether the patient has a history of diabetes
  - **•** Acute kidney injury
  - **•** Central venous line‐related bacteremia, which increases the risk fivefold145
- **2. Prevention.**154,166 Because of the fairly universal adoption of the basic perioperative measures listed below, the risk of deep SWI in the STS database is about 1% – and this includes a high percentage of patients with multiple risk factors, especially diabetes, obesity, and smoking. The adoption of newer technologies, such as negative pressure management, has generally not been found to be cost‐effective, except perhaps in patients at highest risk for infection.167

#### **a. Preoperative measures**

- ∙ Identify and treat preexisting infections.
- ∙ Advise patients to stop smoking as soon as possible prior to surgery. Although it is suggested that smoking increases the risk of SWI,162 prominent coughing after surgery in such patients also increases the risk of sternal dehiscence.168
- ∙ Optimize diabetic control after initial evaluation of the patient if HbA1C is >7.5.
- ∙ Optimize nutritional status, if possible, in patients with a low serum albumin (<2.5 mg/dL).
- ∙ Chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12% (Peridex) oral rinse.150
- ∙ Chlorhexidine chest and leg wash several times the night before and the morning of surgery to reduce the bacterial skin count.

- ∙ Intranasal mupirocin (Bactroban) given at a minimum the morning of surgery and continuing for five days to reduce nasal carriage of staphylococcal organisms. This is not beneficial in patients who are MRSA negative, but, unless nasal swabs and PCR testing are performed in advance, it is recommended that all patients be treated with intranasal mupirocin.149 Although very effective against MSSA, mupirocin is only 50% effective in decolonizing patients with MRSA. One concern of universal decolonization is not just cost but the potential risk of developing antibiotic resistance.169
- ∙ Hair clipping just prior to surgery
- ∙ Appropriate timing and dosage of weight‐based prophylactic antibiotics:
  - ⚬ Cephalosporins should be given within one hour of surgery. Cefazolin is recommended and should be given in a dose of 2 g to patients <120 kg and 3 g if >120 kg. IV bolus injection achieves a peak plasma concentration within 20 minutes and peak interstitial levels within 60 minutes, so ideally it should be given 20–30 minutes before surgery starts.135 An additional dose should be given on pump or may be repeated in four hours in off‐pump cases.
  - ⚬ Vancomycin is usually selected for patients undergoing valve surgery or placement of prosthetic grafts and may be given as an alternative to cephalosporins in patients who are allergic to penicillin or cephalosporins. It should be started within two hours of surgery, and given in a dose of 20 mg/ kg. Although not common practice, the 2007 STS guidelines gave a level IIb indication for also giving a single preoperative dose of gentamicin, no more than 4 mg/kg, when vancomycin in used for prophylaxis.132
  - ⚬ If there are contraindications to the above antibiotics, daptomycin (6 mg/kg IV) is usually selected.

#### **b. Intraoperative measures**

- ∙ Careful skin prep with chlorhexidine alcohol may be superior to povidone‐iodine (without alcohol).170–172 Any skin preparation can only reduce the bacterial count but cannot sterilize the skin. One study showed that 89% of subcutaneous wound cultures and 98% of adjacent skin cultures were positive just prior to skin closure after cardiac procedures.173
- ∙ Consideration may be given to use of a microbial sealant that immobilizes bacteria (InteguSeal, Halyard Health). In some studies, this reduced the risk of SWI, but in others, it did not.174–176
- ∙ Use of Ioban rather than standard drapes177
- ∙ Ensure a midline sternotomy and provide a secure sternal closure. Some studies suggest that figure‐of‐eight wires or rigid fixation systems are superior to simple cerclage wires in producing sternal stability and reducing the incidence of wound infection, although a meta‐analysis of closure methods found no difference.178–182 Use of Robicsek basket‐weaving sutures may be considered if the sternum is narrow, osteoporotic, or divided off midline.

- ∙ Be selective in the use of bilateral ITAs in diabetic patients. Skeletonizing the ITA may be helpful, but avoidance of bilateral usage in patients with other risk factors, such as severe obesity and COPD, is prudent.163
- ∙ Use meticulous surgical technique with respect for tissues and obtain adequate hemostasis to minimize mediastinal bleeding.
- ∙ Avoid bone wax.
- ∙ Use intravenous insulin to maintain intraoperative blood sugar <180 mg/ dL.
- ∙ Redose cephalosporins after four hours. One study reported that the risk of SWI was greater when the surgical duration approached six hours and there was a low cefazolin plasma concentration (<104 mg/L) during wound closure.183
- ∙ Tolerate a HCT of 20% on pump; use blood products to help with hemostasis only if absolutely necessary.
- ∙ Use subcuticular sutures rather than skin staples and seal wound with a topical adhesive (Dermabond).
- ∙ One study suggested that application of bacitracin over the closed wound (if Dermabond is not used) was successful in virtually eliminating the risk of deep SWI.184
- ∙ Application of platelet-leukocyte rich gel185 and possibly gentamicincollagen sponges to the sternal edges may reduce the risk of deep SWI.171,186–188 Despite remote literature suggesting that vancomycin paste is helpful, a more recent study showed no benefit.189
- ∙ Consider using a negative pressure wound system in patients at high risk of infection. Studies in patients receiving bilateral ITA grafts had a trend towards a reduced rate of SWI.190 Universal use of these systems does not appear to be cost‐effective.167

#### **c. Postoperative measures**

- ∙ Maintain blood glucose <180 mg/dL in the early postoperative course (48 hours) using an IV insulin protocol.
- ∙ Use a restrictive transfusion trigger for blood (Hb <8 g/dL) and use blood products sparingly after surgery unless clinically indicated.191
- ∙ Plan early extubation and removal of invasive catheters as soon as possible as they can cause bacteremia and result in a SWI.
- ∙ Discontinue antibiotics after 48 hours.
- **3. Presentation** of a mediastinal wound infection can be either overt or occult and often depends on the infectious agent. For example, *S. aureus* infections tend to be virulent and present within the first 10 days of surgery. In contrast, coagulase‐negative staphylococcal infections tend to present late with an insidious onset and have a more indolent course.
  - **a.** A variety of classification systems for sternal wound infections have been proposed, varying with the time to occurrence, the depth and extent of the infection, and whether prior procedures had been attempted.192–194 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and STS definitions (see Appendix 14) differentiate between superficial incisional, deep incisional,

- and organ/space surgical site infections. However, the latter two categories tend to overlap. This is particularly true since it is difficult to rule out sternal or retrosternal infection when the prepectoral fascia or sternal wires are involved in the infectious process. The eventual approach to management usually depends on operative findings.
- **b.** Minor/superficial infections usually present with local tenderness, erythema, serous drainage, or a localized area of wound breakdown with purulent drainage. The sternum is usually stable.
- **c.** Major/deep incisional infections (deep subcutaneous, osteomyelitis, mediastinitis) may have any of the above, but usually present with significant purulent drainage, often with an unstable sternum. The patient commonly has fever, chills, lethargy, and chest wall pain. Leukocytosis is invariably present. Sternal instability may be noted when mediastinitis is present, but, in the absence of other clinical evidence, it may represent a sterile mechanical dehiscence.
- **d.** Inexplicable chest wall pain or tenderness, fever, Gram‐positive bacteremia, or leukocytosis should raise suspicion of a SWI which accounts for more than 50% of postoperative Gram‐positive bacteremias. Occult infections are particularly common in diabetic patients, who often mount a very poor inflammatory response and may present several weeks after surgery with extensive purulent mediastinitis but few systemic signs.
- **e.** A chronic draining sinus tract or sternocutaneous fistula is a common delayed presentation of chronic osteomyelitis, and often originates from the sternal wires.164

#### **4. Evaluation**

- **a.** Assessment of the degree of sternal instability is important in deciding how to proceed. If the sternum is unstable, operative exploration is indicated. If it is stable, further diagnostic tests are warranted in an attempt to identify a deep infection.
- **b.** Culture of purulent drainage may identify the organisms and direct appropriate antibiotic therapy.
- **c.** Wound aspiration may diagnose an infection when purulent drainage is not present.195
- **d.** Chest CT scanning may be beneficial if the sternum is stable. It may help identify a deep infection if there is loss of the integrity of retrosternal soft tissue fat planes or an undrained retrosternal abscess with air. Although there are reports that CT scanning is quite sensitive and specific for diagnosing wound infections,196 one must be cautious in its interpretation because hematoma formation and fibrin along the chest tube tracts are commonly present in the retrosternal area and may be interpreted as "consistent with infection". Clinical correlation and occasionally a wound aspirate are necessary before exploring a patient. A chest CT with three‐dimensional sternal reconstruction is very helpful in identifying a sternal dehiscence and allows the surgeon to adopt an appropriate strategy for closure, whether for a sterile dehiscence or an infection.

- **e.** White cell scanning, using indium111 or technetium labeling, and 99mTc‐ labeled monoclonal granulocyte antibody scintigraphy are among the radionuclide tests that have been helpful in identifying the presence and/or location of infections.197,198 FDG‐PET/CT scanning has also been helpful.199
- **f.** Occasionally, the infection will have to "declare itself " by spontaneous drainage when diagnostic techniques are inconclusive but the clinical suspicion remains high.

## **5. Treatment of a sterile sternal dehiscence**

- **a.** When there has been a sterile mechanical dehiscence, the patient usually describes increased chest wall movement and pain with breathing that may have been precipitated by a bout of severe coughing. This problem should be repaired when identified. At the time of exploration, wound cultures should be obtained if there is any suspicion of infection to determine whether long‐ term antibiotics might be indicated. An attempt should be made to restabilize the sternum. Problems arise primarily when there has been an off‐center sternotomy or wires that have pulled through one or both sides of the sternum, producing a "chicklet" sternum. At times, placement of Robicsek basket‐weaving sutures on the affected site will allow for standard wire closure. If not, rigid fixation plates (SternaLock Blu, Zimmer Biomet) that extend onto the ribs may be used. If that does not suffice, sternectomy and placement of muscle flaps as described below may be necessary.
- **b.** Use of a rigid fixation system should be considered prophylactically in heavy patients at risk for dehiscence, but should not be used in patients with narrow or osteoporotic sternums. This has been shown to reduce the risk of dehiscence and wound infection.179–182

## **6. Treatment of minor infections**

- **a.** Minor superficial site infections usually respond to oral antibiotics, opening of the wound, and local wound care. Use of negative pressure wound therapy can be used for larger wounds to expedite closure and may allow for secondary surgical closure, if desired. Persistence of a sinus tract or multiple areas of recurrent breakdown suggest a deeper‐seated infection, often involving the sternal sutures. This usually requires surgical exploration rather than repeated dressing changes. It may respond to simple wire removal and curetting of the involved bone with a six‐week course of antibiotics. Negative‐pressure wound therapy may also be helpful for sternocutaneous fistulas.
- **b.** If the sternal wires or the bone are exposed when the wound is explored, a deeper infection must be ruled out and mediastinal exploration is indicated. This may introduce infection into the mediastinum from the superficial tissues, but may allow for primary reclosure over drains depending on the extent of infection.
- **7. Treatment of major infections.**166,200 Major infections require mediastinal exploration for debridement of infected tissues, removal of foreign bodies (sternal wires or plates), drainage, and elimination of dead space. Antibiotic therapy is generally recommended for six weeks. The approach to achieving wound

- closure is conditional upon the time to development of the infection, the extent of mediastinal purulence, and the degree of sternal involvement.
- **a.** When there is a healthy‐appearing sternum that requires minimal debridement and minimal purulence in the retrosternal space with pliable mediastinal tissue that can eliminate dead space (usually within 2–3 weeks of surgery), primary sternal closure may be attempted with wires or rigid fixation plates.201
- **b.** If there is a large area of dead space behind the sternum or one is worried about exposure of prosthetic material or grafts, placement of omentum may be helpful.202
- **c.** Substernal dilute antibiotic (not povidone‐iodine) irrigation, suction‐irrigation systems, or closed vacuum substernal drainage systems have been used when there is residual mediastinal infection. However, failure to suction out irrigation solutions can lead to cardiac tamponade if more fluid is infused than drained.203,204
- **d.** Although skin closure can be performed, it is often advisable to leave the subcutaneous tissue open with use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), such as the V.A.C. Granufoam dressing (KCI, an Acelity Company), rather than continuous wound packing.
- **e.** If there is a very large wound defect, placement of pectoralis flaps with primary skin closure can be performed immediately or days later. Although more chest wall stability and an improvement in respiratory status can be achieved with sternal closure, performing primary sternal closure will predictably fail if the patient has significant mediastinitis or devascularized bone.
- **f.** When there is severe mediastinitis and purulence, marked sternal necrosis (more likely with bilateral ITA usage), or when sternal osteomyelitis requires extensive debridement or has recurred after previous interventions, the sternum should not be or most likely cannot be reapproximated upon first exploration.
  - **i.** Traditionally, the patient was left intubated and sedated for days with dressings applied directly on the heart until purulence improved. Nutrition was optimized, and then the patient would be returned to the OR for placement of muscle flaps over the heart with primary or delayed skin closure. This could include use of one or two pectoralis major flaps based on the thoracoacromial artery to cover the upper 75% of the wound, use of a right rectus flap (the side opposite LITA usage) based on the superior epigastric artery to cover the bottom 25% of the wound, or the use of an omental flap based on the gastroepiploic artery, which could be mobilized laparoscopically and could cover the entire wound.205 Unless the heart is well mobilized off the sternum at the initial exploration, there is a risk of right ventricular rupture with chest wall distraction, which usually proves fatal.206 Latissimus dorsi flaps are reserved for patients with very large wound defects.207
  - **ii.** To avoid prolonged intubation and potential cardiac damage, an alternative approach is that of immediate coverage after sternal debridement. This is feasible unless there is extensive mediastinitis. Muscle or omental

- flaps as described are placed over the heart using drains beneath the flaps to remove blood and serous fluid. The subcutaneous tissue can be closed primarily, but with an extensive infection, it should be treated with a NPWT dressing to close by secondary intention or secondary closure.
- **iii.** In the patient with extensive mediastinitis and gross purulence, immediate coverage may be unsuccessful or inadvisable and will lead to persistent infection. NWPT can be used, and a barrier (such as xeroform or petroleum gauze) should be placed between the heart and the NPWT dressing to avoid tissue erosion.157,208 This stabilizes the chest wall somewhat, but the coverage is not rigid and does not necessarily prevent displacement of the heart into the space between the sternal halves. Thus RV rupture, although rare, is not necessarily prevented.209 However, NPWT allows for earlier extubation, and will expedite time to eventual closure with muscle or omental flaps or, if there is adequate remaining sternum, to sternal reclosure. This approach of early NPWT dressings over the heart followed a few days later by primary sternal closure or flaps has significantly reduced the mortality associated with deep SWIs.208,210
- **iv.** NPWT dressings consist of a polyurethane ether foam with an evacuation tube that drains into an effluent canister connected to negative suction. This will decrease wound edema, reduce bacterial colonization, produce arteriolar dilatation, and improve microcirculatory flow, which encourages granulation tissue formation and accelerates wound healing. It can be used as a bridge to muscle flap coverage, to subsequent sternal rewiring if an adequate amount of sternum remains, or to closure by secondary intention or secondary suture closure of the subcutaneous tissue.
- **8.** The **prognosis** of patients developing a deep SWI is very poor, but has improved with early recognition and appropriate treatment. However, the long‐ term survival of patients discharged after the treatment of a deep SWI is compromised.211,212 One of the most significant risk factors for mortality is ventilator‐associated pneumonia, so earlier wound coverage or use of NPWT after appropriate mobilization of the heart should allow for earlier weaning from the ventilator. This may reduce the mortality associated with mediastinal wound infections.
- **E. Leg wound** complications have become less common with the universal use of endoscopic vein harvesting techniques.213 This involves a single knee incision and "poke holes" to ligate the vein proximally and distally. Significant bleeding in the endoscopic tract should be addressed surgically, with placement of a drain if there is persistent oozing. Nonetheless, the potential still exists for hematoma formation within the endoscopic tract which causes firmness and ecchymotic changes. Infection may occur at the incision site near the knee, but tract infections are fairly rare. Vein harvesting through one long open incision leads to cellulitis in about 20–30% of patients. This is more likely to occur in patients with severe PVD, diabetes and obesity, and is more common in women. Most complications are related to poor surgical technique with creation of flaps, failure to eliminate dead space, use of excessive suture material, or hematoma formation. With the technique of multiple

skip incisions, infections can also occur in a similar fashion to open incisions, especially since this technique may be accompanied by significant tissue trauma from retraction of the tissues for visualization.

## **1. Presentation**

- **a.** Cellulitis
- **b.** Wound breakdown with purulent drainage
- **c.** Skin necrosis from thin flaps or a large subcutaneous hematoma; formation of eschar
- **d.** Warm, indurated wound overlying an endoscopic tract, often with accompanying hematoma or skin ecchymosis and significant leg edema

## **2. Prevention**

- **a.** Use careful surgical technique: avoid tissue trauma, minimize flap formation, obtain meticulous hemostasis, and avoid excessive suture material and tissue strangulation, especially in the small knee incision for endoscopic harvesting.
- **b.** Use antibiotic wound irrigation prior to closure.
- **c.** Roll a sponge over the endoscopic tract prior to closure to evacuate any blood that may have accumulated during heparinization. If there is concern about ongoing bleeding, reinspect the wound after protamine administration to ensure hemostasis and then close the wound. If there remains a concern about bleeding, place a suction drain to evacuate blood and eliminate dead space in the endoscopic tract.
- **d.** Ace wrap the leg fairly tightly at the conclusion of surgery.
- **3. Treatment** of minor leg infections after endoscopic harvest requires oral antibiotics, removal of exposed foreign suture material, and drainage. Infections in endoscopic tunnels may require opening of the skin, but often can be managed by opening the skin incision and placing a Blake drain for antibiotic irrigation.214 If a large hematoma or necrotic skin edges are present after open harvesting, early return to the operating room should be considered to evacuate the hematoma and close the leg primarily. Eschar formation from devitalized flaps may require more aggressive debridement.
- **F. Radial artery harvesting.** Obtaining adequate hemostasis during open harvesting and before performing a layered closure that leaves the fascia open should prevent hematoma formation. Cellulitis is the most common manifestation of infection and will respond to antibiotics. Rarely, a purulent infection may occur that requires further drainage. Endoscopic harvesting is usually performed with a tourniquet in place, and blood accumulating in the endoscopic tract after the tourniquet is released should be manually evacuated. A drain is usually placed to evacuate blood and eliminate the dead space.
- **G. Antibiotic prophylaxis** for dental procedures is mandatory for all patients with prosthetic valves and grafts. The ACC/AHA guidelines for endocarditis prophylaxis changed significantly in 2007 with the recommendation to use antibiotics for dental procedures only in patients with prosthetic material and other patients at higher risk for infection. These recommendations are available online at www.acc. org and are shown in Table 13.7.115,215

Dental prophylaxis is recommended for patients at high risk:

- 1. Prosthetic heart valves and grafts, including homografts
- 2. Prosthetic material used for valve repair (rings, chords)
- 3. Previous infectious endocarditis
- 4. Cardiac transplant recipients with valvular regurgitation due to a structurally abnormal valve
- 5. Unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease
- 6. Repaired congenital heart disease with residual shunts or valvular regurgitation at the site of or adjacent to the site of a prosthetic patch or device

## **IX. Neurologic Complications**

Neurologic complications following cardiac surgery may involve the central nervous system (CNS) or peripheral nerves. CNS injuries are subdivided into ischemic strokes, delirium (encephalopathy), and neurocognitive deficits. Ischemic strokes are usually attributed to either cerebral embolization or hypoperfusion, whereas the mechanism for delirium and neurocognitive deficits is often multifactorial or of unclear etiology. CPB has been incriminated as the culprit for many neurologic complications, since it is associated with aortic cannulation and clamping, periods of hypotension, production of a systemic inflammatory response, and possibly a disruption of the blood–brain barrier. A meta‐analysis did in fact show a 50% reduction in stroke with off‐pump surgery, but this was primarily noted in patients with prior TIAs or stroke.216,217 Otherwise, no difference in neurocognitive function has been shown between on‐ and off‐pump surgery.218,219

#### **A. Central nervous system deficits: ischemic stroke**

## **1. Risk factors**

- **a. Preoperative factors.** A number of risk factors for postoperative ischemic stroke have been identified.220–224 A risk model incorporating several of these factors can be used to provide an estimated risk of stroke after surgery (Figure 13.4).220
  - ∙ A prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) suggests the presence of cerebrovascular disease or risk factors for its development (such as AF). It is likely that CPB can exacerbate preexisting cerebral ischemia or cause cerebral edema in areas where prior damage has caused disruption of the blood–brain barrier. One study reported that 44% of patients with a history of stroke developed a focal neurologic deficit after surgery. Of these, 8.5% were new, 27% represented reappearance of the old deficit, and 8.5% were worsening of the old deficit.225 Another study reported a fourfold increase in the risk of stroke in patients with prior strokes.226 Notably, a significant percentage of patients without known clinical strokes (ranging from 4.5 to 54% in various series) have preoperative evidence of silent cerebral infarctions on diffusion‐ weighted imaging (DWI) MRI scans, which tends to correlate with the occurrence of postoperative strokes.227–231 These patients tend to be older, have preoperative cognitive impairment, ascending aortic atherosclerosis, and intracranial arterial stenosis.
  - ∙ Cerebrovascular disease, including intracranial and extracranial cerebral artery disease, in addition to carotid disease.232 One study found that bilateral carotid disease of any grade increased the risk of stroke.233
  - ∙ Female gender
  - ∙ Comorbidities, including diabetes, smoking, hypertension, PVD, and renal dysfunction

| Risk Factors      | Weighted Score  |  |
|-------------------|-----------------|--|
| Age (years)       | (Age-25) × 10/7 |  |
| Unstable angina   | 14              |  |
| Diabetes mellitus | 17              |  |
| Prior stroke/TIA  | 18              |  |
| Prior CABG        | 15              |  |
| PVD or CVD        | 18              |  |
| Pulmonary disease | 15              |  |

The risk of stroke starts rising exponentially with a score >80.

- ∙ Atrial fibrillation
- ∙ Low ejection fraction or HF; recent MI
- ∙ Reoperative surgery233
- ∙ Urgent/emergent surgery
- ∙ Valvular surgery

## **b. Intraoperative/postoperative findings/events**

- ∙ Ascending aortic and arch atherosclerosis and calcification234,235
- ∙ Long duration of CPB (>2 hours)
- ∙ High transfusion requirement
- ∙ Left ventricular mural thrombus
- ∙ Opening of a cardiac chamber during surgery with possible air embolization
- ∙ Perioperative hypotension or cardiac arrest
- ∙ Postoperative AF

## **2. Mechanisms220,236**

- **a.** Thromboembolic strokes account for about two‐thirds of strokes encountered after surgery, usually arise from the aorta, and most commonly affect the right hemiphere.221,237 Aortic manipulation and/or arch disease commonly account for the development of stroke, and minimizing aortic manipulation can reduce that risk.238,239 Transcranial Doppler studies have suggested an association between cerebral complications and the number of microemboli detected during surgery.240 However, despite demonstration that about 45% of patients will have new cerebral infarctions on postoperative DWI, which would be consistent with microembolization, overt manifestations of stroke are not that common.231,241 Embolic sources may be from:
  - ∙ Atherosclerotic aorta (during cannulation, cross‐clamping or unclamping, application of a sideclamp for proximal anastomoses)
  - ∙ Solid (lipid) or gaseous microembolism debris from the extracorporeal circuit, which is more significant in patients in whom cardiotomy suction is utilized
  - ∙ Air embolism from the left heart
  - ∙ Left atrial or left ventricular thrombus (AF is the most common cause of "delayed" stroke)
  - ∙ Platelet‐fibrin debris from carotid ulcerations
  - ∙ Multiple blood and blood component transfusions
- **b.** Cerebral hypoperfusion may result from systemic hypotension or impaired cerebral flow from intra‐ or extracranial carotid disease.
  - ∙ Systemic hypotension is common during CPB, although cerebral autoregulation can maintain cerebral blood flow down to a mean pressure of 40 mm Hg. This compensatory mechanism is usually inoperative in diabetic, hypertensive patients, and may be impaired by cerebral microembolization.242 The blood pressure should be maintained at a higher level in these patients to provide adequate cerebral flow independent of the systemic flow rate.243

- One study showed a fourfold greater incidence of watershed infarcts when there was a 10 mm Hg decrease in intraoperative mean blood pressure compared with preoperative levels.244
- ∙ The blood pressure may be compromised during off‐pump surgery with manipulation of the heart, and is usually reduced pharmacologically during construction of proximal anastomoses when a sideclamp is placed on the ascending aorta.
- ∙ Although stroke is more common in patients with symptomatic carotid disease, it is also higher in patients with asymptomatic high‐grade unilateral or bilateral disease.233 Thus, the potential exists in these patients for cerebral hypoperfusion during an episode of perioperative hypotension resulting in a watershed infarct. One study showed that there was a 3.8% risk of stroke after an isolated CABG in asymptomatic patients with 50–99% unilateral disease and a 6.5% risk in patients with bilateral 50–99% lesions.245
- ∙ Cerebral hypoxemia from a low HCT during CPB may be associated with an increased risk of stroke. One study showed that the risk of stroke increased 10% for every percentage point decrease in HCT, particularly once the HCT was below 21%.246
- **c.** Although risk factors may vary depending on when the stroke occurs, cerebral embolization appears to be the dominant mechanism. Consistent with this hypothesis is a study in which postoperative scanning revealed that 77% of patients had large territory embolic infarcts, 16% were watershed, and 7% had a mixed pattern.247
- **3. Presentation.** The percentage of "early strokes" (noted upon emergence from anesthesia) vs. "delayed strokes" (occurring after a period of normal neurologic recovery) varies in different studies, some indicating that early strokes are more common248 and some that delayed strokes are more common,249,250 with a meta‐ analysis finding there was an equal distribution.251 Although the clinical presentation depends primarily on the site and extent of the cerebral infarction, the prognosis is better for patients suffering delayed strokes.248–251 The risk factors also tend to differ depending on the time of occurrence of stroke: early strokes are more common in patients with prior stroke, aortic atherosclerosis, and a long duration of bypass.248 Delayed strokes are often noted in patients developing AF as well as in those with known cerebrovascular disease and low cardiac output states.248 However, one study found that AF was a risk factor for delayed stroke only if accompanied by a low cardiac output state.249
  - **a.** A significant percentage of patients develop silent brain injury during surgery with new DWI MRI abnormalities noted in 25–50% of patients.231,252 In fact, following TAVR, MRI scans show new "asymptomatic" abnormalities in 77.5–90% of patients!253,254
  - **b.** Focal deficits most commonly produce hemiparesis/hemiplegia, aphasia, or dysarthria. Visual deficits may occur as the result of retinal embolization, occipital lobe infarction, or anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.255 The latter is more common in patients with long pump runs with extreme hemodilution. One study found that posterior strokes involving the posterior cerebral artery

and cerebellum were the most common location, although embolization to the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was also encountered in about 50% of patients since multiple emboli were commonly noted.256 Another found that the distributions of the MCA and anterior cerebral artery were the most common locations.221

- **c.** TIAs or reversible neurologic deficits (RNDs)
- **d.** Dysphagia with risk for aspiration
- **e.** Severe confusion or delirium
- **4. Prevention** of neurologic complications requires the identification and appropriate management of potential precipitating factors in the pre‐, intra‐, and postoperative periods.
  - **a.** Preoperative **evaluation for extracranial carotid disease** should be considered in any patient with current or remote neurologic symptoms or the presence of a carotid bruit. Some centers do this routinely and others do this selectively, with no evidence that neurologic outcomes differ. Noninvasive studies followed by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), if indicated, may identify significant carotid disease. One study found that the presence of intracranial and extracranial cerebral artery disease detected by MRA was more predictive of stroke risk than extracranial carotid disease.233
    - **i.** The approach to symptomatic carotid disease invariably entails either a preliminary carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or stenting or a simultaneous CABG‐CEA procedure.257
    - **ii.** For patients with asymptomatic carotid disease, management is more controversial. With the hypothesis that hypoperfusion might occur during a period of hypotension during or after coming off CPB when significant carotid disease is present, a concomitant operation is often performed for unilateral carotid disease >80–90% or bilateral high‐grade disease or contralateral occlusion (a class IIa indication).106 Performing a preliminary carotid procedure or simultaneous procedure appears to lower the risk of stroke with comparable results for either approach.258
  - **b.** Perioperative use of aspirin has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke by 50%.259
  - **c.** Preoperative use of statins may lower not only the risk of stroke but also the risk of delirium.260,261
  - **d.** Intraoperative epiaortic echocardiography can be used to identify aortic atherosclerosis that might alter cannulation and clamping techniques to prevent manipulation of a diseased ascending aorta.262,263 If not used routinely, it should be considered in patients with other markers for aortic atherosclerosis, such as hypertension, PVD, cerebrovascular disease, CKD, and COPD, or when increased thickness of the descending aorta is noted by TEE.264
  - **e.** Optimize blood pressure during CPB. Studies have shown that maintaining a mean pressure >80 mm Hg rather than in the 50–60 mm Hg range will reduce neurologic complications.243

- **f.** Use of cerebral oximetry may identify a significant decrease in regional cerebral oxygenation that can be improved by various maneuvers, such as maintaining a higher mean arterial pressure during CPB, raising the PCO2 to increase cerebral blood flow, or transfusing for a profound anemia. Theoretically, these interventions should be able to reduce the incidence of neurologic impairment, especially watershed infarcts caused by low flow.265–267 Some studies have noted that impaired autoregulation of cerebral blood flow was present in 20% of patients and the amount of time below the lower limit of autoregulation correlated with perioperative neurologic morbidity.268,269
- **g.** Minimize aortic manipulation during surgery.238,239 For on‐pump bypass surgery, use of single aortic cross‐clamping for construction of both distal and proximal anastomoses, rather than application of a sideclamp for the latter, may reduce the incidence of stroke.270 For off‐pump surgery, use of a proximal anastomotic occluder, such as the Heartstring device (MAQUET) to avoid aortic side‐clamping, or avoidance of cross‐clamping altogether with use of the ITAs as inflow vessels may be beneficial. In patients with severe aortic calcification requiring CPB, circulatory arrest may be indicated to avoid aortic cross‐clamping.
- **h.** Avoidance of hyperglycemia may reduce the risk of neurocognitive dysfunction, especially in nondiabetics.271 However, excessively strict glucose control may actually increase the risk of stroke.272
- **i.** Avoid systemic (and inferentially cerebral) hyperthermia during rewarming, which is associated with a higher risk of stroke and neurocognitive deficits.273
- **j.** Maintain a satisfactory HCT on pump. Most studies suggest using a lower limit of 20% since lower levels have been linked to stroke and neurocognitive dysfunction.274 However, the STS guidelines only recommend transfusions for a Hb <6 g/dL (HCT <18%) unless the patient is at increased risk for decreased cerebral oxygen delivery, such as patients with diabetes, older age, known cerebrovascular disease, or myocardial dysfunction, or considered at risk for end‐organ ischemia.88 However, this includes a large proportion of patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
- **k.** Particulate emboli can be captured by use of the Embol‐X intra‐aortic filter (Edwards Lifesciences) that is deployed at the time of unclamping and used until the patient is off bypass.
- **l.** Flooding of the operative field with carbon dioxide to evacuate air, especially during valve cases, may reduce the incidence of neurologic impairment.275
- **m.**Pharmacologic prevention of AF and initiating anticoagulation when it occurs may reduce the risk of delayed stroke.223,248,276 Anticoagulation is usually started after 48 hours of continuous AF or for recurrent episodes of AF. Consideration should be given to ligating the left atrial appendage in all patients undergoing surgery with preoperative AF, even if a Maze procedure is not performed. Whether this should be done routinely because of the 25% overall incidence of postoperative AF is debatable.
- **n.** Routine MRI scanning following TAVR has shown new cerebral infarcts in up to 90% of patients.253,254 However, although cerebral protection devices have been reported to trap debris in 99% of patients,277 they have not been shown to reduce the total number of new ischemic lesions, despite a slight reduction in new lesion volume, and have not shown any impact on the risk of clinical stroke

- or neurocognitive changes.278 Nonetheless, these devices might be considered in patients in whom there is more calcific burden, such as patients undergoing valve‐in‐valve procedures for prosthetic valve stenosis.
- **5. Evaluation** of neurologic deficits requires an assessment of the degree of functional impairment by careful neurologic examination and identification of the anatomic extent of cerebral infarction by CT or DWI MRI scanning. Scanning is most important in assessing whether hemorrhage is present or not, since up to 30% of infarctions may develop hemorrhagic conversion that will contraindicate use of heparin.247 In nearly 70% of patients with focal deficits, the initial CT scan will not show evidence of an infarction, although abnormalities will usually be evident on subsequent scans.279 Ideally, a DWI MRI should be obtained because it is more sensitive than CT scanning in identifying ischemic changes, watershed infarcts, or multiple embolic infarcts. However, this procedure can be difficult to obtain in a critically ill patient on a ventilator and multiple infusion pumps. Furthermore, it is important to analyze whether the findings are consistent with an acute perioperative infarct or were preexistent, since preoperative MRI scans are usually not obtained and yet are abnormal in up to 50% of patients.231 Evaluation should also be undertaken to search for a possible source of the stroke that might require additional attention (echocardiogram, carotid noninvasive studies).

## **6. Treatment**

- **a.** The use of heparin in patients suffering an embolic stroke is controversial. It is recommended for patients with AF, possible valve thrombus, or other sources of intracardiac thrombus, but has unclear benefit in preventing further aortic atheroembolism. It might improve cerebral microcirculatory flow, but the possibility of subsequent hemorrhage into an infarct zone must always be taken into consideration. Some neurologists feel that heparin should be withheld for at least 72 hours to minimize the risk of hemorrhagic conversion.
- **b.** Use of a clot retrieval device may be considered within 6–8 hours of the development of an ischemic stroke.
- **c.** Standard measures to reduce intracranial pressure, including diuresis, mannitol, and steroids, may be indicated depending on the extent of cerebral infarction.
- **d.** A CEA may be considered in patients with severe carotid stenosis and postoperative transient neurologic deficits or small strokes.
- **e.** Early institution of physical therapy is important.
- **7. Prognosis** is favorable for patients with small or temporary deficits, but the operative mortality rate for patients suffering permanent strokes is around 20%.221,224,280 The outlook for comatose patients is extremely poor, with over 50% dying or remaining in a vegetative state. Five‐year survival following a postoperative stroke is only about 50–60%, with most patients continuing to manifest moderate–severe disability.224,280–282 With such a dismal prognosis, any steps that can possibly be taken to reduce the occurence of stroke must be entertained.
- **B. Encephalopathy and delirium** represent an acute change in the patient's mental status that is associated with global impairment of cognitive function.
  - **1.** Several risk factors and contributory clinical scenarios for delirium have been identified, and risk models have been developed to predict its occurrence.283–287 However,

the etiology and pathophysiology are not always clear. The presence of both preexisting and new postoperative cerebral infarcts on MRI are independent risk factors for postoperative delirium, so underlying cerebral damage may leave the brain susceptible to an additional insult from surgery, whether it be microembolization or mild degrees of cerebral hypoperfusion.286–288 However, some studies suggest that there is no correlation of microembolization with the occurrence of delirium.289 Therefore, it has been suggested that neuroinflammation associated with the systemic inflammatory response, endothelial dysfunction, and disruption of the blood–brain barrier associated with use of CPB may be the underlying mechanism.290 However, although some studies have suggested that there is a slightly lower incidence of delirium after OPCABs,291 others have not found any difference.286 In general, it appears that various medications and metabolic and clinical issues that prolong the ICU stay are responsible for precipitating delirium in patients with predisposing risk factors.

## **2. Predisposing risk factors236,285,286,292–296**

- **a.** Older age (estimated at >20% in patients >age 65 and >30% in patients >age 80)293
- **b.** Recent use of alcohol, opiates, benzodiazepines, or preoperative antipsychotics
- **c.** Preoperative organic brain diseases
  - **i.** Neurologic diseases: prior stroke, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and other forms of dementia
  - **ii.** Psychiatric disorders: depression, schizophrenia
  - **iii.** Impaired executive or cognitive function with low mini‐mental scores294
- **d.** Severe cardiac disease and high‐risk status at the time of surgery (cardiogenic shock, urgent status, severe LV dysfunction)
- **e.** Associated medical problems including AF, smoking, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, PVD, CKD, and poor nutritional status (low albumin)
- **f.** Complex and prolonged surgical procedures on CPB

## **3. Precipitating factors**

- **a.** Abnormalities during CPB: low flow rates, low blood pressure, low HCT, low cerebral saturations by cerebral oximetry
- **b.** Medications: benzodiazepines, propofol, and analgesics292
- **c.** ICU issues: sleep deprivation, too much light at night, physical restraints
- **d.** Metabolic disturbances
- **e.** Alcohol withdrawal
- **f.** Multiple blood transfusions
- **g.** Postoperative adverse events: low cardiac output, AKI, hypoxia and prolonged ventilation, and stroke
- **h.** Infections, with or without sepsis

## **4. Manifestations<sup>296</sup>**

- **a.** Hyperactive delirium is manifested by agitation and restlessness.
- **b.** Hypoactive delirium is associated with lethargy, flat affect, or decreased responsiveness.
- **c.** Disorientation, confusion, attention deficit, memory loss, disturbed sleep/wake cycle
- **d.** Paranoia and hallucinations

- **5. Evaluation.** Various models have been devised to identify delirium and can be used to ascertain when interventions may be indicated.
  - **a.** The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM‐ICU) includes four features required to diagnose delirium: the acute onset of changes or fluctuations in the course of mental status, inattention, and either disorganized thinking or altered level of consciousness.297
  - **b.** The Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) includes eight items: altered level of consciousness, inattention, disorientation, hallucinations or delusions, psychomotor agitation or retardation, inappropriate mood or speech, sleep/wake cycle disturbance, and symptom fluctuation. Most patients with delirium have at least four of these features.298
  - **c.** Review current medications and drug levels.
  - **d.** Identify possible history of recent alcoholism or substance abuse.
  - **e.** Neurologic examination and brain CT or MRI.

## **6. Management296,299**

- **a.** Use soft restraints and keep siderails up to prevent falls out of bed.
- **b.** Avoid sleep deprivation, encourage early mobilization, use daily interruptions of sedation if on a ventilator.
- **c.** Correct metabolic abnormalities.
- **d.** Stop inappropriate medications. Try to avoid benzodiazepines and opiates, which can cause delirium, and if delirium is present, they can exacerbate confusion and produce agitation and stupor, especially in elderly patients. Olanzapine (Zyprexa), a thieno‐benzodiazepine, is considered an atypical antipsychotic which has been used successfully in delirious critically ill patients and has been associated with fewer side effects than haloperidol.300
- **e.** Carefully select sedative medications in the ICU to minimize the risk of delirium. Dexmedetomidine is associated with less postoperative delirium than propofol or midazolam when used for immediate postoperative sedation.301,302 It is also more effective than haloperidol in controlling the agitated, delirious, intubated patient, allowing for earlier extubation.303
- **f.** Select the appropriate medication to control agitation and the delirious state. Generally, most of these medications have equal efficacy, but side effects vary.304–306
  - **i.** Haloperidol 2.5–5.0 mg PO/IM/IV q6h is the most commonly prescribed medication for delirium. One should always be aware of the risk of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes in patients receiving IV haloperidol.307 It can cause extrapyramidal side effects, which may occur within 48 hours of starting the medication.
  - **ii.** Ondansetron (Zofran) is a 5‐HT3 ‐receptor antagonist that counteracts activation of the serotoninergic system. It is primarily indicated for the control of postoperative nausea, but is also successful in treating postcardiotomy delirium without major side effects. It is given in a dose of 4–8 mg IV or PO. One study showed equal efficacy to use of haloperidol for treatment of postcardiotomy delirium.308 A similar medication dolasetron (Anzemet) 12.5–25 mg IV can also be used.

- **iii.** Several atypical antipsychotics are also beneficial in managing delirium.304–307
  - **•** Risperidone (0.5 mg PO twice a day) acts by antagonizing dopamine D2 and serotonin 5‐HT2 receptors. It is generally well tolerated, but may be associated with extrapyramidal effects. One study showed that administration of 1 mg of risperidone upon regaining consciousness reduced the incidence of delirium by 67%.309 Another showed that early treatment with risperidone for subsyndromal delirium (a CAM‐ ICU score positive for 2/4 features or an ICDSC score of 1–3 out of 8) significantly reduced the risk of frank delirium.310
  - **•** Olanzapine starting at 2.5 mg daily and increasing to 10 mg daily provides comparable benefits to haloperidol, although it is more sedating.300
  - **•** Quetiapine (Seroquel) using a starting dose of 12.5 mg daily produces even more sedation and can cause hypotension as well as QT prolongation.
- **g.** Treat suspected alcohol withdrawal311
  - **i.** The Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA) score can be used in assessing the degree of withdrawal. Pharmacologic treatment is indicated for a CIWA score >10.
  - **ii.** Benzodiazepines (lorazepam, diazepam, or chlordiazepoxide) may need to be given for a few days, during which time the patient may require a few additional days of ventilatory support or may require reintubation while being sedated.
  - **iii.** Thiamine 50–100 mg IM/PO bid and folate 1 mg PO qd
  - **iv.** Psychotherapy: reassurance and support
- **7. Outcomes.** Delirium is associated with more postoperative complications, longer ICU stays, increased perioperative mortality, more hospital readmissions, and reduced quality of life. It contributes to cognitive dysfunction, including impaired attention span, memory, perception, and motor function that may persist for up to one year or even longer. It is also associated with greater functional impairment, reducing independence in activities of daily living and affecting mobility for at least six months. It may also increase the long‐term risk of death and stroke.312–315
- **C. Neurocognitive dysfunction** (NCD) is manifested by problems with memory and executive and cognitive function and is a fairly common complication of cardiac surgery. Depending on the timing and extent of neuropsychiatric testing, the incidence has been reported to be as high as 63%.316–318 Numerous studies have found that off‐ pump surgery does not reduce the risk of early or late NCD,319–322 despite one meta‐ analysis suggesting it does.323 In fact, the rate of cognitive decline or impairment in memory after six years appears to be no different in coronary artery disease patients managed medically or surgically.324–326 Thus, the development of progressive NCD after surgery is probably more related to the patient's baseline cognitive function and comorbidities than to specific precipitating factors postoperatively.

#### **1. Predisposing factors**

**a.** Risk factors include older age, diabetes, hypertension, preexisting cerebrovascular disease, chronic disabling neurologic illnesses, and lack of social support.327 Noncoronary atherosclerosis may be a risk factor, but aortic atheroma burden has not been consistently found to be associated with cognitive dysfunction.328,329

- **b.** Numerous studies have addressed the relationship between preexisting cognitive abnormalities or abnormal MRI scans and the development of postoperative cognitive decline.
  - **i.** Preoperative cognitive abnormalities have been noted in up to 45% of patients undergoing CABG.330,331 Patients with less cognitive reserve, dementia, or anxiety/depression are inclined to experience more disabling cognitive dysfunction.
  - **ii.** Although NCD may occur in the absence of demonstrable ischemic lesions on DWI, the presence of pre‐ or postoperative cerebral infarction, whether symptomatic or not, is likely to be associated with neurocognitive decline. It is estimated that up to 50% of patients have preexisting silent cerebral infarcts and 25–50% develop new postoperative infarcts.227–230,252,331–333 Although most new infarcts are silent,252,332 some studies suggest that virtually all patients with abnormal MRIs have evidence of NCD.317 One study found that two‐thirds of patients with multiple cerebral infarctions were asymptomatic, but 25% did develop cognitive decline.228 Another found that early NCD, but not new ischemic brain lesions, was predictive of late NCD.333
- **2. Mechanisms** for early and late postoperative cognitive decline appear to be different. Early decline may be related to cerebral microembolization, hypoperfusion, or the systemic inflammatory response to CPB, and may be reversible. Late decline is most likely related to preexisting cerebrovascular disease.334
  - **a.** Cerebral microembolization is often thought to be the cause of cognitive decline, but the fairly comparable incidence of NCD with on‐ and off‐pump surgery (despite more embolization during on‐pump surgery) and lack of strong evidence correlating embolization and cognitive decline call this hypothesis into question.335–338 The correlation between aortic atherosclerosis and NCD is also controversial, in contrast to the clear association of atherosclerosis with the occurrence of perioperative stroke. One study did show a slight reduction in early NCD with use of a cell‐saving device to reduce lipid embolization, but this benefit was not evident at one year, suggesting that progressive cerebrovascular disease was responsible for late NCD.339
  - **b.** Cerebral hypoperfusion is often considered the mechanism causing encephalopathy, delirium, and NCD. This may result from perioperative hypotension, either due to low pressures on CPB or soon thereafter, and may be incriminated if there is a significant or prolonged decrease in cerebral oxygen saturation noted by cerebral oximetry during CPB.267
  - **c.** The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) may be a contributory factor to neurologic injury, although not a causative mechanism.
  - **d.** Intraoperative hyperglycemia and hyperthermia during rewarming have been associated with NCD.271,273

#### **3. Presentation**

- **a.** Neurocognitive abnormalities include a deterioration in intellectual function and impaired memory. Forgetfulness, problems with word finding, altered attention span, reduction in psychomotor function, and impaired visual and verbal memory may be present.
- **b.** In some patients, the degree of cognitive dysfunction is immediately obvious; in others, it can only be detected by comparison of pre‐ and postoperative studies.

- **4. Prevention.** Steps to reduce cerebral embolization and maintenance of a higher perfusion pressure during surgery may be helpful in patients at high risk. Other recommended strategies include α‐stat pH regulation during profound hypothermia cases (see page 302), control of intraoperative glucose levels, and avoidance of cerebral hyperthermia during rewarming. Cerebral oximetry may be useful in identifying cerebral desaturation that has been associated with watershed infarcts, but it has not been shown conclusively to predict the occurrence of cognitive dysfunction.266
- **5. Evaluation.** MRI scanning often shows multiple infarctions, although such findings are also commonly seen in patients who are asymptomatic and may have been present preoperatively. Brain SPECT studies have shown worse cerebral perfusion at baseline and during surgery in patients with cognitive decline after surgery.
- **6. Natural history.** The duration of cognitive decline varies in numerous studies. One seminal study of CABG patients reported that 53% of patients had cognitive decline at hospital discharge, which decreased to 24% at six months but then increased to 42% at five years.316 Most studies conclude that cognitive function improves from the time of hospital discharge up to one year, and then remains relatively stable or slightly worse during subsequent follow‐up.340 The fact that long‐ term cognitive function was similar in patients with coronary disease managed surgically or medically suggests that the late decline is most likely due to the presence of poorly controlled risk factors for cerebrovascular disease, including hypertension and diabetes.324–326
- **D. Psychiatric problems** are fairly common in patients undergoing open‐heart surgery. Anxiety and depression occur frequently in patients with known psychiatric disorders, but are also noted in patients who have lost family members due to heart disease. The occurrence of these symptoms after surgery is associated with an unfavorable outcome, including early and late mortality.341–343 Exacerbation of preexisting disorders, including depression, bipolar disorder, and personality disorders, is also not unusual. A psychiatrist with an interest in postoperative problems is invaluable in helping patients resolve distressing psychiatric symptoms and in providing advice on the appropriate use of psychotropic medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy and stress management support are helpful in alleviating postoperative depression.344
- **E. Seizures** may accompany cerebral insults from hypoxia, or air and particulate emboli. However, they can also result from medication overdoses (e.g. lidocaine). Contributing factors should be addressed and the patient evaluated by a neurologist. A CT or MRI scan, EEG, or anticonvulsant therapy should be considered upon advice from a neurologist.
- **F. Critical illness polyneuropathy** is a syndrome of unknown etiology that complicates the course of sepsis and multisystem organ failure, and is associated with prolonged ventilation, longer ICU stays, and an increased mortality rate that approaches 50%. It usually presents as failure to wean from the ventilator due to weakness of the diaphragm and chest wall muscles. Axonal degeneration of motor and sensory fibers is the underlying pathologic process and is manifested by proximal muscle atrophy and paresis, decreased deep tendon reflexes, and, in some cases, by laryngeal and pharyngeal weakness, producing swallowing difficulties. It may produce motor and sensory deficits and can be diagnosed by electromyography and nerve conduction studies. The syndrome is self‐limited and is managed by supportive care (ventilatory support and

physical therapy), early mobilization, intensive insulin therapy to control hyperglycemia, and avoidance of neuromuscular blockers and steroids. About half of the patients developing this problem recover completely, but it may take 1–3 months to do so. It must be distinguished from other causes of postoperative muscle weakness, such as medications, nutritional deficiency, disuse atrophy, and other neuromuscular disorders.345,346

## **G. Brachial plexus injuries**

- **1. Etiology and prevention.** Stretch of the inferior cords of the brachial plexus by lateral sternal retraction or asymmetric elevation during ITA harvesting with compression of the brachial plexus between the clavicle and first rib is the most common cause of this injury.347–349 The incidence may be minimized by cautious and limited asymmetric retraction for ITA takedown, ensuring a midline sternotomy, caudad placement of the retractor, opening it only as much as necessary for adequate exposure, and maintaining a neutral head position.11 The incidence may also be lessened by positioning the patient in the "hands up" position. Despite taking all of these precautions, a small number of patients will still develop a brachial plexus stretch injury, most likely related to their individual chest wall architecture. Routine electrophysiologic studies identify abnormalities in upwards of 20% of patients, although most patients are asymptomatic.350 First rib fractures are often noted by bone scan, although they are frequently missed by routine chest x‐rays.
- **2. Presentation.** Sensory changes, including numbness, paresthesia, and occasionally sharp pains as well as weakness are common in the ulnar nerve distribution (T8– T1), which commonly affects the fourth and fifth fingers. Weakness of the interosseous muscles may also be noted. In more extreme forms, the median or radial nerve distribution may be involved. Radial nerve deficits are more likely to be caused by direct arm compression from retraction bars used for the ITA takedown or from positioning issues.
- **3. Evaluation.** Electromyography, motor and sensory conduction velocities, and somatosensory‐evoked potentials can be used to assess changes in nerve function, but their significance is not clear. They may be useful in assessing the extent of the deficit and the return of function.
- **4. Treatment.** Symptoms resolve in more than 95% of patients within a few months. Rarely, recovery may take up to a year, and some patients may have persistent, bothersome symptoms. Physical therapy is essential to maintain motor tone. If the patient has significant pain, amitriptyline (Elavil) 10–25 mg qhs, gabapentin (Neurontin) starting at 300 mg qd, or carbamazepine (Tegretol) 50–100 mg qid may be helpful.
- **H. Paraplegia** is a very rare complication of open‐heart surgery caused by spinal cord infarction. It is most common after thoracoabdominal surgery or extensive endovascular stenting. It may also result from an aortic dissection or as a complication of an IABP, presumably on the basis of atherosclerotic plaque shift or rupture, or cholesterol embolism to the spinal cord. There are rare case reports of paraplegia occurring after isolated CABGs, usually caused by a period of hypotension in a patient with preexisting hypertension and severe vascular disease that compromises spinal cord perfusion.351–353 There is one case report of embolization to bilateral anterior cerebral arteries causing paraplegia.354

- **I. Common peroneal or sciatic/tibial nerve palsies** are rare complications of surgery that usually have no identifiable contributing factor. Common peroneal nerve injuries cause weakness and sensory changes over the lateral lower leg and foot, whereas tibial nerve problems affect the posterior calf and dorsum of the foot. Direct nerve injury is impossible during vein harvesting, so the suspected mechanism is ischemia caused by direct pressure on the nerves with leg positioning. Older patients with diabetes, PVD, and subnormal body weight with atrophic tissues may be more predisposed to this problem, which is more likely to occur during longer operations involving CPB. However, in most cases, this complication is an unpredictable and unpreventable event. Fortunately, most patients recover satisfactory sensorimotor function and are not limited in their activities.355
- **J. Compartment syndrome (CS)** may develop following periods of prolonged compromised blood flow to the lower extremities. It may rarely affect the thigh musculature.
  - **1. Mechanism.** A compartment syndrome develops when the interstitial tissue tension within a confined compartment exceeds the pressure in the microcirculation, resulting in tissue ischemia. A prolonged period of ischemia followed by reperfusion results in cell membrane damage with fluid leakage into the interstitial compartment, which initially compromises the blood supply to nerve tissue and eventually will compress major blood vessels, causing loss of pulses. Thus, loss of pulses is one of the last manifestations of a compartment syndrome, at which time tissue loss has already occurred.
  - **2. Predisposing factors.** CS is rarely encountered with use of an IABP, most likely because of vigilant attention to leg edema and distal perfusion and the absence of a documented period of prolonged severe leg ischemia. However, CS has been noted in patients requiring prolonged groin cannulation (usually >4–6 hours) for CPB (aortic surgery, minimally invasive or robotic surgery) or for prolonged ECMO support. There are case reports of its occurrence after CABG, following both open and endoscopic vein harvesting.356–360 With the latter technique, the proposed mechanism is retraction of divided venous or arterial branches, which then bleed into the muscle.
  - **3. Prevention.** CS can be prevented by using alternative methods of groin cannulation that allow for distal perfusion (sewing a graft to the femoral artery or proximal and distal cannulation).361,362 However, these are rarely done, because the anticipated duration of CPB may be unpredictable, usually being lengthened when there are technical problems during the surgical procedure. Although placing a femoral arterial cannula via the Seldinger technique avoids the placement of a distal snare, distal flow is quite limited by the size of the cannula and by vasoconstriction during periods of hypothermia during surgery. Distal perfusion with a small cannula or side‐arm sheath must be assured when a longer duration of femoral perfusion (such as with femoral cannulation for ECMO) is anticipated. Obtaining adequate hemostasis during endoscopic vein harvesting should avoid development of a CS after CABG.
  - **4. Monitoring and treatment.** Any patient with a prolonged period of groin cannulation requires careful assessment for the development of a CS. Because patients are anesthetized and sedated for a number of hours, they are unable to complain of severe leg pain, which is one of the first manifestations of a compartment syndrome. Assessment of calf diameter and palpation for tenseness and tenderness, if

possible, are essential. Comparison with the contralateral leg may be beneficial, although less helpful if vein harvesting has been performed. If there is any doubt, obtaining a compartment pressure with a needle attached to a manometer is helpful. A pressure greater than 35 mm Hg or within 20 mm of the diastolic pressure is generally consistent with a compartment syndrome. If suspected, the patient should be returned to the operating room for a four‐compartment fasciotomy. The wound can be closed several days later if muscle tissue is still viable once the edema resolves. The muscle becomes nonviable from inside to out, so the superficial muscle may bleed despite ongoing necrosis of deeper muscle, and careful reassessment is important.

- **5.** A compartment syndrome involving the hand and forearm may occur after endoscopic radial artery harvesting but is more common when there has been inadvertent infiltration of an intravenous line through which large volumes of fluid, especially blood, are given. This is often not recognized until the drapes have been removed, but is immediately obvious because the forearm and hand are pale, mottled, tense, and massively swollen. Removal of the arterial line from that side and an immediate fasciotomy are indicated.363,364
- **K. Saphenous neuropathy** is caused by damage to small branches of the saphenous nerve that lies adjacent to the saphenous vein in the lower leg.11,348 This causes sensory changes along the medial side of the calf and foot to the level of the great toe. It is fairly common after open vein harvesting and is more likely with vein harvesting from the ankle up than from the top down. It is proposed that the former is more likely to cause avulsion of the pretibial or infrapatellar branches of the nerve. Neuropathy is also more common when an open incision is closed in two layers, producing neuropraxia from too tight a closure. These symptoms are much less frequent when the vein is harvested endoscopically, but damage to the nerve in the lower leg can still occur.
- **L. Forearm neurologic symptoms** following radial artery harvesting are not unusual. In one study comparing open vs. endoscopic harvesting, symptoms occurred in 42% and 64% of patients after open and endoscopic harvesting, respectively. Impaired sensation and paresthesia were more common in the superficial radial nerve distribution with open harvesting, but damage to the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve was only seen with open harvests.365
- **M. Vocal cord paralysis** has been noted in 1–2% of patients after cardiovascular operations and is initially manifested by hoarseness. A number of possible etiologies have been elucidated, but most involve an indirect injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve producing a reversible neuropraxia.366,367 A major contributing factor is a longer operation, which is usually associated with a longer period of postoperative intubation. Direct injury may occur during ITA mobilization at the apex of the chest, during central line placement, or during aortic arch surgery. In addition to hoarseness, vocal cord paralysis leads to an ineffective cough, stridor, and the potential for aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. Diagnosis can be made by laryngoscopy, which will distinguish it from laryngeal edema. Symptomatic improvement usually occurs within a few months, but if symptoms persist, it is more likely that the injury is permanent. In that situation, vocal cord medialization or thyroplasty may be indicated for unilateral paralysis.

- **1.** Gastrointestinal (GI) complications develop in approximately 4% of patients undergoing open‐heart surgery. Because they frequently occur in critically ill patients, they are often associated with other major adverse postoperative complications, such as low cardiac output syndromes, stroke, and respiratory and renal failure. A US nationwide study of patients undergoing cardiac surgery from 2010– 2012 reported a threefold increase in operative mortality (10.8%), with doubling of the length of stay, when GI complications occur.368
- **2.** The common pathophysiologic mechanism is sympathetic vasoconstriction, hypoperfusion, and hypoxia of the splanchnic bed.369–371 This may occur during CPB when there is nonpulsatile flow at low mean pressures with regional redistribution of blood flow away from gut mucosa. However, studies have demonstrated that mesenteric hypoperfusion and gastric mucosal hypoxia are present to a similar extent with OPCAB.372,373 Postoperative low cardiac output states, hypotension, and use of vasoconstrictors may also result in inadequate tissue perfusion, causing mucosal hypoxia with a reduction in absorptive and barrier functions. This may result in stress ulceration, mucosal atrophy, bacterial overgrowth from stress ulcer prophylaxis, and increased permeability, which in turn may potentially lead to bacterial translocation, the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis, and multisystem organ failure.374
- **3.** Predictive factors for the development of GI complications have been evaluated in multiple studies and include:375–380
  - **a. Preoperative comorbidities:** older age, CKD, PVD, active smoking, prior GI surgery, use of anticoagulants
  - **b. Preoperative cardiac status:** poor LV function or NYHA class IV, preoperative inotropic support, urgent or emergent surgery
  - **c. Operative factors:** reoperations, combined valve‐CABG cases, long durations of CPB (>120–150 minutes), multiple blood transfusions
  - **d. Postoperative issues:** low cardiac output syndrome and hypotension (with use of inotropes, vasoconstrictors, and/or an IABP), bleeding and need for transfusions or re‐exploration, use of bicarbonate for a metabolic acidosis, prolonged ventilation, AF, excessive anticoagulation, vascular complications, sepsis, sternal infections
  - **e.** Three of the strongest predictors of GI complications are prolonged mechanical ventilation, AKI, and sepsis, which together contribute to splanchnic hypoperfusion, hypomotility, and mucosal hypoxia.376
- **4.** A risk stratification model using a gastrointestinal complication score (GCS) that assessed nine variables has been proposed to predict the risk of developing GI complications (Figure 13.5).381
- **5. Overall perspective.** The US nationwide survey found that GI complications were statistically more common following off‐pump than on‐pump CABGs,368 although other studies concluded that the risk was comparable.382,383 The risks were higher in patients undergoing valve repair, perhaps related to longer durations of CPB. Paralytic ileus accounted for more than half of the complications

identified, with no other condition occurring in more than 1% of patients. These included, in descending order of occurrence: GI bleeding, pancreatitis, mesenteric ischemia, bowel obstruction, acute cholecystitis, and intestinal perforation. The mortality rate for any of these conditions was quite high, being 37% for mesenteric ischemia, 32% for intestinal perforation, 18% for GI bleeding, 17% for cholecystitis, and 7% for ileus. Many patients had concomitant conditions that increased the mortality rate, including endocarditis, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and COPD. Those who developed GI complications were more prone to develop AKI, AF (which might cause thromboembolic events or require anticoagulation precipitating GI bleeding) or to have sustained a perioperative MI. However, the highest mortalities occurred when the GI complication was associated with shock (31% mortality), a stroke (30%), AKI (21%), or sepsis (20% mortality).

- 6. Smaller individual studies have shown differing occurrence rates and mortality figures, but all confirm that the development of GI complications, although uncommon, portends high morbidity and mortality.<sup>375–381</sup> Therefore, diligent adherence to common principles of perioperative care is important. These include optimizing the patient's preoperative status, performing an expeditious and complete surgical procedure with good myocardial protection, obtaining careful hemostasis to minimize use of blood transfusions, using sufficient inotropic support for a low cardiac output syndrome, optimizing renal function, achieving early extubation to allow for early mobilization, taking steps to prevent infection, and judiciously anticoagulating the patient when indicated after surgery. Prompt identification and aggressive management are necessary to decrease the mortality associated with GI complications.
- **B.** Routine care and common complaints. Most patients have a nasogastric tube inserted in the operating room before heparinization or after its reversal by

protamine. This maintains gastric decompression during positive‐pressure ventilation, removes gastric contents to minimize the risk of aspiration, decreases gastric acidity, and allows for the administration of oral medications and antacids in the ICU. Sucralfate is often given down the nasogastric tube for initial stress ulcer prophylaxis.384–386 The tube is usually removed after extubation if bowel sounds are present. An oral diet is then advanced from clear liquids to a regular diet.

- **1. Anorexia**, nausea, and a distaste for food are fairly common complaints after surgery and may be attributable to the side effects of medications (narcotics), and possibly to mineral deficiency (especially zinc). However, one must not overlook the possibility of an ileus or other intra‐abdominal pathology and should perform a careful physical examination and obtain radiographic studies, if necessary. Bothersome nausea can be treated by a number of medications, which have fairly comparable efficacy.
  - **a.** Metoclopramide (Reglan) 10–20 mg IM qid. This may also stimulate GI motility and decrease the incidence of abdominal distention.
  - **b.** The 5‐HT3 antagonists are powerful antiemetic medications that may be associated with a proarrhythmic effect from QT interval prolongation. The most commonly used medication is ondansetron (Zofran) 4 mg IV.
- **2. Pharyngeal dysfunction** with dysphagia and difficulty swallowing liquids or solids has been noted in 1–3% of patients undergoing CABG and can lead to silent or overt aspiration pneumonia.
  - **a.** Predisposing factors include older age, comorbidities (insulin‐dependent diabetes, COPD, and renal dysfunction), HF, a history of stroke or new perioperative stroke, or perioperative sepsis.387–390
  - **b.** Swallowing dysfunction (dysphagia) and pain with swallowing (odynophagia) are quite common in patients monitored with intraoperative TEE.390–392 Because TEE is routine in most institutions, one must be alert to this problem in the early postoperative period if the patient has impaired pharyngeal sensation or coughs at the time of initial oral intake. One study found that the risk of dysphagia correlated with the time the probe was in the esophagus. By removing the TEE probe after the initial evaluation and then reinserting it just before weaning from CPB, the risk of dysphagia was reduced from 51 to 29%.393 Dysphagia has been noted in up to 50% of patients who remain intubated for more than 48 hours, which results in a delay in resumption of oral feeding and a prolongation of the hospital stay.394 Most hospitals have policies requiring assessment for proper swallowing if the patient is intubated that long.
  - **c.** The occurrence of pharyngeal dysfunction in the absence of common contributing factors (TEE, ventilation) has been ascribed to a new neurologic deficit. Thus, a full neurological evaluation with CT or MRI scanning may be indicated to identify the causative mechanism.
  - **d.** Bedside swallowing tests (usually swallowing 50 mL of water and assessing for a reduction in oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry as well as coughing or choking) can be used as an assessment for aspiration, but they have variable sensitivity in detecting silent aspiration. A modified barium swallow using video fluoroscopy may be indicated before the patient is allowed to eat.395,396

- **e.** The management of the patient with pharyngeal dysphagia may include dietary modification, postural adjustments, and working with speech therapists on swallowing maneuvers. Early evaluation of patients with swallowing difficulties by an ENT specialist may identify problems with laryngeal edema or vocal cord paralysis that can be managed to reduce the risk of pneumonia.397 Persistent dysphagia may require insertion of a feeding tube until satisfactory swallowing can be demonstrated.
- **3. Constipation** is a common problem after surgery. Preoperative enemas are usually not given, narcotics are used for analgesia, and elderly patients are often poorly mobilized for several days. Milk of magnesia, bulk laxatives (Metamucil), or stool softeners (Colace) may be helpful in older patients, and rectal suppositories (bisacodyl [Dulcolax]) or enemas may be useful. The possibility of an ileus or bowel obstruction should always be entertained before being too aggressive with medications promoting bowel motility.

## **C. Differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain**

**1. Manifestations.** The presence of an acute intra‐abdominal process can be difficult to detect in a critically ill patient in an ICU setting. It is frequently suspected by the presence of fever, an elevation in WBC count, marked tenderness to abdominal palpation, hemodynamic evidence of sepsis, or a positive blood culture. Arriving at the appropriate diagnosis can be even more challenging, but prompt assessment and management are essential because of the high associated mortality.

## **2. Etiology**

- ∙ Cholecystitis (acalculous or calculous)
- ∙ Perforated viscus (gastric or duodenal ulceration, diverticulitis)398
- ∙ Gastritis
- ∙ Pancreatitis
- ∙ Ischemic bowel (mesenteric ischemia)
- ∙ *C. difficile* colitis
- ∙ Severe paralytic ileus (frequently idiopathic, but occasionally associated with an acute inflammatory process or colitis)
- ∙ Small bowel or colonic obstruction
- ∙ Severe constipation
- ∙ Urinary problems (infection or bladder distention)
- ∙ Retroperitoneal bleeding

#### **3. Evaluation**

- **a.** Review of preexisting conditions or prior abdominal surgery
- **b.** Serial abdominal examinations for tenderness or distention, bowel sounds
- **c.** Laboratory tests: liver function tests (LFTs), lactic acid, serum amylase and lipase, *C. difficile* titer if diarrhea is present
- **d.** Radiographic studies
  - **•** KUB (for obstruction or ileus)
  - **•** Semi‐upright chest x‐ray (for free air under the diaphragm)

- **•** An upper abdominal ultrasound or HIDA scan (if biliary tract obstruction is suspected)
- **•** CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
- **•** Mesenteric arteriography (if mesenteric ischemia is suspected)
- **•** Diagnostic laparoscopy if other tests are unable to provide a diagnosis399
- **4. Treatment.** General surgery consultation should be obtained from the outset because early exploration may reduce the high mortality associated with the development of GI complications. Laparoscopy is very sensitive in evaluating the nature of the problem, but an exploratory laparotomy may be necessary to further assess and potentially treat the problem. Although many patients with these complications are very ill and often septic, they are usually better able to tolerate exploration after cardiac surgery than they had been before.
- **D. Paralytic ileus** occasionally persists for several days after surgery. It is frequently a benign, self‐limited problem of unclear etiology and may be more common in diabetics (who may develop gastroparesis), but occasionally may reflect sepsis or a severe intra‐abdominal pathologic process. Acute colonic pseudo‐obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome) is a condition of massive colonic dilatation believed to result from autonomic imbalance with either decreased parasympathetic tone or enhanced sympathetic tone. It must be differentiated from mechanical obstruction or toxic megacolon, often related to *C. difficile*.

## **1. Contributing factors**

- **a.** Drugs (catecholamines/cytokine stress response to surgery, opioids, neuromuscular blockade in ventilated patients)
- **b.** Gastric distention (possibly related to vagal injury)
- **c.** Congestion of the hepatic or splanchnic bed (from poor venous drainage during surgery or systemic venous hypertension)
- **d.** Inflammatory processes (e.g. cholecystitis, pancreatitis)
- **e.** Retroperitoneal bleeding (from groin catheterization, but occasionally spontaneously in an anticoagulated patient)
- **f.** *C. difficile* colitis
- **g.** Mesenteric ischemia

## **2. Evaluation**

- **a.** Serial patient examinations for abdominal distention, bowel sounds, and tenderness consistent with an inflammatory process (ischemia or perforation)
- **b.** Laboratory tests: CBC, amylase, LFTs, *C. difficile* titers if diarrhea
- **c.** KUB: colonic dilatation to 9 cm is significant, but the risk of perforation increases when the cecal diameter exceeds 12 cm.
- **d.** CT scan of the abdomen with contrast

## **3. Management**

- **a.** Decompression of the bowel is accomplished by keeping the patient NPO with nasogastric suction. This should prevent gastric distention until peristaltic activity returns. A rectal tube may also be beneficial when colonic distention is marked.
- **b.** Total parenteral nutrition should be started.

- **c.** Gum chewing may promote bowel motility.400
- **d.** Medications that can impair colonic motility must be stopped. These include narcotics, CCBs, and anticholinergic drugs. Although metoclopramide is commonly used to improve GI motility, it has not been shown to be effective in preventing or treating postoperative ileus. Peripheral mu‐opioid receptor antagonists (alvimopan and methylnaltrexone) may increase bowel motility in patients treated with narcotics, but they have not been evaluated in the management of ileus after cardiac surgery.401
- **e.** All metabolic disturbances must be corrected and therapy directed at any identifiable precipitating problem.
- **f.** Because "pseudo‐obstruction" may be caused by a deficiency in cholinergic tone, use of cholinesterase inhibitors may be beneficial in producing rapid colonic decompression. Neostigmine 2 mg IV has proven effective in 90% of patients with this condition, but it is not effective in treating a standard postoperative ileus.402 Although the initial response to an intermittent bolus or continuous infusion of neostigmine is comparable, a continuous infusion has been noted to give better resolution of colonic dilatation at 24 hours.403 Side effects include abdominal pain, sialorrhea (excessive salivation), vomiting, and bradycardia. In a patient with recurrent pseudo‐obstruction, pyridostigmine 10 mg bid may be beneficial.404
- **g.** When colonic distention (>12 cm) persists despite conservative or pharmacologic therapy, decompressive colonoscopy is indicated. If dilatation persists or worsens, urgent surgical intervention, usually by cecostomy or hemicolectomy, is indicated.
- **h.** Abdominal compartment syndrome may develop when there is marked colonic dilatation that produces severe intra‐abdominal hypertension (pressure >20 mm Hg). The abdomen is noted to be very tense. This may then produce systemic venous hypertension, impairing splanchnic and renal perfusion, producing hemodynamic and respiratory compromise, and even neurologic symptoms from compression of the inferior vena cava. The release of cytokines, generation of oxygen free radicals, and other factors may lead to bacterial translocation from the gut, interstitial edema, and eventually to multisystem organ failure. If not recognized, it may rapidly lead to progressive metabolic acidosis and death within hours.405

#### **E. Cholecystitis**

**1. Etiology and risk factors.** Cholecystitis is a rare late complication of cardiac surgery with an incidence of 0.1–0.3%. It is noted more commonly in older patients, after surgery requiring prolonged bypass times, and with low cardiac output syndromes requiring inotropes and/or an IABP and continued vasopressor dependence. These risk factors suggest that hypoperfusion is the major mechanism causing cholecystitis, which is more likely to be acalculous than calculous. Other predisposing factors include vascular disease, re‐exploration for bleeding or multiple transfusions, prolonged mechanical ventilation, bacteremia, and nosocomial infections. Fasting, parenteral nutrition, and narcotics can decrease gallbladder contractility and produce biliary stasis. If surgery is required because of an inadequate response to antibiotics, the mortality rate is significant, being 17% in the nationwide survey and 23–43% in three large series.  $^{406-408}$ 

#### 2. Evaluation

- **a.** Serial abdominal examinations may draw attention to an inflammatory process in the right upper quadrant.
- **b.** LFTs (elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase with minimal change in AST and ALT) may suggest extrahepatic biliary obstruction.
- **c.** Right upper quadrant ultrasound or HIDA scan can identify a dilated gallbladder and biliary obstruction.

#### 3. Treatment

- **a.** Antibiotic therapy may suffice in patients with acalculous cholecystitis who have no evidence of peritonitis.
- **b.** If significant clinical improvement does not occur within 24–48 hours, surgical intervention by percutaneous cholecystostomy (especially in critically ill patients) or cholecystectomy (open or laparoscopic) is indicated.

#### F. Upper GI bleeding

1. Etiology. Upper GI bleeding is the second most common GI complication after both on- and off-pump surgery with an incidence of 0.5–1%. It usually results from stress ulceration from duodenal ulcers and less commonly from gastric ulcers and esophagogastritis. 409,410 The causative mechanism is usually decreased blood flow, mucosal ischemia, and a hypoperfusion/reperfusion injury that may be exacerbated by increased gastric acidity. A thorough preoperative history and physical examination (stigmata of liver disease, stool guaiac) may identify patients at increased risk of developing postoperative GI bleeding.

#### 2. Risk factors

- **a.** Preoperative: older age, preexisting gastritis or ulcer disease, cirrhosis/portal hypertension/varices, CKD, smoking
- **b.** Intraoperative: long duration of CPB, valve operations, reoperations, increased lactate level during CPB (suggesting hypoperfusion)
- **c.** Postoperative: low cardiac output requiring vasopressors, prolonged mechanical ventilation, pulmonary infections, coagulopathy or anticoagulation (antiplatelet agents, heparin preparations, warfarin), blood transfusions
- 3. Prophylaxis. Any patient with a history of ulcer disease or gastritis should receive medications in the ICU to prevent stress-related mucosal damage and, potentially, GI bleeding. In addition, any patient on prolonged ventilatory support, with sepsis, or with a coagulopathy, should receive stress ulcer prophylaxis. Although routine prophylaxis may not be necessary in patients at low risk, there is little downside to initiating a short course of stress prophylaxis routinely during the early postoperative period of intubation when the patient may have a marginal cardiac output, visceral hypoperfusion, and some degree of coagulopathy. In the cardiac output, visceral hypoperfusion, and some degree of coagulopathy.
  - a. Sucralfate 1 g q6h can be given orally or down a nasogastric tube. It does not raise the gastric pH, which will increase gastric bacterial colonization, and thus reduces the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia compared with other medications that raise the gastric pH. However, it has not been shown to reduce the incidence of bleeding or mortality in ICU patients.<sup>385</sup>
  - **b.** Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been shown to be much more effective than histamine H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists (H<sub>2</sub> blockers), such as ranitidine, in reducing

the incidence of hemorrhagic gastritis and active ulcer formation, although they may increase the risk of pneumonia more than the H2 blockers.386,413,414 Pantoprazole (Protonix) 40 mg can be given IV or PO, whereas other common preparations, such as omeprazole (Prilosec) 20 mg qd, lansoprazole (Prevacid) 15 mg qd, or rabeprazole (Aciphex) 10 mg qd, can be given orally for prophylaxis. The SUP‐ ICU study found that use of pantoprazole increased mortality compared with placebo.415,416 Ranitidine is usually given as an oral dose of 150–300 mg bid.

- **c.** Patients should be prescribed non‐enteric‐coated aspirin after CABG or valve surgery because of more antiplatelet efficacy. Studies have not shown that enteric coating reduces the occurrence of GI bleeding or ulceration.417
- **d.** Although clopidogrel may cause fewer GI complications than aspirin in patients with no history of ulceration, either aspirin or clopidogrel (or both) can be used with a PPI if there is a history of a healed ulceration.418–421
- **4. Manifestations.** Drainage of bright red blood through a nasogastric tube or vomiting of blood is an overt sign of upper GI bleeding. Slow bleeding usually produces melena, but very rapid bleeding may produce bright red bloody stools. Attention should be drawn to potential GI bleeding in the critically ill or heparinized patient with an unexplained fall in HCT or progressive tachycardia or hypotension. If GI bleeding cannot be documented, a retroperitoneal bleed should be entertained as a possible diagnosis and evaluated by an abdominal CT scan.
- **5. Evaluation and treatment.** Bleeding that persists despite correction of coagulation abnormalities and intensification of a medical regimen requires further evaluation.421–423 Bleeding during anticoagulation is commonly associated with some underlying pathology.
  - **a.** It is essential to stop all antiplatelet medications or anticoagulants when there is evidence of GI bleeding, using reversal agents, if necessary, for persistent bleeding. This may entail vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma or prothrombin complex concentrate for high INRs from warfarin (see Figure 13.2 on page 774), or selective antidotes for the NOACs (idarucizumab for dabigatran, recombinant factor Xa for apixaban or rivaroxaban).
  - **b.** PPIs are superior to the H2 blockers in controlling and preventing recurrent bleeding.421 In the actively bleeding patient, an 80 mg IV bolus of pantoprazole followed by a continuous infusion of 8 mg/h × 72 hours has been recommended, and is able to quickly raise the gastric pH to >6.422,423 Ranitidine may be given as a 50 mg/h continuous infusion.
  - **c.** Upper GI endoscopy should be performed to identify the site of bleeding and can be used therapeutically with laser bipolar coagulation to control hemorrhage. It can achieve hemostasis in >90% of patients. However, in one series, about 30% of patients required surgery after an initial endoscopic procedure.424
  - **d.** Somatostatin 250 μg/h for five days has been shown to be effective in the treatment of severe upper GI bleeding.425
  - **e.** Once bleeding is under control, antiplatelet drugs should be restarted when feasible for patients undergoing CABG or valve surgery. Even in patients with a known history of aspirin‐induced GI bleeding, resumption of aspirin combined with a PPI is superior to using clopidogrel as an alternative antiplatelet drug.420 For patients requiring both aspirin and clopidogrel (usually after receiving drug‐eluting stents), both can be given safely with a PPI after endoscopic control of a bleeding site. If the patient requires anticoagulation indefinitely following surgery (e.g. for a mechanical

- prosthetic valve), a definitive procedure must be performed before resuming anticoagulation. The patient should understand that they are at higher thromboembolic risk while the anticoagulation is being held.
- **6. Results.** The overall mortality rate for patients developing upper GI bleeding after cardiac surgery is about 15%.368,424
- **G. Lower GI bleeding** may be manifest by bright‐red blood per rectum, blood‐streaked stool, or melena, and can usually be differentiated from upper GI bleeding if nasogastric tube drainage is guaiac negative.

## **1. Etiology**

- **a.** Mesenteric ischemia or ischemic colitis caused by periods of prolonged hypoperfusion
- **b.** Bleeding from colonic lesions (polyps, tumors, diverticular disease) which may be precipitated by anticoagulation
- **c.** Intestinal angiodysplasia. This is termed "Heyde's syndrome" when associated with aortic stenosis and may be associated with acquired von Willebrand's disease (vWD‐IIA). Bleeding usually improves following aortic valve replacement with a tissue valve, but angiodysplasia may persist.426–428
- **d.** Antibiotic‐associated colitis (usually *C. difficile*)
- **2. Evaluation.** Once an upper GI source has been ruled out, sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy can be performed. A bleeding scan may identify the bleeding source. Mesenteric arteriography should be considered if bleeding persists.
- **3. Treatment** involves correction of any coagulopathy and elimination of precipitating causes.
  - **a.** Antibiotics (vancomycin 125 mg PO qid or fidaxomicin 200 mg twice daily) can be used for *C. difficile* colitis.
  - **b.** Mesenteric angiography with infusion of vasopressin (0.2–0.4 units/min) or selective embolization with microcoils, gelatin sponges, and other particles into the mesenteric arterial branches may be considered.429–432
  - **c.** Octreotide (50 μg over 30 minutes) or somatostatin (50 μg bolus followed by an infusion of 250 μg/h) decreases splanchnic blood flow and may be beneficial in patients with GI angiodysplasia.433
  - **d.** Surgical intervention is rarely required for persistent bleeding.
- **H. Mesenteric ischemia** is a rare (0.2–0.4% incidence) but highly lethal complication of cardiac surgery that is usually noted in elderly patients with generalized atherosclerotic disease. It is often associated with dehydration.
  - **1. Etiology.** Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia is the most common etiology, resulting from splanchnic hypoperfusion from a low cardiac output state. This may occur after on‐ or off‐pump surgery, but most commonly after a long pump run.434,435 Atherosclerotic embolism (usually with use of an IABP) or mesenteric thrombosis (possibly from HIT) occurs less commonly.

#### **2. Risk factors**434–438

- **a.** Preoperative: older age, poor LV function, more advanced NYHA class, extensive atherosclerosis, CKD
- **b.** Intraoperative: aortic cross‐clamp time >100 minutes
- **c.** Postoperative: low cardiac output, use of an IABP, inotropic use or use of two or more vasoconstrictor drugs, prolonged mechanical ventilation, AKI, or need for dialysis, blood transfusions, atrial fibrillation

- **3. Presentation.** Typical manifestations are a profound ileus or abdominal pain out of proportion to physical findings. The diagnosis can be very difficult to make in the critically ill patient who is frequently ventilated and heavily sedated. Sepsis with hemodynamic instability, lactic acidosis, respiratory distress, GI bleeding, or diarrhea are often present as well. The diagnosis is typically made about 5–10 days after surgery.
- **4. Diagnosis** may be suggested by the association of the clinical picture just mentioned with leukocytosis, severe lactic acidosis, and an ileus on KUB or evidence of free abdominal fluid. Endoscopy may be helpful in documenting colonic ischemia. Mesenteric CT angiography may show evidence of pneumatosis intestinalis, venous gas, bowel wall thickening, arterial occlusion, or venous thrombosis.439 Standard mesenteric arteriography may identify thromboembolism, but most commonly demonstrates vasoconstriction of the peripheral mesenteric vessels. Unfortunately, the diagnosis is frequently made at surgery when irreversible changes have occurred. Early suspicion of mesenteric ischemia, based on a persistent paralytic ileus, absent bowel movements for several days despite laxatives, and a borderline or elevated lactate level may allow for earlier successful intervention with a vasodilator infusion, such as papaverine.440
- **5. Treatment.** Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to lower the mortality rate of mesenteric ischemia, which was 37% in the US nationwide survey,368 but in most reports exceeds 65%.436–438 If mesenteric vasoconstriction is identified, an infusion of papaverine 0.7 mg/kg/h for up to five days may be helpful, especially at an earlier stage of ischemia.440 When ischemia is prolonged, irreversible intestinal necrosis may occur within hours. Emergency abdominal exploration is indicated if bowel necrosis is suspected. Although a limited bowel resection can be performed, a more likely finding is multiple areas of ischemic bowel that prohibit extensive bowel resection. A second‐look operation is indicated if the viability of the bowel is in doubt. The presence of an abdominal compartment syndrome may lead to rapid deterioration of other organ system function and requires emergency exploration.441
- **I. Diarrhea** developing in a patient in the ICU setting is often an ominous sign because it may result from bowel ischemia caused by a low flow state. However, it is frequently caused by treatable problems including:
  - **1.** Antibiotic usage, which can reduce bowel flora and can lead to diarrhea even in the absence of positive titers for *Clostridium difficile*
  - **2.** *C. difficile* colitis, which has an overall incidence of 0.8% and is usually, but not always, associated with a prolonged duration of antibiotic therapy. The incidence is similar with use of cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. *C. difficile* is more common in patients who are older, female, have CKD, and with postoperative acute hyperglycemia. It is also more common in patients taking PPIs and receiving multiple blood products. For a patient with persistent diarrhea or unexplained abdominal pain and a leukocytosis, this diagnosis should be considered, and stool specimens should be sent for *C. difficile* titers. Oral medication may be started immediately upon suspicion of the diagnosis using vancomycin (125 mg PO four times a day) or fidaxomicin (200 mg twice daily) for 10 days for positive titers.442–444
  - **3.** GI bleeding
  - **4.** Intolerance of hyperosmolar tube feedings: dilute with more water and start at a slower infusion rate.

**J. Hepatic dysfunction** manifested by a transient low‐grade elevation in LFTs, including ALT, AST, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase, is not uncommon after open‐heart surgery. About 25% of patients will develop transient hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin >3 mg/dL), with a higher incidence noted in patients undergoing valve repair or replacement.445–447 However, less than 1% of patients will have evidence of significant hepatocellular damage that may progress to chronic hepatitis or liver failure. The elevated bilirubin may be multifactorial, with increased bilirubin production from hemolysis as well as impaired liver function, contributing to both unconjugated and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

## **1. Predisposing conditions**

- **a.** Preexisting liver disease. This may be manifest by elevated LFTs, but occasionally will be associated with normal values. However, impaired synthetic function (low serum albumin, high INR) is a marker for hepatic disease. An elevated bilirubin in patients with HF is one of the strongest predictors of the occurrence of postoperative hepatic dysfunction.448
- **b.** Cardiac conditions:
  - **i.** Right‐sided HF produces a high right atrial pressure causing passive hepatic congestion
  - **ii.** Preoperative cardiogenic shock (acute MI, papillary muscle rupture, valve thrombosis) may produce elevated LFTs consistent with a "shock liver" before surgery, predisposing the patient to the development of hepatic and multisystem organ failure after salvage open‐heart surgery.
  - **iii.** Endocarditis with evidence of sepsis may cause hepatic dysfunction.
- **c.** Operative factors: prolonged duration of CPB, complex operations (combined CABG–valve, multiple valves), greater number of blood transfusions
- **d.** Postoperative factors: low cardiac output syndrome, use of multiple inotropes or an IABP, sepsis, blood transfusions
- **e.** Medications, including statins, acetaminophen, and clopidogrel.449
- **2. Pathophysiology.** Hepatic dysfunction may result from either reduced hepatic perfusion or systemic congestion.
  - **a.** Hepatocellular necrosis
    - **•** Low cardiac output states usually requiring inotropic and/or vasopressor support
    - **•** Right‐heart failure or severe tricuspid regurgitation (chronic passive congestion)
    - **•** Sepsis injures the liver due to inflammatory mediators and other toxins; hepatic dysfunction due to sepsis is a major risk factor for multisystem organ failure and death.450
    - **•** Posttransfusion hepatitis C or cytomegalovirus infection (late)
  - **b.** Hyperbilirubinemia
    - **•** Hemolysis (paravalvular leak, long pump run, sepsis, multiple transfusions, drugs)
    - **•** Intrahepatic cholestasis (hepatitis, hepatocellular necrosis, benign postoperative cholestasis, parenteral nutrition, bacterial infections, medications)
    - **•** Extrahepatic obstruction (biliary tract obstruction)

- **3. Manifestations** depend on the specific diagnosis. Jaundice is a common accompaniment of hepatocellular damage or cholestasis. Severe liver failure may result in hypotension, coagulopathy, refractory lactic acidosis, hypoglycemia, renal failure, or encephalopathy from hyperammonemia, and sepsis.
- **4. Evaluation.** The specific LFT abnormalities usually indicate the nature of the problem. Additional tests may include those that detect hemolysis (LDH, low serum haptoglobin, schistocytes on peripheral blood smear), assess cardiac and valvular function (echocardiography), identify biliary pathology (right upper quadrant ultrasound or HIDA scan), or detect hepatitis (serologies).

## **5. Treatment**

- **a.** An elevated bilirubin is usually a benign and self‐limited postoperative occurrence. Bilirubin levels will gradually return to normal when hemodynamics improve unless there is evidence of severe underlying liver pathology. In this situation, progressive and irreversible hepatic dysfunction may result, leading to multisystem organ failure and death.
- **b.** Coagulopathy with "autoanticoagulation" may occur during a period of hepatic dysfunction because of the impaired capacity of the liver to produce clotting factors. In patients requiring anticoagulation, small doses of warfarin should be used to prevent the INR from becoming elevated to dangerous levels. If this occurs, the patient may develop cardiac tamponade or GI bleeding. In addition, the doses of medications that undergo hepatic metabolism must be altered.
- **c.** Stress ulcer prophylaxis should be given using one of the PPIs (pantoprazole 40 mg IV/PO qd).
- **d.** Due to high caloric expenditure and protein catabolism, give 1–1.5 g/kg/day of enteral protein.
- **e.** Hyperammonemia may cause an encephalopathy, and at levels >150–200 μmol/L may cause intracranial hypertension and cerebral edema.451,452 This can be treated by:
  - **i.** Control of fever and use of hypothermia protocols
  - **ii.** Intubation and induced hypocarbia
  - **iii.** For intracranial hypertension:
    - **•** Hypertonic saline solutions (20 mL of 30% NaCl or 200 mL of 3% NaCl) keeping the serum sodium <150 mEq/L
    - **•** Mannitol (2 mL/kg of 20% mannitol)
  - **iv.** Medications such as lactulose 30 mL qid with sorbitol and oral neomycin 6 g daily. These may have a role in chronic liver disease but their benefits in acute liver failure are not clear.
    - **v.** Hemodialysis (rarely)
- **f.** Blood glucose should be carefully monitored to prevent hypoglycemia.
- **g.** Lactic acidosis may result from impaired lactate metabolism rather than lactate generation from impaired tissue perfusion. Partial correction with sodium bicarbonate should be considered if the base deficit exceeds 10. Thiamine deficiency causing lactic acidosis should be considered and is easily correctable.
- **K. Hyperamylasemia** is noted in a substantial number (35–65%) of patients in the early postbypass period, but is associated with clinical pancreatitis in only about 1–3% of patients. Isolated hyperamylasemia in the early postoperative period is usually not associated with clinical symptoms or an elevated lipase level, and most commonly

arises from a nonpancreatic source, such as the salivary glands, or results from decreased renal excretion. Transient hyperamylasemia has a comparable incidence after on‐ or off‐pump surgery, so it is not directly related to use of CPB.453 However, some patients with an amylase level >1000 units/L early after surgery may subsequently develop subclinical pancreatitis about one week later with mild symptoms (anorexia, nausea, ileus) and elevation of serum lipase levels. Late elevations in amylase levels tends to be pancreatic in origin. A brief period of bowel rest may be beneficial for these patients, but no specific treatment is indicated unless there is clinical evidence of overt pancreatitis or GI tract dysfunction.454

- **L. Overt pancreatitis** is noted in less than 0.5% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, but is a serious problem associated with a significant mortality rate. Pancreatic necrosis has been noted in 25% of patients dying from multisystem organ failure after cardiac surgery.455
  - **1. Etiology.** Pancreatitis usually represents an ischemic, necrotic injury resulting from a low cardiac output state and hypoperfusion. A prolonged duration of CPB may sensitize the pancreas to the subsequent insult of a persistent low output state requiring vasopressors that leads to necrotizing pancreatitis. Additional risks factors include a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, CKD, and a requirement for norepinephrine support.456,457
  - **2. Presentation** is atypical and relatively nonspecific. Fever, elevated WBC, paralytic ileus, and abdominal distention occur first, with abdominal pain, tenderness, and hemodynamic instability representing late manifestations.
  - **3. Diagnosis** is suggested by the association of abdominal pain with elevated lipase levels. An abdominal ultrasound or CT scan may demonstrate a pancreatic phlegmon or abscess.
  - **4. Treatment** should begin with nasogastric drainage and antibiotics. Exploratory laparotomy with debridement and drainage is usually performed as a desperation measure, but it may be the only hope for survival in patients with aggressive necrotizing pancreatitis.

## **XI. Nutrition**

- **A.** Reversal of the catabolic state with adequate nutrition is important during the early phase of postoperative convalescence since malnutrition increases postoperative morbidity and mortality.458–461 The diet must provide enough calories to allow wounds to heal and to maintain immune competence. Although limitations in salt content, fluids, and cholesterol intake are important, overly strict restrictions should be secondary to providing tasty, high‐caloric foods that stimulate the patient's appetite. Too frequently, the combination of anorexia, nausea, and an unpalatable diet prevents the patient from achieving satisfactory nutrition. In non‐intubated patients who cannot meet their energy needs with an oral diet, oral supplements with low residue, such as Boost (Nestlé Health Science) or Ensure (Abbott Nutrition), are useful in meeting caloric requirements.
- **B. Enteral nutrition.** Patients requiring ventilatory support, those with swallowing difficulties after extubation, and many patients suffering strokes are unable to take oral feedings, but usually have a functional GI tract. If the patient cannot eat within 48 hours of surgery, enteral feeding should be initiated at a consistent hourly rate, not as

a bolus feed, and should be increased to goal within 3–7 days. Most patients requiring a tracheostomy after 1–2 weeks of mechanical ventilatory support will benefit from a feeding tube. If there is no evidence of gastroesophageal reflux, a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding tube can be placed for long‐term feeding. If reflux is present, a feeding jejunostomy may be considered at the time of the tracheostomy.

- **1.** General contraindications to enteral feeding include uncontrolled shock, uncontrolled hypoxemia/hypercarbia/acidosis, active upper GI bleeding, bowel ischemia or obstruction, or abdominal compartment syndrome. Enteral feedings can often be started even with absent bowel sounds, unless bowel ischemia or obstruction is suspected. Evidence of distention or high gastric residuals (>500 mL/6h) may indicate temporary intolerance to tube feedings. Despite a reluctance to initiate enteral feeding in hemodynamically unstable patients, especially those on vasopressors, it may be safe to do so as long as the patient has adequate intravascular volume.462,463 Early enteral nutrition can be used for patients on ECMO, with pancreatitis, and those given neuromuscular blocking drugs to aid with ventilation.
- **2.** A soft nasogastric feeding tube should be placed and tube feedings initiated after confirming the position of the catheter in the stomach. Postpyloric placement may lower the risk of aspiration, but is more difficult to accomplish. This is recommended if there is intolerance to gastric feeding due to gastroparesis or there is a high risk of aspiration. Factors increasing that risk generally include older age, use of mechanical ventilation, altered mental status, neurologic deficits, and gastroesophageal reflux. A three‐day course of prokinetic drugs, including erythromycin 200 mg IV in 50 mL NS through a central line or in 200 mL NS peripherally three times a day with or without metoclopramide 10 mg IV q12h, will stimulate gastric motility and increase tolerance to tube feedings.
- **C. Parenteral nutrition.** If the GI tract cannot be used, parenteral nutrition provided through a central line may be necessary. Because of the increased risk of infection compared with use of enteral nutrition, it has been recommended that parenteral feedings should be delayed for at least 3–7 days if the patient cannot tolerate any enteral feedings.459 In addition, if the caloric intake is <60% of the desired level after several days of enteral feedings, adding parenteral nutrition should be considered. Parenteral feedings may be supplemented with a lipid emulsion providing 0.1– 0.2 mg/kg of fish oil enriched with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) that are immunomodulatory and anti‐inflammatory.459,461
- **D.** Measures to reduce the risk of aspiration in patients on enteral feedings include the following:458
  - **1.** Elevate the head of the bed 30–45°.
  - **2.** Use chlorhexidine mouthwash twice a day to reduce the risk of pneumonia.
  - **3.** Use metoclopramide to promote GI motility.
  - **4.** Check the gastric residual volume; if it exceeds 500 mL, the tube feeds should be held for 2–4 hours and then restarted as a continuous infusion at a lower rate.
  - **5.** Advance the feeding tube into the small bowel if necessary.
- **E.** Initial enteral feedings should be hypocaloric relative to the patient's energy expenditure and should be increased to a full level by 3–7 days. Thus, one should initiate

feeding to provide 8–10 kcal/kg/day and gradually increase feeding to provide a total caloric intake of 25 kcal/kg/day (ideal body weight) within one week. In markedly obese patients, the dosing weight is the ideal body weight (IBW) + 0.4 × (actual body weight − IBW). General nutritional requirements for adult patients include 2–5 g/kg/day of glucose, 1.3 g/kg/day of protein, and 1.2–1.5 g/kg/day of fat provided as an omega‐3 enriched formula. A critically ill patient with multisystem organ failure may require 10–20% more calories with a protein requirement of 2–2.5 g/kg/day. A commonly used tube feeding such as Jevity 1.2 (Abbott Nutrition) will provide 1.2 kcal/mL. Thus, for a 70 kg man, 1500 mL/day will provide 1800 calories or 25 kcal/kg/day.

- **F.** Specific considerations in critically ill patients include the following:
  - **1.** Blood glucose levels should be monitored several times a day during the initial phase of enteral nutrition. Hyperglycemia must be prevented by use of intravenous insulin infusions.
  - **2.** Serum electrolytes, including potassium, magnesium, and phosphate, should be measured daily for the first week, especially looking for "refeeding hypophosphatemia", which may occur when enteral feedings are initiated in a malnourished patient.464 This is replaced with 0.3–0.6 mmol/kg/day of phosphate.
  - **3.** Soluble fiber and fibro‐oligosaccharides (FOS) should be included in enteral feedings to optimize bowel function and are indicated if the patient develops diarrhea. These are included in standard tube feeds such as Jevity.
  - **4.** Antioxidant vitamins and trace minerals, including vitamin C and selenium, should be provided to critically ill patients receiving parenteral nutrition. Many studies have shown that vitamin C (and fish oils) reduce the incidence of postoperative AF.
  - **5.** Patients with hypercarbic respiratory failure might benefit from a feeding that is high‐lipid and low‐carbohydrate, but this is rarely necessary. If fluid restriction is indicated, a calorie‐dense formulation, such as Isosource 1.5 (Nestlé Health Science) or Jevity 1.5, which both provide 1.5 kcal/mL, can be used. In patients with severe acute lung injury, an anti‐inflammatory formula containing omega‐3 fish oils and antioxidants, such as Impact (Nestlé Health Science) or Oxepa (Abbott Nutrition), may be beneficial.
  - **6.** Protein intake should be optimized to promote nitrogen retention while avoiding protein overload. Most patients with AKI can receive standard enteral feedings. Protein intake should be increased to 2.5 g/kg/day for patients on dialysis, which removes about 3–5 g/h of protein. Formulations such as Novasource Renal (Nestlé Health Science) or Nepro (Abbott Nutrition) provide high‐protein, low‐ carbohydrate, and low‐potassium loads.
  - **7.** Monitoring of visceral protein levels (transferrin and prealbumin) may indicate the adequacy of nutrition, but levels have not been shown to correlate with improved outcomes.

## **XII. Valve‐associated Problems**

All patients receiving a prosthetic valve require careful follow‐up because of the risk of developing valve‐related complications, including thromboembolism, endocarditis, anticoagulant‐ related hemorrhage, and valve degeneration.465 It has been aptly stated that when a prosthetic valve is placed, "the patient is exchanging one disease process for another".466

- **A. Thromboembolism.** The annual risk of thromboembolism averages 1–2% for aortic valves and 2–4% for mitral valves, with a slightly higher incidence in patients with mechanical valves taking warfarin than in those with bioprosthetic valves taking only aspirin. The recommended regimens for tissue and mechanical valves are summarized in Table 13.5 on page 770.
- **B. Valve thrombosis** of a mechanical valve may occur despite therapeutic anticoagulation. It is very rare with a bioprosthetic valve, although echocardiographic findings often raise the specter of "subclinical leaflet thrombosis" on both TAVR and surgically implanted tissue valves in patients not taking warfarin, which may increase the risk of stroke.120,467–471 Suspicion of mechanical valve thrombosis is raised by loss of valve clicks on auscultation and confirmed by fluoroscopy (see Figure 2.10, page 139) or echocardiography. Although thrombolytic therapy can be used in selected circumstances, an immediate operation to replace the valve is usually required.472
- **C. Pregnancy** poses a serious problem for the woman with a prosthetic valve. The incidence of fetal loss is 60% if warfarin is used during the first trimester, and there is a significant incidence of other congenital defects if pregnancy is completed ("coumadin embryopathy"). Tissue valves have been used for women of childbearing age, acknowledging the limited durability of valves in this age group. Cryopreserved homograft valves or a pulmonary autograft (Ross procedure) can be considered for young women undergoing aortic valve replacement. One anticoagulation regimen recommended by both the ACC/AHA and the ESC for women with mechanical valves who become pregnant is as follows:473
  - **1.** First trimester (up through 13th week): use warfarin if dose <5 mg/day, or use dose‐adjusted LMWH or IV UFH. Doses are usually UFH 10,000 units SC bid to achieve a PTT of twice control or LMWH SC bid (to maintain a four‐hour postinjection anti‐Xa heparin level >0.5 units/mL).
  - **2.** Second and third trimesters: warfarin +/− aspirin
  - **3.** Peripartum (or last half of third trimester): dose‐adjusted UFH or LMWH (often up to 20,000 units SC q12h) until delivery
  - **4.** Resume warfarin after delivery.
- **D. Anticoagulant**‐**related hemorrhage** is a major source of morbidity in patients receiving warfarin, especially in patients over the age of 65. In fact, it has been estimated that more than 20% of patients will experience major or minor bleeding episodes. Patient response to warfarin after surgery is quite variable, and may be related to genetic factors. The use of medications that influence INR levels (most commonly amiodarone and antibiotics) must be taken into consideration when dosing warfarin. It is helpful to use an anticoagulation protocol to initiate warfarin therapy (see Table 13.6 and Appendix 8). **It is absolutely critical that careful follow**‐**up be arranged for any patient discharged on warfarin** to avoid under‐ or overanticoagulation. Home self‐testing systems make it easier for patients to check their INRs and have been noted to minimize the fluctuation in the INR levels, resulting in less thromboembolism and improved survival.474 In patients whose INRs are hard to regulate, concomitant administration of vitamin K 100–200 μg/day orally helps stabilize the INR.129,130
- **E. Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE)** may develop at any time during the lifespan of a prosthetic valve with an annual risk of approximately 1–2%, which appears to be

comparable with surgically implanted and transcatheter valves.475,476 Early endocarditis (within 60 days of surgery) most commonly results from infection with staphylococci (coagulase‐negative more often than *S. aureus*), fungi, Gram‐negative organisms, and enterococci. This carries a significantly higher mortality than late PVE, which is most commonly caused by coagulase‐negative staphylococci and *Streptococcus viridans*. Clinical manifestations may include recurrent fevers, valve dysfunction with regurgitation and heart failure, cerebral or peripheral embolization, and, most ominously, the development of conduction defects resulting from a periannular abscess. The indications for surgery are noted in Chapter 1 (pages 61–62). It is critical that the patient understands the need for prophylactic antibiotics when any dental procedure is performed. The ACC/AHA recommendations detailed in Table 13.5 should be followed.215

- **F. Hemolysis** usually indicates the development of a paravalvular leak and is often worse when the leak is smaller due to increased turbulence. It may also result from transvalvular leaks resulting from pannus ingrowth or thrombus formation on a mechanical valve that restricts leaflet movement and may keep one or both leaflets in a partially open fixed position. Subclinical hemolysis is manifest by elevation in the LDH and reticulocyte count with a low haptoglobin level. The patient may also develop mild jaundice or persistent anemia, necessitating transfusion. Valve re‐ replacement is indicated for severe hemolysis or a significant paravalvular leak.477
- **G. Valve failure** is defined as a complication necessitating valve replacement.465 Mechanical valve failure is usually caused by thrombosis, thromboembolism, endocarditis, or anticoagulation‐related bleeding, and rarely by structural failure. In contrast, primary tissue failure is the most common cause of bioprosthetic valve dysfunction necessitating valve replacement. This occurs more readily in mitral valves, which are subject to more leaflet stress than aortic valves. Current‐generation tissue valves (porcine or pericardial) generally have some form of anticalcification treatment to potentially extend their lifespan. Nonetheless, early and late failures can occur, so constant vigilance and follow‐up echocardiograms are essential. Bioprosthetic valve failure usually occurs gradually, and valve replacement surgery can thus be performed on an elective basis either surgically or with a transcatheter valve‐in‐valve approach in both aortic and mitral positions. In contrast, high‐risk emergency surgery is usually required for catastrophic mechanical valve failure.

## **XIII. Discharge Planning**

- **A.** As the hospital length of stay continues to decrease, appropriate discharge planning is essential to ensure a smooth convalescence after hospital discharge. Patients requiring additional subacute care may be transferred to rehabilitation hospitals or skilled nursing facilities for several days before going home. Even when patients are well enough to be cared for at home, it is not uncommon for separation anxiety to develop, with both patients and family members experiencing difficulty handling minor problems.
- **B.** Appropriate discharge planning should involve the patient, family members, case managers, dietitians, nurses, mid-level providers, and physicians. Patients must be given explicit instructions as to how they will feel, how fast they should anticipate recovery, what they must not do, what they should look for, and when to contact the surgeon's office or the hospital. Several manuals are available that discuss

expectations and the reestablishment of standard routines at home (see www.sts. org and click on the "patients" link for a booklet on "What to Expect After Heart Surgery). Phone contact from the doctor's office is very beneficial in allaying patients' fears, answering routine questions, and dealing appropriately with potential problems. Since the definition of "operative mortality" extends out to 30 days after surgery, it is imperative that patients be contacted at that time to see whether they have been readmitted and to see how they are faring. This should be done in order to perform appropriate outcomes analysis and submit accurate data to the STS database.

- **C.** Most patients should have an available family member or friend at home for the first week after discharge. This provides reassurance for patients who may not yet be able to care for themselves, and it also provides an objective observer who is able to contact the hospital if serious problems arise.
- **D. Medications.**52,478 The patient should be provided with a list and schedule of all medications. The reason each medication has been prescribed as well as possible side effects and interactions with other medications should be discussed. If the patient is receiving an anticoagulant such as **warfarin**, it is **absolutely imperative that follow‐up be arranged** for prothrombin times (INR) and regulation of drug dosage. The adverse influence of alcohol, other medications, and certain foods on the level of anticoagulation must be emphasized (Appendix 11). The most commonly used medications at the time of discharge include the following:
  - **1. Aspirin** should be given to all CABG patients, not only to improve graft patency but also for the secondary prevention of coronary events. Aspirin has been shown to reduce long‐term mortality after CABG. It may be used alone for aortic bioprosthetic valves or combined with warfarin for patients receiving mechanical or bioprosthetic mitral valves.
  - **2. P2Y12 inhibitors** (clopidogrel, ticagrelor, and prasugrel) are given to patients with recently placed drug‐eluting stents and after TAVR or MitraClip procedures. They should be considered along with aspirin in patients undergoing CABG for acute coronary syndromes or after OPCABs.
    - **a.** Drugs that reduce clopidogrel's antiplatelet activity include omeprazole (but not pantoprazole), morphine, and amlodipine (which should not be given with ticagrelor), as well as grapefruit juice.
    - **b.** Drugs that enhance clopidogrel's antiplatelet activity include aspirin and ACE inhibitors.
  - **3. Warfarin** is prescribed for patients with AF, mechanical valves, and for some patients receiving tissue valves (see Table 13.3). NOACs may be used for AF or with use of tissue valves after three months, but are contraindicated in patients with mechanical valves.
  - **4. Statins** are indicated for all patients with coronary artery disease because of their lipid‐lowering and pleiotropic effects. Statins can stabilize plaque, potentially promote plaque regression, and mitigate the progression of saphenous vein graft disease. They have been shown to improve the short‐ and long‐term results of CABG and even valve surgery. All patients taking statins should have their LFTs checked at baseline and at six‐month intervals. High‐ intensity statins (atorvastatin 40–80 mg or rosuvastatin 20–40 mg) are recommended after CABG in patients <age 75, with moderate‐intensity dosing

- recommended in older patients. Potential drug–drug interactions may influence whether medications should not be prescribed or whether doses should be modified.
- **a.** Simvastatin has significant interactions with amiodarone, amlodipine, diltiazem and ticagrelor. No more than 10 mg of simvastatin should be given to patients on verapamil or diltiazem and no more than 20 mg of simvastatin should be given to patients on amiodarone or amlodipine.
- **b.** Atorvastatin has significant interactions with digoxin, diltiazem, and verapamil. No more than 40 mg of atorvastatin should be given to patients on diltiazem.
- **5. β**‐**blockers** are generally prescribed following CABG as prophylaxis against AF in the perioperative period, but they have also provided survival benefits in postinfarction patients treated medically or undergoing CABG, and in other patients with reduced EF or HF. There is some evidence that they may also improve long‐term survival in patients without a history of MI or HF.479 Carvedilol is often used in patients with impaired LV function. Otherwise, metoprolol is the most commonly prescribed β‐blocker and is beneficial for control of hypertension as well.
- **6. Amiodarone** may be given as prophylaxis for AF, although the optimal duration of therapy is not defined. It can usually be stopped after a couple of weeks if the patient remains in sinus rhythm. It is recommended for several months following a Maze procedure. Amiodarone can affect hepatic, thyroid, and pulmonary function, so any patient in whom therapy is anticipated beyond one month should have LFTs, thyroid function tests, and pulmonary function tests obtained at baseline. There are nearly 600 drugs which interact with amiodarone noted on the www.drugs.com website. Particular concerns in cardiac surgery patients are that amiodarone:
  - **a.** Decreases the metabolism of warfarin, necessitating a 25–50% reduction in warfarin dosing
  - **b.** May rarely reduce platelet inhibition by clopidogrel
  - **c.** Increases QT prolongation when used concurrently with fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin), 5‐HT3 antagonists (ondansetron), or haloperidol. These medications are generally contraindicated if amiodarone is being used.
  - **d.** Enhances bradycardia when given with β‐blockers or CCBs
- **7. ACE inhibitors** (or ARBs if ACE inhibitor intolerant) are recommended as the preferred antihypertensive drug after surgery, and are indicated in all patients with a reduced EF <40%, a history of infarction, diabetes, or CKD. Although short‐term mortality benefits have not been demonstrated, ACE inhibitors may provide long‐term mortality benefits.
- **E. Prophylactic antibiotics.** Any patient who has received prosthetic material (valves or grafts) must be aware of the necessity of taking prophylactic antibiotics if dental work is contemplated. Patients should be told to inform their physician or dentist accordingly and follow the ACC/AHA guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis delineated in Table 13.5.215
- **F. Diabetes mellitus** is associated with greater morbidity and mortality after CABG surgery, and poor diabetic control postoperatively may compromise graft patency and contribute to more rapid progression of native vessel disease. Diet and medications should be optimized to achieve a HbA1c <7%.

- **G. Diet.** Dieticians should meet with patients before discharge to discuss the particular dietary restrictions for their cardiac disease. This entails discussions of the significance of low‐cholesterol or low‐salt diets and the provision of appropriate dietary plans.
- **H.** The patient must participate in self‐evaluation at home. A daily assessment of pulse rate, oral temperature, and weight should be performed, and all incisions should be inspected for redness, tenderness, or drainage. Visiting nurses are usually recommended for patients discharged home to help with these assessments. Patients should be instructed to contact their physician's office if any abnormalities are noted.
- **I.** Patients should be encouraged to gradually increase their activity as tolerated. Patients with a median sternotomy incision should be discouraged from lifting objects weighing more than 10–15 pounds, because it puts strain on the healing sternum. Driving should be avoided for six weeks. In contrast, there are few physical limitations for patients who have small thoracotomy incisions for minimally invasive surgery or who have undergone TAVR or MitraClip procedures.
- **J.** Lifestyle modification and control of all modifiable risk factors are essential to optimize the long‐term results of surgery. These include weight loss, cessation of smoking (with nicotine patches and pharmacologic agents initially), and control of dyslipidemias, diabetes, and hypertension. Postoperative depression is not uncommon and should be identified and treated because it is associated with worse outcomes. Involvement in a cardiac rehabilitation program is an important aspect of long‐term care following surgery.
