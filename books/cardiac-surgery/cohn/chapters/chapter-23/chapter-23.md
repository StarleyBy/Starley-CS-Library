# Minimally Invasive Myocardial Revascularization

Piroze M. Davierwala • David M. Holzhey • Friedrich W. Mohr

The term minimally invasive coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is not well defined. According to one definition, avoidance of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is considered essential in decreasing the morbidity associated with conventional CABG.1 Other authors consider median sternotomy as a potential source for morbidity, due to increased risk of deep sternal wound infection and mediastinitis and delayed return to daily activities.<sup>2</sup> Accordingly, a number of surgical strategies have evolved to avoid the need for extracorporeal circulation and minimize surgical access. Furthermore, eluding aortic manipulation and complete arterial revascularization are operative strategies that focus on improving short and long-term results. Likewise, it was widely recognized that conventional harvesting techniques for bypass grafts are often associated with wound-healing problems, especially in diabetic patients. As a consequence, endoscopic harvesting techniques for both, venous and radial artery grafts have been developed.

# OFF-PUMP CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS (OPCAB) GRAFTING

Conventional CABG has been performed with CPB under cardioplegic arrest for decades. An empty, arrested heart, a bloodless surgical field, and an excellent exposure of all epicardial vessels have been considered to be the key factors for the success of this procedure. Excellent results and constantly declining mortality despite the ever-increasing risk profile of patients (Davierwala) have made standard CABG the "bread and butter" of our profession.<sup>3</sup> Anecdotal reports on the deleterious effects of CPB and systematic reports that examined the pathophysiology of extracorporeal circulation began questioning the dogma, "the pump is your friend." CPB is associated with (1) a systemic inflammatory response, (2) release of cytokines, (3) activation of the clotting cascade, (4) metabolic disturbances, and (5) microembolization among numerous other adverse effects. Although well tolerated by most patients, these effects alone or in combination may cause substantial morbidity, thus negatively affecting the results of the procedure. With an ever-aging population and increasing comorbidity, surgeons all over the world sought to further minimize the risk of CABG, and it seemed logical to question the role of CPB in CABG.

The evolution of off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) grafting is closely linked to the development of stabilizers that became available in the early 1990s. Initially, only pressure stabilizers were developed, but it soon became obvious that exposure of vessels on the posterolateral and inferior walls of the heart would require additional means of support. Hence, OPCAB gained greater popularity when vacuum-assisted stabilizers were introduced by the Utrecht group, which facilitated localized myocardial immobilization for all territories. Additionally, it was also recognized that OPCAB requires a team approach between the surgeon and anesthesiologist so as to prevent sudden hemodynamic changes during the procedure and to manage the same when they do occur.

# Anesthesia Requirements

OPCAB is performed under general anesthesia in most centers. Incidental reports in literature demonstrate that OPCAB can also be performed under high epidural anesthesia in an awake patient breathing spontaneously.<sup>4</sup> Standard monitoring is used. In addition, some centers prefer continuous cardiac output measurement using the PICCO or similar methods.5 A Swan-Ganz catheter is not always beneficial and contrarily can potentially cause arrhythmias when the heart is manipulated during the procedure. It is of utmost importance that the patient is kept warm at all times during the operation. Temperature management includes the use of a warming blanket and warm infusions, and maintaining higher the room temperatures. Volume management is essential because it is generally the preferred means to counterbalance hemodynamic changes. Exposure of the posterior wall results in severe hemodynamic compromise due to some degree of right ventricular compression under the right hemisternum, but can be treated adequately by increasing venous return by tilting the operating room table to the right in a Trendelenburg position. Excessive infusion of fluids should be avoided, especially in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), as hemofiltration is not possible during surgery due to the absence of CPB. The use of inotropes should be preferably reserved only in patients with severe hemodynamic alterations, because they invariably increase the heart rate and make grafting more difficult. A review of human factors associated with manual control and tracking revealed that a human operator can, at his or her best, track a three-dimensional motion (such as the beating heart) only up to a frequency of 1 Hz, which corresponds to a heart rate of 60 beats per minute. Higher frequencies cannot be tracked; therefore the preferred heart rate should be maintained between 50 and 70 beats per minute to simplify anastomotic suturing. In case of atrial fibrillation (AF), pharmacologic reduction in the heart rate and temporary ventricular pacing using epicardial pacing wires may facilitate grafting. The use of a Cell Saver is recommended to minimize the risk of blood transfusion, which is rarely necessary. If less than 500 mL is accumulated, the blood is usually discarded in the Cell Saver.

### Surgical Technique

Single or bilateral internal thoracic arteries (ITA) are harvested following a standard median sternotomy. The patient is heparinized (150-200 units/kg, ie, about half of CPB dosage). An activated clotting time (ACT) greater than 300 seconds is maintained. It may be necessary to open the right pleura in patients with severely dilated hearts, although some surgeons do it routinely to give the heart enough space during manipulation for exposure of the posterolateral wall. It avoids excessive compression of the right ventricle. Following pericardiotomy, it is advisable to hitch the left side of the pericardium onto the left sternal edge. Thereafter, the two edges of the sternum are spread out with the sternal retractor. This helps not only in rightward rotation of the heart, but also elevates the heart to a certain degree, which additionally facilitates exposure of vessels on the posterolateral wall. Subsequently, deep pericardial stay sutures are placed to further aid in exposure and manipulation of the heart. Numerous methods have been proposed for placing these sutures. Ideally, two sutures are placed deep into the pericardium (deeper than the level of the atrioventricular groove), one just medial to the inferior vena cava and the other just inferior to the left inferior pulmonary vein (Fig. 23-1). To avoid damage to the myocardium due to shearing, the sutures should be covered by plastic tubing; sponges may be used alternatively. Placement of the stay sutures should be done slowly because abrupt changes in positioning of the heart may cause undesired hemodynamic alterations or arrhythmias.

The sequence in which the grafting should be performed depends largely on the coronary anatomy and the grafting techniques used. The left anterior descending (LAD) artery is considered to be the most important target vessel and can be easily grafted without too much manipulation of the heart. Therefore, revascularization should start with an ITA graft to the LAD in most cases. A slight pull on the stay sutures easily brings the LAD into the operative field. The stabilizer is placed at the desired site of the anastomosis

so as to ensure adequate distance between the pods of the stabilizer and the vessel for suturing. The anterior surface of the vessel is exposed by dissecting it free from the overlying tissue. If the vessel is covered by excessive fat or muscle, lowenergy cautery and clipping of epicardial veins may help to minimize bleeding from the surrounding tissue. Mechanical compression of large diagonal branches should be avoided. Vacuum stabilizers should be locked only after vacuum is applied and the stabilizer firmly holds on to the surface. Only minimal pressure will then be required to immobilize the heart. The greater the pressure exerted by the stabilizer, the greater the force with which the heart beats against it, resulting in increasing wall motion and hence the difficulty in anastomosis. Temporary occlusion of the target vessel can be achieved in many ways. Complete or partially encircling 4-0 polypropylene sutures with or without pledgets or silastic tapes are commonly used widely. The occlusion tapes or sutures should be placed at a distance of at least 5 to 10 mm from the anastomosis to avoid compression and distortion of the target vessel at the level of the anastomosis, thus allowing for safe and comfortable suturing. The suture needs to be placed deep enough in the tissue to avoid damage of the target vessel. Injury to the accompanying coronary vein should be avoided to prevent bleeding at and around the anastomotic site. Distal coronary artery occlusion should be avoided and is rarely necessary even in occluded vessels with strong backflow. A shunt can be used in the latter case. Care must be taken to avoid occluding vessels in stented areas because the occlusion sutures/ tapes may bend or kink an implanted stent. The incision is usually made before the occlusion suture is tightened to ensure that the vessel is full, as it will minimize the risk of back wall injury while opening the vessel. The suture then is tightened gently until the bleeding stops. This may not be necessary in totally occluded vessels with minimal coronary blood flow. A CO, blower-mister is used to maintain a clear field of vision during the anastomosis by blowing away the blood flowing retrograde from septal branches or the distal coronary artery. The CO, flow rate should not exceed 5 L/min. Excessive blowing can produce dissection or injury to the intima of both, the graft and the coronary artery, or cause air embolism. The use of coronary artery shunts is controversial because they also may cause endothelial damage. If shunts are used, care must be taken to ensure atraumatic placement. Another option is the use of a transparent reverse thermosensitive gel (LeGoo<sup>TM</sup>, Pleuromed Inc., Woburn, MA) injected at the anastomotic site after incising the coronary artery, which temporarily blocks the blood flow allowing an almost bloodfree anastomotic site. The anastomosis can then be performed without a blowermister, shunt, or occlusion snares. The gel completely dissolves with time (after approximately 15 minutes) or with the local application of a cold sponge or gauze.<sup>7,8</sup>

The circumflex artery and its branches are usually grafted next, especially when a composite Y/T-grafting technique is used. Grafting the distal circumflex artery is considered to be the most challenging during OPCAB because exposure may be difficult. In patients with cardiomegaly and more importantly in those with right ventricular dilatation and dysfunction, it may be necessary to open the right pleura and divide the right-sided pericardium at the diaphragm up to the level of the inferior vena cava. This allows displacement of the heart under the right sternal edge into the right pleural cavity, thus preventing the compression of the right ventricle. Thereafter, the right coronary artery (RCA) and its branches are grafted. If the RCA is the dominant vessel and has a stenosis less than 80%, it may be necessary to use a shunt because loss of blood flow in the atrioventricular (AV) nodal artery during occlusion of the RCA can cause acute total AV block. It is therefore advisable to place and connect a temporary pacing wire before occluding such vessels.

To maximize both the short- and long-term benefits of an OPCAB procedure, composite arterial grafting is preferred. This will obviate the need for aortic clamping, which is another source for emboli and an independent predictor of stroke. In fact, some authors believe that avoiding aortic manipulation is the key factor in reducing the stroke risk following CABG below that after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

If aortocoronary vein or radial grafts are used, the proximal or distal anastomosis can be performed first. However, in patients with critical ischemia or hemodynamic instability, it would be beneficial to perform the proximal anastomosis initially, as it can be performed without manipulating the heart and the myocardium is revascularized as soon as the distal anastomosis is completed. It is of utmost importance to reduce the systemic blood pressure during partial clamping of the aorta to minimize the risk of embolization and aortic dissection. This can be achieved pharmacologically or mechanically by briefly compressing the inferior vena cava. This maneuver should also be repeated prior to declamping. Intraoperative graft patency control using transient-time Doppler or other imaging techniques is recommended. If the operative field is dry, heparin usually is not completely antagonized.

Postoperatively, aspirin is administered on the day of surgery, provided the patient does not bleed to muchion.

### **Special Situations**

In patients with unstable angina, acute cardiogenic shock, or low ejection fraction (EF < 20%), the preoperative implantation of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) may be useful. Alternatively, these patients can be operated on CPB without cardioplegic arrest (on-pump beating heart) to combine the advantages of preserved native coronary blood flow, decompression of the heart, and adequate organ perfusion. 13,14 Patients with AF have an irregular contraction pattern that may distract the surgeon while suturing (regular-motion patterns allow the development of coping strategies such as the "wait and see" strategy that are less effective when motion is unpredictable<sup>5</sup>). It may, therefore, be helpful to reduce the heart rate pharmacologically and temporarily pace the patient in a VVI mode. If AF is paroxysmal, epicardial ablation may be used for pulmonary vein isolation on the beating heart before grafting.

#### Results

Bakaeen et al reported recently that the number of OPCABs performed in the United States peaked in 2002 (23%) and 2008 (21%), followed by a steady decline to 17% in 2012. The last 5 years has witnessed a reduction in OPCAB rates not only in intermediate-volume centers performing between 50 and 200 cases a year, but also in high-volume centers performing >200 cases a year. They further reported that 84% of centers performed fewer than 50 off-pump cases per year, 34% of surgeons performed no off-pump operations, and 86% of surgeons performed fewer than 20 off-pump cases per year. 17 However, in some countries, especially, those with limited medical and financial resources, OPCAB still accounts for almost 80% of CABG procedures. Some units almost exclusively perform OPCAB with no patient selection. One of the major reasons for this decline is the results of several randomized controlled trials that have been unfavorable for OPCAB. The ROOBY trial reported a worse composite outcome of death and complications (9.9 vs 7.4%, p = .04), higher rate of incomplete revascularization (17.9 vs 11.1%; p < .0001), and a lower graft patency rate (82.6 vs 87.8%, p < .01) for OPCAB than on-pump CABG at 1 year. The Danish off-pump versus on-pump randomization study (DOORS) which included 900 patients > 70 years of age found no difference in the compound clinical endpoints between the two techniques at 30 days and 6 months. 16 However, the DOORS study group recently published a subanalysis, which revealed significantly inferior graft patency rates after OPCAB than after on-pump CABG at 6 months (79 vs 86%; p = .01).<sup>17</sup> Nevertheless, both these trials were not sufficiently powered to determine clinically relevant differences between the two techniques of surgical revascularization with respect to death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or renal failure. Sergeant and colleagues as well as Puskas and coworkers have pointed out that large

cohorts of patients would be required to reveal a significant statistical difference in these outcomes between the two operative techniques. 18,19 Hence, the CORONARY trial was conducted, which randomized 4752 patients to OPCAB (2375) and on-pump CABG (2377). No differences in composite outcomes were found between groups at 30 days, 30 days to 1 year, and at 1 year after surgery.<sup>20</sup> Similarly, the German Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting in Elderly Patients (GOPCABE) study, which involved 2539 patients > 75 years of age randomized to OPCAB or on-pump CABG, showed no difference in clinical composite or individual components of death, stroke, MI, or renal replacement therapy at 30 days and 12 months between the two groups.<sup>21</sup> However, patients undergoing OPCAB required significantly more repeat revascularization at 30 days, which nonetheless evened out at 12 months. This finding was keeping in lieu with those of Khan et al, who reported reduced graft patency in OPCAB patients three months postoperatively.<sup>22</sup> Contrary to this, other studies like the SMART and Prague IV study that provide angiographic data on graft patency reveal equal patency rates for on- and off-pump bypass surgery.<sup>23-25</sup> This controversy concerning OPCAB has remained unresolved ever since the first reports on OPCAB regarding higher rates of incomplete revascularization<sup>26-29</sup> and lower graft patency<sup>21</sup> were published.

OPCAB does play an important role in stroke prevention, especially in patients at higher risk. A meta-analysis that involved all major randomized controlled trials comparing OPCAB with on-pump CABG between 2011 and 2010 revealed a significant 30% reduction in the occurrence of postoperative stroke with OPCAB [risk ratio (RR): 0.70]. There was no significant difference in mortality (RR: 0.90) or myocardial infarction (pooled RR: 0.89).<sup>30</sup> There is growing evidence that neurocognitive outcome is better and stroke rate is lower after OPCAB.31-33 Several studies have proven CPB to be an independent predictor of adverse neurologic outcomes.<sup>34</sup> The embolic burden that is measured by transit-time Doppler of the medial cerebral artery is reduced significantly during OPCAB.35-37 Neurological complications can be further reduced during OPCAB by performing the operation without aortic manipulation. In a recent retrospective analysis of 12,079 CABG patients, Moss and colleagues reported that the ratio of observed to expected stroke rate increased as the degree of aortic manipulation increased, from 0.48 in the no-touch group, to 0.61 in the clampless facilitating device group, and to 0.95 in the clamp group. Aortic clamping was independently associated with an increase in postoperative stroke compared with a no-touch technique (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 2.50; p < .01). 38 OPCAB has also been associated with a reduced risk of acute renal failure,39-41 especially in high-risk patients with preoperative renal insufficiency. 42,43 A meta-analysis of 22 randomized studies involving 4819 patients affirmed these findings. OPCAB was associated with a 40% lower odds of postoperative acute kidney injury (OR 0.60; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43 to 0.84; p = .003) and a nonsignificant 33% lower odds for dialysis requirement (OR 0.67;

95% CI 0.40 to 1.12; p = .12) than on-pump CABG.<sup>44</sup> The kidney function substudy of the CORONARY trial, which enrolled 2932 patients, revealed that OPCAB reduced the risk of acute kidney injury when compared to on-pump CABG (17.5 vs 20.8%, p = .01); however, there was no significant difference between the two groups in the loss of kidney function at 1 year (17.1 vs 15.3%, p = .23).<sup>45</sup>

Furthermore, the incidence of postoperative AF<sup>43,46</sup> and blood levels of biochemical markers for myocardial injury (eg, creatinine kinase and troponin) are also reduced after OPCAB.<sup>47,49</sup> Blood loss is less, and transfusion rate is reduced.<sup>19</sup> Overall, OPCAB reduces hospital costs by 15 to 35%,<sup>50,51</sup> possibly owing to a decrease in the length of hospital stay and resource utilization.<sup>50</sup>

Most studies favor OPCAB with respect to operative and short-term mortality. A retrospective analysis of 17,969 OPCAB patients (8.8% of total) in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons database for the years 1999 and 2000 identified a significant survival advantage for OPCAB compared to on-pump CABG, as was demonstrated by risk-adjusted multivariate logistic regression analysis (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.84) and conditional logistic regression of propensity-matched groups (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.96).<sup>52</sup> Similar results have been reported from another multicenter analysis by Mack and colleagues, which included 7283 patients. Following propensity score matching and multivariate regression analysis, the use of CPB was identified as an independent predictor of mortality (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.52 to 2.83, p < .001).<sup>53</sup> OPCAB seems to offer a survival benefit especially in high-risk populations (eg, the elderly, those with EF < 30%, and obese patients). 19,50,54,55 The International Society for Minimally Invasive Cardiac Surgery Consensus Group, in a thorough meta-analysis, published that OPCAB reduces mortality and length of stay and the incidence of postoperative myocardial infarction (MI), renal failure, AF, and transfusion rate in mixed-risk and high-risk patients<sup>19</sup> (Fig. 23-2). Few reports on mid-term survival showed similar outcomes for OPCAB and on-pump CABG at 2 and 4 years.26,56

There are limited reports comparing the long-term outcomes of OPCAB and on-pump CABG. Three major publications in the last 5 years have produced different results. The long-term follow-up of patients enrolled in the Beating Heart Against Cardioplegic Arrest Study (BHACAS 1 and 2) showed a similar likelihood of graft occlusion between OPCAB (10.6%) and on-pump CABG (11.0%) groups (OR: 1.00; p > .99). Similarly, no differences were noted in the hazard of death (hazard ratio (HR): 1.24) or major adverse cardiac-related events or death (HR: 0.84) between the two groups.<sup>57</sup> Contrarily, a large propensity-matched analysis of 5203 patients showed a similar risk of death at 30 days (OR: 0.70; p = .31) and up to 1 year (HR: 1.11; p = .62) for OPCAB and on-pump CABG, but a higher risk of death for the former at a median follow-up duration of 6.4 years (HR: 1.43; p < .0001). <sup>58</sup> A recent meta-analysis of 32 studies comparing the long-term outcomes of OPCAB and onpump CABG concluded that OPCAB has similar mid-term

mortality and morbidity to on-pump CABG in a low-risk population. When observational studies were excluded a comparable long-term mortality was observed between the two surgical revascularization techniques.<sup>59</sup> To summarize, OPCAB is a technically challenging operation, which requires a prolonged learning curve compared to conventional bypass graft surgery. Some surgeons perform OPCAB almost exclusively, whereas others never use it at all. OPCAB may not be the best option for every patient or for all cardiac surgeons. It is, however, an important alternative and must be mastered with the same technical precision as conventional CABG.<sup>60</sup> True comparisons between OPCAB and on-pump CABG are extremely difficult even by randomized controlled trials as there are many factors such as quality of the coronary vessels anastomosed, type of conduits used, grafting techniques

(sequential, composite total arterial, venous grafts, etc), and competency and experience of the surgeons to perform OPCAB that cannot be accounted for. All the same, we have to wait for the results of long-term follow-up of large-scale, multi-institutional RCTs.

# MINIMALLY INVASIVE DIRECT CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS (MIDCAB)

One of the goals of minimally invasive cardiac surgery has been to avoid sternotomy to reduce the amount of surgical trauma and avoid wound complications. Therefore, coronary artery bypass techniques on the beating heart without sternotomy were developed. The operation was termed *minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass* (MIDCAB), and since its introduction in the mid-1990s, 61-65 it has found a widespread application. In some centers, MIDCAB is the preferred method of surgical revascularization for isolated LAD disease. In addition, MIDCAB is a valuable alternative to standard CABG or OPCAB in selected high-risk patients with multivessel disease and extensive comorbidity, who are at a prohibitively high risk for sternotomy and CPB.

#### **Anesthesia**

Standard monitoring techniques are applied, and temperature management is as described previously for OPCAB procedures. Single-lung ventilation is achieved by using a double-lumen tube or bronchus blocker to provide selective right lung ventilation. Short-acting anesthetics are used to allow early extubation.

### Surgical Technique

Standard MIDCAB is usually performed through a left anterolateral minithoracotomy with the patient in a 10 to 30° right lateral position. Following a 5 to 6 cm skin incision at the level of the fifth intercostal space or the inframammary fold in females, the pectoralis muscle is displaced bluntly with minimal division of its muscle fibers (muscle-sparing approach). This decreases the likelihood of developing a lung hernia that has been sometimes reported with this approach. The chest is then usually entered one intercostal space higher than the actual incision. Excessive rib spreading must be avoided at all times to prevent dislocation or fracture. Excision of a rib is almost never necessary. LITA harvest is usually performed under direct vision, but endoscopic harvest utilizing a harmonic scalpel or telemanipulation systems has also been reported. 65-67

The intrathoracic fascia is divided to facilitate LITA harvest, which can be performed in a pedicled or skeletonized manner, from the fifth intercostal space to the origin of the subclavian artery. Using a sceletonized technique offers the advantage of gaining more graft length, but is, of course, more time-consuming. Additional length can also be gained by dividing the mammary vein at its junction with the subclavian vein. Side branches are clipped or cauterized based on the preference of the surgeon. Heparin is administered prior to distal transsection of the graft. As in a sternotomy OPCAB, the ACT is maintained at a level greater than 300 seconds. The pericardium should be opened at a point approximately corresponding to the course of the LAD and extended to the groove between the aorta and the pulmonary artery. This will facilitate location of the target vessel in the presence of excessive epicardial fat or an intramuscular course. The target vessel is identified. To enhance exposure, one or two pericardial stay sutures may be used to position the heart. It is of utmost importance to have the anastomotic site in direct vision. Standard

reusable pressure stabilizers are then used to immobilize the target vessel (Fig. 23-3). Vacuum stabilizers in general are too bulky and not required for a single anastomosis to the LAD. Proximal LAD occlusion is performed using a 4-0 pledgeted suture or vessel loops. Ischemic preconditioning is not helpful, but some surgeons use it to feel more comfortable knowing that ischemia is well tolerated. The use of shunts is rarely necessary, but they may be used based on surgeon preference, presence of significant retrograde coronary flow or evidence of ischemia or hemodynamic instability. Distal occlusion should be avoided whenever possible (99% of patients). A blower-mister is used in all cases to achieve a bloodless field. The anastomosis then is performed in a standard manner using a 7-0 or 8-0 polypropylene running suture. Finally the LITA pedicle can be fixed to the epicardial tissue. Graft patency assessment is performed routinely using transit-time Doppler flow measurements. A single chest tube is inserted into the left pleural space, and intercostal nerve blockade is applied using local anesthetics. Before closing the chest with one or two strong rib sutures, the single-lung ventilation is stopped and the left lung is inflated under direct vision of the surgeon to prevent it from causing an avulsion of the LITA and also confirm that the LITA lies perfectly without undue tension. This is facilitated by holding the LITA close to the mediastinum using the suction tip or long forceps. Extubation can be performed in the operating room or a few hours postoperatively. Antiplatelet therapy is usually administered on the day of surgery.

#### Results

Many papers have reported excellent results with the use of this approach. Immediate angiographic patency rates range between 94 and 98% and are thus similar to those following conventional CABG. <sup>64,68</sup> At 6 months, 94% patency has been

reported.<sup>69</sup> The mid-term results published recently by Reser et al demonstrated an overall survival of 92.4 ± 0.2% and MACCE-free survival of 96.1 ± 1.7% at 24 months.<sup>70</sup> In our own series of 1768 patients, who underwent MIDCAB from 1996 to 2009, in-hospital mortality was 0.8% (predicted mortality by Euroscore 3.8%), and stroke rate was 0.4%. Conversion to sternotomy was necessary in 1.7%. A total of 712 patients underwent routine postoperative angiogram demonstrating a 95.5% early patency rate. Short-term target-vessel reintervention was required in 3.3% of patients. At 6-month follow-up, graft patency was 95.2% (n = 423). The 5- and 10-year survival was 88.3% (95% CI 86.6 to 89.9%) and 76.6% (95% CI 73.5 to 78.7%) (Fig. 23-4A). The corresponding freedom from MACCE and angina was 85.3% (95% CI 83.5 to 87.1%) and 70.9% (95% CI 68.1 to 73.7%) (see Fig. 23-4B).71 These results are comparable to those of other groups. 69,72,73

In-hospital mortality after MIDCAB is <1% and compares favorably with 1.4% mortality following off-pump single-vessel bypass and 3.6% mortality after on-pump single-vessel bypass reported in the registry of the German Society for Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery. It is also lower than the 2.4% mortality reported from the STS database. A propensity score adjusted comparison of MIDCAB versus full sternotomy revealed similar operative mortality, late survival, and need for repeat revascularization

(Data from 1483 patients undergoing MIDCAB at the Heartcenter Leipzig.)

at a mean follow-up of 6.2 years, but a lower rate of surgical site infection (2.8 vs 0.7%; p = .04).<sup>76</sup> Another smaller study from the UK also found MIDCAB comparable to OPCAB with regard to operative mortality, MI, stroke, reinterventions, and ICU stay. However, hospital stay was significantly lower for MIDCAB patients.<sup>77</sup> In general, rates of perioperative major complications such as MI and the need for target-vessel reintervention are low and comparable with standard CABG. However, due to anaortic surgery perioperative stroke is rare and considerably lower compared to conventional techniques. A few randomized trials comparing the LIMA-LAD with the MIDCAB approach to bare metal stenting for isolated proximal LAD disease have demonstrated better early patency and superior freedom from target-vessel reintervention and angina up to 5 years of follow-up in patients undergoing MIDCAB. 78-83 The 10-year results of the randomized trial conducted by our group comparing MIDCAB with bare metal stents for proximal LAD disease showed no differences in the primary composite endpoint of death, MI, and reintervention (47 vs 36%; p = .12) and hard endpoints (death and infarction) between the two revascularization modalities. However, a higher target vessel revascularization rate in the PCI group (34 vs 11%; p < .01) was observed.<sup>84</sup> Similar results were also reported when drug-eluting stents were compared to MIDCAB.85 These results have been further confirmed not only by meta-analyses<sup>86,87</sup> but also propensity-matched data from large registries.88

Some studies have pointed out that the lateral approach is associated with more pain than sternotomy chiefly due to excessive rib spreading required for visualizing the LITA during harvest. 65 Rib dislocation or fracture has been reported infrequently with this approach. Direct harvesting of the LITA is regarded as being technically challenging and has been one of the main arguments used by surgeons to disregard MIDCAB as the primary operation for patients who require surgical revascularization of the LAD. Limited working space and incomplete vision are blamed for insufficient graft length, incomplete mobilization, and the occasional reports of LITA or subclavian vein injury.

MIDCAB is technically a highly demanding procedure that should be performed by surgeons who have sufficient experience in conventional and off-pump surgery. It has been shown that the complication rate of MIDCAB (viz. conversion to sternotomy, reexploration for bleeding, and reintervention on the target vessel) is significantly reduced following 100 to 150 MIDCAB procedures. Therefore, it can be recommended that this operation should be performed by experienced surgeons dedicated to this technique.

Even in the era of improved outcomes following interventional procedures and lower in-stent restenosis rates with the use of drug-eluting stents, 90 MIDCAB, based on its very good long-term results, 91 will always remain an alternative revascularization strategy to PCI, especially for patients with complex ostial lesions, chronic occlusions, and in-stent restenosis of the LAD.

# TOTAL ENDOSCOPIC CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFTING

Total endoscopic coronary artery bypass grafting (TECAB) on the beating heart is conceivably the least invasive approach for surgical revascularization. It has been well known for a long time that working through ports limits the available space to perform motions, substantially decreases the dexterity of the operator, and alters the hand-eye coordination. Active assistance, an indispensable component of open surgery, is difficult in thoracoscopic procedures. The transition from limited-access cardiac surgery to endoscopic cardiac surgery therefore complicates the procedure manifold and has rendered previous attempts at endoscopic CABG using conventional endoscopic instruments impossible. To overcome some of the instrument-related limitations, computer-enhanced instrumentation systems have been developed.

# Principles of Telemanipulator-Assisted Cardiac Surgery

With the use of telemanipulation devices, the operator involved in the surgery is physically away but not necessarily remote from the operation table. He sits at an input manipulator (surgical console, master console), from which he steers the executing manipulator (slave console), which is situated at the patient site. The slave console consists of all the necessary electromechanical equipment needed to operate two to three exchangeable endoscopic instruments in addition to a high definition three-dimensional endoscopic camera. Both tactile and visual information is fed back to the master console. In this way a virtual three-dimensional operative field is created, wherein the surgeon can manipulate steering handles with a perfect hand-eye coordination. The introduction of telemanipulation technology to endoscopic surgery was able to address the key performance limitations of conventional endoscopic surgery, namely, reduced articulation, monocular vision, and loss of handeye coordination.

### Surgical Technique

Standard monitoring for cardiac surgery is used. Defibrillator pads are placed on the back and the right side of the chest. Single-lung ventilation using a double-lumen endotracheal tube or a bronchus blocker is used to ventilate only the right lung. Temperature management principles remain the same as for OPCAB surgery. After draping the instrument and camera arms, the camera and scope are calibrated, and the endostabilizer is prepared. A holding arm for the endostabilizer is mounted onto the operating table on the patient's right side, and the operating table is rotated 10 to 15° to raise the patient's left side.

After single right-lung ventilation is initiated, the camera port is inserted through the fifth intercostal space 2 cm medial to the anterior axillary line. CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation is used

for adequate visualization and to create working space that is hemodynamically tolerated (usually 10-12 mm Hg of insufflation pressure). A 30° scope that is angled up is used for LITA harvest. The right instrument port is inserted through the third intercostal space medial to the anterior axillary line, and the left instrument port is inserted through the seventh intercostal space medial to the anterior axillary line. The instrument arms are centered for optimal range of motion by adjusting the respective setup joints, and the instruments are inserted. LITA harvest starts by division of the intrathoracic fascia covering it with low-power monopolar cautery. The LITA is dissected bluntly off the chest wall moving from the lateral to the medial aspect as a pedicle, preserving the lateral veins. Side branches are cauterized or clipped. Dissection is performed from the first intercostal space to the level of the bifurcation. The pedicle is not detached from the chest wall until the anastomosis is finally performed in order to avoid torsion of the graft. The distal end of the graft is skeletonized to facilitate suturing of the anastomosis. The pericardial fat is removed, and the mediastinal and diaphragmatic attachments to the pericardium are dissected bluntly to widen the available space. The pericardiotomy is performed through a longitudinal incision in the pericardium over the probable course of the LAD. The ideal anastomotic site is identified by the absence of visible atheromatous plaques and avoidance of proximity to bifurcations. At this point, angling the endoscope downwards may enhance visualization. After heparinization (an ACT of 300 seconds is recommended), a vascular clamp is placed across the LITA approximately 2 cm proximal to the transsection site. The LITA is clipped distally, transected, and spatulated in preparation for the anastomosis. Flow in the graft is confirmed by briefly releasing the vascular clamp. The LITA pedicle is still left attached to the chest wall in order to maintain orientation of the graft until the anastomosis is performed. A 12 mm subxyphoid cannula is inserted under endoscopic vision. Before introduction of the endostabilizer, temporary silastic occlusion tapes and a 7 cm 7-0 double-armed polypropylene suture are introduced through this port and retained in the mediastinum. Some surgeons prefer Gore-Tex sutures to avoid the memory effect of polypropylene. Alternatively, nitinol clips (U-clips) may be used. The endostabilizer then is introduced under endoscopic vision by the surgeon at the operating table (Fig. 23-5). Vacuum and saline irrigation lines are connected, and the multilink irrigator is advanced into the field of vision. The console surgeon then positions the stabilizer feet parallel to the LAD target site. After suction is applied, the feet are locked into position. After blunt dissection of the anastomotic target site, the silastic tapes are placed proximal and distal to the anastomotic site, and the LAD is temporarily occluded. After a 5 to 6 mm arteriotomy is performed, transsection of the LITA is completed, and the graft is brought in close proximity of the target site. The anastomosis is best performed by beginning in the middle of the medial edge of the incision (12 o'clock position), suturing inside-out on the LITA and out-side-in on the LAD toward and around the heel. Care has to be taken to maintain tension on the suture

continuously. After the needles are broken off, an instrument knot is tied. The occlusion tapes and vascular clamp are released and brought out through an instrument port. The pedicle may be fixed to the epicardium by stay sutures. Graft patency can be checked by transient time Doppler flow measurements endoscopically, if a probe without a handle is available. This probe can be advanced through the stabilizer port. Alternatively, intraoperative angiography has been performed using a mobile angiography unit or modern C-arm systems when TECAB operation is performed in a hybrid suite. After the pleural space is drained under vision, the stabilizer and instruments are withdrawn, and the left lung is ventilated. A chest tube is inserted through one of the port holes. In case a four-arm system is used, the fourth arm is introduced after LITA harvest through the third intercostal space in the anterior axillary line. It may be used to provide counter traction during pericardial fat excision and pericardiotomy and to hold the pedicle during the anastomosis. The new version of the da Vinci system also allows the use of a remotely controlled stabilizer that is placed on the fourth arm and thus can be adjusted from the console.

#### Results

Initially, TECAB was performed on an arrested heart using the Port-Access platform with femoro-femoral CPB, endoaortic balloon clamping, and cardioplegic arrest. CPB time and cross-clamp times were in the range of 80 to 120 and 40 to 60 minutes, respectively. The reported patency rate for the TECAB procedures on an arrested heart ranged from 95 to 100% prior to discharge and 96% at the 3-month follow-up angiography. In addition to reporting good overall results and patency rates after TECAB, a large single-center study including 100 patients also revealed anastomotic times of 10 to 30 minutes after a long learning curve. They further acknowledged that the learning curve continues beyond 100

operations, which is even more pronounced than in MID-CAB procedures (see above).<sup>97</sup>

Endoscopic CABG on the beating heart is even more challenging. 93,98,99 Based on an intention-to-treat basis, the conversion rate (elective conversion to a MIDCAB procedure) in a five-center registry was 33% (37 of 117). Conversions were mostly due to calcified target vessels or the inability to locate or dissect the LAD and rarely due to other conditions such as arrhythmias or hemodynamic instability. The patency rates for completed beating-heart TECAB procedures are in the range of 92 to 94%.75

TECAB can be performed safely, but is currently restricted to a few indications (eg, single-vessel bypass grafting of the LAD and occasionally double-vessel grafting), but has the potential for endoscopic multivessel grafting as well. <sup>100,101</sup> A more commonly applied technique is an endoscopic harvesting of both ITAs and direct coronary anastomosis via a mini-thoracotomy. This yields excellent results and very short recovery times for the patients. <sup>101,102</sup>

Despite the use of advanced telemanipulator technology, the TECAB procedure remains technically demanding and is infrequently performed worldwide. Long operation times, extensive use of material, and operation room capacity combined with a stretched learning curve and well-established alternative minimally invasive techniques have confined TECAB to few centers and single dedicated surgeons.

# MULTIPLE BYPASS GRAFTING USING MINIMALLY INVASIVE TECHNIQUES

Talking about minimally invasive surgical revascularization almost always means revascularization of the anterior wall with the left internal mammary artery. The classical MID-CAB operation is only rarely extended to graft a diagonal or even an intermediate branch as well, typically with a Y-graft using a vein or radial artery.

Recent reports have proven the feasibility of complete revascularization for multivessel disease. Bilateral internal thoracic artery harvest is possible through small incisions under direct vision or endoscopically with the help of a telemanipulator. <sup>103</sup> For proximal anastomoses the aorta can be mobilized and partially clamped or the internal thoracic arteries serve as sources of inflow for a radial artery or saphenous vein.

Accessibility of all areas of the heart is made possible by special stabilizers and suction retractors that allow distal anastomoses even on the beating heart. As an alternative the Heartport system for endoaortic clamping and cardioplegia can be used.

These techniques are not yet routinely used. However, the published series of patients show excellent results oftentimes superior to conventional CABG or OPCAB.<sup>103</sup> Lemma and coworkers reported 137 patients operated with this technique with a 1.4% incomplete revascularization and revision for bleeding. There were no conversions to sternotomy nor

were there wound complications. Only two deaths occurred at a mean follow-up of 26 months. A positive stress test was reported in 4.3% of patients. 104 An angiographic patency study involving 91 patients who were prospectively enrolled to undergo minimally invasive multivessel CABG revealed a 100% patency for the LIMA-LAD graft and 92% patency for all grafts. 105 It can be assumed that these operations are performed by dedicated, experienced surgeons on selected patients. Only a more widespread application of these procedures and the treatment of a broader variety of patients together with randomized studies would bring light to their significance in the future.

#### **HYBRID REVASCULARIZATION**

The hybrid approach for patients with multivessel coronary artery disease seeks to combine the advantages of PCI and minimally invasive CABG. The principle was first described by Angelini in 1996. The goal is to minimize the surgical trauma but still gain complete revascularization. The rationale is that the excellent long-term results of LIMA to LAD grafting 1,107 cannot be extended to other grafts and areas of myocardium. This is particularly true for the still commonly used venous grafts to non-LAD targets. Here PCI can potentially achieve similar long-term results, though with higher rates of reintervention. Although recent studies underline the superiority of complete surgical revascularization, 108 the avoidance of sternotomy seems to be very appealing to both patients and treating cardiologists.

However, combining the benefits of two different procedures also means adding risks inherent to each type of procedure. The drawbacks of a surgical procedure including the risk of general anesthesia and artificial ventilation are combined with an increased risk of inferior long-term outcomes after PCI resulting in higher rates of reinterventions and the possibility of eventual redo surgical multiple bypass grafting. Therefore the indication for hybrid revascularization should be discussed and agreed upon by the treating cardiologist, cardiac surgeon and, most importantly, the patient himself.

# Indications for the Hybrid Approach

Current recommendations for coronary artery revascularization do not include hybrid procedures. This is due to limited availability of outcome data and a lack of randomized trials. Thus, choosing a hybrid approach is usually based on an individual decision. In all cases, the patients with multivessel disease including the proximal LAD need to be informed that the best evidence-based treatment is a sternotomy CABG procedure. However, the different reasons for choosing a hybrid approach can be summarized as follows:

• Multimorbid or high-risk patients: This is probably the best accepted indication and includes patients with a high risk for sternotomy such as those with skeletal anomalies like

osteogenesis imperfecta, severe osteoporosis, etc., those who are crutches- or wheel-chair-dependent, and those with a history of deep sternal wound infections following previous sternotomy. Patients with reduced life expectancy such as advanced malignancies, end-stage cardiomyopathy, advanced liver, and renal failure not amenable for transplant could also benefit from a hybrid procedure. Additionally, comorbidities that could be considered risk factors for a sternotomy and occurrence of other postoperative complications such as diabetes, severe obesity, COPD, end-stage peripheral vascular disease, porcelain aorta, and history of stroke with paraplegia might also be candidates for the hybrid approach.

- Primary PCI of Circumflex/RCA: Patients with acute coronary syndromes presenting with a culprit lesion in the circumflex or RCA and an additional stenosis of the LAD may undergo primary emergency PCI of the culprit lesion by the referring cardiologist. A MIDCAB procedure involving a LITA-LAD can be performed four to six weeks later. A preoperative angiogram confirming the patency of the stents should be performed prior to surgery. In the presence of an in-stent restenosis the patient can be scheduled for a standard bypass procedure.
- Patient preference: Some well-informed patients want to avoid a sternotomy and opt for a hybrid approach. Patients need to be informed that they might require future reinterventions including repeat target vessel revascularization or bypass surgery. Because the choice of the hybrid revascularization in these patients is not based on medical grounds, it deserves a formal discussion between the patient, interventional cardiologist, and cardiac surgeon.

# Timing of the Procedures

The optimal timing and the sequence of revascularization is still controversial. 109 All three possible scenarios have inherent benefits and drawbacks:

• PCI before CABG: Performing PCI first is usually associated with an increased risk of bleeding at the time of surgery because of dual antiplatelet therapy. This can be avoided in stable patients who received a bare metal stent by postponing the CABG procedure for more than 4 weeks. When the interval between the two procedures is even longer, performing a preoperative check-angiogram is reasonable to exclude early in-stent restenosis.

The PCI-first strategy is most commonly used in an emergency situation, when a non-LAD culprit lesion requires primary PCI. 110

CABG before PCI: This is the most frequently used option.
PCI is performed after the patient has recovered from surgery. After protection of the anterior wall the percutaneous approach for the other coronary arteries, including the left main coronary artery, is safer.<sup>111</sup> Additionally, the LITA-LAD graft can also be assessed.

Simultaneous revascularization: The growing number of novel operating suites that provide true integration of surgical and fluoroscopic capabilities allow for complete hybrid revascularization in one session without moving the patient. After performing a standard MIDCAB/TECAB procedure the quality and patency of the bypass graft is verified and PCI of the remaining vessels is undertaken with the patient still under general anesthesia. In the rare case of a failed PCI easy and safe conversion to conventional bypass surgery is possible. Patient acceptance for this approach is high, however, good coordination and synchronization of the schedules of the cardiologist and the cardiac surgeon is required.

#### Results

Hybrid coronary revascularization (HCR) as a concept has been applied for almost 15 years and provides an additional approach to revascularization for patients with multivessel coronary disease. The general consensus is that hybrid integrated revascularization is feasible and safe. 112-116 Friedrich and colleagues reviewed the results of 18 studies in literature, which included 367 patients. At 6 months the LIMA stenosis rate was 2% and in-stent restenosis was 12%.112 The large single-center series published by our group revealed a survival of 92.5% (95% CI 86.5 to 98.4%) at 1 year and 84.8% (95% CI 73.5 to 94.9%) at 5 years. 110 Eight patients died during follow-up (208 patient-years). A total of 23 patients had an angiogram for recurrent angina. One patient had an occluded LIMA bypass. Five patients showed significant in-stent-restenosis with the need for reintervention. At 1 year freedom from MACCE and angina was 85.5% (95% CI 76.9 to 94.1%) and 75.5% (95% CI 62.7 to 87.3%), respectively (Fig. 23-6).

The short-term results have been excellent.<sup>117</sup> Before a new therapeutic approach is routinely used, it has to be compared to well-proven standard modalities of treatment. Several controlled studies comparing the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of HCR with OPCAB have been published in the last 5 years. 118-121 However, the number of patients undergoing HCR in these studies was small and hence, conclusions drawn from such studies do not carry too much weight. A recently published meta-analysis, which included 422 patients undergoing HCR and >5000 patients undergoing OPCAB, revealed no differences in in-hospital mortality [relative risk (RR) 0.57, 95% CI 0.13 to 2.59, p = .47] or MACCE rates (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.64, p = .34) between groups. Nevertheless, HCR was associated with significantly lesser length of hospitalization (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.97, p = .01), length of ICU stay (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.80, p < .05), intubation time (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.84, p < .01) and need for red blood transfusion (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.82, p < .001). With regard to mid-term outcomes, Shen et al reported that mortality, MI, and stroke at 3 years after HCR were comparable to both, CABG and PCI in patients with multivessel disease.<sup>123</sup> However, the cumulative MACCE rate in the hybrid group (6.4%) was significantly lower than that in the PCI group (22.7%; p < .001), but similar to that in the

**FIGURE 23-6** Kaplan-Meier (including 95% confidence interval) 5-year survival curve (A) and event-free survival curve (freedom from death, myocardial infarction, stroke, freedom from angina, freedom from reintervention) (B) after minimally invasive hybrid revascularization in 117 patients.

CABG group (13.5%; p = .14). This was chiefly driven by a higher incidence of repeat revascularization in the PCI group. But interestingly, compared with the hybrid group, repeat revascularization in the PCI group was mainly concentrated in the LAD (2 vs 10 events; p = .029), and PCI with DES for non-LAD offered a similar repeat revascularization rate in the hybrid and PCI groups (4 vs 8 events; p = .307). This clearly proves the benefit of surgical revascularization of the LAD with the LIMA. Although HCR appears to be an attractive option, especially in the elderly and those at a higher risk due to comorbidities, <sup>124</sup> one must keep in mind the potentially higher rate of target vessel revascularization for non-LAD vessels, especially in diabetic patients Repossini.

No randomized controlled trial comparing HCR to CABG or PCI exist, which is mandatory in the current era of evidence-based medicine. Large, multicenter RCTs are needed to compare HCR with OPCAB to identify patient populations that would benefit most from HCR. Furthermore, the strategy or the order of revascularization should also be determined through such trials.

#### **ENDOSCOPIC CONDUIT HARVEST**

To minimize the overall trauma and wound healing problems of a CABG procedure, conduit harvest should be performed endoscopically or through small incisions. There is a body of evidence indicating that while the quality of the conduit is not impaired by an endoscopic harvest, wound infections and other complications of the harvesting procedure are decreased substantially. The cosmetic advantage is obvious.

### **Endoscopic Saphenous Vein Harvesting**

Despite the fact that arterial grafting yields better long-term results than venous grafting, and despite the increased use of the ITA and other arterial grafts, the greater saphenous vein is still frequently used for CABG. The standard longitudinal open harvesting technique of the greater saphenous vein is associated with a 2 to 25% wound complication rate (eg, dehiscence, delayed healing, infection, cellulitis, sepsis, and occasionally, limb amputation), delaying ambulation of patients, prolonging hospitalization, and causing an enormous economic burden. <sup>125-128</sup> In addition, open saphenous vein harvest is associated with increased postoperative and long-term pain, swelling, neuropathy, and scarring resulting in patient dissatisfaction.

Various techniques using 1 to 2 cm incisions have been described for endoscopic vein harvest. The single-incision technique involves identification of the greater saphenous vein through a 2 cm longitudinal incision at the crease of the knee posterior to the medial femoral condyle. The vein is layered free circumferentially, following which, a subcutaneous retractor or dissection cannula is introduced. An endoscope is inserted into the subcutaneous tissue. Exposure can be enhanced by insufflating CO<sub>2</sub>. The vein is further mobilized circumferentially, and side branches are either clipped, coagulated using bipolar endoscopic cautery scissors, or vaporized using a harmonic scalpel. Whenever bipolar cautery is applied, a distance of at least 2 mm between the scissors and the vein should be maintained in order to avoid thermal damage to the graft. Proximal and distal control of the greater saphenous vein is accomplished with endoscopic application of clips or polypropylene sutures or ligation loops. With this technique, the entire length of the vein can be harvested from the sapheno-femoral junction to the medial malleolus through a single incision. The wound is closed in a standard manner, and the leg is wrapped circumferentially with crepe bandages. In experienced hands, the procedure takes between 15 and 30 minutes. 129 As with all endoscopic techniques, a learning curve is associated with endoscopic vein harvesting as well, and entails approximately 30 patients and a conversion rate ranging from 0 to 22%.

#### Results

The ISMICS Consensus Group reviewed the results of 1319 randomized and 8023 nonrandomized patients. In this metaanalysis, the risk of wound complications was reduced significantly by 69% with endoscopic vein harvesting compared with the open technique (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.43; p < .0001). The need for surgical intervention for wound infection also was reduced significantly (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.70; p = .007). With regard to the incidence of moderate to severe postoperative pain, endoscopic vein harvesting was associated with a 74% reduction when compared with the open technique (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.55; p < .0001), and this reduction reached 90% at 4 to 6 weeks follow-up (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.37; p < .0001). The incidence of disturbance in mobility at discharge was reduced by 69% (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.65; p = .002).

One recent study reported worse angiographic and clinical outcomes in patients after endoscopic vein harvest. <sup>131</sup> Most studies, however, found no difference in the rates of myocardial infarction, recurrence of angina or reintervention, and death over the short- and mid-term follow-up. <sup>130,132</sup> However, the number of trials evaluating cardiac outcomes and providing angiographic data on patency rates is too limited to allow for any meaningful conclusion to be made. The few trials that assessed vascular integrity and vessel wall trauma did not find any difference between the two techniques. <sup>133,134</sup>

# **Endoscopic Radial Artery Harvest**

Use of the radial artery for CABG has regained popularity over the last decade and a half. Conventional radial artery harvest involves an incision that extends from approximately 1 cm distal to the antecubital fossa up to the wrist joint, along the medial border of the brachioradialis muscle. While wound complications are reported infrequently, delayed healing of the forearm can cause severe discomfort. Objective sensory loss in 10% of patients and forearm scar discomfort in 33% undergoing open radial artery harvest have been reported. Harvest have been developed subsequently.

#### SURGICAL TECHNIQUE

Collateral circulation from the ulnar artery to the palmar arch has to be verified pre- or intraoperatively using either the standard Allen's test or modification of the test by using an arterial Doppler or pulse oximetry, especially in patients in whom the signs of visual reperfusion are doubtful. In order to prevent brachial plexus injury, the arm should not be overextended (>90°). A 2 to 3 cm incision is made 1 cm superior to the radial styloid prominence and the radial artery is identified and dissected. A subcutaneous retractor and a 5 mm, 30° endoscope are inserted into the incision. The radial artery is visualized by bluntly advancing the retractor through the subcutaneous tissue. Side branches and surrounding tissue are divided using an ultrasonic harmonic or thermowelding scalpel that is placed underneath the retractor. The fascia between the brachioradialis and flexor carpi radialis muscles is divided anterior to the radial artery with the scalpel to increase the space for insertion of the subcutaneous retractor. 139 After division of all side branches, a vessel retractor is advanced from the distal incision to verify complete isolation of the conduit. The proximal radial artery is occluded using an Endoloop" or clipped distal to the origin of the ulnar artery branch and transected with endoscopic scissors. The graft is recovered through the distal incision, and the distal end is ligated. The incision is closed in a standard manner.

#### **RESULTS**

The reported incidence of neurologic complications after standard open technique of radial artery harvest vary in the literature between 2.4 and 30% and can be related to injury of the superficial radial or the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerves. The latter is usually not encountered in the endoscopic technique because the dissection is performed deep to the brachioradialis muscle. Superficial radial nerve injury, however, still may occur during distal dissection.<sup>139</sup> Endoscopic radial artery harvest is associated with a lower rate of wound infection (0-2.7%) as compared to the open technique.<sup>129,140</sup>

Graft patency, clinical outcomes, histological integrity, and in vitro vasoreactivity are similar to open graft harvest techniques. 141-143 Thus, endoscopic radial artery harvesting can be recommended for better patient satisfaction and fewer wound healing complications. 144
