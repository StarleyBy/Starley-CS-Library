### INTRODUCTION

Echocardiography plays an important role in cardiac surgery by defining myocardial structure, function, and intracardiac blood flow velocities. Preoperatively, transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography with color and spectral Doppler identify, quantify, and characterize cardiac disease and support decision making in terms of surgical timing and choices. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) provides high-fidelity assessment of underlying pathophysiology, guides beating heart procedures in real time, supports surgical planning, and, allows for timely assessment of the results of surgical procedures. Furthermore, TEE can be critical in the early postoperative period to elucidate various etiologies of perioperative hemodynamic instability, allowing surgeons and intensivists to identify and manage complications accurately and efficiently. Lastly, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is often employed to evaluate and monitor long-term surgical results due to its noninvasive nature.

It is important that surgeons appreciate the potential and the limitations of perioperative ultrasound to provide casespecific predictors and intraoperative procedural guidance to improve surgical outcomes and facilitate incorporation of new technologies into current practice.

The goals of this chapter are to provide a framework for understanding the technique, and its indications for use. We summarize American Society of Echocardiography/ Society of Cardiovascular Anesthiologists (ASE/SCA) guidelines for the surgical use of epicardial ultrasound, which can supplement or substitute for intraoperative TEE when TEE is contraindicated. Finally, we outline expectations that surgeons should have for intraoperative TEE images and interpretations.

### **BASIC PRINCIPLES**

Echocardiographic images are constructed by transmitting high-frequency sound waves into the chest from a transducer composed of piezo-electric crystals. These waves reflect off cardiac structures, and the returning signals are received by the same transducer. By knowing when the signal was sent, the speed of

the sound in the tissue, and the time it takes for the reflected signal to return to the transducer, the position of the structure responsible for the reflection can be calculated. An image from these signals can thus be created. The quality of the image relies on many factors, including the media through which the sound is traveling, the orientation of the structures in relation to the ultrasound beam, and the composition of the structure. Sound travels incredibly well through water and blood, reasonably well through tissue, but poorly through air. Therefore, the media through which the sound travels will determine the strength of the returning signal. When the ultrasound beam reflects off various portions of the heart, the signal is scattered in various directions such that some never return to the transducer. For this reason, structures that are perpendicular to the ultrasound beam and reflect stronger signals back to the transducer produce images of the most accuracy. On the other hand, strong reflectors such as calcified valvular leaflets will result in a bright picture but they also inevitably create imaging artifacts. The fact that sound transmitted from a TEE transducer has less distance to travel (which means less signal lost to scatter) and mainly travels through muscle and blood (and rarely air) explains why the quality of TEE images is usually better than TTE imaging.

Echocardiographic displays include M-mode, two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) imaging. The M-mode echocardiogram has superior temporal resolution and can be thought of as a display of the motion of a single cut through the heart over time. It is now used primarily to quantify the timing of intracardiac events. Two-dimensional echocardiography provides a display with better spatial resolution and excellent temporal resolution. Three-dimensional echocardiography provides the best display of the spatial relationships of various structures and flow patterns, and its resolution continues to improve.

Blood flow velocities are assessed by the Doppler principle. The wavelength of sound reflecting off moving blood particles will be shorter if blood is moving toward the transducer and longer, if moving away. By quantifying this change in frequency of the ultrasound beam, one can determine the blood velocity and direction. This calculation, however, is influenced by the angle between the ultrasound beam and the blood flow such that as this angle increases, the calculated velocity is lower

and less accurate. Thus the goal is to keep alignment of the beam as parallel to the blood flow as possible. As blood travels through a restrictive or stenotic region at a constant flow, its velocity will increase and the pressure gradient can be calculated from the simplified Bernoulli Equation ( $\Delta$ pressure = 4 × velocity<sup>2</sup>). The peak and mean pressure gradients are calculated from spectral Doppler techniques. Pulse wave (PW) Doppler has excellent spatial resolution, allowing the identification of the specific locations of flow disturbances such as obstructions or leaks. Continuous wave (CW) Doppler has excellent velocity resolution and identifies the highest velocity along the path of the ultrasound beam (which is assumed to occur at the narrowest region). Color-flow mapping displays the velocities and directions of flow determined by Doppler. This technique is valuable to identify and quantify regurgitation. However, it must be remembered that the color display of a regurgitant jet represents the velocity of the blood disturbed by the regurgitation and is *not* the volume of regurgitation as one would see on an angiogram. The color display of these jets is influenced by various echocardiography machine settings.

Doppler quantitation of velocities is dependent on one's hemodynamic profiles, and since these conditions are often different during anesthesia (compared to preoperative resting state), the pressure gradients obtained by spectral Doppler and the color Doppler display of regurgitant jets may differ significantly from preoperative assessments. Thus the decision to operate should be based on preoperative values.

Finally, the echocardiographic views of the heart required to assess different pathologies as well as the necessary components of a perioperative TEE have been established by expert consensus and serve as a roadmap to understand the basic TEE.<sup>1</sup>

## SAFETY OF INTRAOPERATIVE TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY

While TTE has some roles in the operating room, the dominant ultrasound modality for perioperative imaging is TEE. It has been in use in the operating room for over 30 years and has an excellent safety record. The incidence of complications in 7200 intraoperative TEEs performed at the Brigham and Women's Hospital was 0.2%, and no intraoperative TEE-associated mortality was noted. The most common complication was odynophagia severe enough to warrant esophagogastroduodenoscopy (0.1%) and this was followed by acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (0.03% including esophageal tear but not esophageal perforation), dental injury (0.03%), arterial desaturation due to malpositioning of endotracheal tube (0.03%), and esophageal perforation (0.01%). Unsuccessful TEE probe insertion occurred in 0.18% of cases and contraindications to TEE were noted in 0.5%.2 A smaller study has reported a higher rate of major upper gastrointestinal complications at 1.2% in patients undergoing intraoperative TEE with a significant proportion of the injuries manifesting greater than 24 hours after the procedure.<sup>3</sup> The reported TEE complication rate in pediatric cardiac surgical patients is higher at 2.4%.<sup>4</sup> As a reference, an older study of the complication rates in over 10,000 TEEs performed on conscious patients outside of the operating room reported an event rate similar to that of adult intraoperative patients (0.18%) however the types of complications differed and included one death.<sup>5</sup>

An important way to reduce complications, especially esophageal and gastric injury, is to prospectively recognize those patients who are at risk and avoid TEE in those with extensive esophageal and gastric diseases. Another key principle is to balance risk and benefit ratio carefully such that TEE is only performed when its benefits outweigh its risks. Absolute contraindications to TEE include perforated viscous, prior esophagectomy, and esophagogastrectomy. Relative contraindications to TEE include those with oropharyngeal cancer, preexisting esophageal pathologies (including varices, strictures, diverticula, esophagitis, Mallory-Weiss tears, radiation injury), and gastrointestinal pathologies (such as recent upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, gastric ulcer or symptomatic hiatal hernia).

### TRAINING AND QUALITY

Both cardiology and anesthesiology specialty and subspecialty societies have outlined recommendations for appropriate training required prior to independent performance of intraoperative TEE such as a minimum number of studies to maintain proficiency along with other benchmarks to guarantee imaging quality and practitioners' ability to interpret findings accurately. Some surgeons have taken part in these training and certification programs, and many Cardiothoracic (CT) surgical training programs are including imaging skills-training in the curriculum.

### SURGICAL USE OF EPICARDIAL ULTRASOUND

### **Epiaortic**

The cardiac surgical use of ultrasound in most practices is limited to epiaortic scanning prior to aortic cannulation. Evidence is strong that routine use, coupled with alterations in surgical approach in the setting of significant atheromatous changes, reduces morbid neurological outcomes. The Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists (SCA)/American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) Guidelines suggest measuring (1) maximal plaque height/thickness; (2) location of the maximal plaque within the ascending aorta; and (3) presence of mobile components in each of the three ascending aortic short axis segments and for the aortic arch. Figure 12-1 shows the guideline views. "Mid" is usually the aortic cross-clamp site, "distal" is usually the cannulation site.

### **Epicardial**

In addition to epiaortic scanning, the epicardial probe can be utilized to supplement intraoperative TEE assessment.

FIGURE 12-1 Short and long axis graphic of epiaortic scanning views.

The ASE guidelines assist surgeons in developing expertise in obtaining meaningful images when TEE is contraindicated. Figures 12-2 through 12-8 demonstrate the recommended views, which can be obtained in a setting of a median sternotomy incision. These ASE views serve as a general suggestion to help develop a user-dependent approach that is tailored to best suit each surgeon's individual practice.

It is suggested that surgeons take a few moments when they have the ultrasound probe in the surgical field to practice obtaining these standard ASE images. In the situation of a critical need for intraoperative ultrasound imaging when TEE is contraindicated (noted above in the section Safety of Intraoperative Transesophageal Echocardiography), a standard epicardial probe can be used if there is a full sternotomy. If there is a minimally invasive incision, placing the TEE probe in a sterile sheath filled with ultrasound gel can also provide excellent epicardial images of all structures from almost any small incision, which allows access to the pericardial space. However, in order for this to be most successful, the surgeon should practice along

heart. The same locations used in the ASE epicardial guidelines can be used, but relevant views can be obtained from many locations in the pericardial space.

Once the heart is closed and begins to beat at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass, pockets of air are often present in the left heart and the ascending aorta. Air can change locations quickly. The ability to precisely locate and evacuate air decreases the time from cross-clamp removal to successful weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass and decreases shortand long-term morbidity. Thus it behooves the surgeon to

understand how ultrasound imaging can guide this process. The specific views most likely to eludicate air pockets are the left atrial dome view, left and right superior pulmonary vein views, left atrial appendage view, and LV apex and LV septal wall views. Figure 12-9 shows all of these views from the TEE window, but the information can also be obtained by the surgeon using an epicardial probe in the event that TEE is not available.

## USE OF ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY IN PREOPERATIVE ASSESSMENT OF SPECIFIC CARDIAC DISEASES

### **Coronary Artery Disease**

Echocardiography diagnoses the presence of ischemic heart disease by demonstrating resting LV wall motion abnormalities or inducing new regional wall dysfunction with stress modalities.

The ASE recommends a 16-segment model for the assessment and description of segmental LV wall motion. <sup>13</sup> This model divides the LV basal and mid-ventricular short axis views in a clockwise fashion into anterior, anterolateral, lateral, inferolateral, inferior, inferoseptal and anteroseptal segments. The apex is divided into anterior, lateral, inferior and septal segments (Fig. 12-10). A 17-segment model also exists where there is an additional apical cap to assess myocardial perfusion.

![](_page_5_Figure_6.jpeg)

**FIGURE 12-10** Echocardiography segments of the left ventricle. Orientation of the apical four-chamber, apical two chamber and apical long axis views in relation to the bull's eye display of the LV segments. (Reproduced with permission from Lang RM, Badano LP, Mor-Avi V, et al: Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging, *J Am Soc Echocardiogr* 2015 Jan;28(1):1-39.)

To assess wall motion, each segment is evaluated in multiple views and reported to be (1) normal or hyperkinetic (normal or enhanced wall thickening), (2) hypokinetic (reduced thickening), (3) akinetic (absent or negligible thickening), or (4) dyskinetic (systolic thinning or bulging).<sup>13</sup>

Resting regional hypokinesis is indicative of ischemia or infarction in a specific coronary artery distribution that supplies the particular segment. Myocardial infarction with scar appears as a thin, highly reflective or bright, akinetic segment. An aneurysm is a thin dyskinetic segment that has a distorted diastolic shape and bulges outward in systole.

### STRESS ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY

Stress echocardiography diagnoses and localizes obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) and is performed with exercise or pharmacological agents. Exercise with supine bicycle or treadmill is physiologic and always preferred to pharmacological stress testing. Patients unable to exercise may be stressed with inotropic drugs (dobutamine), vasodilator agents (adenosine or dipyridamole) or a combination of these. Stress echocardiography has a specificity of 76% and sensitivity of 88%, which are comparable to nuclear stress modalities.<sup>14</sup>

In a normal stress test, there is a hyperdynamic response with an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), decrease in LV cavity size, and absence of new regional wall motion abnormalities. A positive stress test demonstrates new inducible wall motion abnormality in the ischemic segment with stress. Decreases in global LVEF and LV dilatation suggest the presence of severe obstructive CAD such as multivessel CAD or severe left main stenosis. <sup>15</sup>

Intravenous echocardiographic contrast agents can be used to enhance endocardial definition, hence increasing the sensitivity of stress echocardiography for the diagnosis of ischemic heart disease.

### MYOCARDIAL VIABILITY

Low-dose dobutamine stress echocardiography is utilized to identify viable myocardium that is stunned or hibernating, and has the potential to recover after revascularization. Viable segments are hypokinetic at rest and typically demonstrate a "biphasic response" with an initial improvement of myocardial contractility with low-dose dobutamine infusion (2.5 to 10 mcg/kg/min). However, at higher doses of dobutamine (20 to 40 mcg/kg/min), the segmental wall motion deteriorates and appears similar or worse than at rest. There is a strong association between myocardial viability on noninvasive testing and improved survival after revascularization in patients with chronic CAD and LV dysfunction. <sup>16</sup> An area that fails to augment is indicative of a nonviable segment or scar.

### MECHANICAL COMPLICATIONS OF ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE

Patients with acute myocardial infarction who develop hemodynamic instability should have an echocardiogram as soon as possible to differentiate mechanical complications that require urgent surgical intervention, from cardiogenic shock secondary to primary 'pump' failure.

### RUPTURE OF LEFT VENTRICULAR FREE WALL AND PSEUDOANEURYSM

Rupture of the LV free wall is the second leading cause of in-hospital death, after cardiogenic shock in the setting of an acute myocardial infarction. It is usually associated with a first transmural (usually large anterior) infarct, but not infrequently it can also occur in a small area of lateral necrosis. Acute rupture is catastrophic and rapidly fatal, with death ensuing from cardiac tamponade and pulseless electrical activity. Subacute rupture is a gradual and incomplete rupture of the infarcted area with slow or repetitive bleeding into the pericardial sac causing hemopericardium, which typically occurs through small intramyocardial communications. 17 This leads to a moderate to large pericardial effusion, with or without features of tamponade. Often thrombus forms in the myocardial channels that communicate with the pericardial space, which prevents continued rupture. Thrombus in the pericardial space can be observed as a mass of echoes.

A postmyocardial infarction (post-MI) LV pseudoaneurysm is a rupture of the ventricular free wall contained by local pericardial adhesions or organized thrombus. Echocardiography identifies a narrow neck of the pseudoaneurysm and often spectral and color Doppler imaging shows flow through the communication between the LV and the pericardium.

### VENTRICULAR SEPTAL RUPTURE (VSR)

Post myocardial infarction VSRs are uncommon but associated are with high mortality and usually occur in a large transmural, index infarct. Approximately 50 to 66% of postinfarction VSRs occur in anterior infarctions with the rest seen in inferior infarctions. 18,19 A VSR after an anterior MI most often occurs in the distal 1/3 of the septum whereas an inferior MI is associated with rupture of the basal inferior septum. Off-axis 2D and color Doppler imaging are useful, especially to demonstrate the RV exit site (Fig. 12-11). The size of the defect and the pressure difference between the ventricles determine the amount of shunting, which in turns influences mortality. Three-dimensional echocardiography can visualize the defect *en face* to demonstrate the precise location of the rupture and provide size measurements. This can be helpful in determining the suitability of percutaneous device versus surgical closure.<sup>20</sup>

### ACUTE MITRAL REGURGITATION (MR)

Acute mitral regurgitation (MR) in the setting of infarction is caused by papillary muscle infarction or rupture. It is usually associated with an inferior infarct as the posteromedial papillary muscle has a single blood supply from the posterior descending artery, whereas the anterolateral papillary muscle has dual blood supply from the left anterior descending artery and the left circumflex artery. Two-dimensional echocardiography demonstrates a flail segment of the mitral valve. The ruptured head of the papillary muscle or corresponding

chords may be seen moving randomly within the LV cavity (Fig. 12-12).

Color Doppler can underestimate the severity of acute MR. Due to rapid equalization of left atrial (LA) and LV pressures, coupled with tachycardia and the usually small LA size, the MR jet area can be of short duration and appear deceptively small. Assessment by vena contracta width remains

reliable in this setting. Pulmonary venous systolic flow reversal is a feature which supports the presence of acute severe MR.<sup>21</sup> Assessment with TEE can provide a more definitive diagnosis.

### RIGHT VENTRICULAR INFARCTION

Echocardiography is a valuable diagnostic test for RV infarction. The most common features of RV infarction include inferior MI and hemodynamic compromise, often associated with jugular distension and absence of pulmonary edema. RV involvement is associated with higher mortality, arrhythmias, shock and mechanical complications. <sup>22</sup> Echocardiographic signs of RV infarction include RV dilatation and decreased RV free wall function. Impaired function is demonstrated by reduced tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE < 17 mm), and decreased tricuspid annular systolic velocity measured by Doppler tissue imaging (S' velocity < 9.5 cm/s). <sup>13,23</sup> Signs of elevated right atrial (RA) pressure include a dilated inferior vena cava (IVC) that does not collapse >50% on inspiration or bowing of the interatrial septum towards the left.

### Mitral Valve Disease

Echocardiography of the mitral valve (MV) includes evaluation of the valvular leaflets, mechanism and grading of severity of mitral stenosis (MS) and mitral regurgitation (MR), and assessment of the effects on the LA and LV. Specifically

this includes 2D imaging of leaflet thickness, mobility, coaptation geometry and area, LA size, LV size and function, spectral and color Doppler, valvular gradients, valvular area, and RV systolic pressure (RVSP).

### Mitral Regurgitation

### **ETIOLOGY OF MR**

MR can be classified into organic (primary) or functional (secondary). Organic MR is caused by intrinsic valvular disease whereas functional MR occurs as a result of regional or global left ventricular remodeling.

### ORGANIC (PRIMARY) MR

The most common cause of MR in the industrialized world is degenerative MV disease. The spectrum of conditions ranges from fibroelastic deficiency causing isolated prolapsed segments due to chordal rupture, to extensive myxomatous disease affecting all segments of the valvular leaflets. The former is most often seen in the older population whilst the latter in younger patients.

Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is defined by displacement of the body of the leaflets by more than 2 mm behind the annular plane, measured in a long axis view (parasternal or apical views). Due to the saddle shape of the normal mitral annulus with its lowest points anteriorly and posteriorly, assessment in the apical four-chamber view which depicts the medial and lateral MV annulus is not recommended as this can lead to a false diagnosis of MVP.<sup>24</sup>

Flail leaflet is a common sequel of myxomatous disease and occurs due to ruptured chordae. The posterior leaflet (usually middle or P2 scallop) is predominantly affected, resulting in anteriorly directed MR. On echocardiography, the flail portion of the leaflet will exhibit excessive motion and the leaflet tip is displaced into the LA beyond the mitral annular plane (Fig. 12-13).

Other less common causes of primary MR include rheumatic heart disease, infective endocarditis, mitral valve cleft (in conjunction with a partial atrioventricular septal defect, or rarely in isolation), connective tissue diseases, and radiation induced heart disease. Of note, rheumatic mitral regurgitation is caused by commissural thickening, leaflet motion restriction, and loss of central coaptation. This is often accompanied by a degree of stenosis.

#### **ACUTE MR**

Acute MR can be assessed by echocardiography and occurs due to disruption of the MV complex. Leaflet destruction or perforation occurs in infective endocarditis. Chordal rupture can be associated with endocarditis, but is more often seen in degenerative mitral valve disease. Papillary muscle dysfunction (rupture or ischemia) occurs with MI (usually the inferior territory). Due to the acute nature of the MR, the LV and LA sizes are often normal. LV systolic function is normal or hyperdynamic, except when the acute MR is due to myocardial ischemia.

### **FUNCTIONAL (SECONDARY) MR**

In functional (or secondary) MR, the mitral valve leaflets and subvalvular apparatus are structurally normal. The MR occurs as a result of LV remodeling from previous infarction or nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Regional or global LV dilatation and remodeling leads to displacement of the papillary muscles, stretching of chordae and subsequent leaflet tethering. The coaptation zone of the mitral valve leaflets is displaced apically and there is incomplete closure of the mitral valve. Dilation of the mitral annulus also contributes to functional MR (Fig. 12-14).

Regional infarction (particularly of the inferoposterior territory) and subsequent local remodeling leads to unbalanced tethering forces that cause asymmetric closure of the valvular

leaflets. In such cases, the anterior leaflet tip may appear to prolapse relative to the tethered posterior leaflet, resulting in a posteriorly directed MR jet. In patients who develop diffuse LV dysfunction and global LV dilation either from ischemic or nonischemic causes, the papillary muscle displacement is more symmetric and the resultant MR is centrally directed.

Carpentier has developed a functional classification to reflect the pathological changes based on leaflet motion that caused MR: normal, excessive, restricted diastolic and restricted systolic motion.<sup>25</sup> (Table 12-1) Both TTE and TEE can be used to identify these patterns.

### ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC ASSESSMENT OF SEVERITY OF MR

The timing for intervention in MR is largely driven by symptoms and the impact of the volume load on LV size and function. Thus, accurate assessment of the severity of MR and the associated hemodynamic consequences is critical. Typical methods and supporting parameters are shown in Table 12-2.

Assessment of severity requires the integration of both qualitative and quantitative methods to minimize the effect of technical or measurement errors. For example, the severity of MR by color Doppler can be influenced by blood pressure, and MR can appear less severe during TEE compared to TTE, especially when lowered blood pressure is secondary to sedation or general anesthesia.

### **COLOR FLOW DOPPLER**

Assessment of the regurgitant jet size and extent into the LA by color flow Doppler is the easiest and most common way to qualitatively assess the severity of MR. Generally speaking, an MR jet area >40% of the LA is consistent with severe MR.<sup>21</sup> However, this method is dependent on multiple hemodynamic and technical factors. For example, the driving blood pressure, machine settings such as gain or velocity scale, and regurgitant jet direction will all influence the appearance of the regurgitant jet area. When it comes to regurgitant jet direction, if MR jets are directed towards the wall of the

#### VENA CONTRACTA WIDTH

The vena contracta is the region of the jet as it exits the regurgitant orifice. When quantified it is an indirect measure of the effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA) and this measurement is less subject to the factors affecting display of the color jet area. The VC is typically measured at the narrowest portion of the MR jet just beyond the coaptation line (Fig. 12-15). When measured as a linear dimension, it is assumed that the regurgitant orifice area is circular; however

![](_page_10_Figure_21.jpeg)

**FIGURE 12-15** Vena contracta measurement in MR. The vena contracta is measured at the narrowest portion of the MR jet just beyond the coaptation line (*red double-beaded arrow*). A measurement greater than 7 mm is consistent with severe MR.

VC has been found to often be elliptical in functional MR. A VC of >7 mm is consistent with severe MR. Intermediate values (3 to 7 mm) need confirmation by other quantitative methods.

### FLOW CONVERGENCE/PROXIMAL ISOVELOCITY SURFACE AREA

Quantitative parameters that assess MR severity include EROA, regurgitant volume (R Vol) and regurgitant fraction. These can be calculated by the proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) method with echocardiography.

This method relies on the fact that the regurgitant flow at the regurgitant orifice is equal to the product of the cross-section area (CSA =  $2\pi r^2$ ) of the flow and the peak velocity of the flow (peak MR vel). By adjusting the Nyquist limit (the velocity at which the signal is aliased) towards the direction of the regurgitant jet, a flow convergence zone in the LV with radius r can be depicted and measured.

Assuming that the flow converges onto the regurgitant orifice in an axis-symmetric fashion, the flow of this zone can be identified as  $2\pi r^2 \times$  aliasing velocity ( $V_a$ ) and will also be equal to the flow through the valve. This can be expressed as the product of the EROA and the peak velocity of the MR CW Doppler profile. Rearranging this continuity of flow relation yields:

EROA = 
$$(2\pi r^2 \times V)$$
/peak MR vel

Since stroke volume is quantified as the product of the cross-sectional area and the velocity time integral of the CW MR velocity profile (VTI $_{\rm MR}$ ), the regurgitant volume (R Vol) is expressed as

R Vol (cc) = EROA (cm
$$^{2}$$
) × VTI<sub>MR</sub> (cm)

Qualitatively, the presence of flow convergence on TTE at a Nyquist limit of 50 to 60 cm/s should alert the surgeon to the presence of significant MR and prompt an assessment by quantitative method. The two-dimensional isovelocity surface area (2D PISA) approach is performed in either the four- or three-chamber view (Fig. 12-16).

### OTHER ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC METHODS TO QUANTIFY MR

The regurgitant fraction can be calculated from stroke volume calculations if there is no aortic regurgitation present. The regurgitant fraction is the ratio of the volume of MR to the mitral inflow stroke volume. The volume of MR is the difference between the mitral inflow stroke volume and the aortic outflow stroke volume. The stroke volumes are calculated as the product of cross-sectional area (CSA) and velocity time integral (VTI) of flow. Thus, the volume of MR is the difference between (1) the product of the cross-sectional area of the mitral annulus and (2) the product of the cross-sectional area of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) and the VTI at the LVOT.

Direct measurement of the EROA by 3D planimetry of the vena contracta is feasible, does not require geometric or flow assumptions, and may improve the accuracy of MR grading when compared to the 2D PISA method.<sup>27</sup> However, due to technical limitations such as spatial resolution, 3D

color Doppler to date is used only in TEE and mainly for research applications.

### OTHER SUPPORTIVE PARAMETERS

Adjunctive parameters help consolidate determination of the severity of MR when there is discrepancy between the quantified degree of MR and the clinical context.

Systolic reversal of flow in pulmonary veins as assessed by pulse wave Doppler is a reliable marker of severe MR. Blunting alone of systolic flow can accompany mitral regurgitation of increasing severity, but this phenomenon also occurs in atrial fibrillation, increasing age and diastolic dysfunction or other causes of elevated left atrial pressure. Therefore blunting of the pulmonary venous systolic flow lacks specificity for severe MR.

MR of increasing severity leads to increased transmitral forward flow in early diastole, reflected by an elevated E velocity. In the absence of mitral stenosis (MS), a peak E velocity of >1.5 m/s is suggestive of severe MR, whereas the presence of a dominant A wave excludes it. This feature however lacks specificity since anything that raises LA pressure can lead to increased E velocity.

Severe MR produces a dense CW Doppler signal intensity. The CW display of MR velocity can demonstrate a "cut-off" sign, appearing more triangular than parabolic (reflecting the effect of the MR on LA pressure). It may be difficult to capture the full envelope of the MR jet in eccentrically directed MR despite the relatively dense velocity signal.

### ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC QUANTIFICATION OF SEVERE MR

The quantification of severity in functional MR can be difficult. In patients with *functional* MR, adverse outcomes are associated with a smaller calculated EROA compared to *organic* MR. Functional MR will progress due to associated progressive LV systolic dysfunction from the underlying myopathic process and adverse remodeling. There is also

an underestimation of EROA by the 2D echocardiography derived flow convergence method due to the fact that the regurgitant orifice may not be circular. Hence, the threshold to define severe functional MR is lower than that used for organic MR. An EROA  $\geq 40~\text{mm}^2$  or R Vol  $\geq 60~\text{mL}$  indicates severe organic MR while an EROA  $\geq 20~\text{mm}^2$  or R Vol  $\geq 30~\text{mL}$  identifies patients at risk of increased cardiovascular events with functional MR (Table 12-3).

### HEMODYNAMIC CONSEQUENCES AND PROG-NOSTIC FACTORS OF SEVERE MR

In order to maintain forward stroke volume in chronic significant MR, the LV end diastolic volume increases in response to volume overload. This, in turn, leads to an increased LVEF.

### TABLE 12-3: Echocardiographic Signs of Severe MR

- ERO  $\geq 0.4$  cm<sup>2</sup> (organic MR),  $\geq 0.2$  cm<sup>2</sup> (functional MR)
- Vena contracta ≥ 0.7 cm
- Regurgitant volume ≥ 60 mL (organic MR), ≥ 30 mL (functional MR)
- Regurgitant fraction ≥ 50%

(Data from Lancellotti P, Tribouilloy C, Hagendorff A, et al: Recommendations for the echocardiographic assessment of native valvular regurgitation: an executive summary from the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging, Eur Heart J Cardiovasc Imaging 2013 Jul;14(7):611-644; Nishimura RA, Otto CM, Bonow RO, et al: 2014 AHA/ACC guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American College of Cardiology/ American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines, J Am Coll Cardiol 2014 Jun 10;63(22):e57-e185.)

A "normal" LVEF in MR is approximately 70%. Over time, as LV contractility declines, the LV end systolic volume also increases, leading to a reduction in LVEF. Once the LVEF declines below 60%, or when the LV end systolic dimension is >40 mm, this suggests the onset of LV dysfunction, even though the LVEF is still in the normal range. LA dilation also occurs with MR of significant severity (except in acute MR), and therefore the presence of LA dilation suggests chronicity.

In primary MR, negative prognostic features include presence of symptoms, onset of LV dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery systolic pressure >50 mm Hg) and onset of new atrial fibrillation.<sup>29,30</sup> Thus these findings are triggers for mitral valve surgery in the 2014 American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines (Fig. 12-17).

Mitral valve surgery is a Class I recommendation for chronic severe primary MR and LV dysfunction: LVEF > 30% in symptomatic patients, and LVEF 30 to 60% +/– left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD)  $\geq$  40 mm in asymptomatic patients. In asymptomatic nonrheumatic MR, a resting pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) of

>50 mm Hg or new onset atrial fibrillation (AF) is a Class IIa indication for mitral valve repair.

### TEE IN MITRAL REGURGITATION

TTE alone is often helpful in determining the etiology of MR. TEE enables a more detailed and precise anatomic assessment of the mitral valve and should be utilized in more complex lesions or when further anatomic information is required about the mitral valve complex to assist in surgical planning. The proximity of the TEE probe to the mitral valve and the higher imaging frequency result in much improved resolution, which provides a more accurate and higher quality assessment of the vena contracta and PISA. Interrogation of flow in all four pulmonary veins is generally feasible with TEE.

TEE is also particularly useful in infective endocarditis where other potential infected structures can be fully assessed. Three-dimensional echocardiography is widely used as it displays the *en face* "surgeon's view" of the mitral valve and enables direct visualization of mitral valve pathology.

### EXERCISE ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY IN MITRAL REGURGITATION

Exercise echocardiography may prove helpful when symptoms or degree of LV and LA enlargement are out of proportion to the magnitude of MR on a resting TTE. Worsening MR severity, marked increase in pulmonary arterial pressure (PASP > 60 mm Hg during exercise), impaired exercise ability and symptoms during exercise echocardiography identify patients who may benefit from early surgery.<sup>28</sup>

### Mitral Stenosis

The majority of cases of mitral stenosis (MS) are due to rheumatic heart disease. Other less common causes include functional stenosis from severe mitral annular calcification, LA myxoma, congenital mitral stenosis (parachute mitral valve), drug induced valvulopathy, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

#### **ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC FEATURES**

Rheumatic MS has classic appearances on echocardiography. Thickening of leaflet tips with relative sparing of the midportion and fusion of the commissures leads to a doming or "hockey stick" appearance of the length of the anterior leaflet in diastole, which is best seen in the parasternal long axis view. The posterior leaflet is also thickened and restricted in motion. Commissural thickening and fusion is best appreciated in the short axis view. The subvalvular apparatus, mainly the chordae tendinae, are also thickened and may demonstrate calcification and fusion (Fig. 12-18).

Significant mitral annular calcification is seen in the elderly population. When the annular calcification is bulky enough to reduce the annular area or it extends onto the mitral valve leaflets reducing their excursion, increased diastolic gradients, particular during atrial contraction, are noted across the mitral valve. In these cases, the reduced orifice is most often at the base of the mitral leaflets as opposed to the leaflet tips,

(C) Continuous wave Doppler spectral pattern showing the peak and mean gradients across the stenotic mitral valve. A mean gradient of 16 mm Hg is consistent with severe mitral stenosis.

and the pressure half-time method used to calculate valve area for rheumatic MS cannot be reliably applied.

### ASSESSMENT OF SEVERITY OF MITRAL STENOSIS

Anatomic Assessment. The normal MV area (MVA) in adults is 4 to 5 cm². The 2014 AHA/ACC guidelines for valvular heart disease define a MVA of ≤1.5 cm² as severe MS and <1 cm² as very severe MS.³¹ This area can be measured directly from echocardiographic images by planimetry in the short axis view. Care must be taken to ensure that the planimetry is performed at the level of the leaflet tips where the orifice is narrowest during the time point where this orifice is the largest in early diastole. Three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography permits proper alignment of the leaflet tips to ensure the most accurate measurement of the MVA.³²

**Doppler Assessment.** The mean transmitral gradient is the single-most important factor in describing the severity of MS (mild < 5 mm Hg, moderate 5 to 10 mm Hg, severe >10 mm Hg).<sup>33</sup>

The mean and peak gradients are easily obtained from the mitral inflow CW Doppler signal. However, these measurements are also influenced by heart rate, loading conditions, and stroke volume. With tachycardia, there is reduced diastolic filling time, which leads to an elevation in mean gradient.

The most common Doppler method to calculate MVA is the pressure half-time in milliseconds (PHT), which is the time required for the transmitral pressure gradient to decay to half its value. It has a linear relationship with the MVA; the more severe the MS, the longer the pressure half-time:

$$MVA (cm^2) = 220/PHT (ms)$$

The constant of 220 is the net compliance constant and is derived empirically in a group of patients with mitral stenosis. Although easy to obtain, PHT measurements can be unreliable in tachycardia or atrial fibrillation (average of 5 beats recommended). PHT is also significantly affected by decreased LV compliance, which results in more rapid equilibration of

LA and LV pressures in diastole, leading to a shorter PHT and overestimation of the MVA if the constant of 220 is utilized. For this reason, MVA by PHT can be less reliable in patients with advancing age, hypertension, diabetes, and aortic stenosis. Also in the hours immediately following balloon mitral valvuloplasty, the net compliance constant is not accurately represented by the constant of 220.

MVA by the continuity method can be measured in the absence of MR or aortic regurgitation (AR):

$$MVA = SV_{LVOT}/VTI_{MS}$$

The PISA method, which requires an angle correction to account for the funnel shape of the accelerating mitral valve inflow in MS, is seldom used in clinical practice.

Transesophageal Echocardiography in Mitral Stenosis. A high-quality TTE is often sufficient for the diagnosis and quantification of mitral stenosis. TEE however has incremental value for assessment of associated left atrial body or appendage thrombus, or if TTE images of the valve are suboptimal.

**Severe MS**. Severe MS is defined by a series of echocardiographic variables. These include: a mitral valve area < 1.5 cm², a mean gradient > 10 mm Hg, a diastolic pressure half time ≥ 150 ms and an RV systolic pressure > 50 mm Hg.

Mitral Stenosis Valve Morphology Score. Percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty (PMBV) is considered first-line therapy when intervention is indicated in mitral stenosis. Mitral valve surgery is generally reserved for patients who are unsuitable candidates for or fail PMBV. Features favoring surgical interventions include moderate-to-severe MR, extensive leaflet and subvalvular thickening, fibrosis and calcification.

The valvular morphology or Wilkins' score is most commonly used in TTE to assess four components of the mitral valve and the summed score describes suitability for PMBV (Table 12-4).<sup>34</sup> A Wilkins' score of >8 and/or presence of moderate MR suggests that the valve will have a low probability of PMBV success and a surgical approach is advisable.

### TABLE 12-4: Wilkins' Score to Assess Suitability for Percutaneous Mitral Balloon Valvuloplasty

| Grade | Leaflet mobility                                                        | Subvalvular thickening                         | Leaflet thickening                                | Leaflet calcification                                           |

Stress Echocardiography in Mitral Stenosis. The 2014 AHA/ACC guidelines recommend exercise testing with Doppler to evaluate the response of the mean mitral gradient and pulmonary artery pressure in patients with MS when there is a discrepancy between resting Doppler echocardiographic findings and clinical symptoms or signs.<sup>31</sup> Intervention can be considered if there is a rise in right ventricular systolic pressure to >60 to 70 mm Hg with exercise.

### **Aortic Valve Disease**

### **AORTIC STENOSIS**

Echocardiographic imaging of the stenotic aortic valve includes assessment of the valvular leaflet morphology, motion and thickness, description of the presence and location of calcification, measurement of the aortic root and ascending aorta, as well as quantification of LV function and wall thickness. This is followed by Doppler assessment of the severity of stenosis and the presence or absence of concomitant aortic regurgitation.

**Etiology.** The most common causes of aortic stenosis (AS) in the developed world are degenerative calcification of a trileaflet valve, or accelerated calcification of a bicuspid valve. Rheumatic AS is more prevalent in the developing world.

A bicuspid aortic valve affects approximately one percent of the population. The most common form involves fusion of the right and left coronary cusps (70-86%) with commissures observed in a horizontal position. This is followed by fusion of the right and noncoronary cusps (~12%) with commissures seen in the vertical orientation.<sup>35</sup> Fusion of the left and noncoronary cusps is seen rarely. The diagnosis of bicuspid valve is made in the short axis view in systole where an elliptical orifice formed by two unequally sized leaflets is present. However, when a raphe (fusion line of two leaflets) is present, the diastolic echocardiographic image may mimic the presence of a third leaflet. In the long axis view, the bicuspid aortic valve demonstrates an asymmetric closure line, systolic doming and, often, diastolic prolapse of the valvular leaflets. Since aortopathy is associated with bicuspid aortic valve, assessment of the aortic root and ascending aorta dimensions is necessary. Unicuspid and quadricuspid valves are rare causes of AS. Unicuspid valves usually have a posteriorly positioned commissure.<sup>36</sup>

Rheumatic AS results in commissural fusion and a narrowed triangular systolic orifice. Calcification is most prominent along the edges of the cusps. Aortic regurgitation and mitral involvement are common associations with rheumatic AS.

Subvalvular and Supravalvular Obstruction. Subvalvular and supravalvular AS are identified by 2D echocardiography and further characterized by Doppler velocity. Subvalvular obstruction may be fixed or dynamic. The former is seen in the form of a congenital discrete membrane or muscle band in the LVOT and the peak velocity typically occurs in mid-systole. A common cause of dynamic obstruction is

hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, where the obstruction usually occurs later in systole. In such cases, the CW Doppler systolic velocity profile appears late peaking or "dagger" shaped. Supravalvular obstruction is rare and typically a congenital condition. It is seen in adults as a recurrent or persistent discrete constriction at the superior aspect of the sinuses of Valsalva, or as a diffuse narrowing of the ascending aorta.<sup>37</sup>

Assessment of Severity of Aortic Stenosis by Echocardiography. Doppler methods to assess the hemodynamic severity of aortic stenosis include the maximum transvalvular velocity ( $V_{\max}$ ) and calculation of the peak and mean pressure gradients. The aortic valve area (AVA) is typically calculated by the continuity equation.<sup>33</sup>

Maximum Velocity and Gradients. The maximum transvalvular velocity is measured using CW Doppler. The velocities across the aortic valve are assessed from multiple transducer positions including apical, suprasternal, and right parasternal locations to ensure that the highest velocity is recorded. Velocities from three beats are averaged in sinus rhythm and at least five beats in irregular rhythms. Postextra systolic beats are not measured. In more severe obstruction, the maximum velocity occurs later in systole and the CW Doppler profile assumes a more rounded shape, reflecting a higher gradient throughout systole.

The peak instantaneous gradient is calculated using the simplified Bernoulli equation:

$$\Delta P = 4(V_{max})^2$$

The mean gradient is typically calculated using a measurement program on the echocardiography machine, which averages the instantaneous gradients over the ejection period.

Aortic Valve Area (AVA). A normal AVA is 3 to 4 cm<sup>2</sup> and one definition of severe AS is an AVA less than 1 cm<sup>2</sup>. The AVA can be indexed to BSA, with a value  $\leq 0.6$  cm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup> considered severe AS in children, adolescents, and small adults (BSA < 1.5 m<sup>2</sup>, BMI < 22).<sup>33</sup> Indexing to BSA is less applicable to obese patients.

The AVA is calculated based on the concept of continuity of flow: the stroke volume (SV) ejected through the LVOT is equal to the SV that passes though the stenotic aortic valve (Fig. 12-19).

Stroke volume is the product of the VTI of the Dopplerderived flow velocity profile and the CSA of the structure at the level the velocity profile is obtained:

$$SV = CSA \times VTI$$

Continuity of flow is represented by

$$SV_{AV} = SV_{LVOT}$$
 or  $CSA_{AV} \times VTI_{AV} = CSA_{LVOT} \times VTI_{LVOT}$ 

Solving for the AVA (CSA<sub>AV</sub>) yields:

$$AVA = (CSA_{LVOT} \times VTI_{LVOT})/VTI_{AV}$$

![](_page_16_Figure_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 12-19** Aortic stenosis. (A) Measurement of the LVOT diameter (arrow) is usually performed in the parasternal long axis TTE view. (B) Morphology of the aortic valve is determined in the parasternal short axis TTE view. This image shows a calcified trileaflet aortic valve with severe stenosis. (C) Pulse wave Doppler profile with the cursor placed in the LVOT in the apical five-chamber view to obtain the VTI. (D) Continuous wave Doppler profile across the aortic valve reveals a maximum velocity of 4.4 m/s, consistent with severe stenosis. Calculation of the aortic valve area:  $CSA_{LVOT} = \pi(2.2/2)^2 = 3.8 \text{ cm}^2$ . AVA =  $3.8 \times 22.8/97.1 = 0.89 \text{ cm}^2$ .

The CSA of the LVOT is assumed to be circular and calculated using the equation for area of a circle:

$$CSA_{IVOT} = \pi (D/2)^2$$

where D is diameter of the LVOT measured in early systole. Of note, often the peak velocity is substituted for the VTI.

Accurate measurement of the LVOT diameter is of utmost importance. Since this parameter is squared for the calculation of the CSA<sub>LVOT</sub>, deviations in measurement lead to significant errors in the AVA. For example, an under- or over-estimation of a 2-cm LVOT diameter by 5% (1 mm) will result in a 10% error in the LVOT area and AVA. Other potential errors include inaccurate measurement of LVOT or peak AV flow velocity profile when obtained at a nonparallel intercept angle, and failure to interrogate maximum AV velocity from multiple windows to obtain the highest velocity.

One approach that reduces potential sources of error related to inaccurate measurement of the LVOT diameter

is to remove the CSA from the equation. The dimensionless index expresses the size of the valvular effective orifice area as a proportion of the  $CSA_{LVOT}$ . This index can be calculated using a peak velocity ratio<sup>33</sup> or VTI ratio:

Dimensionless index =  $V_{LVOT}/V_{AV}$  or  $VTI_{LVOT}/VTI_{AV}$ 

A dimensionless index of ≤0.25 indicates severe stenosis, corresponding to a valvular area 25% of the normal.<sup>38</sup>

AVA by planimetry is not routinely performed as it can be technically challenging to identify the minimum orifice area at the valvular tips, particularly when extensive calcification is present. Moreover, it is the effective orifice area rather than the anatomic orifice area that is the primary predictor of outcome in severe AS. However, during intra-operative TEE when it may be difficult to obtain accurate LVOT and AV velocities, planimetry can be used as a measure of stenosis.<sup>39</sup>

The 2014 AHA/ACC guidelines classify symptomatic severe AS into three groups: severe high-gradient AS, low

### **TABLE 12-5: Classifications of Severe AS**

(classical AS)

- Severe high gradient AS AVA  $\leq 1$  cm<sup>2</sup> (or AVAi < 0.6 cm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>) but may be larger with mixed AS/AR
  - Or a ortic  $V_{max} \ge 4 \text{ m/s}$
  - Or mean gradient ≥ 40 mm Hg

Low flow low gradient AS with reduced LVEF (LVEF < 50%)

- AVA  $\leq 1$  cm<sup>2</sup> with resting a ortic  $V_{max}$ <4 m/s or resting mean gradient <40 mm Hg
- Or with dobutamine inotropic stimulation to increase stroke volume, the resultant is AVA  $\leq 1$  cm<sup>2</sup> with  $V_{max}$

Low gradient AS with normal LVEF (paradoxical low flow AS)

- AVA  $\leq 1$  cm<sup>2</sup> with  $V_{max} < 4$  m/s or mean gradient < 40 mm Hg
- Indexed AVA  $\leq 0.6 \text{ cm}^2/\text{m}^2$  and
- Stroke volume index < 35 mL/m<sup>2</sup>
- Measured when patient is normotensive (systolic BP < 140 mm Hg)

flow low gradient (LFLG) severe AS with reduced LVEF, and low-gradient severe AS with normal LVEF (or paradoxical low flow AS).<sup>31</sup> Echocardiographic definitions for each class are shown in Table 12-5.

Identification of Severe Aortic Stenosis by Echocardiography. The traditionally well-accepted definition of severe AS is based on the natural history of AS without surgical intervention. Prognosis was shown to be poor with  $V_{max} > 4$ m/s, which corresponds to a mean gradient of > 40 mm Hg. 40 The prognosis of patients was also poorer when AVA < 1 cm<sup>2</sup>.<sup>41</sup> These patients are classified as severe high-gradient AS.

However, a proportion of patients with severe AS have a low velocity and pressure gradient, that is,  $V_{max}$  < 4 m/s and mean gradient < 40 mm Hg, despite a calculated AVA of <1 cm<sup>2</sup>. This typically occurs in the setting of decreased LVEF and SV. It is estimated that 5 to 10% of patients with severe AS have LFLG severe AS related to a decrease in LVEF. These patients typically have a dilated LV with markedly decreased LV systolic function due to concurrent ischemic heart disease, other cardiomyopathy and/or secondary to chronic pressure overload from the AS.42 It is important to ascertain that the calculated low AVA is due to true severe AS, as opposed to pseudo-AS as the former benefits from AVR. In both situations, there is low flow due to the low LVEF, resulting in low  ${
m V}_{\scriptscriptstyle 
m max}$  and low mean transvalvular gradient. In the latter condition, the aortic valve is only mildly or moderately stenotic; however the "weak" LV is unable to generate high enough flow to allow full excursion of the valve leaflets. Therefore, the AVA appears erroneously low. As discussed above, when there is a discrepancy between velocity/gradient and valvular area, it is important to make sure the proper LVOT measurement was used in the AVA calculation.

Low dose dobutamine combined with echocardiography is useful in distinguishing true severe LFLG AS with reduced

LVEF from pseudo-severe AS. 43 Patients with pseudo-severe AS will demonstrate an increase in AVA with only a modest increase in transaortic velocity or gradient as transaortic stroke volume increases with the dobutamine infusion. In contrast, patients with true severe AS will have a fixed valve area even with an increase in LV contractility and transaortic flow rate. Severe AS on low dose dobutamine stress echocardiography is defined as a maximum velocity of ≥4.0 m/s with a valve area of ≤1.0 cm<sup>2</sup> at any point during the test protocol.<sup>33</sup>

Dobutamine stress echo also identifies a subgroup of patients who have a "lack of contractile reserve" by failing to show a 20% increase in stroke volume with dobutamine. This subgroup of patients has a poor prognosis with either medical or surgical therapy.<sup>44</sup>

Low Gradient AS with Normal LVEF. Low gradient AS with normal LVEF (also known as paradoxical LFLG AS) was first described in 2007.45 These patients have severe AS defined by an indexed AVA ≤0.6 cm<sup>2</sup>, but paradoxically lower than expected transvalvular gradients due to low stroke volume despite preserved LVEF (>50%). This entity is found in approximately 10 to 25% of patients with severe AS.<sup>42</sup> They consist primarily of elderly women with more pronounced concentric LV hypertrophy resulting in a small LV cavity size and reduced stroke volume (<35 mL/m<sup>2</sup>). The LV end diastolic diameter is generally <47 mm, and end diastolic volume indexed for BSA < 55 mL/m<sup>2</sup>. 46 Such patients often have signs of diastolic dysfunction with restrictive physiology and decrease in LV compliance and filling.

Identification of this entity is important as patients with symptomatic low-gradient AS with normal LVEF have a poorer prognosis compared with patients with high-gradient severe AS if treated medically rather than surgically.<sup>47</sup> Before this diagnosis is considered, it is important to exclude errors in the component measurements used to calculate aortic valve area (LVOT size, or LVOT and aortic flows).

Hemodynamic Effect on LV. Echocardiography is useful in assessing the LV response to chronic pressure overload that results in LV hypertrophy. LV systolic function and volumes can be estimated by 2D and 3D echocardiography. Diastolic dysfunction often accompanies LV hypertrophy and is particularly pronounced in low-gradient AS with normal LVEF. Mitral E/e' > 15, MV E wave deceleration time < 150 ms and a transmitral E/A ratio > 2.5 suggests a restrictive filling pattern. 48 Estimation of pulmonary systolic pressure is obtained from the peak tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity using the simplified Bernoulli equation.

Diagnostic Pitfalls with Echocardiography. Maximum velocity and transvalvular gradients are dependent on LV function and flow. Hence, conditions affecting flow can influence the values of these parameters. For instance, when there is coexisting significant AR, the maximum transvalvular velocity and mean gradient will be higher for a given valvular area because of the high transaortic systolic flow rate. In the presence of severe MR, transaortic flow rate may be low resulting in a low gradient even when severe AS is present. Valvular area calculations, however, remain accurate.

Use of TEE. TEE allows high-fidelity assessment of the geometry and the height of valvular leaflets relative to one another. This level of detail is not well seen on TTE. The CSA<sub>L</sub> vot can also be obtained via 3D multi-planar reconstruction to reduce errors when using the continuity equation to calculation the AVA. TEE is also superior to TTE in obtaining precise measurements of the aortic root and ascending aorta, thus supporting surgical planning for aortic valve repair and guidance in the use of transapical or transcatheter AVR.

The 2014 AHA/ACC guidelines employ multiple echocardiographic parameters discussed above as part of the algorithm to determine the timing for an aortic valve replacement for severe AS (Fig. 12-20).

### **AORTIC REGURGITATION**

Echocardiography provides diagnostic information about the mechanism of aortic regurgitation (AR), assessment of severity of AR, hemodynamic effect of resultant volume overload on the LV, and the morphology and dimensions of the aortic root.

Etiology of Aortic Regurgitation by Echocardiography. Echocardiography can differentiate whether AR occurs as a result of leaflet abnormality, or aortic root dilatation that prevents complete leaflet coaptation. Specifically, echocardiography can identify leaflet abnormalities such as bicuspid aortic valve, degenerative leaflet calcifications, infective endocarditis, and rheumatic thickening. Likewise, dilation of the aortic annulus, sinuses of Valsalva, sinotubular junction, and ascending aorta can be easily quantified with echocardiography. Some causes of aortic dilation include long-standing hypertension, Marfan's syndrome, connective tissue disorders, and aortitis.

\*AVR should be considered with stage D3 AS only if valve obstruction is the most likely cause of symptoms, stroke volume index is <35 mL/m², indexed AVA is ≤0.6 cm²/m², and data are recorded when the patient is normotensive (systolic BP <140 mm Hg).

The echocardiographic description of bicuspid aortic valve was discussed earlier under aortic stenosis. Since aortopathy is associated with bicuspid aortic valve, assessment of the aortic root and ascending aorta dimensions are important.

In degenerative calcific AR, the central portions of the cusps are calcified and there is no commissural fusion. In rheumatic AR, in contrast, there is commissural fusion, and the calcification and diffuse thickening of the leaflets at the leaflet free edges result in leaflet retraction and central AR.

Echocardiographic Assessment of AR Severity. Assessing the severity of AR requires integration of qualitative and quantitative echocardiographic measures, similar to the assessment of MR (Table 12-6).<sup>21</sup>

Color flow imaging is the easiest method to provide a visual estimate of the degree of AR. However, this method is subject to many limitations. Color jet size and length are influenced by the aortic to LV diastolic pressure gradient and LV compliance. Thus, it can poorly correlate with the severity of AR. Jets directed towards the anterior mitral valve leaflet or septum may appear narrow. Jet area and size are often overestimated in the apical views, and for this reason, they are best assessed in the parasternal long axis views due to better axial resolution. The ratio of the proximal jet width (measured from the long axis view) to the diameter of the LV outflow tract of >65% is consistent with severe AR<sup>49</sup> (Fig. 12-21).

The vena contracta width is the narrowest flow diameter at the level of the aortic valve. This is measured in the parasternal long axis view and provides an indirect measure of the EROA. A vena contracta of 6 mm at a Nyquist limit of –60 cm/s correlates with severe AR.<sup>50</sup>

The EROA is an ideal parameter for the assessment and follow up of AR. As discussed for MR, this requires assessment of the flow convergence zone. It is very challenging to derive EROA due to difficulty obtaining high-quality images of the flow convergence zone. Where feasible, the apical five-chamber view is recommended for central regurgitant jets, whereas in eccentric jets, the parasternal long axis view is used. An EROA  $\geq$  30 mm<sup>2</sup> or regurgitant volume  $\geq$  60 mL

indicates severe AR.<sup>31</sup> Measurement of this parameter is less common than for MR.

Brief aortic diastolic flow reversal is observed in the aorta in normal studies as measured by pulse wave Doppler in the proximal descending aorta (just distal to the origin of the subclavian artery). In severe AR, there is holodiastolic flow with an end diastolic velocity typically >20 cm/s.<sup>51</sup>

The density of the CW jet in comparison to the antegrade flow provides an estimate of the volume of regurgitation; however, it can be difficult to distinguish moderate from severe regurgitation based on CW jet density alone. CW Doppler of the AR jet is best obtained from the five-chamber view. Eccentrically directed jets may be better obtained from the right parasternal window.

The rate of deceleration of the diastolic regurgitant velocity and the PHT reflect the rate of equalization of aortic and LV diastolic pressure. In severe acute AR, there is rapid equalization resulting in a short PHT. A PHT < 200 ms is consistent with severe AR, whereas >500 ms is consistent with mild AR. However, this parameter is influenced by chamber compliance and pressure. The PHT can be shortened by elevated LV diastolic pressure, or lengthened and normalized with chronic LV adaptations to the severe AR.

Hemodynamic Effects on the LV. The LV dilates in response to the chronic volume overload of AR and assumes a more spherical shape. LV mass increases, although the increase in wall thickness is modest. Deterioration of LV systolic function is a late and possibly irreversible finding. However, patients with severe LV dysfunction (LVEF  $\leq$  35%) and severe AR still experience a mortality benefit from AVR. <sup>52</sup>

In the 2014 AHA/ACC guidelines, aortic valve replacement is indicated when LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF < 50%) is present (Class I) and is reasonable with severe LV dilation (LVESD > 50 mm or indexed LVESD indexed > 25 mm/m²) with normal LV systolic function (LVEF  $\geq$  50%) (Class IIa).

Acute AR. The most common causes of acute AR are infective endocarditis and aortic dissection. The specificity and sensitivity of TTE for the diagnosis of aortic dissection are only 80% and 60% respectively, whereas TEE has a specificity and sensitivity of 95 to 100% and 98 to 100%. Infective endocarditis causes aortic regurgitation via leaflet perforation, destruction, and malcoaptation due to mechanical effects of vegetations on the leaflet tips.

The primary difference in acute and chronic AR on echocardiography is the LV. In chronic AR, the LV has had time to remodel and dilate. Sudden volume overload in acute AR is poorly tolerated by the normally sized LV and this leads to a rapid rise in LV diastolic pressure and pulmonary edema. Due to the rapid equalization of aortic and LV diastolic pressures, the CW velocity profile of the acute AR jet demonstrates a steep slope with a short pressure half-time of <200 ms and pulse wave Doppler of the descending aorta demonstrates no end diastolic velocity. Markedly elevated LV diastolic pressures are indicated by short deceleration time on the mitral inflow and premature closure of the mitral valve on M-mode echocardiography.

TEE in AR. TEE is utilized for assessing the aortic root and ascending aorta dimensions when aortic dissection is suspected and for obtaining precise measurements in the surgical planning phase of aortic valve repair. A magnified view of the aortic valve can provide a cleaner vena contracta measurement than on TTE. Other Doppler assessments are better obtained from TTE due to difficulty obtaining TEE views where the ultrasound beam is parallel to the jet direction. But in the operating room, transgastric TEE can come close to being "on axis" in the LVOT. Also 3D TEE datasets can be manipulated in near real time to obtain perfect alignment and some systems allow reassessment of Doppler information in postanalysis. Also TEE is particularly useful in infective endocarditis to identify vegetations and abscess formation not seen as well on TEE.

Timing of AVR for AR Based on Echocardiographic Parameters. The 2014 AHA/ACC valvular heart disease guidelines utilize echocardiographic parameters in the algorithm for the timing of aortic valve replacement for severe AR. The algorithm is shown in Fig. 12-22.

### Tricuspid Valve Disorders

#### TRICUSPID REGURGITATION

Echocardiographic assessment of TR provides information on valvular morphology, severity of TR, hemodynamic effects on right-sided chambers and significance of left-sided disease. This requires a combination of 2D and Doppler methods to assess leaflet structure and function including thickness, coaptation geometry, gradients, annular dilation, presence of masses, RV size and function, and RV systolic pressure (RVSP).

Functional TR. The most common cause of TR is functional, where the leaflets are structurally normal and regurgitation is caused by incomplete leaflet coaptation due to annular dilatation and leaflet tethering. Any condition that causes RV dilatation and systolic dysfunction can lead to functional TR. The most common causes are left-sided heart disease particularly mitral and aortic valve diseases. Other etiologies include atriopathy related to atrial fibrillation and pulmonary conditions causing pulmonary hypertension. Normal tricuspid valve annulus diameter measured in diastole in the fourchamber view is  $28 \pm 5$  mm. A diastolic annulus > 34 mm is a marker of significant TR. Severe annular dilatation (>40 mm or >21 mm/m<sup>2</sup>) indicates an increased risk of persistent or progressive TR after isolated mitral valve surgery.<sup>54</sup> Thus, efforts are now focused on identifying patients early who will benefit from tricuspid valve (TV) interventions.

Primary TR. Primary disorders of the tricuspid apparatus are much less common. In rheumatic disease, the leaflets and papillary muscles are thickened, shortened and retracted. Tricuspid valve prolapse most often involves the anterior and septal leaflets and is almost always associated with mitral valve prolapse. A flail leaflet is caused by ruptured chordae, degenerative disease, infective endocarditis, trauma, or it can be iatrogenic from central lines, intravalvular pacemaker leads or during endomyocardial biopsies. Intracardiac device leads can also interfere with coaptation if there is impingement of the valvular leaflets.<sup>55</sup> With Ebstein's anomaly, the tricuspid valve leaflets are malformed: in the most common form, the anterior leaflet is the largest leaflet and the posterior and septal leaflets are vestigial and arise posteriorly and apically. Carcinoid disease affects the tricuspid and pulmonary valves. These leaflets appear short, thickened, and fibrotic with restricted motion. In severe cases of carcinoid disease, the leaflets are nonmobile, resulting in wide-open regurgitation.

Assessment of Severity by Echocardiography. The standards for determining the severity of TR are less robust than for MR with limited studies to validate quantitative measures for TR. The European Association of Echocardiography/American Society of Echocardiography (EAE/ASE) guidelines recommend an integrative approach: evaluating size and function of right-sided chambers, septal motion, and various Doppler parameters (Table 12-7). 21,28

The following parameters are consistent with severe TR: (1) a jet area > 10 cm<sup>2</sup> (caveat being that the severity

![](_page_21_Picture_9.jpeg)

### TABLE 12-7: Echocardiographic Signs of Severe TR

- Vena contracta width > 0.7 cm
- CW jet density and contour: dense, triangular with early peak ("cut-off" sign)
- EROA ≥ 40 mm<sup>2</sup>
- Regurgitant volume ≥ 45 mL
- Central jet area > 10 cm<sup>2</sup>
- Hepatic vein flow: systolic flow reversal
- Tricuspid inflow: E wave dominant (≥1 cm/s)
- Dilated RV, RA and IVC with decreased respirophasic variation
- Interventricular septal flattening in diastole (RV volume overload)

of eccentrically directed regurgitant jets may be underestimated); (2) a vena contracta of  $\geq 7$  mm;<sup>56</sup> (3) EROA  $\geq$  40 mm<sup>2</sup> or regurgitant volume of  $\geq$  45 mL<sup>57</sup> (although the flow convergence method is rarely used in clinical practice); (4) continuous wave Doppler of the TR jet is dense and complete, and can appear truncated with a triangular contour due to an early peak velocity (cut-off sign); and (5) systolic flow reversal in the hepatic veins (sensitivity of 80%).<sup>6</sup>

Hemodynamic Consequences of TR: Echocardiographic Assessment. Chronic significant TR causes volume overload of the right-sided chambers, which subsequently leads to RV dilatation and failure, and elevated PASP. With RV volume overload, the interventricular septum demonstrates paradoxical motion and in the short axis view, appears flat in diastole. When pulmonary hypertension ensues, the septum also appears flat in systole as a sign of RV pressure overload. Chronic back pressure causes the interatrial septum to bow to the left, and there is right atrial (RA), IVC and hepatic vein dilatation indicating elevated RA pressure.

Impaired RV function has a negative impact on survival outcomes after tricuspid valve surgery<sup>7</sup> and intervention should ideally be performed before RV dysfunction occurs.<sup>58</sup> The assessment of RV function can be challenging due to its complex shape. Specifically, there is no single 2D imaging plane in which the inflow, apical and outflow views of the RV can be imaged simultaneously. Normal RV function can be defined by many echocardiographic parameters as defined by the ASE guidelines: TAPSE > 17 mm, fractional area change >35%, tricuspid valve annular velocity (S') >9.5 cm/s.<sup>13,23</sup>

Estimation of RVSP is obtained from the TR jet peak velocity using the simplified Bernoulli equation (pressure =  $4 \times \text{velocity}^2$ ). The velocity of the TR jet itself is not equal to the severity of TR, but rather it is related to the peak systolic gradient between the RV and RA. The RVSP is then estimated as the sum of this pressure gradient determination plus the RA pressure. In wide-open TR, the TR jet may appear less turbulent, with a low jet velocity (<2 m/s) due to rapid equalization of RA and RV pressures. In this scenario the simplified Bernoulli method may underestimate RVSP.

Important Echocardiographic Parameters for Timing of TV Surgery. Severe TR is associated with poor prognosis independent of LV and RV function, RV size and age.<sup>59</sup> TR is most often seen in left-sided disease, particularly mitral or aortic pathologies. The 2014 AHA/ACC guidelines recommend tricuspid valve surgery for patients with severe TR undergoing left-sided valve surgery (Class I).31 Mild or moderate degrees of TR can progress in up to 25% of patients if left untreated at the time of left-sided valve surgery. Thus, tricuspid valve repair can be beneficial for patients with at least mild functional TR when undergoing left-sided valve surgery, if there is: (1) tricuspid annular dilatation (>40 mm diameter or 21 mm/m<sup>2</sup> indexed to body surface area), (2) prior evidence of right-heart failure (Class IIa); or (3) pulmonary hypertension present (Class IIb).31 The risk factors for progression of TR include dilated tricuspid annulus (>40 mm diastolic diameter or 21 mm/m<sup>2</sup>), degree of RV dysfunction, pulmonary artery hypertension, AF, intra-annular RV pacemaker, or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator leads. Reoperation for severe isolated tricuspid regurgitation after left-sided valve surgery is associated with significant perioperative mortality.

TEE in TR. TEE is seldom required in the preoperative assessment of TR but is useful in infective endocarditis and when assessing for interference of intracardiac device leads on the valve leaflet function. Transgastric views can demonstrate the tricuspid valve in short axis, which is a view not readily seen on TTE, and a transgastric 120° view provides a highly reliable tricuspid annulus measurement for assessing the need for tricuspid repair. Also Doppler analysis of the flow direction in the anterior hepatic vein provides very precise data about the presence of systolic reversal of hepatic vein flow, an important indicator of severe TR.

### **Prosthetic Valves**

Echocardiography with Doppler is the method of choice for the noninvasive evaluation of prosthetic function. Echocardiographic assessment of prosthetic valves includes 2D imaging of the valve, its leaflets and its overall seating, assessment of valvular hemodynamics including transvalvular velocities and gradients, identification and quantification of valvular stenosis or regurgitation; and evaluation of cardiac chamber sizes, left ventricular systolic function and pulmonary artery pressures.

The basic Doppler principles applied to native valves to assess gradients and calculate for effective orifice area (EOA) are also used for prosthetic valves. Different models and sizes of prosthetic valves have different gradients and EOA. <sup>60</sup> The expected ranges of normal gradients and EOA for different types of valves in different valvular positions have been reported and are available in guidelines and other documents. <sup>60</sup>

Peak instantaneous pressure gradient is calculated by the simplified Bernoulli equation as previously described (see the Aortic Stenosis section). The EOA of the prosthetic aortic valve is calculated from the continuity equation, similar to

native stenotic aortic valves. For prosthetic aortic valves, it is also reasonable to use the dimensionless velocity index (DVI) to assess for stenosis. The DVI is the ratio of the velocity in the LVOT measured by pulse wave (PW) Doppler to the velocity through the aortic prosthesis measured by CW Doppler. A DVI <0.25 suggests significant valve obstruction if accompanied by an acceleration time > 100 ms (which is the time from transvalvular flow onset to maximum velocity).  $^{60}$ 

The continuity equation can also be applied (in the absence of significant MR or AR) for the mitral valve but is not as frequently used. When applied it is:

$$MV area = CSA_{MVannulus} \times \frac{VTI_{MVannulus}}{VTI_{MV}}$$

The PHT technique used to quantify the area of native stenotic mitral valves can be used to monitor prosthetic mitral valve function. Prolongation of the PHT when compared to baseline is a reliable indication of obstruction. DVI is increased in mitral prosthetic stenosis or regurgitation. In this scenario, the PHT can help differentiate between the two. A PHT of >200 ms is most consistent with stenosis, whereas a PHT < 130 ms, especially with an elevated peak E wave velocity, suggests regurgitation.  $^{60}$ 

A small degree of regurgitation occurs with virtually all types of mechanical prostheses and can be detected by color Doppler. These jets are normally brief and of low intensity with little penetration into the LA.<sup>61</sup> These "washing jets" are thought to prevent thrombus formation on the edges of the occluders and also reduce friction that might impede rapid valve opening.

### PROSTHETIC VALVULAR DYSFUNCTION

The main causes of prosthetic valvular dysfunction requiring surgery are prosthetic valve obstruction manifested by moderate-to-severe stenosis, degeneration manifested by moderate-to-severe central valvular regurgitation, or significant paravalvular regurgitation. Obstructions are most commonly caused by thrombosis, vegetation, pannus or fibrous ingrowth. Degeneration most commonly is due to aging of bioprosthetic leaflets or effects of endocarditis while paravalvular leaks most often are associated with infection.

### PROSTHETIC VALVULAR OBSTRUCTION

Almost all prosthetic valves have an EOA that is smaller than the native orifice area. Comparison with the baseline postoperative echocardiogram or with established normal values for valves of that specific type and size is particularly helpful for detection of significant prosthetic valvular obstruction. <sup>60</sup>

Mechanical valvular obstruction or stenosis occurs as a result of thrombus deposition or pannus formation, which interferes with normal leaflet occluder motion. Obstruction may not be obvious on 2D TTE imaging, but is suspected when there is a significant increase in pressure gradient. TEE is the primary means to confirm prosthetic valvular obstruction and identify its causes, particularly for the mitral valve (Fig. 12-23). It can be difficult to differentiate a thrombus

![](_page_23_Picture_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 12-23** Mechanical mitral prosthetic valve obstruction. TEE midesophageal long axis view of a thrombosed bileaflet mitral prosthesis. Only one leaflet opens in diastole (*arrow*). The other leaflet is obstructed by thrombus, that is also seen on the left atrial wall (\*). LA = left atrium.

from a pannus on echocardiography. However, a thrombus is usually larger, has a "softer" ultrasound appearance similar to myocardium and may demonstrate mobile elements. Large thrombi (>1 cm in length or 0.8 cm² in area) have a 2.4-fold higher rate of complications per 1 cm² increase in size. <sup>62</sup> Pannus formation is more common in aortic prostheses. <sup>60</sup> For a bioprosthetic valve, fibrosis and calcification of leaflets are the most common causes for obstruction.

Patient prosthesis mismatch (PPM) occurs when the EOA of the prosthesis is too small for the patient's body size and stroke volume requirements, resulting in abnormally high gradients. Most studies have focused on the aortic prosthesis. PPM is considered mild (and therefore not clinically significant) if the indexed EOA of the aortic prosthesis is  $>0.85~\text{cm}^2/\text{m}^2$ , moderate if  $>0.65~\text{to} <0.85~\text{cm}^2/\text{m}^2$ , and severe if  $\leq 0.65~\text{cm}^2/\text{m}^2$ .

### PROSTHETIC VALVE PATHOLOGIC REGURGITATION

Pathological regurgitation of a mechanical prosthetic valve is typically due to a paravalvular leak. Paravalvular regurgitation that occurs soon after surgery is usually due to technical factors or infective endocarditis. Late paravalvular regurgitation is almost always due to infective endocarditis, causing suture dehiscence. Significant dehiscence can result in rocking or independent motion of the prosthesis. Occasionally thrombus or pannus formation limits normal occluder closure resulting in significant central valvular regurgitation.

For bioprostheses, pathologic central regurgitation usually occurs as a result of leaflet degeneration and/or calcification. The causes of paravalvular regurgitation are similar to that of mechanical prostheses.

Detection of regurgitation by TTE is challenging for mitral and tricuspid valves due to acoustic shadowing and reverberation artifacts from the prostheses that can obscure

![](_page_23_Figure_10.jpeg)

**FIGURE 12-24** Mitral paravalvular leak. Mid-esophageal TEE of a mechanical bileaflet mitral prosthesis at transducer angle of 60°.

evidence of the Doppler regurgitation signal in the atria. Localization of paravalvular regurgitation may be difficult and can only be diagnosed if the flow is visualized around the outside of the sewing ring. Multiplanar TEE is particular helpful in these situations (Fig. 12-24). Real-time 3D TEE with color Doppler can facilitate the location and quantify the extent of prosthetic regurgitation by visualizing the regurgitant orifice area *en face* from the perspective of the chamber receiving the regurgitation.

Indications for surgical intervention of significant prosthetic valve regurgitation are the same as indications for native regurgitation of the aortic or mitral valve. Specifically, this includes echocardiographic evidence of LV dysfunction including low LVEF or progressive LV dilation.<sup>31</sup>

For a discussion of echocardiographic imaging of infective endocarditis of prosthetic valves, see the section on Infective Endocarditis below.

### TTE VERSUS TEE IMAGING OF THE PROSTHETIC VALVES

TTE detects prosthetic valve dysfunction through quantitation of the severity of stenosis and regurgitation by Doppler techniques. TTE also allows assessment of LV size and systolic function, LA size, right heart function and estimation of pulmonary pressures. However, with its better image quality and structure resolution, TEE is superior to determine the actual mechanism of prosthetic valvular dysfunction in addition to providing the same information that TTE is capable of. But in the presence of multiple mechanical prostheses, either method may be limited by echo shadowing from one of the devices, and a combination of both may provide the most complete information. In the operating room this may mean combining TEE with epicardial views.

### Infective Endocarditis

Echocardiography plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis of infective endocarditis (IE), identifying underlying predisposing conditions, detecting complications, characterizing the hemodynamic severity of valvular lesions, and assessing ventricular function and pulmonary pressures.

The hallmark of IE on echocardiography is the identification of new vegetations. New or worsening valvular regurgitation, abscess and new partial dehiscence of a prosthetic valve are also important echocardiographic features. <sup>64</sup> A vegetation is defined echocardiographically as a mass that exhibits a motion pattern that is independent of the structure it is attached to, such as a valve or implanted intracardiac device. The sensitivity of TTE for the detection of vegetations ranges from 50 to 90%, depending on the quality of images, the location of the lesion, and the size of the lesion. TEE has far superior sensitivity at 90 to 100%. <sup>31</sup> Identification of vegetations may be difficult in the presence of preexisting lesions (degenerative calcified valves, mitral valve prolapse, prosthetic valves), if the vegetations are small or already embolized.

### COMPLICATIONS IDENTIFIED BY ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY

Valvular regurgitation is the most common complication of native valve endocarditis. It can arise from multiple mechanisms: coaptation failure from vegetation interference, leaflet destruction and perforation, or flail leaflet from ruptured chords.

Paravalvular abscess generally affects the aortic valve around the aortic root and can spread to the intervalvular fibrosa and anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. On echocardiography, an abscess is seen as a nonhomogeneous paravalvular thickening often with lucent spaces within it. The abscess can drain into a cardiac cavity and it may appear on echocardiography as a pseudoaneurysm (Fig. 12-25). With color Doppler, the pulsatile flow can be recorded into and out of this echo-free space. Fistula formation is more rare and visualized as a communication between two neighboring cavities through a perforation. The pattern and timing of the flow in the fistula with color Doppler is a function of the relative pressures between the two cavities. Spread of infection into the pericardial space can result in purulent pericarditis. It is difficult using echocardiography to distinguish purulent pericarditis from a sterile inflammatory pericardial effusion; so, the diagnosis is generally made based on clinical findings.

Systemic embolization of the vegetation or portions of the vegetation are a frequent and life-threatening complication. Echocardiographic features of the vegetation that correlate with embolization include large size (>10 mm for left sided lesions and 20 mm for right sided lesions) and excessive mobility especially when associated with the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. Worse prognosis is seen in vegetations >15 mm, increasing vegetation size despite antibiotic therapy, multiple sites of involvement, and extension to extra-valvular structures.

![](_page_24_Picture_9.jpeg)

**FIGURE 12-25** Prosthetic valve pseudoaneurysm. TEE midesophageal long axis view showing a dehisced mechanical aortic valve (*white arrow*) with pseudoaneurysm formation (star) as a complication of an aortic root abscess. There is communication between the LVOT and the pseudoaneurysm (*red arrow*). LA = left atrium, LV = left ventricle.

### PROSTHETIC VALVE ENDOCARDITIS (PVE)

PVE has a lower incidence of vegetations (especially mechanical prostheses) and a higher incidence of annular abscesses and other paravalvular complications. Infection usually involves the region between the sewing ring and the annulus in PVE, leading to abscess formation that can progress to dehiscence, pseudoaneurysms, and fistulae. Echocardiographic features of valve dehiscence include paravalvular regurgitation, and excessive rocking motion of the valve. In bioprosthetic PVE, vegetations can also be seen on the leaflets, which can lead to perforation. Infrequently, large vegetations can cause prosthetic valve obstruction.

TTE and TEE have complementary roles in PVE. TEE is superior for detecting annular abscesses, and smaller vegetations. However, owing to acoustic shadowing from the valve, the anterior portion of the aortic valve and the LV side of the MV prosthesis are not as well seen on TEE and can be better assessed on TTE.<sup>68</sup> Assessment of hemodynamic severity of regurgitation is most often better assessed by TTE. Assessment of Doppler-derived aortic valve pressure gradients is typically better with TTE due to better alignment of the Doppler interrogation with flow.

The 2014 AHA/ACC guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease recommend early surgery during initial hospitalization for valve dysfunction causing heart failure, left-sided IE due to *Staphylococcus aureus*, fungal or highly resistant organism, heart block, annular or aortic abscess, and destructive penetrating lesions (Class I, level of evidence C).

Surgery is recommended in relapsing PVE without other source for portal of infection (Class I, Level of evidence B). Early surgery may be considered in mobile vegetations with a dimension larger than 10 mm (Class IIb, Level of evidence B). Early surgery is reasonable in patients with recurrent emboli and persistent vegetations despite appropriate antibiotic therapy (Class IIa, Level of evidence B).<sup>31</sup>

### Diseases of the Aorta

The thoracic aorta can be visualized almost in its entirety by echocardiography. TTE routinely assesses the aortic root and proximal ascending aorta in the parasternal view whereas the aortic arch and its three major branches are seen in the suprasternal view. TEE can depict all portions of the thoracic aorta with high resolution except for a small "blind spot". This blind spot is in the distal ascending aorta just before the innominate artery, and is due to interposition of the right bronchus and trachea between the heart and esophagus. The descending aorta is easily seen from the left subclavian artery to the celiac trunk either in its short or long axis.

### **AORTIC ANEURYSMS**

Aortic root and ascending aorta aneurysms are well seen on echocardiography with reproducible and accurate measurements. Arch and descending aorta aneurysms, however, are better quantified by CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Since treatment guidelines are based on size, it must be understood that measurements by echocardiography are slightly smaller when compared to CT and MRI. The reason for this is that with echocardiography the measurements of the aorta are typically inner edge to inner edge (internal diameter) while with CT and MRI the outer edge to outer edge (external diameter) is measured. Sinus of Valsalva aneurysms typically affect the right sinus. These are seen protruding into the right atrium in the short axis view and appear like a mobile, "windsock" structure.

### **ACUTE AORTIC SYNDROMES**

The diagnosis of acute aortic syndromes requires speed and accuracy due to the high mortality of these conditions and thus the need for rapid triage to appropriate treatment. TEE has similar diagnostic accuracy to CT and MRI.70 Additional advantages are absence of radiation, the ability to be performed on unstable patients at the bedside without needing transfer to the imaging equipment, and no need for intravenous contrast whose use is a relative contraindication for patients with renal dysfunction. However, sedation and a fasting state are typically required. Although TEE is the technique of choice, TTE can be utilized initially in the immediate setting to not only diagnose the presence of dissection, but also to assess LV function, the presence of AR and pericardial effusion. A negative TTE does not exclude dissection and another imaging modality must be utilized if clinical suspicion is high. The specificity and sensitivity of TTE for the diagnosis of aortic root dissection are only 80% and 60%

respectively, whereas TEE has a specificity and sensitivity of 95 to 100% and 98 to 100%.<sup>53</sup>

Dissection typically occurs in the setting of aortic dilation. The diagnosis on echocardiography is made by identification of an intimal flap, which divides the aorta into true and false lumens. The true lumen is usually smaller than the false lumen, expands in systole and reveals systolic antegrade flow by Doppler. The false lumen is filled with slow moving blood and *in situ* thrombosis can be present. The points of entry and exit can often be identified by color Doppler.

Reverberation artifacts in a dilated ascending aorta are common and reported to be present in 44 to 55% of studies.<sup>71</sup> While these can be mistaken for a dissection flap they exhibit different characteristics. A dissection flap has independent mobility (low amplitude, high frequency), whereas an artifact moves in parallel motion with the aortic wall (higher amplitude, lower frequency). M-mode echo is often used to display these motion characteristics. Color flow imaging is useful in demonstrating separation of flow by the dissection flap, whereas flow will move through an artifact.

Intramural hematoma occurs as a result of hemorrhage within the medial layer of the aortic wall, with no communication between the media and true lumen. On echocardiographic cross-sectional views this appears as a crescent thickening of the aortic wall. The inner margin is smooth and displacement of intimal calcification due to accumulation of blood within the aortic wall can be seen. In contrast, a penetrating aortic ulcer has a crater-like distortion of the aortic wall, which is often associated with extensive atheroma. A thrombus, represented by soft irregular echoes, often fills the ulceration.

### COMPLICATIONS OF AORTIC DISSECTION DETECTED BY ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY

Aortic regurgitation (AR) is a common complication in aortic dissection, occurring in approximately 40 to 76% of patients. Multiple mechanisms account for this and they can be diagnosed by TEE. These include dilation of the aortic root and annulus, disruption of the valvular cusps or annulus, loss of support of the cusps due to extension of the dissection into the aortic root, or prolapse of the intimal flap through the aortic valve leaflets into the LVOT (Fig. 12-26). Identification of the mechanism of AR helps in determining if the aortic valve can be spared at the time of dissection repair.

Pericardial tamponade is observed in <20% of patients with ascending aorta dissection and associated with doubling of mortality.<sup>74</sup> Presence of a pericardial effusion suggests rupture of the aorta has occurred and is associated with poor prognosis. However, the effusion may be secondary solely to inflammation. Determining etiology of the pericardial effusion by echocardiography is often not possible.

During TEE depiction of dissection, the origins of the coronary arteries and extra-aortic arch vessels should be demonstrated to determine the extent of the dissection and whether these vessels are supplied by the true or false lumen. The ostia of the coronary arteries are best seen in a short view of the aortic sinuses of Valsalva. The right coronary artery

is most frequently involved and the presence of a new LV inferior wall motion abnormality can be used as indirect or supporting evidence of this occurrence. On TEE, the origins of the left subclavian and left common carotid arteries are usually easily visualized in an upper esophageal view either in a short axis view or an off-axis view of the aortic arch. However, the origin of the innominate artery is more challenging to visualize on TEE and the suprasternal view of the aortic arch on TTE may be superior for depicting it.

### **COARCTATION OF AORTA**

Coarctation of the aorta is diagnosed on TTE from the suprasternal view. A discrete narrowing of the proximal descending aorta is seen, corresponding with increased turbulence and high velocities detected by Doppler imaging in region of coarctation. In the presence of a hemodynamically significant coarctation, the Doppler display of blood flow in the abdominal aorta persists into diastole in contrast to the normal flow limited to systole.

### Pericardial Disease

### CARDIAC TAMPONADE

Transthoracic echocardiography is the best diagnostic modality to demonstrate the presence of a pericardial effusion and its hemodynamic significance. In most cases of cardiac tamponade, a moderate-to-large size effusion is present. However, tamponade can occur even in small effusions that have accumulated rapidly in the setting of a normal or noncompliant pericardium. In this situation there is a rapid acute rise in intrapericardial pressure. The sizes of pericardial effusions are typically quantified subjectively: small effusions are generally 50 to 100 mL, moderate 100 to 500 mL, and large greater than 500 mL.

Echocardiographic signs of cardiac tamponade include imaging signs of increased pericardial pressure and Doppler signs of exaggerated respiratory variation in intracardiac flows. Inversion of the RA free wall during ventricular systole (atrial diastole) that persists for greater than one-third of the cardiac cycle is nearly 100% sensitive and is specific for tamponade.75 Inversion of the RV outflow tract or free wall of the RV in early diastole occurs next; however, this sign may be delayed or absent in the presence of pulmonary hypertension or RV hypertrophy. RV collapse is more specific but less sensitive than RA inversion (Fig. 12-27). With hemodynamically more severe tamponade the duration of diastolic RV wall collapse increases and the sensitivity of this feature increases. Left atrial collapse is a less common but an accurate sign for tamponade. Left ventricular collapse is rare since a higher pericardial pressure is required to distort the thicker LV walls but it can be observed in regional tamponade, which can occur with perioperative or postoperative bleeding.

As the intrapericardial pressure rises during the development of cardiac tamponade, exaggerated respiratory variation in the early mitral and tricuspid inflow (E wave) velocity is noted by pulse wave Doppler. During inspiration, the tricuspid E wave peak velocity increases >60% and the mitral E wave peak velocity decreases by 30%, whereas in expiration, the mitral E velocity increases >30%. These findings reflect the influence of intrathoracic pressure on intracardiac filling as intrapericardial pressure rises. This variation in flow will be reversed during positive pressure ventilation. Dilated inferior vena cava and hepatic veins typically indicate elevated right atrial pressures.

Regional cardiac tamponade, that is tamponade of only a portion of the heart but resulting in systemic hemodynamic affects, is most often noted after cardiac surgery, periocardiotomy, or myocardial infarction. A localized effusion or hematoma that compresses selective cardiac chambers may be

difficult to visualize on TTE and typically requires a TEE. The Doppler alterations in intracardiac flow may be noted on the TTE in this setting but with a reduced frequency compared to tamponade due to circumferential effusions. Cardiac tamponade seen in the postoperative period can be early (<24 hours), or late (>5 to 7 days). Early tamponade is typically related to surgical bleeding. In this situation, the right-sided chambers, particularly the RA, are usually compressed; however a posterior hematoma may compress the left atrium or LV.<sup>77</sup>

### **CONSTRICTIVE PERICARDITIS**

In the United States and Europe, the most common causes for constrictive pericarditis are postcardiac surgery, idiopathic or secondary to nonspecific viral pericarditis. Other causes include tuberculous pericarditis, radiation pericarditis, and collagen vascular disease.<sup>78</sup>

Typical echocardiographic features include septal motion abnormalities, biatrial enlargement, and alterations in early diastolic mitral inflow. There are two types of septal wall motion abnormalities noted in constrictive pericarditis. The first is called the septal bounce. It is a subtle, early diastolic flutter that is noted on every cardiac cycle. This sign reflects an exaggeration in the difference in timing of passive filling of the right and left ventricles that occurs due to ventricular interdependence. The second septal wall motion abnormality is a brisk movement of the interventricular septum towards the LV in inspiration, followed by a brisk rebound back towards the RV in expiration. This occurs due to an exaggeration in the diastolic ventricular pressure differences induced with respiration. Moderate biatrial enlargement reflects the chronicity of the increase in atrial pressures. A restrictive transmitral pulse wave Doppler filling pattern is observed which is characterized by high early diastolic E velocity, reduced atrial A wave (E/A ratio > 2.5), and short E wave deceleration time (<160 ms). 48,76 This pattern reflects the increase in LA pressure and the reduced filling (due to early equilibration of LA and LV diastolic pressure) from pericardial constraint. Pulse wave Doppler shows a decrease >25% in the mitral inflow velocity and a >40% increase in tricuspid inflow velocity with the first beat of inspiration.<sup>76,4</sup> This variation in flow reflects the fact that the intracardiac pressures are isolated from the intrathoracic pressures due to the thickened pericardium. Thus, as intrathoracic pressure decreases with inspiration, the LA and LV diastolic pressures do not also decrease to the same magnitude and thus flow into the left heart from the pulmonary circulation is reduced. This pattern will be reversed for patients on positive pressure ventilation. The mitral annular motion and velocity assessed by tissue Doppler is normal or elevated (>7 cm/s). In contrast to normal subjects, the lateral annular velocity is lower than septal annular velocity, reflecting tethering of the lateral free wall to the thickened pericardium. The inferior vena cava and hepatic veins are usually dilated indicating elevated right atrial pressure. Prominent diastolic flow reversal in the hepatic veins is a classic finding in pericardial constriction. Some of the Doppler signs of constrictive pericarditis can be difficult to differentiate from those noted with restrictive cardiomyopathy since that process is also associated with elevated LA pressure and early diastolic pressure equilibration (restrictive filling). However, in restrictive cardiomyopathy the respiratory variation in the Doppler pattern is not present.<sup>79</sup>

### Perioperative ECHO Guidance

The cardiac surgeon should develop a pattern of close communication with the echocardiographer, especially in the intraoperative setting. It is important to integrate imaging information into cardiac surgical practice and be willing to change the plan based on the ultrasound data. The surgeon can enhance outcomes by developing and communicating expectations for ultrasound data specific to the operation being performed. Based on data, the echocardiographer should be expected to make predictions which can help the surgeon to choose appropriate surgical techniques to optimize outcomes.<sup>83</sup> Examples of specific data elements and predictions are listed in Table 12-8.

In demanding operations such as aortic and mitral valve repair, communication between surgeon and echocardiographer is ideally a two-way street. The intraoperative

echocardiographer can use 3D images to enhance communication in terms of structure and function, and can base predictions on precise 3D TEE measurements. The surgeon can provide feedback to the imaging physician by using a head camera or field camera to share the anatomy and the performed operation.

The, modern cardiac surgeon should prepare himself or herself not only to understand ultrasound data, but also to acquire the skill to generate high-quality ultrasound images via an epicardial ultrasound probe in cases where TEE is not possible. Creating a culture of shared information promotes steep and continuous learning curves on both sides of the ether screen, supports the introduction of new technologies and devices, and can only improve patient outcomes.
