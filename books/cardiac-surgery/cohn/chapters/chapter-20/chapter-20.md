# Myocardial Revascularization with Cardiopulmonary Bypass

Michael H. Kwon • George Tolis, Jr. • Thoralf M. Sundt

Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the single largest killer of Americans, accounting for almost half a million deaths per year. It imposes a particular burden on the elderly, with more than 80% of all CAD deaths occurring in those over age 65. The magnitude of this impact takes on great significance because it is expected that the number of Americans older than 65 years of age will more than double over the next four decades. If you add to this aging population the anticipated increase in the prevalence of important risk factors for CAD such as diabetes mellitus (DM) and obesity, the population at risk for CAD can only be expected to increase.

Myocardial revascularization represents an effective treatment strategy shown to prolong survival. Techniques of revascularization include percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, which can be performed with or without cardio-pulmonary bypass. Current techniques for CABG can be carried out with low perioperative morbidity and mortality, with excellent long-term outcomes despite an increasing risk profile.<sup>3</sup> CABG surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass remains the standard by which the other techniques (ie, PCI, off-pump CABG, robotic CABG, hybrid revascularization) are measured.<sup>4,5</sup> It is expected that it will continue to be a cornerstone in the management of CAD in the foreseeable future.

# HISTORY OF CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFTING

The modern era of myocardial revascularization with cardiopulmonary bypass began in 1954 when Dr. John Gibbon reported the development of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.<sup>6</sup> An additional seminal advance occurred with the development of coronary angiography by Mason Sones at the Cleveland Clinic in 1957, which opened the door to the elective treatment of coronary atherosclerosis by means of direct revascularization. Initial reports by Rene Favaloro and Donald B. Effler on their techniques to treat clinical events associated with stenotic lesions of the coronary arteries culminated in the first large series of aorto-to-coronary artery venous grafts reported in 1969. Simultaneously Dudley Johnson of Milwaukee published a series of 301 patients in 1969. The success of these techniques was soon demonstrated in larger series initiating the modern era of coronary artery surgery.

# INDICATIONS FOR SURGICAL CORONARY REVASCULARIZATION

The practicing cardiac surgeon is confronted with no clinical question more often than, "Is coronary bypass indicated in this patient?" In brief, the indications established by the American College of Cardiology Foundation and the American Heart Association (ACCF/AHA) consensus panel are based predominantly on the results of trials comparing surgical revascularization with medical therapy for patients with chronic stable angina. 10 Three major historical trials, the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS), the Veterans Administration Coronary Artery Bypass Cooperative Study Group, and the European Coronary Surgery Study (ECSS), demonstrated the greatest survival benefit of revascularization to be among those patients at highest risk of death from the disease itself as defined by the severity of angina and/or ischemia, the number of diseased vessels, and the presence of left ventricular dysfunction. 11-13 Even as the technology and methods for all manner of revascularization strategies improve, the principles established by these seminal trials continue to serve as the basis upon which the results of newer trials designed to study specific populations, clinical scenarios, and anatomic patterns of disease are compared and interpreted.

# Clinical and Laboratory Assessment of Coronary Artery Disease

A surgeon's first introduction to a patient with CAD is frequently a conventional coronary angiogram. Indeed most studies of coronary revascularization have stratified risk and grouped patients according to the number and distribution of coronary lesions. For the purposes of this discussion, and in an effort to be consistent with the large body of literature upon which the current ACCF/AHA guidelines are based, "significant" stenosis is defined as ≥70% reduction in luminal diameter of a coronary artery other than the left main coronary artery (LMCA) for which ≥50% reduction is considered significant. 10 A major development in the last decade in assessing the severity of coronary disease has been the introduction of the SYNTAX score, 14 which is a pure angiographic score of severity and complexity that has recently been validated to correlate with 3-year outcomes in patients with triple vessel and/or main stem disease. It uses dedicated computer software to assign points to each lesion based on length, degree of stenosis, and relation to areas of bifurcation/trifurcation, such that the higher the overall score, the more complex the coronary disease. Although the anatomic distribution and severity of hemodynamically significant coronary lesions determines, in large part, the optimal therapy (CABG, PCI, or medical therapy), the clinical presentation and results of noninvasive studies of myocardial perfusion and function are necessary to characterize the pathophysiologic implications of the angiographic disease and its impact on prognosis and, therefore, to make a clinically appropriate recommendation. In the technological era in which we practice, the importance of the clinical history bears emphasis, particularly in an aging population. Because one of the objectives of surgery is to improve symptoms and quality of life, a thorough appreciation of the patient's functional status is a prerequisite in selecting the optimal therapeutic strategy.

The system proposed by the Canadian Cardiovascular Society for grading the clinical severity of angina pectoris is widely accepted (Table 20-1). Unfortunately, angina is a highly subjective phenomenon for both patient and physician, and prospective evaluation of the assessment of functional

#### Canadian Cardiovascular Society

Angina Classification

- 0 = No angina
- 1 = Angina only with strenuous or prolonged exertion
- 2 = Angina with walking at a rapid pace on the level, on a grade, or upstairs (slight limitation of normal activities)
- 3 = Angina with walking at a normal pace less than two blocks or one flight of stairs (marked limitation)
- 4 = Angina with even mild activity

classification by the CCS criteria has demonstrated a reproducibility of only 73%. <sup>15</sup> Furthermore, there may be a strikingly poor correlation between the severity of symptoms and the magnitude of ischemia, as is notoriously the case among diabetic patients with asymptomatic "silent ischemia."

Electrocardiography (ECG), if abnormal, is helpful in assessing ischemic burden. Unfortunately, it demonstrates no pathognomonic signs in half of patients with chronic stable angina. Still the monitoring of an ECG under stress conditions is simple and inexpensive, and is therefore useful as a screening examination. Among patients with anatomically defined disease, stress ECG provides additional information about the severity of ischemia and the prognosis of the disease. The sensitivity of the test increases with age, with the severity of the patient's disease, and with the magnitude of observed ST-segment shift.<sup>16</sup> If ST-segment depression is greater than 1 mm, stress ECG has a predictive value of 90%, whereas a 2-mm shift with accompanying angina is virtually diagnostic.<sup>17</sup> Early onset of ST-segment depression and prolonged depression after the discontinuation of exercise are strongly associated with significant multivessel disease. Unfortunately, many patients cannot achieve their target heart rates owing to beta blockade or a limitation to their exercise tolerance caused by coexisting disease, decreasing the usefulness of this test in these often high-risk patients. Resting abnormalities in the ECG may also limit the predictive accuracy of the test.

Perfusion imaging with thallium-201 or a technetium-99m-based tracer may be particularly useful in patients with abnormalities on their baseline ECG. Reversible defects demonstrated by comparison of images obtained after injection of the tracer at peak stress with rest images is indicative of ischemia, and hence viability. An irreversible defect indicates a nonviable scar. The results obtained with both tracers are similar, with the average sensitivity around 90% and specificity of approximately 75%. For patients unable to exercise, pharmacologic vasodilators such as adenosine or dipyridamole may be used with similar sensitivity.

Echocardiographic imaging during exercise or pharmacologic stress has gained increasing popularity among cardiologists. Comparative studies have demonstrated accuracy similar to that of nuclear studies with sensitivity and specificity both around 85%. <sup>18</sup> Patients unable to exercise may be stressed with high-dose dipyridamole, or more commonly dobutamine at doses from 5 to 40 μg/kg/min. An initial augmentation of contractility followed by loss or "drop out" is diagnostic of ischemia (and accordingly viability), whereas failure to augment contractility at low dose suggests scar. Additionally, information regarding concomitant valvular disease may be obtained during the examination. <sup>20</sup>

#### **Guidelines for Revascularization**

In any discussion regarding the discrete indications for coronary revascularization, it is critical to bear in mind that the overarching goal of revascularization is to either improve

symptoms, prolong survival, or, inasmuch as is inextricably tied to both of these goals, to delay and prevent the complications of coronary disease in order to provide improved quality of life over the period of prolonged survival. With this fundamental principle in mind, the guidelines for surgical revascularization established by the ACCF/AHA were significantly revised in terms of organizational structure in 2011 to reflect this understanding (Tables 20-2 and 20-3). 10 These guidelines outline the recommendations regarding whether revascularization is indicated by either CABG or PCI in comparison to medical therapy in specific subsets of patients grouped primarily by the goal of revascularization (either improvement of survival or improvement of symptoms). Indications are then only secondarily stratified by the anatomic pattern and severity of coronary lesions, taking into account the number of involved vessels, involvement of the LMCA, the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD). Only after these two distinctions are made are the effects of baseline clinical scenario (eg, presence of diabetes, severity of left ventricular dysfunction, presence of unstable angina, non-ST elevation and ST elevation myocardial infarction [MI], and the calculated operative mortality, among others) taken into account to determine the recommendations for specific situations.<sup>21,10</sup> The basis for these guidelines resides in the large body of literature comparing medical therapy with CABG and PCI in patients with stable angina.

Recommendations are categorized into classes whereby Class I denotes that the benefit exceeds the risk and the procedure/treatment should be performed, Class IIa denotes that the benefit likely exceeds the risk and that it is reasonable to administer the treatment, Class IIb may be equivalent to or exceed the risk but additional studies are necessary to confirm, and that the treatment may be considered. Finally Class III represents a recommendation to not perform the procedure or treatment as it is known to have no benefit and in some cases be harmful.<sup>10</sup> Each recommendation is paired with a description of the strength of evidence available to support the recommendation, and ranges from Level A, denoting data derived from multiple randomized controlled trials or meta-analyses, Level B which denotes data from a single randomized trial or nonrandomized studies, and Level C which represents data from just consensus opinions from experts, case studies, and or previously established standard of care.10

The complexity of the guidelines reflects the overall complexity and heterogeneity of the patient population presenting with CAD. With the major components of the guidelines summarized at face value in Tables 20-2 and 20-3, this section of the chapter aims to simultaneously deepen and simplify the understanding of these guidelines by (1) providing the historical background from seminal randomized controlled trials and registry studies that provided the basis for how to assign patients with stable angina to surgical revascularization versus PCI or medical therapy, and (2) provide an update on the more recent trials that inform the current guidelines in order to provide a framework for how to approach a patient presenting with CAD today.

#### APPROACH TO THE LITERATURE

Before reviewing the results of the seminal trials of CABG versus medical therapy performed in the 1970s and those of newer prospectively randomized trials comparing the results of surgery with PCI and medical therapy, some limitations of these trials and of those that followed must be recognized. First, in retrospective or registry studies, it is difficult to ensure comparable patient populations by virtue of the extraordinary anatomical and physiologic complexity of CAD as well as the heterogeneity of the patient substrate. Differences in ventricular function and comorbidities such as age, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and pulmonary disease may have a profound impact on outcomes such as survival or quality of life. For example, caution must be exercised in interpreting the results of nonrandomized and registry reports of PCI versus surgery, because the patients subjected to the former more often have one- or two-vessel disease, 22,23 whereas the latter commonly have three-vessel or left main disease. 22,23 Attempts to correct for selection bias with statistical techniques such as propensity matching are only as valid as the parameters entered into the model. Data less tangible than gender or chronologic age, such as socioeconomic status or "physiologic age," are not easily accounted for in such analyses and yet may be a critical determinant of outcomes. Despite this limitation, retrospective and registry data provide a better glimpse of the real world of CAD. Most prospective randomized trials include only a fraction of the total population undergoing revascularization by virtue of strict entry criteria. For example, the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigators (BARI) trial entered only 5% of total patients screened.24 Although more recent randomized controlled trials of PCI versus CABG have had better yield (41-71%), these studies have focused on specific subset populations including patients with diabetes, and those with three-vessel and/or left main coronary disease. 4,25,26 Therefore, although the prospectively randomized studies do provide objective data directly applicable to the specific patient subset represented in the study, extrapolation of the results to the more heterogeneous populations seen clinically can only be made if the implicit caveats are clearly understood. We must be mindful of the inescapable tradeoff between selection bias in registry studies and entry bias in randomized studies.

Second, as a consequence of the overrepresentation of patients at lowest risk of death in randomized trials, most are statistically underpowered with respect to survival analysis. For example, given current survival statistics, we would need approximately 2000 patients in each arm of a study to detect a 30% difference in mortality. The problem is compounded by the exclusion of the very patients for whom one would anticipate a survival advantage with adequate revascularization, such as those with depressed ventricular function. Randomized studies frequently employ softer endpoints such as angina or quality of life, or create composites of qualitatively different endpoints, such as death, stroke, and MI. Meaningful analysis is further complicated

by relatively short-term follow-up in most studies. Events such as the need for subsequent revascularization and recurrence of angina characteristically occur at different time intervals after these therapies (restenosis after PCI vs graft occlusion after CABG), and an 8- to 10-year follow-up period is needed to adequately compare long-term results. Patients themselves are also generally interested in outcomes measured in years, not months.

Significant improvements in each of the treatment strategies for CAD are occurring constantly. Examples include the increased use of antiplatelet agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, lipid-lowering therapy, internal thoracic aortic (ITA) grafts, and drug-eluting stents (DESs). These advances, along with aggressive secondary prevention after revascularization, have steadily reduced the morbidity and mortality of CAD in all patients, making differences in the hard endpoint of survival difficult but not impossible to demonstrate for any therapy.<sup>27</sup> This trend will likely increase as the beneficial effect of secondary prevention becomes more widely appreciated.

# Comparative Trials of Revascularization versus Medical Therapy in Stable Angina

#### MEDICAL THERAPY

In the decades since CABG surgery was popularized and coronary angioplasty introduced, an enormous volume of data on the results of invasive revascularization has been collected. Remarkably, almost from the outset many of these studies have been prospectively randomized. Yet in the current era there is a dearth of data concerning pharmacologic therapies for chronic CAD despite remarkable recent drug development. For example, although nitrates are unquestionably effective in relieving symptoms, the impact of long-acting nitrates on clinical outcomes has never been rigorously tested. Furthermore, there has been only one trial of beta-blocker therapy in the treatment of angina, the Atenolol Silent Ischemia Study, which demonstrated benefit for patients with mild effort induced angina or silent ischemia.<sup>28</sup> There remain no randomized studies examining the impact of beta blockers on survival on patients with stable angina. The only evidence for improved survival with beta-blocker use comes from one recent registry study demonstrating a statistically insignificant trend toward improved survival for post-MI patients who received beta blockers.<sup>29</sup> A handful of studies of combination therapy with beta blockers and calcium channel blockers have also demonstrated antianginal benefit, but again without any evidence that there is any impact on survival. 30-32

#### SURGICAL VERSUS MEDICAL THERAPY

Three major randomized studies, the CASS,<sup>12</sup> the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study Group (VA),<sup>13,33</sup> and the ECSS,<sup>34,35</sup> as well as several other smaller randomized trials,<sup>36-38</sup> conducted between 1972 and 1984, provide the historical foundation for comparing the outcomes of medical and surgical therapy. Despite the limitations noted in the preceding, these studies are remarkably consistent in their major findings, and the qualitative conclusions drawn from them continue to be generalizable to current practice.

The central message from all of these studies is that the relative benefits of bypass surgery over medical therapy on survival are greatest in those patients at highest risk as defined by the severity of angina and/or ischemia, the number of diseased vessels, and the presence of left ventricular dysfunction.<sup>39</sup> For example, thus far, no study has shown survival benefit for CABG over medical therapy for patients with single-vessel disease not involving the proximal LAD. Accordingly, the current guidelines recommend that CABG be performed on a Class I recommendation for all unprotected left main disease, 39-41 three-vessel disease, 35,39,42-44 and two-vesseldisease with proximal LAD disease, 35,39,42-44 but only with a Class IIa recommendation for two-vessel disease without proximal LAD involvement if extensive ischemia exists, 45 and one-vessel proximal LAD disease. 10,46,47 It should be emphasized, however, that these trials involved primarily patients with moderate chronic stable angina. These conclusions may, therefore, not necessarily apply to patients with unstable angina or to those with more severe degrees of chronic stable angina.

A landmark meta-analysis by Yusuf et al, of the seven randomized trials cited in the preceding demonstrated a statistically enhanced survival at 5, 7, and 10 years, for surgically treated patients at highest risk (4.8% annual mortality) and moderate risk (2.5% annual mortality), but no evidence of a survival benefit for those patients at lowest risk.<sup>39</sup> The overall survival benefit at 12 years for the three large and four smaller randomized studies is shown in Fig. 20-1. Nonrandomized studies have also demonstrated a beneficial effect of surgery on survival of patients with multivessel disease and severe ischemia regardless of left ventricular function.<sup>25-28</sup>

Following this, between 1997 and 2004, there were three randomized controlled trials of invasive revascularization by PCI or CABG versus medical therapy. Their results make an even stronger case for revascularization. In the Asymptomatic Cardiac Ischemia Pilot (ACIP) trial, patients with anatomy amenable to CABG were randomized to angina-directed antiischemic therapy, drug therapy guided by noninvasive measures of ischemia, or revascularization by CABG or PCI.45 At 2 years, there was a statistically significant difference in mortality of 6.6% in the angina-guided group, 4.4% in the ischemia-guided group, and 1.1% in the revascularization group. The rates of death or MI were also statistically different at 12.1%, 8.8%, and 4.7%, respectively, that is, both symptoms and survival were improved with revascularization. The Medicine, Angioplasty, or Surgery Study (MASS-II) trial randomized patients with multivessel disease among medical therapy, PCI, and CABG. 48,49 Although survival at 1 year was equivalent, freedom from additional intervention was 99.5% for surgical patients and 93.7% for medically treated patients. Reintervention was, incidentally, even higher in the PCI group than the medical group, with 86.7% free of additional intervention. Angina was superior in the CABG

group (88%) than in the PCI group (79%) or medical therapy group (46%). Meanwhile the 10-year survival rates were 74.9% with CABG, 75.1% with PCI, and 69% with MT.<sup>49</sup> In the Trial of Invasive versus Medical Therapy in Elderly Patients with Chronic Symptomatic Coronary-Artery Disease (TIME) study, elderly patients were studied with chronic angina. This failed to demonstrate a difference between optimized medical therapy and an invasive revascularization strategy (PCI or CABG) in terms of symptoms, quality of life, and death or nonfatal MI (20% vs 17%, p = .71). However, medically treated patients were at higher risk because of major clinical events (64% vs 26% for invasive, p < .001), which were mainly attributable to rehospitalization and revascularization.<sup>50</sup> In this trial of severely symptomatic elderly patients, it was encouraging that the price of an initially conservative strategy, followed by crossover to revascularization in approximately 50% of patients, was not paid for in terms of death

Early historical concern over a prohibitive operative mortality among patients with impaired ventricular function has been superseded by the recognition that the survival of these patients on medical therapy was much worse than their survival with revascularization. This, coupled with ever-improving surgical techniques, such as advances in myocardial preservation and perioperative support, has made this specific subgroup the one in which the relative survival benefit of surgical therapy is the greatest. Accordingly, left ventricular dysfunction in patients with documented ischemia is now considered an important indication—rather than contraindication—for surgical revascularization. 10,12,39,51-53 More recently, the Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart failure (STICH) trial was conducted to better evaluate the effect of CABG plus optimal medical therapy to optimal medical therapy alone, an effect that the trial investigators perceived to not have been well-established by the studies referenced above considering (1) the general exclusion of patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction in the three landmark trials from the 1970s and (2) the improvements in both medical and surgical therapy that had developed since then.<sup>53</sup> The study of 1212 patients with an ejection fraction (EF) less than 35% and CAD amenable to CABG demonstrated a nonsignificant trend toward decreased mortality from any cause in the CABG group (36%) compared to the medical therapy group (41%). The trial has been criticized for being underpowered, and with just 56 months of mean follow-up and a large percentage of patients in the medical therapy group crossing over into the CABG group (17%) during the study period thereby potentially diminishing the statistical impact of CABG, many have interpreted this to represent evidence that the presence of left ventricular dysfunction remains an important indication to perform CABG for survival benefit. Indeed, the ACCF/AHA guidelines consider left ventricular (LV) dysfunction to represent a Class IIa recommendation for performing CABG if the EF is 35 to 50%, but only Class IIb recommendation if the EF is <35%, in part based on the results of the STICH trial.<sup>10</sup> In addition, recent evidence that ischemic, viable, hypokinetic myocardium (hibernating or stunned) regains

stronger contractile function after effective revascularization, has prompted expansion of the indications for surgical revascularization among patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction to include patients who would otherwise be considered candidates for cardiac transplantation.<sup>54</sup> This subject is discussed in more detail in the following.

In summary, the current guidelines recommend on the basis of a survival advantage that CABG be performed instead of medical therapy alone on a Class I recommendation for all unprotected left main disease,<sup>39,41</sup> three-vessel disease with or without proximal LAD involvement,<sup>35,39,42-44</sup> and two vessel-disease with proximal LAD disease<sup>35,39,42-44</sup>; with a Class IIa recommendation for two-vessel disease without proximal LAD involvement but with the presence of extensive ischemia,<sup>45</sup> one-vessel proximal LAD disease,<sup>10,46,47</sup> and moderate LV dysfunction (EF 35-50%)<sup>39,54-57</sup>; and with a Class IIb recommendation for two-vessel disease without proximal LAD disease or extensive ischemia,<sup>44</sup> and in patients with severe LV dysfunction (EF < 35%)<sup>39,53-57</sup> (Fig. 20-2).

Apart from affording a survival benefit, CABG is also indicated for the relief of angina pectoris and improvement in the quality of life. Between 80 and 90% of patients who are symptomatic on medical therapy become symptom-free after

CABG in the early period while approximately 60% remain symptom-free at up to 10 years. 49 This benefit extends to lowrisk patients for whom survival benefit from surgery is not likely.<sup>39</sup> Thus, for example, whereas on the basis of a survival advantage alone CABG is only indicated for one-vessel disease if the vessel involved is the left main (Class I) or the proximal LAD (Class IIa), a symptomatic patient with singlevessel disease in any anatomic position represents a Class I, Level A indication to perform either CABG or PCI on the basis of symptom improvement (Fig. 20-2). 10,49,50,58-60 Consensus agreement by the ACC/AHA recommends on a Class IIa basis CABG is recommended for patients with at least one significant coronary lesions in any position and unacceptable angina (1) for whom guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) cannot be implemented because of medication contraindications, adverse effects, or patient preferences; and (2) complex three-vessel CAD (eg, SYNTAX score > 22) with or without involvement of the proximal LAD and a good candidate for CABG (CABG preferred over PCI in this situation). 10,44,61-63 Relief of symptoms appears to relate to both the completeness of revascularization and maintenance of graft patency, with the benefit of CABG diminishing with time. Recurrence of angina following CABG surgery occurs at rates of 3 to 20% per year. Although enhanced survival is reported when an ITA graft is used to the LAD, there is no significant difference in postoperative freedom from angina. 46,47 This may be because of vein graft occlusion or progression of native disease in grafted or ungrafted vessels.<sup>13</sup>

Unfortunately, few patients experience an advantage in work rehabilitation with surgery as compared with medical management. Generally, employment declines in both groups and is determined nearly as much by socioeconomic factors as age, preoperative unemployment, and type of job as by type of therapy or clinical factors such as postoperative angina. Notably, surgical revascularization has not been shown to reduce the incidence of nonfatal events such as MI, although this may be because of perioperative infarctions that offset the lower incidence of infarction in each study follow-up. 64,65

#### PCI VERSUS MEDICAL THERAPY

PCI continues to evolve as a therapy from its historical roots as a procedure entailing balloon angioplasty alone, followed by the introduction of bare metal stents (BMSs), and subsequently DESs. Despite this evolution and the attendant reduction in overall in-stent restenosis rates in the DES era, and despite a multitude of evidence in both early and more recent trials demonstrating the ability of PCI to effectively reduce the incidence of angina compared to medical therapy in patients with stable ischemic heart disease, there remains no definitive evidence in any study to date that PCI improves survival rates or rates of subsequent MI in this patient population. <sup>43,60,66-71</sup>

It is worth describing the specifics of several representative studies on patients with multivessel disease. In the Randomized Intervention Treatment of Angina (RITA)–2, of 1018 patients with stable angina randomized to medicine

or PCI, one-third had two-vessel disease and 7% had threevessel disease. <sup>59</sup> Perhaps surprisingly, at a median follow-up of 2.7 years, the primary endpoints of death or MI had occurred twice as often in the PCI group (6.3 vs 3.3%, p < .02). Surgical revascularization was required during the follow-up interval in 7.9% of the PCI group and repeat angioplasty was required in 11%. In the medical group, 23% of patients required revascularization. Angina relief and exercise tolerance were improved to a greater degree in the angioplasty group early, but this difference disappeared by 3 years. These results are echoed in the MASS-II trial, in which angina relief was superior with PCI, but rates of intervention/reintervention were actually higher in the PCI group. <sup>48,49</sup> This supports an initial strategy of medical therapy in patients with stable ischemic heart disease.

More recently, the COURAGE trial randomized 2287 patients with stable angina and objective evidence of ischemia to contemporary medical therapy or PCI and medical management (3% of the stents used were DESs). All patients received long-acting metoprolol, amlodipine, and/or isosorbidemononitrate, as well as lisinopril or losartan. Patients had aggressive antilipid therapy and appropriate antiplatelet therapy. The primary finding of this trial was a lack of benefit of PCI over best medical therapy for death, MI, or other major cardiovascular events. <sup>60</sup> Although this result has caused much controversy in the cardiology community, it is consistent with older studies.

A meta-analysis of percutaneous interventions versus medical management was published in 2005.<sup>68</sup> In patients with stable CAD, no benefit was found for invasive therapy in terms of death, MI, or need for subsequent revascularization. In 2014, Windecker et al performed a large scale meta-analysis of 100 trials comparing both CABG and PCI to medical therapy found that patients who received new generation everolimus- and zotarolimus-based (Resolute) DESs but not older generation DESs (sirolimus, paclitaxel, and Endeavor zotarolimus), BMSs, or balloon angioplasty alone, had reduced mortality compared to medical therapy.<sup>71</sup> However, given the limitations of this study, including the inclusion of only one trial comparing newer generation DESs to medical therapy and absence of individual patient data, the general consensus remains that unless and until further evidence is collected to the contrary, all patients with stable coronary disease should have a trial of optimized medical therapy before invasive intervention in the form of PCI. Accordingly there are no Class I recommendations for PCI in the setting of stable ischemic heart disease in the 2011 ACCF/AHA guildelines. 10 Based on subgroup analysis from the SYNTAX trial (discussed further in the next section), however, it is recommended on a Class IIa basis for stable ischemic heart disease patients with unprotected left main disease for benefit if they meet the following criteria: (1) anatomic conditions associated with a low risk of PCI complications and have a high likelihood of good long-term outcome; for example, low SYNTAX score ≤22, ostial or trunk left main CAD; and (2) clinical characteristics that impart a high risk of morbidity and mortality with CABG (eg, Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS)-predicted mortality > 5%).<sup>72</sup>

#### PCI VERSUS CABG

Randomized Studies. A number of studies comparing an initial strategy of angioplasty versus early surgery have been carried out, all with similar results. It is important to recognize that, as a rule, these studies are comparisons of treatment strategies and not head-to-head comparisons of revascularization techniques. Accordingly, crossover is permitted and endpoints are selected to determine adverse consequences of the algorithm on an "intention to treat" basis.

Most early trials of CABG versus PCI have in common that PCI was performed first in the form of balloon angioplasty alone, followed by those including BMS deployment with angioplasty. In all, over 20 randomized controlled trials comparing CABG with PCI in the form of angioplasty or BMS implantation have been conducted, and on this basis the following conclusions were made by Bravata et al<sup>73</sup> in a recent systematic review and cited in the establishment of the ACC/AHA 2011 guidelines:10 (1) Survival is similar after CABG and PCI at both 1 year and 5 years, (2) incidence of MI was similar at 5 years after randomization, (3) CABG produced more effective relief from angina than with PCI at 1 and 5 years, and (4) repeat coronary revascularization was less frequent after CABG than after PCI. In other words, at least in the early era of PCI, CABG appears to have a benefit over PCI only insofar as it improves symptoms and reduces the need for repeat coronary revascularization, but without any improvement in overall survival or incidence, which reflects the results of even the earliest studies ever conducted on this topic, beginning with the 1994 Swiss trial of just 134 patients<sup>74</sup> and both the MASS<sup>75,76</sup> and MASS-II<sup>48,49</sup> trials. The oft-quoted BARI, Emory Angioplasty versus Surgery Trial (EAST), RITA, CABRI, and GABI multivessel PCI versus CABG surgery trials,77-81 with only a few nonreproducible exceptions, generally support the same conclusions above.

Most of the early studies quoted above share the limitation that, in general, only a very small minority of patients undergoing revascularization at any center were entered into these trials. 82,83 Accordingly, the populations included in the trials may not be generally reflective of clinical practice. For instance, few patients in these studies had significant LV dysfunction and most randomized patients had only one- or two-vessel disease. In the RITA trial, approximately one-third of patients had single-vessel disease.<sup>77</sup> Among clinically eligible patients in the BARI<sup>80,84</sup> and EAST<sup>81</sup> trials, approximately two-thirds of patients were excluded on angiographic grounds that included chronic total occlusion, LMCA stenosis, diffuse disease, or other anatomical factors making PCI potentially dangerous. Consequently, these randomized trials contain only a portion of the spectrum of patients with CAD encountered clinically. Entry bias has a significant impact on the likelihood of observing an outcome difference among therapies. Because a high proportion of the randomized patients are in the low-risk group, it is possible that any potential survival benefit of CABG surgery over PCI in high- and moderaterisk groups may be masked.<sup>83</sup>

A second consideration in evaluating these studies is that the success of revascularization procedures depends not only on the criteria employed to define success, but also on the interpretation of those criteria by both patient and physician. In the 1985 to 1986, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute PCI Registry, 99% of patients were discharged alive from hospital, and 92% did not sustain a MI or require CABG surgery.85 In the BARI trial, 99% of patients survived hospitalization and 88.6% of PCI-treated patients did not have MI or require repeat revascularization by angioplasty or surgery during the initial hospitalization.80 Employing event-free criteria (death, MI, CABG) for the initial hospitalization, PCI can be judged successful. However, if a repeat revascularization procedure within 5 years is regarded as a negative outcome, then far fewer patients are treated successfully. Regardless, the lack of differences in mortality or MI rates permits individuals to select one or the other procedure as initial therapy without the likelihood that they will pay a price with their health.

Considering event-free survival as a more meaningful endpoint than overall survival, several more recent studies of CABG versus early era PCI (balloon angioplasty only) have demonstrated an advantage with surgery. The Argentine Randomized Trial of Coronary Angioplasty versus Bypass Surgery in Multi-vessel Disease (ERACI) trial conducted between 1988 and 1990 demonstrated no difference in death or MI, but superior event-free survival in the CABG group at 1 and 3 years. 86,87 In the French Monocentric Study, 152 patients with multivessel disease underwent PCI or CABG.88 Again, superior event-free survival was seen in the surgical group, driven predominantly by a lesser need for subsequent revascularization. Comparing CABG to PCI with BMS implantation, Mercado et al performed a meta-analysis of the ARTS, ERATSII, MASS-II, and SOS trials that demonstrated similar rates of death, MI, or stroke at 1 year and higher repeat revascularization rates with PCI.89 A meta-analysis of 5-year data was also recently published, confirming the 1-year results with repeat revascularization significantly more frequent after PCI than CABG (29% vs 7.9%).90

In large part fueled by recognition of the relatively high rates of in-stent restenosis seen with bare metal stents (22-32% at 6 months), 91,92 many investigators had hoped that by lowering the rates of early restenosis,<sup>67</sup> the introduction of DESs to the PCI armamentarium might improve overall PCI outcomes and expand the indications for PCI over CABG in a wide variety of clinical scenarios. The Synergy between PCI with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery (SYNTAX) trial, assessed the optimal revascularization strategy for patients with threevessel or left main CAD by randomizing 1800 patients to either CABG or paclitaxel-based DESs.<sup>4</sup> At 12 months, the rates of MI and death were similar between groups, but stroke was significantly more common in the CABG patients (2.2%) vs 0.6% at 1 year). It should be noted that the CABG group had much less aggressive medical management postoperatively, including fewer patients on antiplatelet medications, which may account for some of the increase in stroke risk.

Despite the use of DESs, the rates of reintervention were still significantly higher (13.5% vs 5.9%) in the PCI group than the CABG group. Because of the lack of difference in early mortality and MI, some cardiologists have begun to suggest that left main should no longer be an indication for CABG.93 However, others maintain that the evidence for PCI is still inadequate and that the greater freedom from reintervention with CABG suggests that CABG remains the treatment of choice for patients with left main disease. 94 Meanwhile, the SYNTAX scores themselves, which grade the severity and complexity of coronary disease according to a variety of anatomic features (extent, location, severity), were defined in post hoc analyses as low for scores ≤22, intermediate for scores 23 to 32, and high if ≥33. While the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) for patients undergoing CABG versus PCI were similar in subgroup analysis of low SYNTAX score patients, those with an intermediate or high SYNTAX score had lower incidence of MACE with CABG.4 Furthermore, at 3-year follow-up, those with three-vessel disease had significantly lower mortality in the CABG group compared to the DES group (6.2% vs 2.9%).63 CABG appears to be preferable to PCI for those with diffuse and complex CAD. It is on this basis that CABG is recommended over PCI on a Class IIa basis for patients those with three-vessel disease (regardless of proximal LAD involvement) in patients with SYNTAX scores > 22 who are good candidates for CABG.<sup>10</sup>

Notably, the SYNTAX trial also brought to light the concept of the Heart Team approach, described in the SYNTAX trial as a system in which a team consisting of a heart surgeon, an interventional cardiologist, and often the general cardiologist (if available) discuss each case and decide on the basis of mutual agreement the optimal method of revascularization in multidisciplinary fashion. The Heart Team approach, while not validated by any follow-up randomized controlled trial is recommended on a Class I basis for all patients presenting with unprotected left main or complex CAD.<sup>10</sup>

Since the SYNTAX trial, there have been five additional randomized controlled trials comparing CABG to PCI. Two of these trials discuss PCI with DESs in comparison to minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass and therefore are less germane to the present discussion regarding on-pump CABG. The PRECOMBAT trial showed that PCI using DES was noninferior to CABG in UPLM at 2 years for composite endpoint and will be discussed further in the forthcoming section on left main disease.95 Meanwhile, the CARDia trial achieved the modest goal of demonstrating that in patients with multivessel CAD and DM, PCI with the use of DES is noninferior to CABG at 1 year with respect to a composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, MI, and stroke.96 The FREEDOM trial, which was designed similarly for a similar population but had nearly four times the study population size, demonstrated that for patients with DM and advanced CAD, CABG resulted in lower rates of the same composite endpoint compared to PCI with DES (18.7% vs 26.6%),<sup>26</sup> which is the first time a randomized trial of CABG versus PCI with DES has demonstrated this effect. A recent 2014 metaanalysis of six randomized trials of multivessel CAD whose

goal was to accurately reflect the more modern era in which DES and arterial grafts are used more frequently in PCI and CABG, respectively, demonstrated that with a weighted average follow-up of 4.1 years, CABG was associated with significantly lower mortality, lower incidence of MI, and repeat revascularization. These new findings, which now demonstrate a survival advantage and not just freedom from repeat revascularization and symptom improvement with CABG over PCI, were not available at the time of the writing of the 2011 ACCF/AHA guidelines, but have implications for the management of patients in the future if further evidence supporting the same conclusions is gathered.

Nonrandomized Database Comparisons. The information provided by randomized studies is complemented by information gleaned from large, prospectively managed, nonrandomized database studies. Such registries provide insight into the management of the sizeable population of patients who would not have been eligible for randomization. The 1994 Duke Cardiovascular Disease Databank study was one of the first large registry studies that established much of what we know today about the benefit of CABG compared to PCI insofar as it is dependent on the severity of coronary disease.<sup>22</sup> From a practical standpoint, in this database study and in the randomized trials, the effect of revascularization on survival depended largely on the extent of the CAD and is an example of the concept of benefit in relationship to a "gradient of risk." For the least severe (one-vessel) disease, there were no survival advantages of revascularization over medical therapy in up to 5 years of follow-up.<sup>22</sup> For intermediate levels of CAD severity (ie, two-vessel disease), there was a higher 5-year survival rate for patients undergoing revascularization than for those treated medically. For patients with the most-severe CAD (ie, three-vessel disease), CABG surgery provided a significant and consistent survival advantage over medical therapy. PCI appeared prognostically equivalent to medical therapy in these patients, but only a small number of patients in this subgroup underwent angioplasty. In comparing PCI with CABG surgery, PCI demonstrated a small survival advantage over CABG surgery for patients with less-severe two-vessel disease, whereas CABG surgery was superior for more severe two-vessel disease (ie, proximal LAD involvement).<sup>22</sup>

Several additional studies in the subsequent PCI with BMS era confirmed these findings. A study of 1999 cases from the New York State Database between 1993 and 1998 showed that a survival benefit was observed with angioplasty at 3 years for those patients with single-vessel disease not involving the LAD, whereas those with LAD or three-vessel disease had superior outcomes with surgery. In a much larger CABG versus PCI registry study from the BMS era, survival was again higher among the 37,212 patients who underwent CABG than among the 22,102 patients who underwent stent placement after adjustment for known risk factors (Fig. 20-3). This study has limitations of being a nonrandomized study and subject to bias; however, the surprising finding of a survival advantage apparent as early as 3 years postprocedure suggests that improvements in

**FIGURE 20-3** PCI is directed against specific culprit lesions. By bypassing diseased vessels, CABG surgery treats both culprit lesions and future culprit lesions.

cardiac surgical anesthetic care, myocardial protection, and intensive care management have at least matched if not surpassed advances in percutaneous technology. It is important to note that while PCI targets the culprit lesion, CABG surgery targets both the culprit lesion and potential future culprit lesions by bypassing the diseased vessel. Considering the finding that medium- and long-term clinical outcome after PCI (ie, beyond one year postprocedure) is more dependent on the progression of coronary disease in other culprit lesions than restenosis of the stented lesion, <sup>99</sup> this in part may explain the apparent mortality benefit derived with CABG that has persisted despite advances in stent technology that have resulted in lower restenosis rates (Fig. 20-3).<sup>100</sup>

In the DES era, five of six large registry studies concluded that patients undergoing CABG have lower mortality than those receiving PCI with DES. 62,101-105 In particular, the ASCERT study, upon which the Society of Thoracic Surgeons ASCERT Long-Term Survival Probability Calculator (ascertcalc.sts.org) is based, evaluated outcomes of almost 200,000 patients over the age of 65 years with multivessel disease undergoing nonemergent revascularization, and showed that although there was no difference in adjusted mortality in the CABG and PCI groups at 1 year, CABG patients had significantly lower mortality at 4 years (16.4% vs 20.8%).<sup>104</sup> The long-term benefit of CABG compared to PCI was independent of age, sex, diabetes, renal function, and lung disease and was evident even for patients with propensity scores most consistent with selection for PCI. Another registry study of over 105,000 propensity-matched United States Medicare beneficiaries undergoing either CABG or PCI between 1992 and 2008 showed that at 5 years, patients undergoing CABG had a higher survival rate (74.1% vs 71.9%), an effect which was more pronounced in those with diabetes, tobacco use, heart failure, and peripheral artery disease.<sup>105</sup>

In summary, although not void of limitations that randomized controlled trials and associated meta-analyses overcome, these large registry studies provide a more real-world picture of revascularization in actual clinical practice, and support the findings of newer randomized controlled trials that CABG confers survival benefit over PCI, especially in

patients with multivessel and complex CAD, even in the era of DES use and the attendant lower rates of restenosis.

## **Special Circumstances**

#### **ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROMES**

The acute coronary syndromes (ACS) cover a wide spectrum from ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI) with underlying coronary obstruction to Prinzmetal's or variant angina in patients with coronary vasospasm in the absence of significant underlying obstruction. The term non-STsegment elevation (NSTEMI) ACS encompasses the entities of unstable angina, non-Q-wave MI, and postinfarction angina. They denote acute, symptomatic imbalances of the myocardial oxygen supply-demand ratio over a short time span. Prinzmetal angina, or coronary vasospasm, is diagnosed definitively by electrocardiograms obtained during the episode of pain and is treated medically. Unstable angina is not a uniform clinical entity, but comprises the spectrum of myocardial ischemia between chronic stable angina and MI, and is defined as a recent change in the severity, character, or trigger threshold of chronic stable angina or new-onset angina. Approximately 5.6 million Americans have chronic angina, and about 350,000 develop new-onset angina each year. Unstable angina develops in approximately 750,000 Americans each year and is associated with subsequent MI in approximately 10%. Postinfarction angina is defined as the presence of angina or other evidence of myocardial ischemia in a patient with a recent (1- to 2-week) Q-wave or non-Qwave MI.

CABG in ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction. Prompt myocardial revascularization has been shown to improve outcomes compared to no reperfusion in almost all groups of patients who present after an acute STEMI. Because the degree of improvement in long-term outcomes is dependent on the time from symptom onset to revascularization, 106,107 PCI, which in general can be initiated more quickly that can CABG, is performed as the primary therapy in most cases, relegating CABG largely to a secondary position in this setting (performed in less than 5% of STEMI cases<sup>108</sup>). In the majority of PCI cases, the culprit lesion can be determined and successfully stented open, with subsequent improvement in myocardial ischemia. However, in certain cases where coronary disease is diffuse and not amenable to stent placement, or in the setting of complications from PCI such as coronary dissection, perforation with tamponade, stent deployment failure, or hyperacute stent closure, revascularization is either not technically possible or remains incomplete with ongoing ischemia. Emergency CABG in current practice is reserved and, in fact, recommended on a Class I basis primarily for survival benefit in the following circumstances: (1) after unsuccessful or complicated PCI with ongoing ischemia;109 (2) mechanical complication of acute MI requiring surgery including ventricular septal defect, free wall rupture, or papillary muscle with acute mitral regurgitation; (3) cardiogenic shock, defined as systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg for over 30 minutes requiring supportive measures, cardiac index ≤ 2.2 L/min/m², pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ≥ 15 mm Hg, and/or evidence of end-organ malperfusion; 106,107,110 and (4) patients with life-threatening arrhythmias in the presence of significant left main or threevessel CAD. 10,111 The SHOCK study randomized patients to emergency revascularization versus initial medical stabilization in patients presenting with STEMI and cardiogenic shock and found that among those who were revascularized early, CABG group (36%) of patients had similar survival to those undergoing PCI despite higher rates of diabetes and complex coronary anatomy in the CABG subset. 110

The timing of CABG after STEMI remains controversial, but overall the evidence suggests that mortality appears to peak in the 7-to-24-hour period after symptom onset. Several studies have shown that CABG with in-hospital mortality rates of 10.8% if performed within 6 hours of onset, 23.8% at 7 to 24 hours after onset, 6.7% at 1 to 3 days, 4.2% at 4 to 7 days, and 2.4% after 8 days. Another study showed that mortality was 6.1% for CABG performed within 6 hours, 50% at 7 to 23 hours, and 7.1% at 15 days or greater. <sup>109</sup> A reasonable approach appears to be emergency CABG within the 6-hour timeframe if possible to maximize myocardial salvage. Those who present after the 6-hour window would likely benefit from a delay of three to four days to improve survival and decrease bleeding complications. <sup>108,109,112</sup>

CABG in Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction and Unstable Angina. The initial approach to the patient with NSTEMI ACS is pharmacologic stabilization followed by risk stratification. The latter is based on multiple clinical, demographic, and ECG variables in addition to the use of serum biomarkers. The TIMI (Thrombosis in Myocardial Infarction) risk score, which takes into account a variety of the above clinical factors, is widely used as a prognostic tool to determine in patients with unstable angina or NSTEMI the 14-day risk of all-cause mortality, new or recurrent MI, or severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization, 113 and is often used to risk-stratify patients to a strategy of either immediate angiography, an invasive approach (angiography followed by revascularization by either PCI or CABG), or a conservative approach (initial period of medical therapy intensification). Those with hemodynamic instability, cardiogenic shock, severe LV dysfunction, persistent or recurrent angina at rest despite intensive medical therapy, mechanical complications, sustained ventricular tachycardia, and dynamic ST-T changes, are usually considered high risk irrespective of the TIMI score which does not account for these factors. Patients at intermediate or high risk (the majority) undergo early angiography with a view to revascularization. In many parts of the world, however, angiographic facilities are limited and an alternative approach based upon pharmacologic stabilization followed by mobilization and risk stratification using stress testing is employed.

In general for those undergoing angiography, the choice of PCI versus CABG is largely determined by the anatomy and specific clinical features as in the general population presenting with stable ischemic heart disease, as per the ACCF/AHA guidelines.  $^{\rm 10}$ 

#### ASYMPTOMATIC CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE

The role of revascularization either by PCI or CABG versus medical therapy in the setting of asymptomatic CAD has been studied in the ACIP trial.<sup>114</sup> Of 558 patients with CAD and medically controlled angina, treatment was randomized to either revascularization or medical therapy directed toward eliminating angina or eliminating ischemia during ambulatory ECG. Revascularization was more effective than medical therapy in relieving ischemia, and CABG was superior to PCI (70% freedom from ischemia vs 46%, p < .002). Mortality at 1 and 2 years was superior for revascularization as compared with angina-directed medical therapy, but not superior to ischemia-directed medical therapy. 45,114 The greatest benefit was among those patients with the most severe disease. Importantly, many of these patients with "silent ischemia" on ambulatory ECG monitoring did have symptomatic angina at other times and thus were not truly asymptomatic.

The documentation of ischemia, however, is critical. Several studies emphasize the flaws in the assumption that one can identify future culprit lesions in the absence of symptoms or documentation of ischemia. Among patients undergoing serial coronary arteriography who subsequently developed acute MI or unstable angina, the severity of stenosis at the time of initial angiogram is poorly predictive of the culprit lesion causing the acute ischemic syndrome. 115,116 In most cases the severity of the lesion responsible for subsequent ischemia was less than 50%, and in many patients it was not present at all on the initial angiogram, raising concern regarding the number of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients undergoing angioplasty without stress testing. 117 Bech and associates have demonstrated that fractional flow reserve exceeded 0.75 in 91 of 325 patients planned for PCI without noninvasive evaluation of ischemia, and that among those patients, angioplasty had no impact on event-free survival or angina. 118

#### **DRUG-ELUTING STENTS**

Recent progress in stent technology, particularly the introduction of DESs, has further reduced the incidence of restenosis. The use of stents has reduced adverse remodeling, and stents-eluting medications such as sirolimus, paclitaxel, or everolimus, are having a profound effect on the patterns of interventions for CAD. When compared with bare-metal stents, DES have not been shown to convey any advantage in terms of MI or mortality, but do demonstrate decreased rates of angiographic restenosis in a meta-analysis of 11 randomized trials.<sup>67</sup> The results of both randomized controlled trials and observational studies comparing CABG to PCI using DES are described in the preceding section, and suggest that the addition of DES, while successful in decreasing the restenosis rate inherent in BMS, the indications for PCI

and CABG have not changed.<sup>101</sup> Some of the most recent studies comparing these two strategies (FREEDOM trial, a meta-analysis of six randomized trials by Sipahi et al, and the ASCERT study)<sup>26,97,104</sup> have actually demonstrated a long-term survival benefit of CABG over PCI despite the use of DES in the PCI groups. It is important to note that because DES is associated with higher rates of in-stent thrombosis (as distinct from restenosis), patients receiving DES in general require 6 to 12 months of dual antiplatelet therapy (usually clopidogrel and aspirin) to minimize this risk.<sup>119</sup> Consideration for CABG or BMS should be given over DES on an individualized basis for patients in whom comorbid conditions will require withholding clopidogrel in order to perform subsequent surgery.

#### **LEFT MAIN DISEASE**

Left main CAD is present in about 5% of patients undergoing coronary angiography, 120 and when present is associated with multivessel CAD around in 70% of patients.<sup>4,94</sup> Significant unprotected left main disease (ie, left main disease without any preexisting distal CABGs) has been considered an indication for CABG rather than PCI for many years, but recently studies have begun to question this. A handful of registry studies<sup>25</sup> as well as subgroup analysis of the SYNTAX trial,<sup>72</sup> and finally several randomized trials of CABG versus PCI with DES $^{95,121}$  have suggested that PCI may be an acceptable method of revascularization in patients with left main disease. In a matched cohort of more than 1100 patients with unprotected left main disease, there was no difference in the rates of death or the composite outcome of death, Q-wave MI, or stroke between patients undergoing CABG or PCI despite a greater rate of target-vessel revascularization in the PCI group, including the patients who received DES.<sup>25</sup> The PRECOMBAT trial compared PCI using sirolimuseluting stents to CABG in patients with left main disease and found that the risk of major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events (MACCE) was not significantly higher after PCI compared to CABG at two years, but did have about double the incidence of repeat revascularizations. 95 A subgroup analysis of patients in the SYNTAX trial presenting with left main disease supported these findings by showing that PCI with a paclitaxel-eluting DES did not increase the 12-month rate of MACCE in comparison to CABG, but did have a higher rate of repeat revascularization.<sup>72</sup> Five-year outcomes also demonstrate the same findings qualitatively. 122 However, when grouped according to SYNTAX score, while those with low or intermediate scores had similar outcomes regardless of the method of revascularization, those with high-risk scores (>32) undergoing PCI had higher incidence of MACCE than CABG patients. 72,122,123 Based primarily on this evidence, the ACCF/AHA guidelines regard PCI as a Class IIa or IIb recommendation in patients with unprotected left main disease and stable ischemic heart disease depending on how favorable the anatomy and how high the overall surgical risk (Class IIa if SYNTAX score is ≤22 and STS-predicted mortality is ≥5%, Class IIb if SYNTAX score < 33 and STS-predicted mortality > 2%). 10 PCI may be performed on a Class IIa recommendation if the patient is having unstable angina/NSTEMI and is not a CABG candidate due to high risk of operative morbidity and mortality, or in the setting of a STEMI when distal coronary flow is grade 3 and PCI can be performed more rapidly than CABG. <sup>10</sup> For all other instances (ie, the majority of patients), until additional data are gathered to the contrary, CABG remains the definitive Class I-recommended treatment for most patients with unprotected left main disease. <sup>10</sup> The EXCEL trial which is currently ongoing seeks to compare CABG to PCI using newer generation everolimus-eluting stents in patients with unprotected left main disease.

#### SEVERE LEFT VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION

Left ventricular dysfunction is a predictor of increased operative risk for most cardiac surgical procedures, and in the early days of coronary revascularization these patients were not offered CABG. Like age, however, it is also a strong predictor of poor outcome with medical therapy. Accordingly, more recently significant LV dysfunction has been considered an indication rather than contraindication to surgical revascularization. In some patients, LV function has been shown to improve—sometimes dramatically so—after revascularization, leading to the concept of "hibernating" or "stunned" myocardium. 124,125 The identification of viable myocardium, which is potentially recoverable, depends on the identification of preserved metabolic activity by positron emission tomography, cell membrane integrity by thallium-201 or technetium-99m single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), or dobutamine stress echocardiography. 126

Five studies from the early era of CABG as well as several meta-analyses of these studies and others that followed showed that patients with LV systolic dysfunction (mainly mild to moderate) showed that CABG conferred improved survival in comparison to medical therapy.<sup>39,54-57,127</sup> In regards to severe left ventricular dysfunction, however, as mentioned above the STICH trial, showed no reduction in all-cause mortality for CABG in comparison to GDMT in patients with CAD amenable to CABG with an EF of <35%.53 CABG did, however, demonstrate a benefit compared to medical therapy with respect to the composite endpoint of death from any cause or (1) hospitalization for heart failure, (2) hospitalization for cardiovascular access, (3) hospitalization for any cause, and (4) revascularization with PCI or CABG. In other words, event-free survival was better with CABG in this population, suggesting that with longer follow-up, an overall survival benefit might resolve. The study is being continued out to 10 years of follow-up.

The relative roles of CABG and PCI in this population are not clearly defined despite the number of randomized trials of PCI versus surgery, largely because these patients were excluded from trial entry. In an early multicenter study of patients with left ventricular dysfunction (EF < 40%), slightly more than one-fourth of the patients died in the 2 years following multivessel PCI. <sup>128</sup> The majority of studies comparing CABG to PCI in this population have demonstrated similar survival, <sup>129-133</sup> while some showed improved outcomes with

CABG.<sup>62</sup> Overall, aside from the STICH trial, there remains a paucity of meaningful randomized trial data informing the choice of CABG versus PCI in the setting of left ventricular dysfunction. For patients with LV dysfunction and CAD amenable to revascularization, the recommendation is to perform CABG on a Class IIa basis if the EF is slightly depressed (35-50%), and on a Class IIb basis if the EF is very low (<35%) as long as the LMCA is not involved, in which case CABG is more clearly indicated.<sup>10</sup> The ACCF/AHA guidelines recommend that patients in this category should have the method of revascularization tailored to clinical variables such as the presence of renal disease, diabetes, and the complexity of the coronary anatomy.<sup>10</sup>

#### CHRONIC TOTAL OCCLUSION

Chronic, totally occlusion of a coronary artery is found on up to 20% of all coronary angiograms, and of these, threefourths have multivessel disease. 134,135 Revascularization is not possible nor attempted in 65% of patients with chronic total occlusion.<sup>134</sup> This population remains poorly studied in the randomized trials of multivessel PCI versus CABG as 35 to 37% of the patients excluded from the overall study were disqualified because of the presence of a chronic total occlusion of a coronary artery serving viable myocardium. Notably, the SYNTAX trial did not exclude patients with chronic total occlusion (a condition which alone contributes 10 to 15 points to the SYNTAX score), and found that complete revascularization, which has a known association with reduction in long-term mortality, MI, and repeat coronary interventions, 136 was significantly higher in patients treated with CABG compared to PCI (69% vs 49%).4 Considering that the presence of chronic total occlusion was the most common reason for the inability to achieve complete revascularization in the PCI group, this may account for the lower rates of major adverse cardiovascular events including death in the CABG group compared to PCI.<sup>135</sup> However, success rates for achieving complete revascularization by PCI continue to improve as the interventional cardiology community increases its aggressiveness in using PCI to treat these lesions, as evidenced by the recent launching of at least three trials (EXPLORE, DECISION-CTO, and EURO-CTO), all designed to determine the benefit of PCI in this setting compared to medical therapy. 134 In summary, CABG surgery improves survival in patients with multivessel and complex CAD compared with PCI, in large part due to the ability of CABG to provide higher rates of complete revascularization.

#### THE ELDERLY

Age is a predictor of operative risk in most models, but is also a predictor of poor outcome with medical therapy in the presence of CAD. Mortality is estimated to be approximately 8 to 11% in octogenarians after CABG.<sup>137</sup> The Swiss Multicenter Trial of invasive versus medical therapy in the elderly (TIME) trial examined 301 patients over the age of 75 years with chronic angina and randomized them to medical therapy with or without invasive evaluation.<sup>50</sup> Of those

undergoing angiography, two-thirds had revascularization. At the 1-year follow-up interval, there was no statistical difference in death or nonfatal MI rates. Symptoms and quality of life were also similar. However, there was a substantial increased risk of rehospitalization with revascularization in those who had medical treatment. Early interest in using offpump CABG as a method of reducing risk in the elderly has not demonstrated any benefit in comparison to traditional on-pump CABG in two randomized controlled trials focusing specifically on patients aged 75 years and older. 138,139 A recent propensity-matched analysis of 1932 patients in this same age group showed that CABG and PCI with DES outcomes were similar at a mean follow-up interval of 1.5 years, with a higher incidence of repeat revascularization in the PCI group, similar to the conclusions drawn from studies in younger populations. 140 These data suggest that invasive evaluation should be offered to elderly people who are symptomatic only after adequate medical therapy. The choice of mode of revascularization will be particularly impacted in this group of patients by the presence of comorbidities that may increase the risk of surgical intervention, such as cerebrovascular disease, renal dysfunction, and pulmonary disease.

#### **DIABETES MELLITUS**

It has been recognized for many years that patients with DM are at higher risk following percutaneous<sup>141</sup> or surgical<sup>142</sup> revascularization. The BARI trial was the first trial large enough to identify significant differences in outcome between diabetic and nondiabetic patients. In this study, which included 353 diabetic patients, a survival benefit was observed among insulin-dependent patients undergoing CABG with an ITA, as compared with those undergoing PCI. The explanation for this is not entirely clear, although an intriguing observation is that while the incidence of subsequent MI is similar between groups, survival after MI is superior among those who have undergone surgical revascularization.<sup>143</sup> In fact, unlike nondiabetics, diabetics suffering spontaneous Q-wave MI were more than 10 times as likely to die with their infarction if they had been treated with PCI as compared with CABG. This survival difference was even more pronounced at 7 years with 76.4% of diabetics in the surgical arm alive as compared with 55.7% in the angioplasty arm. 144

The physiologic basis for this difference remains a matter of speculation, although the completeness of revascularization may be a factor. Because of the significant incidence of restenosis after PCI in diabetics, Van Belle and colleagues<sup>145</sup> analyzed EF at 6 months and long-term cardiac mortality and morbidity among 513 diabetic patients stratified according to the presence of occlusive restenosis (n = 94), nonocclusive restenosis (n = 257), and no restenosis (n = 162). The mortality risk rose with restenosis (24% without restenosis, 35% with nonocclusive restenosis, and 59% with occlusion), and EF fell with occlusion (decrease of 4.8 ± 12.6%).

The results of the BARI trial prompted retrospective post hoc analyses of several earlier trials. The results have been variable. There was a nonsignificant trend for better survival among diabetic patients treated surgically in the EAST trial. <sup>146</sup> A meta-analysis of pooled data pertaining to diabetic patients from CABRI, EAST, and RITA, however, found similar 5-year mortality rates following CABG or PCI. <sup>147</sup> Meanwhile, a larger meta-analysis of 10 randomized trials showed that long-term survival rates in patients with diabetes were lower in patients receiving PCI with balloon angioplasty or BMS compared to CABG. <sup>133</sup>

The follow-up study to BARI, BARI-2D, <sup>148</sup> enrolled 2368 patients with DM and stable CAD and randomized them to receive either intensive medical therapy or intensive medical therapy and prompt revascularization (CABG or PCI left to clinical judgment). At 5 years there was no difference in survival or freedom from major cardiovascular events (MI or stroke) between medical therapy and revascularization groups. This trial was not designed to compare CABG and PCI in diabetes, but rather to examine a strategy of intensive medical therapy compared with revascularization. However, in the stratum of patients who received CABG, there were fewer major cardiovascular events when compared with medical therapy (22.4 vs 30.5%, p = .002). In the stratum of patients who received PCI, there was no difference in major cardiovascular events when compared with medical therapy.

In terms of more recent randomized trials, the SYNTAX trial showed that those with higher SYNTAX scores had higher rates of repeat revascularization after PCI than after CABG.<sup>149</sup> More importantly, the FREEDOM trial demonstrated the most definitive and current evidence that even in the DES era, CABG confers survival benefit over PCI in diabetics with multivessel disease. It compared CABG to PCI with sirolimus- and paclitaxel-eluting stents in 1900 patients with multivessel disease and diabetes and found that 5-year rates of a composite endpoint of death from any cause, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke were significantly lower in the CABG group compared to PCI (18.7 vs 26.5%)<sup>26</sup>, supporting the results of the BARI and BARI-2D trials, but with the added caveat that the difference in outcomes was driven by a lower rate of MI and death from any cause in the CABG group.

Diabetes is a condition characterized biologically by an inflammatory, proliferative, and prothrombotic state. This may account in part for the increased risk of restenosis and occlusion. Because diabetics tend to have more diffuse disease, the importance of complete revascularization, which is more often achieved surgically that percutaneously, may be enhanced. Another explanation may have more to do with patient selection than vascular biology. It has long been recognized from the previously cited studies that the survival advantage of CABG over medical therapy is greater the more extensive the coronary disease; and more recent studies of PCI versus CABG have demonstrated similar trends. Diabetic patients tend to have more extensive disease, and in BARI diabetic patients had a higher frequency of three-vessel disease, diffuse disease, proximal LAD disease, and left ventricular dysfunction.

From a clinical standpoint with regard to patient selection for coronary revascularization and the method of revascularization, the assessment of diabetics should be made on standard principles, namely the severity and extent of coronary disease, the potential for complete revascularization, the presence or absence of left ventricular dysfunction, and the technical suitability of the lesions for PCI. The results of the aforementioned studies suggest that a preference for surgical over percutaneous revascularization remains appropriate among diabetics, especially those with complex disease and/or ventricular dysfunction. As evident from the results of the FREEDOM and SYNTAX trials, this recommendation has not changed since the introduction of DESs.

#### **END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE**

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a growing problem. Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death among those with ESRD; therefore, there will likely be high rates of revascularization required in these patients in the future. Comorbidities complicating surgical or percutaneous revascularization, such as diabetes, hypertension, and calcified vessels, are more common in patients with ESRD, increasing the risk of intervention. A study conducted by the Northern New England Consortium found dialysis-dependent patients with renal failure to be 3.1 times more likely to die after CABG after adjusting for known risk factors (OR 3.1, [2.1 to 3.7], p < .001). They also found significantly increased rates of mediastinitis (3.6% vs 1.2%) as well as postoperative stroke (4.3% vs 1.7%). The long-term survival was also decreased with renal failure, which was found to be a highly significant predictor of mortality after adjustment. 151 Despite these risks, the prognosis without surgical correction of CAD is poor. Revascularization in patients with ESRD is associated with improved survival compared with medical management, 152-154 with some studies showing that CABG confers improved survival compared to PCI. 152,153,155-159

#### Concomitant Carotid Disease

Perioperative stroke remains one of the most dreaded complications associated with CABG, and aside from the debilitating features of the stroke itself, it is associated with 21 to 23% hospital mortality. 160,161 Concomitant carotid artery disease is present in approximately 8% of patients undergoing CABG (range 2-22%, depending on the definition of stenosis, method of diagnosis, and frequency of screening). 162-165 Its presence increases the risk of perioperative stroke in some 166-169 but not all studies, 170-173 and as such, the question of whether to intervene on the carotid artery, with the goal of decreasing the perioperative as well as long-term stroke rate, has garnered significant attention in the literature. Controversy continues regarding the utility and indications for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) either before (staged), during (concomitant), or after (reverse-staged) CABG, especially in patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis for whom data regarding increased risk of perioperative stroke are less wellestablished. This section will describe the relationship between extracranial carotid artery stenosis and neurologic outcomes after CABG and discuss the approach to determining whether and in what manner intervention on the carotid artery is indicated.

#### PERIOPERATIVE STROKE

Incidence and Causes of Perioperative Stroke. The overall incidence of perioperative stroke or TIA after CABG has been decreasing in the last two decades. Several large registry studies from prior to 2002 had estimated the incidence to be around 3%, 160,174 but recently a large registry study of almost 1.5 million patients undergoing isolated CABG between 2000 and 2009 in all STS-participating institutions has put that risk at about 1.2%.<sup>175</sup> The most common cause of strokes after CABG is not embolism from carotid plaques, but rather athero- or thromboembolism from complex plaques liberated from the ascending aorta as a result of direct physical manipulation inherent in the conduct of the CABG operation including cross-clamping, aortic cannulation, and the creation of proximal graft anastomoses. 176,177 Other causes include intracardiac emboli which can arise in the setting of valvular disease, atrial fibrillation, prosthetic valve implantation, suture lines, left-sided heart catheters, mural thrombus after MI, and less commonly, entrapped air. Finally, miscellaneous causes of perioperative stroke include small-vessel occlusive disease, cerebral hypoperfusion from low perfusion pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass, perioperative MI, acute arterial dissection from cannulation, and cerebral hemorrhage. Overall cardioembolic sources including those from the aorta and the aortic arch account for about 75% of perioperative strokes after CABG, while large artery stenosis, which includes carotid artery disease, accounts for 5%. 172 Although carotid disease is implicated in only a small minority of perioperative strokes, it is the one situation in which the surgeon can take definitive action to remove the pathology and in so doing, potentially also decrease the risk associated therewith.

Risk Factors for Perioperative Stroke. Age is one of the most well-established risk factors for the development of perioperative stroke. In a study from 1986, Gardner et al, showed that stroke rates increased with age, such that those younger than 45 years had stroke rates of 0.2%, rising to 3.5% for those in their 60s and 8.0% for those older than 75 years. 178 Another study in 1992 showed that stroke rates were 0.9% for those younger than 65 years but 8.9% for those older than 75 years. Other risk factors from the cardiac surgery literature include aortic calcification, renal failure, prior stroke, tobacco use, age, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, and carotid artery disease. 161,179

Relationship of Carotid Stenosis to Perioperative Stroke. There are several major studies dating back to the 1980s that show an increased risk of perioperative stroke after cardiac surgery in patients with significant carotid artery stenosis. In 1987, Brener and colleagues showed that among 4047 patients undergoing cardiac surgery, stroke or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) occurred in 9.2% of patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis (defined as greater than 50% luminal narrowing on carotid angiography), while those without had a stroke rate of 1.9%. <sup>166</sup> Faggioli and colleagues investigated this in 1990 and found similarly that those with

>75% carotid stenosis and age over 60 years, the rate of stroke was 15% versus 0.6% in patients in the same age group without carotid stenosis. 167 CEA appeared to have a protective effect; none of the patients who underwent this procedure concomitantly (19 patients) had strokes, while 14.3% (4 of 28 patients) who had carotid stenosis but did not undergo CEA developed strokes. 167 For patients 65 years or older, who are at higher risk of stroke from any cause to begin with, the degree of carotid artery stenosis was shown to affect the perioperative stroke rate such that the total neurologic event rate (stroke or TIA) was 2.5% for <50% stenosis, 7.6% for ≥50% stenosis, 109% for ≥80% stenosis, and 10.9% for unilateral occlusion. 180

It remains unclear, however, to what extent the presence of carotid stenosis in this patient population is the direct causative element in the development of perioperative stroke, or whether its main significance is as a marker of advanced overall cardiovascular disease. Determining which of the strokes occurring in those with significant carotid stenosis actually occur ipsilaterally has given further insight into what the actual impact of performing CEA would be, especially in asymptomatic patients. Several small retrospective studies have shown that the perioperative stroke rate directly attributable to ipsilateral carotid stenosis is small in asymptomatic patients. 172,173 Li et al showed that among 18 patients with ≥50% carotid stenosis who developed perioperative stroke after CABG, only four occurred on the same side as the disease itself, and that of these four, the carotid was totally occluded in three patients, that is, not amenable to intervention. Therefore only one of 18 strokes was potentially preventable by CEA. Since 2005, there have been four studies demonstrating a 0% rate of stroke in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis of ≥50% (n = 156) and  $\geq 70\%$  (n = 42). 170,171,181,182 These data suggest, though not definitively, that at least for asymptomatic patients, the risk of perioperative stroke directly attributable to the carotid stenosis itself may be minimal, lending credence to the idea that carotid disease is perhaps more of a surrogate and that prophylactic CEA may have little benefit.

Relationship of Uncorrected Carotid Stenosis to Late Stroke. The potential benefit of CEA in patients who have asymptomatic carotid artery disease has been shown to extend beyond the immediate perioperative period. Barnes et al showed that at 22 months following CABG in 40 patients with untreated asymptomatic carotid stenosis, the mortality rate was 10% while 17.5% had suffered a stroke. 183 One half of the patients had progression of the severity of carotid disease by noninvasive testing. Another study found that at 48 months, the risk of stroke after CABG in the setting of uncorrected significant carotid disease was 10%, that is, tenfold higher than patients who underwent combined CABG and CEA.<sup>184</sup> Contemporary randomized trials of surgery versus medical therapy for significant carotid stenosis have defined the late risk of carotid-related stroke in medically treated patients. In the Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery trial, actuarial risk of stroke at 5 years was 12% in medically treated patients with asymptomatic high-grade carotid stenosis.  $^{185}$ 

#### INDICATIONS FOR NONINVASIVE CAROTID TESTING

While some centers have practiced a policy of screening all patients undergoing CABG for carotid disease, studies have shown that identifying patients who are at high risk of having significant carotid disease to begin with can be screened selectively with negligible impact on the overall sensitivity. A retrospective analysis of 1421 patients undergoing CABG limited routine screening by ultrasound to only those that met the following criteria: age over 65 years, history of a stroke or TIA, and presence of a carotid bruit. 186 The investigators determined that this reduced the need for preoperative testing by 40% overall while missing only 2% of all candidates with ≥70% carotid stenosis. The ACCF/AHA issued a Class IIa recommendation that carotid artery duplex scanning should be performed for patients who have clinical features associated with a high risk of concurrent carotid artery stenosis, including age over 65 years, left main coronary stenosis, peripheral vascular disease, history of stroke or TIA, hypertension, smoking, and DM.<sup>10</sup>

# MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIC EVENTS IN PATIENTS AFTER CAROTID ENDARTERECTOMY

The incidence of CAD in the general population of patients undergoing CEA is high. A study from the Cleveland Clinic found that in patients studied with routine preoperative coronary angiography prior to planned CEA, only 7% had normal coronary arteries, while 28% had mild-to-moderate CAD, 30% had advanced but compensated disease, 28% had severe but correctable disease, and 7% had severe, inoperable CAD. 187 Early studies demonstrated that the risk of perioperative MI in the setting of CAD as significantly higher (4.3% compared to 0.5%). 188 Hertzer and colleagues showed that for patients undergoing CEA, MI caused more late deaths (37%) than did stroke (15%), with improved 10-year survival in the cohort of patients who had undergone incidental CABG compared to those with suspected but undocumented coronary disease (55% vs 32%). 189

# COMBINED CORONARY AND CAROTID REVASCULARIZATION

Guidelines for Combined Coronary and Carotid Revascularization. To date, there exist no randomized trials comparing a combined or staged approach to carotid disease in asymptomatic patients to CABG alone. The CABACS trial which began in 2010 is currently ongoing and will report on the relative incidence of strokes and death from any cause by randomly assigning patients to concomitant (ie, synchronous) CEA and CABG versus CABG alone in patients with high grade carotid stenosis undergoing CABG. 190 Until then, the current guidelines from the ACCF/AHA are based on a large body of retrospective data that have not conclusively established the optimal approach

to treating this patient population. Indeed, the formal Class I recommendation is that for patients with clinically significant carotid artery disease for whom CABG is planned, a multidisciplinary team consisting of a cardiac surgery, cardiologist, neurologist, and vascular surgeon should convene and determine an individualized plan regarding whether and when to perform CEA.<sup>10</sup> Meanwhile, for patients with a previous TIA or stroke and a significant carotid artery lesion (≥50% stenosis), combined CABG and carotid revascularization is recommended on a Class IIa basis. The sequence and timing of intervention is determined by the relative magnitudes of cerebral and myocardial dysfunction.<sup>10</sup> Finally, in patients scheduled for CABG who have no history of TIA or stroke but have bilateral severe (70-99%) carotid stenosis or unilateral severe carotid stenosis with a contralateral occlusion, combined carotid revascularization is recommended on a Class IIb basis. 10

These guideline recommendations notwithstanding, Cambria and colleagues at our institution have argued that if one accepts that (1) uncorrected carotid stenosis is associated with an increase in stroke risk for patients with severe carotid and CAD who have only isolated CABG; (2) CEA is the indicated treatment for severe symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid stenosis; (3) CAD increases the early and late risk of death for CEA patients; and (4) CABG is an indicated treatment for CAD, then the important question becomes not the indication for but the timing of the two operative procedures. It is on these grounds that some surgeons in our institution have, since the 1970s, taken an aggressive approach to patients with both CAD and carotid stenosis, with the concomitant operation used as the standard approach.

Staged versus Concomitant Carotid and Coronary Artery Operations. The technique of performing CEA before coronary bypass grafting is referred to, by convention, as a *staged procedure*, while performing the CABG first and the CEA in delayed fashion is termed a *reverse staged procedure*. Performing both procedures under the same general anesthetic administration is a *concomitant procedure*.

On the one hand, performing CEA first might increase the risk of perioperative MI, while performing CABG first might increase the risk of perioperative stroke. If the patient does not have signs of active ischemia or hemodynamic instability, especially if the CEA can be performed safely with regional anesthesia, most agree that performing CEA first is a reasonable strategy. This argument is strengthened further in elderly patients with a history of prior stroke or TIA in whom the incidence of perioperative MI might be expected to be significantly higher. Meanwhile, for patients with active ischemia and/or hemodynamic instability secondary to coronary disease, the reversed staged procedure is sometimes favored, especially for those with asymptomatic carotid stenosis and no history of stroke or TIA. These general principles are considered on a case-by-case basis without the benefit of any randomized controlled trial data to definitively support one strategy versus the other.

The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) systematically reviewed all studies with over 50 patients comparing staged versus concomitant CEA and CABG and found that for nine studies evaluating concomitant CEA and CABG, the overall rate of stroke was 3%, while MI occurred in 2.2%, and death in 4.7%. In the one study included in this review describing staged CEA followed by CABG, the stroke rate was 1.9%, while MI occurred in 4.7%, and death in 1.6%. The AAN concluded that there was no clear general argument for one strategy versus the other based on these data. <sup>191</sup>

At our institution, the concomitant approach has been the standard strategy for most patients presenting with asymptomatic severe carotid stenosis and CAD amenable to CABG. Akins et al published a series of 500 patients who underwent a concomitant operation between 1979 and 2001 and found that hospital mortality was 3.6%, MI rate was 2.0%, and stroke occurred in 4.6%. 192 While 66% were neurologically asymptomatic preoperatively, 21% had prior TIAs while 13% had a prior stroke. The degree of coronary disease was relatively severe with 75% presenting with three-vessel disease and 42% presenting with significant left main disease. Three-fourths had unstable angina, and 53% had prior MI. The operation was performed either urgently or emergently in 54% of patients. In other words, the outcomes delineated above are rather favorable considering the patient population included. Of the 23 strokes that occurred, 12 were ipsilateral to the CEA and 11 were contralateral or bilateral, suggesting that this strategy may have neutralized the impact of carotid stenosis as a risk factor for stroke during CABG. The upcoming CABACS trial will, as the first randomized trial to shed light on the question of how these interventions should be sequenced, shed some light on the controversy inherent in these results, albeit on a significantly limited subset of the patients seen in actual clinical practice, that is, those undergoing elective CABG who have asymptomatic carotid stenosis. 190

#### PREDICTION OF OPERATIVE RISK

Prediction of risk-adjusted outcomes permits both the surgeon and the patient to weigh the potential benefits of operation against risks of perioperative morbidity and/or mortality. The patient's comprehension of benefit versus risk is paramount to informed consent before coronary artery bypass surgery. Accurate risk-adjusted prediction of postoperative morbidity and mortality also provides an important quality improvement tool to understand and examine the variability in institutional and individual surgeon performance.

A number of cardiac surgery databases have been used to develop risk models for predicting operative morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing CABG.<sup>21</sup> One of the more user-friendly risk assessment tools is that provided by the STS Risk Calculator (http://www.sts.org/quality-research-patient-safety/quality/risk-calculator-and-models/risk-calculator), which provides an assessment of individual patient operative risk derived using the STS database (Table 20-4). The STS risk algorithm is proprietary and is based on data voluntarily

submitted by participating centers on 503,478 patients undergoing isolated CABG in the United States from 1997 to 1999; the application is available for public use.

Overall, the average risks of 30-day operative death and major complication for patients reported to the STS database undergoing CABG from 1997 to 1999 were 3.05 and 13.4%, respectively. Specific complications included stroke (1.6%), renal failure (3.5%), reoperation (5.2%), prolonged ventilation (5.9%), and sternal infection (0.63%). Risk models were developed using multivariate analysis to stratify the strength of the association from among 30 potential preoperative risk factors for mortality and major complications as shown in Tables 20-5 and 20-6. Except for deep sternal wound infection, the development of any of these complications correlated with an increased risk-adjusted operative mortality. 193

A preliminary sense of operative mortality can be derived simply from an understanding of the core variables most predictive of risk in the aforementioned data sets. The strongest predictors of operative mortality include nonelective surgery, low EF, and prior heart surgery. Chronic comorbidities are also associated with an increased operative mortality after coronary bypass, including treated diabetes, peripheral vascular occlusive disease, chronic renal insufficiency, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).<sup>21</sup>

#### **Patient Evaluation**

Regardless of the risk model applied, there is no substitute for clinical evaluation of the patient. Unfortunately, all too often

Any major complication is defined as the composite outcome of stroke, renal failure, prolonged ventilation, mediastinitis, or reoperation. Data collected from 503,478 patients undergoing isolated CABG in the United States from 1997 to 1999 from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons' database.

the assessment focuses disproportionately on coronary anatomy and insufficiently on the nature, duration, and severity of ischemic symptoms, as well as signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF). In addition, history of or coexisting cerebrovascular and/or peripheral vascular disease, malignancy, sternal radiation, COPD, DM, or renal and/or hepatic insufficiency can have major impact on the operative morbidity and even mortality, not all of which are captured in risk models.

Current medications and dosages with special attention to antiplatelet agents such as clopidogrel must be reviewed. Operation in the setting of recent clopidogrel use is associated with excessive bleeding and need for reoperation. Most surgeons recommend 5 days from the last administered dose of clopidogrel before undertaking CABG with cardiopulmonary bypass. The same holds true for several new antiplatelet medications routinely used in clinical cardiology practice, such as prastagril as well as medications used as substitutes for warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation (eg, dabigatran).

Physical examination of the lungs and heart should focus on the stigma of ischemic and valvular heart disease. Cardiac murmurs warrant further evaluation. Additionally, the adequacy of presternal soft tissues to permit wound closure should be considered and evidence of venous varicosities or prior vein stripping may impact plans for conduit harvest. Peripheral pulses should be documented as their presence or absence may impact from which leg to harvest the vein or

place an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). A detailed neurologic examination of the ulnar, radial, and median nerves should be document in the case of planned radial artery (RA)

Diagnostic evaluation should be directed by the clinical assessment, but at a minimum should include a renal panel (creatinine), complete blood count, and chest x-ray. The ECG should be reviewed for the evidence of previous MI and conduction abnormalities. Radiologic evaluation should rule out concomitant neoplasm, active pulmonary infection, and/ or ascending aorta calcification; the latter should be further assessed with a noncontrast computed tomographic (CT) scan because it will impact the location for arterial cannulation and aortic cross-clamp placement.

Hemodynamically significant coronary artery lesions on angiography are conventionally defined as those lesions with a 50% loss of arterial diameter, which is sufficient to impair coronary blood flow reserve and distal coronary pressure.<sup>21</sup> An assessment should be made of left ventricular function and regional wall motion abnormalities as well as the presence and degree of valvular abnormalities, including aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation with echocardiography. Left ventriculography is not routinely performed and is reserved for patients who require direct pressure measurements of left ventricular pressures to further assess the gradient through the aortic valve. In cases where a previous sternotomy has

been performed and the internal thoracic arteries have not been utilized, their patency and integrity should be assessed at the time of cardiac catheterization since these conduits could have been injured at the time of sternal wire placement during chest closure. This becomes especially important if the saphenous veins are not available for the procedure and revascularization is dependent on the integrity of the internal thoracic artery (ITA).

It is in the surgeon's best interest to develop a good relationship with the patient and his or her significant others. Specifics including the risks, benefits, and alternatives to surgery need to be discussed to permit an informed decision. Ideally, this discussion is held in the presence of the patient's significant others, because patients often have difficulty absorbing the details of the discussion at the time related to the stress of the situation. Should the patient experience a major complication or mortality, it is often the patient's significant others with whom the surgeon will most often interact. Additionally, anticipated need for postoperative rehabilitation, as well as the time course of recovery is also of interest to all parties. A clear understanding of the expectations for the perioperative period will reduce everyone's anxiety about surgery and may promote early patient recovery. Good rapport with patients and their significant others is also the physician's best protection from litigation should untoward events occur.

#### **BYPASS CONDUITS**

## Internal Thoracic Artery

The left ITA as a bypass graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery has been proven to provide superior early and late survival and better event-free survival after CABG. 46 The unparalleled long-term patency and better clinical outcomes associated with the use of the ITA make it the conduit of first choice for anastomosis to the left anterior descending coronary artery in almost all patients regardless of age, and establish an argument to use the right ITA as conduit to other targets as well.

#### **CHARACTERISTICS**

The ITA demonstrates remarkable resistance to development of atherosclerosis, which may be in part attributable to a greater resistance of its endothelium to harvest injury as compared with the saphenous vein. Under electron microscopy examination, thrombogenic intimal defects are essentially nonexistent in the ITA but are commonly detected in venous grafts. Perhaps more significantly, however, is the nonfenestrated internal elastic lamina of the ITA that may inhibit cellular migration, thereby preventing initiation of intimal hyperplasia. In addition, the medial layer of the ITA is thin, with fewer smooth muscle cells and a lesser proliferative response to known mitogens such as platelet-derived growth factor and pulsatile mechanical stretch. 196,197

The endothelium of the ITA is itself unique as well. With a significantly higher basal production of the vasodilators nitric oxide and prostacyclin, the ITA demonstrates a favorable response to pharmacologic agents commonly used in the postoperative period. For instance, the ITA shows vasodilation in response to milrinone and yet does not vasoconstrict in response to norepinephrine. 198 Furthermore, nitroglycerin causes vasodilation in the ITA, but not in the saphenous vein. 199 The endogenous secretion of such vasodilators may also have a "downstream" effect on the coronary vasculature, explaining the common observation that the native coronary vessel itself often appears relatively protected from progressive atherosclerotic disease distal to the anastomosis. Finally, the ITA exhibits remarkable remodeling over time, adapting to the demand for increased flow by often increasing in diameter over time as observed on late postoperative angiograms, a phenomenon mediated by the endothelium.200

# SURGICAL ANATOMY OF THE INTERNAL THORACIC ARTERY

The ITA arises from the undersurface of the first portion of the subclavian artery opposite the thyrocervical trunk. The left ITA originates as a single artery in 70% of patients and as a common trunk with other arteries in 30%. In contrast, the right ITA originates as a single artery in 95% of cases. <sup>201</sup> At the level of the clavicle and the first rib, the ITA passes at first downward and medially behind the subclavian

vein and lateral to the innominate vein. In this area, the phrenic nerve crosses the ITA from its lateral to its medial side, before contacting the pericardium. The phrenic nerve crosses anterior to the ITA 66% of the time on the left and 74% of the time on the right.<sup>201</sup> It is important to keep these relations in mind to avoid phrenic nerve injury during proximal ITA harvest.

Below the first costal cartilage the ITA descends almost vertically and slightly laterally at a short distance from the margin of the sternum. The ITA lies posterior to the cartilages of the upper six ribs and the intervening internal intercostal muscles. In the upper chest there is a bare area of variable length where the ITA is covered only by the endothoracic fascia and parietal pleura. Below this level the transversus thoracis muscle covers the posterior surface of the ITA. The mean distance of the left ITA from the sternal margin at the level of the first intercostal space is 10.5 ± 3.2 mm, whereas at the level of the sixth intercostal space the distance increases to 20.0 ± 6.7 mm. The right ITA is slightly closer to the sternal margin than the left ITA. At the level of the sixth rib the ITA bifurcates into its terminal branches: the musculophrenic and superior epigastric arteries. The length of the ITA in situ ranges from 15 to 26 cm, with a mean of  $20.4 \pm 2.1$  cm; the left ITA is slightly longer than the right.<sup>201</sup> A pair of internal mammary veins (venae comitantes) accompanies the ITA; at the most superior portion these veins form a single vessel, which runs medial to the artery and drains into the innominate vein.

#### PEDICLED HARVEST TECHNIQUE

After the sternum is divided, the left ITA is harvested using an internal mammary retractor to expose the internal mammary bed (Fig. 20-4). Excessive distraction of the sternal leaves can cause costal fractures or dislocation of the costosternal joints, resulting in severe postoperative pain as well as brachial plexus injury. The parietal pleura and loose connective tissue with accompanying fat is dissected away from the chest wall. It is our preference to enter the left pleural space widely to allow easier exposure of the ITA, especially in its most proximal aspect, and to permit the ITA to fall into a more lateral and posterior path upon wound closure, keeping the ITA medial to the lung, lateral to the pericardium, and away from the posterior table of the sternum. This makes it less susceptible to injury during potential sternal reentry in the future. Slightly rotating the operating table to the patient's left and decreasing the patient's tidal volume can aid in the visualization.

The ITA is identified lateral to the border of the sternum by inspection of the bare area or by palpation in the area of artery covered by muscle. It can be harvested using either a pedicled, semiskeletonized, or a skeletonized technique. When taken as a pedicle, the dissection plane can be started in the bare area of the ITA at the level of the third or fourth rib or at the level of the lower sternum. The intercostal space is avoided as the initial point of exposure because it contains the branch vessels. The endothoracic fascia is incised medially for

FIGURE 20-4 Internal thoracic artery (ITA) harvest. A selfretaining mammary retractor is used for exposure of the ITA bed. The left pleura is dissected away from the mammary pedicle and opened along the course of the ITA. The endothoracic fascia is incised medial and lateral to the ITA pedicle. The pedicle is carefully separated with blunt dissection from the underside of the rib. Gentle traction on the pedicle exposes arterial and venous branches at the level of the intercostal spaces; vessels are clipped on the ITA side and cauterized or clipped on the chest wall side. The proximal dissection is carried to the inferior border of the subclavian vein; the distal dissection is then carried to the level of the ITA bifurcation. The trans versus thoracis muscle must be divided to expose the ITA bifurcation. The ITA is divided after full heparinization, either at the end of harvest or just before grafting of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery.

a distance of about 4 cm using the electrocautery at low setting (ie, 20). The pedicle is carefully separated from the chest wall using gentle blunt dissection with the electrocautery tip. Exposure can be enhanced by pushing the pedicle away with closed forceps or by gently grasping the fascia. The ITA is a fragile vessel and the conduit should never be grasped with the forceps. Gentle posterior traction on the pedicle allows exposure of arterial and venous branches, which should be clipped and divided.

After the pedicle has been freed for about 4 cm, the endothoracic fascia is incised laterally, allowing the pedicle to fall away from the chest wall. Dissection is continued proximally and distally to the level of the subclavian vein and ITA bifurcation. Attention should be given to avoid injury to the phrenic nerve during the proximal exposure. Once the dissection is completed, the patient is heparinized (fully or partially) and the pedicle sprayed with a papaverine solution (1 cc [30 mg] of papaverine added to 9 cc of saline). Three minutes after heparinization, the distal ITA is doubly clipped just proximal to the bifurcation and the artery divided. An atraumatic bulldog clamp is applied to the distal end of the artery and the pedicle is kept in a papaverine soaked sponge until the vessel is anastomosed to the arterial target. Alternatively, the pedicle may be left in situ and transected just before using the conduit.

# SKELETONIZATION OF THE INTERNAL THORACIC ARTERY

Sternal blood flow decreases significantly after pedicled ITA harvest. Skeletonized harvest, however, reduces the degree of sternal ischemia. Two prospective randomized studies assessing sternal blood supply using bone scan with SPECT after skeletonized and pedicled harvest have demonstrated significant reduction in sternal vascularity after pedicled harvest, whereas skeletonized harvest resulted in minimal change in sternal blood supply. Multivariate analysis found harvesting technique to be the only factor responsible for postoperative sternal ischemia. <sup>202,203</sup>

Low rates of sternal wound infection have been reported using skeletonized bilateral ITA harvest. Matsa and associates observed a deep sternal wound infection rate of 1.7% among 765 patients undergoing bilateral skeletonized ITA harvest. Of note, sternal complications occurred in only 2.6% of 231 diabetic patients in this study, which was not significantly different from that of the nondiabetic patients.<sup>204</sup> In Calafiore and coworkers' review of 842 patients undergoing bilateral skeletonized ITA harvest compared with a historical nonskeletonized bilateral ITA control group, skeletonized harvest was associated with a reduced incidence of sternal wound complications (4.5%) versus pedicle harvest (1.7%). Diabetic patients in the study derived the greatest benefit from skeletonized harvest with respect to sternal wound complications: 10% in the pedicle harvest versus 2.2% in the skeletonized harvest groups.205

Using the skeletonized harvest technique, only the artery is mobilized, leaving the internal thoracic venous plexus intact. Although skeletonization is a technically more demanding and time-consuming procedure, it increases luminal diameter and free flow compared with a pedicled graft, and also provides a longer conduit. One Some surgeons have expressed concerns regarding functional integrity, vasoreactive profile, and early and long-term patency; however, several investigators have shown no difference in endothelial integrity, endothelial-dependent or neurogenic-dependent vasoreactivity between the techniques of pedicle or skeletonized harvest. One Surgeons Furthermore, there does not appear to be any difference with respect to early and midterm patency.

#### **PATENCY**

The superior late patency of an ITA graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery compared to a saphenous vein graft (SVG) was initially demonstrated by Barner and colleagues in the 1985.<sup>211</sup> Superior patency translates into improved 10-year survival (left internal thoracic artery [LITA]-to-LAD artery 82.6% vs SVG-to-LAD artery 71%) with less incidence of MI, hospitalization for cardiac events, and cardiac reoperations.<sup>46</sup> The superior performance of ITA grafts appears to persist in the current era despite the use of agents to improve vein graft performance. In the BARI trial the patency rates at 1 and 4 years for ITA grafts were 98 and 91% compared with vein grafts, which were 87 and 83%, respectively.<sup>212,213</sup> The superior patency of the ITA becomes

even more prominent with longer follow-up. In an angiographic study of 1408 symptomatic post-CABG patients, patency rates for the LITA at 10 and 15 years were 95 and 88%, respectively, whereas SVG patencies were 61 and 32% at the same time intervals.<sup>214</sup>

## Radial Artery

The use of the RA as a conduit for coronary bypass was originally described by Carpentier and associates in 1973. Spasm of the artery was common during surgery and was managed by mechanical dilation. The initial results were disappointing with 32% of grafts occluded at 2 years.<sup>215</sup> Accordingly, the RA was abandoned as a conduit for CABG. Acar and colleagues revived the use of the RA after several grafts, angio-graphically demonstrated to be "occluded" early postoperatively, were patent during restudy 15 years later. Acar postulated that harvest injury was responsible for the spasm/graft occlusion.<sup>216</sup> Proponents of the RA as a conduit have demonstrated encouraging mid- and longterm results with a pedicled harvesting technique and pharmacologic manipulation to prevent RA vasospasm.<sup>217</sup> As a result, this conduit has enjoyed a remarkable resurgence of interest as a supplementary arterial conduit for coronary revascularization.

#### **CHARACTERISTICS**

Histologically, the RA has a fenestrated internal elastic lamina and a thicker wall than the ITA with a higher density of myocytes in its media. The RA is also more likely to have atherosclerotic changes at the time of harvest than the ITA, with 28% of RAs having some degree of demonstrable atherosclerosis, as compared with only 6% of ITAs. Whether these differences indicate that the RA will prove more susceptible to graft atherosclerosis with reduced patency is unknown. 219

Physiologically, the RA is equally sensitive to norepinephrine as the ITA; however, given its greater muscle mass, it generates a higher force of contraction, accounting for its well-recognized propensity for spasm.<sup>220</sup> Fortunately, the RA also readily responds to a variety of vasodilators, including calcium channel blockers, papaverine, nitrates, and milrinone. In vitro, nitroglycerine appears to be the most effective agent for inhibiting and reversing RA spasm.<sup>221</sup> Additionally, nitroglycerin has been shown to be better tolerated clinically, equally effective, and less expensive than diltiazem in prophylaxis of RA spasm after CABG in a prospective randomized trial.<sup>222</sup>

#### SURGICAL ANATOMY OF THE RADIAL ARTERY

The RA originates from the brachial artery just proximal to the biceps tendon. In the proximal forearm the RA courses underneath the brachioradialis muscle. As it courses distally, it emerges from the lower surface of the muscle, becoming more superficial, and runs beneath the antebrachial fascia between the tendon of the brachioradialis muscle and the flexor carpi radialis muscle and anterior to the radius and

pronator quadratus muscle. The recurrent RA originates from the lateral aspect of the RA soon after its origin from the brachial artery. Multiple small muscular branches emerge from the deep and lateral surfaces of the artery. At the wrist the RA gives rise to the palmar carpal branch, the dorsal carpal branch, the superficial palmar branch, and the deep palm. Throughout its course, the RA is accompanied by a rich plexus of venae comitantes. The average length of the RA ranges between 18 and 22 cm with an internal diameter of 2 to 3 mm. <sup>224</sup>

#### HARVEST TECHNIQUE

It is most common to consider the patient's nondominant arm for harvest, partially out of concern for the impact of even subtle neurologic changes, and partially given the convenience of harvesting the left RA simultaneously with the left ITA. The extremity of interest must have adequate ulnar collateral circulation to ensure viability of the hand. Assessment of collateral circulation is best performed via noninvasive duplex ultrasonography. The RA of the dominant hand can also be harvested if needed. Tatoulis and associates reported 261 patients undergoing bilateral RA harvesting with safe functional outcomes of both extremities. The patients are patients undergoing bilateral RA harvesting with safe functional outcomes of both extremities.

The arm is prepped circumferentially and the hand wrapped in a sterile fashion. The upper extremity is placed on an arm board perpendicular to the long axis of the operating table. As shown in Fig. 20-5, a medially curved incision is made on the skin overlying the RA from a point 2 cm proximal to the styloid process of the radius to a point 2 cm distal to the elbow crease and 1 cm medial to the biceps tendon. The subcutaneous tissue is divided with the cautery. The dissection can be initiated at either end depending on the surgeon's preference. The deep fascia of the forearm is incised directly over the RA.

The RA is harvested as a pedicle with minimal manipulation using sharp dissection, diathermy, or the harmonic scalpel (our preferred method). There are data to suggest that early graft flow is superior when the harmonic scalpel is used.<sup>227</sup> On the proximal half of the forearm, gentle lateral retraction of the brachioradialis muscle aids exposure. At the distal end of the dissection the satellite veins are identified and divided. The proximal end of the dissection is marked by the radial recurrent artery branch and a large venous plexus in the medial aspect of the RA. It is our routine to leave the recurrent radial branch intact. The artery is divided proximally and distally and stored in a room temperature solution of lactate, nitroglycerin, and papaverine.

After the RA is removed from the forearm, hemostasis of the operative field is obtained and the arm is closed in multiple layers. A closed suction drain is placed, which we feel helps reduce postoperative seroma formation. A circumferential elastic wrap is applied. The arm is then abducted and secured to the table. Reports of endoscopic RA harvest are beginning to emerge with good functional and cosmetic results; nonetheless the impact of the technique on graft patency is unknown.<sup>228</sup> We have not adopted the technique.

The brachioradialis muscle is retracted laterally. Dissection is begun at the distal end and the satellite veins are divided. The RA is harvested as a pedicle with minimal manipulation.

After the pedicle is free and heparin has been given, the artery is divided proximally and distally and stored in a room temperature solution of lactate, nitroglycerin, and papaverine. Hemostasis of the operative field is obtained and the arm is closed in multiple layers. A closed suction drain is placed. (By permission of Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

Two cutaneous nerves are of importance to note during RA dissection. The lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve lies superficial to the belly of the brachioradialis muscle and runs close to its medial border. Placing the skin incision medial to the edge of the brachioradialis prevents potential injury. Damage to this nerve will produce paresthesias and numbness of the radial aspect of the volar forearm. The superficial branch of the radial nerve lies under the brachioradialis muscle and in the proximal two-thirds of the forearm runs parallel to the RA. Injury to this nerve will result in paresthesias and numbness of the thumb and the dorsum of the hand. The nerve can best be protected by avoiding excessive lateral retraction on the brachioradialis muscle. 223,229 Transient paresthesias, numbness, and thumb weakness are common and are reported by almost a third of patients after RA harvest; fortunately, the symptoms gradually resolve with time so that after 1 year only 10% of patients have residual complaints with only 1% reporting their symptoms as severe. 230-232

The radial can also be harvested endoscopically through a small incision overlying the artery at the wrist, using a smaller size endoscope than the one normally used for endoscopic saphenous vein harvesting. A long shafted harmonic scalpel can also be used with this technique. Proponents of endoscopic RA harvesting have reported this to be a safe and effective technique, with less pain and fewer wound complications than the open surgical technique, <sup>233</sup> and has become the harvesting method of choice of some centers. <sup>234</sup>

#### **PATENCY**

Acar and associates in 1992 reported on 122 radial grafts with a 100% patency rate at 2 weeks and 93% patency at 9 months.<sup>235</sup> The results appear durable with reported patencies at 48 months of 89%. Several factors may affect RA graft patency, however, including both target artery runoff and competitive flow. In the prospective, randomized Radial Artery Patency Study, more severe target coronary artery stenosis was associated with lower rate of occlusion (>90% stenosis = 5.9% vs 70 to 89% stenosis = 11.8%).<sup>236</sup> The graft failure rate is highest if the target vessel is the right coronary artery system, but this may be related more to the coronary artery than the bypass conduit; one study showed equal patency of RA and saphenous vein bypass grafts to the right coronary artery.<sup>237-239</sup>

The proximal RA can be sutured to the ITA as a T- or Y-graft (composite), sutured directly to the ascending aorta, or sutured to the proximal portion or hood of a separate vein graft. In addition, a segment of vein can be interposed between the aorta and proximal RA in an end-to-end fashion. Comparisons have been made between the T- or Y-graft and direct aortic anastomosis methods. Maniar et al found at approximately 30 months follow-up, a significantly greater incidence of postoperative angiography for recurrent angina among patients with direct aortic anastomosis as compared with patients with composite anastomosis (19% vs 11%).<sup>237</sup> There is controversy here, however, as Jung et al found that 1-, 2-, and 5-year patency rates were significantly better with

direct aortic anastomosis as compared with composite anastomosis. <sup>240</sup> Importantly, it appears that the overall patency of RA grafts to ideal targets may be superior to that of saphenous vein bypass grafts at 5 years, 98% versus 86%. <sup>241</sup>

#### Other Arterial Conduits

A variety of arterial conduits have been used in patients in whom no other conduits are available. The gastroepiploic artery (GEA) for the most part is utilized as an alternative conduit or as part of an all-arterial revascularization strategy. Despite the enthusiastic support of a small cohort of surgeons, the widespread use of the GEA as a coronary conduit has not been adopted, perhaps because of the increased operative time and relative difficulty required to harvest the conduit, the potential for perioperative and long-term abdominal complications, and the lack of consensus on the long-term benefit for total arterial revascularization. Anecdotal use of the ulnar, left gastric, splenic, thoracodorsal, lateral femoral circumflex and inferior epigastric arteries as coronary graft conduits has been reported in the literature. The popularity of the RA, however, has in large measure superseded these options.

## Greater Saphenous Vein

The saphenous vein continues to be one of the most commonly used conduits in coronary bypass grafting. Characteristics that have solidified the greater saphenous vein as a coronary artery bypass conduit include its ease of harvest, ready availability, versatility, resistance to spasm, and thoroughly studied long-term results. Unfortunately there is a loss of clinical benefit after CABG because of time-related attrition. Accordingly, there is interest in pharmacologic strategies to maximize early and late venous graft patency.

Prospective randomized trials have shown that early aspirin administration reduces mortality after CABG. Aspirin within 48 hours after CABG also reduces early postoperative complications, including mortality, MI, stroke, renal failure, and bowel infarction. <sup>242</sup> More recently, it has been recognized that lipid-lowering agents reduce the progression of graft atherosclerosis. <sup>243,244</sup> Aggressive use of statins to achieve a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol < 100 mg/dL decrease by one-third the number of grafts affected with atherosclerosis at angiographic follow-up and also decreased the need for repeat revascularization. <sup>243</sup> With clear documentation of improved outcomes with these two pharmacologic strategies, systematic approaches to ensure their universal application are needed. <sup>21</sup>

Finally, in the future, gene therapy may allow modification of the venous vascular endothelium to avert development of intimal hyperplasia. Unfortunately, the PREVENT IV trial, testing whether short-term angiographic vein graft failure could be diminished with treatment of the saphenous vein before grafting with edifoligide (an oligonucleotide decoy that binds to and inhibits E2F transcription factors), demonstrated no impact of the treatment.<sup>245</sup> The concept remains a

valid one, however, and gene therapy will continue to be an exciting area of investigation in the future.

#### HARVEST TECHNIQUE

Saphenous vein harvest can be performed with an open or endoscopic technique. Open-vein harvest can be performed with a completely opened technique or bridged technique. In the completely open technique, an extensile skin incision provides the best exposure of the vein and may allow for harvest with the least amount of surgical trauma, but that advantage comes at the risk of higher rates of wound complications and postoperative pain. Bridged skin incisions may decrease pain and wound complications but may also increase surgical manipulation of the vein conduit.

Open-vein dissection can be started either in the upper thigh, above the knee, or at the ankle (Fig. 20-6). Some

![](_page_23_Picture_13.jpeg)

FIGURE 20-6 Saphenous vein harvest: open and bridged technique. Open technique (top): Dissection can be started in the upper thigh, above the knee, or at the ankle. Identification of the vein is easiest at the ankle, just above the medial malleolus. An incision is made overlying the vein and extended directly over its trajectory. The vein is dissected and all venous tributaries are ligated and divided in situ. Bridged technique (middle): Two- or three-step incisions are performed over the course of the vein. Dissection of the vein is carried in a similar fashion as the opened technique except that branches are divided in situ and ligated once the vein is explanted. Completed dissection (bottom): Once dissection is completed, the vein is ligated and divided proximally and distally. Stumps of side branches on the vein are left long and then are ligated flush with the vein, avoiding narrowing of the conduit. The vein is then gently flushed and stored in a solution of room temperature plasmalyte. The skin incisions are closed and the leg is wrapped with an elastic bandage.

surgeons prefer to harvest vein from the lower leg because of a more appropriate vein caliber and wall thickness, as well as greater distance from the perineum (a potential source of infection). Others prefer to harvest vein from the thigh, arguing improved wound healing, particularly among patients with distal peripheral arterial occlusive disease. We are not aware of any data supporting one location over another. Because of the greater amount of adipose tissue present in the thigh area, wound breakdown in that location may prove more of a nuisance to treat. The fundamentals of vein harvest are to procure the conduit with a minimal amount of trauma to the vein. Specifically, the vein should not be grasped with forceps, stretched, or over-distended, because patency rates may be related to endothelial damage induced during harvest and preparation of the conduit. Identification of the vein is easiest at the ankle, just lateral to the medial malleolus.

In the completely open technique, a skin incision directly over the trajectory of the vein is made, taking care not to create skin flaps. Purposeful, directed, sharp dissection is used to free the vein from the surrounding tissue. Side branches on the vein can initially be left long. Once dissection is completed, the vein is ligated and divided proximally and distally. A blunt-tipped vein cannula is inserted into the distal end of the vein and the vein gently flushed and dilated with a room temperature solution of Plasmalyte<sup>TM</sup>. The side branches can be clipped flush with the vein at this time, taking care to avoid narrowing of the conduit lumen.

When using a bridged technique, several step incisions are performed over the course of the vein. Dissection of the vein is otherwise carried out in a similar fashion as describe above. Exposure of the vein with the bridge technique may be less than optimal. Caution is necessary here to avoid excessive tension or manipulation of the conduit as an adjunct to deal with less than adequate exposure of those segments of the vein covered by a skin bridge. For all techniques of vein harvest located in the lower thigh and more distal, care should be taken to avoid trauma to the saphenous nerve, which is in close proximity to the vein. Injury to the nerve can result in debilitating postoperative neuralgia.

Endoscopic vein harvest starts with a 1.5- to 2.0-cm skin incision in the medial aspect of the extremity above the knee (Fig. 20-7). Carbon dioxide insufflation for visualization and dissection is established. Dissection is directed toward the groin region as far proximally as possible and then distally as far as needed to obtain the required length of conduit. Side branches are divided by using bipolar cauterizing scissors. Once dissection is completed, small skin punctures are made at the limits of the dissection and the vein exteriorized, ligated, and divided. The vein is removed and otherwise prepared in the standard fashion. Following skin closure, the leg is wrapped with a circumferential elastic bandage.

#### **PATENCY**

Minimally invasive harvest of the saphenous vein using an endoscopic technique is gaining popularity because it greatly reduces the wound morbidity associated with the open harvest techniques. Endoscopic harvest decreases wound

![](_page_24_Picture_8.jpeg)

**FIGURE 20-7** Endoscopic saphenous vein harvest. A 2.0-cm skin incision is made in the medial aspect of the knee.  $\rm CO_2$  insufflation is established. Harvesting is directed toward the groin region as far proximally as possible. Side branches are divided by using bipolar cauterizing scissors. Once dissection is completed, a small puncture is made in the groin directly over the vein and the vein is exteriorized under endoscopic guidance. After removing the vein from the leg, side branches are clipped. If any branches have been avulsed, the vein is repaired with interrupted 7-0 polypropylene sutures.

complication rates and produces an improved cosmetic result, although the operative time devoted to harvest is increased as are the number of defects to the harvested conduit requiring suture repair. Initial reports showed no detrimental effects of harvest technique on vein morphology, endothelial structure or function, or graft patency. <sup>246,247</sup> However, in recent report of 3000 patients treated with CABG, endovascular vein harvest was associated with higher rates of vein-graft failure, death, MI, and repeat revascularization. <sup>248</sup>

The polar opposite to endoscopic vein harvest is the "no-touch" technique in which the vein is removed with a pedicle of surrounding tissue. The harvested vein is not distended and it is stored in heparinized blood. In a randomized study of 104 patients using this technique, the angiographic patency at 18 months was 89% for conventional versus 95% for no-touch grafts. At 8.5 years, patency rates were 76% for the conventional group versus 90% for the no-touch group. Multivariate analysis showed that the most important surgical factors for graft patency were the technique of harvesting the conduit and the vein quality. By comparison, the patency of ITA grafts was 90% in the study.<sup>249</sup>

#### Other Venous Conduits

Alternative venous conduits such as the lesser saphenous and/or upper extremity cephalic veins are usually secondary choices for conduit. If it is planned to use either of these veins, preoperative vein mapping can help guide conduit harvest. The lesser saphenous vein can be harvested in a supine position through a lateral approach by flexing the hip and medially rotating the knee or by an inferior approach with straight elevation of the extremity. A skin incision is usually started midway between the Achilles tendon and the lateral malleolus. Dissection is carried proximally up the leg to the

popliteal fossa. Attention should be paid to avoid injuring the sural nerve.

The patency rate for arm veins is significantly lower than that of saphenous veins and for that reason they are considered conduits of last resort.<sup>250</sup> For cephalic vein harvest, the arm is prepared and positioned as during RA harvest. Incisions are placed along the medial and superior aspect of the arm. The cephalic vein is relatively thinwalled in comparison with the greater saphenous vein and is predisposed to aneurysmal dilatation.

#### **CONDUCT OF OPERATION**

Procedures are done under general anesthesia with central venous access, radial arterial lines, and pulmonary artery catheters. Transesophageal echocardiography may be helpful for identifying unsuspected intracardiac lesions or aortic atherosclerosis, and for evaluating ventricular function at the end of the procedure. If ventricular function is poor, a femoral arterial line will facilitate later placement of an IABP. We routinely use a temperature-monitoring urinary catheter. The patient is positioned in the supine position with arms tucked at the side. Care should be taken to avoid peripheral nerve complications caused by pressure injury. The lower extremities are positioned with a slight external rotation and flexion of the knees to aid with groin exposure and harvesting of saphenous vein conduits. The patient is prepared and draped to include the lower neck, the chest, and abdomen between the anterior axillary lines, and the lower extremities circumferentially. The right subclavicular area should also be widely prepped in case the axillary artery needs to be used as a source of arterial inflow.

#### **Incisions**

By far the most common approach for CABG is via median sternotomy. Cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass, managing aortic valve insufficiency, monitoring the left ventricle for distention, and evacuating air all are easier with the midline approach. The skin incision extends from a point midway between the angle of Louis and the sternal notch to just below the tip of the xiphoid process. The scalpel is used to extend the incision through the subcutaneous tissues down to the sternum. Extensive Bovey cautery to the subcutaneous tissues should be avoided because tissue destruction here may result in increased risk of wound complication. Charcoal does not bleed, but neither does it heal.

Special attention should be devoted to identifying the middle of the sternum. The middle of the sternal periosteum is noted and marked with cautery, although we avoid scoring the periosteum continuously from notch to xiphoid as this devascularizes the periosteum unless the saw passes exactly down the line. The interclavicular ligament is divided in the sternal notch, allowing palpation of the posterior aspect of the sternal manubrium. The xiphoid process is identified and divided in the midline with heavy scissors and the midline diaphragmatic muscle attachments divided. A finger should

be inserted under the sternum to document a free space anterior to the pericardium. If there are no significant adhesions present, the sternum is divided with the oscillating saw. If the prepericardial space is adhered, the sternum should be divided using the microsagittal saw. The saphenous vein or the RA can be harvested simultaneous with the sternotomy. Once the sternum has been divided, the ITA is harvested as previously described.

# Cannulation and Establishment of Cardiopulmonary Bypass

The pericardium is divided vertically down to the diaphragm and the inferior attachment of the pericardium to the diaphragm is divided transversely. The remnant of thymic tissue and pericardial fat is divided in the midline to the inferior aspect of the left innominate vein.

If the RITA will be used in situ, the fat overlying the pericardium is removed from the diaphragm inferiorly, to the innominate vein superiorly and from the left phrenic to the right phrenic nerve. This significantly increases the reach of the in situ RITA, especially if it will be used in a retro-aortic fashion for left sided targets. Although only removal of the right sided anterior pericardial fat is necessary to maximize the reach of the RITA, we have found that it is quicker and dryer to remove the entire fat pad as a block.

Pericardial retraction sutures create a pericardial cradle or well to improve exposure of the ascending aorta and right atrium. The left pericardium is divided at the level of the great vessels toward the phrenic nerve to allow the completed ITA bypass graft to fall laterally into the pleural space away from the sternum. The distal ascending aorta is inspected and palpated for soft nonatherosclerotic areas suitable for arterial cannulation, root ventilation, proximal graft anastomoses, and aortic cross-clamp placement (Fig. 20-8). In some institutions, epicardial ultrasound of the ascending aorta is performed. Now is the time to redirect the conduct of the operation should the aorta harbor areas of significant calcification, a topic of later discussion.

Systemic anticoagulation is achieved with the intravenous administration of 300 U/kg of unfractionated heparin and the adequacy of anticoagulation documented by an activated clotting time over 450 seconds. In anticipation of aortic cannulation the systolic blood pressure should be reduced to about 100 mm Hg to minimize the risk of aortic dissection. Two partial-thickness concentric diamond-shaped purse-string sutures using 2-0 braided or monofilament nonabsorbable suture (such as Ethibond<sup>TM</sup> or Prolene<sup>TM</sup>, respectively) are placed in the distal ascending aorta or proximal aortic arch, leaving enough room on the ascending aorta for all necessary proximal aortic work. The size of the purse strings should be large enough to accept the aortic cannula tip, usually 20-22 French. The ends of the sutures are passed through tourniquets that will be used for tightening the purse strings and securing the cannulation site after decannulation. The aortic adventitia within the purse strings

FIGURE 20-8 Cannulation. After full systemic heparinization, cannulation of the distal ascending aorta is performed with an appropriately sized curved or straight tip aortic cannula. A two-stage venous cannula is used for access to the right atrium, usually through the right atrial appendage. An aortic root cardioplegia/vent is placed. A retrograde cardioplegia cannula may be placed at the discretion of the surgeon. Patients with significant aortic regurgitation will benefit from placement of a left ventricle vent (placed via the right superior pulmonary) to avoid distention of the left ventricle during infusion of cardioplegia into the aortic root. (By permission of Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research. All rights reserved.)

is divided in preparation for aortotomy. The adventitia just superior to the planned aortotomy is grasped with a forceps and an aortotomy equal in size to the cannula tip is created with a no. 11 scalpel blade. Bleeding is easily controlled with slight inferior traction of the forceps on the adventitia. The aortic cannula is inserted and properly positioned, and the purse strings are tightened. The tourniquets are secured to the aortic cannula with a heavy silk tie and then the cannula is secured to the skin.

Placement of the aortic cannula can result in acute aortic dissection. Intraluminal positioning of the cannula is confirmed by watching for the cannula to fill with arterial blood. The aortic cannula is de-aired and connected to the arterial end of the pump tubing. An additional method to assess for the presence of aortic dissection is to have the perfusionist check the wave form and pressure of the arterial cannula pulse and to deliver a test infusion of 50 to 100 mL of fluid through the cannula. If an aortic dissection is present, often the test infusion will result in an increase in arterial cannula pressure.

Venous cannulation is accomplished with a two- or three-stage venous cannula inserted in the right atrial appendage. A 2-0 Ethibond or Prolene purse-string suture is placed around the tip of the right atrial appendage. The purse string should be wide enough for easy access of the

selected venous cannula. An atriotomy is made with scissors at the tip of the appendage. Small bridging fibers of muscle are divided with scissors to permit easy entry of the cannula. The venous cannula is cautiously inserted, the tip of which should lie in the inferior vena cava. The purse-string suture is tightened and the tourniquet secured to the venous cannula with a heavy silk tie. The venous line is connected to the pump tubing.

An aortic root cannula is placed in the ascending aorta and retrograde cardioplegia cannula placed in the coronary sinus via the right atrium. The patient is placed on cardiopulmonary bypass at 2.4 L/min/m² and may be perfused at normothermia or may be cooled to 34°C. Once the patient is on full bypass, flow ventilation is stopped. A left ventricle vent may be placed via the right superior pulmonary vein at this time if there is significant aortic regurgitation. Target vessels are easier to identify before cardioplegic arrest while they are fully distended in their native state. The locations of planned distal anastomoses are marked with a scalpel. The pump flow is turned down temporarily and the aortic cross-clamp applied just proximal to the arterial cannula and bypass flow returned to normal.

Cold blood cardioplegia (10 mL/kg) is administered and may be delivered antegrade, retrograde, or both, with special attention given during this time to look for evidence of aortic regurgitation such as a flaccid aorta and/or left ventricle distention. Two available options to treat significant aortic regurgitation include completion of the procedure using only retrograde cardioplegia or placement of a left ventricle vent via the right superior pulmonary vein (our preferred method). Rarely is aortic valve replacement required. Additional doses of cardioplegia (5 mL/kg) are given via the antegrade and retrograde catheters approximately every 20 minutes throughout the remainder of the cross-clamp period. Cardioplegiare dosing should be timed in such a way as not to interrupt the 'flow' of the operation.

#### **Distal Anastomoses**

# LOCATION OF TARGETS AND SEQUENCE OF ANASTOMOSES

Arteriotomy sites should be chosen proximal enough to offer the largest-sized coronary target but distal enough to avoid areas of obstruction or significant atherosclerotic disease. Arteriotomies at bifurcations should be avoided. Diseased vessels with an intramyocardial course can often be localized by noting epicardial indentation, accompanying epicardial veins, or a whitish streak within the myocardium. Sharp dissection of overlying tissue is required to identify the desired target site. Often a very diseased vessel will be less diseased in the intramyocardial segment.

The LAD coronary artery can be particularly difficult to identify when it has an intramyocardial course. It can be relatively easy to inadvertently enter the right ventricular cavity while dissecting in the interventricular fat plane. If such a ventriculotomy is small, it can be closed with fine 6-0 polypropylene sutures, keeping in mind that the right ventricle

is a low-pressure chamber and deep bites of myocardium are not necessary. However, if the right ventricle has been opened for a distance, it is best repaired using interrupted, pledgetted 2-0 Prolene suture (MH needle) in a horizontal mattress fashion, passing the needle under the ITA-LAD anastomosis. If difficulty is encountered in identifying an LAD artery, a fine probe may be passed retrograde via a small transverse arteriotomy into the LAD artery at the apex of the heart. The tip of the probe can be palpated in the proximal portion of the artery and cut down on appropriately. The distal arteriotomy is repaired with interrupted fine suture (7-0 or 8-0 Prolene<sup>TM</sup>). The repair can be done with or without a small vein patch.

The distribution of cardioplegia is usually relatively uniform; however, the sequence of anastomoses may be planned based on ischemic regions if myocardial protection is a particular concern. Grafting the most ischemic area first, using a distal-proximal routine, will permit early antegrade delivery of cardioplegia through the graft to the area of myocardial ischemia. Alternatively, the sequence of anastomoses may be dictated by the quality of the conduit itself, matching the best conduit to the most important territories. It is customary to perform the left ITA-to-LAD artery anastomosis last to avoid tension and potential disruption of the anastomosis.

#### **ARTERIOTOMY**

The choice of the site of arteriotomy is critical. Opening into a plaque may force endarterectomy, whereas injury to the posterior wall with the knife transforms a straightforward anastomosis into a complex repair. Silastic tapes placed proximally and distally around the coronary artery may help to stabilize the vessel, a technique often employed when grafting the distal right coronary artery or when there is significant back bleeding from the opened vessel. The arteriotomy is performed with a fine scalpel blade and extended with fine Pott's scissors proximally and distally. The arteriotomy should match the conduit diameter, and should be at least 1.5 times the luminal diameter of the distal coronary artery (Fig. 20-9).

#### ANASTOMOTIC TECHNIQUE

The goal of the anastomosis is to join the conduit and the target vessel with precise endothelial approximation affording minimal resistance to flow. The wall of the vessel should be handled with care, avoiding endothelial injury to prevent thrombotic complications. Coronary anastomoses are typically constructed with continuous 7-0 polypropylene suture. Sutures should be evenly spaced to prevent leaks at the conclusion of the anastomosis. In order to increase anastomotic area, we prefer to bevel the conduits at approximately 30° and notch them at the heel. Anastomoses are performed with continuous suture. We prefer a continuous, parachuting technique initiated at the heel for virtually all anastomoses regardless of their configuration (ie, end-to-side vs side-to-side sequential anastomosis).

![](_page_27_Picture_9.jpeg)

**FIGURE 20-9** Distal anastomosis: *Arteriotomy*. Arteriotomy sites should be proximal enough to offer the largest-sized coronary target, and just distal enough to avoid the area of obstruction. Intramyocardial vessels can often be localized by noting epicardial indentation, accompanying epicardial veins, or a whitish streak within the myocardium. Sharp dissection of overlying tissue is then required to identify the desired target site. The arteriotomy is then performed with a no. 11 blade. The arteriotomy is extended with fine Pott's scissors proximally and distally. The arteriotomy should match the conduit diameter, and should be at least 1.5 times the diameter of the distal coronary.

Venous conduit is brought onto the field with a mosquito clamp on the adventitia at the toe of the conduit. An end-to-side anastomosis is accomplished with continuous sutures (Fig. 20-10). Starting at the 3 o'clock position on the right side of the vessel, the suture is passed outside-in on the conduit and then inside-out at the corresponding

location of the target coronary vessel. Two more sutures are taken before the heel (2 and 1 o'clock positions), one directly in the heel (12 o'clock), and then two more on the left side (11 and 10 o'clock positions) of the anastomosis before parachuting the conduit down to the target vessel.

![](_page_28_Figure_4.jpeg)

**FIGURE 20-10** Distal anastomosis suture technique. (A) The conduit is beveled at 30 degrees and notched at the heel. We use a continuous, parachuting technique with 7-0 or 8-0 polypropylene suture. The conduit is brought onto the field with a mosquito clamp on the adventitia at the toe of the conduit. An end-to-side anastomosis is accomplished with 12 sutures. Starting at 3 o'clock on the right side of the vessel, the suture is passed outside-in on the conduit and then inside-out at the corresponding location of the target vessel. (B) Two more stitches are taken before the heel, one directly in the heel, and then two more on the left side of the anastomosis before parachuting the conduit down to the target vessel. (C) The anastomosis is then completed by placing another six stitches evenly spaced in the same manner for the toe. (By permission of Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research. All rights reserved.)

The anastomosis is continued by placing additional sutures moving in a counterclockwise fashion around the anastomosis until the other thread is encountered. The technique encourages one to move out of the heel and toe areas of the anastomosis, minimizing the risk of narrowing the outflow. Care must be taken to prevent suturing the back wall of the coronary, and the proper amount of tension on the follow-through must be provided to avoid both leakage and a purse-string effect. Just before completion of the anastomosis, a 1-mm probe is passed proximally and distally to ensure patency. To prevent anastomotic tension and torsion, pedicled conduits (ie, left ITA) can be suture-fixated to the adjacent epicardium.

Sequential grafting permits efficient use of conduit and has the potential for increased flow in the conduit. When planning sequential anastomoses, the most distal anastomosis should be to the largest target vessel with the greatest outflow potential. If the reverse situation is created, the most distal anastomosis is at increased risk for failure, given the likelihood of preferential flow to the larger more proximal anastomosis. <sup>251,252</sup> A clear disadvantage of sequential grafting is the reliance of two or more distal targets on a single conduit and proximal anastomosis, placing a potentially larger region of the myocardium at jeopardy. <sup>252</sup>

Some surgeons avoid using the ITA for sequential grafting or as a donor for composite T or Y-grafting of other conduits because of concerns of compromising critical ITA-to-LAD flow. However, several series have demonstrated successful use of the ITA for sequential grafting of stenotic diagonal coronary arteries with excellent results. The left ITA has also been used for multiple sequential anastomoses to the circumflex territory with grafting of the right ITA to the LAD artery. Sequential grafting has also been performed with the right GEA as well as the RA. Sequential grafting of the right GEA as well as the RA.

When constructing a sequential anastomosis, it is our preference to complete the distal anastomosis first and move proximally (Fig. 20-11). We feel that this facilitates determination of optimal inter graft spacing. In the case of the LAD-diagonal graft, however, it is easier to move from proximal to distal, performing the diagonal anastomosis first. Sequential side-to-side anastomoses may be perpendicular or longitudinal. When constructing perpendicular anastomoses care must be taken not to make the arteriotomies too long, as there is risk of creating a "gull-wing" deformity and placing the graft at jeopardy. Arteriotomies in both the conduit and target are made in the direction of the long axis of the vessel. The two incisions are then aligned perpendicular to one another and the anastomosis completed, creating a diamond-shaped anastomosis. The arteriotomy for longitudinal anastomosis may be made as long as necessary without risk of distorting the conduit. Typically, the longitudinal anastomosis is begun at the heel as previously described.

## Coronary Endarterectomy

Coronary endarterectomy predated CABG as a direct surgical approach to relieving coronary occlusive disease. Coronary

endarterectomy has been relegated to a position of secondary importance, however, thanks to the reliable and reproducible results obtained with CABG. Recently there has been increased interest in endarterectomy techniques, because the patient population coming to CABG has a greater atherosclerotic burden owing to diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and advanced age.<sup>258</sup> Most commonly, the need for endarterectomy arises intraoperatively when no soft site can be identified for arteriotomy or a vessel has been inadvertently opened in an extensively diseased area not amenable to grafting. Occasionally, endarterectomy is undertaken electively in patients with diffuse and extensive coronary disease with no other choices except transplantation.

The perioperative risk of CABG with endarterectomy is higher than that for CABG alone in most studies. In a retrospective study of 1478 patients, the reported mortality rate with endarterectomy was 3.2%, which was higher than for CABG alone (2.2%). Perioperative MI rate was also higher in the endarterectomy group, 4.2% versus 3.4%. The risk of mortality appears to increase when multiple vessels require endarterectomy: single-vessel endarterectomy mortality = 1.8% versus multiple-vessel endarterectomy mortality = 5.5%. There has been controversy regarding the risk of endarterectomy of the LAD, with some studies showing increased risk whereas others demonstrate no increased risk. 259-261

The late results of endarterectomy are inferior to those of routine CABG, with reported 3-year patency for ITA grafts to endarterectomized LAD targets ranging from 74 to 80%. <sup>262,263</sup> Despite this, angina relief is remarkably good initially. Unfortunately, the rate of recurrent angina is somewhat higher than after uncomplicated CABG; reported recurrence of angina is 25% at 5 years after endarterectomy. <sup>260,264</sup> The reported 5-year survival following coronary endarterectomy ranges from 76 to 83%. <sup>260,264</sup> Among patients in whom bypass to more distal nondiseased segments is not possible, coronary endarterectomy with subsequent bypass offers a viable alternative to leaving a territory ungrafted.

#### **TECHNIQUE**

The technique of endarterectomy requires that the central core be extracted adequately in order to relieve obstruction of the branch vessels. Patency of a graft to the endarterectomized vessel depends upon the adequacy of runoff and therefore the distal endpoints of the endarterectomy core must be smoothly tapered. If the core fractures leaving behind disease in side branches, distal counter-incisions may be needed to obtain a satisfactory result.

The RCA is the vessel most often endarterectomized, usually at the level of its bifurcation. A manual eversion endarterectomy is performed after entering at the vessel approximately 1 cm proximal to the crux. A circumferential plane of dissection between the core and the adventitia is developed with a fine coronary spatula. The core is transected proximally and gently grasped with DeBakey forceps while the spatula is used to tease the adventitia away from the core. The core is regrasped hand over hand as distally

FIGURE 20-11 Sequential anastomosis. (A) Order of anastomoses: The order in which sequential anastomoses are performed is important to facilitate optimal inter graft spacing and avoid kinking. The distal anastomosis is completed first and the more proximal sequential anastomosis is performed second, except for an LAD-diagonal graft, in which the diagonal is performed first followed by the LAD. (B) Perpendicular sequential side-to-side anastomosis: Arteriotomies are made in the direction of the long axis of the coronary and the conduit. Care must be taken not to make the arteriotomies too long, because there is risk of creating a "gull-wing" deformity. The two incisions are aligned perpendicular to one another. The suture is passed starting inside-out at the apex of the target coronary and then outside-in at the mid-portion the conduit. An eight-stitch anastomosis is completed creating a diamond-shaped anastomosis. (C) Longitudinal sequential side-to-side anastomosis: The arteriotomy for longitudinal anastomosis may be made as long as necessary without risk of distorting the conduit. The anastomosis is begun at the heel and the far wall is completed open. It is then parachuted down and the front wall completed. (By permission of Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

as possible to avoid fracture. When the crux is reached, the posterior descending artery and the left ventricular branch are endarterectomized separately. If endarterectomy of the proximal segment of the RCA is needed, we prefer to use an open technique because it is difficult to obtain nice tapering of the core at the takeoff of the acute marginal branches with a retrograde eversion endarterectomy. The vessel wall is then reconstructed with a long hood created with the bypass conduit of choice.

We prefer open extended technique when the LAD is endarterectomized (Fig. 20-12). The vessel is opened as far

proximal as possible if endarterectomy is anticipated. If the vessel has been opened in its mid-portion before it is apparent that endarterectomy is necessary, we extend the incision in the adventitia proximally before developing the endarterectomy plane. Retrograde eversion endarterectomy is dangerous because branch vessels will not be opened. Once the core is separated from the adventitia, it is transected proximally at the heel and the vessel is opened beyond the takeoff of the major diagonals to permit individual eversion endarterectomy of each of the branches. The segment is reconstructed with a long hood of the conduit of choice or a vein patch into

**FIGURE 20-12** Coronary endarterectomy: Open extended technique. (A) The extent of disease is evaluated to plan the length of the arteriotomy and endarterectomy. The arteriotomy is performed and extended as proximal as needed before the circumferential plane of dissection between the core and the adventitia is developed with a fine coronary spatula. Once the core is separated from the adventitia, it is transected proximally at the heel and the vessel is opened beyond the takeoff of the major branches to permit individual eversion endarterectomy of each of the branches.

which the ITA is anastomosed. The circumflex artery is the most infrequently endarterectomized vessel. Its rapid branching pattern makes satisfactory endarterectomy difficult. We tend to begin with an eversion technique, focusing our efforts on opening the largest distal branches as much as possible.

#### **Proximal Anastomoses**

Proximal anastomoses of the saphenous vein or the RA to the aorta are performed after the distal anastomoses under the same cross-clamp clamp. Our preferred technique is to complete each respective bypass graft in a distal anastomosis-proximal anastomosis fashion. Completion of the each respective bypass graft allows antegradecardioplegia down the completed graft, aiding in myocardial protection. The single cross-clamp technique results in longer cross-clamp times than with the partial occlusion clamp method. However, the partial occlusion clamp technique requires additional aortic manipulation and although some authors have found this practice to be safe, <sup>265</sup> others have demonstrated that it carries a higher risk of neuropsychological deficits when compared with the single-clamp technique. <sup>266</sup>

#### ANASTOMOTIC TECHNIQUE

Once an appropriate site for aortotomy is identified, the fatty tissue overlying the aorta is removed (Fig. 20-13). An arteriotomy is created with a no. 11 blade, and a 4.0-mm punch used to create a circular aortotomy. The size of the punch may vary depending on the size of the conduit graft. The graft is measured to length with the aorta, right heart, and pulmonary artery full of blood. The graft is cut and the proximal aspect of the conduit beveled and notched at the heel. A running 5-0 polypropylene suture is used for a venous graft and a 6-0 polypropylene suture for an arterial conduit. The long axis of the graft is aligned at an appropriate angle to the ascending aorta. The anastomosis can be completed with continuous stitches. Symmetry in the spacing of sutures is paramount to obtain a hemostatic anastomosis. Free arterial grafts may also be sutured to the hood of a vein graft with continuous 7-0 Prolene suture.

#### **COMPOSITE GRAFTS**

As an alternative to proximal anastomosis to the aorta, a free graft can be anastomosed proximally to the pedicled ITA (Fig. 20-14). This technique has the theoretical advantage of providing a more physiologic arterial pressure waveform by attaching the conduit to a third-order vessel rather than to the aorta. Composite grafting is also a useful tool for the hostile, calcified ascending aorta or when there is a limited length of conduit available. It is also advantageous when there is a marked mismatch between aortic wall thickness and arterial conduit size.

A combination of composite and sequential grafting allows the opportunity to perform complete arterial revascularization with only ITA or with ITA and other arterial

The anastomosis can be completed with eight stitches in most cases; symmetry in the spacing between stitches is of paramount importance to ensure hemostasis.

**FIGURE 20-14** Composite Y-graft. Y-graft anastomotic technique: A coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) is used as a donor site for the proximal anastomosis of another conduit. An incision is created in the donor conduit. The proximal end of the recipient conduit is then anastomosed to the donor site in an end-to-side fashion as previously described for a distal anastomosis. The recipient conduit is then gently parachuted down onto the donor conduit. (By permission of Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research. All rights reserved.)

conduits (Fig. 20-15). Multiple configurations of Y- and T-grafts can be devised to best suit the anatomic characteristics of each patient. Some authors have advocated even using the distal segment of the LITA as a composite graft off the composite RITA to further expand the reach of a complete arterial revascularization strategy. The LITA has been shown to have more than sufficient flow reserve to supply flow to the entire coronary circulation. The free right ITA, the RA, or other arterial conduit can be based in this manner.

All-arterial Y-grafts are usually planned in advance and constructed before the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass. Special care must be taken during construction of composite grafts to avoid tension, rotational torsion, or narrowing of the inflow anastomosis. Disadvantages include technical difficulty and reliance upon a single inflow source for two or more distal targets.

# Management of the Atherosclerotic Ascending Aorta

Ascending aortic atherosclerosis has been consistently identified as a very important risk factor for stroke in multiple series. Routine epiaortic ultrasound should be performed to define the extent of atherosclerosis of the ascending aorta and its likelihood of embolization. Patients with severe atherosclerosis of the ascending aorta may require alternative strategies to prevent embolization of aortic atheroma. If the ascending aorta is hostile, we favor cannulation of the right axillary artery. Although most surgeons prefer to achieve axillary arterial inflow utilizing a chimney side graft, direct cannulation of the axillary artery with an appropriately designed axillary angled cannula is very safe and effective. <sup>269</sup> If necessary, aortic clamping may be performed in areas free of atheroma, usually in the more proximal ascending aorta.

![](_page_34_Picture_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 20-15** Total arterial revascularization: As shown, arterial revascularization can be performed using the right internal thoracic artery (RITA) off the left internal thoracic artery (LITA) as a Y-graft and liberal use of sequential grafting. (By permission of Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research. All rights reserved.)

Coronary revascularization can be achieved with a variety of methods. Using a "no-touch" technique, revascularization can be done using only pedicled arterial conduits, and if proximal anastomoses are required they can be based off pedicled conduits or brachiocephalic vessels. Distal anastomoses can be performed with an "on pump, beating heart" technique without aortic cross-clamping but with vessel occlusion and stabilization techniques used in off pump surgery. This does not require cooling or LV venting, two necessary features of the similar but now obsolete cold fibrillatory arrest technique. Proximal anastomoses can be performed under deep hypothermic circulatory arrest or after graft replacement of the ascending aorta if there are large mobile atheromas.<sup>270</sup>

## Weaning from Cardiopulmonary Bypass

On completion of all anastomoses, the aortic cross-clamp is removed and a stable heart rhythm established. Some advocate allowing the heart to recover on full bypass for 10 minutes for each 60 minutes of aortic cross-clamp time.

During this time of recovery the patient is prepared for transition from supported circulation to native circulation. The aortic root vent and retrograde catheters are removed and the sites repaired with suture. The bypass grafts are checked for kinks, twists, or tension and for presence of hemostasis. The patient must be rewarmed to normothermia if cooled and the acid-base status and electrolyte abnormalities corrected. We place temporary atrial and ventricular pacing wires on all patients.

Weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass is otherwise the same as for other cardiac surgical cases. Issues particular to CABG include attention to avoid tension on the LITA from lung overinflation or overdistention of the heart, which may place all grafts on tension and disrupt anastomoses. If air has entered the heart, bubbles may pass into the aorta and down the bypass grafts causing arrhythmias and regional wall motion abnormalities. Treatment involves continued recovery on bypass and increasing the perfusion pressure as a means to drive the bubbles through the coronary circulation. Persistency of regional wall motion abnormalities may require bypass graft revision or placement of additional bypass grafts.

#### **OUTCOMES**

### **Operative Mortality**

The risk profile of patients requiring isolated CABG in the United States changed significantly in the 1990s. Compared to previous decades, patients undergoing CABG are older, with a greater number of comorbidities, decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and a higher burden of atherosclerotic disease; however, early outcomes after CABG continue to improve. The STS database demonstrates that despite an increase in expected mortality from 2.6 to 3.4% (relative increase 30%) in the decade of the 1990s, the observed mortality actually decreased from 3.9 to 3.0% (relative decrease 23%).<sup>3</sup>

Similar observations have been made using the Veterans Affairs mandatory national database, where the unadjusted mortality rate for isolated CABG fell from 4.3% in 1989 to 2.7% in the year 2000.<sup>271</sup> In the private sector similar trends have been observed. In an analysis of outcomes of patients undergoing isolated CABG in the HCA system, a nationwide for-profit health care system involving 200 hospitals in 23 states, Mack and associates reported an ongoing decrease in unadjusted operative mortality among 51,353 patients, 80% of whom received CABG with cardiopulmonary bypass. In this study the operative mortality decreased from 2.9% in 1999 to 2.2% in 2002.<sup>272</sup>

This trend has continued throughout the first decade of the new millenium, with the observed mortality having declined to 1.9% in 2009 on the 1,297,254 patients who underwent isolated CABG during that time interval. <sup>175</sup> This represented a 24.4% reduction in operative mortality between 2000 and 2009. <sup>175</sup>

#### Causes of Death

In a multicenter prospective study performed by the Northern New England Cardiovascular Disease Study Group, 384 deaths among 8641 consecutive patients undergoing isolated CABG between 1990 and 1995 were analyzed with respect to the mode of death. The mode of death was defined as the seminal event that precipitated clinical deterioration and ultimately resulted in the patient's demise. Heart failure was judged to be the primary mode of death for 65% of the patients, followed in frequency by neurologic causes (7.3%), hemorrhage (7%), respiratory failure (5.5%), and dysrhythmia (5.5%). The greatest variability in mortality rates observed across surgeons in the study was attributable to differences in rates of heart failure.<sup>273</sup> Cardiac causes were also identified by Sergeant and colleagues as the most common causes of death in a series 5880 patients undergoing CABG between 1983 and 1988.274

## **Operative Morbidity**

#### MYOCARDIAL DYSFUNCTION

Postoperative myocardial dysfunction and cardiac failure after CABG may be related to preoperative ischemic injury, inadequate myocardial protection, incomplete revascularization, or postoperative graft failure. The spectrum of myocardial injury varies from subtle degrees of global myocardial ischemia to transmural infarction. The incidence of myocardial injury identified varies with the sensitivity of the method used for detection as well as the threshold set. Some studies have reported perioperative MI rates as high as 10% of patients with associated worse clinical outcomes (death, MI, or revascularization).<sup>275</sup>

Some elevations of cardiac-specific enzymes are ubiquitous after CABG; however, most would agree that elevations in creatinine kinase-myocardial bound (CK-MB) greater than five times the upper limit of normal (ULN) value are considered significant. In a prospective study of 2918 patients undergoing CABG, 38% of patients had a CK-MB > 5 ULN and 17% had a CK-MB > 10 ULN with an incidence of new Q-wave MI of 4.7%.<sup>276</sup> Troponin may be a more sensitive marker than CK-MB, but its role in large populations of CABG patients is still to be defined.<sup>277</sup> Prominent elevations of CK-MB and troponin have been associated with global ischemia, MI, low cardiac output, and increased operative mortality, as well as increased midterm and long-term mortality.<sup>276,277</sup>

Transient myocardial dysfunction necessitating low-dose inotropic support for a short period of time is also common after CABG. Significant postoperative myocardial dysfunction manifest clinically as low cardiac output syndrome may be defined by the need for postoperative inotropic support or IABP support to maintain a systolic blood pressure > 90 mm Hg or a cardiac index > 2.2 L/min. The reported incidence of low output syndrome varies depending on the defining criteria and has a reported incidence of 4 to 9%. <sup>278,279</sup> Low output syndrome has been shown

to be a marker for increased operative mortality by 10- to 15-fold.  $^{280}$  Independent predictors of low output syndrome in order of importance include LVEF < 20%, reoperation, emergency operation, female gender, diabetes, age older than 70 years, left main disease, recent MI, and triple-vessel disease.  $^{278}$ 

#### ADVERSE NEUROLOGIC OUTCOME

Neurologic deficits after coronary surgery are divided into two types: type 1 deficits include major neurologic deficits, stupor, and coma; type 2 deficits are characterized by deterioration of intellectual function and memory. The incidence of type 1 deficits was reported to be 1.6% in a large review by the Northern New England Cardiovascular Disease Study Group with 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates significantly reduced in affected patients. 160 Perioperative mortality is similarly increased among those with type 1 injury at over 24%. 281 Type 2 deficits are more difficult to characterize and may be more related to the underlying atherosclerosis than to the bypass operation per se. In one nonrandomized study, there was no evidence that the cognitive test performance of CABG patients differed from that of heart healthy control groups with CAD over a 1-year period. 282

Just like mortality rates, stroke rates have shown a decrease in incidence over the last decade (1.6% in 2000 vs 1.2 in 2009, a 26.4% decrease). The More extensive preoperative imaging of the aorta and its arch vessels via CT scan or ultrasound, as well as liberal usage of axillary cannulation over the last decade may be contributing to this improvement, although there is no published evidence to support this relationship.

Predictors of neurologic deficits included advanced age (≥70 years of age), and history or presence of severe hypertension. Independent predictors of type 1 deficits included proximal aortic atherosclerosis, history of prior neurologic disease, need for IABP, diabetes, unstable angina, and perioperative hypotension. Predictors of type 2 deficits included history of alcohol consumption, dysrhythmias, prior CABG, peripheral vascular disease, CHF, and perioperative hypotension. Similar predictors of adverse neurologic outcomes have been observed in other studies.<sup>283</sup>

#### **DEEP STERNAL WOUND INFECTION**

Deep sternal wound infection occurs in 1 to 4% of CABG patients and has historically carried a mortality rate of 25%.<sup>284</sup> These outcomes have dramatically improved over the past 20 years, with the latest meta-analysis reporting a 1.66% risk of mediastinitis when only one ITA is used and 2.64% when both ITAs are used.<sup>285</sup> When skeletonization of the ITAs is performed, these numbers drop to 1.16 and 1.48%.<sup>285</sup> Proven methods to reduce postoperative wound complications include the use of preoperative showers with chlorhexidine gluconate on the evening and morning before the procedure, prophylactic intranasal application of mupirocin given on the evening and the morning before the procedure and twice daily for 5 days postoperatively, hair clipping the morning of surgery, tight glycemic control,

and administration of intravenous prophylactic antibiotics before skin incision. <sup>286-288</sup> Application of a cyanoacrylate-based microbial skin sealant may further reduce surgical site infection. <sup>289</sup>

Obesity and diabetes are strong independent predictors of mediastinitis. Insulin-dependent diabetic patients are especially susceptible to deep sternal wound infection. <sup>290-292</sup> Recent data suggest that tight glycemic control in the postoperative period decreases the risk of mediastinitis in the diabetic population. <sup>293,294</sup> Other preoperative variables independently associated with an increased incidence of deep sternal wound infection include reoperation, longer operative times, reexploration for bleeding, and blood transfusions. <sup>290,291,295</sup>

The use of bilateral ITAs had been implicated as a risk factor for sternal would complications, especially in diabetics. <sup>296</sup> However, this risk appears to be mitigated in part by using a skeletonized ITA harvesting technique. <sup>297</sup> Bilateral ITA harvest should likely be avoided in obese diabetic women, in cases of repeat sternotomy, and in patients with severe COPD, because they exhibit a higher risk of deep sternal wound infection even with skeletonization of the ITA. <sup>204,298</sup>

#### **ACUTE RENAL FAILURE**

Acute renal failure ensuing after CABG with cardiopulmonary bypass is an ominous event. In a prospective observational study conducted at 24 university centers in the United States, including data on 2222 CABG patients, 299 renal dysfunction not requiring dialysis occurred in 6.3%, and renal dysfunction requiring hemodialysis developed in 1.4%. Mortality was directly related to postoperative renal function. Patients with no renal dysfunction had 0.9% mortality. 299 Postoperative renal dysfunction increased mortality to 19% if no dialysis was needed and increased mortality to 63% if hemodialysis was required. Patients with large creatinine increases (>50%) after CABG surgery also have higher 90-day mortality. 300

Independent predictors of postoperative renal dysfunction included increasing age, CHF, reoperation, DM, chronic renal insufficiency, prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time, and low cardiac output.<sup>299</sup> These findings were confirmed in another series of 42,733 patients with similar incidence and mortality associated with postoperative renal dysfunction.<sup>301</sup> One in four patients with preoperative chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine > 1.6 mg/dL) will require renal replacement therapy post-CABG, and patients at highest risk are older than 70 years and have a baseline creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL.<sup>302</sup>

Continuous infusion of low-dose recombinant human B-type natriuretic peptide (nesiritide) from the start of cardiopulmonary bypass has been evaluated as a method to effectively maintain postoperative renal function. In the prospective, randomized, NAPA Trial, 272 patients with EF < 40% undergoing CABG who receive nesiritide experienced a significantly attenuated peak increase in serum creatinine and a greater urine output during the initial 24 hours after surgery. In addition, they had a shorter hospital stay and lower

180-day mortality.<sup>303</sup> Similar renal protective results were noted in a randomized trial using human atrial natriuretic peptide in 251 patients. The treated group had fewer post-operative complications, lower serum creatinine, and higher urinary creatinine and creatinine clearance. The maximum postoperative creatinine level and percent increase of creatinine were also significantly lower in the treatment group. No patient in the natriuretic group required hemodialysis.<sup>304</sup> We are awaiting further study before adopting natriuretic peptides in our routine CABG practice.

## Long-term Outcomes

Long-term outcomes of surgical myocardial revascularization depend on the complex interaction of patient-related and procedure-related factors. Important patient-related factors include anatomic distribution of the CAD, the extent and severity of coronary atherosclerosis, the physiologic impact of ischemia on ventricular function at the time of the original operation, age, gender, overall health status, severity of atherosclerotic burden throughout the body, the presence and severity of associated comorbidities, development of operative complications such as stroke, and need for permanent hemodialysis. The progression rate of native coronary atherosclerosis after surgery and the development of coronary bypass graft failure are of extreme importance in the development of post-CABG angina recurrence, MI, need for reintervention, and cardiac-related mortality. Procedure-related factors that influence long-term outcomes include completeness of revascularization, myocardial protection, and selection of bypass conduits.

Sergeant and colleagues at the Gasthuiberg University Hospital of the Katholieke Universiteit (KU) Leuven, Belgium have provided several reports detailing clinical outcomes after myocardial revascularization. From 1971 to 1993, 9600 consecutive CABG patients were prospectively followed with special attention to clinical outcomes after surgical myocardial revascularization; the investigators achieved a 99.9% complete follow-up in this cohort. Clinical outcomes prospectively followed included mortality, return of angina, MI, and coronary reintervention. Jobs

Defining the return of angina as the first occurrence of angina of any intensity or duration unless it was associated on the same day with MI or death, and recording the severity of this event, was also recorded. The overall non-risk-adjusted freedom from return of angina was 95% at 1 year, 82% at 5 years, 61% at 10 years, 38% at 15 years, and 21% at 20 years. The data suggest that if followed long enough after CABG, the return of angina is almost inevitable; by 12 years one-half of operated patients had return of angina. The initial episode of recurrent angina was rated as mild in 59% of patients.<sup>306</sup> In the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation (BARI) trial of 914 patients with symptomatic multivessel disease randomly assigned to receive CABG, freedom from angina was 84% at 5 and 10 years.<sup>84</sup>

The overall non-risk-adjusted freedom from MI after CABG at the KU Leuven was 97% at 30 days, 94% at 5 years,

86% at 10 years, 73% at 15 years, and 56% at 20 years. The overall non-risk-adjusted freedom from a coronary reintervention, either PCI or reoperative CABG, was 99.7% at 30 days, 97% at 5 years, 89% at 10 years, 72% at 15 years, and 48% at 20 years (125). In the BARI trial, freedom from subsequent coronary reintervention at 10 years was 80%. 84

Overall risk-unadjusted survival after CABG in the KU Leuven experience was 98% at 30 days, 92% at 5 years, 81% at 10 years, 66% at 15 years, and 51% at 20 years. Mortality after CABG was characterized by an initial period of high risk in the first month after surgery, then risk declined to its lowest at 1 year after the operation, and thereafter the mortality risk rose slowly and steadily for as long as the patient was followed. This slow and steady rise in the risk of death over time paralleled that of the general population when matched for sex, age, and ethnicity.<sup>307</sup> In the BARI trial, survival was 89% at 5 years and 74% at 10 years.<sup>84</sup>

The occurrence of ischemic clinical events after CABG negatively influences survival. In the KU Leuven study, overall survival was lessened by return of angina, with an observed survival of 83% at 5 years and 54% at 15 years; the more intense the severity of angina at its return, the greater its influence on survival. The occurrence of MI after CABG has a greater negative effect on survival. Observed long-term survival after post-CABG infarction at the KU Leuven was 80% at 30 days, 65% at 5 years, 52% at 10 years, and 41% at 15 years.

# PROGRESSION OF DISEASE IN NATIVE CORONARY ARTERIES

Progression of atherosclerosis in the native coronary arteries continues after CABG. Bourassa and associates studied the progression of atherosclerosis in the native circulation 10 years after surgery and found that progression of CAD occurs in approximately 50% of nongrafted arteries. The rate of progression of disease in nongrafted arteries was no different from that of grafted arteries with patent grafts; however, progression was more frequent in grafted arteries with occluded grafts. Progression of preexisting stenoses in native coronaries was more frequent than appearance of new stenoses, and it was related to the severity of the preexisting stenosis only in nongrafted arteries.

Progression of native CAD was associated with deterioration in left ventricular function. Native coronary atherosclerosis progressed at a similar rate to that of equally diseased arteries in nonoperated patients.<sup>309</sup> Low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and elevated levels of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol correlated with native disease progression and development of new atherosclerotic lesions.<sup>310,311</sup> Diabetes has been related to accelerated atherosclerosis.

#### **VEIN GRAFT FAILURE**

Although the use of the saphenous vein helped popularize coronary bypass grafting, the propensity of the SVG to fail over time has been the limiting factor of the procedure. It has been reported that approximately 15% of vein grafts

occlude in the first year after CABG, and by 6 and 10 years after surgery patency rates fall to approximately 75 and 60%, respectively. 197 Three entities are responsible for SVG failure: thrombosis, intimal hyperplasia, and graft atherosclerosis.

Thrombosis accounts for graft failure within the first month after CABG, and graft occlusion is found on angiography in 3 to 12% of all venous grafts. Even when performed under optimal conditions, the harvesting of venous conduits is associated with focal endothelial disruption. In particular, the high pressure distension used to overcome venospasm during harvesting causes prominent endothelial cell loss, medial damage, activation of local factors (ie, fibrinogen) influencing hemostasis. Additionally, the inherent antithrombotic properties of veins are comparatively weak. The propensity for early graft occlusion resulting from these prothrombotic effects may, on occasion, be amplified by technical factors that reduce graft flow, including intact venous valves, anastomotic stricture, or graft implantation proximal to an atheromatous segment.<sup>197</sup>

Intimal hyperplasia, defined as the accumulation of smooth muscle cells and extracellular matrix in the intimal compartment, is the major disease process in venous grafts between 1 month and 1 year after implantation. Nearly all veins implanted into the arterial circulation develop intimal thickening within 4 to 6 weeks, which may reduce the lumen by up to 25%. Intimal hyperplasia rarely produces significant stenosis per se; more importantly, however, is that it may provide the foundation for later development of graft atheroma.<sup>312</sup>

Progression of atherosclerosis in aortocoronary SVGs is frequent and represents the predominant cause of late graft failure after CABG. Vein graft atherosclerosis may begin as early as the first year, but is fully developed only after about 5 years. Ten years after surgery, 50 to 60% of SVGs will be occluded and one-half of still patent grafts will show angiographic evidence of atherosclerosis; two-thirds of these lesions will have a luminal diameter reduction of 50% or greater. Vein graft atherosclerosis is the leading cause for reintervention following CABG, more so than progression of disease in native coronary arteries. <sup>197</sup>

Although the risk factors predisposing to vein graft atherosclerosis are broadly similar to those recognized for native coronary disease, the pathogenic effects of these risk factors are amplified by inherent deficiencies of the vein as a conduit when transposed into the coronary arterial circulation. A multifaceted strategy aimed at prevention of vein graft disease is emerging, elements of which include continued improvements in surgical technique; more effective antiplatelet drugs; increasingly intensive risk factor modification, in particular early and aggressive lipid-lowering drug therapy; and a number of evolving therapies, such as gene transfer and nitric oxide donor administration, which target vein graft disease at an early and fundamental level. At present, a key measure is to circumvent the problem of vein graft disease by preferential selection of arterial conduits, in particular the internal mammary arteries, for coronary bypass surgery whenever possible. 197

## **Extended Use of Arterial Grafting**

#### BILATERAL INTERNAL THORACIC ARTERY GRAFT

In contrast to the easily demonstrated survival benefit conferred by an ITA graft to the LAD artery, it was more difficult to demonstrate a survival benefit to a second arterial graft. Buxton and colleagues studied 1243 patients undergoing primary CABG with bilateral ITA grafts compared with 1583 patients with single ITA grafts. This group demonstrated a 15% absolute improvement in actuarial survival rates 10 years after CABG with the use of bilateral ITA grafts, as compared with the use of a single ITA graft (10-year survival for bilateral ITA was  $86 \pm 3\%$  vs  $71 \pm 5\%$  for a single ITA).<sup>312</sup> Lytle and colleagues similarly demonstrated an improvement in survival at 12 years (79 vs 71%) as well as superior reoperation-free survival (77 vs 62%) among 2001 bilateral and 8123 single ITA graft patients.<sup>313</sup> The impact of selection bias in these studies is difficult to control, however, and although some surgeons have embraced bilateral ITA grafting, it still represents a small minority of cases reported to the STS database (3.8%).

#### COMPLETE ARTERIAL REVASCULARIZATION

The better long-term results achieved with the use of bilateral ITAs and the well-known time-related attrition in patency of venous conduits encouraged the exclusive use of arterial conduits for myocardial revascularization. Complete arterial revascularization can be achieved by a variety of strategies, including composite grafting using exclusively ITAs or secondary arterial conduits such as the RA and the GEA. The use of sequential anastomotic techniques maximizes the utilization of arterial conduits. Although technically demanding, sequential grafting can be performed safely and with excellent long-term results with reported 96% patency rates of 7.5 years of follow-up on 1150 sequential ITA anastomoses.<sup>314</sup>

Tector has championed complete arterial revascularization using bilateral ITAs in a T configuration with end-to-side anastomosis of one ITA as a free graft to the side of the second ITA, which is left as a pedicled graft, combined with liberal use of sequential anastomoses. In his series of 897 patients overall survival was 75%, and freedom from reintervention was 92%, 8 years after revascularization.<sup>315</sup> Barner has reported similar encouraging results with composite grafting using one ITA and one RA.316 Data from randomized studies are beginning to emerge supporting improvement in early outcomes with complete arterial revascularization compared with conventional CABG. Muneretto and associates randomized 200 patients to complete arterial revascularization (left ITA to the LAD artery and composite grafts with the right ITA, RA, or both) versus conventional CABG (left ITA to the LAD artery and SVGs). In midterm follow-up (20 months) superior event-free survival (freedom from nonfatal MI, angina recurrence, graft occlusion, need for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, and late death) was demonstrable in the complete arterial revascularization patients compared to conventional CABG.<sup>317</sup>

The same group conducted a second randomized trial comparing complete arterial revascularization to conventional CABG (ITA to LAD artery and SVG) in 160 patients older than 70 years of age undergoing first time nonemergent CABG. Early mortality was similar, but at 16 ± 3 months, there were significantly fewer graft occlusions and recurrences of angina among the complete arterial revascularization group. Independent predictors of graft occlusion and angina recurrence were use of SVGs, diabetes, and dyslipidemia.<sup>318</sup> At 34 mean months of follow-up in a similar study of diabetics, the total arterial revascularization group had a lower incidence of cardiac-related events and higher graft patency rates.<sup>319</sup>

The most complete retrospective multicenter analysis of complete arterial revascularization versus single ITA supplemented by vein grafts compared long-term outcomes of 384 propensity matched pairs of patients. It demonstrated a statistically significant survival benefit at 15 years (54 vs 41%), suggesting bilateral ITA usage should be encouraged in patients with a reasonable life expectancy.

#### **KEY POINTS**

- **1.** Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the number one killer of Americans.
- 2. Coronary artery bypass is advantageous over medical therapy in patients with unprotected LMCA stenosis, complex CAD (eg, SYNTAX score > 22), three-vessel disease, two-vessel disease with proximal left anterior descending disease, two-vessel disease without proximal left anterior descending disease but with extensive ischemia, single-vessel proximal left anterior descending disease with use of an ITA graft, and in patients with left ventricular dysfunction.
- **3.** The STS risk model for postoperative morbidity and mortality can be found on the STS web site (www.sts.org) and includes 30-day stroke and death rates of 1.6 and 3%, respectively.
- **4.** The left internal mammary to left anterior descending CABG confers a survival advantage to coronary artery bypass patients. In the BARI trial, patency rates at 1 and 4 years were 98 and 91%, respectively.
- **5.** Skeletonization of the internal mammary artery is associated with reduced incidence of sternal wound complications.
- **6.** RA grafts have better 5-year patency (98 vs 86%) than SVGs.
- 7. Cognitive test performance of patients after CABG is no different from that of heart healthy control groups over a 1-year period.
- **8.** Freedom from angina after CABG in the BARI trial was 84% at 5 and 10 years.
- **9.** Bilateral compared to single internal mammary artery bypass grafting is associated with improved survival, but the benefit is not noted until about 10 years after operation.
