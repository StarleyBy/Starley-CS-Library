# Valvular and Ischemic Heart Disease

Kevin D. Accola • Clay M. Burnett

Recently, there have been exciting developments involving new technologies for the surgical treatment of valvular heart disease associated with coronary artery disease (CAD). Interventional therapies for coronary artery obstruction have been extended to multivessel disease with hybrid procedures (targeted percutaneous interventions staged with limited access surgical coronary bypass surgery) and continues to change the number and nature of patients referred for surgery. Similarly, the surgical treatment of structural valvular heart disease has continued to expand with advances in techniques for repair, as well as total valve replacement and valve-sparing repair options for both aortic and mitral valve abnormalities.<sup>2</sup> Most recently, bioprosthetic valve manufacturing advances in regard to calcium mitigation, tissue processing, and hemodynamically superior prosthetic valve stent designs have improved prosthetic valve durability, thereby broadening the valve replacement options for young and old alike.<sup>3</sup> The advent of transcatheter valve replacement (TAVR procedures) has also quickly become a commercial reality and has proven to be safe and efficacious in numerous studies. The stunning early success of the TAVR approach has allowed this remarkable new option to become commonplace in many institutions in hospitals around the world.<sup>4</sup> Most importantly, perhaps, is that transcatheter valvular interventions have provided very high-risk patients, such as the elderly or those with a myriad of threatening comorbidities, a viable new option to consider.

There are numerous issues the surgeon must consider when planning treatment strategies in the patient with combined valvular and CAD. It is uncommon for today's surgeon to see a patient with simple aortic or mitral valvular disease who also has straightforward proximal CAD. Indeed, it is more often a patient presents with complex, acute valvular/ventricular pathology, with superimposed diffuse, CAD. The prevalence of presurgical interventional options means that patients now undergo more aggressive medical therapy and multiple intracoronary dilation attempts before being referred for surgical evaluation. As a result, they are often referred at an older age and with more complex comorbidities, with more diffuse disease, persistent dysrhythmias, and worsening ventricular function. This older, sicker cohort of patients now referred for surgery are understandably at much

higher risk for postoperative morbidity and mortality than in previous eras. Consequently, contemporary surgeons often face difficult therapeutic dilemmas that usually requires a more flexible, systematic, and thoughtful approach. In fact, current decision-making is more often a result of multidisciplinary heart teams, utilizing broad, evidence-based data as a foundation for complex medical decisions.<sup>5</sup>

The pathophysiologic combination and interaction between valvular heart disease and associated CAD is complex. Progressive valvular heart disease clearly impacts ventricular function. The additional impact of CAD has synergistic potential to further affect ventricular morphology and physiology. In particular, the deterioration in contractile strength caused by myocardial infarction and subsequent regional wall motion injury causes progressive distortion of ventricular shape as the infarcted muscle compensates through tissue remodeling. Loss of contractile strength and remodeling after ischemic injury eventually leads to cavitary dilation, with resulting effects not only on ventricular function, but also on mitral valve performance. As valvular and subvalvular elements lose their important geometric relationships, functional valvular incompetence develops. In patients with valvular heart disease, coronary obstructions may be symptomatic or asymptomatic, but the decision to intervene surgically is often made regardless of the presence of ischemic symptoms, in order to have a protective effect toward the additive pathophysiology of concomitant cardiac diseases.

Under most circumstances, surgeons attempt to treat both valvular and CAD simultaneously. However, a combined approach leads to a prolonged and potentially complicated procedure. Accordingly, the increased risks of a combined operation demand a defined and focused operative strategy. Historically, combined coronary artery and valve operations have had an increased risk for early and late mortality compared to operations for isolated valvular heart disease (Fig. 45-1). This complexity increases the need for careful preoperative assessment of myocardial function and an understanding of the impact on ventricular function of the changing afterload and pre-load associated with valve surgery. Therefore, in adult patients with combined valvular and

ischemic heart disease, the assessment of intrinsic left ventricular function assumes paramount importance during the initial consultative process. Clinical signs and symptoms of left ventricular failure should be diligently sought. In addition to history, physical examination, and routine laboratory tests, preoperative echocardiography is mandatory. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is used to correlate preanesthetic imaging and is utilized for accurate planning of all valvular interventions, and has become standard of care in most institutions. Immediately after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass support, intraoperative TEE is carefully reviewed by the surgeon, anesthesiologist, and imaging team to evaluate the repair. If necessary, resumption of cardiopulmonary bypass support can then be done to perform additional repair efforts; the post-bypass TEE is critical for this evaluation, and requires a commitment from the entire team to be sure that the reparative efforts are optimal before the operation is terminated.

It is also important preoperatively to attempt to distinguish heart failure resulting from valvular disease from myocardial dysfunction owing to coronary ischemia. Myocardial viability assessment may be useful in eliciting ventricular size and functional changes that are exacerbated under stress conditions and may help delineate the underlying pathology, especially of the mitral valve. At cardiac catheterization, in addition to coronary artery angiography, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary pressures measurements may yield additional information about left- and right ventricular function and supplement noninvasive assessments of valve function and coronary anatomy. In centers where it

is available, positron emission tomography (PET) scans and other radioisotope imaging studies can help determine the viability of myocardium with potential reversible ischemia. These assessments are critically important before embarking on concomitant valve and coronary artery surgery; both for determining the operative risk, as well as planning the scope and extent of the surgical approach.

The assessment of valve pathology is covered in detail in previous chapters on isolated valvular heart disease. As has been noted, coronary angiography is not mandatory in all patients with valvular pathology who are about to undergo valve surgery. However, given the prevalence of CAD in aging Western populations, coronary angiography is usually performed in all patients greater than 40 years of age, and selects younger patients with suggestive symptoms or significant risk factors. More recently, patients felt to be at low risk for coronary occlusive disease may be adequately screened with coronary computed tomographic angiography.<sup>7</sup>

Because of the wide pathophysiologic spectrum of valvular and CAD, several frequently encountered valve and coronary artery combinations are considered in this chapter, including: (1) aortic stenosis (AS) with CAD, including strategies for moderate AS, (2) aortic regurgitation plus CAD, (3) mitral regurgitation plus CAD, (4) mitral stenosis plus CAD, (5) AS and mitral regurgitation plus CAD, and (6) aortic regurgitation and mitral regurgitation plus CAD.

Patients may have combined pathology of stenosis and insufficiency, but to avoid unproductive complexity, and because one lesion usually dominates, the somewhat arbitrary categorization noted above will be maintained during

the ensuing discussion. For each entity, the clinical presentation, the pathophysiology of the disease state and its correction, the operative and management approach, shortand long-term results are discussed. Today's surgeon must also be familiar with evolving hybrid techniques, such as staged coronary artery stenting and percutaneous aortic valve replacement (AVR) in the management of patients with combined valve and CAD.<sup>8</sup> Since these new innovative strategies are rapidly gaining acceptance as appropriate options in highly select patients, this chapter will also briefly review some of the more common hybrid approaches where applicable.<sup>9-12</sup>

### AORTIC STENOSIS AND CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE

Aortic stenosis is one of the more frequently encountered valvular lesions in adult populations and will continue to increase in prevalence due to our aging population. Degenerative calcific AS is most common in patients in their sixties, seventies, and eighties <sup>13-15</sup> and often is associated with CAD. <sup>16</sup> This disease combination is usually gratifying to treat because the response to surgical relief of AS and coronary artery obstructions is significant, immediate, and relatively durable.

### Clinical Presentation

Patients with AS are asymptomatic initially due to compensatory mechanisms within the left ventricle. Eventually patients can present with angina pectoris, congestive heart failure, syncope, or some combination of these as the stenosis progresses and the compensatory mechanisms begin to fail. When significant coronary artery obstruction is present, in addition to valvular obstruction, angina pectoris is almost always manifest. However, angina pectoris can occur in the absence of significant coronary artery obstructions due to insufficient diastolic coronary flow across a severely stenotic valve. Identifying symptoms of myocardial ischemia or congestive heart failure in patients with concomitant AS and significant CAD is generally straightforward. Accurate discrimination of subtle neurologic symptoms, such as syncope, presyncope, transient ischemic symptoms, or orthostatic hypotension, may be more difficult to elicit, and careful questioning regarding transient symptomatology is required. Symptoms suggestive of carotid artery obstruction should be sought and appropriately evaluated with carotid artery ultrasound and Doppler scanning, since the murmur of AS often radiates into the neck and can obscure the detection of bruits.

Prominent findings on physical examination include the typical late-packing mid-systolic crescendo murmur heard in the aortic area, radiating into the right neck. Signs of congestive heart failure with rales on chest auscultation or peripheral extremity edema may be present in later stages. The electrocardiogram may show left ventricular strain and increased QRS height due to left ventricular hypertrophy. If the patient has suffered a recent or remote myocardial infarction, then

typical ischemic electrocardiographic changes may also be present. The echocardiogram usually shows calcified and immobile aortic valve leaflets producing a contracted aortic orifice with the resultant compensatory hypertrophied left ventricle. Evidence of calcifications extending into the sinuses of Valsalva and/or the left ventricular outflow tract should be carefully evaluated. Significant acceleration of trans-valvular flow velocities, estimates of reduced outflow areas, and flow turbulence with Doppler confirms the reduced outflow area. The transaortic valvular gradient also can be determined at catheterization and is often helpful, though modern m-mode echocardiography and Doppler imaging analysis has supplanted catheter gradient assessments in many hospitals due to correlated accuracy.

The preoperative evaluation of patients with AS, CAD, and poor ventricular function is complicated. Patients with poor ventricular function often generate relatively low transaortic valve gradients. This renders the calculation of valve area for the assessment of critical AS less accurate. In those cases where poor cardiac output from left ventricular failure leads to a less-than-expected gradient across the left ventricular outflow tract, the morphologic demonstration of valve immobility and heavy leaflet calcification is an important confirmatory sign that hemodynamically significant AS is present. Fortunately, even in the presence of a low gradient, if echocardiographic signs of significant valve stenosis are present, and if left ventricular intracavitary pressure exceeds 120 mm Hg in systole, mortality rates for valve replacement are acceptable, and the clinical response to surgery is typically good.<sup>17</sup> In stark contrast, however, a poorly contractile, thinned-out left ventricle with low transvalvular gradients in the presence of low intracavitary systolic pressures, usually suggests that the operation carries high risks, and due to inadequate ventricular reserve, may be of very limited benefit. On the other hand, a poorly contractile ventricle that has normal, or even increased wall thickness, will usually recover significant contractile force if a substantial amount of reversible ischemic myocardium is demonstrated, and if the degree of AS is significant. In addition to ventricular function, other important determinants of the risks and advisability of surgery include patient age, functional status (ie, "frailty index"), presence of previous cardiac operations, and the presence of other comorbidities that affect end-organ function, especially renal and pulmonary function.

### Pathophysiology

Aortic stenosis produces impairment of left ventricular emptying during systole, which ultimately is the source of all the symptoms and signs of AS. Most patients with AS have hypertrophied and thick-walled left ventricles to overcome the obstructive valve orifice. Contractile function is initially good, and ejection fraction is usually maintained because of these compensatory mechanisms for some time. In later stages of the disease, the ventricle begins to fail due to persistently severe afterload resistance, with enlargement

FIGURE 45-2 Starling curve of heart failure.

and global diminution of contractile function as the patient progress up the Starling curve of heart failure (Fig. 45-2). At any stage of the disease, the additional presence of critical coronary artery obstruction can cause specific regional wall motion abnormalities that may be exacerbated by stenosis of the aortic valve. Significant three-vessel CAD may itself lead to temporary global ventricular dysfunction, which may be reversible with revascularization apart from any valve replacement effects.

In patients with critical AS and good ventricular function, valve replacement immediately reduces left ventricular afterload. Because most patients with AS have thick-walled hypertrophied ventricles, intraoperative subendocardial ischemia may be more difficult to avoid during aortic cross-clamping and subsequent cardioplegic arrest. Although revascularization should not decrease left ventricular contractility, and should actually improve it long-term, some myocardial stunning with a temporary decrease in global and regional left ventricular contractility inevitably results from the surgical procedure. 18-21 This, of course, assumes even more important pathophysiologic significance in patients with poor ventricular function preoperatively. Diastolic dysfunction may also occur postoperatively, causing a less compliant left ventricle. The most extreme example of this was the so-called "stone heart"22 that occasionally plagued early cardiac surgery pioneers who first attempted AVR surgery. Fortunately, modern myocardial preservation strategies have eliminated this feared complication through the liberal use of antegrade and retrograde delivery techniques and more physiologic cardioplegic solutions that optimally protects myocardial cellular integrity and tissue function.

Postoperatively, patients usually enjoy a dramatic improvement in symptoms. Relief of left ventricular outflow obstruction immediately leads to enhanced cardiac output and perfusion of vital organs. In addition, left ventricular remodeling and regression of hypertrophy usually occurs over time. <sup>21</sup> Simultaneous correction of myocardial ischemia can lead to improved subendocardial perfusion, as well as recruitment of formerly hibernating myocardium. The optimal final result is regression of hypertrophied ventricular mass, improved

diastolic relaxation, balanced transmyocardial coronary perfusion, and elimination of left ventricular outflow obstruction, culminating in recovery of normal ventricular function.

### Moderate Aortic Stenosis and Coronary Artery Disease

Symptomatic, severe AS is universally agreed to benefit from AVR at the time of coronary revascularization, but the management of patients with CAD and either mild or moderate AS continues to remain a matter of controversy. The earliest debates centered on the anticipated risks of a future reoperation, particularly in a population of advanced age, versus the risks of imposing on a patient a more complex initial operation with subsequent lifelong prosthetic valve concerns that may not be immediately necessary. Given the relatively reduced 10-year survival in advanced age patients undergoing cardiac surgery, valve durability was not considered to be a central factor limiting the success of a combined initial AVR/coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) strategy. Thus, the initial opinion favored a liberal AVR/CABG combination approach in patients with moderate AS, as the reoperative risks were considered the more dangerous of the two options. However, the early STS data base for AVR/CABG outcomes clearly showed a mortality nearly double that for isolated CABG (6-7% and 2-3%, respectively)<sup>23</sup> challenging the belief that initial combined valve-CAD operations were generally safer in terms of primary mortality and morbidity risks. Moreover, as experience with reoperations has grown, more recent studies demonstrate much lower risks of reoperation for AVR in post-CABG patients that rival levels similar to initial AVR/CABG procedures.<sup>24</sup> In fact, the lowered risks of redo sternotomy for primary AVR after previous CABG (6-7%) has now shifted the debate from one of concerns over the risks of reoperation, to predicting the incremental progression in AS if it is withheld at the initial CAD surgery.<sup>25-27</sup>

Although there is no clearly identified method of predicting valvular progression, and surgical expertise is critical in formulating a surgical strategy and timing of intervention, estimates of the rate of progression of AS may help provide support for valve replacement, even without hemodynamically critical disease.<sup>28</sup> For instance, it has been established that the rate of valvular progression is more rapid if the valve is heavily calcified, and if the patient has advanced atherosclerotic systemic disease or renal failure.<sup>25</sup> Studies also demonstrate that age and valvular gradient at the time of diagnosis are important criteria to consider.<sup>27</sup> Verhoye et al<sup>29</sup> found that using echocardiography on a serial basis, AVR is recommended to be added to the revascularization procedure for younger patients (<70 years) if their peak gradient is >25-30 mm Hg, on the assumption of reasonable longevity and the probability AS would bear future symptoms. In older patients (>80 years), competing causes of mortality rationally increases the thresholds for concomitant replacement, and AVR is added only if their peak gradient exceeds 50 mm Hg, as longevity is often related to other factors before AS progression occurs.<sup>25</sup> Furthermore, studies show that reoperation

for AVR after CABG rarely occurs within 5 years of CABG.<sup>26</sup> Consequently, from a survival standpoint, little is gained from adding AVR to patients >80 to 85 years of age at the time of coronary revascularization unless the valve is symptomatic or has severe, but incidentally identified hemodynamics.<sup>25,26</sup> In certain extremely high-risk cohorts, a multidisciplinary team may decide on a "hybrid" approach, utilizing percutaneous coronary artery stenting for major coronary artery obstruction, followed by percutaneous AVR (TAVR).<sup>30-32</sup>

Despite the recent trend outlined above favoring isolated CABG when concomitant moderate AS exits, there is also evidence that favors concomitant valve replacement in some patients with moderate AS who are referred for surgical myocardial revascularization.<sup>33-36</sup> In one study,<sup>33</sup> survival rates at both 1 year and 8 years were superior for patients who underwent valve replacement for moderate AS (gradient >30 mm Hg or gradient <40 mm Hg with valve area between 1.0 and 1.5 cm<sup>2</sup>). One-year survival was 90% in those having valve replacement compared to 85% in patients having CABG alone. Similarly, 8-year survival (55 vs 39%) was statistically significantly better (p < .001). Although this data may reveal some bias in healthier patients receiving concomitant AVR/CABG than their more chronically ill peers who were felt not to tolerate more extensive surgery and were only offered isolated CABG, it remains true that this dichotomy of patient groups is commonly seen in clinical practice. Thus, support for both strategies is rational and expected, and can be used to maintain a flexible approach when faced with moderate AS and severe CAD in patients of wide-ranging clinical conditions.25-29

In summary, given the absence of convincing data that unilaterally supports an operative strategy for the treatment of moderate AS, at the time of surgical coronary revascularization, it is best to individualize patient selection carefully, relative to surgeon and institutional expertise and practice. Significant patient comorbidities, and risk/benefit assessment, including an accurate estimate of expected rehabilitation potential (particularly in frail, elderly candidates), must be contemplated. Review of the initial and recent data and strategies derived from both experience, as well as available relevant data demonstrates that a flexible and individualized approach is warranted to yield the best patient outcomes.

### **Operative Management**

Monitoring for surgery of the aortic valve and coronary arteries includes catheters and measurements that have become standard for most cardiac surgical operations. These include an arterial line (usually in the radial artery for blood pressure and blood gases) and an optional pulmonary artery catheter for measurement of pulmonary artery pressures, and cardiac output by thermodilution, with optical sensors for continuous estimation of mixed venous oxygen saturation. While the pulmonary artery catheter has a balloon at its tip, occlusion wedge pressure is rarely measured in the perioperative period because of the danger of pulmonary artery rupture. Particularly useful information

is provided by continuous measurement of mixed venous oxygen saturation. Of late, use of arterial flow or central venous monitoring devices, along with TEE, provides satisfactory estimates of continuous cardiac outputs and monitoring of volume management. This has significantly reduced our reliance on traditional, but more invasive, pulmonary artery catheters.

The perfusion setup is standard and similar to that for isolated coronary artery bypass. A single aortic cannula is ordinarily placed in the distal ascending aorta. A single two-stage venous cannula is placed via the right atrial appendage with its tip positioned in the inferior vena cava. After establishment of cardiopulmonary bypass, the patient is usually cooled to 32 to 34°C, during which time a left ventricular vent is positioned via the right superior pulmonary vein. With the heart well emptied, the aortic cross-clamp is applied during a temporary reduction in pump flow. Thereafter, the heart is arrested with cold (4°C) potassium crystalloid or blood cardioplegia. Low aortotomy incisions are recommended for maximal visibility, with the incision directed toward the noncoronary sinus if annular or root enlargement is anticipated. After valve excision, implant techniques according to each surgeon's preference is performed. In situations of lowlying coronary ostia, suture techniques may need to be varied to prevent ostial compression. Prior to closure, the valve and coronary ostia are carefully reinspected a final time for clearance and embolic debris, and the aorta is closed. Deairing maneuvers are routine, and TEE aids assurance of complete removal, as well as early detection of proper prosthetic function.

A combination of antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia is optimal. The initial dose of cardioplegia (15 mL/kg) is typically split into a two-thirds antegrade and one-third retrograde dose, with subsequent doses of 200 to 300 mL cardioplegia delivered via the retrograde catheter every 20 minutes throughout the duration of cardiac arrest during the operation. This is particularly convenient because retrograde cardioplegia can be given even after the aortic root is opened without disrupting exposure or flow of the operation. In patients with significant left ventricular hypertrophy, light ventricular and inferior septal protection by retrograde cardioplegia perfusion alone may be inadequate. Handheld direct antegrade perfusion directly into the coronary ostia may be helpful.

The combination of aortic valve disease and CAD in patients has historically been accepted to be a marker of significantly reduced longevity.<sup>37</sup> In the elderly, with reduced life expectancies, bioprosthetic valve durability remains the valve of choice, particularly when associated with concomitant CAD.<sup>38</sup> Currently, with the advent of new bioprosthetic valve technology with calcium mitigation processing, and proven structural longevity, there is a trend toward increased tissue valve utilization.<sup>39,40</sup> As a result, many younger age patients considering the obligation of lifelong anticoagulation and the improvements in valve design and durability are opting to receive bioprosthetic valves instead of mechanical prostheses.

### Results

Early hospital mortality after concomitant AVR and CABG ranges from approximately 2 to 10%. In earlier studies, but more recent studies suggest that modern operative management reveals very similar outcomes and mortality risks in patients having isolated AVR and those having combine AVR/ CABG<sup>26,35,36,48,42-47</sup> Higher mortality is observed in patients with more severe symptoms of heart failure and impaired ventricular function preoperatively, as well as the elderly or other patients with numerous comorbidities. The most frequent causes of operative death are low-output cardiac failure, myocardial infarction, and arrhythmia. Incremental risk factors for hospital death include patient age, functional class, diffuse CAD, and poor preoperative ventricular function. In a number of studies, late survival has ranged from 60 to 80% at 5 years and 50 to 75% at 8 years postoperatively (Fig. 45-3). 33,42-47 By multivariate analysis, risk factors for reduced late survival include older age, cardiac enlargement, and more severe preoperative clinical symptoms. The use of a mechanical prosthesis at valve replacement has been associated with similar long-term survival though lower long-term event-free survival.<sup>39</sup> Nonetheless, many elderly patients still have acceptable results following relief of AS, even those undergoing redo valve surgery that is combined with coronary revascularization.<sup>47</sup> As discussed previously, choice of valve type is a complex issue that takes on even more importance in combined valve-coronary artery surgery. A frank discussion of the advantages and drawbacks of each valve option continues to be an important component of the preoperative evaluation and planning for this type of surgery. In some circumstances, consideration of alternative procedures such as coronary artery stenting followed by percutaneous valve

replacement may be indicated and necessary in otherwise inoperable or extreme risk patients. 5,8,49

### AORTIC REGURGITATION AND CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE

Significant isolated aortic regurgitation occurs less often in older populations, though it may be associated with AS when the valve becomes immobile. Aortic valvular regurgitation is also less often encountered with significant CAD than in patients with AS. Most series of patients undergoing AVR and CABG include a relatively small number (10 to 25%) of patients with aortic insufficiency as compared to AS. 36,42-44 Although the operative management of patients with aortic regurgitation and CAD is similar to that previously described, aortic insufficiency produces different pathophysiologic effects that have implications for perioperative management. Moreover, the presence of an incompetent aortic valve introduces nuances to the intraoperative management and myocardial protection of these patients, primarily due to preoperative ventricular decompensation.

### Clinical Presentation

Patients with aortic regurgitation and CAD usually present in one of three ways. The aortic regurgitation may be asymptomatic and detected incidentally during evaluation for symptomatic coronary disease. Second, the patient may be asymptomatic, yet a routine physical examination reveals a murmur of aortic insufficiency that leads to cardiac evaluation and detection of coronary disease. Finally, patients may present relatively late in the course of valvular heart disease

with congestive heart failure caused by decompensation of the volume-overloaded left ventricle from long-standing insufficiency or with superimposed ischemic ventricular damage from combined CAD. Insufficiency of the aortic valve may also occur with dilatation of the ascending aorta that often involves with the coronary sinuses, particularly in patients with bicuspid valvular anatomy. Patients, therefore, may present within a broad spectrum of clinical signs and symptoms ranging from no symptoms and essentially normal physiology, to classic ischemic syndromes and severe congestive heart failure. The physical signs also depend on the nature of the presentation. In general, all patients with significant aortic insufficiency have an audible early diastolic regurgitant murmur. In late stages, rales and peripheral edema and other advanced signs of congestive heart failure usually occur with a prominent diastolic murmur.

The preoperative evaluation of a patient with aortic insufficiency and CAD is no different from that previously described for patients with AS and ischemic heart disease. Echocardiography is particularly useful in detecting aortic regurgitation because a physiologically significant murmur can be difficult to detect. In addition, echocardiography gives important information regarding both ventricular contractile function and ventricular size. Because many patients with aortic regurgitation are usually asymptomatic until marked left ventricular dilation occurs, careful evaluation for changes in ventricular size or function is important. The presence of these changes may constitute an indication to proceed with surgical intervention in the absence of significant symptoms.

### Pathophysiology

Aortic regurgitation increases left ventricular preload and causes left ventricular dilatation. Dilatation does not occur acutely; however, patients with acute aortic insufficiency are often severely symptomatic owing to a sudden increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and a dramatic decrease in net forward cardiac output. Global left ventricular dysfunction caused by CAD also can contribute to left ventricular dilatation. Valve replacement relieves some of the preload but does not immediately result in improved left ventricular contractility. Revascularization of ischemic, hibernating myocardium in patients with AR and severe CAD may produce more immediate improved contractility as compared to patients with long-standing isolated aortic valvular insufficiency.<sup>48,50</sup>

The indications for surgery in aortic regurgitation are reviewed in depth in the section on aortic valve disease. When CAD is also present, ischemic regional wall motion abnormalities can usually be distinguished from severe, global ventricular dilatation due to severe aortic valvular insufficiency. In patients with symptomatic AR who also have diffuse three-vessel CAD, however, assigning the primary cause of global left ventricular dysfunction to either ischemia or acute valvular-related ventricular dilatation is difficult. Attempting to distinguish between the relative impact of either valvular insufficiency or CAD on ventricular function is of paramount importance in the preoperative assessment and risk

stratification of these patients. This is because regional wall abnormalities due to CAD are more likely to immediately improve after myocardial revascularization, as compared to patients with global, severe ventricular dilation caused by long-standing AR. In difficult cases, an evaluation of myocardial viability (with thallium or PET scanning) may be helpful in evaluating candidates for surgery. Decisions about timing of aortic valve surgery in the presence of CAD are different from those in cases of isolated valvular disease, with the usual result that the valve is replaced earlier in the course of the valvular disease due to the pressing nature of symptomatic myocardial ischemia.

### **Operative Management**

The operation is conducted in a similar fashion to that described for AS and CAD. However, in the presence of significant aortic valvular insufficiency, antegrade cardioplegia in the aortic root is often less effective because a large portion of the cardioplegia solution leaks into the left ventricle due to valvular incompetence. As a result, retrograde cardioplegia through the coronary sinus is strongly recommended. However, since retrograde cardioplegia is recognized to be less effective in protecting right ventricular myocardium due to inconsistent venous anatomy, periodic delivery of antegrade cardioplegia using handheld catheters is advised. Technical operative details are essentially the same as those outlined earlier for AS operations.

Considerations in weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass are somewhat different from those described for AS. Patients with aortic regurgitation are more likely to have dilated ventricles that poorly tolerate increases in afterload. TEE has proved invaluable in successfully managing adjustments in preload and afterload during weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. In patients with volume-overloaded ventricles caused by aortic insufficiency, vasodilatory inotrope infusions, such as milrinone and dobutamine, have an important role because they provide both inotropic support and ventricular unloading. In some circumstances, use of an intraaortic balloon pump may be necessary and beneficial in patients with marginal functional reserve. In rare instances, mechanical circulatory assistance with a ventricular assist device is required. Its use is generally reserved for younger patients without comorbid conditions in whom prompt improvement in ventricular function is anticipated.

### Results

Early results after operation for aortic regurgitation and CAD include an expected hospital mortality rate of less than 10%. 36,42,48 Incremental risk factors for hospital death are similar to those described previously, with advanced age and poor ventricular function, combined with the presence of diffuse CAD, having the greatest impact. Late survival after this operation is similar to that for AS and CAD (Fig. 45-3). Despite the impression that patients with aortic insufficiency and CAD do not do as well as those with AS, aortic

insufficiency has not been an independent risk factor for early or late mortality. 48 As expected, recovery of ventricular ejection fraction does have a favorable impact on late mortality. Although some improvement of function can occur with elimination of the volume overload and revascularization in patients with combined valvular and CAD, when ventricular dilatation and dysfunction occur in the setting of chronic aortic regurgitation, these often are irreversible changes. Overall, recovery of ejection fraction and ventricular function in patients with aortic insufficiency is less when compared with AS when both are corrected in the later stages of the disease process. This observation is the primary reason that valve replacement is recommended for aortic valvular insufficiency before irreversible changes in ventricular morphology and function have occurred. However, although failure of recovery of ventricular function in this setting may have an impact on long-term survival, even patients with late stage aortic valvular insufficiency should tolerate valve replacement surgery.

### MITRAL REGURGITATION AND CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE

Successful management of patients with mitral regurgitation and CAD remains one of the most challenging and controversial topics in adult cardiac surgery.<sup>51</sup> This group of patients tends to be complex, and their surgical care is accomplished at higher risk. 52-57 This is almost certainly because of the complex interaction between the left ventricle and that of the mitral valvular apparatus. Normal mitral valve function depends on healthy supporting ventricular muscle to maintain proper alignment. Similarly, normal ventricular function depends on competence of the mitral valve. Abnormal valve function due to CAD occurs because of the impact of ischemia on the mitral valve apparatus, damaging subvalvular structural integrity including papillary muscle involvement. Remodeling of ischemic zones eventually leads to ventricular dilatation, and subsequent annular geometry.<sup>58</sup> Therefore, there is a unique, amplifying potential when CAD and mitral valve disease coexist, making patient management with this combination of pathophysiology more complicated, and the surgical management potentially more difficult.

In patients with preserved ventricular function, the pathophysiology and management strategies are not significantly different from those for treatment of isolated mitral regurgitation or CAD. Patients with acute onset of mild or moderate mitral insufficiency, in the presence of global ventricular dysfunction secondary to severe CAD, can be safely treated by coronary revascularization alone. If it becomes necessary to include mitral valve annuloplasty to myocardial revascularization, the operation becomes more complex and longer. Therefore, as described previously, a carefully conceived operative plan with special attention to myocardial preservation is important. However, the more interesting problems are in those patients with mitral insufficiency and CAD who do not have normal ventricular function. Often these patients present with recurrent ischemia, in addition to

previous myocardial infarction, that culminates with resultant regional wall motion abnormalities that produces mitral insufficiency.  $^{62}$ 

### **Clinical Presentation**

The spectrum of clinical presentation ranges from patients who are asymptomatic to those who are moribund in cardiogenic shock. The degree of mitral insufficiency involved can widely vary from mild insufficiency when associated with a limited ischemic event causing minor segmental wall motion abnormalities, to severe regurgitation and global left ventricular failure from acute ischemic rupture of a papillary muscle. Patients who present with acute syndromes are often related to myocardial infarction and demonstrate the sudden development of mitral insufficiency. These patients are extremely ill when they present in congestive heart failure, often presenting in profound cardiogenic shock. Management of these patients can be difficult and challenging. When faced with extreme mitral insufficiency and cardiogenic shock, immediate IABP support should be instituted for cardiac support and to provide valuable mechanical afterload reduction of the acutely injured left ventricle.

Findings on physical examination obviously relate to the nature of the presentation, and can range from signs of mild mitral insufficiency to severe congestive failure and cardiogenic shock. An electrocardiogram may show evidence of acute or chronic ischemia, and all patients should undergo echocardiography. TEE should be available for intraoperative use. Transesophageal echocardiogram is particularly useful because it gives information in regard to valvular function, left ventricular geometry and contractility, ventricular wall thickness, and associated regional wall motion abnormalities. Also the status of the other valves, particularly the tricuspid, can be quickly assessed to determine if they may require surgical attention as well. Cardiac catheterization is performed in these patients for the same reasons outlined for patients with aortic valve disease.

### Pathophysiology

A detailed understanding of the pathophysiology of functional mitral insufficiency is important for planning the operative approach. Limited regional wall motion abnormalities involving the papillary muscle and adjacent ventricular wall can produce dynamic changes that produce corresponding insufficiency of specific mitral valve regions. More global ventricular dysfunction from CAD can produce ventricular dilatation with profound mitral annular dilatation and progressive mitral insufficiency. The jet of ischemic mitral regurgitation typically is centrally or posteriorly directed on ECHO. Mitral regurgitation increases left ventricular preload and decreases afterload at the expense of cardiac output. Ischemic damage causes ventricular dilatation with decreased contractility and an increase in left ventricular filling pressures. These combined lesions cause synergistic decompensation, chronically leading to pulmonary hypertension with

secondary tricuspid regurgitation. Cardiac output may be very low, especially in patients with acute mitral insufficiency. Mitral insufficiency may occur in association with CAD, but often the CAD is the cause of functional mitral insufficiency. The pathophysiology of ischemic mitral insufficiency results in tethering or retraction of the valve leaflets, annular dilatation, geometric displacement of the subvalvular apparatus, or some combination of all of these. Correction of mitral insufficiency either by valve repair or valve replacement produces an instantaneous increase in left ventricular afterload. The ventricle no longer has the low-impedance left atrial chamber into which to eject blood and must overcome systemic afterload in systole. Even when myocardial ischemia is reversible, recruitment of hibernating myocardium may take time. These factors, in combination with the sudden increase in left ventricular afterload, contribute to the difficulty and increased risk of managing this entity. Secondary right ventricular failure may occur because pulmonary hypertension, if present, does not decrease immediately after mitral valve repair or replacement, and CAD also may affect right ventricular function.

Symptomatic CAD in the presence of moderate or severe insufficiency in the setting of regional wall motion abnormally is the usual indicators for combined surgery. As noted, patients with acute illnesses may be in extremis and may benefit from temporizing measures. 63 Ventricular dysfunction is not a contraindication to surgery, especially if it is caused by reversible ischemia. Patients with global, irreversible, and severely dilated cardiomyopathy with severe mitral insufficiency, however, should not be operated on because the ventricle tolerates the increase in overload poorly and results are unsatisfactory. Severe diffuse CAD in which complete revascularization cannot be accomplished is a significant indication of extreme risk, as well. Estimation of the viability of the myocardium and demonstration of reversible ischemia using thallium or PET scanning therefore are important in stable patients. Left atrial enlargement in long-standing mitral valve insufficiency is common, and patients often present with atrial fibrillation. This condition also contributes to the reduction in cardiac output and ablation of the arrhythmia at the time of surgery may confer addition benefit.

### **Operative Management**

Preoperative decision strategies in patients with mitral regurgitation and CAD remains controversial. 64,65 The decision for the necessity of associated mitral valve intervention in this setting becomes critical because if moderate insufficiency is left untreated, the patient may be compromised. However, mitral regurgitation in the presence of acute CAD with regional ventricular decompensation that is caused by reversible myocardial ischemia can improve with isolated revascularization. 61 In many instances, however, residual significant mitral valve regurgitation may remain. It is important, therefore, to distinguish organic from functional mitral insufficiency as well as acute mitral insufficiency from ischemia as opposed to a more chronic mitral valvular pathology secondary to previous

ischemia and subsequent wall motion abnormality. Intraoperative TEE is an essential tool for assessment of mitral valve function in this setting, though the vasodilator effects of general anesthesia and subsequent decrease in afterload may minimize the appearance of the insufficiency.<sup>65</sup> Patients with no preoperative congestive heart failure, normal left atrial dimensions, normal pulmonary pressures, and mild to moderate mitral insufficiency by TEE after induction of anesthesia typically do not need mitral valve intervention.<sup>66,67</sup> Many of these patients will appear to have more mitral regurgitation and higher pulmonary pressures at catheterization or when they are ischemic than when they are under anesthesia. Furthermore, although mitral valve repair improves mitral valve regurgitation volume, it does not infer late mortality advantages over revascularization alone in large studies.<sup>67</sup> Complete myocardial revascularization alone may suffice for milder forms of initial valvular insufficiency (Fig. 45-4).

Despite a lack of consensus on the prognostic value of concomitant mitral valve repair at the time of revascularization, several recent studies suggest that the quality of modern surgical results justifies a more aggressive approach to valve repair in patients with moderate mitral insufficiency and CAD.51,63-65,67,68 Most patients with ventricular enlargement and annular dilation secondary to CAD with functional mitral insufficiency determined to be significant may be managed with annuloplasty alone.<sup>69</sup> Restricted leaflet motion is frequently a complication of ischemic changes in ventricular shape and resultant papillary muscle displacement.<sup>70</sup> In patients with calcification, extensive fibrosis of the posterior leaflet, or severely restricted posterior leaflet motion, mitral valve replacement is warranted. Historically, results of mitral repair and CABG are superior to those of mitral valve replacement when repair is technically possible. Anesthetic considerations are similar to those described previously, although it must be recognized that these patients are generally quite compromised. As suggested earlier, intraoperative TEE is particularly important in this group of patients for pre- and postoperative assessment of valve and ventricular function. Setup for cardiopulmonary bypass is similar to that described earlier. The most common incision providing access to the mitral

**FIGURE 45-4** Complete myocardial revascularization alone may suffice for milder forms of initial valvular insufficiency.

valve is in the wall of the left atrium anterior to the right pulmonary veins. Preparative dissection (Sondegaard's maneuver) of the interatrial groove (Waterston's groove) facilitates exposure using this incision. Alternative approaches for valve exposure and their advantages have been described elsewhere.

As noted, patients with papillary muscle rupture caused by infarction usually require valve replacement. Some surgeons have reported success with reimplantation of the papillary muscle, but this strategy is risky in these patients because the operation must be both expeditious and effective. Multiple attempts to achieve mitral valve competence in this group of critically ill patients are poorly tolerated. A reimplanted, infarcted papillary muscle does not necessarily restore mitral valve competence and also may be subject to early or late breakdown.

As in combined aortic valve and coronary artery surgery, distal graft anastomoses are performed first. At this point, after the atrium has been opened, it may be prudent to undertake an arrhythmia ablation procedure in selected patients with atrial fibrillation. Radiofrequency or cryoablation probes can be used to create a standard lesion set within the left atria, as described in Chapter 55. The left atrial appendage should be oversewn. Valve repair or replacement is then carried out, followed by performance of the mammary artery anastomosis. Proximal graft anastomoses can be done either after release of the cross-clamp in place.

Weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass is similar to that in patients with aortic insufficiency and CAD. Again, in this

group of patients, afterload reduction using pharmacologic agents such as dobutamine and milrinone may be indicated. There should be a low threshold for insertion of the intraaortic balloon postoperatively. Many of these patients, particularly when emergent, have severely compromised ventricular hemodynamics and may be quite tenuous for hours to days after surgery.

Strict attention must be paid to right ventricular function and intraoperative right ventricular myocardial protection in this group of patients. Right ventricular failure must be anticipated and correctly diagnosed and managed. The presence of a falling systemic blood pressure and cardiac output with rising pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and controlled venous pressure should prompt a search for right ventricular failure.

#### Results

Hospital mortality for this group of patients is higher than that for most other forms of acquired heart disease. Early mortality rates range from 3% in good-risk patients to 60% in the sickest patients. <sup>64,65,67,68,71,72</sup> The higher mortality is seen in patients with acute ischemic mitral valve disease and severe ventricular dysfunction who require emergency surgery. Incremental risk factors for early death include age, functional class, ventricular function, elevated pulmonary pressures, and cardiogenic shock. Late survival in patients with this entity is 55 to 85% at 5 years and 30 to 45% at 10 years (Fig. 45-5). <sup>52-57,66,72-74</sup>

In general, patients who survive surgery have good relief of symptoms, although recurrent mitral insufficiency remains an issue for some patients who have undergone restrictive annuloplasty. The risk factors for this complication remain incompletely identified, although abnormal ventricular morphology and regional function appear to play a role. Significant risk factors for late death include preoperative functional class, residual postoperative left ventricular dysfunction, and diffuse myocardial ischemia.

### MITRAL STENOSIS AND CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE

Patients with mitral stenosis and CAD usually have good left ventricular function and often are a relatively straightforward group of patients to care for because the mitral stenosis does not subject the left ventricle to abnormal hemodynamic loads. CAD may cause unexpected left ventricular dysfunction, but this is unusual, unless weakness, global ischemia coexists. A common concern in mitral stenosis patients is postoperative right ventricular dysfunction because pulmonary hypertension, with its potential to produce right ventricular failure and tricuspid insufficiency, is often encountered in patients with severe mitral stenosis.

### Clinical Presentation

As implied earlier, mitral stenosis is usually the dominant lesion in patients with mitral stenosis and CAD; therefore, symptoms are typically caused by the valvular lesion. Patients usually present with shortness of breath, orthopnea, and fatigue, despite normal left ventricular function. Atrial fibrillation is a common presenting symptom with mitral stenosis due to left atrial dilatation. Patients with mitral stenosis and CAD infrequently have angina as a presenting symptom. The electrocardiogram may show evidence of right ventricular strain and hypertrophy. TEE confirms the diagnosis of mitral stenosis and usually shows a small left ventricle with preserved contractile function. The right ventricle may be enlarged and hypertrophied. Cardiac catheterization further confirms the diagnosis by showing a gradient across the mitral valve. Other important information gleaned from invasive catheterization includes a measurement of the pulmonary artery pressures and central venous pressure. The degree of pulmonary hypertension is a marker of the severity and duration of mitral stenosis and alerts the surgeon to the potential for right ventricular failure postoperatively. An elevated central venous pressure is a potential sign that right ventricular decompensation has already occurred. Coronary angiography should be done in all patients with angina pectoris, and as noted before, in any patient greater than age 40 years in whom mitral valve surgery is anticipated.

### Pathophysiology

Unlike the other entities described, mitral stenosis and CAD do not have significantly synergistic pathologic effects on the

heart. CAD usually has more profound effects on the left ventricle, since left ventricular mass remains reasonably protected in patients with mitral stenosis until late in the disease. The right ventricle is the chamber most vulnerable to the effects of long-standing mitral stenosis due to increased transpulmonary pressure gradients. However, even with right ventricular hypertension, the potential impact of CAD on right ventricular function in adults is usually not prohibitive. In circumstances involving patients with diffuse CAD and significant ischemic cardiomyopathy, the risks of surgery are elevated, primarily because of global ventricular ischemic dysfunction.

The indications for surgery, not surprisingly, are usually determined by the severity of the mitral stenosis. Patients with significant heart failure symptoms and low cardiac output from mitral stenosis whose calculated valve area is less than 1 cm<sup>2</sup> should have a mitral valve operation, and associated bypass grafting if significant CAD is present. Patients with significant CAD but only mild mitral stenosis may arise, and these patients are well managed with CABG and mitral commissurotomy, if technically feasible. Another alternative in patients considered high risk for surgery, is the staged approach of percutaneous revascularization with stents and balloon mitral valvuloplasty. The number of patients suitable for the latter procedure is relatively small and thus far there are no definitive data supporting this kind of hybrid transcatheter approach to these lesions. These clinical situations are best managed within a multidisciplinary team on an individualized, patient-by-patient basis.5

### **Operative Management**

Monitoring, perfusion setup, and operative sequence are identical to those described for treatment of mitral regurgitation and CAD. TEE is useful to assess both the feasibility of mitral commissurotomy (or more extensive mitral repair) and the postoperative results of attempted valvuloplasty. In most patients with mitral stenosis, however, valve replacement is required because of irreversible calcific and fibrotic damage to the leaflets and subvalvular apparatus. A biological prosthesis is used most often due to a preponderance of advanced age patients, even if the majority of patients have chronic atrial fibrillation from left atrial enlargement. Although long-term anticoagulation is indicated in these patients, use of a biologic valve allows less aggressive anticoagulation regimens in patients often burdened with other comorbidities, and who are judged to be at significant risk for chronic anticoagulation. Particular attention must be directed to preservation of the right ventricle at regular intervals during the operation. In practice, this means that initial and subsequent doses of cardioplegia should be given antegrade, as well as retrograde, because the latter approach usually offers variable distribution of cardioplegia to the right ventricle, proximal inferior septal, and inferior left ventricular regions.

TEE is also an important adjunct in monitoring both right and left ventricular function postoperatively. The early differentiation between left and right ventricular failure is

facilitated by the use of this modality during weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. If inotropic drugs are required, their selection should be based, in part, on the consideration that pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure might be important components of the clinical syndrome. Drugs such as isoproterenol, dobutamine, and especially milrinone (the latter often in combination with norepinephrine or other catecholamines to counteract profound peripheral vasodilatory effects from phosphodiesterase inhibition) may be indicated for their combined beneficial effects on right ventricular contractility and pulmonary vascular resistance. Judicious use of inotropic drugs and careful administration of fluid are usually sufficient to restore adequate cardiac output. The intraaortic balloon is rarely indicated in these patients because right ventricular problems predominate. Temporary support with either a right ventricular assist device or ECMO for acute pulmonary failure may be employed if the above measures are inadequate. Once the acute postcardiotomy failure resolves dramatic decreases in pulmonary artery pressures and subsequent recovery of right ventricular function allows for removal of extraordinary support.

#### Results

Early mortality after combined surgery for mitral stenosis and CAD is approximately 8%. 44-46 This is not significantly different from results of surgery in lower-risk patients with mitral regurgitation and CAD. Long-term probability of survival is approximately 50% at 7 years and in one series was not significantly different from that for patients with ischemic mitral insufficiency.<sup>54-56</sup> Interestingly, long-term survival of patients with myxoid degeneration of the mitral valve and CAD (65%) was significantly better than survival of the patients with rheumatic or ischemic mitral valve disease and CAD in at least one series.<sup>52</sup> As implied, rheumatic valve pathology is a risk factor for late death, as is poor preoperative left ventricular function and the presence of ventricular arrhythmias. Interestingly, the use of a bioprosthesis without anticoagulants confers both a survival advantage and an event-free survival advantage in these patients These data lend support to the hypothesis that biologic valves may be appropriate for mitral replacement in older patients and those with CAD, whose expected life span may be shorter than the anticipated durability of the replacement device.<sup>37</sup>

## AORTIC STENOSIS, MITRAL REGURGITATION, AND CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE

Patients with AS, mitral regurgitation, and CAD often present with AS as the predominant lesion. It is important to note that functional mitral regurgitation may improve after relief of AS with concomitant reduction in left ventricular systolic pressure. If the mitral valve is not intrinsically diseased, it may not require surgical intervention.<sup>75</sup>

### **Clinical Presentation**

Patients with these diseases often present identically with patients with AS and CAD, but may do so earlier because of the combined valvular lesions. Angina, congestive heart failure, and syncope may be presenting symptoms alone or together. It is relatively uncommon for symptoms resulting from mitral insufficiency to be predominant. Echocardiography is an extremely important tool in this disease combination. Careful evaluation of the mitral valve, often using TEE, is necessary to determine the degree of intrinsic mitral valve disease, because improvement in mitral insufficiency is expected after AVR and relief of left ventricular outflow obstruction.<sup>72</sup> It is critical to determine whether or not the mitral valve has anatomical abnormalities that might not reverse with aortic surgery alone.<sup>73,76</sup> Cardiac catheterization is required, as it is for the other disease entities described.

### Pathophysiology

Aortic stenosis increases left ventricular afterload and therefore can contribute to increasing the amount of mitral regurgitation. Because the combined lesions may cause patients to present earlier in the course of the disease, the left ventricle may be better preserved in this setting than in patients with isolated mitral insufficiency and CAD. Also as noted, the mitral valve may not be structurally diseased. Because of earlier presentation, pulmonary hypertension and subsequent right ventricular failure and tricuspid valve incompetence are usually not prominent features. Because relief of outflow obstruction helps left ventricular function immediately, these patients often do quite well.

The indications for surgery are usually the same as for AS and CAD. Critical AS, when documented, requires valve replacement; if significant CAD is present, CABGs are also done in the sequence previously described. Mitral valve repair is almost always appropriate with annular remodeling when mitral insufficiency is moderate to severe and reparable anatomical abnormalities of the valve are detected. End-stage ventricular dysfunction with ventricular dilatation and myocardial thinning are the primary cardiac contraindications to surgery.

### **Operative Management**

Anesthesia and perfusion setup are identical to those described for mitral valve and coronary artery surgery. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiographic monitoring again plays an important role because the intraoperative assessment of mitral valve structure and function before and after bypass is critical. The choice of valve for aortic replacement is the same as described previously. In most situations, however, bioprosthetic valves should be considered, especially if the mitral valve is to be repaired.

Under almost all circumstances in which anatomical abnormalities of the mitral valve are detected, or in which mitral insufficiency is severe, mitral valve repair should be considered. Annuloplasty remodeling may be all that is required

if the mitral insufficiency results from annular dilatation and the insufficiency is symmetric and central. More complex disease may require more extensive repair, or even replacement of the mitral valve. When the decision is made not to operate on the mitral valve, TEE is done to assess residual mitral valve dysfunction following AVR and coronary artery bypass surgery. If moderate or severe mitral regurgitation remains, the valve should be repaired or replaced. This is technically more difficult after the aortic valve has been replaced, because the prosthesis in the aortic position hinders exposure of the mitral valve. Therefore, every effort must be made to assess mitral valvular morphology and function before starting cardiopulmonary bypass, and preferably prior to the induction of anesthesia.

As in the other entities described, distal graft anastomoses are performed first (Fig. 45-6). After these grafts are completed, the aorta is opened and the aortic valve is resected with appropriate annular debridement. Replacement of the aortic valve, however, is deferred until after the mitral valve operation because sutures used for mitral valve repair or replacement may become disrupted during later debridement of the aortic valve annulus. After resection of the aortic valve, the atrium is opened and the mitral operation is performed. The atrium is closed with a vent across the mitral valve. The aortic valve is then replaced and the aorta is closed. The internal mammary artery graft is done last. Proximal graft anastomoses can be done with the aortic cross-clamp in place. It is conceivable that at some point in the future high risk patients with this combination of lesions may undergo catheter-based coronary revascularization, catheter-based AVR, and catheterbased mitral valve repair particularly in high-risk patients.<sup>77,78</sup>

As noted, this group of patients may have preserved ventricular function, and weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass is often straightforward. Inotropic drugs and intraaortic balloon counter pulsation are used as indicated.

#### Results

Early hospital mortality is 12 to 16%<sup>77,81</sup> Not surprisingly, predictors of early death include severe mitral regurgitation, lower ejection fraction with more severe symptoms of heart failure, and the presence of severe triple-vessel CAD. Late survival is approximately 60% at 72 months. Multivariate predictors of late mortality include advanced symptoms of heart failure and increased severity of mitral insufficiency.

# AORTIC AND MITRAL REGURGITATION AND CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE

Relatively few patients have insufficiency of both the aortic and mitral valves combined with CAD. Those patients who do usually have rheumatic heart disease and present early in the course of the valvular heart disease. Aortic regurgitation may be the predominant valve pathology in a patient with simultaneous significant CAD. The mitral valve pathology

may be secondary to left ventricular dilatation from the aortic lesion and/or from ischemia resulting from the coronary obstructions. Morphologic mitral valve disease may not be present. Because of the interaction of the valve and coronary pathologies, assessment of left ventricular contractility may be difficult for the reason that both preload and afterload are altered. In addition, the presence of reversible ischemia may obscure accurate measurement of ventricular function and reserve. Therefore, assessment of myocardial viability in these patients is often important.

### Clinical Presentation

Most patients with this combination of cardiac lesions present with congestive heart failure. It is unusual to see a patient who has significant insufficiency of both the aortic and mitral valves present with angina as the primary symptom. Typical murmurs of aortic and mitral insufficiency are present, and the patient may have other signs of chronic congestive heart failure, including rales and peripheral edema. If myocardial infarction is a significant component of the pathophysiology and presentation of the disease, evidence of it may be seen on electrocardiogram and echocardiogram. On echocardiography, patients may have regional wall motion abnormalities if infarction has occurred, as well as global ventricular dilatation and dysfunction from the combined valvular lesions and/ or diffuse CAD. Cardiac catheterization defines the coronary anatomy and helps to assess the severity of the valvular insufficiency and ventricular dysfunction. Accurate assessment of true left ventricular function is difficult in this entity. Mitral insufficiency may abnormally inflate visual measurements of ejection fraction because the ventricle can eject into the lowpressure pulmonary venous circuit. The misleading ejection fraction, with increased preload volumes due to insufficient aortic and mitral valves, when combined with the potential contribution of dysfunctional ischemic myocardium, make it very difficult to get an accurate estimation of preoperative left ventricular function. Thallium or PET scans may be useful to assess areas of dysfunctional myocardium that may be viable. Transesophageal ECHO may be extremely helpful, with special attention to left ventricular dimensions and bi-valvular anatomy.

### Pathophysiology

Symptoms and signs of left ventricular failure develop as the left ventricle dilates. In patients with rheumatic disease with both valves intrinsically damaged, ischemic disease may be minimal. In the setting of patients with aortic regurgitation and significant ischemia, mitral regurgitation is more likely to be secondary to both of these processes, and valve repair should be possible. Correction of aortic regurgitation reduces preload, whereas correction of mitral insufficiency increases afterload. The chronically dilated myopathic ventricle may not have sufficient reserves to maintain adequate output under these circumstances. Higher postoperative preload may need to be maintained while afterload is reduced. Any

additional contractility as a result of revascularization should improve output further. However, because of the multiple, uncontrollable variables that inhibit preoperative assessment of ventricular function, prediction of expected improvement after this operation is difficult.

This consideration is extremely important, since patients with severe and irreversible ischemic myocardial disease and poor ventricular function will not do well with operative treatment. Therefore, preoperative assessments of myocardial viability and reversible ischemia are critical. It is also important to assess whether organic mitral valve disease is present. The best results in these patients are in those in whom no mitral operation, or at most annuloplasty, is required.

### **OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT**

Details of the operative technique are similar to those described previously. Because of the presence of aortic insufficiency, retrograde cardioplegia must be used in conjunction with handheld ostial cannulas to deliver cardioplegia antegrade. For the reasons enunciated, excellent myocardial protection is important in these patients. TEE is required in the operating room for the assessment of mitral valve function. Residual 1+ to 2+ mitral regurgitation may be acceptable in certain patients because relief of aortic regurgitation can be expected to reduce ventricular size, which may lead to improvement of mitral regurgitation as the ventricle remodels with time. Similarly, myocardial revascularization also may lead to ultimate improvement in ventricular and mitral valve function in those with mild mitral valve insufficiency.

In weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, afterload reduction is extremely important because of the large preoperative volume overload of the heart. Drugs that reduce ventricular afterload, including vasodilators and inotropic drugs such as milrinone, may be particularly appropriate. The intraaortic balloon pump may be needed and helpful in the perioperative care of these difficult patients.

### Results

Early hospital mortality in this group of patients may be high, and if myocardial failure is severe, overall mortality rates exceed the range already noted for double-valve and coronary artery surgery.<sup>23,79,81</sup> Important determinants of risk in these patients are the familiar ones. In several series, predictors of hospital death and late events included severe mitral regurgitation, lower ejection fraction, more severe symptoms of congestive heart failure, and severe triple-vessel CAD.<sup>80</sup>
