# Postoperative Care of Cardiac Surgery Patients

Farhang Yazdchi • James D. Rawn

Mortality and morbidity in cardiac surgery have continued to decline despite increases in patient age, comorbid conditions, and procedure complexity. Much of this success can be attributed to advances in critical care. This chapter will outline some strategies and principles of modern postoperative care.

### **CARDIOVASCULAR CARE**

# Hemodynamic Assessment

Assessment and optimization of hemodynamics is a principle focus of care following cardiac surgery. Appropriate management requires knowledge of preoperative cardiac function and an appreciation of the impact of intraoperative events. The goal of postoperative hemodynamic management is the maintenance of adequate oxygen delivery to vital tissues in a way that avoids unnecessary demands on a heart recovering from the stress of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), ischemia, and surgery.

A basic initial hemodynamic assessment includes a review of current medications, heart rate and rhythm, mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP), and an ECG analysis to exclude ischemia and conduction abnormalities. The presence of a pulmonary artery catheter enables the measurement of pulmonary artery pressures, left-sided filling pressures (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP)), and mixed venous oxygen saturation (MVO<sub>2</sub>). Cardiac output (CO), as well as pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances (SVRs) can also be calculated when a PA catheter is present. CO is determined utilizing thermodilution or by using the Fick equation. CO, blood pressure (BP), and SVR are related to each other using Ohm's law (Table 17-1). Reasonable minimum goals for most patients include an MVO of about 60%, MAP > 65 mm Hg, and a cardiac index (CI) > 2 L/min/m<sup>2</sup>. Goals should be individualized. Patients with a history of hypertension or significant peripheral vascular disease will benefit from higher BP; patients who are bleeding or who have suture lines in fragile tissue are best served with tighter control. Strategies designed to produce a supra-normal CI or MVO, have failed to demonstrate a survival advantage.<sup>1</sup>

Failure to achieve adequate CO and end-organ oxygen delivery can be caused by many co-dependent factors. These include volume status (preload), peripheral vascular tone (afterload), cardiac pump function, heart rate and rhythm, and blood oxygen carrying capacity.

Volume status can be estimated using invasive monitoring. CVP, unless it is very low, is an unreliable indicator of left ventricular end-diastolic volume. An elevated CVP can be seen in volume overload, right heart failure, tricuspid and mitral regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, cardiac tamponade, tension pneumothorax, and pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary artery diastolic pressure correlates with left-sided filling pressures when pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is normal (low). PCWP (or left atrial pressure if this is being directly measured) provides the most accurate assessment of left-sided filling pressures in the absence of significant mitral stenosis, and its correlation with pulmonary artery diastolic pressure should be noted to enable a more continuous assessment of left-sided pressures. Determination of optimum filling pressures is generally empiric. A wedge pressure of 15 mm Hg is generally adequate, but many patients can require higher pressures. Most patients arrive from the operating room with a significant net fluid gain, but much of this excess volume is extravascular due to third space and pleural cavity accumulation. Consequently, many patients are intravascularly underfilled and have on going volume requirements in the immediate postoperative period. Postoperative vasoplegia is common. Contributors include a systemic inflammatory response to CPB and the stress of surgery in addition to preoperative and perioperative medications including ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and sedatives. Urine output and bleeding are common sources of ongoing fluid loss. Hypothermia promotes vasoconstriction. As patients rewarm, changes in peripheral vascular tone contribute to labile hemodynamics which are often best treated with volume replacement.

Peripheral vascular tone needs to be sufficient to provide the patient with adequate BP; excess vasoconstriction can increase SVR and create dangerous levels of hypertension and decreased CO. Increases in afterload can be caused by medications, hypothermia, increased sympathetic output

(including pain and anxiety) or may be secondary to hypovolemia or pump failure.

Left ventricular pump function can be influenced by levels of exogenous or endogenous inotropes, postoperative ischemic stunning or infarction, valve function, acidosis, electrolyte abnormalities, hypoxia or cardiac tamponade. Bradycardia, arrhythmias, and conduction defects can also adversely affect CO.

The oxygen carrying capacity of blood is a function of hematocrit and oxygenation. A hematocrit of 21% and oxygen saturation greater than 90% is adequate for a stable postoperative patient.

It is important not to allow the evaluation of the patient to become obscured by too many numbers or theories, and an overall assessment of the patient is always more important than any single parameter. Trends in hemodynamic parameters are usually more important than isolated values. Patients generally do well if they have warm, well-perfused extremities, a normal mental status and good urine output (>0.5 cc/kg/min). Acute changes in hemodynamic status are common postoperatively, and vigilant monitoring should enable care to be more preemptive than reactive.

# Hemodynamic Management

#### **FLUID MANAGEMENT**

As emphasized previously, the goal of postoperative hemodynamic management is the maintenance of adequate end-organ perfusion without taxing the heart unnecessarily. Assessment and optimization of intravascular volume status are generally the first steps in this process. Most patients have ongoing fluid requirements in the immediate postoperative period that can be caused by persistent third spacing, warming, diuresis, vasodilation, and bleeding. Careful monitoring of fluid balance and filling pressures should guide volume resuscitation. Starling curves are highly variable; it is helpful to correlate CO and MVO,

with changes in volume status. Patients with ventricular hypertrophy (eg, those with a history of hypertension or aortic stenosis) diastolic dysfunction or systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve usually need higher filling pressures. Patients with persistently low filling pressures despite aggressive fluid administration are usually either bleeding or vasodilated. Calculation of CO and SVR can often help sort this out. Monitoring devices that measure respiratory variation in the pulse arterial waveform have been shown to successfully predict the ability to improve CO with volume administration. In the case of significant vasodilation, judicious use of a pressor agent can help to decrease fluid requirements. Inotropic agents should not be administered for the treatment of hypovolemia. Fluid requirements can often be reduced following extubation; as decreased intrathoracic pressures will improve venous

The choice of an optimal resuscitation fluid has been controversial. In the acute setting, colloid infusions achieve comparable hemodynamic effects with less volume when compared to crystalloid solutions. After one hour, 80% of 1000 cc of 5% albumin solution is retained intravascularly. In situations characterized by loss of vascular endothelial integrity (ie, following CPB) albumin will redistribute into the interstitial space and increase third space fluid accumulation. One study has shown that the accumulation of extravascular pulmonary water is unaffected by the prime type or the type of fluid administered postoperatively.<sup>2</sup> The largest prospective randomized controlled study comparing colloid to crystalloid has been unable to demonstrate a difference in outcomes, although a subsequent subgroup analysis found increased mortality in patients who suffered brain injury who were randomized to receive colloid.3 Albumin and hetastarch provide comparable hemodynamic benefits, although hetastarch should be avoided in bleeding or coagulopathic patients or in those with renal impairment.

Although unusual in the immediate postoperative period, volume overload is a common problem in the days following surgery. If patients have normal cardiac function they often diuresis appropriately without intervention. Conversely, volume overload is a common cause of postoperative heart failure. Diuretics and vasodilators are frequently required in patients with impaired pump function before or following surgery, or in those who receive large volumes of fluid perioperatively. Patients with impaired renal function may require renal replacement therapy (ultrafiltration, continuous veno-venous hemofiltration, or hemodialysis) to become euvolemic. Rapid diuresis accompanied by inadequate electrolyte repletion is frequently arrhythmogenic.

#### PHARMACOLOGIC SUPPORT

Medications are used perioperatively to provide vasoconstriction, venous and arterial vasodilation, inotropic support and treatment of arrhythmias. As summarized in Table 17-2, many of the medications commonly used have multiple actions. Selection of appropriate agents depends on accurate hemodynamic assessment.

Pressors are indicated for vasodilated patients who have normal pump function and are unresponsive to volume. These agents include  $\alpha$ -agents (neosynephrine) and vasopressin. Methylene blue has demonstrated efficacy in vasopressorresistant hypotension. Pressors can contribute to peripheral ischemia and vasospasm of coronary arteries and arterial conduits. Careful monitoring of extremity perfusion and

electrocardiographic changes is required when using these agents.

Vasodilators are indicated for hypertensive patients and for patients who are normotensive with poor pump function. Nitroglycerin and sodium nitroprusside are commonly used in the immediate postoperative period. Both have the advantage of being short acting and easy to titrate. Both can cause hypoxia by inhibiting pulmonary arterial hypoxic vasoconstriction and increasing blood flow through poorly oxygenated lung. Nitroglycerin is a stronger venodilator than an arterial dilator, and

can increase intercoronary collateral blood flow, but patients can quickly become tachyphylactic. Prolonged nitroprusside use can lead to cyanide toxicity, and methemaglobin levels must be monitored. Nicardipine is a calcium channel blocker with minimal effects on contractility or atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction; it appears to have the efficacy of nipride without its toxicity. Nicardipine has been shown to control BP with less variability than nitroglycerine or nitroprusside and this has been found to correlate with improved outcomes. Nesiritide, or brain naturetic peptide, promotes diuresis in addition

to vasodilation and may have beneficial lusitropic effects in patients with diastolic dysfunction.

Hypertension can also be treated with beta blockers. These agents work by decreasing heart rate and contractility. Esmolol is useful in the presence of labile BP because of its short half-life. Labetolol combines beta and alpha adrenergic blockade. Patients whose pump function is inotrope dependent should not receive beta blockers.

Inotropic agents are indicated when low CO persists despite optimization of fluid status (preload), vascular tone (afterload), and heart rate and rhythm. These agents include beta adrenergic agents (dobutamine) and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibitors (milrinone). Both of these agents increase CO by increasing myocardial contractility and by reducing afterload through peripheral vasodilation. Dobutamine is shorter acting and easier to titrate; milrinone achieves increases in CO with lower myocardial oxygen consumption. Both are arrhythmogenic and can exacerbate coronary ischemia. Both epinephrine and norepinephrine combine  $\beta$  and  $\alpha$  adrenergic agonist effects; they are pressors in addition to positive inotropes. Relative  $\alpha$  effects increase with dose. Dopamine in low doses causes splanchnic and renal vasodilation;  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$  effects dominate at higher doses. Since perioperative beta blockade has been shown to improve mortality and morbidity following cardiac surgery, it seems reasonable to avoid the gratuitous use of inotropes, and efforts should be made to rapidly wean these agents when they are no longer required.

# Heart Rate and Rhythm Management

Deviations from normal sinus rhythm can cause significant clinical deterioration and optimization of heart rate and rhythm is frequently an effective way to improve hemodynamic status.

#### PACING (SEE TABLE 17-2)

Within normal rate ranges, CO increases linearly with heart rate, and pacing is often very helpful. However, it is important to carefully monitor the response to pacing. For example, sinus bradycardia is often more effective than ventricular pacing at a more normal rate. Ventricular pacing can cause ventricular dysfunction and dys-synchrony and the loss of consistent filling from atrial contraction; ventricular pacing is often useful in acutely decreasing BP while waiting to initiate a vasodilator. If possible atrial pacing is preferred to AV pacing which is preferred to ventricular pacing. Pacing too rapidly can adversely affect cardiac performance by decreasing filling time, exacerbating ischemia or inducing heart block. Ensure that pacemakers in patients undergoing ventricular pacing can sense appropriately in order to avoid R on T and subsequent ventricular fibrillation. Internal pacemakers can often be reprogramed to improve output.

Heart block can occur following aortic, mitral and tricuspid valve surgery. It is also associated with inferior myocardial infarction and can be secondary to medications (eg, digoxin, amiodarone, calcium channel blockers, and beta blockers). If a bi-atrial trans-septal approach to the mitral valve is

employed, sinus rhythm can be lost due to the division of the sinoatrial node. Heart block is frequently transient. If the ventricular escape rate is absent or insufficient, pacing wire thresholds need to be carefully monitored and backup pacing methods employed (by transvenous wire, pacing pulmonary artery catheter, or external pacing pads) if needed while waiting for placement of a permanent pacemaker.

#### **VENTRICULAR ARRHYTHMIAS**

Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) is common following cardiac surgery and typically a reflection of perioperative ischemia/reperfusion injury, electrolyte abnormalities (typically hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia) or an increase in exogenous or endogenous sympathetic stimulation. Generally, nonsustained VT is more important as a symptom of an underlying cause requiring diagnosis and correction than as a cause of hemodynamic instability.

Sustained VT persisting for more than 30 seconds or associated with significant hemodynamic compromise, requires more aggressive treatment. Ongoing ischemia should be ruled out (coronary angiography may be necessary), electrolytes should be replaced and inotropes should be minimized. Beta blockers, amiodarone, and lidocaine can be useful therapies. Electrocardioversion should be employed if sustained VT causes significant compromise.

#### ATRIAL FIBRILLATION AND FLUTTER

Background. The incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) following cardiothoracic surgery is 30 to 50%,<sup>5</sup> and has been shown to be higher in the elderly and patients with renal impairment or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).<sup>6</sup> This is associated with an increased risk of stroke, longer hospitalization, higher cost, and greater risk of long-term mortality.<sup>7</sup>

Prophylaxis. The incidence of POAF is 20 to 40% in coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) patients but it is generally more common in patients undergoing valve and combined procedures. POAF is typically a transient phenomenon. Use of beta blockers for the prevention of POAF is supported by the highest level of evidence. Therefore, beta blockers should be started or resumed as soon as they can be safely tolerated following cardiac surgery. Inotropic support, hemodynamic compromise, and AV block (PR interval > 0.24 ms, second or third degree block) are contraindications. Beta blockers appear to provide more effective prophylaxis when they are dosed with high frequency and titrated to produce an effect on heart rate and BP. Sotalol and amiodarone are also effective for prophylaxis but not superior. Sotalol, like other type II agents, can promote ventricular arrhythmias. Beta blockers also confer benefits other than atrial fibrillation prophylaxis, are easy to titrate, and do not have the toxicities associated with amiodarone. The postinflammatory milieu following cardiothoracic surgery may contribute to the pathogenesis of postoperative arrhythmias. For example, IL6 and C-reactive protein elevation postoperatively and atrial fibrillation (AF)

have been linked. In the only randomized clinical trial in this arena atorvastatin started 7 days before cardiac surgery was associated with a >60% reduction in the incidence of post-operative AF among 200 patients undergoing CABG surgery. However, the high AF rate (~60%) in the control group of this study was not representative of the experience at most centers; this may reflect the fact that beta blockers were not administered routinely after surgery.

Treatment. There are many treatment strategies for the management of atrial fibrillation. We have developed the guidelines outlined in Table 17-1. The principle premise of this strategy is the recognition that for most patients with new onset atrial fibrillation, the arrhythmia is well tolerated and self-limited (90% of patients are in sinus rhythm within 6 to 8 weeks independent of treatment approach). The pursuit of a rate control and anticoagulation strategy typically produces outcomes

comparable to a rhythm control strategy. Our prophylactic regimen begins with metoprolol 12.5 to 25 mg orally (po) four times a day and is titrated upward as tolerated.

#### STRATEGY FOR THE TREATMENT OF POSTOPERA-TIVE ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (FIG. 17-1)

- **A. Initial assessment:** The management of atrial fibrillation should be guided by the answers to the following three questions:
  - 1. Is the patient symptomatic? Atrial fibrillation is generally well tolerated, and over aggressive management can cause significant morbidity. Nonetheless, the first step in the management of atrial fibrillation is an assessment of its hemodynamic significance. Significant symptoms may respond to rate control alone or may require chemical or electrical cardioversion. Evidence

- of compromise includes hypotension, changes in mental status, decreased urine output, impaired peripheral perfusion, symptoms of coronary ischemia, and decreased CO or increased filling pressures.
- 2. What are the precipitating factors? Appropriate management of atrial fibrillation requires identification and treatment of potential risk factors. Atrial fibrillation can result from ischemia, atrial distension, increased sympathetic tone, electrolyte imbalances (particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia precipitated by diuresis), acid-base disturbances (particularly alkalosis), sympathomimetic medications (inotropes, bronchodilators), beta blocker withdrawal, pneumonia, atelectasis, and pulmonary embolism.
- 3. What are the goals of therapy? Hemodynamic stability is the primary goal. For most patients, rate control is sufficient since 90% of patients with new onset atrial fibrillation following cardiac surgery will be in normal sinus rhythm within 6 weeks. In long-term studies of patients with chronic atrial fibrillation it has been difficult to show a benefit from rhythm control strategies. Optimal target heart rates depend on many patient-specific factors. A randomized study comparing strict control (heart rate less than 80) to lenient control (heart rate less than 110) in permanent atrial fibrillation found fewer adverse events in the lenient control group. Evidence of hemodynamic compromise or interference with recovery should prompt chemical or electrical cardioversion.
- **B. Drug therapy:** Agents can be conveniently divided into rate control and rhythm control agents, although beta blockers are also effective in converting atrial fibrillation postoperatively. Mono drug therapy is generally better than poly drug therapy.

#### Rate control agents

- 1. Beta blockers. Metoprolol should be first line therapy in most patients and can be given orally or intravenously. Metoprolol should be titrated to effect with a heart rate goal typically less than 110 beats/minute at rest. The suggested treatment for new onset atrial fibrillation is 50 mg po. followed by 25 mg po every 2 to 3 hours until NSR or adequate rate control is achieved. Some patients may require oral doses over 400 mg/day.
- **2. Calcium channel blockers.** Diltiazem is the agent of choice. It can be given orally starting at 30 mg po three time a day. It can also be initiated as a bolus of 0.25 mg/kg IV, followed by 0.35 mg/kg IV, followed by a continuous infusion at 5 to 15 mg/h.
- 3. Digoxin can be considered in patients with contraindications to beta blockers, in particular those with poor ejection fraction. There is evidence that it increases atrial automaticity. It has a half-life of 38 to 48 hours in patients with normal renal function, significant potential toxicity, and a narrow therapeutic range. Levels must be monitored, particularly in patients with renal insufficiency. Many agents, including amiodarone, increase its serum level.

#### **Antiarrythmics**

- 1. Metoprolol
- **2. Ibutilide.** Ibutilide is given as a 1-mg intravenous bolus and repeated once if cardioversion fails to occur. Patients need to be monitored for a small but significant incidence of torsade de pointes which may be increased if given in conjunction with amiodarone.
- **3. Amiodarone** can cause myocardial depression, heart block, and acute pulmonary toxicity; significant hypotension is most commonly associated with rapid bolus infusion. Significant toxicity is associated with prolonged use of amiodarone, and consideration should be given to discontinuing the drug within six weeks of surgery.
- **4. Adenosine** is helpful in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia. (It should be avoided in transplant recipients, partially revascularized patients and in patients with atrial flutter).
- **5. Dronedarone.** Dronedarone is an amiodarone analog without iodine moiety in its structure, and is similar to amiodarone with regard to its structural and electrophysiological properties.<sup>10</sup> It has been associated with increased mortality in patients with severely depressed left ventricular function.<sup>11,12</sup> It appears to be less toxic but also less effective than amiodarone.<sup>13</sup>
- C. Electrical cardioversion: Electrical cardioversion should be used emergently for the treatment of hemodynamically unstable atrial fibrillation. Synchronous cardioversion rather than defibrillation should be utilized to minimize the risk of precipitating ventricular fibrillation. Sedation should be used. In patients with atrial wires who are in atrial flutter, overdrive pacing can be attempted.
- D. Anticoagulation: Patients who remain in atrial fibrillation for >24 hours or have multiple sustained episodes over this period should be started on coumadin in the absence of contraindications. Heparin (unfractionated IV or low molecular weight SQ) should be considered after 48 hours, particularly in patients with a history of stroke or TIAs or who have a low ejection fraction. Coumadin can be initiated in patients who may require permanent pacer placement as pacemakers can generally be safely placed with INR < 2. Postprocedure heparin bridging has been associated with significant rates of pocket hematoma formation.

# Postoperative Ischemia and Infarction

Postoperative ischemia and infarction can be caused by inadequate intraoperative myocardial protection, kinked, spasmed or thrombosed conduits, thrombosed endarterectomized vessels, or embolization by air or atherosclerotic debris. It should be suspected in the presence of otherwise unexplained poor pump function, ST changes, new bundle branch block or complete heart block, ventricular arrhythmias or enzyme elevation. Electrocardiographic changes should be correlated with the anatomy of known atherosclerotic or revascularized territories. Air embolism preferentially involves the right coronary artery and inferior ST changes are generally present in the operating room. It typically resolves within hours. It is worth noting that nonspecific ST changes are common postoperatively and usually benign. Pericardial changes are generally characterized by diffuse concave ST elevations, accompanied by a pericardial rub and delayed in onset by at least 12 hours following surgery.

New wall motion abnormalities or mitral regurgitation diagnosed echocardiographically can help determine the hemodynamic significance of suspected ischemia or infarction. Knowledge of the quality of conduits, anastamoses, and target vessels is critical in planning management strategy (eg, there may be little to be gained and much to lose in attempting to improve flow to a small, highly diseased posterior descending artery with poor run-off). On the other hand, if significant myocardium appears at risk a timely trip to the operating room or the cardiac catheterization laboratory can dramatically improve outcomes. Ongoing ischemia should prompt consideration of standard treatment strategies including anticoagulation, beta blockade, and nitroglycerin as tolerated. Intra-aortic balloon pump placement should be considered to minimize inotrope requirements, decrease myocardial oxygen requirements and minimize infarct size.

# Right Ventricular Failure and Pulmonary Hypertension

Right ventricular failure can be a particularly difficult postoperative problem. It can be caused by perioperative ischemia or infarction or by acute increases in PVR. Preexisting pulmonary hypertension is commonly caused by left-sided heart failure, aortic stenosis, mitral valve disease, and pulmonary disease. Chronic pulmonary hypertension is characterized by abnormal increased vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling.<sup>14</sup> Acute increases in PVR are commonly caused by acute left ventricular dysfunction, mitral valve insufficiency or stenosis, volume overload, pulmonary edema, atelectasis, hypoxia, or acidosis. Pulmonary embolism should also be considered, but it is rare in the immediate postoperative period. As the right heart fails it becomes distended, CVP increases, tricuspid regurgitation may develop, and pulmonary artery pressures and left-sided filling pressures become inadequate. Strategies for reversing this potentially fatal process begin with identifying potentially reversible etiologies. Volume status and left-sided function should be optimized. The RV has its own starling curve, and while the failing right ventricle (RV) often needs more volume to ensure adequate left-sided filling, overdistension will worsen function. Judicious use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to recruit atelectatic lung and hyperventilation can decrease the impact of pulmonary vasoconstriction mediated by hypoxia and hypercapnia. Use of intravenous vasodilators to reduce PVR is frequently limited by systemic hypotension. Inotropes (typically milrinone which also provides vasodilation) can be beneficial. Vasopressin, unlike other pressors, appears to increase SVR more than PVR.  $^{15}$  Since no intravenous vasodilator is selective for the pulmonary vasculature, topical administration can be significantly more effective in reducing PVR without causing systemic hypotension. Inhaled NO and PGI $_2$  have comparable efficacy. They can also improve oxygenation by shunting blood to ventilated lung.

# Valve Diseases: Special Postoperative Considerations

#### **AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT**

The different pathophysiologies associated with aortic stenosis (primarily a pressure overload phenomenon) versus aortic insufficiency (volume overload) can result in significantly different postoperative courses.

Aortic Stenosis. Aortic stenosis can lead to the development of a hypertrophied, noncompliant left ventricle (LV). For some patients, replacement of a stenotic valve allows a ventricle conditioned to pumping against abnormally high afterload to easily achieve supranormal levels of CO and BP postoperatively. Meticulous BP control is frequently required to avoid disrupting fresh suture lines. In some patients, the degree of ventricular hypertrophy can lead to dynamic outflow obstruction; the condition is most effectively treated with volume, beta blockers, and afterload augmentation. Even without dynamic outflow obstruction, reduced compliance (diastolic dysfunction) can create significant hemodynamic compromise if the patient becomes hypovolemic or loses normal sinus rhythm (up to 30% of stroke volume can be dependent on synchrony between atria and ventricles). The placement of atrial wires in addition to ventricular wires can provide significant advantages in the event that the patient is bradycardic or experiences heart block postoperatively.

Aortic Regurgitation. The LV in a patient with aortic regurgitation is frequently dilated without significant hypertrophy and often functions poorly postoperatively. Optimization of volume, afterload, inotropy, and rhythm in these patients is often challenging.

#### MITRAL VALVE REPAIR/REPLACEMENT

Mitral Regurgitation. Following repair or replacement of an incompetent mitral valve, increased afterload and consequent greater wall stress unmask LV dysfunction. Frequently inotropic support and systemic vasodilation is required to reduce the afterload mismatch seen following surgery. Occasionally LV dysfunction can be the result of inadvertent suture placement compromising the circumflex coronary artery.

Mitral Stenosis. Unlike patients with mitral regurgitation, patients with mitral stenosis typically have preserved LV function. Exacerbation of preexisting pulmonary hypertension is common, however. Postoperative strategies focus

on optimizing right ventricular function and decreasing PVR.

## Cardiac Arrest and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation

The incidence of cardiac arrest following cardiac surgery ranges between 0.7% and 2.9%. These patients represent a special case for application of advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) algorithms. The majority of these events happen in the immediate postoperative period when many patients are still intubated and monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU). In addition to ventricular arrhythmias, common etiologies for arrest in these patients include readily reversible causes: hypovolemia from hemorrhage, cardiac tamponade, acute hypoxia, electrolyte abnormalities, tension pneumothorax, pacing failure, and myocardial ischemia. Many of these patients develop clinical deterioration prior to the arrest which can provide clues to the mechanism of the arrest and guide therapy. Early recognition in a critical care environment, the presence of trained clinicians, patientspecific knowledge, and reversible etiologies combine to produce outcomes that are significantly better when compared to outcomes in the broader population of patients experiencing arrest. Cardiac surgery patients undergoing resuscitation in the 24 hours following surgery have survival rates up to 70%. 16,17

The most important factors contributing to survival following cardiac arrest are prompt defibrillation and immediate, high quality, and uninterrupted chest compressions. There are special circumstances in cardiac surgery patients when chest compressions may be deferred. The European Resuscitation Council has recommended three successive (stacked) shocks for ventricular fibrillation or pulseless VT occurring in immediate postoperative cardiac surgery patients prior to chest compressions if defibrillation is immediately available. <sup>18</sup> Minutes matter<sup>19</sup> and patients at high risk for arrhythmias should have defibrillator pads placed postoperatively. Because chest compressions in the immediate postoperative period can cause myocardial injury, sternal and rib fractures, bypass graft injury, prosthetic valve dehiscence, lung injury, and hemorrhage,<sup>20</sup> it would be preferable to avoid compressions if return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) can be achieved with electrical cardioversion. For asystole or severe bradycardia, pacing wires should be utilized when available prior to initiating chest compressions. Adding a ground wire in the skin can sometimes improve the capture of poorly functioning temporary pacing wires. Patients with pulseless electrical activity may respond to volume administration or pressor administration; if these interventions are ineffective, chest compressions should be initiated. Finally, if tamponade is suspected and emergency resternotomy is immediately available in the ICU, it is reasonable to minimize chest compressions and open the chest.

The efficacy of chest compressions can be monitored with preexisting arterial lines or with end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (ETCO<sub>2</sub>) monitoring (quantitative waveform capnography). These techniques can also minimize interruption of

chest compressions and help to identify ROSC. Systolic pressures close to 80 mm Hg or  $ETCO_2 > 10$  mm Hg is considered to reflect adequate CPR.  $ETCO_2 > 40$  is associated with ROSC.

If patients are not ventilated, intubation should be deferred and mask ventilation utilized until experienced personnel are available. Chest compressions should be interrupted only to insert the endotracheal tube through the vocal cords once visualized. Postoperative cardiac surgery patients are often very sensitive to increases in intrathoracic pressure and respiratory rates should be approximately 10 breaths per minute and minimal tidal volumes should be used.

Use of epinephrine should be limited and not follow standard algorithms in the resuscitation of cardiac surgery patients because of the potential for hypertension leading to suture line disruption and hemorrhage. Smaller doses may be cautiously titrated to effect. Amiodarone (300 mg IV) should be considered for persistent ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia resistant to electrical cardioversion.

Chest tubes should be placed in the mid-clavicular line in the second intercostal space if tension pneumothorax is suspected. Resternotomy should be considered if resuscitative efforts have failed to achieve ROSC within 5 to 10 minutes, particularly if tamponade is suspected. Ultrasonography can suggest, but not rule out, cardiac tamponade. Upon opening the chest, internal cardiac massage can be initiated. Clot should be evacuated, sources of bleeding identified, and bypass graft patency can be assessed.

Effective teamwork is a critical component of effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation. A call for additional help should be made if personnel resources are suboptimal. A team leader needs to be identified to manage the effort. If resources are adequate, the leader's role should be restricted to coordinating care. The leader should assign tasks after assessing a practitioner's competence to perform the assigned task. Communication should be closed loop; when team members are assigned a task they need to communicate that they understand the task and provide notification when they have completed it. The effective leader should rely on the collective knowledge of the team by actively soliciting information about the patient's condition prior to the arrest and exploring potential diagnoses and courses of action. As mentioned previously, ACLS algorithms were not developed for cardiac surgery patients specifically, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be performed with awareness of the special problems facing these patients postoperatively and with awareness of the specific circumstances of the patient. Knowledge of the patient's medical problems, operative details (including bleeding problems, hemodynamic instability coming off bypass, echocardiographic findings, and revascularization challenges) and postoperative course should guide strategy. Mobilization of personnel and equipment to open the chest should occur if resuscitation efforts are not immediately successful.

Training of practitioners in resuscitation is critical to optimization of outcomes. As important as knowing what to do in an emergency situation is to know how to do it. Mock

codes should focus on teamwork and effective leadership in addition to focusing on issues specific to cardiac surgery patients. Required equipment should be dedicated and readily available and all members of the team should know how to access it.

# BLEEDING, THROMBOSIS, AND TRANSFUSION STRATEGIES

One of the principle challenges of cardiac surgery is to achieve sufficient anticoagulation while supported on CPB without experiencing excessive bleeding postoperatively. Not surprisingly, patients undergoing off-pump CABG experience a significant reduction in postoperative bleeding and blood product transfusion requirements.<sup>21</sup> Excessive bleeding and its complications, including blood product transfusions, cause significant morbidity and mortality.

# **Preoperative Evaluation**

Preoperative evaluation includes documenting a history of abnormal bleeding or thrombosis, and obtaining basic coagulation studies, a hematocrit and platelet count. A history of recent heparin exposure associated with thrombocytopenia should suggest a diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Confirmation of the presence of IgG directed against platelet factor 4 (the prevalence of these antibodies in patients with previous heparin exposure can be up to 35%)<sup>22</sup> requires either a delay in surgery until the assay is negative (usually 3 months), or if surgery is more urgently required, alternative anticoagulation strategies (bivalirudin<sup>23</sup>) can be considered. Preoperative medications that can increase bleeding risk are common. Aspirin inhibits cyclooxygenase, reduces the synthesis of thromboxane-A<sub>2</sub>, and decreases platelet aggregation. Preoperative aspirin use modestly increases postoperative bleeding, but preoperative and early postoperative use (ie, within 6 hours) is beneficial to outcome and ultimate survival.<sup>24</sup> Other antiplatelet agents have more profound impacts on platelet function. The glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors eptifibatide (Integrillin) and tirofiban (Aggrastat) are sufficiently short acting that surgery can be safely conducted despite recent exposure. Abciximab (Reopro) usually requires a 24 to 48-hour delay of surgery, if feasible, to avoid catastrophic bleeding. Clopidogrel (Plavix), prasugrel (effient), and ticagrelor (brilinta) inhibit the P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> component of platelet ADP receptors preventing ADP platelet activation. Discontinuing these agents 5 to 7 days before surgery will minimize bleeding, but they are often continued closer to the time of surgery because the risk of mortality is high from acute coronary stent occlusion, particularly in patients with recently placed drug-eluting stents. Customarily, warfarin (which inhibits the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X) is discontinued 4 to 7 days preoperatively to allow gradual correction of the INR. Although patients undergoing an

interruption in warfarin administration frequently receive bridging anticoagulation with heparin, increasing evidence suggests that this strategy increases bleeding without preventing thromboembolism.<sup>25,26</sup>

Newer oral anticoagulant agents such as direct thrombin inhibitors Dabigatran (Pradaxa) and direct factor Xa inhibitors including Rivaroxaban (Xarelto), Apixaban (Eliquis), and Edoxaban (Lixiana, Savaysa) have been developed recently. The long-term efficacy and safety of these targetspecific oral anticoagulants are comparable with coumadin in specific applications. The half-life of these agents is shorter, making it easier to discontinue before elective cardiac surgery. Levels can be measured by thrombin time for Dabigatran and anti-factor Xa for Apixaban. However, reversal of anticoagulant effects of these agents in an urgent situation is challenging. Antifibrinolytic agents, DDAVP, prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs), oral activated charcoal, and hemodialysis are suggested, but there is no high-quality evidence supporting the efficacy of these interventions. There are no data to support use of rFVIIa, FFP, or cryoprecipitate for reversal.

Preoperative anemia in patients undergoing cardiac surgery is associated with increased morbidity and mortality <sup>27,28</sup> and increased rate of intraoperative and postoperative red blood cell transfusion. Therefore, identifying and treating reversible causes of anemia is advisable. Elective surgeries should be delayed when possible to allow optimization of preoperative hemoglobin levels with iron supplementation and vitamin B12.<sup>29</sup>Administration of erythropoietin has not been demonstrated to reduce the need for RBC transfusion and may actually contribute to adverse outcomes.<sup>30</sup> Efforts to reduce phlebotomy volumes and frequency can have a significant impact on the incidence of perioperative anemia.<sup>31</sup>

# Intraoperative Strategies

Multiple intraoperative strategies have evolved to prevent unnecessary bleeding and blood product transfusion. Antithrombolytics  $\Sigma$ -aminocaproic acid (Amicar) and Tranexamic acid (Cyclokapron) inhibit plasminogen activation and limit fibrinolysis. Topical use of tranexamic acid intraoperatively prior to closure has been shown to be a simple and effective way to reduce postoperative bleeding,  $^{32}$  particularly in patients with friable tissue undergoing reoperations or with previous exposure to chest irradiation.

Retrograde autologous priming of the CPB circuit involves displacing circuit prime at the initiation of CPB by draining the patient's blood both antegrade through the venous cannula and retrograde through the arterial cannula. This strategy has been shown to significantly decrease the requirement for blood transfusion following CABG. The use of heparin bonded circuitry has enabled the safe use of lower anticoagulation targets while on bypass. Careful attention to hemostasis intraoperatively and avoidance of excessive use of the cell saver (which depletes platelets and clotting factors) pays dividends postoperatively.

# Postoperative Bleeding

Most patients are mildly coagulopathic postoperatively, but only a minority bleeds excessively. Postoperative coagulopathy can be due to residual or rebound heparin effects following CPB, thrombocytopenia (qualitative and quantitative), clotting factor depletion, hypothermia, and hemodilution. Chest tube outputs persistently greater than 50 to 100 cc per hour or other clinical evidence of bleeding demand attention.

Strategies for avoiding postoperative hypothermia are also very important. Hypothermia ( $\leq 35^{\circ}$ C) on arrival to the ICU is associated with delayed extubation, shivering, and increased peripheral  $O_2$  consumption, hemodynamic instability, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, increased SVR, and coagulopathy.

The treatment of postoperative bleeding depends initially upon making a judgment: Is bleeding surgical, coagulopathic, or both? Surgical bleeding is treated as quickly as possible by reexploration while coagulopathies can be corrected in the ICU. Coagulopathic patients demonstrate microvascular bleeding (often bleeding from wound edges and puncture sites) and rarely have significant clot formation in their chest tubes. Standard maneuvers include warming the patient, controlling BP, increasing PEEP, infusing additional Σ-aminocaproic acid, calcium gluconate and blood products. In general, blood products should not be used to correct coagulation abnormalities unless the patient is bleeding significantly. All allogeneic blood products can contribute to transfusion-related lung injury and have other adverse effects. Protamine is rarely indicated and can increase bleeding. Desmopressin (DDAVP) is a synthetic vasopressin analog which acts by increasing the concentration of Von Willebrand factor, an important mediator of platelet adhesion. It is of benefit in patients with von Willebrand's disease and in patients with severe platelet dysfunction secondary to uremia. It is sometimes used for bleeding associated with anitplatelet agents, but there is little evidence to support this practice.

Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) is a drug approved for use in hemophiliacs that has been used successfully to stop bleeding in patients with life-threatening hemorrhage after cardiac surgery. In combination with tissue factor, it activates the extrinsic coagulation system via factor X, resulting in thrombin generation and prompt correction of the PT. It has a significant risk of systemic thrombosis and should be reserved for otherwise uncontrollable bleeding.<sup>34</sup>

Prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) are indicated for the urgent reversal of acquired coagulation factor deficiency induced by vitamin K antagonist (ie, warfarin) therapy in adult patients with acute major bleeding, and can reduce the need for FFP transfusion. PCCs have less risk of graft or prosthetic valve thrombosis when compared to factor VIIa.

# **Mediastinal Reexploration**

Reexploration should be considered when computed tomography (CT) outputs are >400 mL/h for 1 hour, >300 mL/h for 2 to 3 hours and 200 mL/h for 4 hours (Table 17-2)<sup>35</sup> or

if signs of tamponade or hemodynamic instability develop. Tamponade should be considered in the presence of hypotension, tachycardia, elevated filling pressures, increasing inotrope requirements, pulsus paradoxus, and/or equalization of right and left atrial pressures. An echocardiogram may be useful in this situation but cannot rule out tamponade. Chest X-rays (CXRs) are a necessary element of the evaluation for bleeding, look for widening of the mediastinum or evidence of hemothorax. CXRs should be repeated on all patients with initial high chest tube output that later subsides to ensure that chest tubes have not clotted.

## Autotransfusion

Autotransfusion of shed mediastinal blood remains controversial. It can be lifesaving in the presence of catastrophic bleeding. Red blood cell viability in unwashed shed mediastinal blood is comparable to that of autologous whole blood. Additionally, there is evidence indicating no apparent clinical coagulopathy (low fibrinogen levels, but normal coagulation times at 1 and 24 hours) following reinfusion of shed blood. This method of blood salvage is without allogeneic transfusion risks and has been shown to decrease transfusion requirements. Autotransfusion should be avoided in patients with infectious endocarditis, hematologic diseases such as sickle cell or hemolysis, or if exogenous chemicals such as hemostatic agents or topical antibiotics were used during the operation.

### **Blood Transfusion**

Recent guidelines<sup>39</sup> have highlighted the risks associated with blood transfusion and advocated restrictive transfusion strategies. The STS guidelines recommend transfusion for patients who have bled more than 30% of their blood volume or who are bleeding uncontrollably. In stable postoperative patients, it is recommended that transfusion be considered only if Hb falls below 7 g/dL (hematocrit < 21%). This recommendation is based, in large part, on the only significant randomized control trial examining the impact of transfusion strategies on outcome. The Canadian Critical Care Trials group found that patients randomized to a Hb target of 7 g/dL versus 10 g/dL had equivalent outcomes. Patients who were younger or less critically ill had a statistically significant improvement in survival if they received less blood. 40 Retrospective studies in cardiac surgery have shown a durable and dose-related association between transfusion and survival<sup>41</sup> (see Fig. 17-2). In addition, blood transfusion has been linked to an increase in postoperative infection, lung injury and prolonged intubation, myocardial ischemia and infarction, renal failure, stroke, and increased ICU length of stay, hospital length of stay, and overall cost. 42,43 A study examining patients undergoing cardiac surgery in the UK found that patients who received blood were more likely to experience death, infections, ischemic complications (myocardial infarction, stroke, and renal failure) and prolonged stays in the hospital.<sup>44</sup> The guidelines support transfusion above a Hb of 7 g/dL in patients with evidence of end-organ ischemia, but the evidence supporting

**FIGURE 17-2** Survival after isolated CABG stratified by number of RBC units transfused.

these recommendations rely almost entirely on expert consensus. In a well-designed propensity matched study, researchers compared Jehovah's witness patients (who refuse blood transfusion based on religious belief) with non-witness patients who received blood after cardiac surgery. Witnesses, who received no blood, had similar late survival compared with a matched group of cardiac surgical patients who received RBCs, and experienced fewer postoperative myocardial infarctions, a lower incidence of prolonged ventilation, less reoperation for bleeding, shorter ICU stays, and a lower hazard for in-hospital death.<sup>45</sup> They then compared witnesses with non-witnesses who did not receive blood and found comparable results. 46 There is little evidence supporting the belief that transfusion of stored, allogenic blood acutely improves oxygen carrying capacity. Stored blood is deficient in 2,3 DPG (and less capable of releasing oxygen to tissues) and nitric oxide; it also contains cells which are less flexible and may be more likely to occlude capillaries.

Blood transfusions have immunomodulating effects (by either alloimmunization or tolerance induction) that may increase the risk of nosocomial infections, transfusion-associated graft versus host disease, transfusion-related lung injury (TRALI), cancer recurrence, and the possible development of autoimmune diseases later in life. Furthermore, the risk of "newer" transfusion-transmitted diseases has become recognized. Proinflammatory mediators and cytokines have been associated with an increased risk of wound infection, sepsis, pulmonary and renal insufficiency.<sup>47</sup>

# Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an immunemedicated syndrome affecting up to 3% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. A complex of platelet factor 4 (released by activated platelets) and heparin stimulate the production of IgG antibodies (detected by an anti-PF4 assay) which cause vigorous platelet and monocyte activation and aggregation. This process results in platelet consumption and thrombin production causing in turn a drop in platelet count and systemic thrombotic complications. These can include microangiopathic thrombosis in the digits, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and end-organ injury including stroke, renal failure, and gut ischemia. Thrombocytopenia is typical following CPB and is secondary to hemodilution, platelet destruction and aggregation. The platelet count usually reaches its nadir by the first or second postoperative day followed be a steady recovery. A second drop in platelet count of more than 30 to 50% of the postoperative peak 5 to 14 days after cardiac surgery is strongly suspicious for HIT syndrome. More rarely, patients may develop HIT earlier (within the first four postoperative days) without the characteristic postoperative rebound in platelet count. It can also occur later (weeks after hospital discharge).<sup>48,49</sup>

Antiplatelet antibodies are more common than thrombotic complications in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The presence of anti-PF4 antibodies is detected utilizing an enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). The test is very sensitive (>95%) but has only a 75 to 85% specificity. A positive test occurs when optimal density (OD) values exceed 0.4. Some suggest the threshold of OD > 1 is associated with a higher likelihood of thrombotic events compared with OD values between 0.4 and 0.99. The diagnosis can be confirmed with a more specific functional assay, typically, a serotonin release assay.

Once suspected, all heparin products must be discontinued, heparin-coated lines must be removed, and a direct thrombin inhibitor (bivalirudin, lepirudin, or argatroban) can be initiated. Warfarin, because it inhibits the synthesis of protein C, should be avoided initially. Bivalirudin is often the preferred thrombin inhibitor because its administration typically does not elevate the INR significantly (when compared to argatroban) making the transition to subsequent warfarin administration less complicated. Platelet transfusions can exacerbate thrombosis and are not recommended. When diagnosis is confirmed anticoagulation therapy with thrombin inhibitors should be continued until recovery of the platelet count followed by a transition to warfarin. 51,52

#### **RESPIRATORY CARE**

# Postoperative Pulmonary Pathophysiology

Patients undergoing heart surgery experience a spectrum of pulmonary dysfunction following heart surgery. The lungs become atelectatic during bypass and become edematous as a result of fluid shifts and the inflammatory response provoked by the bypass circuit. Increases are seen in the A-a gradient and pulmonary shunt fraction with a resultant decrease in compliance and impaired oxygenation. Many inflammatory mediators have been implicated. Complement is activated (C3a,

C5b-C9) and can directly damage pulmonary endothelium as well as sequester neutrophils. When activated these neutrophils release oxygen free radicals and proteases furthering injury. Macrophage cytokine production and platelet degranulation has also been demonstrated in models of bypass-induced lung injury.<sup>53</sup> TRALI can also exacerbate lung dysfunction.

In spite of increased knowledge of the mechanisms of injury, pharmocologic interventions have not proved effective in preventing it. To the contrary, administration of methylprednisolone in a randomized double-blinded study significantly increased A-a gradient and shunt fraction, decreased both static and dynamic compliance and delayed early extubation in a dose-dependent manner.<sup>54</sup>

### Assessment on Arrival

On arrival to the intensive care unit, auscultation of the lungs should be performed to assure equal breath sounds and absence of bronchospasm. Ventilator settings should aim to minimize barotrauma and transition to a spontaneous ventilatory mode in a timely manner. A review of the initial postoperative CXR should confirm proper endotracheal tube position 2 to 3 cm above the carina, proper nasogastric tube, and intravenous line placement. Clinicians should be alert for pneumothoraces, hemothoraces, and a widened mediastinum. Arterial blood gas should confirm adequate oxygenation, and absence of hypercapnea or metabolic acidosis. Arterial blood gas results should be correlated with pulse oximetry, minute ventilation, and end tidal CO<sub>2</sub> measurements.

# Troubleshooting Hypoxia

As discussed above, oxygenation in all patients will be diminished compared to baseline. The inability to wean F.O. below 50% within the first few postoperative hours should prompt a reevaluation for treatable causes. Sometimes simply replacing the pulse oximeter probe onto another finger or an earlobe will improve reported oxygen saturation. This is particularly true in patients with peripheral vasoconstriction, and more frequent ABGs may be necessary for correlation. The use of vasodilators including nitroglycerin, milrinone, sodium nitroprusside, and nicardipine can increase shunt fraction (by inhibiting hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in poorly ventilated regions of the lung) enough to cause significant hypoxia. Increasing PEEP to improve alveolar recruitment is frequently beneficial.<sup>56</sup> Nebulizer treatments decrease bronchospasm, and repeat CXR may demonstrate pneumothorax, retained hemothorax, retained mediastinal hematoma, atelectasis, or a new infiltrate representing aspiration.

Atelectasis, particularly in the left lower lobe, is present to some degree in nearly all patients. Bibasilar atelectasis is believed to be the combined product of the prolonged supine position, and intraoperative muscle relaxation allowing upward displacement of abdominal contents and the diaphragm. This reduces functional reserve capacity by up to 1 L. On the left, this is compounded by pleurotomy for internal

mammary artery take-down, compression of the left lung and decreased ventilatory tidal volumes to clear the field for IMA dissection. Lobar atelectasis, especially when associated with mucus plugging, can be improved by bronchoscopic aspiration in up to 80% of cases. <sup>57</sup> A prospective study comparing bronchoscopy to aggressive chest physiotherapy found the two techniques to be equally effective, <sup>58</sup> but only if the chest physiotherapy regimen is adhered to.

#### **Sedation**

Sedation and pain relief in cardiac surgery "fast-tracking" relies on short-acting agents including propofol, fentanyl, and midazolam. Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective  $\alpha_2$ -adrenoreceptor agonist and has anxiolytic, sympatholytic, and analgesic effects without contributing to respiratory depression, oversedation, or delirium. It may provide myocardial protection, and has been shown to improve outcomes in cardiac surgery. Hypotension and bradycardia can complicate its use.

# Early Extubation

Stable patients with a normal mental status can often be extubated either in the operating room or within a few hours following arrival in the intensive care unit. Once an arterial blood gas has confirmed adequate oxygenation and ventilation, pulse oximetry and monitoring of minute ventilation or end tidal  $\mathrm{CO}_2$  can guide extubation, often without the need for subsequent blood gases.

Although hemodynamically unstable patients can improve following a reduction in airway pressures or extubation, a more cautious approach to early extubation should be taken in patients with preoperative pulmonary failure requiring intubation, uncompensated congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock (including a requirement for intra-aortic balloon counterpulsion), deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, persistent hypothermia < 35.5°C; persistent hypoxia  $P_aO_2$ : $F_iO_2$  < 200, persistent acidosis with pH < 7.30, persistent mediastinal bleeding, or cerebrovascular accident or reduced mental status (inability to follow commands or protect airway).

# Ventilator Weaning and Extubation

Prolonged mechanical ventilatory support is a source of significant morbididty and mortality. In general, every effort should be made to wean the patient from the ventilator. Minimizing barotrauma has been shown to improve outcomes both in patients with severe lung injury and in those with more normal lung function. Spontaneous ventilatory modes (pressure support) are typically better tolerated by patients and are associated with lower airway pressures. Most ventilated patients do not need to be unconscious. Oversedation can cause hypotension, delirium, and prolong intubation. Benzodiazepine infusions and prolonged propofol

administration should be avoided as these agents promote delirium and accumulate.

The decision to extubate must take into account the adequacy of oxygenation and ventilation on minimal ventilatory support as well as an estimate of the patient's ability to manage secretions and protect his or her airway.<sup>60</sup> Finally, an assessment of the patient's ability to perform the work of breathing needs to be made. For patients unable to wean from the vent immediately following surgery, a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) (30 minutes of spontaneous breathing with 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O of pressure support or unassisted breathing through a T-tube) has been shown to be the most accurate predictor of a successful extubation. Breathing trials are typically discontinued for signs of distress such as respiratory frequency > 35/min, O, saturation < 90%, HR > 140 bpm, SBP > 180 or < 90 mm Hg, agitation, diaphoresis, or anxiety.<sup>61</sup> The minute ventilation V<sub>E</sub> and maximal inspiratory pressure is significantly less predictive of successful extubation than a successful SBT.62

The strategy of daily or intermittent SBTs has been directly compared to weaning strategies based on stepwise reduction of the frequency of intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV), or stepwise reduction of the level of pressure-support ventilation (PSV). Daily or intermittent SBTs lead to successful extubation 2 to 3 times earlier than either IMV or PSV weans.

#### **Extubation Failure**

Overall, approximately 5% of cardiothoracic patients require reintubation. Patients with COPD have a 14% incidence, while those with a past history of stroke have a 10% incidence. Other risk factors include NYHA class IV functional status, renal failure, need for intra-aortic balloon counterpulsion, reduced pO<sub>2</sub>: F<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, reduced vital capacity, longer operating room time, a longer CPB run, and a longer initial ventilatory requirement. Unfortunately for ICU patients reintubation is typically a predictor of increased length of stay and increased mortality.

# **Chronic Ventilation and Tracheotomy**

In the early 1960s, translaryngeal intubation was associated with a prohibitively high rate of tracheal stenosis. As a result, a consensus existed that tracheotomy should be performed for patients requiring mechanical ventilation for longer than 3 days.<sup>67</sup> Low-pressure cuffs and soft tubes have since decreased the urgency of this intervention. A consensus subsequently evolved advocating that patients who continue to require mechanical ventilation at two weeks should undergo tracheotomy. Several trials have suggested that earlier discontinuation of mechanical ventilation and reduced complications are associated with earlier tracheotomy. 68 Tracheostomy results in reduced dead-space and airway resistance, is more comfortable for the patient, and usually allows the patient to participate more in the recovery process. It has been suggested that clinician behavior is positively affected by the presence of a tracheostomy tube; more aggressive attempts at

weaning and discontinuation of mechanical support may be made because reconnecting the ventilator is easy.

Percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy (PDT) performed in the ICU has increasingly been recognized as a safe procedure. A recent randomized prospective study of medical patients projected to require more than 14 days of mechanical ventilation<sup>69</sup> compared two groups: PDT within 48 hours and 14 to 16 days. One hundred twenty patients were enrolled. In the early PDT group, there was a strongly significant reduction in duration of mechanical ventilation (7.6  $\pm$  4.0 vs 17.4  $\pm$  5.3 days, p < .001), incidence of pneumonia (5 vs 25%, p < .005), and mortality (31.7 vs 61.7%, p < .005). There was no difference in incidence or severity of tracheal stenosis identified in-hospital and at 10 weeks.

#### Pleural Effusion

Accumulation of fluid in the pleural space is common after cardiac surgery, particularly on the left side, and often resolves with time and diuresis. Contributory factors can include fluid overload, residual hematoma which can draw fluid into the pleural space, bleeding, pericardial and pleural inflammation (postpericardiotomy syndrome), atelectasis, hypoalbuminemia, pneumonia, or pulmonary embolism. Pleural effusion can cause chest pain or heaviness, shortness of breath, or hypoxia. Symptomatic effusions can be treated with thoracentesis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and colchicine can be used to treat postperiocardotomy syndrome. Tube thoracostomy drainage may be necessary until resolution of the inciting process. Placed utilizing the Seldinger technique, smaller diameter tubes are often better tolerated than traditional chest tubes. In contrast, a significant hemothorax may need to be evacuated surgically to avoid subsequent developent of fibrothorax requiring decortication.

#### **Pneumonia**

Nosocomial pneumonias increase postoperative mortality. The incidence of ventilator associated pneumonia increases approximately 1% per day. Olinical diagnosis involves identification of a new or progressive infiltrate on CXR, change in character of sputum, leukocytosis, and fever.<sup>71</sup> Expectorated sputum cultures are considered to be very inaccurate, and directed bronchosopic sampling is preferred. Proper bronchoalveolar lavage requires large volumes of irrigant (>100 cc) and is infrequently performed. More commonly tracheobronchial aspiration is performed using several milliliters of normal saline. A Gram stain containing > 25 squamous epithelial cells per LPF indicates oral contamination. More than 25 neutrophils per LPF suggest infection. Quantitative culture of 105 to 106 cfu/cc ("moderate to numerous," "3 to 4+") is indicative of infection, while  $\leq 10^4$  cfu/cc ("rare to few," "1 to 2+") is more suggestive of colonization. Gramnegative organisms are the most common, and should be the target of first-line empiric antibiotic coverage. Specific patient and hospital factors and culture results and sensitivities will further refine antibiotic therapy.<sup>72</sup>

The important role of pulmonary toilet in both the prevention and treatment of nosocomial pneumonias cannot be over emphasized. All patients should be encouraged to get out of bed and ambulate (even if attached to the ventilator), turn, cough, and deep breathe. Chest physiotherapy and bronchodilators can also provide benefits. Sterile-in line suctioning should be performed in ventilated patients to clear secretions. Nasotracheal suctioning is effective in extubated patients. Therapeutic fiberoptic bronchoscopy can also be performed.

# Pulmonary Embolism

Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary thromboembolism (PE) are considered uncommon in the cardiac surgery population. The reported incidence of PE ranges from 0.5 to 3.5%, accounting for only 0.3 to 1.7% of perioperative deaths. This is believed to be due to large intraoperative doses of heparin, impaired platelet function post-CPB, increased use of antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants, and early ambulation. A recent autopsy study demonstrated a 52% incidence of DVT. Twenty percent of deceased cardiac surgery patients had small pulmonary emoboli, <sup>73</sup> and and PE was identified as the cause of death in 7%. Unfortunately, risks of bleeding and HIT make the choice of heparin DVT prophylaxis problematic. Intermittent pneumatic compression devices are effective if patients and staff are compliant with their use.

The diagnosis of PE requires a high index of suspicion, and should be considered in any postoperative patient who develops an increased  $PaO_2$ : $F_iO_2$  gradient, shortness of breath, or reduced exercise tolerance, particularly in the setting of a clear or unchanged CXR or thrombocytopenia consistent with HIT. Diagnosis is reliably obtained by PE-protocol thincut high-speed helical computed tomography of the chest, 74 although accuracy is still influenced by pretest probability. 75

#### RENAL AND METABOLIC SUPPORT

# Perioperative Renal Dysfunction/ Insufficiency

The new onset of renal dysfunction following cardiac surgery is correlated with significant morbidity and mortality. The incidence of acute renal failure (ARF) in CABG patients in the 1997 STS database was 3.14%, and 0.87% of these patients required dialysis. <sup>76</sup> Chertow studied 43,642 VA patients undergoing CABG or valve surgery. <sup>77</sup> The overall risk of ARF requiring dialysis was 1.1%. The mortality rate in this group was 63.7% compared with 4.3% in patients without ARF. Decreased myocardial function and advanced atherosclerosis were independent risk factors for the development of dialysis-dependent renal failure.

Patients with preoperative renal dysfunction (serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL) have a higher incidence of stroke, bleeding complications, dialysis, prolonged mechanical ventilation, length of stay, and death. Chertow found that preoperative renal function correlated with postoperative renal failure. The risk of ARF was 0.5%, 0.8%, 1.8%, and 4.9%

with baseline serum creatinine concentrations of <1 mg/dL, 1.0 to 1.4 mg/dL, 1.5 to 1.9 mg/dL, and 2.0 to 2.9 mg/dL, respectively. Chronic dialysis patients undergoing cardiac surgery have an 11.4% operative mortality rate, a 73% complication rate, and 32% 5-year actuarial survival rate.  $^{78}$  Cardiac surgery following renal transplantation has an associated operative mortality rate of  $8.8\%.^{79}$ 

To optimize preoperative renal function, contrast loads should be minimized and patients should be well hydrated and receive **renoprotective** agents (eg, *N*-acetylcysteine).

# Effects of Cardiopulmonary Bypass on Renal Function

Operative considerations include limiting the duration of CPB and maintenance of MAPs greater than 60 mm Hg. Additional effects of CPB include trauma to blood constituents, especially erythrocytes, with increased free hemoglobin levels and microparticle embolic insults to the kidneys. Hypothermia (during rewarming, vasodilation and hyperemia of tissue beds can result in third spacing of fluid), hemodilution (reduces viscosity of blood and plasma oncotic pressure) and ischemia reperfusion injury can influence renal function. Additionally, CPB leads to an increased release of catecholomines, hormones (rennin, aldosterone, angiotensin II, vasopressin, atrial natriuretic peptide, urodilan<sup>80</sup>) and inflammatory cytokines (kallikrein, bradykinin) which also affect renal function adversely. These adverse stimuli cause low renal blood flow, a decreased glomerular filtration rate and an increase in renal vascular resistance. Hypotension and pressor agents accentuate this response. Ultrafiltration is utilized in long pump runs to decrease volume overload in patients with renal dysfunction.

Independent of preoperative renal function, the primary postoperative goal is the maintenance of adequate renal perfusion pressure and a urine output greater than the 0.5 cc/kg/h. Brisk diuresis (>200 to 300 cc/h) is common following CPB. Volume replacement and maintenance of adequate BP and CO is required for adequate renal perfusion. The best measure of kidney perfusion is adequate urine output independent of diuretics. Beyond optimizing hemodynamics and avoiding nephrotoxic medications, there is no convincing evidence that treatment with diuretics, mannitol, dopamine, fenoldapam, nesiritide, or any other agent is renoprotective. This is not to say, however, that these agents are of no benefit in promoting diuresis and avoiding renal replacement therapies in the event of renal dysfunction.

# **Electrolyte Disturbances**

#### **CALCIUM**

Levels of ionized calcium (normal, 1.1 to 1.3 mmol/L) are critical for myocardial performance and hemostasis, and involved in reperfusion injury. Hypocalcemia causes a prolonged QT interval. Postoperatively hypocalcemia is common following CPB or an episode of hemodilution, sepsis,

or citrated blood transfusions. The concentration of calcium ion is greatest in the intracellular space, with small amounts in the extracellular fluid. Calcium levels bound to albumin change with the levels of serum albumin whereas ionized levels remain unchanged.

#### **POTASSIUM**

Potassium fluxes during cardiac surgery can be significant and affect cardiac automaticity and conduction. Cardioplegia, decreased urine output, decreased insulin levels, and RBC hemolysis all contribute to hyperkalemia. Brisk diuresis, insulin, and alkalosis can cause hypokalemia. Aggressive treatment of hypokalemia decreases the incidence of perioperative arrhythmias. Serum potassium levels and replacement protocols are an integral part of early postoperative management. Serum potassium rises logarithmically with replacement; larger quantities are required to treat significant hypokalemia.

#### **MAGNESIUM**

Magnesium (normal, 1.5 to 2 mEq/L) is the second most common intracellular cation after potassium. It is involved in endothelial cell homeostasis, <sup>83</sup> cardiac excitability and muscle contraction through its role as an ATP cofactor and calcium antagonist, and it is also closely involved in the regulation of intracellular potassium. <sup>84</sup> Following hemodilution and CPB, hypomagnesaemia is common (>70% of patients) and is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and torsade de pointes. <sup>85</sup>

# **Endocrine Dysfunction**

#### **DIABETES MELLITUS**

Up to 30% of patients have diabetes (type I or II) in the cardiac surgery population. Following CPB the hormonal stress response (increased growth hormone, catecholomines, and cortisol) causes hyperglycemia (even in nondiabetics) with a decrease in insulin production; this may persist for up to 24 hours postoperatively and is exacerbated by exogenous catecholamine administration. Anthony Furnary was the first to demonstrate that moderate control of blood glucose levels with continuous insulin infusions reduces the incidence of sternal wound infection by an order of magnitude.<sup>86</sup> Work by Van den Berghe suggested that a more aggressive approach aimed at maintaining blood glucose levels at or below 110 mg/dL resulted in a reduction in mortality rate in critically ill patients, and guidelines were revised to encourage stricter control.<sup>87</sup> Subsequently, the NICE-Sugar-Study was performed to determine the optimal target range for blood glucose in critically ill patients.<sup>88</sup> In this study, tight control (utilizing a target of 81 to 108 mg per deciliter) was associated with a higher incidence of hypoglycemia and mortality than conventional control (utilizing a target of 180 mg/dL). The STS workforce on blood glucose management in cardiac surgery patients concluded that targets <180 mg/dL reduce mortality, morbidity, and the incidence of wound infection and improve long-term survival.

#### ADRENAL DYSFUNCTION

The strain of cardiac surgery activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and increases plasma ACTH and cortisol levels. Subclinical adrenal insufficiency is present in up to 20% of the elderly population and can be unmasked by the stress of surgery. Perioperative stress dose steroids should be considered for patients taking exogenous steroids within 6 months of surgery. Any patient exhibiting prolonged, unexplained vasodilatory shock should be suspected of having adrenal insufficiency. Critically ill patients with normal adrenal function should have high cortisol levels. If the diagnosis is in doubt, a cosyntropin stimulation test should be performed for diagnosis. In the interim, dexamethasone may be administered IV without interfering with the test.

# RELEVANT POSTOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS

### Neurological

#### **CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM**

The incidence of **stroke** following cardiac surgery is procedure specific and varies between 1 and 4%. Ricotta and colleagues associated carotid stenosis (>50%), redo heart surgery, valve surgery, and prior stroke with increased postoperative neurological risk.<sup>89</sup> John and colleagues reviewed 19,224 patients in New York State. 90 The stroke rate was 1.4% following CABG, with a 24.8% mortality rate in that group. Multivariable logistic regression identified the following predictor variables: calcified aorta, prior stroke, age, carotid artery disease, duration of CPB, renal failure, peripheral vascular disease, smoking, and diabetes. Intraoperative factors that may cause postoperative neurologic deficits include particulate macroembolization of air, debris, or thrombus, microembolization of white blood cells, platelets, or fibrin,91 duration of CPB,92 cerebral hypoperfusion during nonpulsatile CPB and hypothermic circulatory arrest.<sup>93</sup> Because of bleeding risk, patients presenting with stroke are not candidates for intraenous thrombolytic interventions. Endovascular therapy may be beneficial in select patients with embolic occlusion if performed within 6 to 8 hours of the event, this window may be as long as 24 hours in patients with posterior circulation occlusion. If a patient is considered to be a candidate for endovascular intervention, a CT angiogram is required to define the anatomy of the vascular occlusion.

Neuropsychiatric deficits (neurocognitive dysfunction, delirium, seizures) are very common, occurring in up to 50 to 70% of patients following cardiac surgery. The cause of these neuropsychiatric disorders is uncertain and remains controversial. Although the dysfunction remains unclear, patients remain at risk for long-term cognitive decline. Van Dijk and colleagues<sup>94</sup> reviewed 12 cohort studies, a pooled analysis of 6 comparable studies showed 22.5% of patients to have a cognitive deficit at 2 months after operation. This may, however, be related to progression of underlying cerebrovascular disease rather than to CABG or CPB.<sup>95</sup>

Up to 50% of cardiac surgery patients experience delirium, particularly those with preexisting organic mental disorders, significant prior alcohol consumption, advanced age, or intracranial cerebral artery disease. 96 Perioperative medications, particularly benzodiazepines and opiates, as well as phenothiazines and anticholinergics can contribute to delerium.<sup>97</sup> There is increasing evidence that sedation with dexmedetomidine causes less delirium and results in improved outcomes when compared to sedation with benzodiazepines.<sup>98</sup> Right-sided parietal lobe lesions may present as delirium. Other causes of postoperative delirium in the cardiac intensive care patient include sleep deprivation, renal failure, hepatic failure, and thyroid abnormalities. electroencephalograms on these patients are usually abnormal, whereas in primary psychiatric diseases they are normal. Treatment involves correcting metabolic abnormalities, establishing a normal sleep-wake cycle in extubated patients, minimizing medications likely to cause delirium, and providing ventilated patients with sedation holidays.

# BRACHIAL PLEXUS INJURY/PERIPHERAL NERVE INJURY

Excessive sternal retraction during a median sternotomy may cause a brachial plexus injury as the first rib may impinge the lower trunk and branches. IMA harvesting may also cause damage to the brachial plexus with serious consequences. Malpositioning of the upper limbs during surgery may result in a neuropraxia due to compression of the ulnar nerve. Palsy or plegia of dorsiflexion and eversion of the foot can be caused by common peroneal nerve stretch or compression at the level of the head of the fibula. Saphenous neuropathy (sensory changes on the medial side of the calf to the great toe) following open vein graft harvesting (less so with endoscopic harvest) is also a potential complication secondary to the avulsion of pretibial or infrapatellar branches of the nerve.

#### Gastrointestinal

Mesenteric ischemia following cardiac surgery is infrequent but often catastrophic. 104 Risk factors include duration of bypass (hypoperfusion), use of pressor support (sympathetic vascoconstriction), use of an IABP or other sources of atherosclerotic embolism, atrial fibrillation, peripheral vascular disease, and HIT. Early surgical intervention (<6 hours) is associated with a 48% mortality rate, and this rises to 99% with delays (>6 hours) in surgical intervention. Gastrointestinal bleeding is common and can cause significant morbidity. The incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding can be reduced with the use of H<sub>2</sub>-inhibitors, proton pump inhibitors and sucralfate. 105 Other gastrointestinal complications include pancreatitis (hyperamylasemia is present in 35 to 65% of patients and is associated with an overt pancreatitis rate of 0.4 to 3%), 106 acute acalculous cholecystitis (likely secondary to hypoperfusion or biliary stasis promoted by narcotics or parenteral nutrition<sup>107</sup>), dysphasia secondary to tracheal

intubation or perioperative use of TEE, <sup>108</sup> small or large bowel ileus (Ogilvie's syndrome is associated with long-term ventilation, narcotic use, and anticholinergic agents). <sup>109</sup> Preoperative liver dysfunction (noncardiac cirrhosis) is associated with a high incidence of postoperative morbidity and mortality (Child class A cirrhosis: 20% morbidity, 0% mortality; Child class B cirrhosis: 80% morbidity, 100% mortality). Although 20% of patients develop a transient hyperbilirubinemia, fewer than 1% have significant hepatocellular damage which progresses to chronic hepatitis or liver failure. <sup>110</sup> Liver failure associated with multisystem organ failure can lead to coagulopathy and hypoglycemia; these symptoms are generally associated with an extremely poor prognosis.

### Nosocomial Infections

Ten to twenty percent of cardiac surgery patients develop a nosocomial infection. Infections may be related to the surgical wound, lung, urinary tract, invasive lines or devices, or the gastrointestinal tract. Prolonged mechanical ventilation is associated with nosocomial pneumonia. Pneumonia is second only to urinary tract infection in frequency and carries the highest mortality rate. Smokers and COPD patients are most likely to be colonized preoperatively and have a higher incidence of pulmonary infection (15.3 vs 3.6% in controls).<sup>111</sup>

Catheter-related infections (ie, bladder and vascular related) are common in the intensive care unit. The most common pathogens are *Staphylococcus aureus* (12%), *coagulase-negative staphylococci* (11%), *Candida albicans* (11%), *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* (10%), and *Enterococcus* sp.<sup>112</sup>

#### **FEVER**

Fevers are common in the intensive care setting, but are a poor indicator of postoperative bacteremia (3.2% incidence in 835 febrile CABG patients). The yield of true positive bacteremia ranges from 4 to 5%, with a contamination rate ranging from 32 to 47%. The incidence of false-postive blood culture resuts can be minimized by avoid blood draws from indwelling lines. Noninfectious causes of fever in cardiac surgery patients include myocardial infarction, post-pericardiotomy syndrome, and drug fever. Infectious causes include wound infection, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, catheter sepsis, and loculated areas of contaminated blood accumulation (eg, pericardial, pleural, retroperitoneal, and leg wound spaces).

#### SEPSIS/SEPTIC SHOCK

Septic shock following cardiac surgery should prompt an agrresive search for etiology. Pathophysiologic features of sepsis include systemic inflammation, hypotension, and impaired fibrinolysis, leading to multiorgan failure, irreversible shock, and death (20 to 50% mortality has been reported).  $^{115}$  MVO $_2$  can be abnormally high secondary to shunting and a failure to extract oxygen at the cellular level. In vasodilatory shock the maintenance of end-organ tissue perfusion is critical; this

includes aggressive fluid management and vasopressin.<sup>116</sup> Methylene blue (which inhibits NO synthesis) has been used successfully in refractory hypotension. Bernard and colleagues<sup>117</sup> in the PROW/ESS study group showed a distinct survival advantage in the treatment of severe sepsis utilizing drotrecogin alfa (activated) or recombinant human-activated protein C (Zigris). These agents reduce the systemic inflammatory, procoagulant, and fibrinolytic reactions to infection. In a randomized study of 1690 patients, the mortality rate was 30.8% in the placebo group versus 24.7% in the treatment group.

#### **WOUNDS**

Delayed Sternal Closure/Sternal Infection. Complicated operations with persistent bleeding and hemodynamic instability (due to tissue edema) may preclude primary sternal closure. Delayed sternal closure allows hemodynamic stabilization, and diuresis. <sup>118</sup> Anderson and colleagues <sup>119</sup> outlined the Brigham and Women's Hospital experience: 1.7% (87 of 5177) open chests were managed with a hospital survival rate of 76%. Complications included deep sternal infection (n = 4), stroke (n = 8), and dialysis (n = 13). Multivariate analysis revealed mechanical ventricular assistance and reoperation for bleeding as independent predictors of in-hospital mortality.

Superficial and Deep Sternal Wounds. Superficial and deep sternal wound infections are significant complications of cardiac surgery. Deep sternal infection with associated mediastinitis occurs in 1 to 2% of cardiac operations, with a resultant mortality rate approaching 10%. 120 Common organisms include Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Corynebacterium, and enteric Gram-negative bacilli. 121 Patients predisposed to sternal infections include those with significant comorbidities (obesity, diabetes, COPD, renal dysfunction, low serum albumin), prolonged CPB, blood transfusions, reoperations, diabetics with bilateral IMA harvests,122 and patients with hyperglycemia. 123 Simple preoperative measures such as clipping of chest hair, using Hibiclens washes, administration of adequate prophylactic antibiotics prior to skin incision, ensuring good intraoperative hemostasis without the use of bone wax, and closure with subcuticular sutures and Dermabond (topical adhesive) rather than skin staples. Effective glucose control during surgery and for at least 3 days postoperatively is associated with a significantly lower sternal wound infection rate.

Minor infections frequently respond to intravenous antibiotics, opening of the wound, and local wound care. Deeper infections require intravenous antibiotics (6 weeks); initial empiric therapy should consist of broad coverage against Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative bacilli with the regimen adjusted when cultures (blood, mediastinal or deep sternal wound drainage) have been speciated. The mainstay of treatment is surgical exploration and extensive debridement which may require removal of the

sternum with primary or secondary closure with muscle or an omental flap. <sup>124</sup> Postoperative vacuum-assisted closure <sup>125</sup> of mediastinal wounds improves wound healing and reduces hospital length of stay.

#### Nutrition

Preoperative debilitated or cachectic patients (ie, more than 10% weight loss over 6 months) with albumin levels of less than 3.5 g/dL<sup>126</sup> are exceptionally prone to complications following surgery. There is no evidence to support a role for preoperative hyperalimentation. Body mass index (a good nutritional index) of less than 15 kg/m<sup>2</sup> is associated with increased morbidity. Postoperative patients have accelerated catabolic protein losses, usually requiring 25 to 40 kcal/kg/day. Advances in immunonutritional pharmacology (arginine, glutamine, and n-3 fatty acids) in complex postoperative cardiac surgery patients may have a defined role in the future.<sup>127</sup>
