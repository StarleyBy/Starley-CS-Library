# Surgery for Functional Mitral Regurgitation

Matthew A. Romano • Steven F. Bolling

Functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) is a complication of ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy, occurring secondary to left ventricular (LV) geometrical distortion from tenting, inferobasilar migration, apical displacement, annular dilation and posterior leaflet restriction, and/or regional LV wall dysfunction. MR leads to a vicious cycle of LV volume overload, increased geometric distortion and progressive MR. FMR complicating congestive heart failure predicts a poor survival. Mitral surgery, to treat FMR has been undertaken with an acceptably low operative mortality. However, the exact MR surgery (repair or replacement) for which patient and what benefit, remains controversial.

Congestive heart failure is one of the world's leading causes of morbidity and mortality. As our population ages, the number of patients suffering from end-stage heart failure will continue to rise. In the United States alone, there are nearly 7 million patients suffering from heart failure. In 2012, heart failure "therapy" cost the United States over \$50 billion. This total includes health care services, medications, and lost productivity. Yet of the 700,000 new congestive heart failure (CHF) patients diagnosed each year, less than 3000 are offered transplantation due to limitations of age, comorbid conditions and donor availability. Even fewer are presently served with a mechanical assist device. One of the most common (up to 50% of patients) and serious problems in cardiomyopathy is the development of functional or secondary mitral regurgitation. Functional mitral regurgitation (FMR), nonorganic mitral valve (MV) disease, may eventually affect almost all heart failure patients as a preterminal or terminal event. FMR is not caused by intrinsic disease of the valve, but by left ventricular (LV) remodeling, dilation, and dysfunction leading to geometric reconfiguration of the mitroventricular apparatus, including papillary muscle displacement and annular dilation. MV leaflets become tethered, with failure of anterior-posterior leaflet coaptation, resulting in symmetric or asymmetric regurgitation. 2,3 The progressive dilatation of the left ventricle initially gives rise to FMR that begets further ventricular dilatation and more FMR. FMR is associated with poor quality of life and a reduction in long-term survival. Mitral surgery, while not addressing the underlying ventricular

pathology, hopefully could interrupt this cycle of ventricular deterioration through the restoration of mitral competency.

#### **BACKGROUND**

It has been well documented that even small amounts of FMR are harmful in CHF patients. Grigioni et al<sup>4</sup> showed that when FMR regurgitant volume was >30 ml the 5-year survival was <35% compared to 44% for a regurgitant volumes of 1 to 29 ml and 61% for CHF patients with no MR. Bursi<sup>5</sup> also examined the role of FMR and its impact in CHF. CHF patients (469) were followed for mortality according to severity of their FMR. Their 5-year survival was 83% in patients with no/1+ FMR, 64% in 2+, 58% in 3+, and 46% in 4 + (p < .0001). The association between FMR and Major Adverse Cardiac and Cerebrovascular Events (MACCE) was strong and independent in this propensity matched analysis. A further study<sup>6</sup> denoted that among 303 patients post MI, ischemic MR was present in 194 (64%), and was a significant independent predictor of long-term mortality (relative risk, RR [95% confidence interval, CI] = 1.88, p = .003). Additionally, in a study from the Duke Cardiovascular Databank,7 3-4+ FMR was present in 30% of 2057 HF patients with an left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 40%, and was an independent predictor of 5-year mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [95% CI] = 1.23).2 Lastly, the Mayo Clinic<sup>8</sup> looked at the prognostic implications of FMR in patients with advanced systolic CHF in a heart failure clinic. Of 558 NYHA III-IV patients, those with at least moderate MR had a 5-year survival of only 27%. These studies demonstrate that FMR is not just a sign of advanced CHF, but an independent determinant of CHF death. That FMR is bad for CHF patients is supported by many other studies that show that the severity of MR impacts quality of life, as well as survival. Furthermore, there is a strong association between the presence of ischemic FMR severity and heart failure hospitalizations. However, while the presence of FMR predicts a poor prognosis in patients with left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, unfortunately, "proof" that correction of FMR improves prognosis remains elusive.

Historically, the surgical approach to FMR was nonvalve sparing MV replacement, at a time when little was understood of the interdependence of ventricular function and the annular-papillary muscle continuity. Consequently, patients with low EF who underwent MV replacement with removal of the subvalvular apparatus had prohibitively high mortality rates. As explanation the erroneous concept of a beneficial "pop-off" effect of FMR was conceived. This idea erroneously proposed that mitral incompetence provided low-pressure relief during systolic ejection for the failing ventricle, and that removal of this effect through mitral replacement was responsible for the perioperative deterioration of ventricular function. Consequently, MV replacement in patients with heart failure and FMR was discouraged.

#### **FMR ANATOMY**

A firm understanding of the anatomy of the MV is fundamental to the surgical management of FMR. The MV apparatus consists of the annulus, leaflets, chordae tendineae, and papillary muscles as well as the entire left ventricle. These structures form a "closure cylinder" with the papillary musculature directly aligned beneath the annulus. Most importantly, the maintenance of chordal, annular, and subvalvular continuity is essential for the preservation of mitral geometric relationships, as well as ventricular twist mechanics and systolic power. MR in heart failure is not primarily related to the valve but to ventricular pathology. The degree of LV distortion reflects the degree of MR. As the ventricle fails, progressive dilatation of the LV results in outward papillary muscle migration, alteration of the closure cylinder, and thus loss of the zone of coaptation (Fig. 37-1).

**FIGURE 37-2** Asymmetric FMR noted with ischemic related LV changes due to posterior infarction.

The end result of progressive FMR and global ventricular remodeling is similar regardless of the etiology of cardiomyopathy. The primary lesion in ischemic FMR is leaflet tethering, which results from ventricular remodeling associated with an ischemic insult. Posterior-lateral and apical displacement of the papillary muscles, which correlates with a measurable "tethering distance," leads to apical tenting and restriction of the free margin of the leaflets and poor leaflet coaptation. Tethering of secondary chordae can lead to a "seagull" deformation of the anterior leaflet. Although both papillary muscles may be displaced, the posterior papillary muscle usually predominates, which leads to tethering of the "P3" leaflet segment. 9,10 This is seen in posterior infarction related to the posterior descending artery distribution and the mitral regurgitation jet is usually eccentric and posteriorly directed along the P3 area which is restricted (Fig. 37-2). In contrast, left anterior descending infarction leads to more global remodeling involving both papillary muscles, and more diffuse leaflet tethering with large central jets of mitral regurgitation. Although annular dilatation and ventricular remodeling accompanies all MR, it is usually an associated finding, as opposed to a primary causal lesion in ischemic mitral regurgitation. The degree of annular dilatation is much less in ischemic mitral regurgitation than in degenerative mitral regurgitation, which is one of the reasons that "downsizing" of the mitral ring annuloplasty may best address leaflet tethering in ischemic MV regurgitation. Conversely, FMR associated with dilated cardiomyopathies tends to have more symmetric distortion with more annular dilation than asymmetric ischemic FMR.<sup>11,12</sup> Because of this difference in geometric distortion, as well as patient comorbidity profiles, it may be that dilated and ischemic FMR patients should be thought of and treated in somewhat different manners.

#### THERAPY OF FMR

Despite the underlying pathology, the goals of therapy for FMR patients are to improve symptoms and quality of life, reduce heart failure hospitalization, and, hopefully to improve survival. The therapies shown to be most effective for FMR are those directed at the underlying LV dysfunction, most importantly guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HF.<sup>1,13-15</sup> Cardiac resynchronization (with or without a defibrillator) if indications are met (wide QRS > 150 ms) should also be considered when appropriate. 16,17 Finally of course, coronary revascularization should be performed in patients with ischemia and myocardial viability. While all patients with FMR should receive GDMT for management of CAD, LV dysfunction and heart failure, unfortunately morbidity and mortality of patients with CHF and secondary FMR remains high. A recent study showed that among 404 FMR patients treated with GDMT, 4-year cardiac mortality occurred in 43 and 45% with moderate and severe MR, respectively, compared to only 6% with mild MR (p = .003). <sup>13</sup> Furthermore, moderate or severe FMR was also shown to be a high independent predictor of new onset HF in patients with ischemic LV dysfunction (RR = 3.2, p = .0001). The role of surgical MV repair or replacement is to potentially interrupt the vicious cycle of LV volume overload causing LV dilatation leading to secondary MR, which further increases LV volume overload and dilatation further increasing MR.

#### **FMR SURGERY**

The present AHA/ACC Valve Guidelines (2014) and the ESC/EACTS Guidelines<sup>18,19</sup> have separate guidelines for functional or secondary ischemic mitral regurgitation (FMR). As noted, these guidelines state that treating ischemia with coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous methods should be primarily undertaken for FMR. Additionally, all FMR patients should have guideline GDMT, with consideration for CRT, if they have a QRS greater than 150 ms. However, if the patients remain symptomatic with severe mitral regurgitation or stage D disease, they may be considered for "MV surgery" as a 2B indication. Yet, from the surgeon's perspective, while it is recommended that surgical correction of FMR should be considered exactly how to successfully correct FMR remains unclear. Currently, the most common technique to restore valve competence is placing an undersized or restrictive annuloplasty ring to reduce mitral annulus size and increase leaflet coaptation. Unfortunately, ischemic FMR may persist or recur after restrictive MV annuloplasty. Persistent or recurrent FMR in post op patients is understandably associated with unabated ventricular dilatation, an escalation of CHF symptomatology and possible reduction in long-term survival.

Surgical mitral annuloplasty improves symptoms in patients with CHF and it has been shown that mitral repair is feasible with a low mortality. Several authors have demonstrated 30-day mortality rates as low as 1 to 5% for mitral repair for MR in CHF. Recently, Geidel reported that the

late results of restrictive annuloplasty in patients with FMR and advanced cardiomyopathy demonstrated a 3% 30-day mortality and 91% 12 months survival with little postoperative recurrence of significant MR. Similarly, data from Germany in transplant candidates, showed a 7% operative mortality and no difference in survival after MV repair versus transplant indicating that high risk MV surgery in patients with cardiomyopathy and FMR may offer a midterm alternative treatment for patients with drug refractory heart failure and FMR.<sup>20-22</sup> Perhaps, the most compelling data for the safety and efficacy of MV repair for FMR comes from the MV surgery alone arm of the prospective Acorn trial (CorCap Cardiac Support Device, a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial). The Acorn trial showed a 98% 30-day survival rate, 2% repeat reoperation, and 85% 24 months survival and significant improvements in quality of life, exercise performance, and NYHA class. Furthermore, in the MV surgery arm, improvement in LV volumes, mass, and shape was sustained out to 5 years with little recurrence of significant MR.<sup>23</sup>

However, the "achilles heel" of MV repair in may series of FMR is persistent, residual or recurrent MR.<sup>24-27</sup> It was learned that the intertrigonal distance is not stable in FMR, with dilatation occurring along, not only the insertion of the posterior leaflet, but also in the anterior portion. This intertrigonal portion dilates and although once considered to be a "measurable" standard by which to size annuloplasty rings, it is now known from a landmark paper of Hueb that this is not the case.<sup>28</sup> Therefore, previous methods of FMR sizing were incorrect and "undersizing" rings has become the standard for these functional MR patients. This may partly explain the operation "failing" and recurrence of mitral regurgitation in functional MR patients when using too large "classic-sized" rings or when using a partial or flexible rings.

However, despite undersizing rings, there is significant disparity in reccurence rates among FMR series. The lack of a mortality benefit may be partially explained by the absence of a durable repair. When McGee and Gillinov<sup>24</sup> showed no mortality benefit in FMR after mitral repair, they also noticed the rate of recurrent significant MR to be 30 to 40% at 1 year. Others have shown even higher rates of return of FMR, up to 80%.<sup>29</sup> This has led to an attempt to identify surgical predictors of recurrent MR and for improved surgical techniques that result in a more permanent repair.<sup>30</sup> In order to observe a survival benefit in these patients after mitral repair, FMR must be fixed permanently, as residual and recurrent MR may obscure or obliterate any possible survival benefit.

# PREDICTORS OF RECURRENT MITRAL REGURGITATION

Many of the mechanisms of recurrent functional MR have been elucidated and include annular level and subvalvar components. Major predictors of recurrent FMR include LV size greater than 65 mm, a coaptation depth of greater than 1 cm below the annular plane and angulation of the MV apparatus, all of which indicate degree of LV distortion. In patients

with a posterior leaflet angle > 45° (high posterolateral restriction) undergoing restrictive annuloplasty for ischemic MR, preoperative echo was shown to accurately predict persistence of MR and 3-year survival. Also studies show that the angle between the tip of the anterior leaflet and the annular plane is a predictor of MR recurrence. An anterior leaflet angle greater than 25 to 40° was a predictor of MR recurrence. Many have also shown LV function or degree of MR as determinants of recurrent MR while others point out the importance of both LV sphericity and tethering depth as predictors.<sup>31-33</sup>

One of the most important LV predictor of recurrent MR may be left ventricular end diastolic dimension (LVEDD) > 65 mm. In patients with preoperative LVEDD of 65 mm or less, restrictive mitral annuloplasty with revascularization provided a mortality benefit for ischemic mitral regurgitation and heart failure; however, when LVEDD exceeded 65 mm, outcome was poor and a different approach to CHF should be considered. Perhaps, the most important mechanistic predictor of recurrent FMR is an increased anterior-posterior or septal-lateral mitral annular diameter. This is the most significant determinant of FMR as leaflet coaptation and therefore mitral competency, is dependent upon the diameter of the MV annulus. The MV is thought to have roughly twice the amount of coaptive surface as needed. This redundancy allows for LV volume changes and explains why obligatory FMR occurs when the LVEDD approaches 65 mm. Furthermore, this may explain why FMR is evanescent. Studies of FMR reveal that decreasing filling and systemic vascular resistance lead to reduction in dynamic FMR. This is attributed to a reduction in the mitral orifice area relating to decreased LV volume and annular distension.<sup>34</sup>

This complex relationship between mitral annular area and leaflet coaptation may explain why an undersized "valvular" repair may help a "ventricular" problem. Three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging and echo studies showed that the mitral annulus flattens and significantly increases its AP diameter. This CHF-related change has been shown not only in animal models, but in humans as well. Kongsaerepong et al<sup>35</sup> found that the strongest predictor of recurrent FMR following mitral repair was a residual large AP diameter, that is, a "too large" ring. Lastly, Spoor demonstrated that the use of flexible rings (which flex and allow the largest AP diameter) as opposed to a rigid complete ring was associated with a five times higher recurrent mitral regurgitation rate. Presently numerous rigid, complete FMR specific rings with stable AP dimension reduction are available.<sup>10</sup>

Interestingly, acute remodeling of the base of the heart with complete rigid, undersized rings may also play a beneficial role in FMR hearts. These disease-specific rings may reestablish an ellipsoid shape to the LV, as evidenced by the acute decreased sphericity index and LV volumes. Restoration of LV geometry is of paramount importance in CHF patients. This has been demonstrated by the Restore—MV trial. In that trial ischemic FMR patients, requiring coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) did better with a direct LV reshaping device (Coapsys), than with CABG with the addition of an undersized mitral ring, even though they had slightly more

residual MR. This study pointed out the differential effects of MR and the LV.<sup>36</sup> In summary, patients with predictors of failure should be considered poor candidates for FMR repair, and alternatives should be contemplated. Unfortunately, progression of ventricular disease may have the worst predictive outcome for these patients. This is not amenable by mitral repair and one must be aware that fundamentally FMR is a ventricular disease.

#### INDICATIONS FOR FMR SURGERY

The indications for surgery for FMR are more cautious than those for primary, degenerative MR due to the recognition that surgical outcomes are linked to underlying LV remodeling. Secondary FMR can acutely be corrected by MV surgery, however, it has never clearly been demonstrated that reducing or eliminating FMR alters the natural history or improves survival. 37,38 Moreover, whether the response to surgery is different in secondary MR due to ischemic versus nonischemic cardiomyopathy has also not been established. One-year mortality after MV surgery for severe ischemic MR (with or without CABG) is up to 17%. Therefore, the benefit of MV repair in patients with FMR and heart failure is unclear. Wu et al showed no mortality benefit in FMR patients treated with MV repair, although they did not examine the effect of recurrent mitral regurgitation. In ischemic cardiomyopathy patients, several nonrandomized studies showed that MV repair in addition to CABG for ischemic FMR did not alter long-term functional status or survival when compared with CABG alone. 16-19 Trichon demonstrated a survival advantage in ischemic cardiomyopathy patients who underwent CABG plus MV repair only compared with medical management, as there was no difference between CABG plus MV repair versus CABG alone.<sup>6</sup> Conversely, far more other nonrandomized studies, have demonstrated that MV repair plus CABG does improve survival compared with medical therapy or CABG alone in patients with FMR due to ischemic cardiomyopathy.37-39

#### **MODERATE FMR**

The first published randomized prospective FMR trial for moderate FMR was by Fattouch et al<sup>40</sup> This study describes 102 patients with moderate chronic ischemic MR (mean MR grade 2+ and LVEF 43%) and moderately dilated left ventricles (mean LVEDD 59 mm) that were randomized to CABG plus MV repair (n = 48) or CABG alone (n = 54). Postoperative and follow-up MR grade, NYHA class, and LV remodeling were improved in the MV repair group. That trial was not powered for mortality analysis and in-hospital and 5-year survival was not statistically different between groups. Interestingly, exercise echo at 1 year in these patients showed far better hemodynamic response and less occurrence of MR in the mitral repair group.

Reinforcing this finding, Deja published in Circulation the results of the mitral surgery arm for all patients with FMR

and an EF of <35% from the STICH trial. This report of 1212 patients, showed not only a quality of life improvement, but hinted at a survival benefit from the addition of MV repair to CABG in these high risk patients.<sup>37</sup> Finally, Chan reported results from a randomized, prospective survival trial of CABG with or without MV repair for FMR in the RIME trial. At 1 year of follow-up, FMR patients who had the addition of MV repair had lower LV end-systolic volume index (LVESVI), brain naturetic protein (BNP) and MR grade, as well as better sphericity and exercise performance.<sup>40</sup> Conversely, in a recent NIH-sponsored, multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted by the Cardiothoracic Surgery Trials Network (CTSnet), despite MV repair with CABG being significantly more effective than CABG alone in reducing or eliminating moderate ischemic MR, there were no differences at 1-year in LVESVI or rates of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event. 41 Longer follow-up could reveal whether differences in residual/recurrent MR will manifest in clinical endpoints such as death and rehospitalization for heart failure. Of note, in these randomized trials of mitral repair for moderate ischemic FMR, there appears to be no operative mortality penalty for the addition of an undersized ring.<sup>42</sup> Given the improvements seen with MR correction in patients with only moderate MR and moderate LV dysfunction, it is tempting to hypothesize clinical benefits at longer follow up.

#### **SEVERE FMR**

There are very few randomized trials of surgery for severe FMR. Nonrandomized evidence including the meta-analysis by Vassileva et al<sup>43</sup> favoring mitral repair is a compilation of retrospective and single center studies. Conversely, Lorusso et al<sup>44</sup> demonstrated no difference in short- or long-term mortality between patients treated with MV replacement versus repair in severe FMR.

In a further study,<sup>44</sup> the CTSnet enrolled 251 patients with severe ischemic MR and coronary artery disease between 2009

and 2011 and randomized them to ether receive undersized MV repair (126 patients) or chord-sparing replacement (125 patients). The primary endpoint was LV reverse remodeling assessed by LVESVI measured at 12 months. At 12 months, LVESVI was 54 mL/m<sup>2</sup> in the repair group versus 60 mL/m<sup>2</sup> in the replacement group. There was no significant difference in LVESVI. The 1-year mortality rate was 14.3% in the repair group versus 17.6% in the replacement group. However, the repair group showed a significantly higher rate of recurrence of moderate or severe MR at 12 months (32.6 vs 2.3%). There were no significant differences in the rate of a MACCE, functional status or quality of life at 12 months. In this propensity-matched study MV repair was the strongest predictor of need for valve reoperation, with a recurrence of MR in surviving patients at 1 year of 32.6% and at 2 years of 46% (Fig. 37-3). Interestingly, however, in a subgroup analysis of MV repair<sup>45</sup> patients who did not have recurrent FMR, LV reverse remodeling was significantly better than in patients who had MV replacement. Mitral repair without recurrent MR was also far better than those with a "bad" repair (ie, significant recurrence of MR) (Fig. 37-4). This may imply that a "good" FMR repair without significant recurrence is better than a replacement. However, the high recurrence rate of significant FMR is problematic. The choice of repair versus replacement remains controversial since MV repair may be associated with lower short- and intermediate-term morbidity and mortality, while at the same time MV repair of FMR is associated with high recurrence rates of moderate/severe FMR, but equal survival and CHF status.

Lastly, the role for MV repair in nonischemic cardiomyopathy patients has been less extensively studied. Bolling et al described excellent survival following MV repair in a series of cardiomyopathy patients without coronary artery disease. 20,21 Another report of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy patients treated with MV repair had significant resolution of mitral regurgitation and heart failure symptoms, with excellent long-term survival. 46 DeBonis et al

demonstrated 81% survival at 3.5 years, with excellent freedom from MR and heart failure symptoms, in a smaller series of nonischemic FMR patients undergoing MV repair.<sup>47</sup> Despite these excellent outcomes, there are very little data comparing surgery to medical management in patients with nonischemic FMR.

#### **ECHO DEFINITIONS OF FMR**

When examining the reports of FMR surgery, it must be remembered, that there is disparity among the guidelines as to what constitutes moderate versus severe FMR. All the guidelines agree that EROA ≥ 0.4 cm<sup>2</sup>, RgV ≥ 60 mL, and  $RgF \ge 50\%$  constitute severe primary MR. However, the recent ACC/AHA Guidelines on valvular heart disease propose a new definition for severe FMR at an EROA > 0.2 cm<sup>2</sup>. This lower threshold accounts for the possibility that the actual EROA is larger than calculated by PISA in FMR, as well as the fact that "moderate" or more FMR in the setting of a cardiomyopathy has been associated with an adverse prognosis. However, it is not clear what to do with an FMR patient with a EROA of 0.2 cm<sup>2</sup>, nor are there convincing data showing that correction of "severe" FMR at the lower threshold improves patient outcomes in FMR. Therefore, this new recommendation remains controversial. 48

### TECHNIQUES OF MITRAL SURGERY FOR FMR

For FMR operations, meticulous attention should be paid to myocardial preservation and cardiopulmonary perfusion. At the time of exposure of the MV, it can be noted that the MV appears "normal". The reduction in AP diameter and orifice area of the MV is an overcorrection and overcompensation for a disease of the ventricle. This "undersizing" of the mitral ring was first proposed by Bolling, in 1995 and has become a standard technical approach for FMR repair. When undersizing a mitral ring, it is recommended that one use numerous annular sutures, as compared to degenerative MR repairs, to distribute the workload of annular reductive force. These sutures may be put very closely together, or even on a diagonal. Some advocate the use of pledgeted sutures, or the use of an extra row or a few pledgeted reinforcement sutures posteriorly, once the ring is tied in place.

In terms of FMR ring sizing, the normal mitral annulus is roughly proportional to a patients thumb and forefinger in a circle. One must "downsize" from there. There are some who have advocated double downsizing, meaning two sizes below that measured at the time of operation; however, the vast majority of patients may be well served with a "small" 26 or 28 mm ring. Although initially in FMR patients there was concern for both systolic anterior motion of the anterior leaflet (SAM) and/or mitral stenosis from such downsizing, these have not resulted in significant clinical sequelae in long-term FMR follow-up series. However, it must be noted that some investigators have reported "functional" mitral stenosis with provocative (dobutamine) testing with undersized rings. <sup>49</sup>

The type of ring utilized for FMR repairs is an important technical consideration. As noted, in a landmark paper by Hueb, the fibrous portion of the mitral annulus anteriorly between the two mitral trigones dilated proportionally and as much as the posterior muscular annulus. Magne reported failure rates of up to 80% at 6 months postoperatively with large flexible and/or partial bands for FMR patients. Silberman et al<sup>51</sup> reported on predictors of residual and recurrent mitral regurgitation in FMR and the two largest multivariate predictors were LV size and the type of ring. In fact, the type of ring was a better predictor than LV size. That study showed that small rigid and complete rings were best for FMR. In the specific disease of FMR, large partial or incomplete rings probably do not result in a durable repair and are not favored technically. Presently, there are numerous specific small rigid and complete FMR rings with a disproportionate AP diameter dimension reduction. While none of these rings have shown clinical outcome differences between them, they are probably most favored for the repair of FMR.<sup>51</sup>

There are some FMR patients that should be approached with clinical caution. Silverman showed the larger the ventricle, the worst the outcome for FMR patients. This was also shown in a study from Dion which demonstrated that LVEDDs over 65 mm had a much poorer outcome than those starting at a smaller LV size. Probably, there are some ventricles that are "too far gone" and mitral repair will not be beneficial in these patients. Furthermore, patients with poor RV function and very high PA pressures should be carefully evaluated and perhaps avoided.

When coming off cardiopulmonary bypass there should be no mitral regurgitation seen on intraoperative postop transesophageal echocardiography. And not only should there be no mitral regurgitation, the zone of coaptation should be measured and should be at least 8 to 10 mm long. If this is not the case then the patient certainly has a much higher incidence of recurrence of mitral regurgitation when they are awake and removed from the unloading effects of general anesthesia.

There are other adjunct therapies that have been used for the FMR repair. In the dilated FMR MV, there are often deep clefts between P1/P, and P2/P3 which should be closed. Borger has advocated the use of lysis of secondary chords to both the anterior and posterior leaflets to allow for a longer zone of coaptation. While this method has been technically successful, there is no long-term follow-up and the effect of disrupting any chordal structures on LV function is unknown.

FMR is a ventricular disease and surgeons have tried to add adjunctive and inventive "ventricular" therapies to an undersized mitral ring, thereby directing operative therapy to the ventricle itself. Kron has advocated the use of "ring and string" by placing a Goretex traction suture in the posterior papillary muscle and bringing it up towards the annular plane. Hvass has demonstrated the use a double annular ring, placing a standard annular ring at the annulus level and then a second one of Gortex, woven around the papillary muscles to recreate the normal cylinder of closure. Many authors have reported moving papillary muscles or even sewing them together. None of these operations have had long-term follow-up. Some surgeons have advocated augmenting the anterior or the posterior leaflet with bovine pericardium to improve the length of the zone of coaptation. While these approaches increase the technical difficulty of the operation, they are certainly appealing on the basis of altering the underlying problem. Other types of ventricular therapies which have been utilized: the ACORN restriction jacket, the Coapsys ventricular tether, a silicon lifting pad behind the posterior inferior ventricular wall amongst others. None of these therapies have long-term follow-up. 52-54

## MITRAL VALVE REPLACEMENT IN FMR

Which FMR valves to replace primarily remains controversial. The recent reports in the NEJM have added to our decision-making knowledge base. Perhaps the most important is the summary paper by Lancellotti. In this report the predictors of failed FMR repair are mild annular dilatation, coaptation depth more than 1 cm, reverse angulation of the posterior leaflet or LV remodeling greater than 65 mm or a LVEDV greater than 100 mm indexed. Kron has also shown in the follow-up paper to Acker (NEJM) that posterior-basilar dyskinesia or akinesia is associated with a high rate of MR recurrence, even with an undersized repair.

While which patient to replace in FMR remains controversial, there is a consensus on the technical aspects of MV replacement for FMR. MV replacement should be a total valve sparing replacement. Yun demonstrated in a randomized trial comparing partial versus complete choral sparring MV replacement, that the effects on left ventricular volume and function were much better preserved with complete versus posterior leaflet sparring. Nonvalve sparring mitral replacement should be abandoned. There are numerous techniques for total valve sparring MV replacement in FMR including anterior flip-over, in which a C-shaped incision is placed in the anterior leaflet and the entire anterior apparatus is moved posteriorly. Following appropriate valve sizing, pledgeted stitches are placed through the posterior annulus, the edge of the posterior leaflet, and the "flipped" anterior leaflet, placing both chordal apparatus and leaflets behind the MV prosthesis (Fig. 37-5). A second method of achieving total valve sparring is to remove the center of the anterior leaflet then rotating the

remaining portions of the anterior leaflet to the left and right. Valve sizing for FMR should be prudent and not "oversized". With modern MV prostheses there should not be undue worry of stenosis and overly large bulky valves may impair LV dynamics in these already poor LVs. Acker showed in severe FMR patients, a total valve sparring operative mortality of 4.2%, which was only slightly higher than the operative mortality of 1.6% mitral repair for FMR patients.

#### PERCUTANEOUS FMR OPTIONS

Percutaneous mitral therapy could theoretically offer improved safety as compared to surgical MV surgery and may be suited for the treatment of higher risk FMR patients. Taramasso reported a nonrandomized comparison of 91 patients undergoing surgical for FMR, and compared them against 52 patients undergoing MitraClip. All patients had severe FMR, were symptomatic despite GDMT and had ischemic or idiopathic dilated myopathies. The decision to perform surgical correction versus MitraClip therapy was based on logistic EuroSCORE and frailty. Patients were followed 18 months for surgery and 8 months for MitraClip. The surgical group underwent concomitant CABG 35%, tricuspid valve repair 25%, and atrial fibrillation ablation (26%). The MitraClip group was older, had a two-fold higher logistic EuroScore, Bigger LVs (LVEDD 70 mm vs 66 mm), and TR grade was higher. For the surgical group, in-hospital mortality was 6.6%, postoperative LOS was 11 days. No patient had predischarge MR grade ≥ 3+, and 1-year freedom from MR ≥ 3+ was excellent at 94% with 89% surviving. For the MitraClip group, in-hospital mortality was 0%, postoperative LOS was 5 days, 9.6% had predischarge MR grade  $\geq 3+$ , and 1-year freedom from MR  $\geq 3+$  was 79% with 88% surviving. At 1-year follow-up, 89% of the surgery patients were NYHA Class I/II (22% NYHA Class I). In the MitraClip group at 1-year, 84% of the patients were NYHA Class I/II (48% NYHA Class I).55 Additionally, Franzen56 reported 6-month follow-up on 50 subjects with FMR with LVEF ≤ 25%, MR ≥ 3+ and in NYHA functional Class III or IV. After a mitralclip procedure, MR ≤ 2+ was present in 92% and 30-day and 6-month mortality was 6% and 19%. There were improvements in functional class, but only mild favorable LV remodeling at 6 months. Lastly, Aurrichio<sup>57</sup> described 51 symptomatic nonresponders to CRT with FMR grade ≥ 2+ treated with a Mitralclip. They reported two procedural deaths, an additional 30-day mortality of 4.2%, and a 12-month mortality of 18%. These MitraClip reports are interesting, as there are few reports of MitraClip in subjects with FMR at high surgical risk. While none of these studies were randomized, the COAPT trial (MitraClip therapy in FMR vs GDMT) is currently underway in the United States to investigate the safety and effectiveness of the MitraClip in comparison to GDMT for FMR. The primary effectiveness endpoint is heart failure rehospitalizations at 24 months. Although the trial is not powered for mortality, this endpoint will be examined. This trial will be one of the largest studies in FMR and is expected to shape future surgical and

transcatheter FMR trials. Finally, new percutaneous devices for FMR, including annuloplasty and total mitral replacement are on the near horizon.

#### **SUMMARY**

In summary, FMR is a ventricular disease, not a valvular disease. FMR leads to a vicious cycle of LV volume overload, and progressive MR. FMR complicating CHF predicts a

poor survival. Mitral surgery, to treat FMR has been undertaken with an acceptably low operative mortality. However, one must decide on specific patient factors whether or not intervention to correct FMR is warranted in CHF patients, as a clear survival impact has not been shown compared GDMT or revascularization therapy alone. If surgery is undertaken, undersizing repairs with a complete rigid ring and valve sparing replacement is recommended. While "good" mitral repair probably leads to better LV remodeling,

patients identified to be at high risk for FMR recurrence after annuloplasty should have MV replacement. More complex mitral operations and percutaneous devices have shown promising results, but remain investigational. However, we do know that FMR is bad for CHF patients, and its elimination should be a therapeutic goal for these interesting and complex patients.
