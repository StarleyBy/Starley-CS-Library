# Minimally Invasive Aortic Valve Surgery

Prem S. Shekar • Lawrence S. Lee • Lawrence H. Cohn

Aortic valve surgery started with the implantation of the Hufnagel valve in the descending thoracic aorta in 1956. Its evolution over time has culminated with the establishment of percutaneous catheter-based aortic valve replacement techniques. As a new paradigm in aortic valve replacement is ushered, there will be new challenges for the cardiac surgeons to not only maintain the efficacy and outcomes of conventional valve replacement but to provide it in a less invasive approach. Modern techniques will be measured against conventional procedures, especially in the older patients with multiple comorbidities. Minimally invasive aortic valve surgery holds promise as an effective operation with reduced pain, improved respiratory function, early recovery, and an overall reduction in trauma.

### ESSENTIALS OF MINIMAL ACCESS AORTIC VALVE SURGERY

Reoperative minimal access aortic valve surgery is discussed in detail at the end of this chapter. We will first outline the known benefits and salient principles of and the essential ingredients for the conduct of primary minimal access aortic valve surgery. There are many potential benefits of minimal access aortic valve surgery:

- 1. It provides a cosmetically superior incision
- 2. There is reduced postoperative pain
- 3. There is faster postoperative recovery
- 4. There is improved postoperative respiratory function from preservation of a part of the sternum and the integrity of the costal margin
- It can be performed with the same degree of ease and speed as a conventional operation with no difference in mortality
- 6. It provides access to the relevant parts of the heart and reduces dissection of other areas
- 7. It greatly facilitates a reoperation at a later date as the lower part of the pericardium remains closed.

There are some salient inviolate principles of minimal access aortic valve surgery:

- 1. Ability to safely apply a stable aortic cross-clamp
- 2. Ability to visualize the aortic valve completely and perform a successful replacement with the standard techniques
- 3. Ability to achieve the same degree of myocardial protection as through a midline sternotomy approach
- 4. Ability to deal with issues of the aortic root, ascending and arch of the aorta with relative ease and without the need for conversion
- 5. Ability to quickly convert to a standard midline sternotomy if compromising situations arise

The safety and reproducibility of minimal access aortic valve surgery depend on:

- 1. Availability of experienced cardiac anesthesiologists
- 2. Availability of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in every case and an experienced echocardiographer to interpret findings
- 3. Ability to place pulmonary artery catheters with pacing capabilities and transjugular coronary sinus catheters, if and when necessary
- 4. Ability to place percutaneous arterial and venous cardiopulmonary bypass canulae
- 5. Ability to use vacuum-assisted venous drainage on cardiopulmonary bypass
- 6. Availability of minimal access retractors and other relevant instruments that facilitate this operation
- 7. Ability to remotely monitor myocardial protection and distention by TEE
- 8. Availability of surgeons experienced with conventional aortic valve surgery and minimal access surgery.

#### **APPROACHES**

Whatever the surgical approach, today aortic valve replacement is done with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass and diastolic arrest of the heart. There are at least four different minimal access surgical approaches to the aortic valve:

- 1. Upper hemisternotomy
- 2. Right parasternal approach
- 3. Right anterior thoracotomy
- 4. Transverse sternotomy

#### The Upper Hemisternotomy Approach

This is undoubtedly the most popular of all minimal access approaches to the aortic valve. 1,2 This is performed through a 6- to 8-cm vertical midline incision over the upper part of the sternum, starting at or just above the level of the manubrio-sternal angle. The sternotomy is performed with the standard saw starting at the level of the sternal notch up to the level of the third or fourth intercostal space (Fig. 32-1). The sternotomy is then T'd off into the right or left third or fourth intercostal space using a narrow blade oscillating saw, taking care not to dive too deeply with it for risk of injuring mediastinal or pericardial structures. The decision to T into the third or fourth space can be made preoperatively with the chest x-ray being a guide to the amount of exposure that will be needed. We favor the fourth interspace because this almost always produces the ideal exposure. It is very important to ensure that the sternotomy is absolutely midline and that the midline sternotomy is not carried beyond the level of the transverse T. Failure to adhere to these principles will result in either a lateral fracture with resultant three sternal fragments or a continued lower extension of midline fracture which with retraction could result in a slow ongoing intraoperative or postoperative blood loss and also difficulty in closure. There is no need to prophylactically divide the right or left internal mammary arteries with this incision. If care is taken not to damage them, they will usually gently retract away.

A small-blade retractor spreads the sternum. The pericardium is opened in the midline (Fig. 32-2), T'd inferiorly, and at least three pericardial stay sutures are applied to either side and the needles are left on. The retractor is removed and the pericardium is tacked to the dermis of the skin and tied down. This facilitates exposure by elevating the pericardial contents

forward into the operating field. The retractor is then repositioned. Care must be taken during reopening the retractor because sudden retraction with elevated cardiac structures could impede venous return, causing a sudden drop in cardiac output, and leading to acute refractory decompensation in patients with severe aortic stenosis.

We perform an epiaortic ultrasound to exclude atheromatous disease in the ascending aorta before proceeding to systemic heparinization and ascending aortic cannulation in the standard fashion. Right atrial venous cannulation is accomplished directly through the appendage (when easily accessible) (Fig. 32-3) or with a percutaneous venous cannula inserted via the right or left femoral vein. There are a variety of custom long venous canulae that are available for the same (usually 20- or 22-French), and they are inserted using the Seldinger technique. The cannula is positioned within the right atrium with the tip in the superior venacava using transesophageal echocardiographic guidance. The patient is then placed on cardiopulmonary bypass. We use tepid bypass with core cooling to 34 to 35°C. The need for vacuum-assisted venous drainage to facilitate this operation cannot be overemphasized.

A retrograde cardioplegia catheter can be placed in the coronary sinus via the right atrial appendage. This may require a minor adjustment to reduce the angulation of the catheter and its insertion can be facilitated by the use of transesophageal echocardiography. Alternatively, this catheter can be placed by the anesthesiologists before surgical incision via the transjugular route. Although we routinely use a transaortic left ventricular vent, a right superior pulmonary vein or a left atrial dome vent can also be easily placed via this incision.

**FIGURE 32-3** The pericardium has been tacked up and the patient has been canulated in the standard fashion. Oblique aortotomy has been marked.

The operation then proceeds as usual. The aorta is cross-clamped and we use 1 L of 8:1 cold blood antegrade cardioplegia. TEE is used to monitor left ventricular distention in patients who may have aortic insufficiency. Retrograde cardioplegia and additional doses of cardioplegia are administered as necessary. Standard aortic valve replacement is then carried through an oblique aortotomy (Fig. 32-4). Upon completion of the procedure, the patient is rewarmed and the aortotomy is closed. A de-airing needle is placed in the ascending aorta before removal of the aortic cross-clamp.

Almost always the heart recovers spontaneous sinus rhythm. When the heart recovers into ventricular fibrillation, it will need to be defibrillated using the external defibrillator pads placed before commencement of the operation. Defibrillation can be facilitated by turning the cardiopulmonary bypass flows down to decompress the heart and other appropriate pharmacologic maneuvers. It is usually quite difficult to introduce internal defibrillator blades through this incision, although pediatric blades can be placed successfully on occasion. Appropriate preoperative placement of external defibrillator pads are of paramount importance. The heart is de-aired using TEE guidance. In the absence of the ability to reach in and agitate the heart, a combination of ventricular filling, table positioning, and external compression is used to successfully de-air the left heart. Although this can always be successfully completed, patience may be an important tool to facilitate this. It is important remember that successful and complete de-airing does not occur until the blood has begun to circulate through the pulmonary and systemic circuits and the heart has started to eject normally.

Before emergence from bypass, pacing wires and drainage tubes will have to be placed (Fig. 32-5). It is very important to perform these placements with the heart decompressed on bypass so as to prevent injury. Invariably, there is an adequate amount of atrial and ventricular myocardium exposed to place pacing wires. We usually bring these wires out in the right inframammary area through the right-sided T. We place fluted silastic drains from a subxiphoid approach. Small incisions are made in the subxiphoid area and long grabbing forceps are used to make two retrosternal tunnels, one of which will puncture the pericardium to facilitate placement of a pericardial drain and the other will remain in the retrosternal plane. These are placed with a combination of tactile and visual control. In cases in which drains were not

placed before separation from bypass and decannulation, we recommend opening the right or left pleural space and placement of transpleural drainage tubes. Placement of sub-xiphoid drains is not recommended after the heart is full. The wean from cardiopulmonary bypass is then performed in the standard fashion followed by decannulation and protamine administration.

The pericardium is left open. While policing the area for bleeding, some of the important sites are the coronary sinus from the placement of the retrograde catheter (which will need full sternotomy conversion for control), areas of pacing wire placement and drainage tube entry (which may or may not require conversion to full sternotomy and/or institution of bypass for visualization and control), sites of left ventricular vents, the lower edge of the sternotomy/ pericardiotomy, and the internal mammary vessels on the side of the T. The sternum is closed using three or four horizontal sternal wires and an oblique wire placed between the lower intact segment of the sternum and the T'd off segment (Fig. 32-6)

Minimally invasive aortic valve replacement via the upper hemisternotomy approach was originally developed by Cosgrove and colleagues at the Cleveland Clinic<sup>1</sup> and soon after by Cohn and colleagues at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.<sup>2</sup> Johnston and Roselli<sup>3</sup> reported their results involving over 2300 patients undergoing minimally invasive aortic valve surgery over an 18-year period at the Cleveland Clinic, where upper hemisternotomy remains the preferred approach today for isolated aortic valve surgery. Mihaljevic and colleagues<sup>4</sup> from the Brigham group reported their experience with 1000 minimally invasive valve operations, of

which 526 were aortic valve procedures. They reported low levels of morbidity and mortality equal to or better than conventional techniques.

Numerous authors have published their experience with the upper hemisternotomy minimal access aortic valve replacement and most report excellent outcomes. Ghanta et al<sup>5</sup> compared outcomes and cost of minimally invasive aortic valve replacement versus conventional surgery in a multi-institutional regional cohort. They found that 93% of minimally invasive aortic valve operations were performed via upper hemisternotomy with mortality and morbidity equivalent to the full sternotomy approach. Upper hemisternotomy was also associated with decreased ventilator time, decreased blood product use, earlier discharge, and reduced total hospital cost. Gilmanov et al6 demonstrated excellent outcomes in 853 patients with low overall morbidity, low conversion rate, and comparable long-term survival to that of conventional aortic valve replacement. Upper hemisternotomy for aortic valve replacement has been performed safely in higher risk populations including elderly patients as well as those with left ventricular dysfunction, 8,9 with morbidity and mortality comparable to conventional sternotomy techniques.

Recently, the advent of sutureless aortic prostheses has further kindled interest in minimally invasive aortic valve replacement. Dalen et al<sup>10</sup> reported successful implantation of a sutureless aortic valve bioprosthesis via upper hemisternotomy in 189 patients and found no difference in cross-clamp time, cardiopulmonary bypass time, early postoperative outcomes, or 2-year survival when compared to propensity score matched patients who underwent the operation with full sternotomy. Nonrandomized multicenter clinical trials in Europe also demonstrated safe and successful minimally invasive implantation of a sutureless aortic valve prosthesis through upper hemisternotomy, albeit with slightly longer operative time than with conventional sternotomy but comparable 5-year outcomes.<sup>11</sup>

### The Right Parasternal Approach

The first foray into the world of minimal access aortic valve surgery was with use of this approach. This approach seemed to be the most logical and elegant at a time when the focus was on the morbidity of the sternotomy and surgeons were compelled to come up with this alternative.

This was performed via a vertical upper right parasternal incision. The second, third, and fourth costal cartilages were removed and the right internal mammary vessels were usually ligated and divided. It provided a similar approach to the aortic valve as an upper hemisternotomy incision described before and techniques of cannulation, cardiopulmonary bypass, myocardial protection, and valve replacement were the same. It soon gave way to the more elegant and simple upper hemisternotomy approach. One particular problem associated with the right parasternal approach was the incidence of lung herniation, which was physiologically disturbing aside from being a cosmetic disaster and

often required a second operation and mesh closure of the defect.

Cohn<sup>12</sup> and Minale et al<sup>13</sup> described their experiences with the right parasternal incision for aortic valve replacement in 1998. They reported fairly low mortality and morbidity rates and had, at that time, recommended the approach for minimal access aortic valve surgery, but soon moved to a hemisternotomy approach because of occasional right lung herniation.

## The Right Anterior Thoracotomy Approach

This is another method to perform minimal access primary aortic valve replacement in adults. The right anterior thoracotomy and the upper hemisternotomy are the most commonly used approaches to minimally invasive aortic valve surgery today.

This technique is usually performed via the second right intercostal space. Owing to the relatively high nature of the thoracotomy, it never reaches around to become a true anterolateral thoracotomy. One can visualize why this would be unappealing for a female patient because the incision would traverse horizontally across the upper part of the right breast, which could lead to scarring and disfigurement. This incision is carried to the right sternal edge and through this incision the right side of the aorta is easily visualized; and with appropriate strategically placed pericardial retraction sutures the area of interest could easily be moved into the operative field. Aortic and venous cannulation could be performed centrally or peripherally, although the latter may be preferable since the operative field is generally smaller and the aortic valve sits deeper within the wound with this approach than with a mini-sternotomy. The rest of the operation is fairly routine for any minimal access aortic valve surgery. Special cross-clamps may be required to facilitate this procedure.

This operation also has some relevance and indication for patients requiring isolated aortic valve surgery in whom sternotomy needs to be avoided at all costs. A unique subset of such patients is those who are disabled and routinely ambulate with the use of shoulder crutches. These patients could be made to ambulate early with the use of their crutches without the risk of sternal dehiscence by the use of this approach. Another possible subset of patients includes those with heavily irradiated or damaged sternum.

The exposure via this incision could be optimized in cases with poor exposure by extending it across the sternum with a transverse sternotomy through the manubrio-sternal angle. Reoperative aortic valve replacement is particularly difficult via this incision and the authors sincerely discourage the approach for a reoperation.

Glauber et al<sup>14</sup> reported their results with minimally invasive aortic valve replacement via the right anterior minithoracotomy approach in 138 patients and compared outcomes to a propensity-matched group undergoing full sternotomy. The right anterior mini-thoracotomy group was associated with lower incidence of blood transfusion and

postoperative atrial fibrillation and shorter mechanical ventilation time and hospital length of stay, with comparable perioperative morbidity. Gilmanov et al<sup>15</sup> demonstrated that minimally invasive aortic valve replacement through right anterior thoracotomy can be safely performed with acceptable mortality and morbidity in octogenarians. When compared to propensity-matched patients undergoing full sternotomy, the minimal access group had shorter time to extubation and shorter hospital stay with no difference in perioperative complications or 5-year survival rates.

As with the upper hemisternotomy approach, recently several groups have reported the successful implantation of a sutureless aortic valve prosthesis through a right anterior thoracotomy approach. Vola et al<sup>16</sup> and Gilmanov et al<sup>17</sup> demonstrated in 71 and 515 patients, respectively, that minimally invasive aortic valve replacement with various sutureless prostheses can be safely and reproducibly performed via the right anterior thoracotomy incision. Both groups observed acceptable hemodynamic outcomes and low perioperative complication rates.

### The Transverse Sternotomy Approach

There are anecdotal reports of this incision for minimal access aortic valve surgery.

Typically an 8- to 10-cm transverse incision is made over the manubrio-sternal angle extending onto either side. Bilateral second costal cartilages have to be excised and both internal mammary pedicles have to be ligated and divided. A transverse sternotomy is performed across the sternal angle. The retractor is placed and the sternal edges are retracted in a craniocaudal plane. Adequate exposure is obtained through this incision to permit central aortic cannulation and a routine aortic valve replacement; however, venous cannulation, retrograde coronary sinus catheter placement and vent placement (except transaortic) may have to be performed percutaneously.

For reasons that the mammary arteries are sacrificed, this incision never gained much popularity.

Lee et al, <sup>18</sup> De Amicis et al, <sup>19</sup> and Aris et al, <sup>20</sup> reported their small experiences with the transverse sternotomy approach and good results. However, Bridgewater et al<sup>21</sup> reported an unacceptably high incidence of morbidity (reexploration for bleeding, paravalvular leaks, and longer hospital stay) and mortality with this approach.

Karimov et al<sup>22</sup> reported a series of 85 patients who underwent an upper V-type ministernotomy in the second intercostal space with excellent results.

### REOPERATIVE MINIMAL ACCESS AORTIC VALVE SURGERY

The Brigham and Women's Hospital has pioneered minimal access reoperative aortic valve replacement in patients who previously have undergone coronary artery bypass grafting or other cardiac surgery. We popularized and published our data and have since had more experience with the technique.

According to the STS database, patients requiring a reoperative aortic valve replacement after previous coronary artery bypass grafting have a mortality risk of about 8 to 12% from the procedure. The risks are associated with the performance of a reoperation in an older patient with more comorbidities and patent/diseased bypass grafts.

### The Need for This Operation

- 1. There is a definite subgroup of patients who have undergone coronary bypass surgery who had mild or no aortic stenosis at the time of their original operation who will eventually progress to have severe aortic stenosis over time. This has sparked off a whole discussion on the management of moderate aortic stenosis with coronary artery disease<sup>23</sup>
- 2. These patients are older, sicker, and have many comorbid conditions
- 3. They need a simple, safe, and effective operation
- 4. The areas of interest are the ascending aorta and aortic root
- 5. Dissection of the rest of the heart and bypass grafts provide no additional benefit and are potentially harmful
- 6. Clipping the left internal mammary artery is not mandatory with alternative protection strategies.

### **Operative Strategy**

Preoperatively, a computed tomogram of the chest with angiography and three-dimensional reconstruction is performed to ascertain the exact location of the old bypass grafts and their relative location to the sternum (especially the left internal mammary artery). <sup>24</sup> Coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary and graft intervention with drug-eluting stents are done as appropriate to optimize the revascularization as far as possible. Heart failure is controlled medically.

All patients need intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography and a pulmonary artery catheter with atrial and ventricular pacing wire placement capabilities, which should ideally be placed before incision. Accurate placement of external defibrillator pads is emphasized because internal paddles cannot be introduced in these patients.

All patients need peripheral cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass, either right axillary or percutaneous femoral venous cannulation. Appropriate arterial line placement is needed to facilitate need for circulatory arrest and antegrade cerebral perfusion if required.<sup>25</sup>A standard upper hemisternotomy incision is made with a T into the right fourth intercostal space (Figs. 32-7 and 32-8). The anterior table split is performed with the use of an oscillating saw, whereas the posterior table split is performed on cardiopulmonary bypass using straight Mayo scissors starting from the top down (preferably from the assistant's side of the table). When the left internal mammary artery graft is close to the left side or the middle of the sternum, a preplanned one-third to

two-thirds sternotomy to the right is performed. The right pleural space is widely opened. Only 5 to 10 mm dissection is performed underneath the left sternal edge, enough to facilitate the placement of the Kuros-Baxter® retractor. The rest of the mediastinal and aortic dissection is performed on cardiopulmonary bypass. Care is taken not to injure previous saphenous vein or radial arterial bypasses. It is not necessary to visualize the left internal mammary artery graft.

Core cooling should wait until after there is an ability to place an aortic cross-clamp. Moderate-to-deep hypothermia facilitates low flow states and reduces myocardial oxygen demand, which is important because the left internal mammary artery will continue to perfuse the heart for the duration of the operation. A retrograde coronary sinus catheter is placed through the right atrial appendage using TEE guidance. Usually, enough right atrial appendage is seen to place this catheter. Alternatively, a transjugular catheter can be placed before incision. After cross-clamping the aorta, 1 L antegrade cold blood cardioplegia is delivered through the aortic root. Thereafter, 500 cc of cold retrograde blood cardioplegia is used. Simultaneously, systemic hyperkalemia is achieved by instilling 40 mEq of potassium into the cardiopulmonary bypass. Systemic hyperkalemia will achieve diastolic arrest in the left anterior descending artery territory that is perfused by the left internal mammary artery distal to the aortic cross-clamp. All through the operation, frequent doses of antegrade (through the coronaries and grafts using perfusion canulae) and retrograde cardioplegia are delivered. Systemic hyperkalemia is maintained at a level of 6 to 7 mEq/L. This keeps the myocardium fairly quiescent during the procedure. Needless to say, heavy doses of potassium may leave the patient with severe hyperkalemia that may not be cleared in the setting of renal dysfunction. In addition to being judicious in such cases, it is imperative that the perfusion technologists be able to provide ultrafiltration as well.

The aortotomy is dictated by the location of previous bypass grafts. Although in some cases a standard oblique aortotomy can be made, most cases require a modified aortotomy such as a lazy S or a lateral vertical aortotomy (Fig. 32-9). The exposure should be adequate and an expeditious valve replacement is the key to success. We aim to keep the cross-clamp time under 60 minutes. In most cases, there will be continuous back bleeding through the left main orifice from the open left internal mammary artery graft. During debridement and suture placement in the left coronary area, the bypass flows can be reduced or briefly turned off to facilitate exposure. Rewarming is started after the valve is seated. The aortotomy is closed in the standard fashion and a de-airing needle is placed before removal of the aortic crossclamp. The heart often recovers spontaneous sinus rhythm. Defibrillation is achieved via the external pads if required. The de-airing and wean from cardiopulmonary bypass is as described before.

Drainage tubes are always placed through the right pleural space. Subxiphoid placement is not possible and strongly

discouraged. Rarely, when the right pleural space is completely fused, the silastic drain could be brought out in the supraclavicular area. It may be possible to place atrial pacing wires, but placement of ventricular wires is almost always quite difficult. Routine use of pulmonary artery catheter-based pacing leads is also possible. Closure is fairly standard, as described before, and care must be taken during the placement of wires on the left side of the sternum and the oblique lower wire (Fig. 32-10).
