# Myocardial Revascularization after Acute Myocardial Infarction

Deane E. Smith III • Mathew R. Williams

Acute myocardial infarction (MI) affects approximately 1.5 million individuals each year in the United States.1 Of these patients, 30% die before reaching the hospital and another 5% die during their hospital admission.1 Since 1998, the death rate from cardiovascular disease has declined 30.6%; however, cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States.<sup>2</sup> Prompt medical attention including transport to the hospital, diagnosis, and treatment of the MI is critical to patient survival. Over the past 40 years, many developments have led to a decrease in the overall morbidity and mortality associated with acute MI. These developments include new pharmacologic agents, advancement in interventional cardiology procedures, modifications of coronary artery bypass surgical techniques, and the development of treatment algorithms and guidelines. Despite these advances, mechanical and electrical complications such as cardiogenic shock, rupture of the ventricular septum or free wall, acute mitral regurgitation, pericarditis, tamponade, and arrhythmias continue to challenge the medical community caring for patients presenting with acute MI on a daily basis.<sup>3</sup> Of these complications, cardiogenic shock complicating acute MIs has the most significant impact on in-hospital mortality and long-term survival. The loss of more than 40% of functioning left ventricular mass and its accompanying systemic inflammatory response are the major causes of cardiogenic shock. Factors that impact the development of cardiogenic shock include the degree of pre-infarct ventricular dysfunction, the size of the infarcted vessel, and pathologic level of inflammatory mediators.<sup>4,5</sup> Revascularization of threatened myocardium offers the best chance of survival following acute coronary occlusion, but the technique and timing of revascularization continue to evolve. The available therapies that can decrease the mortality associated with acute MIs include thrombolytics, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.

### PATHOGENESIS OF ACUTE OCCLUSION

Myocardial ischemia resulting from coronary occlusion causes ischemic zone changes from a state of active systolic shortening to one of passive systolic lengthening within 60 seconds of onset of ischemia.<sup>6</sup> Occlusions for less than 20 minutes usually cause reversible cellular damage and depressed function with subsequent myocardial stunning. Furthermore, reperfusion of the infarct results in variable amounts of salvageable myocardium. After 40 minutes of ischemia followed by reperfusion, 60 to 70% of the ultimate infarct is salvageable, but this decreases to approximately 10% after 3 hours of ischemia.<sup>7,8</sup> Evidence from animal model has also demonstrated that 6 hours of regional ischemia produces extensive transmural necrosis. The exact timing in humans is more difficult to analyze because of collateral flow, which is a major determinant of myocardial necrosis in the area at risk in humans.8 The collateral blood supply is extremely variable, especially in patients with long-standing coronary disease. In addition, collateral flow is jeopardized with arrhythmias, hypotension, or the rise of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure above tissue capillary pressure. Thus, loss of collateral flow to the infarct area may lead to the cellular death of salvageable myocardium, and control of blood pressure and prevention of arrhythmias are vital during this time immediately after infarction.

Table 22-1 outlines the effects of anatomic, physiologic, and therapeutic variables on the evolution of final infarct size.

# STATES OF IMPAIRED MYOCARDIUM Infarcted Myocardium

Disruption of coronary perfusion can result in three states of impaired myocardium: infarcted, hibernating, and stunned. Each state has a unique cause of injury and carries different prognostic implications (Table 22-2). Infarcted myocardium

#### **Hibernating Myocardium**

Hibernating myocardium is a state of impaired myocardial and left ventricular function at rest resulting from reduced coronary blood flow and impaired coronary vasodilator reserve that can be restored to normal if a normal myocardial oxygen supply-demand relationship is reestablished. 10 Hibernating myocardium is defined as contractility-depressed myocardial function secondary to severe chronic ischemia that improves clinically immediately after myocardial revascularization. This may be acute or chronic. Carlson and associates11 showed that hibernating myocardium was present in up to 75% of patients with unstable angina and 28% with stable angina. The entity also occurs after MI. Angina after MI commonly occurs at a distance from the area of infarction.<sup>12</sup>

#### TABLE 22-2: States of Myocardial Cells after Periods of Ischemia

| Condition         | Viability of cells | Cause of injury          | Return of function                             |
|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Infarcted         | Nonviable          | Prolonged<br>ischemia    | No recovery                                    |
| Stunned<br>viable | Limited ischemia   | Delayed with reperfusion | Recovery                                       |
| Hibernating       | Viable             | Ongoing ischemia         | Prompt, sometimes<br>unpredictable<br>recovery |

In fact, mortality is significantly higher in patients with ischemia at a distance (72%) compared with ischemia adjacent to the infarct zone (33%).12 It is the hibernating myocardium that may be in jeopardy and salvageable, although its presence is usually incidental to the occurrence of the acute infarction. By distinguishing between hibernating myocardium and irreversibly injured myocardium, a more focused approach to restoring or improving blood flow to the area at risk is possible. Ventricular function often improves immediately after revascularization of appropriately selected regions.

#### Stunned Myocardium

Stunned myocardium is left ventricular dysfunction without cell death that occurs following restoration of blood flow after an ischemic episode. The phrase was initially coined by Braunwald and Kloner in 1982.<sup>13</sup> If a patient survives the insult resulting from a temporary period of ischemia followed by reperfusion, the previously ischemic areas of cardiac muscle eventually demonstrate improved contractility. Stunning can be a fully reversible process despite the severity and duration of the insult if the cells remain viable. Within 60 seconds of coronary occlusion, the ischemic zone changes from a state of active shortening to one of passive shortening. Coronary occlusions lasting less than 20 minutes provide the classic model of the stunning phenomenon.<sup>14</sup> The most likely mechanisms of myocardial stunning are listed in Table 22-3.14,15

Stunned myocardium can occur adjacent to necrotic tissue after prolonged coronary occlusion and can be associated with demand-induced ischemia, coronary spasm, and cardioplegia-induced cardiac arrest during cardiopulmonary bypass. Pathologically, these regions are edematous, and even hemorrhagic, and can clinically present as both systolic and diastolic dysfunction.<sup>16</sup> They also have a propensity for arrhythmias, which can lead to more extensive stunning and hypotension with subsequent infarction of these regions.

The primary distinction between stunned and hibernating myocardium is that in the former blood flow has been re-established after total occlusion whereas in the latter, coronary artery obstruction and reduced blood flow are still present.<sup>7</sup>

## DIAGNOSIS OF VIABLE MYOCARDIUM

Mechanisms to identify patients with myocardial stunning and hibernation include electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, radionuclide imaging, positron emission tomography (PET), dobutamine echocardiography, and more recently magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Thallium identifies perfusion-related defects of the myocardium and can distinguish between viable and scarred myocardium as well. However, early redistribution of thallium does not distinguish between hibernating and scarred myocardium because many segments with irreversible defects by thallium improve after reperfusion. Redistribution imaging and reinjection imaging improve the predictive value of thallium imaging in distinguishing hibernating myocardium.

PET measures the metabolic activity of myocardial cells. It has high positive and negative predictive values. It is now regarded as the best method to determine myocardial

viability, particularly in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction in whom other modalities are less accurate. <sup>17</sup>

Dobutamine echocardiography identifies hibernating and stunned myocardium by monitoring changes in segmental wall motion while the heart is stressed inotropically and chronotropically by dobutamine infusion. It has high specificity, sensitivity, and more importantly, positive predictive value.<sup>18</sup>

MRI has also been established as an effective method to assess hibernating myocardium.<sup>19</sup> It has been proven to accurately diagnose the degree of both acute and chronic MI and predict functional recovery.<sup>20,21</sup> A number of advantages exist with cardiac MRI, such as superior image resolution allowing accurate identification of transmural infarction (Fig. 22-1). By providing morphologic, functional, and metabolic information, it may ultimately supplant other modalities for the diagnosis of cardiac injury and recovery.

Finally, multislice computed tomography has been used to measure hibernating myocardium, and early data suggest it

(C) Acute infarcts (*red arrows*) can be differentiated from chronic infarcts by the use of T2-weighted imaging, which can show increased signal in areas of acute necrosis (*green arrows*). (D) Post-MI sequelae such as mural thrombus (*blue arrows*) can be identified by delayed-enhancement-CMR. Long-inversion-time imaging may improve detection because the image intensity of viable myocardium is gray rather than black. Thrombus is often immediately adjacent to infarcted myocardium (*red arrows*). (E) Acute pericarditis can be diagnosed by the presence of hyperenhanced pericardium (*orange arrowheads*).

may be a reliable and sensitive method compared with MRI, although its use in clinical practice is limited.<sup>22</sup>

## MEDICAL MANAGEMENT OF MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION

Initial management of patients presenting with acute MI requires rapid diagnosis and assignment into the appropriate treatment algorithm. Treatment strategies should be directed toward reducing myocardial oxygen demand, maintaining circulatory support, and protecting the threatened myocardium before irreversible damage and expansion of the infarct occur.

Patients presenting with ongoing chest pain and ST-segment elevation in two contiguous leads or new left bundle branch block or anterolateral ST depression are classified as having ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). These patients are referred for primary revascularization, typically with fibrinolytics or percutaneous intervention in the cardiac catheterization suite, as immediately as possible assuming no contraindications exist. The other group of patients, those with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), present with chest pain at rest for 10 minutes or more and ST-segment depression greater than 0.5 mm or STsegment elevation 0.6 to 1 mm or T-wave inversions greater than 1 mm or positive troponin levels. Alternatively, there is a history of unstable angina in a patient with coronary artery disease risk factors. The initial management of these patients includes a combination of antiplatelet therapy, intravenous heparin, and other medications with a less urgent plan for cardiac catheterization. Both clinical and basic science research have demonstrated that reperfusion is the main treatment option for acute MI. Unfortunately, the majority of patients with MI receive only conservative medical management; only 40% of patients having an acute MI receive thrombolytic therapy, the most common means of reperfusion.<sup>23</sup>

Patients who present with STEMI can be further categorized by the presence or absence of cardiogenic shock. This distinction is important as it clearly predicts patient outcome, and it will impact treatment strategy. Cardiogenic shock can be defined as a systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg that is secondary to myocardial dysfunction. Clinically, it is associated with signs of hypoperfusion including decreased urine output, altered mental status, and peripheral vasoconstriction with cool extremities. Hemodynamic parameters consistent with cardiogenic shock include a cardiac index less than 2.2 L/min/m², stroke volume index less than 20 mL/m², mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure greater than 18 mm Hg, and a systemic vascular resistance of over 2400 dyn-s/cm³. These patients are defined as type IV by the Killip classification system, a widely used system to classify MIs.²4

Shock is the most common cause of in-hospital mortality after MI.<sup>25</sup> The in-hospital mortality associated with cardiogenic shock has remained unchanged at approximately 80% despite the development of new treatment modalities.<sup>26</sup> Since 1975, the incidence of cardiogenic shock complicating

Dotted lines represent 95% confidence intervals of predicted mortality.

acute MIs has remained constant at 7.5%, ranging between 5 and 15% (Fig. 22-2).<sup>25</sup> The progressive reduction in time delay from symptom onset to treatment may account for these constant figures. Previously, patients with excessive time delays would have died before reaching the hospital or soon thereafter, as treatment delays increase 1-year mortality exponentially (Fig. 22-2).<sup>27</sup>

Shock is directly related to the extent of the myocardium involved, and infarctions resulting in loss of at least 40% of the left ventricle have been found on autopsy in patients with cardiogenic shock. Autopsy findings also revealed marginal extension of the recent infarct and focal areas of necrosis in patients with cardiogenic shock. Extensive three-vessel disease is usually found in individuals with cardiogenic shock, and extension of the infarct is an important determinant in those individuals. Thus, limiting the size of the infarct and preventing its extension are the primary goals of therapeutic interventions in patients with MI.

# RATIONALE FOR AGGRESSIVE MANAGEMENT OF MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION-REPERFUSION

Randomized trials have shown beneficial effects of early reperfusion within 12 hours and possibly up to 24 hours after acute MI. 11,24,26,29 Early reperfusion clearly reduces infarct size in the major areas at risk, and controlled reperfusion may even be superior. The arguments are more difficult to make for patients outside the 24-hour window; however, patients with ongoing ischemia often have ischemic border regions that are prone to arrhythmias and necrosis. In addition, these patients are at risk for prolonged periods of hypotension with resulting end-organ injury and further left ventricular dysfunction. The benefit to early revascularization may be

greatest in those patients with cardiogenic shock. Even if revascularization does not appear critical, ventricular unloading with intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) or left ventricular assist device (LVAD) may provide the bridge to recovery needed in patients dying after MI. The primary factors limiting an aggressive surgical approach are major comorbidities, which make continuation of life undesirable or unlikely, and an unclear neurologic status, especially after a period of cardiopulmonary arrest.

Although restoration of blood flow to ischemic regions is essential, the accompanying reperfusion injury initially can worsen rather than improve myocardial dysfunction. The area at risk is affected not only by reperfusion but also by the conditions of reperfusion and the composition of the reperfusate. 30 Thus, controlling reperfusion itself may aid in reducing myocardial infarct size and ventricular injury. At the cellular level, myocardial ischemia results in a change in energy production from aerobic metabolism to anaerobic metabolism. The consequences of ischemia vary from decreased adenosine triphosphate production and increased intracellular calcium to decreased amino acid precursors such as aspartate and glutamate. These changes can be reversed only by reperfusion. However, as oxygen is reintroduced into an ischemic region, oxygen free radical generation ensues with resulting cellular damage. Cellular swelling and/or contracture can lead to a "no-reflow phenomenon" that limits the recovery of some myocytes and possibly results in irreversible injury of others. The production of oxygen free radicals during ischemia, and at the time of reperfusion, is the leading mechanism proposed to explain cellular injury. Four basic types of reperfusion injury have been described: lethal cell death, microvascular injury, stunned myocardium, and reperfusion arrhythmias (Table 22-4).

Buckberg and coworkers<sup>31-36</sup> conducted studies of controlled reperfusion after ischemia and produced a clinical application for controlled reperfusion. The surgical strategy of controlled reperfusion includes several elements. First, extracorporeal circulation is established as expeditiously as possible with venting of the left ventricle as required. Initially, antegrade cardioplegia is delivered using either a warm Buckberg solution to rebuild adenosine triphosphate stores or

cold high-potassium cardioplegia to achieve rapid diastolic arrest. Retrograde cardioplegia can be added to ensure global cooling, even in areas of active ischemia. The temperatures of the anterior and inferior walls of the ventricle are measured to ensure adequate cooling. After each distal anastomosis, cold cardioplegia is infused into each graft and the aorta at 200 mL/min over 1 minute. This is followed by retrograde infusion through the coronary sinus for 1 minute. After completion of the final distal anastomosis, warm substrate-enriched blood cardioplegia is given at 150 mL/min for 2 minutes into each anastomosis and the aorta. After removal of the aortic cross-clamp, regional blood cardioplegia is given at 50 mL/min into the graft supplying the region at risk for 18 minutes. This controlled rate of reperfusion minimizes cellular edema and myocyte damage. The proximal vein grafts are then completed, followed by reestablishment of normal blood flow. To decrease oxygen demand, the heart is allowed to beat in an empty state for 30 minutes. After this time, the patient is weaned off bypass.

Application of the Buckberg solution and technique has been shown to be effective in improving mortality rates and myocardial function after acute coronary occlusion. With ischemic times averaging 6 hours, a prevalence of multivessel disease, and cardiogenic shock, the overall mortality in patients with acute coronary occlusion who underwent surgical revascularization applying this method of reperfusion was 3.9%. Postoperative ejection fraction averaged 50%.<sup>37</sup> Surgical revascularization in this manner using controlled reperfusion compared favorably with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in several large series. These principles are reflected primarily in the surgical management of acute MI and will be outlined more specifically later in the chapter.

#### **METHODS OF REPERFUSION**

Once a patient who is a candidate for reperfusion therapy has been identified there are essentially three options available to the practitioner. They include thrombolytic therapy, primary PCI, and CABG. The intervention chosen for any particular patient will undoubtedly reflect the services that are available at the time of presentation, but they should also conform to the recommendations outlined by the ACCF/AHA guidelines including its most recent update in 2013.<sup>38</sup> The following is a review of the available therapies, their roles, and the data that exist to support their use.

#### Role of Thrombolytic Therapy

Because myocardial salvage depends on reperfusion of occluded coronary arteries, rapid dissolution of an occluding thrombus with thrombolytic therapy is an appealing intervention. Intracoronary streptokinase in patients with acute MI demonstrated that thrombolytic therapy is a safe and efficient way to achieve the desired early reperfusion.<sup>39</sup> Following this study, a number of multi-institutional megatrials showed the effectiveness of thrombolytic therapy in

treating acute MIs. The trial of the Italian Group for the Study of Streptokinase in Myocardial Infarction (Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Streptochinasi nell'Infarto Miocardio [GISSI])40 and the Second International Study of Infarct Survival [ISIS-2]41 found a reduced hospital mortality in patients treated with streptokinase. The effectiveness of tissue-type t-PA also has been evaluated in randomized studies. The Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) study<sup>42</sup> and the European Cooperative Study Group<sup>43</sup> demonstrated the effectiveness of t-PA for the treatment of acute MI. When streptokinase and t-PA were compared, two studies failed to demonstrate any difference in mortality. 44,45 A third study, however, the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) trial, supported the use of t-PA by demonstrating a more rapid and complete restoration of coronary flow that resulted in improved ventricular performance and reduce mortality. 46,47

Although thrombolysis improves survival and ventricular function the patency of infarct-related arteries is reported to be between 50 and 85%. 40-47 Normal flow should be achieved in 60% of patients by today's standards. Thrombolytic therapy works well but is not without complications, including bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage. 48 Bleeding is usually minor and occurs mostly at the sites of vascular puncture. Intracranial hemorrhage and stroke rates are approximately 1%. The relative benefits of thrombolytic therapy appear to decrease as patient age increases, and a higher risk of intracranial hemorrhage in the elderly may partially account for these findings. 46,49,50 Careful selection of patients suitable for fibrinolyite therapy is warranted, especially in an increasingly older population.

Thrombolytic therapy for patients presenting in cardiogenic shock or heart failure does not appear to improve survival in this population but may decrease the incidence of patients developing heart failure after MI.<sup>51</sup>

In summary, studies evaluating the effectiveness of thrombolytic therapy have demonstrated several useful points. First, survival is improved by decreasing time to reperfusion. The GUSTO trial showed that patients treated within the first hour had the greatest improvement in survival, with a 1% reduction in mortality for each hour of time saved. 46,47 Thrombolytic therapy is easy to administer in the community by trained personnel, although a significant risk of bleeding exists in certain patients. Because the time to reperfusion is a critical element in preserving myocardium, thrombolytic therapy is ideal for most communities without percutaneous interventional capabilities. The importance of these elements is evidenced by two points made in the updated ACCF/AHA guidelines. First, in the absence of contraindications, fibrinolytic therapy should be administered to patients with STEMI at non-PCI-capable hospitals when the anticipated first medical contact (FMC)-to-device time at a PCI-capable hospital exceeds 120 minutes because of unavoidable delays.<sup>38</sup> Second, when fibrinolytic therapy is indicated or chosen as the primary reperfusion strategy, it should be administered within 30 minutes of hospital arrival.<sup>38</sup>

#### Role of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention

Since the first reported PTCA by Gruntzig and associates<sup>52</sup> in 1979, the efficacy of this percutaneous intervention in the treatment of coronary artery disease has been well recognized. A number of studies have evaluated the efficacy of primary PTCA in the treatment of acute MI. The overall PTCA hospital mortality rates range from 6 to 9%. 53-56 Initial experience utilizing only balloon angioplasty was termed PTCA. One of the areas of technological advancement has been the development of new percutaneous therapies. These options include not only implantation of intracoronary stents, but also rotational atherectomy, directional atherectomy, extraction atherectomy, and laser angioplasty. In the current era, these techniques collectively are referred to as PCI. Here, we will use the term PTCA to relate data from studies limited to angioplasty, and the term PCI to accurately describe trials and studies that involve one or more of these additional techniques. This is consistent with the approach taken by the authors of 2001 ACCF/AHA Guidelines for PCI, which was a revision of the 1993 PTCA Guidelines.<sup>57</sup>

Several different strategies employing PCI for acute MI have been developed and examined through clinical trials. Primary, rescue, immediate, delayed, and elective PCI are options for the treatment of acute MI. Primary PCI uses percutaneous intervention as the method of reperfusion in patients presenting with acute MI. Rescue, immediate, delayed, and elective PCI are all done in conjunction with or following thrombolytic therapy. Rescue PCI is performed for recurrent angina or hemodynamic instability after thrombolytic therapy. Immediate PCI is performed in conjunction with thrombolytic therapy, and delayed PCI occurs during the intervening hospitalization. Finally, elective PCI is done following thrombolytic therapy and medical management when a positive stress test is obtained during the same hospitalization or soon thereafter.

Several studies evaluated the role of PTCA compared with thrombolytic therapy. The first study, the Primary Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction Study Group trial in 1993, concluded that immediate PTCA without thrombolytics reduced occurrence of reinfarction and death and was associated with a lower rate of intracranial hemorrhage.<sup>53</sup> Since then, more than 20 studies have compared PTCA to thrombolysis. The results from these studies have consistently and conclusively demonstrated the superiority of PTCA to thrombolysis, regardless of the thrombolytic agent used. The findings include a lower short-term mortality rate, lower rates of reinfarction, reduced stroke and intracranial hemorrhage rates, and a decreased composite end point of death, reinfarction, and stroke.<sup>58</sup> These findings have been reconfirmed on long-term follow-up. A higher overall rate of bleeding was observed, likely because of vascular access complications. Myocardial salvage is similar for PTCA and thrombolytic therapy. However, primary PTCA may be slightly less costly than thrombolytic therapy.<sup>54</sup>

The use of intracoronary stents after MI has expanded as PTCA has become more prevalent. Benefits of stenting

include lowered rates of restenosis and abrupt closure, and a reduced need for target revascularization after PTCA. Although the STENT-PAMI trail in 1999 using first-generation stents showed lower restenosis rates compared with thrombolysis, a trend toward higher mortality was seen, and its effectiveness as first-line therapy was questioned.<sup>59</sup> Composite end points of death, reinfarction, and urgent target vessel revascularization at 30 days have now been shown to be lower in subsequent studies, such as the CADILLAC, ISAR-2, and ADMIRAL trials, which employed newer-generation stents. 60-62 In these trials, a glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitor, abciximab, was added to primary stenting. A significant reduction in restenosis rates with stenting plus abciximab versus PTCA alone was evident at 12-month follow-up in the CADILLAC study (41 vs 22%).<sup>60</sup> More recent data suggest that stenting combined with antiplatelet therapy provides superior benefit to PTCA alone. Drug-eluting stents offer the potential to lower restenosis rates even further through the use of anti-inflammatory medication delivered via the stent. More recently, patients in the STRATEGY trial treated with drug-eluting stents after acute STEMI had a significantly lower composite end point of death, reinfarction, stroke, and angiographic evidence of restenosis at 8-month follow-up compared with bare-metal stenting plus abciximab (50 vs 19%).<sup>63</sup> Using propensity score matching, retrospective analysis of patients post-acute MI in Massachusetts has shown a slight 2-year mortality benefit for drug-eluting stents when compared with bare-metal stents (10.7 vs 12.8%), as well as a lower need for repeat revascularization.<sup>64</sup> Further prospective studies are under way to determine if long-term data confirm these findings.

The optimal pharmacotherapy for these patients continues to be debated and is an area of ongoing investigation. Initial experience with heparin was believed to be improved by the addition of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors. 65 However, routine use of GP IIb/IIIa inihibitors has fallen out favor, and current guidelines recommend limiting their use to high-risk situations. The HORIZONS-AMI (Harmonizing Outcomes with Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial<sup>66,67</sup> compared bivalirudin, a direct thrombin inhibitor, with heparin plus a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor for use after primary PTCA with or without stenting. The data disclosed decreased 30-day major bleeding events, death from cardiac causes, and death from all causes, despite a higher 24-hour risk of stent thrombosis in the bivalirudin cohort. Interestingly the mortality benefit persisted after 3-year follow-up. Since this trial, there have been several changes in management strategy including newer antiplatelets, increased radial access, and decreased use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors. A similar trial comparing bivalirudin to heparin plus GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors, the EUROMAX trial, demonstrated a decrease in incidence of major bleeding at 30 days but no difference in mortality or reinfarction.<sup>68</sup> More recently, results of the HEAT PPCI (How Effective are Antithrombotic Therapies in Primary PPCI) trial were released. This was an open-label, randomized trial of STEMI patients which compared heparin with bivalirudin and used GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors only in

bail out situations. Heparin was associated with a significant reduction in the major cardiovascular end points of all-cause mortality, cerebrovascular accidents, reinfarction, and target vessel revascularization (5.7 vs 8.7%, p = .01).<sup>69</sup> In addition, there was no significant difference in the rate of major bleeding (3.5 vs 3.1%, p = .59). This study, along with others (NAPLES III, BRAVE IV), have raised significant questions regarding the benefit to using bivalirudin as opposed to heparin.<sup>70,71</sup>

Primary PCI may play a greater role in patients presenting in cardiogenic shock, as percutaneous interventions have become more common over the past 10 years (Fig. 22-3). The GISSI-1 and GISSI-2 trials demonstrated no benefit from intravenous thrombolysis, with morality rate of 70%. 40,44 In patients presenting in or developing cardiogenic shock after acute MI, PTCA improved survival to 40 to 60%.72 This improvement was even greater when angioplasty was successful, as in-hospital survival rates increased to 70%. In most of these series an IABP was used in conjunction with PTCA. The SHOCK trial showed that revascularization by PTCA or CABG within 12 hours of the onset of cardiogenic shock results in improved 1- and 6-year survival rates versus medical stabilization followed by delayed revascularization (32.8 for PTCA/CABG vs 19.6% for initial medical stabilization, 6-year follow-up) in this high-risk group, particularly for those under the age of 75 years (Fig. 22-4). 11,26,29 Subgroup analysis in patients undergoing successful PTCA or with TIMI Grade 3 coronary flow after PTCA in the SHOCK trial revealed that 1-year survival was even higher, at 61%.<sup>73</sup> Independent predictors of mortality include age, hypotension, lower TIMI flow, and multivessel PTCA.

In conclusion, specialized centers that have 24-hour catheterization facilities can provide primary PCI as a first-line therapy for patients with acute MI. Patients with established or developing cardiogenic shock should be revascularized early by PCI rather than initial medical stabilization with thrombolytic therapy. Rescue PCI after failed thrombolytic

therapy for patients with ongoing ischemia or clinical compromise is also recommended. Finally, elective PCI should be performed on patients who have recurrent or provokable angina before hospital discharge.

#### Role of Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting

The role of surgical revascularization in the treatment of acute MI has changed considerably over the past 30 years. During the 1980s, reports appeared recommending surgical revascularization in preference to medical therapy for acute MI.74,75 Mortality rates under 5% were reported. Critics argued that these studies lacked randomization or consecutive entry of patients, preoperative stratification was absent, and enzyme levels were not included. Inherent bias that favored surgery in low-risk patients was believed to be the reason for the excellent outcomes. 76 At the time these reports surfaced, thrombolytic therapy and interventional cardiology were emerging as alternative options for patients with acute infarctions. With the availability of thrombolytics and PCI, large multicenter trials began looking at the efficacy and usefulness of these two techniques. Randomized trials using CABG were not done, and thus this option was never established as an alternative for acute MI. Despite this, several centers continued to use surgical revascularization to treat acute MI with excellent results. However, practical, logistic, and economic constraints relegate surgical revascularization to a third option behind thrombolytics and PCI for the primary treatment of acute MI.

There continue to be several scenarios that require emergent or urgent surgical revascularization. Failure of thrombolytics or PCI with acute occlusion may require surgical intervention. Additionally, CABG for post-infarction angina has become a critical step in the pathway of treating acute MI. Finally, surgical revascularization may be indicated in

patients with multivessel disease or left main coronary artery disease developing cardiogenic shock after MI.

#### **Timing after Infarction**

If surgical revascularization within 6 hours after the onset of symptoms is feasible, the mortality rate is improved over that of medically treated, nonrevascularized patients. Although these early studies were not controlled and were criticized for selection bias, they did demonstrate that surgical revascularization may be performed with an acceptable mortality in the presence of acute MI with improved myocardial protection, anesthesia, and surgical techniques. However, with the advent of thrombolytic therapy, PCI, and an aging population, the surgical patient we encounter today bears little resemblance to the patient population represented in these early studies.

Previous analyses of the New York State Cardiac Surgery Registry, which included every patient undergoing a cardiac operation over more than a decade in the state of New York, resulted in valuable information regarding the optimal timing of CABG in acute MI. In this large and contemporary patient population, there is a significant correlation between hospital mortality and time interval from acute MI to time of operation, particularly if CABG was performed within 1 week of acute MI. In addition, patients with transmural and nontransmural acute MI have different trends in mortality when the time course is taken into consideration. Mortality for the nontransmural group peaked if the operation was performed within 6 hours of acute MI, and then decreased precipitously (Table 22-5).<sup>77</sup> On the other hand, mortality for the transmural group remained high during the first 3 days before returning to baseline.<sup>78</sup> Multivariate analyses confirmed that CABG within 6 hours for the nontransmural group and 3 days for the transmural group were independently associated

with increased in-hospital mortality.<sup>77,78</sup> Optimal timing of CABG in patients with acute MI remains a controversial subject. Early surgical intervention has the advantage of limiting the infarct expansion and ventricular remodeling that may result in possible ventricular aneurysm and rupture.<sup>79</sup> However, there is the theoretical risk of reperfusion injury, which may lead to hemorrhagic infarction resulting in extension of infarct size, poor infarct healing, and scar development.<sup>80</sup> The data from these studies caution against early surgical revascularization, particularly within 3 days of onset, among patients with acute transmural MI.

Some have advocated the use of mechanical support to stabilize the patient and allow elective rather than emergent surgery.81,82 Delaying CABG with "prophylactic" mechanical support in an effort to improve outcome, however, may result in placement of such support in some situations where it is unnecessary. If revascularization cannot be delayed, aggressive mechanical support (such as an LVAD) should be available because mortality is most likely a result of pump failure. Furthermore, mechanical circulatory support (MCS) has been shown to be efficacious as a bridge to ventricular recovery or transplantation for this patient cohort.<sup>82</sup> This approach is supported by results from a multicenter study, in which overall survival at 6 and 12 months was higher in patients who underwent direct LVAD implantation rather than revascularization followed by LVAD, in patients suffering cardiogenic shock (Fig. 22-5).83 Although emergent cases such as structural complications and ongoing ischemia clearly cannot be delayed, nonemergent cases, particularly patients with transmural acute MI, may benefit from delay of surgery. Early surgery after transmural acute MI has a significantly higher risk and surgeons should be prepared to provide aggressive cardiac support including LVADs in this ailing population.

#### **Risk Factors**

In addition to timing of surgery as discussed, risk factors include urgency of the operation, increasing patient age, renal insufficiency, number of previous MIs, hypertension, 84

reoperation, cardiogenic shock, depressed left ventricular function, and the need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation, left main disease, female gender, left ventricular wall motion score, need for IABP, and transmural infarction. <sup>85</sup> Characteristics associated with better early outcome after MI include preservation of left ventricular ejection fraction, male gender, younger patients, and subendocardial versus transmural MI.

#### Cardiogenic Shock

Surgical revascularization in acute MI complicated by cardiogenic shock has been shown to improve survival. Cardiogenic shock is accompanied by 80 to 90% mortality rates. The various mechanisms of cardiogenic shock in acute MI are shown in Fig. 22-6. DeWood and colleagues<sup>86</sup> were the first to demonstrate improved results with revascularization in patients with cardiogenic shock complicating acute MI. Patients who were stabilized with an IABP and underwent emergent surgical revascularization was associated with survival rates of 40 to 88% in patients in cardiogenic shock from nonmechanical causes. Guyton and coworkers<sup>87</sup> reported an 88% in-hospital survival and a 3-year survival of 88%, with no late deaths reported.

Furthermore, the SHOCK trial demonstrated survival benefit in early revascularization by CABG or PTCA within 12 hours of the diagnosis of cardiogenic shock for patients of all ages. Patients comprising the CABG cohort in the SHOCK trial had more severe disease, with higher rates of three-vessel disease, left main coronary artery disease, diabetes, and elevated mean coronary jeopardy scores than the PTCA cohort. PCA Despite this, 87.2% of these patients achieved successful and complete revascularization with CABG, compared with successful revascularization in 77.2% with PTCA and only 23.1% with complete revascularization with PTCA. Overall,

mortality was no different between groups at 1 year (Fig. 22-7). On subgroup analysis, patients older than age 75 years, with left main coronary disease or three-vessel disease, or with diabetes had trends toward better survival at 30 days and 1 year after CABG compared to PTCA. Thus, for patients in cardiogenic shock, surgical revascularization remains an established and viable option for select patient groups.

#### Advantages of Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting

Reported survival rates are similar for CABG and PCI in the treatment of acute MI. To date, there have been no large, randomized clinical trials comparing CABG with PCI and thrombolytics after MI. For patients with stable angina and elective revascularization for ischemic heart disease, a number of trials have been conducted comparing CABG with stenting. 89-92 In these studies, trends favoring CABG for multivessel disease were seen after 2 years in composite cardiac event end points, rate of reinfarction, and mortality; revascularization rates were five times higher in the stenting group. 93 Most notably, survival after CABG for two or more diseased vessels was significantly higher than stenting with 2-year follow-up in a retrospective study of the New York Cardiac Surgery Reporting System and Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Reporting System. 94 These results must be interpreted with

![](_page_9_Figure_7.jpeg)

**FIGURE 22-7** Kaplan-Meier survival estimates at 96 hours (A), 30 days (B), and 1 year (C) in patients treated with emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus emergency coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) in the SHOCK trial.

caution; however, as patients with acute infarctions less than 24 hours pretreatment were excluded. Because of the lack of prospective, randomized trials, recommendations must be based on retrospective and observational studies.

CABG does offer a few potential advantages. First, surgical revascularization is the most definitive form of treatment of the occlusion. CABG offers the longest patency of revascularized stenotic and occluded arteries; in elective cases, more than 90% of internal mammary artery grafts are patent at 10 years.

Second, CABG also offers more complete revascularization, because all vessel lesions are treated. This concept becomes especially important in patients with multivessel disease or those in cardiogenic shock, in whom remote myocardium may continue to be comprised with only "culprit vessel" revascularization and inadequate restoration of collateral flow.<sup>95</sup> A complete revascularization restores global myocardial perfusion to normal levels and offers the best chance for myocardial salvage. Finally, there is the opportunity for controlled reperfusion to reverse ischemic injury and reduce reperfusion injury.

#### **Summary**

Surgical revascularization following acute MI can be performed with excellent results when the timing and patient cohort are appropriate. Most patients do not need such measures and would not benefit from this aggressive form of therapy. However, patients with mechanical complications, those in cardiogenic shock, and those with post-infarction angina are likely to benefit from early CABG.

## OPERATIVE TECHNIQUES FOR ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION

#### **Anesthesia**

Anesthesia is provided by a rapid narcotics-based regimen with perfusion and surgical teams prepared to respond to catastrophic hypotension or cardiac arrest. Transesophageal echo probes are placed in these patients if possible.

#### Bleeding

Bleeding is a significant complication of emergency CABG and can result in further myocardial depression and pulmonary hypertension. Cytokine release induced by infusion of blood products and thromboxane A2 released as a result of cardiopulmonary bypass stimulate pulmonary hypertension, which can be catastrophic in the setting of right ventricular ischemia. Use of antifibrinolytics, such as aminocaproic acid, for re-operative, emergency, or high-risk CABG is common in many institutions.

The use of clopidogrel deserves special mention, and its expanding administration can pose unique problems for the cardiac surgeon. Clopidogrel, an oral, irreversible antagonist of the 5'-adenosine diphosphate that inhibits platelet activation and aggregation, is used extensively in patients with acute coronary syndromes and has been shown to lower cardiovascular risk by up to 20% and reduce reinfarction and stroke rates. 96,97 In addition, it is commonly given before percutaneous interventions and after intracoronary stenting to prevent thrombosis. Higher loading doses have been used with increasing efficacy against ischemic complications, which will likely expand its use in the future. 98 However, patients frequently require surgical revascularization after medical therapy or cardiac catheterization while taking

clopidogrel. The risk of bleeding after clopidogrel and cardiac surgery can be substantial. In multiple reports, the risk of reoperation for hemorrhage in patients receiving clopidogrel within 7 days of cardiac surgery was six times higher, and patients required more blood, platelet, and fresh-frozen plasma transfusions. <sup>99,100</sup> Because of these complication rates and the inability to reverse the drug's effect on platelets, surgery is often delayed until platelet function is restored, which may take up to 7 days, or the life of the platelets. Emergent surgery while taking clopidogrel often necessitates blood product transfusions and confers significant morbidity, and possibly mortality. Ongoing work continues in an effort to determine if current dosing regimens after acute MI can be reduced to lessen bleeding complications.

#### **Choice of Conduits**

For emergency cases, the choice of conduit should usually not differ from elective cases in most circumstances. The internal mammary artery is not associated with a higher number of complications compared with saphenous vein grafting in emergent situations and can be used in most circumstances. <sup>101,102</sup>

#### Intraoperative Considerations

Decompression of the ventricle during revascularization after acute coronary occlusion decreases muscle damage and improves functional outcome by decreasing wall tension and reducing oxygen consumption (Figs. 22-8 and 22-9).<sup>36</sup> In fact, ventricular decompression reduces metabolic energy consumption by 60%. Diastolic basal arrest, by avoiding the energy of contraction, is the second most important means of minimizing oxygen consumption and further reduces metabolic energy consumption by 30%. Cooling of the patient and heart has an impact on the final 10% of basal energy requirements. Reduction of myocardial energy consumption is best

achieved by early institution of cardiopulmonary bypass to maintain a high perfusion pressure. If a coronary salvage catheter has been placed across a tight coronary lesion, the catheter is left in place until just before cross-clamping. Antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia catheters are placed before cross-clamping to allow quick instillation of retrograde cardioplegia and protection of the territory supplied by the occluded or

compromised vessel. The standard Buckberg protocol is followed, including warm induction to allow regeneration of depleted adenosine triphosphate stores. If the territory at risk is to be grafted by saphenous vein, this anastomosis is performed first to allow direct instillation of cardioplegia into the territory at risk. The proximal anastomoses should be performed before removal of the cross-clamp to allow complete perfusion of the entire heart upon removal of the cross-clamp.

Although large ventricular aneurysms are treated by resection and patch, debate surrounds smaller aneurysm. If an aneurysm is resected, the defect is repaired with a patch of bovine pericardium sewn to the fibrotic rim of the endoaneurysm surface. The native left ventricular wall is closed over the patch.

Utilization of the Dor procedure (endoventricular circular patch plasty repair) in the post MI setting is another controversial subject. Some data have shown that surgical remodeling improves systolic function, ejection fraction, and intraventricular dyssynchrony, whereas other data suggest no additional benefit when the Dor procedure is added to CABG. 103-106 Further investigation is needed to definitively answer this question.

#### Postoperative Care

A higher incidence of complications in shock patients compared with non-shock emergencies has been reported. Guyton and associates<sup>87</sup> report a 47% complication rate associated with cardiogenic shock compared with 13% for patients with non-shock emergencies. This increase in complications probably reflects the preoperative condition of the patients as much as the treatment itself. Long-term follow-up in patients after emergency surgical revascularization shows that survival rates are closely correlated with postoperative ejection fraction and left ventricular size. <sup>107,108</sup>

## USE OF THE INTRA-AORTIC BALLOON PUMP

The early use of aortic counterpulsation with an IABP demonstrated the safety but not efficacy of this device for patients in cardiogenic shock following acute MI. <sup>109</sup> Although survival was not improved, aortic counterpulsation did improve the myocardial oxygen requirements and myocardial energetics were reduced in patients in shock.

Over the last several decades, multiple studies have been performed to help define the role for IABP in acute MI. Early reports demonstrated that aortic counterpulsation decreased the reocclusion rate, recurrent ischemia, and need for emergency PCI in patients who had coronary patency reestablished by emergency cardiac catheterization after acute MI. Prophylactic counterpulsation for 48 hours sustained patency in these patients without increasing vascular or hemorrhagic complications. However, additional randomized trials have been performed which have questioned the advantage of IABP in cardiogenic shock secondary to MI. Recently, the ACC/AHA guidelines have downgraded the recommendation for IABP use in cardiogenic shock from a Class I to Class IIa

recommendation.<sup>38</sup> The IABP-Shock II Trial randomized patients with cardiogenic shock complicating acute MI who were undergoing early revascularization and optimal medical therapy to IABP versus control.<sup>112</sup> The 30-day outcomes showed no survival benefit with IABP support. In addition, these patients were subsequently followed for 6-month and 12-month follow-up to determine the long-term impact of IABP support. There was no significant difference in mortality, reinfarction, repeat revascularization or stroke.<sup>113</sup>

For patients who undergo early revascularization, the empiric addition of aortic counterpulsation with an IABP will not improve the patient's outcome; however, the IABP remains a useful adjunct for patients who are awaiting revascularization or continue to show signs of ischemia after revascularization. Placement of an IABP is also reasonable in patients who remain in cardiogenic shock despite adequate revascularization and optimal medical management if it may aid in stabilizing a patient for more definitive therapy, that is, mechanical circulatory support (MCS). The use of IABP is also effective for temporary hemodynamic stabilization in complications of acute MI, such as ventricular septal rupture, acute mitral valve insufficiency, 114 post-infarct angina, 115 ventricular arrhythmias, 116 and acute heart failure following infarction. 117

# ROLE OF MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY SUPPORT

One area of ongoing development involves the use of MCS for cardiogenic shock. Mechanical assist devices augment systemic perfusion and prevent end-organ damage while resting the stunned ventricle with complete or partial pressure-volume unloading.<sup>118</sup> Early studies of implantable LVADs have shown that end-organ function is an early predictor of mortality. Treatment of patients before end-organ deterioration is essential to improving the odds for long-term survival. In addition to affecting end-organ function, assist devices promote "reverse remodeling" by improving myocardial contractility and calcium handling, altering the extracellular matrix, and decreasing myocardial fibrosis. 119,120 Recent studies have shown that circulatory support early after MI improves survival and offers a feasible bridge to recovery or transplantation.82,121 Although still in its early stages, many institutions are working to develop the optimal strategy for adding MCS to their treatment algorithms for ACS. There are essentially three categories of MCS available, and the choice of type of support depends on a number of variables.

VA-ECMO is one option available for MCS in acute MI patients. Its primary use is in cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest after acute MI, as it can often be placed rapidly and without moving the patient. There may be additional benefits to inserting cannulas under fluoroscopic-guidance while the patient is in the cath lab. Because it can be performed expeditiously, it is a useful first-line MCS therapy for these patients.

Another option available in this situation is percutaneous VADs. These include the Impella 2.5, CP or 5.0 (Abiomed

Europe GmbH, Aachen, German), the TandemHeart (Cardiac Assist, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), and the Hemopump (Johnson & Johnson, Racho Cordova, CA, USA). These are also devices that can be implanted percutaneously in the cath lab to augment cardiac output in patients undergoing post-infarct PCI. The TandemHeart provides up to 4 L/min of support, producing a higher mean blood pressure and cardiac output, and lowering pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Likewise, the Impella device can provide between 2.5 L/min and 5 L/min depending on the model, and in small series, may offer superior hemodynamic support when compared with an IABP. 123

Finally, another more invasive option for mechanical support in post-MI patients involves implantable VADs. Again, there are multiple reports utilizing different types of VADs in this particular situation. These include ABIOMED ventricular support system (Abiomed, Inc., Danvers, MA, USA), the Thoratec paracorporeal system (pVAD), the Thoratec Centrimag Blood Pump (Thoratec Corp., Pleasnaton, CA, USA), and the Syncardia ventricular support system (Syn Cardia Systems, Inc., Tucson, AZ, USA). An important consideration when selecting a device is whether there is likely to be recovery of adequate ventricular function or not. If there is an expectation of recovery, or if the plan is for surgical revascularization at the time of ventricular support, then a temporary LVAD would be the more reasonable approach. If the patient is unable to be weaned from their temporary LVAD, then a long-term device remains an option. Likewise, if the patient's ventricular function is not expected to recover, and in particular, if there are no plans for revascularization, then proceeding with a long-term LVAD may be the best course. Another factor that is part of this algorithm is whether the patient is potentially a transplant candidate or not. There are many variables which may impact the feasibility of this strategy, and some of them are exclusive of the patient's overall condition. For example, the patient's gender, size, blood type, and local allocation limitations will all impact the expected waiting times, and may preclude transplant as a viable option without long-term mechanical support. The decision-making in these instances involves a multidisciplinary team to optimize resource utilization for these patients. Enthusiasm for using mechanical support to help patients survive their acute infarcts is growing at many institutions across the country. With the development and refinement of these techniques and the ability to fit the right strategy to the right patient, we expect outcomes to improve for this group of critically ill patients. A full discussion of short-term and long-term MCS is reported in Chapters 18 and 66.

#### **SURGICAL MANAGEMENT**

The use of MCS in the setting of an acute MI is continuing to evolve. Many patients with an acute MI requiring consideration for mechanical support are in a state of uncertainty. They are by definition, unstable, and many will have already received, or will be in the process of receiving CPR. The status of their end-organ function and their neurologic

function is unclear. In these situations, one option is to utilize peripheral VA-ECMO in an attempt to stabilize the patient. This can usually be done in the catheterization lab either via a percutaneous or cut-down technique. Femoral artery and venous cannulas are placed and the patient is connected to the ECMO circuit. Flow is initiated to provide as much cardiac output as possible. With adequate flow to maintain a normal cardiac output, vasoactive medications, including pressors and inotropes, can be weaned. There are several advantages to this approach. First, it allows clinicians the opportunity to assess the patient's neurologic function before embarking on a more invasive procedure or long-term support. The patient can wake up and undergo a complete neurologic evaluation while on VA-ECMO support. This is most important for patients who have received CPR prior to initiation of MCS. Second, VA-ECMO preserves, and in some cases, allows recovery of the endorgan function as patients can typically be weaned off of inotropes and pressors entirely. Again, this is an important part of the algorithm as preserved end-organ function will greatly improve the likelihood that a patient will survive the additional steps needed to bridge the patient to recovery, a long-term LVAD, or transplantation. Initiation of peripheral VA-ECMO can also decompress the heart and allow an opportunity for recovery. With the heart decompressed, there is less wall tension and stress, primarily, on the right ventricle. Although there is increased afterload on the left ventricle with VA-ECMO, there are several strategies designed to decompress the left side and allow the myocardium to recover. An in-depth discussion regarding options to assist in decompressing the left ventricle on VA-ECMO is beyond the scope of this chapter, but these options include inotropes, IABP, Impella, and surgical vents.

If patients have survived the initial event with VA-ECMO support, then they can proceed to the next step which is an evaluation for signs of myocardial recovery and a determination of the need for long-term mechanical support (Fig. 22-10). The patients have usually already received a coronary angiogram, and if feasible, an attempt at PCI. If the myocardium has recovered the patients can be weaned from ECMO and decannulated. However, if they fail to wean, then a determination of their candidacy for a long-term LVAD or transplant is made. The decision to place a longterm LVAD is influenced by many factors, but can be summarized by their score on a screening scale designed for this purpose (Table 22-6). These scores were selected to identify end-organ dysfunction (lung, liver, or kidney) and operative constraints (right-sided heart failure and bleeding). Excellent results have been reported with nearly a 90% survival if the summed scores are less than 5 points, versus 30% survival with summed scores greater than 5 points. 124 For this reason, if the total score is greater than 5 points, an attempt is made to improve end-organ function before attempting long-term LVAD insertion.

These algorithms continue to be refined as experience with mechanical support grows. Utilizing a short-term option such as VA-ECMO or a nonimplantable LVAD to stabilize the

patient, preserve their end-organs, and ensure adequate neurologic function has been an important advancement in the care of these critically ill patients. Identifying which patients will benefit most from implantation of long-term devices is an area of ongoing investigation.

#### **CONSENSUS GUIDELINES**

The initial evaluation and management of a patient suffering from a MI begins before the patient arrives to the hospital. First responders in the field are trained to perform the initial ECG, and initiate treatment algorithms based upon these findings and the overall condition of the patient. Throughout the literature, this point of contact marks the time of FMC, which will impact the steps that follow.

Based upon the definitions as previously stated, patients are categorized as either STEMI or NSTEMI. Patients who meet criteria for STEMI are evaluated for urgent or immediate reperfusion. Again, the approach for reperfusion will depend upon the patient's location and the medical resources available to them at their destination hospital.

The recent executive summary update to the STEMI guidelines has attempted to outline these issues (regional systems of STEMI care, reperfusion therapy, and time-to-treatment goals) with the following Class I recommendations<sup>38</sup>:

- 1. Performance of a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) by emergency medical services personnel at the site of first medical contact (FMC) is recommended in patients with symptoms consistent with STEMI
- 2. Reperfusion therapy should be administered to all eligible patients with STEMI with symptom onset within the prior 12 hours
- 3. Primary PCI is the recommended method of reperfusion when it can be performed in a timely fashion by experienced operators
- 4. Emergency medical services transport directly to a PCI-capable hospital for primary PCI is the recommended triage strategy for patients with STEMI, with an ideal FMC-to-device time system goal of 90 minutes or less
- 5. Immediate transfer to a PCI-capable hospital for primary PCI is the recommended triage strategy for patients with STEMI who initially arrive at or are transported to a non-PCI-capable hospital, with an FMC-to-device time system goal of 120 minutes or less
- 6. In the absence of contraindications, fibrinolytic therapy should be administered to patients with STEMI at non-PCI-capable hospitals when the anticipated FMC-to-device time at a PCI-capable hospital exceeds 120 minutes because of unavoidable delays
- 7. When fibrinolytic therapy is indicated or chosen as the primary reperfusion strategy, it should be administered within 30 minutes of hospital arrival

An additional class IIa recommendation is as follows:

1. Reperfusion therapy is reasonable for patients with STEMI and symptom onset within the prior 12 to 24 hours who have clinical and/or ECG evidence of ongoing ischemia. Primary PCI is the preferred strategy in this population

These strategies are outlined in Fig. 22-10.

In summary, the initial decision making involves a determination of the expected time from FMC to revascularization

by PCI. If the FMC-to-device time is expected to be greater than 120 minutes, then it is recommended that patients receive fibrinolytics. The next step in the algorithm was evaluated by the TRANSFER-AMI trial. Here, patients who had received fibrinolytics were randomized to either standard treatment (which included rescue PCI, if required) or a strategy of immediate transfer to another hospital and PCI within 6 hours of fibrinolysis. At 30 days, patients assigned to routine early PCI had a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of the primary end point which was the composite of death, reinfarction, recurrent ischemia, new or worsening congestive heart failure, or cardiogenic shock (11.0 vs 17.2%). Thus, this trial supports an aggressive approach to transferring patients for PCI even after receiving thrombolytics for an acute MI.

The same Executive Summary of STEMI Guidelines included recommendations regarding surgical therapy.<sup>38</sup>

Class I recommendations include:

- 1. Urgent CABG is indicated in patients with STEMI and coronary anatomy not amenable to PCI who have ongoing or recurrent ischemia, cardiogenic shock, severe heart failure, or other high-risk features
- 2. CABG is recommended in patients with STEMI at time of operative repair of mechanical defects

Class IIa recommendations include:

1. The use of mechanical circulatory support is reasonable in patients with STEMI who are hemodynamically unstable and require urgent CABG

Class IIb recommendations include:

1. Emergency CABG within 6 hours of symptom onset may be considered in patients with STEMI who do not have cardiogenic shock and are not candidates for PCI or fibrinolytic therapy

#### **FUTURE THERAPIES AND TRENDS**

Improving outcomes in patients suffering acute MI can occur through pharmacologic advances, optimization of existing practices, and application of new technology. Various medications have been described that reduce ischemic-reperfusion injury and limit infarct size in animal models, such as oxygen-derived free radical scavengers, folic acid, nitric oxide inhibitors, and others<sup>126</sup>; clinical study of these promising drugs will determine their efficacy. Reducing transport time to the hospital after the onset of symptoms and implementation of clinical guidelines have been the focus of many hospitals and emergency services. The increased number of local hospitals able to perform primary percutaneous interventions has meant quicker revascularization and thus improved outcomes.<sup>27</sup> In addition, the technology used to treat these patients continues to improve. New wires, catheters, balloons, and stents continue to be developed and improved upon compared with previous generations. Furthermore, the optimization of the medical treatment of these patients is an area of ongoing research and development. Improved antiplatelet and anticoagulation strategies are just one example. With more experience, widely available guidelines have been developed and published in an effort to standardize care for all patients across the country, regardless of where they present. This will also allow for better data collection and assessment and comparisons, and ultimately improvement in strategies.

Surgically, we continue to develop and improve our techniques for surgical revascularization. This includes advances in myocardial protection, and refinements in the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit to limit the physiologic insult of surgery. MCS has advanced greatly over the past 10 years, and pumps have become smaller, safer, less invasive, easier to use, and easier to implant. In addition, patients who remain in cardiogenic shock despite inotropes and revascularization are being identified as candidates for MCS. There is likely to be continuing review of the role of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation in the management of STEMI with cardiogenic shock. Another area for investigation includes the optimal timing for surgical revascularization should percutaneous options fail or be unavailable. The availability of MCS backup, may allow for successful surgical revascularization and recovery in patients previously deemed not operative candidates because of their high surgical risk.

Finally, the rapidly emerging field of cellular therapy holds great promise for repair of damaged myocardium. A number of cell types, such as endothelial progenitor cells, mesenchymal stem cells, skeletal myoblasts, resident cardiac stem cells, and embryonic stem cells, are being investigated<sup>127</sup>; the optimal cell type, mode of delivery (intracoronary artery infusion, intravenous infusion, transendocardial injection, and transepicardial injection), and timing of administration have yet to be determined. Nevertheless, early clinical trials suggest that cellular therapy may offer benefits. One-year follow-up of 59 patients suffering acute MI in the TOPCARE-AMI trial who received either circulating progenitor cells or bone marrowderived progenitor cells demonstrated increased cardiac function and reduced ventricular dimensions, without adverse events. 128 Precultured mesenchymal cells also offer great promise by allowing cells from an unrelated donor to be administered without the complications of an individual tissue harvest. The safety of these cells given intravenously after percutaneous revascularization in acute MI was recently published, and efficacy studies are ongoing. 129 Numerous other clinical trials are underway to address questions regarding mechanisms of benefit, cell viability, and dosing. Further randomized clinical trials will be required to establish outcome benefit.

Effective management of acute MI requires a well-coordinated plan that starts with first medical contact. Rapid diagnosis and transport to the appropriate institution in the first step. If the diagnosis is an ST-elevation MI, then the priority is reperfusion. Depending on the available resources, this will require transport to a facility with emergency-PCI capabilities. If this is not possible, then thrombolytics should be administered if there are not contraindications. If either of these options are not available, or are unsuccessful, the patient should undergo an evaluation for emergency CABG.

The initial management is the same in patients who are in cardiogenic shock; however, facilities managing these patients should have available means of providing additional support. If a reperfused patient remains in shock despite inotropes, pressors, and an IABP, consideration should be given to pursuing MCS.
