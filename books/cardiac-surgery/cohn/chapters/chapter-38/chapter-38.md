# Surgical Treatment of Mitral Valve Endocarditis

Gösta B. Pettersson • Syed T. Hussain

Mitral valve infective endocarditis (IE) is one of the more devastating complications of mitral valve disease, and if left untreated, it is universally fatal, like any other form of IE. In surgical practice, mitral valve endocarditis is usually less common than aortic valve endocarditis, with most infections occurring in native mitral valves. Although the distribution of causes of mitral valve dysfunction has changed in recent years, the overall incidence of IE has increased during the past 3 decades.<sup>1-6</sup> Rheumatic valve disease, which was a frequent predisposing factor to IE in the 1980s, is now rare in industrialized nations.<sup>6-7</sup> Predisposing factors more frequently encountered today, several of which are consequences of advances that characterize modern medicine, 1-7 include degenerative valvular disease, prosthetic valves, other intravascular prostheses and devices, hemodialysis, nosocomial infections, intravenous drug abuse, and immunosuppression. Repaired valves have a low risk of endocarditis compared with prosthetic valves. (To learn more about the epidemiology of IE, see Chapter 31.)

More effective antimicrobial agents have improved the early and long-term outcomes of patients treated for endocarditis. However, endocarditis is still associated with high rates of complications, morbidity, and mortality and frequently requires an operation for cure.<sup>1-13</sup> Increased experience and advances in surgical techniques have improved the success of these challenging operations.

#### **PATHOLOGY**

#### Native Mitral Valve Endocarditis

Native valve endocarditis (NVE) begins with endocardial injury, which allows deposition of fibrin and platelets with subsequent attachment of bacteria. 6.14 Endocardial injury may be secondary to rheumatic valvulitis or other leaflet disease, or valvular or annular calcification. Although vegetations may be seen anywhere on the leaflets or chordae, the usual site at which infective NVE of the mitral valve causes valvular destruction and invasion is the base of the atrial aspect of the mitral valve leaflets. Annular or

subanular invasion is more likely to cause atrioventricular (AV) separation when the invasion site is underneath the leaflet and is exposed to high ventricular pressure. Invasion into the AV groove fat with abscess formation is more serious and difficult to radically debride and sterilize (Fig. 38-1).<sup>15</sup> Fortunately, mitral annular invasion more often opens toward the atrium and is therefore shallow in most cases; invasion is generally more common and deeper in aortic valve IE.<sup>16</sup>

Destruction of the fibrous trigones and intervalvular fibrosa between the anterior mitral valve leaflet and the aorta is usually a consequence of aortic valve endocarditis with secondary mitral involvement.<sup>17</sup> An infected aortic valve may seed the anterior mitral leaflet or the tensor apparatus of the mitral valve, resulting in double-valve endocarditis; the mechanism may be a large vegetation hitting and directly infecting the anterior mitral leaflet or a jet lesion from aortic regurgitation that becomes infected.<sup>18</sup>

#### Prosthetic Mitral Valve Endocarditis

Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) is on the rise as the number of patients with prosthetic valves continues to increase. PVE is more common in the aortic than the mitral position. <sup>16</sup> This is because a majority of mitral valves are repaired, and repair is associated with a lower risk of endocarditis.

PVE within the first postoperative year is considered early endocarditis, and cases appearing more than 1 year after operation are termed late.<sup>6,19</sup> The risk of early PVE appears to be greatest approximately 5 weeks after valve implantation and declines thereafter.<sup>19</sup> The overall incidence of early PVE is 1%,<sup>20</sup> and the incidence of late PVE is 0.5 to 1% per year.<sup>21-23</sup> The type of prosthesis (mechanical vs bioprosthesis) does not influence the risk of PVE.

Early PVE is usually the result of intraoperative infection. Common portals of entry for bacteria that cause PVE are dental procedures, intravascular catheters, and skin infection. <sup>6,24</sup> Nosocomial infections contribute to late PVE, particularly in patients with medical comorbidities that require frequent

hospital admissions or instrumentations (eg, hemodialysis) or immunosuppression (eg, organ transplantation).

Early PVE usually affects the sewing ring or the interface of the prosthetic valve and the annulus (often a site of clot formation). Involvement of the sewing ring starts locally but eventually becomes circumferential. Enzymatic degradation of the tissue holding the sutures results in dehiscence of the prosthesis and periprosthetic leak. Progression of the infection and invasion may lead to tissue necrosis, abscess, and pseudoaneurysm formation. Mitral PVE may extend anteriorly to the fibrous trigone or posteriorly, causing AV separation.

#### **MICROBIOLOGY**

Endocarditis of native valves is most often caused by Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus aureus or epidermidis, or Enterococci, with proportions varying according to valve (native vs prosthetic), pathology stage (noninvasive vs invasive), source of infection, patient age, and coexisting conditions. 2,3,6,24-26 S. aureus accounts for 25 to 30% of all infections and is also the most common organism in each major risk group, including intravenous drug users and those with intracardiac devices. 4,6,25 In our study, S. aureus was the most common pathogen for NVE (27.6%) and the second most common cause of PVE (22.1%), for which coagulasenegative Staphylococcus was most common (24.1%).8 Among the major causative organisms, Staphylococcus species are most likely to be associated with invasive endocarditis (49%) and Streptococcus least likely (11%).16 (IE microbiology is discussed in more detail in Chapter 31.)

#### **DIAGNOSIS**

#### Clinical Presentation

The diverse nature and evolving epidemiologic profile of IE ensure that it remains a diagnostic challenge.<sup>6</sup> The clinical presentation varies according to causative organism, preexisting cardiac disease, comorbidities, and complications. Mitral IE may present as an acute, rapidly progressive infection or as a subacute or chronic disease. Up to 90% of patients present with fever, often associated with systemic symptoms of chills, poor appetite, and weight loss. Other findings include a new murmur (85%) or a change in an existing murmur. Embolic phenomena may cause petechiae, Roth spots, Osler nodes, and Janeway lesions. Embolic events occur in 20 to 50% of patients. Neurologic events develop in 20 to 40% of all patients with IE and are mainly the consequence of embolism of vegetation material, while mycotic aneurysm is much less common.<sup>6</sup> Splenomegaly may be present in both NVE and PVE. A high index of suspicion and low threshold of investigation to exclude IE are essential to diagnose and treat these affected patients early.

Laboratory findings include an elevated white blood cell count, anemia, and hematuria. Blood cultures from separate sites are usually positive in patients with bacterial endocarditis; two positive cultures out of three are considered diagnostic. However, cultures in patients with fastidious organisms or fungi may take more than 3 weeks to become positive, although diagnostic methods have improved. When IE is suspected, ideally three or more blood cultures should be collected before antibiotics are initiated, and at least two should be obtained immediately from different peripheral sites. Additional blood cultures should be obtained a few hours later. Unless the patient is septic, it is appropriate to hold off on starting antibiotics until an adequate number of blood cultures have been collected. Cases of IE in which blood cultures are negative (10%) may reflect either patients treated with antibiotics before the blood culture was drawn or

infections caused by fastidious organisms.<sup>3</sup> For cases caused by fastidious organisms, serologic testing or valve or blood polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay can identify the pathogen 60% of the time.<sup>3,6</sup>

### Echocardiography and Imaging Studies

The present gold-standard diagnostic modality for documenting IE is transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Specificity for TEE is approximately 90% and sensitivity is 90 to 100%.6 In contrast, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is more operator dependent, and images may be compromised by surrounding structures; it is only 50% sensitive and 90% specific for IE.6 Echocardiography must be performed as soon as IE is suspected.6 TTE should be performed first, but often both TEE and TTE need to be performed.<sup>6</sup> Echocardiographic findings of IE include vegetations, periprosthetic leakage in patients with PVE, intracardiac fistulae, and abscess cavities. The echocardiographic examination is very good at evaluating valve function, but less reliable for assessing the severity and invasiveness of the infection. A negative echocardiogram does not exclude the diagnosis of IE. In situations with strong suspicion of IE, the diagnosis may be pursued by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In most patients with IE, MRI will demonstrate abnormal consistency of tissue in the annulus.

Metastatic infection is a possibility, and patients with IE and abdominal symptoms should undergo computed tomography (CT) scanning to rule out splenic or hepatic abscesses. Embolic infection of viscera is typically caused by staphylococcal organisms, and the brain is the most important and frequent site for emboli.<sup>3,6</sup> Any neurologic deficit or abnormality should trigger investigation with CT or MRI of the brain, funduscopic examination, and occasionally cerebrospinal fluid examination. We require a CT or MRI of the brain irrespective of symptoms if the patient is going to undergo operation. Preoperative coronary angiography is indicated in all patients age 40 years or older, particularly if they have a history of coronary artery disease or previous revascularization procedures, or if coronary embolization is suspected. Clinical judgment must be exercised in patients with renal dysfunction.

# Diagnostic Criteria and Their Limitations

The Duke (and modified Duke) criteria for IE, based on echocardiographic results along with clinical, microbiologic, and pathologic findings, provide high sensitivity and specificity (~80% overall) for the diagnosis of IE (Table 38-1).<sup>27</sup> The Duke criteria, discussed in more detail in Chapter 31, are useful for the classifying IE, but do not replace clinical judgment for diagnosing IE when blood cultures are negative or when infection affects a prosthetic valve or pacemaker lead.

#### INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY

Surgery plays a pivotal role in managing native mitral valve endocarditis. Indications for surgical intervention in patients with NVE and PVE are presented in Table 38-2.

Congestive heart failure is the most common indication for surgery. Our indications for surgery have gradually moved toward earlier intervention to avoid devastating complications.

The majority of patients with PVE will require surgery for cure.<sup>6,28</sup> Indications for surgical intervention in patients with PVE include heart failure, new heart block (much less common with mitral valve IE than aortic valve IE), ongoing sepsis, valve dehiscence, recurrent systemic embolism, relapse of infection, and fungal infection. Surgery should be considered in all cases of early PVE, because most are caused by *staphylococci* or other aggressive organisms.<sup>6,19</sup>

Operation for large mobile vegetations to prevent embolization in both NVE and PVE remains a controversial indication in the absence of hemodynamic compromise or other surgical indications.<sup>6</sup> The risk of embolism is highest during the first 2 weeks of antibiotic therapy and is related to the size and mobility of the vegetation. The decision to operate early to prevent embolism thus depends on size and mobility of

vegetations, previous embolism, type of microorganism, and duration of antibiotic therapy.

Fungal mitral valve PVE is uncommon and characterized by large vegetations, and these infections are even more

![](_page_3_Picture_30.jpeg)

- Presence of mitral annular abscess, extension of infection to intervalvular fibrous body, or formation of intracardiac fistulas
- 6. Onset of a new conduction disturbance
- Large vegetations (>1 cm), particularly those that are mobile and located on the anterior leaflet, and thus at high risk for embolic complications
- 8. Multiple emboli despite appropriate antibiotic therapy

difficult to cure than is PVE caused by other organisms. Lifelong oral suppressive antifungal therapy after completion of intravenous therapy is often recommended.<sup>6</sup>

#### TIMING OF SURGERY

Many patients with NVE and a majority with PVE require surgical intervention, and the challenge for the surgeon is to determine the appropriate timing of surgery.<sup>3,6,24,29-32</sup> It is our belief that in most cases, the operation should not be delayed once surgical indications are present. It is, however, important to know the sensitivity of the organism to ensure appropriate antibiotic coverage at the time of surgery. The presence of locally uncontrollable infection indicates a need for early surgery in patients with NVE. Early surgery is required for most patients with PVE before it is complicated by heart failure, severe prosthetic dysfunction, or abscess. Patients with PVE caused by *S. aureus* risk rapid progression and invasion. The same principle applies to PVE caused by fungal or other highly resistant organisms. 6 However, delaying surgery is usually advised in the presence of cerebral complications. 6,32,33 Before valve surgery, patients with IE should undergo careful neurologic evaluation, and all should be evaluated by head CT or MRI. The standard recommendation is that surgery should be delayed for 1 to 2 weeks in patients with nonhemorrhagic strokes, and for 3 to 4 weeks in patients with hemorrhagic strokes, to reduce the risk of further intracranial bleeding during heart surgery. 6,32 Intracranial hemorrhage in the setting of PVE has been associated with mortality as high as 28 to 69%. To exclude a mycotic aneurysm, an angiography is required. Nonhemorrhagic embolic stroke has a low risk of transformation into a hemorrhagic infarct during heparinization and cardiopulmonary bypass. The risk of worsening neurologic symptoms as a consequence of operation is time related, decreasing with increasing interval from the initial neurologic event. The risk of worsening the stroke symptoms must be weighed against the indications for surgery and the risk of additional emboli during the waiting period. If cerebral hemorrhage has been excluded by CT or MRI and neurologic damage is not severe (ie, coma), surgery can be performed with a relatively low neurologic risk (3 to 6%) and good probability of complete neurologic recovery.<sup>6</sup>

#### **OPERATIVE TECHNIQUES**

## **General Principles**

Operations for endocarditis are guided by some basic principles: optimal timing of surgery as discussed above, good exposure of the valve, radical debridement, optimal choice for reconstruction of the heart and repair or replacement of the valve, and adequate postoperative antibiotic treatment. Radical debridement with removal of all infected and necrotic tissue and foreign material is difficult to accomplish in mitral cases with AV groove invasion, necrosis, and abscess formation (Fig. 38-1). Aortic root infections are much easier to lay open and debride. In addition, reconstruction after invasion

of the AV groove and AV separation entails closing off the infected space and leaving it without drainage.

#### Native Mitral Valve Endocarditis

Intraoperative TEE should be performed in all cases to carefully evaluate the valve before commencing the procedure. For NVE, our approach is to attempt repair if feasible. Mitral valve repair can be performed provided there is sufficient remaining tissue to allow valvular reconstruction. 12,34-43 Successful repair can be achieved by an experienced surgeon in up to 80% of patients. If repair is not technically feasible and valve replacement is needed, the choice of a tissue or mechanical valve is based primarily on consideration of age, life expectancy, presence of comorbidities, and compliance with anticoagulation. Although there is some experience with the mitral valve allograft for treating mitral valve IE, it remains experimental, with too few data available to support this strategy.

Operations for NVE are best conducted through a full median sternotomy. Cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass involves arterial return via the ascending aorta and bicaval cannulation for venous drainage. It is advisable to arrest the heart before manipulating it too much. Myocardial protection is achieved using antegrade and retrograde blood cardioplegia. We have a preference for opening the right atrium and placing the retrograde cardioplegia cannula directly into the coronary sinus through a purse-string suture.

The mitral valve is exposed either via a left atriotomy through the interatrial groove or transeptally through the right atrium, which is our preference. If the left atrium is small, an extended transseptal-dome approach is used. Opening the aorta allows dual exposure and is helpful in many cases for debridement and suture placement and for avoiding unnecessary damage to the aortic valve. Once good exposure of the mitral valve is accomplished, the valve is evaluated to assess for presence of paravalvular abscesses, intracardiac fistulae, or intervalvular fibrous body/ventricular involvement. Radical resection of all necrotic tissue is performed. All grossly infected tissue is removed without too much concern for the possibility of repair. Unaffected leaflet, chordae, and papillary muscles are preserved to support the posterior annulus. Specimens are divided and sent for both pathologic and microbiologic examination and need for PCR is considered.

# **Anterior Leaflet Repair**

Kissing lesions of the anterior mitral leaflet encountered with aortic endocarditis can be repaired with autologous pericardium. <sup>45</sup> A patch of pericardium is sutured to the remaining tissue of the anterior leaflet with running polypropylene suture (Fig. 38-2). More extensive destruction involving both the aortic valve and the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve can be repaired using a freestanding aortic root allograft with the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve still attached. The allograft's attached aortomitral curtain can be used to reconstruct the base of the native anterior mitral leaflet. <sup>17</sup>

![](_page_5_Picture_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 38-2.** Repair of anterior leaflet perforation using a patch with autologous pericardium followed by annuloplasty.

Involvement of the free margin of the anterior leaflet can be managed with triangular resection. Anterior leaflet chordal rupture can be repaired with chordal transposition from the posterior leaflet or transfer of secondary chorda to the free margin of the anterior leaflet. Artificial chordae may also be used to replace ruptured anterior leaflet chordae.

## Posterior Leaflet Repair

The middle scallop (P<sub>2</sub> segment) of the posterior leaflet is frequently affected by the infectious process. Repair can be performed with triangular or quadrangular resection of the middle scallop. A sliding repair is useful to close the gap between the remaining two scallops (Fig. 38-3). Extensive destruction of the posterior annulus requires removal of all necrotic tissue and annular reconstruction with autologous pericardium. Occasionally, repair of the annulus and the posterior leaflet can be accomplished with the same patch if chordal support to the leaflet is good. Any patch needs to be generous, and suture lines must be tension free. Running polypropylene sutures (4-0 or 5-0) are used on the entire patch. If replacement is required, a mechanical or bioprosthetic valve may then be inserted, affixing the prosthesis to the patch.<sup>15</sup>

Use of a prosthetic anuloplastyring in NVE may be necessary to provide a durable repair and has a low risk of reinfection.<sup>39,40</sup> A good and durable repair outweighs the added low risk of reinfection associated with the anuloplasty ring.

#### Prosthetic Valve Endocarditis

Operations for PVE are reoperations, preferably performed via a median sternotomy. A preoperative chest CT is valuable to avoid adverse events during reentry. A right anterolateral thoracotomy in the fourth intercostal space is an alternative; this approach is suggested by some as particularly useful in patients with multiple previous sternotomies, bypass grafts near the sternum, or a history of mediastinal radiation and/

(A, B) Segment of posterior leaflet is resected and a portion of leaflet detached from the annulus. (C) Leaflet remnants are sutured to the annulus, taking deep bites to reduce leaflet height.

or mediastinitis.<sup>46,47</sup> However, a right thoracotomy for mitral reoperations allows limited access, sometimes denies aortic clamping, and may be associated with a risk of stroke. We uniformly use sternotomy for these reoperations.

# **Myocardial Protection**

Cardiopulmonary bypass is instituted using the ascending aorta and bicaval cannulation, and myocardial protection is achieved using antegrade and retrograde blood cardioplegia. Open direct cannulation of the coronary sinus is preferred.

# Mitral Valve Exposure

Our usual approach to the mitral valve is via the right atrium and atrial septum. If the left atrium is large and adhesions modest, a standard left atriotomy may be used. Exposure may be enhanced by dividing the superior vena cava and extending the left atriotomy under the aortic root, toward the left auricle. This approach provides good exposure even when the left atrium is small. Releasing the left heart from the chest wall improves mitral valve exposure, while not doing that sometimes makes exposure very difficult. Presence of an aortic valve prosthesis also makes exposure more difficult.

#### Reconstruction of the Mitral Annulus

Once exposure of the mitral valve is obtained, the infected prosthesis is removed and the annulus debrided of all old

suture material and pledgets. Mitral valve PVE may produce separation of the left atrium, left ventricle, and prosthesis. In these situations, the operation includes debridement of the annulus with subsequent annulus reconstruction using autologous or possibly glutaraldehyde-fixed bovine pericardium (David technique). 15,48 With this technique, a semicircular pericardial patch is used to reconstruct the annulus, with one side of the patch sutured to the endocardium of the left ventricle and the other side to the left atrium. This patch covers the cavity, which must be thoroughly debrided and sterilized before the patch is affixed. The new valve prosthesis is affixed to this reconstructed annulus (Fig. 38-4). The patch should be generous in order to minimize tension on suture lines. We look at this patch as a reinforcement of an undermined area rather than true reconstruction. The prosthesis should be implanted in such a way that there is no residual pseudo aneurysm on the ventricular side. In most situations with annular reconstruction, we use a bioprosthesis to avoid anticoagulation in the postoperative period, and have a preference for prostheses with generous soft sewing rings.

An alternative technique for mitral annular reconstruction is that described by Carpentier and colleagues. <sup>49</sup> This technique involves suture closure of the AV separation. Valve sutures are then placed with a large needle around this suture line with pledgets on the ventricular side. We have observed pseudoaneurysm formation after application of this technique, but still consider it useful in cases with shallow and fairly narrow AV separation.

# Reconstruction of the Fibrous Trigones and Intervalvular Fibrosa

Extension of PVE into the intervalvular fibrosa/fibrous trigones may necessitate replacement of both the mitral and aortic valves. This usually occurs in the setting of PVE affecting both the aortic and mitral valves and seldom with isolated mitral valve endocarditis. Reconstruction of the intervalvular fibrosa as well as replacement of both the aortic and mitral valves are required (Fig. 38-5). In such circumstances the fibrous trigone may be reconstructed with autologous (or bovine) pericardium.<sup>17,49-52</sup> Perfect exposure is mandatory, whether it is provided by the extended transseptal approach or by dividing the superior vena cava and extending the left atriotomy from anterior to the right superior pulmonary vein toward the dome of the left atrium. This approach allows debridement of the aortic and mitral valves as well as the fibrous trigones. The prosthetic mitral valve is then sewn normally to the annulus posteriorly, medially, and laterally. The superior portion of the mitral valve annulus is reconstructed with a pericardial patch that supports and replaces the intervalvular fibrosa. This patch is anchored to the mitral valve annulus and the sewing ring of the prosthesis far enough back where the mitral annulus is still preserved. The patch is sandwiched between the mitral valve suture pledgets and annulus on the ventricular side. Once the mitral valve is secured in place, the aortic valve prosthesis is affixed to the aortic annulus. Posteriorly, the pericardial patch is used to

The base of the allograft mitral valve is sewn to the mitral valve prosthesis and patch. It is important to pay attention to the corners by the central fibrous body and the lateral trigone in order to ensure that the corners are sealed and no sutures are under tension to avoid tears and leaks.

cover any defect in the annulus and intervalvular fibrosa, and the lateral corners are sealed. The aortic valve is then sewn to that patch.<sup>17</sup> Another option is aortic valve and root allograft replacement with the allograft in an anatomic position and orientation, suturing the intervalvular fibrosa/mitral valve of the allograft directly to the mitral valve prosthesis.<sup>17</sup>

## Postoperative Antibiotic Treatment

Regardless of the mitral procedure performed, all patients with active infection receive 6 weeks of postoperative antibiotic therapy as final cure of the infection is by the antibiotics. In patients with fungal endocarditis, the intravenous treatment is followed by oral antifungal suppression for life.

#### **RESULTS**

#### Native Mitral Valve Endocarditis

Overall, the outcomes for patients requiring surgery for mitral valve IE are worse than for patients with aortic valve IE (Fig. 38-6). This is explained by mitral IE patients being sicker as well as the fact that invasive mitral disease is surgically more difficult to deal with. Superior event-free survival, lower hospital mortality, and improved long-term survival for mitral valve repair compared with replacement have been reported (Fig. 38-7). The our Cleveland Clinic series of 146 patients who had surgery for NVE, valve repair resulted in lower hospital mortality (p = .008) and better long-term survival (p = .05) than valve replacement. Infection-free

survival was also better after valve repair than replacement, with a reinfection rate of less than 1% per year. <sup>43</sup> The most important explanations for these excellent outcomes after valve repair are (1) less advanced disease, (2) use of less prosthetic material in the infected field, (3) better preservation of left ventricular function associated with repairing mitral valves, and (4) less sick patients. Those undergoing valve replacement were the sickest patients with the most advanced and destructive disease. The choice of prosthesis, whether bioprosthetic or mechanical, does not make a difference, as they have similar survival rates and freedom from reinfection. <sup>32,53,54</sup>

#### **Prosthetic Valve Endocarditis**

Despite improved antimicrobial regimens, outcomes of medical therapy alone are poor for PVE, particularly for patients with annular involvement or early endocarditis after valve surgery. PVE has been associated with a much higher operative mortality than NVE. 10,48,53 With improved understanding of the disease and better management, both medical and surgical, the results of mitral PVE now approach those of mitral NVE (Fig. 38-6). 14 Outcomes are worse for invasive mitral infection than for both invasive aortic infection and infection limited to valve cusps or leaflets, and this is true for PVE and NVE (Fig. 38-6). 14 The reason is related to the inherent mitral valve anatomy in patients with invasive disease into the AV groove, limiting our ability to perform radical debridement, sterilization, and drainage of the infected area. In addition, we lack an alternative mitral valve prosthesis that is equally optimal for IE, simple to implant, and as good as the allograft for the aortic valve. Allograft mitral valve replacement is not simple and is still experimental. 55
