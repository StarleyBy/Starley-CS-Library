## **History of Cardiac Surgery**

Larry W. Stephenson • Frank A. Baciewicz, Jr.

The development of major surgery was retarded for centuries by a lack of knowledge and technology. Significantly, the general anesthetics ether and chloroform were not developed until the middle of the nineteenth century. These agents made major surgical operations possible, which created an interest in repairing wounds to the heart, leading some investigators in Europe to conduct studies in the animal laboratory on the repair of heart wounds. The first simple operations in humans for heart wounds soon were reported in the medical literature.

#### **HEART WOUNDS**

On July 10, 1893, Dr. Daniel Hale Williams (Fig. 1-1), a surgeon from Chicago, successfully operated on a 24-year-old man who had been stabbed in the heart during a fight. The stab wound was slightly to the left of the sternum and dead center over the heart. Initially, the wound was thought to be superficial, but during the night the patient experienced persistent bleeding, pain, and pronounced symptoms of shock. Williams opened the patient's chest and tied off an artery and vein that had been injured inside the chest wall, likely causing the blood loss. Then he noticed a tear in the pericardium and a puncture wound to the heart "about one-tenth of an inch in length."

The wound in the right ventricle was not bleeding, so Williams did not place a stitch through the heart wound. He did, however, stitch closed the hole in the pericardium. Williams reported this case 4 years later. This operation, which is referred to frequently, is probably the first successful surgery involving a documented stab wound to the heart. At the time Williams' surgery was considered bold and daring, and although he did not actually place a stitch through the wound in the heart, his treatment seems to have been appropriate. Under the circumstances, he most likely saved the patient's life.

A few years after Williams' case, a couple of other surgeons actually sutured heart wounds, but the patients did not survive. Dr. Ludwig Rehn (Fig. 1-2), a surgeon in Frankfurt, Germany, performed what many consider the first successful heart operation.<sup>2</sup> On September 7, 1896, a 22-year-old

man was stabbed in the heart and collapsed. The police found him pale, covered with cold sweat, and extremely short of breath. His pulse was irregular and his clothes were soaked with blood. By September 9, his condition was worsening, as shown in Dr. Rehn's case notes:

Pulse weaker, increasing cardiac dullness on percussion, respiration 76, further deterioration during the day, diagnostic tap reveals dark blood. Patient appears moribund. Diagnosis: increasing hemothorax. I decided to operate entering the chest through the left fourth intercostal space, there is massive blood in the pleural cavity. The mammary artery is not injured. There is continuous bleeding from a hole in the pericardium. This opening is enlarged. The heart is exposed. Old blood and clots are emptied. There is a 1.5 cm gaping right ventricular wound. Bleeding is controlled with finger pressure. . . .

I decided to suture the heart wound. I used a small intestinal needle and silk suture. The suture was tied in diastole. Bleeding diminished remarkably with the third suture, all bleeding was controlled. The pulse improved. The pleural cavity was irrigated. Pleura and pericardium were drained with iodoform gauze. The incision was approximated, heart rate and respiratory rate decreased and pulse improved post-operatively.

... Today the patient is cured. He looks very good. His heart action is regular. I have not allowed him to work physically hard. This proves the feasibility of cardiac suture repair without a doubt! I hope this will lead to more investigation regarding surgery of the heart. This may save many lives.

Ten years after Rehn's initial repair, he had accumulated a series of 124 cases with a mortality of only 60%, quite a feat at that time.<sup>3</sup>

Dr. Luther Hill was the first American to report the successful repair of a cardiac wound, in a 13-year-old boy who was a victim of multiple stab wounds. When the first doctor arrived, the boy was in profound shock. The doctor remembered that Dr. Luther Hill had spoken on the subject of repair of cardiac wounds at a local medical society meeting in Montgomery, Alabama. With the consent of the boy's parents, Dr. Hill was summoned. He arrived sometime after midnight with six other physicians. One was his brother. The surgery

took place on the patient's kitchen table in a rundown shack. Lighting was provided by two kerosene lamps borrowed from neighbors. One physician administered chloroform anesthesia. The boy was suffering from cardiac tamponade as a result of a stab wound to the left ventricle. The stab wound to the ventricle was repaired with two catgut sutures. Although the early postoperative course was stormy, the boy made a complete recovery. That patient, Henry Myrick, eventually moved to Chicago, where, in 1942, at the age of 53, he got into a heated argument and was stabbed in the heart again, very close to the original stab wound. This time, Henry was not as lucky and died from the wound.

Another milestone in cardiac surgery for trauma occurred during World War II when Dwight Harken, then a U.S. Army surgeon, removed 134 missiles from the mediastinum, including 55 from the pericardium and 13 from cardiac chambers, without a death.<sup>5</sup> It is hard to imagine this type of elective (and semielective) surgery taking place without sophisticated indwelling pulmonary artery catheters, blood banks, and electronic monitoring equipment.

Rapid blood infusion consisted of pumping air into glass bottles of blood.

### OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY EMBOLI

Martin Kirschner reported the first patient who recovered fully after undergoing pulmonary embolectomy in 1924.<sup>6</sup> In 1937, John Gibbon estimated that nine of 142 patients who had undergone the procedure worldwide left the hospital alive.<sup>7</sup> These dismal results were a stimulus for Gibbon to start work on a pump oxygenator that could maintain the circulation during pulmonary embolectomy. Sharp was the first to perform pulmonary embolectomy using cardiopulmonary bypass, in 1962.<sup>8</sup>

#### SURGERY OF THE PERICARDIUM

Pericardial resection was introduced independently by Rehn<sup>9</sup> and Sauerbruch.<sup>10</sup> Since Rehn's report, there have been few advances in the surgical treatment of constrictive pericarditis.

Some operations are now performed with the aid of cardiopulmonary bypass. In certain situations, radical pericardiectomy that removes most of the pericardium posterior to the phrenic nerves is done.

### CATHETERIZATION OF THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE HEART

Although cardiac catheterization is not considered heart surgery, it is an invasive procedure, and some catheter procedures have replaced heart operations. Werner Forssmann is credited with the first heart catheterization. He performed the procedure on himself and reported it in *Klrinische Wochenschrift.* In 1956 Forssmann shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Andre F. Cournand and Dickenson W. Richards, Jr. His 1929 paper states, "One often hesitates to use intercardiac injections promptly, and often, time is wasted with other measures. This is why I kept looking for a different, safer access to the cardiac chambers: the catheterization of the right heart via the venous system."

In this report by Forssmann, a photograph of the x-ray taken of Forssmann with the catheter in his own heart is presented. Forssmann, in that same report, goes on to present the first clinical application of the central venous catheter for a patient in shock with generalized peritonitis. Forssmann concludes his paper by stating, "I also want to mention that this method allows new options for metabolic studies and studies about cardiac physiology."

In a 1951 lecture Forssmann discussed the tremendous resistance he faced during his initial experiments.<sup>12</sup> "Such methods are good for a circus, but not for a respected hospital" was the answer to his request to pursue physiologic studies using cardiac catheterization. His progressive ideas pushed him into the position of an outsider with ideas too crazy to give him a clinical position. Klein applied cardiac catheterization for cardiac output determinations using the Fick method a half year after Forssmann's first report.<sup>13</sup> In 1930, Forssmann described his experiments with catheter cardiac angiography.<sup>14</sup> Further use of this new methodology had to wait until Cournand's work in the 1940s.

# HEART VALVE SURGERY BEFORE THE ERA OF CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS

The first clinical attempt to open a stenotic valve was carried out by Theodore Tuffier on July 13, 1912. Tuffier used his finger to reach the stenotic aortic valve. He was able to dilate the valve supposedly by pushing the invaginated aortic wall through the stenotic valve. The patient recovered, but one must be skeptical as to what was accomplished. Russell Brock attempted to dilate calcified aortic valves in humans in the late 1940s by passing an instrument through the valve from the innominate or another artery. His results were poor, and he abandoned the approach. During the next several years, Brock and Bailey and colleagues used different

dilators and various approaches to dilate stenotic aortic valves in patients. Mortality for these procedures, which was often done in conjunction with mitral commissurotomy, was high.

Elliott Cutler worked for 2 years on a mitral valvulotomy procedure in the laboratory. His first patient underwent successful valvulotomy on May 20, 1923, using a tetrasomy knife.<sup>19</sup> Unfortunately, most of Cutler's subsequent patients died because he created too much regurgitation with his valvulotome, and he soon gave up the operation.

In Charles Bailey's 1949 paper entitled, "The Surgical Treatment of Mitral Stenosis," he states, "After 1929 no more surgical attempts [on mitral stenosis] were made until 1945. Dr. Dwight Harken, Dr. Horace Smithy, and the author recently made operative attempts to improve mitral stenosis. Our clinical experience with the surgery of the mitral valves has been five cases to date." He then describes his five patients, four of whom died and only one of whom lived a long life. 20,21

A few days after Bailey's success, on June 16 in Boston, Dr. Dwight Harken successfully performed his first valvulotomy for mitral stenosis.<sup>22</sup>

The first successful pulmonary valvulotomy was performed by Thomas Holmes Sellers on December 4, 1947.<sup>23</sup>

Charles Hufnagel reported a series of 23 patients starting September 1952 who had operation for aortic insufficiency.<sup>24</sup> There were four deaths among the first 10 patients and two deaths among the next 13. Hufnagel's caged-ball valve, which used multiple-point fixation rings to secure the apparatus to the descending aorta, was the only surgical treatment for aortic valvular incompetence until the advent of cardiopulmonary bypass and the development of heart valves that could be sewn into the aortic annulus position.

#### CONGENITAL CARDIAC SURGERY BEFORE THE HEART-LUNG MACHINE ERA

Congenital cardiac surgery began when John Strieder at Massachusetts General Hospital first successfully interrupted a ductus on March 6, 1937. The patient was septic and died on the fourth postoperative day. At autopsy, vegetations filled the pulmonary artery down to the valve.<sup>25</sup> On August 16, 1938, Robert Gross, at Boston Children's Hospital, operated on a 7-year-old girl with dyspnea after moderate exercise.<sup>26</sup> The ductus was ligated and the patient made an uneventful recovery.

Modifications of the ductus operation soon followed. In 1944, Dr. Gross reported a technique for dividing the ductus successfully. The next major congenital lesion to be overcome was coarctation of the aorta. Dr. Clarence Crafoord, in Stockholm, Sweden, successfully resected a coarctation of the aorta in a 12-year-old boy on October 19, 1944.<sup>27</sup> Twelve days later he successfully resected the coarctation of a 27-year-old patient. Dr. Gross first operated on a 5-year-old boy with this condition on June 28, 1945.<sup>28</sup> After he excised the coarctation and rejoined the aorta, the patient's heart stopped suddenly. The patient died in the operating room. One week

later, however, Dr. Gross operated on a second patient, a 12-year-old girl. This patient's operation was successful. Dr. Gross had been unaware of Dr. Crafoord's successful surgery several months previously, probably because of World War II.

In 1945, Dr. Gross reported the first successful case of surgical relief for tracheal obstruction from a vascular ring.<sup>29</sup> In the 5 years that followed Gross's first successful operation, he reported 40 more cases.

The famous Blalock-Taussig operation also was first reported in 1945. The first patient was a 15-month-old girl with a clinical diagnosis of tetralogy of Fallot with a severe pulmonary stenosis.<sup>30</sup> At age 8 months, the baby had her first cyanotic spell, which occurred after eating. Dr. Helen Taussig, the cardiologist, followed the child for 3 months, and during that time, cyanosis increased, and the child failed to gain weight. The operation was performed by Dr. Alfred Blalock at Johns Hopkins University on November 29, 1944. The left subclavian artery was anastomosed to the left pulmonary artery in an end-to-side fashion. The postoperative course was described as stormy; the patient was discharged 2 months postoperatively. Two additional successful cases were done within 3 months of that first patient.

Thus, within a 7-year period, three congenital cardiovascular defects, patent ductus arteriosus, coarctation of the aorta, and vascular ring, were attacked surgically and treated successfully. However, the introduction of the Blalock-Taussig shunt probably was the most powerful stimulus to the development of cardiac surgery because this operation palliated a complex intracardiac lesion and focused attention on the pathophysiology of cardiac disease.

Anomalous coronary artery in which the left coronary artery communicates with the pulmonary artery was the next surgical conquest. The surgery was performed on July 22, 1946, and was reported by Gunnar Biorck and Clarence Crafoord.<sup>31</sup> The anomalous coronary artery was identified and doubly ligated. The patient made an uneventful recovery.

Muller<sup>32</sup> reported successful surgical treatment of transposition of the pulmonary veins in 1951, but the operation addressed a partial form of the anomaly. Later in the 1950s, Gott, Varco, Lillehei, and Cooley reported successful operative variations for anomalous pulmonary veins.

Another of Gross's pioneering surgical procedures was surgical closure of an aortopulmonary window on May 22, 1948.<sup>33</sup> Cooley and colleagues<sup>34</sup> were the first to report on the use of cardiopulmonary bypass to repair this defect and converted a difficult and hazardous procedure into a relatively straightforward one.

Glenn<sup>35</sup> reported the first successful clinical application of the cavopulmonary anastomosis in the United States in 1958 for what has been termed the *Glenn shunt*. Similar work was done in Russia during the 1950s by several investigators. On January 3, 1957, Galankin,<sup>36</sup> a Russian surgeon, performed a cavopulmonary anastomosis in a 16-year-old patient with tetralogy of Fallot. The patient made a good recovery with significant improvement in exercise tolerance and cyanosis.

### THE DEVELOPMENT OF CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS

The development of the heart-lung machine made repair of intracardiac lesions possible. To bypass the heart, one needs a basic understanding of the physiology of the circulation, a method of preventing the blood from clotting, a mechanism to pump blood, and finally, a method to ventilate the blood.

One of the key requirements of the heart-lung machine was anticoagulation. Heparin was discovered in 1915 by a medical student, Jay McLean, working in the laboratory of Dr. William Howell, a physiologist at Johns Hopkins.<sup>37</sup>

John Gibbon contributed more to the success of the development of the heart-lung machine than anyone else.

Gibbon's work on the heart-lung machine took place over 20 years in laboratories at Massachusetts General Hospital, the University of Pennsylvania, and Thomas Jefferson University. In 1937, Gibbon reported the first successful demonstration that life could be maintained by an artificial heart and lung and that the native heart and lungs could resume function. Unfortunately, only three animals recovered adequate cardiorespiratory function after total pulmonary artery occlusion and bypass, and even they died a few hours later. Gibbon's work was interrupted by World War II; afterward, he resumed his work at Thomas Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia (Table 1-1).

Forest Dodrill and colleagues used the mechanical blood pump they developed with General Motors on a 41-year-old man<sup>43</sup> (Fig. 1-3). The machine was used to substitute for the left ventricle for 50 minutes while a surgical procedure was carried out to repair the mitral valve; the patient's own lungs were used to oxygenate the blood. This, the first clinically successful total left-sided heart bypass in a human, was performed on July 3, 1952, and followed from Dodrill's experimental work with a mechanical pump for univentricular, biventricular, or cardiopulmonary bypass. Although Dodrill and colleagues had used their pump with an oxygenator for total heart bypass in animals,<sup>54</sup> they felt that left-sided heart bypass was the most practical method for their first clinical case.

Later, on October 21, 1952, Dodrill and colleagues used their machine in a 16-year-old boy with congenital pulmonary stenosis to perform a pulmonary valvuloplasty under direct vision; this was the first successful right-sided heart bypass. 44 Between July 1952 and December 1954, Dodrill performed approximately 13 clinical operations on the heart and thoracic aorta using the Dodrill—General Motors machine, with at least five hospital survivors. 55 Although he used this machine with an oxygenator in the animal laboratory, he did not start using an oxygenator with the Dodrill—General Motors mechanical heart clinically until early 1955.

Hypothermia was another method to stop the heart and allow it to be opened.  $^{44}$ 

John Lewis closed an atrial septal defect (ASD) in a 5-year-old girl on September 2, 1952 using a hypothermic technique.<sup>44</sup>

#### TABLE 1-1: Twilight Zone: Clinical Status of Open-Heart Surgery, 1951–1955

- 1951 April 6: Clarence Dennis at the University of Minnesota used a heart-lung machine to repair an ostium primum or AV canal defect in a 5-year-old girl. Patient could not be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass.<sup>39</sup>
  - May 31: Dennis attempted to close an atrial septal defect using heart-lung machine in a 2-year-old girl who died intraoperatively of a massive air embolus.<sup>40</sup>
  - August 7: Achille Mario Digliotti at the University of Turino, Italy, used a heart-lung machine of his own design to partially support the circulation (flow at 1 L/min for 20 minutes) while he resected a large mediastinal tumor compressing the right side of the heart. The cannulation was through the right axillary vein and artery. The patient survived. This was the first successful clinical use of a heart-lung machine, but the machine was not used as an adjunct to heart surgery.
- 1952 February (1952 or 1953 John Gibbon; see February 1953)
  - *March:* John Gibbon used his heart-lung machine for right-sided heart bypass only while surgeon Frank Allbritten at Pennsylvania Hospital, Philadelphia, operated to remove a large clot or myxomatous tumor suspected by angiography.<sup>42</sup> No tumor or clot was found. The patient died of heart failure in the operating room shortly after discontinuing right-sided heart bypass.
  - April 3: Helmsworth in Cincinnati used a pump oxygenator of his own design connecting it in a veno-veno bypass mode to temporarily treat a patient with end-stage lung disease. The patients symptoms improved but recurred shortly after bypass was discontinued.<sup>60</sup>
  - *July 3:* Dodrill used the Dodrill-GMR pump to bypass the left side of the heart while he repaired a mitral valve. <sup>43</sup> The patient survived. This was the first successful use of a mechanical pump for total substitution of the left ventricle in a human being.
  - September 2: John Lewis, at the University of Minnesota, closed an atrial septal defect under direct vision in a 5-year-old girl. The patient survived. This was the first successful clinical heart surgery procedure using total-body hypothermia. A mechanical pump and an oxygenator were not used. Others, including Dodrill, soon followed, using total-body hypothermia techniques to close atrial septal defects (ASDs) and perform pulmonary valvulotomies. By 1954, Lewis reported on 11 ASD closures using hypothermia with two hospital deaths. He also operated on two patients with ventricular septal defect (VSD) in early 1954 using this technique. Both resulted in intraoperative deaths.
  - October 21: Dodrill performed pulmonary valvulotomy under direct vision using Dodrill-GMR pump to bypass the right atrium, ventricle, and main pulmonary artery. 45 The patient survived.
  - Although Dr. William Mustard in Toronto would describe a type of "corrective" surgical procedure for transposition of the great arteries (TGA) in 1964, which, in fact, for many years, would become the most popular form of surgical correction of TGA, his early results with this lesion were not good. In 1952, he used a mechanical pump coupled to the lung that had just been removed from a monkey to oxygenate the blood in seven children while attempts were made to correct their TGA defect. <sup>46</sup> There were no survivors.
- 1953 February (or 1952): Gibbon at Jefferson Hospital in Philadelphia operated to close an ASD. No ASD was found. The patient died intraoperatively. Autopsy showed a large patent ductus arteriosus.<sup>47</sup>
  - May 6: Gibbon used his heart-lung machine to close an ASD in an 18-year-old woman with symptoms of heart failure. 47,57 The patient survived the operation and became the first patient to undergo successful open-heart surgery using a heart-lung machine.
  - *July:* Gibbon used the heart-lung machine on two 5-year-old girls to close atrial septal defects.<sup>47</sup> Both died intraoperatively. Gibbon was extremely distressed and declared a moratorium on further cardiac surgery at Jefferson Medical School until more work could be done to solve problems related to heart-lung bypass. These were probably the last heart operation he performed using the heart-lung machine.
- 1954 March 26: C. Walton Lillehei and associates at the University of Minnesota closed a VSD under direct vision in a 15-month-old boy using a technique to support the circulation that they called *controlled cross-circulation*. An adult (usually a parent) with the same blood type was used more or less as the heart-lung machine. The adult's femoral artery and vein were connected with tubing and a pump to the patient's circulation. The adult's heart and lungs were oxygenated and supported the circulation while the child's heart defect was corrected. The first patient died 11 days postoperatively from pneumonia, but six of their next seven patients survived. Between March 1954 and the end of 1955, 45 heart operations were performed by Lillehei on children using this technique before it was phased out. Although controlled cross-circulation was a short-lived technique, it was an important stepping stone in the development of open-heart surgery.
  - *July:* Clarence Crafoord and associates at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, used a heart-lung machine of their own design coupled with total-body hypothermia (patient was initially submerged in an ice-water bath) to remove a large atrial myxoma in a 40-year-old woman.<sup>49</sup> She survived.
- 1955 March 22: John Kirklin at the Mayo Clinic used a heart-lung machine similar to Gibbon's, but with modifications his team had worked out over 2 years in the research laboratory, to successfully close a VSD in a 5-year-old patient. By May of 1955, they had operated on eight children with various types of VSDs, and four were hospital survivors. This was the first successful series of patients (ie, more than one) to undergo heart surgery using a heart-lung machine.<sup>50</sup>
  - May 13: Lillehei and colleagues began using a heart-lung machine of their own design to correct intracardiac defects. By May of 1956, their series included 80 patients. <sup>48</sup> Initially they used their heart-lung machine for lower-risk patients and used controlled cross-circulation, with which they were more familiar, for the higher-risk patients. Starting in March 1955, they also tried other techniques in patients to oxygenate blood during heart surgery, such as canine lung, but with generally poor results. <sup>48</sup>

#### TABLE 1-1: Twilight Zone: Clinical Status of Open-Heart Surgery, 1951–1955 (Continued)

Dodrill had been performing heart operations with the GM heart pump since 1952 and used the patient's own lungs to oxygenate the blood. Early in the year 1955, he attempted repairs of VSDs in two patients using the heart pump, but with a mechanical oxygenator of his team's design both died. On December 1, he closed a VSD in a 3-year-old girl using his heart-lung machine. She survived. In May 1956 at the annual meeting of the American Association for Thoracic Surgery, he reported on six children with VSDs, including one with tetralogy of Fallot, who had undergone open-heart surgery using his heart-lung machine. All survived at least 48 hours postoperatively.<sup>51</sup> Three were hospital survivors, including the patient with tetralogy of Fallot.

June 30: Clarence Dennis, who had moved from the University of Minnesota to the State University of New York, successfully closed an ASD in a girl using a heart-lung machine of his own design.<sup>52</sup>

Mustard successfully repaired a VSD and dilated the pulmonary valve in a 9-month-old with a diagnosis of tetralogy of Fallot using a mechanical pump and a monkey lung to oxygenate the blood. He did not give the date in 1955, but the patient is listed as Human Case 7. Unfortunately, in the same report, cases 1–6 and 8–15 operated on between 1951 and the end of 1955 with various congenital heart defects did not survive the surgery using the pump and monkey lung, nor did another seven children in 1952, all with TGA (see timeline for 1952) using the same bypass technique.

Note: This list is not all-inclusive but likely includes most of the historically significant clinical open-heart events in which a blood pump was used to support the circulation during this period. (A twilight zone can mean an ill-defined area between two distinct conditions, such as the area between darkness and light.)

The use of systemic hypothermia for open intracardiac surgery was relatively short-lived; after the heart-lung machine was introduced clinically, it appeared that deep hypothermia was obsolete. However, during the 1960s it became apparent that operative results in infants under 1 year of age using

cardiopulmonary bypass were poor. In 1967, Hikasa and colleagues,<sup>56</sup> from Kyoto, Japan, published an article that reintroduced profound hypothermia for cardiac surgery in infants and used the heart-lung machine for rewarming. Their technique involved surface cooling to 20°C, cardiac

surgery during circulatory arrest for 15 to 75 minutes, and rewarming with cardiopulmonary bypass. At the same time, other groups reported using profound hypothermia with circulatory arrest in infants with the heart-lung machine for cooling and rewarming. Results were much improved, and subsequently the technique also was applied for resection of aortic arch aneurysms.

After World War II, John Gibbon resumed his research. He eventually met Thomas Watson, chairman of the board of the International Business Machines (IBM) Corporation. Watson was fascinated by Gibbon's research and promised help. Soon afterward, six IBM engineers arrived and built a machine that was similar to Gibbon's earlier machine, which contained a rotating vertical cylinder oxygenator and a modified DeBakey rotary pump. Gibbon operated on a 15-monthold girl with severe congestive heart failure (CHF). The preoperative diagnosis was ASD, but at operation, none was found. She died, and a huge patent ductus was found at autopsy. The next patient was an 18-year-old girl with CHF owing to an ASD. This defect was closed successfully on May 6, 1953, with the Gibbon-IBM heart-lung machine.

The patient recovered, and several months later the defect was confirmed closed at cardiac catheterization. <sup>57</sup> Unfortunately, Gibbon's next two patients did not survive intracardiac procedures when the heart-lung machine was used. These failures distressed Dr. Gibbon, who declared a 1-year moratorium for the heart-lung machine until more work could be done to solve the problems causing the deaths.

During this period, C. Walton Lillehei and colleagues at the University of Minnesota studied a technique called *controlled cross-circulation*. With this technique, the circulation of one dog was used temporarily to support that of a second dog while the second dog's heart was stopped temporarily and opened. After a simulated repair in the second dog, the animals were disconnected and allowed to recover.

Lillehei and colleagues<sup>58</sup> used their technique at the University of Minnesota to correct a ventricular septal defect (VSD) in a 12-month-old infant on March 26, 1954 (Fig. 1-4). Either a parent or a close relative with the same blood type was connected to the child's circulation. In Lillehei's first clinical case, the patient made an uneventful recovery until death on the eleventh postoperative day from a

rapidly progressing tracheal bronchitis. At autopsy, the VSD was closed, and the respiratory infection was confirmed as the cause of death. Two weeks later, the second and third patients had VSDs closed by the same technique 3 days apart. Both remained long-term survivors with normal hemodynamics confirmed by cardiac catheterization.

In 1955, Lillehei and colleagues<sup>59</sup> published a report of 32 patients that included repairs of VSDs, tetralogy of Fallot, and atrioventricularis communis defects. By May of 1955, the blood pump used for systemic cross-circulation by Lillehei and colleagues was coupled with a bubble oxygenator developed by Drs. DeWall and Lillehei, and cross-circulation was soon abandoned after use in 45 patients during 1954 and 1955. Although its clinical use was short-lived, cross-circulation was an important steppingstone in the development of cardiac surgery.

Meanwhile, at the Mayo Clinic only 90 miles away, John W. Kirklin and colleagues launched their open-heart program on March 5, 1955.<sup>50</sup> They used a heart-lung machine based on the Gibbon-IBM machine but with their own modifications. Kirklin wrote:<sup>61</sup>

We investigated and visited the groups working intensively with the mechanical pump oxygenators. We visited Dr. Gibbon in his laboratories in Philadelphia, and Dr. Forest Dodrill in Detroit, among others. The Gibbon pump oxygenator had been developed and made by the International Business Machine Corporation and looked quite a bit like a computer. Dr. Dodrill's heart-lung machine had been developed and built for him by General Motors and it looked a great deal like a car engine. We came home, reflected and decided to try to persuade the Mayo Clinic to let us build a pump oxygenator similar to the Gibbon machine, but somewhat different. We already had had about a year's experience in the animal laboratory with David Donald using a simple pump and bubble oxygenator when we set about very early in 1953, the laborious task of building a Mayo-Gibbon pump oxygenator and continuing the laboratory research.

Most people were very discouraged with the laboratory progress. The American Heart Association and the National Institutes of Health had stopped funding any projects for the study of heart-lung machines, because it was felt that the problem was physiologically insurmountable. David Donald and I undertook a series of laboratory experiments lasting about 1½ years during which time the engineering shops at the Mayo Clinic constructed a pump oxygenator based on the Gibbon model.

... In the winter of 1954 and 1955 we had nine surviving dogs out of 10 cardiopulmonary bypass runs. With my wonderful colleague and pediatric cardiologist, Jim DuShane, we had earlier selected eight patients for intracardiac repair. Two had to be put off because two babies with very serious congenital heart disease came along and we decided to fit them into the schedule. We had determined to do all eight patients even if the first seven died. All of this was planned with the knowledge and approval of the governance of the Mayo Clinic. Our plan was then to return to the laboratory and spend the next 6 to 12 months solving the problems that had arisen in the first planned clinical trial of a pump oxygenator. ... We did our first open-heart operation on a Tuesday in March 1955.

Kirklin continued:61

Four of our first eight patients survived, but the press of the clinical work prevented our ever being able to return to the laboratory with the force that we had planned. By now, Walt Lillehei and I were on parallel, but intertwined paths.

By the end of 1956, many university groups around the world had launched into open-heart programs. Currently, it is estimated that more than 1 million cardiac operations are performed each year worldwide with use of the heart-lung machine. In most cases, the operative mortality is quite low, approaching 1% for some operations. Little thought is given to the courageous pioneers in the 1950s whose monumental contributions made all this possible.

### **Extracorporeal Life Support**

Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is an extension of cardiopulmonary bypass. Cardiopulmonary bypass was limited initially to no more than 6 hours. The development of membrane oxygenators in the 1960s permitted longer support. Donald Hill and colleagues in 1972 treated a 24-year-old man who developed shock lung after blunt trauma. 62 The patient was supported for 75 hours using a heart-lung machine with a membrane oxygenator, cannulated via the femoral vein and artery. The patient was weaned and recovered. Hill's second patient was supported for 5 days and recovered. This led to a randomized trial supported by the National Institutes of Health to determine the efficacy of this therapy for adults with respiratory failure. The study was conducted from 1972 to 1975 and showed no significant difference in survival between patients managed by ECLS (9.5%) and those who received conventional ventilatory therapy (8.3%).63 Because of these results, most U.S. centers abandoned efforts to support adult patients using ECLS, also known as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

One participant in the adult trial decided to study neonates. The usual causes of neonatal respiratory failure have in common abnormal postnatal blood shunts known as *persistent fetal circulation* (PFC). This is a temporary, reversible phenomenon. In 1976, Bartlett and colleagues at the University of Michigan were the first to treat a neonate successfully using ECLS. More than 8000 neonatal patients have been treated using ECLS worldwide, with a survival rate of 82% (ELSO registry data).

#### **MYOCARDIAL PROTECTION**

Melrose and colleagues<sup>64</sup> in 1955 presented the first experimental study describing induced arrest by potassium-based cardioplegia. Blood cardioplegia was used "to preserve myocardial energy stores at the onset of cardiac ischemia." Unfortunately, the Melrose solution proved to be toxic to the myocardium, and as a result cardioplegia was not used widely for several years.

Gay and Ebert<sup>65</sup> and Tyres and colleagues<sup>66</sup> demonstrated that cardioplegia with lower potassium concentrations was

safe. Studies by Kirsch and colleagues,<sup>67</sup> Bretschneider and colleagues,<sup>68</sup> and Hearse and colleagues<sup>69</sup> demonstrated the effectiveness of cardioplegia with other constituents and renewed interest in this technique. Gay and Ebert in 1973 demonstrated a significant reduction in myocardial oxygen consumption during potassium-induced arrest when compared with that of the fibrillating heart.<sup>65</sup> They also showed that the problems in the use of the Melrose solution in the early days of cardiac surgery probably were caused by its hyperosmolar properties and perhaps not the high potassium concentration.

In a 1978 publication by Follette and colleagues,<sup>70</sup> the technique of blood cardioplegia was reintroduced. In experimental and clinical studies, these authors demonstrated that hypothermic, intermittent blood cardioplegia provided better myocardial protection than normothermic, continuous coronary perfusion and/or hypothermic, intermittent blood perfusion without cardioplegia solution. The composition of the best cardioplegia solution remains controversial, and new formulations, methods of delivery, and recommended temperatures continue to evolve.

# EVOLUTION OF CONGENITAL CARDIAC SURGERY DURING THE ERA OF CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS

With the advent of cardiopulmonary bypass using either the cross-circulation technique of Lillehei and colleagues or the version of the mechanical heart-lung machine used by Kirklin and colleagues, the two groups led the way for intracardiac repairs for many of the commonly occurring congenital heart defects. Because of the morbidity associated with the heart-lung machine, palliative operations also were developed to improve circulatory physiology without directly addressing the anatomic pathology. These palliative operations included the Blalock-Taussig subclavian—pulmonary arterial shunt<sup>30</sup> with modifications by Potts and colleagues<sup>71</sup> and Waterston,<sup>72</sup> the Blalock-Hanlon operation to create an ASD,<sup>73</sup> and the Galankin-Glenn superior vena cavaright pulmonary arterial shunt.<sup>35,36</sup>

As the safety of cardiopulmonary bypass improved steadily, surgeons addressed more and more complex abnormalities of the heart in younger and younger patients. Some of the milestones in the development of operations to correct congenital heart defects using cardiopulmonary bypass appear in Table 1-2.

#### VALVULAR SURGERY: CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS ERA

Cardiac valve repair or replacement under direct vision awaited the development of the heart-lung machine. The first successful aortic valve replacement (AVR) in the subcoronary position was performed by Dr. Dwight Harken and associates. <sup>91</sup> A caged-ball valve was used. Many of the techniques described in Harken's 1960 report are similar to those used today for AVR.

That same year, Starr and Edwards<sup>92</sup> successfully replaced the mitral valve using a caged-ball valve of their own design.

By 1967, nearly 2000 Starr-Edwards valves had been implanted, and the caged-ball-valve prosthesis was established as the standard against which all other mechanical prostheses would be compared.

In 1964, Starr and colleagues reported 13 patients who had undergone multiple valve replacement.<sup>93</sup> One patient had the aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valves replaced on February 21, 1963. Cartwright and colleagues, however, on November 1, 1961, were the first to replace both the aortic and mitral valves successfully with ball-valve prostheses that they had developed.<sup>94</sup> Knott-Craig and colleagues,<sup>95</sup> from the Mayo Clinic, successfully replaced all four heart valves in a patient with carcinoid involvement.

In 1961, Andrew Morrow and Edwin Brockenbrough<sup>96</sup> reported a treatment for idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis by resecting a portion of the thickened ventricular septum. They referred to this as *subaortic ventriculomyotomy*. They gave credit to William Cleland and H.H. Bentall in London, who had encountered this condition unexpectedly at operation and resected a small portion of the ventricular mass. The patient improved, but no postoperative hemodynamic studies had been reported. The subaortic ventriculomyotomy became the standard surgical treatment for this cardiac anomaly, although in some patients systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve necessitates mitral valve replacement with a low-profile mechanical valve.

An aortic homograft valve was used clinically for the first time by Heimbecker and colleagues in Toronto for replacement of the mitral valve in one patient and an aortic valve in another. Survival was short, 1 day in one patient and 1 month in the other. Donald Ross reported on the first successful aortic valve placement with an aortic valve homograft. He used a technique of subcoronary implantation developed in the laboratory by Carlos Duran and Alfred Gunning in Oxford.

The technique of AVR with a pulmonary autograft described initially by Ross in 1967 is advocated by some groups for younger patients who require AVR. <sup>99</sup> An aortic or pulmonary valve homograft is used to replace the pulmonary valve that has been transferred to the aortic position.

Other autogenous materials that have been used to manufacture valve prostheses include pericardium, fasciae latae, and dura mater. In the 1960s, Binet and colleagues<sup>100</sup> began to develop and test tissue valves. In 1964, Duran and Gunning in England replaced an aortic valve in a patient using a xenograft porcine aortic valve. Early results with formaldehyde-fixed xenografts were good,<sup>100</sup> but in a few years these valves began to fail because of tissue degeneration and calcification.<sup>101</sup> Carpentier and colleagues revitalized interest in xenograft valves by fixating porcine valves with glutaraldehyde. Carpentier also mounted his valves on a stent to produce a bioprosthesis. Carpentier-Edwards porcine valves and Hancock and Angell-Shiley bioprostheses became popular and were implanted in large numbers of patients.<sup>102,103</sup>

With the development of cardiopulmonary bypass, valves could be approached under direct vision, and for the first

time, mitral insufficiency could be attacked by reparative techniques. Techniques for mitral annuloplasty were described by Wooler and colleagues, <sup>104</sup> Reed and colleagues, <sup>105</sup> and Kay and colleagues. <sup>106</sup> The next step forward was development of annuloplasty rings by Carpentier and Duran. In the 1970s, few groups were involved in valve repairs. Slowly, techniques evolved, were tested clinically, and were followed over the years. Carpentier led the field by establishing the importance of careful analysis of valve pathology, describing in detail several techniques of valve repair, and reporting good results after early and late follow-up, especially with concomitant use of annuloplasty rings. <sup>107</sup>

From 1966 to 1968, a small epidemic of infective endocarditis in Detroit among heroin addicts broke out. Patients were dying of intractable gram-negative tricuspid valve endocarditis, often caused by *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*. Long-term antibiotic administration in combination with tricuspid valve replacement was 100% fatal. Starting in 1970, Arbulu operated on 55 patients; in 53, the tricuspid valve was removed without replacing it. <sup>108,109</sup> At 25 years, the actuarial survival is 61%.

Alan Cribier in Rouen France was first to successfully perform a transcatheter aortic valve insertion in a patient on

April 16, 2002.<sup>110</sup> Prospective clinical trials soon followed, which demonstrated that percutaneous aortic valve insertion improved 1 year survival compared to medically treated patients with critical aortic stenosis, and that this procedure had similar 30-day and 1-year mortalities when compared to the standard surgical procedure. There was, however, an increased rate of stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) with percutaneous approach.<sup>111,112</sup>

#### **CORONARY ARTERY SURGERY**

Selective coronary angiography was developed by Sones and Shirey at the Cleveland Clinic and reported in their 1962 classic paper entitled, "Cine Coronary Arteriography."<sup>113</sup> They used a catheter to inject contrast material directly into the coronary artery ostia. This technique gave a major impetus to direct revascularization of obstructed coronary arteries.

From 1960 to 1967, several sporadic instances of coronary grafting were reported. All were isolated cases and, for uncertain reasons, were not reproduced. None had an impact on the development of coronary surgery. Dr. Robert H. Goetz performed what appears to be the first clearly documented coronary artery bypass operation in a human, which was

successful. The surgery took place at Van Etten Hospital in New York City on May 2, 1960. 114 He operated on a 38-year-old man who was severely symptomatic and used a nonsuture technique to connect the right internal mammary artery to a right coronary artery. It took him 17 seconds to join the two arteries using a hollow metal tube. The right internal mammary artery—coronary artery connection was confirmed patent by angiography performed on the 14th postoperative day. The patient remained asymptomatic for about a year and then developed recurrent angina and died of a myocardial infarction on June 23, 1961. Goetz was severely criticized by his medical and surgical colleagues for this procedure, although he had performed it successfully many times in the animal laboratory. He never attempted another coronary bypass operation in a human.

Another example involved a case of autogenous saphenous vein bypass grafting performed on November 23, 1964, in a 42-year-old man who was scheduled to have endarterectomy of his left coronary artery.<sup>115</sup> Because the lesion involved the entire bifurcation, endarterectomy with venous patch graft was abandoned as too hazardous. The authors, Garrett, Dennis, and DeBakey, however, did not report this case until 1973. The patient was alive at that time, and angiograms showed the vein graft to be patent.

Shumaker<sup>116</sup> credits Longmire with the first internal mammary—coronary artery anastomosis. "It was almost surely Longmire, long-time chairman at UCLA, and his associate, Jack Cannon, who first performed an anastomosis between the internal mammary artery and a coronary branch, probably in early 1958."

The reference that Shumaker gives for this quotation from Longmire is a personal communication to Shumaker in 1990, which was 32 years after the fact!

As early as 1952, Vladimir Demikhov, the renowned Soviet surgeon, was anastomosing the internal mammary artery to the left coronary artery in dogs. <sup>117</sup> In 1967, at the height of the Cold War, a Soviet surgeon from Leningrad, V. I. Kolessov, reported his experience with mammary artery—coronary artery anastomoses for the treatment of angina pectoris in six patients in an American surgical journal. <sup>118</sup> The first patient in that series was done in 1964. Operations were performed through a left thoracotomy without extracorporeal circulation or preoperative coronary angiography. The following year, Green and colleagues<sup>119</sup> and Bailey and Hirose<sup>120</sup> separately published reports in which the internal mammary artery was used for coronary artery bypass in patients.

Rene Favalaro from the Cleveland Clinic used saphenous vein for bypassing coronary obstructions. <sup>121</sup> Favalaro's 1968 article focused on 15 patients, who were part of a larger series of 180 patients who had undergone the Vineberg procedure. In these 15 patients with occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery, an interpositional graft of saphenous vein also was placed between the ascending aorta and the right coronary artery distal to the blockage. The right coronary artery was divided, and the vein graft was anastomosed end to end. Favalaro states that this procedure was done because of the unfavorable results with pericardial patch reconstruction

of the coronary artery. In an addendum to that paper, 55 patients were added, 52 for segmental occlusion of the right coronary and 3 others for circumflex disease.

The contributions by Favalaro, Kolessov, Green and colleagues, and Bailey and Hirose all were important, but arguably the official start of coronary bypass surgery as we know it today happened in 1969 when W. Dudley Johnson and coworkers from Milwaukee reported their series of 301 patients who had undergone various operations for coronary artery disease (CAD) since February of 1967. In that report, the authors presented their results with direct coronary artery surgery during a 19-month period. They state:

After two initial and successful patch grafts, the vein bypass technique has been used exclusively. Early results were so encouraging that last summer the vein graft technique was expanded and used to all major branches. Vein grafts to the left side of the arteries run from the aorta over the pulmonary artery and down to the appropriate coronary vessel. Right-sided grafts run along the atrioventricular groove and also attach directly to the aorta. There is almost no limit of potential (coronary) arteries to use. Veins can be sutured to the distal anterior descending or even to posterior marginal branches. Double vein grafts are now used in more than 40% of patients and can be used to any combination of arteries.

#### Johnson goes on to say:

Our experience indicates that five factors are important to direct surgery. One: Do not limit grafts to proximal portions of large arteries. ... Two: Do not work with diseased arteries. Vein grafts can be made as long as necessary and should be inserted into distal normal arteries. Three: Always do end-to-side anastomoses. ... Four: Always work on a dry, quiet field. Consistently successful fine vessel anastomoses cannot be done on a moving, bloody target. ... Five: Do not allow the hematocrit to fall below 35.

In discussing Dr. Johnson's presentation, Dr. Frank Spencer commented:

I would like to congratulate Dr. Johnson very heartily. We may have heard a milestone in cardiac surgery today. Because for years, pathologists, cardiologists, and many surgeons have repeatedly stated that the pattern of coronary artery disease is so extensive that direct anastomosis can be done in only 5 to 7% of patients. If the exciting data by Dr. Johnson remain valid and the grafts remain patent over a long period of time, a total revision of thinking will be required regarding the feasibility of direct arterial surgery for CAD. 122

The direct anastomosis between the internal mammary artery and the coronary artery was not as popular initially as the vein-graft technique; however, owing to the persistence of Drs. Green, Loop, Grondin, and others, internal mammary artery grafts eventually became the conduit of choice when their superior long-term patency became known.<sup>123</sup>

Andreas Gruntzig working in Zurich, Switzerland, was the first to successfully dilate a stenotic coronary artery in a patient, percutaneously and used a balloon-tip catheter he had developed. The procedure was performed on September 16, 1977, on a 38-year-old woman with an 85% stenosis of the

left anterior descending coronary artery. In 1979, he reported on the first 50 patients to undergo percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA).<sup>124</sup> However despite the almost instant popularity of this procedure in the Western world, it was soon found that the restenosis rate was relatively high when compared with that of coronary bypass surgery, and there was also risk of sudden closure of the artery in the area that had been dilated.

Research in the animal laboratory with stents was carried out in the hope of solving these problems.

Jacque Puel in Toulouse, France, and shortly afterward, Ulrich Sigwart in Lausanne, Switzerland, were first to implant stents in patient's coronary arteries in the spring of 1986. 125–128 Although stents improved the results of PTCA and significantly decreased the incidence of acute coronary closure, the long-term patency rates in general were not as good as those in coronary bypass surgery. Therefore, stents that were impregnated with drugs or other chemicals were developed, which would be slowly released with hopes of decreasing the restenosis rate. Clinical trials with these drugeluting types of stents began in 2003 and indicate they are associated with a decrease in restenosis rates.

Denton Cooley and colleagues made two important contributions to the surgery for ischemic heart disease. <sup>129</sup> In 1956, with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, they were the first to repair a ruptured interventricular septum following acute myocardial infarction. The patient did well initially but died of complications 6 weeks after the operation. Cooley and colleagues also were the first to report the resection of a left ventricular aneurysm with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. <sup>130</sup>

#### **ARRHYTHMIC SURGERY**

Cobb and colleagues at Duke University developed the first successful surgical treatment for cardiac arrhythmias. <sup>131</sup> A 32-year-old fisherman was referred for symptomatic episodes of atrial tachycardia that caused CHF. On May 2, 1968, after epicardial mapping, a 5- to 6-cm cut was made extending from the base of the right atrial appendage to the right border of the right atrium during cardiopulmonary bypass. The incision transected the conduction pathway between the atrium and ventricle. Subsequent epicardial mapping indicated eradication of the pathway. Six weeks after the operation, heart size had decreased and lung fields had cleared. The patient eventually returned to work.

A year earlier, Dr. Dwight McGoon at the Mayo Clinic closed an ASD in a patient who also had Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. <sup>132</sup> At operation, Dr. Birchell mapped the epicardium of the heart and localized the accessory pathway to the right atrioventricular groove. Lidocaine was injected into the site, and the delta wave disappeared immediately. Unfortunately, conduction across the pathway reappeared a few hours later. This probably was the first attempt to treat the WPW syndrome surgically. As a result of knowledge gained from the surgical treatment for WPW syndrome, more than 95% of

all refractory clinical cases now are treated successfully by nonsurgical means.  $^{132}$ 

Ross and colleagues<sup>133</sup> in Sydney, Australia, and Cox and colleagues<sup>134</sup> in St. Louis, Missouri, used cryosurgical treatment of atrial ventricular node re-entry tachycardia. Subsequently, James L. Cox, after years of laboratory research, developed the Maze operation for atrial fibrillation.<sup>135</sup> That technique, with his subsequent modifications, is now known as the *Cox Maze procedure* and has become the world standard with which other techniques used to treat atrial fibrillation, either surgically or with catheters, are compared.<sup>136</sup>

Guiraudon and colleagues,<sup>136</sup> from Paris, reported their results with an encircling endomyocardial ventriculotomy for the treatment of malignant ventricular arrhythmias. The following year, in 1979, Josephson and colleagues<sup>137</sup> described a more specific procedure for treatment of malignant ventricular arrhythmias. After endocardial mapping, the endocardial source of the arrhythmia was excised. Although the Guiraudon technique usually isolated the source of the arrhythmia, the incision also devascularized healthy myocardium and was associated with high mortality. Endocardial resection was safer and more efficacious and became the basis of all approaches for the treatment of ischemic ventricular tachycardia.<sup>137</sup>

Stimulated by the death of a close personal friend from ventricular arrhythmias, Dr. Mirowski developed a prototype defibrillator over a 3-month period in 1969. In 1980, Mirowski and colleagues described three successful cases using their implantable myocardial stimulator at Johns Hopkins.<sup>138</sup>

Soon a version of Mirowski's defibrillator was commercially available. Initially centers implanting them were part of the clinical trials being conducted and required Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. The chest needed to be opened to place the relatively large electrodes directly on the ventricles. The battery used to power the device and generate the electrical shock was also large and was usually placed in the abdominal wall. Within 10 years, smaller, more advanced ventricular leads were developed and inserted percutaneously through the venous system. The battery was made much smaller in size. During the 1990s, clinical trials were conducted, which showed the automatic implantable cardiac defibrillators decreased mortality when compared to medically treated patients in subsets of patients prone to ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. As a result of these findings, the use of these devices has increased significantly. 139, 140

#### **PACEMAKERS**

In 1952, Paul Zoll applied electric shocks 2 ms in duration that were transmitted through the chest wall at frequencies from 25 to 60 per minute and increased the intensity of the shock until ventricular responses were observed. However, after 25 minutes of intermittent stimulation the patient died, although many subsequent patients recovered. The next step came when Lillehei and colleagues reported a series of patients who had external pacing after openheart surgery during the 1950s. The field of open-heart

surgery gave a major impetus to the development of pace-makers because there was a high incidence of heart block following many intracardiac repairs. The major difference between Zoll's pacing and that of Lillehei and colleagues was that Zoll used external electrodes placed on the chest wall, whereas Lillehei and colleagues attached electrodes directly to the heart at operation. Lillehei and colleagues used a relatively small external pacemaker to stimulate the heart and much less electric current. This form of heart pacing was better tolerated by the patient and was a more efficient way to stimulate the heart. The survival rate of Lillehei's patients with surgically induced heart block was improved significantly.

During this period, progress was made toward a totally implantable pacemaker. Elmquist and Senning<sup>143</sup> developed a pacer battery that was small enough for an epigastric pocket with electrodes connected to the heart. They implanted the unit in a patient with atrioventricular block in 1958. Just before implantation, the patient had 20 to 30 cardiac arrests a day. The first pacemaker that was implanted functioned only 8 hours; the second pacemaker implanted in the same patient had better success. The patient survived until January 2002 and had many additional pacemakers. Chardack and colleagues are perhaps better known for their development of the totally implantable pacemaker.<sup>144</sup> In 1961, they reported a series of 15 patients who had pacemakers that they had developed implanted.

Early implantable pacemakers were fixed-rate, asynchronous devices that delivered an impulse independent of the underlying cardiac rhythm. During the past 40 years, enormous progress has been made in the field of pacing technology. The number of individuals with artificial pacemakers is unknown; however, estimates indicate that approximately 500,000 Americans are living with a pacemaker and that each year another 100,000 or more patients require permanent pacemakers in the United States.

### HEART, HEART-LUNG, AND LUNG TRANSPLANTATION

Alexis Carrel and Charles Guthrie reported transplantation of the heart and lungs while at the University of Chicago in 1905. The heart of a small dog was transplanted into the neck of a larger one by anastomosing the caudad ends of the jugular vein and carotid artery to the aorta and pulmonary artery. The animal was not anticoagulated, and the experiment ended about 2 hours after circulation was established because of blood clot in the cavities of the transplanted heart.

Vladimir Demikhov, from Russia, described more than 20 different techniques for heart transplantation in 1950.<sup>146</sup> He also published various techniques for heart and lung transplantation. He was even able to perform an orthotopic heart transplant in a dog before the heart-lung machine was developed. This was accomplished by placing the donor heart above the dog's own heart, and then with a series of tubes and connections, he rerouted the blood from one heart to the

other until he had the donor heart functioning in the appropriate position and the native heart removed. One of his dogs climbed the steps of the Kremlin on the sixth postoperative day but died shortly afterward of rejection.

Richard Lower and Norman Shumway established the technique for heart transplantation as it is performed today. 147 Preservation of the cuff of recipient left and right atria with part of the atrial septum was described earlier by Brock 148 in England and Demikhov 117 in Russia, 149 but it became popular only after Shumway and Lower reported it in their 1960 paper.

The first attempt at human heart transplantation was made by Hardy and colleagues<sup>150</sup> at the University of Mississippi. Because no human donor organ was available at the time, a large chimpanzee's heart was used; however, it was unable to support the circulation because of hyperacute rejection.

The first human-to-human heart transplant occurred on December 3, 1967, in Capetown, South Africa. 151 The surgical team, headed by Christiaan Barnard, transplanted the heart of a donor who had been certified dead after the electrocardiogram showed no activity for 5 minutes into a 54-year-old man whose heart was irreparably damaged by repeated myocardial infarctions. The second human heart transplant using a human donor was performed on a child 3 days after the first on December 6, 1967, by Adrian Kantrowitz in Brooklyn, New York. Dr. Kantrowitz's patient died of a bleeding complication within the first 24 hours. 152 Barnard's patient, Lewis Washkansky, died on the 18th postoperative day. At autopsy, the heart appeared normal, and there was no evidence of chronic liver congestion, but bilateral pneumonia was present, possibly owing to severe myeloid depression from immunosuppression.<sup>153</sup>

On January 2, 1968, Barnard performed a second heart transplant on Phillip Blaiberg, 12 days after Washkansky's death. Blaiberg was discharged from the hospital and became a celebrity during the several months he lived after the transplant. Blaiberg's procedure indicated that a heart transplant was an option for humans suffering from end-stage heart disease. Within a year of Barnard's first heart transplant, 99 heart transplants had been performed by cardiac surgeons around the world. However, by the end of 1968, most groups abandoned heart transplantation because of the extremely high mortality related to rejection. Shumway and Lower, Barnard, and a few others persevered both clinically and in the laboratory. Their efforts in discovering better drugs for immunosuppression eventually established heart transplantation as we know it today.

A clinical trial of heart-lung transplantation was commenced at Stanford University in 1981 by Reitz and colleagues. Their first patient was treated with a combination of cyclosporine and azathioprine. The patient was discharged from the hospital in good condition and was well more than 5 years after the transplant.

The current success with heart, heart-lung, and lung transplantation is related in part to the discovery of cyclosporine by workers at the Sandoz Laboratory in Basel, Switzerland, in 1970. In December of 1980, cyclosporine was introduced
