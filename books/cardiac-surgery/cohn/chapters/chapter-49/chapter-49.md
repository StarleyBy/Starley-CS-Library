# Descending and Thoracoabdominal Aortic Aneurysms

Joseph S. Coselli • Kim de la Cruz • Ourania Preventza • Scott A. LeMaire

Treating aneurysms that arise from the aortic segments distal to the left subclavian artery poses challenges that are distinct from those presented by aneurysms of the more proximal ascending and arch segments. The distal aortic segments comprise the descending thoracic aorta, which extends from the left subclavian artery to the diaphragm within the chest, and the abdominal segment that extends from the diaphragm to the iliac bifurcation. The diaphragm divides the thoracic aorta from the abdominal aorta.

An aortic aneurysm that is limited to the chest (distal to the left subclavian artery) is classified as a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm (DTAA). An aortic aneurysm that traverses the diaphragm and extends into both the chest and the abdomen to any degree is considered a thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) (Fig. 49-1). Aneurysms in these locations can be extensive and can involve many or all of the aortic branch vessels. In the last decade there have been substantial changes regarding the treatment of distal aortic aneurysms because of the emergence of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) and its near dominance in DTAA repair. Although open repair remains the standard of care for TAAAs, it is now selectively used for DTAAs. Modern critical care and continually refined surgical adjuncts for organ protection have made the outcomes of surgical repair better than they were in previous decades, but operative treatment of DTAA and TAAA continues to represent a significant clinical challenge to the cardiovascular surgeon.

#### **PATHOGENESIS**

The etiology of DTAA and TAAA has changed over time. Whereas tertiary syphilis was the most common cause of thoracic aneurysms in the early 1900s, other causes are more prevalent today. Well-established causes of DTAA and TAAA include medial degeneration, atherosclerosis, aortic dissection, connective tissue disorders, aortitis (eg, Takayasu

arteritis), aortic coarctation, infection, and trauma. As our understanding of genetics increases, and as more advanced genetic testing becomes available, classification systems are likely to evolve to include more molecular factors. Perhaps partly because of improved screening for aneurysmal disease and the increasing age of the population, it is certain that the incidence and prevalence of thoracic aortic aneurysms are increasing over time.<sup>1</sup>

The most common types of aneurysms of the descending and thoracoabdominal aorta today are grouped into the category of atherosclerotic aneurysms. Unfortunately, although this term may be descriptive, it may not accurately describe the mechanism of aneurysmal changes. Although atherosclerosis and aortic aneurysms share common risk factors and frequently coexist, thoracic aortic aneurysms are primarily the result of age-related medial degeneration, which is characterized by changes in elastin and collagen that reduce aortic integrity and tensile strength. Subsequent aortic enlargement and aneurysm formation provide fertile ground for superimposed intimal atherosclerosis and further degeneration of the aortic wall. The usual histologic changes in the aging aorta include elastin fragmentation, fibrosis with increased collagen deposition, and medial degeneration.<sup>2</sup> As with most aneurysmogenic processes, medial degeneration usually causes diffuse, fusiform aortic dilatation. In some cases, medial degeneration produces discrete saccular aneurysms along the descending thoracic aorta; however, saccular aneurysms are more commonly associated with aortic infection (see below). Additionally, saccular aneurysms may be superimposed on or coexist with more generalized, fusiform aneurysmal disease of the thoracoabdominal aorta.

Risk factors for aortic dissection and aortic aneurysm overlap to a great extent, but once an aorta becomes dissected, the dissection itself becomes an independent risk factor for subsequent dilation and aneurysmal changes. Two of the DeBakey types of aortic dissection involve the distal aorta: type I, in

which nearly the entire length of the aorta is dissected, and type III, in which the dissection is limited to varying portions of the distal aorta, and the proximal aorta is unaffected. Aortic dissections occur in the medial layer separating the intima from the adventitia; blood flows through the true aortic lumen and through one or more false lumen channels that can form at various points along the aorta. This process weakens the outer aortic wall, making it prone to progressive aneurysmal dilatation (Fig. 49-2).

In survivors of DeBakey type I dissection, the persistence of a pressurized false lumen has been associated with subsequent distal aneurysm formation, need for intervention, and increased mortality.³ In an attempt to thrombose the false channel and thereby decrease the risk of late aneurysm formation, endovascular strategies have been developed to exclude segments of the false lumen in both acute (≤2 weeks since onset)⁴ and chronic⁵ aortic dissection. Such approaches are dependent on a variety of factors, including the extent of aortic dissection; downstream portions of the false lumen—those without endovascular obliteration—continue to be pressurized and may perfuse upstream portions in a retrograde fashion.

Penetrating aortic ulcers and intramural hematomas are two variants of aortic dissection that can occur in the descending and abdominal aortic segments. Penetrating aortic ulcers are disrupted atherosclerotic plaques that can penetrate the aortic wall, leading to classic dissection or rupture. Intramural hematomas are collections of blood within the aortic wall that occur without an intimal tear; growth of the hematoma can result in classic dissection.

Genetic mutations or defects can give rise to defective components of the aortic extracellular matrix, leading to aortic aneurysm and dissection. Aortic aneurysms that occur in patients with these genetic disorders can be a part of a named syndrome, accompanied by a constellation of extraaortic symptoms, or they may be part of a heterogeneous group of familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections that occur in isolation. In a national registry of genetically triggered thoracic aortic aneurysms, Marfan syndrome is the most common genetic cause of aortic aneurysms (36%).<sup>6</sup> Marfan syndrome is a connective tissue disorder that results

from a fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene mutation; the altered fibrillin leads to aberrant signaling of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) and other events that lead to the deposition of extensive amounts of mucopolysaccharides in the aortic extracellular matrix and fragmentation of elastic fibers. The aorta in Marfan syndrome patients is prone to dissection, which is the most common cause of DTAAs and TAAAs in these patients.<sup>7,8</sup> Other syndromes that are infrequently encountered during DTAA and TAAA repairs include vascular Ehlers-Danlos, aneurysms-osteoarthritis, and Loeys-Dietz. Like Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder that is linked to an alteration in TGF-β signaling. First described in 2005, Loeys-Dietz is a particularly aggressive aortic disorder, characterized by vascular tortuosity, and a greater propensity for rupture at smaller aortic diameters than in patients with Marfan syndrome. Recently, four types of Loeys-Dietz have been identified, each associated with a mutation in a particular gene: transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta receptor I (TGFBR1), TGF-beta receptor II (*TGFBR2*), decapentaplegic homolog 3 (*SMAD3*), and transforming growth factor beta 2 ligand (TGFB2).9

Both chronic, nonspecific aortitis and systemic autoimmune disorders—such as Takayasu arteritis, giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis), and rheumatoid aortitis—can cause destruction of the aortic media and progressive aneurysm formation. Although Takayasu arteritis usually causes obstructive lesions related to severe intimal thickening, the associated medial destruction can result in aneurysmal dilatation.

Aneurysms involving the upper descending thoracic aorta can develop in patients with congenital aortic coarctation. These aneurysms may occur concomitantly with unrepaired native coarctation or years after any manner of coarctation repair, including endovascular repair. The postrepair aneurysms appear to be more common in patients who have had balloon angioplasty than in those who underwent surgery; this is speculated to be due to the rupture of elastic fibers during dilatation. It

Infection can produce a saccular "mycotic" aneurysm in a localized area of the aortic wall that has been damaged by the infectious process. For unknown reasons, such mycotic aneurysms tend to occur along the lesser curvature of the transverse aortic arch or in the upper abdominal aorta adjacent to the origins of the visceral branches. In such cases, only a portion of the aortic circumference is affected; consequently, localized weakening causes a diverticular or saccular outpouching. Common causative organisms include Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Salmonella, and Streptococcus, 12 and more than one pathogen may be present. Although uncommon, when a distal mycotic aneurysm is suspected, urgent evaluation is warranted; mycotic saccular aneurysms tend to be unpredictable, often have periods of rapid growth, and rupture more readily than fusiform aneurysms caused by medial degeneration.<sup>13</sup>

Each of the disease processes described above causes aneurysms through progressive degeneration and dilatation of the aortic wall. In contrast, pseudoaneurysms of the thoracic aorta form as the result of chronic leaks through discrete

defects in the aortic wall. These leaks are initially contained by surrounding tissue; the accumulation of organized thrombus and the associated fibrosis forms the wall of the pseudoaneurysm. Pseudoaneurysms can develop after aortic surgery, endovascular aortic repair, invasive imaging, or from primary defects in the aortic wall. Unrepaired blunt and penetrating injuries are the other common cause of aortic pseudoaneurysms. Chronic traumatic pseudoaneurysms typically develop in the proximal descending thoracic aorta after blunt aortic injuries; the management of these lesions is covered in detail in a subsequent chapter.

#### **NATURAL HISTORY**

An untreated aneurysm in the thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta can progress to dissection, rupture, or both if given enough time. A dissected aorta that was originally of normal caliber will tend to dilate and become aneurysmal. The causes and genetics of these aneurysms vary, but there are commonalities in the mechanical and pathophysiologic aspects of their formation and development. Understanding these processes will help surgeons determine the timing and the nature of the operative intervention needed.

An aneurysm is defined as a permanent dilation of an artery to at least 1.5 times its normal diameter at a given location.<sup>14</sup> However, the normal aortic diameter is perhaps more difficult to define because it varies by the patient's age, gender, and body size. Even when adjusted for age and body surface area, mean aortic size is significantly smaller in women than in men; on average, aortic diameter is 2 to 3 mm greater in men than in women. In the community-based Framingham Heart Study, computed tomography studies from 3431 adults, at least 35 years old, were analyzed by age, gender, and body surface area. At the descending thoracic aorta, the average aortic diameter was 25.8 mm for men and 23.1 mm for women; at the infrarenal abdominal aorta, it was 19.3 mm for men and 16.7 mm for women; and at the lower abdominal aorta, it was 18.7 mm for men and 16.0 mm for women.15 In this study, aortic enlargement was strongly correlated with male gender, advancing age, and increased body surface area—for men ≥ 65 years old and with a large body surface area (≥2.1), the mean descending thoracic aortic diameter increased by 4.5 to 30.3 mm; and for women ≥ 65 years and with a large body surface area (≥1.9), this increased by 4.0 to 27.1 mm. Notably, body surface area is a better predictor of aortic size than height or weight, particularly in patients less than 50 years of age. 16

The descending thoracic aorta has a slightly higher rate of expansion over time than the ascending aorta and is noted to average 1 to 4 mm/year.<sup>17</sup> The rate is not constant, and it increases as the diameter increases. A dissection in an otherwise small aneurysm can lead to a sudden increase in the rate of growth; likewise, a chronically dissected aorta tends to dilate at a faster rate than a nondissected one. The relationship among pressure, vessel diameter, and vessel wall tension is described by Laplace's law. As the luminal diameter increases, there is increasing wall tension, which in turn

contributes to the cycle of progressive dilatation. Unfortunately, as the dilation progresses, the wall tension eventually becomes too great for the maximally stretched aortic wall. A tear can occur within the intimal and medial layers, resulting in a dissection that propagates down the length of the aorta, or a tear can penetrate the full thickness of the aortic wall, resulting in contained or free rupture. The aortic size at which this event occurs is determined by several factors, including the presence or absence of a connective tissue disorder, the presence and severity of hypertension, and the patient's body size. In a large series of patients, Elefteriades and colleagues<sup>18</sup> have shown that in the thoracic aorta, there is a sharp increase in the incidence of aortic complications at aneurysmal diameters greater than 6 cm, with a 14% combined risk of rupture, dissection, and death. In a population-based study, the 5-year risk of rupture doubled from 16% for aneurysms 4 to 5.9 cm in diameter to 31% in aneurysms 6 cm or more in diameter.<sup>19</sup>

# CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND DIAGNOSIS

At the time of diagnosis, patients with DTAAs and TAAAs are commonly asymptomatic. For example, Panneton and Hollier<sup>20</sup> reported that degenerative TAAAs are asymptomatic in roughly 43% of patients. In asymptomatic patients, DTAAs and TAAAs are often discovered when imaging studies are performed to evaluate unrelated problems. For example, computed tomography scans may indicate aortic dilatation, and chest radiographs may show widening of the descending thoracic aortic shadow, which may be outlined by a rim of calcification outlining the dilated aneurysmal aortic wall (Fig. 49-3). Aneurysmal calcium may also be seen in the upper abdomen on standard radiograms.

Although DTAAs and TAAAs remain asymptomatic for long periods of time, most ultimately produce a variety of symptoms before they rupture. Degenerative TAAAs produce symptoms in approximately 57% of patients; 9% of patients present with rupture.20 The most frequent symptom is back pain between the scapulae. When the aneurysm is large in the region of the aortic hiatus, pressure on adjacent structures may cause mid-back and epigastric pain. Other potential signs and symptoms related to compression or erosion of adjacent organs include stridor, wheezing, cough, hemoptysis, dysphagia, and gastrointestinal obstruction or bleeding. Hoarseness results from traction on the vagus nerve as the distal aortic arch expands and causes recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis. Thoracic or lumbar vertebral body erosion (Fig. 49-4) causes back pain, spinal instability, and neurologic deficits from spinal cord compression; mycotic aneurysms have a peculiar propensity to destroy vertebral bodies. Additionally, neurologic symptoms, including paraplegia, paraparesis, or both, may result from thrombosis of intercostal and lumbar arteries. This is most frequently seen with acute aortic dissection, which may occur primarily or be superimposed on medial degenerative fusiform aneurysmal

disease. Thoracic aortic aneurysms, like aneurysms in other locations, may produce distal emboli of clot or atheromatous debris that gradually obliterate and thrombose visceral, renal, or lower-extremity branches.

Imaging technology is critical in diagnosis and determining anatomic details for operative planning. Computed

tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) enable clinicians to obtain excellent images without the potential morbidity or cost associated with angiography. CT scanning is widely available and can image the entire thoracic and abdominal aorta, major branch vessels, and virtually all adjacent organs. Computer programs can construct sagittal, coronal, and oblique images, as well as three-dimensional reconstructions, from CT data. Contrastenhanced CT scanning (Figs. 49-2, 49-4, and 49-5) also provides information about the aortic lumen, intraluminal thrombus, presence of aortic dissection, intramural hematoma, mediastinal or retroperitoneal hematoma, aortic rupture, and periaortic fibrosis associated with inflammatory aneurysms.<sup>21</sup> CT angiography with multiplanar reconstruction is especially useful for planning endovascular procedures. Advantages of CT include being less expensive and somewhat quicker to perform than MRA and, at present, the wider availability of CT expertise. Also, CT can be used with patients who have implanted ferromagnetic prostheses or other devices, which can cause injury in patients undergoing MRA. The chief advantages of MRA are that it does not expose the patient to ionizing radiation and that it reveals disease within the aortic wall, including intramural hemorrhage. The gadolinium-based contrast agents used in MRA were once considered to be safer for patients with renal insufficiency than CT contrast media. Ironically, reports have associated the use of certain gadolinium-based contrast agents with nephrogenic

systemic fibrosis (NSF)—a scleroderma-like fibrotic process that can affect not only the skin but also internal organs—in patients with renal insufficiency.<sup>22</sup> The current recommendation is to avoid using such agents in patients with advanced renal failure (ie, with a glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min) or in patients who are dialysis-dependent.<sup>23</sup>

Ongoing improvements in noninvasive imaging modalities have substantially reduced the role of catheter aortography in assessing thoracic aortic aneurysms. However, catheter aortography remains useful in situations where noninvasive methods are not feasible—for example, when artifact or heavy calcification obscures the area of interest. Anterior, posterior, oblique, and lateral views provide detailed information about branch vessels. The risks posed by aortography include renal toxicity from the large volumes of contrast material required to adequately fill large aneurysms. There is also a risk of embolization from laminated thrombus secondary to manipulation of intraluminal catheters. Furthermore, angiography underestimates the size of an aneurysm in areas of laminated thrombus. Nonetheless, angiography can be helpful in patients with suspected renal or visceral ischemia, aortoiliac occlusive disease, horseshoe kidney, or peripheral aneurysms.

# DETERMINING APPROPRIATE TREATMENT

Whenever possible, patients with known aortic disease (ie, patients with previous aortic dissection, prior aortic repair, or abnormal aortic diameter) are regularly followed by an imaging surveillance protocol to monitor the possible development of distal aortic aneurysm. For this and other incidental findings, once an aneurysm involving the descending thoracic or thoracoabdominal aorta has been discovered, precise determination of the extent and severity of disease is the critical next step toward clarifying the specific diagnosis, determining the appropriate treatment, and, when repair is indicated, planning the appropriate intervention.

## Indications for Operation

In asymptomatic patients, the decision to consider surgical repair is based primarily on the diameter of the aneurysm. To prevent fatal rupture, current guidelines recommend elective operation when the aortic diameter exceeds 5.5 cm in cases of chronic dissection and 6 cm in cases of degenerative aneurysm. In patients with connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and related disorders, the diameterbased threshold for operation is lowered. Although guidelines specify a rapid dilatation rate for only the proximal aorta, indicating repair when expansion exceeds 0.5 cm/year, it is not unreasonable to apply this threshold to the distal aorta as well.<sup>24</sup> Nonoperative management—which consists of strict blood pressure control, cessation of smoking, and at least yearly surveillance with imaging studies—is appropriate for asymptomatic patients who have small aneurysms. Symptomatic patients, however, are at increased risk of rupture and

warrant expeditious evaluation and urgent aneurysm repair, even when the abovementioned threshold diameters have not been reached. The onset of new pain in a patient with a known aneurysm is particularly concerning and often heralds significant expansion, leakage, or impending rupture. Malperfusion caused by chronic dissection is also an indication for TAAA repair. Degenerative DTAAs and TAAAs with superimposed acute dissection are especially prone to rupture and are therefore treated with emergent repair.

#### **Endovascular Considerations**

Since 2005, when a TEVAR device was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat DTAA, indications for TEVAR have expanded, and TEVAR devices are now approved for treating all lesions of the descending thoracic aorta—acute or chronic aortic dissection, penetrating aortic ulcer, and blunt trauma—with suitable anatomy. In contrast, custom-manufactured fenestrated or branched endovascular repair of TAAA remains experimental in the United States with ongoing clinical trials.<sup>25</sup> Although endovascular repairs are covered in detail in a subsequent chapter, all patients in our practice are evaluated for possible endovascular intervention, and an individualized surgical option best suited for the patient is selected. Appropriate anatomy is also critical for successful endovascular repair. Landing zones that have inadequate length, excessive angulation, extensive intraluminal thrombus, dissection in the proximal landing zone, or severe vessel calcification will not allow secure endograft fixation, precluding endovascular repair. Two important factors to consider when deciding between open and endovascular aneurysm repair are the patient's physiologic reserve and vascular anatomy.<sup>26</sup> Open repairs have well-documented outcomes and excellent long-term durability, and they allow repair of aneurysms with complex anatomy. However, the patients must have considerable physiologic reserve to undergo and recover from these procedures.

Hybrid, off-label approaches that combine open and endovascular repair have been selectively used to repair DTAAs and TAAAs. A common type of hybrid DTAA repair involves extending the proximal landing zone by rerouting the left subclavian artery such that the endograft may cover the ostia of the left subclavian artery; this has been done in fairly large numbers of patients and is thought to add little risk and protect against the risk of stroke.<sup>27</sup> Additionally, a traditional open "elephant trunk" repair—which leaves a small section of replacement graft floating in the descending thoracic aorta after replacing the aortic arch—can be subsequently combined with TEVAR, either as part of the initial repair or in a subsequent procedure (see following section). Hybrid "elephant trunk" procedures involve landing the proximal portion of the endograft in the trunk, but this approach is not widely used. In contrast, "frozen elephant trunk" procedures (performed in a single stage) are now commonly performed in Europe, especially for the treatment of acute DeBakey type I dissections, with the use of several readily available hybrid devices. The ultimate goal of this approach is to thrombose the false lumen to prevent additional

late aortic complications.<sup>28</sup> In the United States, there are several versions of this approach, including the antegrade placement of the endograft in the proximal descending thoracic aorta after proximal hemiarch repair.<sup>29</sup>

Hybrid TAAA approaches typically involve open visceral bypass grafting, which is performed to secure organ perfusion, and followed by stent-graft coverage of the entire aneurysm, including visceral and other branch-vessel ostia. However, a recent approach to hybrid TAAA repair involves replacing the visceral portion of aorta with a multibranched graft in an open fashion (such as in an extent III or IV repair) and repairing the more proximal section of the descending thoracic aorta with a stent graft that is then secured to the proximal section of the multibranched graft.<sup>30</sup> Although hybrid TAAA procedures are somewhat less invasive than open TAAA repair, they have not yet yielded a substantial decrease in morbidity and mortality rates, and patient fitness must again be considered in order to obtain an optimal outcome.<sup>31</sup>

Other off-label approaches to TAAA repair include the use of parallel grafts (also called "chimney," "sandwich," or "snorkel" approaches); a large diameter endograft is used to cover the aneurysm, and a small diameter stent is run parallel to the main endograft and into branching arteries so that they are perfused. In select patients with substantial comorbidities, parallel endovascular repair remains an option; however, because published reports describe only small patient series, 25 it is difficult to judge the utility of this approach. The same is true for the multilayer modulator stent, which is now being used for TAAA repair outside the United States, because only short-term data are available. 32

Endovascular descending thoracic aortic repair is widespread, and its use to treat degenerative aneurysm should be strongly considered when feasible per current US guidelines.<sup>24</sup> Furthermore, recent 5-year evidence from the INSTEAD-XL randomized trial of 140 patients with uncomplicated chronic aortic dissection who underwent either optimal medical therapy or TEVAR with optimal medical therapy suggests that TEVAR substantially improves late aortic-specific survival and delays disease progression.<sup>5</sup> Data suggest that, in general, endovascular repair of the descending thoracic aorta is associated with less early mortality and morbidity than open repair,<sup>33,34</sup> and TEVAR is less likely to be affected by whether the repair is performed at a high-volume or lowvolume center,<sup>35</sup> even in cases of rupture.<sup>36</sup> However, the early survival benefit may be lost within a few years after repair, because 5-year survival is similar between those with open and endovascular Medicare cohorts<sup>37</sup> or is worse after endovascular repair.<sup>38,39</sup> There also appears to be a greater need for reintervention after TEVAR than after open DTAA repair.<sup>39-41</sup> Of interest, emerging evidence suggests that different aortic pathologies (degenerative aneurysm vs chronic dissection vs acute dissection) are associated with different modes of repair failure after TEVAR. 42,43

Because endovascular aortic repair has become substantially more common in recent years and the indications for its use have evolved, these devices are increasingly encountered in subsequent open operations. Complications after

endovascular repair may result from progression of the aneurysmal process to an adjacent portion of the aorta that is not amenable to further endovascular treatment, progressive dilation of the treated segment owing to persistent endoleak, infection of the endovascular device, or device migration. In certain cases, endovascular devices do not incorporate into the aneurysm thrombus and aortic intima in the way that conventional Dacron grafts incorporate into the periadventitial tissue. Explantation of the endovascular device and open graft replacement of the thoracic aorta can be accomplished with relatively good success. 44-46 In the absence of infection, salvaging the device or portions of the device is also possible. Although we have applied the aortic cross-clamp to a proximal aortic segment with an endovascular stent graft in place and repaired a distal segment in an open fashion, in cases in which the stent graft encroaches on the aortic arch, it may not be possible to place a cross-clamp, and hypothermic circulatory arrest may be needed. Suturing an existing stent graft to a standard Dacron graft in a hemostatic fashion is also feasible, particularly if the surrounding aortic tissue can be incorporated into the suture line. Notably, endovascular aortic repair in patients with connective tissue disorders is not supported by current US guidelines;<sup>24</sup> however, selective use as bridge to open repair or to treat late complications of open repair may be an appropriate strategy. 47,48

#### PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION

In each patient, the indications for operation discussed above are weighed against the risks posed by surgical intervention. 49,50 The Crawford classification of TAAA (Fig. 49-6) permits standardized reporting of the extent of aortic involvement, thereby allowing appropriate risk stratification, choice of specific treatment modalities according to the extent of the aneurysm, and a type-specific determination of the risks for neurologic deficits and other morbidities and mortality associated with TAAA repair. Extent I TAAA repairs involve replacing most or all of the descending thoracic aorta and the upper abdominal aorta. Extent II repairs involve most or all of the descending thoracic aorta and extend into the infrarenal abdominal aorta. Extent III repairs involve the distal half or less of the descending thoracic aorta and varying portions of the abdominal aorta. Extent IV repairs involve most or all of the abdominal aorta. In general, less extensive distal aortic repair (DTAA, extents III and IV TAAA) tend to pose less operative risk than more extensive distal aortic repair (extents I and II TAAA), although patientspecific disease, such as having a heavy atherosclerotic burden, can increase risk in lesser repairs.

Most commonly, patients with DTAA and TAAA meeting criteria for repair are in their mid-to-late 60s. Younger patients tend to include those patients with connective tissue disorders or chronic aortic dissection. Additionally, there appears to be substantial differences in patient characteristics by extent of repair. Regarding our comprehensive TAAA experience, 51 about 10% of TAAA patients have a connective tissue disorder; however, this increases to 17% in extent II repairs and decreases to 5% in extent IV TAAA repair. Chronic aortic

dissection is present in nearly a third of patients; this proportion is increased in extent I and II repairs (39 and 44%, respectively) and decreased in extent III and IV repairs (19 and 11%, respectively). Furthermore, while roughly a quarter of TAAA patients have had a prior distal aortic repair, this rate is increased in extent III and IV repairs (42 and 36%)—this speaks to the progressive nature of repair in extents III and IV, as many of these prior repairs were abdominal aortic repairs.

An adequate preoperative assessment of physiologic reserve is critical in evaluating operative risk. Many patients have significant comorbidities; chronic pulmonary obstructive disease, coronary artery disease, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease are all relatively common in TAAA repair. Chronic elevated serum creatinine levels (>3.0 mg/dL) are relatively uncommon in patients undergoing TAAA repair, and affect 3% of patients in our experience.<sup>51</sup> Unless they require emergency operation, patients undergo a thorough preoperative evaluation with emphasis on cardiac, pulmonary, and renal function.

#### **Cardiac Status**

Impaired myocardial contractility and reduced coronary reserve are common among elderly patients who undergo aortic reconstruction. Patients need substantial cardiac reserve in order to tolerate clamping of the thoracic aorta. Given the prevalence of preoperative cardiac disease and the physiologic strain of aortic clamping, it is not surprising that cardiac complications are a major cause of postoperative mortality. Reports indicate that cardiac disease has been responsible for 49% of early deaths and 34% of late deaths after TAAA repair, attesting to the importance of careful preoperative cardiac evaluation. 20,52

Several imaging techniques are useful in preoperative screening for cardiac disease. Transthoracic echocardiography is noninvasive and can satisfactorily evaluate both valvular and biventricular function. Dipyridamole-thallium myocardial scanning identifies regions of myocardium that are reversibly ischemic, and it is more practical than exercise testing in this generally elderly population, whose exercise capacity is often limited by concurrent lower-extremity peripheral vascular disease. In patients with evidence of reversible ischemia on noninvasive studies, and in those with a significant history of angina or an ejection fraction of 30% or less, cardiac catheterization and coronary arteriography are performed. Patients who have asymptomatic aneurysms and severe coronary artery occlusive disease (ie, significant left main, proximal left anterior descending, or triple-vessel coronary artery stenosis) undergo myocardial revascularization before aneurysm repair. In appropriate patients, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty is carried out before surgery. If clamping proximal to the left subclavian artery is anticipated in patients in whom the left internal thoracic artery has been used as a coronary artery bypass graft, a left-carotid-to-subclavian bypass is typically necessary to prevent cardiac ischemia when the aortic clamp is applied.<sup>53</sup>

#### **Renal Status**

Preoperative renal insufficiency has been a major risk factor for early mortality throughout the history of TAAA repair. <sup>49,54</sup> It was among the predictive variables selected in Svensson et al's<sup>54</sup> multivariable analysis of Crawford's complete experience with TAAA surgery in 1509 patients treated between 1960 and 1991. Patients with severely impaired renal function who are not receiving long-term hemodialysis

frequently require temporary hemodialysis early after operation and are clearly at increased risk for postoperative complications.

Although patients are not rejected as surgical candidates on the basis of renal function, careful assessment of renal function aids in estimating perioperative risk and adjusting treatment strategies accordingly. Renal function is assessed preoperatively by measuring serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine. Kidney size and perfusion can be evaluated by using the imaging studies obtained to assess the aorta. Patients who have poor renal function secondary to severe proximal renal artery occlusive disease are revascularized at operation by renal arterial endarterectomy, stenting under direct vision, or bypass grafting, with the expectation that renal function will stabilize or improve.<sup>52</sup>

Because of the nephrotoxic effects of vascular contrast agents, surgery is delayed (if possible) for 24 hours or longer after CT scanning or aortography has been performed. This is especially important in patients with preexisting renal impairment. Strategies to reduce the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy include periprocedural administration of acetylcysteine and intravenous hydration. If renal insufficiency occurs or worsens after contrast administration, the surgical procedure is postponed until renal function returns to baseline or is satisfactorily stabilized.

## **Pulmonary Status**

Pulmonary complications are the most common form of postoperative morbidity in patients who undergo DTAA and TAAA repairs. Most patients undergo pulmonary function screening with arterial blood gases and spirometry. Patients with an FEV<sub>1</sub> greater than 1.0 and a PCO<sub>2</sub> less than 45 mmHg are satisfactory surgical candidates. In suitable patients, borderline pulmonary function frequently is improved by smoking cessation, progressive treatment of bronchitis, weight loss, and a general exercise program that the patient follows for a period of 1 to 3 months before operation. However, surgery is not withheld from patients with symptomatic aortic aneurysms and poor pulmonary function. In such patients, preservation of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, phrenic nerve, and diaphragmatic function is particularly important.

#### **OPEN SURGICAL REPAIR**

## **Anesthetic Strategies**

Coordination among the surgeon, anesthesiologist, and perfusionist is critical during a DTAA or TAAA repair procedure. Management of hemodynamics during aortic clamping and unclamping, blood volume management, anticoagulation and hemostasis, and proper lung management occur in real time, with anticipation and preparation by the anesthesia team. Swan-Ganz catheters are routinely used for hemodynamic monitoring. The arterial catheter is placed in the right radial artery whenever the left subclavian artery flow may be interrupted during aortic clamping. A large-bore central

venous line is necessary for volume return. We reinfuse filtered, unwashed whole blood from the cell saver through a rapid infusion system during periods of substantial blood loss, such as when the aorta is opened. With careful scavenging of shed blood and meticulous surgical hemostasis, operations without the use of blood and blood products are frequently possible. However, when coagulopathy does occur after the cross-clamp is released, rapid replacement of blood components with fresh frozen plasma, platelets, and cryoprecipitate is necessary. Single lung ventilation, usually by a double-lumen endobronchial tube, is necessary for exposure, although this may not be critical in extent IV TAAA repairs. The lung is handled minimally during anticoagulation to prevent lung hematoma and contusion. Deflating the left lung reduces retraction trauma to the lung, improves exposure, and alleviates the risk of cardiac compression. When motor evoked potentials are used for spinal cord monitoring, muscle paralytics must be avoided. Sodium bicarbonate solution is routinely infused to prevent acidosis during aortic crossclamping, and mannitol can be given before cross-clamping to enhance renal perfusion. Proximal blood pressure, afterload, and cardiac performance are closely monitored by Swan-Ganz catheter and transesophageal echocardiography probe when necessary and are aggressively maintained.

## Surgical Adjuncts for Organ Protection

Organ ischemia is a major source of the morbidity related to DTAA and TAAA repair. We currently employ a multimodal approach (Table 49-1) that is primarily based on the extent of repair in an attempt to maximize organ protection during these operations (Fig. 49-7). The rationale for and details of several important strategies are discussed below.

#### **HEPARIN**

Potential benefits of heparinization include preserving the microcirculation and preventing embolization. Additionally,

is stopped, and the remainder of the aneurysm is opened longitudinally. Balloon perfusion catheters are inserted into the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries to deliver selective visceral perfusion from the left heart bypass circuit, and into the renal arteries to intermittently deliver cold crystalloid. Patent lower intercostal arteries are reattached to an opening in the graft. (F) The aortic clamp is repositioned to restore intercostal perfusion. The celiac axis, superior mesenteric, and right renal arteries are reattached to an opening in the side of the graft. (G) The aortic clamp is repositioned to restore visceral and right renal perfusion. The distal anastomosis is performed with continuous polypropylene suture at the level of the aortic bifurcation.

by inhibiting the clotting cascade, the use of heparin may help to reduce the incidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Heparin (1 mg/kg) is administered intravenously before aortic clamping or the start of left heart bypass (LHB). After this small heparin dose is administered, the activated clotting time generally ranges from 220 to 270 seconds.

#### **HYPOTHERMIA**

Hypothermia decreases the metabolic demand of tissues and is protective during ischemic states. The protective effects of hypothermia on the spinal cord are well accepted. We routinely use mild passive systemic hypothermia during DTAA and TAAA repairs. The patient's temperature is allowed to drift down to a nasopharyngeal temperature of 32 to 33°C. After the aortic repair, rewarming can be accomplished by irrigating the thoracic and abdominal cavities with warm saline.

Profound systemic hypothermia on full cardiopulmonary bypass is an operative strategy for organ protection. Kouchoukos and colleagues<sup>56-58</sup> have reported that hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass with circulatory arrest can safely and substantially protect against paralysis and renal, cardiac, and visceral organ system failure during operations on the thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta. Despite these protective effects, many clinicians avoid using this approach, principally because of the associated risks of coagulopathy, pulmonary dysfunction, and massive fluid shift. We use hypothermic circulatory arrest selectively when the aneurysm anatomy precludes safe proximal clamping.

#### LEFT HEART BYPASS

Disruption of blood flow to the spinal cord and abdominal viscera contributes significantly to the development of ischemic complications. Conversely, maintaining flow through spinal and visceral arteries during all or part of the anatomic repair should reduce the duration of organ ischemia and prevent associated morbidity. Borst et al<sup>59</sup> found that using LHB for distal perfusion during DTAA and TAAA repair effectively unloads the proximal circulation during aortic occlusion and maintains adequate perfusion of distal vital organs, thereby reducing early mortality and renal failure. Further, combined distal perfusion and aggressive reattachment of distal intercostal arteries decreased the risk of spinal cord damage.

Typically used during the proximal aortic anastomosis, LHB is achieved by establishing a temporary bypass from the left atrium to either the distal descending thoracic aorta (usually a few centimeters proximal to the origin of the celiac axis) or the femoral artery (most commonly the left), with a closed-circuit in-line centrifugal pump (Fig. 49-7C). The left atrial cannula is placed via an opening in the inferior pulmonary vein (Fig. 49-7C). When we first began using LHB, cannulation of the distal descending thoracic aorta (usually at the level of the diaphragm) was used solely as an alternative to femoral artery cannulation in patients with femoral or iliac artery occlusive disease. However, because this technique causes few complications and eliminates the

need for femoral artery exposure and repair, distal aortic cannulation has become our preferred approach. Careful examination of CT or MR images assists selection of an appropriate site for direct aortic cannulation. Areas with intraluminal thrombus (Fig. 49-4) are avoided because cannulation could lead to distal embolization. Bypass flows are adjusted to maintain normal proximal arterial and venous filling pressures. Flows between 1500 and 2500 mL/min are generally used. LHB facilitates rapid adjustment of proximal arterial pressure and cardiac preload, thereby reducing the need for pharmacologic intervention. Because LHB effectively unloads the left ventricle, it is useful in patients with suboptimal cardiac reserve.

#### SPINAL CORD PROTECTION

Paraplegia remains an index complication specific to both distal aortic surgery and endovascular repair. Historically, rates for spinal cord deficits (paraplegia or paraparesis) have been as high as 30% for extent II aortic replacements.54 Although the mechanism of developing paraplegia following spinal cord ischemia as part of open aortic repair is imperfectly understood, it is generally associated with interrupted distal aortic blood flow following proximal aortic clamping and the intraoperative loss of intercostal and lumbar arteries; additional factors include the role of the left subclavian and hypogastric arteries in perfusing the spinal cord (which tends to vary by patient), reperfusion injury, and the possible dissemination of embolic debris. 60,61 With modern operative techniques and spinal adjuncts, paraplegia rates in aortic centers are currently 1 to 5%. 44,56,62,63 Because multiple adjuncts are used in combination and are continuously evolving,64 it is difficult to attribute the improvements in outcome to one technique.

Cerebrospinal Fluid Drainage. The drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the context of aortic surgery for spinal cord protection was tested in animal models in the early 1960s.65 The rationale for CSF drainage was that it would enhance spinal perfusion by decreasing the pressure on the cord during aortic cross-clamping. Today, its use is widespread and specifically recommended by current US practice guidelines during both open and endovascular repairs in patients at high risk of developing paraplegia (Class I recommendation, level of evidence B).<sup>24</sup> In our study of 145 patients who underwent extent I or II TAAA repair, patients were randomly assigned to receive CSF drainage or no CSF drainage. Postoperatively, paraplegia or paraparesis developed in 9 patients (13%) in the control group but in only 2 patients (2.6%) in the CSF drainage group (p = .03).<sup>66</sup> Although the safety of CSF drainage has been shown clinically,<sup>67</sup> known risks include intracranial bleeding, perispinal hematoma, meningitis, and spinal headaches.<sup>68</sup>

We routinely use CSF drainage in patients undergoing Crawford extent I or II TAAA repairs because of the higher risks of paraplegia in these extensive TAAA repairs. We selectively use CSF drainage during less extensive repairs, such as DTAA or extent III or IV TAAA repairs, depending upon the individual risk factors involved; for example, we would use CSF drainage in a redo aortic operation in which the spinal collateral is compromised and a long cross-clamp time is anticipated because of the complex configuration of the aneurysm. The intrathecal catheter is placed through the second or third lumbar space preoperatively after induction of anesthesia and is maintained 1 to 2 days postoperatively in the intensive care unit. The catheter allows both monitoring of the CSF pressure and therapeutic drainage of the fluid. The CSF is allowed to drain passively from the catheter and can be aspirated with a closed collection system as needed to keep the CSF pressure between 8 and 10 mm Hg during the operation and between 10 and 12 mm Hg during the early postoperative period. Once the patients are awake and neurologic examinations confirm that they are able to move their legs, the CSF pressures are allowed to rise to a higher range of 15 to 18 mm Hg. To prevent intracranial hemorrhage, we avoid draining more than 25 mL per hour.

Left Heart Bypass for Spinal Protection. LHB appears to provide the greatest benefit to patients who undergo the more extensive repairs. Our own retrospective review of 1250 consecutive extent I or extent II TAAA repairs found that using LHB (in 666 cases) reduced the incidence of spinal cord deficits only in patients who underwent extent II repairs.<sup>69</sup> In patients who underwent extent I repairs, the incidence of paraplegia was similar in the LHB and no-LHB groups, even though the LHB group had significantly longer aortic clamp times. This finding suggests that, by providing spinal cord protection, LHB gives the surgeon more time to create secure anastomoses. A propensity-score analysis of 387 of our patients who underwent DTAA repair with (n = 46)or without (n = 341) LHB during the construction of the proximal anastomosis found no effect of LHB on postoperative paraplegia and paraparesis rates.<sup>70</sup> Because patients who undergo extensive TAAA repairs (extents I and II) are at greatest risk of postoperative paraplegia or paraparesis, we routinely use LHB to provide distal aortic perfusion during the proximal portion of the aortic repair.

Segmental Artery Reattachment and Sequential **Graft Clamping.** Because of the often tenuous nature of the blood supply to the spinal cord, we take an aggressive approach to reattaching patent segmental arteries. Intimal atherosclerosis, particularly in medial degenerative fusiform aneurysms, obliterates many intercostal and lumbar arteries and complicates matters anatomically. Pairs of patent segmental arteries from T8 to L1 are selectively reattached as patches to one or more openings made in the graft (Fig. 49-7E). Large arteries with little or no back-bleeding are considered particularly important. When none of these arteries is patent, endarterectomy of the aortic wall and removal of calcified intimal disease can be considered as a means of identifying arteries suitable for reattachment. Infrequently, a small-diameter graft may be used to facilitate bypass reattachment of selected arteries. After intercostal arteries are

reattached, the proximal clamp is often moved down the graft to restore intercostal perfusion. Sequential clamping restores perfusion to the proximal branch vessels and will decrease the ischemic time to the spinal cord. However, this benefit needs to be weighed against the additional time needed to control the potential bleeding from the proximal aortic anastomosis, the intercostal patch, and the collateral intercostal and lumbar branches that often results when the clamp is moved below the intercostal patch. In addition, the possibility of dislodging emboli that could lodge in branching arteries and create localized ischemia should be considered. The reattachment of intercostal arteries appears most significant in extent II TAAA repair; recently, we identified such reattachment independently predicted a 54% reduction in the risk of developing permanent paraplegia in such repairs.<sup>51</sup>

Spinal Cord Monitoring. Somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP), motor evoked potential (MEP), and nearinfrared spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring have been used for intraoperative assessment of spinal cord function. MEP monitoring involves electrical excitation of the motor cortex or motor neurons and measuring the amplitude of the resulting motor response in the peripheral muscles of the arms and legs. Monitoring MEPs allows real-time assessment of spinal cord motor function and was approved for this use during surgical TAAA repair by the FDA in 2003. Because the motor function of the anterior horn of the spinal cord is more susceptible than the posterior horn to ischemia and infarction, MEP changes are a sensitive indicator of spinal cord ischemia and are predictive of adverse neurological events. In contrast, SSEP monitoring is less sensitive because the sensory pathways on the dorsal horn are more resistant to injury and are sometimes spared when ischemic injury occurs. Irreversible loss of either MEPs or SSEPs is predictive of immediate neurologic deficit on recovery. 60 Less is known about the effectiveness of NIRS as applied to distal aortic repair, but it appears to have promising sensitivity and response time. 60,71 Importantly, monitoring MEPs precludes the use of neuromuscular paralytic agents during repair, adding complexity to anesthetic management. Although we have used MEP monitoring in the past for extent II and other selective TAAA repairs, we no longer use this approach in part because of the risk of false positive results; however, in expert hands, this remains a valuable approach.<sup>72</sup>

Regional Spinal Hypothermia. Regional spinal cord hypothermia can be accomplished by direct infusion of cold perfusate into the epidural or intrathecal space and by intravascular cold perfusion of isolated thoracic aortic segments (with the expectation that the intercostal vessels will deliver the cold perfusate to the spinal cord). A series of 337 TAAA repairs reported by Cambria and colleagues<sup>73</sup> showed that, in patients who underwent extent I, II, or III TAAA repairs, the incidence of spinal cord ischemic injury was reduced from 19.8 to 10.6% after the introduction of epidural cooling at their institution in 1993. Using an epidural catheter containing cold saline, Inoue et al<sup>74</sup> demonstrated its effectiveness in

reducing epidural temperature in a leporine model; in clinical application, it was used in 37 distal aortic repairs without any postoperative spinal cord deficits.<sup>75</sup> A similar technique, cold perfusion into isolated aortic segments, has been tested in animal models to show that cord temperature and, consequently, the extent of ischemic spinal cord injury can be effectively reduced by this method.<sup>76</sup>

Collateral Network Concepts. Collateral network concepts refute the existence of dominant intercostal and lumbar arteries (eg, the artery of Adamkiewicz) and imply that reattaching select intercostal arteries is largely unnecessary;<sup>77</sup> instead, the network of small arteries that perfuse the spinal cord may readily remodel following ischemic insult to provide sufficient perfusion of the spinal cord. 78 Efforts to further develop this approach have led to emerging endovascularspinal-cord preconditioning techniques by selectively coiling segmental arteries to promote remodeling and better tolerate subsequent open distal aortic repair.<sup>79</sup> Staged distal aortic repair is also being developed as a method to facilitate remodeling of the spinal cord between repairs, and porcine models showed this to be effective at preventing paraplegia after extensive aortic repair if the two stages were separated by 7 days.80 While staged repair may prove difficult in extensive open distal aortic repairs, this approach is not dissimilar from current approaches to extensive distal aortic dissection typically only the dilated section is repaired, and thus, often a DTAA or an extent I repair is followed by an extent III or IV repair.<sup>62</sup>

Rescue Measures for Spinal Cord Deficit. Postoperative management remains critical to spinal cord protection. Adequate blood pressure, preload, and cardiac inotropic state are carefully maintained to keep spinal perfusion sufficient. In the absence of postoperative bleeding, blood pressure should be kept near its preoperative baseline level. Delayed paraplegia can arise hours to days after aortic surgery. In the immediate postoperative period, strategies to reverse paraplegia and paraparesis include inducing systemic hypertension; placing a CSF drain, if one is not already present; decreasing CSF pressure; administering cardiac inotropes, mannitol, or steroids; correcting anemia; and preventing fever. Recovery from paraplegia is possible, but if cord function does not return promptly after these measures are taken, such a recovery is not likely.

#### RENAL PROTECTION

Postoperative renal failure after DTAA and TAAA remains an important complication and is predictive of mortality.<sup>82</sup> Although distal aortic perfusion with LHB provides renal perfusion during proximal anastomosis, the ability to provide continued renal protection is valuable. Our approach to renal protection for repair of TAAA has evolved from the results of two of our randomized clinical trials.<sup>83,84</sup> Once the renal vessels are exposed during distal repair, the renal arteries can be directly perfused with cold (4°C) perfusate (Fig. 49-7E). Our current technique is to provide an initial

bolus of 200 to 300 mL of cold crystalloid perfusate that is administered to each kidney, followed by the intermittent infusion of 100 to 150 mL per kidney, which is delivered every 10 to 15 minutes until arterial flow is restored. The volume and frequency of perfusate delivery are adjusted to avoid fluid overload or hypothermia (a systemic temperature of 32°C is targeted). First, we reported on a group of patients who underwent Crawford extent II TAAA repair with LHB and who were randomly assigned to receive either renal artery perfusion of cold LR solution for renal cooling or to isothermic blood perfusion from the LHB circuit. Multivariate analysis confirmed that cold crystalloid perfusion was independently protective against acute renal dysfunction.84 Second, we reported on a group of patients who underwent Crawford extent II or III TAAA repair and compared the outcomes of cold blood to cold crystalloid for renal protection. Although we found no significant difference between patients regarding renal failure or early death, a trend toward less paraplegia was observed in the cold crystalloid group.<sup>83</sup> Wynn and colleagues<sup>85</sup> were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of moderate systemic hypothermia and cold (4°C) renal perfusion using a similar approach in a retrospective review of 455 patients who underwent TAAA repair. Among aortic centers, there is considerable variation in perfusate; some centers have shifted from lactated Ringer's solution to histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solution.86 Current US aortic guidelines recommend the use of cold renal perfusion (class IIB, level of evidence B).<sup>24</sup> Other groups continue to selectively perfuse the renal arteries with blood from the LHB circuit.

#### VISCERAL PROTECTION

Similarly, distal aortic perfusion by LHB provides flow to the mesenteric branches during the initial portion of a TAAA repair. Once the visceral origins are exposed, selective visceral perfusion can be delivered through separate balloon perfusion catheters that are placed within the origins of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries; these catheters are attached to the LHB circuit via a Y-line from the arterial perfusion line (Fig. 49-7C). This system provides oxygenated blood to the abdominal viscera while the intercostal and visceral branches are being reattached to the graft (Figs. 49-7E-F). Reducing hepatic ischemia in this fashion may decrease the risk of postoperative coagulopathy, and reducing bowel ischemia may decrease the risk of bacterial translocation.

### **Operative Techniques**

#### INCISIONS AND AORTIC EXPOSURE

Aneurysms limited to the descending thoracic aorta are approached through a full posterolateral thoracotomy (Fig. 49-8A). In most cases, the left pleural space is entered through the sixth intercostal space; however, if the aneurysm predominantly involves the upper portion of the descending thoracic aorta, the fifth intercostal space provides better access to the distal aortic arch. Exposure of the distal descending

FIGURE 49-8 Drawings illustrating techniques for repairing a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm. (A) In the clamp-and-sew technique, the operation is performed through a posterolateral thoracotomy (inset). Clamps are placed on the aortic arch (between the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries) and the left subclavian artery (using a bulldog clamp). The aorta is opened longitudinally and divided circumferentially a few centimeters beyond the proximal clamp. (B) After the proximal anastomosis is completed, the aortic clamp is repositioned onto the graft, flow is restored to the left subclavian artery, and the remainder of the aneurysm is opened longitudinally. An open distal anastomosis completes the repair. (C) As an alternative to the clampand-sew technique, left heart bypass can be used to provide distal aortic perfusion during the repair.

thoracic aorta is enhanced by dividing the costal margin without dividing the diaphragm.

The full thoracoabdominal incision extends from the left posterior chest (between the scapula and the spine), crosses the costal margin, and traverses obliquely to the umbilicus. The length and level varies according to the anatomy of the aneurysm. The incision is gently curved as it crosses the costal margin to reduce the risk of tissue necrosis at the apex of the lower portion of the musculoskeletal tissue flap (Fig. 49-9A). Stabilized on a bean bag, the patient is placed in a modified right lateral decubitus position with the shoulders placed at 60° to 80° and the hips rotated to 30° to 40° from

horizontal. In extent I and II repairs, which require access to the left subclavian artery and distal arch in the upper chest, our standard approach is through the sixth intercostal space. Rarely, the upper or lower ribs may be divided posteriorly to achieve additional proximal or distal exposure, respectively. For extent III aneurysm repairs, entering through the seventh or eighth intercostal space will allow adequate access. Extent IV aneurysms are approached via a straight oblique incision through the ninth or tenth interspace (Fig. 49-9B). Ending the incision distally at the level of the umbilicus will allow access to the aortic bifurcation. The incision can be extended toward the pubis if iliac aneurysms also require repair.

![](_page_15_Picture_2.jpeg)

![](_page_15_Picture_3.jpeg)

**FIGURE 49-9** Drawings of the typical incisions used in thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repairs. (A) A curvilinear incision is used to approach the aorta in extents I, II, and III thoracoabdominal aneurysm repairs. (B) A straighter, oblique incision is used to approach extent IV thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repairs.

For thoracoabdominal access, the diaphragm is divided partially or completely in a circular fashion to protect the phrenic nerve and to preserve as much diaphragm as possible. The crus of the diaphragm is divided at the hiatus, and a 3- to 4-cm rim of diaphragmatic tissue is left posterolaterally on the chest wall to facilitate closure when the operation is complete. Below the diaphragm, the retroperitoneum is entered lateral to the left colon, and medial visceral rotation is performed to expose the aorta. A dissection plane is developed anterior to the psoas muscle, and the left kidney, left colon,

spleen, and left ureter are retracted anteriorly and to the right. The abdominal aortic segment is approached transperitoneally; opening the peritoneum permits direct inspection of the abdominal viscera and its blood supply after aortic reconstruction is completed. An entirely retroperitoneal approach can be used in patients with a "hostile abdomen," that is, patients with multiple prior abdominal operations or a history of extensive adhesions, peritonitis, or both.

The left renal artery is identified but generally does not require mobilization. The aorta is approached laterally to avoid injury to the mesenteric vessels and the abdominal organs. Commonly, a large lumbar branch of the left renal vein courses posteriorly around the aorta. This branch may be ligated and divided as needed. An anomalous retroaortic left renal vein is occasionally encountered and should be preserved. If the retroaortic renal vein or its tributaries require division for exposure, direct reanastomosis or interposition grafting to the inferior vena cava can be performed if the left kidney appears congested and shows distended collaterals.

#### PROXIMAL ANASTOMOSIS

For DTAA and extent I and II TAAA repairs, options for establishing proximal control include applying a proximal aortic clamp distal to the left subclavian artery; applying an aortic clamp between the left subclavian and the left carotid artery and applying a separate bulldog clamp to the left subclavian artery; applying an aortic clamp to an existing graft during an elephant trunk operation; or open anastomosis under hypothermic circulatory arrest with full cardiopulmonary bypass when an aortic clamp cannot be safely applied. The decision is based on the anatomy of the aneurysm. We use aortic clamping distal to the left subclavian artery whenever possible, although others have advocated using circulatory arrest routinely. 56

In aneurysms suitable for aortic clamping, the distal aortic arch is gently mobilized by dividing the remnant of the ductus arteriosus. The vagus and recurrent laryngeal nerves are identified. The vagus nerve may be divided below the recurrent nerve to provide additional mobility, thereby protecting the recurrent nerve from injury. Preserving the recurrent laryngeal nerve is particularly important in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and reduced pulmonary function. If the aneurysm encroaches upon the left subclavian artery, clamping proximal to the left subclavian artery should be anticipated; the left subclavian artery is then circumferentially mobilized to enable placement of a bulldog clamp.

After heparin is administered, the proximal clamp is applied to the proximal descending thoracic aorta or the distal transverse aortic arch between the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries (Figs. 49-7B and 49-8A). When LHB is used, it is initiated at a flow rate of 500 mL/min just before the proximal aorta is clamped. After the proximal clamp is applied, LHB flow is increased to 2 L/min and a second distal aortic clamp is placed between T4 and T7 (Fig. 49-7C). After the aorta is opened, patent upper

intercostal arteries are oversewn (Fig. 49-8C). In cases of chronic dissection, the septum between the true and false lumens is completely removed. The aorta is transected 2 to 3 cm beyond the proximal clamp and is separated from the esophagus to allow the surgeon to place full-thickness sutures in the aortic wall without injuring the esophagus. A 22- or 24-mm, gelatin-impregnated woven Dacron graft is used in most patients. The proximal anastomosis is performed with continuous polypropylene suture (Fig. 49-7D). Most anastomoses are made with 3-0 polypropylene suture; however, in patients with particularly fragile aortic tissues, such as patients with acute aortic dissection or Marfan syndrome, 4-0 polypropylene sutures are commonly used. Felt strips are generally not used; instead, intermittent polypropylene mattress sutures with felt pledgets are used to reinforce selected portions of the anastomoses. The use of surgical adhesives is avoided in these operations.

Open Anastomosis Under Hypothermic Circulatory Arrest. In repairs of large aneurysms at the distal arch or aneurysms with enormous size, contained rupture, or in redo operations in which safe dissection and clamping are not possible, an alternative strategy is total cardiopulmonary bypass with hypothermic circulatory arrest. Arterial inflow is established by placing a cannula in the distal aorta or the femoral artery, depending on patient-specific factors. Venous drainage is usually established by inserting a long, multiholed cannula into the left femoral vein and advancing it into the right atrium with transesophageal echocardiographic guidance. The left atrium or left ventricle can be vented via a rightangled sump cannula placed in the left pulmonary vein to prevent cardiac distension. Total cardiopulmonary bypass is initiated, and the patient is cooled to electrocerebral silence. Circulatory arrest is initiated, and the aneurysm is opened. Direct antegrade cerebral perfusion into the left carotid artery can be accomplished via a separate balloon catheter arising from the arterial limb of the circuit. An open proximal anastomosis is performed. After this anastomosis is completed, a Y-limb from the arterial line is connected to a side branch of the graft. The graft is deaired and clamped, pump flow to the upper body is resumed, and the remainder of the aortic repair is performed.

Elephant Trunk Repairs. A staged operative procedure is preferred in patients who present with extensive aneurysmal disease involving the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending thoracic or thoracoabdominal aorta (Fig. 49-10A). When the DTAA or TAAA is not causing symptoms and is not substantially larger than the ascending aorta, the proximal aortic repair is performed first. This allows treatment of valvular and coronary artery occlusive disease during the first operation.

Our current preference for reconstruction of the innominate, left carotid, and left subclavian artery is separate end-to-end anastomoses with a branched trifurcated graft (Fig. 49-10B). The bypass to the left subclavian artery during the first stage is not critical, and the left subclavian artery origin

can remain intact on the native aorta. The aorta itself can be replaced with a skirted elephant trunk graft, which facilitates the distal aortic anastomosis to aneurysmal tissue, because the skirt accommodates any size discrepancy between the graft and native aorta. The proximal aortic anastomosis is placed to the supravalvar ascending aorta, and the distal skirt anastomosis can be placed fairly anteriorly on the aortic arch at the level of the innominate artery, facilitating hemostasis. The proximal end of the trifurcated graft is then anastomosed to an opening in the mid-ascending aspect of the aortic graft. The distal aortic anastomosis later becomes unimportant when the elephant trunk anastomosis to the descending aorta is completed at the second stage (Fig. 49-10D). The presence of the elephant trunk graft within the descending aorta allows secure clamping of even very large aneurysms distal to the left subclavian artery. If the left subclavian artery was not bypassed during the arch vessel reconstruction, a side branch from the descending aorta can be anastomosed to the subclavian artery from the left chest during the second stage. During the second stage repair, an ultrasound probe may be used to identify the distal end of the elephant trunk before incision.

Reversed Elephant Trunk Repairs. Conversely, in patients with similarly extensive aneurysmal disease who present with a DTAA or TAAA that has ruptured, causes symptoms (eg, back pain), or is considerably larger than the ascending aorta (Fig. 49-11A), the DTAA or TAAA is treated during the initial operation, and the ascending aorta and transverse aortic arch are repaired in a second procedure. During this "reversed" elephant trunk repair (Fig. 49-11B), a portion of the proximal end of the aortic graft is inverted down into the lumen during the first operation and is later used to facilitate second-stage repair of the ascending and transverse aortic arch.<sup>87</sup>

## INTERCOSTAL PATCH ANASTOMOSIS AND COMPLETION OF THE DTAA REPAIR

After the proximal anastomosis is completed, LHB is discontinued and the distal aortic clamp is removed. The remainder of the aneurysm is opened longitudinally to its distal extent (Fig. 49-7E). The blood in the open aorta is scavenged via cell saver and returned as whole blood by a rapid infuser system. When intraluminal thrombus is present, it is evacuated by hand. If the aneurysm was clamped proximal to the left subclavian artery, the aortic clamp is moved down onto the graft and the left subclavian artery clamp is removed; this restores blood flow to the left vertebral artery and to spinal collaterals. For repairs that extend to the diaphragm or beyond, patent lower intercostal arteries are selected and reattached to an opening cut in the side of the graft. If the aortic tissue is particularly friable, a separate, 8-mm graft can be attached in an end-to-end fashion to the selected intercostal vessels. In DTAA repairs, the distal anastomosis is then performed (Fig. 49-8B) as an open distal anastomosis. For aneurysms arising from chronic dissections, the membrane between the true and false lumen is fenestrated distally to ensure that both lumens are perfused.

#### VISCERAL BRANCH VESSEL ANASTOMOSES

In patients with TAAAs, after the descending thoracic aortic repair is completed, the remainder of the aneurysm is opened longitudinally (Fig. 49-7E). This incision runs posterior to the origin of the left renal artery and continues to the distal extent of the aneurysm. When present, the remaining dissecting membrane is excised. The origins of the visceral and renal branches are identified. Cold

perfusate is intermittently delivered to the renal arteries via balloon catheters. In patients receiving LHB, balloon cannulas are also placed in the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries so that selective visceral perfusion can be delivered from the pump circuit. Subsequently, the celiac, superior mesenteric, and renal arteries are reattached. In extent I repairs, the reattachment of the visceral arteries is often incorporated into a beveled distal anastomosis

(E) During the second stage, the elephant trunk is retrieved through the open aortic arch and (F) used to replace the arch and ascending aorta, (G) which completes the repair.

(Fig. 49-11C), but in extent II and III repairs, the visceral artery origins are reattached to one or more oval openings in the graft (Fig. 49-7F). Commonly, the origin of the left renal artery is displaced laterally and is best attached to a separate opening in the graft (Fig. 49-7H). Patients with genetic disorders such as Marfan or Loeys-Dietz syndrome are prone to aneurysms involving their visceral reattachment patch; a multibranched graft enables separate bypasses to each of the vessels, thereby minimizing the amount of remaining aortic tissue and reducing the risk of recurrent aneurysms. Multibranched grafts are also useful in patients with large aneurysms that have caused wide displacement of the celiac, superior mesenteric, and renal arterial ostia (Fig. 49-12). Visceral artery stenosis is typically encountered in at least 25% of cases and necessitates endarterectomy (if anatomically suitable), stenting, or interposition bypass grafting.<sup>54,88</sup>

#### DISTAL AORTIC AND ILIAC ANASTOMOSES

When the TAAA extends below the renal arteries, a distal anastomosis is performed near the aortic bifurcation (Fig. 49-7H). In patients with iliac artery aneurysms, a bifurcation graft is sewn onto the end of the straight graft; the graft's limbs are then anastomosed to the common iliac, external iliac, or common femoral artery, depending on the extent of disease. The right limb of the bifurcation graft is tunneled retroperitoneally into the pelvis near the right iliac artery. Exposure of the left iliac artery is more straightforward from the left retroperitoneal incision. As needed for stenosis or extensive calcification, endarterectomy may be performed or stents may be used under direct vision to repair one or both iliac arteries.

After all clamps are removed, heparin is reversed with protamine sulfate. Hemostasis is achieved by surgically

reinforcing the anastomoses and administering blood products as necessary. The renal, visceral, and peripheral circulations are assessed. To ensure that renal function is adequate, blue dye is administered intravenously, and transit time to urine output is measured. The bowel, spleen, and liver are all assessed for adequacy of perfusion. The spleen is examined for capsular injury; if a splenic hematoma is present, the spleen is removed to avoid postoperative bleeding and hypotension. The aneurysm wall is then loosely wrapped around the aortic graft. Two posteriorly located thoracic drainage tubes and a closed-suction retroperitoneal drain are placed before closure. The diaphragm is closed with continuous polypropylene suture; postoperative disruption of the diaphragmatic repair is exceedingly rare.

#### **EARLY POSTOPERATIVE CARE**

Postoperative blood pressure management is critical and must be balanced between hypertension (which can cause bleeding) and hypotension (which can lead to paraplegia/paraparesis). Because aortic anastomoses are often extremely fragile during the early postoperative period, even brief episodes of hypertension may disrupt suture lines and cause severe bleeding or pseudoaneurysm formation. In most cases, we use nitroprusside, intravenous  $\beta$ -antagonists, and intravenous calcium-channel blockers to keep the mean arterial blood pressure between 80 and 90 mm Hg. In patients with severely friable aortic tissue, such as those with Marfan syndrome, we use a target range of 70 to 80 mm Hg.

#### **OUTCOMES**

Since 1986, we have performed open surgical repair of 4040 DTAAs and TAAAs. Combined hospital and 30-day operative mortality was 7.1% (n = 286). Complications that are commonly associated with an increased risk of death include paraplegia, renal failure, respiratory failure, cardiac events, and bleeding. The incidence of paraplegia and paraparesis in our series was 4.8% (n = 195), paraplegia alone was 2.7% (n = 111), and the incidence of renal failure necessitating

hemodialysis was 5.7% (n = 231). The rate of return to the operating room for bleeding has been 3.5% in our experience (n = 142). Our most recent data (from 2009 to 2015), which reflect the results of our current organ-protection strategies, are shown in Table 49-2; for the majority of postoperative complications, operative risk varies by the extent of repair.

Pulmonary complications following distal aortic repair are quite common, affecting more than a third of patients and tending to occur more frequently after extensive repair (extents I and III TAAA repair) than less extensive repair (extent IV TAAA repair). Of note, vocal cord paralysis can contribute to respiratory complications; it should be suspected in patients with postoperative hoarseness and confirmed by direct examination. This complication can be treated effectively by direct cord medialization (ie, type 1 thyroplasty) or by polytetrafluoroethylene injection. In general, younger patients (≤50 years) tend to have far fewer postoperative complications than older patients; however, extensive TAAA repair (extent II TAAA) in the elderly (>80 years) should be cautioned as patients do quite poorly.<sup>89</sup>

# SURVEILLANCE FOR ADDITIONAL AORTIC DISEASE

Patients who have undergone DTAA or TAAA repair remain at risk for developing new aneurysms in other aortic segments or in reattachment patches; this is especially true for patients with residual distal aortic dissection. Progressive weakening of aortic tissue at suture lines can lead to pseudoaneurysm formation—this late risk tends to be more pronounced in patients with uncontrolled hypertension or connective tissue disorder. If concerning symptoms develop (such as any ischemic complications or sudden onset of pain), patients should be made aware that they should seek urgent treatment. To detect new aortic disease before life-threatening complications occur, we recommend that all patients undergo annual CT or MR imaging of the chest and abdomen. This strategy of lifelong surveillance is especially important in patients with genetic disorders.8 Subsequent aortic repairs can be performed with surprisingly low mortality and morbidity risk, particularly when done electively.90
