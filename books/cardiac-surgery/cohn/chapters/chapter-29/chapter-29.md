# Stentless Aortic Valve and Root Replacement

Paul Stelzer • Robin Varghese

Replacement of the aortic valve or the full aortic root can be performed using a variety of stentless valve devices. The three main options are a porcine aortic root-valve conduit (Medtronic Freestyle, Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN), and the "human" valve options of the aortic homograft and the pulmonary autograft (Ross Procedure). Having reviewed the subject almost 30 years ago, 1 it is interesting to note how some things have changed but much has remained the same. Table 29-1 summarizes advantages and disadvantages of current replacement options.

#### HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE

The first choice for aortic valve replacement (AVR) was the homograft aortic valve. Gordon Murray created an animal model to implant an aortic homograft valve in the descending aorta<sup>2</sup> and was the first to apply the concept in the human demonstrating function for up to 4 years.<sup>3</sup>

Duran and Gunning at Oxford described a method for orthotopic (subcoronary) implantation of an aortic homograft valve in 1962<sup>4</sup> and in 1962 both Donald Ross in London,<sup>5</sup> and Sir Brian Barratt-Boyes in Auckland,<sup>6</sup> did this successfully in humans.

Initially, homograft aortic valves were implanted shortly after collection.<sup>7</sup> This impractical method was rapidly supplanted by techniques to sterilize and preserve the valve for later use. Early methods employed beta-propiolactone<sup>6,8</sup> or 0.02% chlorhexidine,<sup>9</sup> followed by ethylene oxide or radiation exposure.<sup>10</sup> Some were preserved by freeze-drying.<sup>6,10</sup> Recognizing that the incidence of valve rupture was high in chemically treated valves, Barratt-Boyes introduced antibiotic sterilization of homografts in 1968.<sup>11</sup> Cryopreservation of allografts was introduced in 1975 by O'Brien and continues to be the predominant method.<sup>12,13</sup> Experimental use of autologous valve transplantation began in 1961 when Lower and colleagues at Stanford transposed the autologous pulmonic valve to the mitral position in dogs<sup>14</sup> and shortly thereafter to the aortic position.<sup>13</sup> Donald Ross applied this

to humans, reporting in 1967 clinical experience replacing either the aortic or the mitral valve with a pulmonary autograft. <sup>14</sup> Nearly 20 years later the autograft was finally done in America by Elkins and Stelzer. <sup>15</sup> The operation came to be known as the Ross procedure. After an initial surge of interest in the 1990s (over 240 surgeons worldwide reported their experience to the Ross Procedure International Registry <sup>16</sup>), its use diminished in the next decade.

The porcine aortic root (Medtronic Freestyle aortic root bioprosthesis (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN)) is readily available preserved in glutaraldehyde (Fig. 29-1). Its "off the shelf" availability in a wide range of sizes make it a more flexible option compared to the homograft which is limited in both number and size by the tissue donor pool and what is available in the tissue bank. The Freestyle porcine root employed third-generation tissue technology with zeropressure fixation and treatment with alpha amino oleic acid (AOA) which aims to decrease both leaflet and aortic wall calcification. This device first began with clinical investigation in 1992. It employed zero-pressure glutaraldehyde fixation and AOA treatment to enhance durability as a third-generation tissue valve. It was approved for clinical use in 1998. The conduit is a complete porcine aortic root with a 3-mm rim of polyester fabric along the proximal end providing additional strength for suturing.

#### **HOMOGRAFTS**

# Cellular and Immunologic Aspects of Homografts

The normal living valve contains multiple viable cell types including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells incorporated in a complex extracellular matrix. The cells and matrix elements are in a constant state of remodeling under the influence of regulatory systems that optimize the structure and function of the valve mechanism. It is understandable, therefore, that efforts to preserve homograft

structure and function were translated into efforts to maintain homograft cellular viability. Radiation and chemical treatment led to very early failure and were quickly abandoned.<sup>6,8,10,11,17</sup> Antibiotic sterilization of homografts and storage at 4°C does not maintain cellular viability beyond a few days. 18,19 Cryopreservation became the gold standard when donor fibroblast viability was shown long after implantation. 12 Although antigenicity of the fibroblast is low and other cell types do not survive the freezing process, panel reactive antibody and donor-specific HLA I and II antibody testing is positive in 60 to 80% of homograft recipients. 20-22 The potential advantages of viability may be defeated by the detrimental effects of this immune system response. Animal studies have confirmed an immune mechanism by demonstrating that deterioration in homograft valve function is prevented by immunosuppression<sup>23</sup> and does not occur in T-cell-deficient rats.<sup>24</sup> Clinical use of immunosuppression, however, could not be justified for homograft patients.

Tissue engineering concepts led to decellularization which lyses cells and "rinses" out antigenic proteins leaving an inert

matrix and intact structural framework. Preserved mechanical properties and structural integrity were demonstrated in a sheep model of such a scaffold. In addition, the empty matrix seemed to attract circulating recipient stem cells which repopulated the framework and differentiated into appropriate cell lines capable of maintaining the matrix.<sup>25</sup> Initial use of the decellularized aortic homograft in humans demonstrated that structural integrity could be maintained with low, stable gradients and minimal regurgitation similar to standard cryopreserved homografts.<sup>26</sup> The same concept has been applied to the pulmonary homograft used in the Ross operation. 27,28 The decellularized aortic homograft has been largely abandoned because of early failure rates but the decellularized pulmonary homograft has been at least as good or better than the standard pulmonary homograft when used on the right side of the heart.<sup>29</sup> Long-term studies are needed to determine if native cell in growth occurs reliably. A decellularized xenograft valved conduit has also been used successfully for the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) reconstruction with the Ross but results were poor.<sup>30</sup>

In summary, despite intensive investigation over decades, the relative contribution of the immune response, preservation techniques, and warm ischemia time to ultimate valve degeneration is not clear. More importantly, after consideration of the structural benefits and the immune-reaction risks, the net advantage of maintaining cellular (particularly fibroblast) viability in the homograft is not well defined.<sup>31</sup>

# Indications for the Porcine Xenograft (Freestyle) and Aortic Homograft

AVR with a stentless valved conduit such as the porcine root or aortic homograft has a number of advantages including excellent hemodynamic profile with low transvalvular gradients and possibly enhanced regression of left ventricular mass,<sup>32</sup> low risk of thromboembolism without the need for systemic anticoagulation, and low risk of prosthetic valve infection. However, these conduits are subject to structural

deterioration that is inversely proportional to recipient age. Older homograft donor age may also increase rates of degeneration. Furthermore, the availability of homografts is still limited especially in the larger sizes. The strongest indication for a homograft is for treatment of active aortic valve endocarditis particularly in patients with root abscess, fistula formation, or prosthetic valve infection.<sup>33</sup> This is the only Class I indication for a homograft in the most recent guidelines.<sup>34</sup>

The porcine root is also an option in aortic valve endocarditis with root destruction requiring a root replacement with the advantage that it possesses minimal prosthetic material compared with a polyester valved-conduit graft. The pliable handling characteristics and ease of coronary reimplantation make both the homograft and porcine root a great option in root infections. The homograft is further well suited to this challenging task as it comes with the added benefits of having the attached donor mitral anterior leaflet, and the ability to reconstruct the debrided root with all biological material to minimize risk of persistent infection. The homograft's very low early hazard rate for endocarditis sets it apart from other valve alternatives.<sup>35</sup>

The stentless porcine root and aortic homograft are also a reasonable option in the older patient (>60 years of age) with a small aortic root. The hemodynamic advantages of the homograft translate into better relief of outflow obstruction and improved exercise tolerance. The root replacement option also eliminates the risk of coronary obstruction from

an oversized aortic prosthesis. Given its resistance to thromboembolic complications the aortic homograft can also be considered for younger patients requiring composite aortic valve or root replacement who cannot be anticoagulated. However, recent data from a prospective randomized trial would argue that most of the advantages of the homograft can be duplicated by the stentless porcine root replacement which has a significantly lower reported rate of calcification and valve dysfunction.<sup>36</sup>

# **Preoperative Evaluation**

Preoperative transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is an invaluable diagnostic tool for evaluation of the AV and associated anatomic structures. Echo measurement of the left ventricular outflow tract can accurately predict aortic annulus diameter and thus the size of the porcine root/homograft required.<sup>37-39</sup>

Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) or cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging can also be very useful in the evaluation of potential homograft patients particularly those with aortic root abscess (see Fig. 29-2). Coronary angiography should be employed with the standard indications but may be hazardous in patients with mobile vegetations on the aortic leaflets. Standard chest computed tomography with and without contrast should be considered in any reoperative setting to assess location of bypass grafts, proximity of vital structures to the sternum, and extent of ascending aortic or

arch calcification or aneurysm. Heavy calcification around the coronary ostia may preclude safe reimplantation of coronary "buttons" or even a distal subcoronary suture line.

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is often necessary to establish the presence of a root abscess, but its major role is for intraoperative confirmation of the anatomy and assessment of both valve and ventricular function.

#### **OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE**

# **General Preparation**

Routine cardiac surgical monitoring including TEE is considered standard of care. An antifibrinolytic agent such as epsilon-aminocaproic acid is helpful. A standard midline sternotomy incision provides full exposure of the heart, ease in cannulation, and access for optimal myocardial protection. Routine distal aortic cannulation and a dual stage venous cannula can usually be employed.

Unless circulatory arrest is needed, minimal systemic cooling (32°C) is adequate if the heart is maintained at 10 to 15°C using a standard insulating pad and directly monitoring the myocardial septal temperature. A combination of antegrade and retrograde cold blood cardioplegia can be used with the bulk of the protection coming from the retrograde. The open aortic root reveals coronary return from both ostia to confirm effective retrograde.

A transverse aortotomy high (1.5–2 cm) above the commissures is usually best. The diseased aortic valve is excised and the annulus is measured with cylindrical sizers. The sinotubular junction should also be evaluated for the subcoronary technique. If using the porcine root, its size can then be confirmed and the prosthesis opened and rinsed.

If using the homograft, sufficient time (20 minutes) is required to thaw the prosthesis and so a decision to use the homograft with a specific size is required prior to exposing the root and sizing it directly. Hence the measurement of the aortic annulus on TEE is essential after induction of anesthesia allowing the time to ensure that the appropriate sized conduit is available onsite.

The homograft is trimmed appropriately. In general, 3 to 4 mm of tissue proximal to the nadir of each cusp is advised for security in suture placement leaving even more for full root replacements.

# Techniques of Porcine Root/Homograft Placement

#### SUBCORONARY IMPLANT TECHNIQUE

The subcoronary method involves two suture lines within the native root. The prosthesis is usually oriented anatomically to properly align the commissures and the coronaries. The proximal end of the prosthesis is sewn to the native annulus in a circular plane at the level of the nadir of each sinus curving upward slightly in the membranous septum to avoid injury to the conduction system. This anastomosis can be done with either interrupted or continuous sutures (see Figs. 29-3 and 29-4).

![](_page_3_Picture_14.jpeg)

**FIGURE 29-3** Subcoronary Freestyle implantation. The Freestyle is oriented anatomically and the proximal end attached in a circular plane at the level of the nadir of the recipient sinuses using either interrupted or continuous sutures. The same technique can be employed for the subcoronary homograft valve implantation.

![](_page_3_Picture_16.jpeg)

**FIGURE 29-4** Distal Freestyle/homograft suture line. (A) The subcoronary implant is completed by tacking the aortic wall of the Freestyle/homograft to the recipient aortic wall with continuous fine polypropylene suture after trimming out the tissue in the coronary sinuses to allow blood flow to the native coronaries. The noncoronary sinus is usually left intact. (B) The aortotomy is closed in standard fashion incorporating the top of the Freestyle/homograft in the process.

The top of each commissure is tacked to the aortic wall. The right and left sinus walls are then scalloped out to a point 3 to 5 mm from the leaflets. The noncoronary sinus can also be removed but is usually left intact. A 4-0 or 5-0 polypropylene suture is started at the lowest point under each coronary ostium and a continuous suture line constructed from there up to the top of the commissure on either side. On the top of the noncoronary sinus, excess prosthetic tissue is trimmed down and tacked to the top of the aortotomy. The aortotomy is then closed with continuous 4-0 polypropylene suture incorporating the top of the prosthesis noncoronary sinus with the native aortic wall. The ascending aorta is vented as the aortic clamp is removed. TEE can quickly assess any regurgitation at this point. Distension of the ventricle should be avoided by prompt defibrillation (if necessary) and pacing if required.

Because even slight malalignment of the commissures can result in regurgitation, the subcoronary implant technique is considered more demanding than the other techniques and may have poorer long-term results. 40-44 The subcoronary technique is good for patients with small, symmetric aortic roots and sinotubular junctions, while it is a poor choice for those with dilated, asymmetric, or severely diseased roots.

# Porcine Root/Homograft Cylinder: Inclusion Root Technique

The cylinder modification of the subcoronary technique was developed in an attempt to preserve the native geometry of the prosthesis inside the recipient aortic root. The proximal suture line is identical to the subcoronary method but the sinuses are not scalloped out. Instead, a buttonhole is made in the right and left sinuses in such a way as to allow the porcine root/homograft wall to be sewn to the native sinus wall around the coronary ostia. After the coronaries are secure, the distal end of the prosthesis is attached at the commissures and then incorporated circumferentially into the aortotomy closure.

Sievers and colleagues<sup>45</sup> and Skillington<sup>46</sup> have carefully described technical aspects of these operations that have proven very effective in their hands and should be reviewed by surgeons interested in using this method.

# Porcine Root/Homograft Root Replacement

The root replacement technique can be used in any root and is particularly useful in small roots or in roots destroyed by endocarditis. The root replacement allows size flexibility that allows thawing an appropriate homograft without wasting clamp time. Very large roots may require commissural plication as described by Northrup.<sup>47</sup>

The aorta is opened transversely well above the commissures of the valve. The diseased valve is excised and annulus debrided. The aorta is transected and the coronary ostial

buttons are mobilized in standard fashion. If antegrade cardioplegia is used after this point it must be done very carefully to avoid injury to the mobilized ostia.

The homograft root is usually oriented anatomically while the porcine root is commonly oriented with the left coronary os matching that of the patient's right coronary—making matching the two roots easiest. (Porcine coronaries are closer together than human.) The proximal suture line can be constructed with either continuous or interrupted technique. Interrupted is best in difficult reoperations especially for prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) because it allows for very accurate, deep placement of individual stitches while distributing tension across multiple sutures. A strip of autologous (or bovine) pericardium is used to reinforce this crucial anastomosis. Polypropylene sutures of 3-0 or 4-0 are used and organization scrupulously maintained on suture guides. The homograft parachutes down as the sutures are carefully tightened (Fig. 29-5).

The Freestyle root is most often sutured with a continuous suture technique with 4-0 polypropylene begun at the rightleft commissure and sewing towards oneself through the left sinus, then the noncoronary and finally the right sinus to end at the noncoronary-right commissure. The fibrous trigones and commissures of the native and homograft/Freestyle roots serve as anatomical landmarks and should match up as one proceeds around. It is recommended that the valve be sewn with the sutures kept loose during the left and noncoronary sinus suturing and the conduit parachuted down progressively. Keeping the suture line loose is essential to completing the right sinus suture line. Once all the sutures have been placed, the initially loose suture line is tightened carefully with nerve hooks and tied securely into position. Gentle tissue handling with bites 1.5 to 2 mm apart incorporating a strip of pericardium or Teflon felt is helpful in securing hemostasis at this crucial level that is virtually invisible at the end.

The coronary buttons are attached with continuous 5-0 or 6-0 polypropylene. The coronary stumps of the homograft often times are well aligned to mark locations for the new coronary ostia. For the porcine root usually the left ostium of the porcine root will line up with the left button and then one has to determine if the right ostium lines up appropriately or whether it needs to be suture ligated and another hole made for the right button. Rotating the device 120° clockwise puts the porcine left in the patient's right if that looks better. Once the buttons are completed attention can be turned to the distal anastomosis. The distal end of the conduit and the native aorta are trimmed and sewn together with continuous 4-0 polypropylene usually incorporating another strip of pericardium or felt for support. The native aorta is vented anteriorly and systemic flow rate lowered as the cross clamp is removed.

Care is taken to avoid systemic hypertension or vigorous traction on the reconstructed root to avoid bleeding. Topical hemostatic agents and biological glues may be used, but they should not be routinely necessary. Blood and blood products are not routinely required unless the

patient is coagulopathic or small in size with a low total blood volume.

### Post Replacement Assessment

Ventricular function, regional wall motion abnormalities, and valve function may all be accurately determined with TEE. With appropriate loading conditions, moderate-to-severe aortic regurgitation (AR) warrants inspection and revision of the valve conduit. Mild AR is usually tolerated well and does not warrant reexploration.

### Postoperative Management

Even mild hypertension should be avoided to prevent disruption of crucial aortic suture lines. Coagulopathic bleeding is best addressed with products targeted to specific abnormalities defined by laboratory studies.

Adequate volume replacement is required to keep the stiff ventricle of aortic stenosis (AS) filled and alpha adrenergic support is often required for the patient who is vasodilated. Atrial rhythm disturbances should be treated aggressively. Elderly patients, particularly females, with AS and diastolic dysfunction are at increased risk of morbidity and even mortality from postoperative atrial fibrillation. The increased volume loading needed to overcome the loss of atrial transport often leads to pulmonary congestion sometimes requiring reintubation and prolonged support. Forward cardiac output is impaired and renal function may deteriorate in tenuous patients. Cardioversion should be considered early in these patients and loading with intravenous amiodarone is usually indicated. Preoperative loading with amiodarone may minimize the incidence and consequences of this arrhythmia.<sup>48</sup>

Temporary pacing, preferably atrial as well as ventricular, should be enabled. Permanent pacing is indicated if epicardial wires become unreliable, heart block was present preoperatively, or the underlying rhythm fails to return within a week after surgery.

Stroke risk can be minimized by careful intraoperative epiaortic ultrasound to guide or avoid cannulation and clamping of atheromatous aortic disease. TEE-guided evacuation of air is essential and flooding the field with carbon dioxide may be helpful.

Myocardial dysfunction is best prevented by careful temperature-monitored myocardial protection but long operations may still require temporary inotropic support. Caution must be used in the hyperdynamic ventricle with diastolic dysfunction. The combination of a hyperdynamic left ventricle and a dysfunctional right heart is very challenging. These patients may benefit from atrial pacing (if pacing is required), phosphodiesterase inhibitors, adequate volume replacement, and alpha agonists.

Renal insufficiency is a risk minimized by maintenance of adequate flows and pressure during bypass and generous volume administration in the early postoperative period. A thirsty patient with dry mucous membranes is a good clue that intravascular volume is still depleted. Later, diuretics are

needed to encourage mobilization and excretion of this extra fluid. Hypotension should be avoided but vasopressors can have direct negative effects on renal blood flow.

Low-dose aspirin is often recommended for homograft patients, but is not necessary and formal anticoagulation with warfarin is not required at all unless dictated by other conditions. A routine predischarge echo should be done to confirm valve function, ventricular function and freedom from pericardial effusion.

# Homograft Root Results

#### PERIOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS

In patients without active endocarditis at the time of surgery, operative mortality in the current era is 1 to 5%.<sup>42,49,50</sup> The risk in experienced hands is comparable to using a stented bioprosthetic or mechanical valve. Ischemic time for a root replacement with either stentless porcine or aortic homograft is approximately 90 minutes.<sup>51</sup> A contemporary series of 100 consecutive aortic homografts (virtually all root replacements including 13 reoperations) demonstrated no hospital mortality with 100% survival at 1 year and 98% at 5 years.<sup>52</sup>

In contrast, patients with active endocarditis exhibit a higher early mortality ranging from 8 to 16%.<sup>42,53-56</sup> PVE (17.9-18.8%) is worse than native (2.6-10%).<sup>53,57</sup>

Hemorrhage, heart block, stroke, myocardial infarction, and wound complications occur with similar frequency to those of other AVRs, but early risk of endocarditis is lower with homografts than any other replacement valve.<sup>35</sup>

# Hemodynamics and Exercise Capacity

Hemodynamic characteristics of homografts are excellent at short- and medium-term follow-up, both at rest and during exercise. <sup>58,59</sup> A study of 31 patients demonstrated increases in peak and mean gradients of 6.6 and 3.0 mm Hg, respectively, without a significant change in effective orifice area (EOA). <sup>58</sup> Importantly, the EOA of even the 17 to 19 mm homografts was 1.7 cm² and larger valves approximated the normal aortic valve areas as high as 2.7 cm² for 24 to 27 mm homografts.

The typical subcoronary homograft implant demonstrates a 1 to 2 mm Hg drop in mean transvalvular gradient over the first 6 months but with full root replacement, the hemodynamic benefit is fully realized immediately. In the randomized trial of homograft versus stentless porcine root replacement the mean gradients were only 6  $\pm$  1 mm Hg in the stentless and 5  $\pm$  2 mm Hg in the homografts. Only one patient in each group had mild regurgitation after 5 years. <sup>51</sup> These authors concluded that stentless and homograft root replacements are hemodynamically equivalent in the mid-term.

# Long-term Outcomes

Long-term outcome has been shown to be technique dependent in a meta analysis of over 3000 patients (37% full root, 63% subcoronary) from 18 studies with a mean

follow up of 12.5 years. Reoperation was significantly lower in the root replacement group.<sup>60</sup> There may have been some bias against reoperation in failing roots, where failing subcoronary implants were more readily subjected to reoperation.

The pioneering work of Mark O'Brien in Brisbane, Australia produced a huge series of homograft patients over nearly three decades with 99.3% follow-up. $^{50}$  This series demonstrated that rates of reoperation were lower in the full root patients (n = 3, 0.85%) than the subcoronary (n = 18, 3.3%). Of note, operative mortality was only 1.13% in 352 root patients.

Long-term durability was compromised by young age of recipient to the point that those under 20 years of age had a 47% rate of reoperation for structural valve degeneration at 10 years. Conversely, those over 60 had a 94% freedom from reoperation at 15 years and those between 21 and 60 had 81 to 85% freedom at 15 years. This series confirmed the very low incidence of thromboembolic phenomena (without anticoagulation) and a low but not insignificant rate of endocarditis.

Lund reported crude survival at 10 and 20 years to be 67 and 35%, respectively,<sup>44</sup> while Langley and O'Brien reported actuarial survival at 10, 20, and 25 years to be 81, 58, and 19%.<sup>49,50</sup>

Structural valve failure of homografts increases with time, and approximates 19 to 38% at 10 years and 69 to 82% at 20 years. 44,49 Freedom from repeat AVR, for any reason, parallels structural valve failure and is 86.5 and 38.8% at 10 and 20 years, respectively. 49 As heterograft tissue technology has progressed, the difference between homograft and heterograft durability has narrowed to the point of near equivalency with both showing a dramatic age-dependent relationship with youngest patients failing most rapidly. 61

Freedom from endocarditis at 10 years is 93 to 98%, <sup>49,50</sup> and at 20 years 89 to 95%. <sup>44,49,50</sup> Freedom from thromboembolism at 15 and 20 years is 92 and 83%, respectively. <sup>50</sup> Thrombosis of a homograft has been reported, but in the setting of lupus anticardiolipin antibody syndrome. <sup>62</sup>

In patients with active endocarditis requiring AVR, results may be poorer with survival ranging from 58% at 5 years<sup>53</sup> to 91% at 10 years,<sup>56</sup> and is significantly lower in patients with PVE.<sup>54</sup> Of note, however, the risk of recurrent endocarditis is <4% up to 4 years postoperatively.<sup>43,53,54,56</sup> These results still compare favorably with alternatives so aortic homograft is considered by many to be the valve of choice for aortic valve or root replacement in patients with active endocarditis.

#### Stentless Porcine Root Results

Very few randomized trials exist comparing stentless and stented valves. Most data available are single-center case series outcomes or case cohort analyses comparing stentless valves to previously published stented valve outcomes. We present the current literature looking at perioperative outcomes, hemodynamics, and durability.

### **Perioperative Outcomes**

Operative mortality defined as death during the index hospitalization or within 30 days ranges between 1.8 and 9.6%<sup>61,62</sup> with most experienced centers reporting operative mortalities around 3 to 5%. Many of the series that reported their mortality outcomes included patients who received concomitant coronary bypass or other valve surgery at the time of Freestyle root implantation making it difficult to compare these outcomes to isolated AVR or isolated bio-Bentall results. The predictors of operative mortality in these series included concomitant valve surgery, congestive heart failure, age, and coronary disease.<sup>63</sup> In a recent systematic review of the literature Sherrah and colleagues found the weighted mean for mortality to be 5.2% and 5.5% for adverse neurological events.<sup>64</sup>

### Hemodynamics and Durability

The Freestyle stentless valve is often selected for its superior hemodynamic performance that has been demonstrated in multiple series. 65,66 A meta-analysis of 919 patients by Kunadian and colleagues demonstrated that compared with stented valves, the Freestyle exhibited a larger effective orifice area index (EOAI) and lower transvalvular gradients.<sup>67</sup> The weighted mean difference in aortic gradients was 3.57 mm Hg which some may argue is small; however, there was a more rapid rate of left ventricular mass regression in Freestyle valve patients although this difference disappeared at 12 months. Of note the majority of valves in this metaanalysis were implanted using the subcoronary technique as opposed to the full root replacement. Although the full root replacement technique is a longer and slightly more complicated procedure, it has been shown to yield even lower transvalvular gradients.68

The hemodynamic benefits of stentless valves are further exaggerated during exercise. In a study of 106 patients, Khoo and colleagues compared the hemodynamic performance of five different stentless and stented valves under rest and stress using dobutamine stress echocardiography. <sup>69</sup> They found the stentless bioprostheses exhibited a resting gradient of 9 mm Hg that increased to 16 mm Hg under peak stress. Conversely the stented porcine and bovine valves exhibited rest gradients of 15 and 20 mm Hg, respectively, that under peak stress increased to 29 and 30 mm Hg, respectively. Of note, the mean valve size implanted was 23 mm for the Freestyle, 23 mm for the stented porcine valve, and 21 mm for the stented bovine valve. There have been some early data to suggest that newer-generation stented valves have improved transvalvular gradients. <sup>70</sup>

A number of large case series have reported excellent long-term durability of the stentless porcine prosthesis. More recently Amabile and colleagues examined a cohort of 500 patients undergoing Freestyle valve implantation.<sup>71</sup> In this series 96% of cases were done using the modified subcoronary technique with the remaining 4% being a full root replacement. Mean age of patients was 74.5 years and 10-year

actuarial survival for all-cause mortality was 44% and survival from valve-related mortality was 70%. Moreover, freedom from structural valve deterioration was 94% at 10 years yielding a cumulative incidence of structural valve deterioration of 3.7% at 10 years. When the authors examined outcomes in patients, less than 65 years at time of implantation the 10-year actuarial survival from valve-related mortality was 87%. Bach and Kon examined 15-year outcomes of the Freestyle valve in their patients with a mean age of 72 years and found a freedom from valve-related death to be 92.7%. This study found the specific causes of valve-related death to include thromboembolism, endocarditis, anticoagulation-related hemorrhage, and structural valve deterioration. The results of the Freestyle valve show it has similar durability to standard stented prostheses.

# **Stentless Valve Reoperations**

Because of extensive calcification after many years the risk at reoperation after homograft or Freestyle valve replacement can be as high as 20%. The subcoronary implants may be easier in this regard because the native aortic root is preserved. The full root replacement is more of a problem. Up to about 10 years, the calcification is limited and it is theoretically possible to place a new valve inside the stentless valve annulus after removing the leaflets. Ultimately, however, the conduit becomes so rigid as to preclude such an alternative and complete re-replacement of the root is required (see Fig. 29-5). The most hazardous part of this operation is related to the coronary ostial buttons which must be protected and available for use again.

Reoperation can be made easier by anticipating the need for this at the original operation. Keeping the coronary buttons large at the initial operation is one way to avoid problems with dissecting them again. The stentless valve-root should be kept as short as possible to minimize the extent of ultimately calcified wall and maximize the amount of normal aorta available for subsequent cannulation and clamping. Closing the pericardium or using a pericardial substitute can make sternal reentry safer. Careful assessment of the aorta and mediastinum on CT preoperatively can alert one to the need for early peripheral cannulation and even sternotomy under circulatory arrest.

Clamping the aorta distal to the main pulmonary artery is very useful in these cases and avoids the hazards of entering a great vessel while dissecting between them before the clamp is on. Complete excision of the calcified wall is often the best policy but leaving a little margin around each coronary ostium may make reconstruction easier. Another stentless valve is often an excellent solution because it is easier to reimplant the coronary ostia especially with the homograft, but even a Ross operation can be done in this setting as was done for the 40-year-old man (shown in Fig. 29-6).

An increasingly attractive option in the future for older patients is transcatheter valve replacement which should be well suited to the calcified stentless root as reported from Milan.<sup>75</sup> (see Fig. 29-7).

# PULMONARY AUTOGRAFT: ROSS PROCEDURE

### **Theoretical Considerations**

The pulmonary autograft shares the hemodynamic advantages and antithrombotic features of the homograft but is the only valve which has the benefit of being fully viable

autologous tissue. Pulmonary leaflets have been found to have equivalent breaking strain to aortic leaflets and even higher tensile strength.<sup>76</sup> The living pulmonary valve demonstrates the adaptability of human biology to change in response to changing physiologic conditions. The histologic features of this adaptation have been elegantly described and illustrated.<sup>77</sup> The initial response is to lay down a collagenrich support on the ventricular aspect of the leaflets. This thins out later but remains slightly thicker than normal aortic leaflets. All three layers of the leaflets, fibrosa, spongiosa, and ventricularis contain viable cells which maintain a rich extracellular matrix to support the leaflet function. Endothelial cells are transformed to become capable of smooth muscle actin production becoming more like the aortic than the pulmonary phenotype. The autograft (pulmonary artery) walls are a different story. There is rapid loss of elastin with fragmentation and loss of cellularity and increasing collagen deposition. This may reflect the need to sacrifice elasticity for strength to withstand systemic pressure.

#### **Patient Selection**

The cardinal principal in selecting patients for the Ross Procedure is that they must have a life expectancy of at least 20 to 25 years. Other simpler alternatives can be expected to give 10 to 15 years even in young patients although durability of tissue valves in patients under 35 years of age can be very limited. Active lifestyle, potential for child-bearing, and contra-indications to anticoagulation favor the Ross. Many young people seek out this option specifically to avoid the issues of anticoagulation and to allow even extreme athletic activity such as mountain biking and triathlons. Practically speaking, the ideal patient is under 50 years of age but special circumstances can extend this to 65 or even slightly higher. The improvements in tissue valves and hope for "valve-in-valve" catheter-based rescue in the future has pushed the age downward for tissue valves to relegate the Ross to the youngest ages.

The generally accepted contraindications are significant pulmonary valve disease, congenitally abnormal pulmonary valves (eg, bicuspid or quadricuspid), Marfan syndrome, other connective tissue disorders, complex coronary anomalies, and probably severe coexisting autoimmune disease, particularly if it is the cause of the aortic valve disease. Active rheumatic disease is a relative contra-indication as the autograft can be attacked early by the acute rheumatic process and lead to early failure. Bacterial endocarditis is not a contraindication for the Ross procedure, though it is best used when only leaflet destruction is present or when root involvement can be reconstructed without distortion. 79

Comorbid conditions should also be considered prior to offering this operation to any given patient. These conditions often limit life expectancy and also influence the ability of the patient to withstand this longer procedure. Poor left ventricular function, multivessel coronary disease and need for complex mitral repair are examples. Ascending aortic dilatation and aneurysm have been considered contraindications by some, but these can be easily addressed and

should be. Previous AVR or other open cardiac operations are not a contra-indication to the Ross, but all the standard considerations of reoperative surgery apply including appropriate imaging to allow safe sternal reentry.

Bicuspid aortic valves (BAVs) are the most common etiology of severe AS or regurgitation in patients under 65 years of age. Some have felt this group should not undergo the Ross procedure because of potential complications of intrinsic aortopathy which is common in BAV patients. Since this is the largest group of patients potentially to benefit from the operation, it has been the quest of Ross surgeons to find ways to make the operation safe and durable in this situation. Controversy still exists as to whether primary AR is less favorable than primary AS. The patient with AS is more likely to have a smaller annulus which is resistant to dilatation as opposed to the AR patient whose annulus is often dilated and continues to dilate if not supported. Tirone David suggests that 27 to 28 mm is the largest annulus to allow a Ross or 15 mm/m².

There is also more of a tendency to distal aortic dilatation in the setting of AR as opposed to AS. These issues are addressable by technical modifications which will be discussed later in detail.

### **Preoperative Evaluation**

Because most candidates for the Ross are under 50 years of age, it is not usually necessary to subject them to cardiac catheterization. CTA is an excellent tool to evaluate the entire ascending aorta and arch as well as the proximal coronary arteries. CMR can be used as well but does not give as much resolution as CTA for the coronaries. Both give excellent imaging of the entire aorta (see Fig. 29-8). TTE gives excellent assessment of the aortic valve, ventricular function, and aortic root. Approximately 1% of patients will be found to have a bicuspid pulmonary valve at surgery. Unfortunately, echo, CTA, and CMR have all been limited in their ability to define the morphology of the pulmonary valve. With proper gating, timing of contrast and attention to the pulmonary trunk, however, this can be determined fairly reliably (see Fig. 29-9).

# **Technique**

The original description by Donald Ross involved a fully scalloped subcoronary implant of the pulmonary autograft using essentially the same technique he had used for a subcoronary homograft implant. Modifications were adopted to decrease the immediate incidence of regurgitation by maintaining the cylindrical geometry of the autograft either within the aortic root or as a complete replacement thereof. The root replacement has become the most commonly employed technique.

Full median sternotomy is usually the best incision. Aortic cannulation should be kept high and bicaval cannulation is preferable because the open RVOT is a constant source of air. Initial antegrade and then generous retrograde cold blood cardioplegia is employed insulating the heart from surrounding structures and monitoring the effectiveness of myocardial

cooling with a septal temperature probe. Traditional venting via the right superior pulmonary vein is not necessary as the open pulmonary artery serves that purpose.

Extensive dissection between the great vessels allows retraction of the aorta with an umbilical tape and keeps the cross clamp off the right pulmonary artery. After clamping the aorta, the space between the aortic and pulmonary roots is dissected until the roots are completely separated. Final

separation is often safest after the aorta is opened and coronary locations can be readily identified. The last few millimeters must be done very gently as the facing pulmonary sinus is virtually fused to the aortic root at the right-left commissure.

A rather high transverse aortotomy incision keeps all technique options open but if a subcoronary implant is planned, splitting the root down vertically into the noncoronary sinus can be employed to increase exposure. The aortic valve

**FIGURE 29-9** Evaluation of pulmonic valve by CMR. (A) Longitudinal view. (B) Cross-sectional view showing three distinct leaflets and sinuses.

pathology is inspected as well as coronary ostial positions. A stenotic valve can be excised at this point and the annulus debrided and measured. A dilated annulus can be plicated down at the posterior commissure. A subcommissural annuloplasty can be done to support a subcoronary or inclusion root procedure at this point.

Common to any of the techniques is the need to harvest the pulmonary autograft from the RVOT. The close proximity of the left coronary system and general constraints of this maneuver are obvious from the elegant anatomical casts published by Muresian.<sup>84</sup> The main pulmonary artery is incised transversely just distal to the valve and the opening extended to either side taking care to avoid the left coronary. A flexible sucker can be placed in the distal PA as a vent. The pulmonic valve is inspected to make sure it is a healthy, three leaflet valve with minimal fenestrations. The remainder of the PA is divided. The adipose tissue between the back of the PA and the left main is gently dissected down to the muscle in the back of the RVOT with the cautery. The left anterior descending coronary artery can be very close to the back and the left side of the RVOT and must be protected.

The RVOT is opened with a #15 blade well below the anterior commissure as determined by palpation or by passing a suture or clamp through the muscle about 5 to 6 mm below the valve from inside out (see Fig. 29-10). The initial incision is cautiously extended until the leaflet can be clearly seen. The dissection then continues around each side leaving 3 to 4 mm of muscle cuff. Posteriorly, a natural plane can be appreciated between the right and left ventricular septal components. The septal perforators are always in the left side and can be avoided by taking only the right ventricular part of the septum. Most often they are not seen. Small branches of the coronary sinus posteriorly can be the source of annoying venous bleeding at the end so gentle administration of retrograde can identify these and allow control at this point.

![](_page_11_Picture_9.jpeg)

**FIGURE 29-10** Pulmonary autograft harvest. A right-angle clamp can be passed through the right ventricular outflow tract muscle below the anterior commissure to assure safe beginning of the harvest incision.

The autograft is trimmed by following the curvilinear course of the leaflets on the inflow end leaving a smooth 3 to 4 mm cuff of muscle. The inflow end is measured by gently inserting cylindrical sizers. The RVOT opening can also be measured at this time. An appropriate pulmonary homograft can then be thawed.

# **Subcoronary Technique**

If the subcoronary or inclusion cylinder technique is chosen, the operation proceeds similarly to subcoronary homograft replacement. Proximal and distal suture lines are constructed as described. Of note, the aortic root must match the autograft at both the annulus and the sinotubular junction. Accordingly, tailoring of the root with annuloplasty and/or downsizing the sinotubular junction may be required. The tops of the autograft commissures must be placed at least a centimeter above the top of the natives to maintain adequate height of the new valve. The potential advantage of this technique is to preserve the native root support around the autograft which may prevent autograft dilatation and insufficiency. However, if the native aorta dilates, the autograft will do so as well.

### Root Replacement Technique

In preparation for full root replacement, the aortic transection is completed and the coronary ostial buttons are dissected out and mobilized appropriately. The native noncoronary sinus and the "pillar" of tissue between the right and the left buttons are preserved for later "reinclusion" around the autograft root (Fig. 29-11). The best orientation for the autograft is determined

![](_page_12_Picture_7.jpeg)

**FIGURE 29-11** Proximal autograft suture line. The continuous suture technique is facilitated by leaving the sutures loose enough to easily see the leaflets to optimize depth and spacing and minimize tearing of this delicate muscle cuff. A measured strip of felt is incorporated in this suture line. Note that the noncoronary sinus tissue and the "pillar" of tissue between the coronary buttons has been preserved for later inclusion around the autograft root.

by placing it in the aortic root. Usually the bare area from the back of the PA is positioned in the left coronary sinus.

A strip of Teflon felt about 5 to 7 mm wide is cut to length around a sizer 2 mm larger than the inflow size of the autograft. The proximal autograft suture line is constructed incorporating the felt strip. This can be done with interrupted 3-0 or 4-0 simple sutures best organized on suture guides. Continuous 4-0 polypropylene can also be used beginning under the right-left commissure and working down the left sinus. The noncoronary and right sinuses follow. The sutures are left loose and slightly remote to facilitate visibility. When completed, the suture line is carefully tightened with nerve hooks and tied securely.

The coronary buttons are then reimplanted with continuous 6-0 Prolene. The position of the right coronary is always higher than anticipated, usually just at the sinotubular junction of the autograft. Occasionally, it is so high that it must be implanted in native aorta above the distal autograft suture line.

Excess pulmonary artery wall is trimmed from the autograft down to just above the commissures and very close to the tops of the coronary buttons. The native aortic wall elements that were preserved earlier are now brought up beside the autograft and shortened if necessary. If the native root was dilated or frankly aneurismal, artificial support can be employed using felt patches or vascular graft material.

The distal autograft is attached to the ascending aorta with continuous 4-0 polypropylene incorporating the natural and/or fabric support elements along with another strip of felt placing the sutures right at the tops of the commissures to establish a new sinotubular junction (see Fig. 29-12). With the aorta closed, antegrade cardioplegia can be administered to give a test of valve competence and integrity of the coronary and distal suture lines.

The pulmonary homograft is now attached to the RVOT with continuous 4-0 polypropylene. Care is taken to take long and superficial bites posteriorly over the area of the septal perforator. The distal suture line is completed with continuous 4-0 or 5-0 polypropylene. Warm blood can be administered retrograde during the last half of this suture line.

The ascending aorta is vented and the cross-clamp removed. Generous reperfusion time is recommended. Bleeding is certainly a risk with so many needle holes in delicate tissue submitted to aortic pressure. For this reason, care must be taken to avoid vigorous retraction which can cause more harm than good. Amicar is recommended as is autologous blood removal at the beginning of the operation for return at the end. Biological glues can be helpful but their use is not a substitute for accurate suture line construction.

# **Concomitant Aortic Surgery**

Because of the recognition that patients with BAVs are at risk for late dilatation and aneurysm of the ascending aorta, one should resect any aorta >5 cm in diameter. Below 3.5 cm it is hard to justify any treatment. Between 3.5 and 4.5 cm it is reasonable to employ plication or lateral aortorrhaphy concepts to bring the aorta down to 3.5 or less. 86,87 Between

**FIGURE 29-12** Fabric support of autograft wall. (A) The arterial wall of the autograft is supported by segments of vascular graft material especially when native aortic wall is intrinsically poor. The entire autograft is enclosed with a combination of native aortic wall and vascular graft material and attached to the ascending aortic graft incorporating another strip of felt. (B) Completed Ross with external fabric support and ascending aortic replacement as well.

4.5 and 5 cm special judgment is required to individualize treatment. Because the vast majority of dissection in the BAV patient begins in the ascending aorta, 88 complete resection of aneurysms up to the arch (hemiarch replacement) should be considered. This actually adds very little time to the operation if planned appropriately. The proximal end of the aortic graft is attached to the (usually reinforced) autograft root to restore aortic continuity.

#### Results

No discussion of the Ross Operation could be complete without a careful look back at the pioneer series of patients treated

by Donald Ross.<sup>89</sup> The 1997 paper from this seminal source analyzed 131 hospital survivors followed for 9 to 26 years with a mean of 20 years. The technical problems that led to early reoperation with the subcoronary technique were recognized in that series and the cylinder modification adopted. Even the full root replacement method was employed as an alternative by Ross in 20 patients beginning as early as 1974.90 Survival at 10 and 20 years was a remarkable 85 and 61%, respectively. Freedom from autograft replacement was 88 and 75%, where freedom from homograft replacement was 89 and 80% each at 10 and 20 years. Of 53 late deaths, 46 were cardiac. Importantly, of the 30 autografts that were explanted, only three had evidence of degenerative changes which was patchy and did not involve all leaflets. The remainder had completely viable structure as long as 24 years after implantation. Clearly, the transplanted pulmonary autograft is and remains a fully living valve. Homograft stenosis accounted for all but 1 of 20 late reoperations on the right side. Thromboembolic phenomena were documented in 20 patients but only one did not have another systemic risk factor for a source.

# Exercise Hemodynamics of the Ross Operation

Multiple studies demonstrate the excellent hemodynamic profile offered by the autograft in the Ross operation. A comparison with normal age- and gender-matched controls showed peak gradients going from only 2 to 4 mm Hg in both groups with exercise. EOAs of 3.5 cm² (EOAI 1.9 cm²/m²) did not change with exercise in either group. Full root Ross patients had better hemodynamics than subcoronary Ross patients but the difference (1.98  $\pm$  0.57 vs 1.64  $\pm$  0.43 cm²/m²) was more important statistically than it was clinically. This study also documented the superiority of the Ross hemodynamics over stented and stentless valves and even over aortic homografts.

It is important to remember that the Ross operation includes RVOT reconstruction and the hemodynamics of that structure can adversely affect exercise capacity. One study documented an average resting gradient of  $14 \pm 10$  mm Hg rising to  $25 \pm 22$  mm Hg for the pulmonary homografts of Ross patients compared to only  $3 \pm 1$  mm Hg at rest and  $5 \pm 4$  mm Hg with exercise in the normal native RVOT of aortic homograft recipients.  $^{93}$  The higher gradients in the RVOT may contribute to slightly lower maximal oxygen consumption compared to normal controls even though Ross patients easily exceeded 100% of predicted consumption.

# **Contemporary Results**

There was a lot of enthusiasm for doing the Ross procedure in the 1990s which faded soon after 2000 after results were less than optimal. Those suboptimal results are at the heart of a study by Reece et al.  $^{94}$  reviewing data from the STS database from 1994 through 2010 which reported a nearly threefold higher operative mortality for Ross as opposed to standard AVR after propensity matching (2.7 vs 0.9%; p = .001).

Importantly, the data available in the STS database for that time period included many of the very low volume operators (132 of 220 centers reported less than 6 total cases in this time period) and did not include any of the patients done by the highest volume surgeon in North America. They excluded 66 surgeons who only did one case in these 14 years. In addition, they noted more reexplorations for bleeding (9.4 vs 5.8%) and more renal failure (2.6 vs 0.8%) for the Ross operations. The conclusion was that the Ross could not be considered a reasonable alternative to simpler forms of AVR because of this higher rate of morbidity and mortality. These data in low volume centers are in stark contrast to results from high volume centers. Zebele and colleagues in the United Kingdom, performed a recent review of aortic valve procedures between 2000 and 2011 in children and young adults (16-30 years old) and showed a steadily decreasing trend in the use of the Ross despite an increasingly low mortality rate which reached 0% for the last 4 years of the study. The 1-year survival rate after Ross was 98.8% compared to 96.6% after AVR.95 They concluded that the Ross operation could be done very safely in all young age groups with a lower mortality than alternatives. They observed decreased utilization of the technique but could not explain it on the basis of technical complexity or operative mortality alone. The author's own experience demonstrated a "learning curve" with three deaths in the first 30, three more in the next 178 and no deaths or reoperations for bleeding in the next 300.96 Clearly the complexities of reoperative status, need for circulatory arrest replacement of ascending aneurysm, and concomitant mitral repair should encourage referral to an experienced surgeon if a Ross procedure is to be considered. Individualized discussion with each patient should examine the options and consider the potential risks and benefits of each. Hence it seems more appropriate using the Society for Thoracic Surgeons Database results to conclude that Ross operations should not be performed in very low-volume centers but should be referred to regional reference centers with strong experience in aortic root surgery including the Ross.

When done in experienced hands, there are solid data from four continents to support the fact that this operation can be done with only 1% mortality risk and no increase in morbidity despite the longer ischemic and perfusion times for this more complex procedure that often includes replacement or repair of the ascending aorta. There is definitely a learning curve but much of that learning can be minimized by training under experienced operators.

With operative mortality now approaching that of alternative valve replacements, the long-term results are the key point in considering the Ross operation for any given patient. The comparative incidence of reoperation for structural valve deterioration with present-generation tissue valves and the continuing risks of thromboembolism and anticoagulant-related hemorrhage with modern mechanical devices must be fairly presented to patients along with the data for the Ross.

A thorough review of available series confirms that survival is extremely good after the Ross operation and approximates that of the normal age-matched population.<sup>83,99</sup> Combined

with its low incidence of thromboembolic complications and endocarditis as well as avoidance of anticoagulation with its risks of bleeding, the Ross is a very attractive option for young people. Some of these patients will undoubtedly require further surgery, but the outcomes of subsequent surgery have also been extremely good which contributes to the long-term survival. 99,100

Elkins reported results in 487 patients operated between 1986 and 2002.<sup>101</sup> Hospital mortality occurred in 19 patients (3.9%). Of 15 late deaths, none were due to reoperation but only seven were not cardiac related. Actuarial freedom from all cause mortality was 92 ± 2% at 10 years and 82 ± 6% at 16 years. There was only one documented thromboembolic event. Actuarial freedom from endocarditis was 95 ± 6% at 16 years. Of 38 patients who needed further surgery, autograft reoperation was more common than homograft reoperation. Importantly, the vast majority of these patients had bicuspid or even unicuspid morphology but their risk of reoperation was actually lower than the 9/78 three leaflet valve patients. Patients with primary AR fared significantly worse until 1996 when the institution of routine annular reduction and fixation was initiated. Subsequent results in AR were then only slightly inferior to those in AS in whom the 15-year freedom from autograft valve failure was 82 ± 6%. Technique seemed important as only 21/389 full roots required reoperation where 17/79 intra-aortic implants did. Autograft support was subsequently shown to be beneficial in the German-Dutch Ross Registry data. 102

### Incidence of Reoperation Post Ross Overall, Autograft, Homograft

#### PULMONARY AUTOGRAFT DYSFUNCTION

Pulmonary autograft stenosis has never been reported but the incidence of regurgitation increases with time and seems to be due to autograft or native aortic dilatation or both (Fig. 29-13). The recognition of early AR due to technical problems with intra-aortic implants led to wide-spread acceptance of the root replacement method when we reported this in 1989.<sup>103</sup> Unfortunately, the totally unsupported autograft as a freestanding aortic root replacement proved to have potential for dilatation with root aneurysm and AR as a result. Annular dilatation was appreciated early and addressed with annuloplasty and external fixation with fixed pericardium or prosthetic material. Dilatation at the sinus and sinotubular junction levels was not appreciated and addressed until about a decade later. Much light has been shed on this problem over the last few years. Brown found that preoperative ascending aortic dilatation, male gender, and postoperative systemic hypertension were significant in a Cox proportional hazard analysis for the development of moderate neo-AR. 104 Hypertension, particularly early postoperatively, can cause acute dilatation and damage to the delicate autograft leaflets before they have time to adapt to the systemic pressure environment. The unsupported root technique having failed in 22 of 142 patients in Rotterdam over a 17-year period, the adult Ross procedure was abandoned at Erasmus. 105 David

expressed concern about the potential for dilatation at multiple levels particularly in bicuspid valve patients because of a higher incidence of aortic wall pathology. <sup>106</sup> The data from the German-Dutch Ross Registry include 1642 adult patients

with mean follow up over 7 years. 102 There were 120 autograft reinterventions in 113 patients. The use of an unreinforced root replacement technique and preoperative pure AR were significant predictors of shorter time to reoperation. BAV had no influence on reoperation rate. A lower reoperation rate was observed in reinforced roots although this was not statistically significant from subcoronary operations.

#### ROOT REINFORCEMENT TECHNIQUES

In the quest to further address autograft support and prevention of late dilatation, a number of surgeons have developed techniques (in addition to those described earlier) to support the autograft. One of the more disseminated techniques is a full fabric jacket around the autograft made from vascular graft material. 107,108 The jacket is sized approximately 4 mm larger than the autograft and the autograft is sewn to the jacket at the proximal and distal ends with generous openings created for the coronary buttons. The autograft and vascular graft jacket are then sewn to the aortic annulus and distal aorta. When sewing the coronary buttons, some advocate including the jacket in this anastomosis while others have just sewn the buttons directly to the autograft wall. 109,110 Al Rashidi and colleagues reported 4.5-year results using this jacket support method in 13 patients and showed no failures and less autograft dilatation compared to patients who did not have jacket support.111

Other techniques similar to the ones described in this author's technique focus on supporting the annulus and STJ using felt support to fix these regions and prevent dilatation at these points (Fig. 29-12). This has been shown to decrease autograft failure in the German-Dutch Ross Registry. <sup>102</sup> In order to prevent proximal autograft dilatation, a number of surgeons have suggested plicating the aortic annulus and or distal aorta if they are dilated. <sup>112</sup>

#### PULMONARY HOMOGRAFT DYSFUNCTION

As part of the Ross operation, the single aortic valve operation becomes a double-valve operation also leaving the RVOT substitute at risk for future problems. The pioneer series clearly demonstrated the homograft to be superior to other alternatives of that day, but controversy remains particularly over the advantages and disadvantages of homograft viability on the right side. Although the initial hemodynamics of the cryopreserved pulmonary homografts are excellent, consistent increase in transvalvular gradients occurs within 6 to 12 months. This early increase in gradient usually stabilizes by 2 years but can be progressive in 1 to 2% of patients. An immune system response has been implicated but the mechanisms are poorly understood.<sup>113</sup>

Late imaging of pulmonary homografts reveals extensive calcification of the inflow end indicative of an intense scar response to the homograft muscle cuff (Fig. 29-14). Schmidtke and associates tried to minimize this with a unique trimming of the muscle and replacing it with a cuff of pericardium.<sup>114</sup> This proved effective over the first 2 years but failed to make a long-term difference. An intense adventitial inflammatory

reaction with diffuse thickening along the entire homograft was described with elegant magnetic resonance imaging flow studies by Carr-White. 115 This caused extrinsic compression of the conduit portion of the homograft.

The incidence of homograft stenosis is probably 5 to 10% at 10 years. Risk factors proposed include younger donor age, shorter time of cryopreservation, and homograft size. 116 Because small size is the most consistent risk factor, oversizing helps reduce the effect of shrinkage. In a series of 338 patients in France, only three patients required isolated homograft intervention and all were treated successfully with a catheter-based valve. The low incidence was felt due to policy of oversizing and use of anti-inflammatory drugs early after surgery. 100

Review of the homograft outcomes in the German-Dutch Ross Registry show a mean gradient of 4.7 at one month increasing to 10 by 14 years with peak gradients going from 8.4 to 18.5 mm Hg. Most of the increase comes in the first 2 years and then levels off to very slow increase. They found that smaller conduit size (mean was 26  $\pm$  2.15 mm) was the most important risk factor with lesser impact from younger patient and donor age.  $^{97}$ 

Most patients tolerate peak gradients up to 50 mm Hg without symptoms so the clinical significance is less than the incidence of stenosis. In the Oklahoma series, homograft failure (reoperation or percutaneous intervention) occurred in 33 of 487 patients giving actuarial freedom from failure of 90  $\pm$  2% at 10 years and 82  $\pm$  4% at 16 years.  $^{101}$  The advent of catheter-based valve replacement has made it possible to treat some of these patients percutaneously.  $^{117}$ 

Moderate or even severe homograft regurgitation may also be detected by echocardiography in as much as 10% of patients by 10 years but this lesion is well tolerated by the right ventricle in the absence of pulmonary hypertension. It is probable that most pulmonary homografts will ultimately suffer this mode of failure but the majority will last 20 to 25 years before they reach this point.

After four decades of use and research, the cryopreserved pulmonary homograft is the best RVOT substitute documented for use in the Ross procedure. Rarely, a stentless porcine bioprosthesis has been used. Tissue engineering concepts seem ideally suited to this low pressure area where a decellularized homograft or even heterograft matrix can perform nicely while providing an environment suitable for maturation of new cellular elements derived from circulating stem cells, adjacent ingrowth, or preoperative seeding. Initial clinical studies with both show promise. 30,118,119 and mid-term outcomes from the German-Dutch Ross Registry observed that decellularized homografts exhibited lower gradients than cryopreserved grafts at 6 years. 97

Use of alternatives to the homograft has been disappointing. Stentless tissue valves have been shown to be an acceptable alternative when homografts are not available but calcification of the xenografts is worse than the homografts. A large series included 73 stentless porcine devices in the pulmonary position had a 10-fold incidence of gradients over 40 mm Hg compared to homografts. Tissue-engineered

porcine pulmonary devices have been troubled by poor outcomes in the short term. 122

#### **POST ROSS REOPERATION**

The prospect of reoperation after a Ross procedure has been regarded as a complex and hazardous undertaking. $^{105}$ 

It is important to realize that reoperative aortic root surgery is not simple and should be done only in centers with considerable experience and volume. Redo Ross surgery is certainly in this category, perhaps more so because of the homograft in the RVOT to make things more complicated. Stulak et al. reported the Mayo Clinic experience with 56 patients requiring reoperation after a Ross most of which (43) had been done at other institutions. Only one patient died (1.8%), but six patients had respiratory failure and three required ECMO support. There were four more deaths within 8 months. This experience brought them to the conclusion that patients need to be warned about potential for risky reoperative surgery in the future when they choose to have a Ross procedure in the first place.

On the other hand, the largest experience reported for reoperative surgery after Ross is from the German-Dutch Ross Registry and paints a far less ominous picture. One hundred and sixty reoperations were done on either the autograft 82, homograft 61, or both 17. 124 All patients survived short and long term. The updated series in 2012 revealed that six patients had died at 224 reoperations (2.6%) in the Registry. 125 Five of the six had endocarditis and all needed urgent or emergent surgery. There was still no mortality with elective reoperation. Emergency surgery for endocarditis is a challenging problem but this is true for any infected prosthetic root. Planned reoperation in experienced hands has lower mortality rate than many series of elective root surgery.

The availability of the bovine jugular vein with its intrinsic valve in a stent frame has become a valuable tool to treat pulmonary homograft stenosis. Initial dilatation with a balloon while demonstrating angiographic patency of the left main system is essential to avoid coronary compromise with this technique. 126

Alsoufi and colleagues in Saudi Arabia had a predominantly young rheumatic population in which 50 of 510 patients had redo AVR at a median of 3.8 years after Ross root replacement (without support in all but 7). There was minimal root dilatation so the autograft leaflets were simply removed and a stented bioprosthesis (12) or mechanical (38) valve was placed in a standard fashion at the annulus. Follow up after the redo operations averaged 8.4 years. Only one patient required a redo root replacement in that time which made them conclude that just replacing the valve was a valid option in Ross roots less than 4 cm in diameter at the time of reoperation.<sup>127</sup>

The Stuttgart team did 645 Ross operations almost all freestanding roots with support. Forty-nine autograft reoperations were required in 46 patients. A David procedure was done in 18 of 35 with primarily autograft dilatation at a mean of 11 years after the original surgery. Only one of these

required further surgery within 3 years. An interesting finding that has been observed by others is that the native pulmonary valve leaflets are found to have remodeled over time to look like typical aortic valve leaflets including the development of nodules of Aranti. 128

In Brussels where valve-sparing aortic root surgery is common, this technique was employed to save the autograft in 26 of 28 patients. Twenty of these had originally had root replacement Ross while the other six patients had an inclusion technique. Neo-aortic root dilatation was the primary reason for reoperation. Primary cusp prolapse was also treated but had unsatisfactory outcomes after repair. 129

Concern about dissection and rupture is largely unsupported. Rupture of the autograft has never been reported. Localized dissection of the autograft does occur but does not extend across circumferential suture lines that protect the distal aorta and the coronary ostia. The wall of the autograft, though thinner than native aorta, is encased in scar tissue from the original surgery making leakage into a free pericardial space extremely unlikely.

If moderate autograft regurgitation has developed with root dilatation, a policy of waiting for symptoms or ventricular dysfunction/dilatation typically indicative for surgical intervention should be considered appropriate, not just treating a sinus dimension. If distal native aorta dilates to 5.0 cm or greater, it may be reasonable to intervene before it gets to 5.5 cm in the setting of original BAV disease. If other valve disease or coronary disease dictates operative intervention, the dilated autograft should not be ignored. If the patient had no support at the original operation and root dilatation is the primary problem, then a valve-sparing technique can be considered or a Bentall option employed. The living autograft tissue makes mobilization of the coronary buttons easier because there is no calcification but they are still more delicate than native aorta and adhesions to the adjacent pulmonary homograft can make dissection in that area difficult. A Yacoub technique<sup>130</sup> is suitable if the annulus was supported with a felt strip at the original operation, but a David technique is needed if the annulus is dilated and/or unsupported. Alternatively, the Yacoub can be combined with annuloplasty or independent annular support to avoid extensive dissection between the autograft and homograft.<sup>131</sup> Need for major leaflet revision is a marker for less durability just as it is in primary valve-sparing surgery.

Complete redo root replacement should be considered if both the leaflets and the sinuses are problematic. The living, pliable autograft makes this much easier than a redo after a homograft or stentless porcine root and perhaps even after a standard Bentall.

Safe reoperation begins with appropriate planning at the original operation where closure of the pericardium or coverage of the heart with pericardial substitute will allow safe sternal reentry. Central cannulation is almost always possible, but peripheral cannulation should be considered in multiple reoperative settings or when preoperative imaging suggests perilous reentry. Crucial to safe conduct of these operations is avoidance of the plane between the pulmonary homograft and the aorta. There is usually plenty of room distal to the

pulmonary artery to clamp the aorta before this plane needs to be addressed. Coronary buttons are often very close to the distal autograft anastomosis so aortotomy at reoperation should never be proximal to this suture line. The complete spectrum of replacement options is open at reoperation including simple mechanical or stented tissue valves, subcoronary or full root stentless, aortic homograft, or Bentall operation with biologic or mechanical valved conduit. The RVOT homograft should be left alone unless grossly abnormal by preoperative evaluation. If reoperation is required for RVOT obstruction, this can be accomplished on the beating heart. The old conduit is opened longitudinally from normal right ventricular muscle to normal PA. The thick proximal scar is resected carefully and as much of the old conduit is removed as necessary to allow placement of a new homograft. The posterior wall and that facing the aorta can be left intact to avoid injury to the autograft and coronary tree.

#### **FINAL THOUGHTS**

Stentless aortic valve options provide unique advantages over stented valves. They are known for superb hemodynamics particularly in the small aortic annulus. For patients requiring replacement of the aortic root and valve, the stentless valves provide a conduit by which both issues can be addressed with one graft. Furthermore, in the setting of aortic root replacement the tissue of the stentless valve is friendlier when working with coronary button anastomoses and this is predominantly true in cases of reoperative aortic root surgery. The durability of both the homograft and Freestyle has been shown to be similar to that of the best of the stented valve options.

The stentless valve option can lead to a more complicated reoperation in either the subcoronary or full root technique and patients should be referred to expert centers where these surgeries can be done safely with low mortality and morbidity.

The Ross operation should be offered as an option for any patient under the age of 50 years with aortic valve disease and a life expectancy in excess of 20 to 25 years. Under ideal circumstances, it can be considered in the 50- to 65-year-old population where the Ross has the possibility of lasting to the end of a normal life span. Of all the substitutes for the diseased aortic valve, only the pulmonary autograft has all the biologic advantages of a truly living structure. It is delicate and demands precise implantation technique for immediate and long-term success. Appropriate aortic tailoring or support is needed in the majority of patients to prevent late autograft dilatation and dysfunction. Approximately 20% of patients will probably require additional surgery for either the neo-aortic or the neo-pulmonary aspects of this operation by 20 years but they will not require anticoagulation and will not be limited in activity or lifestyle during that time. In appropriate hands, this operation can be done very safely and is a durable and excellent choice for young active people with aortic valve disease. Compared to the virtually 100% reoperation rate at 20 years for animal tissue valves, unavoidable and ongoing risks of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications with mechanical valves and proven advantage

of the Ross over aortic homograft in randomized prospective trial, <sup>132,133</sup> the Ross is a very viable option. Long-term survival may actually be superior to any other aortic valve operation. Failure to offer this option misses an opportunity for this survival benefit. <sup>55</sup>
