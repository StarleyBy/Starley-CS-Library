# Long-term Mechanical Circulatory Support and the Total Artificial Heart

Andrew C. W. Baldwin • Courtney J. Gemmato • William E. Cohn • O. H. Frazier

Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of death in the United States and a significant public health concern throughout the world. Results from the Framingham Heart Study suggest that the lifetime risk of developing HF for Americans over the age of 40 years is approximately 20%, and the incidence of this disease steadily increases with age. An estimated 5.1 million Americans are living with HF. This figure is expected to grow significantly in the coming decades because the average age of the population is increasing, and advancements in medical therapy are allowing patients to live longer with their disease. The economic burden of disease is also high, and total healthcare costs attributed to HF exceed \$30 billion in the United States each year. In light of the increased mortality associated with HF, strategies for managing this disease have grown increasingly sophisticated.

Treatment of advanced HF is based on three principal methodologies: medical therapy, corrective surgical intervention, and cardiac support or replacement. Appropriate medical management with antihypertensive, diuretic, vasoactive, and inotropic therapy has been shown to improve symptoms, slow the progression of disease, and (in some cases) provide survival benefits.<sup>4</sup> Patients with more severe disease may benefit from specific surgical interventions such as coronary revascularization, valve replacement or repair, and ventricular restoration procedures.<sup>5,6</sup> These procedures often pose a high risk, and surgical candidacy is typically assessed on a case-bycase basis.

Selected patients with severe HF refractory to guidelinedirected medical therapy may ultimately be considered candidates for cardiac transplantation or mechanical circulatory support (MCS). Because of a relative scarcity of available donor organs for transplantation, device therapy has become an increasingly popular option for managing end-stage HF and offers documented survival benefits over medical therapy alone.<sup>7</sup> Whereas only 33 centers participated in the original clinical investigation (completed in 2009) of the HeartMate II left ventricular assist device (LVAD) (Thoratec, Inc., Pleasanton, CA), a total of 145 centers are now approved for device therapy in the United States. This number will likely continue to grow as this technology and other new MCS systems become more widely accessible.<sup>8,9</sup>

MCS is an inclusive term that refers to any device used to assist or replace the failing heart. The options are wideranging and include differences in pump location (implantable vs extracorporeal), support capabilities (left, right, or biventricular), and flow characteristics (pulsatile vs continuous). This chapter will focus primarily on the available long-term options for MCS, particularly current LVADs and the total artificial heart (TAH). Although MCS is not without inherent risks, rapid advancements in technology—paired with the practical limitations of transplantation—suggest that device therapy has an important role in both the present and the future of HF surgery.

# HISTORY OF MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY SUPPORT

Open heart surgery was made possible by the pioneering efforts of individuals seeking a method to provide temporary cardiopulmonary support by means of a mechanical pump oxygenator. The first successful use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was reported in 1953 by John Gibbon, <sup>10</sup> who used a CPB system of his own design to repair an atrial septal defect. Excessive mortality rates led some surgeons, including Gibbon himself, to abandon open heart surgery. In 1954, C. Walton Lillehei<sup>11</sup> reported the use of cross circulation (humanto-human perfusion), using a parent as a temporary source of cardiopulmonary support during the repair of congenital heart defects. Controversy stemming from this approach (particularly the risk of a 200% mortality rate) encouraged ongoing research in the field of mechanical support, and efforts

led by Lillehei, Richard DeWall, and John Kirklin quickly led to refinements in CPB technology, resulting in improved clinical outcomes. In April 1956, Denton Cooley reported the use of a modified bubble oxygenator in the repair of a postinfarction ventricular septal defect; he would perform 94 open heart procedures (primarily in children) by the end of the year.

The resulting wave of open heart procedures quickly led to the observation that some patients were unable to regain sufficient cardiac function to permit withdrawal from the heart-lung machine. Anecdotal experience suggested that slow weaning (over the course of hours) allowed some hearts to successfully recover function<sup>14</sup> (Fig. 62-1). As a result, interest in prolonged circulatory support led to the concept of a ventricular assist device (VAD). Decades earlier, the eccentric Russian scientist Vladimir Demikhov had successfully designed and tested a device capable of maintaining the perfusion of a dog for several hours.<sup>15</sup> Although this breakthrough occurred in 1937, his experiments were not widely known outside the Soviet Union until years later. Throughout the 1960s, research efforts at a number of institutions were focused on the development of MCS technology. A federally funded program with this goal was established at Baylor College of Medicine, in Houston, with Michael DeBakey as its director.

The first clinical application of an LVAD was performed by DeBakey in 1963, who used the device as a temporizing measure in a patient with cardiogenic shock after aortic valve replacement. Although the pump functioned satisfactorily, the patient succumbed to pulmonary complications 4 days after its implantation. On August 8, 1966, DeBakey implanted an LVAD in a 37-year-old woman with severe HF who could not be weaned from CPB after aortic and mitral valve replacement. An extracorporeal pneumatic device, the pump routed blood from the left atrium to the right axillary artery. After 10 days of support, the patient demonstrated sufficient cardiac reserve to allow elective removal of the pump at the bedside. He she later returned to work, resumed normal activity, and survived for 6 years with good cardiac function before dying in an auto accident. In 1969, in an event that will be discussed later in this chapter, Cooley implanted the world's first TAH to great acclaim. Despite this landmark event, effective long-term total heart replacement proved to be an elusive goal over the ensuing decades.

By the early 1970s, the complexities of immunosuppressive therapy led to waning enthusiasm for cardiac transplantation and associated MCS technology. However, research and development efforts focused on VAD therapy were continued steadily and quietly within a selected group of institutions. With support from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and in collaboration with Boston-based Thermo Cardiosystems, physicians at the Texas Heart Institute began development of an abdominally positioned, pneumatically driven, pulsatile-flow LVAD. Twenty-two patients were supported by the Model 7 abdominal LVAD, including the first documented mechanical "bridge" to cardiac transplantation, performed in 1978.<sup>17</sup> The introduction of cyclosporine in the 1980s eventually led to renewed widespread interest in the field of transplantation and reestablished a meaningful clinical role for MCS technology. Ongoing research efforts to

develop pumps capable of long-term support ultimately led to the HeartMate Implantable Pneumatic pump (Thoratec Corp; Pleasanton, CA), which became the first implantable device to be approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a bridge to transplantation (BTT). <sup>18,19</sup> An electrically powered, percutaneously vented adaptation of this device, the HeartMate Extended Vented Electric (XVE) LVAD, was spawned directly by these research efforts. Upon its inaugural implantation in 1991, it became the first pump to be managed in the outpatient setting. <sup>20</sup>

Simultaneously, research efforts were engaged in the design of a completely different mechanism. The concept of extended nonpulsatile support was inspired by anecdotal reports concerning the use of the extracorporeal BioMedicus centrifugal-force pump (Medtronic; Minneapolis, MN) as both a temporary LVAD and an extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO). This led to a series of experimental studies that were performed by the senior author of this chapter (OHF) in the Texas Heart Institute laboratories throughout the 1980s. As a result of these efforts (and in collaboration with engineer Richard Wampler) the Hemopump, a small catheter-based, axial-flow device, was developed and successfully implanted in 1988, demonstrating the efficacy and safety of high-speed continuousflow (CF) support<sup>21</sup> (Fig. 62-2). Also during this period, an association between Texas Heart Institute investigators and researcher Robert Jarvik led to the development of a longterm implantable CF pump that could be placed directly into the left ventricle.<sup>22</sup> The Jarvik 2000 VAD (Jarvik Heart, Inc.; New York, NY) was unique in its utilization of bloodwashed bearings (previously thought to be biologically incompatible with the vascular system) and validated the clinical feasibility of axial-based CF pumps<sup>23</sup> (Fig. 62-3). Meanwhile, the clinical success of the Hemopump led the Nimbus Company (later absorbed by Thoratec) to develop

the HeartMate II, another implantable axial-flow device, which would eventually become the most commonly used LVAD worldwide. A final step in the development of contemporary MCS systems occurred in 1994, when collaboration between Frazier, Wampler, and financier Robert Fine led to the development of a novel CF design. Originally produced by Kriton Medical, Inc. (and later purchased by HeartWare, Inc., Framingham, MA), the HeartWare HVAD utilizes a magnetically levitated, centrifugal-flow design that permits intrapericardial placement of the discoid-shaped pump housing and can function as both a right- and left-sided VAD.<sup>24</sup> Within the first decade of the new millennium, all three pumps—the Jarvik 2000, the HeartMate II, and the HeartWare HVAD—saw clinical use.

Increasingly sophisticated technology and improving clinical reliability gradually led MCS to shift from an experimental endeavor to a viable treatment option. The Randomized Evaluation of Mechanical Assistance for the Treatment of Congestive Heart Failure (REMATCH) trial was designed to compare outcomes between HF patients treated with the HeartMate XVE and those treated with medical therapy alone. Completed in 2001, REMATCH investigators demonstrated a nearly 50% reduction in mortality among patients with LVAD support (Fig. 62-4). By providing the first statistical evidence of a survival benefit, this study remains a landmark in the advancement of MCS therapy. Following the success of REMATCH, the HeartMate II soon became the first CF device to be approved by the FDA for both BTT indications (in 2007) and for use in patients ineligible for transplantation (2009).<sup>25,26</sup> The HeartWare HVAD was granted BTT status after the release of the results of the ADVANCE trial in 2010, and it is expected to receive broader approval in the near future.<sup>27</sup> With more pumps and

newer designs in the pipeline, options for MCS continue to grow with ever-improving outcomes.

# PULSATILE VERSUS NONPULSATILE FLOW

A critical issue in the field of MCS is the physical mechanism by which flow is created. Quite logically, early efforts in device therapy sought to mimic nature's model by designing pulsatile systems. Generations of devices have utilized pneumatic compression systems, hydraulic actuators, and pusher plate technology to allow repetitive filling and forceful ejection of blood from a ventricular collection chamber. However, the engineering challenges associated with matching the simplicity and reliability of the human heart—which beats more than 40 million times each year—have been considerable.

A chief cause of late pulsatile-device failure is mechanical wear, which results from the presence of complex moving components and multiple points of contact. For example, although the HeartMate XVE represented a significant step forward, it had a relatively predictable lifespan, with a high failure rate between the first and second years of use, and few of these devices survived for more than 2 years<sup>28</sup> (Fig. 62-5). Pulsatility also requires a number of disadvantageous design elements to accommodate the mechanics of operation. Pneumatic systems use tunneled drivelines to communicate with an external compressor responsible for delivering (and withdrawing) pressurized air. Pusher-plate systems (such as that used for the XVE) require a mechanism to allow external venting and aspiration of air displaced by the cyclic actuation of the pump. As a result of these inescapable challenges, pulsatile pumps are generally large, complex, and vulnerable to wear.

Temporary CF technology was first adopted by Gibbon, who employed roller pumps in the design of his machine that first enabled CPB support during surgery. 10 However, early efforts to develop long-term MCS pumps focused on pulsatile blood flow to replicate natural physiology. The eventual development of CF LVADs was largely due to their associated engineering advantages, and both experimental and clinical studies quickly documented the physiologic tolerance of nonpulsatility. The technical superiority of CF devices was definitively shown in the HeartMate II Destination Therapy (DT) trial,<sup>26</sup> which documented improved adverse event profiles, hospital readmission rates, functional capacity, and overall survival when compared with the HeartMate XVE over a 2-year period (Table 62-1; Fig. 62-6). The widespread use and long-term efficacy of CF devices has further confirmed the important contribution of continuous blood-flow technology to MCS.

Whereas the success of CF devices has proven the body's tolerance of nonpulsatile blood flow, this technology has created a new physiology, the full effects of which are not yet known. Multiple studies have shown an association between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and the loss of pulsatility. Histologic examination of aortic tissue samples have revealed unanticipated degeneration of smooth muscle and elastic fibers in patients supported by CF devices. Ultrasonographic studies have further revealed stasis and thrombus formation representing potential sources of thromboembolism within the carotid bulb and aortic valve cusps of selected patients with nonpulsatile devices. These issues present a

# CURRENT OPTIONS FOR MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY SUPPORT

Currently, device therapy involves a wide variety of options, obtainable through federally approved indications or investigational studies. The pumps differ in a number of important ways, including the duration of support permitted, approach to access, mechanisms of flow, and output capabilities. The most frequently used pumps and selected other devices of interest—notably all CF designs—are discussed below. A more thorough listing of currently available devices is provided in Table 62-2.

#### **ECMO**

Oxygenation of the blood by a membrane oxygenator can be achieved through the use of either veno-venous (VV) or veno-arterial (VA) ECMO. The VV option is typically used for the management of isolated respiratory failure, and it relies on the function of the native heart for systemic circulation of oxygenated blood. In contrast, through an arterial return cannula, VA ECMO allows complete cardiopulmonary support, similar to that provided by CPB. Cannulation may be central or peripheral, rendering ECMO particularly useful in both emergent and intraoperative situations. It is generally limited to periods of short-term support (measured in days).

# Paracorporeal and Percutaneous Devices

A subset of devices can be inserted percutaneously or involve extracorporeal pumping components. Recent studies have shown a dramatic increase in the utilization of these short-term devices, 32 which are typically used for temporary MCS in the setting of acute cardiogenic or postcardiotomy shock. The CentriMag (Thoratec Corp.) is an extracorporeal VAD utilizing a magnetically levitated centrifugal flow impeller that can provide both right- and left-sided support (Fig. 62-7a). Access is typically gained via centrally placed CPB cannulas that can be tunneled to allow temporary chest closure. Capable of flows reaching 10 L/min, the CentriMag can also accommodate an oxygenator within the pumping circuit, permitting full cardiopulmonary support. The device is generally used for days to weeks, but support periods exceeding 30 days have been reported.33

The TandemHeart Percutaneous Ventricular Assist Device (pVAD) (CardiacAssist Inc.; Pittsburgh, PA) is a percutaneous device that functions as a left atriofemoral bypass. Inserted under fluoroscopic guidance, the TandemHeart has a transseptal cannula that transfers oxygenated blood from the heart to an extracorporeal, magnetically driven, centrifugal flow pump mounted on the thigh.

bearing system, the TandemHeart can provide the femoral artery with return flows reaching 4 L/min.  $^{34}$ 

The Impella (Abiomed; Danvers, MA) is a platform of devices based upon a catheter-mounted microaxial design conceptually similar to that of the original Hemopump (Fig. 62-7b). A percutaneous arterial catheter serves as a power source and flow conduit for the pump, and left-sided support is provided in a retrograde fashion across the aortic valve. With a maximal diameter of just 12 F (4 mm), various adaptations of the device allow flows ranging from 2.5 to 5 L/min. A right-sided version, the Impella RP, delivers antegrade flow from the inferior vena cava to the pulmonary artery. It recently became the first percutaneous device approved by the FDA for right ventricular (RV) support.<sup>35</sup>

# Implantable Continuous-Flow LVADs (FDA-Approved)

The HeartMate II axial-flow device is the most widely used LVAD worldwide, with more than 15,000 implants to date (Fig. 62-8a). The pump's electromagnetic motor powers a single hydrodynamically suspended impeller operating at speeds between 6000 and 15,000 rpm (although clinical operating ranges are traditionally much smaller), and capable of flows greater than 10 L/min. Most often implanted via median sternotomy, the sintered titanium pump inlet is placed within the left ventricle with an outflow graft anastomosed to the aorta. A percutaneous driveline communicates with the remainder of the system: an external device controller and two portable batteries.

(B) The Impella CP is a catheter-based pump designed to be positioned across the aortic valve and capable of producing flows as high as 4 L/min. (Reproduced with permission from ABIOMED, Inc.)

The HeartWare HVAD has a centrifugal-flow design, with a smaller and more compact profile than the HeartMate II (145 vs 375 g, respectively), integrating the ventricular inlet with the pump housing (Fig. 62-8b). The impeller is suspended via a combination of magnetic and hydrodynamic forces, and it operates at speeds ranging from 1800 to 4000 rpm, again with flows as high as 10 L/min. The flat surface of the

pump body allows intrapericardial positioning and serves as an advantage for right-sided use. Like the HeartMate II, the HVAD relies on external batteries and a controller module connected to the patient by a percutaneous driveline.

A number of additional devices remain in various stages of investigational study in the United States and are likely to be more widely available in the coming years. On the

whole, newer-generation pumps are being designed to produce excellent performance while offering a smaller profile, thus simplifying implantation and expanding potential applications to include smaller-framed and pediatric populations (Fig. 62-8c). TAH technology is discussed later in this chapter.

#### **GOALS OF THERAPY**

Before device implantation, treatment teams must designate an intended goal of therapy. Traditional categories of strategic intent represent the evolution of MCS. Originally, devices were conceived as temporizing measures while the patient awaited a transplant. The eventual inclusion of transplantineligible patients for device consideration required a new and separate indication, resulting in the somewhat dichotomous framework in use today. Ideally, the decision to seek device therapy should be based on the need for mechanical support rather than being indirectly affected by the patient's transplant listing status. However, the decision currently serves a critical purpose in regard to patient and device selection, timing of intervention, regulatory oversight, and data acquisition. Clinical trials aimed at seeking device approval have traditionally been designed on this model. Likewise, the United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) uses the indicated strategy for device therapy to establish a given patient's eligibility for treatment. The categories are a part of the MCS lexicon and warrant inclusion here.

# Bridge to Transplantation

The original intention for MCS was to provide a "bridge" to eventual cardiac transplantation for patients awaiting a suitable donor organ. Unpredictable waitlist times and a frequently tenuous clinical condition make these patients particularly vulnerable to deterioration while awaiting a transplant. The decision to seek a BTT strategy requires consideration of estimated waitlist times, the potential for a decline in clinical status before transplantation, the patient's quality of life, and the risk of death while on the waiting list. Progressively longer waitlist times throughout the United States have resulted in the relatively standard use of BTT for the treatment of transplant-eligible patients with end-stage HF.36 Whereas BTT remains the most common implant strategy for MCS (nearly 65% of these patients are designated as transplant candidates), the percentage of patients officially listed for a transplant at the time of device implantation has steadily declined, now totaling just 21.7%.<sup>37</sup>

# **Destination Therapy**

Patients with end-stage HF who are not eligible for transplantation may benefit from MCS as a means to prolong or improve the quality of their life. The designation of destination therapy (DT) originates from the REMATCH trial, in

which transplant-ineligible patients supported by MCS had better outcomes than patients supported by medical therapy alone. Through this designation, patients with systemic life-threatening illnesses, malignancies, fixed pulmonary hypertension, advanced age, and morbid obesity may benefit from device therapy regardless of their transplant listing status. Designation as DT does not imply a limitation on the timeframe for treatment, as uninterrupted CF support surpassing 9 years has been reported. Over the past 7 years, the proportion of patients categorized as DT candidates at the time of implantation has steadily increased from 14.7 to 41.6%—likely as a result of increased access to FDA-approved devices for DT, as well as recognition of the possibility of reassessing the transplant status throughout the period of device support.

### **Bridge to Decision**

The use of long-term MCS in the setting of acute hemodynamic collapse or active decompensation results in comparatively poor outcomes.<sup>37</sup> Short-term MCS offers the advantage of rapid and relatively less invasive access to device therapy while allowing stabilization of the patient and consideration of long-term device candidacy. Thus, patients with a myocardial infarction, myocarditis, acute cardiogenic shock, or unsuccessful percutaneous intervention can be quickly transitioned to support in anticipation of recovery, decline, or optimization before the initiation of long-term MCS.

# Myocardial Reconditioning

In a selected subset of patients, a distinct improvement in ventricular function has allowed device weaning and (occasionally) deactivation. Beginning in the 1990s, studies have revealed histologic and clinical evidence of myocardial rehabilitation after periods of both pulsatile and CF device support.<sup>38-40</sup> Often labeled a "bridge to recovery," this phenomenon is perhaps better described as a return to medical HF therapy. A number of institutions have proposed deviceweaning strategies, ranging from aggressive medical therapy using high-dose beta blockade to mechanical offloading and gradual reconditioning of the heart through systematic titration of pump speeds. 41-43 Despite promising reports, only a small percentage of patients have successfully experienced this outcome. Although little is known with certainty regarding the precise variables that govern the pace and degree of myocardial response, the potential for de-escalation of therapy supports an aggressive pursuit of weaning strategies in all patients who require device support.

# Fluidity of Implantation Strategy

It is important to recognize that these designations apply only to the stated goal at the time of device implantation. Whereas regulatory guidelines mandate a proposed goal of therapy, the available choices do not reflect the reality that a patient's clinical status and transplant candidacy may change during periods of mechanical support. Although some patients may have a deteriorating clinical status or develop unexpected contraindications to transplantation, other patients—such as those with preoperative "fixed" pulmonary hypertension—may experience an improvement in conditions that originally precluded transplant listing. 44,45 The dynamic nature of device strategy is represented in reported device usage statistics, in that nearly 26% of patients initially listed for BTT were no longer listed at 1 year, and that number rose to 43.5% by 24 months. Similarly, nearly 15% of patients designated for DT at the time of device implantation were deemed eligible for transplantation by 12 months. 46 Frequent reappraisal and modification of treatment strategies corresponding to clinical status are essential for successful MCS outcomes.

#### INDICATIONS FOR DEVICE SUPPORT

Optimal strategies and indications for the initiation of MCS remain subjects of active investigation. Traditional hemodynamic parameters for device support continue to surface in the literature; although not absolute, these variables include blood pressure (BP) < 80 mm Hg, mean arterial pressure (MAP) < 65 mm Hg, cardiac index < 2 L/min/m<sup>2</sup>, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) > 20 mm Hg.<sup>47</sup> Strict following of hemodynamic markers can be misleading, however, as patients may present not just in acute cardiogenic shock but also with a more insidious manifestation of congestive HF. In 2013, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) proposed a thorough and broad-ranging compilation of recommendations for the use of MCS.<sup>36</sup> Although many of the proposed guidelines are limited by the relative weakness of available supporting evidence, they represent the most comprehensive and ambitious summary of consensus opinion,

and underscore the multiorgan and multidisciplinary approach to device candidacy.

In 2013, the American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) and American Heart Association (AHA) released a broad slate of guidelines for the management of HF.<sup>4</sup> The report endorsed the use of an alternative to the traditional New York Heart Association (NYHA) staging system, emphasizing disease-specific markers rather than patient-specific symptoms (Table 62-3). The guidelines support the use of durable MCS in patients with so-called Stage D HF (refractory disease requiring specialized interventions) with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) as a means to both prolong survival and BTT. Although the authors refrain from further characterizing patient selection criteria, the guidelines do emphasize the perceived importance of refractory disease, reduced EF, and severe symptomatology.

In 2013, CMS released updated eligibility criteria for the use of MCS as DT in Medicare beneficiaries. 48 More specific than the ACCF/AHA guidelines, the federal standards allow the use of DT only for patients with end-stage HF (NYHA class IV) who are deemed ineligible for transplantation at the time of device implantation and who meet each of the following conditions: (a) failure to respond to optimal medical management for 45 of the last 60 days, balloon pump dependence for 7 days, or IV inotrope dependence for 14 days; (b) LVEF < 25%; and (c) measured peak oxygen consumption of <14 mL/kg/min or an inability to perform the test. The federal requirements for BTT designation are somewhat broader, mandating only that patients be listed for transplantation by an approved transplant center. However, use of a device for any purpose is permitted only if that specific device has been granted FDA approval for the chosen therapeutic goal.

The Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) database was established in 2008 to facilitate the growth of MCS and improve patient outcomes. Paired with the registry's first report was a proposal

for a new system of classifying patients with advanced HF.<sup>49</sup> Seven clinical profiles were designed to establish an enhanced method for characterizing patients requiring device therapy (Table 62-4). These profiles represent a stratification of patients diagnosed with advanced HF—defined as NYHA class III and IV symptoms despite optimal therapy. By documenting the profiles of patients undergoing device implantation, INTER-MACS provides an opportunity to evaluate data and trends concerning surgical risks and indications. Clinical practice has indeed shifted since the introduction of this system, most notably through de-escalation of the preoperative clinical profile. Whereas more than 60% of patients who received device implants before 2011 were listed as having INTERMACS 1 or 2 status, the proportion of patients classified as having level 3 status has steadily increased, now representing nearly a third of all who receive implants.<sup>8,50</sup> Indications and guidelines continue to evolve, but these results illustrate a clear trend in the management of HF toward intervening during periods of reduced clinical acuity.

### CONTRAINDICATIONS TO **DEVICE SUPPORT**

Relative contraindications to device therapy include irreversible major end-organ dysfunction, severe hemodynamic instability, profound coagulopathy, complex congenital

anomalies, and restrictive heart disease with decreased ventricular dimensions. Because successful outcomes have nevertheless been reported in these populations, decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis in order to weigh the potential risks and benefits of intervention.<sup>51,52</sup> Surgery should be deferred in the presence of active infection or bacteremia to minimize the risk of bacterial device seeding; current recommendations suggest a minimum of 5 days of culturedocumented clearance from infection.<sup>36</sup>

#### PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION

Once potential candidacy for device support has been determined, a thorough appraisal of perioperative risk is warranted. If at all possible, implantation of long-term MCS device should be performed electively, not under emergent circumstances. Identification of preoperative risk factors and treatment of reversible comorbidities can greatly improve patient outcomes.

Due to the importance of proper patient selection, efforts to predict early mortality after LVAD implantation have been a consistent theme in MCS research. During the era of pulsatile LVADs, several risk-evaluation scoring systems were developed with variable predictive utility. One of the most widely used of these scales, the Leitz-Miller destination therapy risk score (DTRS), was derived from a cohort of over

300 HeartMate XVE patients and incorporated 9 weighted variables to estimate 90-day in-hospital mortality.<sup>53</sup> When systematically tested in a CF LVAD population; however, DTRS was found to provide only modest discriminatory value.<sup>54</sup> In contrast, the Model of End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) has been shown to be a predictor of adverse events after implantation of both pulsatile and CF LVADs. 55 Utilizing only the creatinine level, total bilirubin level, and international normalized ratio (INR), the MELD score (and later the anticoagulation-compatible MELD-XI score) was found to correlate with overall and postoperative survival.<sup>56</sup> More recently, a global risk-assessment scale was developed using only CF data culled from the HeartMate II clinical trials database. The HeartMate II multivariable risk score (HMRS) utilizes five variables—patient age, albumin level, creatinine level, INR, and implanting center volume—to predict 90-day postoperative mortality<sup>57</sup> (Table 62-5). While similar to MELD in its direct comparison of predictive results, HMRS is more specifically designed for HF patients and may offer a modest benefit in outcome discrimination.<sup>58</sup> To date, no risk-assessment scale has shown absolute superiority in preoperative risk stratification, but the available models do emphasize the importance of preoperative optimization of overall end-organ function.

# **Operative Risk**

As with any proposed cardiothoracic procedure, the surgical complexity of each case must be carefully addressed early in the evaluation process. Unfavorable anatomical scenarios—such as a history of previous sternotomies, congenital anomalies, or heavily calcified anastomotic sites—are common in

this patient population and significantly escalate operative risk.

The utility of concomitant cardiac and valvular procedures is poorly understood and remains controversial. Whereas some studies have suggested that concurrent procedures are associated with diminished overall survival, consensus opinion does support intervention in specific situations.36,59,60 Native aortic insufficiency has been shown not only to adversely affect the performance of CF pumps but also to speed the progression of valvular incompetence. 61 Although clinical practice varies, ISHLT guidelines suggest concurrent intervention for regurgitation deemed moderate or greater.36 The presence of a mechanical prosthesis entails a prohibitive risk of thromboembolic complications and warrants surgical exclusion through ligation of the LV outflow tract, supravalvular patch closure, or a placement of a felt sandwich plug. 62-65 Tricuspid regurgitation has been implicated in the development of postoperative right-sided HF (RHF), and guidelines generally support intervention—either replacement or ring repair—for disease classified as moderate or greater. 36,66-68 The presence of mitral regurgitation (MR) does not typically necessitate surgical intervention at the time of device implantation. Whereas MR is common in patients with end-stage HF, this finding is often the result of annular distortion secondary to dilation of the left ventricle and typically improves with mechanical decompression and offloading.<sup>69</sup> Due to an increased risk for right-to-left shunting, atrial septal defects and patent foramen ovale (PFO) should be closed at the time of implant.<sup>70</sup> Unmasking of a previously undetected PFO has been reported after mechanical unloading of the left side of the heart, and this defect must be surgically or endovascularly repaired if systemic postoperative hypoxemia occurs.<sup>69,71</sup>

# **End-Organ Function**

The presence of multiple medical comorbidities is a common finding in patients with end-stage HF and an ever-present challenge in the surgical management of the disease. Permanent, life-threatening comorbidities (such as preoperative dialysis dependence) are often associated with excessive perioperative risks and frequently preclude eligibility for MCS. However, improvement in end-organ function has been documented after periods of device support. Preoperative determination of the severity of end-organ disease is a critical process, and it relies on the collective clinical judgment of the multidisciplinary treatment team.

Renal dysfunction, specifically, is strongly associated with poor outcomes after device implantation.<sup>76,77</sup> As a result, patients who require chronic preoperative dialysis are generally excluded from implantable MCS consideration. Additionally, multiple studies have shown a decline in post-operative survival associated with deranged markers of liver function.<sup>78,79</sup> While acute cardiogenic liver injury can be stabilized, elevations in bilirubin levels, aminotransferase levels, and INR warrant further workup and evaluation. Preoperative mechanical ventilation has been shown to be associated with postoperative respiratory failure, RV failure, and

increased mortality.<sup>80</sup> An assessment of pulmonary reserve is often limited by severe cardiac dysfunction, and no specific pulmonary function criteria have been formally established for device exclusion. Impaired cognitive function or a recent history of stroke obligates a thorough neurologic and cognitive examination. Patients with significant residual deficits should undergo an occupational therapy evaluation to determine whether they possess sufficient physical dexterity to manipulate an MCS device independently.

### Right Ventricular Function

Prevention and treatment of RV dysfunction is a significant challenge in the field of MCS, and postoperative RHF has long been associated with poor clinical outcomes. 37,81,82 Identification of patients at risk for RHF provides an opportunity for implementation of preoperative optimization strategies and enhanced surgical preparedness. However, methods developed thus far to predict RHF after LVAD implantation have been largely based on experience with pulsatile devices and have proven inconsistent, likely due to the variety of clinical definitions, variables, and treatment strategies. 83-86

Despite the complex pathophysiology underlying this disease process, several recent studies have significantly improved our understanding of variables that predispose to RV dysfunction. In a retrospective analysis of the HeartMate II BTT trial, Kormos and colleagues<sup>87</sup> sought to identify risk factors for the development of postoperative RHF in a CF LVAD population. That study specifically identified preoperative ventilator support, an increased central venous pressure (CVP) and CVP/PCWP ratio, a decreased RV stroke work index, and elevated white blood cell and blood urea nitrogen values as significant predictors of RHF. Echocardiographic parameters have also been suggested as tools for assessing the risk of RHF after LVAD implantation. Ultrasonographic studies have implicated reduced free-wall strain, RV-to-LV diameter ratios, severity of tricuspid regurgitation, and RV EF as predictors of right-sided heart dysfunction.<sup>88-91</sup> Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania recently developed a risk-stratification tool to assess the preoperative likelihood for tolerance of univentricular support. 92 Although limited by its size, patient selection, and single-center design, the study identified preoperative tachycardia, elevated CVP, ventilator support, RV dysfunction, and tricuspid regurgitation as predictors of the need for biventricular support.

Thus, whereas the specific variables that may predispose patients to RHF after LVAD implantation remain unclear, certain principles have emerged to help guide patient selection and management. A consistent theme throughout the majority of these studies is an association between predictors of RHF and predictors of overall mortality. Sicker patients—with preoperative evidence of end-organ dysfunction, hemodynamic instability, and impaired RV mechanics—are especially vulnerable to RHF after LVAD implantation. Thoughtful evaluation and preoperative consideration of these risks are paramount in surgical planning.

# Multidisciplinary Assessment/Social Evaluation

Due to the comprehensive nature of device therapy and the commitment required for successful outcomes, candidates for MCS must undergo a comprehensive multidisciplinary assessment. Preoperative nutritional status should be evaluated and optimized, as studies have shown an association between cachexia and perioperative mortality rates. 95,96 A history of psychiatric illness should cause significant concern and warrants a thorough evaluation of competency and ability to adhere consistently to therapy. Routine psychosocial evaluation should be performed by qualified healthcare personnel to explore available personal, social, vocational, financial, and environmental support systems. Advanced patient age alone should not preclude device therapy. 97 Cases should be reviewed on an individual basis by a multidisciplinary committee to ensure that all concerns are addressed before surgery.

#### **DEVICE SELECTION**

Appropriate device selection is determined by a number of factors, including the patient's overall clinical condition, the indication for MCS, the proposed goal of device therapy, and relevant patient-specific considerations.

Patients with an unstable condition or acute decompensation are often best served by short-term devices that are less invasive, faster to place, and less expensive than fully implantable pumps. As a reliable and historically familiar option, VA ECMO is the procedure of choice for emergent situations in many institutions worldwide. Peripheral cannulation may be performed at the bedside, in the catheterization lab, or in the operating theater, and the presence of an oxygenator allows for full cardiopulmonary support for a period of days to weeks. Catheter-based LVADs such as the Impella and TandemHeart are used with increasing frequency for short-term LV support, particularly after high-risk coronary interventions.<sup>32</sup> These percutaneous devices can provide temporary support without the need for surgical access, but they are susceptible to hemolysis and positional disruption, and their use is typically limited to 1 to 2 weeks. For patients for whom more robust flows are required or percutaneous measures have failed, the CentriMag is the most frequently used temporary option. Cannulation is similar to that performed for routine CPB, and the device can be used for temporary uni- or biventricular support for up to 1 month.

Fully implantable CF LVADs are the devices of choice for patients who require long-term MCS and whose condition is stable enough to permit major surgery. Of the various options, the HeartMate II LVAD and the HeartWare HVAD are the most commonly used devices. Although they function in a similar manner, the choice between these pumps is based on factors ranging from anatomical concerns to institutional availability. In the United States, the CMS strictly mandates preoperative designation of patients as either BTT or DT candidates. Despite the fluid nature

of these preimplant strategies, the HeartMate II remains the only device approved by the FDA for use in both BTT and DT patients. The HVAD, by contrast, is currently approved only for BTT in the United States, and clinical trials seeking DT approval are currently underway. No study has yet shown either pump to be superior to the other. Although the advent of smaller CF pumps has lessened the anatomical challenge of implantation, patient body habitus remains an important consideration. For example, the intrapericardial position of the HVAD makes the HeartWare device particularly appealing for smaller-framed patients.

For patients with biventricular HF, the decision to pursue uni- or biventricular MCS greatly affects the available treatment options. For patients with mild-to-moderate RHF, a CF LVAD with temporary right-sided support may be sufficient to allow RV reconditioning. In the event of failed temporary support or severe biventricular disease, dual (right and left) CF devices may be used with relative success despite the logistical complexities associated with multiple controllers and batteries. The pulsatile SynCardia TAH (SynCardia Systems; Tucson, AZ) currently is the only FDA-approved option for implantable biventricular support in patients awaiting transplantation. Although the Syncardia requires considerable intrathoracic volume displacement, it allows mobility and outpatient management by means of a portable pneumatic driver. The continued development of a fully implantable CF TAH is underway and will be discussed later in this chapter.

#### **SURGICAL TECHNIQUE**

As experience with device implantation has grown, surgical techniques have evolved to reflect lessons learned. Early in the development of LVADs, apical positioning of the inlet cannula was advocated, so as to take advantage of the longest measured span within the left ventricle. This positioning, however, often creates unfavorable angulation of the inlet toward the interventricular septum, resulting in arrhythmogenesis and mechanical obstruction of the inlet after a reduction in the LV end-diastolic dimension. Over time, a number of alternative implant strategies have been devised, ranging from a thoracotomy to subcostal incisions and from anterior to lateral pump positions. 98-100 Surgeons at our institution favor a method designed to produce a parallel orientation between the inlet cannula and the interventricular septum by placing the inlet along the diaphragmatic surface of the heart. 101,102 Although it deviates from traditional technique, this method eliminates the need for a preperitoneal pump pocket and creates a more geometrically advantageous alignment.

Whereas the technique described is specifically intended for the HeartMate II, most of the procedure is indistinguishable from implantation of other CF LVADs. Differences involving the HeartWare HVAD—the second most commonly used device worldwide—will be addressed as necessary. Essential components of the procedure include (1) positioning of the inlet cannula along the diaphragmatic aspect of the left ventricle; (2) transdiaphragmatic positioning of the HeartMate II pump housing; (3) proper sizing of the outflow graft to ensure an optimal pump position and avoidance of kinking; (4) thorough de-airing of the heart and pump circuit; and (5) titration of pump speeds under echocardiographic guidance to optimize heart function.

A vertical midline incision is made, followed by a 6-cm subxiphoid extension. A standard sternotomy is then performed with the ratchet of the sternal retractor oriented toward the patient's head to provide adequate inferior exposure. The pericardium is opened in the midline and divided along the length of the diaphragm. Both pleural cavities are entered to assist with positioning of both the pump and outflow conduit. The anterior border of the diaphragm is then incised from the midline to the apex of the heart, permitting entrance into the peritoneal cavity and adequate space for introducing the pump (Fig. 62-9a). A point of entry for the inlet cannula to traverse the diaphragm is selected to correspond with the diaphragmatic surface of the left ventricle and is marked with an electrocautery.

After systemic heparinization is achieved, the ascending aorta is cannulated distally, with consideration for potential future reoperation and transplantation. Venous cannulation is typically achieved by using a dual-stage cannula in the right atrial appendage, except in cases for which a concomitant procedure is planned—such as a tricuspid valve repair or PFO—when bicaval cannulation is preferred. In a reoperative sternotomy, the femoral vessels should be exposed to allow immediate cannulation if mediastinal dissection results in hemodynamic instability.

CPB is then initiated, and the LV apex is brought out of the chest and stabilized with an off-pump suction-cup stabilizer. For inlet placement along the diaphragmatic surface, identification of the appropriate ventriculotomy site is crucial to avoid disruption of the papillary muscles and allow the inlet to lie parallel to the interventricular septum along the short axis of the left ventricle. This is accomplished by selecting a point approximately one-third of the distance from the apex to the base of the heart (thus, anterior to the origin of the papillary muscles), with the medial edge of the sewing ring placed 0.5 to 1 cm lateral to the posterior descending artery. A coring knife—typically provided by the device manufacturer—is used to open the ventricle, with care to stay parallel to the septum and follow posteriorly in the direction of the mitral valve. The ventricular cavity is then thoroughly inspected for evidence of thrombus or potentially obstructive trabeculae.

To secure the Silastic inflow cuff of the HeartMate II, 12 braided polyester full-thickness sutures are placed circumferentially around the ventriculotomy site in a horizontal mattress fashion with broad interlocking felt pledgets. The sutures are passed through the felt sewing ring of the inflow cuff, which is then lowered into position and secured. Hemostasis around the inflow is bolstered by placing a full-thickness purse-string stitch through the pledgeted ring, using a large-caliber monofilament suture (Fig. 62-9b). The HeartWare HVAD utilizes a specialized sewing ring equipped with a locking mechanism to secure the pump in place. The HVAD sewing ring is typically placed before the ventricle is cored,

(C) Transdiaphragmatic positioning of the HeartMate II inflow cannula. (D) Anastomosis of the outflow graft to the ascending aorta, aided by a partial occluding vascular clamp. (E) Final alignment of the pump and outflow conduit. The pump housing lies beneath the diaphragm, and the outflow graft courses toward the right side of the chest. Introduction of a 19-gauge needle permits de-airing of the system.

and the ring is seated with a similar series of horizontal mattress sutures.

Next, the diaphragmatic myotomy—ample enough to admit two fingers—is completed at the previously marked location, and the pump is brought into the field after being prepared and primed on a separate table. The inlet cannula is guided through the diaphragm, inserted within the Silastic ring, and finally secured in place with two ratcheting cable ties (Fig. 62-9c). The pump housing is pulled into the abdomen until the heart lies flush with the diaphragm, and the pump is positioned above the left lobe of the liver. To protect the bowel, the body of the pump is wrapped in available omentum. The discoid shape of the HeartWare HVAD allows intrapericardial pump placement. Although the inlet is placed along the diaphragmatic aspect of the ventricle, entrance into the abdomen is not required.

Next, attention is turned to the outflow graft, which is allowed to fill, then is measured and cut in beveled fashion, with enough length to produce a gentle curve toward the right side of the chest but without excessive redundancy that might lead to kinking. After placement of a partial occluding clamp along the ascending aorta, an aortotomy is created along the anterolateral surface by sequentially firing a 4.4-mm punch. The outflow-graft anastomosis is performed in an end-to-side fashion with continuous 5-0 polypropylene suture (Fig. 62-9d). The partial occluding clamp is then removed, and the graft is de-aired while backflow is prevented by an occlusive vascular clamp.

The driveline exit site is identified two fingerbreadths below the right subcostal margin within the mid-clavicular line. A skin punch allows the introduction of a tunneling device, which is then passed behind the right rectus muscle, anteriorly to the posterior rectus sheath. The driveline is withdrawn with the tunneling device, cleaned, and connected to the device controller, with care to loop the velour-coated portion of the lead within the patient's body, as studies have shown that preservation of the velour-silicone interface beneath the level of the skin is associated with a decreased incidence of driveline infections. <sup>103</sup>

After thorough de-airing, the pump is started at its lowest setting (6000 rpm for the HeartMate II; 1800 rpm for the HeartWare HVAD) with a venting needle in the highest point of the outflow graft (Fig. 62-9e). CPB flows are gradually decreased while the pump speed is adjusted under transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) guidance to optimize the chamber size, position of the interventricular septum, degree of MR, and RV function.

Protamine is administered, the cannulas are removed, and drains are placed in the mediastinum and pleural spaces. The bare portion of the outflow graft is covered with a 20-mm-diameter ringed Gore-Tex graft (Gore Medical, Newark, DE) to avoid kinking and damage during future sternal reentry. The defect in the diaphragm is partially reapproximated, and the sternum and soft tissues are closed in the standard fashion. If the patient has excessive bleeding related to severe coagulopathy, temporary chest closure may be advisable to allow correction and stabilization before delayed sternal closure is attempted. <sup>104</sup>

### **POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT**

Diligent and comprehensive patient care is essential for successful MCS outcomes, and proper management begins before surgery. As described earlier, careful patient selection is paramount, as is prompt identification of the most appropriate opportunity for device implantation. To minimize surgical risks, particular emphasis should be placed on the preoperative optimization of end-organ function, reversal of coagulation imbalances, correction of malnutrition, and eradication of preexisting infection. Device recipients with decompensated clinical profiles (INTERMACS levels 1 and 2) are known to experience worse outcomes than patients whose condition is comparatively stable.<sup>37</sup> As a result, aggressive medical management, intraaortic balloon therapy, or temporary device support is often warranted to improve the patient's hemodynamic condition before surgery. Careful planning should also include the recognition of patient-specific risks—such as the potential need for RV support—to avoid lengthy delays in the recognition and treatment of postoperative complications.

Intraoperative measures are also crucial for preventing postoperative complications. In addition to meticulous surgical technique and adequate hemostasis, judicious blood-product administration minimizes the risk of volume overload and RV failure. In the setting of profound coagulopathy, low-dose recombinant factor VIIa (NovoSeven; Novo Nordisk, Plainsboro, NJ) and four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (Kcentra; CSL Behring GmbH, Marburg, Germany) have shown value as pharmacologic resources without causing an undue risk of device complications or thromboembolic events. <sup>105</sup>

Initial device setup is a critical process that occurs within the operating theater. After the pump is activated, power and flow recordings should be carefully monitored, and any suspected physical impediments to device performance, such as outflow kinking or cannula malpositioning, should be immediately identified and corrected. Intraoperative identification of optimal pump speed is a dynamic process that requires both direct visualization and TEE to assess ventricular chamber size, RV function, and interventricular septal position. The combination of CPB weaning, intravascular fluid shifts, vasoactive medications, and sternal closure can result in sudden and dramatic changes in cardiac function, and continual reassessment is required to maintain an appropriate balance between the patient and device.

Immediate postoperative management in the intensive care unit (ICU) requires an understanding of the delicate balance between pump flow, RV function, and intravascular volume status—often interpreted within the context of a volatile and complex hemodynamic milieu. Baseline comprehensive laboratory panels should be assessed immediately upon the patient's arrival in the ICU to assess acid-base status, coagulation markers, and hematologic reserves. Acidosis should be aggressively corrected and coagulopathy reversed with appropriate blood component resuscitation.

Arterial BP is principally controlled by vasoactive medications and intravascular fluid management, not pump speed.

The flows produced by CF LVADs operating at constant speed are highly dependent on the pressure differential across the pump. The resulting afterload sensitivity, particularly in centrifugal pump designs, requires careful BP titration to ensure sufficient output without causing excessive systemic pressures. Although optimal MAPs in this patient population remain unknown, our practice is to target a range of 60 to 80 mm Hg. Due to the reduction in pulse pressure created by CF LVADs, systemic arterial pressures are expressed as a single mean value and should be continuously monitored in the postoperative period. Noninvasive BP cuff measurements have been found to be unreliable in the setting of CF MCS and frequently underestimate systolic pressures. As a result, Doppler measurements have emerged as the gold-standard noninvasive modality. 106 The control of CVP is also of critical importance in the postoperative period, as excessive volume administration—a frequent obstacle in this patient population—can quickly lead to development of RV dysfunction.

Assessment of appropriate device function is based on system-specific parameters in conjunction with echocardiographic findings. Pump speed (rpm) and power expenditure (watts) are the only directly measured variables provided by the HeartMate II and HeartWare HVAD; estimated flow (L/min) is indirectly calculated and typically corresponds to changes in pump power. The pulsatility index (PI) is a parameter unique to the HeartMate II, and it is designed to indicate ventricular filling and function by interpreting changes in pump flow due to contraction of the left ventricle. Although optimal target levels are unknown, the PI can be expected to decline with increasing pump support. 69 The HeartWare HVAD provides continuous readings of pump speed, power, and flow, and it records values every 15 minutes, thus maintaining a retrievable data log for review of the preceding 30 days. Interpretation of these data recordings has shown a potential for predicting, diagnosing, and managing clinical events, including volume changes, RV dysfunction, and pump thrombosis. 107

Any deviation in pump data warrants immediate interrogation, including assessment of hemodynamics, volume status, heart rhythm, sources of intrathoracic compression, and ventricular dimensions. Whether emergent or elective, assessment of device function is best achieved by echocardiography focused on end-diastolic dimensions, septal positioning, valvular competence, and aortic valve opening. Systematic assessment across a range of pump speeds—"speed-change" or "ramped-speed" echo—allows optimization of maintenance pump speeds by comparing functional dynamics. The preferred frequency of these studies varies among institutions; at a minimum, it should be performed in the operating room, soon after arrival in the ICU, before hospital discharge, and any time concern is raised about the adequacy of support.

Our practice is to seek early extubation, mobilization, and resumption of nutritional support. Aggressive diuresis is typically warranted for postoperative fluid offloading, and volume status is monitored using daily weights, physical findings, and hemodynamic parameters. The patient should

be weaned from vasoactive and inotropic medications as tolerated. Lines and drains should be removed as early as possible to reduce the risk of postoperative infection, and strict aseptic technique is required for driveline dressing changes. An aggressive physical therapy regimen is initiated as early as possible, as is patient device training.

### Management of Right Ventricular Dysfunction

After LVAD implantation, outcomes are heavily dependent on the preservation of adequate RV function. Whereas RHF is most often the result of inadequate left-sided output, the initiation of LVAD support can adversely affect RV function in several ways. The sudden increase in left-sided cardiac output and venous return requires the unsupported right ventricle to respond immediately to an increased demand. Although LVAD therapy has been shown to reduce the severity of pulmonary hypertension, this resolution may not be immediate, forcing the right ventricle to pump against a relatively high-pressure system. Furthermore, interdependence between the right and left ventricles can result in the distortion of RV and septal architecture upon unloading of the LV, leading to impaired RV contractility. In this way, initiation of device support can lead to sudden demands and strains on the right ventricle to which it cannot adequately respond.

Management personnel must be vigilant in monitoring for signs of acute RHF to allow prompt and aggressive treatment. Signs of impending or evolving RV dysfunction include increasing vasopressor requirements or hemodynamic instability, elevated or rising CVP, decreased urine output, and low mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO<sub>2</sub>). In 2011, Potapov and colleagues<sup>108</sup> suggested standardized criteria for the diagnosis of RV dysfunction that included the inability to wean from CPB, or any two of the following conditions: MAP < 55 mm Hg, CVP > 16 mm Hg, SvO<sub>2</sub> < 55%, LV flow rate index < 2 L/min/m<sup>2</sup>, or significant inotropic dependence. In addition to hemodynamic markers, echocardiography should remain an essential component of the evaluation, allowing direct assessment of ventricular size, contractility, and septal positioning. Along with traditional signs of depressed right-sided heart function, the failure to maintain appropriate LVAD power consumption and flows in the absence of hypovolemia may suggest inability of the right ventricle to deliver sufficient volume to the pump inlet.

The majority of patients with RV dysfunction will require inotropic support, typically in the form of milrinone, dobutamine, isoproterenol, or epinephrine. Early and aggressive pharmacologic diuresis is essential to reduce RV preload, particularly in the setting of excessive volume loading and massive transfusion. Maintenance of sinus rhythm preserves the RV stroke volume and lessens myocardial strain. Although the results of studies have been contradictory, inhaled nitric oxide therapy appears to have utility in alleviating pulmonary vascular resistance and RV dysfunction through direct pulmonary arterial vasodilatory effects. 108,109 When all other management options have been exhausted, consideration of

mechanical right-sided support, either temporary or permanent, is warranted. 110

### **Anticoagulation**

The approach to anticoagulation in patients who require long-term MCS has not yet been standardized and varies considerably between institutions. Whereas thromboembolic complications were a significant challenge for early devices, the unique textured interior surface of the Heart-Mate XVE resulted in the development of a neointimal blood interface that effectively eliminated the need for systemic anticoagulation.111 The introduction of the Jarvik 2000, which utilized blood-washed bearings and a CF design, led to the widespread practice of systemic anticoagulation to reduce the perceived risk of pump thrombosis. 112 As a result, initial management strategies for CF devices involved a target INR of 2.5 to 3.5 before experience gained from the HeartMate II pivotal trial led to a suggested target range of 2 to 3 along with early postoperative heparin infusion and antiplatelet therapy in the form of aspirin and dipyridamole.<sup>25,113</sup>

Despite these initial recommendations, the appropriate level of anticoagulation for long-term CF support remains an area of active investigation. Studies have shown that the incidence of hemorrhagic complications is far greater than that of thrombotic events in this patient population, leading to the suggestion that a lower INR target may be appropriate.<sup>37,114</sup> Moreover, patients transitioned directly to warfarin without an early heparin bridge have been shown to experience reduced postoperative transfusion requirements without an increased risk of thrombotic complications. 115 Guidelines published by ISHLT recommend the initiation of heparin therapy on postoperative day 1, with warfarin and aspirin started by postoperative day 3 (target INR 2.0 to 3.0).36 Our institution follows an alternative protocol, preferring the early introduction of warfarin and aspirin therapy (by postoperative day 1), with heparin infusion reserved for patients in whom anticoagulation remains subtherapeutic by postoperative day 4. Target INRs for this protocol are specific to the type of device, application, and presence of concomitant cardiac pathology. Standard intraoperative heparin reversal with protamine sulfate is accepted practice in most centers.

# Biventricular Device Management

The concomitant use of a right-sided pump adds several complexities to device management. From a hemodynamic standpoint, determination of the appropriate balance between the two pumps can be difficult. Continuous-flow devices are principally governed by two variables: the speed of the rotor and the pressure difference across the device. As a result, the output produced by a CF pump operating at constant speed will reflect the volume of blood delivered to the inlet. This arrangement provides a degree of inherent automaticity that is advantageous when pumps are operated in series. Management of a biventricular system, therefore, requires identification of a right-sided pump speed that permits venous

offloading without development of pulmonary edema—a common complication of RV assistance as a result of reduced afterload established by the low-pressure pulmonary circulation. Left-sided speeds may then be actively titrated to compensate for physiologic variations in the volume delivered to the left ventricle.

Biventricular assist device (BiVAD) support also creates a number of logistical challenges. The surgical complexity of accommodating two pump housings within the thoracic cage can be significant. Whereas the use of dual HeartMate II devices has been reported, the relatively small profile and intrapericardial pump position of the HeartWare HVAD offers a considerable advantage, making this device preferable for high-risk cases or planned biventricular support. 116-118 In our experience, the outflow conduits are best configured in opposing alignments, with the right-sided graft directed posterolaterally to allow anastomosis with the pulmonary artery trunk without interfering with the course of the LVAD graft. A further disadvantage of dual device support is the redundancy of system controllers (two) and batteries (four) required for operation. The resultant physical burden, complexity in daily use, and responsibilities for maintenance present significant challenges for long-term management of patients who require biventricular therapy.

#### **POSTOPERATIVE OUTCOMES**

Over the past 20 years, multicenter studies have documented a progressive improvement in postoperative mortality after LVAD implantation (Fig. 62-10). The landmark REMATCH trial showed a 1-year survival rate of 52% for patients randomized to receive device therapy, compared with 25% survival at 12 months for those treated with medical therapy alone.7 Six years later, the HeartMate II BTT study showed 68% 1-year survival with CF support, a total that rose to 73% within the larger Continued Access Protocol report. 9,25 In keeping with this trend, the HeartWare ADVANCE trial results were released in 2012 and showed an 86% survival rate at 1 year, which was comparable to contemporary INTERMACS data and led to FDA approval of the HVAD for BTT indications.<sup>27</sup> Likely due to improved patient selection, 30-day perioperative survival has also improved during that timespan, rising from roughly 80% with the HeartMate XVE to more than 90% with contemporary devices. 53,119,120

Analysis of the INTERMACS registry reveals several statistically significant risk factors for mortality in patients supported by CF LVADs, including severity of the preoperative clinical profile (levels 1 and 2), renal dysfunction, age over 70 years, RV dysfunction, and increased surgical complexity. <sup>8,121</sup> Biventricular device support is consistently associated with increased short-term mortality, although the data suggest some utility in early planned (as opposed to delayed) implementation of biventricular device therapy. <sup>37,122</sup> Importantly, LVAD therapy has been shown to be equivalent to transplantation in terms of 1- and 2-year mortality, and pretransplant MCS has not been shown to negatively affect outcomes for subsequent transplantation. <sup>123,124</sup> Quality-of-life metrics also

reveal a significant improvement with LVAD therapy that is sustained through 24 months after device implantation.<sup>37</sup>

# ADVERSE EVENTS AND DEVICE COMPLICATIONS

The implementation of device therapy is associated with specific perioperative and long-term risks for the patient. To standardize the evaluation of patient outcomes, INTERMACS has established definitions for adverse events associated with MCS. The cumulative incidence of these adverse events within the first 60 days of MCS has been reported to be as high as 89%, many such events being associated with a reduction in long-term survival (Fig. 62-11). Implementation

and management of MCS, thus, obligates a consideration of the risks associated with device therapy and an appreciation of the implications of certain events.

### Perioperative Bleeding

Whereas detailed analysis is limited with regard to the currently available data registries, bleeding has historically been cited as the most common complication after LVAD implantation, and bleeding of any type (operative and late onset) is the most common adverse event recorded by INTER-MACS. 25,37,126 Surgical bleeding and large-volume bloodproduct resuscitation has been associated with increased 30-day and 1-year mortality rates, RV dysfunction, acute lung injury, infection, and pretransplant allosensitization. 127 Reported bleeding rates were high in the early pulsatile LVAD experience, with nearly 50% of patients suffering from major bleeding complications.<sup>81</sup> Although the introduction of CF devices resulted in an overall improvement in outcomes, bleeding has remained a significant perioperative challenge. Early experience with the HeartMate II clinical trials showed that between 50 and 80% of patients required perioperative blood product transfusion, with 30% of patients undergoing reoperation for bleeding complications. 25,26 Single-center analyses have since revealed a modest reduction in transfusion requirements. 104,128

Recently, the comparative analysis of different devices with regard to perioperative bleeding complications has been an area of particular interest. The HeartWare BTT trial investigators reported a lower risk of reoperation for bleeding than did the contemporary INTERMACS control group (largely comprising HeartMate II patients). A single-center analysis subsequently determined that although red blood cell administration was equivalent for the two pumps, HVAD recipients required fewer blood products overall (8.3  $\pm$  13 vs 12.6  $\pm$  14 units) and had a lower chest-tube output than did

HeartMate II patients.<sup>129</sup> As a result, these studies have been used to suggest that, due to a reduction in surgical dissection, the HVAD is associated with fewer bleeding complications. However, whereas differences between pumps may indeed affect bleeding rates, these studies fail to account for wide variations in surgical approach and perioperative management that may contribute to these results. Regardless of the device used, bleeding is a significant challenge in the perioperative period.

### Right-Sided Heart Failure

The identification and management of RV dysfunction has been extensively discussed. Development of RHF presents a major postoperative challenge and is strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes and increased mortality.<sup>37,81,82</sup> Reported criteria for the diagnosis of RV failure vary in the literature. The most commonly used definition of post-LVAD RV failure originates from the HeartMate II BTT trial, which described RV failure as the need for RV support, inotropic support for at least 14 days after implantation, or the initiation of inotropic support after 14 days of LVAD support.9 INTERMACS utilizes considerably broader criteria for data acquisition purposes, relying primarily on signs and symptoms of elevated CVP and more specific conditions to evaluate the level of severity. 130 The reported incidence of RV failure after LVAD implantation remains highly variable, ranging from 15 to 30%. 82,87,123,126 A subset of patients with RV failure (between 8 and 10% of device recipients) will require mechanical RV support. 37,88,91,126

#### Infection

Device therapy carries a significant risk of infection, primarily due to the presence of foreign material within the body and a percutaneous driveline. With early pulsatile systems, infection rates ranged from 50 to 60% during the lifetime of the pump, and more than 40% of deaths in the LVADsupported cohort of the REMATCH trial were due to fulminant sepsis. 111,131 Although the incidence has significantly improved with the introduction of newer-generation devices, infection remains a major source of morbidity and mortality during MCS, and it is the second most reported adverse event in the INTERMACS database.<sup>37</sup> With regard to device comparison, the rates of driveline infection and sepsis in the original HeartMate II BTT trial were 14 and 17%, respectively, compared with 12.1 and 11.4% in the subsequent HeartWare BTT trial.<sup>25,27</sup> Creation of a preperitoneal pump pocket during implantation of the HeartMate II likely predisposes those patients to the development of a pump-pocket infection, which can often result in life-threatening sepsis and the need for pump exchange. As a result, our institutional preference is to avoid the need for a pump pocket by placing the pump in a subdiaphragmatic intraperitoneal position.

A review of INTERMACS data revealed percutaneous driveline infections in 9.8% of all patients supported with CF devices. <sup>132</sup> The mean time to development of the infection

is typically greater than 6 months, implying that most such infections occur in the outpatient setting, when patients are more active and responsible for dressing care. <sup>132-134</sup> By 1 year, 19% of patients have developed a driveline infection, while 1 in 4 are diagnosed with a driveline infection by 2 years of CF LVAD support. <sup>37</sup> Whereas most patients in the INTERMACS database were treated with antibiotics alone, surgical intervention was required in 12.5% of cases. <sup>37,132</sup> Specific information regarding the extent of debridement is generally not reported, but vacuum-assisted closure, antibiotic bead therapy, and driveline mobilization have all been described. <sup>135,136</sup> Infection has been shown to adversely impact survival, increasing the 1-year mortality rate as much as 6-fold. <sup>37,132,137</sup> The presence of a documented device infection does not preclude transplantation.

#### Renal Failure

As described earlier, preoperative renal dysfunction has been shown to be strongly associated with poor outcomes after LVAD implantation.<sup>76,77</sup> Similarly, the development of postoperative renal failure is a significant predictor of the 1-year mortality rate after device implantation. 125 However, risk factors for postoperative renal failure are poorly understood, and indices of preoperative renal status do not appear to be strong independent predictors of such failure.77 Although definitions vary, the incidence of postoperative renal failure ranges from 14 to 30%. 125,138,139 Factors associated with the development of this complication appear to include preoperative ventilatory support, elevated CVP, and advanced patient age. The initiation of MCS has been shown to enhance end-organ perfusion, and management options for postoperative renal failure range from supportive medical therapy to temporary or permanent renal replacement.<sup>73</sup> As many as 10 to 20% of patients undergoing LVAD implantation require some form of postoperative renal replacement therapy, and approximately half of that population can be expected to recover independent renal function, typically within the first month. 138,139 Development of postoperative renal failure has been shown to be associated with longer ICU stays, increased ventilator dependence, prolonged inotropic support, and a significant decline in 30-day, 3-month, and 1-year survival. 37,138

# Stroke and Neurologic Dysfunction

Despite improvements in device reliability and management strategies, stroke remains a significant source of morbidity and mortality in patients who require LVAD support. Clinically apparent strokes can result in significant functional disabilities—a particular challenge for routine device maintenance—along with impaired quality of life, significant rehabilitation needs, and decreased postevent survival. Collectively, the impact of these outcomes highlights neurologic dysfunction as a particularly feared complication of device therapy.

While strokes are typically classified under a singular adverse event heading, the disparate pathogenesis of hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes suggests the likelihood for multiple causative factors. A detailed analysis comparing stroke etiology in device patients is not yet available, but the incidence of hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes appears to be roughly equal. 26,140,141 Overall, the reported incidence of stroke among device patients in the INTERMACS database is 11% at 1 year and 17% at 2 years postimplantation.<sup>37</sup> Risk factors for stroke during MCS are poorly understood, and many presumed influences—including anticoagulation, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, and device type—have not been found to be statistically significant. 141 Pulsatility may play a role in the development of embolic strokes. Prolonged closure of the aortic valve has been shown to result in eddies and stasis within the aortic cusps, predisposing some patients to the formation of thrombus that can be released with later opening of the valve. 142 Similarly, some patients have developed thrombus in areas of stasis within the carotid bulb; again, such thrombus is susceptible to dislodgement after the recovery of pulsatility.<sup>31</sup> As a result, routine maintenance of intermittent pulsatility may provide prophylactic washout of these areas and reduce the potential for thromboembolic events. In recent studies, BP has been identified as an additional key determinant in the pathogenesis of stroke. The importance of adequate BP control in this population is suggested by the fact that patients with lower BP at hospital discharge and those receiving aggressive pharmacologic antihypertensive therapy have significantly lower rates of neurologic events. 141,143 Stroke adversely affects survival, entailing a 25% 30-day and nearly 50% 1-year mortality risk. 140,141

# Nonsurgical and Gastrointestinal Bleeding

As noted previously, bleeding of any type is the most frequent adverse event reported to INTERMACS, and lateonset spontaneous bleeding is a significant source of morbidity for patients supported by CF LVADs.<sup>37</sup> Researchers have consistently documented the frequency of nonsurgical (primarily GI) bleeding, particularly in older patients, and the reported incidence of this complication ranges from 18 to 30%. 144-149 GI sources account for the vast majority (70%) of nonsurgical bleeding episodes. Epistaxis, intracranial, and genitourinary episodes are progressively less common.<sup>149</sup> The location of GI bleeding is divided fairly evenly above and below the ligament of Treitz. Although percentages vary among studies, erosive gastritis and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) appear to be the most frequent causative factors. 144,145,149 Whereas GI bleeding is a significant source of morbidity—principally because of more frequent hospitalizations and increased transfusionrelated alloantigen exposure—no associated impact on overall mortality has been reported.

The relative frequency of GI bleeding in this patient population has led to multiple proposed explanations. Anticoagulation during long-term MCS undoubtedly exposes patients to increased bleeding risks. A comparison between nonpulsatile pumps and the pulsatile HeartMate XVE (which did not necessitate anticoagulation therapy) revealed a significant

difference in bleeding events.<sup>29</sup> However, the frequency of these events remains unexpectedly high, as patients supported by CF LVADs have a substantially higher risk for GI bleeding than do patients who require anticoagulation for cardiovascular disease.<sup>147</sup> Furthermore, bleeding events have been known to occur even without the use of anticoagulation.<sup>150</sup>

Some researchers have suggested that the propensity for GI bleeding may be due to an altered thrombotic physiology resulting from interaction between the device and the blood-stream. Multiple studies have shown that patients supported by CF LVADs can develop an acquired von Willebrand syndrome as a result of the proteolytic cleavage of high-molecular-weight von Willebrand factor multimers. <sup>151-153</sup> However, this explanation alone cannot explain the variability of bleeding events within the LVAD population, as bleeding has been shown to be nearly universal in the setting of axial-flow device support. <sup>154</sup>

An alternative explanation for the frequency of GI bleeding events may lie in the narrow pulse pressure created by CF support. The association between aortic stenosis and AVM formation was first described by Heyde in the 1950s, and a syndrome bearing his name was characterized over the subsequent decades. 155,156 This process is believed to result from hypoperfusion and ischemia of intestinal mucosa, leading to friable neovasculature susceptible to rupture. Application of this concept to CF MCS physiology was first suggested by Letsou and colleagues, 157 who described a series of patients supported by the Jarvik 2000. Recently, a retrospective review also documented a strong association between GI bleeding and both reduced PI and aortic valve closure, suggesting that a reduction in pulsatility may lead to increased rates of nonsurgical bleeding within the first 3 months of LVAD therapy. 149

ISHLT guidelines suggest that anticoagulation therapy be withdrawn in the setting of clinically significant bleeding. Resumption of anticoagulation is permitted after resolution of the index bleeding event, but a reduction (or permanent cessation) of anticoagulation is justified in the case of recurrent events. When possible, pump speeds are generally reduced to allow increased native pulsatility. Endoscopic evaluation is also warranted for direct control of the bleeding source, although identification of the responsible AVM is often difficult.<sup>36</sup>

# Pump Thrombosis and Device Malfunction

Pump thrombosis is an uncommon but potentially catastrophic complication of LVAD therapy. The HeartMate II BTT trial investigators reported an actuarial freedom from device malfunction (defined as resulting in device replacement or death) of 95% at 6 months and 93% at 1-year postimplantation, one-third of those events being attributed to primary device thrombosis.<sup>9</sup> This degree of reliability and durability represented a significant advance over earlier pulsatile systems, including a nearly 10-fold reduction in the need for device exchange.<sup>158</sup> Between 2011 and 2012, concern was

raised regarding an apparent increase in the rate of pump thrombosis with the HeartMate II. A three-center collaborative study documented an increase in the incidence of pump thrombosis at 3 months from 2.2 to 8.4%; over the same timespan, a federally mandated INTERMACS review similarly described a decline in freedom from pump exchange or death at 6 months from 99 to 94%.<sup>37,159</sup> After extensive investigation, the cause of this discrepancy remained unclear and was likely multifactorial. More recently, however, institutional reports have suggested a reversal in the thrombosis-related trend and the HeartMate II remains the most frequently implanted device worldwide. Nevertheless, understanding the potential factors involved in device thrombosis is critical, as this complication has been shown to negatively impact overall survival.<sup>159</sup>

A major challenge in the prevention of thrombosis events is the complexity of the pathophysiology involved. Indeed, the term "thrombosis" has traditionally been used in a broad sense to describe not just confirmed thrombus within the pump housing but also *suspected* thrombus due to various nonstandardized clinical factors. In 2013, INTERMACS updated its definitions, establishing formal categories of suspected thrombosis (the criteria for which include hemolysis, unexplained HF symptoms, and abnormal pump parameters) and *confirmed* thrombus found on direct inspection or radiographic imaging. 130 Factors that contribute to thrombosis are likely far-ranging, and proposed mechanisms include inadequate heat dissipation at low speeds, ineffective anticoagulation strategies, surgical and anatomical considerations (such as angulation of the inlet or kinking of the outflow graft), patient-specific predisposition, and pump manufacturing and design elements. 160-162

Despite the variable etiology of device malfunction, recent studies have led to improved methods for accurately diagnosing thrombotic events. Serum markers for hemolysis have been shown to be associated with pump thrombus formation, presumably due to the increased shear stress placed on red cells traversing the area of flow impedance. Serum-free hemoglobin (sfHg) has traditionally been used by INTERMACS for diagnostic purposes, with levels greater than 40 mg/dL indicative of significant hemolysis. 130 Recent data have shown that lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) may be a more sensitive marker than sfHg for detecting hemolysis and pump thrombosis, and subsequent INTERMACS reviews have shown a strong correlation between rising LDH levels and thrombotic events. 163 Whereas a threshold value of 600 IU/L has been proposed for diagnostic purposes (representing 2.5 times the upper limit of normal), this cutoff does not appear to be absolute, as anecdotal evidence suggests that many patients may exhibit higher LDH levels without tangible evidence of thrombosis. Other diagnostic tools, including speed-change echocardiography and three-dimensional computed tomography, also likely contribute to diagnostic accuracy. 164 Given the variability in presentation, a recent multicenter collaboration led to the development of a useful diagnostic and clinical management algorithm for patients with suspected pump thrombosis. 165

Treatment strategies for suspected pump thrombosis are limited. Noninvasive measures, such as intravenous anticoagulation (heparin) and direct thrombin inhibitor therapy (bivalirudin or argatroban), are typically initiated early in the management process with variable independent results. 166,167 Success with thrombolytic therapy (both systemic and intraventricular) has also been reported, but this approach entails a risk of intracranial bleeding. 130,168,169 Definitive management of pump thrombosis is surgical, either through pump exchange, pump explantation, or urgent heart transplantation. Pump exchange may be performed through either a redo sternotomy or a subcostal approach, and the pump housing of the HeartMate II can be exchanged directly without disrupting the inlet or outflow conduit. 170,171 Despite the relative short-term safety of the exchange procedure, survival has been shown to decrease with each successive pump exchange, which also increases the likelihood of later infection and neurologic sequelae.<sup>37,160</sup> The mortality rate 6 months after transplantation or initial device replacement is similar to that for patients without a history of thrombosis. 159

#### **TOTAL ARTIFICIAL HEART**

Whereas LVAD support has emerged as the standard of care for patients with end-stage HF, data registry analysis suggests that a sizeable percentage (typically cited as 8 to 10%) of patients will require biventricular support. 37,87,88,91 Heart transplantation has traditionally served as the gold-standard therapy for this subset of patients, but the scarcity of donor organs has led to a stagnant rate of transplantation, totaling just over 4000 procedures each year worldwide. 172 Mechanical total heart replacement is a logical and relatively inexhaustible solution to this challenge. The use of implantable BiVADs has been reported in the treatment of patients with severe biventricular HF.116,173,174 However, available devices are designed to function independently, and logistical challenges in their implantation and management as BiVAD systems renders them cumbersome and difficult to operate. As a result, the development of a self-contained, fully implantable total heart replacement device is an important, though elusive, goal.

# Early Development and Experience

The concept of replacing the human heart with a permanent or temporary mechanical device has been postulated for centuries and was first reported in the early nineteenth century by French physiologist Julien Jean Cesar Le Gallois. <sup>175</sup> Since that time, efforts to duplicate nature's design—including the famed collaboration between Charles Lindbergh and Alexis Carrell in the 1920s—have periodically captured the public imagination but failed to produce a reliable self-contained device. <sup>176</sup>

The first tangible step toward the development of a viable TAH came in 1957, when Tetsuzo Akutsu and Willem Kolff replaced the heart of a dog with an experimental pulsatile device. The dog survived for several hours. Although the

![](_page_21_Picture_2.jpeg)

pump was never tested in humans, its brief success highlighted the potential for total heart replacement. Capitalizing on a growing interest in MCS, the National Heart Institute (now termed the NHLBI) established the Artificial Heart Program in 1964, helping to fund and support research and development efforts throughout the field.

The first implantation of a TAH into a human was performed by Denton Cooley on April 4, 1969. <sup>16</sup> The device was placed in a 47-year-old man who could not be weaned from CPB after undergoing an LV aneurysmectomy. Designed by Domingo Liotta, the pump was a pneumatically powered, double-chambered device with Dacron-lined conduits and Wada-Cutter hingeless valves (Fig. 62-12). It was intended to support the patient only until a suitable donor heart was found. Indeed, the TAH performed adequately for 64 hours, after which the patient underwent a transplant. Despite its success, Liotta's pump was never again used clinically, but the experience showed that a TAH could be used safely and effectively for BTT.

### Contemporary Options for Total Heart Replacement

#### SYNCARDIA TAH

In the late 1970s, under the leadership of Willem Kolff, researchers at the University of Utah began developing a TAH design that eventually evolved into what is now known

as the SynCardia TAH. The device consists of two separate, pneumatically driven pumps bound only by a Velcro patch along their adjoining walls (Fig. 62-13). Pump operation depends on the pneumatic displacement of a polyurethane diaphragm powered by an external pneumatic driver. Dacron cuffs permit atrial anastomosis after ventriculectomy, and the outflow conduits are similarly composed of woven Dacron grafts. Both components are attached to the pump housing by specialized connecting brackets. Each pump contains large-diameter SynHall valves (derived from the original Medtronic-Hall design) that regulate both inflow and outflow (27 and 25 mm, respectively) and provide minimal resistance to flow. The pneumatic drivelines are tunneled beneath the costal margin to reach the external driver, where pump rate, drive pressure, and systolic duration are controlled. The device produces a stroke volume of 70 mL and a cardiac output as high as 15 L/min. 178,179

The earliest clinical iteration of this device, labeled the Jarvik-7, was first implanted by William DeVries in 1982, supporting a 61-year-old man with congestive HF for 112 days until he died of multiorgan failure. Be Despite initially mixed results, clinical trials began in 1985. Over the years, the device was rebranded the Symbion, then the CardioWest TAH, and finally the SynCardia TAH.

![](_page_21_Figure_11.jpeg)

**FIGURE 62-13** The Syncardia Total Artificial Heart (formerly the Jarvik-7, Symbion, and CardioWest TAH) utilizes two pneumatically driven pumps for biventricular support. (Courtesy: SynCardia Systems, Inc.)

Like many other TAHs, the SynCardia is somewhat restricted by its large size. Generally, candidates are screened for a sufficient body surface area (>1.8 m²) and for a chest anteroposterior diameter of >10 cm on computed tomography. Studies have shown that the body surface area is associated with an increased risk of bleeding, infection, and overall mortality. A smaller (50 mL) version of the device is currently under development. Another historic limitation of the SynCardia TAH was the inconvenience of its external components. The original console was large and relatively immobile, effectively eliminating the possibility of prolonged ambulation or outpatient management. The 2010 release of the 13-pound Freedom Driver has done much to alleviate these problems, greatly improving device portability. Section 1866.

The SynCardia TAH is currently approved by the FDA and CMS for BTT in the treatment of biventricular failure and has been successfully used in more than 1100 patients. 187 In 2012, the device also received approval for DT use as a humanitarian exemption. Although the majority of implants have been performed for short-term support, nearly 50 patients have been supported for more than 1 year with the SynCardia, and the median duration of support is approximately 554 days. The survival-to-transplantation rate has been 72% in the long-term population. Complications have included systemic infections (35%), driveline infections (27%), thromboembolism (19%), and device malfunction (10%). 185 Survival rates are most impacted during the early postoperative period, and the vast majority of deaths occur within the first month. 188,189 Despite these limitations, the SynCardia has the potential for long-term reliable total heart replacement.

#### **ABIOCOR TAH**

The AbioCor Implantable Replacement Heart is a selfcontained, single-body, electrohydraulic TAH developed by ABIOMED, Inc. (Danvers, MA) and the Texas Heart Institute. 190 The device's principal thoracic component, which is positioned orthotopically after biventriculectomy, consists of two polyurethane hydraulic pumping chambers—each flanked by trileaflet valves—that serve as artificial ventricles and function as opposing compliance chambers (Fig. 62-14). A continuous motor allows shuttling of hydraulic fluid to alternately pressurize the right and left ventricles. Active diastolic filling of the contralateral side is enabled by the negative pressure established by the hydraulic system. Unique to the design of the AbioCor is the use of radiofrequency data transmission and a transcutaneous energy transfer system designed to create a fully implantable system that can communicate with external hardware without penetrating the skin. An electronic and data component is implanted within the abdomen. The pump produces a stroke volume of 65 mL and a cardiac output as high as 12 L/min.

The AbioCor is also the only device designed to address the natural dissymmetry in native ventricular output. Management of a totally implantable pulsatile TAH system requires an understanding of the difference in stroke volumes produced by the right and left sides of the heart. The arterial blood supply to the bronchial tree (totaling 2 to 3 cc with

![](_page_22_Picture_7.jpeg)

**FIGURE 62-14** The AbioCor Implantable Replacement Heart. (Reproduced with permission from ABIOMED, Inc.)

each heartbeat) drains directly into the left atrium, thereby avoiding the conventional venous system and resulting in an LV output that exceeds right-sided output by 2 to 5%. Whereas this imbalance seems negligible in the short term, it accounts for as much as 250 L of blood flow each day and must be carefully considered when designing a pulsatile device responsible for producing right- and left-sided flows. To accommodate this discrepancy, the design of the AbioCor involves a right-to-left flow-balancing mechanism is designed to account for interventricular physiologic flow differences by shunting hydraulic fluid away from the right-sided pump.<sup>191</sup> The design functioned appropriately in both animal studies and clinical use.

With support from NHLBI, preclinical trials and extensive animal testing began at the Texas Heart Institute in 1993. In 2001, the FDA approved a phase 1 feasibility study for the device, which was first implanted in a 59-year-old man in Louisville, KY who survived for 151 days with the device. 192 Criteria for inclusion in the study were restrictive, and included the diagnosis of irreversible biventricular HF (>70% predicted 30-day mortality), with documented ineligibility for transplant. A total of 14 patients were eventually enrolled in the trial, the longest period of survival reaching 512 days. Overall survival metrics were promising, with a 71% 30-day survival rate (compared with 13% in the medical arm) and 40% survival at 2 months. 193

A major disadvantage of this pump is its relatively large size, which limited candidacy to patients with a thoracic cage deep enough to accommodate the device. Preoperative sizing was generally performed by using three-dimensional computed tomography reconstructions, focusing primarily on anteroposterior thoracic diameter and the position of the

pulmonary bifurcation. 193 Sufficient distance between the bifurcation and diaphragm was required to prevent compression of the left pulmonary veins and lower-lobe bronchus. Due to the level of anatomical complexity, a high degree of confidence with regard to sizing and fit was required before implantation was attempted. Although the AbioCor received FDA approval for use under a humanitarian device exemption in 2006, no implants have been performed since the completion of its initial feasibility study, principally due to the prohibitive economic barriers associated with its implementation.

### Complexities of Mechanical Total Heart Replacement

Initial efforts to develop a viable TAH began in earnest as part of a series of bold scientific initiatives proposed by the Kennedy administration during the idealistic 1960s. Although similarly daring goals, such as manned spaceflight to the moon, were accomplished within the decade, construction of a reliable self-contained device for replacing the human heart proved to be a prohibitive technical challenge. A number of complexities, both physiologic and technologic, are to blame for the ongoing delay in realizing this objective.

From an engineering standpoint, designing a TAH presents a number of challenges, the chief of these being durability. The human heart beats more than 100,000 times each day. As a result, thin diaphragms and hydraulic actuators devised for pulsatile systems are subject to considerable mechanical wear; though capable of providing support beyond 1 year, they are unlikely to withstand the physical demands of long-term operation. Size is also a hurdle in TAH design, and the housing of biventricular volume-displacement chambers capable of producing sufficient cardiac output requires a substantial device profile that can be difficult to accommodate, even in larger patients. Moreover, portability and mobility are crucial considerations for long-term support. Pneumatic systems require drivelines for pressure venting. Even though recent efforts have reduced the size of associated equipment, compressors and power consoles can be cumbersome and limit functionality. Minimization of extracorporeal drivers, drivelines, and tethering equipment would speed postoperative recovery, minimize infectious risks, and improve overall quality of life. Remedying these concerns, however, has proved to be an immense scientific and technological undertaking.

#### Future Directions: the CF TAH

A quarter century of clinical experience with CF pumps has revealed the human capacity for physiologic tolerance of nonpulsatile flow and has confirmed the significant design advantages of CF devices over pulsatile TAHs. Continuous-flow devices are not only significantly smaller than pulsatile pumps but also are more anatomically appropriate thus being simpler to implant and operate. Furthermore, with few (or no) points of mechanical contact, CF designs essentially eliminate the potential for mechanical wear, resulting in a level of

clinical durability far surpassing that of pulsatile systems.<sup>194</sup> Hemodynamically, CF pumps also appear well suited for TAH use, because (much as in the native heart) the inherent inflow sensitivity of these devices provides a degree of automaticity in responding to imbalances in right- and left-sided flows. Thus, development of a CF TAH may lead to realization of a long-awaited goal.

Over the past decade at the Texas Heart Institute, extensive research and development efforts have been dedicated to the concept of CF total heart replacement, involving both simulated models and live animal studies. To date, more than 70 calves have been implanted with paired CF VADs to provide completely nonpulsatile circulatory support. The resulting CF TAH model has revealed considerable long-term effectiveness, with more than 30 animals surviving for longer than 7 days, 8 surviving for 30 days, and 2 calves surviving for more than 90 days with nonpulsatile blood flow after CF total heart replacement. 195,196 Tolerance of this altered physiologic state is further evidenced by stable hemodynamic profiles both at rest and during treadmill exercise studies, as well as preserved hematologic and biochemical markers for endorgan function. This extensive experience with large animal models has stimulated a number of collaborative research efforts in search of a viable CF TAH design.

To this end, a novel CF TAH is currently being developed that offers tremendous potential to become a completely implantable long-term cardiac replacement device. The BiVACOR TAH, developed by BiVACOR USA in Houston, Texas, working closely with the Texas Heart Institute, is a small, compact device that utilizes a single magnetically levitated rotor to provide pulmonary and systemic blood flow without the use of bearings or valves<sup>197</sup> (Fig. 62-15). Impellers are mounted on each side of the rotor (which separates the right and left chambers), and its frictionless suspension permits accommodation for physiologic flow

![](_page_23_Picture_11.jpeg)

**FIGURE 62-15** The BiVACOR total artificial heart employs a single moving part—a central magnetically levitated rotor—to provide compete cardiopulmonary support. (Reproduced, with permission, from BiVACOR, Inc.)

imbalances by axial displacement the rotor. <sup>198</sup> Also unique to the BiVACOR is the use of dynamic speed profiles to allow establishment of pulsatility in device operation. <sup>199</sup> Feasibility studies have been successfully performed in large animals, with a goal of human trials in the near future. A similar hydrodynamically suspended design is also in development at the Cleveland Clinic, which also has begun animal studies. <sup>200</sup> Thus, innovative engineering efforts and successful utilization of CF technology may soon offer the opportunity for permanent mechanical replacement of the failing human heart.

#### **KEY POINTS**

- Continuous-flow technology has resulted in smaller, more durable MCS devices. Although the full effects of the resulting physiologic changes remain unknown, nonpulsatile blood flow is well tolerated.
- 2. Thoughtful patient selection and preoperative optimization of the patient's condition are crucial to ensure good outcomes after LVAD implantation.
- Surgical considerations at the time of LVAD implantation should include careful alignment of the pump inlet and outflow conduits to minimize the risk of physical impediments to proper device function.
- 4. Perioperative preservation and optimization of RV function is an essential component of MCS management.
- Due to the scarcity of available donor organs, development of a CF TAH offers the best means of providing definitive long-term treatment for patients who require total heart replacement.
