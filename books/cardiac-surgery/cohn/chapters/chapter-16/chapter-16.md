# **Myocardial Protection**

M. Salik Jahania • Roberta A. Gottlieb • Robert M. Mentzer, Jr.

Myocardial protection in the operating room refers to strategies and methods used to attenuate or prevent perioperative infarction and/or postischemic ventricular dysfunction. In the setting of an acute myocardial infarction (MI) it refers to adjuvant therapy administered before, during or after reperfusion therapy. In transplantation it refers to the methods used to preserve the donor heart. Although the clinical situations are different, the goal of protection is the same, that is, to prevent or treat myocardial stunning and infarction. The underlying pathophysiology in all three settings is the same and relates to the etiology and consequences of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. After surgery the injury may manifest as low cardiac output, hypotension, and the need for postoperative inotropic support and ultimately mechanical circulatory support. I/R injury may be reversible (stunning) or irreversible (infarction) and is differentiated by electrocardiographic abnormalities (presence of a new Q-wave), elevations in the levels of specific plasma enzymes or proteins such as creatine kinase-MB and troponin I or T and/or the presence of regional or global echocardiographic wall motion abnormalities. Depending upon the criteria used, the incidence of postoperative MI in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) ranges between 3% and 18%.<sup>1-4</sup> While the majority of these are non-Q wave infarctions, they still are independently associated with adverse outcomes and prolonged aortic cross-clamp time and duration of CPB. Despite advances in techniques and cardioprotective strategies, the incidence of severe ventricular dysfunction, heart failure and death postoperatively ranges between 1% and 15%. The higher mortality rates are generally associated with high-risk patients with minimal cardiac reserve. These complications have an enormous impact on both families and society. From an economic standpoint alone, procedures for cardiovascular diseases are

According to Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics–2015 Update,<sup>5</sup> in 2010 an estimated 954,000 percutaneous interventions (PCIs), 397,000 CABG operations, 1,029,000 diagnostic cardiac catheterizations, 97,000 defibrillator implants and 370,000 pacemaker procedures were performed on inpatients in the United States. The estimated cost was

\$204.4 billion. Between 2013 and 2030, medical costs of coronary heart disease alone are projected to increase by 100%. Cardiovascular disease costs more than any other diagnostic group. Therefore, a reduction in perioperative complications associated with heart surgery would have a significant impact on resource utilization and overall operative costs. <sup>6-8</sup> Since I/R injury is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after heart surgery, the purpose of this chapter is to review its underlying mechanisms, review the history of myocardial protection, update the reader regarding the current protective techniques and discuss new strategies under investigation.

## **ISCHEMIA/REPERFUSION INJURY**

The etiology of perioperative myocardial necrosis and postischemic myocardial dysfunction after cardiac surgery is multifactorial. Myocardial necrosis and elevation of associated cardiac biomarkers may arise as a result of ischemia due to intrinsic coronary disease unrelated to revascularization, anesthetic factors, atrial cannulation, suturing of heart muscle, plaque rupture or platelet embolism, and graft spasm or thrombosis. Despite the considerable progress made to date, high-risk heart surgery patients including those with unstable angina, poor ventricular function, diabetes, repeat CABG, and advanced age continue to experience postoperative complications such as low cardiac output, perioperative MI and heart failure requiring prolonged intensive care. In many of these instances the complications are due to I/R injury and inadequate myocardial protection. Thus there is a compelling unmet need to develop better methods to protect the heart during surgery.

## Deleterious Sequelae of Ischemia/ Reperfusion

Myocardial I/R injury manifests as postischemic "stunning", which is reversible, and apoptosis and/or necrosis, which are irreversible. Myocardial stunning is an injury that lasts for hours to days despite the restoration of normal blood flow. Typically these patients require some type of temporary inotropic support in the immediate postoperative period in order

to maintain an adequate cardiac output. Stunned cardiomyocytes exhibit minimal ultrastructural damage that resolves within hours to days following relief of ischemia. Apoptosis, or programed cell death, is a pattern of cell death that affects single cells. It is characterized by an intact cell membrane with blebbing, cell shrinkage, condensation of the nucleus and oligonucleosomal fragmentation of DNA. Externalization of phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane serves as a cue for phagocytic removal of apoptotic cells by neighboring cells or professional phagocytes without inflammation. It is unclear whether apoptosis is initiated during ischemia and but manifests during reperfusion or whether it is a consequence of reperfusion, but the preponderance of evidence favors the latter.<sup>9,10</sup> Regardless, apoptotic cell death occurs in the infarct zone and continues to occur in the border zone subsequently. Prolonged ischemia results in necrotic cell death characterized by cell swelling, plasma membrane rupture, mitochondrial swelling and loss of cristae, and DNA degradation followed by an inflammatory response to the cellular debris. Dying cells may exhibit features of both apoptosis and necrosis, that is, both nuclear condensation and plasma membrane damage.11-14

### Long-term Consequences

While the end result of inadequate myocardial protection is usually apparent in the immediate postoperative period, for example, low cardiac output syndrome, the full impact may not be evident for months to years. Klatte and colleagues reported that the 6-month mortality was greater in patients with increased peak creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) enzyme ratios after CABG surgery.<sup>15</sup> The 6-month mortality rates were 3.4%, 5.8%, 7.8% and 20% for patients with peak CK-MB ratios that were <5, 5-10, 11-20, and >20-fold higher than the upper limits of normal (UNL), respectively. In another study, Costa and colleagues<sup>16</sup> reported that normal postoperative CK-MB levels were observed in only 38.1% of 496 patients who underwent CABG surgery. When the CK-MB levels were stratified, the incidence of death at 30 days was 0.0%, 0.5%, 5.4%, and 7.0% when the enzyme levels were normal, 1 to 3 times higher, 4 to 5 times higher, and >5-fold higher than ULN, respectively. The 1-year mortality for these groups was 1.1%, 0.5%, 5.4%, and 10.5%. The peak postoperative cardiac enzyme level correlated significantly with worse clinical outcome. Thus, while CK-MB elevations are often dismissed as inconsequential in the setting of multivessel CABG surgery, they occur frequently and are associated with significant increases in both repeat MI and death beyond the immediate perioperative period. Consistent with this is the report by Steuer<sup>17</sup> and associates in which they examined postoperative serum aspartate aminotransferase and CK-MB levels and their relationship to early and late cardiacrelated death in 4911 consecutive patients who underwent CABG during a 6-year period. They reported that elevated enzyme levels on the first postoperative day greatly increased the risk of early cardiac death and were associated with a 40 to 50% increased risk in late mortality at 7 years.

In a retrospective analysis Brener et al showed that CK-MB elevation was common after both percutaneous and surgical revascularization.\(^{18}\) The incidence of CK-MB elevation above the normal range was 90% for CABG surgery and 38% for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In a small fraction of patients the elevations exceeded 10 × ULN (6% for CABG and 5% for PCI). At 3 years follow-up the cumulative mortality was 8% for CABG and 10% for PCI. Even relatively small CK-MB elevations after interventions were associated with increased mortality over time. Similar observations were made when troponin release was used as a biomarker of myocardial injury. Lehrke et al reported in a series of 204 patients that a serum troponin-T concentration of 0.46 mcg/L or more, 48 hours after surgery was associated with a 4.9-fold increase in long-term risk of death.\(^{19}\)

Finally, in one of the largest studies to date Domanski et al<sup>20</sup> reviewed the relationship between peak postoperative levels of biomarkers of myocardial damage and early, intermediate- and long-term mortality reported in previously reported and randomized clinical trials and registries. A total of 18,908 patients from seven studies were included for analysis. The follow-up ranged from 3 months to 5 years. The investigators reported that, in the aggregate, even modest elevations of troponin I at the 24-hour level were prognostically significant, and any CK-MB elevation after CABG was associated with increased mortality. In short, biomarkers of myocardial injury are frequently elevated after CABG surgery and are associated with decreased short-, medium-, and long-term survival.

# Intracellular Mechanisms Underlying Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury

The primary mediators of I/R injury include intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload and oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated at the onset of reperfusion<sup>21</sup> (Fig. 16-1). The molecule nitric oxide (NO) also can interact with superoxide (O<sub>2</sub>-) or peroxides to generate reactive nitrogen species that are capable of inducing injury as well.<sup>22</sup> In addition, metabolic alterations occurring during ischemia can contribute directly and indirectly to Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload and ROS formation. For example, decreased cytosolic phosphorylation potential, that is,  $[ATP]/([ADP] \times [P_i])$ , results in less free energy from ATP hydrolysis than is necessary to drive the energy-dependent pumps (sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ion adenosine triphosphatase (Ca2+-ATPase), the sarcolemmal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase) that maintain intracellular calcium homeostasis.<sup>23</sup> With the onset of ischemia and the build-up of lactic acid, pH falls to as low as 6.6, resulting in proton efflux and sodium influx via the Na+-H+ exchanger. The driving forces for Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange are the relative transmembrane N<sup>+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> gradients. The activity of the exchanger is regulated by the interaction of the H<sup>+</sup> with a sensor site on the exchanger protein; it can be additionally modulated by phosphorylation.<sup>24</sup> During reperfusion the accumulated intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> competes with Ca<sup>2+</sup> for sites on the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger, effectively causing the exchanger to run in reverse, thereby exacerbating

intracellular calcium accumulation. The elevated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> leads to activation of calcium-dependent proteases and phospholipases, calpain-mediated damage to myofibrillar contractile elements, gap junction dysfunction, injury of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). Opening of the pore in the inner mitochondrial membrane is associated with a collapse of the membrane, uncoupling of the electron transport chain, release of cytochrome c and other proapoptotic factors, swelling of the matrix and ultimately rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane and cell death.<sup>25</sup>

The metabolic changes that occur during ischemia also deplete the endogenous antioxidant defense systems of cardiac myocytes. I/R damages mitochondrial complex I generating excessive ROS (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and resulting in damage to cellular lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. Glutathione is a critical defense against oxidative stress, in which GSH (reduced glutathione) is used to repair oxidized protein thiols, generating GSSG (oxidized glutathione) system; GSH is regenerated by glutathione reductase which depends upon the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, reduced form: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH:NADP+) ratio. Depletion of glutathione impairs

the ability to detoxify ROS-mediated damage to proteins. 26,27 During ischemia NADPH levels drop thereby limiting the ability to regenerate reduced glutathione. Thus, the formation of ROS during reperfusion occurs at a time when the myocyte's endogenous defense mechanisms are depressed. The NADPH:NADP+ ratio is a primary determinant of the redox state of the cell, and there is evidence that the redox state plays a key role in determining the bioactivity and the redox state of NO.<sup>22,28</sup> In addition, there are several reports that in the absence of normal levels of its cofactors, nitric oxide synthase (NOS), itself can generate the superoxide anion.<sup>29</sup> Although systolic intracellular calcium concentration, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], may decrease to normal levels early in the reperfused stunned myocardium, transient increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. can result in sustained activation of protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, calpain proteases and deoxyribonuclease II (DNase II). 30 Calpain-mediated proteolysis of contractile proteins has been implicated in the reduction of myofilament Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity observed in stunned myocardium.<sup>31</sup>

There is considerable evidence that ROS are involved in mediating myocardial stunning. Various spin-trap agents and chemical probes have demonstrated the rapid release of ROS into the vascular space during reperfusion after brief ischemia in vivo.<sup>32</sup> While mitochondria are a major source of intracellular ROS in cardiac myocytes, they are not the only source of ROS during I/R.33,34 It has been shown that antioxidants administered before the onset of ischemia attenuate myocardial stunning in vitro and in vivo. Antioxidants administered prior to or at the onset of reperfusion may show efficacy, although there are contradictory studies.<sup>21,35</sup> It has been shown that ROS can attack thiol residues of numerous proteins such as the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SR Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase), the ryanodine receptor, and contractile proteins, which may explain why myofibrils isolated from in vivo reperfused stunned, but not necrotic myocardium, exhibit reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity.<sup>36,37</sup> Prolonged ischemia resulting in irreversible injury is associated with more severe intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload and further depletion of endogenous antioxidants, conditions that both contribute to and are exacerbated during reperfusion by the production of ROS. Overproduction of ROS during reperfusion increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], through increased L-type Ca2+ channel current. 27,38,39 Ca2+ overload with I/R exacerbates mitochondrial ROS production.<sup>39,40</sup> Mitochondria can buffer small increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> via the Ca uniporter, a process that is energetically favorable owing to the [Ca2+] gradient and the mitochondrial membrane potential. During reperfusion the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ enhances mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Since excess cytosolic Ca2+ has been associated with the loss of myocyte viability, mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering is initially cardioprotective. 41 However, continued mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in the face of decreased antioxidant reserves and ongoing oxidative stress ultimately triggers opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, a large conductance channel that allows release of stored mitochondrial Ca2+, osmotic swelling of the mitochondria, collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential and cell death. The synergistic interactions between Ca2+ overload and ROS formation during conditions of decreased antioxidant reserves also may explain why ROS scavengers are not very effective at reducing irreversible injury when administered at reperfusion.<sup>42</sup> It also possible that antioxidants employed in studies to date are not targeted to the sites where ROS are generated and mediate most of their damage. Specific mitochondrial antioxidants may be more effective. 43-45

## Broadening the Spectrum of Ischemia/ Reperfusion Injury

Historically myocardial I/R injury has been characterized as either reversible or irreversible, based on staining techniques, enzyme release and histology. There is now increasing evidence that the transition from reversible to irreversible injury occurs on a continuum rather than an all-or-none phenomenon. Apoptosis depends on the availability of ATP and precedes loss of membrane integrity; however, if ATP depletion occurs rapidly, the Na $^+$ /K $^+$ -ATPase will be unable to regulate cell volume, resulting in plasma membrane rupture and necrotic cell death before the enzymatic processes of apoptosis are complete.  $^{46,47}$  Intracellular ROS and/or intracellular

calcium overload can initiate the apoptotic program through proapoptotic BH3-only proteins Bnip3 (activated by ROS) and Bid (proteolytically activated by calpain). 48,49 (Fig. 16-2) The BH3-only proteins trigger oligomerization of Bax or Bak directly or indirectly (through interaction with antiapoptoic Bcl-2 family members, Bcl-2, Bcl-x, or Mcl-1), thus permeabilizing the outer mitochondrial membrane and allowing the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. 49-51 Formation of a cytosolic complex comprising cytochrome c, apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (APAF-1), and caspase-9 leads to proteolytic activation of caspase 3 and subsequent cleavage of multiple targets and activation of endonucleases and poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP). Proteolytic activation of PARP results in rapid consumption of adenine nucleotides and culminates in cell death. In parallel, intracellular ROS and calcium overload trigger mPTP opening and mitochondrial swelling; the mitochondrial F<sub>0</sub>-F<sub>1</sub> ATP synthase runs in reverse hydrolyzing ATP in a futile effort to restore membrane potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane. ATP depletion compromises the ability to maintain ion and volume homeostasis via the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase culminating in cell swelling, rupture of the plasma membrane and necrotic cell death. Myocardial damage can be further aggravated by the influx of macrophages and leukocytes, complement activation, and endothelial plugging by platelets and neutrophils.

Detection of apoptosis based on DNA fragmentation (TUNEL assay), the final event in apoptotic cell death underestimates the extent of apoptosis. Detection of externalized phosphatidylserine with annexin V conjugated to a fluorescent dye allows earlier recognition of apoptosis and has been used for in vivo imaging of apoptosis in the mouse heart; however, not all cells recognized by Annexin V are irreversibly committed to cell death. 52-55 Estimates of apoptosis in I/R injury are further confounded by the fact that the apoptotic remnants are efficiently cleared by neighboring cells or professional phagocytes. Thus the magnitude and significance of apoptosis in I/R injury has remained controversial. Genetic manipulations of mice have shown that disrupting the apoptotic machinery can result in a 60 to 70% reduction in infarct size. However, attempts to mitigate apoptosis with caspase inhibitors have not resulted in substantial reductions in infarct size, possibly because interruption of the late stages of apoptosis may simply result in necrosis. As a result, many investigators have turned their attention to interventions targeting the early events in apoptosis or preventing mPTP opening and necrotic cell death. Regardless of which stage is being addressed, current cardioprotection strategies are designed to reduce cellular and subcellular ROS formation and oxidative stress to enhance the heart's endogenous antioxidant defense mechanisms and prevent intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload.

Bax, proapoptotic family of proteins; Bcl-2, antiapoptotic protein; Ca<sup>2+</sup>, calcium; ROS, reactive oxygen species; Apaf, apoptotic protease-activating factor 1; PS, phosphatidylserine; SR, sarco-plasmic reticulum. Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload during ischemia and reperfusion and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation during reperfusion are primary mediators of cell death via apoptosis and necrosis. The mechanisms of Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload and ROS formation are described in detail in the text. In the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, BH3-only proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family are activated by calpain or caspase 8 (Bid) or ROS (Bnip3); they interact with Bax or Bak to form pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane allowing release of cytochrome *c*. This interaction is opposed by the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members including Bcl-2, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, and Mcl-1. In the cytosol, cytochrome *c* interacts with Apaf-1 and ATP or dATP to promote proteolytic activation of caspase 9 and the downstream executioner protease, caspase 3. Caspase 3 cleaves multiple targets, inactivating many cell survival pathways and activating endonucleases responsible for oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation (DNA laddering). Cleavage of spectrin internal to the plasma membrane is permissive for phosphatidylserine redistribution to the external leaflet of the cell membrane, marking the dying cell for phagocytic removal by tissue macrophages or neighboring cells without an inflammatory response. In the necrotic death pathway, Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload and ROS trigger opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), resulting in swelling of the matrix, disruption of the outer mitochondrial membrane, and rampant ATP hydrolysis by the ATP synthase running in reverse in a futile attempt to restore mitochondrial membrane potential. This energetic crisis leads to failure of the plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase, loss of plasma membrane integrity, and cell ruptur

potassium in which ventricular fibrillation was induced by electric shock. 56,57 In 1930, Wiggers reported that injections of potassium chloride were capable of abrogating ventricular fibrillation and arrested the heart in diastole. He also demonstrated that revival of the heart was possible using calcium chloride and massage. The work by Wiggers led Beck, a thoracic surgeon, to successfully apply defibrillation therapy and save a human life using this method. This resulted in a surge in basic and clinical research in the field of fibrillation and defibrillation with the principles applied to cardiac surgery.

With the advent of CPB, there was a need to refine techniques to protect the heart while creating a quiescent and

bloodless field for the unhurried repair of intracardiac defects. Over the next 50 years, a variety of cardioprotective methods and techniques were introduced (Table 16-1). One of the first methodologies evolved from the concept of shielding the heart from perioperative insult using hypothermia. Bigelow and colleagues suggested using hypothermia "as a form of anesthetic" to expand the scope of surgery. The technique "might permit surgeons to operate upon the 'bloodless heart' without recourse to extra corporal pumps and perhaps allow transplantation of organs." Five years later Melrose and colleagues reported another way to stop and restart the human heart reliably by injecting potassium citrate into the root of the aorta at both normal and reduced body temperatures. 61

Soon thereafter, the clinical application of potassium citrate arrest was adopted by many centers. Interest in using the Melrose technique waned, however, with subsequent reports that potassium citrate arrest was associated with myocardial injury and necrosis. Within a short time, many cardiac surgeons shifted from using potassium-induced arrest to normothermic cardiac ischemia, that is, normothermic heart surgery performed with the aorta occluded while the patient was on CPB, intermittent aortic occlusion or coronary artery perfusion. Experimental and clinical evidence showed, however, that normothermic cardiac ischemia was associated with metabolic acidosis, hypotension and low cardiac output. 62-64 As a consequence, there was a renewed interest in discovering ways to arrest the heart. Bretschneider published the principle of arresting the heart with a low-sodium, calciumfree solution.<sup>65</sup> It was Hearse and colleagues however who

studied the various components of cardioplegic solutions which led to the development and use of St. Thomas solution.66 The components of this crystalloid solution were based on Ringer's solution with its normal concentrations of sodium and calcium with the addition of potassium chloride (16 mmol/L) and magnesium chloride (16 mmol/L) to arrest the heart instantly. The latter component was shown by Hearse to provide an additional cardioprotective benefit. In 1975, Braimbridge and colleagues introduced this crystalloid solution into clinical practice at St. Thomas Hospital.<sup>67</sup> Gay and Ebert showed experimentally that lower concentrations of potassium chloride could achieve the same degree of chemical arrest and myocardial protection afforded by the Melrose solution without the associated myocardial necrosis reported earlier. 67,68 Shortly thereafter, Roe and colleagues reported an operative mortality of 5.4% for patients who

underwent cardiac surgery with potassium-induced arrest as the primary form of myocardial protection.<sup>69</sup> In 1977, Tyers and colleagues demonstrated that potassium cardioplegia provided satisfactory protection in over 100 consecutive cardiac patients.<sup>70</sup> By the 1980s, normothermic aortic occlusion had been replaced for the most part by cold blood cardioplegia to protect the heart during cardiac surgery. The major controversy at the time was not whether cardioplegic solutions should be used, but what was the ideal composition. The chief variants consisted of (1) the Bretschneider solution (containing primarily sodium, magnesium, and procaine); (2) the St. Thomas solution (consisting of potassium, magnesium, and procaine added to Ringer's solution); and, (3) potassium-enriched solutions containing no magnesium or procaine (Table 16-2). Coincident with this controversy, another variant of cardioplegia was introduced, that is, the use of potassium-enriched blood cardioplegia.<sup>71,72</sup> Theoretically blood cardioplegia would be a superior delivery vehicle based on its oxygenating and buffering capacity. Ironically, Melrose and colleagues had initially used blood as the vehicle to deliver high concentrations of potassium citrate more than 20 years earlier. While hypothermia and potassium infusions remain the cornerstone of myocardial protection today, a variety of cardioprotective techniques and solutions are used which allow patients to undergo heart operations with excellent 30-day outcomes. 73,74

#### CARDIOPLEGIC TECHNIQUE

Cardioplegic surgery techniques utilize solutions containing a variety of chemical agents that are designed to arrest the heart rapidly in diastole, create a quiescent operating field and provide reliable protection against ischemia/reperfusion injury. While contemporary cardiac surgery in low-risk patients is relatively safe, patient characteristics have been changing over the past decade. In addition to coronary heart disease and poor ventricular function, patients are presenting with more comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, renal dysfunction, peripheral vascular disease and emphysema. Despite ongoing improvements in cardioplegic techniques, low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) still occurs after surgery and is a major factor associated with poor outcomes. In the absence of technical complications, the most common cause of postoperative LCOS is inadequate myocardial protection. For this reason, there is a real need to develop more effective strategies and novel additives to existing cardioplegic solutions. Currently there are two types of cardioplegic solutions that are used: crystalloid cardioplegia and blood cardioplegia. These

solutions are administered most frequently under hypothermic conditions.

## Crystalloid Cardioplegia

One of the first cardioplegic solutions used to protect the heart during surgery consisted of a cold crystalloid formulation. It was developed on the premise that its administration would protect the heart by reducing its metabolism and aid the surgeon by providing a bloodless field. Over the years a number of crystalloid cardioplegic solutions have been developed which contain different ingredients. The rationale for these ingredients has been based on the need to: (a) induce a rapid cardiac arrest using potassium or magnesium; (b) reduce energy demand and conserve ATP reserves using hypothermia; (c) maintain intracellular ionic and metabolic homeostasis; (d) lower myocardial oxygen consumption; (e) enhance anaerobic and aerobic energy production utilizing glucose and amino acids; (f) stabilize the pH using bicarbonate, phosphate, or histidine buffers; (g) stabilize cellular membranes by using steroids, oxygen free radical scavengers such as glutathione, calcium antagonists and/ or procaine; (h) avoid intracellular calcium overload by providing a hypocalcemic environment and adding magnesium; and (i) prevent cellular edema by the addition of colloids such as mannitol to maintain normal oncotic pressures.

There are basically two types of crystalloid cardioplegic solutions: the intracellular type and the extracellular type. 91 Both types can be used as preservation solutions for organ transplantation. The intracellular types are characterized by absent or low concentrations of sodium and calcium. The extracellular types contain relatively higher concentrations of sodium, calcium and magnesium. Both types avoid concentrations of potassium >40 mmol/L (typical range is 10-40 mmol/L), contain bicarbonate for buffering and are osmotically balanced. Examples of various crystalloid cardioplegic solutions are shown in Table 16-2.

#### **OPERATIVE PROCEDURE**

While the degree of core cooling varies from center to center, patients undergoing CPB are cooled to between 33 and 28°C. To initiate immediate chemical arrest after crossclamping the aorta, the solution is infused through a cardioplegic catheter inserted into the aorta proximal to the cross-clamp. The catheter may or may not be accompanied by a separate vent cannula. The cold hyperkalemic crystalloid solution is then infused (antegrade) at a volume that generally does not exceed 1000 mL. One or more infusions of 300 to 500 mL of the cardioplegic solution may be administered if there is evidence of resumption of electrical heart activity or if a prolonged ischemic time is anticipated. If myocardial revascularization is being performed, the aortic cross-clamp can be removed after completing the distal anastomoses and the heart reperfused while the proximal anastomoses are completed using a partial occlusion clamp. Alternatively, the proximal grafts can be performed after the distal grafts have been completed with the cross-clamp still in place (the single-clamp technique). Another approach is to perform the proximal aortic grafts first with a partial occlusion clamp and then cross-clamp the aorta and infuse the cardioplegic solution. When valve repair or replacement is being performed, the crystalloid cardioplegia can be administered directly into the coronary arteries via cannulation of the coronary ostia. Crystalloid cardioplegia also can be administered retrograde via a coronary sinus catheter with or without a self-inflating silicone cuff.

#### **OUTCOMES**

Although there is a concern that crystalloid cardioplegia lacks blood components and therefore has a limited oxygen carrying capacity, this has not been shown to be clinically relevant. Likewise while there is preclinical evidence that hyperkalemic crystalloid cardioplegia may damage coronary vascular endothelium and impair the ability of endothelial cells to replicate and produce endothelial derived factors, this has not been shown to be of clinical significance. <sup>92,93</sup> In fact, there are numerous clinical studies which demonstrate that crystalloid cardioplegia is as effective as blood cardioplegia, particularly in centers where it is the primary form of protection. <sup>94,95</sup>

## **Blood Cardioplegia**

Cold blood cardioplegia, widely employed throughout the world, is the cardioplegic technique used most often in the United States. The rationale for using blood as a vehicle for hypothermic potassium-induced cardiac arrest is that it (a) provides an oxygenated environment and a method for intermittent reoxygenation of the heart during arrest; (b) limits hemodilution when large volumes of cardioplegic solution are used; (c) affords an excellent buffering capacity and osmotic properties; (d) allows for electrolyte composition and pH that are physiologic; (e) offers a number of endogenous antioxidants and free-radical scavengers; and (f) is less complex to prepare than other solutions.

Although there are a variety of formulations it is usually prepared by combining autologous blood, obtained from the extracorporeal circuit while the patient is on CPB, with a crystalloid cardioplegic solution that consists of citrate-phosphate-dextrose (CPD) buffered with tris-hydroxymethylaminomethane or bicarbonate and supplemented with potassium chloride. The CPD is used to lower the ionic calcium, and the buffer is used to maintain an alkaline pH at approximately 7.8. The final concentration of potassium used to arrest the heart is approximately 20 to 25 mEq/L. After the initial induction dose for rapid arrest, subsequent administrations may be intermittent or continuous and utilize a concentration of 8 to 10 mEq/L (the low concentration maintenance dose). 96,97 (Table 16-2)

Prior to administering blood cardioplegia, the temperature of the solution usually is lowered with a heat-exchanging coil to between 12 and 4°C. The ratio of blood to crystalloid varies among centers with the most common ratios being 8:1,

4:1, and 2:1; this in turn affects the final hematocrit of the blood cardioplegia infused. For example, if the hematocrit of the autologous blood obtained from the extracorporeal circuit is 30, these ratios would result in a blood cardioplegia with a hematocrit of approximately 27, 24, and 20, respectively.

The use of undiluted blood cardioplegia, or "miniplegia" (using a minimum amount of crystalloid additives), also has been reported to be effective. Petrucci et al studied the use of all-blood miniplegia in a clinically relevant swine preparation and compared miniplegia with crystalloid cardioplegia. They concluded that the use of all-blood miniplegia was effective or superior in the acutely ischemic heart.98 Velez and colleagues used an acute ischemia/reperfusion canine preparation to test the hypothesis that an all-blood cardioplegia in 66:1 blood:crystalloid ratio would provide superior protection compared with a 4:1 blood cardioplegia delivered in a continuous retrograde fashion.<sup>99</sup> They found very little difference between the animal groups with respect to infarct size or postischemic recovery of function. This is consistent with the findings by Rousou and colleagues years earlier; that, it is the level of hypothermia that is important in blood cardioplegia not necessarily the hematocrit. 100

With respect to efficacy, there are numerous preclinical studies and nonrandomized and randomized clinical trials that demonstrate cold blood cardioplegia is an effective way to provide excellent myocardial protection. Many of these same studies have suggested that cold blood cardioplegia is superior to cold crystalloid cardioplegia. It is important to note that other investigators have shown crystalloid cardioplegia to be as cardioprotective and cost-effective if not more so. Unfortunately, most contemporary clinical trials comparing the efficacy of blood cardioplegia with crystalloid cardioplegia have involved single-center studies, enrolled a limited number of patients, focused on a specific subset of patients and/or omitted details regarding clinical management. In 2006, Guru et al reported the results of a meta-analysis of 34 clinical trials that compared blood cardioplegia to crystalloid cardioplegia. A lower incidence of low cardiac output syndrome and CK-MB release was observed in patients administered blood cardioplegia; no difference, however, was observed in the incidence of perioperative MI or mortality. 101 Jacob et al (2008) analyzed clinical data from 15 randomized trials. Although eight of the trials reported statistically significant outcomes favoring blood cardioplegia, and five showed differences in enzyme release, the bulk of the evidence favoring one over the other was inconclusive.95

In 2014, Zeng performed a meta-analysis of 12 randomized control trials in which cold blood cardioplegia was compared to cold crystalloid cardioplegia. The trials accounted for 2866 patients: 1357 received cold crystalloid cardioplegia; 1509 received cold blood cardioplegia. The analysis showed no significant differences in mortality risk, incidence of fibrillation or stroke. The incidence of perioperative MI was lower however in the patients receiving cold blood cardioplegia. Regardless, the authors concluded that both crystalloid and cold blood cardioplegia are safe and effective for revascularization. The limitations of the study include the inherent

problems associated with meta-analyses, and mortality was assessed only at the end of 30 days.

## Warm Blood Cardioplegia

The concept of using warm (normothermic) blood cardioplegia as a cardioprotective strategy dates back to the 1980s. Proponents held that warm blood cardioplegic solutions would provide nutrients and endogenous factors that were absent in crystalloid solutions, and that normothermia would avoid possible adverse consequences of hypothermia. In 1982, Rosenkranz and colleagues reported that warm induction with normothermic blood cardioplegia, followed by maintenance of arrest with multi-dose cold blood cardioplegia, resulted in better recovery of function in canines than a similar protocol using cold blood induction. 103 In 1986, Teoh and colleagues provided experimental evidence that a terminal infusion of warm blood cardioplegia before removing the cross-clamp (a "hot shot") accelerated myocardial metabolic recovery.<sup>104</sup> This was followed by a report in 1991 by Lichtenstein and colleagues that normothermic blood cardioplegia in humans is an effective cardioprotective approach.86 They compared the results of 121 consecutive patients undergoing CABG surgery who received antegrade normothermic blood cardioplegia to a historical group of 133 patients who received antegrade hypothermic blood cardioplegia. The operative mortality in the warm cardioplegic group was 0.9% compared with 2.2% for the historical controls. Despite these encouraging reports, there are concerns that for any given patient, it is difficult to determine how long a warm heart can tolerate an ischemic insult if the infusion is interrupted or flow rates are reduced owing to an obscured surgical field or maldistribution of the cardioplegic solution. Another concern is the report by Martin and colleagues that warm cardioplegia is associated with an increased incidence of neurologic deficits.<sup>52</sup> In a prospective, randomized study conducted in 1001 patients, the efficacy of continuous warm blood cardioplegia with systemic normothermia (≥35°C) versus intermittent cold oxygenated crystalloid cardioplegia and moderate systemic hypothermia (≤28°C) were compared. While operative mortalities were similar (1.0 vs 1.6%, respectively), the incidence of permanent neurologic deficits was threefold greater in the warm blood normothermic group (3.1 vs 1.0%). Thus in this studywarm blood cardioplegia offered no advantage over cold crystalloid cardioplegia in terms of myocardial protection and carried with it the risk of increased ischemic injury if the oxygen supply to the warm heart was interrupted.

In 2014, DeBryn and colleagues performed a retrospective review of a prospectively collated database to compare the relative efficacies of using either antegrade warm blood cardioplegia (32°C) or antegrade cold crystalloid cardioplegia (7°C). The database included patient demographics, preoperative risk factors, operative technique, postoperative course and 30-day, in-hospital morbidity and mortality. The first 150 patients received cold crystalloid cardioplegia; the second group of 143 patients received cold blood cardioplegia.

Overall the investigators found the clinical outcome for the patients was comparable and concluded that while warm blood cardioplegia is safe; it did not confer superior protection. Thus it appears that appropriately designed protocols using intermittent antegrade warm blood cardioplegia provide clinically acceptable myocardial protection. <sup>106-108</sup>

## Tepid Blood Cardioplegia

Both cold blood (4-10°C) and warm blood cardioplegic solutions (37°C) have temperature-related advantages and disadvantages. As a consequence, a number of studies were performed in the 1990s to determine the optimal temperature. Hayashida and colleagues were one of the first groups to study the efficacy of tepid blood (29°C) cardioplegia. 109 In this study, 72 patients undergoing CABG were randomized to receive cold (8°C) antegrade or retrograde, tepid (29°C) antegrade or retrograde, or warm (37°C) antegrade or retrograde blood cardioplegia. While protection was adequate for all three, the tepid antegrade cardioplegia was the most effective in reducing anaerobic lactate acid release during the arrest period. These authors reported similar findings when the tepid solution was delivered continuously retrograde and intermittently antegrade. 110 In contrast, Baretti et al reported in anesthetized open-chest swine placed on CPB that tepid normokalemic continuous antegrade blood cardioplegia was associated with an increased incidence of intermittent fibrillation.<sup>111</sup> Subsequent to this report Mallid et al, in a retrospective chart review, analyzed the effects of cold blood and warm or tepid blood cardioplegia on early and late outcomes in 6064 patients who underwent CABG surgery. In the patients receiving warm or tepid blood cardioplegia (n = 4532), the systemic temperature was maintained between 32 and 37°C. The temperature of warm blood cardioplegia was 37°C. In the tepid cardioplegia cohort the systemic temperature was allowed to drift between 32 and 34°C; the temperature of the tepid cardioplegia ranged between 28 and 30°C. In the cold blood cardioplegia cohort (n = 1532) the systemic temperature was maintained between 25 and 32°C; the temperature of the blood cardioplegia ranged between 5 and 8°C. At 5 years, actuarial survival was 91.1% in the warm cardioplegia group and 89.9% in the cold blood cardioplegia group (p = .09). While this study has all the limitations associated with a large retrospective chart review conducted over the course of a decade, the findings are consistent with the basic conclusion that current methods of cardioplegia all show similar degrees of efficacy. To date, most tepid blood cardioplegia studies have been single-center studies conducted in relatively small cohorts of patients. Whether tepid cardioplegia confers superior protection over other methods remains to be determined. For the most part, however, the current methods of cardioplegia all show similar efficacy.

## Methods of Delivery

In addition to a variety of formulations and temperatures, there are also many different ways of administering the

cardioplegic solutions (Fig. 16-3). As one might expect with so many options, the optimal delivery method also remains controversial. The various methods include intermittent antegrade, antegrade via the graft, continuous antegrade, continuous retrograde, intermittent retrograde, antegrade followed by retrograde and simultaneous antegrade and retrograde infusions. While all methods appear to be similarly efficacious, comparisons across trials are difficult because the studies also have differed with respect to: (1) the composition of the solution; (2) the temperature of the solution; (3) the duration of the infusion; and, (4) the infusion pressure. Additional factors that affect a surgeon's choice for delivery method include the type and complexity of the operation and the anticipated cross-clamp time.

#### ANTEGRADE CARDIOPLEGIA

The most widely used method of delivering cardioplegic solutions is the antegrade method. It entails infusion of the solution into the aortic root while the ascending aorta is cross-clamped. After the initiation of CPB, chemical arrest can be achieved quickly with the infusion of the solution through a catheter inserted into the aorta proximal to the cross-clamp. The catheter may or may not be accompanied by a separate vent cannula to decompress the left ventricle between infusions. The induction dose usually has a higher concentration of potassium than subsequent maintenance doses. It is infused rapidly to ensure aortic valve closure usually at a rate of 250 to 300 mL/min (10 and 15 mL/kg body weight/min). If cardiac activity persists or recurs additional infusions may be necessary. For maintenance, infusions can be administered at 15 to 20 minute intervals or as needed. Concurrent external cooling can be achieved by suffusion with cold saline (4°C).

The typical aortic root perfusion pressure is maintained between 60 mm Hg and 80 mm Hg. Adjustments in rates of administration are made to accommodate patients with hypertrophied ventricles. Intermittent maintenance doses of 300 to 500 mL of low-dose cardioplegia are administered every 15 to 20 minutes or earlier if there is evidence of resumption of electrical activity. During CABG surgery, in order to minimize cold ischemia and aortic cross clamp

time, the heart can be reperfused earlier by removal of the aortic cross-clamp as soon as the distal anastomoses are completed; the proximal anastomoses are then performed using a partial occlusion clamp. Alternatively the proximal grafts can be performed after the distal grafts have been completed with the cross-clamp still in place (the single-clamp technique).

The administration of antegrade cardioplegia depends on a competent aortic valve and hence is liable to be ineffective and relatively contraindicated in patients with significant aortic valve incompetence. In such cases, antegrade cardioplegia can be administered directly into the coronary arteries via cannulation of the individual coronary ostium. This technique is used in cases requiring the opening of the ascending aorta such as in aortic valve replacement, ascending aortic aneurysm repair and aortic root replacement procedures. Coronary ostial infusion may be necessary for induction in patients with severe aortic incompetence in the presence of coronary sinus pacing leads. Potential complications include coronary dissection, unintentional selective delivery into left anterior descending or left circumflex artery due to a short left main coronary artery, and the late occurrence of coronary ostial stenosis. 112

#### RETROGRADE CARDIOPLEGIA

Retrograde cardioplegia entails placement of a coronary sinus catheter with or without a self-inflating silicone cuff and infusion of the cardioplegic solution either for induction or maintenance of cardioplegia. This approach originated with a concept developed by Pratt in 1898, who suggested that oxygenated blood could be supplied to the ischemic heart via the coronary venous system. 113 Sixty years later, Lillehei and colleagues used retrograde coronary sinus perfusion to protect the heart during aortic valve surgery. 76 Today, it is an accepted method for delivering a cardioplegic solution and is used frequently as an adjunct to antegrade cardioplegia. Placement of the catheter is often facilitated by the use of catheters that are precurved and the simultaneous use of transesophageal echocardiography to guide placement. Care must be taken to avoid rupture of the coronary sinus, an uncommon but real and potentially fatal complication. This can be prevented by infusing the solution at a rate that ensures that the coronary sinus perfusion pressure does not exceed 45 to 50 mm Hg. The retrograde approach can be used for continuous or intermittent delivery of blood or crystalloid cardioplegia as well. In situations where the native coronary arteries are severely stenotic or totally occluded, the antegrade approach may result in an uneven distribution in the myocardium. In this situation retrograde infusion or infusion via the vein grafts as they are completed can be complementary. While most routine on-pump cardiac procedures can be done with good outcomes using just the antegrade technique, patients with poor ventricular function, high-risk patients requiring long aortic cross clamp times and those with occlusive coronary disease may benefit from a dual approach, that is, both antegrade and retrograde techniques. Another advantage to the retrograde technique is that it may be effective in reducing the risk of embolization from saphenous vein grafts that could occur

during antegrade perfusion for reoperative coronary artery bypass surgery. The retrograde approach also has the theoretical advantage of ensuring a more homogeneous distribution of the cardioplegic solution to regions of the heart that are poorly collateralized.

Despite these advantages, retrograde cardioplegia is not without its limitations. There are experimental and clinical studies which suggest that cardioplegia administered via the coronary sinus results in a suboptimal distribution of cardioplegia to the right ventricle. This is due in part to the anterior region of the right ventricle being poorly drained by the coronary sinus, the marked variability in venous anatomy, the frequency of coronary sinus anomalies and the Thebesian veins draining directly into the cavities of the heart. As a consequence a number of studies have been performed to evaluate not only the safety and efficacy of the retrograde approach but also to compare its efficacy to a combined antegrade/retrograde approach.114-117 While the findings have been mixed, most of results have shown that retrograde delivery of cardioplegic solutions is safe and effective during cardiac surgery. Taking a different approach, Bhaya et al compared the efficacy of an antegrade approach with an integrated antegrade/ retrograde method in patients undergoing on pump heart surgery using three-dimensional transthoracic speckle tracking echocardiography. 118 Twenty-two patients were studied one day prior to surgery and 4 to 5 days after the operation. They found that the integrated approach conferred better protection in terms of maintenance of strain parameters in segments of the septum and free wall of the left ventricular free wall and septum. These findings support the general consensus that a combined approach allows for a more reliable homogeneous distribution of cardioplegic solutions. The combined approach may be most relevant when it is anticipated that the cross-clamp time will be long and/or when the coronary artery stenoses are particularly extensive and severe.

## CONTINUOUS CARDIOPLEGIA VERSUS INTERMITTENT CARDIOPLEGIA

To minimize the interruption of coronary flow during aortic cross-clamping, cardioplegia can be administered continuously using a retrograde coronary sinus catheter or cannulating the coronary ostia directly via an open aortic root. A continuous infusion, especially if it is oxygenated, has the theoretical advantage of minimizing ischemia particularly during periods of prolonged aortic cross-clamping. One of the first studies to test this assumption was by Louagie and colleagues. 119 Seventy patients undergoing CABG surgery were prospectively randomized to receive retrograde cold blood cardioplegia either intermittently (n = 35) or in a continuous fashion (n = 35). Hemodynamic measurements included right ventricular ejection fraction, cardiac output, left and right ventricular stroke work index and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance. Coronary sinus blood samples were obtained before aortic cross-clamping and immediately after unclamping for the measurement of lactate and hypoxanthine levels; venous blood samples were collected at predetermined times to measure CK-MB and troponin levels.

Overall, they found a trend for better hemodynamics and a lower use of inotropic agents and significantly lower lactate and hypoxanthine levels in the patients who received continuous retrograde cardioplegia. On the other hand there were no differences in patient outcomes, and the CK-MB and troponin levels were comparable postoperatively. Given this was a single-center study, the surgery was performed by the same surgeon, and the relatively small sample size, it is difficult to extrapolate the findings to the general population of patients undergoing cardioplegic surgery with aortic cross-clamping. To date it remains unclear as to whether continuously administered cardioplegia is superior to intermittent cardioplegia. The major advantage of using intermittent cardioplegia is the ability to achieve and sustain a dry, quiescent operative field. Moreover, continuous cardioplegia still necessitates interruption of the surgical steps while the infusion is delivered.

## Current Status of Cardioplegic Technique

In summary, controversy persists as to whether blood cardioplegia or crystalloid cardioplegia is better, which temperature is ideal and what is the best method of delivery. A survey of practice patterns in the United Kingdom in 2004 showed that 56% of all cardioplegia on-pump surgery was performed with cold blood cardioplegia; whereas, warm blood cardioplegia was used in 14% of cases. 120 In the same survey, 14% of surgeons used crystalloid cardioplegia, 21% used retrograde cardioplegia and 16% did not use any cardioplegia, preferring to use cross-clamp fibrillation only. Based on these observations and experiences in the United States, it appears that most surgeons favor cold intermittent blood cardioplegia. Nevertheless a wide spectrum of variation exists among heart centers; there is no international consensus regarding the ideal cardioplegic solution or its use. 120 Awareness of the options allows the surgeon to utilize the best approach that meets the individual needs of the patient.

## Noncardioplegic Technique

Intermittent cross-clamping with fibrillation (ICCF) and systemic hypothermia with intermittent elective fibrillatory arrest are the most common forms of noncardioplegic heart surgery used today. The objective is to provide a relatively quiescent surgical field without having to arrest the heart with a cardioplegic solution.

## Intermittent Aortic Cross-Clamping with Fibrillation

This technique is the earliest method developed to protect the heart during surgery and is still used at many centers. The patient is placed on CPB, the ascending aorta is cannulated and generally a dual-stage single-venous cannula is used. Often the patient is cooled to 30 to 32°C; this technique allows the surgeon to operate in a relatively quiet but not quiescent field during ventricular fibrillation. In the setting of CABG surgery, the aortic cross-clamp is removed intermittently after the

completion of each graft. The duration of fibrillation is determined by how long it takes to perform the distal anastomosis. After completion of the revascularization, the heart is defibrillated and the proximal anastomoses performed on the beating heart using an aortic partial occlusion clamp. This technique is particularly useful in patients with cold agglutinin disease, an autoimmune phenomenon in which antibody directly agglutinates human red cells at low temperatures. In these patients open heart operations with hypothermia carry the risk of red cell agglutination and may result in hemolysis, MI, renal insufficiency and cerebral damage.

As a result of increasing pressures to reduce cost and yet maintain acceptable levels of cardioprotection, there remains an interest in using this approach. There are a number of reports which indicate that satisfactory protection can be conferred using this technique. In 1992, Bonchek et al reported a large clinical series in which the advantages and safety of this technique were meticulously analyzed.<sup>121</sup> In this study, the authors reviewed the outcomes of the first 3000 patients at their institution who underwent primary CABG using ICCF. Preoperative risk factors, for example, age, gender, left ventricular dysfunction, preoperative use of the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), the urgency of operation and operative deaths were analyzed. In this series, 29% of the patients were older than 70 years of age, 27% were females, 9.7% had an ejection fraction of less than 0.30, 13% had an MI less than 1 week preoperatively and 31% had preinfarction angina in the hospital; only 26% underwent purely elective operations. Using the noncardioplegic cardioprotective technique, the authors reported an elective operative mortality rate of 0.5%, an urgent mortality rate of 1.7% and an emergency rate of 2.3%. Postoperatively, inotropic support was needed in only 6.6% of the patients, and only 1% required insertion of the IABP. It is important to note however that this was a retrospective, single-center institutional experience. The findings would have been enhanced if the analysis had included a similarly matched group of patients at the same institution in which cardioplegic arrest had been employed. Nevertheless the findings support the perspective that noncardioplegic strategies can provide satisfactory myocardial protection even in high-risk patients.

In 2002, Raco and colleagues reported their experience in 800 consecutive CABG operations performed by a single surgeon using ICCF in both elective and nonelective settings. The patients were divided into three cohorts: (1) elective; (2) urgent; and, (3) emergent. Among these cohorts the mean age, number of distal grafts and mortality among the three groups was comparable. The mortality rate in the elective, urgent and emergent groups was 0.6%, 3.1%, and 5.6%, respectively, and consistent with outcomes associated with cardioplegic surgery. Since this report reflects the experience of a single surgeon, there is the concern that the technique may not be generally applicable. Regardless, the findings do support the notion that ICCF is a safe technique for both elective and nonelective patients undergoing CABG surgery. 122-124 In 2003, Bonchek et al reported their experience in 8300 patients who underwent CABG surgery without cardioplegia. The unadjusted mortality rates in

elective, urgent and emergent patients was 0.9%, 1.5%, and 4.0%, respectively. The overall mortality of 1.7%, was considerably lower than the 3.27% predicted based on the Society of Thoracic Surgeons National Database model. 125 This experience represented the work of five surgeons, three of whom had not been trained in noncardioplegic surgery; it provides additional evidence that ICCF is an effective form of cardioprotection. Evidence that the cardioprotective effects of ischemic preconditioning (IPC) may contribute to the efficacy of ICCF in the human heart has resulted in an interest in using this method of protection especially in the United Kingdom. Results in animal studies indicate that the protective effect of ICCF is blocked by protein-kinase C inhibitors and K<sub>ATP</sub> channel antagonists, both of which have been implicated in the signaling pathways involved in IPC. 126 Regardless of the mechanism underlying the protection, there are numerous reports which indicate that noncardioplegic strategies such as ICCF can provide satisfactory myocardial protection even in high-risk patients. 127

# Systemic Hypothermia and Elective Fibrillatory Arrest

Elective fibrillatory arrest is another safe approach to protect the heart during noncardioplegic heart surgery. The use of systemic hypothermia (26-30°C) and maintenance of systemic perfusion pressure between 80 and 100 mm Hg are key elements. This approach is particularly applicable in the setting of the severely calcified "porcelain aorta," where clamping the aorta may be associated with increased risk of stroke and aortic dissection. Under these circumstances the distal anastomoses are performed locally occluding the coronary artery using vascular clamps or sutures. The proximal anastomoses can be completed during short periods of hypothermic circulatory arrest. Alternatively the proximal anastomoses can be based entirely on an in situ internal thoracic artery. Using this approach one can avoid manipulation of the aorta altogether. Akins and colleagues, in 1984, reported a low incidence of perioperative MI and a low hospital mortality rate in 500 consecutive patients using this technique.84 In 1987, Akins and Carroll assessed the late results of hypothermic fibrillatory arrest in 1000 consecutive patients undergoing nonemergent CABG surgery. They concluded that the technique is effective and yields excellent event-free survival. Potential disadvantages include (1) the surgical field may be obscured as a result of existing collateral circulation; (2) ventricular fibrillation may be associated with increased muscular tone and thus compromise the surgeon's ability to position the heart for optimal exposure; (3) aortic valvular regurgitation may be exacerbated; and (4) it is generally not applicable for intracardiac procedures. An advantage with the technique is that it can be used when aortic occlusion or cardioplegic arrest is undesirable, for example, in the setting of a calcified ascending aorta. This approach can also be used in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery. 128 Imanaka et al, in 2003, published a retrospective observational study in which mitral valve surgery was performed in 27 patients with ischemic mitral regurgitation using perfused ventricular fibrillation.

Concomitant procedures included CABG in 23 patients and the Dor procedure in five patients. Surgery was performed using moderate hypothermia (~28°C) and fibrillatory arrest; flow rates on bypass were maintained at 2.4 L/min/m² and the perfusion pressure was 70 mm Hg. Among these select patients the mortality rate was 3.7%. The authors concluded that extended periods of ventricular fibrillation during hypothermic surgery can be well-tolerated without excessive morbidity and mortality and is appropriate in patients in whom aortic cross-clamping is unsuitable or the duration of cross-clamping is expected to be long. 129

# Strategies for Cardioprotection under Investigation

There are currently a number of physiological processes and pharmacological agents known to confer protection against I/R injury in the experimental setting. Several clinical trials are underway to determine the relevance of these new approaches. The purpose of this section is to review the cardioprotective strategies that are being examined and hold promise for the future.

## **Physiological Processes**

#### ISCHEMIC PRECONDITIONING

"Preconditioning with ischemia is an endogenous adaptive phenomenon whereby the heart becomes more tolerant to a period of prolonged ischemia if first exposed to brief episodes of coronary artery occlusion. This adaptation to ischemia was first described by Murry and colleagues and is now referred to as 'classic,' 'first window' or 'early phase' ischemic preconditioning (IPC).85 IPC is associated with a reduction in infarct size, apoptosis, and reperfusion-associated arrhythmias and has been demonstrated in every animal species studied to date. It lasts for as long as 1 to 2 hours after the preconditioning stimulus. 130-132 It is ineffective when the sustained ischemic insult lasts for more than 3 hours; thus, protection is conferred only when the sustained ischemia is followed by timely reperfusion. Subsequent studies have revealed that this endogenous defense mechanism manifests itself in several ways. After the acute phase of preconditioning disappears, a second phase of protection appears 24 hours later and is sustained for up to 72 hours. This is referred to as the 'second window of protection,' 'late-phase' preconditioning, or 'delayed' preconditioning. Late phase preconditioning protects against MI and stunning unlike classic IPC which only protects against infarction."133,134

Cellular Mechanisms Underlying IPC. Reports of adaptation to ischemia led to major investigative efforts to elucidate the intracellular mechanism(s) underlying the heart's endogenous defenses against I/R injury. The assumption was, and still is today, that a better understanding of these mechanism(s) would lead to the development of potent new therapeutic modalities that would be more effective in treating or preventing the deleterious consequences of I/R injury.

One of the earliest hypotheses was that the primary mediator of IPC was the activation of the adenosine  $A_1$  and/or  $A_3$  receptors on the cardiomyocyte. Subsequent studies have shown that in addition to adenosine, there are multiple guanine nucleotide-binding (G) protein-coupled receptors that once activated can mimic the infarct-sparing effect of ischemic preconditioning. These include bradykinin, endothelin,  $\alpha_1$ -adrenergic, muscarinic, angiotensin II, and delta-opioid receptors (Fig. 16-4). The infusion of exogenous agents to

mimic ischemic preconditioning is referred to as pharmacologic preconditioning. Exactly which of these receptors is the most important in mediating endogenous preconditioning is unknown because there appear to be species differences and redundant signaling pathways. Regardless, it is now thought that these triggers of IPC result in activation of various tyrosine kinases, isoforms of PKC, p38 mitogenactivated protein kinases and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs)]. P38 mitogen-activated protein kinases

Numerous triggers (opioids, bradykinin, and adenosine) and intracellular signaling pathways are involved in the cardioprotection conferred by IPC. The signal transduction pathways are complex, interactive, and include the HB-EGF receptor, PI3K, Akt, ERK1/2, eNOS, PKG, the opening of the mK<sub>ATP</sub> channel, ROS production, PKC activation, p70 S6 kinase, and GSK-3β. Possible end effectors of IPC include the opening of the mK<sub>ATP</sub> channel and inhibition of the mitochondrial transition pore opening. If only a few mitochondria are affected, cytochrome c may be released and induce apoptosis and cause cell death at a later time. Recent evidence suggests a unique role for the adenosine A2b receptor when activated at the time of reperfusion. While the process of autophagy has been implicated in IPC-induced cardioprotection where and how this process interacts with the signaling pathways remains to be determined.

are a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that are responsive to various stress stimuli cytokines, include heat shock protein, and are involved in cell differentiation, apopand autophagy. The ERK cascade couples signals from cell surface receptors to transcription factors which regulate gene expression.

Interestingly, IPC-induced cardioprotection appears to require repopulation of receptors and activation (or, in some instances, reactivation) of "pro-survival" kinases upon relief of sustained ischemia. In this regard, Hausenloy and Yellon introduced the term "Reperfusion Injury Salvage Kinase" (RISK) pathway to represent the PI3K-Akt and ERK1/2 prosurvival kinases activated at the time of reperfusion and proposed that manipulation and upregulation of the RISK pathway may represent another approach to myocardial protection. 136

While the identity of the end effector(s) of IPC remain speculative, significant evidence has accumulated indicating that the cardiomyocyte mitochondria are key targets of conditioning-induced protection (Fig. 16-4). 137,138 Specifically, inhibition of mPTP and the opening of the mitochondrial  $K_{ATP}$  (m $K_{ATP}$ ) channels have been implicated as the effectors of IPC.  $^{139,140}$  Under normal conditions the mitochondrial inner membrane is impermeable to most metabolites and ions, and the mPTP is closed. While the molecular structure of the pore has yet to be determined, it is characterized by the formation of a large conductance megachannel, which is regulated by cyclophilin D in the matrix. 140a While early investigations implicated the voltage-dependent anion channel in the outer mitochondrial membrane and the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) in the inner membrane in addition to cyclophilin D, genetic studies have refuted that model. Mouse models in which all ANT isoforms were deleted still exhibited mPTP opening; this was also the case for deletion of voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) isoforms. However, deletion of cyclophilin D resulted in hearts that were much more resistant to I/R injury, and further studies revealed that although the threshold for mPTP opening was greatly increased, it was still possible to trigger pore opening. It was concluded that cyclophilin D plays an important regulatory role in mPTP opening, but the molecular composition of the pore remains uncertain. Under conditions of stress, the mPTP may open resulting in depolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane and an influx of water and ions into the matrix due to its high oncotic pressure. Matrix swelling expands the highly folded inner membrane but ultimately ruptures the outer membrane resulting in release of cytochrome c and other proapoptotic factors. Even in the absence of outer membrane rupture, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential results in ATP hydrolysis by the F<sub>0</sub>-F<sub>1</sub> ATP synthase in a futile effort to restore membrane potential, thereby accelerating energy depletion.

An ATP-sensitive potassium channel in the mitochondrial inner membrane ( $mK_{ATP}$ ) has been implicated on the basis of pharmacologic effects of diazoxide and pinacidil (channel openers) and 5-hydroxydecanoate and glibenclamide (channel closers). Many pharmacologic studies have demonstrated

a protective role for the putative  $mK_{ATP}$ , although its molecular composition also remains unknown. Garg and Hu have proposed that PKC activation enhances the import of plasma membrane  $K_{ATP}$  channels into mitochondria. This was based on their observation that in COS-7 cells, Kir6.2 protein (a subunit of  $K_{ATP}$  channels) and channel activity increased in mitochondria after PMA treatment, and this increase was inhibited by the selective PKC inhibitor chelerythrine. Pharmacologically triggered opening of the  $mK_{ATP}$  channel has been shown to reduce calcium overload, mitochondrial ROS production, swelling, and to preserve ATP levels after ischemia/reperfusion.

While early-phase preconditioning shares many of the same signaling mechanisms with late-phase preconditioning, the most obvious difference between the two is the apparent requirement for protein synthesis in the latter. Late-phase IPC has been shown to be associated with the upregulation of various proteins including but not limited to heat-shock proteins, inducible NOS (iNOS), cyclooxygenase 2, hemeoxygenase and manganese superoxide dismutase. Heat-shock are however conflicting reports on what specific proteins are upregulated during late-phase preconditioning, which may be due to species differences as well as stimulus-specific responses.

Clinical Relevance of IPC. There is evidence that ischemic preconditioning occurs in the human being. Investigators have reported that patients experiencing angina prior to an MI have a better in-hospital prognosis and a reduced incidence of cardiogenic shock, fewer and less severe episodes of congestive heart failure and smaller infarcts as assessed by cardiac enzyme release.144 Moreover, follow-up studies suggest that patients who have had angina prior to an infarct have better long-term survival rates. 145-147 There are also a myriad of reports that patients who undergo PCIs have an enhanced tolerance to ischemia after the first balloon inflation provided that the first balloon inflation exceeds 60 to 90 seconds. 131 Chest pain severity, regional wall motion abnormalities, STsegment elevation, QT dispersion, lactate production and CK-MB release all have been reported to be attenuated in this setting as well.148,149

In patients undergoing PCI, a preconditioning-like effect has been mimicked by the administration of a variety of pharmacologic agents that are known to induce preconditioning in animal studies. For example, the administration of adenosine prior to PCI has been reported to attenuate myocardial ischemic indices during the first balloon inflation. Administration of other agents, such as bradykinin and nicorandil (a K<sub>ATP</sub> channel opener), also have been reported to produce similar effects. Si, 251, 152 Conversely the administration of aminophylline (a nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist), glibenclamide (a K<sub>ATP</sub> channel blocker), or naloxone (an opioid receptor blocker) reportedly abolish the effects of ischemic preconditioning during PCI. Additional studies provide evidence of delayed pharmacologic preconditioning in the clinical setting. Leesar and colleagues reported that a 4-hour intravenous infusion of nitroglycerin (an NO donor)

24 hours prior to PCI decreased ST-segment, changed and reduced chest pain during the first balloon occlusion compared with patients treated with saline vehicle. The arrival preconditioning with nitroglycerin decreased exercise-induced ST-segment changes and improved exercise tolerance. Thus there are observational studies that support the hypothesis that myocardial protection conferred by ischemic preconditioning and its possible mediators in animal studies is translatable to humans. It is important to note however that classic or early ischemic preconditioning observed in animals is associated with a reduction in infarct size, but not protection against stunning, and that many of the clinical studies are either retrospective in nature or have used surrogate markers of injury as end points.

With respect to a role for IPC during cardiac surgery, numerous small trials have been conducted. 156 One of the first studies was conducted by Yellon and colleagues in patients undergoing CABG surgery.<sup>157</sup> Patients were subjected to a protocol that involved two cycles of 3 minutes of global ischemia. The aorta was cross-clamped intermittently and the heart was paced at 90 beats per minute to induce ischemia. This was followed by 2 minutes of reperfusion before a 10-minute period of global ischemia and ventricular fibrillation. Myocardial biopsies were obtained during the 10-minute period of global ischemia, and ATP tissue content was measured. The results showed that the ATP levels in the biopsies obtained from patients subjected to the preconditioning-like protocol were higher. However, since ATP content is not a marker of necrosis, a follow-up study was performed, and troponin T serum levels were measured. In this study the investigators reported that troponin release was attenuated in the patients subjected to the preconditioning protocol. In 2002, Teoh and colleagues reported that IPC conferred myocardial protection beyond that provided by intermittent cross-clamp fibrillation in patients undergoing CABG.<sup>89</sup> While other investigators reported similar findings, most of these studies have involved small numbers of patients.

In 2008, Walsh et al reported the results of a meta-analysis of the available small trials to determine the effect of IPC on patient outcomes.<sup>156</sup> They identified 22 eligible trials encompassing 933 patients; there were 374 patients in the IPC cohort and 402 patients served as controls. Twenty of the trials followed a protocol that involved aortic cross-clamping, and two involved coronary artery occlusion. The primary endpoint was perioperative mortality; the secondary endpoints included incidence of postoperative ventricular arrhythmias and MIs, the need for postoperative inotropic support and stroke. While the results suggested IPC was associated with a reduction in the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias, inotropic requirements and admissions to the critical care units and the incidence of perioperative MI and death was the same between the two cohorts. The investigators were appropriately cautious in the interpretation of the data considering the many caveats including bias and heterogeneity in relation to the endpoints. Given the low mortality rate in both groups,

the study was markedly underpowered to discern an effect on the primary endpoint, that is, death.

Thus despite a number of surgical studies that suggest IPC is effective in the setting of aortic cross-clamping and the administration of cardioplegia, it is important to note that the total number of patients studied to date is relatively small, and the outcomes have been limited to surrogate markers of myocardial necrosis, viz., CK-MB levels and troponin release and not definitive endpoints such as perioperative MI and death. In addition to the inherent risk of neurological complications associated with manipulation of the ascending aorta, the absence of compelling clinical outcomes may explain why IPC has not been adopted as an adjuvant approach among the myocardial protection techniques employed to date. A more promising strategy may evolve however once a better understanding of the intracellular events and effectors that confer protection have been elucidated.

**Postconditioning.** The phenomenon of ischemic "postconditioning" (PostCond) was first reported by Zhao et al in the canine model.<sup>158</sup> The term refers to rapid intermittent interruptions of blood flow in the early phase of reperfusion, that is, relief of ischemia in a stuttered or staccato manner. While the cellular mechanisms underlying PostCond are poorly defined, they appear to involve many of the same signal transduction pathways that are involved in IPC including cell surface receptor signaling, prosurvival kinases, inhibition of mPTP and activation of the mK<sub>ATP</sub> channel. Although the duration and frequency of ischemia/reperfusion cycles may differ across studies, for the most part the cycles that induce PostCond are measured in seconds in smaller species and slightly longer in larger animals and humans, justifying the name "stuttering reperfusion." The reduction in infarct size appears to be comparable to that observed with IPC. Preclinical studies conducted in multiple models and species (including dog, rat, rabbit, mouse, and pig) have demonstrated a reduction in infarct size that ranges from 20 to 70%. The restoration of blood flow in a stuttering manner during early reperfusion is of major interest to clinicians since it holds particular promise for patients presenting with an acute MI. In the surgical setting PostCond could be applied in the operating room after release of the aortic cross-clamp.

Evidence that PostCond exists in humans was first reported in patients undergoing PCI. Patients receiving brief balloon inflations/deflations in the initial minutes of reperfusion during PCI exhibited smaller ST-segment changes and lower levels of total creatine kinase release compared with patients that were not subjected to stuttering reperfusion. In 2007, Darling et al conducted a retrospective chart review in patients undergoing emergent cardiac catheterization for ST segment elevation MI (STEMI).<sup>159</sup> The hypothesis was that outcome would be better in patients undergoing multiple balloon inflations after primary angioplasty. Patients were divided into two cohorts: those who, at the discretion of the interventional cardiologist, received one to three balloon inflations and those in whom four or more inflations were applied. In this retrospective analysis, peak CK release was less in patients requiring ≥4 inflations. In a separate study

by Lønborg et al, the cardioprotective effects of PostCond in patients treated with PCI was evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These investigators reported that mechanical PostCond appeared to be independent of the size of myocardium at risk. The findings were consistent with the concept that stuttering reperfusion confers cardioprotection during percutaneous interventions.

In the context of heart surgery, Luo reported a beneficial effect of surgical PostCond in 24 patients undergoing repair for tetralogy of Fallot at the time of aortic declamping. The postconditioning protocol consisted of aortic reclamping for 30 seconds and declamping for 30 seconds; the process was repeated twice. The intervention was reported to reduce perioperative troponin-T and CK-MB release and decreased the need for inotropic support after surgery. 161 A similar finding was reported by the same investigator in a study of adult patients undergoing valve surgery and children undergoing corrective surgery using cardioplegia. Thus there is evidence that a PostCond protocol may benefit patients undergoing heart surgery, albeit the majority of studies suggesting a beneficial effect have been conducted in the setting of percutaneous interventions. While PostCond may offer more promise than IPC in terms of clinical application, it is important to note that both are invasive in nature. Ideally, the elucidation of the cellular mechanisms underlying ischemic conditioning will lead to pharmacological approaches that would obviate the need for invasive approaches.

Remote Ischemic Preconditioning. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a phenomenon whereby brief ischemia of one organ or tissue confers protection on a distant naive organ or tissue against a sustained ischemia-reperfusion injury. RIPC was first described by Przyklenk and colleagues in 1993. 162 In the original study the investigators questioned whether IPC protected only heart cells exposed to brief coronary artery occlusions or was it possible that repetitive or stuttering occlusions in a remote naive vascular bed could reduce infarct size in the area subjected to prolonged ischemia. They used a canine preparation in which a branch of the circumflex coronary artery was subjected to four episodes of 5-minute occlusion and reperfusion; this was followed by 1-hour occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. After 4.5 hours of reflow, infarct size in the distribution of the LAD was measured. Indeed a marked reduction in infarct size was observed. Since then numerous other investigators have confirmed these findings, and the phenomenon has been observed in various species and with different organs. Brief occlusions of the renal and mesenteric arteries and brief restriction of blood flow to the skeletal muscle of the lower limb have also been reported to reduce myocardial infarct size. 163 As a consequence, RIPC is also referred to as inter-organ preconditioning.

Not surprisingly, multiple mechanisms trigger RIPC is signaled through neuronal signaling and multiple secreted factors (such as adenosine, bradykinin and calcitonin generelated peptide) followed by activation of multiple kinases including p38 mitogen-activated phosphokinase (p38 MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)

and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). One way by which the remote preconditioning signal may be conveyed to the target organ is through exosomes. These membrane-bound nanoparticles contain proteins, mitochondrial RNAs (mRNAs) and microRNAs which are taken up by target cells and elicit a response. <sup>164</sup> As with many other cardioprotective interventions, lack of a clear understanding of the molecular basis of the phenomenon has not dampened the enthusiasm for applying the approach clinically.

One of the first studies involving surgery was conducted in 17 children undergoing congenital heart surgery with CPB. 165 Brief intermittent lower limb ischemia attenuated troponin release and the need for postoperative inotropic support. Hausenloy et al reported a similar finding in 57 patients undergoing CABG. 166 Patients were randomized to RIPC or no treatment; all patients also received cardioprotection by either intermittent cross-clamping or cardioplegia. Perioperative troponin-T release was reduced by 43% in the RIPC group. In another study involving 23 adult patients undergoing on-pump CABG surgery and cold blood cardioplegia, RIPC was associated with a 42% reduction in total troponin-T release. 167 In this study, RIPC was induced by three 5-minute cycles of right forearm ischemia by inflating a blood pressure cuff on the upper arm to 200 mm Hg with an intervening 5-minute reperfusion period; the control group had a deflated cuff placed on the upper arm for 30 minutes.

In 2013, Thielmann et al reported the results of a prospective single-center double-blind randomized controlled study in 329 CABG patients. Patients underwent surgery preceded by RIPC (n = 162) or not (n = 167). Patient demographics and perioperative data were comparable between the two groups. Postoperative troponin I levels were significantly lower in the RIPC group. At 4-year follow-up, all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events were less frequent; however, this did not reach significance because the study was underpowered, given the low mortality rate. This is one of the first studies to examine the clinical benefit of RIPC beyond the biochemical markers of myocardial damage. The findings parallel other studies of patients undergoing PCI electively or for ST-segment-elevation MI. 168,169 Not all studies have shown that RIPC improves clinical outcomes after surgery. To examine the effects of RIPC combined with remote ischemic PostCond (RIPostCond), Hong and colleagues prospectively randomized 1280 CABG surgery patients to receive RIPC plus RIPostCond or no conditioning.<sup>170</sup> The protocol consisted of four cycles of 5-minute ischemia and 5-minute reperfusion administered to the upper limb prior to initiating CPB and repeated after CPB. The primary endpoints were a reduction in major adverse events including MI, stroke and death. Treatment had no effect on mortality or the incidence of cardiac or neurological complications. Of concern, the subgroup of off-pump patients that received RIPC plus RIPost-Cond had an increase in composite adverse events, notably increased RBC transfusions. The impact of the study was limited by the heterogeneity of procedures and the exclusion of patients with poor ventricular function; however it did raise concern regarding clinical efficacy of RIPC and RIPostCond.

Taken altogether, these RIPC studies led to the RIPHeart Study and the ERRICA trial.

In the RIPHeart Study, the objective was to assess the efficacy of remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) in reducing the composite endpoint of death, MI, stroke or acute renal failure in patients undergoing CABG surgery. Patients were randomized to undergo RIPC (n=692) induced by four 5 min cycles of transient upper limb ischemia/reperfusion or a control group (n=693) receiving four cycles of blood pressure cuff inflation/deflation in an imitation arm. In this study RIPC treatment had no effect on the composite endpoint or on any of the subgroup analyses. The incidence of postoperative MI was similar for the two groups, viz., 6.8% in the RIPC arm and 9.1% in the placebo group.

The ERICCA Trial<sup>170b</sup> was a multicenter, sham-controlled study in which the clinical relevance of RIPC. Patients undergoing on-pump CABG with blood cardioplegia were randomized to a RIPC group (n=801) or a control group (n=811). RIPC was induced with four 5-minute inflations and deflations of a standard blood-pressure cuff on the upper arm prior to surgery. The combined endpoint was death from cardiovascular causes assessed at 12 months. In this study, RIPC had no effect on the primary endpoint or any of the secondary end points of perioperative myocardial injury. As a consequence of these studies, for now, it appears that RIPC will not become a therapeutic modality in the routine practice of cardiac surgery.

Conditioning by Stem Cells and Cell Products. While stem cells have been explored for treatment of tissue loss after MI or in the setting of chronic heart failure, most studies have focused on endpoints months to years out, based on the expectation that stem cells function by regenerating tissue. However, recent work suggests they may be beneficial in the acute setting.<sup>171</sup> Marbán and colleagues used cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) delivered via intracoronary infusion 30 minutes after onset of reperfusion in a porcine model of MI. They found that the CDC infusion resulted in lower troponin I levels at 24 hours and decreased infarct size and microvascular obstruction at 48 hours. In isolated perfused rat hearts, an infusion of mesenchymal stem cells pre-stimulated with transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha) before ischemia resulted in improved functional recover and reduced inflammation and cell death. 172 A conditioned medium from human mesenchymal stem cells was shown to reduce infarct size and improve function in pigs subjected to MI.<sup>173</sup> The same group subsequently showed that the active component of the conditioned medium was exosomes. 174 Exosomes derived from an immortalized allogenic stem cell line offer a number of advantages for clinical development including standardization of the material, longer shelf life and availability for all patients without the need for histocompatibility matching. Thus cell therapy may be eclipsed by exosomes, and both approaches hold promise for intraoperative myocardial protection.

Autophagy. In the heart, adaptive autophagy is an endogenous protective response to cardiac stress. It plays an important

role in cardiovascular disease, neurodegeneration, and cancer. Studies are now underway to harness its cardioprotective potential and, based on this process, develop effective cardioprotective therapies to protect the heart against I/R injury. Autophagy is the process whereby a double-membrane structure called the autophagosome sequesters cytoplasmic components such as ubiquitinated protein aggregates or organelles including mitochondria, peroxisomes and endoplasmic reticulum. It is involved in degradation of long-lived proteins and the removal of excess or damaged organelles. The outer autophagosomal membrane fuses with a lysosomal membrane, resulting in degradation of the cargo by lysosomal hydrolases; the resulting macromolecules are exported to the cytosol for reuse<sup>175</sup> (Fig. 16-5).

One of the first studies to suggest autophagy is an adaptive process responsive to stress in the heart was the report by Decker et al in which they noted an increase in degenerating mitochondria and autophagosomes in rabbit hearts subjected to hypoxia and reoxygenation.<sup>176</sup> Reperfusion restored contractility, and the injured myocytes underwent a cellular repair process that involved a marked increase in lysosomal autophagy. They concluded that autophagy was part of a repair response to hypoxic stress in the heart. Upregulation of autophagy has been described in cell models of hypoxia/reoxygenation and models of I/R injury in rodents and pigs. 177-185 Hamacher-Brady et al showed that upregulation of autophagy in HL-1 myocytes protected against cell death induced by simulated ischemia reperfusion (sI/R) whereas inhibition of autophagy-enhanced cell death.<sup>177</sup> Dosenko et al also found that inhibition of autophagy exacerbated cell death during anoxia-reoxygenation. 178 Matsui et al showed that glucose deprivation increased the number of autophagosomes in neonatal cardiac myocytes, whereas inhibiting autophagy enhanced cell death.<sup>179</sup> In a porcine model of chronic myocardial ischemia and hibernating myocardium, Yan et al reported that cardiac myocytes with enhanced autophagy were not apoptotic; in contrast, apoptotic cells did not show features of autophagy. 180 Collectively these studies suggest that upregulation of autophagy promotes survival during I/R.

There is now direct evidence that autophagy plays an important role in mediating ischemic and pharmacologic preconditioning. Using HL-1 cells and adult rat cardiomyocytes, Yitzhaki et al showed that the adenosine preconditioning agent 2-chloro-N(6)-cyclopentyladenosine (CCPA) upregulated autophagy within 10 minutes of adenosine treatment and inhibition of autophagy resulted in significant loss of cytoprotection against hypoxia/reoxygenation injury. Autophagy was also shown to be important for delayed preconditioning in this cell-based model. Multiple cardioprotective agents including CCPA, sulfaphenazole and chloramphenicol, as well as ischemic preconditioning, also upregulate autophagy in vivo. 182-185 Based on these findings, it appears that autophagy is an important mediator of protection in the heart.

Autophagy in the Human Heart. Delineating the role of impaired autophagy in heart patients is challenging because of the need to access tissue. One of the first studies to suggest

FIGURE 16-5 Cellular process of autophagy. Adapted from Gottlieb RA, Finley KD, Mentzer Jr RM: Cardioprotection requires taking out the trash. *Basic Res Cardiol* 2009; 104:169-180. I/R, ischemia/reperfusion; ROS, reactive oxygen species; RNS, reactive nitrogen species; mTor, mammalian target of rapamycin; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; LC3, light chain 3-phosphatidylethanolamine; Atg1, Atg4, Atg7, Atg12, Atg16L, autophagy regulating proteins; Vps34, a class III PI3 kinase involved in vesicular trafficking, nutrient signaling, and autophagy; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; 3MA, 3-methyladenine. Autophagy is a dynamic adaptive process in the setting of I/R injury. The process involves the synthesis of a cup-shaped pre-autophagosomal double-membrane structure which surrounds cytoplasmic material and closes to form an autophagosome. This process is regulated by the autophagy proteins Atg4, Atg7, LC3, and the complex of Atg12-Atg5-Atg16L. The process is activated by a number of stimuli including ROS or RNS. Induction by Beclin1 and Vps34 in conjunction with other Atg proteins results in the formation of an isolation membrane to which Atg proteins are recruited. Atg12-Atg5 and LC3 proteins are involved in the expansion of the membrane. This allows the phagophore to surround and engulf damaged organelles or protein aggregates which may accumulate as a result of I/R injury. The result is the formation an autophagosome. The green insert shows autophagosomes (green puncta). This photo was obtained in a cell expressing a fusion protein of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the N-terminus of LC3; the GFP-LC3 was incorporated into the double-membrane structure of the phagophore. Wortmannin and 3 MA are agents that can inhibit the initiation phase of autophagy; bafilomycin and chloroquine can inhibit the degradation phase.

that autophagy is an adaptive process in the human heart was the report by Kassiotis et al.<sup>186</sup> Biopsies of the left ventricle were obtained from nine patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy at the time of implantation and removal of left ventricular assist devices. Autophagy-related mRNAs and proteins were downregulated after prolonged circulatory support leading the authors to conclude that autophagy is an adaptive mechanism in the human heart. Garcia et al studied 170 patients who had undergone elective CABG and preoperatively were in normal sinus rhythm.<sup>187</sup> Intraoperative right atrial biopsies revealed that autophagic vesicles and lipofuscin deposits and biochemical markers of impaired autophagic flux were more commonly observed in the biopsies of the

patients who developed postoperative atrial fibrillation suggesting that loss of normal autophagic activity may increase the risk of postoperative arrhythmias. Jahania et al reported the results from 19 patients in which atrial biopsies were collected just prior to the onset of CPB and again after removal of aortic cross-clamp and weaning from CPB. Ischemic stress was associated with a significant depletion of autophagy-related proteins suggestive of a coordinated engagement of the autophagy machinery. <sup>188</sup> Consistent with this, Singh et al examined mRNA and protein in samples taken from right atrial appendages before cardioplegic arrest and after reperfusion. <sup>189</sup> I/R was associated with upregulation of several autophagy-related genes and biochemical evidence of

increased autophagy, leading the authors to conclude that I/R affects gene expression and posttranslational regulation of autophagy in the human heart. In contrast, Gedik et al<sup>190</sup> failed to detect an association between autophagy and protection conferred by RIPC in patients undergoing CABG surgery. Analysis of autophagy proteins in left ventricular biopsies taken before initiation of CPB and at early reperfusion showed no consistent changes in key autophagy proteins either with I/R or between the placebo and RIPC cohorts, despite evidence of RIPC-induced protection manifest as a reduction in serum cardiac isoform of troponin I (cTnI). In the Jahania study, each patient's paired results were reported as a ratio from pre-CPB to post-CPB. The Gedik study reported the mean baseline (before cross-clamp) compared to the mean value at 10-minute reperfusion and may have missed individual pre-post changes. While the majority of observations to date suggest that cardiac autophagy is an active and adaptive response in humans, additional studies are needed to confirm these findings and determine whether enhancement of adaptive autophagy will open the door to new cardioprotective strategies.

## Pharmacological Methods of Inducing Protection

A number of pharmacological agents are known to limit I/R injury in animal models. Clinical trials involving many of these agents, however, have yielded mixed or negative results. 191 The failure to translate promising preclinical interventions and agents into effective clinical therapies prompted the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute to convene a panel of experts in 2011 to discuss the reasons for failure and to develop a series of recommendations designed to move the field of myocardial protection forward. 192 The working group concluded that future preclinical cardioprotection studies should concentrate on relevant animal models that reflect human comorbid conditions such as atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes, and advanced age. The panel also suggested that cardioprotective candidates for future clinical development should have demonstrated efficacy in multiple independent preclinical studies involving rodent and large-animal models. Early-stage clinical trials to evaluate safety of the most promising candidates should also show efficacy based on surrogate markers. In addition to cardiac enzymes, advances in MRI make it possible to assess infarct size,193 ischemic and pharmacologic preconditioning, postconditioning, remote postconditioning, sodiumhydrogen exchange inhibitors, adenosine analogs, and cyclosporine A have shown promise in studies using healthy young animals but have not been adequately evaluated in animal models with comorbidities such as obesity or age. The purpose of this section is to review the status of several of these treatments that have been studied clinically.

#### **ADENOSINE**

There is considerable preclinical evidence that activation of various adenosine receptor subtypes results in cardioprotection similar to that induced by IPC. Preischemic administration of the nucleoside adenosine retards the rate of ischemia-induced ATP depletion, prolongs the time to onset of ischemic contracture, attenuates myocardial stunning, enhances postischemic myocardial energetics and reduces infarct size. 194,195 There are four distinct adenosine receptor sub-types: A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2a</sub>, A<sub>2b</sub>, and A<sub>3</sub>. While all of the receptors reportedly have cardioprotective properties, agonists of  $A_1$ , and  $A_2$  receptors have been the most widely investigated. The A<sub>26</sub> receptor has also been shown to protect against I/R injury. These receptors are coupled to heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding (G) proteins in which the subtype (G,  $G_{i\alpha 2}$ ,  $G_{i\alpha 3}$ ,  $G_{q}$ , and  $G_{s}$ ) varies according to the receptor and tissue. There is evidence that two and possibly three of the adenosine receptor subtypes are expressed in the adult human heart. Activation of the adenosine A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> receptors confers protection in animal studies when administered prior to the onset of ischemia (preconditioning); the A<sub>2h</sub> receptor is protective when activated at the time of reperfusion. 196-199 Administration of adenosine is complicated by the fact that it causes systemic hypotension, limiting the use of prolonged administration or higher doses. Evidence that extracellular adenosine signaling can be protective has led to a number of clinical trials in the setting of PCI for acute MI and heart surgery. With respect to the former, two particularly intriguing ones are Acute Myocardial Infarction Study of Adenosine (AMISTAD-I) and AMISTAD-II. 200-202 In AMISTAD-I, 236 patients undergoing thrombolytic therapy for acute MI were randomized to receive adenosine or placebo within 6 hours of the onset of infarction. The primary endpoint was infarct size by technetium-99m sestamibi (single-photon emission computed tomography, SPECT); secondary endpoints included myocardial salvage index and a composite endpoint comprising death, reinfarction, shock, congestive heart failure (CHF), and stroke. In this study, there was a 67% relative reduction in infarct size in patients with anterior infarction; however, there was no reduction in patients with infarcts located elsewhere. It may be easier to detect an effect on infarct size if the area at risk is larger, which is often the case when the LAD coronary artery is involved. Although there was a trend toward achieving the composite secondary endpoint, there were no significant differences in clinical outcome between the two groups. This led to the AMISTAD-II trial. In this study, 2118 patients with evolving anterior infarcts and receiving thrombolysis or primary angioplasty were randomized to receive placebo or a low or high dose of adenosine. The primary composite endpoint consisted of new CHF, first rehospitalization for CHF, or death at 6 months. In a subset of patients (n = 243), infarct size was measured by SPECT. In this study, adenosine therapy had no effect on clinical outcomes; it did demonstrate however that, as in AMISTAD-I, adenosine treatment resulted in a dose-related reduction in infarct size. At the higher dose, a 57% relative reduction in infarct size was observed. A likely explanation for the divergence between reduced infarct size and yet no effect on outcomes is that the study was underpowered to show clinical improvement. The significance of these two studies however

is that for the first time there was evidence that a pharmacologic agent—specifically adenosine—could reduce infarct size when administered at reperfusion.

Other adenosine studies, however, failed to show efficacy. Desmet et al reported the effects of a high-dose intracoronary bolus of adenosine administered just prior to PCI. Patients were randomized to receive adenosine (4 mg) or placebo; infarct size was assessed using MRI. Four months later there was no evidence of infarct scar reduction or a decrease in microvascular obstruction by MRI.<sup>203</sup> Fokkema et al also evaluated the effect of high-dose adenosine given as intracoronary boluses on infarct size in patients with acute STEMI. Patients (n = 448) were randomized to receive placebo (n = 222) or two bolus injections of intracoronary adenosine  $(2 \times 120 \mu g \text{ in } 20 \text{ mL saline})$  (n = 226). The first bolus was administered after thrombus aspiration, and the second was given after stenting the infarct-related artery. In this study, adenosine treatment had no effect on infarct size as determined by CK and CK-MB or Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow.<sup>204</sup> A major limitation of both studies was the mode of administration. The half-life of adenosine in blood is measured in seconds; the retrospective inference is that a single or double bolus injection of adenosine is too short-lived to confer protection. 191

With respect to adenosine and cardiac surgery, most of the studies have been relatively small as well. Fremes and colleagues reported the results of an open-label, nonrandomized CABG surgery study in which adenosine administration was combined with antegrade warm blood cardioplegia. The adenosine concentrations studied were 15, 20, and 25 µm. These investigators reported that adenosine could be added safely as a supplement to cardioplegic solutions, but it had no effect on myocardial function at the doses studied.<sup>205</sup> Cohen and colleagues observed a similar lack of efficacy in a phase II double-blind, placebo-controlled trial performed in patients undergoing CABG surgery. Patients were treated with placebo (saline) or warm blood cardioplegia supplemented with 15, 50, or 100 µm adenosine. These investigators found that adenosine did not alter survival, the incidence of MI or the incidence of low cardiac output syndrome. A limitation of this study was the use of low concentrations of adenosine in the setting of warm blood cardioplegia. In blood, the nucleoside is metabolized rapidly to inosine and hypoxanthine; its half-life is measured in seconds, thus limiting its potential effect.<sup>206</sup>

A beneficial effect was observed by Mentzer and colleagues, however, in an open-label, single-center study in which the safety, tolerance, and efficacy of high doses of adenosine were studied when added to cold blood cardioplegia in CABG surgery patients.  $^{207}$  Sixty-one patients were randomized to receive standard cold blood cardioplegia or cold blood cardioplegia containing one of five adenosine doses ranging between 100  $\mu m$  and 2 mm. Invasive and noninvasive studies of myocardial function were obtained sequentially after bypass. Parameters included the recording of inotropic utilization rates for the postoperative treatment of low cardiac output. Blood samples were collected for the

measurement of nucleoside levels. High-dose adenosine treatment achieved a 249-fold increase in the plasma adenosine concentration and was associated with a reduction in postbypass inotropic drug utilization, improved regional wall motion and global function measured by transthoracic echocardiography.

Subsequently, Mentzer and colleagues examined the effects of high-dose adenosine treatment in 253 CABG surgery patients randomized to one of three treatment arms. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial using cold blood cardioplegia. Adenosine was administered in three different doses and rates. Invasive and noninvasive measurements of ventricular performance were obtained before, during and after surgery. The study revealed a trend toward the decreased need for high-dose inotropic support and fewer perioperative MIs in the high-dose adenosine group, but it was underpowered to show an effect on any single endpoint. A post hoc composite outcome analysis revealed that patients who received high-dose adenosine were less likely to experience the composite endpoint of high-dose dopamine and epinephrine use, insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump, MI, or death.208

In 2001, Wei et al<sup>208a</sup> initiated a prospective randomized, controlled study in 30 patients undergoing elective CABG surgery and CPB to investigate the effect of adenosine pretreatment on myocardial recovery and inflammatory response. Patients received a 7-minute infusion of adenosine prior to the initiation of CPB (n = 15); outcomes were compared to a second group of patients (n = 15) who did not receive the infusion. CPB was initiated 3 minutes after cessation of the adenosine infusion. Cold blood cardioplegic solution was infused antegrade retrograde during the period of aortic cross-clamping, and warm blood retrograde cardioplegia was administered at the end of cross-clamping. Postoperative CK-MB, perioperative leukocyte counts and various cytokines were measured. CK-MB levels were lower and the cardiac index was better in the adenosine-treated cohort. Leukocyte counts and cytokine levels were unaffected. The authors concluded that adenosine treatment was protective, but its mechanism of action was independent of effects on inflammation.

In contrast, Ahlsson et al did not detect a beneficial effect with adenosine added to cold blood cardioplegia administered continuously in patients undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement. 209 In this study, 80 patients were randomized into four groups: Group I-antegrade cardioplegia with adenosine (n = 19); Group II—antegrade cardioplegia with placebo (n = 21); Group III—retrograde cardioplegia with adenosine (n = 21); and Group IV—retrograde cardioplegia with placebo (n = 19). Adenine nucleotide content and lactate were determined from left ventricular biopsies obtained before aortic occlusion, after bolus cardioplegia, at 60 minutes of aortic occlusion and at 20 minutes after release of the aortic occlusion. CK-MB and troponin-T were measured at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 hours after aortic occlusion. Hemodynamic profiles were obtained before surgery and 1, 8, and 24 hours after CPB. In this study, investigators observed that retrograde blood cardioplegia was associated with a higher myocardial oxygen uptake and lactate accumulation than antegrade, but the addition of adenosine to cardioplegia showed no benefit.

In summary, it is still not clear whether adenosine is beneficial in the setting of heart surgery. It is possible that this conundrum will be solved with the development of receptor-selective adenosine analogs that confer protection without causing systemic hypotension.

#### SODIUM-HYDROGEN EXCHANGER INHIBITORS

The sodium-hydrogen exchangers (NHEs) are a family of membrane proteins with nine isoforms that are involved in the transport of hydrogen ions in exchange for sodium ions. NHE-1 is the isoform that is expressed in the heart and most likely plays a minor role in the normal excitation-contraction coupling process. As discussed in the section, Intracellular Mechanisms of Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury, NHE-1 contributes to calcium overload and cell death. In the setting of I/R injury, NHE-1 contributes to arrhythmias, stunning, apoptosis, necrosis, postinfarction ventricular remodeling and heart failure. 210,211 In the context of heart surgery, there have been a number of small clinical trials to test whether inhibition of NHE-1 can prevent I/R injury. EXPEDITION was a phase III trial to address the safety and efficacy of NHE-1 inhibition by cariporide in the prevention of death or MI in patients undergoing CABG surgery. High-risk CABG patients (n = 5770) were randomized to receive either intravenous cariporide or placebo. The composite endpoint was assessed at 5 days, and patients were followed for up to 6 months. The incidence of postoperative MI (which had very specific criteria involving EKG changes, CK-MB elevation, with or without chest pain) in this series of patients was 18%, much higher than previously thought. The results revealed an 18.3% relative risk reduction in the incidence of death or MI at 5 days (p = .0002). The relative risk reduction for death or MI at day 30 and month 6 was 16.1% (p = .0009) and 15.7% (p = .0006), respectively. When MI risk was analyzed separately, the relative risk reduction was 23.8% at 5 days (p = .000005) and 25.6% at month 6 (p = .000001). This cardioprotective effect was extremely robust; however, the overall mortality rate increased at 5 days from 1.5% in the placebo group to 2.2% in the group with cariporide, which was attributed to an increase in the incidence of cerebrovascular events. Thus, while cariporide was effective in reducing the incidence of nonfatal MI, it increased the risk of death from cerebrovascular events resulting in an unacceptable safety profile. In this study the drug was administered continuously for 49 hours beginning preoperatively, although no preclinical studies had examined the necessity or possible adverse effects of prolonged administration; the preclinical studies utilized a single bolus. Nevertheless this study was significant because it was the first Phase III study in heart surgery patients to clearly demonstrate that it is possible to pharmacologically protect the heart and reduce the incidence of perioperative MI. The findings also suggest that NHE-1 inhibitors represent a new

class of drugs that hold promise for reduction of MI associated with I/R injury, provided it is possible to eliminate the risk of cerebrovascular events. <sup>1,212</sup> It is possible that some of the newer drugs in this class may be safer.

#### **ACADESINE**

Acadesine (also known as 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranoside, AICA riboside) is a purine nucleoside analog which was thought to elevate tissue levels of adenosine selectively during ischemic conditions. Numerous preclinical studies demonstrated its cardioprotective efficacy, although it is not clear whether the protective effect is due to its effects on intracellular ATP synthesis, extracellular adenosine concentrations or its ability to activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and thereby stimulate glucose uptake and autophagy.<sup>213,214</sup> Early preclinical studies indicated acadesine treatment improved left ventricular wall motion after intermittent ischemia, diminished the frequency of ventricular arrhythmias during reperfusion, attenuated myocardial stunning, and preserved myocardial function after cardiac arrest and cold cardioplegia. These observations led to several clinical trials in CABG surgery patients in the 1990s. The findings however were inconclusive due in part to the fact that they were underpowered. In 2006, Mangano performed a meta-analysis on the combined data from five trials comprising more than 4000 CABG patients to determine the effects of i.v. acadesine on the prespecified perioperative outcomes of MI, stroke, and cardiac death. In these five studies, acadesine was given intravenously prior to and during surgery along with a fixed concentration included in the cardioplegia solution. The meta-analysis concluded that acadesine was effective in reducing perioperative MI, cardiac death, and combined adverse cardiovascular outcomes.<sup>215</sup>

Mangano et al then examined the 2-year, all-cause mortality after perioperative MI in a follow-up of the Acadesine 1024 Trial. In this analysis, patients who received acadesine and had a postreperfusion MI had a significant fourfold reduction in mortality compared to the patients who had an MI but did not receive the drug (3/46 patients vs 15/54 patients, respectively).<sup>216</sup> This led to a large prospective randomized trial, Reduction in Cardiovascular Events by Acadesine in Patients Undergoing CABG (RED-CABG). High-risk CABG patients were randomized to receive either acadesine or placebo prior to the induction of anesthesia. The target enrolment was 7500 patients, and the primary composite endpoint was all-cause mortality, stroke and need for mechanical support for left ventricular failure. Midway into the study, a futility analysis indicated a low probability of detecting a statistically significant difference between treatment and placebo groups; the trial was terminated after 3080 patients had been enrolled.217 In reviewing the outcome of RED-CABG the investigators acknowledged that planning a clinical trial based on a meta-analysis carries inherent risk. While the study was intended to enroll high-risk patients (a higher event rate would make it easier to discern a beneficial effect), it turned out that many of the patients were not high risk resulting in a lower than expected event rate (the composite endpoint). Because MI was an exploratory outcome rather than a primary endpoint, enzyme levels were determined only during the first 24 hours. Despite these caveats however, the investigators concluded that acadesine treatment had no effect of all-cause mortality, nonfatal stroke or need for mechanical circulatory support. This disappointing outcome makes it unlikely that acadesine will be the subject of further clinical investigation.

#### GLUCOSE-INSULIN-POTASSIUM

Numerous studies have shown that glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) infusions are effective in reducing perioperative MIs, postischemic myocardial dysfunction and atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing heart surgery. Increased glycolytic flux driven by glucose and insulin supplementation increases pyruvate generation and maintains the GSH/GSSG balance. Additionally glycolytic ATP protects membranes through stimulation of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and supports uptake of Ca<sup>2+</sup> by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Provision of K<sup>+</sup> improves sodium homeostasis of ischemic myocardium.

Despite a strong rationale for its application, the efficacy of GIK in the setting of heart surgery remains controversial. The use of GIK to treat patients with acute MI yielded mixed results in the 1990s. Fath-Ordoubadi and Beatt performed a meta-analysis on 1932 patients in nine small trials of GIK for acute MI and found it was beneficial. It should be noted that none of the patients underwent reperfusion therapy (thrombolysis or primary PCIs).219 In 2003, van der Horst reported the results of a randomized open label study in which 940 patients with acute MI and eligible for angioplasty received either continuous infusion of GIK or no infusion.<sup>220</sup> GIK infusion had no effect on overall patient mortality, but a significant reduction in mortality was observed in the subgroup of patients without evidence of heart failure (1.2% vs 4.2%). The investigators concluded that the effect of GIK infusion in patients with heart failure was uncertain. To confirm these findings, a folstudy, GIPS-II, was initiated in 2003. The purpose was to confirm clinical benefit of GIK in STEMI patients without signs of heart failure. Patients were randomized to traditional care or additional GIK infusion. The study, however, was terminated early due to lack of efficacy. It was concluded that GIK in adjunct to reperfusion therapy in STEMI patients does not lower mortality.<sup>221</sup>

In follow up to the Fath-Ordoubadi and Beatt meta-analysis in 1997,<sup>219</sup> Mamas et al reported the results of a meta-analysis of GIK therapy for the treatment of acute MI in 2010.<sup>222</sup> Unlike the previous meta-analysis, this study included patients who underwent reperfusion therapy. A total of 16 randomized trials accounting for 28,373 patients were identified between 1966 and 2008. These investigators failed to find any life benefit for GIK therapy in STEMI patients. The findings were consistent with the combined subgroup analysis of GIK therapy for acute MI in the OASIS-6 and CREATE-ECLA trials which also showed that GIK infusion had no effect on key clinical endpoints.<sup>223</sup>

It was hypothesized that the efficacy of GIK infusions depends upon how soon it is administered after the onset of ischemia. Selker and colleagues tested this hypothesis in the IMMEDIATE Trial in 2012.<sup>224</sup> GIK was administered to presumed MI patients prior to hospitalization with the expectation that it would slow the progression of MI or STEMI. Secondary endpoints included the incidence of cardiac arrest, mortality and heart failure. A total of 911 patients were randomized; 59 were not enrolled because they did not give written consent on arrival at the hospital. The investigators found that MI progression did not differ between the GIK and the placebo groups, and GIK administration had no effect on 30-day survival; however, GIK was associated with a lower rate of the composite endpoint of cardiac arrest and in-hospital mortality. Moreover, infarct size was smaller in the subgroup of GIK-treated patients who underwent cardiac imaging at 30 days. The investigators concluded that early GIK therapy did not alter MI progression but had a beneficial effect on the secondary composite endpoint and called for additional studies. One-year follow-up revealed no significant differences in outcome with the exception of patients with STEMI in which the composites of cardiac arrest or 1-year mortality, and of cardiac arrest, death or rehospitalization for heart failure were significantly reduced. 225 These findings have fueled discussions over the timing of administration, target populations and overall efficacy of GIK as a cardioprotective intervention for patients with acute MI.

Bruemmer-Smith et al reported that GIK infusion during surgery had no effect on myocardial cellular damage as measured by cTnI levels 6 hours after CPB and was associated with increased hyperglycemia. Although this was a randomized, prospective, double-blind study in CABG surgery patients and the two groups were well matched for age and number of bypassed vessels, the study was most likely underpowered, given that only 42 patients were enrolled.<sup>226</sup> In another study, Lell et al reported on 46 patients undergoing elective off-pump CABG surgery; the patients received either normal saline or a GIK infusion for 12 hours. These investigators were also unable to demonstrate a beneficial effect on cardiac performance using the clinical measurements of cardiac index and inotropic requirements. They noted persistent hyperglycemia—a known risk factor for postoperative complications—despite the use of supplemental insulin.<sup>227</sup> Lazar et al<sup>228</sup> conducted a study in diabetic CABG patients to determine whether GIK solution with tight perioperative glycemic control was more effective than standard glycemic control and no GIK. The rationale was that GIK with tight glycemic control would optimize myocardial metabolism and improve perioperative outcomes. The preoperative patient profiles of the 141 randomized patients were similar with respect to age, sex, ejection fraction, urgency of surgery and the type of diabetes. Although the 30-day survival was comparable in both groups, the patients receiving GIK plus tight control had significantly higher cardiac indices and less need for inotropic support. There was also a lower incidence of atrial fibrillation. Follow-up data 5 years later were available in 60 of 70 GIK patients (83.3%) and in 60 of 69 placebo

patients (86.9%). Survival was significantly better in the patients who received GIK; the investigators attributed these long-lasting benefits to the perioperative GIK treatment, but it might also have been due to the careful glycemic control. In another study of patients with type-2 diabetes, Barcellos et al reported their findings in 24 patients who underwent CABG surgery. Patients were administered GIK or subcutaneous insulin from the onset of anesthesia until 12 hours postoperatively. The use of GIK neither improved the cardiac index nor reduced the use of inotropic agents.<sup>229</sup>

In another single-center study, Quinn et al conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 280 nondiabetic CABG surgery patients. 90 They found that GIK treatment was associated with fewer episodes of low cardiac output, less inotropic support postoperatively and a reduction in serum cardiac troponin I levels. The authors concluded that GIK is an effective, inexpensive and safe cardioprotective adjunct.90 Rabi et al conducted a metaanalysis of 20 clinical trials to determine the effect of GIK or glucose-insulin (GI) on in-hospital mortality and atrial fibrillation (AF).<sup>230</sup> They found that GIK/GI failed to significantly reduce mortality or AF in patients undergoing CABG surgery. The authors discouraged the routine use of GIK/GI in patients undergoing CABG surgery until future clinical trials provided sufficient evidence to warrant the practice. Fan et al, however, came to a different conclusion in their meta-analysis of 33 randomized clinical trials.<sup>231</sup> This analysis involved 2113 patients: 1150 were randomized to GIK and 963 served as a control group. Most of the studies were performed in CABG patients; six trials were based on valve or combined valve/ CABG operations. Twenty studies used a placebo for control and 13 used standard of care as the control. Some studies included diabetic patients; glycemic control was used in 13 trials. The insulin dose and timing of infusions varied across studies. This meta-analysis showed that GIK therapy was associated with a significant reduction in perioperative MI and inotropic support, but had no effect on all-cause mortality, postoperative atrial fibrillation or length of hospital stay.

While most studies had focused on CABG patients, Howell et al sought to evaluate the effects of GIK in patients undergoing surgery for aortic stenosis. 232 Patients with critical aortic stenosis often have left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), which is thought to compromise myocardial protection and put them at greater risk of a poor outcome. To test the benefits of GIK in this setting, the investigators initiated a single-center, double-blind placebo-controlled study with the primary endpoint a reduction in low cardiac output syndrome. Intermittent antegrade cardioplegia using St. Thomas solution buffered in cold blood was used for myocardial protection. Left ventricular biopsies were obtained to measure posttranslational modifications of specific proteins as an indication of GIK's effect on cardioprotective signaling. Over 4 years, 217 patients were randomized to GIK (n = 110) or placebo (n = 107). The investigators found that GIK treatment was associated with higher cardiac index from the beginning of treatment until 12 hours after the removal of the cross-clamp, a significant reduction in the incidence of low cardiac output

and frequency of inotrope use 6 to 12 hours postoperatively. This was accompanied by biochemical markers consistent with cardioprotective signaling. Although the investigators had expected that hypertrophic hearts would be at greater risk for myocardial necrosis and that GIK would therapy would be associated with lower troponin levels, they found that GIK had no effect on troponin levels. This was similar to the earlier study by Quinn et al from the same institution studying CABG patients. 90 The findings suggest that GIK ameliorates myocardial stunning but not necrosis.

GIK therapy has also been examined in the setting of patients undergoing urgent off-pump CABG surgery (OPCAB) for acute MI. Shim et al (2012) reported the results of a study in which 66 patients were randomized to receive GIK infusion or placebo.<sup>233</sup> The primary endpoints were the highest concentrations of CK-MB and troponin-T after reperfusion and the area under the curve (AUC) of serial troponin-T measurements obtained before the operation and at 12, 24, and 48 hours after reperfusion. The secondary endpoints were troponin-T levels greater than 0.8 ng/mL, MI defined by specific criteria and composite morbidity. The investigators found that GIK therapy was associated with a significant reduction in peak concentraions of CK-MB and troponin-T and the AUC of troponin-T. However, the incidence of postoperative MI was similar for both groups as were the other secondary clincial endpoints. In contrast to the Howell study, this clinical trial of urgent OPCAB for acute coronary syndrome found GIK attenuated myocardial necrosis (troponin-T and CK-MB) but did not alter incidence of MI or composite morbidity.

Taken altogether the evidence supporting the efficacy of GIK in the setting of heart surgery is still mixed. Meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials and numerous small studies indicate it may or may not be effective in preventing postischemic ventricular dysfunction, myocardial necrosis and atrial arrhythmias. This is due in part to the many small studies that are insufficiently powered to definitively conclude that GIK is ineffective; they can only conclude that they failed to see a benefit. Additional limitations include the heavy reliance on surrogate markers of injury, inherent limitations associated with meta-analyses, variability in managing hyperglycemia, variations in the specific composition and mode of administration of GIK and inclusion of low-risk patients (which lowers the event rate and limits the chance to detect a benefit). A large randomized, multi-center clinical trial specifically designed to address these issues will be required to resolve the controversies around the use of GIK for myocardial protection during heart surgery.

#### **CYCLOSPORINE**

A major feature of reperfusion injury is the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) which leads to necrotic cell death. For this reason preventing mPTP opening is considered a therapeutic target for I/R protection. <sup>234-237</sup> Cyclosporin A (CsA), Sanglifehrin A

and NIM 811 act directly on cyclophilin D, a key regulator of pore opening. As Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ROS trigger pore opening, other preclinical interventions have targeted those upstream modulators. mPTP opening is also suppressed at acidic intracellular pH, which has been targeted by inhibiting NHE-1 to prevent proton extrusion.<sup>236,238</sup> CsA has been used extensively as an immunosuppressive agent in the management of transplant patients but is also a potent inhibitor of mPTP; its efficacy has been explored in small clinical trials involving patients undergoing heart surgery or PCI for acute MI.

In 2008, Ovize's group randomized 58 patients to receive CsA (n = 30) or placebo (n = 28) immediately prior to undergoing PCI for acute STEMI.<sup>239</sup> The primary endpoint was myocardial necrosis measured by CK and troponin-I; for a secondary endpoint in a subgroup of 27 patients, MRI was used to assess infarct size at 5 days as determined by the area of delayed hyper-enhancement. There were no differences between groups with respect to baseline characteristics, duration of ischemia, area at risk and ejection fraction. All patients underwent stenting of the culprit lesion. The CsA group demonstrated a 40% reduction in myocardial necrosis as assessed by serial CK, although, curiously there was no difference in troponin I release. They also compared CK levels to the area at risk estimated by circumferential extent of abnormally contracting segments and found that for any given size of the area at risk, smaller infarcts were observed in the CsA-treated patients. In the subgroup of patients who were studied by MRI, hyperenhancement was significantly reduced. Ejection fraction measured by echocardiography at 3 months did not differ between the two groups. While offering promise as a novel therapeutic approach, the strength of the study's conclusions are compromised by limitations subsequently pointed out in letters to the editor of the New England Journal of Medicine where the study had been published. There were outliers in the control group with respect to CK, TnI and infarct size assessed by MRI; it was suggested that these outliers skewed the control group mean and that eliminating them would remove the significant difference between the two groups. It was also noted that in the control group 13 patients had failed thrombolytic therapy before PCI versus only five in the CsA group, which might have biased outcome.

A similar small study was performed in 78 CABG surgery patients randomized to receive an intravenous bolus of CsA (2.5 mg/kg) (n = 40) or placebo (n = 38).<sup>240</sup> The drug was administered after induction of anesthesia and prior to sternotomy. Perioperative infarction was assessed by serial troponin-T (cTnT) and CK-MB levels. Cold blood cardioplegia or cross-clamp fibrillation was used for cardioprotection in both groups. The two groups were similar in patient characteristics and intraoperative vessels. While CsA treatment had no effect on postoperative CK-MB or cTnT levels, the investigators found in *post hoc* analysis that in patients with longer CPB times (120 vs 70 minutes), CsA treatment was associated with reduced cTnT release. They concluded that administration of

CsA prior to CABG surgery can reduce the incidence of perioperative myocardial injury in patients with longer CBP times, and the effect may be mediated by prevention mPTP opening. Concerns with this study however include the small sample size and the absence of any clinically relevant endpoints.

Subsequently, Ovize's group conducted a prospective, randomized, single-blinded, controlled study in which 61 valve surgery patients were assigned to receive an intravenous bolus of CsA (n = 30) or saline (n = 31) less than 10 minutes before aortic unclamping. The primary endpoint was the 72-hour area under the curve for cTnI release; secondary outcomes included extubation time and length of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital. After removal of the aortic crossclamp, the need for defibrillation was the same; weaning from CPB was without incident for both groups. The CsA-treated group showed lower cTnI release (72 hours AUC) even after correcting for duration of cross-clamp time (global ischemia). There was no difference in the secondary outcomes. While this study was quite small in scope, it was exciting because the drug appeared to be effective when administered prior to reperfusion. For this reason, based on the reports that cyclosporine was effective in preventing reperfusion injury in patients undergoing PCI for AMI, coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG), and heart valve operations, the Circus trial was initiated.<sup>241</sup> This was a large randomized placebo, doubleblind study involving patients with acute STEMI. Patients were randomized to receive intravenous cyclosporine (n = 396) or placebo (n = 395) prior to undergoing PCI revascularization for acute anterior S-T segment elevation myocardial infarction. The primary endpoint was a composite outcome comprised of death from any cause, worsening of heart failure during the initial hospitalization, re-hospitalization for heart failure, or adverse left ventricular remodeling at 1 year. In this study, cyclosporine had no effect on the incidence of the composite endpoint or any of the separate clinical components or other events, including recurrent infarction, unstable angina, and stroke. The findings in this multicenter trial highlight the importance of recognizing the limits of small single center myocardial protection studies, particularly those that rely on reductions of troponin levels as markers of myocardial injury as opposed to necrosis. At present the results of Circus trial call into question the clinical advantage of using mPTP inhibitors to protect the heart against I/R injury.

## MYOCARDIAL PROTECTION DURING BEATING HEART SURGERY

In an effort to minimize complications associated with cardiopulmonary bypass such as stroke and a systemic inflammatory response, a number of coronary artery bypass graft operations are performed without cardiopulmonary bypass (off-pump: OPCAB). The assumption is that avoidance of aortic crossclamping will be associated with a lower incidence of cerebrovascular complications and perioperative MI, lower rates of renal and respiratory failure, less postoperative bleeding, less pain and shorter length of hospitalization. There is a concern, however, that OPCAB may be associated with incomplete revascularization, a higher incidence of perioperative MI and a reduction in long-term graft patency. 242-244 While the relative benefits of OPCAB versus on-pump CABG surgery are still under investigation, as many as 20% of CABG patients undergo the procedure off-pump. Thus it is important to appreciate the principles and methods of myocardial protection as it relates to beating heart surgery.

The acceptance of OPCAB is due in part to the development and refinement of a myriad of surgical aids that allow for stabilization and local immobilization of the heart during grafting. Techniques include the temporary occlusion of the coronary artery or shunting of blood during sustained coronary artery occlusion. Since temporary occlusion of an already diseased artery may aggravate ongoing ischemia, pharmacologic agents and nonpharmacologic maneuvers are used to protect the heart during displacement required to access lateral and inferior wall vessels. Many of these interventions are designed to reduce myocardial oxygen demand at a time when supply is limited. Ischemia during temporary occlusion of a coronary artery during OPCAB may last from 6 to 25 minutes based on the surgeon's experience, quality and size of the vessel and adequacy of the exposure. Most patients with preexisting severe coronary heart disease have experienced self-limiting episodes of ischemia during daily life and may have acquired a certain degree of tolerance to the surgically induced ischemia. This tolerance has been documented using ECGs, transesophageal echocardiography and continuous mixed venous oxygen saturation (SVO<sub>2</sub>) monitoring. In order to better understand the differences in the ischemic stress between OPCAB and onpump CABG surgery, Chowdhury et al studied 50 patients with respect to the release pattern of various cardiac biomarkers including cardiac troponin I, heart-type fatty acid-binding protein, CK-MB, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and myoglobin.<sup>245</sup> Samples were obtained at baseline and then at hourly intervals up to 72 hours after completion of the last anastomosis in the noncardioplegic OPCAB group and after release of aortic cross-clamp in the cardioplegic group. The cardioplegic group exhibited greater release of cardiac troponin I, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and heart-type fatty acidbinding protein consistent with the fact that OPCAB surgery puts less myocardium at ischemic risk. Ventricular function as measured by transthoracic echocardiography was similar in the two groups. Schroyer et al analyzed both short-term and long-term outcomes in 2203 patients randomized to undergo either on-pump or off-pump surgery.<sup>246</sup> The primary endpoints included mortality and complications such as reoperation, need for new mechanical support, cardiac arrest, coma, stroke or renal failure before discharge or within 30 days of surgery. The long-term outcome consisted of the composite endpoint of death from any cause, repeat revascularization procedure or a nonfatal MI within 1 year. Secondary endpoints included graft patency and neurologic outcomes. While there were no differences at 30 days, they observed that OPCAB patients had a higher incidence of death from cardiac causes within 1 year, tended to have lower graft patency and had fewer arteries bypassed. The incidence of stroke or resource utilization was similar for both on-pump and off-pump procedures. While

OPCAB puts less myocardium at risk, it is clear that there is still a need for ischemic protection.

One approach to minimizing the risk of injury is to reduce myocardial oxygen demand using pharmacologic beta-blockade. Ultra-short-acting beta blockers such as esmolol and labetalol are frequently used to reduce inotropy and achieve negative chronotropy. Another approach is to optimize systemic mean blood pressures while reducing afterload. Calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem are used to lower blood pressure with less compromise of myocardial contractility than beta blockers. Patients who become hypertensive during the operation may benefit from intravenous nitrates to enhance coronary vasodilation and increase blood flow via collaterals. Gentle core cooling, by allowing the body temperature to drift from 35 to 36°C, and deepening the level of anesthesia are other concurrent measures that can be employed to minimize cardiac work and concomitant oxygen requirements. IPC, RIPC and volatile anesthetics with conditioning-like effects have been used in beating heart surgery in an effort to mitigate I/R injury; however, none of these have been shown to improve clinical outcomes.<sup>247</sup> Thus while the OPCAB approach to myocardial revascularization reduces the amount of myocardium at risk, it does not obviate the need to develop new methods to attenuate I/R injury.

# Challenges of Myocardial Protection Trials

It has been difficult to translate promising cardioprotective agents identified in animal studies to the clinic. One reason may be that preclinical studies typically involve healthy young animals of a single sex. While a particular drug may show efficacy in this model, it may fail in humans when both sexes are enrolled and when the study includes patients with advanced age. Aging in itself affects numerous biological processes invoked during I/R. Furthermore, many patients may have comorbid conditions including hypertension, dyslipidemias, obesity and diabetes which may compromise the ability to mount a cardioprotective response. In support of this, preclinical studies have confirmed that obese animals show less infarct size reduction from ischemic preconditioning compared to lean animals, and it has also been reported that hypercholesterolemia interferes with ischemic preconditioning.<sup>235</sup> When a promising agent identified in preclinical studies advances to testing in humans, trial design is challenging. As an example of the difficulties in adapting experimental protocols to the clinical setting, agents that were shown to be protective when given prior to ischemia were much less effective when given at reperfusion which, in the case of PCI for acute MI, is the only clinically feasible approach. Clinical trials that are openlabel or single-blind open the door for bias in postoperative management such as administration of inotropic support. Trials are often designed to test whether a particular agent or intervention has benefit. A far larger number of patients must be enrolled to prove the null hypothesis, that is, that the intervention has no benefit. This becomes a challenge if the endpoint, such as 30-day mortality, occurs with relatively low

frequency. Given the already low early mortality associated with current surgical approaches, the size of the trial needed to test the null hypothesis becomes daunting. The study by Lehrke et al showed a clear relationship between 48-hour postoperative cTnT levels ≥0.46 μg/L and long-term (28 months) survival; it was also associated with perioperative MI, in-hospital heart failure and 30-day mortality suggesting that these short-term endpoints may be valid surrogate markers of longterm mortality.<sup>19</sup> A more recent meta-analysis confirmed an association between postoperative troponin release and shortterm and mid-term (12-month) all-cause mortality.<sup>248</sup> Similar validation studies are needed for MRI assessment of infarct size and risk zone in order for this increasingly sophisticated imaging modality to become accepted as a reliable indicator of cardioprotection.<sup>249</sup> At present the U.S. Food and Drug Administration considers improvement in morbidity and mortality the only acceptable endpoints—rather than surrogate markers—for approval of a cardioprotective intervention. As a consequence the high cost of clinical trials has discouraged even large pharmaceutical companies from pursuing cardioprotection as a therapeutic target. In turn this has fostered the proliferation of small, single-center trials with short-term endpoints and surrogate markers that fall short of proving or disproving efficacy. Despite these considerations, cardiac surgery remains an ideal testing ground for study of cardioprotective treatments: in cardiac surgical patients it is possible to document the onset and duration of ischemia, establish the interval between onset of reperfusion and endpoint analysis and obtain MRIs before and after the ischemic stress to accurately document the volume of necrosis. This information should increase the predictive value of small clinical trials.

While considerable progress has been made in the field of myocardial protection over the past 50 years, the ideal cardioplegic solution, pharmacological intervention, technique or delivery method has yet to be determined. This is due in part to the increasing awareness of the complexity of I/R injury and the concern that surrogate markers or short-term mortality rates are only weakly predictive of durable beneficial outcomes. Myocardial stunning and necrosis remain significant challenges that impact short- and long-term outcomes; there is ongoing need to find new ways to protect the heart during cardiac surgery.
