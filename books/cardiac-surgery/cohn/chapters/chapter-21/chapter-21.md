# Myocardial Revascularization Without Cardiopulmonary Bypass

Bobby Yanagawa • Michael E. Halkos • John D. Puskas

Despite the increased prevalence of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to treat coronary disease, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) will continue to have a major role, particularly in patients with complex multivessel disease and diabetes mellitus. Currently, the majority of surgical revascularization is performed with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), with most surgeons preferring to perform distal anastomoses on an arrested heart. Advocates of this approach cite low morbidity and mortality with outcomes that have continued to improve despite a surgical patient population with increasing comorbid conditions and more advanced and severe coronary disease. 1-3 However, complications, albeit infrequent, continue to plague a small percentage of patients undergoing CABG including stroke, renal failure, and respiratory failure. These complications occur not only because of the systemic inflammatory activation that occurs with extracorporeal circulation, but also because of the manipulation of the aorta required for cannulation, CPB, and aortic clamping. The interest in off-pump techniques was largely driven by the increased awareness of the deleterious effects of CPB and aortic manipulation.

According to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database (STS ACSD), off-pump CABG (OPCAB) use peaked in 2002 (23%) followed by a decline, accounting for approximately 17% of CABG cases in 2012.4 For most surgeons, the lack of compelling evidence in large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) supporting OPCAB over conventional on-pump coronary artery bypass (ONCAB) and suggestions of more frequent incomplete revascularization have been impediments to implementing this strategy in routine practice. 1-3,5,6 Nonetheless RCTs have almost uniformly demonstrated reduced transfusion requirements, lower postoperative serum myocardial enzyme levels, and shorter length of stay. Moreover, there are many retrospective trials showing a survival benefit as well as reduced morbidity with OPCAB. Retrospective database studies have much larger sample size and include mixed-risk patients. However, inherent selection bias may limit the interpretation of these results, despite advanced statistical methodology. For individual surgeons to

consider implementing an off-pump approach, the following must be demonstrated: (1) equivalent short- and long-term patency rates; (2) complete revascularization; (3) reduced morbidity and even reduced mortality, especially in high-risk patients; and (4) cost efficiency both in the operating room and during the entire hospitalization. For certain high-risk subgroups, it would appear intuitive that avoiding the systemic effects of CPB as well as aortic manipulation would reduce the incidence of specific complications such as stroke and renal failure.

An off-pump approach is more technically challenging, with new risks not familiar to on-pump surgery. Therefore, OPCAB should be considered an advanced technique, not to be performed by all surgeons but by a select few who have trained with experts in OPCAB and who themselves perform large numbers of OPCAB procedures. Finally, there is greater appreciation that OPCAB should be performed in revascularization centers of excellence, incorporated into a comprehensive approach to revascularization, which includes minimally invasive CABG, hybrid, and total arterial revascularization.

#### PREOPERATIVE CONSIDERATIONS

# Surgeon Experience

The adoption of OPCAB into clinical practice requires a commitment to learning a unique skill set. This is best achieved by focused training with an established OPCAB surgeon and routine adoption of OPCAB techniques such that the surgeon can employ this approach in patients likely to derive the most benefit. OPCAB surgery poses unique challenges to a surgeon who is accustomed to operating in a motionless and bloodless field. Furthermore, OPCAB requires an adept first and second assistant to provide exposure on a beating heart as well as excellent anesthesia management to maintain hemodynamics and alert the surgical team of potential hemodynamic problems. Thus, the commitment to OPCAB is usually tied to a belief that the technical challenges

inherent in the procedure are worth overcoming so that the patient may benefit from the avoidance of CPB. Although the benefit may be small in low-risk patients, it is becoming apparent that certain high-risk subgroups may benefit from minimizing aortic manipulation as well as avoiding the systemic effects of CPB.

The inexperienced OPCAB surgeon embarking on the learning curve is best advised to choose his or her initial patients carefully and pay close attention to coronary anatomy and confounding patient variables. The surgeon must come to the operating room with an operative plan that is flexible enough to change as operative findings such as hemodynamic fluctuations, ischemia, or arrythmias. Early in a surgeon's experience, it is probably prudent to exclude patients with difficult lateral wall targets, especially multiple lateral wall targets, severe left ventricular dysfunction, left main disease, or other complex cases (Table 21-1). Ideal early candidates for OPCAB include those undergoing elective primary coronary revascularization with good target anatomy, preserved ventricular function, and one to three grafts with easily accessible or no lateral wall targets. As experience is gained in OPCAB, this technique can be safely and effectively applied to the vast majority of patients requiring coronary artery bypass surgery. Just as important, however, is the experience to know when it is better to use CPB in patients in whom an off-pump approach will be exceedingly difficult, impractical, or poorly tolerated.

#### **Patient Variables**

The preoperative evaluation of patients for OPCAB demands careful planning and consideration for certain risk factors. We routinely perform screening carotid duplex ultrasonography on all patients over the age of 65, smokers, those with a carotid bruit, history of transient ischemic attack or stroke, left main coronary disease, peripheral vascular disease, or history of prior carotid intervention. The remainder of the preoperative evaluation is similar to ONCAB. In patients with a

murmur, dyspnea, a history of aortic or mitral regurgitation (MR), or ventricular dysfunction on cardiac catheterization, preoperative echocardiography is warranted. It is important to be aware of right ventricular dysfunction, valvular regurgitation, or pulmonary hypertension as positioning during OPCAB can result in dramatic changes in these parameters. Overall, the clinical condition of the patient, the urgency of the operation, and ventricular function need to be carefully assessed to determine whether an off-pump approach will be tolerated. Patients with left ventricular dysfunction from a recent infarct pose a more difficult challenge than those with chronic ventricular dysfunction, with the former being much more sensitive to cardiac manipulation and displacement and more likely to develop intraoperative arrhythmias.

#### **Anesthesia**

As in other cardiac operations, all patients require invasive monitoring with a pulmonary artery catheter, arterial line, Foley catheter, and central venous line. We use transesophageal echocardiography liberally to provide valuable information about valvular regurgitation, regional myocardial function, and pulmonary hypertension. In our experience, a well-experienced anesthesia team is essential to maintaining stable hemodynamics and ensuring a smooth and uneventful operation. Unlike ONCAB, which requires active coordination among surgeon, anesthesiologist, and perfusionist, the anesthesiologist and surgeon must work especially closely to maintain hemodynamic stability during OPCAB. Subtle changes in hemodynamic status, gradual elevation in pulmonary artery pressures, frequent boluses, or increased requirement of inotropes and vasopressors to maintain hemodynamic stability, and rhythm changes can herald cardiovascular collapse. Such an event can reliably be avoided if these changes are verbalized and discussed between anesthesiologist and surgeon preemptively. When manipulating the heart, it is important for the surgeon to communicate these abrupt maneuvers to the anesthesia team so that appropriate action can be taken and inappropriate reactions (bolusing vasopressors) avoided. Changes in table position (Trendelenburg) can provide dramatic volume changes that affect cardiac output and blood pressure. Autotransfusion of intravascular volume from the lower extremities by Trendelenburg positioning should be the first maneuver to maintain hemodynamic stability. We prefer to avoid giving massive volumes of intravenous fluids, which requires later postoperative diuresis. Instead, aggressive use of Trendelenburg positioning and judicious use of alpha-adrenergic agents provides stable hemodynamics during distal anastamoses. This includes patients with pulmonary hypertension, mild or moderate ischemic MR, or left ventricular dysfunction in which cardiac manipulation and displacement as well as regional myocardial ischemia may be poorly tolerated without inotropic support. If preload conditions have been optimized, then vasopressor agents such as norepinephrine or Neo-Synephrine may be used to assist with maintaining adequate blood pressure during distal anastomoses. In our experience, effective communication with a well-experienced

anesthesiologist is of paramount importance to ensure an uneventful off-pump operation.

Maintaining normothermia is critically important and requires more effort during OPCAB procedures, because the luxury of the CPB circuit for rewarming does not exist. This usually can be accomplished by infusing intravenous fluids through warmers, warming inhalational anesthetic agents, maintaining warm room temperatures before and during the procedure, and using convective forced-air warming systems (Bair Hugger; Arizant Healthcare, Eden Prairie, MN).

Anticoagulation regimens vary according to surgeon preference. For surgeons in their early experience, a full "pump" dose of heparin is reasonable in the event that conversion to CPB becomes necessary. Some surgeons continue to implement a full dose with 400 IU/kg to maintain an activated clotting time (ACT) of greater than 400 seconds; others use a half dose or 180 IU/kg, whereas others start with 10,000 IU and administer additional doses (3000 IU every half-hour) or a heparin infusion of 100 IU/min to maintain an ACT of 300 to 400 seconds. Reversal of anticoagulation with varying doses of protamine is usually administered to facilitate hemostasis.

#### **SURGICAL TECHNIQUE**

## **Preparation**

After the induction of anesthesia, patients are positioned, prepped, and draped in a standard fashion. At our institution, patients receive an aspirin rectal suppository (1000 mg) after induction. Aspirin 81 mg and clopidogrel (150 mg postoperatively, then 75 mg/day) are routinely administered early in the postoperative period after mediastinal drainage decreases well below 100 cc/h for 4 hours. This has not been associated with an increased risk of mediastinal reexploration. Because of the absence of CPB—related coagulopathy, patients may have a relative hypercoagulable perioperative state, which theoretically may jeopardize early graft patency. For this reason, we administer aspirin preoperatively, aspirin and clopidogrel early postoperatively, and then continue dual antiplatelet therapy in the postoperative period.

Endoscopic radial artery and saphenous vein conduits are harvested simultaneously during internal mammary artery (IMA) harvest. It is our practice to administer 5000 IU of heparin before endoscopic vein harvest to minimize thrombus formation within the conduit. Concern over graft quality with endoscopic vein harvest has prompted increased vigilance in atraumatic harvest technique to ensure adequate conduits for bypass.8 We routinely harvest skeletonized IMAs using a harmonic scalpel (Harmonic Synergy, Ethicon, Somerville, NJ). Skeletonized harvest of IMA grafts preserves sternal blood flow, leads to less postoperative dysesthesia, and may reduce sternal wound infection in higher risk patients such as those with diabetes mellitus. The Harmonic scalpel uses high-frequency mechanical vibration to cut and coagulate tissues and compared with electrocautery, minimizes surgical trauma to the sternum and reduces the risk of injury to the adjacent IMA.

After single or bilateral IMA harvest, the heparin dose is administered and the arterial conduits divided distally. The pericardium is incised in an inverted T-configuration, and then extended laterally along the diaphragm to facilitate cardiac displacement while avoiding injury to phrenic nerves. It is essential to free the left lateral pericardium from the diaphragm to allow the pericardium to be retracted to displace the heart, exposing the lateral wall of the left ventricle. We routinely dissect the left IMA distally to the bifurcation as the extra length is often necessary to avoid tension on the anastomosis during rightward displacement for lateral or inferolateral wall grafting. Dividing or removing the endothoracic fascia, skeletonizing the IMA during harvest, and dividing the left pericardium vertically toward the left phrenic nerve at the level of the pulmonary artery all provide for extra length and less tension on the anastomosis.

Several pericardial traction sutures are placed to assist with exposure and lateral displacement of the heart. To avoid compression on the right heart during lateral displacement, the right pericardium can be dissected along the diaphragm or the right pleural space opened widely to allow the heart to fall into the right chest during lateral displacement. An important traction suture is the "deep stitch," which is placed approximately two-thirds of the way between the inferior vena cava and left pulmonary vein at the point where the pericardium reflects over the posterior left atrium (Fig. 21-1). Care should be taken with placement of this suture to avoid the underlying descending thoracic aorta, esophagus, left lung, and adjacent inferior pulmonary vein. This suture should be covered with a soft rubber catheter to prevent laceration of the epicardium during retraction. Furthermore, the manual elevation and compression of the heart required to take this stitch may be poorly tolerated in patients with marginal hemodynamics or significant left main coronary artery disease. In that case,

**FIGURE 21-1** View from surgeon's side of the table. The heart is elevated toward the surgeon and superiorly for placement of the "deep stitch," which is placed two-thirds of the way between the inferior vena cava and inferior left pulmonary vein. With rightward retraction of the heart, the right-sided pericardial traction sutures should be relaxed to prevent compression of the right atrium and right ventricle.

grafting and reperfusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) should be accomplished before placing the deep pericardial traction suture.

#### **Epiaortic Ultrasound**

Epiaortic ultrasonography is used in all of our patients undergoing cardiac surgery, including OPCAB. It is a simple, noninvasive, and inexpensive tool for assessing the extent of atheromatous disease in the ascending aorta in preparation for aortic clamping or selection of an alternative clampless technique.9 Epiaortic ultrasound has been shown to be superior to transesophageal echocardiography or palpation alone in identifying aortic atheromatous lesions, especially in the mid- to distal ascending aorta. 10-12 The 8.5-MHz linear array probe is placed inside a sterile sleeve filled with sterile saline to act as a medium between the probe and the surface of the aorta (Fig. 21-2). The information allows the surgeon to individualize placement of aortic clamps and proximal anastomotic devices to minimize the risk of atheroembolism. In our practice, for aortic atherosclerosis grades 1 to 2 (Table 21-2), we will use a side-biting clamp or promixal anastomosis device. We will not clamp or manipulate grades 3 to 5, due to the risk of embolization. Rosenberger and coworkers, 13 evaluated greater than 6000 patients with epiaortic ultrasound, suggested that the operative course was changed in 4% of patients because of the finding of aortic pathology, resulting in improved neurologic outcomes. Currently, intraoperative epiaortic ultrasound scanning is performed in only a small minority of centers. More data linking epiaortic ultrasonography to successful intraoperative decision-making and clinical outcomes should help to drive broader adoption of this promising diagnostic modality.

#### **Exposure**

Cardiac positioners and stabilizers have greatly increased the ability to manipulate the heart with minimal hemodynamic compromise. The two systems routinely used in our institution are the Medtronic Octopus Tissue Stabilizer and Starfish or Urchin Heart Positioner (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN) and the Maquet ACROBAT stabilizer and XPOSE positioner (Maquet, Radstat, Germany). Cardiac positioning devices are frequently placed away from the apex, especially to the left of the apex, to expose the lateral wall and branches of the left circumflex coronary artery (Figs. 21-3 and 21-4). They are generally placed on the apex to expose the anterior wall (LAD territory) and inferior wall (posterior descending territory) of the heart and may be placed on the acute margin to expose the right coronary artery (RCA; Fig. 21-5). The suction-based positioning is well tolerated as the heart is not compressed, thus maintaining its functional geometry. The coronary stabilizer

![](_page_3_Picture_12.jpeg)

**FIGURE 21-3** View from head of table. With the cardiac positioning device placed slightly away from the apex, the lateral wall can be exposed. The coronary stabilizers can then be placed to provide exposure and stabilization of obtuse marginal vessels.

![](_page_4_Picture_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 21-4** View from the head of table. An obtuse marginal artery is prepared for grafting. After positioning the coronary stabilizer, a silastic vessel loop is doubly passed around the proximal coronary artery to allow transient occlusion during the anastomosis.

![](_page_4_Picture_4.jpeg)

**FIGURE 21-5** View from the surgeon's side of table. With cardiac positioner placed on the apex, the heart can be easily displaced to expose the inferior wall vessels. Because there is no compression used for displacement, this maneuver is usually accomplished with no hemodynamic sequelae. Note the location of the cardiac positioner and stabilizer on the surgeon's side of the retractor. Alternatively, the stabilizer can be placed on the assistant's side of the retractor. The right pericardial traction sutures are relaxed, and the "deep stitch" is retracted inferolaterally.

devices are placed with minimal tension on the epicardium to allow for an area of mechanical stabilization. The anterior wall vessels often require only the coronary stabilizer for adequate exposure. The stabilizer is positioned along the caudal aspect of the retractor toward the left, with the retractor arm placed out of the way to prevent interference during the anastomosis. For the lateral and inferior wall vessels, the cardiac positioner is usually placed on the surgeon's side at the most cephalad location of the retractor. A general rule is to put the stabilizer in the assistant's way instead of the surgeon's to prevent these devices from obstructing the surgeon's view or interfering with hand positioning during suture placement.

In addition to positioners and stabilizers, manipulating the traction sutures can greatly enhance exposure. When the "deep stitch" is retracted toward the patient's feet, it elevates the heart toward the ceiling and points the apex vertically with remarkably little change in hemodynamics. When retracted toward the patient's left side, the heart rotates from left to right, exposing the lateral wall vessels. Variable tension on this stitch will enhance exposure to both the anterior and lateral wall. The left-sided pericardial sutures should be pulled taut and the right-sided sutures completely relaxed to avoid compression on the right heart during cardiac displacement. Pericardial sutures on both the right and left sides should never be under tension simultaneously. Manipulation of the operating table can also facilitate exposure. Placing the patient in steep Trendelenburg exposes the inferior wall. Turning the table sharply toward the right will aid with exposure of the lateral wall targets. For grafting the anterior wall vessels, the "deep stitch" can be pulled toward the patient's left side and a coronary stabilizer can then be positioned to expose the target coronary artery (Fig. 21-6). Occasionally, a warm moist laparotomy pad can be placed between the heart and the posterolateral pericardium to assist with elevating the heart out of the pericardium.

![](_page_4_Figure_8.jpeg)

**FIGURE 21-6** View from surgeon's side of table. With LAD grafting, excellent exposure can be obtained with lateral traction of the "deep stitch" and the coronary stabilizer. Note the right pericardial traction sutures are released from the retractor.

In our experience, the most common mistakes leading to suboptimal exposure are

- Incompletely freeing the left pericardium from the diaphragm
- The "deep stitch" too far from the posterior left atrium
- Not loosening the right-sided pericardial sutures during exposure of the left-sided targets
- Compressing the heart against right pericardium, sternum, or retractor
- Kinking the right ventricular outflow tract by excessive cephalad tilt of the vertical heart
- Failing to combine the techniques of deep stitch, positioning device "off-apex", elevation of the right sternal border on towels, and opening the right pleural space when needed

In preparation for distal anastomosis, a soft silastic retractor tape mounted on a blunt needle (Retract-o-tape, Quest Medical, Inc., Allen, TX) is placed widely around the proximal vessel for transient atraumatic occlusion. For inferior wall vessels, this suture can be displaced posteriorly and caudally by tying a posterior pericardial suture loosely around the retractor tape (Fig. 21-7). The pericardial retraction suture serves as a "pulley" that not only enhances coronary exposure and the surgeon's view, but also keeps this retraction stitch from interfering with the sutures during the anastomosis. The field is kept free of blood with a humidified CO, blower (DLP, Medtronic, Inc.), which is managed by the scrub nurse or second assistant (Fig. 21-8). To avoid injury to the coronary endothelium, the blower should be set at the minimum setting needed for exposure (<5 L CO<sub>2</sub>) and used only when passing the needle through the vessel. Occasionally an epicardial fat retractor can be used to expose the coronary target in patients with a large amount of epicardial fat.

![](_page_5_Picture_10.jpeg)

**FIGURE 21-7** View from the surgeon's side of the table. For inferior vessel exposure (posterior descending or left ventricular branch) the Retract-o-tape is guided out of the surgeon's way through a "pulley" created by placing a loosely tied superficial suture in the posterior diaphragm. The Retract-o-tape can then be retracted to transiently occlude the artery.

![](_page_5_Picture_12.jpeg)

**FIGURE 21-8** View from the head of the table. During the anastomosis, a humidified  $CO_2$  blower managed by the second assistant or scrub nurse is used to expose the LAD.

Although a well-trained first assistant is necessary for providing an effortless anastomosis, the second assistant, often the scrub nurse, also plays a major role in exposure. This assistant usually stands to the right of the surgeon, and controls the CO<sub>2</sub> blower and the Cell Saver (Haemonetics Corp., Braintree, MA). The blower is used to keep the field free of blood and to open the target vessel and graft during suture placement. During the inferior wall or lateral wall targets, the second assistant may provide better exposure by standing to the surgeon's left. In chronically occluded vessels that have collateral and/or retrograde flow, bleeding into the field can be controlled with another retractor tape distally, a MyOcclude device (United States Surgical Corp., Norwalk, CT), or an intracoronary shunt. 14,15 We use intracoronary shunts selectively rather than routinely, as at least one study demonstrated significant endothelial injury with its use. 16 A final preparatory measure is to place temporary atrial or ventricular pacing cables before positioning the heart, particularly before RCA occlusion. As the heart is rotated toward the right, visualization of the right atrium is more difficult, so it is often prudent to place and test these cables before positioning.

# **Coronary Grafting**

The current generation of coronary stabilizers relies on epicardial suction rather than compression to maintain epicardial tissue capture. A common mistake is to press down too hard on the epicardium, which will paradoxically cause both increased movement in the target region and impaired hemodynamics. The malleable pods of the stabilizers can be bent or manipulated in any direction to stabilize the target vessel. If there are concerns about hemodynamic stability during regional ischemia, the proximal vessel can be test occluded

for 2 to 5 minutes and then reperfused, providing "preconditioning" of the subtended myocardium. Although not used routinely, preconditioning with two cycles of 2 minutes of LAD occlusion then 3 minutes of reperfusion before the first coronary anastomosis decreased postoperative myocardial enzyme release, heart rate increase, and restored ventricular function.<sup>17</sup> During this time the graft can be prepared. This gives the surgeon some assurance before committing to the anastomosis by creating an arteriotomy. The anastomosis is otherwise performed in a manner identical to on-pump grafting. It is essential to continue communication with the anesthesia team so that adequate steps can be promptly taken if hemodynamic conditions deteriorate. For example, if pulmonary artery pressures begin to rise and mean arterial pressures begin to fall during a lateral wall anastomosis, several steps can be taken to avoid cardiovascular collapse: gently relaxing on the cardiac positioner or coronary stabilizer, steep Trendelenburg positioning, fluid boluses, inotropes, vasopressors, or pacing. If hemodynamic conditions continue to deteriorate, the safe next step is to place an intracoronary shunt, relax the retractor tape, and release both the stabilizer and positioner, allowing the heart to recover. 15 At this point a decision must be made whether to convert "electively" to an on-pump procedure or complete the procedure off-pump. With better preparation (eg, fluids, inotropes, vasopressors, pacing, and shunt), the anastomosis can usually be completed off-pump. Another option for patients at high risk for complications of CPB is the use of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation for mechanical support during cardiac displacement and positioning.

# Sequence of Grafting

Careful assessment of the cardiac catheterization is imperative. When planning for OPCAB, particular attention needs to be paid to the collateralizing vessel(s), intramyocardial vessels, the size of the distal targets, the degree of stenosis, the complexity of coronary disease, and the number of lateral wall vessels requiring grafting. The sequence of grafting is important as regional myocardial perfusion is temporarily interrupted during anastomosis on the beating heart. As a general rule, the collateralized vessel(s) is grafted first and the collateralizing vessel is grafted last. For example, in patients with an occluded RCA with a posterior descending artery (PDA) supplied by collaterals from the LAD, grafting the LAD first would not only leave the anterior wall ischemic during the anastomosis, but also disrupt flow to the septum, inferior wall, and right ventricle. A more prudent approach would involve grafting the PDA first, then performing a proximal anastomosis to ensure adequate flow to the inferior wall while the proximal LAD is occluded during construction of the IMA-LAD anastomosis. Another scenario that may pose problems is a large moderately stenotic RCA. Not uncommonly, temporary occlusion will result in profound bradycardia and hypotension. The surgeon must be prepared to use an intracoronary shunt or provide temporary epicardial pacing. Additional options include a

"proximals first" approach to allow adequate regional perfusion after completion of each distal anastomosis.

- Perform anastomosis to completely occluded or collateralized vessel first
- If LAD is not a collateralizing vessel, perform LAD-LIMA anastomosis first to allow for anterior wall perfusion during lateral and inferior wall positioning
- Proximal anastomoses can be performed first to allow for perfusion of target vessels after each distal anastomosis.
  This can be helpful when cardiac positioning is not well tolerated
- Beware of a large RCA with moderated proximal stenosis. Acute occlusion can cause bradycardia and hypotension. Be prepared for intracoronary shunt and epicardial pacing
- Patients with moderate MR may not tolerate prolonged cardiac displacement, which can exacerbate MR, and lead to elevated PA pressures and subsequent hemodynamic deterioration. Grafting the culprit vessel causing papillary muscle dysfunction should be performed early in the procedure.

#### **Proximal Anastomosis**

Proximal anastomoses during OPCAB can be performed with the use of an aortic partial-occluding clamp after epiaortic ultrasound rules out aortic atherosclerosis or a proximal anastomosis device. In preparation for an aortic clamp, the systolic blood pressure is lowered (eg, <95 mm Hg), the clamp is applied and aortotomies are made with a 4.0-mm aortic punch. Proximal anastomoses are then performed using 5-0 or 6-0 polypropylene suture. Before tying down the most anterior proximal anastomosis, the clamp is released and the aorta is de-aired through the proximal anastomosis with clamps on vein grafts. After the suture is tied down, the vein grafts can be de-aired with a 25-gauge needle and clamps removed. Arterial grafts are not punctured but are allowed to bleed backward before clamp removal.

Unlike ONCAB, OPCAB provides the opportunity to minimize or completely avoid manipulation of the aorta by performing proximal anastomoses to in situ arterial grafts, or using clampless proximal anastomotic devices. 18-21 This is particularly relevant in patients with advanced aortic atheromatous disease detected by epiaortic ultrasound. Commercially available devices for clampless proximal anastomoses include the Heartstring III (Maquet Cardiovascular LLC, San Jose, CA), the PAS-Port Proximal Anastomosis System (Cardica Inc., Redwood City, CA), and the Enclose II (Vitalitec, Plymouth, MA). The Heartstring and Enclose devices create a near hemostatic seal with the inner surface of the ascending aorta that allows the creation of a hand-sewn anastomosis with a relatively bloodless field (Fig. 21-9). In contrast, the PAS-Port Proximal Anastomosis System is a fully integrated and automated system that attaches the vein graft to the aorta, instantaneously producing a reproducible anastomosis.<sup>21-23</sup>

![](_page_7_Picture_2.jpeg)

![](_page_7_Picture_3.jpeg)

**FIGURE 21-9** Proximal anastomoses can be performed without the use of an aortic clamp with either a Heartstring III (in these figures) or the PAS-Port device. The Heartstring III device requires a hand-sewn anastomosis, whereas the PAS-Port device is an automated anastomosis.

#### **Graft Flow Measurement**

We routinely quantitate graft flow using an intraoperative transit-time doppler flow meter (Medistim, Oslo, Norway). Acceptable values are flow > 15 mL/min, pulsatility index (the difference of maximum and minimum flow divided by the mean flow) <5 and diastolic fraction > 50% (for left-sided grafts). A post hoc analysis of the Veterans Affairs Randomized On/Off Bypass (ROOBY) Trial found that lower graft patency (non-FitzGibbon grade A) at 1 year was associated with low flow (<20 mL/min) or high pulsatility index (3-5 and >5) during intraoperative flow probe measurements.<sup>24</sup> Thus, any values outside of this range should alert the surgeon to examine the anastamoses and graft for

potential revision unless unfavorable characteristics of the conduit, native coronary artery or distal run-off can readily account for the suboptimal doppler findings.

# On-Pump Beating Heart Coronary Artery Bypass

Performing beating heart coronary artery bypass with CPB support is especially useful in certain clinical scenarios such as acute coronary syndromes with cardiogenic shock or in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction where cardiac positioning and displacement will not be tolerated. On-pump, beating heart techniques provide hemodynamic support while avoiding aortic clamping and the global ischemic insult associated with cardioplegic arrest. Powever, this is an uncommonly used technique.

#### **Outcomes**

Clinical outcomes have been compared between OPCAB and ONCAB and reported for over a decade. There is a general consensus that either approach yields excellent outcomes in low-risk patients. In select higher-risk patients, it appears in recent studies that OPCAB may reduce both morbidity and mortality. These studies can generally be divided into smaller prospective RCT and larger retrospective analyses. Prospective RCTs provide the most accurate comparison between groups and avoid surgical selection bias and confounding inherent to retrospective and observational analyses. On the other hand, retrospective and observational analyses provide much larger sample sizes with longer duration of follow-up and have included more high-risk patients, but are limited by their retrospective nature and inherent selection bias despite the use of propensity matching or other advanced statistical methodologies designed to control for confounding variables. Because of their larger size, small differences in outcomes can often be detected. Taken together, both types of studies can provide valuable information to guide clinical practice.

## **Operative Mortality**

In the major prospective randomized large-scale, multicenter OPCAB trials, there have been no differences in operative mortality between on- and off-pump approaches. ROOBY was the first large-scale multicenter RCT comparing OPCAB and ONCAB in 2203 patients at Veterans Affairs Centers.<sup>2</sup> There was no difference in the short term primary composite endpoint of death or major complications before discharge or within 30 days between (OPCAB 7.0 vs ONCAB 5.6%, p = .19; Table 21-3). However, OPCAB was associated with higher incidence of the composite endpoint of mortality, myocardial infarction (MI) and repeat revascularization at 1 year (9.9 vs 7.4%, p = .04). The major criticisms of this study were insufficient surgeon experience (minimum 20 OPCAB cases; average 120 and median 50 cases), residents/trainees as

the primary surgeon in 64% of OPCAB cases and a relatively young and healthy male patient population, a subset that one may not expect to benefit greatly from avoidance of CPB.

The ROOBY Trial was followed by two subsequent large RCTs, the CABG Off or On Pump Revascularization Study (CORONARY)1,29 and the German Off-Pump CABG in Elderly (GOPCABE) Trial.3 The CORONARY study randomized 4752 high-risk patients to OPCAB versus ONCAB and is the largest international multicenter RCT to date. The co-primary endpoints were death, stroke, MI, or dialysis at 30 days and 1 year, and death, stroke, MI, dialysis, repeat revascularization at 5 years. Surgeons were required to have >2 years experience after residency training and >100 cases of OPCAB; trainees could not be the primary surgeon. The majority of patients had additive EuroSCORE 3 to 5, thus being higher risk. This trial also did not find differences between OPCAB and ONCAB in composite primary endpoint of mortality, MI and stroke neither at 30 days (9.8 vs 10.3%, p = .59) nor at 1 year (12.1 vs 13.3, p = .24). However,

there was a trend towards benefit with OPCAB for patients in higher EuroSCORE. GOPCABE was a multicenter randomized trial of 2539 high-risk patients (mean logistic EuroS-CORE 8.3) ≥75 years of age comparing OPCAB versus ONCAB. Importantly, OPCAB was "routinely performed at all participating centers" and surgeons had an average 514 cases and median 322 cases with OPCAB. There was no difference in the primary endpoint, a composite risk of death, stroke, MI, repeat revascularization, or new renal replacement therapy at 30 days (7.8 vs 8.2%, p = .74) and at 1 year (13.1 vs 14.0%, p = .48).

Several registry studies powered by their large sample size were able to detect significant differences in adverse outcomes among a broad population of patients, suggesting that operative mortality may be reduced in patients undergoing OPCAB compared with ONCAB. In a study by Hannan et al,<sup>30</sup> 49,830 patients from the New York State registry underwent risk-adjusted analysis (Cox proportional hazard models and propensity analysis) comparing outcomes after

OPCAB versus ONCAB. In this study, OPCAB patients had significantly lower 30-day mortality (adjusted OR 0.81, 95% CI: 0.68 to 0.97, p = .0022). A large registry study of CABG outcomes in California demonstrated a significant reduction in propensity-adjusted operative mortality with OPCAB compared with ONCAB (2.59%, 95% CI: 2.52 to 2.67 vs 3.22%, 95% CI: 3.17 to 3.27%).<sup>31</sup> An intention-to-treat retrospective analysis of 42,477 patients from the STS ACSD showed a reduction in risk-adjusted operative mortality (adjusted OR 0.83, p = .03) as well as numerous morbidity outcomes favoring patients undergoing OPCAB (Fig. 21-10).<sup>32</sup> However, Chu and associates used an administrative database (Nationwide Inpatient Sample database) of 63,000 patients, and found no difference in hospital mortality between OPCAB and ONCAB (3.0 vs 3.2%, p = .14).<sup>33</sup>

# Hospital Mortality in Patients Converted to On-Pump

A major complication of OPCAB is the emergent conversion to CPB support due to profound and acute hemodynamic compromise, either because of regional ischemia, valvular regurgitation from positioning, bradycardia during right-sided or inferior wall grafting, hypotension during cardiac positioning and stabilization, or intractable ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation. Such emergent conversion ("crash on pump") to ONCAB is associated with significantly higher perioperative morbidity and mortality. Several studies quote mortality specifically for converted patients ranging from 6 to 15%. <sup>34-38</sup> The ROOBY Trial had a 12.4% conversion rate from off- to on-pump CABG, roughly five-fold higher

than the rate reported in the STS ACSD.<sup>32</sup> Of these, 49.3% were elective conversions, mainly for poor visibility, whereas, 50.8% were urgent or emergent, mainly for hemodynamic instability.<sup>39</sup> The 1-year composite outcome of all-cause mortality, MI, and revascularization was significantly worse in the converted versus nonconverted OPCAB patients (21.1 vs 13.7%, p = .03). Importantly, 75% of conversions were associated with surgeons with experience of <100 OPCAB cases. Furthermore, a retrospective study of 8077 OPCAB cases used to identify risk factors for on-pump conversion confirmed surgeon experience to be the most significant multivariable predictor.<sup>40</sup> Importantly, there does not appear to be an increased risk of complications in patients who are *electively* converted to ONCAB.

## Mid- and Long-Term Mortality

More recently, mid- and long-term follow-up data has become available in patients undergoing OPCAB. 1,3,41-46 There was no difference in 1-year mortality in the ROOBY (4.1 vs 2.9%, p = .15), CORONARY (5.1 vs 5.0%) or GOPCABE Trials (7.0 vs 8.0%, p = .38) comparing OPCAB and ONCAB. However, with sensitivity analysis, 1-year death from cardiac causes was slightly higher in the off-pump group compared with the on-pump group (2.7 vs 1.3%, p = .03) in ROOBY. The SMART Trial randomized 200 patients to OPCAB versus ONCAB by a single, experienced off-pump coronary surgeon. 46 In this trial, there was no difference in late survival (mean 7.5 years) (Fig. 21-11, p = .33), graft patency, recurrent angina nor repeat catheterization. Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis reports a trend towards improved long-term survival with ONCAB (HR 1.06; 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.13, p = .05) amongst all studies but there was no difference when analysis was limited to RCTs and propensity-matched studies.<sup>47</sup> Finally, in the observational study by Hannan et al,<sup>30</sup> 3-year survival was equivalent in OPCAB versus ONCAB patients (adjusted hazard ratio 1.01, 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.10, p = .89; unadjusted 3-year survival 89.4 vs 90.1%, log-rank test, p = .20). Based on these studies, it is reasonable to conclude that long-term survival after CABG is not affected by an on- or off-pump approach for the majority of patients.

## Perioperative Morbidity

Large prospective and retrospective studies have consistently shown reduction in perioperative morbidities with OPCAB. In a meta-analysis of 37 randomized trials comparing OPCAB with ONCAB, OPCAB was associated with a reduced incidence of atrial fibrillation (OR 0.58; 95% CI: 0.44 to 0.77), transfusion requirements (OR 0.43; 95% CI: 0.29 to 0.65), inotrope requirements (OR 0.48; 95% CI: 0.29 to 0.65), respiratory infections (OR 0.41; 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.74), ventilation time (weighted mean difference, –3.4 hours; 95% CI: –5.1 to –1.7 hours), intensive care unit stay (OR weighted mean difference, –0.3 days; 95% CI: –0.6 to –0.1 days), and hospital stay (weighted mean difference, –1.0 days; 95% CI: –1.5 to –0.5 days). Similarly, in a propensity score analysis of 548 patients,

OPCAB was associated with significantly lower in-hospital mortality (0.5 vs 2.9%; p = .001), incidence of stroke (0 vs 0.9%; p = .02), postoperative renal dysfunction (4.9 vs 10.8%; p = .001), pulmonary complications (10.2 vs 16.6%; p = .002), and infections (3.5 vs 6.2%; p = .03).<sup>49</sup>

## **Neurologic Outcomes**

Stroke remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after CABG, occurring in approximately 1 to 14% of patients. 50,51 In addition, long-term survival after stroke post-CABG is negatively impacted with reductions in 1- and 5-year survival to 66% and 44% compared with 94% and 81% without stroke.<sup>51</sup> Recently, more attention is being focused on the observation that a large proportion of strokes is embolic in nature and occurs at the time of clamp removal.<sup>52</sup> Other potential sources of emboli include carotid artery disease, particulate matter aspirated from cardiotomy suction, delayed thromboembolism from clamp injuries to the ascending aortic intima or proximal anastomotic sites, or left atrial thrombi secondary to postoperative atrial fibrillation. Additional iatrogenic causes of emboli (gaseous) may include aggressive use of carbon dioxide blower devices to facilitate visualization during construction of proximal anastomoses.

It is clear that less aortic manipulation results in fewer stroke events. 53,54 Studies utilizing transcranial Doppler ultrasonography have confirmed the production of aortic emboli associated with cannulation, CPB, and application of aortic clamps. 55-57 Bowles 8 et al used transcranial Doppler ultrasonography to demonstrate production of large quantities of aortic emboli during CPB, even without manipulation of the aorta. Furthermore, Kapetanakis and colleagues 3 and Calafiore and associates 4 concluded that aortic manipulation is independently associated with an increased risk of postoperative stroke. Approaches used to decrease this embolic load include avoidance of aortic cannulation using off-pump techniques, avoidance of multiple aortic clamping, use of

clampless anastomotic devices, and a completely no-touch aortic technique. 60-62 Kim and associates 63 reported a lower incidence of postoperative stroke in patients undergoing OPCAB without any manipulation of the aorta compared with patients undergoing OPCAB with partial clamping and patients undergoing ONCAB. In 12,079 patients undergoing OPCAB, Moss et al<sup>53</sup> found progressively lower rates of stroke in no-touch aortic (0.6%), versus clampless facilitating device (1.2%) versus side-biting clamp (1.5%) (Fig. 21-12). Emmert et al<sup>64</sup> report a significantly lower incidence of stroke for OPCAB with partial occlusion clamp versus ONCAB (1.1 vs 2.4%; OR 0.35; CI: 95%: 0.17 to 0.72; p < .005)and even lower rates for OPCAB using a proximal occlusion device versus partial occlusion clamp (0.7 vs 2.3%; OR 0.39; CI: 95%: 0.16 to 0.90; p = .04) which approached that of the no-touch group (0.8%).

Large retrospective analyses<sup>30,32,43,65-68</sup> have demonstrated that OPCAB may be associated with a reduced incidence of stroke compared with ONCAB, but this has not been borne out in the large-scale RCTs. Hannan et al<sup>30</sup> reported a riskadjusted decrease in postoperative stroke with OPCAB compared with ONCAB (adjusted OR 0.70, 95% CI: 0.57 to 0.86, p = .0006). A meta-analysis of 59 randomized trials of OPCAB versus ONCAB (N = 8961) report a 30% reduction in stroke (RR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.49 to 0.99; Fig. 21-13).68 Of 2468 patients in the CREDO-Kyoto Registry that underwent surgical revascularization, ONCAB was associated with higher stroke (OR 8.30, 95% CI: 2.25 to 30.7; p = .01) but only in the highest risk patient tertile (logistic EuroSCORE ≥ 6).69 The observed reduction in postoperative stroke is likely due to lack of aortic cannulation and CPB, and possibly due to lack of aortic manipulation during proximal anastomoses. However, as mentioned, there was no difference in the rates of stroke in the large RCTs. 1-3,29 Notably, the method of construction of proximal anastomosis was left up to the surgeon and was not reported. Thus, if a significant number were performed with a side-biting clamp versus a minimal or no-touch

**FIGURE 21-13** Forest plot for stroke.

aortic approach, the potential benefits of OPCAB with regard to postoperative stroke may have been attenuated.

#### Renal Failure

Preoperative renal insufficiency is a significant predictor of postoperative renal failure and mortality in patients undergoing CABG.<sup>70</sup> In multiple studies, OPCAB has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with normal renal function,<sup>71,72</sup> those with renal dysfunction not yet on hemodialysis<sup>73</sup> as well as those with end-stage renal failure on dialysis.<sup>74</sup> In a prospective randomized trial of 116 diabetic patients with preoperative nondialysis-dependent renal insufficiency, the use of CPB was associated with a significant increase in adverse renal outcomes.<sup>73</sup> Two retrospective analyses, however, reported equivalent renal outcomes with either OPCAB or ONCAB.<sup>74,75</sup> Thus, the advantages of OPCAB to minimize or avoid renal dysfunction remain controversial.

## High-Risk Patients

Several studies have documented improved outcomes in higher-risk patients undergoing OPCAB. Specifically, such higher-risk groups include women<sup>32</sup> and patients with left ventricular dysfunction,<sup>77,78</sup> ST-elevation MI,<sup>79</sup> prior stroke,<sup>67</sup> advanced age, 80 renal insufficiency, 74,81 reoperative cardiac surgery,<sup>82,83</sup> cirrhosis,<sup>84</sup> at the extremes of the BMI (<25 or >35) spectrum,85 and in the patients with high Society of Thoracic Surgeon's predicted risk scores.<sup>86,87</sup> In such patients, improved end-organ perfusion, myocardial protection, limited aortic manipulation, and avoidance of systemic inflammation may explain the observed difference in major morbidity and mortality. A study of patients with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction < 30%) in the STS ACSD report lower adjusted risk of death (OR 0.82), stroke (OR 0.67), major adverse cardiac events (OR 0.75), and prolonged intubation (OR 0.78) with OPCAB versus on-pump CABG.85 Furthermore, Puskas and colleagues<sup>87</sup> reported that patients in the highest risk quartile had a significant reduction in hospital mortality with OPCAB compared with ONCAB (3.2) vs 6.7%, p < .0001, OR 0.45 95% CI: 0.33 to 0.63, p < .0001; Fig. 21-14). Also, as mentioned, the CORONARY Trials results showed a trend in improved outcomes for those patients in the highest EuroSCORE tertile.1

There is some evidence that OPCAB confers improved survival with emergent revascularization for acute coronary syndrome. 88-91 Although the safety and feasibility of OPCAB in select emergency situations has been confirmed, most surgeons today would argue against OPCAB in unstable patients.

### Completeness of Revascularization, Graft Patency, and Need for Repeat Revascularization

Completeness of revascularization is critical for the success and durable benefit of CABG. 92,93 The index of completeness

![](_page_12_Figure_10.jpeg)

**FIGURE 21-14** Regression curve comparison of observed mortality rates for off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) across all levels of predicted risk. STS = The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

of revascularization is defined as number of grafts performed divided by number deemed necessary preoperatively (number of graftable vessels with angiographically significant stenoses), which is more important than the absolute number of grafts. <sup>94</sup> The choice to perform a procedure off-pump should not compromise the completeness of revascularization unless the use of CPB poses obvious and significant risk for postoperative complications or mortality, which may be the case in patients with severe atherosclerotic disease of the ascending aorta. In centers that routinely perform the large majority of coronary operations without CPB, complete revascularization, even in the more difficult lateral wall territory, is routinely accomplished.

The ability to provide complete revascularization with equivalent graft patency OPCAB techniques has been challenged, to provide complete revascularization with OPCAB techniques with equivalent graft patency has been challenged, although the majority of evidence from randomized trials suggests near-equivalent revascularization. 1-3,5,6,95-97,46 In the ROOBY Trial, there were more patients with fewer grafts completed overall (2.9 vs 3.0, p = .002) and fewer than originally planned in the OPCAB group (17.8 vs 11.1%).2 In the CORONARY Trial, there were also fewer grafts (3.0 vs 3.2, p < .001) and a trend towards higher rates of incomplete revascularization (11.8 vs 10.0%, p = .05) in the OPCAB compared to ONCAB group. 1,29 Again, in the GOPCABE Trial, OPCAB was associated with fewer grafts (2.7 vs 2.8, p < .001) and higher incomplete revascularization (34.0%) vs 29.3%).3 The DOORS Trial was a multicenter randomized trial of 900 patients ≥70 years of age, which compared OPCAB versus ONCAB with the same heparinization protocol. They also report statistically fewer grafts being performed with OPCAB (3.1 vs 2.9%, p = .007).<sup>5,6</sup> A meta-analysis of randomized trials has consistently shown a lower number of grafts per patient in off-pump versus on-pump CABG (2.6 vs 2.8, < .0001).<sup>98</sup> Even analysis of later trials in which surgeon experience was greater still showed fewer grafts performed off-pump versus on-pump (2.7 vs 2.9 grafts).<sup>99</sup> In a study of the STS ACSD by Puskas and colleagues,<sup>32</sup> OPCAB patients had a slightly lower index of complete revascularization than ONCAB patients. Thus, OPCAB is consistently associated with a statistically significant but small difference in absolute number of grafts performed. Given equivalent survival between OPCAB and ONCAB, whether the difference in revascularization is clinically significant is unknown.

Graft patency has been evaluated in several randomized trials, demonstrating that in experienced centers, graft patency can be equivalently excellent with either technique. 46,100 However, Shroyer et al<sup>2</sup> found that the overall rate of graft patency (driven by vein graft patency) was lower in the OPCAB group compared with the ONCAB group (82.6 vs 87.8%, p < .001). A further blinded follow-up angiographic analysis in 685 OPCAB and 685 ONCAB patients in ROOBY revealed that OPCAB was associated with lower FitzGibbon A patency for arterial conduits (85.8 vs 91.4%; p = .003) and saphenous vein grafts (72.7 vs 80.4%; p < .001). 101 As expected, ineffective revascularization was associated with greater 1-year nonfatal MI and repeat revascularization. In the DOORS Trial, OPCAB was associated with a greater incidence of graft stenosis (9 vs 5%) and occlusion (12 vs 9%) (p = .01), which was primarily seen in vein grafts at 6-month angiography.<sup>5,6</sup> Again, this may be an issue of experience. In the SMART trial, Puskas et al<sup>46</sup> randomized patients to either OPCAB versus on-pump CABG and demonstrated similarly excellent 1-year graft patency (93.6% for OPCAB vs 95.8% for ONCAB, p = .33) as well as clinical outcomes of death, stroke, MI, and reintervention. There was an increase in the rate of repeat revascularization (0.7 vs 0.2%, p = .01) in the CORONARY Trial, although whether this is a result of lower graft patency or greater incomplete revascularization alone is unknown.<sup>1</sup> A meta-analysis of 12 RCTs comparing OPCAB versus on-pump CABG showed an increased risk of graft occlusion (RR 1.35; 95% CI: 1.16 to 1.57), driven by saphenous vein graft occlusion (RR 1.41; 95% CI: 1.24 to 1.60) but not occlusion of IMA nor radial artery grafts. 102

The New York registry data from Hannan et al<sup>30</sup> report that OPCAB was associated with lower in-hospital mortality and morbidity and equivalent long-term outcomes than ONCAB but greater need for repeat revascularization (93.6 vs 89.9%). However, because this was a retrospective analysis, this study was unable to differentiate whether this difference was a result of incomplete revascularization during OPCAB, reduced graft patency, or unrecognized confounding variables.

#### Guidelines

The 2011 ACCF/AHA Guideline for Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery included two recommendations regarding OPCAB<sup>103</sup>: OPCAB to reduce bleeding and blood

transfusion (Class IIa, Level of Evidence A) and OPCAB for patients with renal dysfunction (Class IIb, Level of Evidence B). More recently, the strength of data in support of OPCAB is recognized in the 2014 European Society of Cardiology/ European Association of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery Guidelines on Myocardial Revascularization. Here the recommendation is that OPCAB be performed in high-risk patients in experienced off-pump centers (Class IIa, Level of Evidence B) and in patients with ascending aortic atherosclerosis (Class I, Level of Evidence B). Furthermore, these guidelines recommend routine use of intraoperative graft flow measurements (Class IIa, Level of Evidence C).

# Minimally Invasive, Robotic, and Hybrid Approaches

Widespread familiarity with off-pump techniques has facilitated the development and application of sternal-sparing minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS) revascularization procedures for highly selected patients. There are several different variations. A small thoracotomy has been used to accomplish LIMA harvest and off-pump bypass on the anterior wall under direct vision, known as single vessel small thoracotomy (SVST), or for multivessel, known as multivessel small thoracotomy (MVST). Thoracoscopic or roboticassisted left IMA dissection and harvest can be followed by a direct off-pump anastomosis to the LAD (Fig. 21-15) or by a total endoscopic LIMA-LAD anastomosis; the latter is referred to as totally endoscopic CABG (TECAB). Hybrid coronary revascularization (HCR) combines a minimally invasive LIMA to LAD graft with percutaneous intervention to non-LAD targets. 105,106 The feasibility of these alternative minimally invasive approaches has been demonstrated. The use of minimally invasive techniques has generated enthusiasm in the surgical and interventional communities, and its use is expanding beyond a few select centers.

For patients with anterior single vessel disease, a SVST offers a sternal-sparing incision with the long-term patency benefit

![](_page_13_Picture_11.jpeg)

**FIGURE 21-15** After endoscopic or robotic-assisted IMA harvest, a direct hand-sewn anastomosis can be performed off-pump via a left anterolateral non-rib spreading minithoracotomy.

of the LIMA graft. Blazek et al<sup>107</sup> show equivalent 7-year survival in 130 patients with single vessel LAD disease randomized to MIDCAB versus DES-PCI. There was no difference in the composite primary endpoint of all-cause mortality, MI, and repeat revascularization but with significantly higher repeat revascularization after PCI (HR 13.50, 95% CI: 1.76 to 103.29; p < .001). Moreover, a single center propensity scorematched minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) versus DES-PCI comparison found at 10 years that DES-PCI was associated with a 2.2-fold increased risk of mortality as well as a 2.0-fold increased risk of repeat revascularization.<sup>108</sup> Multivessel small thoracotomy CABG offers complete revascularization with lower blood transfusion, incidence of chest wound infection, and improved postoperative physical recovery.<sup>109</sup> In their series of direct MVST CABG of which 75% were performed off-pump, Ruel and colleagues<sup>110</sup> report 92% and 100% 6-month graft patency for all grafts and for LIMA grafts, respectively.

Several experienced groups have reported successful outcomes using a robotic CABG approach. 111-113 Halkos et al 111 report 1.3% 30-day mortality, 5.2% conversion to sternotomy and 2.3% reexploration for bleeding for 307 consecutive robotic CABG procedures. For the 199 patients with predischarge follow-up angiography, LIMA-LAD patency was 95.0% and anastomotic lesions were found in only three patients. Srivastava et al 112 describe robotic multivessel CABG with bilateral IMA off-pump distal anastomoses constructed with the U-Clip Anastomotic Device (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN). Bonaros et al 113 also present the largest experience of 500 cases of single and multivessel robotic CABG with onpump distal anastomoses, reporting excellent results.

As described by Harskamp et al,114 the concept of HCR stems from the hypothesis that (1) the LIMA-LAD is superior to coronary stenting and (2) contemporary DES-PCI is noninferior to venous bypass grafts used for non-LAD disease. Thus, patients with multivessel disease with a complex LAD lesion and noncomplex non-LAD lesions suitable for PCI, may be considered. Those patients with impediments to conventional CABG such as those with advanced age, frailty, obesity, lack of conduits, poor non-LAD target vessels, and porcelain aorta may be particularly suited for HCR. In the 2011 ACCF/AHA Guideline for Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery, HCR is considered reasonable in patients with limitations to traditional CABG, such as heavily calcified proximal aorta or poor target vessels for CABG; lack of conduits; or unfavorable LAD artery for PCI (Class IIa, Level of Evidence B). 103 Furthermore, HCR may be reasonable as an alternative to multivessel PCI or CABG in an attempt to improve the overall risk-benefit ratio (Class IIb, Level of Evidence C). The 2014 European Society of Cardiology/European Association of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery Guidelines on Myocardial Revascularization suggests HCR for redo revascularization when lack of conduit poses a limitation to a conventional surgical approach (Class IIb, Level of Evidence C). 104

In experienced minimally invasive revascularization centers, the major clinical outcomes of HCR are equivalent to

traditional CABG. 115 Halkos et al 116 performed a propensitymatched study comparing patients with multivessel coronary disease who underwent endoscopic-assisted or robotic LIMA harvest with SVST direct LIMA-LAD grafting versus OPCAB. There was no difference in 5-year survival but there were fewer blood transfusions (p < .001) and more repeat revascularizations with HCR (12.2 vs 3.7%, p < .001). A meta-analysis of six retrospective studies found that HCR was associated with no difference in freedom from MACCE at 1 year when compared with CABG but a greater incidence of repeat revascularization (Fig. 21-16).<sup>114</sup> Considering that the major weakness of HCR is in-stent restenosis or thrombosis requiring repeat revascularization, young, healthy patients may benefit more from conventional CABG. In the STS ACSD, there are 950 HCR cases (0.5% of all CABG cases) between 2011 and 2013, performed in 1/3 of all cardiac centers.117 Patients who underwent HCR had higher cardiovascular risk profiles compared with traditional CABG and after adjustment, there was no differences in the composite of in-hospital mortality and major morbidity.

# Surgical Revascularization Centers of Excellence

A recurring issue in evaluation of data from RCTs comparing OPCAB versus ONCAB continues to be that of surgeon expertise. There is no doubt that OPCAB is more technically challenging for the surgeon and surgical team. Mastery of this procedure requires experience and team commitment. A review of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample Database reported a 5% decrease in the absolute probability of mortality with OPCAB between the highest and lowest volume surgeon cohorts, with the threshold for the largest improvement occurring after 50 cases/year and the lower mortality above 150 cases/year. Notably, in this study, surgeons performed 105 OPCAB procedures per year (mean), which is significantly higher than the STS reported average.

As mentioned, ROOBY was criticized for lack of surgeon experience with off-pump procedures. In CORONARY and GOPCABE Trials, surgeons were considerably more experienced with off-pump procedures and in both trials, there were no differences in the primary composite endpoints. The difference in expertise was also highlighted by an OPCAB-to-ONCAB crossover rates of 12.4% for ROOBY versus 7.9% and 9.7% for CORONARY and GOPCABE, respectively. Finally, a meta-analysis of >100,000 patients comparing OPCAB versus ONCAB by Takagi et al open an increase in long-term all-cause mortality with OPCAB. But in the two largest RCTs in which expertise was defined as >2 years of experience and the completion of >100 OPCAB procedures, there was no difference in mid-term outcomes.

As such, there is increasing appreciation that OPCAB should be performed not by all surgeons at all surgical centers, but by experts in surgical revascularization at centers of excellence. To meet the technical challenges of performing successful OPCAB, young surgeons must train with established experts in surgical revascularization. Training in advanced

surgical revascularization may include OPCAB, hybrid, total arterial, minimally invasive, and robotic revascularization. Complex revascularization cases should be referred to revascularization centers of excellence. This is a model that is well-established for cardiac surgical treatment of heart failure as well as complex valvular and aortic disease.

#### **KEY POINTS**

- The choice of OPCAB versus ONCAB requires careful attention to preoperative and intraoperative patient variables that may influence operative circumstances as well as short- and long-term morbidity and mortality.
- With the appropriate use of modern stabilizers and heart positioning devices, adequate surgeon experience and careful patient selection, equivalent completeness of revascularization and graft patency can be achieved with OPCAB.
- The quality of the anastomosis and the completeness of revascularization should not be compromised when performing off-pump anastomoses unless CPB poses excessive risk to the patient.
- Urgent or emergent conversion from OPCAB to ONCAB is associated with higher in-hospital morbidity and mortality but preemptive controlled conversion is not.

- Randomized trials have shown equivalent mortality outcomes between OPCAB and ONCAB techniques.
- In particular, low-risk patients undergoing surgical revascularization can be safely revascularized with either OPCAB or ONCAB.
- Certain high-risk groups may have better in-hospital morbidity and mortality outcomes when revascularized without the use of CPB likely due to avoidance of CPB and minimizing aortic manipulation.
- Long-term survival outcomes are equivalent in patients undergoing ONCAB or OPCAB.
- There is an improvement in resource utilization with OPCAB, including reduced transfusion requirements, shorter length of stay, less intensive care and ventilator time, and reduced cost.
