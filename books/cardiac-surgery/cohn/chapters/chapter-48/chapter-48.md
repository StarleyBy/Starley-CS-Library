# Ascending and Arch Aortic Aneurysms

Chase R. Brown • Joseph E. Bavaria • Nimesh D. Desai

The Greek physician Galen first described superficial false aneurysms arising from venesection in the antecubital fossa and in gladiators injured during battle in the second century A.D.¹ Antyllos, during the same time period, distinguished between true and false aneurysms and attempted surgical treatment with proximal and distal ligation, opening of the aneurysmal sac, and removal of its contents.²

The French physician Jean Francois Fernel, in 1542, described aneurysms, "in the chest, or about the spleen and mesentery where a violent throbbing is frequently observable." In 1543, Andeas Versalius described a thoracic aortic aneurysm. In the late 1500s, Ambroise Paré described a death by a ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysm and either Fernel or Paré proposed that syphilis played a causative role in some aortic aneurysms. In 1760, Morgagni reported the first cases of aortic dissection and in 1773, Alexander Monro described three coats of the arterial wall, and the destruction of the wall in the formation of true and false aneurysms. In 1760, Morgagni reported the described three coats of the arterial wall, and the destruction of the wall in the formation of true and false aneurysms.

Peripheral arterial ligation was developed in the 1800s by John Hunter, who demonstrated safe and reproducible means of ligating certain peripheral arteries.<sup>4</sup> Innovative measures used to cause thrombosis of aneurysms included the insertion of long segments of wire<sup>5</sup> with the application of an electric current,<sup>6</sup> and wrapping of aneurysms with cellophane or other irritating materials.<sup>7,8</sup>

In 1888, Rudolph Matas introduced obliterative endoaneurysmorraphy in which stitches placed from within the aneurysm sac obliterated the arterial openings. This allowed closure of large aneurysms that would have been difficult to ligate externally. Recognizing the importance of maintaining arterial continuity for certain aneurysms, he subsequently devised techniques of restorative or reconstructive endoaneurysmorraphy, in which diseased segments of the aneurysm wall were resected and the remaining vessel wall was reconstructed to reestablish flow. The number of aneurysms to which these techniques could be applied, however, was very limited. The broad application of surgical treatment for major arterial aneurysms would have to await the development of satisfactory conduits and the techniques to insert them.

The first report of a descending aortic repair was described by Cooley and DeBakey in 1952. The technique involved lateral resection and aortography performed on a saccular aneurysm without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).<sup>11</sup> In 1956, Cooley and DeBakey performed replacement of the ascending aorta with a segment of homograft with CPB.<sup>12</sup> Polyester cloth grafts were introduced by DeBakey, who discovered it in a Houston department store, and it soon became the artificial conduit of choice for aortic replacement.<sup>13</sup> Technical improvements in graft replacements included the impregnation of polyester grafts with albumin, collagen, or gelatin, which has greatly reduced the blood loss through the grafts.<sup>14</sup>

Wheat et al in 1964, resected the ascending aorta and entire aortic root except for the aortic tissue surrounding the coronary arteries. 15 They then performed a mechanical valve insertion and fashioned the proximal tube graft to accommodate the coronary arteries, which were left in situ. The first composite aortic root replacement was performed by Bentall and De Bono in 1963 to treat an ascending aortic aneurysm in a patient with Marfan syndrome (MFS) who had severe thinning of the aortic wall in the sinus segment. 16 The original technique involved hand sewing a Starr #13 mechanical prosthesis to a preclotted graft (Fig. 48-1). An inclusion-type technique with aortic wrap in which the coronary buttons were left in situ and anastomosed to holes made in the graft was performed. Due to concerns about coronary malposition, in 1981, Cabrol et al described the use of an 8 to 10 mm Dacron graft to attach to independently mobilized coronary artery buttons.<sup>17</sup> Techniques eventually evolved to the current method of individual coronary button reimplantation as described by Kouchoukos and Karp with end-to-end anastomoses as opposed to the inclusion technique which tended to be prone to pseudoaneurysm formation.18

#### **SURGICAL ANATOMY**

The aortic root is in extension of the left ventricular outflow tract and that provides the scaffolding for the elements of the

aortic valve and connects to the descending aorta. Its components include the aortic valve cusps, the sinuses of Valsalva, the aortic annulus and subcommissural triangles, and the sinotubular junction (Fig. 48-2).<sup>19</sup> The aortic valve cusps attach to the aortic annulus at hinge point following a semilunar

contour being a three-pointed crown type arrangement not a circular or oval ring. The annular tissue itself is typically 50 to 60% fibrous tissue along the hinge point between the aortic and mitral valves as well as the membranous portion of the septum, and the remainder is muscular. Small projections of collagen anchor the aortic root to the ventricular muscle.<sup>20</sup> The apices of the attachments of the cusps to the aortic annulus are known as commissures and the most superior aspect of the commissures interrelates with the sinotubular junction. The sinotubular junction is a ridge which marks the beginning of the ascending aorta. The sinotubular junction diameter is typically 15 to 20% smaller than annular diameter in younger patients.<sup>21</sup> With aging, the sinotubular junction diameter becomes larger. When the sinotubular junction is more than 10% larger than the annular diameter there is frequently resultant aortic insufficiency as the leaflets were no longer coapt due to displacement of the commissures.

Between the sinotubular junction and the aortic annulus are expanded segments of the aorta referred to as the sinuses of Valsalva. The sinuses form a cloverleaf rather than circular alignment when viewed in cross-section (Fig. 48-3).<sup>22</sup> Dilatation of the aortic sinuses and annulus is referred to as aortoannular ectasia. Each sinus is named for its corresponding coronary artery (right, left, and noncoronary).

![](_page_2_Picture_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 48-3** Anatomy of the aortic root from a Cardiac Gated CT Angiogram. Note the "cloverleaf" orientation of the sinuses.

The noncoronary sinus is anatomically related to the left and right atria as well as the transverse sinus. The left coronary sinus anatomically relates to the left atrium and the right coronary sinus is related to the right atrium and right ventricle. The subcommissural triangle between the right and noncoronary arteries is anatomically related to the conduction system within the membranous septum as well as the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve. The left and noncoronary subcommissural triangles are related to the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. The ascending aorta starts at the level of the sinotubular junction and ascends to the level of the takeoff of the innominate artery.

#### **PATHOPHYSIOLOGY**

The ascending aorta histologically contains a high proportion of compliant elastic tissue allowing it to serve as a reservoir and that stores kinetic energy from the systolic pulse wave as it expands and uses it to maintain flow during diastole via elastic recoil. The ascending aorta is a three layered structure composed of a smooth intimal layer composed of a single layer of endothelial cells adhered to a basal lamina; a medial layer composed of layers of elastin sheets, collagen, smooth muscle cells, and extracellular matrix; and an outer layer of adventitial tissue which includes the vasa vasorum and nerves.<sup>23</sup> The elastin content of the aorta decreases distally and in the abdominal aorta is less than half of that in the ascending aorta.24 The principle biologic causes of aneurysm formation in the ascending aorta are related to degenerative processes in the elastic media, as compared to primarily atherosclerotic changes in the descending and abdominal aortas.25

Ascending aortic aneurysm formation is the result of several biologic and mechanical mechanisms. Disruption of the

balance between homeostatic mechanisms within the aortic wall including elastic and collagen elements, proteoglycans, proteolytic enzymes and their inhibitors, and inflammatory mediators causes a spectrum of aortic pathology which manifests in the final pathway as a ortic enlargement eventually leading to rupture or dissection. Fragmentation of the extracellular matrix of the aortic media occurs due to matrix-degrading enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases and cathepsin groups. 26-30 Matrix metalloproteinases comprise a family of proteases that are capable of degrading virtually all components of the extracellular milieu and perform a variety of tasks necessary for normal homeostasis, including maintenance of the dynamic integrity of the extracellular structure within the arteries. 26-28 Aneurysms form as elastic layers fragment, smooth muscle cells become dysfunctional, and eventually elastic and smooth muscle components are replaced with a cystic appearing mucoid material (Fig. 48-4).31 This process is referred to as cystic medial degeneration. The term cystic medial necrosis has also been applied to this condition but has been largely

abandoned as there is no true necrotic process involved. To a lesser extent, mild degeneration of the aortic wall is common with advanced age and is responsible for the slow dilation of the ascending aorta with age. Smoking tends to exacerbate this degeneration.<sup>32</sup>

Mechanical changes to aortic wall characteristics such as alterations in cross-sectional symmetry, compliance, and stress-strain relationships likely predate dilatation. The Young-Laplace relationship describes the relationship between aortic diameter and wall tension where increases in aortic wall diameter lead to increases in wall stress at similar pressures (tension = pressure × radius). Changes in aortic wall compliance, broadly defined as the change in volume of the vessel with a change in pressure, lead to increased stress applied to the aortic wall during the systolic impulse and further exacerbate the biologic derangements leading to aneurysm formation.<sup>33</sup> The coupling between mechanical forces on the arterial wall and the biochemical changes leading to aneurysm formation (mechano-transduction) are not yet clearly elucidated.

Degenerative aortic aneurysms cause asymmetric enlargement of the ascending aorta as the segment of aorta along the inner curvature is adherent to the pulmonary artery.<sup>34</sup> Hence, there is significant rightward and anterior displacement of the aortic wall (Fig. 48-5). This causes a relative elongation of

![](_page_3_Picture_5.jpeg)

**FIGURE 48-5** Massively dilated aortic root in a Marfan syndrome patient. Note the severe dilation of the aortic annulus and relative sparing of the proximal arch.

the ascending aorta in an asymmetric fashion which tends to push the heart into a horizontal arrangement. This also causes a significant change in the orientation of the aortic valve annulus to more oblique arrangement.<sup>34</sup> Aneurysmal widening will typically involve the aorta to the level of the sinotubular junction and frequently involves the noncoronary sinus to a lesser extent.<sup>35</sup> This widening at the level of the sinotubular junction is responsible for aortic insufficiency in these cases and frequently placement of tube graft to the sinotubular junction will resolve significant central aortic insufficiency. The left and noncoronary sinuses are fairly normal in these cases. The noncoronary aortic valve cusp may be elongated along its free margin in order to compensate for the asymmetric enlargement of the noncoronary sinus.

#### **SPECIFIC ETIOLOGIES**

#### Marfan Syndrome

MFS is an autosomal dominant syndrome with complete penetrance. Up to 25% of Marfan cases are from sporadic dictation in the overall incidence is one per 3000 to 10,000 live births.<sup>36</sup> Traditionally it is thought to have been caused by alterations in the gene (FBM1) coding the aortic wall protein fibrillin-1 leading to elastin derangement, medial degeneration, and aneurysm formation.<sup>37,38</sup> More recently, homology between fibrillin-1 molecules and latent transforming growth factor (TGF) beta binding proteins has led investigators to infer that altered sequestration of the latent form of TGF beta in the extracellular matrix may increase TGF beta activity which negatively impacts smooth muscle development and the extracellular matrix.<sup>39</sup> Approximately 80% of patients with MFS develop aortic root aneurysms and nearly half develop mitral regurgitation.<sup>40</sup> The clinical manifestations of MFS involve multiple organ systems as it is a systemic disease. Diagnosis has traditionally been made using the Ghent criteria, although it is now made definitively using genotyping.<sup>41</sup> Anatomically, MFS results in severe aortoannular ectasia and can have massively dilated sinuses and aortic annulus (Fig. 48-5).

More recently, reports have shown that the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can prolong the life expectancy of smooth muscle cells in the aortic tissue of Marfan patients via an angiotensin-2 type II receptor blockade mechanism which may antagonize TGF beta. <sup>42</sup> This has led to the clinical application of the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan as a prophylactic therapy to diminish aortic degeneration and aneurysm formation, which has been shown in animal models to be effective when given in the early stages of the disease. <sup>43</sup> A small clinical study of 18 pediatric patients also showed decreased aortic growth rate with treatment of losartan. <sup>44</sup>

# Loeys-Deitz Syndome

Loeys-Deitz syndrome (LDS) is a more recently described autosomal dominant syndrome.<sup>45</sup> Rather than a fibrillin-1

defect, however, there is a mutation in TGF beta receptors 1 and 2. Characteristics of LDS include cleft palate, bifid uvula, scoliosis, orbital hypertelorism, pectus deformities, developmental abnormalities, and congenital heart defects including persistent patent ductus arteriosus and atrial septal defects. <sup>45</sup> Patients may phenotypically have characteristics that overlapped between LDS and MFS. <sup>46</sup> Histologically, it is associated with increased medial collagen and a subtle but diffuse form of elastic fiber fragmentation and extracellular matrix deposition. <sup>47</sup> LDS has a more rapid clinical course than MFS and prophylactic aortic root replacement or reimplantation is often recommended at younger ages and with smaller aortic dimensions.

#### **Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome**

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is caused by either sporadic mutation or inherited autosomal dominant trait resulting in a connective tissue disorder derived from defective type III collagen synthesis. The type IV variant of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is associated with spontaneous arterial rupture. Most commonly this occurs in the mesenteric or carotid arteries. However, spontaneous rupture of the descending aorta and aortic arch has been described. The arterial wall of these patients is extremely thin and friable. Ascending aortic involvement may occur as a consequence of retrograde extension of a primary brachiocephalic branch pathology.

# Familial Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms and Dissections

Approximately 20% of patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms have a first-degree relative with an aortic aneurysm. 49 These families often exhibit strong tendencies for thoracic aortic aneurysm formation without any clearly definable syndromic connective tissue disorder such as MFS or LDS. Grouped together as familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (FTAAD), mutations in ACTA2, SMAD3, TGFBR1, TGFBR2, TGFB2, and MYH11 have been identified to predispose patients to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections in an autosomal dominant manner. These mutations result in incomplete penetrance, variable expression, and variable age of aneurysm onset. 49-55 Genetic testing for patients and family members with multiple first- and seconddegree relatives and suspected FTAAD is available. New evidence suggests that these patients are at increased risk for earlier rupture and dissection at diameters less than 5 cm, as seen in patients with LDS and MFS. Genetic testing has the opportunity to stratify these patients and identify those at greatest risk for rupture.

# Infectious and Inflammatory Etiologies

Infections and systemic inflammatory disorders can occasionally cause damage to the wall of the ascending aorta leading to aneurysm formation. Frequently, despite high-quality

preoperative imaging and even with intraoperative tissue pathology, it is not possible to distinguish definitively between the different possible etiologies.

Ascending aortic aneurysms caused by infection are extremely uncommon. Such mycotic ascending aortic aneurysms are frequently related to concomitant left-sided valvular endocarditis. Most common organisms include, in order of decreasing frequency, *Staphylococcus aureus*, *S. epidermidis*, Salmonella, and Streptococcus.<sup>56</sup> In cases of atherosclerotic aneurysm, if there is intraluminal clot in the ascending aorta, transient bacteremia may lead to infected clot leading to a mycotic aneurysm.<sup>57</sup>

Syphilis, caused by the spirochete *Treponema pallidum*, was the predominant cause of ascending aortic aneurysms in the pre-antibiotic era and accounted for 5 to 10% of all cardiovascular deaths. Typically syphilitic aortitis involves the thoracic aorta with a particular predilection for the ascending aorta, likely due to its rich vascular and lymphatic supply. The pathologic process involves a multifocal lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate of the vasa vasorum leading to degeneration of the medial elastic fibers. The intima develops wrinkles, ridges, and plaques described as a "tree bark" appearance. Inflammation around the coronary artery ostia may lead to high-grade proximal occlusions. The inflammatory process may be either patchy or diffusely involve a large section of aorta. Once established, treatment of syphilis with antibiotics does not reverse the vascular lesions.

Other systemic arteritis conditions may also produce ascending aortic aneurysms. Takayasu's arteritis, associated with inflammation of the vasa vasorum, medial necrosis and may also have intimal changes similar to syphilis. It is typically seen in females between 15 to 30 years of age and frequently involves occlusive lesions to major branch vessels of the arch. 60 While syphilis aortitis often leads to rapid aneurysmal degeneration, this is much less common in Takayasu's aortitis, occurring only in 15% of cases.<sup>61</sup> Giant cell arteritis is a systemic arteritis that occurs in elderly patients, most commonly affecting the temporal artery. It is also more common in females and is also associated with polymyalgia rheumatica. Giant cell arteritis is an inflammatory process with inflammatory infiltration with lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes. There is variable presence of giant cells.<sup>62</sup> Aortitis leading to aortic aneurysm may also be associated rarely with Behçet's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, ankylosing spondylitis, lupus erythematosus, and Wegener's granulomatosis.

# **Bicuspid Aortopathy**

Bicuspid aortic valve is a complex familial syndrome with a male predominance of 3:1.<sup>63</sup> It is also associated with Turner syndrome. There is a 9% prevalence of bicuspid aortic valve disease in first-degree relatives of patients with bicuspid aortic valve disease.<sup>64</sup> More than half of the patients with aortic coarctation have an associated bicuspid aortic valve.<sup>65</sup> Several genetic defects have been implicated in the formation of bicuspid aortic valve disease however

no single genetic etiology has been derived. Aortic dilatation is frequently associated with bicuspid aortic valve disease; however, the mechanism for this occurring is not well delineated. Originally thought to be a sequela of poststenotic dilatation, aortic aneurysm formation in patients with bicuspid aortic valve may occur without any significant aortic stenosis although there is clearly flow perturbation in the proximal sinuses of Valsalva and descending aorta in patients with bicuspid aortic valve.66 Recent investigation has shown that embryologically, the aortic valve and ascending aorta arise from the neural crest cells implicating a potential common mechanism for the development of a bicuspid aortic valve and subsequent aneurysm formation.<sup>67</sup> The aortic wall in the patients with bicuspid aortic valve disease shows increased elastic fragmentation, fibrillin-1 deficiency, matrix disruption, increased levels of matrix metallic proteinases, and smooth muscle cell apoptosis.67-72

Fazel and colleagues using a cluster-type analysis identified four distinct patterns of aortic dilatation including aortic root alone (13%), ascending aorta alone (10%), ascending aorta and proximal transverse arch (28%), and aortic root, ascending aorta, and proximal transverse arch (45%) (Fig. 48-6).<sup>73</sup> This study suggests that for younger patients, definitive treatment of bicuspid aortic valve disease with aortic dilatation requires strategies that address the aortic root, ascending aorta, and proximal transverse hemi-arch. It is advisable to perform an aggressive hemiarch resecting all aortic tissue along the lesser curve to the level of the subclavian artery take-off in younger bicuspid aortic valve patients to eliminate as much of the diseased aorta as possible. However, total arch replacement with brachiocephalic branch reimplantation is rarely necessary as the aneurysmal component rarely involves the distal aspect of the transverse arch.

# Isolated Sinus of Valsalva Aneurysm

Aneurysms of the sinuses of Valsalva (SVA) that occur as isolated lesions are rare abnormalities caused by either a congenital defect in the continuity between the medial layer of the affected sinus and the aortic valve annulus or, less commonly, acquired causes such as endocarditis, syphilis, tuberculosis, focal dissection, iatrogenic causes.<sup>74</sup> They are more common in males and may be associated with subaortic stenosis, ventricular septal defects, and aortic insufficiency. In over 90% of cases, they involve the right coronary sinus (Fig. 48-7).<sup>75,76</sup> The noncoronary sinus of the second most common location and these aneurysms are extremely uncommon in a left coronary sinus. They are generally asymptomatic until they rupture when they usually cause intracardiac shunts. Right sinus of Valsalva aneurysms typically rupture into the right ventricle, effectively causing a hemodynamic defect similar to a ventricular septal defect. Aneurysms of the noncoronary sinus typically rupture into the right atrium and the left coronary sinus rupture into the pulmonary artery or left ventricle. Occasionally an unruptured left coronary sinus of Valsalva aneurysm may compress the left main coronary artery.<sup>76</sup>

#### **CLINICAL PRESENTATION**

## **Symptoms**

Most ascending aortic aneurysms are asymptomatic when diagnosed, being incidentally noted on chest x-ray or echocardiogram. Anterior chest pain is the most frequent symptom. The pain may be acute in onset signifying impending rupture or a chronic gnawing pain from compression of the overlying sternum. Occasionally signs of superior vena cava (SVC) or airway compression are present. Hoarseness resulting from stretch injury of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve suggests involvement of the distal aortic arch or proximal descending thoracic aorta. Less commonly, aneurysms of the ascending aorta or aortic root can rupture into the right atrium or the SVC, presenting with high-output cardiac failure or bleed into the lungs with ensuing hemoptysis. Acute dissection of the ascending aorta presents with severe tearing pain in over 75% of patients.<sup>77</sup>

#### **Physical Examination**

Physical examination is often unremarkable. If there is related aortic insufficiency, a widened pulse pressure or diastolic murmur may be present. If dilation is isolated to the ascending aorta, however, the aneurysm can reach large dimensions without producing physical findings. A thorough vascular examination should be carried out to look for any concomitant peripheral vascular disease, carotid disease, or abdominal aortic aneurysm. Abdominal aortic aneurysms may be present in 10 to 20% of patients with atherosclerotic involvement of an ascending aortic aneurysm.<sup>78</sup>

#### **DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES**

# Electrocardiogram

With significant aortic insufficiency, left ventricular hypertrophy or strain is evident. Patients with generalized atherosclerosis may show evidence of concomitant coronary artery disease or previous myocardial injury.

# **Chest Radiography**

Many asymptomatic ascending aortic aneurysms are first detected on chest x-ray. The enlarged ascending aorta produces a convex contour of the right superior mediastinum (Fig. 48-8A). In the lateral view, there is loss of the retrosternal air space (Fig. 48-8B). Aneurysms confined to the aortic root can be obscured by the cardiac silhouette and may not be evident on chest radiograph.<sup>79</sup>

# Echocardiography

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a portable diagnostic tool that accurately detects and differentiates between

operator dependent, TEE provides a reliable technique to measure the annular, sinus, sinotubular junction, and ascending dimensions. It is uniquely well suited to examine the most proximal aspects of the aortic root, which are often blurred by motion artifact on computed tomography (CT) scans. Transthoracic echocardiography is far less reliable but may be useful for assessing the severity of aortic regurgitation.

## **Computed Tomography**

Contrast-enhanced CT is the most widely used noninvasive technique for imaging the thoracic aorta. CT scanning provides rapid and precise evaluation of the ascending aorta in regards to size, extent, and location of the disease process (Fig. 48-10). CT scanning detects areas of calcification, and modern scanner accurately identifies dissections and mural thrombus.<sup>81</sup>

CT scan technology has evolved with multidetector scanners such that the entire thoracic aorta can be evaluated on one breath-hold and the distance between axial slices can be as small as 0.5 mm. Three-dimensional volume rendering is a highly useful tool for determining true in-plane aortic diameters and the proximal and distal extent of aortic disease relative to the arch vessels, which can aid the surgeon in operative planning

(Fig. 48-11). Ideally, the entire thoracic and abdominal aorta should be examined for evidence of concomitant aneurysm disease in the arterial tree. Gating to the electrocardiogram during image acquisition eliminates the motion artifact that may be seen in the most proximal aspects of the aortic root and can also allow for assessment of the coronary arteries. The main disadvantage of CT scans is the need for contrast solution for optimal resolution, which may be contraindicated in those patients with renal insufficiency or a history of a dye allergy. Noncontrast CT scans allow for assessment of aortic diameters but cannot identify dissection flaps or other acute pathologies.

#### Magnetic Resonance Imaging

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide axial and three-dimensional reconstruction of the ascending aorta with the avoidance of iodinated contrast agents and radiation exposure. Contrast-enhanced MR angiography with gadolinium allows more precise measurements of the aorta and its major branches with images comparable to conventional angiography (Fig. 48-12). MRI scanners are relatively unsuitable for those patients connected to mechanical ventilators or hemodynamic monitoring equipment. MRI is more expensive, less readily available, and requires significantly more acquisition time than CT scanning and is used less frequently.

#### **NATURAL HISTORY**

Elective aortic replacement is used as a means to prophylactically prevent aortic catastrophe such as dissection and rupture which carry high mortality. Recent data from the International

**FIGURE 48-11** 3D reconstruction of an aortic root aneurysm in a Marfan patient.

Registry of Acute Aortic Dissections (IRAD) show an operative mortality for emergent type A aortic dissection repair of 26%, although this is generally lower in more experienced centers. <sup>87</sup> Bickerstaff et al examined the natural history of 72 patients that were diagnosed with aortic aneurysms and

**FIGURE 48-12** MR angiogram (without contrast) depicting an acute type A dissection. The partially thrombosed false lumen is denoted by the arrow.

did not undergo surgery. 88 Over a 5-year follow-up period, 74% of patients experienced aortic rupture or dissection (Fig. 48-13). Of these 94% died. The overall 5-year survival was only 13% in untreated aneurysm patients compared with 75% in control patients without aortic aneurysms.

Traditionally, the most important criterion for ascending aortic replacement on an elective basis is maximal aortic diameter. In natural history studies by Coady et al, patients with 3.5 to 3.9 cm aortic aneurysms were very unlikely to rupture within 3 to 4 years, and each incremental 1 cm increase from this point increased rupture risk (Fig. 48-14).<sup>89</sup> Patients with aneurysms greater than 5 cm showed substantially higher dissection and rupture risk within the first year. Using a logistic regression model, they found that the aneurysm with maximal diameter of 6.0 to 6.9 cm had a 4.3 times greater increased risk of rupture or dissection then an aneurysm that is 4.0 to 4.9 cm in diameter. Growth rates for aortic aneurysms less than 4 cm are about 0.1 cm per year and this increases gradually as aortic

**FIGURE 48-14** The incidence of acute dissection or rupture of thoracic aneurysms according to size. The height of the column corresponds to the total number of patients and the blue area to the proportion of patients who suffered complications of dissection or rupture.

size increases up to 0.4 cm per year. 90,91 Uncontrolled hypertension, smoking, and presence of connective tissue disorders are associated with more rapid aortic growth. 90 Patients with MFS are at particularly high risk for rupture or dissection of smaller sizes and dissection is frequently seen with a maximal ascending aortic dimension of less than 5 to 6 cm (Fig. 48-15). 92 Strikingly the average age of death for untreated patients with MFS is 32 years, with complications of the aortic root being responsible for 60 to 80% of these deaths. 93 Marfan's patients with a family history of early dissection or rupture are at the highest risk for aortic catastrophe occurring at smaller dimensions. 94

Although size clearly correlates with rupture risk, it is important to note that many aortic dissections occur in ascending aortas that are less than 5.5 cm in diameter. In the IRAD registry, over 59% of 591 enrolled patients with acute type A aortic dissections had maximum aortic dimensions less than 5.5 cm and 40% were less than 5.0 cm (Fig. 48-16).

As the understanding of the biologic mechanisms behind aortic aneurysm formation improves, in the future, serum biologic markers and sensitive imaging techniques that can detect subtle changes in aortic strain characteristics or compliance may provide more accurate identification of the high-risk aorta.

# MEDICAL TREATMENT OF PROXIMAL AORTIC ANEURYSMS

Therapies designed to limit the growth of aortic aneurysms are targeted at mechanisms either to diminish stress on the aortic wall or to prevent deleterious degenerative biochemical changes. In general, patients with aortic aneurysms should avoid high intensity isometric exercise such as weight lifting as aortic pressures may increase rapidly and exert significant stress on the aortic wall. Weight lifting restriction should be less than 1/3 to 1/2 of the patient's body weight. Additionally exercises with rapid bursts of acceleration and deceleration such as basketball may place excess of stress of aortic wall.

Anti-impulse therapies are the mainstay treatment for thoracic aortic aneurysms. Due to their negative chronotropic and inotropic effects, beta blockers are typically used as a first line treatment. Fe The primary goals of beta blocker therapy are to decrease the overall blood pressure and to decrease the change in aortic pressure over time (dP/dT) to diminish the stress applied to the aorta in systole thereby limiting damage to the media layer. The rationale for using beta blockers was initially established with an ex vivo plastic model of

aortic dissection by Wheat et al in which a tear created in an artificial intimal layer of rubber cement in the plastic tubing propagated less when the pulse pressure was artificially flattened, while variation of mean blood pressure and flow rates had no effect. From Studies performed on turkeys, which are uniquely prone to aortic dissection, showed that the combination of sodium nitroprusside and propanolol were effective at preventing rupture, while lowering blood pressure with nitroprusside alone was ineffective and may have actually increased dP/dT due to reflex sympathetic stimulation causing increased chronotropy and inotropy. In a landmark study by Shores et al, young patients with MFS randomized to a regimen of beta blocker therapy had significantly less aortic dilatation over a 10-year follow-up period (Fig. 48-17)

and also had a lower incidence of a composite end point of death, congestive heart failure, aortic dissection, severe regurgitation, or aortic root surgery versus controls.<sup>99</sup> These results have been extrapolated to a wider variety of patients with ascending aortic aneurysms in whom beta blockade is used extensively.

#### INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY

#### **Non-Elective Indications**

Any new onset of acute dissection, rupture, or intramural hematoma generally warrants immediate surgery. The presence of symptoms of chest pain in patients with ascending aortic aneurysms greater than 4.5 to 5 cm is a sign of impending rupture and should also be managed operatively with expediency. Acute severe congestive heart failure secondary to root dilatation and loss of sinotubular junction either from rapid aneurysm expansion or from chronic dissection also warrants early operative management, although aggressive diuresis and cardiac optimization for 1 to 2 days prior to surgery are frequently helpful.

#### **Elective Indications**

Despite the limitations of size criteria, decisions to intervene are still largely decided based on maximal aortic diameter and growth rate. For degenerative aneurysms in the absence of connective tissue disorders or other cardiac pathology, elective repair is reasonable at an absolute maximal diameter of 5.5 cm. <sup>100</sup> Growth rate of greater than 1 cm per year is generally accepted as a strong indication to proceed with surgery for degenerative aneurysms regardless of diameter. <sup>101</sup> Some groups have also advocated the use of normalized aortic dimensions to body size to provide a more accurate reflection of the aneurysm dimension for an individual patient. <sup>102</sup>

The aortic ratio is calculated as measured diameter divided by predicted diameter for a given age and body surface area. Using this method, elective replacement is warranted at an aortic ratio of 1.5 in an asymptomatic patient without a connective tissue disorder or other complicating factors. <sup>103</sup> This leads to intervention at a size of only 4.8 to 5.0 cm in an adult less than 40 years of age with a body surface area of 2 m<sup>2</sup>. <sup>104</sup> Because the ascending aorta normally increases in size with age, the diameter for intervention would be higher in a patient more than 40 years old.

## **Special Considerations**

Patients with MFS are at higher risk for rupture and the ascending aorta should be replaced prophylactically at a diameter of 4.5 cm or an aortic ratio of 1.3 to 1.4. <sup>103,104</sup> Patients with Loeys-Dietz rupture at a smaller dilation than in MFS and should be electively repaired at 4.2 cm. <sup>105</sup> Among patients with bicuspid aortic valves, there remains ongoing debate. The 2013 Society of Thoracic Surgeons Clinical Practice guidelines suggest 5.0 cm (4.5 cm if there is a

family history of aortic dissection) whereas the ACC/AHA Valve guidelines recommend 5.5 cm (5.0 cm for a family history of aortic dissection or rapid aortic growth greater than 5 mm/year). <sup>106,107</sup> In the setting of connective tissue disorders, bicuspid aortic valve or chronic dissection, a growth rate of greater than 0.5 cm per year should warrant repair. A chronically dissected aorta, which the external aortic wall is supported only by the residual outer third of the medial and advential layers, should be replaced when aortic diameters reach 4.5 cm or a ratio of 1.3 to 1.4 due to the intrinsic weakness of the aortic wall. <sup>103,108</sup> Pseudoaneurysms, which are frequently from previous aortic suture lines, should be repaired upon diagnosis due to high rupture risk related to their extremely thin walls.

In younger patients, where aortic root reimplantation is preferred to avoid life-long anticoagulation, earlier repair may prevent the development of aortic valve cusp pathology and improve the chances of successful repair. Among patients undergoing aortic valve replacement who have ascending aortic aneurysms, Prenger et al reported a 27% incidence of aortic dissection if the aorta was greater than 5 cm versus 0.6% incidence if aortic size was normal. <sup>109</sup> In general, in the setting of other cardiac surgery, ascending aortas with a maximal dimension of 5.0 cm or a ratio of 1.5 should be replaced. <sup>103,109</sup>

#### PREOPERATIVE PREPARATION

Nearly one-third of patients undergoing surgery for thoracic aortic disease have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.<sup>110</sup> Patients with suspect pulmonary function should have spirometry and room air arterial blood gases. Smoking cessation, antibiotic treatment of chronic bronchitis, and chest physiotherapy may prove beneficial in elective situations. Normal renal function should be ensured with the appropriate blood work, and abnormal results should prompt further investigation. Because unaddressed severe carotid disease is a risk factor for stroke during ascending aortic operations, patients over the age of 65 should have duplex imaging of their carotids.<sup>111</sup> Younger patients with peripheral vascular disease, extensive coronary artery disease, carotid bruits, or history suspicious for cerebral ischemia should be investigated as well. CT or MRI of the thoracic and abdominal aorta is usually indicated. Coronary angiography should be performed in all patients to evaluate for significant coronary atherosclerosis and lesions with greater than 50 to 60% stenosis should be bypassed. Coronary angiography also helps define the coronary anatomy to identify anomalous or intramural coronary arteries which may complicate root replacement. 112

#### **OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT**

# Monitoring and Anesthesia

All procedures are performed using central venous access and a pulmonary artery catheter. Location of arterial line for blood pressure monitoring should be discussed with the anesthesia team preoperatively although generally right radial is preferred. Nasopharyngeal and bladder temperature monitors are used. Bilateral near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is employed to provide real-time estimation of cerebral saturation though out the bypass run. Precipitous drops in cerebral saturations are managed with increasing perfusion pressure and hematocrit to the cerebral circulation. In circulatory arrest cases, EEG monitoring is also employed to ensure EEG silence during interruption of cerebral circulation.

TEE plays a critical role in diagnosis, particularly of degree of aortic insufficiency and sinus segment and sinotubular junction anatomy that is not well assessed by CT angiography. It is also critical for hemodynamic management separating from CPB.

Anesthesia management includes fentanyl 25 to 50 µg/kg, midazolam 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg, isoflurane 0.5 to 1.5%, pancuronium 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg, and end-tidal concentration in  ${\rm CO}_2$ . Aminocaproic acid is dosed initially as an intravenous bolus of 5 g, followed by a maintenance intravenous infusion of 1 g/h and stopped within 2 hours of patient admission to the intensive care unit. Pharmacologic adjuncts in circulatory arrest cases include 1 g of methylprednisolone, 1 g of magnesium sulfate, 2.5 mg/kg of lidocaine, and 12.5 g of mannitol.  $^{114}$ 

#### **Myocardial Protection**

Typically, 1 L of cold blood hyperkalemic cardioplegia (4°C) is given antegrade into the aortic root. A left ventricular vent is employed to prevent distension. In cases of severe aortic insufficiency, the aorta is opened and the coronary ostia are cannulated directly with handheld cannula. A temperature probe is placed through the anterior myocardium into the septum and a myocardial temperature of 6 to 8°C is achieved. Retrograde cardioplegia is administered at least every 20 minutes and continuously when possible. It is important to give cardioplegia immediately prior to commencing circulatory arrest and at its conclusion.

# Circulation Management

Cannulation strategies vary significantly with individual pathology and the modern cardiovascular surgeon must be proficient in several different techniques. With experience, ascending aortas as large as 7 cm may be directly cannulated. This can be done with the traditional stab-technique or using a Seldinger technique over a wire in thin-walled aortas. In aneurysms which terminate prior to the innominate artery, the transverse arch is easily directly cannulated. In cases where antegrade cerebral perfusion is required, either the ascending aorta may be cannulated directly if using selective direct perfusion cannulas or the right axillary artery may be employed. Right axillary artery cannulation, which has grown in popularity in recent years, should be performed through an 8 or 10 mm Dacron graft anastomosed end-to side to the axillary artery as there is risk of dissection from direct cannulation of this friable artery. In some instances, femoral artery cannulation can be employed, but should be avoided in patients with atheroma in the thoracic aorta by CT scan or TEE. A standard two-stage venous cannula is used unless performing concomitant mitral or tricuspid surgery.

# DEEP HYPOTHERMIC CIRCULATORY ARREST AND CEREBRAL PROTECTION

The use of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) was first described in conjunction with cardiac operations in the 1960s. <sup>115</sup> In the 1970s, there was renewed interest in DHCA after its successful use during repair of complex congenital defects. <sup>116</sup> Later, Greipp and Stinson reported the first case series using DHCA during arch aneurysm repairs and supported its efficacy in cerebral protection. <sup>117</sup> As interest in DHCA continued to grow; investigators, using dog models, illustrated how profound cerebral hypothermia dramatically decreased cerebral metabolism. <sup>118-120</sup> As knowledge of DHCA physiology increased, it promoted the development of new techniques such as antegrade and retrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP) and allowed for more complex aortic aneurysm repairs.

There are two basic mechanisms that lead to ischemic cerebral injury during repair of proximal aortic aneurysms. While the stroke is one of the most common postoperative complications of aortic aneurysm repairs, its risk is not associated with duration of DHCA.<sup>121</sup> Rather, stroke risk is associated with plaque, clot, and the artheromatous burden in the aortic arch and brachiocephalic vessels. 122,123 The second type of brain injury is temporary neurological dysfunction (TND) and is characterized by confusion, agitation, obtundation, and even transient parkinsonism. Studies suggest that TND results from inadequate cerebral protection during DHCA. In 200 adults who underwent DHCA, 19% of patients had clinical symptoms of TND, which correlated significantly with age and the duration of DHCA (33 min in patients without TND and 47 min in those with TND). 122 Furthermore, in patients with advanced age, DHCA duration longer than 25 minutes was an independent risk factor for long-term neurocognitive impairment, specifically for worse performance on fine motor and memory testing. 124 It is posited that due to its high metabolic demand, the hippocampus is acutely sensitive to hypoperfusion, which may be the reason for memory impairment and cognitive dysfunction after DHCA.<sup>125</sup> Nonetheless, while TND does occur in some patients, clinical studies in adults after DHCA have demonstrated that a safe period of arrest is about 30 minutes at 15°C and 40 minutes at 10°C, after which cerebral anoxia occurs. 126

#### Cooling and Rewarming During Deep Hypothermic Circulatory Arrest

Data from Cheung et al have shown that only 60% of subjects undergoing DHCA achieve EEG silence at a core temperature of 18°C or a cooling time of 30 minutes. <sup>127</sup> In cases where EEG monitoring is not available, a safer technique is to cool for a minimum of 50 minutes, at which point 100%

of patients will have EEG silence.<sup>128</sup> Cooling is performed maintaining less than a 2 to 3°C gradient between arterial inflow temperature and venous return temperature to ensure even cooling. Nasopharyngeal temperature and bladder temperature which correlate with intracranial temperature and core body temperature, respectively, are also monitored during cooling to guide initiation of arrest.

During rewarming, the bladder, nasopharyngeal, and the systemic perfusion temperatures are monitored. The perfusion is kept at a gradient of not more than 10°C above the nasopharyngeal temperature. This ensures that oxygen demand will not exceed oxygen supply during the interval of cerebral vasoconstriction after DHCA. <sup>129-131</sup> Avoiding high perfusate temperatures is important and should not exceed 37°C. The bladder temperature which is raised from 32 to 34°C represents the core body temperature and will lag considerably behind the nasopharyngeal temperature. Monitoring bladder temperature helps to ensure uniform rewarming and minimize rebound hypothermia after CPB.

#### Cerebral Protection Techniques: Historical Perspective

In the 1980s, mounting evidence suggested that DHCA alone was neither efficacious nor safe for the long durations of cross-clamp time and arrest required for repairing extensive, complex proximal aortic aneurysms. This necessitated the need to develop novel techniques. While first reported in 1957 by Debakey during his early aortic arch aneurysm repairs, selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP) was used. The setup involved multiple pumps and bilateral cannulation of the subclavian and carotid arteries. However, this ACP technique had difficulty in uniformly perfusing separate vascular beds simultaneously,65 and resulted in high mortality rates and was quickly abandoned. It was later recognized that using ACP in combination with DHCA improved outcomes compared to DHCA alone. 132,133 In 1986, Kazui et al described his first approach with selective ACP.<sup>134</sup> His results from 1990 to 1999 showed that 220 patients underwent total arch replacement with ACP and DHCA with 12.7% in-hospital mortality and 3.3% permanent stroke rate, a significant improvement from only DHCA alone. Later in 2003, Di Eusanio demonstrated efficacy with ACP and DHCA in further reducing both risk of stroke and TND. In a multicenter trial, 580 patients underwent partial and total aortic arch replacement, the risk of permanent stroke and TND was 3.8 and 5.6%, respectively, with an overall mortality of 8.7%. 135 These results were only possible because of the introduction and refinement of the antegrade and retrograde cerebral protection techniques.

# Antegrade Cerebral Perfusion Techniques

Used routinely by many centers, antegrade cerebral perfusion is primarily beneficial over RCP in situations where the expected circulatory arrest time is greater than 35 to 45 minutes.

Common strategies include direct cannulation of the cerebral vessels with balloon-tip catheters as described by Kazui or by right axillary cannulation. When performing direct arch vessel cannulation it is advisable to use balloon tip catheters which have individual pressure-monitoring lines so the true perfusion pressures can be monitored to avoid cerebral hypertension. Right radial artery monitoring may also be helpful. Perfusion is typically performed at 10 cc/kg/min and mean pressures are maintained at 40 to 70 mm Hg. Perfusate temperature should approximate the core temperature. Optimal protection is gained by direct perfusion of all three arch branches, not just the left common carotid and innominate arteries.

Axillary cannulation is performed via cut down to the right axillary artery with a 8 to 10 mm Dacron graft sewn on in an end-side fashion (Fig. 48-18A,B). The graft is ligated

![](_page_14_Picture_4.jpeg)

at the end of the procedure. Given the fragility of the axillary artery, few surgeons cannulate it directly. As with direct cerebral vessel perfusion, perfusion pressure is maintained at 10 cc/kg/min and mean pressures are 40 to 70 mm Hg. The innominate artery is either snared or clamped at its origin. While antegrade cerebral perfusion via this method is rapid and effective, it only provides unilateral perfusion and contralateral ischemia may still occur. To maintain adequate cerebral perfusion pressure and eliminate the effect of arterial-arterial collaterals stealing flow, ideally the left common carotid and subclavian artery origins are controlled as well with additional selective cerebral catheters.<sup>137</sup>

## Retrograde Cerebral Perfusion Techniques

RCP is an alternate technique that provides retrograde perfusion to the brain via the venous circulation. While the nutritive flow of RCP is questionable, it provides cooling and excellent de-airing of the cerebral circulation. For RCP, a 24 Fr wire reinforced cannula is placed cephalad to the azygous vein in the SVC and secured with a caval tape. RCP with oxygenated blood is adjusted to maintain a right internal jugular venous pressure of 25 mm Hg, a flow rate of 200 to 300 cc/min, with the patient in an approximately 10-degree Trendelenberg position.<sup>127</sup> Minimal exsanguination into the pump is performed upon cessation of bypass to facilitate later deairing. RCP may be initiated via a Y-connection to the arterial line or from the cardioplegia system through a high pressure stopcock that can connect to the Y-connection between the SVC and right atrial cannulas. RCP may be interrupted for variable periods of time during deep hypothermia as required by various surgical maneuvers. The temperature of the retrograde perfusate is maintained at 12 to 18°C. After completion of aortic arch anastomoses, air is removed from the aorta and graft by allowing it to fill by RCP. After arch deairing, a cross-clamp is placed across the ascending aortic graft, and standard CPB with antegrade cerebral perfusion, that is, antegrade graft perfusion, is reinstituted for the final repair and rewarming. Our practice is to always reestablish antegrade flow via direct cannulation of the ascending graft using either a prefabricated 8 or 10 mm sidearm or by placing a purse-string suture in the graft and directly cannulating it.

#### An Algorithmic Approach to Decision-Making for Proximal Aortic Aneurysms

Choice of procedure when managing ascending or arch aortic aneurysms is predicated on a detailed understanding of individual patient anatomy and pathophysiology. The potential operative decisions include whether to replace the aortic valve, aortic sinuses, ascending aorta, or aortic arch. Any combination of these procedures is theoretically possible. A systematic approach to evaluate the aorta and aortic root begins with determining if there is a suspicion for connective tissue disorder. Patients with MFS, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, LDS, bicuspid valve-related aortopathy, or strong family history of

aortic dissection or rupture should generally be treated more aggressively by replacing the sinus segment, ascending aorta, and proximal arch as late reintervention is more likely in this group. <sup>138</sup> Proximal reconstruction in these patients may be accomplished by either root replacement or a valve-sparing root reimplantation procedure. <sup>139</sup>

The next step is to determine the pathology of the aortic valve. Moderate or worse aortic stenosis with or without insufficiency generally requires replacement while the management of pure aortic insufficiency is more complex. Aortic insufficiency caused solely by dilatation of the sinotubular junction, typically from an atherosclerotic aneurysm in an elderly patient, may be full addressed with tube graft replacement of the ascending aorta alone with anastomosis to the sinotubular junction (Fig. 48-19). Care must be taken in this instance to appropriately size the graft to within 10% of the annular dimension to allow full coaptation of the aortic valve leaflets. 140 The sinus segment must also be closely interrogated. If it is particularly thin or aneurysmal this should be replaced. Normal dimensions of the sinus of Valsalva are typically 30 to 32 mm when the aortic annulus measures 23 to 24 mm and the sinotubular junction measures 24 to 25 mm.<sup>141</sup> If there are aneurysmal sinuses and annular dilatation, that is, aortoannular ectasia, but the leaflets appear fairly normal, then a valve-sparing aortic valve reimplantation is often feasible (Fig. 48-20). Technical details of this procedure are discussed in a previous chapter. If the annulus

or sinusus are dilated and the leaflets are abnormal and not repairable, root replacement is performed. Prosthesis options include prefashioned composite mechanical root prostheses, sewing a stented tissue valve to a conduit, or using a porcine bioroot. Prosthesis selection is based on several competing factors including the elevated hazard for structural deterioration of biologic prostheses in younger patients, anticoagulant-related complications with mechanical prostheses, complexity and difficulty of performing future redo root replacements for bioprosthetic failure, and the growing trend toward the avoidance of warfarin in younger patients. The innovation of transcatheter valves, which have the potential to extend the life of a biologic root prosthesis without repeat sternotomy, has generated interest in using these prostheses in younger patients. 142 Pulmonary autografts may also be used as root replacements, but their practicality in aneurysm patients is somewhat limited as degenerative aneurysms tend to occur in older patients who would not benefit from the durability of the pulmonary autograft. Younger aneurysm patients, who could potentially benefit, frequently have bicuspid pathology or connective tissue disorders that may lead to early valve failure. Bicuspid patients have been shown to have significant histologic arterial wall derangements including the cystic medial necrosis, elastic fragmentation, and changes in the smooth muscle cell orientation in the autograft root.143

In patients where there is an isolated dilatation of the noncoronary sinus in degenerative aneurysms with preserved sinus dimensions in the coronary sinuses, the noncoronary sinus may be individually excised and a "tongue" of the ascending aortic graft is used to reconstruct this sinus with the rest of the graft anastomosed above the native annulus, that is, a Yacoub-type remodeling procedure isolated to the noncoronary sinus. <sup>144</sup> Such a procedure carries the risk of late dilatation or suture-line disruption as the remaining aortic tissue is often thin and weak. It is also possible to perform an isolated noncoronary sinus reimplantation as described by David and Feindel. <sup>145</sup> Unless operative risk is prohibitive, it is preferential to perform a full root replacement or reimplantation in such patients rather than treat only one sinus.

In cases where the aortic valve needs to be replaced due to leaflet pathology, the sinus segment is not aneurysmal and there is an ascending aneurysm, a modified Wheat procedure with replacement of the aortic valve and placement of a tube graft to the sinotubular junction is used (Fig. 48-21). This approach is especially useful in elderly patients who have mild-to-moderate sinus segment dilatation but a root replacement carries significant extra perioperative risk and the likelihood of future proximal reoperation is negligible.

Distal repair may be done as either a total arch, hemiarch, open distal, or clamped distal anastomosis. Aneurysmal extension into the proximal aortic arch is a common variant and is well treated with an aggressive hemi-arch. Resection of the ascending aorta to the innominate artery on the greater curve and to the level of the subclavian take-off on the lesser curve provides excellent protection from future aneurysmal

![](_page_16_Picture_5.jpeg)

**FIGURE 48-21** Separate ascending aortic replacement and aortic valve replacement with retention of the native sinus segment.

degeneration of the arch (Fig. 48-21). While clamped techniques for the distal anastomosis are suitable for isolated root pathologies such as complex endocarditis repair, in aneurysm cases it is preferable to excise the cross-clamped portion of aorta and perform an open distal anastomosis.

Total arch replacement with or without elephant trunk (ET) extension is typically reserved for patients with full arch aneurysms extending into the descending thoracic aorta or mega-aorta syndrome. The key decision point when determining the aggressiveness of the arch operation is to determine whether the open proximal operation will completely treat the pathology or if further intervention of the distal arch/descending aorta is required. If open intervention of the distal aorta is anticipated, creation of an ET anastomosis will prevent the need for circulatory arrest in the second stage. If thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is anticipated, creation of a 3 to 4 cm Dacron landing zone for TEVAR placement by forward mobilization of the cerebral vessels is a simpler approach than ET and avoids the difficulty of cannulating the free-floating ET for TEVAR. These approaches as well as debranching and hybrid approaches are described later in this chapter.

# ASCENDING AORTIC REPLACEMENT: SPECIFIC OPERATIVE TECHNIQUES

After the aortic cross-clamp is applied and cardioplegic arrest is achieved as described above, the ascending aorta is transected about 1 cm below the clamp and resected to the level of the sinotubular junction. The aorta is carefully freed from the pulmonary artery using low-energy electrocautery. Using a metric sizer, the diameter of the sinotubular junction that provides adequate leaflet coaptation is determined and this should be within 10% of the annular diameter. The aortic valve is inspected to ensure that it is trileaflet and free from significant calcification or leaflet pathology. If the aortic valve is to be replaced, this is performed at this point using standard techniques. An appropriate size graft is then anastomosed to the sinotubular junction using a running 4-0 polypropylene. The external aspect may be reinforced with Teflon felt if the aorta appears especially thin and a root replacement is not feasible. In cases of acute dissection individual pledgeted sutures are placed at upper aspects of the commissures to resuspend the aortic valve and Teflon felt is placed inside between the dissected layers to form a robust neomedia that can hold sutures.

# Composite Root Replacement

Aortic root replacement involves excision of the entire ascending aorta to the native valve annulus with mobilization of coronary buttons and placement of a composite valve and polyester graft conduit into the annulus. After cross-clamping and administration of cardioplegia, the ascending aorta is resected to the level of the sinotubular junction. The sinuses are mobilized off of the pulmonary arteries and

right ventricle and the coronary buttons are mobilized as described below. Unless a root reimplantation procedure is being performed, excessive proximal mobilization of the root is unnecessary.

The aortic valve leaflets are excised. The annular dimension is sized and an appropriately sized prosthesis is selected. Mechanical composite prostheses come prefabricated with either a polyester straight tube graft or artificial neo-sinuses created by changing the orientation of the polyester in the sinus segment. If a tissue valve is desired, a polyester graft that is either straight or has neo-sinuses is anastomosed with a running 3-0 or 4-0 polypropylene suture to an appropriately sized stented tissue valve. If using a Dacron graft with neo-sinuses, this should be sewn 3 to 4 mm below the start of the neo-sinus segment. The valve sutures must pass through both the valve sewing ring and the Dacron graft to ensure hemostasis.

The composite prosthesis may be placed with either pledgeted everting (ie, "intraannular") mattress sutures with pledgets on the outside of the annulus or in a "supraannular" configuration with pledgets on the ventricular side of the annulus. Typically, the everting technique is used as it is hemostatic and strong. Implanting the root with pledgets on the ventricular side requires less mobilization of the sinuses which may be advantageous in certain situations and may allow for a slightly larger prosthesis. When implanting a mechanical prosthesis, the everting technique is preferred as it is less prone to pannus formation which may interfere with valve function. Care must be taken with either technique to not shorten the mitral valve anterior leaflet with excessively large bites with the annular sutures along the left and noncoronary sinuses. Polyester, braided 2-0 sutures with a larger needle than used for aortic valve replacement are employed.

Once the valve-conduit is tied down, the coronary buttons are anastomosed using 5-0 prolene sutures as described below (Fig. 48-22). Pressurization of the new root by inserting a catheter into the proximal graft, running cardioplegia, and clamping the graft distally after de-airing the neoroot allows assessment of all suture lines.

Implantation of stentless bioroots, homograft roots, pulmonary autografts, and valve-sparing procedures is discussed in previous chapters.

# Management of Coronary Arteries

Mobilization of the coronary artery buttons in root operations remains the most technically demanding and least forgiving aspect of root operations. The left main button is mobilized after the aorta has been fully dissected from the pulmonary artery. It is frequently useful to work from the inside of the aorta outward, gently scoring the dissection plane with low intensity electrocautery. Generally, 1 to 2 cm of freedom of motion in all directions is required for adequate mobilization. Care must be taken mobilizing the right coronary artery to ensure the right ventricle is not inadvertently entered. Application of retrograde and direct

antegrade cardioplegia into the coronaries after mobilization will identify any small branch disruptions or major injuries while they are still repairable.

When anastomosing the left coronary button to the aortic graft, if a graft with premade sinuses of Valsalva is used, the button is typically sewn at or below the level of the equator of the sinus segment. The right coronary, which is more likely to kink as the right ventricle pushes it cephalad once the heart fills, is sewn at or above the level of the equator. When using a straight graft, some surgeons will determine the final position of the right coronary button after completing the graft-to-graft anastomosis, filling the heart, and briefly removing the cross-clamp. When separating from bypass, if there are new gross wall motion abnormalities, coronary artery injury or kinking should be immediately suspected. Our preference in these situations is to immediately bypass the affected territory rather than attempt to salvage a friable coronary button. For a right-sided problem, a bypass graft to the right coronary artery will typically resolve the problem expediently.

In complex endocarditis, dissection, severe calcification, or reoperative cases, coronary artery buttons may be too damaged or immobile to directly attach to the graft. In such situations, a Cabrol-type coronary anastomosis, where the coronary ostia are anastomosed to an 8 to 10 mm Dacron grafts in a "moustache" configuration may be employed (Fig. 48-23). Alternatively, segments of reversed saphenous vein can be used as interposition grafts. Typically these grafts are 3 to 5 cm in length, are anastomosed fairly high on the

(A) An 8- to 10-mm Dacron tube graft is anastomosed end-to-end to the aortic tissue surrounding the left and right coronary ostia. (B) An opening is made in the mid-portion of the coronary graft and in an appropriate position in the aortic graft and an anastomosis is formed. The modified Cabrol technique involves the formation of individual coronary buttons allowing the small-caliber Dacron graft to be sewn to the full thickness of the aortic tissue surrounding the coronary ostia.

aortic graft, and follow a gentle s-shaped curve to prevent kinking. In cases of right coronary button problems, proximal ligation and bypass to the main right coronary artery is another alternative.

#### **Distal Anastomosis**

Distal reconstruction is performed as a clamped or open anastomosis. In aneurysm cases, open distal techniques which eliminate all diseased aorta and the weakened cross-clamp site are routinely employed. Circulatory arrest techniques as previously described are employed. Distal anastomoses are performed with a beveled polyester graft using a running 4-0 polypropylene suture. The distal anastomosis is performed as an "on-lay" type anastomosis with the graft invaginated into the distal aorta. This pushes the graft material into the native aorta when the aorta is pressurized and prevents leaks. In cases of extremely friable aorta, Teflon felt placed along the outer aspect may also be beneficial but does not substitute for a proper "on-lay" technique.

# ENDOVASCULAR APPROACHES FOR THE ASCENDING AORTA

Advances in the design of highly flexible and low profile thoracic aortic stent grafts have generated an interest in using these devices for the ascending aorta in patients who are otherwise not reasonable risk surgical candidates. Key design requirements for ascending aortic stent grafts include a high

degree of flexibility and conformability, short graft lengths, no exposed bare metal, and long delivery systems as most TEVAR delivery systems will not reach the proximal ascending aorta from the femoral artery. Alternative approaches for access sites for the stent graft include axillary artery, carotid artery, and perhaps most promising, transapical. Graft lengths are more critical in the ascending aorta than in the thoracic aorta as the distance between sinotubular junction and/or coronary ostia and the take-off of the innominate artery is typically shorter than 10 cm, and is therefore shorter than most thoracic devices. The antegrade transapical technique may also offer potential advantage by limiting the distance between the sheath and the device thereby minimizing potential for device migration during deployment, as is seen in transapical deployment of transcatheter aortic valves. Stent graft placement has been described to treat focal ascending aneurysms in nonoperative candidates (Fig. 48-24).146,147

# AORTIC ARCH REPLACEMENT: SPECIFIC OPERATIVE TECHNIQUES

There has been a diversity of surgical approaches across institutions on how best to repair aortic arch aneurysms. Originally reported in 1960s, the first arch aneurysm repair was completed by using an "island technique" and anastomosing the supra-aortic vessels to the aortic graft. It was not until the twenty-first century that novel approaches were developed that limited cerebral ischemia and the duration of CPB

time. In 2000, Kazui et al developed an integrated branched arch graft that contained three fixed limbs for anastomosing the great vessels and a side arterial cannulation limb for CPB. <sup>134</sup> In 2002, Speilvogel et al described the technique of debranching the great vessels from the arch and anastomosing them to a trifurcated graft that could then be sewed to the main aortic graft. <sup>148</sup> These techniques improved patient outcomes by decreasing the duration of DHCA, improving cerebral protection, and excluding the diseased aorta from the anastomosis, as was necessary with the island technique. More recently, with the advancements in endovascular device technology, hybrid approaches are available that combine debranching procedures and stent grafts in a single-staged repair. These hybrid approaches have even further reduced CPB and DHCA time.

#### **OPEN TECHNIQUES**

# Branched Arch Grafts (Kazui Technique)

The branched aortic arch graft is prefabricated graft with 3 branches for the great vessels and an additional side branch for systemic perfusion.<sup>134</sup> This technique (Fig. 48-25A-H) begins with systemic cooling and initiation of DHCA. The aortic arch is opened and the brachiocephalic vessels are transected distal to their origins and selective ACP catheters are inserted into the innominate and left common carotid arteries, while the left subclavian artery is clamped (Fig. 48-25B). Then the distal anastomosis of the graft is first performed on the descending aorta (Fig. 48-25C). After this is completed, antegrade systemic circulation is started from the side branch of the graft (Fig. 48-25D). Next, the left subclavian artery is reimplanted to the graft and perfused (Fig. 48-25E). The proximal anastomosis is then finished (Fig. 48-25F), and attention is turned toward the anastomosis of the left carotid and left innominate arteries to the branched graft (Fig. 48-25G,H).

The aorta is de-aired, cross-clamp is released, and the side branch for CPB is ligated.

Since clot and atheroma in the aorta develop more often at the origin of the brachiocephalic vessels, manipulation of these arteries increases the risk of stroke after aortic arch repair. One benefit of this technique is that brachiocephalic vessels are transected distal to their origins before the resection of the aortic arch, preventing embolization and decreasing stroke risk. Depending on the extent of aneurysmal disease, this operation can be completed in one or two stages. For concomitant descending thoracic aneurysmal disease, an ET graft can be completed during the arch replacement as an easy setup for the second stage, which could include an endovascular option or smaller left thoracotomy approach. However, one limitation of this technique is that the cerebral branches of the graft are short and fixed to the graft. This decreases options to tailor the graft based on the patient's exact anatomy.

# **Debranching Graft Techniques**

Several types of debranching grafts are available on the market to repair aortic arch aneurysms. One of the first grafts used was a double-Y or trifurcated graft that could be anastomosed to the main aortic body graft during the operation (Fig. 48-26). However, other grafts currently available have the branched limbs pre-anastomosed to the aortic graft. While stylistically different, the generalized debranching concepts presented are similar.

In the debranching approach, the aorta is cross-clamped proximal to the innominate artery and CPB is initiated via the axillary artery. While the patient is being cooled to core hypothermia, the proximal aorta is opened and a multibranched limb graft or tube graft is anastomosed to the sinotubular junction. If aortic valve and/or root pathology is present, surgical repair can be completed while the patient is cooled.

Once hypothermia is reached, ACP is initiated via axillary artery cannulation. Attention is then turned toward the distal aortic arch and the main body of the graft is anastomosed to healthy, nonaneurysmal aorta. At this point, the distal clamp is removed and CPB is reinitiated either down the side limb of the graft or via direct cannulation of the aortic body graft. ACP is continued via axillary cannulation and selective perfusion catheters may be used for bilateral ACP until the left subclavian, left carotid, and innominate arteries are each

anastomosed to the three graft limbs, respectively. After debranching is completed, the proximal aortic reconstruction is de-aired and the patient is decannulated from CPB.

In case of a laterally displaced left subclavian artery from the aortic aneurysm, a left subclavian to carotid artery (LSCA) bypass can be completed 2 to 4 days before the debranching procedure. After a LSCA bypass, the debranching procedure only needs to be executed for the innominate artery and left carotid artery (Fig. 48-27).

#### Elephant trunk

The elephant trunk (ET) is part of a two staged approach to treat arch aneurysms with extensive pathology distal to the left subclavian artery. First used in the 1980s by Borst et al, the benefit of the ET is it provides a platform for an easier second stage operation to treat distal aortic aneruysms and

dissections with either an open or an endovascular repair. 149 Open repairs with an ET graft make for technically easier operations with smaller incisions and less cross-clamp time. Furthermore, it creates a proximal landing zone within the diseased distal aorta to place a stent graft.

Figure 48-28A-J illustrates the total arch replacement with a trifurcated graft and ET technique. Similar to as described

![](_page_22_Picture_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 48-26** Trifurcated graft used to debranch the innominate, left carotid, and left subclavian arteries.

above, right axillary cannulation is created to initiate CPB (Fig. 48-28B) and the aorta is cross-clamped proximal to the innominate artery (Fig. 48-28C). Once DHCA is reached the innominate, left carotid, and left subclavian arteries are anastomosed to the trifurcated graft and ACP is initiated from the right axillary artery, restoring perfusion to the brain and upper extremities (Fig. 48-28D,E). Attention is then turned toward the distal aorta. It is important to protect the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, so a suitable cuff of aortic tissue adjacent to the nerve is preserved. Studies demonstrate that the ET technique decreases the risk for laryngeal nerve injury during extensive aortic arch and descending aortic aneurysm repairs. 149,150 Next the proximal end of the ET graft is invaginated in itself and the midportion of the graft is anastomosed to the distal aorta with Teflon felt reinforcement (Fig. 48-28F). The origins of the left carotid and subclavian arteries are then oversewn. The proximal end of the anastomosis is then pulled out of the ET and can be anastomosed to the sinutubular junction, or as in Fig. 48-28G,H, the distal end of the graft from the aortic root repair. If a graft-to-graft anastomosis is required, it is necessary to bevel each graft end to maintain proper curvature (Fig. 48-28G). Next, the trifurcated graft limb remains clamped and is anastomosed to the proximal aspect of the aortic graft (Fig. 48-28E). Once the clamp is removed from the trifurcated limb, full myocardial

**FIGURE 48-27** In case of a laterally displaced left subclavian artery from the aortic aneurysm, a left subclavian artery to carotid artery (LSCA) bypass can be completed.

and systemic perfusion is restored (Fig. 48-28J). With the stage 1 repair complete, the patient can then undergo the stage 2 procedure at another time with either an endovascular graft or open repair through a left thoracotomy. Nonetheless, while ET sets up for a convenient, easier stage 2 procedure, it is not without complications and pitfalls. Complications include kinking of the graft, spinal cord ischemia, peripheral thromboembolism, and visceral malperfusion. 151-153

#### Arch First Technique

The "arch first" technique was described by Kouchoukos and Rokkas as an additional approach to treat aortic arch and proximal descending aortic aneurysm disease. <sup>154</sup> This single stage repair is performed via bilateral anterior thoracotomies providing excellent exposure of the aortic arch and descending aorta. One significant pitfall to this approach is it requires sacrificing both internal mammary arteries. Figure 48-29A-G illustrates the "arch first" technique. First, the heart and arch are exposed by bilateral thoracotomies in the fourth interspace with a transverse sternotomy. CPB is initiated via right

axillary artery cannulation. While the patient is cooled, the great vessels are exposed with great attention to preserve the recurrent and phrenic nerves. The most distal aspect of the descending aortic aneurysm is mobilized. Once the DHCA is initiated, the innominate, left carotid, and left subclavian arteries are transected and clamped. Then both the proximal and the distal aorta are transected (Fig. 48-29B). The distal aorta can be clamped and lower body perfusion can be established via a femoral artery. As described in the Kazui technique, a four-branched graft is used and the great vessels are anastomosed starting with the left subclavian artery and moving proximally (Fig. 48-29C,D). After these anastomoses are completed, the brachiocephalic arteries can be flushed off to remove emboli (Fig. 48-29E). The graft body is then clamped both proximally and distally to reestablish cerebral and upper body perfusion (Fig. 48-29F). Next, the systemic perfusion from the femoral artery is discontinued and the distal anastomosis is completed. Systemic circulation is then started via the sidearm graft. Finally, the proximal aortic anastomosis is finished to complete the repair and clamps are removed (Fig. 48-29G). Kouchoukos et al reported on 46 "arch first"

procedures with a hospital mortality of 6.5%. There were no reports of permanent neurological events but 13% of patients developed clinical signs of TND.<sup>154</sup>

#### **HYBRID TECHNIQUES**

Hybrid arch procedures that combine open cerebral debranching with concomitant antegrade endovascular stent placement have emerged over the previous decade as a novel treatment option for aortic arch aneurysms. The benefit of this technique significantly limits the duration of cross-clamp time and cerebral ischemia and is beneficial in older patients with a high comorbidity indices. The three key concepts to this approach are to (1) debranch the cerebral vessels (2)

reconstruct the ascending aorta to create a landing zone (Zone 0) for an endovascular stent graft, and (3) deploy an antegrade stent graft from Zone 0 to healthy distal aorta to exclude the arch aneurysm.

To grasp these concepts, an appreciation of landing zone classification is crucial. Thoracic aortic landing zones can be divided into five anatomic regions (Fig. 48-30).

- Zone 0: ascending aorta to the innominate artery
- Zone 1: between the innominate and the left carotid artery
- Zone 2: between the left carotid and left subclavian
- Zone 3: beyond the left subclavian and along the curved portion of the distal arch
- Zone 4: straight portion of the distal arch starting at the level of T4

![](_page_26_Picture_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 48-29** (A and B) Arch first technique to repair an aortic arch and proximal descending aortic aneurysm via bilateral thoracotomies.

Based on these zones, we have previously proposed a classification system for aortic arch pathology for hybrid repairs. <sup>156</sup> As seen in Fig. 48-31, a Type 1 hybrid arch has a suitable (nonaneurysmal) proximal aortic Zone 0 and distal Zone 2/3 landing zones for a stent graft. A Type 2 hybrid arch needs reconstruction of the Zone 0 landing zone but has a suitable landing zone in Zones 2 and 3. A Type 3 hybrid arch represents a mega-aorta

and needs reconstruction of the distal landing zone (Zone 0) with a proximal landing zone below the diaphragm.

In a Type 1 hybrid arch, a debranching procedure is performed to bypass the cerebral vessels and involves an end-to-side anastomosis of a four-branched graft to the ascending aorta. This can often be completed with a side-biting clamp and done off CPB. After the debranching is performed, an endovascular stent graft is deployed antegrade via a separate side branch of the multibranched graft with distal landing zone in the native ascending aorta at Zone 0 under fluoroscopic guidance.

![](_page_26_Picture_7.jpeg)

**FIGURE 48-30** Classification of thoracic endovascular landing zones.

![](_page_27_Picture_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 48-31** Classification of hybrid arch repairs based on location of aortic aneurysms. (A) Type 1 hybrid arch has a suitable aortic Zone 0 and distal Zone 2/3 landing zones for a stent graft. (B) A Type 2 hybrid arch needs reconstruction of the zone 0 landing zone but has a suitable landing zone in zones 2/3. (C) A Type 3 hybrid arch represents a mega-aorta and needs reconstruction of the landing zone (zone 0) with the other landing zone in the below the diaphragm.

A Type 2 hybrid arch does not have a proximal landing zone in Zone 0 due to ascending aortic pathology. Therefore, this repair involves replacement of the ascending aorta and debranching of the cerebral vessels so a stent graft can be deployed to exclude the arch aneurysm. A multibranched tube graft is used to replace the ascending aorta and the cerebral vessels are bypassed. DHCA may be necessary if a hemiarch anastomosis is required. After the graft is anastomosed, the stent graft is deployed antegrade via a separate side branch of the multibranched graft and landed distally in Zone 0 within the graft.

A Type 3 hybrid arch is a mega-aorta with diffuse proximal and distal aortic aneurysmal disease. This requires replacement of the ascending aorta and debranching as previously described for a Type 2 hybrid arch. The distal anastomosis of the graft is completed in the aneurysmal aorta but will be later excluded after the stent graft is deployed. Again, the stent graft is deployed antegrade via a side branch in the multibranched graft with the distal landing zone at Zone 0 in the graft and the proximal landing zone in the distal aorta.

Figure 48-32 shows a Type 1 hybrid arch repair for a Zone 2/3 descending aortic aneurysm. For this repair, there is a

suitable proximal and distal landing zone to exclude the aneurysm after the great vessels are debranched. To complete this repair, CPB is initiated and a side-bitting clamp is placed on the aorta. It is best to utilize CPB so the side-biting clamp is not directly placed on the pulsatile ascending aorta. The main trunk of the trifurcated graft is anastomosed to the aorta. Next, the left subclavian artery is clamped and transected. The proximal stump is oversewn and the artery is then anastomosed to a limb of the trifurcated graft at which point perfusion is restored. In a similar fashion, the left carotid and innominate arteries are anastomosed to the remaining limbs of the trifurcated graft (Fig. 48-32A). An endovascular stent graft can then be deployed antegrade through a side branch to exclude the aneurysm. If the left subclavian anatomy is difficult on preoperative imaging, one approach would be to first perform a left subclavian to left carotid artery bypass (Fig. 48-32B). It is also possible to perform an intraoperative extra-anatomic bypass to the left axillary artery by tunneling the graft through the first or second intercostal space (Fig. 48-32C).

While hybrid repairs are technically easier, require less cross-clamp and require less DHCA time, there are several

pitfalls. Complications consist of embolic stroke, type 1 endoleaks, and stent migration. In a systemic review of hybrid arch repairs of 1886 patients, there was a pooled perioperative mortality rate of 10.8%, stroke rate of 7%, and spinal cord ischemia of 7%. <sup>157</sup> Endoleaks are unique to hybrid operations in comparison to open techniques and have an incidence up to 15% in some reports.

# COMPLETE ENDOVASCULAR AORTIC ARCH REPAIRS

Complete endovascular repair of aortic arch aneurysms remains in its infancy. Several techniques have been employed comprising custom fenestrated grafts, chimney/snorkle techniques, and in situ double branched graft fenestrations. <sup>158,159</sup> While the literature abounds with case reports and small series, no large studies exist to demonstrate long-term efficacy.

Figure 48-33A-C demonstrates an endovascular approach to an arch aneurysm and reveals the single chimney technique. This repair involves a staged operation by first completing a left subclavian to carotid artery transposition and a left carotid to innominate artery transposition (Fig. 48-33B). While transpositions are not always feasible due to anatomical variability, a left subclavian to carotid artery bypass and a left carotid to innominate artery bypass could equally have been completed. After several days, a stent graft is deployed retrograde from a femoral artery and landed proximally in Zone 0/1 with the fenestration at the innominate artery. The right axillary or right carotid artery can then be accessed to deploy a retrograde stent into the innominate fenestration. The advantage of this approach is CPB and DHCA are unnecessary. However, while studies have demonstrated feasibility with total endovascular aortic arch repair, the rates of stroke, type 1 endoleaks, need for secondary interventions, and early conversions to open repairs are high. 158-160 Patient selection is critical and these approaches are for patients at too high of a risk for the open, gold standard repair.

#### **ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS**

#### **Concomitant Mitral Surgery**

Mitral valve disease is frequently encountered in patients with aortic aneurysms. This is particularly true for patients with MFS, in whom the incidence approaches 30%.<sup>161</sup> Patients who have evidence of moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation should undergo mitral valve repair at the time of aortic replacement. Gillinov et al reported results of mitral valve repair in patients with MFS, many of whom also had simultaneous replacement of the aortic root.<sup>162</sup> They observed an 88% actuarial rate of freedom from significant mitral regurgitation at 5 years. A fairly liberal approach to mitral valve intervention is warranted in aortic root replacement patients as reoperation for late mitral regurgitation may be particularly technically difficult. Additionally, care must be taken when taking the annular stitches along the aortomitral continuity to avoid shortening the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve.

#### Aortic Wrapping and Reduction Aortoplasty

Reduction ascending aortoplasty and aortic wrapping are less common techniques to address ascending aortic aneurysms typically reserved for patients undergoing concomitant aortic valve replacement but who are deemed too high risk for either composite root or ascending aortic replacement or who have ascending aortic dimensions less than the recommendations for replacement as a prophylactic measure to prevent aneurysm formation. Reduction aortoplasty involves excision of a segment of the ascending aorta to achieve a normal radial maximal dimension. It may be performed either with

![](_page_29_Figure_12.jpeg)

**FIGURE 48-33** An endovascular approach to exclude an arch aneurysm using the single chimney technique and fenestrated graft. (A) A type 1 hybrid arch.

a side-biting aortic clamp, cross-clamped or with open technique depending on the length of aortoplasty and technique used. 163-165 The excised segment may be taken in the long axis of the aorta down to the sinotubular junction (true reduction annuloplasty) or lesser plication techniques. External reinforcement can also be performed in conjunction with reduction aortoplasty. Concerns regarding this technique include dehiscence or aortic rupture at the suture line, which is constantly under tension from the radial force on the aortic wall during systole.

Aortic wrapping of girdling is performed either by itself or in conjunction with reduction aortoplasty. Wrapping has been performed with cellophane, polyester grafts and meshes, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and other materials. Neri et al described two patients required reoperation because of development of false aneurysms following aortic valve replacement with aortoplasty and wrapping. 166 The unwrapped parts of the ascending aorta in both patients appeared normal; conversely, the aortic wall underlying the wrap was severely atrophic, a phenomenon previously reported with abdominal aneurysms that were wrapped without aortoplasty. In a larger series by Cohen et al, among 102 patients who underwent aortic wrapping with a polyester mesh followed for a median of 4.7 years, there were no instances of major aortic complications and an average aneurysm growth of 2.6 mm over the follow-up period. 167

#### **REOPERATIVE CONSIDERATIONS**

Reoperative surgery on the ascending aorta and aortic root can be particularly challenging but is becoming more frequent in experienced centers. Increased use of tissue aortic valves in younger patients, biologic porcine or composite pericardial roots, and homografts in past few decades suggest that many patients may require reoperative root intervention. Additionally, root replacement may be required after the development of ascending aortic aneurysms in bicuspid patients who have previously undergone aortic valve replacement only. Indications for reoperation include aortic insufficiency, development of aneurysms or dissections in remaining segments of the thoracic aorta, false aneurysms, prosthetic valve dysfunction, infection or thrombosis, or degeneration of biologic prostheses.

Reentry is usually accomplished with a repeat sternotomy incision, although for complex arch operations involving the proximal descending aorta, a thoracosternotomy approach may be required. In cases of massive ascending aortic aneurysm, adhesion of the aorta to the posterior table of the sternum or contained ruptures and exposure of alternative cannulation site such as the right axillary artery or femoral artery are necessary. Massive aortic hemorrhage upon sternal entry should be locally controlled by forcibly reapproximating the sternum, heparinizing the patient, instituting peripheral CPB, and cooling to deep hypothermia such that the sternal reentry can be completed under lower flow conditions with active pump-suction in the operative field. If entering the aorta on reentry is felt to be inevitable, starting CPB and

cooling prior to sternotomy may be a superior strategy. In cases of moderate-to-severe aortic insufficiency, venting of the left ventricle prior to cardiac fibrillation is mandatory and can be accomplished by a small left anterior thoracotomy incision and direct venting of the apex.

Cross-clamping in the reoperative scenario may also be hazardous as previous graft material may cause severe adhesions to the pulmonary artery making the dissection of a clamping site difficult. Previous use of a porcine root prosthesis or left-sided bypass grafts makes this dissection particularly difficult. If the pulmonary artery is inadvertently entered, patching with a pericardial substitute is usually necessary.

Mobilization of the coronary arteries is frequently difficult and creation of a Cabrol-type anastomosis, interposition grafts, or bypass grafts are frequently necessary. Previous coronary bypass grafts should be reimplanted, and frequently, interposition vein grafts are required to accomplish this. Direct cardioplegia administration down bypass grafts is preferred but avoided when there is diffuse vein graft disease. <sup>169</sup> Retrograde cardioplegia is extremely helpful in this circumstance.

In cases of reoperation for failed porcine bioroots, root replacement is preferable to simple aortic valve implantation within the porcine root as there is a higher likelihood for valve dehiscence due to the degenerative nature of the root tissue.<sup>170</sup> If aortic valve implantation into a porcine root is being performed, all of the aortic valve implantation sutures must traverse the native aortic root tissue, not just the porcine tissue.

#### **OPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS**

## Bleeding

Woven Dacron grafts impregnated with collagen or gelatin are relatively impervious to blood and have reduced blood loss following replacement of the ascending aorta compared with knitted grafts. Precise suturing with careful attention to avoid torque on the suture needles while constructing anastomoses is critical to avoid the inevitable needle-hole bleeding at the end of the surgery. Tension must be avoided at the sites of coronary reimplantation, as this is a frequent site of bleeding. The modified Cabrol method or an interposition graft should be used when any tension is present. The inclusion technique of graft insertion is associated with an increased incidence of bleeding and pseudoaneurysm formation and has largely been abandoned. In very friable aortas, Teflon felt may be used to reinforce the suture line on the outside of the anastomosis in which a thin strip of felt is slipped into the suture line as it is tightened. Alternatively, it may be sewn to the inside, outside, or both sides of the native aorta with a running polypropylene stitch prior to sewing the graft.

In cases of refractory coagulopathy, the anastomosis can be wrapped tightly with a small segment of polyester graft or Teflon felt to reduce tension on the suture line and reduce needle-hole bleeding (Fig. 48-34). Blood transfusion can be avoided in a significant number of patients with the use of blood conservation

![](_page_31_Picture_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 48-34** Suture line bleeding may be effectively controlled with a circumferential wrap of the anastomosis with a strip of Teflon felt or Dacron. (Reproduced with permission from Edmunds LH: *Cardiac Surgery in the Adult.* New York: McGraw-Hill; 1997.)

techniques such as Cell Savers, autologous blood donation, plateletpheresis, the reinfusion of chest tube drainage, and the use of antifibrinolytics such as aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid. Since the removal of the antifibrinolytic agent aprotinin from the market due to concerns regarding renal dysfunction and mortality, bleeding has anecdotally become more common. Activated human recombinant factor VII may be helpful as a last resort when treating refractory bleeding that does not respond to any other therapies, although this may induce unanticipated thrombosis in arterial structures.<sup>171</sup>

In cases of ongoing postoperative hemorrhage, expedient return to the operating room for reexploration is preferable to massive transfusion or tamponade. Postoperative bleeding requiring reexploration ranges from 2.4 to 11.1%. <sup>172,173</sup>

#### Stroke

Neurologic injury following proximal aortic surgery remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Embolization of atherosclerotic debris or thrombus from the ascending aorta and arch produces focal neurologic deficits. Diffuse injury can be attributed to microemboli of air or cellular debris, insufficient or uneven cooling, and a prolonged circulatory arrest period. After circulatory arrest periods exceeding 40 minutes the incidence of stroke greatly increases. <sup>174</sup> Profound hypothermia may itself be injurious to the central nervous system without associated circulatory arrest. <sup>175</sup>

Stroke due to embolization is diminished when the aorta is evaluated via epiaortic ultrasound or other imaging modality to detect atherosclerotic plaques and thrombus. <sup>176</sup> This allows appropriate adjustments to be made in clamping and cannulation strategies. Resumption of antegrade circulation through the graft once the distal aortic anastomosis is complete, rather

than retrograde via the femoral vessels, after a period of circulatory arrest avoids embolization of distal aortic debris. Patients with severe carotid artery occlusive disease are at increased risk of stroke during ascending aortic procedures, and patients older than 65, those with peripheral vascular disease, or those with pertinent histories should be evaluated. 177

Patients with new postoperative strokes should be rapidly evaluated by the consultant neurology service and undergo early brain imaging. New embolic events should be managed aggressively with induced hypertension once intracranial hemorrhage has been ruled out.

## **Pulmonary Dysfunction**

CPB is known to cause alterations in pulmonary function as evidenced by changes in alveolar-arterial oxygen gradients, pulmonary vascular resistance, pulmonary compliance, and intrapulmonary shunting. Usually these changes are subclinical, but a full-blown adult respiratory distress-like syndrome is reported in 0.5 to 1.7% of patients following CPB. <sup>178-180</sup> The specific cause is the subject of much investigation and debate, but it is generally accepted that exposure of blood elements to the foreign surface of the cardiopulmonary circuit results in the activation of inflammatory cells and the complement cascade resulting in pulmonary injury. <sup>181</sup> The duration of CPB, urgency of the procedure, and general condition of the patient may roughly correlate with the occurrence and severity of pulmonary dysfunction, but it can be unpredictable.

Treatment is supportive, with early diagnosis and treatment of any subsequent pulmonary infections. Ten to eighteen percent of patients require prolonged mechanical ventilation. Preventive measures may include preoperative optimization of pulmonary function, minimization of pump time, judicious use of blood products, heparin-coated bypass circuits, and leukocyte depletion. <sup>182</sup>

# **Myocardial Dysfunction**

Transient myocardial dysfunction following complex aortic surgery requiring inotropic support is common with 18 to 25% of patients requiring more than 6 hours of inotropic support. 183,184 Meticulous attention should be paid to integrated myocardial protection with cold blood cardioplegia administered frequently in antegrade and retrograde fashions. This is particularly important in patients with significant left ventricular dilatation seen with aortic insufficiency or hypertrophy seen with aortic stenosis. Maintenance of high perfusion pressures after removal of cross-clamp optimizes myocardial perfusion during the critical reperfusion period. Optimization of right ventricular function with afterload reducing agents such as milrinone or inhaled prostaglandins while weaning from CPB is vital for maintaining adequate left ventricular filling in cases of severe diastolic dysfunction or ventricular hypertrophy. Postoperative myocardial infarction, reported in up to 2.5% of cases, may be related to technical problems with coronary reimplantation. 185

## Perioperative Mortality

Contemporary surgical series on ascending aortic disease using modern grafting techniques and methods of cerebral and myocardial protection report hospital mortality rates of 1.7 to 17.1%. Comparison of outcomes is difficult, however, because of heterogeneity of patients. Some series do not include dissection, and the proportion of emergent operations, reoperations, and arch replacements is highly variable. The common causes of early death are cardiac failure, stroke, bleeding, and pulmonary insufficiency. 185,186

Emergent operation after the onset of acute dissection or rupture is the highest risk factor for early death. Risk of death following elective intervention is increased by increasing New York Heart Association classification, increasing age, prolonged CPB time, dissection, previous cardiac surgery, and need for concomitant coronary revascularization. <sup>188,189</sup>

#### LATE COMPLICATIONS

## Late Mortality

Reported actuarial survival, like early mortality, is variable and dependent on the patient cohort. Survival rates are 81 to 95% at 1 year, 73 to 92% at 5 years, 60 to 73% at 8 to 10 years, and 48 to 67% at 12 to 14 years. 190-193 Predictors of late mortality include elevated New York Heart Association class, requirement for arch reconstruction, MFS, and extent of distal disease. 194-197 The most common cause of late death is cardiac, but distal aortic disease accounted for 32% of late deaths in one series. 198

# Reoperation

Reoperations occur due to pseudoaneurysm formation, valve thrombosis, endocarditis or graft infection, progression of disease in the native valve or remaining aortic segments, or degeneration of a bioprosthesis. Reported mortality for reoperative ascending aortic surgery varies between 4 and 22%. <sup>199,200</sup>

Freedom from reoperation is 86 to 90% at 9 to 10 years (Fig. 48-35). <sup>201,202</sup> Predictors of late reoperation have included MFS, the inclusion cylinder technique, and chronic dissection. <sup>203</sup> Surveillance of patients who have undergone previous aortic surgery to minimize the need for urgent reoperations and appropriate resection of all diseased aortic tissue at the time of original operation improves outcomes. Up to 60% of reoperations occur due to inadequate repair during the initial operation. <sup>204</sup> This is due to failure to resect the most distal aspects of aneurysmal disease by performing a clamped distal anastomosis or failure to adequately address root pathology with full root replacement. Previous inclusion-type anastomotic techniques were associated with higher rates of early reoperation due to pseudoaneurysm formation (Fig. 48-36). <sup>205</sup>

MFS patients are particularly prone to requiring reoperation (Fig. 48-37).<sup>206</sup> Gott et al reviewed the experience with root replacement at 10 surgical centers in 675 Marfan patients between 1968 and 1996.<sup>207</sup> The 30-day mortality was 3.3%,

but was only 1.5% for elective repair. Emergency surgery resulted in a 30-day mortality of nearly 12%. The survival rate was 93% at 1 year, 84% at 5 years, 75% at 10 years, and 59% at 20 years. Complications related to the residual thoracic aorta and arrhythmias were the leading causes of death. The most frequent late complication was thromboembolism. Advanced New York Heart Association class at the time of original operation was the only predictor of late death.

#### **Graft** infection

Graft infections are reported in up to 0.9 to 6% of patients following surgery of the thoracic aorta and are associated

with a very high (25-75%) mortality rate. 208-210 Most graft infections occur in the first month after operation and are frequently associated with wound infections. They may occur years later in cases of associated valve endocarditis or bacteremia from indwelling catheters or other systemic infections. The major infectious agents are *Staphylococcus aureus*, *S. epidermidis*, and Pseudomonas. 211 The ascending aortic graft may be particularly vulnerable because of proximity to the wound and poor natural tissue coverage. For this reason, full coverage of the ascending graft material with the pericardial fat pad is advisable in all cases. This serves to isolate the graft from the sternum should it become infected.

Patients frequently present with persistent fevers and elevated white cell count. CT or MRI may demonstrate air or fluid collections around the graft. There may be associated pseudoaneurysms, fistula, anastomotic leak, hemolysis, and embolism. Nuclear imaging techniques may be helpful but can be nonspecific for infection versus normal postoperative inflammation.<sup>212</sup> TEE may show valvular vegetations or abscesses.

Ideally, treatment of the stable patient begins with intravenous antibiotics to control septicemia and often clear blood cultures prior to reoperation. In extremely high-risk patients, where reoperative mortality is prohibitive, life-long suppressive antibiotics may be acceptable. Surgical treatment of infected ascending aortic grafts, as described by Hargrove and Edmunds, includes removal of all infected prosthetic material, aggressive tissue debridement, local irrigation, systemic antibiotic therapy, replacement of the infected conduit, and utilization of autologous tissue to surround the graft and obliterate dead space.<sup>213</sup> Aortic homograft may potentially be more resistant to repeat infection. Greater omentum may be also brought up through the diaphragm as a vascularized pedicle to wrap around the aortic graft and isolate it from

the sternum. Concomitant sternal infections should be managed with aggressive debridement, sterilization with vacuum-assisted wound drainage, and delayed flap reconstruction. In severe cases, open continuous antibiotic wound irrigation for several days can assist clearing the infection. Long-term antibiotics should be continued intravenously for at least 6 weeks and suppressive oral antibiotics may be indicated over the long-term thereafter.
