# Minimally Invasive and Robotic Mitral and Tricuspid Valve Surgery

W. Randolph Chitwood, Jr. • Barbara Robinson • L. Wiley Nifong

Minimally invasive mitral valve surgery (MIS) refers to a collection of techniques and operation-specific technologies, all of which are designed to lessen surgical trauma and improve clinical outcomes. In the last 20 years, enhanced visualization and instrumentation as well as modified perfusion and aortic occlusion methods have propelled the development of MIS operations. Cohn and Cosgrove (1996) first modified cardiopulmonary bypass techniques to enable safe, effective, minimally invasive aortic and mitral valve surgery. Concurrently, innovative port-access methods, using endo-aortic balloon occlusion, were proven to be effective. Thereafter, video-assisted and robotic methods were developed and applied effectively by several surgical groups.

Despite acceptance today, many surgeons initially were very critical of performing any complex valve operations through small incisions, owing to safety risks and the possibility of inferior results. <sup>6,7</sup> Since then many institutions worldwide have published excellent MIS comparative outcomes with traditional surgery. These showed definite clinical advantages, which included decreased blood loss and less transfusions as well as minimal postoperative care and pain. Collectively, these translated into shorter hospital stays, faster return to normal activities, less use of rehabilitation resources, and overall healthcare cost savings. Each of these advantages has been a driver for the continued development and expansion of MIS operations.

Today, replacing and repairing cardiac valves through small incisions is a standard practice. The combination of alternative sternal and thoracotomy approaches, new aortic clamping techniques, modified cardiopulmonary bypass circuits and cannulas, shafted-instruments, and three previous generations of robotic systems, all have set the stage for current minimally invasive and robotic mitral surgery, which has gained acceptance at many centers worldwide. Large institutional series as well as several meta-analyses have confirmed that MIS mitral valve surgery is safe and effective for most patients.<sup>8–14</sup> Although overall mitral repair rates in the United States have increased from 51% in 2000 to 62% in

2010, adoption of minimally invasive operations lags behind at less than 30% of repair cases. <sup>15–17</sup> In comparison, in 2015 nearly 50% of over 5000 mitral valve repairs in Germany were done minimally invasively. <sup>18</sup> At our center, mitral repair rates approach 100% for both MIS and robotic operations in selected patients with degenerative mitral disease.

With better understanding of the natural history of degenerative mitral valve disease, more *asymptomatic patients* now are being referred for repairs. Recent 2014 ACC/AHA (United States) and/or 2012 ESC/EACTS (European) Heart Valve Guidelines suggested that these patients should be referred only to high volume centers, having a heart team approach with a 95% chance of a repair and less than 1% operative mortality. These same "high bar" standards now have been set for minimally invasive repairs. To this end, surgeons who plan to embark on this trek should have significant experience in repairing valves through a sternotomy as well as have a significant patient volume, a unified heart team, and full support from the operating room and hospital administration. <sup>16</sup>

Hopefully, this chapter will serve both as an educational tool and helpful guide for those who plan to do, or currently are doing, minimally invasive mitral and tricuspid valve surgery. Today, most surgeons have reserved the hemisternotomy for aortic valve surgery. The majority of minimally invasive mitral and tricuspid repairs are done either through a right minithoracotomy or even less invasive port access methods. Thus, this chapter will relate only to direct-vision, video-assisted (endoscopic), and robot-assisted MIS mitral/tricuspid operations performed via right thorax access.

# **EVOLUTION OF MITRAL VALVE REPAIR SURGERY**

# The First Operations

T. Lauder Brunton first suggested that the mitral valve stenosis could be treated surgically.<sup>21</sup> In May of 1923, Elliott Cutler performed a mitral valvulotomy in an 11-year-old girl

using a tenotomy knife. Thereafter, she lived for 4.5 years. His next six patients died, and he abandoned the procedure. His next six patients died, and he abandoned the procedure. Henry Souttar performed a successful digital commissurotomy in May of 1925. His patient recovered uneventfully but he was never referred another patient for this operation. Despite these early repair attempts, mitral surgery remained dormant until 1948 to 1949 when Horace Smithy, Charles Bailey Dwight Harken, and Russell Brock independently revitalized the technique of commissurotomy. Here were early successes by Lillehei and McGoon to repair degenerative mitral valves. Other surgeons developed various annuloplasty techniques. Other surgeons developed various annuloplasty techniques. Some of these operations were quite successful but the development of a mitral valve replacement prosthesis eclipsed further development of repair techniques.

## **Traditional Repair Success**

The concept of repairing mitral valves was revived and developed by Carpentier and Duran.<sup>34,35</sup> Carpentier's landmark address entitled *The French Correction (1983)* made surgeons realize that most insufficient degenerative valves could be repaired and that the benefits exceeded those of a replacement.<sup>36</sup> His techniques were proven to yield excellent results when done through a median sternotomy. Many subsequent clinical series confirmed these benefits and repair became a standard of care in Europe and the United States, albeit slowly adopted.<sup>37–40</sup> The perfection of mitral repair operations done through a sternotomy laid the foundation for minimally invasive techniques to be the next wave of advancement.

## Minimally Invasive Mitral Valve Surgery

The idea of MIS mitral surgery emanated during the "Heartport Era" with the development of balloon aortic occlusion devices, long-shafted instruments, and port cardiac access.<sup>4,5</sup> These innovations facilitated MIS greatly and encouraged surgeons to expand the development of even less invasive operations. Cohn and Cosgrove among others showed modified less invasive sternal incisions safe and efficacious when replacing and repairing mitral valves.<sup>1–3</sup> Later, propensity matched patient series confirmed that repair results were similar to sternotomy-based operations.<sup>12</sup>

The concept of operating inside the heart using *video-assisted or endoscopic vision* is not new. In November of 1923, Duff Allen and Evarts Graham planned to use a cardioscope to visualize a commissurotomy in a 31-year-old woman but were unsuccessful.<sup>41</sup> Harken experimented with intracardiac visualization techniques in 1943.<sup>42</sup> In 1958, Sakakibara predicted that valve operations could be done using endoscopic secondary vision.<sup>43,44</sup> Kaneko (1995) used video assistance through a sternotomy to aid in mitral repairs and commissurotomies.<sup>45</sup>

In February of 1996, Carpentier performed the first videoscopic minimally invasive mitral repair, which was done via a right minithoracotomy.<sup>46</sup> Our group performed the first cameradirected minimally invasive mitral replacement 2 months later.  $^{47-49}$  Mohr, Reichenspurner, Vanermen, Hargrove, and Chitwood expanded the influence of video-directed minimally invasive mitral surgery by publishing large mitral repair series with excellent results.  $^{8-10,14}$ 

### **Robot-Assisted Mitral Valve Surgery**

In 1998, Carpentier accomplished the first robotic mitral repair using a daVinci robot prototype.<sup>50</sup> A week later, Mohr completed seven successful robot-assisted mitral repairs with this system.<sup>51</sup> These operations proved that mitral repairs could be done safely using robotic telepresence alone. In 2000, Grossi performed a mitral valve leaflet repair using the Zeus robot.<sup>52</sup> In 1999, our group purchased the first commercial daVinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) in the United States and then developed additional instruments and repair techniques in our robotic laboratory. In May of 2002, under an FDA safety and efficacy clinical trial, we performed the first complete robotic mitral repair with leaflet resection and a band annuloplasty using the daVinci system.<sup>53</sup> This device was FDA approved for intracardiac surgery in 2002 after two clinical trials.<sup>54</sup> Our inaugural series of 300 patients confirmed the safety and efficacy of robot-assisted mitral valve repair.<sup>55</sup>

Dedicated robotic mitral valve repair referral programs have shown outcomes similar to operations done either through a sternotomy, hemisternotomy, minithoracotomy, or port only access. <sup>56–60</sup> The device, instrument, and maintenance costs have been challenged; however, surgeons at the Mayo and Cleveland Clinics have shown that optimized robotic care paths can render economic parity with other incisional approaches. <sup>61,62</sup>

# ACCLIMATIZATION AND PROGRESSION

In previous book chapters, we have compared a surgeon's progression in minimally invasive valve surgery skills akin to a "Mount Everest trek." Although this analogy may be less apropos today, it does bespeak the advantages of an advancing pathway on which one can accommodate anywhere along this surgical escarpment. Embarking from a conventional median sternotomy-based operation or "base camp," surgeons can advance progressively toward less invasiveness through experience and methodological acclimatization. In this schema, entry levels of technical complexity are mastered before advancing past small-incision, direct-vision approaches (Level 1) toward more complex video-assisted/directed procedures (Level 2 or 3), and finally to completely robot-assisted operations (Level 4). With the evolution of technology and advancing surgical expertise, most established mitral repair surgeons are able to attain "comfort zones" along this trek.

This chapter shows that patient selection, preoperative screening, patient positioning, the operative setup, perfusion, and operative management are generally the *same for all of our MIS and robot-assisted operations*. This standardization

should help surgeons move more rapidly through the progression of MIS operations. Major differences between direct vision and video-assisted MIS operations relate mainly to the size of the minithoracotomy. In robot-assisted operations, changes relate to instrument arm placement, instruments, and telemanipulation methods. Mitral and tricuspid valve repair techniques have been standardized for all three operative approaches.

### PATIENT SELECTION

Table 40-1 shows what we consider to be an ideal mitral valve operation. Today, we have been able to achieve most of these factors: however, others remain for the future. Clearly, the die has been cast (alea iacta est) regarding the absolute requirement for patient safety and optimal long-lasting repairs, no matter what technique is employed. Patients who are selected for minimally invasive mitral surgery should have the same indications as outlined in either the 2014 ACC/AHA (United States) or 2012 ESC/EACTS (European) Guidelines. 19,20 At our institution, all patients with either degenerative or functional mitral insufficiency are considered for a videoscopic or robotic MIS. Asymptomatic patients are selected based on the IIa recommendations in the recent ACC/AHA guidelines.<sup>19</sup> Patients with significant comorbidities, and those requiring multivessel coronary revascularization, an aortic valve replacement or have a significantly dilated ascending aorta should be operated upon through a sternotomy. Operative risks, age, fragility, and mitral pathology complexity all should be considered when selecting these patients. All patients should be informed of alternative approaches, including a traditional sternotomy, and they should understand that there is a small possibility of requiring a sternal conversion.

Some relative contraindications can be managed by selecting alternate methods for perfusion and myocardial protection (eg, axillary artery cannulation and hypothermic ventricular fibrillation). For single vessel coronary disease, preoperative coronary stenting has obviated the need to avoid consideration for a mitral/tricuspid MIS repair.

### PREOPERATIVE SCREENING

Candidates for any MIS or robot-assisted mitral operation should be screened carefully for peripheral vascular and coronary artery disease as well as pulmonary maladies. In most patients, either a computed tomographic angiogram and/or contrast coronary angiogram should be performed. Suspect patients should undergo tomographic and/or ultrasound screening for aortoiliac, carotid, and general aortic disease. Peripheral perfusion and aortic endoballoon occlusion should be avoided in patients with severe aortic atherosclerosis or a dilated ascending aorta. Pulmonary function tests should be done in heavy smokers and those having symptoms of obstructive disease. A detailed transthoracic echocardiogram should be done to define general valve pathology, ventricular function, and the presence of pulmonary hypertension. If the latter is present, a right heart catheterization may be

indicated. In patients with complex disease, we perform a preoperative 3D transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE).

### **REPAIR PLANNING: 3D TEE STUDIES**

We always develop an intraoperative "blueprint" to plan mitral and tricuspid repairs Table 40-3. After patients are anesthetized, the direction of each jet (leak) is mapped with both 2D and 3D TEE studies. The mobility and prolapse level is determined for each restricted or prolapsing segment. Leaflet segments (P<sub>1</sub>-P<sub>3</sub>, A<sub>1</sub>-A<sub>3</sub>) are measured. Next, the planar angle between the aortic and mitral valve annulus is determined. Finally, the annular diameter, outflow tract septal thickness, and coaptation point to septal (C Sept) distances are measured. Operative planning includes the avoidance of systolic anterior motion of the anterior leaflet (SAM). Thus, we pay special attention to the length of A, and P<sub>1</sub>-P<sub>3</sub> heights (annulus to coapting edge). Table 40-4 shows the anatomic, operative, and dynamic features that can contribute to postoperative SAM. Preventative structural repair measures that may avoid this complication include: (1) implantation of a large enough ring/band, (2) reduction of the posterior leaflet height to 15 mm or less, and (3) achievement of an optimal leaflet coaptation surface (8-10 mm). The length of A, guides us for annuloplasty band size selection. Finally, a 3D valve model is constructed from these measurements (Fig. 40-1A–C). During the valve reconstruction, this model as well as other imaging studies can be visualized in the daVinci operating console using the Tile Pro software (Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). To determine the need for an adjunctive tricuspid valve repair, we quantitate the regurgitant volume and measure the annular size. We now include a tricuspid annuloplasty repair in all patients that have even moderate insufficiency with annular dilatation of more than

### OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT: **GENERAL**

### **Patient Position**

To help widen the right intercostal spaces (ICSs), which helps to prevent rib spreading, the right chest should be elevated by 30° using a midthorax towel roll. The right arm should be "sling" positioned inferior to the posterior axillary line. Some surgeons prefer to position the flexed right arm above the head using different forms of stabilization. At this time, anterior and posterior Zoll defibrillator pads should be placed to subtend the heart. To monitor adequate limb perfusion during CPB, we place Invos System (Somanetics, Inc., Troy, MI) oxygen saturation monitoring patches on each thigh. Standard skin preparation and draping must provide wide access to the right chest, sternum, and both groins. To facilitate transthoracic aortic clamp placement, the right chest should be prepared sterilely as far as the posterior axillary line.

# Anesthesia Management

Although some surgeons prefer not to isolate the right lung, we believe that unilateral ventilation can be done safely and facilitates inspection for bleeding at the end of the operation. In the past, we deflated the lung first and then opened the pericardium with long instruments before establishing CPB. However, we now begin CPB before deflating the right lung and avoid manipulating it while heparinized. To isolate the right lung, either a double-lumen endotracheal tube or a right endobronchial blocker is used. In all of our minimally invasive cardiac surgery operations, we monitor closely cardiac dynamics and function as well as leg and brain perfusion.

Forehead patches are applied to monitor *bispectral index* (BIS, Covidien, Inc., Boulder, CO), which provides an index of cerebral perfusion and anesthetic levels.

A left radial artery catheter is placed for systemic blood pressure monitoring. If intra-aortic balloon occlusion (clamping) is planned, arterial pressures should be measured continuously in both arms. This is done to ensure that the endoballoon has not inadvertently occluded the innominate artery. Thereafter, a right internal jugular vein catheter is inserted for drug infusions and placement of a flow directed Swan–Ganz pulmonary artery catheter (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA). Using the "double stick" technique, a thin-walled (15-Fr or 17-Fr) Bio-Medicus (Medtronic, Inc., St. Paul, MN) right internal jugular venous drainage cannula is inserted under echocardiographic guidance (Fig. 40-2). Some surgeons use a single femoral venous return cannula that is passed through the right atrium into

the superior vena cava (SVC). However, to assure a dry surgical field throughout these operations, we have found that dual cannulation is more reliable. Lastly, the 3D transesophageal echo probe is positioned and detailed studies are done.

### Working Incision

Today, most minimally invasive and robotic mitral/tricuspid valve operations are performed through a right fourth ICS minithoracotomy. Current visualization choices include a direct view through the incision, 2D endoscopic, or 3D robotic. However, the new Aesculap 3D EinsteinVision system (E Braun, Inc., Tuttlingen, Germany) has been compared favorably to daVinci robotic 3D visualization. <sup>65</sup> The *size of the working incision* usually depends on the visualization and operative methods chosen by the surgeon.

For both direct vision and 2D endoscopic MIS, a 4 to 5 cm minithoracotomy is made in the fourth ICS near the anterior axillary line. We suggest a slightly larger incision for surgeons just beginning MIS mitral surgery. For robotic operations, a smaller working incision (2 to 3 cm) is placed in the same topographic chest region. In preference to using a rib-spreading retractor, we now prefer a flexible Alexis soft tissue wound protector (Applied Medical, Inc., Rancho Santa Margarita, CA). In the past, we used the Perivue Soft Tissue retractor (Edwards Lifesciences, Inc., Irvine, CA) for nonrib spreading access. We have found that this minimizes postoperative pain and provides good working-incision exposure for either direct vision, video-assisted, or robotic minimally invasive mitral/ tricuspid valve surgery. Other robotic surgeons have found that true port-access (1 to 2 cm) can be used without compromising either the operation or safety.<sup>57–60</sup>

# Cannulation and Cardiopulmonary Perfusion

All perfusion cannulas are placed under echocardiographic guidance using the Seldinger guide-wire technique. Through a 2-cm oblique groin incision adventitial 4-0 polypropylene

**FIGURE 40-3** Cardiopulmonary bypass perfusion cannulas. Groin incision with arterial (A) and venous (V) cannulas in place for cardiopulmonary perfusion (see text for details).

oval (longitudinal) purse-string sutures are placed in both femoral vessels near the inguinal ligament. The right femoral artery is cannulated with either a 17 or 19-Fr Bio-Medicus cannula (Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). For inferior vena caval drainage, either a 22-Fr (single stage) or a 23/25-Fr (dual stage) RAP femoral venous cannula (LivaNova, Inc., Arvada, CO) is passed into the right atrium (Fig. 40-3). In corpulent patients, we tunnel cannulas through the upper thigh subcutaneous tissue. This allows coaxial dilators and cannulas to have safer passage into vessels at a 30° to 45° angle. Vacuum-assisted venous drainage is used in all of our operations. Presently, we use Sorin S5® heart-lung machine, modified for use with a venous bag reservoir or V-Bag (Circulatory Technology, Inc., Oyster Bay, NY) and equipped with magnetic drive for Revolution centrifugal pump suction (LivaNova USA, Inc., Arvada, CO) (Fig. 40-4). Figure 40-5 Illustrates our current perfusion circuit for MIS and robotic heart surgery.

### Cardiac Air Removal

Meticulous cardiac air removal is particularly important in minimally invasive valve operations. Difficulty exists in manipulating and deairing the cardiac apex, as it cannot be elevated. Also, with a right anterolateral minithoracotomy, air tends to be retained along the dorsally oriented ventricular septum and in the right pulmonary veins. Moreover, this position places the right coronary ostium in the most vulnerable position to entrap air. Continuous carbon-dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) insufflation has been particularly helpful in minimizing intracardiac air and should be begun before cardiac chambers are opened. Carbon dioxide is much more soluble in blood than air and displaces it very effectively. We infuse CO<sub>2</sub> continuously (4-5 L/min) into the thorax, and prior to cross clamp release, ventilate both lungs vigorously to draw the gas deep

into all pulmonary veins. After atriotomy closure and following cross-clamp release, suction is applied to the aortic root vent. One can compress the right coronary artery origin during early ejection. Constant transesophageal echocardiographic monitoring is essential to assure adequate air removal before weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass.

# Alternate Arterial Cannulation Techniques

Ileo-femoral and/or aortic atherosclerosis may preclude safe retrograde perfusion. To cannulate the ascending aorta directly, it is important to place two concentric pledgeted purse strings near the innominate artery origin. We use either a Biomedicus (Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) guide-wire directed cannula or a 23-Fr Straight Shot device (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA), which is passed through the chest wall via a 10-mm trocar. If it is not feasible to cannulate the ascending aorta directly, we use the right axillary artery for

![](_page_6_Figure_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 40-5** Cardiopulmonary bypass perfusion circuit for minimally invasive mitral surgery. Our circuit employs the venous bag reservoir pictured in Fig. 40-4. Femoral arterial and venous cannulas are inserted through a small groin incision. An internal jugular venous cannula augments return to the V-Bag reservoir. Cold Custodiol antegrade cardioplegia is delivered via an ascending aorta cannula.

antegrade perfusion. The artery is exposed through an infraclavicular incision. An 8-mm GelSoft knitted graft (Vascutek, Terumo, Ann Arbor, MI) is sewn end-to-side to the axillary artery with 5-0 polypropylene suture. Thereafter, the graft is connected to the bypass circuit using either an appropriate size arterial cannula or a three-eighth inch pump tubing connector. Terumo also makes a PTFE graft that is annealed directly to a perfusion cannula (Fig. 40-6A and B). Alternatively, the axillary artery can be cannulated directly; however, distal arm perfusion should be monitored while the cannula is in place.

### **Aortic Occlusion**

For aortic occlusion, we use a transthoracic cross clamp Scanlan International, Inc., St. Paul, MN as it has been proven to

be safe, reliable, economic, and simple to apply (Fig. 40-7A and B). However, a number of surgeons use the IntraClude endoballoon (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) for aortic occlusion (Fig. 40-8). This technique has a steeper learning curve than using the clamp. The balloon position must be precise and remain stable in the ascending aorta. There is a potential for either innominate artery occlusion or intraventricular displacement. Therefore, it is essential echo monitor the balloon position throughout the operation. Also, introduction through the specialized femoral arterial cannula can limit limb perfusion. In this circumstance, the endoballoon catheter should be reinserted through the other femoral artery. Despite these concerns, this method can provide effective aortic occlusion with a simultaneous route for delivering antegrade cardioplegia and venting air.

(B) Terumo PTFE graft that is annealed to the arterial perfusion circuit.

When applying the transthoracic aortic clamp, the posterior arm should be passed through the transverse sinus under either *direct or videoscopic vision* (Fig. 40-9A and B). The shaft of the clamp should be passed just in front of the SVC near the pericardial junction. The anterior clamp arm (tine) portion should be positioned across the aorta until it reaches the main pulmonary artery. Care must be taken not to injure the right or main pulmonary artery, left atrial appendage, left

main coronary artery, or aorta. We prefer to place the clamp with the tip directed toward the transverse aortic arch.

## **Myocardial Protection**

As mentioned earlier, we have always used the transthoracic aortic clamp method for both minimally invasive and robot-assisted mitral valve surgery. For antegrade cardioplegia administration, a long cardioplegia-vent catheter (Medtronic, Inc., St Paul, MN) is inserted through an ascending aortic purse-string, secured, and passed either through a chest wall trocar or the working incision. We prefer a pledgeted diamond shape 4-0 PTFE purse-string suture placed distal to the right coronary artery origin near the fatty Fold of Rindfleisch (Fig. 40-10). This catheter should be inserted either under robotic, endoscopic, or direct vision.

We now use Custodiol—Bretschneider's HTK solution (Franz Köhler Chemie Bensheim GMBH, Germany) for cardioplegia as it provides much longer myocardial protection without requiring frequent reinfusions. We start with single large infusion (20 to 25 mL/kg) at 4 to 6°C, and after 1 hour give a half dose. For maximal myocardial protection, we combine antegrade cardioplegia with a systemic blood inflow temperature of 28°C. If blood cardioplegia is used, repeat administrations should be given at 15- to 30-minute intervals. Multiple cardioplegia infusions, requiring atrial retractor relaxation and repositioning, can entrain air into the aortic root. For patients having had a previous sternotomy, we cool systemically to 26°C and induce ventricular fibrillation by rapid pacing with a custom Swan-Ganz catheter. In patients with mild aortic insufficiency, additional intracardiac suction can be combined with dropping perfusion flow briefly for difficult suture placement.

## Cardiac Exposure

After going on CPB, the pericardium is opened longitudinally 3-cm anterior to the phrenic nerve with either long shafted endoscopic or robotic instruments. Two to three well-spaced pericardial retraction sutures are placed along the inferior (dorsal) pericardial edge (Fig. 40-11A and B). We then pass the needle back through a pretied end-loop. Using a crochet hook instrument, the single suture is withdrawn laterally through the chest wall to provide cardiac exposure. Care should be taken not to stretch or directly injure the phrenic nerve.

The anterior (ventral) pericardial edge is distracted through the working incision with two sutures.

**FIGURE 40-11** Suture loops: pericardal retraction/atriotomy closure. (A) Tiny PTFE loops are hand tied. These 3-0 PTFE loops are used to close the left atrium. After the suture is passed through the atriotomy tissue, the needle is passed through the loop, and the suture is tightened. This obviates the need for extracorporeal knot tying. (B) For pericardial retraction sutures, 2-0 braided suture loops are tied as in A. After the loop-suture pericardial edge fixation, the suture is passed through the lateral chest wall using a "crochet hook" instrument.

(Karl Storz GmbH & Co. KG, Tuttlingen, Germany) through a third ICS trocar and attach it to a hand-positioned holder. A transthoracic atrial retractor arm (Atrial Lift System, Atricure, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) is passed through the chest wall, just medial to the sternum in the fourth interspace (Fig. 40-13). The arm is then coupled to the appropriate size blade, which is inserted into the left atrium. After minimal interatrial groove dissection, the left atriotomy should be made just medial to the right superior and inferior pulmonary veins. To lift interatrial septum and expose the mitral valve, the retractor arm is attached to a table-mounted support. This device is also used to facilitate tricuspid valve repairs.

Long-shafted instruments are used for endoscopic and direct vision MIS and provide rotational ergonomics but lack the advantage of full articulation (Fig. 40-14). Specialized knot pushers and suture cutters (Scanlan International, Inc., St. Paul, MN) greatly facilitate MIS mitral operations (Fig. 40-15). It is incumbent that needle holders have a strong grip as many positioning angles confer increased torque compared with traditional suturing methods. For suture organization, we often use Gabby-Frater suture guides (Teleflex Medical, Research Triangle, NC), placed around the working incision.

for surgeons and programs to establish and maintain a successful robot-assisted adult cardiac surgery program. <sup>766</sup> It emphasizes that an organized heart team is mandatory to develop and maintain a successful cardiac robotic surgical program. Also, our editorial entitled "Mitral valve repair using robotic technology: Safe, effective, and durable" provides additional helpful information and guidance for developing programs.<sup>67</sup>

Before beginning robot-assisted mitral and tricuspid surgery, surgeons should be accomplished at mitral repairs and preferably other minimally invasive approaches. <sup>16</sup> Cardiologists should fully support program development and champion participation in combined valve clinics. This cooperation encourages cardiologist and surgeons to agree upon

which patients are appropriate for a robot-assisted operation. It is important that anesthesiologists, surgeons, tableside assistants, scrub personnel, circulating nurses, and perfusionists train and work together as a unit.

Procedure training at an experience robotic valve center has been important to launch successful programs and greatly shortens the learning curve. We suggest that even skilled mitral valve referral surgeons should engage a proctor for the first operations. There are a number of experienced centers that can offer training in robotic mitral valve surgery. Our Robotic Training Center has been a mainstay for mitral valve robotic surgical training. To date, we have held 634 robotic surgery courses in all specialties. Of these, 160 were training general cardiac surgery teams with an additional 104 that were specific for robotic mitral valve repair.

## The daVinci Surgical System

The daVinci surgical system (Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) provides operative field access with superb visualization and enhanced ergonomics, which allows surgeons to perform complex operations through small port-like incisions. Long hand-held instruments placed through a small working port have a fulcrum effect that can reverse instrument direction from that of the surgeon's hand. This factor, coupled with innate human tremor, may limit accurate suture placement and valve leaflet reconstruction. Accuracy achieved with daVinci instruments emanates from the wide freedom of instrument tip motion at the operative plane. The surgeon always has the same operating console instrument control as if they were activated directly by his or her hands.

Currently, this device is the only robotic system FDA approved to perform intracardiac surgical procedures. We have used three system generations, including the daVinci SI HD (high-definition) dual console device, which was first commercialized in 2009 (Fig. 40-16). The current daVinci XI System

(2014) (Fig. 40-17) has a laser targeting system that facilitates docking and instrument engagement. Moreover, 3D visualization has been improved, and the device has robotic tissue stapler capabilities.

All da Vinci systems are comprised of an operating console, an electronic vision cart, and a surgical instrument cart. For

mitral/tricuspid valve surgery, the instrument cart should be positioned along the left side of the patient (Fig. 40-18). Activator arms are mobilized to gain access to right chest instrument trocars, which have been inserted through specific ICSs (Fig. 40-19). The two instrument arms, the 3D camera, and dynamic retractor are then inserted through these preplaced

trocars. Instrument end effectors translate accurately the surgeon's hand and finger motions. A clutching mechanism enables frequent hand-position readjustments to maintain an optimal ergonomic orientation to the visual field.

Both the daVinci SI and XI have dual-console capabilities, which enable surgeon collaboration during complex cases and facilitates training. The robotic EndoWrist instruments (Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) have seven degrees of ergonomic freedom, and allow tremor free dexterity with both dominant and nondominant hands. This tremor filtration instills a sense of ambidexterity in the operating surgeon.

# Simulation Training for Robot-Assisted Surgery

Robotic mitral repair would seem to be the ideal operation to simulate because of: (1) a single working-incision entry point, (2) instrument convergence in a limited operative environment, (3) a 3D digital mitral valve image, (4) topographic echo modeling, (5) end-effector motion freedom, and (6) a motionless arrested heart. However, simulation of actual mitral repair operations today has not been possible. Think of a future when a surgical learner could emulate the exact hand motions and instrument interactions in a simulated landscape that was an actual mitral valve repair done by an experienced surgeon. An entire digital library could be cataloged with specific pathologies. Moreover, through image fusion pathology, specific topographic "blue prints" could be transported into the simulated operative field.

Current robotic simulators have evolved to where they can be advantageous to surgeons learning robot-assisted surgery.

Figure 40-20A shows the current Mimic dV-Trainer along with the assistant surgeon simulator console, the Xperience Team Trainer (XTT). The surgeon's simulator console recapitulates realistically the telemanipulation capabilities of the daVinci SI and XI systems. The assistant trainer (Xperience Team Trainer) allows a tableside surgeon to interact with the surgical field in which the console surgeon is operating. Multiple training protocols can be developed to challenge the console and assistant surgeon to perform synchronous tasks customized for a specific operation. As seen in Fig. 40-20B, the Mimic dV-trainer now has augmented reality functionality called Maestro AR that allows trainer instruments either to follow or repeat an actual recorded surgical maneuver. Figure 40-21 shows the da Vinci backpack simulator, which attached directly to either a current daVinci SI or XI console and is integrated with the robotic software. The console surgeon performs specific training tasks using the daVinci hand controls. The daVinci backpack system and the Mimic dV-Trainer record task metrics and generate a skill report for execution accuracy, speed, and ergonomic motions. More difficult surgical tasks are provided iteratively as the surgeon gains increasing simulation experience.

### Instrument Trocar Placement

Instrument trocars (see Figs. 40-19 and 40-22) are positioned as follows: (1) *left robotic arm*—3D interspace (just anterior to anterior axillary line), (2) *right robotic arm*—fifth interspace (anterior to midaxillary line), and (3) dynamic *retractor arm*—fifth interspace (midclavicular line). After tableside docking the instrument cart, the 30° endoscopic camera is passed

The camera trocar is inserted just anterior to and in the same interspace as the working incision. Robotic instruments used for mitral and tricuspid valve surgery include: Resano (8-mm) Endowrist forceps, which are deployed through the left trocar. The curved Endowrist scissors and needle holders (Suture-cut and Large) are inserted through the right port (Fig. 40-23A–D). Lastly, the dual-blade dynamic retractor is positioned in the chest before initiating CPB (Fig. 40-24).

# MIS AND ROBOT-ASSISTED MITRAL/TRICUSPID VALVE REPAIR TECHNIQUES

After the da Vinci system instruments are "trocar-docked" at the operating table, CPB is begun, and the pericardium is opened and distracted laterally. We place the aortic pursestring suture and cardioplegia cannula using robotic instruments. To establish a structurally sound repair, we generally follow the operative philosophy and techniques prescribed by Carpentier.<sup>31</sup> However, modifications and simplifications

of these methods remain the mainstay of our repair strategy for both robot-assisted and videoscopic mitral surgery. Table 40-5 shows our "Technique Toolbox" that we use for both RMVP and MIS videoscopic mitral valve repairs.

## Posterior Mitral Leaflet Repair

All of our leaflet repairs are based on the preoperative echocardiographic measurements shown in Table 40-3, and from these we apply the repair techniques listed in Table 40-5. Of degenerative mitral with significant insufficiency, 80% of pathologies relate to posterior leaflet defects. Thus, a simple triangular resection often will correct isolated segmental prolapse (Fig. 40-25 A (A-E) and B).<sup>68</sup> We suggest first using

this method to correct isolated scallops having mid-prolapse or ruptured chords. Leaflet segments remaining longer than 2-cm can be reduced in height either using a folding plasty (Fig. 40-26A–D) or additional triangular resections. <sup>69</sup> In the presence of diminutive P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>2</sub> scallops with a very large P<sub>2</sub>, either the "haircut" resection technique (Fig. 40-27) or insertion of several PTFE neochords can be effective. <sup>70-72</sup> For multiple prolapsing scallops longer than 2 cm, several folding plasties can be used to create the best coaptation line. Final scallop height adjustments should be made after the annuloplasty band has been implanted. An alternative to triangular resections or folding-plasties is using multiple PTFE neochord replacements (Fig. 40-28A–D, plus insets). Native chord replacements, using either individual neochords or

the "Leipzig-loop" method, have been adopted widely. In severely prolapsing Barlow's valves with very elongated scallops and a great deal of redundant tissue, we still defer to a classic mid scallop ( $P_2$ ) quadrangular resection with a posterior leaflet sliding-plasty (Figs. 40-29A–D and 40-30A–D). However, multiple triangular resections, folding-plasties and/

or multiple neochords may be used to repair moderately diseased Barlow's valves. All of our mitral leaflet repairs have been supported by a trigone to trigone Cosgrove annuloplasty band (Edwards Lifesciences, Inc., Irvine, CA).

## **Anterior Leaflet Repair**

With isolated uniform anterior leaflet prolapse of less than 2 to 3 mm, we place the annuloplasty band first and then perform a saline test. Usually, this corrects a minor prolapse. When significant anterior prolapse exist, individual areas can be addressed with a local triangular resection, a secondary chord transfer or PTFE neochord replacement, or a combination of these techniques. For a large segment, anterior leaflet prolapse multiple neochords are effective as is a "flip over" chord segment transfer (Fig. 40-31A-E) from the posterior leaflet. Advancement of a chord-bearing anterior leaflet strip can be done if there is a uniform prolapse of A (Fig. 40-32A–D). In elderly patients, especially with significant comorbid conditions, we may perform an ("Alfieri") edge-to-edge mid-leaflet repair, combined with an annuloplasty. We only use this repair either when reduced operative time is important or there is a significant chance of residual SAM. When a large anterior leaflet prolapsing segment is related to multiple chords from an elongated papillary muscle, correction can be accomplished either by muscle shortening (folding) (Fig. 40-33A-D) or insertion of several PTFE chords. We perform a saline test after each individual repair maneuver.

## **Commissure Repairs**

In most circumstances, commissure prolapse can be corrected by: (1) closure with a Carpentier "magic" stitch (Lembert edge to edge suture) or figure of eight "Alfieri" stitch, (2) insertion of commissural PTFE chords, or (3) papillary muscle folding. The latter can shorten an elongated papillary muscle that has "seemingly" redundant chords, which are attached to both anterior and posterior leaflet edges. This should symmetrically return the prolapsing commissure to an anatomic position.

## **Annuloplasty Methods**

Annular dilatation is present in most patients with degenerative mitral valve disease. We perform an adjunctive annuloplasty in all repairs to restore the native geometry, reduce the annular size, reinforce the repair and prevent further dilatation. Reducing the anterior-posterior annular diameter increases the leaflet coaptation surface. As mentioned before, annuloplasty band size selection is guided by our intraoperative echocardiographic derived nomogram Table 40-3. For consistency and ease of implantation, we use the Edwards Cosgrove Annuloplasty Band System (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine Calif.) in most robotic and minimally invasive mitral repairs. Generally, a "trigone to trigone" posterior band provides optimal coaptation, while preserving a "saddle-shaped" systolic configuration.

We first place sutures through the right fibrous trigone, and continue in a clockwise direction. Previously, to

The Cleveland Clinic group has shown great success in using a continuous annuloplasty band suturing technique. We now prefer to use multipoint band fixation, using deep annular braded sutures (2-0 Cardioflon, Peters, Inc., Paris, France), which are secured by Cor-Knot (LSI Solutions, Inc., Victor, NY) titanium clips (Fig. 40-34A–C). After passing both suture ends through the band, they are brought through a wire loop in the applier. The suture-bearing wire loop then is withdrawn through both the applier and a titanium shim. After applying countertraction at the annuloplasty band, the device simultaneously crimps the shim and cuts the suture. The Cor-Knot device has been

very effective at both speeding the operative time and providing very secure band attachment.

## Tricuspid Valve Repair

Generally, we perform tricuspid repairs on the beating heart. For cardiac bicaval venous drainage, we isolate the SVC with a double-looped (Potts) umbilical tape and withdraw the IVC cannula below the liver. Alternately, the IVC can be isolated as described for the SVC. After the right atriotomy has been made, the tricuspid valve is exposed with either the stationary lift or dynamic robotic retractor. At the 2 o'clock anterior annular position, a 2-0 braded suture is placed and then passed extra corporeally through a Tri-Ad semi-rigid tricuspid

# ROBOT-ASSISTED MITRAL VALVE REPLACEMENTS

Although tissue excision and suturing methods are similar in robotic mitral valve replacement operations, there are differences in the operative conduct.<sup>74</sup> In some rheumatic valves, leaflet and chordal excision can be difficult using the robotic technique. Current articulated instruments do not have the necessary force to cut very thick or calcified tissue. In this circumstance, we make a larger 5 to 6 cm working incision and excise the thick leaflet and chordal tissue using long manual instruments. We then place all subvalvular valve pledgeted sutures and neochords using daVinci System. Chord sparing replacements are done either by excising the anterior leaflet midportion and leaving natural chords intact or by removing them to increase the prosthesis valve size and replacing them with PTFE neochords. We attempt to preserve all native posterior leaflet chords by passing sutures through the leaflet edge and back through the annulus. In patients with a

severely calcified rheumatic valve or annulus, we may defer to either the 2D endoscopic or direct vision method for a replacement.

To organize sutures securely, guides are placed around the working incision as they are placed serially. Valve sizers are passed through the working incision, and the appropriate prosthetic valve is selected. Thereafter, extra-corporeally suture needles are passed through the prosthetic valve sewing-ring. After positioning the valve in the annulus and confirming seating, sutures are secured using the Core-Knot technique. A ventricular vent is placed and to remove residual air before closing the left atrium. Currently, for all endoscopic and robotic mitral valve operations, we use 4-0 PTFE sutures with pretied end loops to close the left atrium (see Fig. 40-11A). This technique provides a secure closure and saves operative time.

### **COMPLICATIONS AND PREVENTION**

Patients undergoing any minimally invasive mitral/tricuspid valve operation risk the same complications that can occur with a traditional sternotomy-based procedure. Nevertheless, there are other complications that are inherent in perfusion and ventilation methods used for both MIS and robotic operations. In over 1000 robotic cardiac operations, we have

never had a complication that was related directly either to the daVinci System or the robotic instruments. Our back-up plan for a system failure has always been conversion to either a direct-vision, videoscopic, or sternotomy approach.

Possible major complications with tips to prevention are listed as follows:

 Retrograde cardiopulmonary perfusion techniques always induce a risk of atheroembolic strokes, vena caval injury, femoral arterial complications, and retrograde aortic dissections. Careful preoperative vascular screening can minimize these problems. All cannulas should be inserted using the Seldinger technique under echocardiographic

(B) 5-0 Gore-tex PTFE sutures are passed through the fibrous head of the corresponding papillary muscle using a tendon repair "cross stitch" configuration (W. L.

(C) During saline pressure testing these loops are adjusted to provide an optimal coaptation surface. Thereafter they are tied. We suggest that final suture adjustment and tying be done after annuloplasty prosthesis placement. (D) The leaflet prolapse has been reduced to an ideal level of coaptation.

- Leg ischemia during retrograde perfusion can be avoided. We place oxygen saturation monitoring patches on both legs.
   With a significant decrease in cannulated leg oxygen saturation, we place we place a shunt from the CPB arterial cannula into the distal femoral artery.
- Phrenic nerve injury can be caused by over stretching the
  pericardium, cautery thermal injury, cryoablation, and/
  or direct instrument injury. This is a major problem in
  patients with compromised pulmonary function. Injury
  can be avoided by visualization of the nerve during instrument insertion and cautery usage. Overstretching can be
  avoided by making the pericardial incision at least 3-cm
  ventral to the nerve.
- Unilateral pulmonary edema is a serious complication. Short perfusion times, systemic cooling, avoiding

- barotrauma, limiting blood product transfusions, and minimizing lung deflation times can reduce this risk. We also believe that low-level positive pressure and frequent alveolar recruitment, while on cardiopulmonary bypass, is beneficial.<sup>75,76</sup>
- Transthoracic clamp injuries can occur as the posterior element passes near the right pulmonary artery, left main coronary artery, and left atrial appendage. Visualization of the clamp pathway during application minimizes the chance of these complications. Pump arterial flow should be decreased during clamping. We have had no clamp related aortic dissections in any of our robot-assisted or videoscopic MIS mitral operations.
- Right ventricular dysfunction can be minimized. Meticulous cardiac deairing before weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass is essential. Right 30° chest elevation places the right coronary artery ostium in a perfect position

for air embolism from residual left ventricular air and/or aortic entrainment during cardioplegia infusions.

• Left ventricular dysfunction is a serious problem and can be avoided or minimized by selecting patients with ejection fractions of no less that 40 to 50%. If blood cardioplegia is used it must be given at 15- to 20-minute intervals. Systemic cooling (28°C) and meticulous deairing are mandatory to maximize myocardial protection. Ventricular distention is a serious problem and can be prevented by leaving a ventricular vent after a repair or replacement.

### **CLINICAL OUTCOMES**

# Nonrobotic Minimally Invasive Mitral Valve Surgery

Many earlier observational and/or propensity-matched series have shown that direct-vision and video-assisted MIS mitral

surgery is safe with clinical results similar to operations done through a sternotomy. Four recent studies, that are cited herein, each reported over 1000 MIS mitral operations. The Nearly all of the 6179 patients were operated through a right minithoracotomy and approximately 75% underwent retrograde femoral CPB perfusion. Of these patients, the operative mortality was 0.75% and stroke rate was 1.2% (mean). Mohr et al reported the largest of these series with 2829 MIS mitral repairs. Their freedom from a reoperation was 97 and 93% at 5 years and 10 years, respectively. The long-term survival was 87 and 74% at 5 and 10 years, respectively.

A recent meta-analysis from the International Society of Minimally Invasive Cardiac Surgery showed that versus a conventional (C) sternotomy, MIS mitral operations had less postoperative atrial fibrillation, chest tube drainage, transfusions, and infections.<sup>13</sup> There was no difference in the repair quality or freedom from reoperation. Moreover, operative mortality was not statistically different (1.5% C vs 1.2% MIS). Other benefits included reduced intensive care times and length of hospitalization as well as faster return to normal activity. These advantages were despite significantly longer perfusion and aortic cross clamp times. Conversely, they found more strokes (1.2% C vs 2.0% MIS), aortic dissections (0.0% C vs 0.2% MIS), and phrenic nerve injuries (0% C vs 3.0% MIS) in the MIS group. In contradistinction, the metaanalyses of Modi, Cao, and Sundermann have shown similar benefits and clinical outcomes as with traditional sternotomy operations, including strokes and operative mortality.<sup>81–83</sup>

The presumptive increased stroke risk with MIS has been attributed to retrograde CPB perfusion.84-86 Most studies that impugned retrograde perfusion as the etiology of MIS strokes also included large numbers of patients who underwent endo-balloon aortic clamping. Retrograde endo-balloon catheter passage through the aorta seemingly risks cerebral atheroembolism, especially in nonscreened patients. This confounds any study that is considering the absolute relationship between retrograde perfusion and strokes. Moreover, these series did not report a vascular screening strategy and subtended the early days of MIS mitral surgery. Grossi found that there were no differences in perioperative strokes between antegrade and retrograde perfusion, if screened high-risk vascular patients were not included.86 Atluri and Hargrove determined that in screened patients with retrograde CPB perfusion both endoballoon and direct aortic clamping had similar neurological events.<sup>87</sup> Also, Modi and Chitwood (metaanalysis) showed retrograde perfusion to be safe when patients were screened for aortic and peripheral vascular disease.88

## Robot-Assisted Mitral Valve Surgery

Our early series (years 2000–2010) reported 540 RMVPs of which 454 patients underwent a lone mitral procedure, and 86 had a concomitant atrial fibrillation ablation. <sup>56</sup> In the lone repair cohort, cross clamp and CPB times averaged 116 and 153 minutes, respectively, and the operative mortality was 0.2%. Of those treated for preoperative atrial fibrillation, 96.5% were atrial fibrillation and drug free at 351 days

(15–946 days). During patient follow-up, 2.9% required a re-operation for a failed repair. This study included the original FDA clinical trials and was the inaugural United States robotic mitral valve repair series.

Overall, we have performed over 1000 RMVP operations at our institution. Our single surgeon's (Dr. Chitwood) experience of 944 RMVPs (years 2000–2014) included the earlier series. For these operations, the original daVinci, the daVinci S, and the daVinci SI devices were used serially. Trento showed improving results with every device iteration, as did our group. Of these patients, 675 had RMVPs alone, 321 had a concurrent maze procedure (M-RMVP) and 38 were reoperations in patients that had a prior sternotomy (Re-RMVP). For the entire series, the in-hospital mortality was 1.4%; however, for

an isolated RMVP was 0.15%. Of the entire series, 2.5% had reoperations for a failed repair, which was 1.7% for a lone RMVP. For each of these cohorts, mean CPB times were 148, 187, and 176 minutes, respectively. For RMVP and M-RMVP groups, mean aortic cross-clamp times were 108 and 128 minutes, respectively. Re-RMVP operations were done under hypothermic ventricular fibrillation (113 minutes, mean). In the RMVP patients, *major complications* included myocardial infarctions (0.9%) and strokes (0.9%). Reexplorations for bleeding were required in 2.7% of patients. There were two incidences of residual phrenic nerve palsy. Packed red cell transfusions were required in 28% of patients and 38% with any blood product. Of the RMVP patients, 56.9% were discharged within 4 days with 75.0% within 5 days. When

leaving the operating room, 97.1% of patients had no or trivial mitral regurgitation. Table 40-6 shows the complete post repair transesophageal echocardiographic data. Other large RMVP series have shown similar clinical outcomes.<sup>57-60</sup>

### The Future

As the singer Bob Dylan said in 1964 "*The Times They Are a Changin*" and indeed they are changing .... and fast. <sup>89,90</sup> Long-term clinical data have established the expectation that mitral repair is the "gold" standard. Cardiology guidelines now

suggest that asymptomatic patients should be referred for surgery earlier, before atrial fibrillation, ventricular dysfunction, annular dilatation, and/or advanced valve pathology develops. Echocardiographic imaging continues to advance every year, and providing improved operative guidance. In experienced hands, minimally invasive and robotic derived repair results now parallel those of sternotomy operations. Although minimally invasive mitral surgery in the United States lags behind European centers, our younger surgeons know that the future favors even less invasive operations. Finally, the Internet and social media have given patients many more clinical choices

and empowerment than in the past. They are more knowledgeable about their health care and demand to participate. Collectively, these facts seem like the "Sword of Damocles" for surgeons who scoff at the evolving mitral technology.

Advent and application of the Mitra-Clip (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA) and completion of the first Everest Trial proved that in high-risk patients, mitral regurgitation could be reduced to the point where symptoms abated. Even when some residual regurgitation remained, patients were better. This set the stage for off-pump neochord chord replacements to reduce leaflet prolapse in patients with a nondilated annulus. Transcatheter annuloplasty prostheses been developed to reduce dilatation. The story regarding treatment of ischemic mitral regurgitation is not completed, but we do know that transcatheter replacements may stabilize patients more than a repair. Heretofore, less attention was paid to the leaking "lonely" tricuspid valve. The natural history of this malady is better understood and transcatheter remedies are evolving.

Where does that leave surgeons? We are in the enviable position of being able to surgically repair mitral valves while simultaneously coopting transcatheter therapy. Owing to proven long-lasting results, surgical repair in younger patients will continue for a number of years. To be sure, if we can provide the least invasive complete repairs, based on sound engineering principles, we will prevail. Hopefully, principles set forth in this chapter comprise the entry portal to the future of mitral valve therapy.
