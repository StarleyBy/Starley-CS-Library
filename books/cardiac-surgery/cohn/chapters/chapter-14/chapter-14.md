# Transfusion Therapy and Blood Conservation

Andreas R. de Biasi • William J. DeBois • O. Wayne Isom • Arash Salemi

Concurrent with the development of cardiac surgery in the 1950s as a means of correcting congenital heart defects came the need for large-volume blood transfusions. In the 1960s and 1970s, the introduction of valve prostheses and direct grafting of coronary arteries also made the repair of acquired heart diseases a possibility. These landmarks, along with the early liberal use of allogeneic blood transfusion therapy, led to rapid growth of our field.

Historically, open-heart surgery has been associated with large transfusion requirements. Some reports suggest that up to 70% of this patient population requires blood transfusions, resulting in an average of 2 to 4 donor exposures per patient.<sup>1,2</sup> It has been reported that cardiac surgery consumes about 20% of the available blood supply in the United States, with similar figures observed worldwide.3 These relatively high rates of transfusions are mostly attributable to cardiopulmonary-bypass-induced phenomena: coagulopathy, platelet dysfunction, and red cell hemolysis all occur to varying degrees as a result of the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit. 4-6 Other mechanisms for bleeding include inherited and acquired disorders (including platelet dysfunctions, coagulation factor deficiencies, and derangements leading to excessive fibrinolysis) of numerous etiologies.7 While common transfusion reactions such as urticaria and fever are easily managed and largely benign, rarer complications like transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) pose serious risks to patients (eg, the mortality rate for TRALI in critically ill populations ranges from 35–58%8,9) and provide further impetus for the avoidance of blood product transfusions when at all possible.

Although life-threatening hemorrhage is an obvious absolute indication for blood products, many transfusions are also given to improve oxygen-carrying capacity and to avoid or reverse end-organ ischemia. Despite the potential benefits of transfusing blood to maintain end-organ oxygenation, there is a surprising lack of evidence to support the liberal use of blood transfusions in cardiac surgery. In fact, there is a growing literature base demonstrating that transfusions are associated with an increased risk of both morbidity and mortality. <sup>10-12</sup> For example, red blood cell (RBC) transfusions

have been associated with longer intensive care unit lengths of stay as well as with worse short- and long-term survival. <sup>13-15</sup> A large prospective study identified RBC transfusion as the strongest independent predictor of all-cause morbidity and mortality following isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and that each unit of blood transfused posed an additive risk for adverse outcomes. <sup>16</sup>

Concerns over the negative consequences of blood transfusions are not new. As cardiac surgery grew as a discipline in the 1970s, investigators concomitantly noted an increasing incidence of transfusion-transmitted hepatitis; this public health concern first alerted patients and physicians to the concept of blood conservation. The emergence of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) a decade later further heightened interest in this area. Considering (1) the increased awareness of blood-borne infectious diseases, (2) the ever-present shortage of available blood donors, (3) the costs of blood products to both patients and institutions, (4) the needs of special populations like Jehovah's Witnesses, and (5) the inherent risks from transfusions, a greater effort was made to perform open-heart procedures without blood transfusions, even in high-risk patients. Additionally, randomized trials showing that lower hemoglobin thresholds were tolerated in both critically ill and cardiac surgical patients further contributed to decreasing transfusions and to the acceptance of some degree of anemia in our patients. 17-19

As we will discuss, advances in preoperative screening and patient optimization; improvements in surgical techniques and shorter operative times; the use of perioperative pharmacologics and other technologies designed to curtail blood loss; and the aforementioned tolerance of lower hematocrits, especially on bypass, have allowed for extensive procedures to be routinely performed without significant blood loss and with fewer transfusions.

Comprehensive blood conservation programs that combine such elements (analogous to the use of care bundles in the critical care setting) are likely the most effective strategy in decreasing patients' exposure to allogeneic blood. In 1991, Ovrum and colleagues established the effectiveness of the simple "core" approach to blood conservation in a cohort

of 121 consecutive elective CABG patients -the authors achieved a transfusion rate of 4.1% and required only 0.06 RBC units per patient.<sup>20</sup> Later that year, the same group applied these principles to a larger group of 500 elective CABG patients, obtaining similar low rates of transfusion (2.4% of patients) and demonstrating that an impressive 96% of patients received no allogeneic blood products; the authors concluded their multimodal six-step blood conservation program was simple, safe, and cost effective.<sup>21</sup> More recently, Van der Linden and colleagues developed a blood conservation program that employed a standardized transfusion policy and algorithm-driven protocols aimed at minimizing perioperative blood loss.<sup>22</sup> Using this strategy, the group reported a 53% decrease in RBC utilization and a 46% decrease in the number of patients receiving any blood products, without a significant difference in postoperative hemoglobin; moreover, their strategy was also shown to be safe and cost effective.<sup>22</sup> It should be noted that the success of such multidisciplinary programs is not limited to large teaching institutions, as similar results have been shown in the community setting.<sup>23</sup>

# BLOOD CONSERVATION: PREOPERATIVE CONSIDERATIONS

# Identification of Patients at Risk of Bleeding or of Requiring Transfusion

An important first step in mitigating bleeding and transfusion requirements is to identify those patients most at risk for blood loss and/or for needing blood product replacement. Five factors have been identified that are consistently associated with increased rates of RBC transfusions in cardiac surgery: low preoperative hemoglobin and/or hematocrit, advanced patient age, female sex, renal insufficiency, and surgery urgency.<sup>24</sup> Additional risk factors include a personal and/or family history of any excessive bleeding or the presence of a documented bleeding disorder; preoperative antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy (eg, aspirin, clopidogrel, warfarin); insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus; decreased left ventricular function; anticipated long CPB time; and type of surgery (with complex valvular and aortic surgeries conferring the greatest risks).<sup>25</sup> Current Society of Thoracic Surgery/Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists (STS/SCA) blood conservation guidelines recommend obtaining preoperative hematocrits and platelet counts to aid risk prediction, as abnormalities in these variables are amenable to intervention; preoperative bleeding time may also be determined in high-risk patients, especially those on preoperative antiplatelet agents.<sup>26</sup> Of note, preoperative screening of the intrinsic coagulation system is not recommended unless there is a clinical history of a prior bleeding diathesis.26

Awareness of the above-listed risk factors is important as the recognition of specific risks should guide subsequent preoperative patient management with the intent of optimizing a given patient's risk profile. We will in turn discuss three such preoperative management issues: medication cessation, increasing preoperative RBC mass, and preoperative autologous donation.

# Managing Medications Contributing to Bleeding and Transfusion Risks

The regular, preoperative use of antiplatelet medications like aspirin and clopidogrel have been associated with increased perioperative blood loss as well as with the need for blood products in cardiac surgery patients—as such, a thorough understanding of current guidelines pertaining to their use prior to cardiac surgery is requisite. With the advent of newer anticoagulants (eg, direct thrombin inhibitors, direct factor Xa inhibitors), insight into what to do about these drugs must be assimilated with knowledge of older, well-established guidelines on the cessation of traditional vitamin K antagonists. Table 14-1 lists some of the more commonly encountered of these drugs.

#### **ASPIRIN**

Aspirin irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 and -2, leading to decreased formation of thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> and ultimately to inhibited platelet aggregation. The ability of aspirin to irreversibly induce this qualitative platelet defect has led to its widespread use as a thromboprophylaxing agent in many cardiovascular disease states (eg, coronary artery disease, carotid artery stenosis, after prosthetic valve insertion, or CABG); as such, aspirin is a very frequently encountered drug in our patient population. Current guidelines state that it is reasonable to discontinue aspirin prior to cardiac surgery only in purely elective patients not having acute coronary syndromes.<sup>26</sup>

### ADENOSINE DIPHOSPHATE RECEPTOR INHIBITORS

These antiplatelet drugs (clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor, and ticlopidine) inhibit the P2Y<sub>12</sub> subtype of platelet adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptors, thus causing irreversible platelet inhibition (of note, ticagrelor is an allosteric antagonist, making its ADP blockage reversible). Members of this class of drugs are frequently used in combination with other antiplatelet agents like aspirin as part of dual antiplatelet therapies for acute coronary syndromes and for thromboprophylaxis in those with stents and/or cerebrovascular disease. ADP receptor inhibitors are felt to confer greater bleeding and transfusion risks than aspirin; as such, guidelines recommend discontinuation of these agents as few as 3 days prior to cardiac surgery (with specific timing determined by a given drug's half-life of elimination).26 Point-of-care (POC, discussed later) testing assessing platelet responsiveness to clopidogrel, specifically, may be used to identify those nonresponders who are candidates for early operative coronary revascularization and who may thus not require a preoperative cessation period.<sup>26</sup>

#### GLYCOPROTEIN IIb/IIIa INHIBITORS

Members of this drug class (eg, abciximab, eptifibatide, tiro-fiban) prevent platelet aggregation via inhibition of glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptors on the surface of platelets; these agents are frequently used during percutaneous coronary interventions and in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes. Like the other previously mentioned high-intensity antiplatelet drugs, GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors are associated with increased bleeding after cardiac operations; as such, these medications should be stopped prior to surgery in order to decrease minor and major bleeding events.<sup>26</sup> Exact timing again depends on the half-life of each agent in question.

It should be noted that unfractionated heparin is the notable exception to the cessation recommendations pertaining to the high-intensity antithrombotic drugs outlined by the STS/SCA guidelines: unfractionated heparin is the only agent which can either be discontinued shortly before operation or not at all.<sup>26</sup>

#### VITAMIN K ANTAGONISTS

Vitamin K antagonists are anticoagulants that reduce hepatic production of coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X as well as of proteins C and S—all of which depend on vitamin K for their synthesis. Warfarin, the most widely encountered of

these drugs, is used both in the prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic disorders (eg, venous or pulmonary clots, prosthetic valve thrombosis); warfarin is similarly used in atrial fibrillation and can serve as an adjunct to reduce systemic embolic risks after myocardial infarction. According to recent guidelines produced by the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery, patients on warfarin prior to cardiac surgery should be managed in a similar manner to those undergoing major noncardiac surgery.<sup>27</sup> That is, warfarin should be discontinued 2 to 4 days before surgery and patients at higher risk of thrombosis should be bridged with intravenous heparin once the international normalized ratio becomes subtherapeutic.<sup>27</sup>

# NOVEL ORAL ANTICOAGULANTS: DIRECT THROMBIN INHIBITORS AND DIRECT FACTOR XA INHIBITORS

Although novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) belonging to the direct thrombin inhibitor (eg, dabigatran) and direct factor Xa inhibitor (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) classes are currently not indicated for patients with mechanical valves, their ease of use and their lack of a monitoring requirement (as compared to warfarin) have increased the popularity of these drugs for patients requiring long-term anticoagulation for nonvalvular reasons. Current guidelines regarding the perioperative use of NOACs recommend these drugs be discontinued 2 to 5 days prior to procedures with a high risk of bleeding, including major abdominal, cardiovascular, and thoracic operations.<sup>28,29</sup> Since the diminution of the anticoagulant effects of NOACs is predictable after their cessation, bridging is typically not required after NOACs are stopped.

The management of patients on NOACs requiring emergency surgery is complicated by the fact that these agents have no specific antidote. In this setting, surgery should be deferred for at least 12 hours if at all possible; given NOACs' short half-lives, this should allow for some mitigation of bleeding risk.<sup>30</sup> If delaying surgery is not possible, expert opinion suggests the use of oral activated charcoal or hemodialysis; prophylactic administration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs, discussed below) is not recommended in the absence of major bleeding.<sup>30</sup>

# HERBAL SUPPLEMENTS AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE

The use of herbal supplements and complementary medicine has seemingly exploded in popularity recently and warrants mentioning since many of these naturopathic treatments can have profound hematologic effects. Herbs, such as thyme and rosemary have been shown to have a direct inhibitory effect on platelets.<sup>31</sup> Fish oil, an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, may affect platelet aggregation and/or vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. Omega-3 fatty acids may lower thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> within platelets as well as decrease factor VII levels,<sup>32</sup> while garlic, ginger, and *Gingko biloba* have all been associated with platelet-dysfunction-induced bleeding.<sup>33</sup> Given the many possible antiplatelet and anticoagulant

effects of such alternative medicines, not to mention their myriad interactions (both known and unknown) with other drugs, it is therefore prudent to inquire about any supplements patients may be taking prior to cardiac surgery. It is our practice to have patients stop all such remedies 7 days prior to surgery.

#### Increasing Preoperative Red Blood Cell Mass

Increasing RBC mass prior to surgery is another component of blood conservation, as decreased preoperative hemoglobin or hematocrit levels have been shown to be powerful predictors of the need for transfusion as well as significant risk factors for early and late mortality. <sup>25,34</sup> Such optimization necessitates diagnosing and treating preoperative anemia. Since iron-deficiency anemia is common in the cardiac surgery population, iron supplementation can restore hemoglobin concentrations to adequate levels (eg, 13 g/dL or above), thereby decreasing transfusion risk.

The use of recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) has been studied as an additional means of improving RBC mass in anemic patients preparing to undergo cardiac surgery. A meta-analysis examining such preoperative EPO administration demonstrated that its use prior to cardiac surgery was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of exposure to allogeneic blood.<sup>35</sup> While there are some concerns that chronic EPO use may carry an increased risk of thrombotic complications, a recent randomized, blinded trial of preoperative high-dose EPO of short duration showed a 56% decrease in the relative risk of exposure to blood products in patients undergoing off-pump CABG following preoperative EPO versus those not given EPO; no adverse effects were observed.<sup>36</sup> The contemporary STS/SCA guidelines state that it is reasonable to use preoperative EPO and iron several days prior to cardiac surgery in patients with anemia, in those who refuse transfusion (eg, Jehovah's Witness), or in patients who are at high risk for postoperative anemia.<sup>26</sup>

# Preoperative Autologous Blood Donation

Preoperative autologous blood donation (PABD) remains an option at selected centers for minimizing patient exposures to allogeneic blood. Although this technique has been in practice since the 1960s, its use in cardiac surgery did not achieve widespread acceptance until the 1980s, when the rise of HIV led to increased interest in PABD as a way of reducing allogeneic transfusions. Unfortunately, the acuity of most cardiac operations precludes the routine use PABD as there must be sufficient time between donation and surgery to allow for the regeneration of the patient's RBC mass. In general, this time is a minimum of 2 weeks per unit of blood donated. What is more, patients must have enough reserve to tolerate the ensuing transient anemia, further limiting PABD's utility. PABD is only an option for the elective, stable preoperative patient;

additionally, there are numerous relative contraindications to PABD, including the presence of left main disease, critical aortic stenosis, congestive heart failure, severe coronary artery disease with ongoing ischemia, active endocarditis, and baseline anemia.

Most of the randomized studies evaluating PABD involve small sample sizes and level A evidence of its benefits are lacking<sup>37</sup>; nevertheless, a recent case-control study examining the technique showed a lower incidence of allogeneic transfusions among those patients who donated preoperatively compared to those who did not (but 20% of the donated blood products were discarded postoperatively).<sup>38</sup> As such, the most recent STS/STA guidelines do not directly endorse PABD; they mention PABD only in the context of EPO use, wherein the guidelines state EPO additionally may be considered to restore RBC volume in patients undergoing PABD.<sup>26</sup> For reasons of practicality and cost effectiveness, PABD has largely been supplanted by numerous perioperative blood conservation strategies, which we discuss in the next section.

# BLOOD CONSERVATION: PERIOPERATIVE STRATEGIES

### Cardiopulmonary Bypass Considerations

Numerous CPB techniques have been validated to reduce blood loss and to protect against transfusions during and after cardiac surgery. These strategies, which we discuss in turn, require coordination between the operating surgeon and perfusionist and constitute another vital component of any comprehensive blood conservation program.

#### ACUTE NORMOVOLEMIC HEMODILUTION

Acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) involves the removal of 1 to 2 units of whole blood (target hematocrit of 25–30%) from the patient immediately before, or during, surgery (but prior to CPB initiation) while simultaneously replacing it with crystalloid or colloid to maintain normovolemia. The theoretical basis for ANH (also known referred to as intraoperative autologous donation) is that this lowering of the hematocrit results in fewer RBCs being lost when the patient subsequently bleeds during the course of the operation. Moreover, the removed blood is spared the effects of hemodilution from CPB and is shielded from the inflammatory response of blood cells to the bypass circuit. The collected blood—rich in valuable components (eg, platelets, coagulation factors)—is then infused back to the patient after separation from CPB and heparin reversal.

The amount of blood that an individual patient is capable of donating via ANH depends strictly on the patient's own physiologic parameters, estimated blood volume (based on height-weight nomograms), and hematocrit. Figure 14-1 is our nomogram for allowable ANH blood drainage—this conservatively estimates the volume of blood that can be removed to achieve a hematocrit of 24% or greater (based on a 1000 mL CPB prime volume).

ANH is relatively contraindicated in patients with preoperative anemia, unstable angina, and those with ejection fractions less than 30%.<sup>37</sup> Additionally, evidence supporting its use is conflicting: a few prospective studies showed a significant decrease in allogeneic blood product use,<sup>39,40</sup> others showed no benefit from ANH,<sup>41,42</sup> while a meta-analysis and review found only a modest benefit.<sup>43</sup> Contemporary guidelines state that ANH may be considered as part of a multipronged approach to blood conservation in selected (ie, nonanemic) patients, but note that its usefulness is not well-established.<sup>26,44</sup>

#### RETROGRADE AUTOLOGOUS PRIMING

Low hematocrits during CPB were shown to have detrimental effects on end-organ function and cognitive outcomes. 45-49 In retrograde autologous priming (RAP), the CPB circuit is primed with the patient's own whole blood, thereby minimizing circuit-induced hemodilution (which results from crystalloid priming) and ideally reducing the subsequent need for allogeneic transfusions. Specifically, blood from the aorta is allowed to flow retrogradely through the arterial arm of the bypass circuit, displacing portions of the crystalloid prime. Once the desired prime volume is displaced, a similar procedure can be applied to the venous line (so-called venous antegrade priming) to remove additional crystalloid from the circuit.

RAP was shown to reduce hemodilution and allogeneic transfusions (as compared to conventional CPB priming) in a large, retrospective study<sup>50</sup> as well as in a recent meta-analysis<sup>51</sup>; however, the latter showed that RAP had no effect on clinical outcomes like ventilator hours or length of stay.<sup>51</sup> RAP is currently endorsed by several societal guidelines as a method of reducing allogeneic blood transfusions during on-pump cardiac surgery.<sup>26,44</sup>

## MINI-CIRCUITS AND VACUUM-ASSISTED VENOUS DRAINAGE

Advances in CPB circuit design have further reduced the impact of priming-induced hemodilution as well as the inflammatory responses initiated by blood-material interactions—these improvements may lessen the need for subsequent transfusions. Minimizing circuit length decreases the priming volume while also reducing the surface area of foreign material to which blood is exposed. This latter point serves to decrease the contact-dependent systemic inflammatory response, thereby reducing transcapillary leak; minimizing blood-material interactions via smaller circuits can also decrease the sheering of blood cells.<sup>37</sup>

Newer, so-called mini-circuits are fully closed CPB systems that also eliminate blood-air contact, as these circuits often do not use a venous reservoir; mini-circuits typically have priming volumes of less than 500 mL. Compared to conventional CPB, mini-circuits have been shown to more stably maintain hemoglobin concentrations intraoperatively, to reduce postoperative transfusion requirements, and even to improve mortality after CABG. 52-54 One potential downside

FIGURE 14-1 Nomogram for allowable acute normovolemic hemodilution/intraoperative autologous donation.

to mini-circuits is that the introduction of air into the closed venous system risks creation of an air lock; additionally, the absence of a venous reservoir creates the potential for exsanguination after uncontrolled bleeding. Based on the results of nine randomized trials and a well-constructed meta-analysis, all of which suggested mini-circuits reduce postoperative bleeding and transfusions, the STS/STA guidelines now recommend the use of these systems for blood conservation.<sup>26</sup>

Many mini-circuits also incorporate vacuum-assisted venous drainage, as opposed to the gravity drainage used in conventional CPB systems. While mini-circuits using vacuum drainage may improve hemostasis and decrease blood requirements compared to regular circuits, there is some concern that the vacuum entrains air and that this can lead to increased systemic microemboli compared with gravity venous drainage. Therefore, current guidelines urge caution with respect to vacuum-assisted venous drainage but point out that this technology may provide some benefit, especially in pediatric patients.<sup>26</sup>

#### MODIFIED ULTRAFILTRATION

Another method of limiting CPB-induced hemodilution involves modified ultrafiltration (UF), wherein water and low-molecular-weight substances are filtered out of the blood

at the conclusion of a case; the resultant protein-rich concentrated whole blood is then returned to the patient. Specifically, this technique uses a special UF device added to a typical bypass system; using the existing CPB cannulae, free water as well as detrimental, pump-induced inflammatory mediators are removed from the patient's blood at the conclusion of a pump run but prior to the patient leaving the operating theater. Compared with other intraoperative UF procedures (eg, conventional UF, which runs simultaneously with CPB, or zero balance UF, in which the removed free water is replaced with a crystalloid solution), modified UF has well-established benefits in terms of mitigating hemodilution as well as reducing postoperative bleeding and blood product usage.26 As such, the current STS/STA guidelines recommend the use of modified UF for blood conservation and for reducing postoperative blood loss in adult cardiac surgeries requiring CPB.26

#### AUTOTRANSFUSION OF CARDIOTOMY-SUCTIONED, CENTRIFUGED, OR RESIDUAL-CIRCUIT BLOOD

Salvaging extravascular blood (ie, shed blood from the operative field or residual blood in the bypass circuit) is another important element in blood conservation. Cell salvage

systems have been shown to decrease the incidence of RBC transfusions in cardiac surgery<sup>55</sup> and may be especially useful in off-pump CABG, where cardiotomy suction is not available.<sup>37</sup>

Contemporary blood conservation guidelines therefore recommend intraoperative autotransfusions during CPB using blood directly from cardiotomy suction and/or recycled blood that has been centrifuged to concentrate red cells. Additionally, consensus suggests that reinfusion of residual blood in the CPB circuit at the conclusion of a procedure is a reasonable part of a blood management program. <sup>26</sup>

### **Operative Techniques**

Interest in minimally invasive techniques for cardiac surgery continues to grow. At their core, these advanced procedures are intended to lessen the extent of the surgical insult, which, in turn, can translate into reduced blood loss and the avoidance of transfusions. Operations performed without CPB, via transcatheter or endovascular approaches, or through minithoracotomies (MTs) are becoming increasingly prevalent in cardiac surgery and have been studied with respect to their ability to conserve blood.

#### **OFF-PUMP CABG**

A number of well-designed studies have shown that patients undergoing off-pump CABG have reduced transfusion requirements as compared to patients undergoing CABG on CPB, 56-58 have fewer reoperations for bleeding, 57 and are less coagulopathic postoperatively. 58 As is the case with minicircuits, these benefits from off-pump surgery stem from the avoidance of CPB-induced hemodilution and inflammation. While the current STS/STA blood conservation guidelines recommend off-pump CABG as a reasonable means of blood conservation, 26 recent evidence suggesting that graft patency is reduced in off-pump CABG patients has tempered some of the earlier excitement surrounding this technique. 56,59

#### OTHER MINIMALLY INVASIVE APPROACHES

Numerous other minimally invasive surgical procedures have emerged over the last decade. These techniques are still evolving and many have not been subjected to rigorous, prospective study. Nevertheless, promising lines of evidence are beginning to emerge showing that several of these new cardiac operations may have the potential to curb blood loss and to reduce transfusion risks. For example, thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is increasingly being used to repair various descending aortic lesions and has been demonstrated to reduce transfusions and reoperations for bleeding as compared to open aortic surgery. The use of TEVAR in selected patients was therefore added as a recommendation in the most recent STS/STA blood conservation guidelines.<sup>26</sup> Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) allows for the replacement of stenotic aortic valves in high-risk patients using a sternum-sparing, endovascular approach. Although

TAVR has been associated with higher rates of vascular complications, major bleeding events occurred less often with this technique as compared to surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR).<sup>61</sup> Accordingly, the incidence of transfusions following TAVR was also shown to be less than with surgical AVR.<sup>62-64</sup>

Bleeding can also be minimized by forgoing full sternotomy in favor of smaller thoracic incisions. For instance, both the aortic and mitral valves can be approached via a small right anterior thoracotomy (ie, MT). AVR performed through MT has been shown to reduce blood loss as compared to sternotomy-based AVR<sup>65</sup>; similarly, mitral valve replacement (MVR) via MT was demonstrated to reduce RBC transfusion volumes as compared to MVR performed via traditional sternotomy.<sup>66</sup> Although current International Society for Minimally Invasive Cardiothoracic Surgery (ISMICS) guidelines do not go so far as to recommend such MT approaches outright, they point out that the ability of MTs to reduce allogeneic blood exposures should be considered when balancing the risks and benefits of these newer procedures.<sup>44</sup>

### **Topical Hemostatic Agents**

Surgical bleeding (ie, bleeding from suture lines or anastomoses) accounts for over half of all cases taken back to the operating room due to postoperative blood loss. <sup>67</sup> As a result, numerous topical hemostatic agents have been developed to reduce or prevent surgical bleeding when used as adjuncts to conventional suturing techniques. The limited efficacy of older topical agents such as oxidized cellulose and microfibrillar collagen has led to the introduction of newer products with novel applicator systems, some of which can directly activate the clotting cascade. We briefly describe some of the more commonly encountered of these products, although evidence-based comparisons between these agents are largely lacking. Table 14-2 comprehensively summarizes most of the currently available topical agents.

Fibrin sealants (Tisseel [Baxter Healthcare Corp., Deerfield, IL, USA], Beriplast [CSL Bering, King of Prussia, PA, USA], and Hemaseel [Haemacure Corp., Montreal, QB, Canada]) comprised of freeze-dried human fibrinogen, clotting proteins, fibronectin, and bovine thrombin or bovine aprotinin have been widely used in cardiac surgery; a systematic review on their use suggested that fibrin sealants are efficacious in decreasing the need for allogeneic transfusions. However, these products are quite immunogenic and can lead to an unacceptably high incidence of anaphylaxis recent reports of myocardial injury secondary to acute coronary bypass graft thrombosis and of mechanical aortic valve dysfunction following the use of fibrin sealants have led some to further caution against using these agents in such procedures.

FloSeal (Baxter Healthcare Corp.) is a bovine-derived gelatin matrix cross-linked with a human-derived thrombin solution, which when applied, activates the clotting cascade and simultaneously forms a nondisplacing hemostatic plug. Unlike other fibrin sealants, FloSeal requires blood as a fibrinogen source; the product is biocompatible and reabsorbed in 6 to 8 weeks. Compared to a Gelfoam-thrombin control,

FloSeal proved more effective in stopping arterial suture line bleeding within 10 minutes in cardiac surgery patients, especially before protamine reversal.<sup>72</sup>

BioGlue (CryoLife Inc., Kennesaw, GA, USA) is a biologic glue approved initially for use in the repair of aortic dissections. This product consists of a glutaraldehyde solution and a separate bovine serum albumin solution that are mixed at the time of use via a dual-cartridge, single-nozzle dispenser.

The resultant flexible mechanical seal forms within 2 minutes, independent of the body's clotting mechanism. Both observational and randomized studies have demonstrated Bio-Glue significantly decreased anastomotic bleeding in cardiac, aortic, and peripheral vascular procedures as compared with a standard surgical control. 73,74

Current STS/STA guidelines state that topical hemostatic agents may be considered to provide local hemostasis

at anastomotic sites as part of a multimodal blood management program. As those guidelines point out, despite the widespread use of such products in cardiac surgery, no single topical preparation has emerged as a clear frontrunner, highlighting the need for randomized controlled trials of these agents. 6

### **Antifibrinolytic Agents**

Antifibrinolytic prophylaxis has been well-studied in cardiac surgery and currently is centered around two drugs: the lysine analogs tranexamic acid (TA) and epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA). These agents bind to plasminogen and inhibit its binding to fibrin, thereby impairing fibrinolysis. A third antifibrinolytic drug, aprotinin, is a bovine-derived serine protease inhibitor of the fibrinolytic enzyme, plasmin. While aprotinin has long been confirmed to decrease bleeding rates and transfusion requirements as compared to placebo, aprotinin was removed from market in 2007 over concerns regarding renal toxicity<sup>75,76</sup> and because of higher mortality in aprotinin-treated patients in a randomized, prospective trial comparing that drug with TA and EACA.<sup>77</sup>

#### TRANEXAMIC ACID

Although TA and EACA share similar mechanisms of action, the significant difference between the two agents is that TA is roughly 10 times more potent than EACA. Several metaanalyses have highlighted the benefits of TA in decreasing postoperative transfusion requirements, 78,79 the most recent of which demonstrated significant decreases in RBC transfusions and in repeat surgery rates for bleeding when comparing TA use with controls.<sup>80</sup> No sufficiently powered, randomized controlled trial exists, however, comparing the effects of TA administration versus placebo on transfusion requirements. Of note, concerns over TA's safety profile (seizure risk, in particular) as well as debates on dosing strategies for this drug continue. Nevertheless, the use of TA is a class I recommendation in the current STS/SCA blood conservation guidelines for reducing total blood loss and for decreasing the number of patients who require blood transfusions during cardiac procedures.<sup>26</sup>

#### **EPSILON-AMINOCAPROIC ACID**

Introduced to cardiac surgery in 1962,<sup>81</sup> EACA remains the most commonly used antifibrinolytic agent in the United States. EACA has repeatedly been shown to result in decreased postoperative RBC blood loss and in transfusion rates similar to those observed for aprotinin (when compared to placebo).<sup>82-85</sup> Loading doses from 50 to 150 mg/kg followed by infusions from 25 to 30 mg/kg/h allow plasma EACA levels to be maintained at greater than 130  $\mu g/mL$ , the minimum concentration needed to suppress plasmin activity.<sup>25</sup> Like TA, EACA is indicated for blood conservation by the contemporary STS/SCA guidelines.<sup>26</sup>

# POSTOPERATIVE CONCERNS AND MANAGEMENT

Blood conservation does not stop at the conclusion of the cardiac surgery; rather, through the coordinated efforts of both the surgical and intensivist teams, various postoperative strategies—transfusion triggers, POC testing, the use of novel blood products, etc.—can be employed to minimize further bleeding and to avoid unnecessary hemodilution and RBC transfusions. Perhaps the most central issue in this postoperative blood conservation paradigm concerns the seemingly straightforward question of "when do we transfuse a patient?"

### **Transfusion Triggers**

The literature indicates that the anesthetized patient on full CPB at moderate hypothermia can safely tolerate a hematocrit as low as 15%, with the exception of patients at risk for decreased cerebral oxygen delivery—namely, those with a history of stroke, diabetes, or cerebrovascular disease. 86 These latter patients can tolerate a hematocrit as low as 18% when using moderate hypothermia.87 Once the patient is warm and being weaned from CPB, these percentage points are raised by 2% each (17% and 20%, respectively) because the relative protective effects of hypothermia are no longer present. In our institution, once the patient is off CPB, our practice is to reinfuse all (or as much as possible) remaining blood in the CPB circuit to the patient and then to give all available cell salvage blood, including any blood remaining in the CPB circuit that was not initially given back to the patient; next, any blood collected from ANH, and finally, PABD blood if available. Then and only then, if the hematocrit remains unsatisfactorily low, does the patient receive allogeneic blood. Of course, the issue becomes: what does "unsatisfactorily low" mean?

Unfortunately, data to support postoperative transfusion decisions in cardiac surgery are sparse. Since a given patient's unique clinical situation (eg, volume status, hemodynamics, surgical extent, ongoing bleeding, and mixed venous oxygen saturation) is likely the most important factor in weighing his or her need for transfusion, it would be impossible to assign a single transfusion trigger that can universally be applied to all patients. However, based upon the results of numerous case series, several nonrandomized observational studies, a handful of prospective randomized clinical trials, and expert opinions, consensus now exists that helps guide us in the transfusion decision-making process. 26,88

It is widely accepted (and as outlined by the current STS/SCA guidelines) that RBC transfusions to improve oxygen transport when a hemoglobin level is greater than 10 g/dL are almost never of benefit, whereas most patients with hemoglobin levels less than 7 g/dL do indeed stand to benefit from transfusion. <sup>26,88</sup> Two studies in particular formed much the basis for this understanding: in 1999, a multicenter randomized trial of Transfusion Requirements in Critical Care (TRICC) enrolled 838 critically ill patients and randomized them to either a restrictive (transfuse if hemoglobin < 7 g/dL)

or a liberal (transfuse if hemoglobin < 10 g/dL) transfusion strategy. <sup>89</sup> The 30-day mortality rates, though better in the restrictive strategy group, did not reach statistical significance; however, myocardial infarction and pulmonary edema occurred less frequently under the restrictive strategy. <sup>89</sup> A subgroup analysis, which looked at younger patients (age < 55) and patients who were less acutely ill (APACHE score < 20) showed significantly lower mortality rates with the restrictive strategy. <sup>89</sup> Patients with known, significant cardiac disease had comparable mortality rates regardless of the transfusion strategy used. <sup>89</sup>

A second, more recent randomized trial examined appropriate transfusion triggers in cardiac surgical procedures specifically: the Transfusion Requirements After Cardiac Surgery (TRACS) trial randomized 502 patients who had undergone cardiac surgical procedures with the use of CPB to restrictive (maintain hematocrit  $\geq 24\%$ ) versus liberal (maintain hematocrit  $\geq 30\%$ ) transfusion strategies. The primary, composite end point of 30-day mortality and in-hospital major morbidity was comparable between both strategies. In the restrictive strategy group, there was a 60% diminution in the number of transfused units. Furthermore, RBC transfusions were again found to be an independent risk factor for mortality.

The contemporary STS/SCA blood conservation guidelines therefore state RBC transfusion is reasonable when hemoglobin levels are below 6 g/dL, as they can be life-saving. <sup>26</sup> Moreover, transfusion is reasonable in most postoperative patients whose hemoglobin is less than 7 g/dL, even though little high level evidence supports this recommendation. <sup>26</sup>

### Point-of-Care Testing

Traditional laboratory-based testing of blood (eg, complete blood counts, coagulation profiles) helps guide rational transfusion practices. Yet, some of these assays may be limited by processing times that are quite long relative to the acuity of many postsurgical cardiac patients. Hence, various POC tests have been developed that seek to optimize and expedite patient management. The proposed advantages of POC testing include (1) the targeting of transfusion therapies according to specific coagulation abnormalities, (2) the rapid identification of patients who could benefit from pharmacologic therapy to decrease bleeding, and (3) the identification of a surgical source for excessive bleeding in the setting of normal test results.<sup>25</sup>

The use of thromboelastography (TEG) or rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) to assess whole-blood coagulation, platelet function, and fibrinolytic activity has gained popularity in cardiac surgery (Fig.14-2). However, as the recent ISMICS consensus statement points out, despite some evidence that TEG/thromboelastometry may reduce blood subcomponent transfusions, results have been largely heterogeneous and no benefits have been shown with respect to clinically relevant outcomes. As such, evidence remains too premature to recommend POC technologies for routine use in blood conservation following cardiac surgery.

FIGURE 14-2 Working principles of thromboelastography and rotational thromboelastometry.90 Thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) assess viscoelastic changes in clotting whole blood under low shear conditions after the addition of a specific coagulation activator to a sample of blood. The main end point of TEG and ROTEM is the determination of the blood's viscoelasticity, referred as amplitude (for TEG) and clot firmness (for ROTEM). Specifically, the viscoelastic (tensile) force between the blood-containing cup and the immersed pin results from the interaction between activated platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors and polymerizing fibrin during endogenous thrombin generation and fibrin degradation by fibrinolysis. In TEG (A), the cup holding the blood sample is rotating, whereas the torsion wire is fixed. In ROTEM (B), the cup is fixed, whereas the pin is rotating. Changes in torque are detected electromechanically in TEG and optically in ROTEM. The computer-processed signal is then presented as a tracing. (C) Shows typical tracings from TEG (lower tracing) and ROTEM (upper tracing). The time course of viscoelastic changes is depicted as additional parameters that reflect the rate and stability of clot formation; the values of these parameters can then guide clinical decision-making.

#### **Novel Blood Products**

Two newer, novel blood products—recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) and PCCs—have garnered considerable

attention but their roles in cardiac surgery and blood conservation may not yet be widely understood by practicing surgeons. We therefore close this chapter with brief discussions of these two products.

#### RECOMBINANT ACTIVATED FACTOR VII

Endogenous activated factor VII plays a central role in coagulation; rFVIIa is nearly identical to the endogenous form of this factor and works by both tissue-factor-dependent and—independent mechanisms to generate thrombin. 91 The rFVIIa is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the management of bleeding in patients with hemophilias A and B and in patients with congenital factor VII deficiency. The off-label use of rFVIIa in cardiac surgery has surged in recent years, where it is used to treat refractory intraoperative and/or postoperative hemorrhage.

However, the results of studies examining the use of this novel agent in cardiac surgery (mainly nonrandomized studies, case reports, and small case series) have been mixed. As such, a randomized controlled clinical trial was recently undertaken to assess the dose-escalating safety and efficacy of rFVIIa in postoperative cardiac surgical patients with refractory bleeding.<sup>92</sup> When used at either a low or high dose (40 or 80 μg/kg, respectively), rFVIIa was associated with significantly lower bleeding rates and allogeneic transfusions than was placebo. 92 The authors concluded that this therapy was effective for refractory bleeding but that the study was ultimately underpowered to speak to this blood product's safety profile.<sup>92</sup> A recent comprehensive review of 35 randomized clinical trials using rFVIIa for all off-label indications sought to address this question of safety and demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of arterial thrombotic events with rFVIIa versus placebo (5.5 vs 3.2%, respectively).<sup>93</sup>

Current blood conservation guidelines state that rFVIIa may be considered for the management of intractable non-surgical bleeding that is otherwise unresponsive to conventional hemostatic therapies. <sup>26,44</sup> Yet, the routine, prophylactic use of rFVIIa in cardiac surgery cannot be endorsed for reasons of cost, due limited data on its efficacy, and because of concerns for increased risk of serious adverse events with this blood product.

#### PROTHROMBIN COMPLEX CONCENTRATES

PCCs are plasma-derived concentrates of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (II, VII, IX, X, and proteins C and S); several PCC products are currently available. PCCs are useful for the rapid reversal of oral anticoagulants; in a randomized trial of cardiac surgical patients, PCC reversed oral anticoagulation safely, more quickly, and with decreased bleeding compared to reversal with FFP.94 PCCs are also beginning to be studied for the treatment of post-CPB coagulopathy and early results suggest that PCC use may decrease subsequent FFP and platelet transfusion requirements95—though these promising preliminary results have yet to be validated in larger, randomized controlled clinical trials.

#### **KEY POINTS**

- There is little evidence to support the routine, liberal use of blood transfusions in cardiac surgery.
- Comprehensive blood conservation programs are the most effective strategy in decreasing patients' exposures to allogeneic blood.
- Blood conservation should be approached in a multidisciplinary fashion using a team that includes members from surgery, anesthesiology, nursing, perfusion, blood banking, and quality improvement.
- Preoperative strategies for minimizing bleeding risks and transfusion requirements include: the identification of high-risk patients; appropriately stopping medications that contribute to coagulopathy; and increasing preoperative red cell mass with iron supplementation, erythropoietin, and/or PABD.
- The use of CPB techniques that reduce blood loss and protect against transfusions should be maximized—these include: ANH with the subsequent reinfusion of drained autologous blood, retrograde autologous priming, and the utilization of mini-circuits and modified UF.
- Antifibrinolytic drugs and topical hemostatic agents are important adjuncts to blood conservation.
- A patient's unique clinical situation, rather than rigid transfusion triggers, should guide postoperative blood utilization.
- The incorporation of new surgical techniques, novel agents and blood products, and evolving technologies into blood conservation programs must be based on evidence from well-designed clinical trials.
