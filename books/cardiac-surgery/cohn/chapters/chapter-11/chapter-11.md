### **CORONARY REVASCULARIZATION**

### Coronary Artery Disease, Surgical Revascularization, and Myocardial Oxygen Supply: Demand

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 600,000 fatalities annually. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a complex and multifactorial process, primarily characterized by the progressive and silent accumulation of atherosclerotic plaques, fibrous materials, and inflammatory mediators within the coronary arteries, potentially leading to obstruction of flow and resultant myocardial hypoperfusion.<sup>2</sup> Manifestations of this disease tend to present in males 40 years and older and in females 50 years and older. Risk factors include a strong family history of the disease, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and smoking. If left untreated, CAD can lead to angina, heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden death. Although medical therapy and percutaneous coronary interventions are often mainstay treatments for milder forms of the disease and most single- and double-vessel lesions, the gold standard for most multi-vessel lesions remains surgical revascularization.<sup>3,4</sup>

Anesthesiologists should be acutely aware of the heightened risks of myocardial ischemia for patients during revascularization surgery due to their obstructed coronary vessels and the critical dependence on oxidative phosphorylation for cardiac energy production. Myocardial oxygen supply is the product of arterial oxygen content and coronary blood flow.

O<sub>2</sub> content = [(1.34)(hemoglobin concentration)(% oxygen saturation) +  $(0.003)(PaO_{2})$ ]

Maximizing oxygen release at the tissue level involves maintaining high hemoglobin concentration, high oxygen saturation, warm temperature, and increased 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. The myocardium tends to maximally extract oxygen from its blood supply while at rest, and therefore, can only increase myocardial oxygen delivery during stress by increasing coronary blood flow. If this flow is obstructed by CAD, then the risk of myocardial ischemia is greatly increased.

Coronary artery blood flow is proportional to coronary perfusion pressure (CPP), where

CPP = (aortic diastolic blood pressure) – (left ventricular end-diastolic pressure)

and is inversely proportional to coronary vascular resistance. Normal coronary arteries have autoregulated flow at CPPs between 50 and 150 mm Hg. Coronary vascular resistance is determined by hormonal and metabolic factors, the autonomic nervous system, endothelial modulation, and in diseased vessels, by atherosclerotic plaques. Left ventricular (LV) endocardial blood flow occurs entirely during diastole, when the vast majority of the remaining myocardium is oxygenated (Fig. 11-1). Therefore, the anesthesiologist attempting to maximize CPP and oxygen supply should target normal to increased diastolic blood pressure, low left ventricular enddiastolic pressure (LVEDP), and a slow heart rate to maximize time during diastole. Additionally, myocardial oxygen demand can be minimized by avoiding tachycardia, minimizing LVEDP, reducing chamber size, and reducing contractility. This general principle of optimizing myocardial oxygen supply while minimizing demand should be an over-reaching goal for the anesthesiologist caring for a patient undergoing coronary revascularization surgery. 5,6

# **Preoperative Considerations**

When evaluating a patient prior to a coronary revascularization procedure, the anesthesiologist should be mindful of the anesthetic goals common to all surgeries: providing amnesia, analgesia, and a quiet surgical field while ensuring optimal myocardial oxygen supply and demand to minimize ischemic risk. In addition, the anesthesiologist should provide optimal hemodynamic control to optimize cardiac performance, and be prepared to help guide the surgery while rapidly diagnosing cardiac complications, often by using advanced noninvasive and invasive hemodynamic monitors including transesophageal echocardiography (TEE).

Initial preoperative patient assessment should include a comprehensive history and physical examination focused on

**FIGURE 11-1** Wiggers diagram depicting relationship of left coronary artery pressure and flow with the phase of the cardiac cycle. Note that left coronary flow occurs primarily during ventricular diastole, even though the head pressure of the vessel is higher during systole. This is due to the high transmural ventricular pressure during systole, and the relatively low pressure in diastole as the myocardium relaxes, as governed by the coronary perfusion equation: CPP=DBP-LVEDP, where CPP=coronary pressure, DBP=diastolic blood pressure, and LVEDP=left ventricular end diastolic pressure.

the cardiac and pulmonary systems, along with a standard airway examination. Though direct laryngoscopy is routinely used to facilitate tracheal intubation, a predicted difficult airway may prompt alternative intubation strategies. A thorough review of the medical record is in order, with careful attention to patient medications, laboratory studies (complete blood count, electrolytes, creatinine, troponin, B-type natriuretic peptide, coagulation panels, blood cross matches), electrocardiogram, carotid ultrasound studies, chest radiograph, cardiac stress tests, cardiac catheterization, and echocardiography reports. The anesthesiologist should be aware of the coronary anatomy and lesions, along with any invasive pressure measurements as described by the catheterization report. Close review of any preoperative echocardiography studies is essential to assess both systolic and diastolic ventricular function and to examine the cardiac valves.

A comprehensive preoperative assessment is important to determine the perioperative risk. The two most widely used risk stratification tools are the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Risk Calculator and EuroSCORE II, each based on large historical patient databases. These formulae use sophisticated mathematical modeling techniques to allow the user to

determine predicted mortality and other complications based on a variety of entered criteria, including age, gender, ejection fraction, urgency of surgery, renal function, and other variables. Risk assessment calculators can be valuable preoperative planning tools for the patient, surgeon, and anesthesiologist, and their use should be considered prior to each case.<sup>7,8</sup>

While concluding the preoperative visit, the anesthesiologist should ensure informed consent and provide the opportunity for any patient questions to be answered. The anesthesiologist's visit itself is a powerful means to allay patient fears and helps address patient and family members' concerns.9 Additionally, the anesthesiologist should consider any premedications to administer, include anxiolytics as necessary. Beta-blocker medications are recommended preoperatively to reduce the risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation, myocardial ischemia, and mortality. Statins should be administered unless contraindicated to reduce the rate of myocardial ischemia, graft atherosclerosis, and mortality. 10,11 In general, antihypertensives should be continued on the day of surgery, while use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists is associated with intraoperative hypotension and remains controversial. The use of antiplatelet and anticoagulation agents should be discussed with the surgeon.12

Finally, the anesthesiologist should have an active preoperative meeting with the surgeon and the surgical team, as necessary, in order to facilitate the procedure and minimize complications. Checklist and protocol-driven processes have demonstrated reduced complications and improved mortality. Cardiac anesthesiologists with formal fellowship training and skill in TEE are recommended to provide care for highrisk patients. 14

# Monitoring

A vigilant cardiac anesthesiologist is the best single monitor for patients undergoing revascularization procedures. Standard American Society of Anesthesiology monitors should also be used, including  ${\rm FiO}_2$  monitor, pulse oximeter, endtidal  ${\rm CO}_2$  monitor, continuous electrocardiogram, noninvasive blood pressure monitor, and a temperature measurement device. In addition to these standard monitors, a urinary catheter often with bladder thermistor, an arterial catheter most commonly placed in the radial artery, and a central venous catheter are all used routinely. Central venous catheter placement using real-time ultrasound guidance is safer than using an anatomic-guided approach, and is the recommended technique when available.  $^{15}$ 

The risk of intraoperative awareness is increased during cardiac surgery due to the lower use of volatile anesthetics and increased hemodynamic instability in comparison to non-cardiac surgery. Processed electroencephalograms, such as the bispectral index (BIS) monitor, have been used to detect inadequate patient amnesia with recent meta-analysis data suggesting that their use reduces the risk of intraoperative awareness in high-risk patients with an odds ratio of 0.24. Although this risk reduction is not universally found.

the use of the BIS remains controversial, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommends "the use of electroencephalography-based depth of anesthesia monitors…during any type of general anesthesia in patients considered at higher risk." <sup>19</sup>

The technique of near-infrared spectroscopy allows for cerebral regional oxygen saturation to be measured using skin sensors placed on the scalp. Low cerebral tissue oxygen values are associated with increased long-term surgical risk and can also detect cerebral hypoperfusion states caused by problems with bypass cannulae, emboli, and obstruction of cerebral vessels. Cerebral oximetry is often used with aortic surgery involving circulatory arrest, and less commonly with isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedures.<sup>20</sup> Cerebral oximetry has yet to be clearly demonstrated to be beneficial in high-quality randomized intervention trials, and its use remains controversial.<sup>21,22</sup>

The pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) is frequently used during revascularization procedures as a means of measuring cardiac output via thermodilution and directly measuring pulmonary artery pressures. Additionally, LVEDP, as a marker of LV preload, can often be inferred from the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure or the pulmonary artery diastolic pressure. The use of a PAC is not without risk however, and it has been associated with rare but often lethal complications including pulmonary artery rupture. PAC use for revascularization surgery became widespread by the 1980s but its current use is declining due to the proliferation of less-invasive cardiac output monitoring devices, TEE, and some data which fails to demonstrate an association with improved outcome. 23,24 Even so, PACs remain popular with more than two-thirds of anesthesiologists reporting that they use this catheter more than 75% of the time in cases requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).<sup>25</sup> The perioperative use of a PAC remains recommended in patients with cardiogenic shock (Class I indication), hemodynamic instability (Class IIa), and its use may be reasonable in stable patients undergoing revascularization procedures (Class IIb).26

TEE has become a routine monitor during cardiac surgery, and has been shown to have a significant favorable influence on intraoperative surgical management and outcomes.<sup>27</sup> Current practice guidelines recommend that unless contraindicated, TEE be used for all valvular heart procedures and should be considered in CABG surgeries.<sup>28</sup> Recent global survey data suggest that TEE is used in 61 to 69% of isolated CABG procedures.<sup>29</sup> In addition to serving as the gold standard for valve evaluation, TEE can be used to monitor volume status, ventricular function, and gauge regional-wall motion patterns to detect and assess myocardial ischemia—all useful assessments during revascularization surgery.<sup>29</sup>

# **Anesthetic Techniques and Agents**

Historically, general anesthesia was commonly induced and maintained with high-dose fentanyl (50 to 100 mcg/kg) and pancuronium (Table 11-1). This high-dose opiate technique purportedly avoided myocardial depression associated with

other anesthetic agents while providing stable hemodynamics and effective blunting of surgical stresses.<sup>30</sup> In the 1990s, efforts at cost reduction spurred the evolution of "fast-track" cardiac anesthetic techniques using volatile anesthetics and low-dose opiates, with early extubation and reducing ICU stays as primary goals. Fast-track techniques have subsequently been demonstrated to be as safe as historical anesthetics in low- and medium-risk patients.<sup>31</sup> Around the same time, the concept of ischemic and pharmacological preconditioning was described, whereby certain maneuvers or pharmacologic agents including volatile anesthetics could minimize the extent of myocardial damage to subsequent myocardial ischemia.<sup>32</sup> As a result, contemporary approaches to coronary revascularization surgery commonly involve induction with thiopental, propofol, etomidate, or midazolam, followed by a balanced anesthetic technique employing a volatile anesthetic (ie, isoflurane, desflurane, or sevoflurane) as its primary component. The volatile anesthetic is accompanied by a low-dose semisynthetic opiate (ie, fentanyl, sufentanil, or remifentanil) and a paralyzing agent. There is no significant difference in extubation times between fentanyl, sufentanil, and remifentanil using fast-track protocols.33 The use of a volatile anesthetic, and therefore induction of pharmacologic preconditioning, has now become a more common standard anesthetic approach. Meta-analyses suggest that cardiac surgery mortality is reduced when using a volatile anesthetic as compared to a propofol-based intravenous anesthetic, with an odds ratio of 0.51 in favor of volatile anesthetics.<sup>34</sup> Xenon is a promising inhalational anesthetic agent that purports to improve recovery from myocardial stunning, preserve hemodynamic control, and provide neuroprotective qualities. Early trials have been favorable, but its use remains experimental.<sup>35</sup>

Neuroaxial techniques are occasionally used during revascularization surgery. However, systemic heparinization increases the concern of epidural hematoma and resultant spinal cord injury thereby limiting their use, although the actual incidence of this complication is very low.<sup>36</sup> Preoperative intrathecal opiate injection and continuous thoracic epidural local anesthetics can provide good analgesia and facilitate recovery; however, current data do not demonstrate a reduction in the risk of mortality, myocardial infarction, or neurological complications as compared to general anesthetic alone.<sup>37</sup> Awake cardiac surgery is performed in a very small number of centers using thoracic epidural anesthesia and may offer rapid recovery benefits in select patients.<sup>38</sup>

# Hemodynamic Optimization

Patients undergoing coronary revascularization frequently develop hypotension and/or low cardiac output, particularly following CPB. Risk factors for low cardiac output syndrome include renal disease, significant regional-wall motion abnormalities, CABG with mitral valve (MV) surgery, reoperation, moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation (MR), prolonged aortic cross clamp time, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 40%, cardiac index < 2.5 L/min/m², and LVEDP  $\geq$  20 mm Hg.<sup>39,40</sup> Strict attention to

hemodynamic monitors coupled with a command of cardiac physiology and pharmacology will aid the anesthesiologist in maintaining adequate systemic perfusion. Markers of inadequate systemic perfusion include low cardiac index, hypotension, oliguria, metabolic acidosis, increased base deficit, and elevated serum lactate.

The anesthesiologist is tasked with preventing, diagnosing, and treating inadequate systemic perfusion, and implementing an algorithmic approach may help direct therapy (Fig. 11-2). By using a combination of traditional hemodynamic monitors, invasive and noninvasive cardiac output

monitoring devices, dynamic indexes, changes in end-tidal carbon dioxide, arterial blood gas analysis, and echocardiography, systemic perfusion can be assessed and treatment adjusted. A number of vasoactive medications are available and their use should be individualized based on each patient's hemodynamic needs (Table 11-2). A recent addition is levosimendan, a novel inotrope that increases troponin C affinity to calcium without increasing myocardial oxygen consumption or impairing ventricular relaxation, while also exerting pharmacologic preconditioning effects by opening mitochondrial K<sub>ATP</sub> channels.

is recommended for treatment of acute heart failure in Europe<sup>41</sup> and has shown mortality benefits when compared to dobutamine, but is not yet available in the United States. If after optimizing volume status and maximizing pharmacologic support the patient remains hypoperfused, then mechanical assist devices should be considered.<sup>42</sup> The intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) is well established and technically easiest to place; however its efficacy has been recently questioned.<sup>43</sup> In centers trained in their use, ventricular assist devices (VAD) and extra-corporeal membranous oxygenators (ECMO) may confer a survival benefit and should be considered.

### **Overview of Procedural Considerations**

The anesthetic care of a patient undergoing CABG is a complex, multi-step process. After the anesthesiologist completes a thorough preoperative evaluation, a large bore peripheral IV is placed followed by an arterial catheter, usually placed in the radial artery. Anxiolytics are routinely administered in

the preoperative area. In the operating room, standard ASA monitors are applied, and intravenous induction and tracheal intubation are performed, most commonly with a fast-track approach (Table 11-1), targeting early extubation unless contraindicated. A central venous catheter is then placed if not placed prior to induction, often with PAC. Then, the patient is positioned and draped for surgery while a TEE is performed and results are discussed with the surgeon. Prior to incision, an antifibrinolytic is commonly administered (eg, aminocaproic acid, tranexamic acid) to reduce perioperative bleeding. Antibiotics (typically vancomycin and cefuroxime) are given as infection prophylaxis. Anesthetic depth is adjusted to match changes in surgical stimulation with attention to hemodynamic control and myocardial oxygen supply/demand optimization. Heparin is administered several minutes prior to bypass cannulae placement (usually 300 to 400 units/kg), and its effect confirmed by measuring an activated clotting time (ACT) value of 480 seconds or greater prior to initiating bypass. Inadequate ACT values must prompt action by the anesthesiologist to determine the cause and achieve proper

anticoagulation before initiating CPB. The surgeon and perfusionist should be kept notified of the ACT values and any difficulties in anticoagulation. Heparin resistance may require treatment with fresh frozen plasma or antithrombin III concentrate to achieve adequate heparin effect.

After heparinization, the surgeon places an arterial cannula and a venous cannula. Upon initiation of CPB, mechanical ventilation is stopped, the heart is arrested, and revascularization is performed. During this time, volatile anesthetic is typically administered via the bypass circuit by the perfusionist under the anesthesiologist's and surgeon's direction. ACT, hematocrit, arterial blood gases, and blood sugar should be checked periodically during CPB, and any aberrations treated. Serum glucose levels > 180 mg/dL should be treated with insulin infusion.

After the revascularization is complete, the patient should be weaned from bypass. The anesthesiologist should anticipate bypass separation and be prepared, following a standardized routine. Separation preparation steps include: ensuring function of intravascular catheters, ensuring adequate depth of anesthesia, assessing for intracardiac air with TEE, ensuring that core temperature ≥ 36°C, performing a lung recruitment maneuver, and resuming normal ventilation. Establishing an adequate cardiac rhythm and rate, generally 80 to 100 beats per minute may require a pacemaker. Normalizing electrolytes, treating anemia, and preparing vasoactive medications are also important considerations. Though most patients will have adequate cardiac function with a ventricular pacemaker lead, some patients dependent on active atrial contraction for ventricular filling (eg, severe diastolic dysfunction) will require atrial pacing. Biventricular pacing may improve cardiac output to a small degree, which may be clinically important in patients with severe cardiac dysfunction. The actual process of separation requires intense focus and frequent communication amongst the surgeon, anesthesiologist, and perfusionist, and therefore should be conducted in a quiet, "sterile cockpit" environment.44

Once the anesthesiologist, surgeon, and perfusionist are prepared to wean from CPB, the anesthesiologist should work to ensure systemic perfusion and cardiac performance by optimizing heart rate and rhythm, infusing volume from the CPB machine to achieve normovolemia, adjusting afterload with vasodilators or vasopressors as necessary, and optimizing contractility with inotropes as needed. This dynamic process occurs while gradually reducing CPB machine flows to minimal support, at which point cardiac function is reassessed, and then pump flow is stopped completely. If cardiac function is not adequate, then steps to correct this are taken prior to separation.

Immediately after separation, the heart is assessed for adequate function, particularly for markers of ischemia (eg, wall motion abnormalities, worsened ventricular function, inadequate graft flow), valvular abnormalities, and for preload, afterload, and contractility. Frequently, adjustments in volume therapy and vasoactive medicines are made, guided primarily by TEE and hemodynamic monitors. After achieving sufficient hemodynamic parameters generally targeting SBP

100 to 120 mm Hg, and a CI  $\geq$  2.2 L/min/m<sup>2</sup>, protamine is slowly given prior to the bypass cannulae being removed.

Following separation, the anesthesiologist must remain vigilant and continue to control and optimize patient hemodynamics. Hemostasis should be assessed by examining the surgical field, measuring ACT and heparin concentration, and in certain cases with thromboelastography. Cardiac output should be measured again after chest closure and support adjusted as necessary. Transfer to the ICU should conclude with a detailed, clear handoff to the ICU team in order to minimize communication failures.

Surgical coronary revascularization can also be performed on a beating heart without CPB, and is termed "off-pump" coronary artery bypass (OPCAB). OPCAB typically utilizes a heart stabilization device that isolates a localized region of surgical interest immobile while allowing the rest of the heart to beat. OPCAB became popularized in the late 1990s and early 2000s, eventually becoming the surgical approach for nearly one-third of coronary revascularizations in the United States. OPCAB purported to reduce the surgical inflammatory stress response, mortality, stroke, cognitive dysfunction, and kidney injury. However, recent meta-analyses suggest that there is no significant difference in cognitive dysfunction between OPCAB and CABG,45 and that all-cause mortality in OPCAB (3.7%) was slightly higher than CABG (3.1%).<sup>46</sup> Furthermore, the need for subsequent revascularization may be higher in OPCAB.<sup>47</sup> As a result, the use of beating heart techniques in the United States is declining.

The OPCAB lends itself to fast-track anesthetic regimens, and in some centers, this is augmented with thoracic epidural analgesia. Heparinization protocols for OPCAB are variable, though many surgeons target ACT values of 300 seconds. Ischemic preconditioning techniques should definitely be considered, given that transient ischemia is likely during the grafting procedure. Surgical exposure may lead to marked alterations in the heart's position within the chest, potentially dramatically impacting cardiac output. The anesthesiologist should be prepared to monitor systemic perfusion most commonly with TEE and continuous cardiac output monitors, and treat hypoperfusion with volume and inotropes as necessary. Occasionally, despite hemodynamic optimization, adequate perfusion cannot be maintained, necessitating conversion to an on-pump procedure. As a result, a perfusionist and CPB machine should be available during OPCAB.

Minimally invasive approaches to coronary revascularization, either on- or off-pump are becoming more common, and involve either a shorter sternotomy incision or any of various small thoracotomies for access to the coronary arteries. Robotic-assisted techniques allow for remote surgical access via small incisions or ports into the chest cavity. The anesthesiologist must communicate with the surgeon preoperatively to discuss the operative strategy and plan accordingly. Often, lung isolation with a double-lumen endotracheal tube or bronchial blocker facilitates surgical visualization. Anesthesiologists should also be prepared to aggressively avoid hypothermia and ensure that external defibrillator pads are placed due to the limited direct access to the heart. 48

#### **VALVE SURGERY**

The perioperative care of patients with valvular heart disease creates a considerable challenge for anesthesiologists, surgeons, and intensivists. A great deal of challenge stems from the wide diversity of pathophysiologic derangements found in these patients. This diversity can, in part, be appreciated by comparing representative LV pressure-volume loops for the different left-sided valvular lesions (Fig. 11-3). Clearly, there are significant and important distinctions in end-diastolic LV volume, intracavitary pressure, and stroke volume. However, not only do the major valvular lesions differ from one another in terms of adaptive ventricular responses and hemodynamic profiles, but patients with the same valvular lesion may present with entirely different degrees of symptomatology and hemodynamic compromise depending on the clinical situation and time course over which the valve pathology develops. Again, LV pressure-volume loops illustrate this concept. The patient who develops acute, severe aortic regurgitation (AR) due to endocarditis will present with notably different LV filling volumes and pressures when compared to a patient with a similar regurgitant fraction whose AR develops gradually due to progressive aortic root dilatation (Fig. 11-4). Clinical management must be appropriately adapted.

Another complicating factor in the management of patients with valvular heart disease is the frequent occurrence of multiple valvular lesions in the same patient. General hemodynamic goals for patients with left-sided valve pathology can be easily summarized (Table 11-3). However, not uncommonly, two valve lesions coexist in which hemodynamic goals are opposite. For example, selecting an ideal heart rate for the patient with aortic stenosis (AS) becomes more difficult in the setting of concomitant MR. In these situations, the physician either determines which lesion contributes most to the patient's symptoms, signs, and hemodynamic profile or

**FIGURE 11-4** Representative left ventricular pressure-volume loops comparing a normal ventricle (black) to a patient with acute aortic regurgitation (orange) and chronic aortic regurgitation (purple).

chooses a management strategy that represents a compromise between competing goals.

Although the spectrum of valvular heart disease encompasses a wide variety of hemodynamic findings and adaptive ventricular responses, the natural history of many valve disorders often follows a similar general course. During the initial development of valvular stenosis or regurgitation, the patient remains asymptomatic. Ventricular remodeling serves to normalize indices such as wall tension or stroke volume. Atrial enlargement may mitigate increases in pulmonary or systemic venous pressure. Eventually, following a variable latent period, adaptive responses fail leading to the elevation of cardiac filling pressures, exhaustion of preload reserve, and declining cardiac output. Signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF) develop or evidence of ventricular dysfunction manifests during imaging studies prompting surgical intervention. The optimal timing of surgical intervention for valvular heart disease continues to evolve, guided by clinical investigations and expert consensus. 49

#### **Aortic Stenosis**

Aortic stenosis represents the most common valve disorder in the United States.<sup>50</sup> Two reasons help explain this observation. First, a congenital bicuspid aortic valve (AV), which has an increased tendency to become stenotic over time, is found in 1 to 2% of the population. Second, risk factors for degenerative calcification of a trileaflet AV such as hyperlipidemia,

![](_page_7_Figure_13.jpeg)

hypertension, smoking, and advanced age are also common. Obstruction to outflow creates abnormal systolic pressure (P) within the LV cavity, which in turn, increases wall tension (T) according to the law of Laplace:

$$T = \frac{PR}{2h}$$

where R represents the radius of the ventricular cavity and h represents myocardial wall thickness. Increases in wall thickness by the process of concentric myocyte hypertrophy serve to normalize wall tension, although this remodeling invariably leads to diastolic dysfunction and creates the setting for oxygen supply and demand mismatch. Thus both LV outflow restriction and the pathophysiology of concentric hypertrophy guide perioperative management. For example, tachycardia is particularly deleterious. Increased heart rates disproportionately encroach on diastolic filling and coronary perfusion time in a ventricle where myocardial relaxation is delayed. At the same time, tachycardia increases myocardial oxygen consumption. Elevated end-diastolic pressures in an LV with reduced compliance limit coronary perfusion to subendocardial regions of the hypertrophied myocardium. Reduced LV compliance also makes the LV more dependent on atrial contraction for diastolic filling and atrial fibrillation may be poorly tolerated. Synchronized cardioversion should be employed early in the patient with severe AS who develops atrial fibrillation with signs of low cardiac output.

The anesthesiologist must consider the pathophysiology of outflow obstruction as well as consequences of concentric LV hypertrophy when selecting a perioperative management plan. Since patients with severe AS are very sensitive to anestheticinduced decreases in preload and afterload, an arterial line is often placed prior to induction to allow early recognition of blood pressure changes and response to treatment. The choice of induction agent is probably not as important as adherence to key hemodynamic goals that include the maintenance of preload and afterload along with a heart rate in the low to normal range. Hypotension is treated promptly, usually with an α-adrenergic agonist. Opioids such as fentanyl are often included in a balanced anesthetic induction and maintenance regimen since they tend to lower heart rate and minimally impact myocardial contractility. High-dose opioid anesthetic regimens, more popular in preceding decades, provide hemodynamic stability but may hamper early postoperative extubation. Drugs that increase heart rate, such as ketamine or pancuronium, should be used cautiously or in conjunction with vagotonic agents such as opioids. However, while avoidance of tachycardia represents an important perioperative goal, anesthesiologists must also avoid severe bradycardia.<sup>51</sup> In patients with AS, flow across the AV limited and cardiac output declines with heart rates less than 50 beats per minute. When treating bradycardia, drugs such as β-adrenergic agonists or anticholinergics should be titrated carefully to avoid overshoot and the development of tachycardia.<sup>51</sup> Atrial or atrio-ventricular pacing represents an attractive option for

the cardiac surgical patient since it allows precise titration of heart rate.

In addition to an arterial line, central venous access along with a PAC is generally selected for patient undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR). Central venous access is desirable for the administration of vasoactive medications although central venous pressure (CVP) does not accurately reflect LV filling pressures in patients with severe AS. Likewise, the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) also does not provide a reliable assessment of LV filling in the setting of AS and reduced ventricular compliance. Measuring end-diastolic LV cavity area with TEE provides a more accurate reflection of preload compared with PAC-derived measurements.<sup>51</sup> Nonetheless, despite the limited ability to assess preload and the small risk of arrhythmia during insertion, the PAC offers several advantages including the opportunity to track cardiac output, measure pulmonary artery (PA) pressure, and serve as a conduit for a temporary pacing wire.

### **Aortic Regurgitation**

Aortic regurgitation (AR) leads to significant volume overloading of the LV and when chronic, the pressure-volume loop shifts farther to the right than for any other valvular lesion (Fig. 11-3). The eccentric LV hypertrophy and chamber dilatation that develop in the setting of chronic AR serve to normalize wall tension and accommodate very large end-diastolic volumes without significant increases in enddiastolic pressure. Patients may remain asymptomatic for years, though eventually compensatory changes are exhausted and in the face of progressively larger ventricular volumes, LV systolic function declines. In cases of acute severe AR, compensatory LV changes are not present. End-diastolic pressure rises quickly and may reach aortic diastolic pressure. In such cases, the combination of a low aortic diastolic pressure and a high LV end-diastolic pressure limit CPP, creating the potential for ischemia.

The hemodynamic goals for patients with severe AR differ from those used to manage AS patients. When the regurgitant fractions exceed 60%, maintenance of cardiac output requires an increase in heart rate.<sup>51</sup> A faster heart rate also reduces the diastolic period available for regurgitant flow into the LV. Avoidance of opioid-induced bradycardia along with the use of a muscle relaxant that increases heart rate such as pancuronium may prove useful. A reduction in afterload promotes forward flow. Propofol, which reduces afterload and displays minimal effects on myocardial contractility at usual clinical doses, represents a reasonable option for the induction of anesthesia.<sup>52</sup> Additional afterload reduction in the form of vasodilators such as sodium nitroprusside may be selected. Because the LV may be severely dilated and LV systolic may be depressed even in asymptomatic patients,<sup>51</sup> inotropic support should be readily available. Agents with β-adrenergic agonist activity, such as dobutamine along with phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as milrinone, increase myocardial contractility while favoring a reduction in afterload.

The hemodynamic monitors chosen for patients with severe AR undergoing AVR are similar to those selected for patients with AS. Intra-arterial pressure monitoring, central venous cannulation, and PAC placement are generally used together with intraoperative TEE. As in the case of AS, the measurement of PCWP may not accurately reflect LV filling, particularly in the case of severe, acute AR where the rapid rise of LV end-diastolic pressure may promote closure of the MV in late diastole. However, many anesthesiologists find the ability to obtain serial measurements of cardiac output to be beneficial. Furthermore, a PAC provides an easy route by which a pacing lead may be placed prior to sternal opening, facilitating the maintenance of an elevated heart rate.

#### Mitral Stenosis

Rheumatic disease accounts for most cases of acquired mitral stenosis (MS) in developed countries. Patients with rheumatic MV disease may remain asymptomatic for many years as the left atrium (LA) progressively dilates. Symptoms develop when severe MS limits LV filling and cardiac output. Alternatively, patients with moderate MS may become symptomatic during periods of increased transvalvular flow such as pregnancy or conditions associated with tachycardia. As shown in the simplified Gorlin equation, for a given valve area, when transvalvular flow increases, the pressure gradient also rises.

Valve area = 
$$\frac{\text{Flow}}{\sqrt{\text{Pressure gradient}}}$$

Rising LA pressure promotes pulmonary venous congestion and leads to feelings of dyspnea. Over time, pulmonary hypertension develops which may, in turn, lead to right ventricular (RV) enlargement, RV systolic dysfunction, and functional tricuspid regurgitation (TR). A major goal in the perioperative care of patients with severe MS is the identification and quantification of RV impairment.

The anesthetic management of patients with severe MS undergoing MV replacement is guided by several principles. First, tachycardia, which shortens diastolic LV filling time and increases LA pressure, should be treated promptly. The judicious use of preoperative sedation may ameliorate anxiety-induced tachycardia although excess sedation promotes hypoventilation with the attendant risk of increased pulmonary vascular resistance. A number of different agents may be chosen to reduce heart rate including calcium channel blockers, β-blockers, or amiodarone. Atrial fibrillation is commonly found in patients in this patient group and is generally tolerated provided the ventricular rate is controlled. Therefore, unlike patients with severe AS who develop atrial fibrillation, the immediate focus in patients with MS should be to maintain a low to normal ventricular rate rather than conversion to sinus rhythm. Second, because LV filling is already impaired by the stenotic MV, additional reductions in preload caused by anesthesia or blood loss should be carefully corrected. Vasodilation resulting from inhaled or intravenous anesthetics may be treated with incremental doses of an α-adrenergic agonist or vasopressin, ideally while monitoring PA pressures. Surgical blood loss should be replaced though overly zealous fluid administration should be avoided to prevent pulmonary vascular congestion and further RV impairment. While the PCWP does not reflect LV end-diastolic pressures in the setting of severe MS, display of PA pressures and serial measurement of cardiac output may be useful in guiding fluid administration. A third principle in the management of these patients involves control of PA pressures and augmentation of the RV systolic function. Because of the aforementioned need to maintain preload, the use of systemic vasodilators, though they may reduce PA pressure, may be poorly tolerated in this group. Instead, a select pulmonary vasodilator such as inhaled prostaglandin or nitric oxide should be considered for those with pulmonary hypertension and RV dysfunction. Additionally, arterial blood gas management is essential. The avoidance of hypoxia together with mild hyperventilation, combine to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance.

Following MVR with normalization of left-sided preload, LV systolic performance is expected to improve. However in a subset of patients, LV systolic performance may be impaired following valve replacement. Possible causes include rheumatic endocarditis or an unfavorable position of the ventricular septum in the setting of pulmonary hypertension and RV enlargement. Intraoperative TEE readily detects abnormalities of ventricular septal position and RV dysfunction in addition to providing a qualitative and quantitative assessment of LV systolic performance. Inotropic support may be required.

## Mitral Regurgitation

Mitral regurgitation shares some similarities with AR. Both conditions increase the preload of the LV and over time, eccentric hypertrophy develops. Like those with AR, patients with MR may remain asymptomatic for long periods. Similar to AR patients, those with MR present for surgery with a spectrum of clinical and imaging findings. The patient with MV prolapse who is followed with serial echocardiograms over a decade differs in important ways from the patient with acute, severe MR due to papillary muscle rupture. The former may well remain asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic and be referred for surgery due to abnormalities in LV size or function, while the latter is likely to present in heart failure with florid pulmonary edema and require intra-aortic balloon pump support preoperatively.

In patients with chronic MR, the contractile appearance of the LV in MR patients often improves initially in response to preload augmentation according to the Frank-Starling principle. Furthermore, the ejection of large quantities of blood into the low pressure LA leads to increases in the calculated ejection fraction although forward cardiac output may decline. An LVEF < 60% identifies reduced systolic performance in patients with severe MR and represents an indication for surgery. Physicians have also recognized that an early decline in LVEF following MV surgery for MR is common. Although sometimes considered an inevitable consequence of MV surgery for MR, significant reductions

243

in LV function postoperatively associated with an ejection fraction < 40% may identify a group at increased risk for premature death.<sup>54</sup> Several reasons have been postulated to explain reduced LV systolic performance following MV surgery, including reduced preload and ischemic cross-clamp injury<sup>55</sup> as well as unrecognized, preexisting systolic dysfunction.<sup>54</sup> Impaired preoperative LV systolic impairment may be underappreciated by echocardiography.<sup>56</sup> Several risk factors identify patients with MR who are at increased risk for low ejection fraction following mitral surgery, including preoperative pulmonary hypertension, preoperative atrial fibrillation, and a preoperative LV end-systolic diameter > 36 mm which confers a 6.5-fold increased risk of having a postoperative LVEF < 40%. 54,55 By assessing preoperative risks factors, anesthesiologists and surgeons can better prepare for the possible use of pharmacologic and mechanical circulatory support after MV surgery. Inotropic agents such as epinephrine and milrinone should be available. Early consideration should be given to placement of an IABP if hemodynamic compromise is refractory to drug therapy.

Hemodynamic goals for patients with severe MR include a reduction in the regurgitant fraction with augmentation of forward flow. For those patients with longstanding MR and pulmonary hypertension, support of the RV is also important. Providing that LV systolic function is not severely impaired, most patients tolerate an intravenous induction of anesthesia. Agents such as propofol reduce afterload and promote forward flow. Bradycardia is avoided since lower heart rates facilitate greater LV filling and distention. Inhalation agents are good choices for the maintenance of anesthesia as they also provide vasodilatation and may increase heart rate slightly. In patients with chronic MR, the LA is usually dilated. Atrial fibrillation may be present but is generally well tolerated since LV filling is unimpeded.

# Robotic and Minimally Invasive Mitral Valve Surgery

The popularity of robotic and other minimally invasive approaches to MV surgery continues to grow. Advantages of these approaches include reduced time to extubation, shortened hospital length of stay, lower blood product transfusion rates, and improved postoperative respiratory function. <sup>57,58</sup> The use of robotic and minimally invasive techniques necessitates changes in anesthetic management. These changes include the need for one-lung ventilation, the percutaneous placement of cannulae for CPB and retrograde cardioplegia, the expanded use of TEE (Table 11-4), and altered strategies for defibrillation. Smaller incisions and reduced need for opioid medications also create the potential for more rapid extubation and the expanded use of regional anesthesia.

Both thoracoscopic and robotic mitral repair utilize a small working incision and additional port access in the right chest. This approach requires deflation of the right lung. Either a double-lumen endotracheal tube or a bronchial blocker may be used to facilitate the operation. <sup>59</sup> Oxygen desaturation associated with one-lung ventilation is particularly problematic

following CPB and may be treated by the application of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to the nonventilated right lung, the use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) with the left lung, or intermittent two-lung ventilation.<sup>60</sup>

Cannulation for CPB for these operations usually consists of femoral arterial and venous access with or without supplementary venous drainage in the form of a vent line in the pulmonary artery or a superior vena cava cannula placed percutaneously from the right internal jugular vein. Surgeon preference and institutional experience guide the cannulation strategy. Intraoperative TEE is used to verify the position of the guidewire and femoral venous cannula. Inadvertent placement of a femoral venous guidewire across a patent foramen ovale is possible and should prompt redirection (Fig. 11-5). Supplementary venous drainage from the main pulmonary artery can be accomplished by means of a specialized endovent, the tip of which should be located in the main PA, near the bifurcation (Fig. 11-6A). Again, intraoperative TEE is used to ensure proper placement. TEE imaging can be difficult in these cases requiring the placement of multiple lines in the right heart (Fig. 11-6B).

Aortic cross clamping and cardioplegia administration can be accomplished by several different mechanisms. An endoaortic balloon may be advanced from the femoral artery into the ascending aorta where inflation serves to isolate the aortic root and facilitate antegrade cardioplegia delivery from the end of the delivery catheter. A percutaneous coronary sinus catheter may also be placed via the right internal jugular vein using TEE or fluoroscopic guidance to allow for the administration of retrograde cardioplegia. Lastly, an antegrade cardioplegia and vent line may be placed via a parasternal stab incision, a strategy similar to many open cardiac operations (Fig. 11-7A). In this last scenario, a long transthoracic aortic cross-clamp is used via a small lateral thoracic incision. The position of this cardioplegia line (Fig. 11-7B) and subsequent cardioplegia delivery (Fig. 11-7C) can be monitored with TEE.

Small incisions preclude the use of internal paddles for defibrillation and cardioversion in robotic MV surgery. Instead, external patches are applied in an anterior-posterior orientation on the left chest. <sup>61</sup> Should defibrillation prove difficult,

**FIGURE 11-5** Transesophageal echocardiographic images showing a guidewire inserted via the femoral vein crossing a patent foramen ovale (A) before being redirected into the superior vena cava (B).

consideration should be given to inflating the right lung to improve electrical impedance.<sup>59</sup>

Minimally invasive mitral surgery facilitates rapid extubation, particularly when regional anesthesia is used. <sup>57</sup> Multiple regional anesthetic techniques have been used in these cases including intrathecal opioid administration, intercostal nerve block, and paravertebral nerve block. The use of preoperative paravertebral nerve block together with a limited opioid dosing strategy was shown to facilitate extubation in the operating room following robotic mitral repair in approximately 90% of cases in one study. <sup>57</sup>

# **Tricuspid Regurgitation**

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) found in patients presenting for cardiac surgery is most often functional in nature and occurs secondary to left-sided valve disease, pulmonary

hypertension, or RV dysfunction. As such, the anesthetic management of these patients is usually dictated by the primary condition. However, patients may present with TR due to isolated, organic tricuspid valve (TV) disease. Examples include endocarditis, carcinoid valvulopathy, trauma, or pacemaker-induced valve dysfunction.

General hemodynamic goals for patients with severe TR include support of RV contractility, maintenance of a mildly elevated heart rate, and reduction of RV afterload by reducing pulmonary vascular resistance. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as milrinone may augment RV contractility while reducing RV afterload. Dobutamine and isoproterenol represent other possible options. As in cases of pulmonary hypertension or RV systolic dysfunction, careful attention to arterial blood gas values provides an important nonpharmacologic means by which the anesthesiologist can manipulate pulmonary vascular resistance.

In addition to direct arterial pressure monitoring, CVP monitoring is nearly always used for patients undergoing TV surgery even though CVP is a poor indicator of RV filling in the setting of severe TR. Although it may be difficult to advance in the face of severe TR, consideration can be given to PAC placement especially if TV repair or replacement with a tissue prosthesis is contemplated. A PAC facilitates assessment of pulmonary vascular resistance and thermodilutional cardiac output measurement becomes more feasible following TV surgery. The measurement of cardiac output by arterial waveform analysis provides the anesthesiologist with a reasonable alternative to placement of a PAC. These devices can be connected to any invasive arterial monitoring line. Early comparative studies with thermodilutional techniques were disappointing though the updated software in newer models may deliver more robust results.<sup>62,63</sup> The use of TEE can be invaluable in assessing not only valvular pathology but RV function as well. An additional important use of TEE in isolated TV surgery is the identification of intracardiac shunts since in the absence of shunting, CPB without a cross clamp becomes feasible.

#### THORACIC AORTIC SURGERY

The spectrum of diseases of the thoracic aorta may be classified according to pathology, etiology, timing, clinical presentation, location, and management options. <sup>64-66</sup> Thorough preoperative assessment including a comprehensive history and physical exam, review of preoperative imaging studies, and patient stability all play a role in determining whether the patient can be treated medically with continued surveillance, or surgically with definitive intervention. <sup>64-66</sup> When surgery is warranted, the urgency and planned surgical approach to repair significantly influence the anesthetic plan. Factors such as the cannulation strategy for CPB, the need for temporary cessation of blood flow, and anticipated methods for organ protection determine the optimal anesthetic technique and monitoring

choices during thoracic aortic surgery. While routine monitoring involved in all cardiac surgery patients applies to aortic surgery as well, the anesthesiologist must further individualize management to the patient's disease and the surgeon's operative approach. Hemodynamic goals, especially blood pressure management, can be significantly different from those of the cardiac surgical patient presenting for nonaortic surgery. Maintaining organ perfusion and protecting major organs, specifically those subjected to periods of ischemia, is crucial in allowing for optimal outcomes. Additional monitoring to detect and treat end-organ ischemia is another factor in procedural success. Furthermore, complex thoracic aortic surgery associated with prolonged procedure times and hypothermia frequently results in postoperative coagulopathy that can be effectively managed with anticipation of bleeding and

transfusion requirements. In addition, reliance on intraoperative TEE in guiding the operation, managing isolated single-lung ventilation to allow for adequate surgical exposure, and placement of lumbar cerebrospinal (CSF) drainage catheters are also essential aspects of the operation that give the cardiac anesthesiologist a key role in the surgical treatment of thoracic aortic disease. Recent multi-disciplinary guidelines for thoracic aortic diseases include evidence-based recommendations regarding anesthetic techniques and intraoperative monitoring. This review of anesthetic and monitoring considerations for thoracic aortic surgery will be presented in the following three sections: (1) aortic root/ascending aorta; (2) aortic arch; and (3) descending thoracic aorta.

### Aortic Root and Ascending Aorta

Surgical intervention for the aortic root and ascending aorta may be isolated to these aortic segments or may continue distally into the arch and beyond. Surgery for ascending aorta pathology above the root may often involve partial reconstruction of the aortic arch as well. When isolated to the level of the aortic root, the aortic arch may not be included in the surgical intervention. Typically, surgical indications for ascending aortic intervention include dissection, intramural hematoma, and aneurysm. Factors such as patient age, connective tissue disorder, family history, and bicuspid aortic valve must all be taken into account when finalizing the surgical plan. Header of the aortic root, and account when finalizing the surgical plan.

The surgical approach to these cases is via a midline sternotomy, and therefore, patients will be positioned supine with both arms tucked and padded at their sides. Along with a balanced general endotracheal anesthetic, these patients typically have an arterial line and PAC placed for hemodynamic monitoring. The maintenance of normotensive blood pressure is suitable for patients with chronic aortic disease. When presenting for elective surgery, preoperative antihypertensive therapy should be titrated to achieve a blood pressure less than 140/90 mm Hg or less than 130/80 mm Hg in patients with diabetes or chronic renal disease (Class I recommendation; Level B evidence). 64,65 Preoperative therapy may even be titrated in known aortic aneurysm patients to achieve the lowest possible blood pressure that is tolerated without adverse effects (Class IIa recommendation; Level B evidence). 64,65 In acute pathologies of the ascending aorta such as dissection, more aggressive treatment to a systolic pressure of 100 to 120 mm Hg is recommended since aortic rupture is a major concern in this phase. 64,65 This strict control of systolic blood pressure is typically achieved with adequate anesthetic depth, titrated analgesia with opioids such as fentanyl and morphine, and vasodilator therapy with agents such as beta-blockers, nitroprusside, nicardipine, or morphine. Intravenous beta-blockade is typically avoided in the settings of significant aortic regurgitation and/or cardiac tamponade since cardiac output in these presentations remains ratedependent. 64,65,68 Since acute aortic dissection is dynamic and progressive, patients may become acutely hemodynamically unstable, emphasizing the importance for not only being prepared for these scenarios, but also the importance of a prompt anesthetic induction to minimize delays and control patient anxiety and hypertension.

Anesthetic induction should involve a smooth intravenous induction with adequate anesthetic depth and blood pressure control for laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation. If presenting emergently, concerns for a full stomach should lead to a 'modified' rapid sequence induction, where cricoid pressure is applied but gentle mask ventilation is used prior to endotracheal intubation. The choice of a left or right radial arterial line depends on disease extent and cannulation strategy. High-quality communication between all members of the operating room team streamlines this process. Indications for a left radial arterial line include innominate disease, and planned right axillary arterial cannulation. A right radial arterial line is often indicated for monitoring of cerebral perfusion pressure in antegrade cerebral perfusion during periods of systemic circulatory arrest. 69-71 The institutional practices for cannulation and monitoring will often determine preferences for which side is chosen. This may include a requirement for bilateral upper extremity arterial lines.

TEE is reasonable in all open surgical repairs of the thoracic aorta, unless a specific contraindication to its use exists (Class IIa recommendation; Level B evidence). 65 When used specifically for the ascending aorta or root surgery, there is a strong consensus that TEE is particularly suited for aortic imaging in unstable patients with suspected acute aortic syndromes. 64,65 TEE can also verify the aortic diagnosis, interrogate the aortic valve comprehensively, and confirm important aortic diameters. 64-66,72 Precise measurements of the aortic root diameters can provide data to guide decision making about whether to replace or spare the root, depending on the clinical scenario (Fig. 11-8).65-67 Similarly, TEE can be used to assess the extent of proximal dissection within the root and whether the dissection flap crosses the AV to cause AR (Fig. 11-9). This information can provide data to guide the surgical plan for the aortic valve. 73,74 In addition to identifying the presence of a pericardial effusion with or without tamponade, the origin of the primary tear, the extent of the dissection, and regional wall motion abnormalities from coronary dissection, TEE can also guide the surgeon's successful placement of the arterial inflow cannula when direct central cannulation through the dissection is chosen.<sup>75</sup> In this scenario, the echocardiographer must identify the true lumen on TEE with certainty in order to verify correct wire placement (Fig. 11-10).<sup>75</sup> Checking for appropriate flow in the true lumen after initiation of CPB can then further verify adequate cannula location. In addition to assessment of the thoracic aorta, TEE also serves to exclude other cardiac pathology and evaluate the surgical repair and ventricular function after CPB. In the setting of aortic root replacement with coronary reimplantation, TEE can analyze ventricular wall motion after CPB to verify adequate blood flow. While the indications described above are more specific to ascending aorta pathology, TEE plays a similar role in open aortic arch and descending aorta surgical procedures. In addition to TEE, intraoperative monitoring of the carotid arteries with

**FIGURE 11-8** Aortic valve long-axis transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) views in two patients with ascending aorta aneurysms. The benefits of TEE in aortic surgery include the ability to quantify dilation, as well as identify structural integrity of the aortic valve and root. Panel A demonstrates definition of the sinotubular junction (*arrowheads*), while Panel B demonstrates effacement requiring root replacement.

ultrasound can be beneficial in aortic dissection to confirm bilateral carotid flow prior to CPB, while on CPB, and after cross-clamping. In this scenario, brachiocephalic malperfusion may result from factors such as retrograde arterial perfusion, loss of flow through intimal fenestrations, and loss of pulsatile flow.<sup>76</sup> If detected, changes in cannulation site and/or intimal fenestration can restore normal cerebral perfusion.<sup>76</sup>

While midline sternotomy with CPB is the typical operative plan for ascending aorta pathology, endovascular approaches in patients deemed too high risk for open repair have been performed with success. Transapical access allows antegrade stenting of the ascending aorta with verification of wire placement and assistance with stent positioning provided by TEE (Fig. 11-11). Just as in transapical

TEE demonstrates that in systole (Panel A), the dissection flap (*red arrow*) extends into the root, but it is above the aortic valve (*yellow arrow*). During diastole (Panel B), the dissection flap (*red arrow*) prolapses across the aortic valve, thus preventing adequate coaptation of the valve leaflets.

transcatheter AVR, the anesthetic plan should anticipate the need for rapid ventricular pacing for stent deployment and should include appropriate resuscitative measures for hemodynamic recovery after pacing.<sup>79</sup>

#### **Aortic Arch**

The decision to include the aortic arch in the operative plan depends on the pathology and extent of disease. <sup>64-66,80</sup> Although a hemiarch is often appropriate, total aortic arch replacement may be required in the setting of extensive arch disease. <sup>64-66</sup> Furthermore, the advent and expansion of hybrid aortic arch procedures will likely lead to a drift towards endovascular adjuncts in high-risk patients. <sup>64-66,81</sup> Direct

arch replacement typically requires temporary cessation of systemic blood flow to allow for arch reconstruction, with greater periods of hypothermic circulatory arrest frequently required for total arch replacement. Although hypothermic circulatory arrest is an established classic technique, it still carries the risk of neurological complications. Becaute Therefore, neuroprotective strategies must be incorporated into the anesthetic and surgical plans to decrease risk to the patient (Class 1 recommendation; Level B evidence). Although there are several neuroprotective options available, there still exists marked variation in the conduct of hypothermic circulatory arrest, including choice of cerebral protection strategies and preferred neuromonitoring techniques. Although the strategies and preferred neuromonitoring techniques.

# NEUROPROTECTION DURING ADULT AORTIC ARCH REPAIR

The high metabolic rate of the brain makes it particularly susceptible to ischemic injury during periods of circulatory arrest. 85 To mitigate this ischemia, hypothermia is utilized to decrease both cerebral metabolic and oxygen demands, allowing for increased periods of circulatory arrest.85 The degree of hypothermia utilized for aortic arch repair has recently been defined by international consensus into four levels: profound, deep, moderate, and mild (Table 11-5).85 The optimal level of hypothermia for aortic arch repair has recently been under scrutiny.85 The requirement for profound or deep hypothermic circulatory arrest has recently been questioned due to concerns about the increased risks of coagulopathy, inflammatory response, and end-organ dysfunction.<sup>82-85</sup> The increasing utilization of cerebral perfusion adjuncts, such as retrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP) or selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP), have enabled moderate degrees of hypothermia to be increasingly chosen for aortic arch procedures with successful outcomes. 82,85-87 The conduct of RCP involves retrograde perfusion through the superior vena cava cannula to achieve a CVP of 15 to 20 mm Hg, typically monitored at the level of the right internal jugular vein.88 Although RCP with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest provides excellent

outcomes for aortic arch repair with short reconstruction times, the amount of perfusate that actually provides metabolic substrate to support brain metabolic function during RCP remains low.  $^{88,89}$ 

The emerging contemporary paradigm for adult aortic arch repair is the utilization of moderate hypothermia with ACP since this guarantees cerebral perfusion, extends the duration of time for aortic arch reconstruction, and avoids the morbidity of deeper levels of hypothermia. 82,84-87 ACP can be performed either in a unilateral fashion with a cannula in the right axillary artery or innominate artery, or in a bilateral fashion with cannulas in both the innominate and left carotid arteries. Although ACP can be unilateral or bilateral, recent trials both in elective and emergent adult aortic arch repair suggest that unilateral ACP at adequate pressure with appropriate neuromonitoring is safe, effective, and straightforward. 90-92 Perfusion during ACP is often titrated to maintain flows in the range of 10 to 15 mL/kg, a right radial artery pressure of approximately 50 to 60 mm Hg, and a baseline neuromonitoring profile.<sup>93</sup> The final selection of both the degree of hypothermia and type of cerebral perfusion adjunct will depend on factors such as the patient, the aortic arch pathology, surgical preferences, and institutional practices. Despite the significant variability, it is reasonable to use the perfusion management strategy that is best suited to the team and institution (Class IIa Recommendation; Level B Evidence). 65

In addition to these perfusion strategies for neuroprotection, pharmacologic agents are also often employed. 83,84 Thiopental or propofol may be given at doses to cause burst suppression. 93 Corticosteroids, magnesium, and lidocaine are also popular for their potential neuroprotective benefit. 83,84,94,95 Recent analysis from a large adult European registry has suggested that steroids may decrease the stroke rate after aortic arch reconstruction. 95 There is currently no strong evidence to guide the choice of pharmacologic agents for improving neurologic outcomes after thoracic aortic surgery. Therefore, the use of these agents should be considered an adjunct to hypothermia. Further trials are required to identify best practices in this area.

# NEUROMONITORING DURING ADULT AORTIC ARCH REPAIR

Neuroprotective strategies during aortic arch repair such as hypothermia, cerebral perfusion adjuncts, and appropriate pharmacology do not guarantee prevention of postoperative neurologic injury. Furthermore, general anesthesia precludes a full neurological examination during the procedure. Intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring remains important for early detection of possible neurologic injury and for assessment of adequate perfusion. The ability to identify impending injury can also allow for earlier intervention to prevent permanent injury. The use of intraoperative monitors can certainly help guide therapy, but the decision to use such monitoring will depend on individual patient needs, institutional resources, the urgency of the procedure, and the perfusion techniques being used (Class IIa Recommendation; Level B Evidence). Furthermore, while these monitors provide valuable information intraoperatively, there are no large, randomized controlled trials that provide conclusive evidence that these monitors decrease neurologic injury after adult aortic arch repair.

Electroencephalography (EEG) measures spontaneous electrical brain activity via electrodes placed in a standardized fashion on the scalp. The electrical activity is amplified and displayed on a monitor as a continuous EEG signal. During the use of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, gradual slowing of the EEG occurs until electrocortical silence is achieved with continued lower temperatures (Fig. 11-12). 6 Therefore, the degree of hypothermia needed for neuroprotection can be determined by EEG silence as a marker of brain temperature and metabolic suppression.<sup>88,96,97</sup> Without EEG, simply cooling to a target temperature such as 18 degrees Celsius may not provide adequate cerebral metabolic suppression since this approach does not guarantee EEG silence in 100% of patients.96,97 EEG is also a useful monitor to detect seizures and ischemia during thoracic aortic surgery. 98,99 Since anesthetic agents can attenuate EEG amplitude and frequencies, high-quality communication between all intraoperative team members can minimize anesthetic interference with the EEG recordings for optimal neuromonitoring at all phases of the procedure. During systemic rewarming, the return of the EEG signal to baseline suggests neurologic injury did not occur as a result of the arch repair or unintended brain hyperthermia.97,100

An increase in jugular bulb venous oxygen saturation monitored via an oximetric catheter has also been utilized for guiding temperature-induced cerebral metabolic suppression. 101 Although jugular bulb saturation > 95% suggests cerebral metabolic suppression, routine jugular bulb saturation monitoring has not enhanced the neuroprotective effects of hyporthermia.<sup>101</sup> As an alternative, near-infrared spectrophotometry (NIRS) offers noninvasive measurement of cerebral oxygen saturation. 83,84,93 A further advantage of NIRS over EEG is its ability to continue monitoring cerebral perfusion status after EEG silence has occurred. However, NIRS only provides a focal assessment due to small sample size of brain tissue being monitored, and therefore, it may not detect ischemia in other brain regions. 102 Similar to pulse oximetry, the NIRS device is based on different absorption characteristics of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, as measured from two adhesive pads placed over the frontal lobes. 102 Cerebral oximetry values typically increase during deliberate hypothermia since cerebral oxygen demand decreases.

![](_page_17_Figure_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 11-12** Electroencephalography (EEG) obtained during a case of ascending aorta and hemiarch replacement using deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. As the patient is progressively cooled, amplitude and frequency decrease from baseline (Panel A) until EEG silence (Panel B) is obtained (approximately 18°C in this patient). Note the signal artifact in Panel B.

During periods of cerebral ischemia such as circulatory arrest, decreases from the baseline cerebral oximetry values suggest inadequate perfusion. Whether RCP or ACP is being employed, perfusion pressures via RCP cannulas or ACP cannulas can be adjusted to seek an improvement in NIRS values. Similarly, when unilateral ACP is being employed, a drop in the contralateral NIRS monitor suggests inadequate contralateral hemispheric perfusion due to an incomplete circle of Willis or due to inadequate ACP flow. Increasing ACP unilateral flow and/or instituting bilateral ACP typically restore the NIRS values to baseline, which may correlate with better perioperative neurologic outcomes. While the use of NIRS is becoming more standard in the conduct of adult aortic arch repair, further trials are required to delineate best practices with this novel technology. 102

# **Descending Thoracic Aorta**

The main diseases of the descending thoracic aorta and/or the thoracoabdominal aorta that require surgical intervention are aneurysm and dissection. <sup>64-66</sup> The repair options include open replacement, thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) and hybrid procedures that involve both techniques. <sup>105</sup> The anesthetic plan for descending thoracic aorta repair must be tailored according to the surgical approach, with a major goal for all surgical techniques to prevent distal ischemic injury to the visceral organs and the spinal cord. This ischemia can occur during the repair itself when flow may be intermittently occluded or due to loss of aortic branches. To prevent organ injury and neurologic deficit, emphasis should be placed on strategies to minimize ischemia, as well as quickly identify and treat ischemia.

#### **OPEN SURGICAL REPAIR**

Access for open repair of the descending thoracic aorta is achieved by a left thoracotomy with the patient in the right lateral decubitus position. When the disease process extends into the abdominal aorta, an extensive thoracoabdominal incision is indicated for retroperitoneal access to the abdominal aorta. 106 In addition to full invasive monitoring, it is preferable to have a femoral arterial line to monitor lower body perfusion. To allow for adequate visualization in the left chest, a left-sided double-lumen endotracheal tube is typically utilized for selective collapse of the left lung, although at times, aneurysmal compression of the left main bronchus may require downsizing or a switch to a bronchial blocker for effective lung separation. In addition to allowing good exposure, lung isolation also reduces the need for pulmonary retraction and may decrease unintended pulmonary contusions.<sup>65</sup> At the conclusion of the operation, the decision to exchange the endotracheal tube for a single-lumen endotracheal tube should be made after a thorough evaluation for airway edema and bleeding. A single-lumen tube is usually desired to allow for better pulmonary hygiene; however, routine exchange to a single-lumen tube is not recommended when significant upper airway edema or hemorrhage is present (Class III Recommendation; Level C Evidence).65

Prevention of postoperative spinal cord ischemia remains a major goal for descending aortic surgery (Table 11-6). <sup>107</sup> When an open repair is performed, various strategies are possible to maintain distal aortic and spinal cord perfusion. These surgical options will only be briefly discussed here, allowing for a focus on nonsurgical adjuncts and neuromonitoring. A simple aortic cross-clamp technique has been used with success when clamp time is minimized, but it does not allow

for organ protection during the ischemic period. 107 Prolonged cross clamp can be detrimental to organ function, especially when >30 minutes. 107 Distal perfusion using left heart bypass can be achieved with drainage of oxygenated blood from the left atrium being returned to a femoral artery after going through a perfusion circuit. 106,107 Modifications based on the presence or absence of an oxygenator dictate anticoagulation requirements. This technique has the benefit of maintaining spinal cord, mesenteric, and renal perfusion, while simultaneously allowing for a degree of proximal hypertension to maintain additional spinal cord perfusion via the vertebral artery. 106,107 Left heart bypass can also keep the LV unloaded in situations of extreme proximal hypertension. Alternatively, the surgeon can choose full CPB with hypothermic circulatory arrest to complete the repair when the distal aortic arch requires intervention. 107,108

An additional strategy to potentially provide spinal cord protection from ischemia includes the use of mild to moderate systemic hypothermia (Class IIa Recommendation; Level B Evidence). 65,106,107 Hypothermia not only decreases metabolic demands, but it also attenuates the inflammatory response during reperfusion. As mentioned above, administration of steroids for neuroprotection is frequently practiced to potentially reduce spinal cord edema, but clear evidence for benefit remains uncertain (Class IIb Recommendation; Level B Evidence). 65,106,107 The augmentation of spinal cord perfusion is also an important perioperative technique for neuroprotection (Class IIa Evidence; Level B Evidence). 65,106,107 Spinal cord perfusion pressure is equal to the difference between the mean arterial pressure and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure. Systemic vasoconstrictors such as phenylephrine, norepinephrine, and/or vasopressin to increase the mean arterial pressure can effectively treat spinal cord ischemia, and gradual continued augmentation should be continued if ischemia persists. 106,107 It is important to keep in mind that cardiac output augmentation with inotropes may also be necessary to improve oxygen delivery. The second option for spinal cord perfusion pressure augmentation is CSF drainage via a lumbar CSF drain. CSF drainage is recommended in all patients at high risk for spinal cord ischemia (Class IIa Recommendation; Level B Evidence). 66,108 Both randomized trials and

meta-analyses have demonstrated that CSF drainage results in decreased postoperative paraplegia after open thoracic aortic surgery.<sup>107</sup> Drainage of CSF should aim for a lumbar CSF pressure of 10 mm Hg, without causing rapid drainage that can result in intracranial hypotension. 107 Although preoperative placement of these catheters is common, postoperative placement may be indicated in patients with spinal cord ischemia. Like all neuraxial invasive techniques, the coagulation status of the patient should be normalized prior to instrumentation to avoid hematoma formation. Further reported complications from CSF drainage catheters include retained catheter fragments, spinal headaches, nerve palsy, and meningitis. 107 A surgical option for augmenting spinal cord perfusion is reimplantation of intercostal and segmental branches to the new aortic graft or occlusion of large vessels that backbleed to prevent arterial steal.<sup>107</sup>

As equally important as it is to treat spinal cord ischemia is the ability to detect ischemia. <sup>106-108</sup> Early detection can allow for intervention to take place before permanent, irreversible ischemic damage occurs. Postoperatively, serial neurologic examinations can be performed on the patient that has recovered from general anesthesia. <sup>107</sup> This is not an option, however, for the anesthetized patient in the operating room that is undergoing an open repair. Therefore, the use of neurophysiological monitoring of the spinal cord is advocated when feasible (Class IIb Recommendation; Level B Evidence). <sup>65</sup>

The use of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) allow the surgeon and anesthesiologist to respond quickly to changes seen from baseline recordings. SSEPs are performed by placing stimulating electrodes on peripheral nerves in both upper and lower extremities. Stimulation is then conducted via the posterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord to the cerebral cortex. SSEPs can influence blood pressure and CSF management, but they can also guide the need for further reimplantation of segmental vessels.<sup>107</sup> The advantage of SSEPs is that the signal is less affected by anesthetics and paralytic agents. However, anterior spinal cord ischemia can still occur without a change in SSEPs. While more complex, the use of MEPs is occasionally advocated because they rely on stimulation of the motor cortex with signals conducted through the anterior column of the spinal cord. Although more sensitive than SSEPs, MEP signal is also more influenced by anesthetic and paralytic agents. 107-109 The choice of SSEPs or MEPs is often also dependent on institutional culture and resources. Interpretation should be performed and guided by trained team that often includes a neurologist. It is essential to keep in mind that changes in SSEP or MEP signals from baseline are not necessarily caused by spinal cord ischemia (Fig. 11-13). 107-110 Hypothermia can cause global signal attenuation. 110 Similarly, interruption of lower extremity blood flow from infrarenal vascular clamping can also cause signal attenuation. The site of signal attenuation along the neural pathway can determine whether central or peripheral malperfusion has occurred. Close communication between the neuromonitoring team and the rest of the intraoperative team is essential to

**FIGURE 11-13** Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) are obtained from all four extremities in a patient undergoing open descending aorta repair.

ensure appropriate and timely detection of and intervention for significant events. 107-110

#### **ENDOVASCULAR REPAIR**

Endovascular intervention for descending thoracic aortic disease has significantly increased. 64-66 In addition to being far less invasive and allowing for quicker recovery, TEVAR may also reduce perioperative complications. 64-66,107,111 Similar to open repair, the principles of preventing, detecting, and treating spinal cord and organ ischemia remain important, although the risk of spinal cord ischemia in TEVAR is significantly lower.<sup>107</sup> Risk factors for spinal cord ischemia in this setting include a long segment of aortic coverage (eg, left subclavian to celiac arteries) and patients with prior aortic repair. 107 Although the adjuncts of neuromonitoring and CSF drainage are not routine in TEVAR, they are strongly considered in elective patients with risk factors. 107 Significant attenuation of evoked potentials in this setting merit interventions such as permissive hypertension and CSF drainage, as outlined earlier.

During TEVAR, the patient remains supine with both arms tucked at the sides. For general anesthesia, a singlelumen endotracheal tube suffices since lung isolation is not required. A radial arterial line and typically large-bore central venous access are also obtained. Tracheal extubation is a reasonable goal for uncomplicated interventions. This allows for a quick neurologic examination to rule out any potential ischemia that may have occurred. Alternatively, either regional or local anesthesia may be options, depending on institutional practice and case specifics. 112 A continuous epidural infusion can allow for patient comfort, as well as continuous detection of neurologic function. However, it is imperative to differentiate the effects of neuraxial blockade by local anesthetics from true spinal cord malperfusion. Although not routinely performed, TEE is reasonable in endovascular aortic repair for monitoring, procedural guidance, and/or graft leak detection (Class IIa Evidence; Level B Evidence). 65 Comprehensive TEE can assist with quantifying vessel caliber, locating guidewires, as well as postdeployment assessment of cardiac function and interrogation of the aorta.

Involvement of the distal arch may require a very proximal landing zone for the TEVAR stent. In some instances, coverage of the left subclavian artery may be warranted and unavoidable in emergent situations. While an argument can be made to monitor left radial arterial pressure for this scenario, a right radial arterial line is more practical if preoperative revascularization has not been performed. In more elective cases of TEVAR, a prior staged procedure can include either transposition of the left subclavian to the left common carotid artery or a left carotid-subclavian bypass. 113-115 This revascularization option is now being endorsed when feasible due to recent meta-analysis that suggests an increased risk of arm ischemia, stroke, and spinal cord injury. 113-115

#### **HEART FAILURE SURGERY**

Despite maximal goal-directed medical therapy, a subset of patients with chronic CHF will develop advanced stages of disease.<sup>116</sup> For these patients who progressively deteriorate despite optimal goal-directed medical therapy, interventions including implantable defibrillator device or cardiac resynchronization therapy and surgical therapy including revascularization, valve, ventricular restoration and remodeling surgery, or mechanical circulatory support (VADs, heart transplantation) may be warranted.<sup>116</sup>.

# Anesthetic Management of the Patient with Heart Failure

Anesthetizing patients with advanced CHF can be challenging as they commonly have the following findings consistent with poor functional reserve: severe symptoms at rest or with minimal exertion; episodes of fluid retention and/or peripheral hypoperfusion; objective evidence of severe cardiac dysfunction (ie, LVEF < 30%, restrictive mitral inflow pattern by Doppler echocardiography, elevated LV and/or RV filling pressures, elevated B-type natriuretic peptides); evidence of systemic organ injury (ie, renal and hepatic dysfunction); severe impairment of functional capacity; and history of multiple hospitalizations for CHF in the prior six months. 117 Hyponatremia with serum sodium < 133 mEq/L is also relatively common and is associated with worse outcomes. 118

Preoperative evaluation includes an assessment of the level of the patient's dependency on cardiovascular support with medications and devices. Heart failure patients are medically managed with a variety of medications that have significant perioperative implications. <sup>119</sup> Hypotension with induction and maintenance of anesthesia is common among patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), angiotensin-receptor blockers, milrinone, and nesiritide because all of these drugs can cause significant vasodilation. <sup>120,121</sup> Perioperative hypotension associated with angiotensin-receptor blockers may require the administration of vasopressin because it may be refractory to phenylephrine or ephedrine. <sup>122</sup>

Heart failure patients are often fully anticoagulated at the time of urgent or emergent surgery because they are taking prophylactic agents to attenuate the development of venous thromboembolic disease due to reduced cardiac output, increased systemic venous pressure, and chemical changes promoting blood clotting. As such, they may require aggressive perioperative warfarin reversal. However, instead of volume-loading patients with fresh-frozen plasma, other therapies including vitamin K and/or four-factor prothrombin complex concentrates (ie, plasma-derived concentrates of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, X, protein C and S) may be required perioperatively. 123 Of note, most prothrombin complex concentrates contain varying amounts of heparin and are therefore contraindicated in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).<sup>124</sup> Furthermore, many patients have had prior cardiac surgery and will need blood products (irradiated and cytomegalovirus-negative) immediately available in the operating room at the time of induction of anesthesia.

Assessment of antiarrhythmic devices and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator includes interrogation and reprogramming to a mode that is not affected by electrocautery. External defibrillator pads need to be placed and the defibrillator function temporarily deactivated. 125 Appropriate arterial and venous lines are placed before induction of anesthesia. Depending on the patient characteristics and the presence of a nonpulsatile VAD, arterial line placement may be difficult and may require ultrasound guided placement. If a patient does not already have a PAC, one can be placed before or after induction of anesthesia. Of note, placing a PAC in a patient with a VAD can be challenging and may have to be placed under fluoroscopic guidance in the catheter laboratory or in the operating room. Floating a PAC across the tricuspid valve is sometimes difficult and for the patient undergoing heart transplantation, the catheter tip needs to be withdrawn into the superior vena cava. In this position, the infusion ports are outside of the vein in the sheath, making them unavailable for use until the catheter is reintroduced into the correct position after the donor heart is transplanted.

Induction and maintenance of anesthesia in CHF patients with marginal reserve requires diligent titration of medications in order to maintain acceptable organ perfusion, while avoiding arrhythmias and hypotension. A balanced anesthetic is usually provided by administering a combination of narcotics, muscle relaxants, and intravenous and/or inhalational anesthetic agents with judicious use of vasopressors and inotropes. Anticoagulation for CPB is usually achieved with heparin, but because heart failure patients are often exposed to heparin, they may have antibodies, and direct thrombin inhibitors may need to be administered instead. 126,127

Weaning from CPB can be challenging and intraoperative TEE can be useful in guiding patient care. As heart failure patients often have preexisting pulmonary hypertension or RV dysfunction, they are more likely to develop post-bypass right heart failure. Vigilance in prevention and early detection of post-bypass RV failure is important <sup>128</sup> (Table 11-7).

# Anesthetic Management for the Heart Transplantation

Heart transplantation is the gold standard for treatment of end-stage heart failure. The 1-year and 5-year survival after heart transplantation is 81% and 69% respectively, with a median survival of 11 years for all recipients, and 14 years for those surviving the first year after transplantation (www.ishlt. org/registries). 129 Cardiomyopathy (55%) and chronic ischemic heart disease (36%) are the leading underlying cause of heart failure among heart transplant recipients for whom the median adult recipient age is 54 years while the proportion of patients transplanted at extremes of ages continues to increase. 129 Not surprisingly, close to half of the recipients have undergone previous cardiac surgery, 35% have a VAD, most commonly for the LV, and 7% have an IABP. Although 1.1% of transplant recipients were on preoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), this number has increased from 0.3% in the mid-1990s. 127

Heart transplantation occurs urgently or emergently and requires close coordination with the harvesting team to minimize ischemic time. As close to half of the patients have had prior sternotomy, blood availability and cannulation strategies need to be confirmed. In addition to the usual antibiotic prophylaxis, immunosuppressive medications need to be administered. Inotropic medications, IABP, or other

mechanical assistance are maintained until institution of CPB. <sup>130</sup> TEE is useful in assessing the native heart. Pretransplant TEE evaluation includes an assessment of the presence of intracardiac thrombus and degree of atheromatous plaque at cannulation sites.

Heart failure patients are at increased risk for developing HIT. Thus it is important to ascertain that heparin use is acceptable. Otherwise, alternative anticoagulation with direct thrombin inhibitors or preoperative plasmapheresis to reduce HIT antibodies may be necessary. Patients who are sensitized with preformed anti-human leukocyte antigen antibodies against donor antigens are at increased risk for acute or hyperacute rejection as well as transplant vasculopathy. Antibodies are common among patients presenting for a second transplant. Various densensitization modalities may need to be employed (plasmapheresis, immunoglobulin, rituximab, and bortezomib), and some of the therapies may require pretreatment with acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, and corticosteroids to prevent cytokine release syndrome. Patients

Weaning from CPB can be challenging as post-bypass contractility can often be marginal or poor. Certain donor heart characteristics may predispose the recipient to poor prognosis after heart transplantation (Table 11-8). After weaning from CPB, right heart failure can develop and in extreme cases, primary graft failure can occur.<sup>133</sup> Careful TEE evaluation and titration of inotropes and ventilator strategies aimed at reducing pulmonary vascular resistance and use of inhaled epoprostenol or other selective inhaled pulmonary vasodilators can facilitate weaning from CPB. Occasionally, patients may develop RV failure requiring temporary support with a VAD or ECMO.<sup>134,135</sup>

### Anesthetic Considerations for Ventricular Assist Device Implantation

Mechanical circulatory support, including the use of VADs and the total artificial heart, is another therapeutic option for the advanced stage heart failure patient. 116 Similar to heart transplant recipients, patients eligible for VAD placement have marginal reserve and require careful titration of anesthetic drugs to induce and maintain anesthesia. Many of these patients require significant preoperative inotropic support, which often must be maintained throughout the operative course. Up to 40% of patients undergoing VAD implantation have profound vasoplegia and may require vasopressin and methylene blue administration. 136,137 The goal of perioperative fluid management is to maintain intravascular volume to facilitate left VAD (LVAD) function without creating RV dysfunction. 138 Blood transfusions are avoided if possible to prevent sensitization for future heart transplantation. Because infection is a major cause of death, VAD patients often receive multiple prophylactic antibiotics.

The key to successful LVAD implantation lies in preventing RV failure, which occurs in 25 to 50% of recipients. <sup>139</sup> Ventricular interdependence plays an important role in the development of post-LVAD failure of the RV. Because of the anatomic proximity of the RV to the LV, changes in LV

volume can result in immediate changes to RV pressure and volume and vice versa. Monitoring the position of the septum in the immediate post-CPB period is crucial since >50% of RV function is dependent on proper septal function. <sup>128</sup>

Studies have shown that a functioning LVAD can decrease RV afterload, increase RV compliance, and decrease RV contractility. When the LV is completely decompressed, global RV contractility can be impaired secondary to the leftward shift of the interventricular septum. Nonetheless, RV myocardial efficiency and power output are maintained through a decrease in RV afterload and increase in RV preload. However, with preexisting right heart dysfunction, anatomic ventricular interaction is accentuated causing a greater decrease in RV contractility which can ultimately lead to RV failure. 128

In order to maintain midline position of the interventricular and interatrial septum, LVAD flows, volume status, RV function, degree of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) as well as other hemodynamic variables (CVP, pulmonary artery pressures, left atrial pressures, and mean blood pressure) may need to be carefully adjusted. LVAD flows may also need to

be decreased to prevent increased venous return from overwhelming the functional capacity of the RV. Other treatment principals in preventing or mitigating RV failure need to be considered as well, including (1) maintaining sinus rhythm in order to optimize filling of a hypertrophied or dilated RV; (2) avoiding acute RV distension by overzealous volume loading; (3) maintaining RV CPP and RV inotropic therapy; (4) maintaining RV geometry; and (5) reducing pulmonary vascular resistance<sup>128</sup> (Table 11-7). In severe RV failure, RVAD placement may be necessary.

Although several preoperative risk factors for post-LVAD failure of the RV have been identified, the occurrence of RV failure is largely unpredictable. Therefore, in addition to utilizing ventilator strategies to decrease pulmonary vascular resistance by avoiding PEEP, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and acidosis, nonselectively inhaled pulmonary vasodilators (nitric oxide, epoprostenol) at the time of weaning from bypass may be utilized.

Pre-LVAD implant intraoperative TEE evaluation includes assessment for thrombus in the apex where the inflow cannula will be inserted; evaluation for atherosclerosis of the ascending aorta where the outflow graft will be placed; evaluation for atrial septal defects or patent foramen ovale as significant right-to-left shunting post-LVAD implantation can lead to severe hypoxemia; determining the degree of AR as valve replacement or surgical closure may be required in the presence of moderate or severe AR; and a thorough evaluation of RV function.

TEE is also valuable in assisting the surgeon with the position of inflow and outflow cannulae. The LVAD inflow cannula is usually placed in the apex for destination therapy and bridge-to-transplant, and in the left atrium for those who with a previous ventriculoplasty procedure or in those with an anticipated quick recovery. Ideally, the LV inflow cannula should be angled toward the MV in alignment with the LV inflow tract, while not abutting any wall. <sup>141</sup> The outflow graft in the proximal ascending aorta can sometimes be difficult to visualize by TEE. The tip of an RVAD inflow cannula is ideally oriented in the middle of the right atrium away from the atrial septum and tricuspid valve. The outflow cannula is usually placed in the pulmonary artery, 1.5 to 2 cm beyond the annulus.

The development of smaller VADs has enabled the increasing use of minimally invasive implant strategies, including off-pump procedures. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and TEE are helpful in assisting placement of the inflow cannula via a small thoracotomy or subcostal incision.  $^{142}$ 

#### **Total Artificial Heart**

Total artificial heart (TAH) implantation is relatively rare and involves only 2.3% of all device implants. <sup>143</sup> Several management issues specific to the TAH (SynCardia, Inc., Tucson, AZ; formerly known as CardioWest) have significant clinical implications. <sup>144</sup> Anesthetic management of other total artificial heart devices that are not yet FDA-approved is not discussed in this section.

<sup>\*</sup>Ischemic time:donor aortic cross-clamp to removal of recipient aortic cross-clamp.

<sup>\*\*</sup>Pretransplant implantable LVAD dependence was not shown to be associated with decreased graft survival.

During TAH implantation, the native cardiac ventricles and arterioventricular valves are removed and in its place, an orthotopic pneumatic pulsatile device consisting of two separate artificial ventricles is implanted. Each ventricle has two single-tilting mechanical valves mounted on the housing of the artificial ventricle. Several advantages of a TAH include the ability to pump at high flow rates (>9 L/min at maximal stroke volume of 70 mL) with filling pressures of 8 to 15 mm Hg. Common indications that favor TAH versus biventricular assist device include severe myopathies that result in biventricular hypertrophy with small intraventricular chamber size, failed Fontan, failed cardiac transplantation, myocardial infarction with related ischemic cardiomyopathy resulting in intractable biventricular failure with postinfarct ventricular septal defects (VSD), large LV apical aneurysm or LV thrombus, and severe AV pathology including AR or mechanical valve prosthesis.144

When placing a perioperative central venous line, the tip of the central venous catheter must not extend into the right atrium, as central venous catheter entrapment in the right TAH mechanical inflow valve can result in fatal TAH malfunction. Thus, placement of a PAC should not be attempted in these patients after TAH implantation. Although weaning from CPB is generally not an issue, some patients may require vasopressors to treat vasoplegia. Inotropes are not needed in these patients. Assessing adequate de-airing can be challenging because the TAH air diaphragms that drive blood out of the ventricles appear similar to intracardiac air. Thus, de-airing relies on repeated evaluation for air in the atria, pulmonary veins, ascending aorta, and main pulmonary artery. 146

Cardiac tamponade in the classical sense of RV diastolic compression after TAH implantation cannot occur because of the rigid construction of the artificial ventricles. However, "tamponade" due to compression or kinking of the vena cavae (IVC compression more common than SVC) and/or pulmonary veins (left pulmonary vein compression more common than the right) can occur. Therefore, while the native heart is in place, baseline TEE of the vena cava and pulmonary veins may be useful for enabling identification and evaluation of kinking after TAH implantation.<sup>146</sup>

Peak Doppler flow velocities ≥ 1.1 m/s in patients following radiofrequency ablation for atrial fibrillation have been associated with pulmonary vein stenosis. Although peak velocities > 2 m/s have been associated with no apparent hemodynamic consequences after TAH implantation, more studies are necessary to determine acceptable peak values. In the meantime, establishing baseline post-TAH implant pulmonary vein flow velocities may provide a helpful comparison in the future when other signs of hypoperfusion point to possible kinking of the pulmonary veins.

# ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY AND CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION LABS

As technology advances and the population ages, medical interventions and surgical treatments converge, while target patient populations combine as complexity and acuity rise.

Our ability to treat conditions once outside the penumbra of "traditional" surgical and medical care continues to grow. As diagnosis and interventions become more specialized and sophisticated, the broadened scope of our medical horizon necessitates the integration of related disciplines, particularly in the case of interconnected specialties. Nowhere is this more pressing than in cardiovascular medicine. For cardiac surgeons, cardiac anesthesiologists, electrophysiologists, and interventional cardiologists, it is increasingly necessary that we understand the essential framework of each other's medical thought process and practice in order to optimize the care we provide and the therapeutic interventions we offer.<sup>155</sup>

## **Electrophysiology Lab**

In a relatively short period of time, electrophysiology (EP) procedures have developed from largely diagnostic studies to complex, lifesaving interventions. Patients are more complex than ever, and demand for devices and procedures is high. Successful treatments and long-term survival of previously tenuous cardiovascular medicine patients has broadened the target population. Similarly, cardiac surgery patients often benefit from therapeutic interventions in the EP lab.

# DEVICES FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF DYSRHYTHMIAS

Pacemakers. Bradycardia at the level of the sinus node or AV node, either spontaneous or as a result of cardiac medications or surgeries, can be treated with pacemakers. 156 These devices deliver electrical impulses that depolarize myocardial cells near the lead tip and propagate into the contiguous myocardium. Pacemakers can be programmed in many ways. Pulse delivery sequences depend on how the pacemaker is programmed. Single-chamber transvenous pacemakers have a lead in the atrium or in the ventricle. Dual-chamber transvenous pacemakers typically have leads in both the right atrium and ventricle. Pacemakers capable of biventricular pacing have ventricular leads that can pace both the RV and LV. These devices are usually placed within the EP laboratory and require minimal to moderate sedation for the patient. Occasionally in the case of very frail patients, only local anesthesia is used. If the patient has psychiatric, neurological, neuromuscular, or other disorders, which preclude the use of nurse-administered sedative agents, anesthesiologists can provide deeper sedation or general anesthesia with other intravenous agents or volatile anesthetics. Surgically placed epicardial pacemakers may have electrodes that pace the heart overlying the right atrium, RV or LV. Patients often come to the EP lab with surgically implanted epicardial wires for hookup to a pacemaker, which is subsequently placed by an electrophysiologist. When necessary, hybrid surgical and transvenous systems can be created for patients with prohibitive anatomy, including those with tricuspid valve replacement, congenital heart disease or occluded vessels. Standard programmed modes for pacemaker operation are included in Table 11-9.157

<sup>\*</sup>Not commonly used in reference to pacemaker modes.

Single-chamber pacemakers are typically programmed to pace in the cardiac chamber where the electrode is attached, only when bradycardia occurs in that chamber. For example, a single-chamber ventricular pacemaker programmed in the VVI mode with a lower rate limit of 60 bpm in a patient with atrial fibrillation and slow ventricular response will only pace when the patient's heart rate goes below 60 bpm. In contrast, a dual-chamber pacemaker programmed in the DDD mode with a lower rate limit of 60 bpm will pace the atrium if the atrial rate falls below 60 bpm but will also pace the ventricle if the programmed AV interval has elapsed. Therefore, a normally functioning dual-chamber pacemaker may at times pace the atrium, the ventricle, or both cardiac chambers.

In response to development of a rapid atrial rhythm such as atrial fibrillation, a device may "mode switch" which means that the device would switch from a tracking mode such as DDD to a nontracking mode such as VVI or DDI in response to rapidly detected atrial rates. The "mode switch" option prevents the device from inappropriate rapid pacing the ventricle when a rapid rhythm occurs in the atrium. Cardiac surgeons and cardiac anesthesiologists need to be aware of pacemaker settings both in the operating room and after surgery. A patient in the operating room with a pacemaker may develop a rapid ventricular rate in response to a rapid atrial rate on induction of anesthesia or insertion of an invasive line if "mode-switch" is not enabled. Atrial fibrillation can commonly occur after cardiac surgery as well. This can be particularly problematic for those with pacemakers without "mode-switch" who do not tolerate rapid rates, such as patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.

ICDs. Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) have the capability of treating rapid ventricular arrhythmias to prevent sudden death. They have pacing functions that are much the same as electronic pacemakers. In the past, patients required separate pacemaker and defibrillator units implanted in order to achieve dual-chamber pacemaker function with concomitant defibrillator capability. However, modern devices are capable of the majority of pacemaker and defibrillator functions simultaneously. ICD leads differ from pacing leads in that there is a coil present on defibrillator leads that

participates in the shocking circuit. ICDs detect ventricular arrhythmias via a small bipolar electrode at the tip of the lead. Detection rates for ventricular arrhythmia are set by the operator via a radiofrequency communication link. ICDs have two ways of responding to ventricular arrhythmia. They can be programmed to deliver antitachycardia pacing or ATP, which will deliver a burst of pacing to the ventricle slightly faster than the cycle length of the ventricular tachycardia. ATP offers the possibility of terminating the arrhythmia without delivering a potentially painful shock to the patient. If ATP is unsuccessful or if the arrhythmia is rapid enough to exceed programmed parameters, the device can also deliver a shock to terminate the tachycardia. ICDs can be implanted in the EP lab with the same anesthetic regimens as pacemakers. If patients requiring ICDs are clinically fragile they may benefit from anesthesiology oversight.

Both pacemakers and ICDs can provide Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy. In patients with low ejection fraction > 35% and ventricular dysynchrony, pacing of both ventricles simultaneously can improve heart failure symptoms. Patients who come to the EP lab for an upgrade or implantation of a device for this purpose frequently manifest the clinical signs of chronic low perfusion. Sedation regimens must be tailored to these individuals and/or anesthesiology backup may be needed.

Electrocautery can produce electromagnetic interference that can alter the appropriate function of both pacemakers and ICDs. This can be a significant problem in the operating room. Electrocautery "noise" can initiate pacemaker failure. In the case of ICDs, electrocautery "noise" can cause inappropriate detection of ventricular arrhythmia and inappropriate delivery of shocks. Both pacemakers and ICDs have their function altered in response to magnet application. This is achieved by a reed switch which moves in response to magnet application and then returns to its original position after the magnet is removed. Pacemakers respond to magnet application by pacing in an asynchronous mode (AOO, VOO, or DOO) at a rate which is related to the remaining battery life. For ICDs, the effect of magnet application is to turn off detection for ventricular arrhythmias. No effect on pacing occurs. If a patient with an ICD is pacemaker dependent,

their device may require reprogramming in addition to magnet application for safe performance of a surgical procedure involving electrocautery.

# ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY STUDIES AND ABLATION PROCEDURES

Common indications for electrophysiology study include risk stratification for sudden death, determination of cause of syncope, diagnosis and treatment of supraventricular tachycardias, as well as diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic ventricular tachycardias. Standard electrophysiology studies are typically performed under light conscious sedation, though in the pediatric population these are sometimes performed under general anesthesia. EP studies typically require femoral vein access, occasionally bilateral. Arterial access or transseptal puncture is performed to reach left-sided structures. In an electrophysiology study, solid multi-electrode catheters are used to measure electrical impulses during sinus rhythm and arrhythmia from stereotyped locations, including the right atrium, the RV, and the His bundle. For supraventricular tachycardia ablation, a catheter is often also positioned in the coronary sinus. Radiofrequency energy is the most commonly used ablation modality, though cryoablation is also used.

Catheter Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia. It is the most common contributor to cerebrovascular accident in the United States. Risk factors for developing atrial fibrillation include older age, hypertension, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, obesity, sleep apnea, and CAD. There are also metabolic causes including hyperthyroidism and acute alcohol intoxication. Other diseases or conditions that cause cardiac irritation such as pericardial status or pneumonia can play a role. In 1998 Dr. Haïssaguerre and colleagues showed that atrial fibrillation in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and frequent atrial ectopy had rapid firing from myocardial sleeves around pulmonary veins that could initiate atrial fibrillation.<sup>158</sup> It is now understood that many patients with atrial fibrillation have at least a contribution from these myocardial sleeves in the pulmonary veins which remain a primary target for typical atrial fibrillation ablation. For patients with more persistent atrial fibrillation, other areas are also targeted, including some lines of ablation such as the roof, mitral isthmus, in an attempt to mimic the results of the Cox MAZE procedure.

Success rates for catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation are in the 80% range for patients with normal hearts, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. For patients with low ejection fractions or heart failure, success rates are closer to 50 to 70%. The procedure is improving with better anticoagulation and ablation techniques. Complications are in the 1 to 2% range and include a risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, tamponade, atrial esophageal fistula, pulmonary vein stenosis, pericarditis, and phrenic nerve injury. Many centers utilize esophageal temperature monitoring to avoid esophageal injury during ablation which can be life-threatening. Phrenic nerve injury can also occur during the procedure. Pacing is used

to identify the phrenic nerve and avoid injury. Ablation for atrial fibrillation is usually performed under general anesthesia. Multiple anesthetic protocols can be used, but paralysis must be avoided in order to avoid obscuring phrenic nerve injury. Anesthetic regimens should involve short acting agents since pain after the procedure is minimal and can usually be managed with nonsteroidals. Because these procedures can be long, patients often experience discomfort from lying on a hard table for long periods of time. Common comorbidities among patients with atrial fibrillation include obesity and sleep apnea, although many are otherwise healthy. Intubation and extubation require care and expertise. Care must be taken to avoid coughing at the end of the procedure to minimize potential disruption of femoral access sites and retroperitoneal bleeding. <sup>159</sup>

Ventricular Tachycardia Ablation in Structural Heart Disease. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) in structural heart disease is a highly morbid condition that is associated with inappropriate device discharges, and life-threatening VT storm.160 Successful catheter ablation can eliminate the need for toxic antiarrhythmic drugs, and can be life-saving particularly in VT storm. Ventricular tachycardia in the setting of structural heart disease is usually the result of reentry circuits which form around regions of scar tissue. Electro-anatomic barriers to conduction due to dense fibrosis form in zones of slow conduction. Patients with scar-related VT can have ischemic heart disease due to myocardial infarction which may be remote. Cardiomyopathies due to sarcoidosis, Chagas disease, idiopathic cardiomyopathy, or viral cardiomyopathy occur as well. All of these conditions have other systemic effects as well. Scar-related VT due to prior cardiac surgery is also seen often after repair of congenital heart disease such as Tetralogy of Fallot.

Catheter ablation of scar-related VT requires thorough preoperative preparation and planning. Interdisciplinary discussion is critical because the patients can be quite tenuous. Anesthesiologists, electrophysiologists, and cardiac surgeons should be aware of the potential for possible untoward events. Echocardiography is used to screen for mobile LV thrombus. Heart failure regimens are optimized. Screening for residual ischemic heart disease is often performed. These patients are also often complex and have many comorbidities. Planning is necessary for intraprocedural and postprocedural management of other concomitant disease, including vascular, pulmonary, and renal disease. This type of ablation is typically done under general anesthesia. Often vasoactive agents are needed, and induction of anesthesia requires planning for potential arrhythmia management during airway manipulation. Invasive lines may be required prior to induction of the arrhythmia so that hemodynamic and fluid management can be optimized. If the patient's ventricular function is severely compromised, adjuvant inotropic, intra-aortic balloon pumping or percutaneous LVADs may be needed. 159 Anesthesiologist and electrophysiologists should both be involved in making planning decisions including when and how to decide on admission to ICU, postprocedure ventilation, and extubation parameters. A plan for the approach to the ventricles is made and should be discussed with all team members. The LV can be accessed via a retrograde aortic or transseptal approach. Epicardialsubxiphoid percutaneous puncture is often also employed. For patients in whom neither of these approaches is possible, surgical approaches to the epicardium as well as transcoronary alcohol approaches can be utilized. The procedure itself usually consists of identification of the relevant scar substrate, induction of the clinical arrhythmia, confirmation of the location of the VT circuit by pacing, and ablation of the slow conduction areas.

# Structural Heart Disease in the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory

The breadth of structural heart conditions now amenable to treatment in the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory has expanded enormously in the past decade. This is a direct result of both technological advancement and an age-related increase in the size of target patient populations. Not only is the prevalence of age-related disease on the increase, but the long-term survival of surgically treated patients and congenital heart disease patients makes the advent of nonsurgical interventions preferable in a group where surgical options may be limited.

#### CLOSURE OF PATENT FORAMEN OVALE

Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a common condition estimated to be present in 25% of the population. However, the vast majority of patients with PFO have no related clinical issues. Clinical conditions that may arise as a result of the present of a PFO include paradoxical embolism resulting in neurological injury, myocardial infarction, renal or mesenteric infarction, or limb ischemia. A PFO may also result in abnormal right to left shunting in patients with alterations in chest anatomy associated with kyphoscoliosis or after surgery resulting in positional hypoxemia also known as platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome. At the present time, there is no FDA approved indication for PFO closure as clinical trials in patients with neurological events have not definitively shown benefit. 161,162 However, PFO closure is still performed in specific patients who experience neurological events or in patients with platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome.

PFO closure requires femoral venous access for device delivery. Ultrasound guidance is required and can be achieved by intracardiac ultrasound (ICE) or TEE. If ICE is used, a second femoral venous access site is required for the delivery of the catheter. If TEE is to be utilized, patients are usually placed under general anesthesia for airway protection and comfort during the procedure. Patients undergoing PFO closure usually do not experience hemodynamic compromise, and short-acting anesthetics are advisable since post-op intubation is not usually required. The decision to use ICE versus TEE depends on comfort level of the implanting physician with either modality. ICE does have the advantage of not requiring general anesthesia and allowing the implanting

physician to control image acquisition. TEE has the advantage of greater breadth of visualization of cardiac structures.

The procedure usually does not require hemodynamic assessment as these defects are not hemodynamically significant and usually do not result in left to right shunting. The defect is crossed using any of a variety of catheters and a stiff wire is delivered to the left upper pulmonary vein. The delivery sheath is then advanced to the left atrium and the device is delivered attached to a delivery catheter. The left atrial side of the device is opened, the device pulled back to the intraatrial septum, and then the right atrial side of the device is deployed. Once the position is confirmed by fluoroscopy and echocardiography, the device is released from the delivery cable. At the present time, there are no FDA approved devices for PFO closure. Devices that can be used for this purpose include the St. Jude Cribriform Septal Occluded (St. Jude Medical, Minneapolis, MN) or the Gore Helix septal occluder (Gore, Newark, DE).

#### ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT

Atrial septal defect (ASD) is a much less common condition than PFO. The adult with ASD is referred for closure if they demonstrate symptoms of dyspnea or exercise intolerance, or they have evidence of right heart volume overload due to left to right shunt which is usually detected by enlargement of right heart structures on echocardiography. Percutaneous closure of ASD is the treatment of choice for ostium secundum defects. Ostium primum and sinus venosus defects require surgical closure as placement of a septal occluder device may impinge on vital adjacent structures.

Like PFO closure, ASD closure can be performed using ICE or TEE. Echocardiography is vital for device sizing. Once femoral access is obtained, right heart catheterization is performed to assess hemodynamics and shunt fraction across the defect. The defect is then crossed and occluded with a sizing balloon until color flow across the defect ceases. The waist of this balloon is then measured on echo for estimation of defect size and device size selection. Echocardiography is also vital for device placement and ensuring proper position of the device prior to releasing it from the delivery system and to ensure that nearby structures including the MV, tricuspid valve, inferior/superior vena cava have not been compromised by the placement of the device. General anesthesia is commonly utilized for these cases. Because patients develop right heart volume overload, close hemodynamic monitoring during the case is necessary. Arrhythmias are not uncommon in this population. Short-acting anesthetics are preferred, post-op intubation is usually not required. At the present time, there are two devices approved for ASD closure, the Amplatzer Atrial Septal Occluder (ASO) (St. Jude Medical, Minneapolis, MN) and the Gore Helix septal occluder (Gore, Newark, DE).

#### VENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT

Ventricular septal defect can be congenital or acquired. Adult cardiac catheterization labs more typically see acquired VSD

in the setting of ventricular septal rupture after myocardial infarction or as a result of trauma. Acquired VSD closure in the catheterization lab can be a very challenging procedure. Patients are critically ill, often decompensated and require intubation. In most cases, the percutaneous option is a salvage procedure. Patients with acute rupture are felt to be poor candidates for surgical repair. VSD closure requires accessing and crossing the defect which can be difficult. Precise visualization can be challenging as collateral structures are often disrupted and hard to identify. TEE guidance may be required for three-dimensional visualization. Venous access can be obtained from the right internal jugular approach or right femoral approach if the defect is to be crossed from the right heart. If the defect is to be crossed from the left heart, some operators choose to take the transseptal approach to left heart access and defect crossing. Once the defect is crossed, a wire is advanced to the other side of the circulation, and the wire is snared from an alternative access site, usually the femoral artery. The wire is retracted out of the sheath and secured, allowing the wire to serve as a rail for device delivery, which can be challenging given the tortuosity involved. There is no ideal device for acquired VSD closure and the device chosen is generally based on the location and perceived shape of the device. Closure of congenital defects is generally an elective procedure with similar techniques used for defect crossing and device delivery. A variety of VSD occluders are available for this purpose.

Anesthetic management during traumatic VSD repair can be complex and extremely demanding. It involves hemodynamic compensation during manipulation required to place and deploy the closure device. Oxygenation may be an issue and patients can present in shock. For closure, more than one device may be required because the integrity of the diseased tissue is poor. Procedures can be long. Vasoactive agents are commonly needed, and post-op intubation is usually required. Although the incision of an open heart procedure is not needed, the circulatory status of the patient is usually severely compromised and the cardiac tissue is in suboptimal condition.

#### PARA-VALVULAR LEAK

Patients with significant para-valvular leak (PVL) of mitral or aortic valve prostheses who are not candidates for repeat cardiac surgery are referred to the catheterization laboratory for attempt at closure of the defect. These can be the most challenging procedures due to complexities involved in crossing the defect, delivering a closure device, and obtaining a reasonable seal of the defect with the device.

PVL closure is elective. However, patients can be compromised by their pathology. Given the potential length of the procedure as well as the importance of TEE guidance, patients usually receive general endotracheal anesthesia. Three-dimensional TEE has become an important adjunct to this procedure as it allows the operator to see where the defect is along the sewing ring of the valve, and to accurately direct guidewires across the defect. Mitral prosthesis defects are approached by obtaining transseptal access to the

left atrium, and crossing the defect into the LV. Aortic prosthesis defects are approached retrograde by gaining access in the femoral artery and crossing from aorta to LV. Once the defect is crossed, the guidewire is snared and externalized via an arterial sheath. The wire is secured and serves as a rail over which a delivery catheter can be delivered. The defect is sized with a balloon and an appropriately sized occluder device is placed across the defect. A variety of closure devices can be used to cross the defect and occlude it. There is no ideal closure device for this purpose as these defects are generally crescentic and irregularly shaped. Post-device closure assessment with TEE is vital to assess residual leak and need for further devices as well as to ensure that prosthetic valve function is not hampered by the presence of the closure device.

#### **AORTIC VALVE DISEASE**

As the population ages, a greater number of patients are presenting with severe, symptomatic AS. Once a patient with severe AS becomes symptomatic, there is a rapid decline in functional status and development of congestive heart failure. If not corrected, the condition will ultimately be lethal within several years. Surgical AVR is the standard of care for severe AS; however, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is now an option for some patients. Based on recent clinical trials, TAVR is now indicated for patients who are deemed inoperable or high risk for standard surgical AVR. High risk is defined as having a Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score of >8%. 163-166 There are several possible routes of access for TAVR with the preferred route being transfemoral access. However, in patients with inadequate femoral access, alternative routes can be considered, including trans-apical, direct trans-aortic, and subclavian access. Depending on the institution and route of access, TAVR can be performed in the catheterization lab or a hybrid catheterization laboratory/operating room.

In patients who are in need for urgent or emergent aortic valve intervention but are not acutely candidates for surgery or TAVR, balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) may be performed to relieve the obstruction across the aortic valve and improve hemodynamics allowing the patient to recover from their acute illness. The durability of the result is limited, however, and if deemed appropriate candidates, these patients will go to need definitive aortic valve therapy.

Most TAVR procedures are performed under general anesthesia with TEE guidance; however there is a growing experience with performing transfemoral procedures under heavy sedation and TTE assessment. Given the potential for acute instability, however, these procedures are virtually uniformly performed in collaboration with anesthesia independent of the method of sedation. Echocardiography is not critical for guidance of the device placement but is necessary post-device placement to assess for complications including PVL, valve dysfunction, and pericardial effusion. For transfemoral TAVR, careful femoral access is critical as the delivery sheaths used for the procedure range in size from 14Fr to 20Fr depending on the device and size of device used. Once the diseased valve is crossed with a guidewire, a balloon dilation

of the valve may be performed depending on the device that will be used. The device is then deployed using fluoroscopic guidance and aortography.

There are two devices approved for TAVR at this time, the Sapien XT device (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) and the CoreValve device (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN). The Sapien XT device is a balloon expandable device. Once positioned, rapid pacing is initiated to essentially cease cardiac output and ensure valve stability during deployment. The CoreValve device is a self-expanding prosthesis that is positioned across the valve and opened by "de-sheathing" the valve in position. Rapid pacing may be utilized during the most critical portion of delivery but usually at rates of 110 beats per minute.

TEE is performed to determine if placement is appropriate and to assess PVL. Findings may guide operators to perform an additional balloon dilation to reduce PVL or perhaps consider the placement of a second device. 167 At the conclusion of the procedure, the delivery sheath is removed and the access site closed, usually with a suture-mediated closure device that is deployed in the artery prior to sheath delivery. For patients who have insufficient transfemoral access for TAVR, alternative access sites can be used. The Sapien XT device can be delivered via a direct trans-aortic approach or a trans-apical approach. The CoreValve device can be delivered via a direct trans-aortic approach. Each of these alternative access sites require surgical access and are therefore performed under general anesthesia in a hybrid catheterization laboratory/operating room suite.

#### MITRAL VALVE DISEASE

The treatment of choice for rheumatic MS is balloon mitral valvotomy (BMV) in appropriate patients. Suitability for BMV is based on the degree of leaflet mobility, leaflet calcification, subvalvular apparatus calcification, and degree of MR. Successful BMV has a long-term outcome that is similar to surgical repair; however it is not a commonly performed procedure in developed nations as the incidence of rheumatic fever is low. BMV for rheumatic MS can be performed under conscious sedation, as echocardiography is not usually required for the performance for this procedure. However, some operators prefer the use of general anesthesia and TEE for the procedure and it may be required in patients with respiratory compromise. TEE allows for direct visualization of the intra-atrial septum during the transseptal puncture. TEE also allows for direct assessment of post-BMV MR. The procedure requires femoral vein access for balloon catheter delivery and femoral arterial access for placement of a pigtail catheter in the LV to allow for simultaneous left atrium/ ventricle pressure measurement to assess the trans-mitral gradient post-BMV. Transseptal puncture is performed and the appropriately sized balloon is advanced across the septum and MV. The balloon is inflated and then removed. Gradients are then measured to assess adequacy of the result.

The Mitra-Clip (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA) is FDA approved for patients with severe symptomatic degenerative MR who are deemed high risk or inoperable for surgical MV

repair/replacement.<sup>168</sup> This procedure requires general anesthesia and TEE guidance. The clip is usually placed on the middle anterior (A2) and posterior (P2) segments of the MV, thereby mimicking the effect provided by an Alfieri stitch of the MV, although more than one clip may be necessary. Transseptal puncture is first performed for left atrial access. The device is then delivered into the left atrium and across the MV for echo-guided deployment.

## **Potential Complications**

#### **EP LAB**

Any procedure which involves the introduction of wires into the heart or great vessels incurs a risk of perforation of those structures. RV perforation can occur during pacemaker implantation as well as during radiofrequency ablation. Extraction of any hardware can cause perforation as well. Retroperitoneal hematomas can also occur, as well as pneumothoraces. Vigilance is essential on the part of electrophysiologists, anesthesiologists, and consulting surgeons. It is important to remember that some EP labs are located at a distance from the operating rooms, and transport of a rapidly decompensating patient can be difficult.

#### CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION LAB

Unique risks associated with PFO/ASD closure include device malposition and/or embolization. Given the small size of most PFOs, this is a very rare complication. While also rare with ASD closure, there is a higher risk of this complication with very large defects or defects with deficient rims of atrial tissue that may not allow the device to hold onto the intra-atrial septum. Once the device is deployed, it is still retrievable if positioning or sizing is not satisfactory. Careful TEE assessment is warranted to ensure proper device seating and maintenance of integrity of nearby structures, including the mitral/tricuspid valves, coronary sinus, and vena cavae. If device embolization occurs, the device can generally be retrieved using percutaneous techniques. Rarely, however, surgical extraction may be required. Other complications include air embolism resulting in temporary coronary ischemia. Vascular complications are uncommon when access involves only venous structures.

Patients referred for acquired VSD/PVL closure are usually acutely or chronically ill with multiple comorbidities and are usually already deemed poor surgical candidates prior to referral for the procedure. Their comorbidities increase their risk for complications associated with the procedure and anesthesia. The transseptal puncture is one potential complication point of the procedure. An inappropriately performed puncture may result in aortic perforation or pericardial effusion. The risk of these complications is reduced with echocardiographic guidance. Device embolization is a risk of both of these procedures. Like with PFO/ASD devices, they can be retrieved using percutaneous techniques. In the event of inability to retrieve, these patients will likely not be candidates for surgical retrieval.

There are several points of risk during TAVR. For transfemoral TAVR, careful and safe femoral access is critical due to the size of the sheaths that will be used for the procedure. An inappropriate puncture site can increase the risk of retroperitoneal hematoma or inability to close the access site at the conclusion of the procedure. Attempts to place a delivery sheath in a femoral/iliac of borderline size could result in arterial dissection, or rupture which can be fatal. Both sheath insertion and removal are critical points for complications. During balloon valvuloplasty and valve deployment, patients can experience severe hemodynamic impairment. Since the Sapien XT requires deployment during rapid pacing, recovery of heart rate and contractile function can be compromised if the patient has poor cardiac reserve or severe un-revascularized coronary artery disease. The CoreValve procedure also results in brief severe hypotension during the point where the native aortic valve is obstructed and the prosthetic aortic valve has not fully opened. Annular rupture has been reported with both devices. Risk factors for annular rupture include severe LV outflow tract calcium, device oversizing, and balloon post-dilation. Annular rupture will likely be immediately fatal with little time for surgical repair. However, contained rupture can occur and the decision to proceed to operative repair needs to be made in real-time with the cardiac surgeon involved in the case. Para-valvular leak after valve deployment needs to be assessed carefully with TEE/ TTE, aortography, and/or hemodynamics. Trace and mild PVL is generally of no concern. But moderate to severe leak can occur in up to 10% of cases. Treatment of these leaks usually requires additional post-dilation or the placement of a second prosthesis. PVL rarely results in acute hemodynamic issues, but may limit the benefit of the TAVR. Moderate to severe PVL is associated with worse long-term mortality after TAVR. It is prudent to assess for the presence of a pericardial effusion post-TAVR as perforation can occur following temporary pacemaker placement.
