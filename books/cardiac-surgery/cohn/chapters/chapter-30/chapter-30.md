### FUNCTIONAL ANATOMY OF THE AORTIC VALVE

The aortic valve is a complex structure that is best described as a functional and anatomic unit, the aortic root. The aortic root has four components: aortoventricular junction or aortic annulus, aortic cusps, aortic sinuses, and sinotubular junction. In addition, the triangles beneath the commissures of the aortic valve, although part of the left ventricular outflow tract, are also important for valve function.

The aortic annulus unites the aortic cusps and aortic sinuses to the left ventricle. It is attached to ventricular myocardium (interventricular septum) in approximately 45% of its circumference and to fibrous structures (anterior leaflet of the mitral valve and membranous septum) in the remaining 55% (Fig. 30-1). The aortic annulus has a scalloped shape. Histologic examination of the aortic annulus reveals that it is a fibrous structure with strands attaching itself to the muscular interventricular septum and has a fibrous continuity with the mitral valve and membranous septum. The fibrous structure that separates the aortic annulus from the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve is the intervalvular fibrous body. An important structure immediately below the membranous septum is the bundle of His. The atrioventricular node lies in the floor of the right atrium between the annulus of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve and the coronary sinus. This node gives origin to the bundle of His, which travels through the right fibrous trigone along the posterior edge of the membranous septum to the muscular interventricular septum. At this point, the bundle of His divides into left and right bundle branches that extend subendocardially along both sides of the muscular interventricular septum.

The aortic cusps are attached to the aortic annulus in a scalloped fashion (see Fig. 30-1). The aortic cusps have a semilunar shape whereby the length of the base is approximately 1.5 times longer than the length of the free margin, as illustrated in Fig. 30-2. There are three cusps and three aortic sinuses: left, right, and noncoronary. The aortic sinuses are also referred to

as sinuses of Valsalva. The left coronary artery arises from the left aortic sinus and the right coronary artery arises from the right aortic sinus. The left coronary artery orifice is closer to the aortic annulus than is the right coronary artery orifice. The highest point where two cusps meet is called the commissure, and it is located immediately below the sinotubular junction. The scalloped shape of the aortic annulus creates three triangular spaces underneath the commissures. The two triangles beneath the commissures of the noncoronary cusp are fibrous structures, whereas the triangular space beneath the commissure between the left and right cusps is mostly muscular. These three triangles are seen in Fig. 30-1. The aortic annulus evolves along three horizontal planes within a cylindrical structure. Thus, the annulus of each cusp inserts itself in the aortic root along a single horizontal plane. The sinotubular junction represents the end of the aortic root. It is an important component of the aortic root because the commissures of the aortic valve are immediately below it and changes in the diameter of the sinotubular junction affect the function of the aortic

The geometry of the aortic root and its anatomic components varies among individuals, but the geometry of these components is somewhat interrelated. For instance, the larger the aortic cusps, the larger are the diameters of the aortic annulus and sinotubular junction. The aortic cusps are semilunar (crescent shape) and their bases are attached to the annulus; the free margins extend from commissure to commissure, and the cusps coapt centrally during diastole. The size of the aortic cusps varies among individuals and within the same person, but as a rule the noncoronary cusp is slightly larger than the right and left. The left is usually the smallest of the three. Because of the crescent shape of the aortic cusps and the fact that their free margins extend from commissure to commissure, the diameter of the aortic valve orifice must be smaller than the length of the free margins. Indeed, anatomic studies of fresh human aortic roots demonstrated that the average length of the free margins of the aortic cusps was one-third longer than the diameter of the aortic orifice.

The diameter of the aortic annulus is 15 to 20% larger than the diameter of the sinotubular junction in children, but this relationship changes with age and the diameter of the aortic annulus is often smaller than the diameter of aortic annulus in older persons (see Fig. 30-2).

The aortic annulus, the aortic cusps, and the sinotubular junction play an important role in maintaining valve competence. On the other hand, the aortic sinuses play no role in valve competence, but they are believed to be important in minimizing mechanical stress on the aortic cusps during the cardiac cycle by creating eddies currents between the cusps and the aortic sinuses.

All components of the aortic root are very elastic and compliant in children but compliance decreases with aging as elastic fibers are replaced by fibrous tissue. Expansion and contraction of the aortic annulus during the cardiac cycle are heterogeneous probably because of its attachments to contractile myocardium as well as to fibrous structures such as the membranous septum and intervalvular fibrous body. On the other hand, the expansion and contraction of the sinotubular junction are more uniform. The aortic root also displays

**FIGURE 30-2** Geometric relationships of various components of the aortic root. The base of the aortic cusp is 1.5 times longer than its free margin. The diameter of the aortic annulus is 10 to 15% larger than the diameter of the sinotubular junction in children and young adults but it tends to become equal with aging. Three semilunar cusps seal the aortic orifice. The height of the cusps must be longer than the radius of the aortic annulus.

some degree of torsion during isovolumic contraction and ejection of the left ventricle. The movements of the aortic annulus, cusps, sinuses, and sinotubular junction also change with aging as elastic fibers are replaced by fibrous tissue.

#### **AORTIC VALVE PATHOLOGY**

Anatomically normal aortic cusps may become calcified late in life and cause aortic stenosis. This type of lesion is called dystrophic calcification, senile calcification, or degenerative calcification. The range of histopathologic lesions includes calcification, chondroid and osseous metaplasia, neorevascularization, inflammation, and lipid deposition.

Bicuspid aortic valve is estimated to occur in 0.5% to 1.5% of the population.1 Males are affected more than females at a ratio of 4:1. There is a relatively high incidence of familial clustering, which suggests an autosomal dominant inheritance with reduced penetrance.2 Extensive research in the genetics of bicuspid aortic valve is being presently conducted and this disorder is likely heritable. Most patients with bicuspid aortic valve have three aortic sinuses and two cusps of different sizes. The larger cusp often contains a raphe instead of a commissure. The raphe extends from the mid portion of the cusp to the aortic annulus, and its insertion in the aortic root is at a lower level than the other two commissures. Bicuspid aortic valves with two aortic sinuses and no raphe are least common and called "type 0"; the most common is with one raphe and is called "type 1"; and finally with two raphes is "type 2." Types 1 and 2 can be subclassified according to the fused cusps: L-R is the most common form (a raphe in between the left and right cusps). Most patients with bicuspid aortic valves have a dominant circumflex artery and a small right coronary artery. Bicuspid aortic valve may function satisfactorily until late in life when it may become calcified and stenotic.4 It may also become incompetent, particularly in younger patients and is often associated with dilated aortic annulus and prolapsed cusp.

Other congenital anomalies of the aortic valve are the unicuspid and quadricuspid valves. Subaortic membranous ventricular septal defect can cause aortic insufficiency because of distortion of the aortic annulus and prolapse of the right cusp.

Numerous connective tissue disorders (ankylosing spondylitis, osteogenesis imperfecta, rheumatoid arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, lupus, etc.) can cause aortic insufficiency. The anorexigenic drugs phentermine and fenfluramine can also cause aortic insufficiency. Rheumatic aortic valve disease is still prevalent in developing countries and can cause aortic stenosis and/or insufficiency by causing fusion, fibrosis, and contraction of the cusps.

## AORTIC ROOT AND ASCENDING AORTA PATHOLOGY

Degenerative diseases of the media with aneurysm formation are the most common disorders of the aortic root and ascending aorta. A broad spectrum of pathologic and clinical entities is grouped under degenerative disorders, and it ranges from severe degeneration of the media, which can become clinically important early in life in cases such as Loyes-Dietz syndrome, to cases of the not so important mild dilation of the ascending aorta in elderly patients. Bicuspid and unicuspid aortic valve disease often display premature degeneration of the media with dilation of the aorta. Atherosclerosis, infectious and noninfectious aortitis are other pathologic entities.

Aneurysms of the ascending aorta are often caused by cystic medial degeneration (cystic medial necrosis). Histologically, necrosis and disappearance of muscle cells in the elastic lamina, and cystic spaces filled with mucoid material are often observed. Although these changes occur more often in the ascending aorta, they may affect any portion or the entire aorta. These changes weaken the arterial wall, which dilates and forms a fusiform aneurysm. The aortic root may be involved in this pathologic process, and in patients with Marfan syndrome, the aneurysm usually begins in the aortic sinuses. A large proportion of patients with aortic root aneurysms do not fulfill the criteria of diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, but the gross appearance of the aneurysm and the histology of the arterial wall may be indistinguishable from that of Marfan syndrome. These cases are referred to as forma frusta of Marfan syndrome.

Patients with aortic root aneurysms are usually in their second or third decade of life when the diagnosis is made. These patients develop aortic insufficiency because of dilation of the sinotubular junction and/or aortic annulus (Fig. 30-3). Annuloaortic ectasia is a term used to describe dilation of the aortic annulus.

Other patients have relatively normal aortic roots but develop ascending aortic aneurysms. These patients are usually in their fifth or sixth decade of life. Finally, certain

**FIGURE 30-3** Dilation of the sinotubular junction causes aortic insufficiency because it displaces the commissures outward and prevents the cusps to coapt centrally.

patients have extensive degenerative disease of the entire aorta and develop the so-called mega-aorta syndrome with dilation of the entire thoracic and abdominal aorta. Ascending aortic aneurysm may cause dilation of the sinotubular junction with consequent aortic insufficiency (Fig. 30-3).

#### Marfan Syndrome

Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant variably penetrant inherited disorder of the connective tissue in which cardiovascular, skeletal, ocular, and other abnormalities may be present to a variable degree. The prevalence is estimated to be around 1 in 5000 individuals. It is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes fibrillin-1 (FBN1) on chromosome 15. This is a large gene (approximately 10,000 nucleotides in the mRNA), and identification of the mutation is a complex task. More than 1000 mutations in FBN1 have been identified. The phenotype presents a highly variable degree because of varying genotype expression.

The clinical features of Marfan syndrome were thought to be a result of weaker connective tissues caused by defects in fibrillin-1, a glycoprotein, and principal component of the extracellular matrix microfibril. This concept was inadequate to explain the overgrowth of long bones, osteopenia, reduced muscular mass, and adiposity and craniofacial abnormalities often seen in Marfan syndrome.<sup>5</sup> Dietz and colleagues<sup>5,6</sup> showed in an experimental mouse with Marfan syndrome that many findings are the result of abnormal levels of activation of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), a potent stimulator of inflammation, fibrosis, and activation of certain matrix metalloproteinases, especially matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9. Excess TGF-β activation in tissues correlates with failure of lung septation, development of a myxomatous mitral valve, and aortic root dilation in mice. This combination of structural microfibril matrix abnormality, dysregulation of matrix homeostasis mediated by excess TGF-β, and abnormal cell-matrix interactions is responsible for the phenotype features of the Marfan syndrome. Ongoing destruction of the elastic and collagen lamellae and medial degeneration result in progressive dilation of the aortic root, as well as a predisposition to aortic dissection from the loss of appropriate medial layer support. Loss of elasticity in the media causes increased aortic stiffness and decreased distensibility.

The diagnosis of Marfan syndrome is made on clinical grounds, and it is not always simple because of the variability in clinical expression. A multidisciplinary approach is needed to diagnose and manage patients afflicted with this syndrome. The revised Ghent criteria to diagnose Marfan syndrome is summarized in Table 30-1.<sup>7</sup> The most common cardiovascular features are aortic root aneurysm and mitral valve prolapse. These anatomical abnormalities may cause aortic rupture, aortic dissection, aortic insufficiency, and mitral insufficiency.

### Loeys-Dietz Syndrome

![](_page_3_Picture_2.jpeg)

### TABLE 30-1: Revised Ghent Criteria for Diagnosis of Marfan Syndrome

In the absence of family history the diagnosis of Marfan is confirmed with:

- 1. Aortic root dilatation ( $Z \ge 2$ ) or dissection + ectopialentis
- 2. Aortic root dilatation ( $Z \ge 2$ ) or dissection + FBN1 mutation
- Aortic root dilatation (Z ≥ 2) or dissection + systemic manifestations (≥7 points)
- 4. Ectopialentis + FBN1 mutation associated with aortic dissection but without aortic root dilatation or dissection

In the presence of family history of Marfan syndrome:

- 5. Ectopialentis + family history
- 6. Systemic manifestations (≥7 points) + family history
- 7. Aortic root dilatation (Z ≥ 2 above 20 years old or ≥3 below 20 years old) + family history

Point system for Marfan syndrome:

- Wrist and thumb sign—3 (wrist or thumb separately 1 point)
- Pectus carinatum deformity—2 (pectus excavatum or chest asymmetry separately—1)
- Hindfoot deformity—2 (plain pes planus—1)
- Pneumothorax—2
- Dural ectasia—2
- Protrusioacetabuli—2
- Reduced upper segment/lower segment ratio and increased arm/height no severe scoliosis—1
- Scoliosis or thoracolumbar kyphosis—1
- Reduced elbow extension—1
- Facial features (3/5) —1 (dolichocephaly, enophthalmos, downslanting palpebral fissures, malar hypoplasia, retrognathia)
- Skin striae—1
- Myopia > 3 diopters—1
- Mitral valve prolapse (all types)—1

(Maximum total: 20 points; score ≥ 7 indicates systemic involvement)

features. On the mild end, the mutation have been found in association with presentation similar to that of the Marfan syndrome or with familial thoracic aneurysm and dissection, and on the severe end, they are associated with a complex phenotype in which aortic dissection or rupture commonly occurs in childhood.<sup>8</sup> This complex phenotype is characterized by the triad of hypertelorism, bifid uvula or cleft palate, and generalized arterial tortuosity with widespread vascular aneurysm and dissection. This phenotype has been classified as Loeys-Dietz syndrome. Affected patients have a high risk of aortic dissection or rupture at an early age and at relatively small diameters. CT angiograms should be obtained from head to pelvis.

### **Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome**

Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant inherited disorder of the connective tissue resulting from mutation of the COL3A1 gene encoding type III collagen. Spontaneous rupture without dissection of large- and

medium-caliber arteries such as the abdominal aorta and its branches, the branches of the aortic arch, and the large arteries of the limbs accounts for most deaths. Aortic root dilation was present in 28% in a series of 71 patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Aortic dissection is uncommon. Diagnosis is confirmed either by biochemical assays showing qualitative or quantitative abnormalities in type III collagen secretion or by molecular biology studies demonstrating mutation of the COL3A1 gene. Varied molecular mechanisms have been observed with different mutations in each family. No correlation has been established between genotype and phenotype. Diagnosis should be suspected in any young person presenting with arterial or visceral rupture or colonic perforation.

# Other Aortic Root Aneurysm Associated with Genetic Syndromes

Aneurysm-osteoarthritis syndrome is associated with pathogenic SMAD-3 gene and is clinically characterized by aortic root aneurysm, aortic dissection, arterial aneurysms and dissection, arterial tortuosity, mitral valve prolapse, congenital cardiac defects, and osteoarthritis, soft skin, flat feet, scoliosis and recurrent hernias.  $^{10}$  Aortic root aneurysms can also be associated with mutations of TGF $\beta$ -2 and with mutations of fibrillin-4 gene (FBLN4; cutis laxa syndrome).  $^{11,12}$ 

### Other Pathologies

Familial thoracic aneurysms can be associated with mutations of various genes (TGF $\beta$ 1-2, ACTA2, MLCK, SMAD3, TGF2) without systemic syndrome such as those described above. Atherosclerotic aneurysms of the ascending aorta are uncommon. They are more common in the abdominal aorta and to a lesser degree in the descending thoracic aorta. Atherosclerosis often causes irregular and saccular aneurysms of the ascending aorta rather than a more fusiform shape as seen with degenerative diseases.

Infectious aneurysms of the ascending aorta are rare. Syphilis was a common cause of aneurysm of the ascending aorta but it is seldom seen. The spirochetal infection destroys the muscular and elastic fibers of the media, which are replaced by fibrous and other inflammatory tissues. The ascending aorta is the most common site of involvement and the aneurysm is usually saccular. The wall of the ascending aorta is frequently calcified. Syphilitic aortitis also causes coronary ostial stenosis and aortic valve insufficiency. Other bacteria can also cause aneurysm of the ascending aorta.

Various types of aortitis may involve the ascending aorta. Giant cell arteritis is among the more common and it involves medium-sized arteries, but the aorta and its branches are involved in approximately 15% of the cases. The etiology is unknown. The characteristic lesion is a granulomatous inflammation of the media of large- and medium-caliber arteries such as the temporal artery. Occasionally the inflammatory process weakens the aorta leading to aneurysm formation, aortoannular ectasia, and aortic insufficiency.

Ankylosing spondylitis, Reiter's syndrome, psoriatic arthritis, and polyarteritis nodosa can cause aortic insufficiency because of annuloaortic ectasia. Behçet's disease can cause aneurysm of the ascending aorta.

## NATURAL HISTORY OF AORTIC VALVE DISEASE

#### **Aortic Stenosis**

Asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis have a good prognosis. <sup>13</sup> Sudden death in asymptomatic patients is uncommon. However, when symptoms develop, the prognosis becomes poor and the average survival is 2 to 3 years for patients with symptoms of angina and syncope, and 1 to 2 years for those with congestive heart failure. <sup>14</sup>

#### **Aortic Insufficiency**

The prognosis of symptomatic patients with aortic insufficiency is poor with death occurring within 4 years after development of angina and within 2 years after the onset of congestive heart failure. <sup>15</sup>

#### Bicuspid Aortic Valve Disease

A prospective follow-up on 642 adult patients (mean age 35 ± 9 years) with bicuspid aortic valve during a mean 9 ± 5 years in our institution revealed a late survival similar to that of the general population in spite the fact that 161 patients had an adverse event (cardiac death, aortic valve/ascending aorta surgery, dissection, or congestive heart failure). 16 Age greater than 30 years, and moderate or severe aortic stenosis or insufficiency were independent predictors of adverse event.<sup>16</sup> In a study from the Mayo Clinic on 212 patients (mean age 32 ± 20 years) with normal or minimally dysfunctional bicuspid aortic valve who lived in Olmsted County and followed for a mean of 15 ± 6 years revealed a 20-year survival similar to that of the general population, but the incidence of surgery on the aortic valve and/or ascending aorta was 27 ± 4% and the total adverse cardiovascular events was  $42 \pm 5\%$ .

# Aortic Root and Ascending Aortic Aneurysms

Aortic root/ascending aortic aneurysm can cause aortic insufficiency, aortic dissection, or rupture. The transverse diameter of the aneurysm is a determinant of rupture or dissection. In a study by Coady and associates<sup>17</sup> on 370 patients with thoracic aneurysms (201 ascending aortic aneurysms), during a mean follow-up of 29.4 months the incidence of acute dissection or rupture was 8.8% for aneurysms less than 4 cm, 9.5% for aneurysms of 4 to 4.9 cm, 17.8% for 5 to 5.9 cm, and 27.9% for those greater than 6 cm. The median size of the ascending aortic aneurysm at the time of rupture or dissection was 5.9 cm.

In Coady's study, the growth rate ranged from 0.08 cm/year for small (<4 cm) aneurysms to 0.16 cm/year for large (8 cm) aneurysms.<sup>17</sup> The growth rates for chronic dissecting aneurysms were much higher than for chronic nondissecting aneurysms.

The growth rates for aortic root aneurysms may be higher than in ascending aortic aneurysms, particularly in patients with Marfan syndrome. Aortic dissection is rare in aortic root aneurysm of less than 50 mm, unless the patients have family history of aortic dissection. Without surgery, most patients with Marfan syndrome die in the third decade of their lives from complications of aortic root aneurysm such as rupture, aortic dissection, or aortic insufficiency. Pregnancy in women with Marfan syndrome has two potential problems: the risk of having a child who will inherit the disorder and the risk of acute aortic dissection during the third trimester, parturition, or the first month postpartum. The offspring has a 50% risk of inheriting the syndrome.

Patients affected with Loeys-Dietz syndrome have a high risk of aortic dissection or rupture at an early age and at relatively small aortic root diameters. Surgery is recommended in adults when the aortic root exceeds 4 cm.

Patients with bicuspid aortic valve had larger aortas than patients with tricuspid aortic valve and the rate of dilation of the ascending aorta was higher (0.19 vs 0.13 cm per year, respectively) in a study by Davies et al.<sup>19</sup> Among patients with bicuspid aortic valve, those with aortic stenosis had a higher risk of rupture, dissection, or death.

### DIAGNOSIS OF AORTIC VALVE/ROOT DISEASE

Patients with aortic stenosis remain asymptomatic for many years. Symptoms usually appear late in the course of the disease. The symptoms are: angina pectoris, syncope, and congestive heart failure. The clinical presentation of patients with aortic insufficiency is dependent on the rapidity with which aortic insufficiency develops. Patients with chronic aortic insufficiency remain asymptomatic for many years while the heart slowly enlarges. Palpitations and head pounding may occur during exertion. Angina pectoris may occur, but it is not as common as with aortic stenosis. Syncope is rare. The symptoms of congestive heart failure are usually an indication of left ventricular dysfunction. Acute aortic insufficiency is frequently associated with cardiovascular collapse, with extreme fatigue, dyspnea, and hypotension resulting from reduced stroke volume and elevated left atrial pressure. Echocardiography confirms the diagnosis of aortic valve dysfunction and provides information regarding its mechanism. Radionuclide imaging is useful in assessing the left ventricular function at rest and during exercise, valuable information in asymptomatic patients.

Most patients with aortic root aneurysm are asymptomatic and have no physical signs if the aortic valve is competent. Some patients may complain of vague chest pain. Severe chest pain is suggestive of rapid expansion or intimal tear with dissection. Echocardiography establishes the diagnosis and provides information regarding the aortic cusps. A computed

tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging of the chest are also diagnostic and it is useful to provide information regarding the thoracic aorta.

#### INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY

Surgeons must be familiar with the guidelines for heart valve surgery prepared by a joint committee of the ACC and AHA $^{20}$  and for surgery for aortic root and ascending aortic aneurysm set by the STS. $^{21}$ 

## SELECTION OF PATIENTS FOR AORTIC VALVE REPAIR

Most candidates for aortic valve repair have aortic insufficiency or normally functioning aortic valve with aortic root or ascending aortic aneurysm. Transesophageal echocardiography is the best diagnostic tool to study the aortic valve and the mechanism of aortic insufficiency. Each component of the aortic root must be carefully interrogated, and in particular the aortic cusps. The number of cusps, their thickness, the appearance of their free margins, and the excursion of each cusp during the cardiac cycle must be examined in multiple views. The lines of coaptation of the aortic cusps should be interrogated by color Doppler imaging and the direction and size of the regurgitant jets recorded in multiple views. Information regarding the morphologic features of the aortic annulus, aortic sinuses, sinotubular junction, and ascending aorta should be obtained.

The aortic cusps are the most important determinant of aortic valve repair. If the cusps are thin, mobile with smooth free margins, the feasibility of aortic valve repair is very high, including bicuspid aortic valve. Calcified or scarred and fibrotic aortic cusps preclude aortic valve repair unless autologous or xenograft glutaraldehyde fixed pericardium is used for partial excision and patch repair of the cusps.

Patients with aortic root and ascending aortic aneurysms often have normal or minimally stretched aortic cusps and reconstruction of the aortic root with preservation of the native aortic cusps is feasible. Grossly dilated aortic annulus and/or sinotubular junction are likely to have overstretched, thinned out aortic cusps with stress fenestrations along the commissural areas and may not be suitable for repair.

## TECHNIQUES OF AORTIC VALVE REPAIR

### **Cusp Perforation**

Occasionally a cusp perforation is the sole reason for aortic insufficiency. The perforation may be iatrogenic, a sequelae of healed endocarditis, or the result of resection of a papillary fibroelastoma. A simple patch of fresh or glutaraldehyde fixed autologous pericardium is adequate to correct the problem. Fresh autologous pericardium can also be used to repair small holes (<5 mm) but the patch should be larger than the defect

because it retracts during healing. We use a continuous fine polypropylene to suture the patch around the defect on the aortic side of the cusp.

#### **Cusp Extension**

Cusp augmentation has been used to repair incompetent aortic valves due to rheumatic and congenital disease. Glutaral-dehyde fixed bovine or autologous pericardium has been used for this purpose.

### **Cusp Prolapse**

Cusp prolapse is caused by elongation of the free margin. This is corrected by plication along the nodule of Arantius as illustrated in Fig. 30-4. The degree of shortening is determined by examining the other cusps and their level of coaptation.

### Cusp with Stress Fenestration

Dilation of the sinotubular junction increases the mechanical stress along the free margin of the cusp near the commissures and may cause a stress fenestration with thinning and sometimes even detachment from the commissure. This type of lesion has been successfully corrected by weaving a double layer of 6-0 expanded polytetrafluoroethylene suture along the free margin of the cusp as illustrated in Fig. 30-5.

### **Bicuspid Aortic Valve**

The most commonly performed aortic valve repair in adults is for bicuspid aortic valve with prolapse of one cusp. Although the anatomic arrangement of the bicuspid aortic valve varies, most patients have an anterior cusp attached to the interventricular septum and a posterior cusp attached to the fibrous components of the left ventricular outflow tract. The anterior

**FIGURE 30-5** Reinforcement of the free margin with a double layer of 6-0 expanded polytetrafluoroethylene suture. This is often done in patients with stress fenestration.

cusp often contains a raphe at approximately where the commissure between the right and left cusps would be (Type 1, L-R). This cusp is usually the one that is elongated and prolapsed. As long as the posterior cusp is normal, repair is feasible and relatively simple. The raphe is excised and the free margin of the anterior cusp is shortened with plicating sutures as illustrated in Fig. 30-6. The lengths of the free margins of both cusps should be similar and should coapt at the same level. Suspending the arterial walls immediately above the commissures and observing the level of coaptation

of each cusp gives an estimate of the level of coaptation of the cusps.

Because most patients with incompetent bicuspid aortic valves have dilated aortic annulus, aortic valve-sparing operation may be more appropriate procedure than simple cusp repair. However, if the aortic sinuses are not aneurismal and the annulus is only mildly dilated, a reduction annuloplasty to increase the coaptation area of the cusps can be done. This is accomplished by plicating the subcommissural triangles using horizontal mattress sutures of 4-0 polypropylene with Teflon felt pledgets on the outside of the aortic root (Fig. 30-7). The suture is first passed from the outside to the inside of the aorta through the aortic annulus of both cusps 2 mm below their commissure. The same suture is passed again through the annulus and subcommissural triangle 4 or 5 mm below the first one and the ends are tied together over Teflon felt pledgets on the outside of the aorta.

### AORTIC VALVE-SPARING OPERATIONS

Aortic valve-sparing operations include various procedures used to preserve the aortic cusps in patients with aortic root aneurysm or ascending aortic aneurysm with aortic insufficiency.

#### Ascending Aortic Aneurysm with Aortic Insufficiency

Dilation of the sinotubular junction displaces the commissures of the aortic valve outward and prevents the cusps from coapting during diastole (see Fig. 30-3). These patients are often on the sixth, seventh, or eighth decade of their lives and have ascending aortic aneurysm. The dilation of the sinotubular junction is often asymmetrical, and the commissures of

![](_page_6_Picture_11.jpeg)

FIGURE 30-6 Repair of incompetent bicuspid aortic valve. The elongated cusp is shortened and the subcommissural triangles narrowed with sutures.

![](_page_7_Picture_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 30-7** Dilation of the sinotubular junction causes aortic insufficiency. Correction of the dilation with a tubular Dacron graft of appropriate diameter corrects aortic insufficiency.

noncoronary aortic cusp are more affected than the other two. If the other components of the aortic root are normal, simple adjustment of the sinotubular junction restores valve competence. This is accomplished by transecting the ascending aorta 5 mm above the sinotubular junction and pulling the three commissures upward and close to each other until the cusps coapt. The three commissures form an imaginary triangle. The diameter of a circle that contains this imaginary triangle is the diameter of the graft that should be used to reconstruct the sinotubular junction. Because the aortic cusps and sinuses have different sizes, this triangle is not always equilateral and the commissures must be spaced according to the length of the free margin of each cusp. The diameter of the graft and the space between commissures are facilitated by sizing the diameter of the circle that contains all three commissures with a transparent valve sizer, such as the one used to size the aortic annulus for a stentless porcine aortic valve. Those valve sizers have three equidistant marks, and one can determine the space between the commissures by comparing to the distance between marks. The tubular Dacron graft is sutured right at the level of the sinotubular junction with a continuous 4-0 polypropylene suture (see Fig. 30-7). If after adjusting the sinotubular junction, the cusps do not coapt at the same level, one or more cusps may be elongated and the free margin has to be shortened as illustrated in Fig. 30-4. Aortic valve competence can be tested at this time by injecting cardioplegia into the graft under pressure and observing the left ventricle for distension.

If the noncoronary aortic sinus is dilated or altered by aortic dissection, a neoaortic sinus can be created by tailoring the graft with a tongue of tissue that is sutured directly to the aortic annulus as illustrated in Fig. 30-8. The height of the

neoaortic sinus of Dacron should be 3 or 4 mm more than the diameter of the graft, and the width should be 3 or 4 mm more than the estimated intercommissural distance to allow the graft to bulge and create a neoaortic sinus.

Small diameter grafts (<24 mm) should be avoided in large adult patients because they may increase left ventricular afterload, particularly if long segments of aorta are replaced such as with concomitant transverse arch replacement using the elephant trunk technique. If the estimated diameter of the sinotubular junction is less than 24 mm, a larger graft should be used and the end that is anastomosed to the aortic root to recreate the sinotubular junction should be reduced by plicating the graft in the area of the anastomosis.

#### Aortic Root Aneurysm

A large proportion of patients with aortic root aneurysm has normal or minimally stretched aortic cusps and an aortic valve-sparing operation is feasible. There are basically two types of aortic valve-sparing operations for patients with aortic root aneurysm: remodeling of the aortic root and reimplantation of the aortic valve.<sup>22,23</sup>

### Remodeling of the Aortic Root

The ascending aorta is transected and the aortic root is dissected circumferentially down to the level of the aortic annulus. All three aortic sinuses are excised, leaving approximately 4 to 6 mm of arterial wall attached to the aortic annulus and around the coronary artery orifices as illustrated in Fig. 30-9. The three commissures are gently pulled vertically

and approximated until the cusps coapt. The three commissures form a triangle and the diameter of the circle that contains that triangle is the diameter of the graft to be used for remodeling. In our experience, most grafts are 24, 26, or 28 mm in diameter. Here again, the stentless valve sizers are very useful to determine the diameter of the graft and also the distance between commissures because they may not be equidistant. The spaces in between the commissures are marked in one of the ends of the graft, and the graft is tailored to create three neoaortic sinuses (Fig. 30-10). The heights of these neoaortic sinuses should be approximately equal to the diameter of the graft. The three commissures are suspended in the graft (Fig. 30-11), which is then sutured to the remnants of the aortic wall as close as possible to aortic annulus with continuous 4-0 polypropylene sutures. The coronary arteries are reimplanted into their respective neoaortic sinuses. The aortic cusps are inspected to make sure that all three coapt at the same level and well above the nadir of the aortic annulus. If one or more cusp is prolapsing, the free margin is shortened as described previously. If one or two cusps have stress fenestrations, the free margin should be reinforced with a double layer of a fine expanded polytetrafluoroethylene suture from commissure to commissure. Aortic valve competence can be assessed by injecting cardioplegia under pressure into the reconstructed aortic root and observing the left ventricle for distension. The graft is then anastomosed to the distal ascending aorta or transverse aortic arch graft depending on the extent of the aneurysm (Fig. 30-11).

Remodeling of the aortic root may be inappropriate for patients with aortic root aneurysms associated with genetic syndromes because it has been documented that the aortic annulus may dilate postoperatively. An aortic annuloplasty along the fibrous component of the left ventricular outflow tract<sup>18</sup> did not prevent late dilation of the aortic annulus in patients with Marfan syndrome in our experience. Thus, reimplantation of the aortic valve may be a better operative procedure for patients with annuloaortic ectasia (Fig. 30-12)

because this operative procedure corrects and prevents annular dilation, whereas remodeling of the aortic root may be more suitable for patients with normal aortic annulus.

### Reimplantation of the Aortic Valve

This procedure can be performed in all patients with aortic root aneurysms, but it is particularly valuable in patients with dilated aortic annulus and in acute type A aortic dissection. It is technically more demanding than remodeling of the aortic root because it requires greater knowledge of the functional anatomy of the aortic root. This is because the geometry of the aortic annulus, the aortic sinuses, the sinotubular junction, and even the aortic cusps are potentially altered during the procedure. In the original description of this procedure, the aortic valve was reimplanted into a tubular Dacron graft and

no neoaortic sinuses were created. Some investigators have suggested that the presence of the aortic sinuses is important for normal cusp motion, and potentially, cusp durability. Several modifications to the reimplantation procedure were introduced to create neoaortic sinuses. There is now a commercially available graft with sinuses of Valsalva (Vascutek Ltd. Renfrewshire, Scotland); however we have not used it because it distorts the aortic annulus because its sinuses are spherical, whereas the normal aortic annulus develops along a crescent shape on a single horizontal plane within a cylinder. However, this graft is used by many surgeons but the long-term results remain unknown.<sup>24</sup>

Following is a description of this procedure as we have been performing for more than two decades with excellent long-term results. The three aortic sinuses are excised as described for the remodeling procedure (see Fig. 30-9). Multiple horizontal mattress sutures of 2-0 or 3-0 polyester are passed from the inside to the outside of the left ventricular outflow tract, immediately below the nadir of the aortic annulus, through a single horizontal plane from the nadir of the left and noncoronary cusps and slightly scalloped between the subcommissural triangle of the left and right cusps and less so along the membranous septum to avoid the bundle of His as illustrated in Figure 30-13. These sutures frequently pass through right atrial wall in the area of the membranous septum and left atrial wall in the area of the sub-commissural triangle between the left and noncoronary cusps. If the fibrous portion is thin, sutures with Teflon felt pledgets should be used. A tubular Dacron graft of diameter equal to double the average height of the cusps minus 2 or 3 mm is selected and three equidistant marks placed in one

of its ends. A small triangular segment is cut off along the mark that corresponds to the subcommissural triangle of the left and right cusps. The sutures previously placed in the left ventricular outflow tract are now passed through the graft. The sutures should be spaced symmetrically in the graft if the aortic annulus is not dilated. If there is obvious dilation of the aortic annulus, the sutures should be spaced symmetrically along the muscular interventricular septum and around the nadirs of the aortic annulus but closer together beneath the subcommissural triangles of the noncoronary aortic cusp because that is where dilation occurs in patients with connective disorders. The sutures are then tied on the outside of the graft. Care must be exercised not to purse-string this suture line. The graft is then cut in a length of approximately 5 cm and pulled gently, and the three commissures are also pulled vertically and temporarily secured to the graft with transfixing 4-0 polypropylene sutures buttressed on small Teflon felt pledgets, but these sutures are not tied. Once all three commissures are suspended inside the graft, the commissures and the cusps are inspected to make sure they are all correctly aligned. The subcommissural triangles should also be inspected to make sure they are as narrow as the diameter of the graft allows, that is, the triangles should have a narrower base than before surgery. Next, the sutures are tied on the outside of the graft and used to secure the aortic annulus into the graft. This is accomplished by passing the suture sequentially from the inside to the outside right at the level of the annulus and from the outside to the inside at the level of the remnants of the arterial wall. We start at the level of the commissure and stop at the nadir of the aortic annulus where the sutures are tied together. The coronary arteries are reimplanted into their respective sinuses (Fig. 30-14). The coaptation of the aortic cusps is inspected and prolapse is corrected if necessary. It is important that the coaptation level is well above the aortic annulus. Creation of neoaortic sinuses are by plicating the graft at the level of the sinotubular junction and in between two commissures allows the aortic cusp to move a bit more centrally and increased its mobility as illustrated in Fig. 30-15. Valve competence can be assessed by occluding the distal graft and injecting cardioplegia under pressure. If the ventricle does not distend, no more than trace aortic insufficiency is present. The distal anastomosis is performed either to the distal ascending aorta or transverse aortic arch depending on the pathology. The graft sizes in our patients ranged from 26 to 34 mm, mean of 31 mm.

#### RESULTS OF AORTIC VALVE REPAIR

One of the earliest series of aortic valve repair for aortic insufficiency caused by prolapse of bicuspid aortic valve came from the Cleveland Clinic. In a series of 94 patients with a mean age of 38 years, the freedom from reoperation was 84% at 7 years. The only factor predictive of reoperation was residual aortic insufficiency at the time of repair.

The appropriateness of aortic valve repair in patients with incompetent bicuspid aortic valve remains unclear. Competent bicuspid aortic valves appear to be durable because a large

proportion of patients who require aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis in their fifth, sixth, or seventh decades of life are found to have bicuspid aortic valves. Thus, aortic valve repair for incompetent bicuspid aortic valves is a reasonable surgical approach in young adults but the best type of repair remains to be determined. Incompetent bicuspid aortic valves

are often associated with dilated aortic annulus and subcommissural plication may be inadequate to prevent future dilation and recurrent aortic insufficiency. Reimplantation of the aortic valve may provide better long-term results than simple valve repair in patients with incompetent bicuspid aortic valve and dilated aortic annulus.<sup>26</sup>

# Ascending Aortic Aneurysm with Aortic Insufficiency

We reported our experience with aortic valve repair in patients with ascending aortic aneurysm, normal or minimally dilated aortic sinuses, and moderate or severe aortic insufficiency.<sup>27</sup> There were 103 patients whose mean age was  $65 \pm 12$  years and 53% were men. The aneurysm extended into the transverse aortic arch in 60% of the patients and 20% had megaaorta syndrome. The aortic valve repair consisted in adjusting the diameter of the sinotubular junction in all patients. In addition, repair of cusp prolapse was needed in 36 patients, and replacement of the noncoronary aortic sinus in 8. Associated procedures were: replacement of the transverse aortic arch in 62 patients, coronary artery bypass in 28, and mitral valve repair or replacement in 7. The follow-up was complete at 5.8 ± 2.3 years. There were 2 operative and 30 late deaths. The survival at 10 years was 54 ± 7%. Independent predictors of late death were transverse arch aneurysm, the use of elephant trunk technique to replace the arch and mega-aorta syndrome. Only two patients required aortic valve replacement: one for endocarditis and one for severe aortic insufficiency. The freedom from aortic valve replacement at 10 years was 98%. Only one patient developed severe and six developed moderate aortic insufficiency during the followup. The freedom from severe or moderate aortic insufficiency at 10 years was 80 ± 7%. These findings suggest that aortic valve repair in these patients is an excellent alternative to valve replacement and the repair remains stable in most patients during the follow-up. Late survival was suboptimal because of the extensiveness of the vascular disease.

### Aortic Root Aneurysm

We reported our current experience with aortic valve-sparing operations for aortic root aneurysm in 371 patients.<sup>28</sup> Their mean age was 47 ± 15 years, 78% were men, 35.5% had the Marfan syndrome, 12% had type A aortic dissection, and 9% had bicuspid aortic valves. Approximately one-half of the patients had moderate or severe aortic insufficiency before surgery. The technique of remodeling of the aortic root was used in 75 patients and the reimplantation of the aortic valve in 226. The follow-up was complete at 8.9 ± 5.2 years. All patients had echocardiographic studies during the follow-up. There were 4 operative and 35 late deaths. Patients' survival at 18 years was 76.8% and approximately 10% lower than that of the general population of Ontario matched for age and gender. Age greater by 5-year increments, aortic dissection, preoperative aortic insufficiency, and left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40% were independent predictors of death.

Eighteen patients developed moderate or severe aortic insufficiency (12 reimplantation and 6 remodeling). Overall freedom from moderate or severe aortic insufficiency at 18 years was 78% and similar for both types of aortic valve-sparing operations. Ten patients required reoperation on the aortic valve (5 reimplantation and 5 remodeling) for aortic insufficiency in 8 and infective endocarditis in 2. One valve was re-repaired and 9 replaced; all patients survived reoperation. The freedom from reoperation on the aortic valve at 18 years was 94.8%. These findings suggested that aortic valve-sparing operations provide excellent long-term outcomes but there is evidence of gradual deterioration in aortic valve function during the first two decades of follow-up.

There are several other reports on long-term results of aortic valve-sparing operations with similar outcomes to those reported above but shorter follow-up.<sup>29-31</sup> Patients with bicuspid aortic valve seem to enjoy similar results as those with tricuspid aortic valve during the first decade of follow-up.<sup>31,32</sup>

Patients with aortic root aneurysm are usually on their second, third, and fourth decades of life and are frequently associated with inherited disorders such as Marfan syndrome, Loyes-Dietz syndrome, familial aneurysms, and others by the time they come to surgical attention. The aneurysm begins in the aortic sinuses and expands proximally and distally into the aortic annulus and sinotubular junction. Reimplantation of the aortic valve is ideal for these patients as well as those with incompetent bicuspid aortic and dilated aortic annulus because it corrects the annular dilatation and reshapes the aortic annulus by fixing it into the cylindrical Dacron graft. The drawback of the reimplantation procedure is that it places the aortic cusps into a noncompliant structure with consequent increase in mechanical stress on the cusps. Creation of neoaortic sinuses may reduce the mechanical stresses but it remains uncertain if improves durability.

Patients with primarily ascending aortic aneurysm may have secondarily dilated aortic sinuses but the aortic annulus remains normal. The dilatation of the aortic sinuses is often asymmetrical and the noncoronary aortic sinus is the first one to dilate, followed by the right and left. These patients are older than those with primary aortic root aneurysms and are on their fifth, sixth, and seventh decades of life. Remodeling of the aortic root is ideally suited for these patients.

Aortic valve-sparing operations are an alternative to aortic root replacement with a conduit containing a mechanical or bioprosthetic aortic valve in patients with aortic root aneurysm or ascending aortic aneurysm with dilated aortic sinuses but normal or only mildly diseased aortic cusps. When correctly performed, they provide excellent long-term results and are associated with low rates of valve-related complications. However, they are technically demanding operations and only surgeons with experience in aortic root surgery should perform them. Most failures appear to be related to technical errors.<sup>32</sup> The surgeon must have a sound knowledge of anatomy and pathology of the aortic valve and be able to apply the concepts of functional anatomy to create an anatomically and functionally satisfactory reconstructed aortic root.
