# Percutaneous Treatment of Aortic Valve Disease

Stephanie L. Mick • Lars G. Svensson

The history of percutaneous treatment of aortic valve disease began with the work of Danish researcher, H.R. Andersen, who in the late 1980s experimented in an animal lab with a balloon-expandable stented valve. The technology was later acquired by PVT Company, further developed, and later sold to Edwards. Additional early work was done by Alain Cribier<sup>2,3</sup> and subsequently the valve was adopted in the United States and further modified. The initial approach taken by Cribier was to insert the valve via the femoral vein, then snaking the catheter through the mitral valve and into the aortic annulus via transeptal puncture. This turned out to be a fairly cumbersome and difficult procedure with a fairly high mortality rate and an 8.1% stroke rate. At the same time, animal experiments were carried out by Michael Mack, Todd Dewey, and Lars Svensson,<sup>4,5</sup> using the transapical (TA) approach to insert the aortic valve. Concurrently, John Webb et al<sup>6,7</sup> were also developing a TA aortic valve method, and subsequently they introduced the retrograde transfemoral (TF) artery approach. This latter technique became feasible once Edwards developed a catheter that could be flexed to get around the aortic arch to access the aortic valve. At the same time the Edwards balloon-expandable valve was being developed, Medtronic introduced a nitinol-based, self-expanding percutaneous valve system, the CoreValve. Following feasibility studies,<sup>5,8</sup> the safety and effectiveness of both valves were established through the Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves (PARTNER) trial and the US CoreValve pivotal trial and both valves are currently approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in patients who are at extreme or high risk (owing to comorbidities or anatomical considerations) for conventional surgery in the United States.<sup>9-11</sup>

#### **VALVES**

At present in the United States, there are only two transcatheter valves approved for use in patients who are at extreme or high risk (owing to comorbidities or anatomical considerations) for conventional surgery.

The balloon-expandable Edwards valves consist of bovine pericardium fashioned into a trileaflet valve within a short cylindrical stent, available in sizes 23, 26, and 29 to treat

annular sizes from 18 to 27 mm. There are three generations of SAPIEN valves (SAPIEN, SAPIEN XT, and SAPIEN 3) that differ by stent material and construction (Fig. 33-1) as well delivery device size (Table 33-1) and other delivery device characteristics. At the time of publication, the commercially available generation is the SAPIEN XT in the United States with the SAPIEN 3 commercially available only in Europe. However, this generation is almost certain to replace the SAPIEN XT in the United States in the coming years. The SAPIEN valves can be delivered via retrograde (eg, TF, transaortic, transcarotid, transaxillary/subclavian) and antegrade (TA) approaches. The self-expanding Medtronic CoreValve is constructed of porcine pericardium mounted in a nitinol stent that anchors within the aortic annulus and extends superiorly to anchor in the ascending aorta. It is available in sizes 23, 26, 29, and 31 to fit annulus sizes 18 to 29 mm (Fig. 33-2, Table 33-1). The CoreValve can only be delivered using retrograde approaches.

#### **PIVOTAL TRIALS**

The major landmark trials in the percutaneous treatment of aortic valve disease are the PARTNER and the CoreValve Pivotal Trials. In prospective randomized fashion, the PARTNER Trial compared balloon-expandable (SAPIEN generation) transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with valve and medical management in inoperable (combined risk of serious morbidity or mortality exceeding at least 50% and two surgeons agreeing the patient was inoperable) patients in its IB cohort and with surgical valve replacement in high risk (Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) >10%) patients in its IA cohort. Likewise, the CoreValve Pivotal Trials compared self-expandable TAVR with medical and surgical treatments in similar cohorts.

# Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Versus Medical Therapy

In the PARTNER IB cohort, inoperable patients were randomly assigned to SAPIEN TAVR or medical management. TAVR was associated with improved 1- and 2-year mortality

(30.7% 1 year, 43.4% 2 year) compared with medical (including the use of balloon valvuloplasty) management (50.7% 1 year, 68% 2 year). The rate of the composite end point of death or repeat hospitalization was also reduced with TAVR (42.5 vs 71.6%). The stroke rate was significantly higher in the TAVR group than that in the medical therapy group at 30 days (6.7 vs 1.7%) and at 2 years (13.8 vs 5.5%). 10,12 It should be noted that TAVR improved survival in patients with an STS score of <15% but not in those with an STS score of ≥15%. 9

These very convincing results with the balloon-expandable valve led to the conclusion that a randomized trial comparing self-expanding (CoreValve) TAVR and medical therapy could not ethically be performed. Instead, a prospective single-arm study, the CoreValve Extreme Risk US Pivotal Trial, was used to compare CoreValve TAVR to a prespecified estimate of 12-month mortality or major stroke with medical therapy (43%).<sup>13</sup> Nearly 500 patients underwent attempted treatment with CoreValve. In those patients, the rate of all-cause mortality or major stroke at 1 year was significantly lower

Given the known dismal prognosis of nonsurgically managed severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, 14-16 it was perhaps not surprising that aortic valve replacement was found to be associated with obviously increased survival in inoperable patients. With regard to comparison of TAVR and high-risk aortic valve replacement, the differences are subtler.

# Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Versus Surgery

The PARTNER Trial found similar 30-day (3.4 and 6.5%, p = .07), 1-year (24.3 and 26.8%), and 2-year (33.9 and 35.0%) mortality rates between SAPIEN TAVR and surgical valve replacement in patients at high risk for surgery randomized to either SAPIEN TAVR or surgery.

The combined stroke and transient ischemic attack rate was more frequent in the patients assigned to TAVR at 30 days (5.5% TAVR vs 2.4% surgery, p = .04) and at 1 year (8.7% TAVR vs 4.3% surgery, p = .04). The difference was of borderline significance at 2 years (11.2 vs 6.5%, p = .05). More patients undergoing TAVR reported symptom improvement at 30 days, but at 1 year, symptom improvement was similar in the two groups. At 30 days, TAVR was associated with more frequent major vascular complications (11.0 vs 3.2%) and surgery was associated with more frequent major bleeding episodes (19.5 vs 9.3%) and new-onset atrial fibrillation (16.0 vs 8.6%). The rate of new pacemaker requirement at 30 days was similar between the TAVR and surgical groups (3.8 vs 3.6%). Moderate or severe paravalvular aortic regurgitation was more common after TAVR than surgery at 30 days, 1 year, and 2 years and, importantly, was associated with increased late mortality. 10,12

As in PARTNER, the US CoreValve High Risk Study found no difference in 30-day mortality in patients at high risk for surgery randomized to CoreValve TAVR or surgery (3.3 and 4.5%). However, unlike PARTNER, the 1-year mortality rate was lower in the CoreValve TAVR group than that in the surgical group (14.2 vs 19.1%, p < .0001 for noninferiority, p = .04 for superiority). <sup>13,17</sup> It is to be noted, that diabetes was more common in the surgery group compared with the TAVR cohort (45.4 vs 34.9%; p = .003), and this among other factors has led to questions about conclusions regarding the true survival benefit to TAVR over surgery in this trial. <sup>18</sup>

CoreValve TAVR was found to be noninferior to surgery with respect to echocardiographic indices of valve stenosis, functional status and quality of life at 1 year, and exploratory analysis suggested a reduction in the rate of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events with TAVR. Unlike PARTNER, no increase in the risk of stroke was observed with CoreValve TAVR at 30 days (4.9% TAVR, 6.2% surgery) or 1 year (8.8% TAVR, 12.6% surgery). Major vascular complications, cardiac perforation, and permanent pacemaker implantation were more frequent after CoreValve TAVR. Life-threatening/disabling hemorrhage, acute kidney injury, and new-onset or worsening atrial fibrillation were more common after surgery.

In the PARTNER 2A trial, TAVR was studied for in intermediate risk populations. There was no difference in disabling stroke but higher risk of need for permanent pacemaker and paravalvular aortic insufficiency in TAVR than in surgical valve replacement. The FDA approved TAVR for use in intermediate risk patients in August 2016. There is interest in extending TAVR to broader, low risk populations. High-quality, randomized control trials are needed prior to such extension, and the PARTNER-3 study comparing TAVR to surgical valve replacement in low-risk patients is currently underway at the time of publication of this chapter.

## COMPARISON OF CURRENTLY AVAILABLE VALVES

There is only one randomized comparison of balloon-expandable and self-expandable valves at this time. In the Comparison of Transcatheter Heart Valves in High Risk Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis: Medtronic CoreValve versus Edwards SAPIEN XT (CHOICE) trial, 241 patients undergoing TF TAVR were randomized to either the SAPIEN XT or the CoreValve device.

The primary end point of this trial was "device success," a composite end point of four components: successful vascular access and deployment of the device with retrieval of the delivery system, correct position of the device, intended performance of the valve without moderate or severe insufficiency, and only one valve implanted in the correct anatomical location.

Owing to significantly lower residual more-than-mild aortic regurgitation with the balloon-expandable valve than with the self-expanding valve (4.1 vs 18.3%, p < .001) and less frequent need for implantation of more than one valve with the balloon-expandable valve (0.8 vs 5.8%, p = .03), the balloon-expandable SAPIEN XT valve showed a significantly higher device success rate than the self-expanding CoreValve.

Placement of a permanent pacemaker also was considerably less frequent in the balloon-expandable valve group (17.3 vs 37.6%, p = .001). The all-cause mortality and stroke rate at 30 days in patients receiving either valve were similar; 1 year data are pending.<sup>19</sup>

# INSERTION OF PERCUTANEOUS VALVES: APPROACHES

Possible access routes include TF arterial, TA (not possible for CoreValve, which requires antegrade insertion), transaortic (TAo) via partial J-sternotomy or right anterior thoracotomy, <sup>20-22</sup> transcarotid, <sup>23-25</sup> and transaxillary/subclavian <sup>26,27</sup> approaches. Less commonly, TF-venous routes have been performed using either transseptal <sup>28</sup> or caval-aortic puncture. <sup>29</sup>

The TF approach has been favored as the first choice for patients in most institutions, owing to its ability to be performed in a completely percutaneous manner, at times without intubation and general anesthesia. In certain patients, for instance those with peripheral vascular disease and heavy arterial calcification, TA-TAVR has become an increasingly popular option, with outcomes similar to TF-TAVR after propensity score matching.30,31 Although a significant learning curve exists,<sup>32</sup> we have found that the procedure can be performed with minimal morbidity and mortality. For instance, in our most recent series of TA-TAVRs, we have shown a 1.2% mortality, 4.7% renal failure, 0% stroke, and 5.9% permanent pacemaker rate.<sup>33</sup> This approach can even be extended to include simultaneous treatment of multiple cardiac pathologic entities, for example, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve implantation.<sup>34-36</sup>

#### Transfemoral Approach

The approach we have used for TF insertion is to perform all procedures in a hybrid fluoroscopy operating room with a team consisting of cardiac surgeons, interventional

cardiologists, cardiac anesthesiologists, echocardiographers, perfusionists, surgical scrub nurses trained in transcatheter procedures, circulating nurses, catheterization laboratory technicians, and surgical assistants. We have found this multidisciplinary approach to facilitate rescue in the case of myocardial collapse.<sup>37</sup> The femoral, arterial, and venous lines are introduced percutaneously using a closure device at the end of the procedure. Thus, a venous pacing wire is inserted into the right ventricle and then two arterial wires are inserted into the groins, one for a pigtail catheter for aortography and to mark the location of the lower extent of the noncoronary sinus for valve positioning and the other for the device sheath. Typically, the patient is heparinized so the ACT is between 250 and 350 seconds. The aortic valve is crossed with a 0.035" straight wire and generally an AL1 catheter and advanced into the left ventricle. This is then exchanged with an extra stiff wire that has been fashioned into a curved arc to minimize the risk of ventricular perforation. A balloon is then threaded over the guidewire and positioned across the aortic valve using fluoroscopy and then during rapid pacing, and breath/ventilator holding, expanded to crack the calcified aortic valve in a manner similar to balloon aortic valvuloplasty (Fig. 33-3A).

For the SAPIEN XT, as a rule, patients who need the 23 valve should have an access artery of at least 6 mm; for the size 26 valve, a 6.5 mm artery; and for a 29 valve, a 7 mm artery, depending on the tortuosity of the vessel and degree of calcification. If there is more than 90-degree angulation of the iliac arteries, then generally it would be difficult to insert the sheath unless the vessel straightens very easily with a Lunderquist wire.

Prior to inserting the valve loaded on the delivery balloon, it is checked and confirmed to be correctly oriented and is then threaded over the stiff wire and the loader pushed into the sheath and threaded across the aortic arch with the steerable catheter being flexed to get around the aortic arch and then fed down to the aortic valve. Essentially, the valve with the leading cone is fed across the valve to cross the valve and then the cone is pushed further into

the ventricle so that the stent valve is free. Once the balloon is inflated, it can be expanded without limitation from the cone. We consider it very important to carefully check on the positioning of the valve across the hinged point of the native valve using both echocardiography and fluoroscopy and root injections with contrast via the pigtail catheter. The valve is positioned at the valve hinged points, approximately 60 to 70% aortic and 30 to 40% ventricular (Fig. 33-4). Once everybody agrees that the position is correct, the patient's breath is held, the heart is paced at approximately 180 beats per minute, the balloon is inflated in position and then deflated, the pacer is switched off, and ventilation is resumed (Fig. 33-3).

The most common location of perivalvular regurgitation is in the region of the noncoronary-left main leaflet commissure, probably because this is an area of less flexibility and generally calcified. Echocardiography is then used to inspect the function of the valve and aortography to confirm the lack of perivalvular leak. Thereafter, cone is first withdrawn from the left ventricle followed by removal of the catheter and sheath, and lastly the closure device is tied down at the insertion sites. We perform a completion angiogram of the access vessel in nearly all cases to rule out vascular injury (eg, dissection, occlusion, and significant extravasation).

#### Transapical Approach

Similar to our practice in the TF cases, we perform all TA procedures in a hybrid operating room with a multidisciplinary team. We position the patient flat supine on pillows

rather than in a traditional left thoracotomy position, so as not to interfere with the positioning of the C-arms. The ideal planes are calculated for imaging the valve with the nadir of each cusp being in the same plane from preoperative computed tomography scans.

Once the patient is positioned, she/he is prepped in the usual manner with exposure of the groin and left chest. The femoral artery and vein are exposed on the right side and the left femoral venous pacing wires are inserted. The femoral artery exposure is performed in case the patient has to be placed on cardiopulmonary bypass and also used for pigtail catheter insertion as in the TF cases.

We continue to have all of our patients undergo general anesthesia but do not use double-lumen endotracheal tubes for the TA valves. Before opening the chest, CT scan images are inspected to find the ideal place to open the left chest. Typically, the fifth intercostal space is entered and the apex of the left ventricle is palpated. Once the apex of the left ventricle has been palpated, a short piece of rib is commonly removed to expose the apex. Originally we did not do this and rather spread the ribs, but we found that some patients had severe postoperative pain as with the MIDCAB experience. We have therefore opted to resect a short piece of rib to obtain both a better exposure and less pain after surgery, particularly because many of these patients have a component of concomitant lung disease. Pericardiotomy is performed over the left ventricular (LV) apex, and heparin is administered aiming to achieve an ACT of 250 to 350. Two concentric purse string sutures reinforced with pledgets are placed as well as and a horizontal mattress suture is placed at the LV apex.

The final entry site is selected by tapping on the LV apex and then looking at the echo to make sure that the LV apex is correctly identified. This is important because the heart can be anywhere from the fourth intercostal space to the seventh or eighth intercostal space. A needle is placed into the apex, followed by soft access wire insertion in the left ventricle through the needle and directed to the aortic valve. A 12-Fr sheath is then delivered into the LV apex; then we insert a balloontipped Berman catheter into the left ventricle, through the aortic valve, and across the aortic arch down to the renal arteries. An extra stiff wire is then fed down to this level, the Berman catheter is removed, and the 12-Fr sheath is exchanged for the large-bore TA introduction sheath. Balloon valvuloplasty is performed through this in the same sequence with rapid pacing as for the TF approach. The valve is then loaded onto the sheath and pushed into position and the pusher is retracted into the sheath. With the valve situated approximately 60 to 70% aortic (Fig. 33-5) and with rapid pacing, the balloon is then inflated at this point. The balloon is then withdrawn into the left ventricle before stopping pacing. Both transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) and aortic root angiography are used to confirm the position and orientation of the prosthetic valve. If all appears well, the sheath is then removed (generally under conditions of rapid pacing), the pursestring sutures are tied down, and protamine is administered.
