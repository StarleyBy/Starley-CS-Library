Cardiovascular care is the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease includes pathology of the heart and the peripheral vasculature. It remains the number one killer in the United States. The 2010 overall rate of death attributable to cardiovascular disease was 235.5 per 100,000. On the basis of this death rate, more than 2150 Americans die of cardiovascular disease each day, which corresponds to 1 death every 40 seconds. However, the death rate attributable to cardiovascular disease has declined by 31% from 2000 to 2010.1 The reasons for this include progress in preventive medicine as well as better treatment of risk markers like hypertension and hyperlipidemia, timely application of reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction and better access to cardiovascular operations and procedures. This has correlated with a dramatic increase in the volume of cardiovascular care. For example, there were approximately 6,000,000 inpatient cardiovascular operations and procedures in 2000, which increased by 25% to approximately 7,500,000 inpatient cardiovascular operations and procedures in 2010.1 As a result of these trends, cardiovascular care comes at a larger cost to society. The total direct and indirect costs of cardiovascular disease and stroke in the United States in 2010 were estimated at \$315.4 billion.1

## **EVOLUTION OF CARDIOVASCULAR SUBSPECIALTIES**

Cardiovascular care is provided by a number of different cardiovascular subspecialties. This includes cardiac surgeons, cardiovascular physicians, interventional cardiologists, interventional and noninterventional radiologists, vascular surgeons, cardiovascular anesthesiologists, critical care specialists, and primary care physicians. Each of these subspecialties has evolved from very different historical roots. For example, cardiac surgery emerged from general surgery during the Second World War, when Dwight Harken successfully removed foreign bodies in and around the heart of some 130 injured soldiers.<sup>2</sup> In contrast, interventional cardiology emerged from radiology when Dr. Charles Dotter performed the first-ever

angioplasty procedure in a leg artery at the Oregon Health and Science University in Oregon<sup>3</sup> and, building on his work, Dr. Andreas Gruentzig performed the first balloon angioplasty procedure on a coronary artery.<sup>4</sup> Similarly, each of the other subspecialties that contribute to cardiovascular care has evolved from distinct historical roots. As a result of these different historic roots, providers of cardiovascular care were originally organized in separate medical school departments according to the patient populations that their disciples historically served and the instruments that were historically used in their clinical practice.

## EVOLUTION OF CARDIOVASCULAR CENTERS

The departments of early medical schools were initially formed by individual professors and their assistants. Subsequent expansion of the departments increased their organizational complexity but they continued to operate as separate units under the leadership of autonomous chairmen.<sup>5</sup> Advances in medical research in the twentieth century resulted in the emergence of departmental subspecialists who predominantly treated one specific organ. Consequently, many medical school departments established divisions that focused on particular organ systems.<sup>5</sup> As the divisions became ever more specialized, the clinical interests of individual divisions of separate departments began to overlap more with each other than with the rest of their respective departments. In particular, the emergence of cardiac surgery as a subspecialty resulted in a symbiotic relationship between cardiac surgeons and cardiologists.5 Moreover, cardiac surgeons and cardiologists increasingly relied on specialized cardiovascular radiologists and cardiovascular anesthesiologists. Over time, these relationships between the cardiovascular subspecialities evolved into formal associations and eventually dedicated cardiovascular centers were formed. These cardiovascular centers allowed physicians of different subspecialties to cooperate at an unprecedented level to optimally orchestrate the cardiovascular care of their patients.

## ADVANTAGES OF PROVIDING CARDIOVASCULAR CARE IN CARDIOVASCULAR CENTERS

Cardiovascular centers that integrate multiple cardiovascular subspecialties provide a number of important advantages. Firstly, integrated cardiovascular centers improve the clinical care for patients. For example, clinical care is improved by increasing patient volume. The relationship between patient volume and quality of care has been demonstrated in many areas of cardiovascular care. For example, a large body of evidence shows that increasing procedural volumes in cardiac surgery results in improved quality with decreased complication rates. Moreover, there is evidence that increased surgeon volume results in improved quality of care.6 Therefore professional organizations have recommended that cardiac surgery programs performing fewer than 125 coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedures annually consider affiliation with high-volume tertiary centers. A similar relationship between volume and quality of care exist in interventional cardiology. Among hospitals in the United States that have full interventional capabilities, a higher volume of angioplasty procedures was found to be associated with a lower mortality rate among patients undergoing primary angioplasty.8 On the basis of this and other studies, professional organizations recommended that patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction undergo primary angioplasty by cardiac catheterization laboratories performing at least 36 primary angioplasties as well as at least 200 total angioplasties per year.9 Integrated cardiovascular centers are ideally suited to deliver such high procedural numbers by concentrating cardiovascular care in dedicated centers, attracting referrals, co-marketing, and by sharing patients among the physicians. Higher quality of care can also be delivered by building up specialized expertise within narrow boundaries, multidisciplinary management of patients, and co-locating services. Finally, a substantial clinical research effort facilitates participation in multicenter trials that give patients access to the latest clinical treatment modalities.

Secondly, integrated cardiovascular centers improve the efficiency of patient flow pathways. This allows coordination of hospital visits to minimize intrusion in the patients' lives. For example, preoperative tests such as echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, and evaluation by cardiac anesthesia can occur on the least number of visits possible. Besides enhancing the patients' satisfaction with their care, the cost of cardiovascular care to society is reduced by minimizing time off work and allowing patients to participate in other activities.

Finally, integrated cardiovascular centers provide improved efficiency in practice management and reduced expenses. For example, an audit of the merger of a five-physician vascular surgery group, its noninvasive laboratory, and a three-physician interventional radiology group showed that integrating these cardiovascular subspecialties into a single center resulted in increased efficiencies that allowed the total expenses of the merged group to fall by 13% compared with the 12-month period that immediately preceded the merger. <sup>10</sup>

## THE INTEGRATED CARDIOVASCULAR CENTER OF THE FUTURE

In the future, the advantages provided by cardiovascular centers will be maximized by full integration at the level of clinical care, education, and research. Integration of clinical care will result in multidisciplinary management at all levels of patient care. This will include multidisciplinary outpatient clinics, conferences, in-patient rounds, and procedures. For example, outpatient clinics for cardiac surgery, cardiology, and preoperative cardiovascular anesthesia will ideally be located in the same physical space and coordinated at the same time. One model could involve clinicians sharing a centralized physician work-space and patients being seen in designated clinic cubicles. This means that patients could be seen by physicians from different subspecialties without having to leave their designated cubicle. Physicians could see their patients together with other providers from different subspecialties at the same time, or sequentially based on the complexity and needs of individual patients. In practice, this may involve taking a joined preoperative history and physical examination by anesthesia and cardiac surgery mid-level providers. Cardiologists and cardiac surgeons could engage in a joined discussion with patients regarding the risks and benefits of the multimodality treatment options, which might include medical management, interventional management, or surgery. Finally, an integrated electronic medical record would minimize redundancy and increase efficiency.

Similarly, interpretation of cardiovascular studies by cardiologists and radiologists will take place in a shared reading room to pool the expertise of the providers. For example, cardiologists could contribute their clinical knowledge and their understanding of cardiovascular pathophysiology, whereas radiologists could offer imaging and information technology expertise.

Multidisciplinary conferences that benefit from the joint expertise of cardiac surgeons, cardiologists, and cardiovascular anesthesiologists include high-risk preoperative conferences for example. During these conferences each specialty can contribute toward an accurate assessment of the overall risk and benefit ratio of different treatment modalities for high-risk patients.

Finally, integration of clinical care will mean that procedures will increasingly take place in shared treatment spaces. The prime example for this is the hybrid operating room. Hybrid operating rooms have the usual features of an operating room with additional cardiac catheterization and endovascular capabilities (Fig. 9-1). This creates a shared work-space where cardiac surgeons, interventional cardiologists, and vascular surgeons can cooperate during joined procedures. Combining the tools of the catheterization laboratory and operating room greatly enhances the options available to surgeons and cardiologists to treat complex patients. One example is hybrid coronary revascularization wherein a left internal mammary artery graft is placed on the left anterior descending (LAD) artery either by minimally invasive or open technique and combined with percutaneous intervention of

non-LAD vessels.<sup>11</sup> Another example is minimally invasive valve surgery combined with percutaneous intervention to coronary lesions in order to convert high-risk valve and CABG operations into a low-risk isolated minimally invasive valve procedures. Yet, other possibilities include hybrid endomyocardial and epicardial arrhythmia procedures<sup>12</sup> and hybrid open and endovascular approaches for the descending thoracic aorta and pathologies of the aortic arch and distal ascending aorta.<sup>13</sup> Finally, the hybrid operating rooms represent an optimal setting for transcatheter aortic valve replacement.<sup>14</sup> This has already resulted in a new paradigm, the Hybrid Paradigm, where providers of the different cardiovascular subspecialties consider themselves cardiovascular proceduralists.

From the close clinical collaboration between the cardiovascular subspecialties follows that education and training need to be integrated in order to create a common culture and knowledge base. For example, free standing cardiothoracic surgery and vascular surgery residencies are evolving that allow better integration of the cardiovascular subspecialties during training than previous models which depended on general surgery training. For example, residents of a free-standing cardiothoracic surgery residency may rotate with cardiology during their early years of training. Another example is a TAVR fellowship that involves mandatory training with interventionalists in the catheterization suite. Conversely, cardiology fellows subspecializing in heart failure frequently accompany the cardiac surgery teams during heart procurements and are observers in the operating room during recipient implant procedures. Finally, the integration

of cardiovascular centers will allow trainees to participate in more related cases that are not part of their primary specialty. <sup>10</sup>

Research will also be facilitated by integrated cardiovascular centers that attract a critical mass of multidisciplinary research teams focusing on cardiovascular disease. In particular, center will provide organized leadership and the ability to distribute research activity at the level of subgroups. Faculty will also benefit from the close interaction with researchers outside of their divisions. Research support structures that can be custom focused on cardiovascular research include a wide range of areas from basic science core facilities to statistical support, specialized research grant administrators, and maintenance of an institutional clinical outcomes database. Multidisciplinary cardiovascular research conferences, common cafeteria, and leisure space will also facilitate the exchange of ideas between subspecialties. Ideally, integrated cardiovascular centers will participate in basic, translational, and clinical outcomes research focusing on cardiovascular disease since all of these fields benefit from a concentration of cardiovascular knowledge and clinical experience (Fig. 9-2).

In addition, there are specific advantages for each level of research. At the level of basic research, the differences between cardiovascular subspecialties nearly disappear. As a result, integrated cardiovascular centers offer ideal conditions for pooling and conducting such research. At the level of translational research there is also a convergence of interests since cutting edge translational research frequently involves multidisciplinary fields that transcend conventional departmental boundaries. Since basic and translational research

is often dependent on large amount of funding, integrated cardiovascular centers will be able to provide laboratories with common small and large animal spaces and provide shared equipment which would otherwise be too expensive for individual departments. Large multidisciplinary laboratories can be set up in cardiovascular centers which would otherwise be hard to assemble or maintain. The larger size of cardiovascular centers will also make it easier to bring in additional multidisciplinary expertise such as stem cell experts, tissue engineering, mechanical and bioengineering, valve hemodynamics, and 3D printed modeling capabilities that can contribute to research efforts of different cardiovascular subspecialties. Finally, clinical outcomes research is more efficient because follow-up of patients involves multiple specialties which can each contribute relevant data to a jointly maintained database.

In summary, the cardiovascular center of the future will be a multidisciplinary and collaborative entity encompassing clinical care, education, and research. This structure has the potential to improve quality of care, reduce costs, improve training, and accelerate research.
