Of the many developments in cardiothoracic surgery, the introduction of a broad spectrum of simulation techniques for education and training of students and residents as well as ongoing faculty training are among the most exciting and critical for the continued advancement of the specialty. There are increasing demands for safety during training, for training to be more effective and efficient, and have minimal impact on the process of patient care. The productivity of training for physicians has advanced in many ways; simulation is one approach to teaching that offers solutions to challenges in training in general and especially in cardiac surgery. In this chapter, we describe a spectrum of simulation technologies and techniques that are being applied to address these challenges. We also address approaches to using simulation to its greatest effect and speculate about future technologies and applications and how they will be integrated into education at all levels of experience.

#### **BACKGROUND**

Simulation has been described as a "technique, not a technology, to replace or guide real experiences with guided experiences that evoke or replicate substantial aspects of the real world in a fully interactive manner."1 The roots of simulation in medicine can be traced back for centuries. More recent applications in the 1960s and 1970s for training in specific tasks include the Sim One for teaching in anesthesia residency, Resusci Anne for training in cardiac life support, and Harvey for teaching about cardiology to medical students.<sup>2</sup> The more modern era of simulation began in earnest in the late 1980s with the development of more realistic mannequins for teaching basic skills and management of crises in anesthesia. Surgeons have long used various forms of simulation, from tying knots on paperclips placed in clay to cadavers and animals. The first use of a model simulator was introduced by Howard in 1868 in which a mannequin was created to teach hernia repair.3 But, more technology-based forms of task trainers for various surgical and procedural skills appeared beginning in the late 1980s.<sup>2</sup>

For many reasons, the use of simulation is growing in all of healthcare, and specifically in cardiac surgery. Ziv and colleagues described the adoption of simulation in surgical training as an ethical imperative noting patient safety as their cause.4 With patients having increased acuity, practicing outside of the operating room is critical for mastering tasks to quickly develop critical skills without exposing patients to increased risk. Practice via simulation has been shown to increase speed for completion of coronary anastomosis<sup>5</sup> as well as increase speed and accuracy of mitral valve annuloplasty.6 Through deliberate practice (rehearsing a task or behavior repeatedly), simulation provides the ability to advance the mastery of some skills more quickly, reducing operating time related to training. Simulation is also the preferred modality to improve teamwork and communication and to practice emergencies not frequently seen during training. It enables surgeons and teams to work out complex problems in a nonthreatening setting and apply the lessons to urgent and emergent situations.

Surgical simulation may provide an important modality for measuring proficiency for certification, recertification, or for judging appropriateness of clinical advancement within a training program. For example, a particular task such as anastomosis of one small vessel to another has many components that can be evaluated for simple tasks such as instrument use, suture handling, and tissue handling. The same tasks can be integrated into a more complex scenario on a higher fidelity simulator; for example, rather than sewing a simple anastomosis, anastomoses may be incorporated into a beating-heart coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) on the simulator. Graft measurement, appropriateness of anastamotic site, vessel opening, and preparation can be evaluated. In addition, these tasks can be incorporated into the entire bypass procedure for more advanced learning as training progresses.

Simulation education has gained significant traction in cardiac anesthesia training as well. Bruppacher and colleagues performed a randomized controlled trial in which anesthesia residents were randomized to simulation training and no simulation training for cardiopulmonary bypass weaning.<sup>7</sup> The residents were evaluated using an internally validated

scoring system administered by blinded attending anesthesiologists before and after simulation training. The residents who underwent two hours of simulation training improved significantly more than the residents who underwent two hours of didactic instruction.

The most exciting advancement in cardiac surgical simulation training occurred in 2005 when Ramphal created a relatively high realism porcine beating-heart model to address the shortage of cardiac surgery cases being afforded to residents in training in Jamaica<sup>8</sup> (Figs. 8-1 and 8-2). The simulator was adapted by a leadership group in cardiothoracic surgery in the United States and incorporated into focused programs to advance simulation-based learning. The Thoracic Surgery Foundation for Research and Education's (TSFRE) annual Boot Camp conference and "Senior Tour" are sponsored by the Thoracic Surgery Directors' Association and the American Board of Thoracic Surgery and the Joint Counsel on Thoracic Surgical Education (JTSE). The three-day, well-orchestrated simulation curriculum has been conducted since

2008 and provides focused learning for first-year cardiothoracic residents with feedback and standardized evaluations. Standardized evaluation of first-year residents participating in the "Boot Camp" consistently show improvement in time to complete basic cardiothoracic techniques as well as accuracy. <sup>10,11</sup>

Creating a successful cardiac simulation program requires understanding and application of the principles of adult learning. In 1993, Reznick<sup>12,13</sup> described the process of adults learning surgery and the relationship between the trainee and expert instructor. He referenced key educational literature describing Kopta's three stages of adult learning, perception, integration, and automatation<sup>14</sup> as well as Collins' framework for the apprenticeship model characterizing the roles the teacher plays as the student progresses from novice to expert.<sup>15</sup> Those principles are applied to how we approach simulation-based training in all aspects. We next present the current state of how this is done for training in basic skills, what specific procedures currently can be simulated, and what existing simulators are available for cardiac and thoracic surgery.

### **BASIC SKILLS TRAINING**

For cardiothoracic surgery, simulation training begins with teaching of component tasks, starting at the most basic level and combining those into multiple tasks and then full procedures. A consortium of six hospitals (Massachusetts General Hospital, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, Johns Hopkins, University of Rochester, Stanford University, Vanderbilt University, and University of Washington) developed a 7-week syllabus, broken down into multiple key concepts and procedures consisting of cardiopulmonary bypass (Fig. 8-3), CABG (Figs. 8-4 to 8-7), valve replacement (Figs. 8-8 to 8-10), air embolism, and acute intraoperative aortic dissection (Fig. 8-11). First, fundamentals of cardiopulmonary bypass are taught step by step, including cannulation of the aorta, right atrium, and cardioplegia perfusion with repetitive practice on a perfused porcine heart. Concomitant

with learning the technical aspects of these tasks is a memorization and understanding of the concept of initiating and weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. The component tasks are then combined with the knowledge base on a higher fidelity model after practicing on the dry porcine heart. The student then integrates these steps using a beating-heart model to fully cannulate, institute bypass, arrest the heart, wean from bypass, and decannulate. The trainee is assessed in a standardized fashion by the expert instructor. The same process of moving from simpler tasks with low-fidelity models to more sophisticated and integrated tasks on higher fidelity simulators is conducted for the five components of the curriculum.

Deliberate practice prepares trainees to apply the basic principles of cardiac surgery to more complicated groupings of tasks. In the CABG component of the curriculum, the resident performs large and small vessel anastomoses, first on a component simulator and later on a porcine heart. The

![](_page_3_Picture_6.jpeg)

trainee will later combine the steps to perform a full coronary bypass operation on the beating-heart simulator. This process is repeated with the basics of aortic valve surgery. That training begins by teaching the resident about the anatomy of the aortic valve and root and exposing it in the anatomic dissection on the porcine heart. The resident will next practice excising the valve, placing sutures in the annulus repetitively, ultimately seating and tying in all different types of valves until they become proficient. Once this task is mastered, it is incorporated with the previously mastered bypass skills to perform an aortic valve replacement on the beating-heart simulator.

In a similar fashion, mitral valve surgery can be learned. After these basic techniques have been practiced repeatedly, more advanced teaching that incorporates team training and dealing with emergencies can be simulated.

The training via simulation can include creating a plan, implementing that plan with the team in a dry model, and then carrying it out on the beating heart simulator. As noted above, specific emergencies that have been vetted on a simulator include managing aortic dissection at the cannulation site, managing massive air embolism and problems that can occur when weaning off cardiopulmonary bypass, for example, right heart failure, kinked or twisted grafts that can be too long or too short, leaks around the valve, and aortic root dissection. Simulation training is reaching beyond OR-based procedures to bedside invasive resuscitation and surgery.

In cardiac surgery, research has demonstrated that a model neck-cannulation trainer can improve trainee's ability to cannulate the neck vessels for extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO) resuscitation.<sup>16</sup> Chan and colleagues used a similar model but included a full pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) team in their ECMO training and evaluation.<sup>17</sup> These were not evaluated by assessing participants' skills during the cannulation of a live patient, however. Simulation is also being used to train perfusionists. Morris and Pybus describe a simulated (Orpheus) perfusion machine that can be used for training in the operating room or in a simulation center.18 Lansdowne and colleagues describe using the same simulator for training perfusionists and respiratory therapists on ECMO management.<sup>19</sup> A new, exciting, and different use of simulation is 3-D printing for operative planning.<sup>20-22</sup> Valverde and colleagues used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angiography to design a 3-D-printed model to plan endovascular stenting of an aortic arch coarctation in a 15-year-old boy.<sup>23</sup> Costello and colleagues even used 3-D printing as an educational model to train residents on ventricular septal defect (VSD) repair.<sup>24</sup>

Trainees can also be led to assimilate hemodynamic information and practice communication skills with other personnel, including anesthesiologists, perfusionists, and nurses. While basic skills can be taught in a laboratory setting, teamwork skills can be taught in a high-realism operating room setting. This multimodal approach, with the gradation from low technology to high fidelity makes a rich environment not only for teaching but also for performance evaluation (see below).

### **SIMULATORS**

In order to accomplish the teaching goals discussed above, many simulators have been developed over the years. These include full mannequin simulators, part task trainers, and virtual reality systems.<sup>25</sup> These are used in various forms to meet the specific training objectives. For training on specific cardiac surgical tasks, various forms of models of the heart and blood vessels have been developed. Virtual reality simulators generally are most useful for laparoscopic procedures. In cardiac surgery, mannequin simulators are mostly used as part of an overall cardiac surgical operating room environment, especially for team training and can also be used for practice of an entirely new procedure.

For training in cardiac surgical procedures, part task trainers have been developed to enable practice on a range of tasks from the most simple and to some more complex. Some of the most realistic cardiac surgery simulation tools have come from the Chamberlain group [Great Barrington Massachusetts] (Figs. 8-4, 8-6, and 8-8). Limbs and Things [Savannah Georgia] and the Wet Lab facility in the United Kingdom (Fig. 8-12) have all been instrumental in providing synthetic and tissue-based simulators. Despite the simulators that are available, many tasks that are required in cardiac surgery do not fit into a typical commercial simulation product. As a result, porcine hearts have become the mainstay for teaching cannulation and many of the other elements of cardiac surgery such as CABG and valve replacement and repair mentioned above. As shown in the accompanying figures, much work has been done to develop perfused pig heart models to more realistically simulate the cannulation scenarios (Figs. 8-1, 8-3, and 8-10).

There is now a 25-year history of using simulation for training in communication and other teamwork skills.<sup>2,26</sup> Generally, this has involved the use of full-body, mannequin simulators of varying degrees of realism and fidelity. The early work of Gaba and colleagues has been widely disseminated and such mannequin simulators are used in thousands of

centers around the world. The mannequins typically have the features that are needed to simulate many of the characteristics of patient physiology during surgical procedures, for example, audio of a beating heart, respiration, pulses, blinking eyes, and constricting pupils. Placed in a realistic operating room setting, complete with all surgical, anesthesia, nursing, and other paraphernalia, the mannequins enable creation of a setting that is realistic enough to engage teams of operating room professionals into scenarios that mimic many types of critical events that occur during surgical procedures (Fig. 8-13). The mannequins can be enhanced by incorporation of cardiac surgical anatomy and bypass, allowing simulation of an entire procedure and are especially useful for team training and practice for emergencies (see section below) (Fig. 8-14).

# SIMULATION AND TEAMWORK TRAINING IN CARDIAC SURGERY

The importance of teamwork to patient safety and efficiency is now well recognized in healthcare.<sup>27</sup> It has been more than two decades since anesthesiologist David Gaba and colleagues brought Crew Resource Management principles from aviation to healthcare and developed a training program he called Anesthesia Crisis Resource Management (ACRM) to teach anesthesiologists to handle critical events in the OR.<sup>26,28</sup> ACRM recognizes that anesthesiology has many similarities to aviation. The environment of the OR, including all of the professionals who work there, is complex and dynamic requiring effective coordination of skills and resources for safe patient care. Similar to aviation, a majority of incidents and accidents in anesthesia involved some level of human error despite technical expertise.<sup>28</sup> There is similar evidence that the same is true for surgery in general and cardiac surgery in particular.29,30

The patient safety movement is giving increasing attention to improving team performance in delivery of care. Healthcare professionals from different disciplines and professions must coordinate their activities to make patient care safe and efficient. Those working in a healthcare team, including in cardiac surgery, typically have diverse educational backgrounds and have different experience and perspectives; and they are rarely trained together. Simon and colleagues were the first to demonstrate that formal teamwork training can lead to improvement in staff attitudes toward teamwork, quality of teamwork, and a significant reduction in observed clinical errors in teamwork-trained emergency departments.<sup>31</sup> Despite recognition of the importance of teamwork and existence of teamwork programs, there does not yet seem to be deep penetration or routine training for healthcare professional teams. Interprofessional training in general is lacking in healthcare.32

The complexity of medical care is a challenge to the effective communication and teamwork essential for the delivery of high quality and safe patient care. Poor communication and poor teamwork have been shown to be one of the major

![](_page_5_Picture_2.jpeg)

FIGURE 8-13 Simulated operating room viewed from control room.

contributors to adverse events.<sup>33</sup> Communication failures are the leading cause of inadvertent patient harm. Teamwork failures in the operating room have been linked to a higher risk of complications and death.<sup>33</sup> The clinicians providing care had very different views of what was expected to happen; they did not share the same mental model and often did not have an environment to speak up when there were safety concerns. Even the most skilled, experienced, and highly motivated clinicians have performance limitations and will make mistakes. Effective communication can help prevent these mistakes from becoming consequential and harming patients.<sup>34</sup>

The practice of surgery is an area of major risk for malpractice insurers. Root-cause analysis of claims from the Harvard-affiliated malpractice insurer Controlled Risk

![](_page_5_Picture_6.jpeg)

FIGURE 8-14 Simulated cardiac surgical field.

Insurance Company, Risk Management Foundation (CRICO/RMF) and other major insurers show that errors in surgical care most commonly occurred in the operating room. Communication breakdowns were the second most common factors identified in contributing to error, after technical performance.<sup>35</sup>

A growing body of evidence links teamwork in surgery to improved outcomes.<sup>36</sup> Elements of the Surgical Safety Checklist can be used as an actual briefing to enhance teamwork. Voicing one's name, role, and concerns not only gets the entire team on the same page but makes the environment more open for any team member to speak up throughout the case. This struggle over speaking up in a clinical domain is consistent with research in the organizational behavior domain.<sup>37</sup> Interviews with employees have shown that they perceived risks of speaking up to be personal and immediate, whereas they were uncertain of the benefit of sharing their ideas. There was a powerful protective instinct that inhibited speech; employees played it safe by keeping quiet.<sup>38</sup> People have difficulty in speaking up across a hierarchical gradient; such gradients exist in the operating room environment.

Communication breakdowns and lapses in teamwork are a leading cause of errors in the operating room resulting in preventable patient harm, second only to technical errors. Analyses from closed claims from both the American Society of Anesthesiologists and the American College of Surgeons found poor communication both inside and outside the operating room to be a significant cause of preventable adverse events. Technical errors were significantly more likely to be deemed preventable if they were also accompanied by communication failures.<sup>39,40</sup> Studies have supported the concept that interventions designed to improve teamwork and

communication may have beneficial effects on technical performance and patient outcome.<sup>41</sup>

Risk management data for CRICO/RMF has shown that the anesthesiologists' already good malpractice profile improved, since the anesthesia staff began participating in Anesthesia Crisis Resource Management training. 42 Encouraged by their success, CRICO/RMF promoted simulationbased team training as a risk control strategy for obstetrical providers. CRICO/RMF later concluded that formal training in communication and teamwork for obstetric clinicians could ultimately mitigate or prevent adverse perinatal events. An interprofessional simulation-based team-training course for obstetric clinicians was systematically designed as advocated by Salas and Cannon-Bowers and modeled after the successful ACRM training. Risk management data from CRICO/RMF has shown that the number of claims has been trending down in the Harvard-affiliated institutions' obstetric departments since their faculty obstetricians and midwives have participated in this course. As a result of this trend, CRICO continues to offer a significant reduction in malpractice insurance premiums to obstetricians and certified nurse midwives who participate in this training. 43,44

Arriaga and colleagues note that there is a growing call for simulation team training programs with the entire operating room teams on a large scale. 45 They described a standardized multicenter high-fidelity simulation-based team-training pilot program. This program was developed with the interprofessional make-up of the team in mind, ensuring that it was clinically relevant to all of the participants. Simulation scenarios that had been used effectively to train anesthesiologists were adapted to include tasks for the surgeons, nurses, and other professions on the operating room team. Surgical props and models were used to keep the surgeons engaged (Fig. 8-14). Ninety-two percent of participants found the scenarios to be realistic, appropriately challenging, and clinically relevant toward providing safer care. 45 Debriefing of the cases was done by faculty who received training in giving feedback in a direct, clear, and respectful way that was supportive and consistent with "debriefing with good judgment." They found that, despite the simulated crises with chaotic operative environments, more than 96% of participants were comfortable being open and honest with each other in the debriefing. Surgeons commented on the value of improving their communication skills and anesthesiologists and nurses on their desire to improve assertiveness. The vast majority of participants believed the course had a meaningful impact on their approach to clinical practice.

Cardiac surgery is a particularly stressful and intense environment which requires effective teamwork and communication for resolution of acute events and prevention of adverse outcomes. Cardiac surgery operating room teams are generally large interprofessional teams with established hierarchy and requiring seamless coordination. The procedures can be technically challenging and emergencies are common. There can be many challenges with complex bypass equipment, multiple drug infusions, and lack of standardization allowing for individual surgeon's preferences for equipment and

cardioplegia. Communication is even more essential with complicated patients and the interruption of continuity of care with work hour limitations.

Stevens and colleagues sought to provide a comprehensive program to sharpen performance of experienced cardiac surgical teams in acute crisis management. 47 They developed and implemented a program of simulation-based training with high enough realism, including a bypass simulator, to engage an entire cardiac surgery team, including surgeon, anesthesiologist, nurses, perfusionists, and physician assistants. Realistic simulated scenarios engaged the team in critical events that elicited teamwork skills, including effective leadership of event management and specific communication skills. As is always done in such training, the simulated cases were each followed by a debriefing by trained facilitators. Critical elements of information sharing in the cardiac surgical environment were identified and ways to optimize their interpersonal communication and team response were discussed. The program also included an interactive, four-hour workshop for the entire hospital cardiac surgical service.47

Based on perceptions of the participants, this program was judged to have positive impact within the cardiac surgical service. Focus group participants noted feeling that patient care had improved as a result of this training. The surgeons interviewed reported that they were conducting briefings and other participants described desirable teamwork behavior changes prompted by the program. Eighty-two percent of participants recommended repeat simulation training every 6 to 12 months. The interactive workshop participants identified speaking up about critical information and interprofessional information-sharing as the areas of highest priority.

Involving the full operating room team in teamwork training has presented challenges including logistical and financial barriers. While simulations for operating room professionals have been conducted for many years, the inclusion of practicing surgeons appears still to be rare. Where OR teamwork training is conducted, the role of the surgeon is often played by a member of the team who is of a different profession. Indeed, the use of simulation-based training for surgery to date has been on acquisition of technical skills for surgeons. Less importance is given to the nontechnical skills of communication, leadership, and teamwork. Despite these challenges and small sample size of studies that include attending surgeons, the results suggest a significant positive impact on team performance.<sup>48</sup> As a result of the perceived success of surgical teamwork training pilot programs, CRICO/RMF expanded its malpractice insurance premium incentive program to include surgeons in high-risk specialties. Cardiac and other surgeons participating once every two years in a six-hour simulation-based training with a full operating room team qualify for a ten percent lower annual premium.a

## SIMULATION AS AN EVALUATION TOOL

While simulation has predominantly been used in cardiac surgery as a method for training cardiothoracic surgical residents, simulation also holds the potential to be used as a standardized evaluation tool. This would provide objective criteria for certifying trainees as possessing the competence required to operate independently. In 1997, Martin and colleagues validated the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills for general surgery skills.<sup>49</sup> In 2013, de Montbrun and colleagues validated a similar tool to assess technical competence for colorectal surgical skills.<sup>50</sup> Methods for using simulators to assess task-specific competency for coronary anastomoses, mitral valve surgery, and perfusion management are currently being developed and tested<sup>5,6,51</sup> (Tables 8-1 and 8-2). In 2013, Lee et al. evaluated the Joint Council on Thoracic Surgery Education Coronary Artery Assessment Tool for interrater reliability.<sup>52</sup> The JTSE tool for coronary anastomosis consists of 13 assessment parameters, which are scored on a Likert scale from 1 (poor) to 5 (outstanding). Lee had 10 attending-level surgeons ranging from 2 to 33 years of practice watch videos of a medical student, a resident, a fellow, and two attending surgeons operate on a low-fidelity simulator, high-fidelity simulator, and in a human CABG. The study reported high interrater reliability and internal consistency for this scoring system suggesting it may be useful for assessing trainee's competence for coronary anastomosis.<sup>52</sup> Currently, however, no assessment tools have been validated as a standard assessment tool in cardiothoracic surgery.

#### **FUTURE DIRECTIONS**

Ericsson presented evidence that achievement of expert performance in challenging professional domains requires on the order of 10,000 hours of deliberate practice, including mentoring via a coach.53 Modern clinical residents do not complete their training with nearly 10,000 hours of operating time, not to mention deliberate practice time, and it is doubtful they ever could. Simulation has the promise of offering the opportunity to acquire more deliberate practice particularly in technical skills both during training and throughout a lifetime of surgical practice. Furthermore, because of both safety and efficiency demands, the modern resident should enter the operating room coached on basic skills prior to first being involved in direct patient care. Training programs are moving in that direction, but much more needs to be done before all aspects of pre-training can be accomplished, especially for challenging technical tasks and even more so for all of the areas of surgical care that involve judgments before and during an actual procedure.

This chapter has described a number of the current simulation paradigms available in cardiothoracic training from synthetic to tissue-based, from low- to high-fidelity. However, we are far from a systematic curriculum utilizing these tools. Future training programs will need to develop a training paradigm where residents spend time in simulation with a coach prior to entering the operating room. Baker and colleagues suggested one possible method to design such a curriculum in 2012.<sup>54</sup> Training should begin on low-fidelity simulators where interns and junior residents can learn basic suture

techniques and knot tying progressing to high-fidelity simulation such as the synthetic-beating heart simulator where they can practice aortic cannulation and coronary anastomoses.<sup>54</sup> We expect that competency-based training programs such as described by Ferguson et al. for orthopedic surgery will become more widely used throughout surgery and rely heavily on all of the various forms of simulation.<sup>55</sup>

Simulation for team training likewise is at the early stages of integration into surgical practice. For all types of simulation and other experiential training outside of the direct patient care setting, there is a substantial economic and cultural barrier. The current apprenticeship form of training does not easily accommodate simulation since it requires removing the training from patient-care-related activities, which of course have their own value in developing expertise and are challenged by increasing complexity of care, the need for sub-specialization, and work-hour restrictions.

Another area of utility for cardiac surgical simulation will be for introducing new technologies into the flow of established operations. Opening of a new operating room or suite of rooms, introducing a new type of procedure or new technologies can benefit from conducting simulations before initial utilization. This has been done for numerous other healthcare domains, but we are not aware of a specific published application in cardiac surgical care. 56,57

Currently, most simulator technologies have a limited repertoire of patient pathology and variations from the normal distribution of anatomy aberrations. And, there are few simulation tools designed to develop judgment for pre- and intraprocedure decision-making. Thus, for the advances above to be achieved, much more technically accurate and biologically diverse simulations must be developed. The increasing use of 3-D printing of patient-specific, anatomically correct organ and body area by combining 3-D imaging and using 3-D printing to build a simulated surgical site is also likely to gain

more widespread use and will further enable optimization of surgical approach, practice in performing a complex, atypical procedure and team training required to do that safely and efficiently.

We expect that simulation in all its various forms will be increasingly applied in cardiac surgery as the technology advances and as innovation responds to the demands for greater safety and process efficiency.
