# Mitral Valve Repair for Congenital Mitral Valve Disease in the Adult

David P. Bichell • Bret Mettler

Isolated, non-reoperative congenital mitral valve abnormalities in adults are rare.<sup>1,2</sup> Mitral pathology concurrent with other cardiac anomalies is less rare. Atrial septal defect is the third commonest congenital cardiac lesion presenting in adulthood, occurring in an estimated 1/5700 persons, nearly 10% are ostium primum defects, and almost all primum defects have an associated mitral valve cleft.<sup>3</sup> Congenital mitral valve pathology such as arcade or parachute mitral valve very rarely present in adulthood, though the patients surviving unrepaired to adulthood may be milder forms, amenable to repair.

In contrast to the rarity of non-reoperative mitral pathology presenting in adulthood, patients needing reoperation for formerly corrected mitral pathology represent an expanding adult population. Survivors of corrective surgery in infancy and childhood add an estimated 8960 new adults cases annually to the adult congenital population in the US and there are over 1,000,000 adults living in the US today with congenital heart disease. 4 The prevalence of atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) is 5.3 per 10,000 live births. Mitral insufficiency is the principal reason for reoperation in the AVSD population. For patients undergoing an anatomic repair for complete or partial AVSD in infancy, freedom from reoperation for mitral regurgitation (MR) is 81 to 83% at 15 years, so the number of adults presenting with the need for reoperative mitral valve surgery is steadily increasing as successful infant repairs continue to accrue.6

#### **PATHOPHYSIOLOGY**

#### Normal Mitral Valve

Consideration of the normal mitral apparatus is important to the success of any repair for congenital mitral valve abnormalities. Congenital mitral valve pathology is widely variable between patients, demanding an individualized approach to each. A systematic analysis of the annular, leaflet, and

subvalvar support structures informs a surgical strategy that can be tailored to the individual.

#### **Annulus**

The normal mitral valve is attached to a dynamic, saddle-shaped fibrous annulus with the horn of the saddle at the anterior annulus, and the low points of the saddle at the commissures—a shape that minimizes leaflet stress through the cardiac cycle (Fig. 39-1).<sup>7</sup> The annulus is dynamic through the cardiac cycle, with apical to basilar displacement of the entire annulus, annular "folding" that changes the planar versus saddle configuration of the annulus, and a 23 to 40% contraction in annular circumference between systole and diastole.<sup>8</sup>

#### Leaflets

The anterior, or aortic leaflet, occupies one-third of the annular circumference, is broader than the posterior leaflet, and is anchored in its continuity with the aortic annulus. The posterior, or mural leaflet occupies two-thirds of the annulus and is narrower than the anterior leaflet. The leaflets are divided into named regions A1, P1, A2, P2, A3, P3, descriptive designations that are useful to consider in a systematic examination of the valve at repair (Fig. 39-1).

#### Subvalvar apparatus

All chordal leaflet support radiates from the anterolateral and posteromedial papillary muscles that are anchored on the free wall of the left ventricle, and correspond to the anterolateral and posteromedial commissures of the valve. Chordal attachments are at the free edge ("primary" or "marginal" chordae), the mid leaflet, ("secondary" or "rough zone" chordae), or closer to the hingepoint/annulus ("tertiary" or "basal" chordae). Papillary muscle separation is important to normal

valve excursion, and fusion or close spacing produces functional valve stenosis.

The physiologic patterns that result from congenital dysplasias of the mitral valve defy clean categorization, as several conditions produce stenosis and insufficiency together, in variable combination. We organize our description of anatomic mitral malformations into (1) lesions predominantly causing stenosis, (2) those commonly associated with combined stenosis and regurgitation, and (3) those predominantly associated with regurgitation.

#### **Congenital Mitral Stenosis**

Ruckman and Van Praagh categorized primary congenital mitral stenosis into four basic subtypes, based on autopsy data: (1) typical, (2) hypoplastic, (3) supravalvar ring, and (4) parachute mitral valve (Fig. 39-2). We will describe these categories, including a broader spectrum of supravalvar entities with supravalvar ring, and a variety of subvalvar pathologies in addition to parachute mitral valve.

FIGURE 39-2 Papillary muscle and chordal arrangement in congenital forms of mitral stenosis. LEFT: The "normal" mitral valve, with well-spaced papillary muscles, chordal support radiating from papillary muscles to their respective commissures and supporting the leaflets. Leaflets separate fully in diastole to permit optimal, unobstructed left ventricular filling. MIDDLE: The "typical" form of mitral stenosis, with normal sized annulus, closely spaced papillary muscles with inflow restriction owing to restrictive interchordal spaces and restricted leaflet mobility. RIGHT: The "parachute" deformity, with a single papillary muscle, inflow restriction at tight interchordal spaces and tethered leaflets.

#### **Typical**

In the "typical" variant of congenital valvar stenosis, the left ventricular size is normal, the mitral annulus is normal, and obstruction occurs within the valve elements themselves. The interchordal spaces are obstructed by fibrous tissue, leaflets may be thickened, chordae shortened, and papillary muscles, though distinct, are closely spaced. In some cases, the chordal apparatus is nearly absent, and papillary muscle tissue may insert directly and rigidly onto the leaflet itself, greatly reducing leaflet mobility and options for repair.

#### **Hypoplastic**

The hypoplastic variant is usually associated with other left-sided abnormalities such as ventricular hypoplasia, aortic stenosis, aortic arch hypoplasia, or coarctation of the aorta. The mitral annulus itself is small, and multiple valve elements are small. Hypoplastic mitral stenosis generally produces physiology that is either lethal or requires surgical palliation in infancy, and is therefore seldom found in the adult.<sup>9</sup>

#### Supramitral Ring and other Supravalvar Pathology

Supravalvar obstruction to mitral inflow presenting in adult-hood can take a variety of forms, causing inflow obstruction from a level remote from the valve (such as Cor Triatriatum), adjacent to the valve (supravalvar ring), or intimately associated with the valve (intramitral ring) (Fig. 39-3).

Cor triatriatum is embrologically distinct from true mitral valve stenosis, buts acts similarly, is encountered in the adult, and is therefore included. Cor Triatriatum is a membranous subdivision of the left atrium into two chambers—an upper chamber that receives the pulmonary veins, and a lower chamber that excludes pulmonary veins but includes the left atrial appendage. An "os" in the membrane is the portal through which all pulmonary venous return passes to the lower chamber and in turn through the mitral valve. Cor triatriatum can present with mild-to-severe restriction to mitral inflow, depending on the size of the os and the alternate pathways of left ventricular filling that may exist (Fig. 39-3). <sup>10,11</sup>

The true **supramitral ring** is a fibrous structure residing on the atrial side of the mitral annulus, with variable adherence to the mitral valve leaflet itself. It can produce restriction to inflow according to the size of the inflow orifice, and by restricting the movement of the leaflet itself when adherent (Fig. 39-3).

The **intramitral ring** is a thin fibrous membrane intimately associated with the leaflets and restricting leaflet excursion. The intramitral ring is always associated with subvalvar pathology (Fig. 39-3).<sup>12</sup>

A persistent left superior vena cava, present in 0.3 to 0.5% of population, courses across the floor of the left atrium in the supramitral area, and has been described to itself, uncommonly, produce a supravalvar obstruction. 13,14

The upstream chamber contains the pulmonary veins and the downstream chamber includes the left atrial appendage. MIDDLE: The "supramitral ring" is a membranous restriction to mitral inflow that is downstream of pulmonary veins and atrial appendage, resides in close proximity to the mitral valve, sometime fused with mitral leaflet. RIGHT: The "intramitral ring" is a membranous restriction to mitral inflow that is integral with the valve leaflets themselves.

#### Parachute Mitral Valve and Other Subvalvar Pathology

There are a great variety of types of subvalvar obstruction and an understanding of the differences is important to any operative strategy to repair them.

True "parachute mitral valve" presenting in adulthood is very rare, with only nine published cases of isolated parachute mitral valve in adults reported over 50 years.1 An embryologic failure in the separation of papillary muscles into two distinct columns results in parachute mitral valve, with a single papillary muscle from which all chordae radiate. 1,15 Annular and subannular restriction to mitral inflow results from thickened, shortened chordae, tethered to a single papillary origin, with tight interchordal spaces and restriction of leaflet excursion.1 Mitral insufficiency may accompany mitral stenosis, possibly due to ischemic dysfunction of the single papillary muscle.1 Parachute mitral valve is commonly associated with additional left heart pathology. "Shone's" complex is a constellation of left sided anomalies that includes a parachute mitral valve deformity, supramitral ring, subaortic stenosis, and coarctation of the aorta. The original description by John Shone in 1963 was from autopsy data from eight cases, including one adult, noting the tendency for additional left sided pathology to accompany parachute mitral valve, and the severity of disease that accounts for its rare presentation in adulthood.<sup>15</sup> These concomitant pathologies commonly drive the need for palliative or corrective interventions in childhood, leaving rare instances of isolated parachute mitral valve to present in adulthood.<sup>17</sup> "Parachutelike mitral asymmetry" is a similar but distinct entity where there are two distinct papillary muscles, but the anterolateral muscle is underdeveloped, short, and imparts restriction to the valve similar to that of true parachute valve. 12,17

## COMBINED MITRAL STENOSIS AND INSUFFICIENCY

Dysplasia of the mitral valve that restricts leaflet motion results in the same pathology causing both stenosis and regurgitation. Though mostly associated with stenosis, parachute mitral valve can produce regurgitation too, usually due to restricted anterior leaflet excursion. Repair may include extension of the anterior leaflet.

#### MITRAL ARCADE

Mitral arcade results from an embryonic failure of the elongation of mitral valve chordae. In severe cases, there are no distinct chordae and papillary muscles insert directly onto the free edge of the leaflet. The term arcade refers to the continuous band of dysplastic chordal tissue, in continuity with the mitral valve leaflet edge, that arcs between papillary muscle bases (Fig. 39-4). Papillary muscles may be indistinct or multiple. Restricted interchordal spaces and restricted leaflet mobility produce insufficiency and stenosis, often in combination. <sup>2,12,18</sup>

#### Hammock Mitral Valve

The "Hammock" mitral valve describes the appearance of a concave distortion of the posterior leaflet that results from extraneous papillary muscles and secondary chordae pulling the posterior leaflet apically and restricting its motion.<sup>19</sup>

Mitral arcade and Hammock mitral valve may present a combination of stenosis and insufficiency, usually associated

with restricted excursion of the posterior leaflet, which may require augmentation as part of its repair.

## Indications for Operative Intervention for Mitral Stenosis

Surgical indications for adults with congenital mitral stenosis are identical to those for acquired disease, and are detailed in the 2014 AHA/ACC consensus guidelines.<sup>20</sup> In brief, percutaneous balloon valvotomy is recommended for symptomatic patients with severe MS (valve inflow area of ≤1.5 cm<sup>2</sup>), if valve morphology is judged amenable to balloon palliation. Indication for surgical intervention includes severely symptomatic patients (HYHA Class III/IV) with severe mitral stenosis (≤1.5 cm²). Patients with moderate (1.6 to 2.0 cm<sup>2</sup>) to severe mitral stenosis (≤1.5 cm<sup>2</sup>) are considered for surgical intervention in the setting of concomitant cardiac surgery. Currently, there are no indications for surgical intervention in asymptomatic patients. Additional considerations at operation include resection of the left atrial appendage for patients with embolic events on anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation.  $^{20}$ 

## REPAIR TECHNIQUES FOR CONGENITAL MITRAL STENOSIS

Fundamental to success in repair of mitral stenosis or insufficiency with restricted leaflet excursion is to create freely

mobile leaflets that permit unobstructed ventricular filling in diastole, and are sufficient in surface area and support to form a large surface area of coaptation in systole.

#### Supravalvar Mitral Stenosis Repair

The repair for supravalvar restriction to mitral inflow consists of a complete resection of the obstructive Cor triatriatum membrane or supravalvar mitral ring. The true supravalvar mitral ring or intramitral ring can be densely adherent to the leaflets and care must be taken to perform a complete resection of the fibroelastic membrane. Careful blunt dissection techniques establish a plane between true leaflet and membrane. Careful intraoperative assessment of additional associated mitral abnormalities must be made in addition to membrane resection.

#### **Annular Mitral Stenosis Repair**

Annular hypoplasia requires annular enlargement. Adjacent vital structures considerably limit the options to enlarge the mitral annulus. The adjacent aortic valve limits annular enlargement anteriorly, between the trigones. The His bundle limits annular enlargement rightward of the aorta, and the circumflex coronary artery lies subjacent to the posterior and leftward annular perimeter. Extensive annular resection may preclude valve repair, obligating valve replacement into the enlarged annular area or in the supra-annular position (Fig. 39-5).

**FIGURE 39-5** Surgical landmarks of the mitral valve annulus, and anatomic limitations to annular enlargement. The mitral annulus between right and left aortic trigones is tissue shared with the aortic valve annulus. Rightward of the right trigone is an area adjacent to the His bundle. Subjacent to the posterior and leftward aspect of the mitral annulus is the circumflex coronary artery.

#### Subvalvar Mitral Stenosis Repair

The variant of congenital mitral stenosis classified as "typical" shares many features of parachute mitral valve, parachute-like mitral valve, hammock, and arcade. All are principally defined by subannular pathology, with normal or even dilated true annulus. The overlap between parachute mitral valve, parachute-like, arcade, and hammock has prompted the suggestion that they lie on a continuum and are not discrete entities.<sup>21</sup> We will describe a systematic operative approach applicable to all these lesions, with reference to specific lesions where special attention is warranted. The approach aims sequentially at all levels of restrictive valve architecture. A fibroelastic layer adherent to the leaflet is carefully dissected from the true leaflet, starting from the atrial side at the annulus and working toward the free edge, in a manner similar to that of supravalvar ring resection. Orificial restriction is relieved by commissurotomies. In the case of true parachute mitral valve, the leaflets act as a single funnel-shaped structure, and commissures are designed in "assumed" locations that radiate from the papillary muscle tip toward each trigone.<sup>22</sup> Restrictive interchordal spaces are opened by chordal thinning and chordal fenestration. Papilllary muscles are split

where fused or closely spaced. In true parachute mitral valve, the single papillary muscle requires aggressive and complete splitting, and possibly thinning, to permit optimal separation in diastole (Fig. 39-6). Particularly referable to Hammock mitral valve, posterior leaflet restriction can be alleviated by detaching the leaflet from the annulus, reflecting it away from the annulus to expose the subvalvar pathology. This exposure permits the division of any secondary chordae or papillary attachments, and the alleviation of leaflet tethering by the separation of fused papillary muscle from the ventricular free wall (Fig. 39-7). 19 Where shortened chordae insert directly into ventricular free wall without a distinct papillary muscle, papillary-like structures can be sculpted by splitting muscle tissue away from true ventricular free wall.<sup>22</sup> With optimal mobilization of the leaflets, anterior and posterior leaflet height can be assessed and patch augmentation carried out as necessary to produce full leaflet mobility. Artificial chordae can be constructed to support prolapsing or unsupported portions of the rehabilitated valve. 19

Intraoperative valve testing is performed by infusing saline into the ventricle. Intraoperative echocardiography is an essential adjunct to assure the integrity of any valve repair.

Patch augmentation (right) further mobilizes the leaflet to permit coaptation with the anterior leaflet.

#### **CONGENITAL MITRAL INSUFFICIENCY**

Levy and Edwards classified congenital mitral insufficiency into four categories: (1) cleft leaflet (anterior or posterior), (2) anterior leaflet tissue deficiency, (3) double orifice mitral valve, and (4) anomalous mitral chordae.<sup>23</sup> We will organize our description of primary congenital mitral valve pathology around these major categoric headings, and further describe the growing spectrum of reoperative mitral valve pathology.

#### Cleft Leaflet

Mitral valve cleft can occur in isolation, but is more commonly associated with primum atrial septal defect, partial or complete AVSD. The cleft is centrally situated on the anterior leaflet, and is an inverted "V"-shaped separation of the halves of the leaflet toward the papillary muscles. While the central portion of the normal anterior leaflet has chordal support from both papillary muscles and ample leaflet surface to form a stable zone of apposition with the posterior leaflet, the cleft leaflet may suffer from insufficient leaflet material and insufficient chordal support in the central zone of apposition, producing a central regurgitant jet, and challenging the integrity of repair (Fig. 39-8).<sup>24</sup>

#### **Double Orifice Mitral Valve**

**Double orifice mitral valve** is defined as a single annulus with two complete orifices, as distinct from **duplicate mitral valve**, where there are two complete and distinct valves with complete annuli. In double orifice mitral valve, the smaller orifice is typically posteromedial, and the bridging tissue between orifices can be complete or partial.<sup>12</sup> though stenosis can be present, the physiologic consequence of double orifice mitral valve is predominantly insufficiency. There is frequent association with additional cardiac defects, most typically

some form of AVSD, or in combination with obstructive pathologies of the left heart. 12

### Ebstein's Malformation of the Mitral Valve

This exceedingly rare entity is characterized by MR from a posterior leaflet that is flattened against the ventricular wall and with apical annular displacement.<sup>12</sup>

## INDICATIONS FOR OPERATIVE INTERVENTION FOR MITRAL INSUFFICIENCY

Indications for operative intervention for congenital mitral insufficiency are also identical to those for acquired disease, and are outlined in the 2014 AHA/ACC consensus guidelines.<sup>20</sup> In brief, mitral surgery is recommended for symptomatic patients with chronic severe MR and left

ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >30%, or for asymptomatic patients with chronic severe MR and LV dysfunction (LVEF 30 to 60% or LV end-systolic dimension, LVESD  $\geq$  40 mm). Asymptomatic patients with chronic severe MR and preserved LV function (LVEF >60%, LVESD < 40 mm) are considered for repair if judged a high likelihood of durable success, or in the setting of new onset AF, resting pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery pressure >50 mm Hg), or in the setting of concomitant cardiac surgery.  $^{20}$ 

## REPAIR TECHNIQUES FOR MITRAL INSUFFICIENCY

Repair of an isolated cleft may be performed with direct closure if adequate anterior leaflet is present (Fig. 39-9). When found in association with double orifice mitral valve, complete cleft closure can result in stenosis, and valve replacement may be an only option when insufficiency persists. 12 At repair of mitral valve cleft, it is important to study the leaflet morphology to treat any deficiencies in the surface area. In those cases, simple cleft closure alone is ineffective, and leaflet augmentation should be considered in conjunction with cleft closure. The simplest augmentation for mitral cleft fills the primary inverted "V" deficiency that is central and at the zone of apposition. A wedge-shaped patch of glutaraldehyde-fixed pericardium can be used to augment the deficit directly. To prevent prolapse of the augmented central segment, chordal transfer or chordal construction can be added to the repair strategy (Fig. 39-9).<sup>25</sup>

In more complicated, often reoperative cases, leaflet dysplasia with deficient surface area may extend beyond the central portion of the leaflet, precluding effective repair by direct closure or central leaflet augmentation alone. Generalized deficient, dysplastic leaflet may require a radial leaflet detachment from the annulus with patch augmentation to produce or restore adequate leaflet height and mobility, and to effect competent coaptation (Fig. 39-9).<sup>26</sup>

Further maneuvers to improve coaptation surface at repair include posterior leaflet quadrangular resection and eccentric posterior annular reduction.<sup>27</sup> Posterior leaflet quadrangular resection with reduction posterior annuloplasty, chordal shortening, lengthening, and replacement techniques is discussed in detail in previous chapters.
