# Surgical Treatment of Complications of Myocardial Infarction, Ventricular Septal Defect, Myocardial Rupture, and Left Ventricular Aneurysm

Donald D. Glower

Acute myocardial infarction can require surgical intervention for many reasons. Most commonly, patients may have coronary artery stenosis that may be amenable to coronary artery bypass grafting, either to halt the progress of the acute infarction, or to prevent subsequent angina, reinfarction, or death (see Chapters 20 to 25). Myocardial infarction can also result in refractory congestive heart failure and/or circulatory shock due to inability of the left and/or right ventricles to maintain the cardiovascular circulation. These patients may benefit from ventricular replacement therapy that include cardiac transplantation (see Chapter 61), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (see Chapter 19) or placement of left and/or right ventricular assist devices (see Chapter 63). Acute myocardial infarction can have a number of other mechanical consequences that may need to be addressed surgically. These can include acute and chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation and even papillary muscle rupture (see Chapter 38) and functional tricuspid regurgitation (see Chapter 44). Three final and potentially catastrophic mechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction are addressed in this chapter and include postinfarction ventricular septal defect, cardiac rupture, and left ventricular aneurysm.

# POSTINFARCTION VENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT

Postmortem description of a postinfarction ventricular septal defect was first made in 1845 by Latham.<sup>1</sup> The first antemortem clinical diagnosis of a postinfarction ventricular septal defect was made in 1923 by Brunn.<sup>2</sup> Sager<sup>3</sup> in 1934 established specific clinical criteria for diagnosis and

associated postinfarction septal rupture with coronary artery disease.

The first successful surgical repair of a postinfarction ventricular septal defect was made in 1956 by Cooley in a patient 9 weeks after the diagnosis of septal rupture. The approach used was a right ventriculotomy similar to that used in patients with congenital ventricular septal defects. Thereafter the surgical mortality was sufficiently high that the strategy was to limit operation to those patients surviving for more than a month after acute septal perforation.<sup>5</sup> Delayed surgery also had the advantage of allowing septal healing to facilitate more secure closure of the septal rupture.<sup>6</sup> Heimbecker<sup>6</sup> described septal defect repair through a left ventriculotomy in the zone of infarction combined infarctectomy and aneurysmectomy.7 Approaching the septal defect through the left ventricular infarct had distinct advantages of providing better exposure of the apical and inferior septum than did a right ventriculotomy. The left ventriculotomy also did not unnecessarily injure the otherwise critical right ventricle and allowed surgical remodeling of the infarcted portion of the left ventricle. Daggett et al8 in 1977 first reported a large series of 43 patients with improved surgical outcomes using a combination of infarctectomy and prosthetic patch material. In addition to the improved results overall, Daggett et al were able to successfully treat inferoposterior septal defects that previously had been problematic.9-11 In 1995 David described 44 patients treated with infarct excluding patches with excellent mortality of 19% and unusually low incidence of right ventricular dysfunction in two of 44 patients. 12 Today, percutaneous septal defect closure devices are evolving to have a role in selected patients, 13 and ventricular replacement therapy is finding use in some septal defect patients with extensive ventricular damage and inability to maintain end organ perfusion. $^{14}$ 

#### Incidence

Ventricular septal defect occurs in 1 to 2% of all acute myocardial infarctions, typically 3 to 5 days after the onset of symptoms.<sup>15</sup> Rupture of the interventricular septum with resultant ventricular septal defect can occur as early as hours after infarction or as late as 2 weeks. 16,17 This timing correlates well with the maximal tissue necrosis from acute myocardial infarction with minimal healing having occurred. Patients with postinfarction ventricular septal defect are most likely to be men; but because women are less likely to present with transmural infarction, some suggest that women with transmural infarction are actually at somewhat higher risk of developing postinfarction ventricular septal defect. Older age and total occlusion of the infarct vessel with minimal collateralization are also associated with postinfarction ventricular septal defect. The onset of early coronary reperfusion using thrombolytics or angioplasty may have shortened the time between infarction and septal rupture in some patients, perhaps due to hemorrhagic reperfusion of the infarct. However, the overall incidence of postinfarction ventricular septal defect appears to have declined in the last two decades with the increased prevalence of early coronary perfusion and the decreased number of large, nonreperfused infarctions.<sup>18</sup> In the GUSTO I trial of thrombolysis for infarction due to total occlusion of a coronary vessel, 19 the median age of patients with postinfarction ventricular septal defect was 72 years with 43% of septal defect patients versus 75% of remaining patients being male, and a higher incidence of hypertension and diabetes in the septal defect group. Infarctions were anterior in 70% of septal defect patients, with 29% being inferior and 1% presenting other cardiac zones. Single vessel coronary disease was present in 50% of septal defect patients, and 57% had total occlusion of the infarct vessel with the median restenosis being 100%. Shock was present in 67% of patients, and 89% had heart failure. Thirty-day mortality was 74%, and 1-year mortality was 76% with 33% of patients undergoing bypass surgery. Survival was significantly higher for anterior infarctions (20/39 (51%)) versus inferior infarction being survival being two of 22 (9%).

## Pathophysiology

Postinfarction ventricular septal defect generally involves transmural infarction of the interventricular septum with subsequent dissection of ventricular blood into the septal myocardium, resulting in a ventricular septal defect. Patients with postinfarction septal defects generally have larger infarcts involving 26% of the left ventricular wall as opposed to only 15% of the left ventricular wall in other infarction, 15 and most have single vessel disease. Patients with acute postinfarction septal defect tend to have greater right ventricular infarction than other patients with acute infarction. The

interventricular septal defect may be large and single, as is commonly seen with anterior infarctions. On the other hand, there may be multiple defects in the septum and a serpiginous course through the septum, as is more common with inferior infarctions producing ventricular septal defects. Because of the large volume of myocardial infarction in patients with postinfarction ventricular septal defects, roughly half of septal defect patients who survive the acute phase develop ventricular aneurysms, as opposed to only 12% of acute infarction patients without ventricular septal defects developing ventricular aneurysms.<sup>22</sup> Roughly one-third of postinfarction ventricular septal defect patients will have some degree of mitral regurgitation due to left ventricular dilation and altered papillary and annular geometry.<sup>23</sup>

Once the ventricular septal defect occurs, shunting of blood from the left ventricle to the right ventricle occurs with subsequent development of left and/or right ventricular heart failure. The combination of left to right shunting along with impairment of right and/or left ventricular contractility can produce low cardiac output and cardiogenic shock with end organ malperfusion progressing to death within days to weeks. In patients with postinfarction ventricular septal defect, left ventricular muscle loss is significant enough that one-third or more of all patients may not have a survivable amount of remaining myocardium without ventricular replacement therapy. 18 Heart failure and shock are the primary causes of ultimate death. Right ventricular failure leading to shock and death is more common with inferior than anterior infarction due to more extensive right ventricular infarction along with left to right shunting.

## **Natural History**

Without surgical intervention, the natural history of postinfarction ventricular septal defect is that nearly 25% of patients will be dead within 24 hours, 50% in one week, 65% in 2 weeks, and 80% within four weeks, with 1-year survival being 5 to 20%.<sup>24</sup> Those who survived the initial few days to 2 weeks tend to have smaller degrees of shunting and smaller infarctions. Spontaneous closure of the postinfarction ventricular septal defect has been seen but is quite rare.

#### Clinical Presentation

The typical patient with a postinfarction ventricular septal defect initially presents with a large transmural anterior myocardial infarction. Most will appear to be convalescing in the initial few days, whereupon a new systolic murmur is noted, recurrent chest pain may develop, and hemodynamics may deteriorate with onset of dyspnea, tachycardia, hypotension, and oliguria.

## Diagnosis

On clinical examination, 90% of patients with postinfarction ventricular septal defect will have a new, harsh, pansystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border, usually with

a palpable thrill. Chest radiographic will commonly show progressive pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. The electrocardiogram will continue to reflect transmural myocardial infarction in the appropriate zone, with occasional transient partial atrioventricular conduction block occurring around the time of rupture. Unfortunately, no electrocardiographic findings are highly predictive or diagnostic of septal rupture itself.

The differential diagnosis of postinfarction ventricular septal defect in a patient with acute onset of congestive heart failure and a new systolic murmur several days after transmural myocardial infarction importantly involves acute ischemic mitral regurgitation with or without papillary muscle rupture. While echocardiography is the definitive means of distinguishing between these two entities, several clinical associations might lead to early suspicion of one versus the other. Septal rupture occurs most commonly in anterior infarctions, while papillary muscle rupture is more common with inferoposterior infarctions. The murmur of septal rupture tends to be greatest at the left lower sternal border with a palpable thrill in more than half of patients, while the murmur of mitral regurgitation tends to radiate towards the left axilla.

Today, echocardiography is the definitive means of making the diagnosis of postinfarction ventricular defect and differentiating it from other complications such as acute mitral regurgitation. <sup>25</sup> Echocardiography can also provide reasonably accurate information in terms of the location and size of the septal defect and associated ventricular wall motion abnormalities. Mitral and/or tricuspid regurgitation can be quantified along with an assessment of left ventricular and right ventricular size and contractility.

In the absence of diagnostic echocardiography, right heart catheterization or placement of a Swan-Ganz pulmonary artery catheter can be diagnostic of a significant left to right shunt inherent (1.4:1 to 8:1 or more) due to postinfarction ventricular septal defect. Right heart catheterization can provide cardiac output, central venous pressure, and pulmonary artery pressure for prognostic value and to optimize medical management. Preoperative right heart catheterization may not be needed if the diagnosis is firm based on echocardiography.

Today, many patients with postinfarction ventricular septal defect already had left heart catheterization on presentation with transmural infarction and may have already had reperfusion of the infarct vessel. If this has not been done at the time of presenting with a septal defect, then the decision to perform left heart catheterization prior to correcting the septal defect is controversial. Left heart catheterization can identify or even treat residual coronary stenoses. However, the mortality benefit from reperfusion of the infarct vessel diminishes rapidly once the patient is more than several hours into the infarction. Moreover, the relatively high incidence of single vessel disease in postinfarction ventricular septal defect patients and the risk of volume overload and nephrotoxicity from dye all suggest that the decision to perform coronary angiography after the onset of septal rupture needs to be made on a case-by-case basis.

## Indications for Operation

Because of the high mortality of postinfarction ventricular septal defects and because of the progressive volume overload due to left to right shunting, postinfarction ventricular septal defects should ideally be corrected in any patient who appears to be viable. Correction of the septal defect should also be performed as soon as possible to minimize subsequent end organ damage due to heart failure and hypoperfusion. Some patients may have sufficiently poor likelihood of surviving an operation that medical and/or percutaneous therapy might be more attractive. The timing of surgery may be emergent, urgent, or delayed depending upon the patient's situation. The main reasons for delay might be to optimize the patient hemodynamically, to obtain adequate diagnostic information, and to optimize volume status as best possible in a very short period of time. Once these goals have been accomplished in a period of no more than 12 to 24 hours, further delay of surgery tends to only result in a sicker patient going to operation.<sup>18</sup> Exceptions might be patients with relatively small shunts and/or other overriding surgical contraindications where the septal defect might reasonably be closed on a delayed basis once the other acute conditions are sufficiently corrected. In the past, significant delays in operation simply selected out those patients likely to survive long term in either event, with many otherwise potentially salvageable patients succumbing in the interim.

## Preparation for Operation

Because of the rapidly life-threatening nature of postinfarction ventricular septal defects with 50 to 60% of patients having severe congestive heart failure or low cardiac output, these patients should be managed in an intensive care setting. 26 Preoperative management has three important goals: (1) to maintain cardiac output and arterial pressure for adequate end organ perfusion, (2) to reduce systemic vascular resistance to decrease the left to right shunt, and (3) to maintain adequate coronary blood flow. 27 The surgical team should be involved immediately upon making the diagnosis of a postinfarction ventricular septal defect. Placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump should be an early intervention to achieve some of these goals by improving coronary blood flow and decreasing the left to right shunt by decreased left ventricular outflow resistance. 28

Pharmacologic therapy for postinfarction ventricular septal defect patients includes inotropic agents to improve end organ perfusion in the face of impaired right and/or left ventricular function. In addition, intravenous diuretics are generally needed early on to treat pulmonary edema. Intravenous vasodilators such as sodium nitroprusside, nitroglycerin, or calcium-channel blockers can occasionally be helpful, but most patients are sufficiently hypotensive to not tolerate significant doses of these agents. Because these patients all have significant ventricular dysfunction that may not improve with surgery, some patients may need evaluation for mechanical ventricular replacement therapy on an acute basis. This could

include extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or right and/ or left ventricular assist devices. In general, those patients receiving this type of support before operation are those who are poor candidates for surgical closure of the septal defect at the time of evaluation but in whom the end organ dysfunction is felt to be reversible. Preoperative support over a period of time could allow some healing of infarct tissue and some recovery of stunned myocardium, in addition to allowing recovery of other end organs, at the expense of the multiple risks of cardiac assist devices. Postinfarction ventricular septal defect patients have an inherent risk of right to left shunting from an isolated left ventricular assist device alone. As a result, many patients might need biventricular support or at most partial left heart support.

### **Operative Techniques**

#### **OVERVIEW**

Repair techniques for a postinfarction ventricular septal defect and can be classified based on the location of the infarct and on whether the approach of infarct excision versus exclusion is used. Infarctectomy with or without patch closure of the infarct is a technique applicable to some septal infarctions and some apical infarctions to ensure suturing to viable myocardium that will heal. Table 25-1A lists the principles of the infarctectomy as stated by Daggett. Infarct exclusion potentially allows less distortion of ventricular geometry but still requires suturing to viable myocardium. Table 25-1B lists the principles of infarct exclusion has stated by David. Eeptal defects due to apical infarction are amenable either

## TABLE 25-1B: Principles of Exclusion Repair of Postinfarction VSD

Transinfarct approach to ventricular septal defect

- No infarctectomy unless necrotic muscle along ventriculotomy is sloughing during closure
- Bovine pericardial patch in either an oval (anterior defect) or triangular (posterior defect) shape is sutured securely with continuous Prolene around the defect to exclude it from the LV cavity
- Where necessary, full-thickness bites are taken to the epicardial surface and anchored by strips of pericardium or Teflon (see text for details)
- 4. An anterior patch is anchored to noninfarcted septum below the defect, then the noninfarcted endocardium of the anterolateral ventricular wall. If the infarct involves the base of the anterior muscle, full thickness anchoring bites are used
- 5. A posterior patch is anchored to the mitral annulus, noninfarcted septum, and through the infarcted posterior wall along a line corresponding to the medial margin of the posteromedial papillary muscle (with full thickness anchoring)
- Closure of the infarctectomy using strips of pericardium or Teflon
- 7. When possible, infarcted right ventricular free wall is left undisturbed during closure

infarctectomy or exclusion techniques. Septal defects due to anterolateral infarction generally require an exclusion patch on the septum, often with primary closure of the left ventriculotomy. Septal defects due to inferior infarction generally require an exclusion patch on the septum and patch closure of the ventriculotomy.

#### INTRAOPERATIVE CONSIDERATIONS

Patients with postinfarction ventricular septal defects are often in cardiogenic shock, intolerant of vasodilation and needing inotropic support during the induction of anesthesia. If not already present, an intra-aortic balloon pump may be placed to ensure stability during induction. Pulmonary vasodilators and venous vasodilators should be avoided to minimize left-to-right shunting. A Swan-Ganz pulmonary artery catheter should be placed to assist postoperative inotropic management.

Median sternotomy is the incision of choice. Cardiopulmonary bypass should be to accomplished with bicaval venous drainage and bicaval isolation to avoid entraining air into the venous line given that the right heart will be open through the septal defect. Postinfarction septal defects are best repaired in the arrested heart with careful attention to good myocardial protection given the already impaired by ventricular performance in these patients. The use of concurrent coronary bypass grafting depends upon surgical philosophy and the coronary anatomy of the each patient. Some groups argue that concurrent coronary bypass grafting and left heart catheterization can delay surgery, add unnecessary risks, and is unlikely to benefit already infarcted myocardium. The incidence of late, clinically significant, untreated coronary disease in patients receiving isolated repair of postinfarction ventricular septal defects has in fact been low in several series. <sup>31</sup> Others argue that concurrent bypass grafting could potentially improve myocardial protection and reduce late myocardial ischemia.

In weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, an intra-aortic balloon pump should be used if possible. Multiple inotropes will be needed, and intravenous milrinone and inhaled nitric oxide may be of particular value. In patients who cannot be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass using standard techniques, the use of the left and/or right ventricular assist device could be considered (see Chapter 63).<sup>14</sup> In postinfarction ventricular septal defect patients, one particularly needs to be cognizant of potential residual right to left shunting with resultant hypoxemia when an isolated left ventricular assist device is used.

Postoperative hemostasis can be a problem in these critically ill patients. Routine use antifibrinolytic agents such as \(\varepsilon\)-aminocaproic acid (Amicar) can be helpful. Seguin and others have recommended application of a fibrin sealant to the ventricular septum around the septal defect before formal repair, \(^{32}\) followed by biological glue applied to bleeding suture lines after repair. Transfusion of appropriate blood products and isolated clotting factors may be needed, given the tissue fragility along with intolerance of ongoing bleeding or any degree of postoperative tamponade.

#### REPAIR OF APICAL SEPTAL RUPTURE

Daggett described the technique of apical amputation in 1970<sup>8</sup> where necrotic apical myocardium is resected back to left ventricle, right ventricle, and septum (Figs. 25-1A and B). The remaining apical defect is then closed using interrupted mattress sutures of 1-0 Tevdek securing the left and right ventricular walls to the interventricular septum with strips of Teflon felt outside the left ventricular wall, outside the right ventricular wall, and on either side of the interventricular septum (Figs. 25-2A and B).<sup>8,27</sup> After all sutures have been tied, the closure is reinforced with running suture, to ensure hemostasis.

#### ANTERIOR REPAIR WITH INFARCTECTOMY

Postinfarction septal defects due to anterior infarction are generally approached through a linear incision in the anterior infarct parallel to the left anterior descending artery, with infarctectomy or debridement of nonviable tissue as described by Daggett<sup>27</sup> (Fig. 25-3). Shumacker<sup>33</sup> described a plication closure of small anterior septal defects by the free anterior edge of the debrided septum to the right ventricular free wall using mattress sutures of 1-0 Tevdek over strips of felt (Fig. 25-4A).

Ao, aorta; LAD, left anterior descending coronary artery; LV, left ventricle; RV, right ventricle; stippled region, infarcted myocardium.<sup>27</sup>

The transinfarct left ventriculotomy is then closed with a second row of mattress sutures buttressed with strips of Teflon felt (see Figs. 25-4B-D), followed by an outer hemostatic running suture line for ventriculotomy closure.<sup>27,34</sup>

In septal defects that are not small and anteriorly located, the debrided septal defect should be closed with a prosthetic patch of Dacron or bovine pericardium to reduce tension on the repair as described by Daggett<sup>27,34</sup> (see Fig. 25-5). After debridement of necrotic septum and left ventricular muscle, a series of pledgeted interrupted mattress sutures are placed around the perimeter of the defect (see Fig. 25-5A). Along the posterior aspect of the defect, sutures are passed through the septum from right to left. Along the anterior edge of the defect, sutures are passed from the epicardial surface of the right ventricle to the endocardial surface. All sutures are placed before the patch is inserted, and then passed through the edge of a synthetic patch, which is seated on the left side of the septum (see Fig. 25-5B). Each suture is then passed through an additional pledget and all are tied. We use additional pledgets on the left ventricular side overlying the patch (see Fig. 25-5C) to cushion each suture as it

Repair is made by approximating the left ventricle, apical septum, and right ventricle using interrupted mattress sutures of 1-0 Tevdek with buttressing strips of Teflon felt. Felt strips are used within the interior of the left and right ventricles as well as on the epicardial surface of each ventricle. (B) All sutures are placed before any are tied. A second running over-and-over suture (not shown) is used, as in left ventricular aneurysm repair, to ensure a secure hemostatic ventriculotomy closure.

is tied down to prevent cutting through the friable muscle. The edges of the ventriculotomy are then approximated by a two-layer closure consisting of interrupted mattress sutures passed through buttressing strips of Teflon felt or bovine pericardium and a final outer running suture.<sup>27</sup>

# POSTERIOR/INFERIOR REPAIR WITH INFARCTECTOMY

Postinfarction defects of the inferoposterior septum after inferolateral infarction have been the most challenging to repair because geometry does not lend itself to simple plication. Daggett in 1974 described the technique of infarctectomy and patch closure which for the first time yielded reliably good results. However, today many surgeons feel that the inferoposterior septal defects are particularly better suited to an exclusion technique as opposed to infarctectomy. With the heart arrested and the left ventricle vented,

**FIGURE 25-3** Transinfarct left ventricular incision to expose an anterior septal rupture. An incision (dashed line) is made parallel to the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery (LAD) through the center of the infarct (stippled area) in the anterior left ventricle (LV). Ao, aorta; LA, left atrium; PA, pulmonary artery; RV, right ventricle.<sup>27</sup>

the heart is retracted out of the pericardial to expose the posterior descending coronary artery and the inferior infarction which may involve both ventricles (Fig. 25-6A). As described by Daggett<sup>27,35</sup> a transinfarct incision is made in the left ventricle, and the left ventricular portion of the infarct is excised (see Fig. 25-6B), exposing the septal defect. The left ventricular papillary muscles are inspected. If indicated, mitral valve replacement is performed through a separate conventional left atrial incision, to avoid trauma to the friable ventricular muscle. After all the infarcted left ventricular muscle has been excised, a less aggressive debridement of the right ventricle is accomplished, with the goal of resecting only as much muscle as is necessary to afford complete visualization of the defect(s). Using this technique, delayed rupture of the right ventricle has not been a problem. If the posterior septum has cracked or split from the adjacent ventricular free wall without loss of a great deal of septal tissue, then the septal rim of the posterior defect may be approximated to the edge of

the diaphragmatic right ventricular free wall using mattress sutures buttressed with strips of Teflon felt or bovine pericardium (see Figs. 25-6C and D).<sup>27,35</sup>

Larger posterior defects require patch closure (Fig. 25-7). 27,35 Pledgeted mattress sutures are placed from the right side of the septum and from the epicardial side of the right ventricular free wall (Fig. 25-7B). All sutures are passed through the perimeter of the patch and then through additional pledgets, and are then tied (Fig. 25-7C). Thus, as in closure of large anterior defects, the patch is secured on the left ventricular side of the septum. Because direct closure of the remaining infarctectomy is rarely possible due to tension on the edges of the large defect, a Dacron prosthetic patch is generally required. Pledgeted mattress sutures are passed out through the margin of the infarctectomy (endocardium to epicardium) and then through the patch (Fig. 25-7D), which is seated on the epicardial surface of the heart. After each suture is passed through an additional pledget, all sutures are

tied (Fig. 25-7E). The cross-sectional view of the completed repair (Fig. 25-8) illustrates the restoration of relatively normal ventricular geometry, which is accomplished by the use of appropriately sized prosthetic patches.<sup>27</sup>

## ANTERIOR AND INFEROPOSTERIOR REPAIR BY INFARCT EXCLUSION

The work of Dor and others led to the concept of ventricular endoaneurysmorrhaphy<sup>36</sup> or placing an intracavitary endocardial patch to exclude infarcted myocardium while maintaining ventricular geometry and thus preserving left ventricular function. David,<sup>7</sup> Cooley,<sup>37</sup> Ross<sup>38</sup> and others applied the infarct exclusion endocardial patch technique to repair of postinfarction ventricular septal defects, with good results in some centers but mixed results in others. The endocardial patch technique described by David<sup>7</sup> was felt by Daggett and others to be particularly helpful in some patients with

![](_page_7_Picture_2.jpeg)

FIGURE 25-5 (A) Larger anterior septal defects require a Dacron patch, which is sewn to the left side of the ventricular septum with interrupted mattress sutures, each of which is buttressed with a pledget of Teflon felt on the right ventricular side of the septum and anteriorly on the epicardial surface of the right ventricular free wall. All sutures are placed before the patch is inserted. (B and C) Additional pledgets are placed on the left ventricular side overlying the patch to cushion each suture as it is tied down to prevent cutting through the friable muscle.

inferoposterior septal defects.<sup>27</sup> For anterior septal rupture, Daggett described the technique of David<sup>12,39</sup> as follows.<sup>27</sup>

The interventricular septum is exposed via a left ventriculotomy made through the infarct starting at the apex and extending proximally parallel to, but 1 to 2 cm away from, the anterior descending artery (Fig. 25-9A).<sup>27,39</sup> Stay sutures are passed through the margins of the ventriculotomy to aid in the exposure of the infarcted septum. The septal defect is located and the margins of the infarcted muscle identified. A bovine pericardial patch is tailored to the shape of the left ventricular infarction as seen from the endocardium but 1 to 2 cm larger. The patch is usually oval and measures approximately 4 × 6 cm in most patients. The pericardial patch is then sutured to healthy endocardium all around the infarct (see Fig. 25-9B). Suturing begins in the lowest and most proximal part of the noninfarcted endocardium of the septum with a continuous 3-0 polypropylene suture. Interrupted mattress sutures with felt pledgets may be used to reinforce the repair. 38,40 The patch

is also sutured to the noninfarcted endocardium of the anterolateral ventricular wall. The stitches should be inserted 5 to 7 mm deep in the muscle and 4 to 5 mm apart. The stitches in the patch should be at least 5 to 7 mm from its free margin so as to allow the patch to cover the area between the entrance and exit of the suture in the myocardium. This technique minimizes the risk of tearing muscle as the suture is pulled taut. If the infarct involves the base of the anterior papillary muscle, the suture is brought outside of the heart and buttressed on a strip of bovine pericardium or Teflon felt applied to the epicardial surface of the left ventricle. Once the patch is completely secured to the endocardium of the left ventricle, the left ventricular cavity becomes largely excluded from the infarcted myocardium. The ventriculotomy is closed in two layers over two strips of bovine pericardium or Teflon felt using 2-0 or 3-0 polypropylene sutures, as illustrated in Fig. 25-9C. No infarctectomy is performed unless the necrotic muscle along the ventriculotomy is sloughing at the time of its closure, and

**FIGURE 25-6** (A) View of an inferior infarct (stippled area) associated with posterior septal rupture. The apex of the heart is to the right. Exposure at operation is achieved by dislocating the heart up and out of the pericardial sac, and then retracting its cephalad, as in the performance of distal vein bypass and anastomosis to the posterior descending artery. (B) The inferoposterior infarct is excised to expose the posterior septal defect. Complete excision of the left ventricular portion of the infarct is important to prevent delayed rupture of the ventriculotomy repair. The free edge of the right ventricle is progressively shaved back to expose the margins of the defect clearly. (C and D) Repair of the posterior septal rupture is accomplished by approximating the edge of the posterior septum to the free wall of the diaphragmatic right ventricle with felt-buttressed mattress sutures. The repair is possible when the septum has cracked or split off from the posterior ventricular wall without necrosis of a great deal of septal muscle. The surgeon can perform repair of posterior septal rupture to best advantage by standing at the left side of the supine patient. The left ventriculotomy is then closed as a separate suture line, again with interrupted mattress sutures of 1-0 Tevdek buttressed with felt strips.

(C) All sutures are placed and then the Dacron patch is slid into place on the left ventricular side of the septum. The patch sutures are tied down with an additional felt pledget placed on top of the patch (left ventricular side) as each suture is tied, to cushion the tie and prevent cutting through the friable muscle. These maneuvers are viewed by Daggett et al.<sup>27</sup> as essential to the success of early repair of the posterior septal rupture. (D) Remaining to be repaired is the posterior left ventricular free wall defect created by infarctectomy. Mattress sutures of 2-0 Tevdek are placed circumferentially around the margins of the posterior left ventricular free wall defect. Each suture is buttressed with a Teflon felt pledget on the endocardial side of the left ventricle. With all sutures in place, a circular patch, fashioned from a Dacron graft, is slid down onto the epicardial surface of the left ventricle. An additional pledget of Teflon felt is placed under each suture (on top of the patch) as it is tied to cushion the tie and prevent cutting through the friable underlying muscle. This onlay technique of patch placement prevents the cracking of friable left ventricular muscle that occurred with the eversion technique of patch insertion. (E) Completed repair.

even then it is minimized, because infarcted muscle will not be exposed to left ventricular pressures when the heart begins to work (see Fig. 25-9D). Alternatively, sutures can be passed through the ventricular free wall and through a tailored external patch of Teflon or pericardium (Fig. 25-10).<sup>27</sup>

In patients with inferoposterior septal defects, an incision is made in the inferior wall of the left ventricle 1 or 2 mm from the posterior descending artery (Fig. 25-11A).<sup>27,39</sup> This incision is started at the midportion of the inferior wall and extended proximally toward the mitral annulus and distally toward the apex of the ventricle. Care is taken to avoid damage to the posterolateral papillary muscle. Stay sutures are passed through the fat pad of the apex of the ventricle and margins of the ventriculotomy to facilitate exposure of the ventricular cavity. In most cases, the rupture is found in the proximal half of the posterior septum, and the posteromedial papillary muscle is involved by the infarction. A bovine pericardial patch is tailored in a triangular shape of approximately  $4 \times 7$  cm in most patients. The base of the triangularshaped patch is sutured to the fibrous annulus of the mitral valve with a continuous 3-0 polypropylene suture starting at a point corresponding to the level of the posteromedial papillary muscle and moving medially toward the septum until the noninfarcted endocardium is reached (see Fig. 25-11B). At that level, the suture is interrupted and any excess patch material trimmed. The medial margin of the triangular-shaped patch is sewn to healthy septal endocardium with a continuous 3-0 or 4-0 polypropylene suture taking bites the same size

as those described for anterior defects. In this area of the septum, reinforcing pledgeted sutures may be required. The lateral side of the patch is sutured to the posterior wall of the left ventricle along a line corresponding to the medial margin of the base of the posteromedial papillary muscle. Because the posterior wall of the left ventricle is infarcted, it is usually necessary to use full-thickness bites and anchor the sutures on a strip of pericardium or Teflon felt applied on the epicardial surface of the posterior wall of the left ventricle right at the level of the posteromedial papillary muscle insertion, as shown in Fig. 25-11B. Once the patch is completely sutured to the mitral valve annulus, the endocardium of the interventricular septum, and the full thickness of the posterior wall (see Fig. 25-11C), the ventriculotomy is closed in two layers of full-thickness sutures buttressed on strips of pericardium or Teflon felt (see Fig. 25-11D). The infarcted right ventricular wall is left undisturbed. If the posteromedial papillary muscle is ruptured, mitral valve replacement is necessary.<sup>27</sup>

Daggett and others<sup>27</sup> feel that the theoretical advantages in the technique of infarct exclusion are: (1) It does not require resection of myocardium; excessive resection results in depression of ventricular function and insufficient resection predisposes to recurrence of septal rupture; (2) it maintains ventricular geometry, which enhances ventricular function; and (3) it avoids tension on friable muscle, which may diminish postoperative bleeding.

#### OTHER TECHNIQUES

Many have minor variants to the endocardial infarct exclusion technique have been described utilizing the principles

stated above. 41-43 Asai 44 described an approach through the right ventricle which may be appropriate for some patients but which has all of the issues with the original right ventricular approached use by Cooley and others years earlier. 4

#### PERCUTANEOUS CLOSURE

Percutaneous closure of postinfarction ventricular septal defects has been performed with a number of devices, including those used to close congenital atrial or ventricular septal defects. 45-47 These devices can be placed through the systemic venous circulation into the right ventricle to access the septal defect, or through the arterial system and the left ventricle to approach the septal defect, or both. Calvert<sup>47</sup> reported 53 cases with percutaneous closure of postinfarction ventricular septal defects with complete shunt reduction in 23%, partial shunt reduction in 62%, and a 5-day post procedure length of stay. Percutaneous devices certainly have the theoretical advantage of avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass and the morbidity of open-heart surgery in an otherwise sick patient. However, technical issues exist with current devices, both in delivering the device to the defect (which may occur at most any location in the interventricular septum) and in obtaining a durable closure of large defects in a thick septum with poorly defined, necrotic edges. Problems have been reported with recurrent septal defects due to continued necrosis of septal tissue<sup>48</sup> and device migration or embolization.<sup>46</sup>

Results of percutaneous closure may be somewhat better 2 weeks or more after infarction, but surgical results are also better in those patients who are able to delay intervention. 45,49 Hybrid approaches have been reported where percutaneous devices were placed intraoperatively using open exposure on cardiopulmonary bypass to avoid a ventriculotomy. To date, the best application of percutaneous catheter-based devices for postinfarction ventricular septal defects may be in those with recurrent or residual defects after surgical therapy. The percutaneous closure of postinfarction ventricular septal defects can be obtained safely, even on a partial basis, the approach may have some role in palliating critically ill patients who might ultimately tolerate more definitive surgical intervention at a later date.

#### HIGHLIGHTS OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Impaired biventricular performance with low cardiac output is frequent in these patients and may require gradual weaning of inotropic support and the intra-aortic balloon pump over several days. Intravenous milrinone and inhaled nitric oxide may benefit some patients. Correction of hypoxia, hypercarbia, and acidosis can be important to maintain normal right ventricular afterload (see Chapters 12 and 18). Acute renal insufficiency and pulmonary edema are also frequent and require careful volume management, early postoperative diuresis, and the use of positive end-expiratory pressure ventilation (see Chapter 18). Ventricular and atrial arrhythmias can be poorly tolerated and can often be managed with intravenous amiodarone.

## **Early Results**

#### **HOSPITAL MORTALITY**

Operative mortality defined as death before discharge or within 30 days of operation, ranged from 30 to 50%. <sup>27,40,52-55</sup> In the Massachusetts General Hospital experience of 114 patients, Daggett reported an operative mortality of 37% (Fig. 25-12A) with the risk of death falling rapidly after 1 year

(see Fig. 25-12B).<sup>27</sup> The independent risk factors for early death were: older age, higher blood urea nitrogen (BUN), emergency surgery, higher right atrial pressure, and preoperative uses of catecholamines.<sup>27</sup> Inferoposterior location of the septal rupture has been associated with an increased operative mortality.<sup>21</sup> This has been attributed to a more technically difficult repair, the increased risk of associated mitral regurgitation, and associated right ventricular dysfunction

Circles represent each death, positioned on the horizontal axis at the interval from operation to death, and actuarially (Kaplan-Meier method) along the vertical axis. The vertical bars represent 70% confidence limits (± 1 SD).

The estimate is shown with 70% confidence limits.<sup>27</sup>

that is an independent predictor of early mortality after posterior infarction. A short time interval between infarction and operation selects for sicker patients unable to be managed medically.

Daggett reviewed the Massachusetts General Hospital experience and concluded that patients cover a wide range of risk determined most notably by hemodynamic instability (emergency surgery and use of inotropes) (Figs. 25-13 and 25-14).<sup>27</sup> Daggett also concluded that a small group of highrisk patients dramatically affected the overall mortality rate, possibly explaining the tremendous variability in mortality rates between institutions with different patient selection and referral patterns, independent of surgical technique.

#### IN-HOSPITAL COMPLICATIONS

Daggett et al reported that the most common cause of death after repair of acute postinfarction ventricular septal defect was low cardiac output syndrome (52%), with technical failures

such as recurrent or residual septal defect and bleeding in 23%, sepsis (17%), recurrent infarction (9%), cerebrovascular complications (4%), and intractable ventricular arrhythmias.<sup>27</sup>

stabilized at a much lower level after about 1 year. Actuarial survival at 5 years series ranged between 40 and 60% (Fig. 25-12).<sup>27,40,52-54</sup> For hospital survivors, 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival have been reported at 91, 70, and 37%, respectively (Fig. 25-15).<sup>27</sup> The multivariable predictors of late death were: older age, previous myocardial infarction, higher creatinine, higher right atrial pressure, and the presence of left main coronary disease.<sup>27</sup>

#### SYMPTOMATIC IMPROVEMENT

Ultimately survivors also can have good functional status with Daggett reporting that 75% were in New York Heart Association functional class I, and 12.5% were class II.<sup>9</sup>

#### RECURRENT VENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECTS

Using echocardiography, recurrent or residual septal defects have been observed to occur in 10 to 25% of patients.  $^{56}$  Large residual septal defects with a Qp:Qs > 2.0 should undergo a repair while smaller defects may be managed medically and may occasionally close spontaneously. Percutaneous approaches for these small residual septal defects have been preferred when possible. Surgical closure of late postoperative particular septal defects have been reported via a right atrial approach.  $^{57,58}$ 

# ACUTE VENTRICULAR FREE WALL RUPTURE

#### **Definition**

Left ventricular free wall rupture is similar to rupture of the interventricular septum, except for the location of the rupture. Acute left ventricular free wall rupture is a life-threatening complication of myocardial infarction that requires early intervention. In those unusual patients who survive the initial acute, 2-week phase of ventricular free wall rupture without

diagnosis and/or therapy, this entity will ultimately evolve into a pseudoaneurysm of the left ventricular free wall. These later-phase patients have generally undergone some pericardial healing at the site of infarction, and their management more resembles that of patients with chronic true aneurysms of the left ventricle (see Chapter 26).

## History

The first known case of left ventricular free wall rupture after myocardial infarction was described by William Harvey in 1647.<sup>59</sup> In 1765, Morgagni reported 11 postmortem cases of myocardial rupture<sup>60</sup> and ultimately himself later died of myocardial rupture. The first successful surgical treatment of free wall rupture of the right ventricle was reported by Hatcher in 1970.<sup>61</sup> FitzGibbon<sup>62</sup> in 1971 and Montegut<sup>63</sup> in 1972 reported the first successful repairs of postinfarction left ventricular free wall rupture.

#### Incidence

Left ventricular free wall rupture is a relatively common finding in an autopsy series of patients expiring early after acute myocardial infarction, occurring in 10 to 30% of such patients. 64,65 In clinical series of early death after acute myocardial infarction, ventricular rupture may be the second cause of death after cardiogenic shock. Postinfarction ventricular free wall rupture may be more common in elderly patients, and women, and in patients suffering their first infarction.<sup>66</sup> The peak incidence of postinfarction left ventricular free wall rupture occurred at a median of 5 days after infarction.<sup>67</sup> However, thrombolysis and early coronary perfusion may have resulted in an increased number of ventricular ruptures occurring at earlier times, as early as hours after the onset of infarction.<sup>68</sup> In a recent series of 1290 acute myocardial infarction patients, most of whom were reperfused, left ventricular free wall rupture occurred in 1.3%.69 Because anterolateral infarctions are more common than inferior infarction in general, some series report the anterolateral wall as the most common sight of rupture.<sup>64</sup> Other series suggest that a posterolateral or inferior infarction is itself more likely to result in free wall rupture than is anterior infarction.<sup>65</sup>

## Etiology

Acute left ventricular free wall rupture is most commonly due to acute myocardial infarction, with either blunt or penetrating trauma being another common etiology. Prior cardiac surgery, such as mitral valve replacement or transapical aortic valve replacement, can result in acute left ventricular free wall rupture. To more postoperative pericarditis is mature 2 weeks or more postoperatively, prior cardiac surgery is more likely to produce chronic left ventricular pseudoaneurysms instead of acute free wall rupture with tamponade. Other etiologies such as pericardial infection or cardiac tumor have rarely resulted in left ventricular free wall rupture. The treatment of acute left ventricular free wall rupture not

due to infarction will be similar to that of postinfarction rupture, except that underlying coronary disease and myocardial infarction will generally be absent.

## Pathophysiology

Postinfarction left ventricular free wall rupture can present on an acute, subacute, or chronic basis. Acute ventricular free wall rupture, in generally, results in acute pericardial tamponade, followed by shock, electromechanical dissociation, and death within a few minutes. Subacute rupture may initially involve a smaller ventricular wall tear which becomes partially sealed by clot and pericardial adhesions. Chronic left ventricular free wall rupture is by definition a left ventricular pseudoaneurysm which results when pericardial adhesions are sufficient to prevent free rupture for 2 weeks or more. Chronic left ventricular pseudoaneurysms generally have a narrow neck, contain no myocardial cells in the wall, and have a high propensity to convert to an acute rupture. On rare occasion, left ventricular free wall rupture can present with simultaneous rupture of the interventricular septum, right ventricular rupture, or rupture of a papillary muscle head.<sup>72,73</sup> Risk factors associated with left ventricular pseudoaneurysm in 290 patients included older age, female gender, hypertension, and inferolateral myocardial infarction.<sup>74</sup> The most common location for left ventricular pseudoaneurysm in these 290 patients was posteroinferior, in contrast to true left ventricular aneurysms which are more common in the anterolateral region.<sup>74</sup>

The pathophysiology of left ventricular free wall rupture involves initial transmural myocardial infarction followed by expansion and thinning of the infarcted wall until the elastic strength of the free wall is exceeded by the forces generated by left ventricular systole. Transmural myocardial infarction is, in turn, associated with lack of collateral blood flow. In infarct expansion and thinning results from slippage between muscle bundles and tearing of the surrounding protein matrix. Ventricular rupture may be associated with systemic hypertension which can increase infarct thinning and wall stress. Thrombolysis has not had any clear positive or negative effect on the incidence of left ventricular rupture, 68,78,79 although early coronary reperfusion is associated with less transmural infarction which in turn should prevent some infarctions from turning into rupture.

## **Natural History**

Acute left ventricular free wall rupture generally results in death within minutes of the onset of recurrent chest pain. <sup>67,80</sup> In an autopsy series, most patients dying from left ventricular free wall rupture died acutely. <sup>81-83</sup> Subacute rupture of the left ventricular free wall, in one series, was associated with a median survival time of 8 hours, <sup>81</sup> while another study showed that 69% of such patients died within minutes of the onset of symptoms. <sup>84</sup> Chronic rupture or pseudoaneurysm of the left ventricular free wall has a less well-defined prognosis. While rare patients may present with pseudoaneurysm of the

left ventricular free wall years after myocardial infarction, <sup>85</sup> postinfarction left ventricular pseudoaneurysm is clearly associated with a high probability of early rupture. <sup>83,86</sup>

#### **Clinical Presentation**

The patient with acute or subacute rupture of the left ventricular free wall generally presents with recurrent chest pain followed by a rapid, severe hemodynamic instability due to development of cardiac tamponade and resultant low cardiac output, often followed ultimately by ventricular fibrillation and/or electromechanical dissociation. Clinically these phenomena may manifest as sudden death or syncope with physical findings of hypotension, distended neck veins, pulsus paradoxus, and cardiogenic shock from the underlying cardiac tamponade. Subacute left ventricular rupture may clinically resemble infarct extension or right ventricular failure. Chronic left ventricular rupture or pseudoaneurysm presents most commonly with congestive heart failure. Table 12.7.4

## **Diagnosis**

The primary means of diagnosing postinfarction left ventricular rupture is echocardiography. Echocardiography may show definitive evidence of a ventricular wall defect systolic and/or systolic blood flow outside the wall of the ventricle. Highly suggestive but less definitive echocardiographic findings associated with left ventricular rupture include the presence of pericardial effusion over 10 mm, echo-dense masses in a pericardial effusion, and signs of tamponade such as early diastolic collapse of the right atrium and right ventricle and increased respiratory variation in transvalvular blood flow velocities. 81,87 Aspiration of uncoagulated blood on pericardiocentesis can be suggestive of left ventricular rupture but has an incidence of false-positive and false-negative results. Aspiration of clear fluid on pericardiocentesis definitively excludes cardiac rupture.<sup>87</sup> Oliva<sup>64</sup> reported several factors associated with postinfarction left ventricular rupture in 70 consecutive patients. Some predictive value has been reported for the development of pericarditis, repetitive emesis, restlessness and agitation, recurrent or persistent ST segment elevation, and persistent T-wave changes after 48 to 72 hours.<sup>65</sup>

## Indications for Operation

Because most patients with acute or subacute rupture of the left ventricular free wall expire within minutes to hours of onset, the diagnosis or even a high suspicion of acute left ventricular free wall rupture is itself an indication for emergent operation. At present, no acute interventional procedure is reliable in treating this catastrophic event. Chronic pseudoaneurysm of the left ventricular free wall has a significant risk of rupture and should be treated surgically.<sup>73,88-91</sup> Alapati<sup>92</sup> reported that less than 0.1% of all myocardial infarctions resulted in left ventricular pseudoaneurysm but that death occurred in the 48% patients with chronic pseudoaneurysm of the left ventricular free wall with medical therapy.

## Preparation for Operation

Acute postinfarction rupture of the left ventricular wall requires a high index of suspicion and emergent surgery for survival. A One report suggested that emergent percutaneous intrapericardial injection of fibrin glue immediately after pericardiocentesis A may allow some patients to get to surgery. Subacute postinfarction rupture of the left ventricle similarly requires emergent surgery once the diagnosis is made without further delay for coronary angiography. Volume resuscitation, inotropic support, intra-aortic balloon pump, and possibly pericardiocentesis may temporize the pericardial tamponade on the way to surgery.

## **Operative Techniques**

#### ACUTE OR SUBACUTE FREE WALL RUPTURE

Patients being operated for postinfarction rupture of the left ventricular free wall are generally quite unstable with pericardial tamponade and recent transmural myocardial infarction. Much of the patient preparation in the operating room may be conducted while the patient is awake and minimally sedated to avoid hypotension. One should consider exposure of the femoral artery and femoral vein in the groin for rapid institution of cardiopulmonary bypass, even before median sternotomy.

Median sternotomy is the incision of choice with rapid institution of cardiopulmonary bypass, preferably from the femoral vessels. Opening the pericardium can quickly result in significant hemorrhage from the ventricular tear that may be difficult to control manually without further hemodynamic compromise until on cardiopulmonary bypass. Just a few minutes of inadequate brain perfusion can result in a poor neurologic outcome. In exceptional cases where there are no other indications for cardiopulmonary bypass such as posterior wall rupture, mitral regurgitation, ventricular septal rupture, or graftable coronary disease, good short-term results have been reported for repairing ventricular rupture without cardiopulmonary bypass<sup>80,88</sup> or without aortic clamping. Once on cardiopulmonary bypass, having an arrested heart with venting of the left ventricular cavity can facilitate obtaining a dry and motionless field for manipulation of friable tissue.

For repairing an acute or subacute for left ventricular free wall rupture, surgical techniques resemble those for left ventricular pseudoaneurysm repair, with the exception that the acutely or subacutely infarcted tissue is much more friable and has not had time to develop any fibrous content. Standard linear closure with large horizontal mattress sutures buttressed by two strips of Teflon felt has been reported but is limited by myocardial friability. Better results have been reported using linear closure between strips of Teflon felt, if the entire ventricular tear and surrounding infarct is covered with a plastic patch secured to the surrounding normal myocardium using a continuous polypropylene suture (Fig. 25-16).<sup>27</sup> A more radical approach would be to perform infarct excision and closure of the defect with either pledgeted sutures or a Dacron patch,<sup>95</sup> but this technique might

best be reserved for specific indications such as the presence of a postinfarction ventricular septal defect.

Frequent reports have described using one of many biological glues to attach a patch of either Teflon felt or bovine pericardium to the ventricular tear, with or without running a polypropylene suture around the edge of the patch secured to the surrounding normal myocardium.<sup>88</sup> This technique has the advantage of avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass but has been reported to have some risk of late pseudoaneurysm formation.<sup>96</sup>

#### Results

The literature only contains several small series of surgical repair of acute or subacute left ventricular free wall rupture. Padró<sup>88</sup> reported 13 survivors and a mean follow up of 26 months using a biological glue and Teflon patch technique, without cardiopulmonary bypass in most patients. Other series have reported an operative mortality around 50%. <sup>84,97,98</sup>

#### LEFT VENTRICULAR ANEURYSM

#### Definition

Left ventricular aneurysm has been strictly defined as a distinct area of abnormal left ventricular diastolic contour with systolic dyskinesia or paradoxical bulging (Fig. 25-17). 99,100 Yet, a growing number of authors favor defining left ventricular aneurysm more loosely as any large area of left ventricular akinesia or dyskinesia that reduces the left ventricular ejection fraction. 101-103 This broader definition has been justified by data suggesting that the pathophysiology and treatment may

be the same for ventricular akinesia and for ventricular dyskinesia. 102,104 However, recent studies suggest that the optimal treatment and outcomes of patients with akinetic segments versus dyskinetic segments might be different. 105,106 Intraoperatively, a left ventricular aneurysm may also be identified as an area that collapses upon left ventricular decompression. 101,104,107 True left ventricular aneurysms involve bulging of the full thickness of the left ventricular wall, whereas a false aneurysm of the left ventricle is, in fact, a rupture of the left ventricular wall contained by surrounding pericardium.

## History

Left ventricular aneurysms have long been described at autopsy, but left ventricular aneurysm was not recognized to be a consequence of coronary artery disease until 1881.<sup>108</sup> The angiographic diagnosis of left ventricular aneurysm was first made in 1951.<sup>108</sup> A congenital left ventricular aneurysm was first treated surgically by Weitland in 1912 using aneurysm ligation. In 1944, Beck<sup>109</sup> described fasciae latae plication to treat left ventricular aneurysms. Likoff and Bailey 110 successfully resected a left ventricular aneurysm through a thoracotomy in 1955 using a special clamp without cardiopulmonary bypass. The modern treatment era began in 1958 when Cooley et al<sup>111</sup> successfully performed a linear repair of a left ventricular aneurysm using cardiopulmonary bypass. More geometric ventricular reconstruction or surgical ventricular restoration (SVR) techniques were subsequently devised by Stoney et al, 112 Daggett et al, 113 Dor et al, 36 Jatene, 114 and Cooley et al. 115,116 In 2009, the results of the randomized STICH trial comparing coronary bypass grafting with or without surgical ventricular restoration were published, casting some doubt on the value of repairing small aneurysms or small akinetic segments. 105

#### Incidence

The incidence of left ventricular aneurysm in patients suffering from myocardial infarction has varied between 10 and 35%, depending on the definition and the methods used. Of patients undergoing cardiac catheterization in the CASS study, 7.6% had angiographic evidence of left ventricular aneurysms.<sup>117</sup> The absolute incidence of left ventricular aneurysms may be declining because of the increased use of thrombolytics and revascularization early after myocardial infarction.<sup>118,119</sup>

## Etiology

More than 95% of true left ventricular aneurysms reported in the English literature result from coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. True left ventricular aneurysms also may result from trauma, <sup>120</sup> Chagas' disease, <sup>121</sup> or sarcoidosis. <sup>122</sup> A very small number of congenital left ventricular aneurysms also have been reported and have been termed *diverticula* of the left ventricle. <sup>123</sup>

False aneurysms of the left ventricle result most commonly from contained rupture of the ventricle 5 to 10 days after myocardial infarction and often occur after circumflex coronary arterial occlusion. False aneurysm of the left ventricle also may result from submitral rupture of the ventricular wall, a dramatic event that generally occurs after mitral valve replacement with resection of the mitral valve apparatus. <sup>124</sup> Left ventricular pseudoaneurysm may also result from septic pericarditis or any prior operation on the left ventricle, aortic annulus, or mitral annulus. Pseudoaneurysm can occur after transapical or transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). <sup>126</sup>

## Pathophysiology

The development of a true left ventricular aneurysm involves two principal phases: early expansion and late remodeling.

#### **EARLY EXPANSION PHASE**

The early expansion phase begins with the onset of myocardial infarction. Ventriculography can demonstrate left ventricular aneurysm formation within 48 hours of infarction in 50% of patients who develop ventricular aneurysms. The remaining patients have evidence of aneurysm formation by 2 weeks after infarction. 127

True aneurysm of the left ventricle generally follows transmural myocardial infarction because of acute occlusion of the left anterior descending or dominant right coronary artery.

Lack of angiographic collaterals is strongly associated with aneurysm formation in patients with acute myocardial infarction and left anterior descending artery occlusion, <sup>128</sup> and absence of re-formed collateral circulation is probably a prerequisite for formation of a dyskinetic left ventricular aneurysm (Table 25-2). At least 88% of dyskinetic ventricular aneurysms result from anterior infarction, and the remainder follow inferior infarction. <sup>108</sup> Posterior infarctions that

Wall thinning

produce a distinct dyskinetic left ventricular aneurysm are relatively unusual. 129

In experimental transmural infarction without collateral circulation, myocyte death begins 19 minutes after coronary occlusion. Infarctions that result in dyskinetic aneurysm formation are almost always transmural and may show gross thinning of the infarct zone within hours of infarction. Within a few days, the endocardial surface of the developing aneurysm becomes smooth with loss of trabeculae and deposition of fibrin and thrombus on the endocardial surface in at least 50% of patients. Because most myocytes within the infarct are necrotic, viable myocytes often remain within the infarct zone. In a minority of patients, extravascular hemorrhage occurs in the infarcted tissue and may further depress systolic and diastolic function of involved myocardium. Inflammatory cells migrate into the infarct zone by 2 to 3 days after infarction and contribute to lysis of the necrotic myocytes by 5 to 10 days after infarction. Electron microscopy demonstrates disruption of the native collagen network several days after infarction. Collagen disruption and myocyte necrosis produce a nadir of myocardial tensile strength between 5 and 10 days after infarction, when rupture of the myocardial wall is most common. Left ventricular rupture is relatively rare after the ventricular aneurysmal wall becomes replaced with fibrous tissue.

Loss of systolic contraction in the large infarcted zone and preserved contraction of surrounding myocardium cause systolic bulging and thinning of the infarct. By Laplace's law (T = Pr/2h), at a constant ventricular pressure (P), increased radius of curvature (r) and decreased wall thickness (h) in the infarcted zone both contribute to increased muscle fiber tension (T) and further stretch the infarcted ventricular wall.

Relative to normal myocardium, ischemically injured or infarcted myocardium displays greater *plasticity* or *creep*, defined as deformation or stretch over time under a constant load. <sup>130</sup> Thus increased systolic and diastolic wall stress in the infarcted zone tends to produce progressive stretch of the infarcted myocardium (termed *infarct expansion*)<sup>131</sup> until healing reduces the plasticity of infarcted myocardium.

Transmural infarction without significant hibernating myocardium within the infarct region is necessary for

subsequent development of a true left ventricular aneurysm. Angiographic ventricular aneurysms with evidence of hibernating myocardium (lack of Q waves or presence of uptake on technetium scan, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, for example) may resolve over days to weeks and thus do not represent true left ventricular aneurysms by strict criteria. 132,133

Because of increased diastolic stretch or preload and elevated catecholamines, remaining noninfarcted myocardium may demonstrate increased fiber shortening and, ultimately, myocardial hypertrophy in the presence of a left ventricular aneurysm. <sup>134</sup> This increased shortening and increased wall stress increase oxygen demand for noninfarcted myocardium and for the left ventricle as a whole.

In addition to increased regional wall stresses, left ventricular aneurysm can increase ventricular oxygen demand and decrease net forward cardiac output by producing a ventricular volume load because a portion of the stroke volume goes into the aneurysm instead of out of the aortic valve. Net mechanical efficiency of the left ventricle (external stroke work minus myocardial oxygen consumption) is decreased by reducing external stroke work (volume times pressure) and increasing myocardial oxygen consumption.

Left ventricular aneurysms can produce both systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction. Diastolic dysfunction results from increased stiffness of the distended and fibrotic aneurysmal wall, which impairs diastolic filling and increases left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.

#### LATE REMODELING PHASE

The remodeling phase of ventricular aneurysm formation begins 2 to 4 weeks after infarction when highly vascularized granulation tissue appears. This granulation tissue is subsequently replaced by fibrous tissue 6 to 8 weeks after infarction. As myocytes are lost, ventricular wall thickness decreases as the myocardium becomes largely replaced by fibrous tissue. In larger infarcts, the thin scar is often lined with mural thrombus.<sup>135</sup>

After acute myocardial infarction, animal studies show that ventricular load reduction with 8 weeks of nitrate therapy may reduce expected infarct thinning, decrease infarct stretch, and lessen hypertrophy of noninfarcted myocardium. 136 Interestingly, nitrate therapy for only 2 weeks after infarction does not prevent aneurysm formation. This observation emphasizes the importance of late remodeling from 2 to 8 weeks after infarction. Angiotensin converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors also reduce infarct expansion and subsequent development of ventricular aneurysm. 137 Because animal studies show that ACE inhibitors nonspecifically suppress ventricular hypertrophy, it is not clear whether suppression of the compensatory hypertrophy of surrounding myocardium is ultimately beneficial or harmful. Intravenous administration of atrial natriuretic factor for 4 weeks has improved ventricular function, dimensions, and fibrosis in rats. 138

Lack of coronary reperfusion is probably a prerequisite for development of left ventricular aneurysm. In humans, reperfusion of the infarct vessel either spontaneously, 132 by thrombolysis, 139 or by angioplasty 140 has been associated with

a lower incidence of aneurysm formation. It is speculated that coronary reperfusion as late as 2 weeks after infarction prevents aneurysm formation by improving blood flow and fibroblast migration into the infarcted myocardium. The role of delayed infarct healing in aneurysm development is supported by observations that steroids after myocardial infarction may increase the likelihood of aneurysm formation. <sup>141</sup>

Arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia may occur at any time during the development of a ventricular aneurysm, and all these patients have the substrate for reentrant conduction pathways within the heterogeneous ventricular myocardium. These pathways tend to involve border zones surrounding the ventricular aneurysm (see Chapter 57).

## **Natural History**

The excellent prognosis of asymptomatic patients with dyskinetic ventricular aneurysms who were treated medically was demonstrated in a series of 40 patients followed for a mean of 5 years. <sup>100</sup> Of 18 initially asymptomatic patients, six developed class II symptoms and 12 remained asymptomatic. The 10-year survival was 90% for these patients but was only 46% at 10 years in patients who presented with symptoms (Fig. 25-18). <sup>100</sup>

Although an earlier autopsy series reported relatively poor survival in patients with medically managed left ventricular dyskinetic aneurysms (12% at 5 years), most recent studies report 5-year survival from 47 to 70%. 100,117,142-144 Causes of death include arrhythmia in 44%, heart failure in 33%, recurrent myocardial infarction in 11%, and noncardiac causes in 22%. 100 The natural history of patients with akinetic rather than dyskinetic left ventricular aneurysms is less well documented. 105

Factors that influence survival with medically managed left ventricular dyskinetic aneurysm include age, heart failure score, extent of coronary disease, duration of angina, prior infarction, mitral regurgitation, ventricular arrhythmias, aneurysm size, function of residual ventricle, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. 100,144 Early development of

aneurysm within 48 hours after infarction also diminishes survival. 127

In general, the risk of thromboembolism is low for patients with aneurysms (0.35% per patient-year),<sup>142</sup> and long-term anticoagulation is not usually recommended. However, in the 50% of patients with mural thrombus visible by echocardiography after myocardial infarction, 19% develop thromboembolism over a mean follow-up of 24 months.<sup>145</sup> In these patients, anticoagulation and close echocardiographic follow-up may be indicated. Atrial fibrillation and large aneurysmal size are additional risk factors for thromboembolism.

The natural history of left ventricular pseudoaneurysm is not well documented. Frank rupture of chronic left ventricular pseudoaneurysms is less common than one might expect. Begin Rupture of left ventricular pseudoaneurysms may be most likely in the acute phase or in large-sized pseudoaneurysmsms. Left ventricular pseudoaneurysms tend to behave similarly to true aneurysms in that they may present a volume load to the left ventricle or may be a source of embolization or endocarditis. Left ventricular pseudoaneurysms after prior cardiac surgery have also been reported to compress adjacent structures such as the pulmonary artery or esophagus.

#### Clinical Presentation

Angina is the most frequent symptom in most series of operated patients with left ventricular aneurysm. Given that three-vessel coronary disease is present in 60% or more of these patients, the frequency of angina is not surprising. 91

Dyspnea is the second most common symptom of ventricular aneurysm and often develops when 20% or more of the ventricular wall is infarcted. Dyspnea may occur from a combination of decreased systolic function and diastolic dysfunction.

Either atrial or ventricular arrhythmias may produce palpitations, syncope, or sudden death, or aggravate angina and dyspnea in up to one-third of patients. Thromboembolism is unusual but may produce symptoms of stroke, myocardial infarction, or limb or visceral ischemia.

## Diagnosis

The electrocardiogram frequently demonstrates Q waves in the anterior leads along with persistent anterior ST-segment elevation (Fig. 25-19). The chest radiograph may show left ventricular enlargement and cardiomegaly (Fig. 25-20), but the chest radiograph is not usually specific for left ventricular aneurysm.

Left ventriculography is the gold standard for diagnosis of left ventricular aneurysm. The diagnosis is made by demonstrating a large, discrete area of dyskinesia (or akinesia), generally in the anteroseptal-apical walls. Occasionally, left ventriculography also may demonstrate mural thrombus. Quantitative definition of left ventricular aneurysms has been accomplished using a centerline analysis of left ventricular wall motion on left ventriculography in the 30° right anterior oblique view. Hypocontractile segments contracting more than two standard

![](_page_20_Figure_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 25-19** Electrocardiogram showing persistent ST-segment elevation with pathologic Q waves in a 72-year-old man with left ventricular aneurysm.

deviations out of normal range have also been defined as aneurysmal (Fig. 25-21). 92,102 Outward motion is termed *dyskinetic*, and remaining aneurysmal segments are termed *akinetic*. The fraction of total left ventricular circumference that is aneurysmal can thus be computed as the value %A. 103

Two-dimensional echocardiography is also a sensitive and specific means of diagnosing left ventricular aneurysm. Echocardiography can detect mural thrombus or mitral valve regurgitation, and echocardiography can often distinguish false aneurysm from true aneurysm by demonstrating a defect in the true ventricular wall.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most reliable means of assessing left ventricular volume in the presence of left ventricular aneurysm<sup>146,147</sup> (Fig. 25-22). Magnetic

resonance imaging (MRI) can accurately define left ventricular aneurysms and can detect mural thrombus. 146 Yet, distinguishing true aneurysms from pseudoaneurysms remains difficult, even with magnetic resonance imaging. 148 Gated radionuclide angiography reliably detects left ventricular aneurysms, and thallium scanning or positron emission tomography (PET) can be helpful early after infarction to differentiate a true aneurysm from hibernating myocardium with reversible dysfunction.

## Indications for Operation

Because of the relatively good prognosis for asymptomatic left ventricular aneurysm, <sup>100</sup> no indications for repairing chronic,

asymptomatic aneurysms are established. Yet, in low-risk patients during operation for associated coronary disease, investigators report repairing large, minimally symptomatic aneurysms. <sup>108,149</sup> On the other hand, operation is indicated for symptoms of angina, congestive heart failure, or selected ventricular arrhythmias (see Chapter 57) (Table 25-3). For these symptomatic patients, operation offers better outcome than medical therapy.

To be worthy of operation, a dyskinetic or akinetic left ventricular aneurysm should significantly enlarge left ventricular end-systolic volume index (>80 mL/m²) and end-diastolic volume (>120 mL/m²). These volume criteria are, however, poorly defined and limited by technical difficulty

in measuring left ventricular volume in aneurysmal left ventricles. Because of data suggesting that akinetic versus dyskinetic aneurysms have similar results, Dor and others feel that dyskinesia is not a prerequisite for aneurysm repair.  $^{102,103}$  Nonetheless, the only randomized trial (the STICH trial) has suggested that little benefit is obtained in terms of survival or symptoms in patients who on average have smaller, akinetic aneurysmal segments (end-systolic volume index 82 mL/m² and 50 to 56% of anterior wall involved).  $^{105}$ 

Operation is indicated in viable patients with contained cardiac rupture, with or without development of a false aneurysm. Because left ventricular pseudoaneurysms may have a tendency to rupture when acute or of larger size (either with or without symptoms), operation is indicated.<sup>89-91</sup> Similarly, congenital aneurysms have a presumed risk of rupture and should undergo repair independently of symptoms. Rarely, embolism is an indication for operation in medically treated patients at high risk for repeated thromboembolism. The role of operation in asymptomatic patients with very large aneurysms or documented expansion of aneurysms is uncertain.

Relative contraindications to operation for left ventricular aneurysm include excessive anesthetic risk, impaired function of residual myocardium outside the aneurysm, resting cardiac index less than 2.0 L/min/m², significant mitral regurgitation, evidence of nontransmural infarction (hibernating myocardium), and lack of a discrete, thin-walled aneurysm with distinct margins. Global ejection fraction may be less useful than ejection fraction of the basal, contractile portion of the heart in determining operability.<sup>150</sup>

Angioplasty has an uncertain role in the treatment of left ventricular aneurysms but may be indicated in patients with suitable coronary anatomy, one- or two-vessel disease, a contraindication for operation, or asymptomatic status with inducible ischemia.

## Preparation for Operation

All patients being considered for operation should undergo right- and left-sided heart catheterization with coronary arteriography and left ventriculography. Patients with at least 2+ mitral regurgitation at cardiac catheterization should have echocardiography to assess the mitral valve and to look for intrinsic mitral valve disease not amenable to annuloplasty. Magnetic resonance imaging can be helpful to assess left ventricular volumes and aid in planning the size and extent of left ventricular reconstruction. <sup>151</sup> Patients with significant thrombus in the left ventricular cavity should ideally be treated with 4-6 weeks of anticoagulation prior to operation to avoid the risk of embolism.

Preoperative electrophysiologic study is clearly indicated in any patient with preoperative ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. The decision to perform an electrophysiologic study in patients without preoperative ventricular arrhythmias is controversial, because the incidence of postoperative ventricular arrhythmias is low and not changed by endocardial resection at the time of operation. <sup>108</sup> Electrophysiologic study is frequently not helpful in patients

with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia occurring within 6 weeks of myocardial infarction.  $^{108}$ 

## **Operative Techniques**

#### **GENERAL OPERATION**

Operation for left ventricular aneurysm (aneurysmectomy, aneurysmorrhaphy, ventricular restoration) requires cardio-pulmonary bypass and a balanced anesthetic technique, as generally used for coronary bypass grafting. After induction of anesthesia and endotracheal intubation, an electrocardio-gram monitor, a Foley catheter, a radial arterial line, and a Swan-Ganz catheter are placed. A median sternotomy is performed, and the patient is given heparin. Saphenous vein or arterial conduits are prepared.

Cardiopulmonary bypass is begun after cannulating the ascending aorta. A single, two-stage cannula is generally adequate to cannulate the right atrium, but dual venous cannulation should be considered if the right ventricle is to be opened. Epicardial mapping is performed if necessary. The

![](_page_22_Figure_9.jpeg)

Documented expansion/large size Angina Congestive heart failure Arrhythmia Rupture Pseudoaneurysm Congenital aneurysm Embolism Documented expansion/large size left ventricle is inspected to identify an appropriate area of thinned ventricular wall. A linear vertical ventriculotomy, generally on the anterior wall 3 to 4 cm from the left anterior descending coronary artery, is made (Fig. 25-23). The left ventricle is opened (Fig. 25-24), all mural thrombus is carefully removed, and endocardial mapping is performed if necessary. A left ventricular vent is now placed through the right superior pulmonary vein-left atrial junction after mural thrombus is removed. Coronary arteries to be grafted are identified. Endocardial scar, if present, is resected, and afterwards, endocardial mapping is repeated. Body temperature is maintained at 37°C until intraoperative mapping is completed; thereafter, temperature is decreased to 28 to 32°C.

The ascending aorta is clamped, and the heart is arrested with cold anterograde and/or retrograde cardioplegic solution. Alternatively, the aorta is not clamped and the entire procedure is done during hypothermic fibrillation. The left ventricular aneurysm is repaired using one of the techniques described below. The distal coronary anastomoses are performed, followed by releasing the aortic clamp.<sup>151</sup> Air is removed by venting the ascending aorta and left ventricle while filling the heart and ventilating the lungs with the patient in the Trendelenburg position. The patient is rewarmed, and proximal coronary anastomoses are performed. Once normothermia is achieved, an electrophysiologic study may be repeated, if indicated. Temporary pacing wires are placed on the right atrium and right ventricle, cardiopulmonary bypass is discontinued, and heparin is reversed. The heart is decannulated, and the median sternotomy is closed with mediastinal drains after hemostasis is achieved.

Weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass frequently requires some degree of inotropic support. Typically 5  $\mu g/kg/min$  of dopamine, nitroglycerin to prevent coronary spasm, and nitroprusside for afterload reduction are used. An intra-aortic balloon pump may be needed in patients with borderline ventricular function. Transesophageal echocardiography is

**FIGURE 25-24** With the aneurysm wall opened, thrombus is removed, without injury to the papillary muscles.

useful for assessing left ventricular function and to detect residual intracardiac air.

Additional inotropic support may not increase cardiac output significantly because of abnormal ventricular compliance and may produce arrhythmias and poorly tolerated tachycardia. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia are corrected immediately to minimize arrhythmias. Intraoperative and postoperative ventricular ectopy is treated aggressively with intravenous lidocaine. Intravascular volume shifts are poorly tolerated in these patients because of poor ventricular compliance; therefore, rapid transfusions are avoided by meticulous hemostasis before closing. Because the left ventricle is poorly distensible, stroke volume is relatively fixed, and a resting heart rate between 90 and 115 beats per minute is not unusual to maintain a cardiac index of approximately 2.0 L/min/m².

Growing experience suggests that the ultimate size of the left ventricular cavity at the end of the procedure is critical to patient outcome.

#### **PLICATION**

Plication without opening the aneurysm is reserved for only the smallest aneurysms that do not contain mural thrombus.

![](_page_24_Picture_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 25-25** Linear repair. The fibrous aneurysm wall is excised, leaving a 3-cm rim of fibrous aneurysm wall attached to healthy muscle.

A two-layer suture line of 0 monofilament is placed across the aneurysm using a strip of Teflon felt on either side. The suture line is oriented to reconstruct a relatively normal left ventricular contour and does not exclude all aneurysmal tissue.

#### LINEAR CLOSURE

After removing all mural thrombus, the aneurysmal wall is trimmed, leaving a 3-cm rim of scar to allow reconstruction of the normal left ventricular contour (Fig. 25-25). Care is taken not to resect too much aneurysmal wall and overly reduce ventricular cavity size. A monofilament 2-0 suture may be used to reduce the neck of the aneurysm to the proper size before closure of the ventricular wall. Anterior aneurysm defects are closed vertically between two external 1.5-cm strips of Teflon felt, two layers of 0 monofilament horizontal mattress sutures, and finally, two layers of running 2-0 monofilament vertical sutures with large-diameter needles (Fig. 25-26). Similar techniques can be used in less frequent posterior aneurysm resections.

#### CIRCULAR PATCH

Inferior or posterior aneurysms generally require circular patch closure, which also can be applied to anterior aneurysms. After opening the aneurysm (Fig. 25-27) and after debridement of thrombus and aneurysm wall (Fig. 25-28), a Dacron patch is cut to be 2 cm greater in diameter than the ventricular opening. Interrupted, pledgeted 0 monofilament horizontal mattress sutures are placed through the

ventriculotomy rim and then through the patch, leaving the pledgets outside the ventricular cavity (Fig. 25-29). Sutures are tied, and additional interrupted sutures or a second layer of running 2-0 monofilament is placed for hemostasis.

#### **ENDOVENTRICULAR PATCH**

The endoventricular patch technique is suitable for anterior aneurysms but is less suited for inferior or posterior aneurysms,

![](_page_24_Figure_14.jpeg)

**FIGURE 25-27** Circular patch repair. The aneurysm wall is incised. An inferior aneurysm is shown.

![](_page_25_Picture_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 25-28** Circular patch repair. The aneurysmal wall is excised, leaving a 2-cm rim of fibrous aneurysmal wall attached to healthy muscle.

for which the standard (circular) patch technique is used. After debridement of thrombus, a running 2-0 polypropylene suture may be placed at the aneurysm rim to optimize left ventricular size. 4,17,50,55 Optimizing patch size and residual left ventricular cavity size can be facilitated with plastic or balloon forms (Chase Medical, Richardson, Texas) chosen to leave a left ventricular end-diastolic volume index of 50 to  $60~\text{mL/m.}^{100,147,153}$  If the remaining ventricular defect is small (<3 cm), then the ventricular wall may be closed linearly.<sup>114</sup> More commonly, a patch (bovine pericardium, Dacron cloth, or polytetrafluoroethylene) is cut to size sufficient to restore normal ventricular size and geometry when secured to the aneurysmal rim (Fig. 25-30). The patch is sutured to normal muscle at the aneurysmal circumference using a running 3-0 polypropylene suture that is secured with single sutures at three or four places around the patch circumference. The patch may extend onto the interventricular septum, 92,102,150 or aneurysmal septum may be plicated.<sup>114</sup> Interrupted 3-0

sutures are placed as needed to ensure good fit. Care is taken not to distort the papillary muscles. The aneurysmal rim is trimmed to allow primary closure of the native aneurysmal wall over the patch using two layers of running 2-0 monofilament suture without pledgets (Fig. 25-31).

Compared with linear and circular patch techniques, the endoventricular patch technique has technical advantages. An endoventricular patch preserves the left anterior descending artery for possible grafting and leaves no external prosthetic material to produce heavy pericardial adhesions. The technique facilitates patching the interventricular septum, and is suitable for acute infarctions when tissues are friable. <sup>108,116,153,156</sup>

## OTHER VENTRICULAR REMODELING TECHNIQUES

In addition to the techniques listed above where left ventricular infarct tissue is excised and/or replaced with patch material, an alternative would be to alter the biological properties of the infarct scar. Remaining infarct scar (whether aneurysmal or not) can then be seeded with myoblasts or stem cells which offer the potential to restore cardiac muscle mass and contraction. This technique has been termed *cellular cardiomyoplasty* 

![](_page_26_Picture_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 25-31** Endocardial patch. The aneurysm wall is closed over a Teflon patch after resecting excess aneurysm tissue. A double row of running vertical 2-0 polypropylene suture is used.

and has been done only on a limited basis in humans.<sup>157</sup> In animals, cellular cardiomyoplasty has successfully improved global left ventricular performance and geometry using either myoblasts, stem cells that differentiate into myocytes, fibrocytes, or cells seeded onto a graft matrix.<sup>158-160</sup> Cellular cardiomyoplasty could be done by direct injection of cells at the time of coronary revascularization, or even by transcoronary or intramyocardial injection in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Percutaneous insertion of parachute-like device into the left ventricular apex has had some early success in humans with improvement in left ventricular end-diastolic volumes and heart failure symptoms.<sup>161,162</sup>

#### **CORONARY REVASCULARIZATION**

Concurrent coronary revascularization is performed as in standard coronary bypass procedures. Because the endoventricular patch technique does not encroach on the left anterior descending coronary, the left internal mammary artery may be used to graft the left anterior descending coronary artery.

#### MITRAL REGURGITATION

The severity of mitral regurgitation should be evaluated before cardiopulmonary bypass by intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography. The need for concurrent mitral

![](_page_26_Figure_9.jpeg)

**FIGURE 25-32** Prevalence of performing concomitant mitral valve procedures as a function of preoperative ejection fraction. (Reproduced with permission from Athanasuleas CL, Stanley AWHJr, Buckberg GD, et al: Surgical anterior ventricular endocardial restoration [SAVER] in the dilated remodeled ventricle after anterior myocardial infarction, *J Am Coll Cardiol.* 2001 Apr;37(5):1199-1209.)

valve operation increases as the preoperative ejection fraction decreases (Fig. 25-32). 163 The mitral valve is also inspected from below after opening the aneurysm and beginning repair of the aneurysm. Transventricular mitral valve repair may be done by placing pledgeted polypropylene sutures at both mitral commissures to reduce the circumference of the annulus. 152 This technique produces satisfactory short-term results, but long-term results are not known. Usually the mitral valve is repaired via left atriotomy after completion of the distal coronary anastomoses and before releasing the aortic crossclamp. If mitral regurgitation results from annular dilatation and systolic restriction of leaflet motion (Carpentier type IIIB), an undersized, complete, rigid mitral annuloplasty is generally done. 164

#### CARDIAC TRANSPLANTATION

In symptomatic patients with sufficient depression of global left ventricular function to preclude aneurysm repair, transplantation is a reasonable alternative and may have survival and symptomatic benefit similar to ventricular aneurysm repair at a higher dollar cost. <sup>165</sup>

#### VENTRICULAR FALSE ANEURYSM

Ventricular free wall false aneurysms are repaired with the same techniques used for true ventricular aneurysms based according to the location and size of the aneurysm.<sup>72,73,80</sup> The circular patch technique is particularly useful in that inferior false aneurysms are common and typically have narrow necks. Usually the wall of the false aneurysm is inadequate to close over the defect. False aneurysms resulting from atrioventricular separation after mitral valve replacement generally require removal of the mitral prosthesis, repair of the neck of the aneurysm at the mitral annulus, and re-replacement of the mitral valve.<sup>70</sup> False aneurysms of the left ventricular

apex after transapical aortic valve replacement may be directly repaired small but may require patching if large. 166

## **Early Results**

#### **HOSPITAL MORTALITY**

In a compilation of 3439 operations for left ventricular aneurysm between 1972 and 1987<sup>118</sup> and in a series of 731 ventricular restoration patients from 2002 to 2004,<sup>167</sup> hospital mortality was 9.9 and 9.3%, respectively, and ranged from 2 to 19%. More recent reports suggest that hospital mortality can be as low as 3 to 7% using either patch<sup>108,116,163168,169</sup> or linear closures.<sup>119,149,169</sup> The most common cause of hospital mortality is left ventricular failure, which occurs in 64% of deaths.<sup>149</sup>

Risk factors for hospital mortality include increased age, \$^{118,149,163,167,169}\$ incomplete revascularization, \$^{149}\$ increased heart failure class, \$^{118,167,169-171}\$ female gender, \$^{118,167}\$ emergent operation, \$^{118}\$ ejection fraction less than 20 to 30%, \$^{163,169,170}\$ concurrent mitral valve replacement, \$^{108,118,163,167}\$ preoperative cardiac index < 2.1 L/min/m\$^{100,103,167}\$ mean pulmonary artery pressure > 33 mm Hg, \$^{103}\$ serum creatinine > 1.8 mg/dl, \$^{103}\$ and failure to use the internal mammary artery.

#### IN-HOSPITAL COMPLICATIONS

The most common in-hospital complications are shown in Table 25-4 and include low cardiac output, ventricular arrhythmias, and respiratory failure. 118,119,167-169,172 Low cardiac output may be more common in patients undergoing intra-operative mapping because of perioperative cardiac injury. 173

#### LEFT VENTRICULAR FUNCTION

The preponderance of data from the last two decades have shown that left ventricular function improves in most patients undergoing operation for left ventricular aneurysm. Operation improves ejection fraction whether linear repair<sup>104,104,174-176</sup> or patch repair<sup>116,163,177-181</sup> is used (Fig. 25-33). <sup>176</sup> In a propensity matched series, little difference in outcome was seen between linear versus patch repair. <sup>182</sup> Both techniques decrease end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes <sup>163,175,178,180</sup> and improve exercise response <sup>116,176</sup> (Fig. 25-34). <sup>176</sup> Aneurysmal repair in general may improve diastolic filling, left ventricular diastolic compliance, left ventricular contractility, effective arterial

elastance (Ea), and left ventricular efficiency. <sup>134,179,180,183,184</sup> However, recent studies have suggested little improvement or even worsening of left ventricular diastolic compliance, particularly in patients with large resections or small ventricular size or without large dyskinetic aneurysms preoperatively. <sup>185</sup>

Controversy remains strong regarding whether patch techniques provide results superior to those achieved with linear closures.

**FIGURE 25-35** Computer prediction of the effects of patch size on stroke volume (SV), ejection fraction (EF), and wall stress (afterload) at a chamber pressure of 100 mm Hg. Predictions are based on data from an animal model of simulated aneurysm repair, neglecting the effects of afterload on stroke volume. Because increasing afterload in reality decreases muscle shortening, patch reconstruction can increase stroke volume only if contractile reserve is sufficient to overcome the afterload from increased ventricular size. (Data from Nicolosi AC, Weng ZC, Detwiler PW, et al: Simulated left ventricular aneurysm and aneurysm repair in swine, *J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg.* 1990 Nov;100(5):745-755.)

noted at autopsy that some patients had severe reduction and distortion of ventricular volume after linear repair. The authors proposed that a more geometric repair might avert these problems. Although no prospective studies compare results from the two procedures, several very experienced groups attribute improved symptoms, less low cardiac output, and greater improvement in ejection fraction to a switch to patch techniques. 108,116,188 In other retrospective comparisons, no differences were seen in postoperative symptoms, ejection fraction, echocardiographic ventricular dimensions, or late survival between linear and patch repairs. 175,188-191 In an animal model of simulated aneurysm repair, Nicolosi et al<sup>185</sup> found no difference in left ventricular systolic or diastolic function between linear and patch techniques. Two groups reported that switch to patch techniques was associated with increased operative mortality, perhaps because of excessive volume reduction, 192,193 whereas other groups found improved survival when switching from linear to patch techniques.<sup>194</sup> One metaanalysis has suggested that the better results with patch techniques are the result of more experience in more recent series.188

The durability of functional benefit from aneurysm repair remains poorly documented. In animals and humans, there is a tendency for the initial improvement in ejection fraction, ventricular volume, and filling pressures to diminish over the next 6 weeks to 12 months, <sup>195,196</sup> especially in patients with residual mitral regurgitation.

Although technical differences exist between patch and linear repairs, good functional results are possible with either technique. Suboptimal outcomes result from either technique when left ventricular cavitary volume is overly reduced with resultant decreased stroke volume and impaired diastolic filling. Excessively small patches reduce stroke volume and impair diastolic filling, but excessively large patches reduce ejection fraction and increase wall stress (Fig. 25-35). 185

#### Late Results

#### **SURVIVAL**

Survival after operation for left ventricular aneurysm is variable, largely because of differences between patient populations. Five-year survival in recent series varies between 58 and 80%, 104,170 10-year overall survival is 34%, 170 and 10-year cardiac survival is 57% (Fig. 25-36). 105,170 Cardiac causes are responsible for 57% of late deaths, 173 and most cardiac deaths result from new myocardial infarctions. In aneurysm patients randomized to medical or surgical therapy in the CASS study (most of the patients had minimal symptoms), survival was not different between medical or surgical therapy, except for patients with three-vessel disease. 144 These patients had better survival with surgery (Fig. 25-37). 144

Preoperative risk factors for late death include age, heart failure score, ejection fraction less than 35%, cardiomegaly on chest radiograph, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure greater than 20 mm Hg, and mitral regurgitation<sup>144,149,163,173</sup> (Figs. 25-38, and 25-39).

The prospective, randomized STICH trial of 1000 patients with ejection fraction of 35% or less and anatomy amenable to ventricular restoration showed that, on average, left ventricular restoration techniques did not affect survival relative to coronary bypass grafting alone (Fig. 25-40).105 However, post hoc analysis of STICH data showed that, in patients achieving postoperative left ventricular end-systolic volume index (LVESVI) of less than 70 mL/m<sup>2</sup>, the addition of SVR to coronary bypass improved survival, while the opposite was true for patients achieving LVESVI > 70 mL/m<sup>2</sup>. <sup>196</sup> The results of the STICH trial probably resulted from inclusion of relatively few patients with large, classical, dyskinetic aneurysms (mean reduction of end-systolic volume index of 16 mL/m<sup>2</sup> versus 48 mL/m<sup>2</sup> seen in classical aneurysms). 105,106 Although unproven, the net sum of evidence suggests that patients with large, classical, dyskinetic aneurysms who achieve a postoperative LVESVI

#### SYMPTOMATIC IMPROVEMENT

Studies consistently demonstrate improvement in symptoms after operation relative to preoperative symptoms 104,105,174 (Fig. 25-40). In the study of Elefteriades et al, 174 using a linear repair, mean angina class improved from 3.5 to 1.2 and mean CHF class improved from 3.0 to 1.7. In the randomized CASS study, the subset of patients with left ventricular aneurysm achieved a better heart failure class with surgical therapy than with medicine, and rehospitalization for heart failure was less common for the surgical therapy group than for the medicine group.<sup>144</sup> At 18 months, 85% of patients are free of rehospitalization for congestive heart failure, with rehospitalization peaking at 2 to 4 months. 163 Prucz found in a small, nonrandomized case-control study that ventricular restoration reduced hospitalization rate relative to coronary bypass alone. 199 However, the STICH trial found no benefit on average in symptoms or quality of life relative to coronary bypass alone. 105,200 (Fig 25-24) The STICH trial found that ventricular restoration significantly increased hospital cost by \$14,500 or 26%.<sup>200</sup>
