# Stented Bioprosthetic Aortic Valve Replacement

Bobby Yanagawa • Subodh Verma • George T. Christakis

This chapter provides an overview of aortic valve replacement (AVR) with stented bioprostheses. The *indications for aortic valve surgery* are reviewed with an emphasis on evidence-based guidelines and contemporary clinical and physiologic outcomes of aortic valve surgery with currently available stented bioprostheses.

## NATURAL HISTORY AND INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

### **Aortic Stenosis**

### **NATURAL HISTORY**

Aortic stenosis (AS) is primarily caused by degenerative calcification in patients over 70 years of age and bicuspid aortic valve in patients under 70 years of age in the developed world. Rheumatic valve disease is the third most common cause of AS affecting patients across the age spectrum. AS is also associated with systemic diseases such as Paget's disease of bone and end-stage renal disease. The pathogenetic mechanisms of aortic valve calcification include valvular interstitial cell transformation, inflammation and lipid accumulation, reminiscent of the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic plaques. The overall incidence of calcific AS is rising with the aging population in developed countries. A population-based study of Olmstead County reported the increase in prevalence of degenerative AS and other valvulopathy in patients with age from 55 to 64 (0.6%), 65 to 74 (1.4%) and  $\geq$ 75 years (4.6%; p < .0001, Fig. 28-1).

Valvular degenerative calcification is characterized as a progressive reduction of orifice cross-sectional area caused by calcification of the cusps. The normal human aortic valve area (AVA) is between 3.0 and 4.0 cm² with minimal to no gradient. AS is defined as mild, moderate, severe and very severe with the corresponding AVA, mean gradients and peak jet velocities as shown (Table 28-1). In the presence of normal cardiac output, transvalvular gradient is usually greater than 50 mm Hg when the AVA is less than 1.0 cm². A rapid increase in transvalvular gradient is seen with AVAs between 0.7 and 1.0 cm². However, discordant echocardiographic parameters are not uncommon. Minners et al⁴ examined 3483 echocardiographic studies with severe AVA, 25% had

less-than-severe mean gradient and 30% has less-than-severe peak velocities leaving only 40% of patients with all echocardiographic criteria consistent with severe AS. Thus, echocardiographic data require careful assessment of images and correlation with hemodynamic parameters such as preload and afterload conditions.

Hemodynamic obstruction to flow created by the reduced orifice area of the aortic valve elevates intracavitary pressures. The resultant wall stress and ischemia-induced myocardial fibrosis leads to compensatory concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) to normalize wall tension and to maintain cardiac output. With progressive LVH, ventricular compliance decreases and end-diastolic pressure rises. The contribution of atrial contraction to preload becomes more significant and loss of sinus rhythm to atrial fibrillation may lead to rapid progression of symptoms.

### SYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS

As AS progresses to become hemodynamically significant, progressive LVH leads to the cardinal symptoms of AS, those being (1) angina, (2) syncope, and (3) dyspnea or congestive heart failure (CHF). The average AVA is 0.6 to 0.8 cm² at the onset of symptoms. Classic natural history studies have demonstrated that average life expectancy in patients with hemodynamically significant AS is 4 years with angina, 3 years with syncope, and 2 years with CHF. Symptom development in the context of AS is an absolute indication for surgical intervention. Excessive delay of AVR in symptomatic patients is associated with rate of sudden death of >10% per year. Once a patient is symptomatic, average survival is less than 3 years typically from ventricular arrhythmia or CHF.

### **ASYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS**

The management of asymptomatic patients with hemodynamically significant AS remains a challenge. First, such patients should be exercised to confirm whether they are in fact asymptomatic. Symptoms on exertion will be unveiled in approximately one-third of patients during exercise testing. For truly asymptomatic patients, when considering AVR, the risk of sudden death and progressive ventricular remodeling

should be weighed against the institutional surgical outcomes or the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database (STS ACSD) surgical mortality of 3.9%, if appropriate. For uncorrected AS, the average decrease in AVA is 0.12 cm² per year, while the average increase in transvalvular pressure is often 10 to 15 mm Hg per year. Overall, up to 7% of patients with asymptomatic AS experience death or

<sup>\*</sup>AVA < 0.6 cm<sup>2</sup> is considered very severe.

surgery 1 year after diagnosis which rises to 38% at 5 years. <sup>12</sup> Furthermore, freedom from death or AVR was 67% at 1 year, 56% at 2 years, and 33% at 4 years. However, the high-risk patient subset with very severe AS (jet velocity ≥ 5m/s) progressed much more rapidly with event-free survival of 64% at 1 year, 36% at 2 years, 12% at 4 years and 3% at 6 years. <sup>13</sup>

Early surgery in asymptomatic severe AS may limit and even reverse concentric myocardial injury and fibrosis. In high-volume centers, the operative mortality for isolated AVR is significantly lower than that reported mortality in the STS ACSD.<sup>10</sup> Furthermore, loss to follow up and delay from the time of symptoms to surgical referral are also of concern. For these reasons, early surgery may a reasonable strategy, particularly for young patients who are unlikely to escape the need for surgical valve replacement.

On the other hand, there is considerable variation in the rate of disease progression, there can exist a prolonged and stochastic latent period before symptoms emerge and many patients do not experience any change in gradient for several years. Sudden death is rather uncommon in the asymptomatic patient with AS and even with severe AS, the rate is less than 1% per year. Furthermore, the vast majority of patients who experience sudden death will become symptomatic in the months immediately prior. In addition, early and late outcomes were similar among patients with severe AS who underwent surgery with symptoms or without. Hus, watchful waiting with close clinical and echocardiographic follow up may also be considered for those with asymptomatic AS.

It is difficult to predict who will eventually need surgical intervention and to identify asymptomatic patient subsets that will benefit from an early surgical approach. As mentioned, asymptomatic patients with increases in high peak velocity jet are substantially more likely to need an operation. 13 Patients with very severe AS (AVA ≤ 0.75 cm<sup>2</sup> and jet velocity  $\ge 4.5$  m/s or mean gradient  $\ge 50$  mm Hg) have lower-mid-term all-cause mortality (2 ± 1% vs 32 ± 6%, p < .001) with early surgery versus conventional treatment.<sup>15</sup> Severe LVH (left ventricular mass [LVM] index  $\geq 180 \text{ g/m}^2$ ) and enlarged left atrium (≥5.0-cm diameter) are markers of longstanding AS and are associated with reduced survival post-AVR. 16 B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is released in response to increased myocardial wall stress and is a wellestablished marker of heart failure. Several groups have shown BNP to be a marker of symptomatic AS and an independent and objective predictor of outcome in patients with AS. 17-19 Further clinical studies will be needed to determine the clinical value of such echocardiographic measurements and biomarkers as triggers to guide the timing of surgical intervention.

### LOW-GRADIENT AORTIC STENOSIS

Patients with very poor ventricular function (ejection fraction < 50%) who have severely stenotic valves but nonsevere (<40 mm Hg) transvalvular gradients or jet velocity (<4 m/s) are termed low-gradient AS (LGAS). Compromised left ventricular function in these patients may be caused by afterload mismatch created by the stenotic valve or by intrinsic cardiomyopathy, or both, particularly in the setting of chronic ischemia from diffuse coronary disease. In these patients, measurement of transvalvular gradient and valve area at rest and with positive inotropy (eg, dobutamine stress echocardiography) may distinguish cardiomyopathy versus true valvular stenosis as the most responsible diagnosis. Those patients with contractile reserve that experience an increase in valve gradient (≥40 mm Hg) or jet velocity (≥4 m/s) with dobutamine inotropy are considered to have *true LGAS*. An increase in augmented flow resulting in only a mild increase in transvalvular gradient but an increase in valve area by ≥0.2 cm<sup>2</sup> suggests pseudosevere LGAS. The lack of increase in gradient nor AVA with dobutamine suggests pseudosevere LGAS lacking contractile reserve. Severe diastolic dysfunction with EF  $\geq$ 50% and indexed AVA  $\leq$  0.6 cm<sup>2</sup> but mean gradient < 40 mm Hg, jet velocity < 4 m/s and indexed stroke volume < 30 cc/m<sup>2</sup> is termed *paradoxical LGAS*. The latter is associated with pronounced left ventricular concentric remodeling,

moderate-to-severe diastolic dysfunction, decreased longitudinal strain and reduced stroke volume.

Patients with LGAS are a high-risk patient population with lower 5-year survival compared with those with high gradient severe AS. A retrospective study of 1154 patients with severe AS confirmed higher operative mortalities with LGAS (6.3%) and paradoxical LGAS (6.3%) compared with normal flow severe AS (1.8%).<sup>20</sup> However, such patients experience a significant survival benefit from valve replacement compared with medical management alone (Fig. 28-2).<sup>21</sup> Tribouilloy et al<sup>22</sup> report a high operative mortality (22%) but in survivors, an improved propensity-matched 5-year survival with AVR (65  $\pm$  11% vs 11  $\pm$  7%, p = .019). Thus, patients with LGAS should be carefully selected but can benefit from surgical AVR.

### MEDICAL THERAPY

Medical therapy for afterload reduction may be beneficial in AS but there is no known medical therapy that has been shown to alter its natural history. Hypertension is associated with greater cardiovascular events and improved survival, and thus medical treatment for hypertension is reasonable. <sup>23</sup> Afterload reduction may be considered for patient with AS in heart failure but should be initiated and titrated cautiously as a sudden decrease in systemic vascular resistance can result in an acute reduction in cardiac output. <sup>24</sup> With regard to targeted therapy, three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) did not show a benefit of statins in did not halting or lowering the rate of disease progression in AS. <sup>25-27</sup> The importance of osteogenic processes as key mechanisms in AS has suggested potential targets for therapy but these studies are still very much in the experimental stages. <sup>28</sup>

### INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY

In 2014, a joint task force of the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) developed evidence-based consensus guidelines for management

of patients with valvular heart disease.<sup>29</sup> These guidelines encompass several important overarching changes since the 2006AHA/ACC guidelines and the 2008 updates:<sup>30,31</sup>

- 1. Regarding AS and aortic regurgitation (AR), the revised guidelines include a new classification of heart valve diseases based on valve anatomy, valve hemodynamics, hemodynamic consequences, and symptoms. There are four stages with treatment recommendations for each stage: (A) at risk; (B) progressive asymptomatic; (C) severe asymptomatic (C1, with ventricular compensation; C2, with ventricular decompensation); and (D) severe symptomatic.
- 2. Symptomatic severe AS is subdivided into high gradient  $(V_{max} \ge 4 \text{ m/s} \text{ or mean gradient} \ge 40 \text{ mm Hg})$ , LGAS with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (severe leaflet calcification with severely reduced motion, effective orifice area [EOA]  $\le 1.0 \text{ cm}^2$ , and  $V_{max} < 4 \text{ m/s} \text{ or gradient} < 40 \text{ mm Hg with LVEF} < 50\%$ , and EOA remaining  $\le 1.0 \text{ cm}^2$ , but  $V_{max} \ge 4 \text{ m/s}$  at any flow rate during dobutamine echocardiography), and paradoxical LGAS with normal LVEF (severe leaflet calcification with severely reduced motion, EOA  $\le 1.0 \text{ cm}^2$  and  $V_{max} < 4 \text{ m/s} \text{ or gradient} < 40 \text{ mm Hg with LVEF} \ge 50\%$ ).
- 3. A focus on the Heart Team approach for clinical decision-making, particularly given the availability of surgical and transcatheter interventions.
- 4. An integrative approach to the procedural risk, which incorporates risk scoring, frailty, major organ system dysfunction and procedural impediments.

The specific recommendations for AVR for patients with AS are shown (Table 28-2 and Fig. 28-3).<sup>29</sup> To summarize, AVR should be performed in all symptomatic patients with

severe AS or in patients with severe asymptomatic AS who require concomitant cardiac surgery or with left ventricular dysfunction (LVD; LVEF < 50%). It is reasonable to perform AVR in patients with moderate AS requiring concomitant cardiac surgery. AVR is reasonable in otherwise asymptomatic patients with very severe AS (valve area <  $0.6~\rm cm^2$  and jet velocities  $\geq 5~\rm m/s$ ), severe AS and exercise-induced symptoms, and in those with true or paradoxical LGAS. Asymptomatic patients with severe AS with rapid progression may be considered for valve replacement prior to significant ventricular decompensation or sudden death.

### **Aortic Regurgitation**

### **ACUTE AORTIC REGURGITATION**

Acute AR is caused by (1) acute dilatation of the aortic annulus or sinotubular junction or both, preventing adequate cusp coaptation or by (2) disruption of the valve cusps themselves. The specific causes of AR include aortic dissection, infective endocarditis, trauma, aortic cusp prolapse secondary to VSD, aortitis or arteritis (eg, syphilitic, giant cell, Takayasu) and iatrogenesis (eg, postaortic balloon valvotomy).

The heart is relatively intolerant to acute AR, as the left ventricle is unable to compensate for the sudden increase in end-diastolic volume caused by a large regurgitant volume load. A dramatic reduction in forward stroke volume ensues. In the context of a hypertrophic and poorly compliant left ventricle, hemodynamic decompensation is significantly more dramatic. Tachycardia is the initial compensatory response to acute decline in forward stroke volume. Progressive volume overload causes the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure to acutely rise above left atrial pressure resulting in early closure

of the mitral valve.<sup>32</sup> Although this protects the pulmonary venous circulation from excessively high end-diastolic pressures, rapid progression of pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock is unavoidable. Death secondary to progressive cardiogenic shock and malignant ventricular arrhythmias are the commonest endpoints of acute AR regardless of etiology. Thus urgent surgical treatment is warranted for all causes of hemodynamically significant acute AR.

### CHRONIC AORTIC REGURGITATION

Chronic AR is caused by either slow enlargement of the aortic root or dysfunction of the valve cusps. Common causes of chronic AR include congenital abnormalities (eg, bicuspid, unicuspid, quadricuspid aortic valve), calcific cusp degeneration, rheumatic fever, endocarditis, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, myxomatous proliferation, osteogenesis imperfect and ankylosing spondylitis. The echocardiographic and catheter-based parameters for AR are shown (Table 28-3).

Chronic AR causes a persistent volume overload of the left ventricle. Initially, the ratio of wall thickness to chamber diameter, ejection fraction, and fractional shortening are maintained.<sup>33</sup> However, this volume burden eventually leads to progressive chamber enlargement without increasing

end-diastolic pressure during the asymptomatic phase of the disease. Chamber enlargement is accompanied by adaptive eccentric hypertrophy, associated at the cellular level with sarcomere replication and elongation of myocytes. The combination of chamber dilatation and hypertrophy leads to a massive increase in left ventricular mass. A vicious cycle of chamber enlargement, continually increasing wall stress and maladaptive ventricular hypertrophy ensues. Development of interstitial fibrosis is an important pathogenic mechanism that limits further ventricular dilation elevating end-diastolic pressure and leading to left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and CHF.34 Natural history studies of AR show that symptoms, LVD, or both develop in <6% of patients per year.<sup>35</sup> Progression to LVD without symptoms occurs in <4% of patients per year and sudden death occurs in <0.2% per year.<sup>36</sup> Independent predictors of progression to symptoms, LVD, or death in asymptomatic patients include age, left ventricular end-systolic dimension, rate of change in end-systolic dimension, and resting ejection fraction.<sup>37</sup> Once LVD develops, the onset of symptoms occur at a rate exceeding 25% per year.<sup>38</sup>

The decision to operate on patients with AR and LVD is indeed challenging since the outcomes are poor with surgery and with medical therapy. Patients with more severe LVD have decreased perioperative and late survival due to irreversible ventricular remodeling including hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis. <sup>39,40</sup> Vasodilator therapy may delay progression of ventricular dysfunction by decreasing afterload thus reducing regurgitant flow. This is currently indicated in asymptomatic patients with hypertension; asymptomatic patients with severe AR, ventricular dilatation, and preserved systolic function; and for short-term hemodynamic tailoring prior to operation. This therapy is not recommended in patients with severe AR and LVD, as it does not improve survival but may be considered if such patients are considered inoperable.

### INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

A summary of the 2014 ACC/AHA Guidelines for AVR for chronic AR is presented in Table 28-4 and Fig. 28-4.<sup>29</sup> Symptomatic patients experience > 10% mortality per year thus

surgery is absolutely indicated.<sup>39</sup> Since symptoms, such as angina and dyspnea, develop only after significant ventricular decompensation has occurred, surgery is advocated prior to the symptomatic phase of the disease. Surgical intervention for asymptomatic patients is based on the identification of subtle but measurable changes in myocardial function before they become irreversible and negatively affect the patient's long-term prognosis.

## CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY AND AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT

Many patients requiring AVR have coexistent coronary artery disease (CAD). In North America, more than one-third of AVR procedures are accompanied with coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Risk assessment for ischemic heart disease is complicated in patients with aortic valve disease since angina may be related to true ischemia from hemodynamically significant coronary lesions, or other causes such as left ventricular wall stress with subendocardial ischemia or chamber enlargement in the setting of reduced coronary flow reserve, or both.

According to the 2014 ACC/AHA Guidelines, during preoperative planning for AVR, coronary catheterization should be performed for the presence of angina, ischemia, LVD, or history of CAD; males > 40 years old; and postmenopausal women (Class I, Level of Evidence C). CT coronary angiography may be performed with low or intermediate pretest probability of CAD (Class IIa, Level of Evidence B).<sup>29</sup>

### Technique of Operation

### MYOCARDIAL PROTECTION AND CARDIOPUL-MONARY BYPASS

Isolated AVR is performed using a single, two-stage right atrial venous cannula and an arterial cannula into the ascending aorta for systemic perfusion of oxygenated blood.

(Reproduced with permission from Nishimura RA, Otto CM, Bonow RO, et al. 2014 AHA/ACC guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines, *J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg.* 2014 Jul;148(1):e1-e132.)

into the left ventricle to ensure a bloodless field and to prevent ventricular distention with aortic insufficiency. Alternatively, a vent may be placed into the pulmonary artery or directly in the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) via the aortotomy. Once cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is initiated, careful dissection of the pulmonary artery from the aorta ensures that the cross-clamp will be fully occlusive on the aorta and prevents inadvertent opening of the pulmonary artery with the aortotomy incision. Care is needed to prevent pulmonary artery injury, as this tissue is substantially more friable than the aorta.

After the cross-clamp is applied, myocardial protection is initially delivered as a single dose of high potassium blood through the ascending aorta. This will trigger prompt diastolic arrest unless there is moderate-to-severe AR in which arrest can be achieved with direct ostial or retrograde cardioplegia. Myocardial protection is maintained by continuous infusion of cold or tepid oxygenated blood cardioplegia delivered via direct cannulation of both coronary ostia after the aorta has been opened. The angiogram should be examined to rule out a short left main coronary artery, in which case, direct ostial antegrade cannulation may preferentially perfuse either the LAD or circumflex system. In the presence

of severe CAD, antegrade cardioplegia may not perfuse myocardial segments distal to significant coronary obstruction. Furthermore, direct cannulation of left main coronary artery risks endothelial injury and potential dissection or promotion of atherosclerosis development.

An alternative method of cardioprotection in aortic valve cases is retrograde cardioplegia, in either intermittent or continuous forms and utilized in isolation or in combination with antegrade cardioplegia. This is helpful in patients with significant AR or severe concomitant coronary disease. However, there are some questions regarding the quality of right ventricular perfusion using retrograde alone. If a retrograde cannula cannot be guided into the coronary sinus, conversion to bicaval cannulation will allow opening the right atrium and direct placement of the cannula into the coronary sinus. Do not place the retrograde cannula beyond the origin of the right coronary vein ostium in the coronary sinus to ensure adequate right ventricular myocardial protection.

Right ventricular myocardial protection can be a challenge for a small nondominant right coronary artery (RCA) that will not accept a direct ostial cannula. One solution is to drift the patient's temperature to 28°C with cold topical slush and frequent retrograde cardioplegia.

## AORTOTOMY, VALVE EXCISION, AND DEBRIDEMENT

Once the cross-clamp has been applied and cardioplegic arrest has been achieved, the aorta is opened either with a transverse or oblique aortotomy. The low transverse aortotomy is a common approach to the aortic valve when using stented bioprostheses or mechanical valves. The aortotomy is started approximately 10 to 15 mm above the origin of the RCA and extended anteriorly and posteriorly. The initial transverse incision over the RCA may also be extended obliquely in the posterior direction into the noncoronary sinus or the commissure between the left and noncoronary cusps (Fig. 28-5). The oblique incision is often used in patients with small aortic roots, in whom root enlargement procedures may be required.

Morphology of the valve is then inspected (Fig. 28-6). The valve cusps are incised with scissors at the right cusp between the right coronary ostium and the commissure between the right and noncoronary cusps using Mayo scissors or special right-angled valve scissors (Fig. 28-7). One to two millimeters of tissue is left behind to support a sewing surface. Right cusp excision is carried first toward the left coronary cusp and then toward the noncoronary cusp and the cusp is removed as a single piece if possible. A moistened radiopaque sponge may be placed into the outflow area to catch calcific debris, which must be removed before placing the valve sutures. Thorough decalcification is then performed with a scalpel or rongeur. Debridement of all calcium deposits back to soft tissue improves seating of the prosthesis and decreases the incidence of paravalvular leak and dehiscence.

Care must be taken to prevent aortic perforation while calcific deposits are debrided from the aortic wall, particularly at the commissure between the left and noncoronary cusps,

where perforation is most likely. Several anatomic relationships must be respected during valve excision (Fig. 28-8). The bundle of His (conduction system) is located below the junction of the right and noncoronary cusps in the membranous septum. Deep debridement in this area can result in permanent heart block. The anterior leaflet of the mitral valve is in direct continuity with the left aortic valve cusp. If it is damaged during decalcification, an autologous pericardial patch can be used to repair the defect.

Once debridement is completed, the aortic root is copiously flushed with saline while the left ventricular vent is stopped. To prevent pushing debris into the left ventricle, saline in a bulb syringe is flushed through the left ventricular vent and out the aortic valve in an antegrade manner instead of retrograde through the valve. The irrigation solution is suctioned with the external wall suction and not into the cardiotomy suction.

**FIGURE 28-8** Anatomic relationships of the aortic valve.

### VALVE IMPLANTATION

The annulus is sized with a valve-sizer designed for the selected prosthetic device. The valve is secured to the annulus using 12 to 16 double-needled interrupted 2-0 synthetic braided pledgeted sutures that are alternating in color. The pledgets can be left on the inflow/ventricular side or the outflow/aortic side of the aortic annulus (Figs. 28-9 and 28-10). Placing the pledgets on the inside of the annulus allows supra-annular placement of the valve and generally will allow implantation of as slightly larger prosthesis. If the coronary ostia are close to the annulus, supra-annular placement may only be possible along the noncoronary cusp. Mattress sutures are first placed in the three commissures and retracted to assist visualization. Some surgeons will place the commissural suture between the right and noncoronary cusps from the outside of the aorta (ie, the pledget is left on the outside of the aorta) to prevent injury to the conduction system. Pledgeted mattress sutures are then placed in a clockwise fashion typically starting in the noncoronary cusp. Sutures may be placed into the sewing ring of the prosthetic valve with each annular suture or after all annular sutures are placed. The sutures for each of the three cusps are held separately with three hemostats and retracted while the prosthesis is slid into the annulus. Sutures are then tied down in a balanced fashion alternating among the three cusps.

### **AORTIC CLOSURE AND DE-AIRING**

The aorta is closed with a double row of synthetic 4-0 polypropylene sutures. The first suture line is started on the right side at the posterior end of the aortotomy and the double-needled suture is secured slightly beyond the incision to ensure there is no leak in this region. One end of the suture is run

as a horizontal mattress anteriorly to the midpoint of the aortotomy, and then the second end of the suture is run anteriorly, slightly superficial to the horizontal mattress suture, in an over-and-over manner. On the left side, a similar technique is

![](_page_8_Picture_9.jpeg)

FIGURE 28-9 Placement of sutures with pledgets below the annulus.

FIGURE 28-10 Placement of sutures with pledgets above the annulus.

performed, the aorta is de-aired, and the two sutures are tied to themselves and to each other at the aortotomy midpoint.

During AVR, air is entrained into the left atrium and ventricle, and aorta. This must be removed to prevent catastrophic air embolization. Immediately prior to tying the suture of the aortotomy, the heart is allowed to fill, the vent in the superior pulmonary vein is stopped, the lungs are inflated, and the crossclamp is briefly partially opened. The influx of blood should expel most air from these cavities out of the partially open aortotomy. Closure of the aortotomy is then completed and the cross-clamp is fully removed. The cardioplegia cannula in the ascending aorta and the left ventricular vent are then placed on suction to remove any residual air as the heart begins electrical activity. A small needle (21-gauge) can be used to aspirate the apex of the left ventricle and the dome of the left atrium. To prevent air entrainment, the left ventricular vent must be removed while the pericardium is filled with saline irrigation. De-airing maneuvers are verified with visualization using transesophageal echocardiography. Vigorous shaking and careful manual compression of the heart while suctioning through the aortic vent (ie, cardioplegia tack) is helpful to remove air trapped within trabeculations. Once de-airing is complete, the aortic vent is removed. The patient is then weaned from CPB and decannulated in the standard fashion. If patients are pacemaker dependent when weaned from CPB in the operating room, it is recommended to insert atrial pacing wires to allow for synchronous atrioventricular pacing.

## CONCOMITANT CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFTING

Operative technique is modified when there is concomitant CAD to optimize myocardial protection. Distal anastomoses

are performed prior to AVR so that antegrade cardioplegiamay be administered through these grafts during the operation. The left internal mammary artery should be used for revascularization of the left anterior descending artery. This anastomosis is performed after the aortotomy is closed to ensure that the coronary circulation is not exposed to systemic circulation during cardioplegic arrest and to prevent trauma to the anastomosis during manipulation of the heart.

The 2014 ACC/AHA Guidelines recommend concomitant surgical revascularization for coronary stenosis ≥ 70% or left main stenosis ≥ 50% (Class IIa, Level of Evidence C).<sup>29</sup> The benefit of revascularization should be balanced with the increased operative mortality, which increases from 3.9 to 5.9% for combined CABG/AVR according to the STS ACSD.<sup>10</sup> Concomitant CABG at the time of AVR is common as reported rates were 30% in patients 51 to 60 years of age, 41% in 61 to 70 years of age and 50% in >71 years of age.<sup>41</sup>

## CONCOMITANT ASCENDING AORTIC REPLACEMENT

The threshold for concomitant replacement of the ascending aorta at the time of AVR is an area of debate. Borger et al,<sup>42</sup> reviewed patients with bicuspid aortic valve undergoing AVR and report 15-year freedom from aorta-related complications was 86, 81, and 43% in patients with an aortic diameter of <4.0 cm, 4.0 to 4.4 cm, and 4.5 to 4.9 cm, respectively (Fig. 28-11). Extrapolating from these data and others to all patients with concomitant ascending aortic dilation, the current 2014 ACC/AHA Guidelines recommend aorta replacement when maximal diameter exceeds 4.5 cm for patients undergoing aortic valve surgery (Class IIa, Level of Evidence C).<sup>29</sup> In patients with Marfan or Loeys-Dietz Syndromes, the aortopathy is much more aggressive and a lower trigger point for replacement may be appropriate. Given the lack of data, there are currently no recommendations for concomitant

![](_page_9_Figure_12.jpeg)

**FIGURE 28-11** Freedom from ascending aortic complications for patients with a bicuspid aortic valve with an ascending aortic diameter of <4 cm, 4.0 to 4.5 cm, and 4.5 to 4.9 cm at the time of aortic valve replacement.

replacement of ascending aorta when replacing a tricuspid aortic valve. Clearly the threshold should be between 4.5 and 5.5 cm. The decision is left to the surgeon and should be based on the additive risk of the procedure, patient's age, comorbidities, and overall life expectancy.

### **AORTIC ROOT ENLARGEMENT PROCEDURES**

Detailed descriptions of aortic root enlargement procedures are presented in a later chapter. Briefly, either an anterior or posterior annular enlargement procedure may be performed in a patient with a small aortic root to allow for implantation of a larger valve. The posterior approach is the most commonly used aortic root enlargement procedure in adults and can increase the annular diameter by 2 to 4 mm. Nicks and colleagues in 1970 described a technique of root enlargement in which the aortotomy is extended downward through the noncoronary cusp, through the aortic annulus to the anterior mitral leaflet with patch augmentation.<sup>43</sup> In 1979, Manouguian and Seybold-Epting described a procedure extending the aortotomy incision in a downward direction through the commissure between the left and noncoronary cusps into the interleaflet triangle and into the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve with patch augmentation.44 The anterior approach is generally used in the pediatric population. Described by Konno and colleagues in 1975, this technique, which is also known as aortoventriculoplasty, is used when more than 4 mm of annular enlargement is required.<sup>45</sup> Instead of a transverse incision, a longitudinal incision is made in the anterior aorta and extended to the right coronary sinus of Valsalva and then through the anterior wall of the right ventricle to open the right ventricular outflow tract. The ventricular septum is incised, allowing significant expansion of the aortic annulus and left ventricular outflow tract.

### REOPERATIVE AORTIC VALVE SURGERY

Reoperative AVR may be performed for prosthetic valverelated complications or commonly for progressive AS post-CABG. Prosthetic valve-related causes include structural valve deterioration, prosthetic endocarditis, prosthesis thrombosis, or paravalvular leak. Chest reentry is the most hazardous portion of any repeat cardiac procedure. The proximity of cardiac structures to the posterior sternum must be assessed prior to redo sternotomy. This can be accomplished by lateral chest x-ray (CXR), computed tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Before making an incision, there should be blood transfusion units in the room, external defibrillator pads on the patient and the CPB pump should be primed. Femoral or axillary vessels may be exposed or CPB may be instituted through the peripheral vessels in the case of high-risk chest reentry. An oscillating saw is used to open the sternum and as little tissue as possible is dissected. Extreme caution must be employed during dissection when there are patent bypass grafts that cross the midline.

Once cardioplegic arrest is established, the old prosthesis is excised with sharp dissection. Care must be taken to count and remove all sutures and pledgets from the annulus.

Annular injuries caused while excising the prosthesis are repaired with pledgeted interrupted sutures or with a patch, typically of treated bovine pericardium. Removal of stentless prostheses may be particularly difficult. In the setting of endocarditis, aggressive debridement of all infected tissue must be performed with annular and aortic root reconstruction with pericardium when root abscesses are present. Any foreign material can be seeded with bacteria, including Dacron aortic grafts, must be excised in the presence of active endocarditis as grafts can be seeded with bacteria.

In the presence of a Dacron prosthesis in the ascending aorta, chest reentry may be extremely hazardous since exsanguination will occur if the graft is inadvertently opened during dissection. To limit the systemic consequences of exsanguination at normothermia, the patient may be placed on femoro-femoral CPB and cooled to 18 to 20°C prior to chest reentry. If the Dacron graft is accidentally opened, local control of the bleeding is established and CPB is stopped. Under circulatory arrest, the graft is repaired or replaced. CPB may then be restarted. In all repeat aortic procedures, rigorous myocardial protection must be applied since these procedures often have very long ischemic times. Antegrade cold blood cardioplegia is usually employed in a continuous fashion throughout the case by selective cannulation of the coronary ostia. Retrograde cardioplegia may have benefit in the setting of patent old saphenous vein grafts.<sup>47</sup> More and more patients with previous cardiac surgery that require highrisk reoperative AVR are increasingly being referred to Heart Teams for consideration of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).

### PORCELAIN AORTA

Porcelain aorta is the most severe form of aortic atherosclerosis. The major risk of manipulation of a calcified aorta is atheroemboli with stroke being the most common clinical sequelae.<sup>36</sup> Calcified or porcelain aorta is found in approximately 1 to 2% of cases and can be diagnosed based on preoperative imaging or intraoperative assessment. A history of risk factors such as smoking, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, hypertension, or stroke as well as imaging demonstrating ostial coronary disease, peripheral vascular disease or carotid disease should trigger a high index of suspicion for aortic atheroma. Preoperative imaging to demonstrate aortic calcification includes CXR, transthoracic echocardiogram, angiogram, CT, or MRI. Intraoperative assessment includes direct palpation, transesophageal echocardiography and epiaortic ultrasound. Of these, epiaortic ultrasound is the most sensitive modality to detect aortic calcification, particularly for soft, nonechogenic, and nonpalpable plaque components.<sup>37</sup>

The key strategic decisions are (1) central versus peripheral cannulation, (2) cross-clamp versus circulatory arrest, and (3) isolated AVR versus AVR and RAA. Gillinov et al<sup>48</sup> reported a series of patients with severe aortic calcification and AS treated with endarterectomy, replacement of ascending aorta, cross-clamp during DHCA and balloon occlusion of aorta via aortotomy with Foley catheter. Cannulation sites were aorta (34%), femoral artery (34%), axillary artery (24%), and

innominate artery (8%), and all patients underwent circulatory arrest. More recently, TAVR has changed the landscape, offering an alternative to surgical valve replacement in this high-risk patient subset. In fact, porcelain aorta is the primary indication in approximately 10 to 15% of patients that undergo TAVR.  $^{\rm 49}$ 

### POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

Special consideration must be given to the underlying pathologic changes to the ventricle during the immediate postoperative period. The severely hypertrophied, noncompliant left ventricle resulting from AS is highly dependent on sufficient preload for adequate filling. Filling pressures should be carefully titrated between 15 and 18 mm Hg with intravenous volume infusion. Subvalvular left ventricular outflow obstruction with systolic anterior wall motion of the mitral valve should be avoided. Intravenous beta-adrenergic blockade may relieve this obstruction by decreasing inotropy and chronotropy. In extreme cases reoperation and surgical myectomy may be required.

Maintenance of sinus rhythm is also essential since up to one-third of cardiac output is derived from atrial contraction in a noncompliant ventricle. Up to 10% of patients will experience low cardiac output syndrome in the immediate postoperative period. If pacing is required postoperatively, synchronous atrioventricular pacing is beneficial in preventing low cardiac output syndrome.

Complete heart block occurs in 3 to 5% of AVR patients. This complication may be due to suture placement or injury from debridement near the conduction system at highest risk inferior to the right-non commissure. Transient complete heart block caused by perioperative edema usually resolves in 4 to 6 days. After this time, insertion of a permanent pacemaker is recommended if there is no resolution.

Profound peripheral vasodilation, often seen in patients with aortic insufficiency, is treated with vasoconstrictors including alpha-adrenergic agonists or vasopressin. Adequate filling of the dilated left ventricle may also require volume infusion.

## STENTED BIOPROSTHETIC AORTIC VALVEREPLACEMENT DEVICES

Stented bioprostheses may be constructed with porcine aortic valves or bovine pericardium. Over the past 40 years, advances in tissue fixation methodology and various proprietary chemical treatments have been developed to prevent extracellular matrix and calcium deposition. All heterograft valves are preserved with glutaraldehyde, which acts by cross-linking collagen fibers to reduce tissue antigenicity. Glutaraldehyde also ameliorates in vivo enzymatic degradation and causes the loss of cell viability, thereby preventing extracellular matrix turnover. Glutaraldehyde fixation of porcine valves can be performed at high pressure (60 to 80 mm Hg), low pressure (0.1 to 2 mm Hg), or zero pressure (0 mm Hg). Porcine prostheses

fixed at zero pressure retain the collagen architecture of the relaxed aortic valve cusp.<sup>51</sup> Pericardial prostheses are fixed in low- or zero-pressure conditions.

When comparing bioprostheses, it is important to be aware of lack of standardization in methodologies for labeling valve sizes by the different manufacturers. In general, label sizes refer to either the internal or the external diameter of the stent, not the external diameter of the sewing cuff or the maximal opening diameter of the valve leaflets. Thus, the same aortic annulus will likely fit different-sized valves from different manufacturers, depending on the convention they use and the size of their sewing cuff.

### **Earlier-generation Prostheses**

First-generation bioprostheses were preserved with high-pressure fixation and were placed in the annular position. Second-generation prostheses are treated with low- or zero-pressure fixation. Several second-generation prostheses may also be placed in the supra-annular position, which allows placement of a slightly larger prosthesis. The Medtronic Hancock II Ultra is a porcine bioprosthesis (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN; Fig. 28-12) and the Carpentier-Edwards Perimount (Edwards Life Sciences LLC, Irvine, CA; Fig. 28-13) is a pericardial bioprosthesis. Despite the introduction of newergeneration prostheses, some surgeons prefer implantation of Hancock II Ultra and Perimount valves because of the established long-term clinical follow up and performance of these valves. 52-56

### Third-generation Prostheses

Newer-generation prostheses incorporate zero- or lowpressure fixation with anti-mineralization processes that are designed to reduce material fatigue and calcification. Stents have become progressively thinner allowing a lower profile. Porcine valves have a lower stent post and base profile to minimize protrusion into the aortic wall and facilitate

coronary clearance (Medtronic Mosaic Ultra; Fig. 28-14). For this reason, they are particularly favorable for tissue mitral valve replacement as the stents occupy less space in the left ventricle.

The third-generation bovine bioprostheses include the Carpentier-Edwards Magna Ease (Edwards Life Sciences LLC; Fig. 28-15), Mitroflow (Sorin, Fig. 28-16), and Trifeca (St. Jude, St. Paul, MN; Fig. 28-17). The Magna Ease is the evolution of the Perimount pericardial valve, with a narrower sewing cuff and scalloped sign for supra-annular placement. The Mitroflow Pericardial aortic prosthesis and the Trifecta are pericardial valves with the pericardium placed around the exterior of the stent, allowing for a larger opening diameter and optimal flow characteristics.

Head-to-head comparisons have been performed and despite small but significant differences in hemodynamic parameters, no valve has demonstrated improved survival nor left ventricular remodeling over another. Thalji et al<sup>57</sup>

performed a RCT in 241 patients with AS to receive the largest possible St. Jude Epic, Edwards Magna and Sorin Mitroflow valve. There was small but significant hemodynamic advantage for the Magna valve with respect to indexed EOA (0.93  $\pm$  0.28, 1.04  $\pm$  0.28, and 0.96  $\pm$  0.26 cm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>, p = .015 for Epic, Magna, and Mitroflow, respectively) and mean gradient  $(15.2 \pm 5.5, 12.3 \pm 4.3, \text{ and } 16.2 \pm 5.7 \text{ mm Hg}, p < .001),$ primarily driven by valve sizes 23 mm and greater. However, short-term clinical outcomes and LVM regression was not different. Whether meaningful long-term clinical differences will emerge between these third-generation valves remain an open question. A retrospective comparison of Trifecta, Edwards Magna, and Magna Ease valves also found that valve type was not an independent predictor of valve area nor mean gradient overall.<sup>58</sup> However, for the subset of patients with small aortic roots, a 19-mm Trifecta and Mitroflow offer excellent hemodynamic properties in vivo and may be considered.<sup>58,59</sup> Dumesnil et al<sup>60</sup> reviewed hemodynamic properties of a range of stented bioprostheses and find comparable orifice areas with most currently available prostheses (Table 28-5).

## OUTCOMES OF AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT

### **Operative Mortality**

Operative mortality is defined as all-cause mortality within 30 days of operation or during the same hospital admission. In 1999, the STS ACSD reviewed the results of 86,580 valve procedures to find an overall mortality of 4.3% for isolated AVR, and 8.0% for AVR with CABG.61 Then in 2009, they again reviewed 67,292 cases of AVR between 2002 and 2006, and found an improved mortality of 3.2% for isolated AVR, and 5.6% for AVR with CABG (Table 28-6). 62 Recently, Thourani et al 63 reviewed 141,905 cases of AVR in the STS ACSD between 2002 and 2010 to show lower observed mortality rates than the STS predicted risk of mortality (PROM) in low- (1.4 vs 1.7%), medium- (5.1 vs 5.5%), and high-risk (11.8 vs 13.7%) patients groups (p < .0001). They further demonstrate a slight increase in overall operative mortality in the current surgical era (2007 to 2010) compared to previous (2002 to 2006; 2.7 vs 2.5%, p = .018) despite a significant increase

in overall STS PROM (3.05  $\pm$  3.73% vs 2.82  $\pm$  3.69%, p < .0001). This was attributed to lower mortality in both the moderate (5.4 vs 6.4%, p = .002) and high-risk (11.9 vs 14.4%, p = .0004) patient cohorts. It is important to note that information in this database is voluntarily submitted and includes both low-volume and high-volume centers.

### Long-term Survival

There have been three major long-term RCTs comparing survival between patients receiving mechanical and bioprosthetic valves.  $^{64-67}$  The 12-year results from the Edinburgh Heart Trial improved survival free from reoperation and a trend toward improved overall survival with the Bjork-Shiley mechanical prosthesis.  $^{64}$  The 20-year results found no survival advantage with mechanical valves.  $^{65}$  In the Veterans Affairs Trial, all-cause mortality after AVR was lower with the mechanical valve versus bioprosthesis (66 vs 79%, p = .02) at 15 years.  $^{66}$  In patients  $\geq 65$  years after AVR, primary valve failure was not different between bioprosthetic and mechanical valves

 $(9 \pm 6 \text{ vs } 0\%, p = .16)$ . However, reoperation was higher for bioprosthetic AVR and bleeding was higher with mechanical valves. These landmark trials form the basis of our guidelines but the Bjork-Shiley single disc is no longer utilized and third generation pericardial bioprostheses are generally favored over porcine valves and the Hancock bioprostheses. Increased bioprosthetic structural deterioration in these early trials was likely influenced by the use of first-generation prostheses that are more prone to structural failure than newer generation prostheses. A more recent study of 310 patients between 55 and 70 years old randomized to either tissue or mechanical AVR showed no difference in mortality but more SVD and higher reoperation with bioprosthetic valves after 10 years (Fig. 28-18).<sup>67</sup> Importantly, higher bleeding events with mechanical prostheses in the VA and Edinburgh studies were not seen in the recent trial, possibly due to a lower target international normalized ratio (2-2.5).

There are several nonrandomized long-term clinical follow-up series of early generation and contemporary bioprostheses. Brennan et al $^{10}$  report long-term outcomes on 145,911 patients  $\geq$  65 years in the STS database undergoing AVR and AVR/CABG from 1991 to 2007 (Fig. 28-19). The

median survival in patients 65 to 69, 70 to 79, and ≥80 years of age undergoing AVR was 13, 9, and 6 years, respectively (Table 28-7). Figure 28-20 shows long-term morality stratified by STS perioperative risk of mortality. Although only 5% of isolated AVR patients had a high STS perioperative risk of mortality (≥10%), their median survival was 2.5 to 2.7 years. Importantly, severe lung disease and renal failure were each associated with a ≥50% reduction in median survival. LVD and prior cardiac operation were associated with a 25% reduction in median survival. ¹¹0 The comorbidities of age, concomitant CAD, LVD, and poor functional status on middle-to-late survival after bioprosthetic AVR are additive. Other risk factors for late mortality include concomitant renal disease, female gender, concomitant cardiac or vascular procedure, and atrial fibrillation.

### Valve-related Mortality

A committee of the American Association for Thoracic Surgery (AATS), STS, and European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) has standardized prosthetic valve surgery outcomes. Valve-related mortality is defined as all deaths caused by structural valve deterioration, nonstructural

valve dysfunction, valve thrombosis, embolism, bleeding event, operated valvular endocarditis, or death related to reoperation of an operated valve.<sup>68</sup> Sudden, unexplained, unexpected deaths of patients with an operated valve are included as valve-related mortality. Deaths caused by progressive heart failure in patients with satisfactorily functioning cardiac valves are not included. In the Hammermeister series, valve-related deaths accounted for 37% of all deaths in patients with mechanical valves and 41% of all deaths in patients with bioprostheses at 15 years.<sup>64</sup> Nonvalvular cardiac deaths accounted for 17 and 21% of deaths at 15 years in patients with mechanical and bioprostheses, respectively.

### NONFATAL VALVE EVENTS

The joint AATS/STS/EACTS committee also defined specific guidelines for reporting outcomes on structural and nonstructural valve deterioration, valve thrombosis, embolic events, bleeding events, and prosthetic endocarditis. Structural valve deterioration refers to any change in function of an operated valve resulting from an intrinsic abnormality of the valve that causes stenosis or regurgitation (eg, leaflet tears, suture line disruption). Nonstructural dysfunction is any abnormality

of an operated valve resulting in stenosis or regurgitation that is caused by factors not intrinsic to the valve itself (eg, pannus overgrowth, inappropriate sizing, or paravalvular leak). Valve thrombosis is any thrombus that interferes with valve function in the absence of infection. *Embolism* is any embolic event that occurs after the immediate postoperative period in the absence of infection. Cerebral embolic events are subclassified into transient ischemic attacks are short fully reversible neurologic events and Strokes are neurologic deficits lasting longer than >72 hours. Bleeding event is any episode of major internal or external bleeding that causes death, hospitalization, or permanent injury, or requires transfusion, regardless of the patient's anticoagulation status. This does not include embolic stroke followed by hemorrhagic transformation and intracranial bleed. Finally, operated valvular endocarditis is any infection involving an operated valve; any structural or nonstructural valvular dysfunction, thrombosis, or embolic event associated with operated valvular endocarditis.

### Structural Valve Deterioration

### STENTED BIOPROSTHESES

Several large series describe long-term follow-up of first-, second-, and now third-generation stented bioprostheses (Table 28-8). 55,69-78 These series are not directly comparable since they took place in different patient populations and in different eras; however, there are some overarching results. Long-term follow-up of second-generation stented bioprostheses, including the Medtronic Hancock II porcine and Carpentier-Edwards pericardial valves show approximately 90% freedom from structural valve deterioration at 12-year follow-up. However, beyond 15-year follow-up, freedom from SVD falls rapidly in most series. In a long-term follow up of the Hancock II valve, independent predictors of reoperation due to SVD were age (odds ratio [OR]: 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.58 to 0.90, p < .01) and prosthesis-patient mismatch (OR: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.01 to 2.63; p = .045).<sup>55</sup> In large series, freedom from reoperation is approximately 95% at 5 years, 90% at 10 years, but 70% at 15 years (Table 28-8).58-77 Notably, the freedom from SVD may be underestimated in the literature since most series report SVD by the actuarial method instead of the actual or cumulative incidence method.<sup>79</sup> Actuarial statistical analysis overestimates SVD in older patients since it assumes that patients who have died of other causes will continue to be at risk for SVD.

Younger patients are predisposed to premature bioprosthetic SVD.  $^{80,81}$  In a younger patient cohort (age < 60 years), actuarial freedom from re-AVR was 87.4, 62.6, and 52.2% at 10, 15, and 20 years postoperatively, respectively.  $^{56}$  Jamieson et al reported long-term clinical outcomes of 230 patients < 60 years old with the Carpentier-Edwards supraannular aortic valve. Freedom from SVD at 18 years after operation was 51.0% in patients aged 51 to 60 years and 31.9% in patients < 50 years. Forcillo et al report their 20-year experience in 144 patients < 60 years old (mean age 51 ± 9 years) that underwent AVR with the Edwards pericardial valves. Freedom from SVD was 84 ± 4% and 57 ± 6% at 10 and 15 years, respectively. Patients underwent reoperation for SVD at an average of 11 ± 5 years with no perioperative mortality.

### Optimal Antithrombotic Therapy

Bioprosthetic valves do not require long-term anticoagulation with warfarin unless the patient is at high risk for thromboembolism or has had a thromboembolic event with their prosthesis. Stented bioprostheses have a linearized risk for thromboembolism between 0.5 and 1% per year. This risk appears to be lower in patients with stentless heterograft, allograft, or autograft valves. Aspirin significantly decreases the risk of thromboembolism in low-risk patients with bioprostheses versus no antiplatelet therapy. Aspirin significantly is approximately the same risk of thromboembolism as fully

anticoagulated mechanical valves, with fewer bleeding complications. Interestingly, by 15 years in the Edinburgh Heart Trial, the proportion of patients with bioprosthetic AVR on warfarin was 33%, mostly for atrial fibrillation or LVD.<sup>65</sup> If a patient has identified high-risk factors for thrombosis preoperatively, a mechanical prosthesis may be considered unless the risk factor is amenable to correction since formal anticoagulation with warfarin will still be necessary.

There is an immediate increased hazard function for thromboembolism before the exposed surfaces of stented bioprostheses endothelialize. In a study from the Mayo Clinic, a 41 and 3.6% per year risk of thromboembolism was reported in the interval 0-10 days and 10-90 days following bioprosthetic AVR, respectively.86 A retrospective study of 25,656 elderly patients in the STS database report lower risk of death (relative risk [RR]: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.66 to 0.96) and embolism (RR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.35 to 0.76) but higher risk of bleeding events (RR: 2.80, 95% CI: 2.18 to 3.60) with aspirin and warfarin versus aspirin alone in the first 3 months following bioprosthetic AVR.87 This study revealed considerable variation in short-term anticoagulation strategies for patients with bioprosthetic AVR. There are two small prospective RCTs comparing formal anticoagulation vs antiplatelet alone postbioprosthetic AVR. In the TRAC Trial, 193 patients that underwent bioprosthetic aortic or mitral valve replacement received Triflusal (an antiplatelet agent similar to aspirin) or acenocoumarol (a vitamin K antagonist similar to warfarin). There was no difference in thromboembolic complications but greater bleeding events with anticoagulation (10 vs 3.1%, p = .048).88 The WoA Epic Pilot Trial randomized 69 low thrombotic risk patients undergoing bioprosthetic AVR to ASA or warfarin. There was no difference in strokes (2.9 vs

2.9%, p = .99), bleeding events (2.9 vs 8.8%, p = .36).<sup>89</sup> The current 2014 ACC/AHA Guidelines recommend anticoagulation with warfarin (INR between 2 and 3) for the first 3 months for bioprosthetic valves (Class IIa, Level of Evidence C) then low dose aspirin as well as aspirin alone (Class IIa, Level of Evidence B).<sup>29</sup> The early use of anticoagulation primarily reflects the increased risk of thromboembolic events due to the lack of endothelialization of the various prosthetic materials.

Warfarin remains the only approved oral anticoagulant for patients with prosthetic valve(s). Although nonwarfarin oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have shown improved efficacy over warfarin in large trials of venous thromboembolism and non-valvular atrial fibrillation. The RE-ALIGN phase 2 dosevalidation study comparing dabigatran versus warfarin for patients with mechanical prosthetic valves report higher stroke (5 vs 0%) and higher major bleeding (4 vs 2%) in the dabigatran group. The use of NOAC for prosthetic valve anticoagulation is thus currently a class III recommendation (will cause harm; Level of Evidence B) and should not be used. 29

### **Prosthesis Thrombosis**

Prosthesis thrombosis is a rare but potentially devastating outcome after bioprosthetic AVR. The incidence of prosthesis thrombosis is <0.2% per year and occurs more often with mechanical prostheses.<sup>94</sup> Thrombolytic therapy may be used in some patients but it is often ineffective and cannot be used in the immediate postoperative period due to excessive bleeding risk. Thrombolysis is recommended in patients with left-sided thrombosis who are experiencing mild heart failure (NYHA Class I or II) or who are in severe heart failure but are

considered too high risk for surgery.<sup>29</sup> A risk of thrombolytic therapy is cerebral or peripheral thromboembolism. Surgical treatment is recommended in severe heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV) and includes replacement of the valve or open thrombectomy, and mortality from either procedure is similar at approximately 10 to 15%. Recurrent thrombosis after de-clotting occurs in up to 40% of patients and we recommend valve replacement in virtually all patients who are managed operatively.

### **Prosthetic Valve Endocarditis**

Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) is separated into two time frames: early (<60 days postimplantation) and late (>60 days postimplantation). Early PVE is usually a sequela of perioperative bacterial seeding of the valve, either during implantation or postoperatively from wound or intravascular catheter infections. Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungal infections are common during this period.95-98 Although most cases of late PVE are caused by septicemia from noncardiac sources, a small proportion of late cases in the first year are attributable to less virulent organisms introduced in the perioperative period, particularly S. epidermidis. Organisms responsible for late PVE include Streptococcus and Staphylococcus species and other organisms commonly found in native valve infectious endocarditis. All unexplained fevers should be meticulously investigated for PVE with serial blood cultures and transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography. Transesophageal echocardiography provides more detailed anatomic information such as the presence of vegetations, abscesses, and fistulas. Transthoracic views may provide better views of the anterior portion of the valve. The annual risk of PVE in the aortic position is 0.6 to 0.9% per patient year. 95,96 The 5-year freedom from PVE is >95%.97 Mechanical valves may have a slightly higher early hazard for PVE than stented bioprostheses.98 However, no difference exists in risk between patients with mechanical and stented bioprosthetic prostheses after the early phase.

Outcome for patients with PVE is very poor. Invasive paravalvular infection occurs in up to 40% of cases of PVE.<sup>96</sup> Early PVE is associated with 30 to 80% mortality, while late PVE is associated with 20 to 40% mortality. 97 According to the 2014 ACC/AHA Guidelines, early surgeries indicated for PVE with valve dysfunction and heart failure (Class I, Level of Evidence B); paravalvular leak or partial dehiscence; presence of a new conduction defect, abscess or penetrating lesion (Class I, Level of Evidence B); persistent bacteremia and fever despite 5-7 days of appropriate antibiotic therapy (Class I, Level of Evidence B); vegetations (>10 mm); and surgery for relapsing infection (Class I, Level of Evidence C) and multiple systemic emboli with persistent vegetations (Class IIa, Level of Evidence B).<sup>29</sup> Notably, all fungal, and most virulent strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa require operation, as these organisms are highly invasive and antibiotic therapy alone is generally ineffective (Class I, Level of Evidence B).

### Paravalvular Leak and Hemolysis

Paravalvular leak is uncommon when pledgeted sutures are routinely used, outside of the setting of infective endocarditis. Technical errors may result in inappropriately large gaps between sutures, leaving a small portion of the prosthesis unattached to the annulus. If paravalvular leak is sufficient to cause significant hemolysis or heart failure from acute aortic insufficiency, surgical correction should be performed (Class I, Level of Evidence B).29 Repair can be accomplished with a few interrupted pledgeted sutures or a large defect may require valve explant, patch repair and valve reimplant. Pannus overgrowth and prosthetic structural degeneration interfering with normal valve opening and closure may also cause hemolysis severe enough to warrant reoperation. Milder cases of hemolysis may be managed conservatively by dietary supplementation with iron and folic acid, and routine measurement of hemoglobin, serum haptoglobin, and lactate dehydrogenase.

### HEMODYNAMIC PERFORMANCE AND VENTRICULAR REMODELING

### Left Ventricular Mass Regression

Pressure and volume overload caused by aortic valve disease leads to increased intracavitary left ventricular pressures and compensatory LVH. In severe AS, concentric ventricular hypertrophy occurs without increasing end-diastolic dimension until late in the disease process, thus maintaining the ventricular wall thickness:cavity radius ratio. On the other hand, severe AR causes volume overload with an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume and eccentric hypertrophy, but may not change the ratio of ventricular wall thickness to cavity radius. Both pathologies result in an increase in LVM which has a strong negative prognostic effect. 99,100 The overall goal of AVR is to alleviate the pressure and volume overload on the left ventricle, allowing myocardial remodeling and regression of LVM.

The clinical impact of LVM regression is not as well understood, despite its widespread acceptance as a measure of outcome after aortic valve surgery. In patients after AVR for isolated AS, LVM generally regresses significantly over the first 18 months and returns to normal limits. 101-102 Ventricular mass regression may continue for up to 5 years after valve replacement. 103 However, some patients never experience adequate LVM regression which can be associated with poor clinical outcome. In particular, patient-prosthesis mismatch (PPM), in which poor hemodynamic performance of a prosthesis results in poor regression of LVH, is associated with poor patient outcome.

### **Prosthesis-Patient Mismatch**

### **DEFINITIONS**

The term PPM has been applied to several different clinical situations. It has been used to describe absolute small valve size (ie, <21 mm), small valve size in a patient with a large

body surface area, excessive transvalvular gradient postimplantation, increased transvalvular gradient with exercise, indexed EOA, and various combinations of these variables. Rahimtoola<sup>104</sup> originally defined PPM as a condition that occurs when the valve area of a prosthetic valve is less than the area of that patient's normal valve. Ultimately, the valve performance cannot meet the cardiac output requirements of the patient, resulting in either no relief or worsening of symptoms due to the obstructive nature of the prosthesis, which creates a residual stenosis resulting in an elevated transvalvular gradient. To varying degrees, all valve prostheses are inherently stenotic. The presence of rigid sewing rings, and in the case of stented bioprostheses, struts to hold the valve commissures, cause obstruction to outflow and will therefore cause a residual gradient despite normal prosthesis function. Patient-prosthesis mismatch is further exacerbated by annular fibrosis, annular calcification, and LVH, as seen in AS, that cause contraction of the native annulus, leading to the implantation of a smaller prosthesis. Two distinct terms are commonly used to describe the size of prosthetic valves: EOA and geometric orifice area (GOA).

### **EFFECTIVE ORIFICE AREA**

The most commonly cited definition of PPM is a low-indexed effective orifice area (iEOA). The iEOA is calculated by dividing the echocardiographically determined EOA by the body surface area. EOA is calculated by a reconfiguration of the continuity equation:

$$EOA = (CSA_{LVOT} \times TVI_{LVOT})/TVI_{AO}$$

EOA is effective orifice area (cm²).  $CSA_{IVOT}$  is cross-sectional area of the LVOT (cm²).  $TVI_{IVOT}$  is velocity time integral of forward blood flow (cm) as derived from pulse-wave Doppler in the LVOT.  $TVI_{AO}$  is velocity time integral of forward blood flow (cm) as derived from software integration of transvalvular continuous wave Doppler.

The EOA and mean systolic gradient of several commonly available bioprostheses are shown in Table 28-9.  $^{105}$ 

The EOA is a functional estimate of the minimal cross-sectional area of the transvalvular flow jet downstream of a valve and dependent on the (1) geometric area of the prosthesis, (2) shape and size of the LVOT and ascending aorta, (3) blood pressure, and (4) cardiac output. Doppler-derived EOA correlates best with catheter-derived EOA (as determined by the Gorlin formula) when the ascending aortic diameter is 4 cm, but tends to underestimate EOA in patients with smaller aortic diameters.<sup>106</sup> The EOA varies widely for valves from different producers. The measured EOA cannot be known for a specific valve in a specific patient until the valve has actually been implanted. Studies examining the effect of low iEOA on clinical outcomes have typically used projected iEOA using published tables of EOA derived from historical controls instead of actually measuring true in vivo postoperative EOA. Moreover, these tables have been derived from relatively small

numbers of valves in each size for each manufacturer with wide variability between studies. Nevertheless, such reference values can be helpful to predict the presence and severity of PPM for any given patient and valve. EOA correlates with postoperative valve gradients, which are not surprising considering that they are mathematically related. Echocardiographic mean and peak gradients are calculated according to the Bernoulli equation:

$$\begin{split} & Peak \; gradient \; (mm \; Hg) = 4 \times (V_{AV_{max}}^{\phantom{AV_{max}}^2} - V_{LVOT_{max}}^{\phantom{LVOT_{max}}^2}) \\ & Mean \; gradient \; (mm \; Hg) = 4 \times (V_{AV_{mean}}^{\phantom{AV_{mean}}^2} - V_{LVOT_{mean}}^{\phantom{LVOT_{mean}}^2}) \end{split}$$

Several authors suggest PPM occurs at an IEOA of ≤0.85 cm²/m² with moderate and severe PPM at an IEOA of 0.85 to 0.65 and ≤0.65 cm²/m², respectively. 107,108 These thresholds are used in the 2009 American Society of Echocardiography/European Association of Echocardiography Guidelines. 109 Pibarot and Dumesnil 109 have redefined PPM as a condition "when the EOA of the prosthesis is too small in relation to the patient's body size, resulting in abnormally high postoperative gradients." This definition is based on the assumption that transvalvular gradients begin to rise substantially at iEOAs below this value, and that these elevated gradients result in increased left ventricular work preventing regression of LVH.

### GEOMETRIC ORIFICE AREA

The GOA (also known as the internal geometric area) of the valve is the ex vivo measured maximal cross-sectional area of the valve opening that does not vary significantly between same-sized valves from the same manufacturer. It is a static measure that is known preoperatively for any given prosthesis based on manufacturer specifications or by measurement with calipers. The GOA is larger than the EOA for any given prosthesis (Figure 28-21).

### **CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE**

The incidence of PPM is steadily decreasing. Pibarot and Dumesnil<sup>110</sup> studied PPM in 1266 patients undergoing AVR and found moderate (iEOA < 0.85 cm²/m²) or severe (iEOA < 0.65 cm²/m²) PPM to be present in 38% of patients. A more recent study found moderate and severe PPM in only 15 and 6% of patients, respectively.<sup>111</sup> In another study, the rate of severe PPM after implantation of the Trifecta, Mitroflow, and Perimount Magna valves was 1.3% (2/150), 5.8% (44/758), and 3.2% (3/95).<sup>105</sup> The low contemporary incidence of PPM is likely a result of improved hemodynamic performance of newer generation bioprostheses and the increased awareness of poor outcomes with severe PPM and thus greater use of preventive strategies.<sup>60</sup>

There are several studies demonstrating the adverse impact of severe PPM on survival but the significance of moderate PPM still controversial. Ruel and colleagues showed that overall survival and LVM regression was poorer in patients with PPM and LVD than those who had LVD without PPM. 115 A retrospective study of 3343 patients

with mechanical and bioprosthetic AVR found that for the subgroup with LVD (EF < 50%), severe PPM was associated with greater 15-year mortality (p = .049). Two metaanalyses both showed that severe PPM impact mortality and should be avoided. A meta-analysis of 34 studies including 27,186 patients found that 34.2 and 9.8% of patients undergoing AVR had moderate and severe PPM, respectively.<sup>118</sup> Any PPM was associated with an increase in all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.18 to 1.51). Furthermore, moderate and severe PPM increased all-cause mortality (HR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.33 and HR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.38 to 2.45) and cardiacrelated mortality (HR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.71 and HR = 6.46, 95% CI: 2.79 to 14.97) (Fig. 28-22).

1.46; p = .0008) but moderate PPM was not (HR 0.99; 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.07; p = .78). As described by Pibarot et al<sup>120</sup> this is explained by the fact that moderate AS is well tolerated with normal LV but not with depressed LV. Furthermore, increased hemodynamic stress from moderate PPM may beget rapid structural valve deterioration progressing to severe PPM.<sup>121</sup>

### **SMALL AORTIC ROOT**

Many surgeons express concern regarding postoperative outcomes in patients with small aortic roots in whom only a very small (19 mm) valve can be implanted. However, several studies have shown no difference in LVM regression, NYHA functional class, CHF or survival with small diameter AVRs. 122-124 De Paulis et all show no difference in LVM regression between patients receiving 19 and 21 mm mechanical valves versus those with 23 or 25 mm valves. Kratz et all also report that small valve size was not predictive of CHF or late death. Khan et all studied 19 to 23 mm Carpentier-Edwards pericardial valves and found that significant LVM regression occurred with each valve size, including 19 mm valves.

### **DATA SYNTHESIS**

The literature is clear in that severe PPM should be avoided, particularly in those patients with poor ventricular function, but the clinical significance of less-than-severe PPM remains divided. The options to avoid PPM are implantation of a less-obstructive mechanical or stentless bioprosthesis or to perform root replacement or aortic root enlargement. Stentless prostheses in the subcoronary position may be a lower profile alternative but requires additional technical skill and cross-clamp time. Aortic root replacements or enlargement procedures require greater experience operating on the aortic root and may carry excessive mortality and wide variability in surgical outcomes even among highly experienced centers. When faced with potential PPM in the operating room, the decision to perform a more complex, higher-risk procedure must be balanced carefully with the potential benefits of implanting a larger prosthesis. Some reports have shown that transvalvular gradients in patients with lower iEOA often rise substantially with exercise. 125 Although the majority of patients undergoing AVR are elderly and unlikely to experience functional limitations from this situation, in younger,

highly active patients or those with LV dysfunction, either root enlargement or stentless prostheses may provide better functional outcome with lower transvalvular gradients. In the rare circumstance of anticipated extreme mismatch (ie, iEOA  $<0.6~\rm cm^2/m^2)$  root enlargement is an acceptable approach in the hands of an experienced surgeon. Except in these circumstances, given the paucity of long-term data to support more complex procedures and well-documented increased risk, routine AVR with modern standard prostheses is acceptable and preferable.

### **PROSTHESIS SELECTION**

An ideal aortic prosthesis would be simple to implant, widely available, possess long-term durability, would have no intrinsic thrombogenicity, would not have a predilection for endocarditis, and would have no residual transvalvular pressure gradient. Such a valve does not currently exist. Currently available options include mechanical valves, stented biologic heterograft valves, stentless biologic heterograft valves, allograft valves, and pulmonary autograft valves. Among these options pulmonary autograft and allograft valves are the most physiologic prostheses. They are less prone to thrombosis or endocarditis and have excellent hemodynamic characteristics. 126,127 They are most beneficial in children and younger adults. Allograft valves may also improve the results of AVR in active endocarditis. 128 Despite their potential benefits, these prostheses can be very technically demanding to implant. A further discussion of these valves is presented in subsequent chapters. The remainder of this discussion will focus on issues regarding selection of mechanical or bioprosthetic valves.

### Mechanical versus Biologic Valves

When selecting between mechanical and biologic heart valves, the surgeon and patient together must balance the risks of SVD with bioprosthestic valves versus need for anticoagulation with mechanical valves. The 2014 AHA/ACC Guidelines emphasizes the importance of patient preference regarding the choice of valve prosthesis.<sup>29</sup>

### **AGE CONSIDERATIONS**

Generally, patients over 70 years of age at the time of surgery should receive a biologic valve and patients under the age of 60 years should have a mechanical prosthesis to minimize the risk of structural failure requiring repeat AVR as an octogenarian. Patients between 60 and 70 represent the group in whom there is still debate regarding prosthesis selection. Those patients who have comorbidities such as severe CAD may be less likely to outlive their prosthesis and should receive a biologic valve. Having said that, there is a steady shift to greater use of bioprostheses for patients in all age cohorts, especially given the burden of anticoagulation and the potential for subsequent transcatheter valve-in-valve implantation. The STS ACSD reported a 20% absolute increase in the proportion of patients selecting bioprostheses over mechanical valves

for all patient age cohorts. 129 There was also an increase in the proportion of patients undergoing bioprosthetic AVR from 72.6% between 2002 and 2006 to 83.8% between 2007 and 2010 (p < .0001).<sup>63</sup> Chiang et al<sup>130</sup> studied 2002 propensitymatched young patient (50 to 69 years) with bioprosthetic versus mechanical AVR in New York State (1997 to 2004). As expected, they report greater 15-year reoperation rate (12.1 vs 6.9%) and lower bleeding events (6.6 vs 13.0%) bioprosthesis valves but there were no difference in 15-year actuarial survival (60.6 vs 62.1%) nor stroke events (7.7 vs 8.6%). This suggests that bioprosthetic valves offer noninferior survival without the burden of anticoagulation even for patients younger than 60 years old. As mentioned earlier, two randomized comparisons of mechanical and bioprosthetic aortic valves performed in the 1970s and one in the recent era demonstrated equivalent survival between valve types at 10 to 20 years of follow-up. 54-56 However, long-term event-free survival beyond 15 years was superior in the mechanical valve groups as the risks of reoperation and structural failures of bioprostheses became more common. A detailed and comprehensive discussion of these risks and benefits of prosthesis selection should occur with all patients and their families prior to entering the operating

### SPECIAL PATIENT GROUPS

Patients with an absolute requirement for long-term anticoagulation such as permanent atrial fibrillation, previous thromboembolic events, hypercoagulable state, severe LVD, another mechanical heart valve in place, or intracardiac thrombus, should receive a mechanical valve regardless of age. Further considerations which may impact future patient decisions include testing for genetic variants of the *CYP2C9* and *VKORC1* genes which influence warfarin response and the use of devices to facilitate home INR monitoring.

Patients with a relative or absolute contraindication to anticoagulation, such as women of child-bearing age wishing to become pregnant, patients with bleeding disorders, those who refuse or those unreliable to take oral anticoagulation should receive a bioprosthesis. However, young patients do have a higher incidence of early SVD and need to be thoroughly counselled as such. 131 Furthermore, higher incidence of accelerated SVD (47 vs 14%, p < .05) and lower freedom from reoperation (20 vs 64%, p < .05) were reported in young women during pregnancy when compared to their nonpregnant counterparts. 132 Alternatively, implantation of mechanical prostheses in such women combined with anticoagulation using subcutaneous lowmolecular weight heparin injections during the pregnancy is a possibility. The current 2014 ACC/AHA Guidelines suggest that for patients taking ≤5 mg warfarin/day to continue until delivery (Class IIa, Level of Evidence B) then switch to unfractionated heparin (UFH; Class I, Level of Evidence C). Those patients taking >5 mg warfarin/day are advised to switch to UFH or low molecular weight heparin during the first trimester (Class IIa, Level of Evidence B) and just prior to delivery (Class I, Level of Evidence C).<sup>29</sup>

Aortic valve prosthesis selection for patients with end-stage renal failure requiring dialysis is complicated by rapid SVD in bioprosthetic valves and dialysis-related bleeding due to anticoagulation necessary for mechanical prostheses. A systematic review of the literature report an acceptable operative mortality, no difference in survival between bioprosthetic versus mechanical valves (HR = 1.3; 95% CI: 1.0 to 1.9, p = .09) but lower valve-related complications (OR: 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2 to 0.7, p = .002), including bleeding and thromboembolism. The 2014 ACC/AHA Guidelines do not offer recommendations for valve selection in this patient subset and ultimately, the decision should be individualized balancing the risks of valve-related complications as well as the anticipated survival of the patient.

### Stented versus Stentless Biologic Valves

Stentless porcine valves gained popularity in cardiac surgery due to pioneering work by Dr. Tirone David at the Toronto General Hospital in 1988.<sup>134</sup> Stentless valves lack obstructive stents and strut posts, thus have residual gradients that are similar to those of freehand allografts. However, their use involves a more complex operation as they are more difficult to implant and require a longer cross-clamp time. Walther and colleagues<sup>135</sup> performed a randomized trial comparing the ability of stented porcine and stentless porcine valves to cause regression of LVH. They showed that patients in the stentless valve group received larger valves for a given annular size and had a slightly higher degree of LVM regression. Borger et al<sup>136</sup> showed modestly lower mean gradients in stentless prostheses versus stented prostheses (9 vs 15 mm Hg) and LVMI (100 vs 107 g/m<sup>2</sup>) but no difference in survival. Cheng et al<sup>137</sup> performed a meta-analysis of 17 randomized trials and 14 nonrandomized studies comparing stented to stentless aortic valves. They showed no difference in 2–10 year mortality (OR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.50 to 1.33), PPM (OR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.05 to 1.66), but stentless valves were associated with greater EOA index and lower mean gradients.

Little evidence exists regarding any incremental benefit of hemodynamic improvements afforded by stentless valves in LVM regression or clinical outcomes. Thus, the routine use of stentless bioprostheses cannot be recommended for most patients with small aortic roots based on currently available data. At this time, stentless porcine valves are most useful in younger active patients with small aortic roots who are likely to be limited by the elevated residual gradient a small stented bioprosthesis may create.

## PERCUTANEOUS VALVULAR INTERVENTIONS

### Percutaneous Aortic Balloon Valvotomy

As an alternative to surgical management for AS, percutaneous balaortic valvotomy may be performed. <sup>138</sup> Inflation of the balloon within the valve orifice can stretch the annular tissue and fracture calcified areas or open fused commissures. There is no

role for valvotomy in the patient with significant AR, as this will become significantly worse after the procedure. <sup>139,140</sup> Balloon valvotomy is rarely successful if significant calcification is present and carries a prohibitive risk of stroke from calcific emboli. <sup>141</sup> The long-term outcomes of this procedure in adult patients are dismal, with restenosis usually occurring within 1 year. Prior to the TAVI era, patients with severe symptomatic AS who were too hemodynamically unstable to tolerate an operation or have comorbid illnesses, such as advanced malignancy, which contraindicate an operation, may have benefited from palliative balloon valvotomy. <sup>142,143</sup> Currently, this procedure may be considered to temporize a critically ill patient with AS until definitive surgery or TAVR can be performed (AHA/ACC Guidelines, Class IIb, Level of Evidence C). <sup>29</sup>

## Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR)

Surgical AVR is the gold standard treatment for aortic valve stenosis but up to one-third of patients are not candidates due to advanced age, heart failure, or other specific anatomic factors. 144 Since the first clinical description in 2002, TAVR offers an alternative to surgical AVR in select patients. 145 Currently, two commonly used valve systems are the SAPIEN 3 (Edwards Life Sciences) and the CoreValve Evolut R (Medtronic), although various other valves exist in different stages of development and evaluation (Fig. 28-23). Each valve system includes (1) the valve prosthesis, (2) the stent or frame, (3) the loading system and (4) the delivery system. The Edwards Lifesciences SAPIEN 3 (Edwards Lifesciences) is based on the perimount design with a bovine pericardial valve on a balloon-expandable stent. Whereas the CoreValve Evolut R (Medtronic) and Portico (St. Jude Medical) are porcine pericardial valves on self-expanding nitonol frames.

The approach is accomplished via a retrograde transarterial or transapical manner. The retrograde femoral approach involves femoral artery access, retrograde cannulation of the aortic valve, balloon dilatation, and device delivery. Alternatively transapical transcatheter valve delivery involves creating a small thoracotomy, direct cannulation of the left ventricular apex, and passing of a wire and stent-mounted valve under fluoroscopic and echocardiographic guidance. Both techniques require rapid ventricular pacing to ensure there is no cardiac output during device deployment. Other reported access routes include direct aortic via hemisternotomy or sternotomy, as well as retrograde via axillary, subclavian, or carotid arteries.

The PARTNER Trials have demonstrated symptom relief and survival benefit with TAVR for high-risk and prohibitive risk, nonoperative patients. 146-149 In PARTNER B, TAVI was associated with lower death or mortality at 1 year (43 vs 72%) and lower death at 2 years (43 vs 68%) compared with medical management in 358 nonoperative patients with severe symptomatic AS. 146-147 In PARTNER A, 699 patients with high-risk (operative mortality > 15% and STS PROM >10%) severe symptomatic AS were randomized to TAVR or surgical AVR. Both 1-year (24 vs 27%, NS) and 2-year mortality (34 vs 35%, NS) were not different between TAVR

and surgery. 148-149 In both studies TAVR was associated with higher stroke and vascular complications. Decision making between TAVR and surgery has emphasized the importance of a multidisciplinary Heart Team in the evaluation of higher risk patients (ACC/AHA Guidelines, Class I, Level of Evidence C). The composition of the Heart Team will vary between centers but should include specialists from cardiac imaging, interventional cardiology, cardiac anesthesia, and cardiac surgery. Based on the results of PARTNER Cohort B, TAVR should be considered for inoperable patients with AS and a life expectancy of >1 year (ACC/AHA Guidelines, Class I, Level of Evidence B). Based on the results of PART-NER Cohort A, TAVR is reasonable for high-risk operable patients with AS (ACC/AHA Guidelines, Class IIa, Level of Evidence B). 148,149 High-risk patients are defined as those with STS PROM > 8%, ≥2 frailty indices, compromise in 2 organ systems or possible presence of a procedure-specific impediment. Importantly, TAVR should not be offered to patients with severe comorbidities limiting life despite relief of AS (Class III, Level of Evidence B). This is a result of the lack of benefit from TAVR in the PARTNER Cohort B study subset with STS score > 15%.147

A nonrandomized trial of CoreValve Evolut R (Medtronic) showed comparable safety (8.4% 30-day all-cause mortality) and efficacy (99.4% implantation) with SAPIEN (Edwards Life Sciences). Then the CHOICE Study randomized high-risk patients to either SAPIEN XT (Edwards Life Sciences) versus CoreValve (Medtronic) and report no difference in 30-day cardiovascular mortality (RR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.29 to 3.25; p = .99) and lower residual aortic insufficiency (4.1 vs 18.3%; RR: 0.23; 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.58; p < .001) but higher heart block requiring permanent pacemaker with

the CoreValve (Medtronic, 37.6 vs 17.3%, p = .001).<sup>151</sup> The incidences of TAVR mortality and complications are consistent with that published by the large European registries France 2 and German Transcatheter Aortic Valve Interventions-Registry.<sup>152,153</sup>

Given the success of the PARTNER trials in high and prohibitive surgical risk patients and retrospective studies of TAVR in low and moderate risk patients, the PARTNER II (http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01314313) and SURTAVI (http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01586910) RCTs are testing the outcome of broadening the application of TAVR into intermediate risk patients with severe AS. 154
