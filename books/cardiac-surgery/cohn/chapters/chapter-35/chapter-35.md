# Mitral Valve Repair

Dan Loberman • Paul A. Pirundini • John G. Byrne • Lawrence H. Cohn

It can be reasonably argued that the very dawn of cardiac surgery began with a mitral valve repair. On May 20, 1923, Dr Elliot Carr Cutler (Fig. 35-1) performed the world's first successful mitral valve repair at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. 1 Dr Cutler carried out a transventricular mitral valve commissurotomy with a neurosurgical tenotomy knife on a critically ill 12-year-old girl. His choice of instrument was likely influenced by Dr Harvey Cushing who was surgeon-in-chief at the time. A new era in surgery was introduced as well as the reality of mitral valve repair.2 Cutler had worked assiduously on this problem in the Surgical Research Laboratories of Harvard Medical School before turning his attention to this critically ill patient. Subsequent attempts at this operation using a device to cut out a segment of the diseased mitral valve resulted in several deaths from massive mitral regurgitation and Cutler eventually abandoned the procedure.3 Of Cutler's contemporaries, Henry Souttar of England performed a single successful transatrial finger commissurotomy in 1925, but received no further referrals.4 After Souttar, there remained little activity in mitral valve repair until the 1940s when Dwight Harken, then the Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, published his groundbreaking series of valvuloplasty patients for mitral stenosis.<sup>5</sup> Dr Charles Bailey of Philadelphia also published a concomitant series of a similar large group of patients.6

That early era focused on mitral stenosis created by rheumatic heart disease, which was extremely common at the time. Surgical treatment of mitral regurgitation for prolapse was first introduced in the 1950s<sup>7-9</sup> but with limited success. Subsequent decades would see the visionary concepts of surgical leaders such as Alain Carpentier, Dwight McGoon, Carlos Duran, and others come to the fore as their visionary ideas for mitral valve reconstruction began to take hold and excellent results were reported. Like many other groundbreaking ideas, their concepts were met with resistance that has gradually dissipated as long-term results by these surgeons have been validated. The concept that repair of mitral regurgitation might serve to further damage a weakened left ventricle (LV) by eliminating the "pop-off" mechanism<sup>16</sup> of the regurgitant valve. This proved a significant barrier to referral that only in the past few decades has been overcome.

What has now become firmly established is the significant contribution to overall left ventricular function of the papillary muscle-annular interaction.<sup>17</sup> As a result of these contributions, mitral valve repair, if technically possible, has now become recognized as the procedure of choice for mitral valve pathology of virtually all etiologies, to the extent that mitral valve repair is always considered first in virtually any clinical situation in which the mitral valve is regurgitant.

#### **ANATOMY OF THE MITRAL VALVE**

The bicuspid mitral valve is one of the most complex structures of the human heart, its complexity lies in its multifaceted anatomy. The concept of "form follows function" is particularly applicable to the mitral valve. Because each part of the valve's anatomy is intimately related to function, there are a variety of pathways whereby regurgitation may be created. If one part of the valvular apparatus fails, regurgitation can result. There are five discrete components to the mitral valve complex: the annulus, the two leaflets (anterior and posterior), the chordae, the papillary muscles, and the LV (Fig. 35-2A).

As part of the fibrous skeleton of the heart, the annulus is the myocardial connective tissue area where the mitral valve leaflets attach to the intersection of the left atrium and LV. It is surrounded by vitally important structures that the cardiac surgeon must avoid for safe surgery: the circumflex coronary artery laterally, the coronary sinus medially, the aortic root superiorly, and the atrioventricular node superior-medially. In myxomatous disease it is the posterior annulus that usually dilates. 18 Previous dictum held that the anterior annulus does not dilate, but recent data suggest that it may dilate a limited amount. 19 Of critical importance to the surgeon are the right and left fibrous trigones. These are intimately related to the anterior annulus and are contiguous with the aortic valve curtain and must be identified during surgery. The trigones, as part of the essential structural framework of the heart, form the anchoring points for ring annuloplasty.

The anterior leaflet of the mitral valve (AML) is in continuity with the left and noncoronary cusps of the aortic valve and is located directly beneath the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT). It is sometimes referred to as the aortic

leaflet. It typically accounts for approximately one-third of the circumference of the annulus, with the posterior leaflet accounting for the rest.<sup>20</sup> The posterior mitral valve leaflet (PML) is crescent shaped and is more commonly involved in degenerative disease. For surgical decision making and analysis, both the anterior and posterior leaflets are divided into three parts, corresponding to the three scalloped areas of each leaflet (A1, A2, A3 for the anterior leaflet; P1, P2, and P3 for the posterior leaflet; 1 refers to the leftmost, or lateral scallop; 2 the middle scallop; and 3 the rightmost, or medial scallop; Fig. 35-2B).

There are two papillary muscles, the anterolateral and the posteromedial. Each muscle is attached to the leaflets by the chordae tendinae. These chords are composed of stringlike fibrous connective tissue. Primary chords are those that attach to the edge of the leaflet. Secondary chords are those that attach to the underside of the leaflets. Tertiary chords, which are only seen on the posterior mitral leaflet, are those that attach to the undersurface of the leaflet directly from the ventricular wall instead of from the papillary muscle. The papillary muscles each give off chordae to both leaflets and correspond to the anterolateral and posteromedial commissures of the mitral valve. The anterolateral papillary muscle receives blood from both the left anterior descending artery as well as the circumflex artery; the posteromedial one receives blood usually from only the posterior descending artery or a branch of the circumflex artery. Because of its single coronary blood supply, the posteromedial papillary muscle is more susceptible to infarction and rupture than the anterolateral one.

The LV acts in concert with the papillary muscles via the chordae to pull in the leaflet edges during systole, thereby maintaining the line of coaptation and therefore valve competency. If the LV dilates from any etiology, failure of central leaflet coaptation may occur and regurgitation created. Such regurgitation in a valve with *normal leaflets but dilated annulus* is termed *functional* mitral regurgitation (MR).

## MYXOMATOUS MITRAL VALVE DISEASE

#### **Etiology and Pathophysiology**

The underlying etiology of myxomatous disease is a defect in the fibroelastic connective tissue of the valvular leaflets, chordae, and annulus.<sup>21</sup> The myxomatous defect leads to an abnormal elongation and redundancy of valve tissue and chordae. Each particular anatomic redundancy creates mitral regurgitation in its own particular manner. Annular dilatation (Fig. 35-3) obliterates the normal coaptation line between the anterior and posterior leaflet, causing regurgitation. If primarily posterior annular dilatation occurs, there is a separation in the middle of the valve between the two leaflets and blood leaks through during ventricular contraction. Leaflet redundancy results in a movement of the redundant leaflet into the left atrium during diastole. If severe enough, that movement leads to a compromised coaptation line and MR then ensues. Elongation of the chordae also causes leaflet tissue to move into the atrium during diastole, also resulting in compromised coaptation. Ruptured or flail leaflets are often the result of systolic stresses fracturing weakened chordae, causing severe regurgitation.

Mitral regurgitation represents pure volume overload for the LV.<sup>22</sup> In myxomatous disease, MR is typically of the chronic compensated variety.<sup>23</sup> A vicious cycle is perpetuated whereby the excess volume load over time results in ventricular failure. Ventricular failure itself implies ventricular dilatation, which results in a greater degree of MR. Thus, MR begets more MR, and a downward spiral is created.<sup>17</sup> MR created by left ventricular failure occurs primarily by ventricular dilatation. Successful repair will result in left ventricular mass reduction.<sup>24</sup> Ventricular dilatation "pulls" or "tethers" the leaflets open, thereby impinging on coaptation. In degenerative disease of the mitral valve, however, the LV itself per se does not primarily cause MR in the early course of the disease.

Carpentier<sup>10</sup> has developed a mitral valve analysis protocol and surgical philosophy for repair of all types of valves (Fig. 35-4). Myxomatous disease has become the pathology responsible for the vast majority of patients with mitral regurgitation in the United States.<sup>25</sup> Currently, mitral valve prolapse, as a part of the spectrum of degenerative disease, is present in about 5% of the general population,<sup>26</sup> with about 10% of these patients exhibiting severe MR requiring surgery.<sup>27</sup> Whatever the ultimate pathologic pathway creating

regurgitation, more than 95% of all degenerative disease should be amenable to successful repair.

# Diagnostic Work-up and Indications for Operation

Patient presentation is typically quite varied depending on the degree of MR as well as the chronicity of the disease. Patients may be floridly symptomatic or completely asymptomatic. Symptoms can occur in different forms. Heart failure symptoms are secondary to pulmonary venous hypertension as well as fluid retention. This may include shortness of breath, limited exertional capacity, fluid overload, and in the late stage of the disease, frank heart failure. Embolization sequelae and arrhythmias form a second set of symptoms and include atrial fibrillation and increased stroke risk. <sup>28</sup> Additionally, regurgitation predisposes the valve to infectious endocarditis. <sup>29</sup> Abnormal hemodynamics create pathologic shear stresses and turbulence that generates vulnerability to infection in the valve.

#### **Evaluating MR**

Key information is obtained from echocardiography: the degree of MR, associated pathophysiology, cardiac chamber dimensions, and left ventricular functional analysis. Transthoracic echocardiography is usually the first modality employed. However, if images from transthoracic echocardiography are of insufficient quality, then transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is required. Mitral regurgitation is graded on a scale from mild to severe, with severe typically referring to a reversal of pulmonary venous blood flow in systole.<sup>30</sup> The methods used to determine the degree of regurgitation commonly include regurgitant volume, regurgitant fraction, and effective regurgitant orifice area.<sup>30</sup> Echocardiographic analysis of the MR (eg, flail leaflet, ruptured chordae, or anterior

or posterior prolapse) is extremely helpful in planning the operative intervention. Other crucial information obtained by the preoperative echo includes left atrial size, ventricular function, ventricular dilatation, aortic valve function, and tricuspid valve function. A large left atrium implies chronic MR. A small LA and hyperdynamic LV implies acute MR. Ventricular function is a key component in assessing operative candidacy; a left ventricular ejection fraction below the norm of 60% indicates some degree of myocardial decompensation secondary to volume overload. Indeed, in the presence of severe MR, the ejection fraction will often decline postoperatively even if the preop ejection fraction is normal. A corollary of this fact is a normal preoperative ejection fraction does not necessarily mean normal ventricular function.

### **Timing of Surgery**

Once pulmonary hypertension, LV dysfunction/LA dilatation or symptoms appear, the prognosis of MR worsens. Careful surveillance may result in timing of valve surgery before these negative sequelae occur. On An attractive alternative strategy for treating severe chronic primary MR is to perform early mitral repair before these triggers are reached. Early mitral repair avoids the need for intensive surveillance and also obviates the possibility that patients might become lost to follow-up or delay seeing their clinician until advanced LV dysfunction has already ensued. This strategy requires expertise in clinical evaluation and cardiac imaging to evaluate severity and significance of MR.

What, precisely, are the indications for operation? In general, as surgical results improve, the indications for surgery

![](_page_3_Picture_10.jpeg)

FIGURE 35-4 Carpentier's functional classification.

are broadening. The American Heart Association 2014 guidelines state that "Mitral valve repair is reasonable in asymptomatic patients with chronic severe primary MR (stage C1) with preserved LV function (LVEF > 60% and LVESD 0 40 mm) in whom the likelihood of a successful and durable repair without residual MR is greater than 95% with an expected mortality rate of less than 1% when performed at a Heart Valve Center of Excellence." Patients who would never have been considered for surgery previously are now routinely being offered repair surgery at much earlier stages of their disease. The indications for mitral valve repair have widened as the success of repair has so dramatically improved over the last several years. Better myocardial protection and cardiopulmonary bypass technology, minimally invasive incisions, increased incidence of repair, and better intensive care unit support have all contributed to the phenomenon.<sup>31</sup> The biggest change has been an overall broadening of the indications for mitral valve repair and lowering of the threshold for operation because of these factors,<sup>32</sup> even in the elderly.<sup>33</sup> Increasingly, asymptomatic mitral regurgitation, even without symptoms, is becoming accepted as a reasonable strategy.<sup>34</sup> Repair of the mitral valve, as opposed to replacement, is now accepted as the superior treatment for myxomatous mitral regurgitation. Out of a long laboratory and clinical experience have come the conclusions that repair is associated with better survival, enhanced preservation of ventricular function (by preserving the chordae and papillary muscles), and decreased late thromboembolic complications. 35-42

For all patients with moderate-to-severe MR and moderately decreased ventricular function (left ventricular ejection fraction < 60%) valve repair is offered, because the ventricle has exhibited signs of decompensation even with a lesser degree of MR; repair in this setting is much more urgent, because severe decompensation can occur in a matter of months as left ventricular function begins to deteriorate.

The standard of care for patients with severe cardiomyopathy and severe MR is unclear presently and is one of the most controversial topics in cardiac surgery. This situation typically does not occur with myxomatous disease but rather ischemia or idiopathic cardiomyopathy and such regurgitation is functional in nature. In longstanding myxomatous disease, however, LV dysfunction may be present.

The intermediate situation of moderate mitral regurgitation and preserved ventricular function is the one in which the most judgment must be exercised. Consider the situation of a structurally normal mitral valve with moderate functional MR, but with concomitant critical aortic stenosis. The patient is to undergo an aortic valve replacement. Should the mitral valve be repaired? Perhaps not, as the moderate MR here is typically exacerbated by the patient's aortic stenosis and volume overload, and correction of the aortic stenosis and euvoluemia would likely reduce or eliminate the MR in this structurally normal valve. <sup>39,40</sup> However, should repair be undertaken, ring annuloplasty would be needed to correct the posterior annular dilatation. If the same situation exists, however, with a structurally abnormal valve, such as a prolapsed

P2 or markedly dilated mitral annulus in a myxomatous valve, then mitral repair should always be undertaken, because there is a structural abnormality that aortic valve replacement will not correct. What of moderate MR secondary to myxomatous disease (and not ischemia) in a patient who is to undergo coronary bypass grafting? That patient would likely be offered concomitant valve repair, because bypass grafting would not impact on the pathophysiology of the MR in this case. What of the situation of moderate-to-severe isolated MR secondary to myxomatous disease and borderline normal ventricular function? Even without symptoms of heart failure, this patient should have repair performed on an elective basis. Once left ventricular function begins to deteriorate from the normal 60 to 70% left ventricular ejection fraction, decline may be unpredictably rapid and hence intervention warranted. Increasingly, moderate ischemic, as well as degenerative, MR is thought to be detrimental for long-term survival. 41,42

In general, no matter what the chronological age is, adequate functional status before valve repair is preferred. If symptoms of heart failure exist before surgery, optimal diuresis should be undertaken before operation. If the procedure involves coronary artery bypass grafting, the conduit status should be determined. Dental clearance on all patients should be obtained before any valvular procedure. If neurologic symptoms exist or if the patient has a history of a previous cerebrovascular disease, then preoperative carotid noninvasive studies are warranted to assess carotid arterial stenosis. All patients older than 40 years should undergo coronary angiography. Patients with MR without coronary artery disease are good candidates for smaller incisions. <sup>43,45</sup>

Whatever the scenario, the decision to operate and repair the valve is a decision made preoperatively as opposed to intraoperatively. Once the patient is under anesthesia, loading conditions are not physiologic and the mitral regurgitation assessed then is inevitably underestimated. Maneuvers used to "bring out the MR," such as increasing afterload with vasoactive drugs, do not reflect true physiology, but should be used in surgical decision making and may be helpful in some situations. Recent discussions of earlier referral for the treatment of MR clearly depend on a high rate of valve repair in any center. 46,47

## **Operative Philosophy**

Clearly, in light of elevated success rates of mitral valve repair in specialized centers but also today in all cardiac surgery programs, the patient with degenerative mitral valve disease with significant MR requires a repair procedure, rather than replacement.<sup>49</sup>

With the increasing numbers of trained surgeons who have absorbed the various mitral valve repair techniques and can apply them safely the percentage of valves that can be repaired and actually are repaired, is improving. Recent STS database interrogation indicates that this percentage may now be as high as 75%. 49

Beginning in the 1980s, we have developed what we think is a simple, reproducible algorithm that can be used to repair

the degenerative mitral valve in most patients. Overriding this philosophy is the belief that mitral valve repair is not an esoteric "art form" that is difficult to explain, perform, or learn. Rather, we think it is a procedure like any other that should and can be simplified, disseminated, and reproduced with success. In keeping with this philosophy, we have reduced complicated bileaflet prolapse to a competent valve with simplified and straightforward maneuvers that we have found effective with good long-term results. Our overall philosophy and technique are as follows:

- 1. Expose the valve well through the complete development of Sondergaard's groove, division of pericardial attachments of the superior and inferior venae cavae, and release of the left pericardial retraction stitches
- 2. Assess the valve through saline injection and corroborate the intraoperative findings with TEE
- 3. Perform basic, obvious leaflet repair procedures first (eg, quadrangular resections to the posterior leaflet)
- 4. Implant the annuloplasty ring sized by the height of the anterior leaflet (not the trigones or commissures)
- 5. Test the repair
- 6. Perform additional reparative procedures as needed, that is, cleft closure.

With the above maneuvers, we estimate that approximately 95% of all degenerative valves can be repaired.

Collaborative involvement with cardiac anesthesia colleagues is essential in utilizing the invaluable tool of transesophageal echocardiogram monitoring for pre- and postrepair assessment. In our clinic, standard TEE monitoring (either two- or three-dimensional) is now utilized for every patient undergoing mitral valve repair. In addition to documenting the efficacy of repair, TEE is essential in preventing and assessing the potential or persistence of systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the anterior valve.

## **Operative Exposure**

Because the mitral valve is such a complex anatomic structure and the maneuvers involved in correcting a regurgitant valve may vary from the simple to the very complex, adequate exposure is an absolute requirement in every operative plan. This becomes more important if minimally invasive techniques are employed. Mitral valve exposure is more challenging than exposure of the aortic or tricuspid valve. Why? From the surgeon's side, the mitral valve is furthest away from the operating surgeon than any other valve. In addition, the valve in its native position naturally faces above and/or toward the surgeon's left shoulder at an oblique angle such that the surgeon does not see the valve en face.

The first critical aspect to the standard valve repair is the complete and thorough development of the Sondergaard plane reflecting the right atrium off the left atrium to the atrial septum, as depicted in Fig. 35-5. This was first described in the 1950s by the Danish surgeon Sondergaard, 50 to expose the atrial septum for noncardiopulmonary bypass treatment of atrial septal defects. In 1990, we stressed the

![](_page_5_Picture_14.jpeg)

**FIGURE 35-5** Dissection of Sondergaard's plane. Sondergaard's plane should be dissected at least 2 to 4 cm from the right superior pulmonary vein for adequate exposure of the mitral valve.

importance of this particular technique for exposure in mitral valve surgery.<sup>51</sup> Regardless of even previous procedures, it should always be possible to dissect out the groove without significant difficulty. The complete and full development of the groove is a most important aspect to obtain adequate exposure of the mitral valve. With this technique, via blunt and sharp dissection we typically have not needed any other incision for mitral valve repair or replacement, whether for primary surgery or reoperation. This incision usually brings the surgeon very close to the mitral valve. Once the right atrium is dissected off the left atrium, a generous incision in the left atrium is made, avoiding the atrial septum.

The second aspect of exposure is to bring the valve as close to an en face position to the operating surgeon as possible. Pericardial stay sutures are released on the left side. The operating table is maneuvered head up and to the left. If necessary, the left pericardium is opened and the apex of the heart moved laterally to the left pleural space. Exposure of the left trigone can be particularly challenging for stitch placement. This can be facilitated with local epicardial displacement of the midlateral LV wall medially with aspongestick (Fig. 35-6).

## Cardiopulmonary Bypass

For cardiopulmonary bypass, we use a 22F percutaneous femoral vein venous catheter placed into the right atrium via the right femoral vein with TEE control. The cannula can even be advanced into the superior vena cava if desired. Because the cannula has multiple holes, is flexible and thus can still drain the inferior vena cava, this one cannula is sometimes all that is needed for drainage of both the superior and inferior vena cava. If performing a concomitant bypass procedure requiring a full sternotomy, then venous cannulation should be bicaval via the atria. One venous cannula should be placed in the superior vena cava above the right atrial/

![](_page_6_Picture_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 35-6** Minimally invasive mitral valve repair. (A) Via a 6- to 8-cm skin incision, a lower hemisternotomy through the right second interspace is performed. (B) Venous cannulation is percutaneous with vacuum assist. Aortic cannulation, cross-clamping, and cardioplegia administration are performed in the standard manner.

superior vena caval junction and the other through the lowest part of the right atrium into the mouth of the inferior vena cava. The arterial cannula should be placed directly into the distal ascending aorta.

Once on cardiopulmonary bypass, systemic temperature is allowed to drift to 34°, the ascending aorta is cross-clamped, and the heart arrested by cold blood cardioplegia. For isolated valve repair, some debate still exists regarding the use of retrograde or antegrade blood cardioplegia after cross-clamping. If there is concomitant coronary artery disease, myocardial protection in this circumstance should be antegrade and retrograde, because the coronary artery bypass graft/mitral operation presents one of the highest-risk operative settings in cardiac surgery.<sup>36</sup>

After the heart is arrested, the left atrium is opened well above the right superior pulmonary vein near the septum inferiorly. Retractors are placed (Fig. 35-7). The patient's bed is placed head up with a tilt to the left. A wire-reinforced suction catheter is placed in the left inferior pulmonary vein (the most dependent portion of the left atrium in this position) for drainage of collateral blood flow. Carbon dioxide is infused to minimize intracardiac air.

Alternate exposures can be obtained by the transseptal approach through the right atrium<sup>52</sup> or the superior septal approach.<sup>53</sup> The transseptal approach is a perfectly acceptable incision that allows the cardiac surgeon to be close to the mitral valve by carrying the incision through the fossa ovalis (Fig. 35-8) and up into the superior vena cava. Retraction sutures and other types of retraction devices can be utilized to expose the mitral valve exceedingly well, particularly in these minimally invasive cases. This approach may also be helpful

in patients who have had previous operations on the mitral valve or when concomitant procedures on the tricuspid valve are required.

### **Examination of Valve and Valve Analysis**

Once exposure is obtained and a self-retaining retractor is in place, inspection of the valve is carried out. Valve analysis takes a few minutes utilizing nerve hooks, forceps, and insufflation of the ventricle with saline to determine and corroborate the pathology already diagnosed by intraoperative TEE. Valve analysis may reveal ruptured chordae or simply a prolapse of the valve with elongated chords and one or more prolapsed sections of the valve. The anterior leaflet, though frequently advertised as part of "bileaflet prolapse," often has normal length chordae and may be without specific leaflet or subvalvular pathology. Prolapse of the commissures may be found, and calcified nodules may exist that may present difficulty in mitral valve repair and may need excision. There may be healed endocarditic vegetations on one or more parts of the valve. The annulus will almost always appear to be distorted, dilated, or deformed in long-standing cases, particularly in Barlow syndrome.

## Repair Strategy and Overview

After the analysis of the valve is carried out, a detailed reparative strategy can be deduced from the pathologic analysis. In a broad generalization, degenerative disease of the mitral valve creates what amounts to a PML that is too large, with or without flail segments, in an annulus that is functionally too small for the anterior leaflet. In degenerative disease, the

![](_page_7_Picture_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 35-7** Minimally invasive operative exposure. After the retractors are placed, the patient is positioned with head up and the operative bed tilted to the left. Exposure is excellent.

posterior leaflet is typically pathologic, whereas the anterior leaflet usually is not.

The first principle of the repair is to reduce or obliterate the enlarged segments and to reduce the overall height of the abnormally large posterior leaflet. This reduction reconstructs the correct coaptation line with the anterior leaflet, and, just as importantly, prevents systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the anterior leaflet. If the height of the posterior leaflet is too high, it will push the anterior leaflet into the LVOT and create SAM. In general, the height of the posterior leaflet should be no more than 1 to 1.5 cm in average-sized patients once the repair is complete. The normal sections of the posterior leaflet should be used as a marker to guide the reduction of the redundant parts. Ultimately, the reconstructed posterior leaflet should appear like a "smile." Once the posterior leaflet reduction is performed, one must ensure that the anterior leaflet coapts with the subsequently reduced posterior leaflet within the correct plane using the saline test. The resulting repair should result in a coaptation line at the level of the annulus during systole. Specific methods to lower the height of the posterior leaflet and anterior leaflet will be addressed below.

A new concept of 'respect rather than resect' has become popular in recent years. Instead of resecting the leaflet segment that is flailing, this same segment is brought down back to form a coaptation line using polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) suture to form neochords. The excess tissue is displaced into the LV to form a new and durable coaptation

line. This approach is of value especially in small access procedures, in which implementation of more complex resection and repair can be cumbersome. Regardless of the surgeon's choice regarding whether to 'respect or resect', a prosthetic ring or band is mandatory in all repair procedures. The result of avoiding an annuloplasty ring is a significantly higher risk of recurrent moderate-to-severe mitral valve regurgitation.

A remodeling annuloplasty ring is essential for all repairs. This is a fundamental concept of Carpentier<sup>18</sup> and Duran,<sup>54</sup> both of whom developed mitral valve annuloplasty rings early in the history of mitral valve regurgitation surgery and advocated remodeling of the distorted annulus as a key principle of mitral valve repair. The annulus, after many years of regurgitation, is often deformed and in myxomatous disease, it is floppy and dilated. The best approach to conceptualize the dilated annulus in myxomatous disease is to consider it functionally too small for the anterior leaflet.

When dilated, the annulus will not provide the relatively stable support necessary for the anterior leaflet to spread out completely and thus coapt at the correct line and in the correct plane with the posterior leaflet. Rather, the floppy annulus will buckle and have an effectively smaller radius, and cause the anterior leaflet to appear as though it is "prolapsing" because the leaflet cannot spread out correctly. In reality the pathology is within the annulus. That is why we believe that oversizing the ring in degenerative disease is important. The ring then

![](_page_8_Picture_2.jpeg)

recreates the relatively rigid, broad annulus that allows the anterior leaflet to spread out and coapt in the correct plane, at the correct coaptation line, without "prolapsing." A structurally sound annulus is necessary for the correct physiologic function of the anterior leaflet. Hence, our protocol is to place the annuloplasty ring after posterior leaflet repair and then reassess for any anterior or complex leaflet pathology afterward. A annular pathology often falsely gives the appearance of leaflet pathology, and by following the steps outlined above, many unnecessary procedures will be prevented.

By utilizing the two principles outlined above, the proper and necessary attention is given to the correct physiologic functioning of the valve in a manner that is surgically relevant. The height of the posterior leaflet is reduced to prevent SAM as well as to allow the correct coaptation plane. The two leaflets are made to coapt at the correct line by reinforcing the annulus with a remodeling ring. As outlined above, in our experience at the Brigham and that of others, 55 in most cases, the so-called "bileaflet prolapse" is completely eliminated by adequate posterior leaflet resection and a large remodeling annuloplasty ring without any further anterior leaflet intervention.

There is clear evidence supporting the integral and essential necessity of the ring for a lasting repair. In an early paper on mitral valve repair, we compared a repair group that had no annuloplasty ring to another group in whom a ring was implanted at the time of valve repair. <sup>56</sup> All valves were competent at the time of surgery, but after several years of follow-up, the rate of mitral regurgitation in the no-ring group was five times that of the ring group. Recent studies have supported the importance of ring annuloplasty. <sup>57</sup> Thus, a remodeling ring is critical to a long-lasting physiologic mitral valve repair.

#### SPECIFIC SURGICAL TECHNIQUES

## Posterior Leaflet Quadrangular Resection

The most common mitral valve pathologies (approximately 80%) encountered in the myxomatous, degenerated valve are ruptured and elongated chords from the middle section of the posterior leaflet (Fig. 35-9A). In one approach limited resection of this diseased section of leaflet is shown in

![](_page_9_Picture_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 35-9** Repair of P2 with flail segment with ruptured chordae. (A) The classic flail P2 segment. (B) Resection of this flail segment. (C) and (D) The classic sliding valvuloplasty and advancement, in which each segment of the valve adjacent to the resected P2 segment is separated from the annulus. The valve is then reattached with the gap eliminated. At the same time, the height of the posterior leaflet is reduced. (E), (F), and (G) Completion of the classic sliding valvuloplasty. (H), (I), and (J) Placement of the annuloplasty stitches and ring placement. Sizing of the ring is done by the size of the anterior leaflet.

Fig. 35-9B. To fill the gap produced by removing the pathologic section, leaflet advancement of the remaining leaflet sections is carried out (Fig. 35-9C and D) and the cut edges of the valve are reapproximated with running monofilament suture (Fig. 35-9E, F, and G). An annuloplasty ring is then implanted (Fig. 35-9H, I, and J). This scenario is the most common pathophysiology encountered and operative strategy employed. Interestingly, recent results by Perier<sup>58</sup> and Lawrie<sup>59</sup> have reported successful results with use of only artificial PTFE chords to preserve the posterior leaflet instead of resecting it, a technique that has traditionally been applied only to the anterior leaflet.

For cardiac surgeons who perform a modest number of valve repairs, incising the posterior leaflet off the annulus may be somewhat daunting. In our own experience, a prolapsed leaflet without ruptured chordae at P2 may simply be obliterated by a few sutures to bring the leading edge of the prolapsed leaflet to the underside of the annular connection, thus reducing the height, preserving all the chords, and

accomplishing what might be done with a resection.<sup>61</sup> This has been termed a "folding valvuloplasty."

If the repair includes a resection of a flail segment, then some form of the leaflet advancement technique popularized by Carpentier should be employed. In this technique, the two remaining sections are advanced upon each other to close the gap produced by the resected area. This includes separating each remaining segment off the annulus for a short segment. Of all the traditional techniques, this is the one that has produced some concern for surgeons who perform only moderate numbers of valve repairs because of the necessity of incising the posterior leaflet off the annulus and then reanastomosing the leaflet to the annulus.

We have evolved a simplified technique for limited PML resections in which leaflet advancement may be more easily performed, and yet still accomplish the exact same result in much less time. We have named this the "fold-over leaflet advancement." In this technique the remaining enlarged segments of P2, on either side of the elongated resected leaflet

Performed for a prolapsed and flail P2 segment here, the fold-over advancement accomplished the same goals as the classic sliding valvuloplasty, but with simpler surgical techniques. After resection of the flail P2 segment (B), the cut edges of each side of the resulting gap are sewn to the annulus as they are "folded down." This is done for each side of the gap for half of the original height of each side. The top halves are then sewn together (E). The result is that the leaflet gap is eliminated and the height of the leaflet reduced.

with supporting chordae, are simply folded over by a continuous polypropylene suture to the annular gap produced by the limited posterior leaflet resection, without any further incision (Fig. 35-10). The fold-over advancement accomplishes the same goals as the traditional leaflet advancement. The small gap distance, created by the small area of resected flail segment, is eliminated and the height of the posterior leaflet is reduced. We have found the fold-over advancement to be extremely effective for small resections of the posterior leaflet in any position without the necessity of incising the leaflet off the annulus.

That being stated, many situations exist with true Barlow syndrome with elongation and elevation of almost the entire posterior leaflet. In essence, the whole posterior leaflet is elongated. In these particular pathologic situations, the classic techniques are necessary. The entire posterior leaflet on both sides of the resected area, including P1 and P3, must be incised

off the annulus and careful and detailed valve advancement carried out, beginning at each commissure, with running 4-0 polypropylene (see Fig. 35-9C and D). The height of the leaflet is lowered to avoid creation of SAM and provide a good coaptation point for the anterior leaflet. Because some of these leaflets may be as high as 3 to 4 cm, if the height of the leaflet is not shortened significantly, SAM is highly likely. While performing the leaflet advancement, imbrication of PML segment areas may also be effective if there is focal enlargement at a particular area of the leaflet. This simplifies the surgical technique, reduces operative time, and achieves the same result. Multiple interrupted mattress sutures may be used.

## Commissural Prolapse

As the most straightforward example of pathologic valve prolapse, chordal rupture or elongation at the anteriorlateral or

**FIGURE 35-11** Commissuroplasty. Simple horizontal mattress stitches placed in the ruptured commissure eliminate regurgitation without need for further leaflet resection, even with ruptured chordae.

posteriormedial commissure provides the surgeon with the most obvious strategy of repair. Many surgeons still recommend resection of this area, but commissuroplasty is by far the most simple, direct, and efficient way to handle this particular problem. The prolapsed area is obliterated by one to three polypropylene mattress stitches (Fig. 35-11), eliminating the regurgitation at that point. A small obliteration of this area at A1 and P1 or A3 and P3 will not make any significant difference in the overall cross-sectional area of the mitral valve, so mitral stenosis is of no concern with this technique. Several other reports 62,63 have also documented this technique as an effective and long-lasting method to treat commissural prolapse.

## **Anterior Leaflet Prolapse**

Though uncommon, true prolapse of the anterior leaflet engenders significant concern to surgeons because such pathology is associated with less successful long-term repair results than posterior leaflet pathology.<sup>64</sup> The height of the chordae underlying the anterior leaflet must be assessed and chords may be grossly elongated or ruptured and make the AML flail. This

problem may be addressed by a variety of techniques and the long-term follow-up on many of these techniques has been quite promising. There are four basic techniques to repair true prolapse of the anterior leaflet. They are (1) reduction of the chordal height by implantation techniques; (2) artificial PTFE chordae; (3) chordal transfer from the posterior to anterior leaflet; and (4) the edge-to-edge technique.

#### Resection of the Anterior Leaflet

It has been well established that the body of the anterior leaflet should be treated with great respect, and preservation of AML tissue is important. Resections can be carried out, but only as a small triangular resection for ruptured chords to reduce the bulk of a large anterior leaflet. For anterior mitral valve prolapse associated with idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis, or as an alternative technique for reduction of the AML height, creation of a longitudinal periannular anterior leaflet resection with reconstruction of the leaflet has also been advocated to reduce the height of the anterior leaflet with some success. Rel. 82,83

# Chordal Shortening by Implantation into Papillary Muscles

One of the first techniques developed by Carpentier<sup>10</sup> of chordal shortening involves incising the papillary muscle, placing the redundant anterior leaflet chords within the muscle, and then sewing the papillary muscle over the chord, thus entrapping the chordae and shortening it (Fig. 35-12). This is a simple technique, but it has gone out of favor, as reports by Cosgrove and coworkers<sup>65</sup> have demonstrated that additional chordal ruptures may occur after use of this technique. They postulate that the potential sawing action of the papillary muscle on the buried chord is the cause. Other techniques of this type include papillary muscle repositioning<sup>66</sup> and chordal plication and free-edge (AML) remodeling.<sup>67</sup>

#### **Chordal Transfer**

The third technique for true anterior prolapse is chordal transfer from the posterior leaflet to the anterior leaflet. This

**FIGURE 35-12** Anterior leaflet chordal shortening. The papillary muscle is incised and the redundant chord folded into it. The excess chord is held in place with pledgeted sutures.

was originally described by Carpentier<sup>10</sup> and has been popularized by the Cleveland Clinic<sup>65</sup> and Duran and coworkers.<sup>72</sup> Figure 35-13 illustrates the operative steps. A resection of the flail chordae of the anterior leaflet is carried out, and an adjacent segment of the posterior leaflet is then resected from the posterior leaflet and then transferred to the gap produced by the anterior leaflet resection. This technique has had reportedly good long-term results, but may involve both leaflets when only single leaflet pathology exists.<sup>73</sup>

### Edge-to-Edge Technique

The edge-to-edge repair is a technique in which the anterior leaflet and posterior leaflet are sewn together at the coaptation line, producing a double-orifice mitral valve.<sup>74</sup> This has gained considerable popularity and even percutaneous interventional attempts to emulate this surgical maneuver are being pursued.<sup>75</sup> Developed by Alfieri and coworkers,<sup>76</sup> their theory is that with Barlow syndrome or truly redundant anterior leaflets, apposition of the midportion of the anterior leaflet to the midportion of the posterior leaflet will prevent the elevation of the anterior leaflet above the level of the posterior leaflet, thus eliminating mitral regurgitation. This technique greatly simplifies the repair of the true bileaflet prolapse and has been adopted as standard therapy for AML pathology by several groups, especially in those patients with a high probability of postrepair SAM. In particular, with anterior leaflet chordal rupture or marked elongation of the chordae to the anterior leaflet, repair consists of a single stitch carefully

Figure 35-14 illustrates our technique. A figure-of-eight braided polyester suture is placed at the apposition points of the anterior and the posterior leaflet. We use this stronger suture, because there have been reports of the more commonly used polypropylene sutures rupturing. An important point of the surgical technique is our strong belief that the stitch should be placed only with myxomatous valves, so as to avoid producing mitral stenosis as has been the case with ischemic MR.<sup>77</sup> To ensure the adequacy of each orifice created by the edge-to-edge technique, we also measure the diameter of each orifice and confirm that it is at least 2 cm in diameter. If the orifices are less than 2 cm in diameter, the technique is abandoned. This technique is a very valuable adjunct in patients who have the potential for SAM of the mitral valve. 78,79 In fact, prevention of SAM may be the best utilization of this technique at present. In our small series of 20 patients with SAM potential, all were treated and SAM was prevented in all patients. A competent mitral valve was maintained in all at 8 years postoperatively without mitral stenosis.78

Medium-term results of this surgical maneuver are satisfactory and compatible with all other commonly used repair techniques, according to studies by Alfieri and coworkers, <sup>76,80</sup> but there have been no comparative, prospective, randomized studies comparing the classic repair techniques to this approach in the long term.

**FIGURE 35-13** Chordal transfer. For an isolated flail anterior leaflet segment, first the prolapsed section of anterior leaflet is resected. An adjoining section of posterior leaflet is then resected and transposed over to the gap created by the anterior resection.

#### **Artificial Chordae**

The mitral subvalvular apparatus is a sophisticated structure that couples intact mitral valve function with support of left ventricular function. Mitral valve replacement, naturally, eliminates this important and fine connection. The use of artificial chords during mitral valve repair procedures, while "respecting rather than resecting" the mitral leaflets tissue, has the potential of restoring mitral valve anatomy and function. The goal of performing a repair while using neochords is to eliminate any regurgitation get, while preserving both leaflets and keeping the mitral annular symmetry. The use of artificial chordae for mitral valve repair, dates back to the 1960s, and during the evolution of

![](_page_13_Picture_6.jpeg)

**FIGURE 35-14** Edge-to-edge technique. The technique involves a braided polyester figure-of-eight stitch at apposition of A2 and P2.

this technique, a number of materials were used as artificial chordae, including silk and nylon. Today, most, if not all surgeons, use expanded polytetraflouroethylene (ePTFE) chords, and this technique is perhaps the most popular current technique for AML pathology. Originally described by Frater and Zussa, <sup>68,69</sup> this technique has grown in popularity over the past several years. <sup>64,70</sup> Lawrie<sup>59</sup> has also recently reported excellent results in applying PTFE neochords for the anterior and posterior leaflet repair. Duran has devised a method for more precise measurement of the correct height for these new chordal structures. <sup>70</sup> This technique (Fig. 35-15) involves a number of technical steps to establish a path for successful repair.

- 1. Attachment to the papillary muscle
- 2. Attachment to the leaflet
- 3. Length adjustment
- 4. Tighing of the PTFE neochord, before or after insertion of an annuloplasty ring.

We usually place a mattress suture with a pledget on the papillary muscle to which the redundant or ruptured chord has been attached. The two ends of the double-armed PTFE are then brought up through the edge of the leaflet that needs to be lowered. The critical part of this technique is determining the degree to which the leaflet is lowered and hence how tightly the stitch is tied down. This is determined by ascertaining the optimal position of the two leaflets in systole. Both the anterior and posterior leaflets should be in apposition at this point, and thus the leaflet's height in systole should be the level to which the chords are adjusted. We have used tenting of the posterior leaflet as our guide while carefully tying down the chord (Fig. 35-15B). Other techniques describe using multiple loops (David technique), using a fixed length loop

technique using a caliper (von Oppell and Mohr), using a fixed length loop technique without using a caliper (Mandegar). Tam described a modification of the loop technique that involves only a single pass through the papillary muscle.

Whatever the technique employed, the end result should be that the anterior leaflet now coapts at the same level as the posterior leaflet with left ventricular contraction. Some surgeons advocate neo chordae, as opposed to leaflet resection, as the repair technique of choice for leaflet prolapse.<sup>61</sup>

Long-term histology results of neochord placement demonstrate that ePTFE neochords become covered with fibrous tissue as described by Bortolotti et al<sup>93</sup> This is consistent with our own experience demonstrated by Fig. 35-16.

## SPECIAL PROBLEMS AND CONSIDERATIONS

#### The Calcified Annulus

Calcification, particularly of the posterior annulus, is a complicating aspect of mitral valve repair. Calcification makes repair more difficult, as stitches are more difficult to place and the risk of paravalvular leak is increased. Severe annular calcification, however, does not necessarily rule out an effective mitral valve repair. Partial or total removal of the calcified

bar may be done safely. Carpentier has promulgated removal of the entire calcified bar in radical fashion, which in essence partially detaches the LV from the left atrium. A Partial and selective calcification removal may also be quite effective and potentially safer. Partial removal of calcium with leaflet advancement can be performed without the need for a radical debridement in many patients. Only the amount of calcium should be removed that allows adequate stitch placement and leaflet and annular flexibility. Obviously, calcification of the chordae or a substantial part of the leaflet tissue is a poor prognostic factor for long-term freedom from valve repair, and an extensively calcified valve usually indicates valve replacement.

## Systolic Anterior Motion of the Mitral Valve

As mentioned above, persistent SAM of the anterior leaflet is an adverse outcome after valve repair. In this condition, the anterior leaflet obstructs the LVOT. Clearly, increased redundancy of leaflet tissue is a risk factor with a small annuloplasty ring. After repair, if the line of leaflet coaptation is displaced anteriorly, then the anterior leaflet will be displaced into the LVOT and cause LVOT obstruction. 86,87 The etiology is usually inadequate reduction of the height of the posterior leaflet, which then pushes the anterior leaflet into the LVOT. SAM

![](_page_15_Figure_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 35-16** (A and B) Gross anatomy of an excised anterior mitral leaflet 3 years after neochordae implantation. (C) H&E stain of a neo chordae cross section. (D) Giemsa stain of the same cross section.

is particularly prevalent in patients with true bileaflet prolapse or those with extremely enlarged anterior leaflets. Thus, the PML height reduction has to be meticulously carried out, and in myxomatous valve disease, an upsizing rather than a downsizing of the mitral valve annuloplasty ring should be done. As indicated above, if the anterior leaflet is supported by a relatively small annulus, the anterior leaflet will not spread out and instead will appear to have redundant tissue above the correct plane of coaptation, predisposing to SAM.<sup>78</sup>

Several investigators have looked at the potential echocar-diographic risk factors for SAM. Echocardiographic details that are associated with a high risk of SAM include proximity of the mitral valve coaptation point to the interventricular septum, as well as asymmetry between the anterior and posterior leaflets. If the posterior leaflet is relatively large with respect to the anterior leaflet, then SAM is potentiated. If the medial portion of A2 is larger than the medial portion of A2, then SAM is also potentiated. We look for this information before surgery and take such data into account as the repair strategy is finalized in the operating room. <sup>78,79</sup>

If the probability is high that SAM will occur, our practice is to use the Alfieri edge-to-edge technique to reduce such a risk after lowering the height of the posterior leaflet. By forcing the coaptation line to be correct with a single stitch in the situation of high SAM probability, the probability of

SAM is reduced. Another strategy to consider in this circumstance is implantation of PTFE anterior chordae to lower the AML. That will reduce the height of the anterior leaflet, and thus further reduce the potential of SAM. In our own experience long-term competency is maintained in this group.

If SAM appears by TEE following what appears to be an excellent repair, filling the LV with fluid volume postcardio-pulmonary bypass will relieve SAM in approximately 90% of patients. In rare circumstances, if an adequate reduction of the posterior leaflet has not been carried out, more posterior leaflet may have to be resected or the ring size increased. The most common alternative in our clinic is the edge-to-edge technique, as mentioned above, for situations where postrepair SAM still exists despite all techniques to reduce it.<sup>78</sup>

## Remodeling Ring Annuloplasty

Remodeling the annulus by ring annuloplasty after mitral valve repair is essential to a complete and long-lasting repair. The remodeling concept, promulgated by Carpentier<sup>18</sup> and Duran<sup>54</sup> is that the distorted mitral annulus requires restorative structural support. There is debate on which type of ring should be used for remodeling: rigid or soft, complete or partial? It is probably not critical which type of ring is used for myxomatous valve degeneration as long as there is a relative

upsizing of the ring and a secure attachment to the trigone area of the anterior mitral leaflet. There is some evidence to suggest that flexible rings may incur less possibility of SAM and that partial rings are safer with respect to SAM.<sup>88</sup> As none of this has been studied in a prospective randomized fashion, these opinions will continue to exist. Though we prefer the Cosgrove ring for mitral valve prolapse, our belief based on over 2000 mitral valve repairs is that the existing evidence is not compelling for any particular ring, and that the type of ring implanted is far less important than a correctly performed operation and appropriate sizing of the ring.

The technical aspects of ring implantation are important to avoid circumflex artery compromise, atrioventricular dissociation, or dehiscence of the ring. Implantation of currently available annuloplasty rings requires the placement of mattress sutures, parallel to the annulus, at the junction of the posterior leaflet and the annulus. Radially oriented bites are to be avoided because by definition they exert radial stresses and thus will pull to some extent on the circumflex artery. Bites should be deep with the needle entering the annulus, then into the left ventricular cavity, and then coming out on the atrial side again. Of paramount importance is the requirement that the plane of the needle bite should be orthogonal to the annular plane. If this is done, it is impossible for the stitch to impinge or distort the circumflex artery. That is why such bites may be made deep. Wide bites are taken such that there is not an excess number of a suture. A partial mitral ring should require approximately 9 to 15 sutures depending on the size of the annulus. The sutures are not pledgeted unless there is extreme fragility of the annular structures. Annular

integrity will of course depend on the pathology. Sutures are then passed through the fabric part of the ring. The central stabilizer frame is kept in place to maintain the ring shape while the sutures are tied down, thus preventing crimping of the cloth rings in the nonrigid or semirigid rings.

In the past decades, more than 40 mitral valve annuloplasty rings of various shapes and consistency were marketed for MR, although the effect of ring type on clinical outcome remains unclear. Until demonstrated otherwise, surgeons may choose their ring upon their judgment, tailored to specific patient needs.

Sizing is the most important aspect of ring placement. We believe that slight oversizing of the ring in myxomatous degenerated disease is appropriate. This corrects for the degenerative annulus that is functionally too small. Sizing is typically done by two techniques. Placement of aortic trigonal stitches (Fig. 35-17) allows for measurement of the intertrigonal distance. Many ring-sizing devices have notches on the rings to facilitate this. Except in rheumatic disease, we do not rely on this measurement. In myxomatous disease, the height of the anterior leaflet from the annulus to the highest point on the leaflet when it is stretched is the most important criterion for sizing, a concept originally espoused by Carpentier. 10 This height of the leaflet is the critical dimension that must be carefully measured so that during systole there is minimal redundancy that may lead to SAM. Using trigonal sizing may, in fact, downsize the ring and cause either SAM or ring dehiscence because of the huge disparity between ring size and annulus size. In our re-repair series, either improved sizing or placing the ring below the commissures were the most common

![](_page_16_Picture_7.jpeg)

**FIGURE 35-17** Ring annuloplasty sizing and insertion. The ring for degenerative disease should be slightly oversized. Sizing should be done to match the height of the anterior leaflet, not the distance between the trigones or commissures. Nine to 11 mattress sutures are usually needed.

remedies. <sup>89</sup> Therefore, using the sizer to evaluate anterior leaflet size is the most critical maneuver. Echocardiographic dimensions of the anterior leaflet correlate well with in vivo sizing, and calculating the anterior leaflet size by standard echocardiogram techniques is performed in every case. Deployment of a ring matching the anterior leaflet size in our experience has been most efficacious and has rarely led to SAM. <sup>78</sup>

#### Results

Based on long-term studies, the probability of a durable mitral valve repair at 10 years is greater than 90%. 42,53,56,64,90 Thromboembolic incidence is also exceedingly low; long-term anticoagulation is not required unless patients are in atrial fibrillation. Recently, we reviewed our personal operative experience (LHC) over four decades of mitral valve surgery. This study has confirmed many commonly believed relationships between the etiology of MR and the durability of mitral valve repair. Etiology of regurgitation was noted to be the primary determinant of repair longevity and freedom from reoperation. Although repair of rheumatic disease was noted to ultimately require reoperation, myxomatous repair resulted in outstanding long-term freedom from recurrent MR and reoperation (Fig. 35-18).
