# Cardiovascular Pathology

Frederick J. Schoen • Robert F. Padera

Cardiovascular pathology defines the morphology and mechanisms of cardiovascular disease in individual patients and patient cohorts, both along the natural history of a disease and following surgery and interventions. The data derived through cardiovascular pathology thereby facilitate evidence-based choices among surgical or catheter-based interventional options and optimize short- and long-term patient management. Beyond implicit clinical benefit for individual patients, the discipline of cardiovascular pathology is a cornerstone of modern cardiovascular research and the preclinical development and clinical implementation of innovative drugs, devices, and other therapeutic options.

This chapter summarizes pathologic anatomy, clinicopathologic correlations, and pathophysiologic mechanisms in the various forms of structural heart disease most relevant to surgery and catheter-based interventions used to diagnose and treat the major forms of acquired structural cardiovascular disease. In view of space limitations, several important areas (eg, aortic disease) are necessarily omitted from discussion and others (eg, cardiac assist and replacement devices) are focused on details not covered elsewhere in this book. Moreover, although we have not included the key considerations herein, we are mindful that the number of adults with congenital heart disease is increasing rapidly and that they have unique and important clinical and pathologic concerns.<sup>1,2</sup>

#### MYOCARDIAL RESPONSE TO INCREASED WORK AND MYOCARDIAL DISEASE

## Myocardial Hypertrophy

Hypertrophy is the compensatory response of the cardiac muscle (the *myocardium*), to increased work (Fig. 5-1).<sup>3</sup> This structural and functional adaptation accompanies nearly all forms of heart disease, and its consequences often dominate the clinical picture. Hypertrophy induces an increase in the overall mass and size of the heart that reflects an increased size of individual myocytes largely through addition of contractile elements (the *sarcomeres*) and associated cell and

tissue elements. Substantial and functionally beneficial augmentation of myocyte number (*hyperplasia*) in response to stress or injury has not been demonstrated in the adult heart.

The pattern of hypertrophy reflects the nature of the stimulus (see Fig. 5-1B). Pressure overload (eg, in systemic hypertension or aortic stenosis) induces an increased ventricular mass, increased wall thickness, and increased ratio of wall thickness to cavity radius without dilation. In contrast, volume overload (eg, in aortic or mitral regurgitation, myocardial infarction, or dilated cardiomyopathy) promotes hypertrophy accompanied by chamber dilation, in which both ventricular radius and total mass are increased. The chamber wall is affected globally by the increased chamber pressure of hypertension, the pressure or volume overload of valvular heart disease, and in dilated cardiomyopathy. In contrast, the ischemic myocyte necrosis and loss of contractile tissue myocardial infarction induce hypertrophy only in noninfarcted regions of myocardium. The terms concentric, eccentric, and compensatory have previously been used to describe pressure, volume, and ischemic injury-related hypertrophy, respectively.

The constellation of changes that occur regionally following myocardial infarction, or more globally in pressure and volume overload, is called *ventricular remodeling*.<sup>4</sup> At a cell level, pressure overload promotes augmentation of cell width via parallel addition of sarcomeres; in contrast, volume overload and/or dilation stimulate augmentation of both cell width and length via both parallel and series addition of sarcomeres.

Hypertrophic changes initially increase the efficiency of the heart, enhance function, and are thereby adaptive. However, when these changes are excessive and prolonged, they may ultimately become deleterious and contribute to cardiac failure via several mechanisms. Because the vasculature does not proliferate and blood flow is not augmented commensurate with increased cardiac mass, hypertrophied myocardium is vulnerable to ischemic damage. Moreover, myocardial fibrous tissue is often increased. Also important are the molecular changes that accompany and likely mediate enhanced function in hypertrophied hearts, and which may subsequently

The wall of the left ventricle is thick and the chamber is not dilated. The left ventricle is on the lower right in this apical four-chamber view of the heart. (B) Altered cardiac configuration in left ventricular hypertrophy without and with dilation, viewed in transverse heart sections. Compared with a normal heart (center of this panel), a pressure overloaded heart, caused for example by aortic valve stenosis (left), has increased mass and a thick left ventricular wall, whereas a volume overloaded heart, caused for example by mitral valve regurgitation, is both hypertrophied and dilated (right), having increased mass with a near normal or diminished wall thickness.

promote development of heart failure. For example, hypertrophy induces a gene expression profile in cardiac myocytes that is similar to that of proliferating cells generally and particularly that of fetal cardiac myocytes during development. Differentially expressed proteins may be less functional and/or more or less abundant than normal. Hypertrophied and/or failing myocardium also may have a mechanical disadvantage engendered by altered chamber configuration, impaired energetics, reduced adrenergic responsiveness, decreased calcium availability, impaired mitochondrial function, microcirculatory spasm, and apoptosis of cardiac myocytes.

Novel therapeutic strategies for heart failure treatment based on molecular mechanisms are under investigation.<sup>5</sup>

Owing to the totality of the changes described above, cardiac hypertrophy comprises a tenuous balance. The adaptive changes may be overwhelmed by potentially deleterious quantitative or qualitative alterations in structure, function, and biochemistry/gene expression, including cardiac configuration, metabolic requirements of an enlarged muscle mass, protein synthesis, decreased capillary/myocyte ratio, fibrosis, microvascular spasm, cell loss, and impaired contractile mechanisms. Hypertrophy also decreases

myocardial compliance and may thereby hinder diastolic filling. In addition, hypertrophy is an independent risk factor for cardiac mortality and morbidity, especially sudden death.<sup>6</sup>

Heart failure can occur with pressure or volume overload of many causes, owing to both regional and global lesions (Fig. 5-2). Although left ventricular hypertrophy (as measured by left ventricular size and mass) regresses in many cases following removal of the stimulus, the extent of resolution in an individual is unpredictable, and the processes by which recovery of the hypertrophied or failing heart (often termed reverse remodeling occur) are uncertain. Moreover, progressive cardiac failure may ensue following cardiac surgery and despite revascularization or hemodynamic adjustment, by structural repair (see Fig. 5-2B). In addition, the markedly increased cardiac muscle mass in a hypertrophied heart may compromise intraoperative myocardial preservation.

## Cardiomyopathies

Cardiomyopathies are diseases in which the primary cardiovascular abnormality is in the myocardium. A primary cardiomyopathy comprises a condition solely or predominantly confined to heart muscle, whereas a secondary cardiomyopathy (often called specific heart muscle disease) implies myocardial involvement as a feature of a generalized systemic or multisystem disorder, such as amyloidosis and hemochromatosis, other infiltrative and storage diseases, drug and other toxic reactions, sarcoidosis, various autoimmune and collagen vascular diseases, or neuromuscular/neurologic disorders (eg, Duchenne-Becker muscular dystrophy). Genetic causes of primary cardiomyopathy include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), left ventricular noncompaction, the ion channel disorders (eg, long QT and Brugada syndromes), and some cases of dilated cardiomyopathy.8 Acquired causes include myocarditis (inflammatory cardiomyopathy), and stress-provoked (takotsubo), tachycardia-induced, and peripartum cardiomyopathy. Although ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, and hypertensive heart disease can lead to a clinical practice resembling dilated cardiomyopathy, the terms ischemic cardiomyopathy, valvular cardiomyopathy, and hypertensive cardiomyopathy are discouraged because these conditions more likely reflect compensatory and remodeling changes induced by another cardiovascular abnormality. In contrast to the atherosclerotic coronary arterial disease that underlies most cases of ischemic heart disease, the epicardial coronary arteries are usually free of significant obstructions in patients with a cardiomyopathy.

In some cases (eg, myocarditis, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, and hemochromatosis) the cause of a cardiomyopathy may be revealed by light and/or electron microscopic examination of a sample of myocardium obtained by endomyocardial biopsy, and other conditions such as ARVC and HCM have characteristic gross and microscopic features demonstrated at the time of transplantation or autopsy (but not generally by endomyocardial biopsy). In endomyocardial biopsy, also used in the management of the ongoing surveillance of cardiac transplant recipients, a bioptome is inserted into either the right internal jugular or femoral vein and advanced under fluoroscopic or echocardiographic guidance through the tricuspid valve, to the apical aspect of the right side of the ventricular septum, yielding 1- to 3-mm fragments of myocardium.

The common variants of cardiomyopathy are illustrated in Fig. 5-3.

## **Dilated Cardiomyopathy**

Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by cardiomegaly usually two to three times of normal weight, and four-chamber dilation (see Fig. 5-3A). The primary functional abnormality in dilated cardiomyopathy is impairment of left ventricular systolic function. Mural thrombi are sometimes

present predominantly in the left ventricle, and are a potential source of thromboemboli. The histologic changes in dilated cardiomyopathy, comprising myocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis, are nonspecific and indistinguishable from those in failing muscle in ischemic or valvular heart disease (see Fig. 5-3B). Moreover, the severity of the morphologic changes does not necessarily correlate with the severity of dysfunction or the patient's prognosis.

Dilated cardiomyopathy has a genetic and often familial basis in approximately 25 to 50% of cases, and our knowledge of the relevant molecular biology is increasing rapidly. 10

Mutations most commonly involve genes encoding proteins of the cardiac myocyte cytoskeleton and sarcomere. Alcoholism, pregnancy-associated nutritional deficiency, and myocarditis can yield a dilated phenotype.<sup>11</sup>

## Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is characterized macroscopically by massive myocardial hypertrophy, usually without dilation (see Fig. 5-3C), and often with disproportionate thickening of the ventricular septum relative to the free wall

of the left ventricle (ratio > 1.3) (termed asymmetric septal hypertrophy). In some patients, the basal septum is markedly thickened at the level of the mitral valve, and the outflow of the left ventricle may be narrowed during systole, yielding dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. In such cases, contact between the left ventricular outflow tract and the anterior mitral leaflet during ventricular systole (observed by echocardiography as systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve) results in outflow tract endocardial thickening, in a configuration that mirrors the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve (see Fig. 5-3D). The most important microscopic features in HCM include (1) disorganized myocytes and contractile elements within cells (myofiber disarray); (2) extreme myocyte hypertrophy, with myocyte diameters frequently more than 40 µm (normal approximately 15 to 20 µm); and (3) interstitial and replacement fibrosis (see Fig. 5-3F).

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy usually has a genetic basis.  $^{12}$  In many patients the disease is familial; remaining cases are sporadic. Over 1500 mutations have been identified in at least 11 genes; almost all occur in genes for sarcomeric proteins, most commonly  $\beta$ -myosin heavy chain and myosin-binding protein C. Occasional cases mimicking HCM are a result of deposition (eg, Fabry's disease).

The clinical course of HCM is variable. Complications include atrial fibrillation with potential mural thrombus formation and embolization, infective endocarditis of the mitral valve, intractable cardiac failure, and sudden death. End-stage heart failure can be accompanied by cardiac dilation. Sudden death is common, with risk related to the degree of hypertrophy and specific gene mutations. Reduced stroke volume results from decreased diastolic filling of the massively hypertrophied left ventricle. Patients with left ventricular obstruction may benefit from septal reduction by surgical myotomy/ myectomy or chemical ablation.<sup>13</sup>

## Restrictive Cardiomyopathy

Restrictive cardiomyopathy comprises a pathophysiologically heterogeneous spectrum of conditions characterized by heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and previously called *diastolic dysfunction*; many of the potential causes are functional and are potentiated by aging, obesity, and hypertension. Biatrial dilation may be prominent. Structural disorders that interfere with ventricular filling can cause restrictive cardiomyopathy physiology (eg, eosinophilic endomyocardial disease, amyloidosis, storage diseases such as Fabry's disease, or postirradiation fibrosis, constrictive pericarditis, and HCM). Distinct morphologic patterns may be revealed by endomyocardial biopsy.

# Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy is characterized by a dilated right ventricular chamber and severely thinned right ventricular wall, with extensive fatty infiltration,

loss of myocytes with compensatory myocyte hypertrophy, and interstitial fibrosis (see Fig. 5-3G-H). <sup>15</sup> Clinical features include right-sided heart failure and arrhythmias. Arrhythmias are often brought on by exertion, and this condition is associated with sudden death in athletes. ARVC may be associated with mutations in several genes involved in cell-cell adhesion and in intracellular signaling.

## CORONARY ARTERY AND ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE

Myocardial ischemia occurs when perfusion via coronary flow is inadequate to meet metabolic needs, thus interfering with both the cellular delivery of oxygen and nutrients to cardiac myocytes, and the removal of waste products. Myocardial ischemia most often results from obstruction or narrowing of a coronary artery secondary to atherosclerosis. Nonatherosclerotic epicardial coronary artery obstructions can also occur in autoimmune diseases (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis), progressive systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), vasculitis (eg, Buerger disease and Kawasaki disease), fibromuscular dysplasia, and as a result of dissection, spasm, embolism, or some drugs such as cocaine. Obstruction of small intramural coronary arteries occurs in diabetes, Fabry's disease, and amyloidosis, and in cardiac allografts (see later). Decreased coronary flow leading to global hypoperfusion and myocardial ischemia can occur during cardiopulmonary bypass. Ischemia can also result from increased cardiac demand secondary to exercise, tachycardia, hyperthyroidism, or ventricular hypertrophy and/ or dilation. Moreover, the effects of ischemia are potentiated when oxygen supply is decreased secondary to anemia, hypoxia, or cardiac failure.

#### **Atherosclerosis**

Atherosclerosis is a chronic, progressive, multifocal disease of the vessel wall, beginning in the intima, whose characteristic lesion is the atheroma or plaque that forms through intimal thickening (mediated predominantly by smooth muscle cell proliferation and matrix production) and lipid accumulation (mediated primarily by insudation of lipid into the arterial wall). 16 Atherosclerosis primarily affects the large elastic arteries and large- and medium-sized muscular arteries of the systemic circulation, particularly near branches, sharp curvatures, and bifurcations. Coronary arterial atherosclerosis involves especially the epicardial branches of the left anterior descending (LAD) and circumflex arteries, and the right coronary diffusely, but generally not their intramural branches. Most atheromas in the coronary arteries are segmental and eccentric, with plaque-free segments longitudinally and circumferentially. In early lesions, the plaque bulges outward at the expense of the media with the arterial lumen remaining circular in cross-section at essentially the same original diameter (ie, the vessel wall outer diameter enlarges, a process termed vascular remodeling).17

Although veins are usually spared from atherosclerosis, venous grafts interposed within branches of the arterial system (such as aorto-coronary bypass grafts created from saphenous vein) frequently develop intimal thickening and ultimately atherosclerosis, with obstructions or aneurysms. Paradoxically, some arteries used as arterial grafts, including the internal mammary artery (IMA), are largely spared.

## **Pathogenesis**

The prevailing theory of lesion formation in atherosclerosis centers on interactions among arterial wall endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, circulating monocytes, platelets, and plasma lipoproteins. A key contributor to atherosclerosis is endothelial cell injury induced by chronic hypercholesterolemia, homocystinemia, chemicals in cigarette smoke, viruses, localized hemodynamic forces, systemic hypertension, hyperglycemia, or the local effects of cytokines. These factors cause phenotypic and hence functional changes in endothelial cells, called *endothelial dysfunction*. <sup>18</sup> Endothelial dysfunction causes (1) vasoconstriction owing to decreased production of the vasodilator nitric oxide; (2) increased permeability to lipoproteins; (3) expression of tissue factor leading to thrombosis; and (4) expression of certain injuryinduced adhesion molecules leading to adherence of platelets and inflammatory cells.

Progression from an early, subendothelial lesion (called a fatty streak) to a complex atheromatous plaque involves the following processes: (1) monocytes adhere to endothelial cells, migrate into the subendothelial space, and transform into tissue macrophages; (2) smooth muscle cells migrate from the media into the intima, proliferate, and secrete collagen and other extracellular matrix (ECM) constituents; (3) lipids accumulate via phagocytosis in macrophages (forming foam cells) and smooth muscle cells, as well as extracellularly; (4) lipoproteins are oxidized in the vessel wall leading to generation of potent biologic stimuli such as chemoattractants and cytotoxins; (5) persistent chronic inflammation; (6) cellular necrosis with release of intracellular lipids (mostly cholesterol esters); and often (7) calcification. Mature atherosclerotic plaques consist of a central core of lipid, cholesterol crystals, macrophages, smooth muscle cells, foam cells, and lymphocytes along with necrotic debris, separated from the lumen by a fibrous cap rich in collagen.

Clinical manifestations of advanced coronary arterial atherosclerosis occur through encroachment of the lumen leading to progressive stenosis, or to acute plaque disruption with thrombosis (see the following). In the absence of significant coronary blockages, myocardial perfusion is adequate at rest, and compensatory vasodilation provides flow reserve that is more than sufficient to accommodate increased metabolic demand during vigorous exertion. When the coronary luminal cross-sectional area is decreased by approximately 75%, blood flow becomes limited during exertion; with 90% reduction, coronary flow may be inadequate at rest. However, occlusions that develop slowly may stimulate the formation of collateral vessels that protect against distal myocardial ischemia. Aneurysms may form secondary to atherosclerosis as a result

of destruction of the media beneath a plaque, a process most common in the aorta and other large vessels (where plaque does not easily cause obstruction). The natural history, morphologic features, key pathogenetic events, and clinical complications of atherosclerosis are summarized in Figs. 5-4 and 5-5.

## Role of Acute Plaque Change

The onset and prognosis of ischemic heart disease are not well predicted by the angiographically determined extent and severity of luminal obstructions. <sup>19</sup> The conversion of chronic stable angina or an asymptomatic state to an *acute coronary syndrome* (ie, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and sudden coronary death) is dependent on dynamic vascular

![](_page_7_Figure_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 5-5** Schematic diagram summarizing the morphology, pathogenesis, and complications of atherosclerosis. Plaques usually develop slowly and insidiously over many years, beginning in childhood or shortly thereafter and exerting clinical effect in middle age or later. As described in the text, lesions may progress from a fatty streak to a fibrous plaque and then to plaque complications that lead to disease. ECM = extracellular matrix; SMC = smooth muscle cell.

changes, such as fracture or rupture of the fibrous cap, exposing deep plaque constituents, and subsequent thrombus, wither occlusive, or partial, sometimes with emboli. Less commonly, the change is erosion and/or ulceration of the fibrous cap, setting the stage for platelet aggregation and mural or total thrombosis.

Plaques having a high propensity to rupture are known as *vulnerable plaques*. Such lesions (1) have a thin collagenous fibrous cap and few smooth muscle cells (the cells that produce collagenous matrix); (2) contain many macrophages producing matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) (enzymes that degrade the collagen that ordinarily lends strength to the fibrous cap); and (3) contain large areas of foam cells, extracellular lipid and necrotic debris. Inflammation may contribute to coronary thrombosis by altering the balance between prothrombotic and fibrinolytic properties of the endothelium. There is evidence that lipid lowering by diet or drugs such as statins (HMG CoA reductase inhibitors) reduces accumulation of macrophages expressing matrix-degrading enzymes and thereby stabilizes plaque by increasing the thickness and strength of the fibrous cap.<sup>20</sup>

Vulnerable plaques without significant obstruction can be clinically important. Indeed, pathologic and clinical studies show that plaques that rupture and lead to coronary occlusion often produced only mild to moderate luminal stenosis (and often no symptoms) prior to acute plaque change. Thus, there is great interest in identifying vulnerable plaques in individuals at a potentially therapeutic stage. Calcification of the coronary arteries detected noninvasively by electron beam computed tomography predicts the extent

of atherosclerotic disease overall but does not predict plaque instability. The most relevant features of plaque structure can be evaluated using intravascular ultrasound, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and potentially noninvasive molecular imaging.<sup>21</sup>

The events that trigger abrupt changes in plaque configuration and superimposed thrombosis and the efficacy and safety of interventional therapies depend on influences both intrinsic (eg, structure and composition, as described above) and extrinsic (eg, blood pressure, vasospasm, and platelet reactivity) to the plaque.<sup>22,23</sup> Potential outcomes for ruptured plaques include progression to thrombotic occlusion, non-occlusive thrombosis, healing at the site of plaque erosion, atheroembolization or thromboembolization, organization of mural thrombus causing (plaque progression), and organization of the occlusive mass with recanalization.

The clinical manifestations of ischemic heart disease most frequently reflect the downstream effects of a complex and dynamic interaction among fixed atherosclerotic narrowing of the epicardial coronary arteries, plaque vulnerability, intraluminal thrombosis overlying a ruptured or fissured atherosclerotic plaque, platelet aggregation, vasospasm, and the responses of the myocardium to ischemia.

# Progression of Ischemic Myocardial Injury

The changes in the myocardium following the onset of myocardial ischemia are sequential and the cellular consequences are primarily determined by the severity and duration of

flow deprivation (Table 5-1). Within seconds of onset, ischemia induces a transition from aerobic metabolism to anaerobic glycolysis in cardiac myocytes, leading to inadequate production of high-energy phosphates such as ATP, and the accumulation of metabolites such as lactic acid, causing intracellular acidosis. Myocardial function is exquisitely sensitive to these biochemical consequences, with total loss of contraction within 2 minutes in severe ischemia. Nevertheless, ischemic changes in an individual cell are not immediately lethal, and short duration injury is potentially reversible. Irreversible injury of cardiac myocytes marked

by cell membrane structural defects occurs only after 20 to 40 minutes within the most severely ischemic area (Fig. 5-6). Lethal injury to clusters of cells owing to severe prolonged ischemia causes *myocardial infarction*.

Within the region of myocardium vulnerable to die if ischemia is not relieved in a timely manner (termed the area at risk), loss of perfusion is not uniform and not all cells in the area at risk are equally affected. The most severely affected myocytes, and therefore the first to become necrotic, reside in the subendocardium and in the papillary muscles furthest from lateral regions of noncompromised circulation and adequate perfusion. Thus, if uninterrupted ischemia progresses, there is a wavefront of cell death outward from the mid-subendocardial region, eventually encompassing the lateral borders and less severely ischemic subepicardial and peripheral regions of the area at risk. In myocardial infarction, approximately 50% of the area at risk becomes necrotic in approximately 3 to 4 hours. The final transmural extent of an infarct is generally established within 6 to 12 hours. The key principle is that if perfusion is restored prior to the onset of irreversible changes, cell death can be prevented. Thus, restoration of flow to a severely ischemic area via therapeutic intervention (such as percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] with stent placement) can alter the outcome, depending on the interval between the onset of ischemia and restoration of blood flow (reperfusion).<sup>24</sup>

Necrosis existing less than 6 or more hours before patient death is not visible by routine gross or microscopic pathologic analysis of a cardiac specimen at autopsy. However, in a patient who died at least 2 to 3 hours following the onset of gross infarction, the presence of a necrotic region may be detected as a staining defect with triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC), a dye that turns viable myocardium a brick-red color on reaction of the dye with intact myocardial dehydrogenases. <sup>25</sup> The earliest observable microscopic features of infarction are intense eosinophilia, nuclear pyknosis, and loss of myocytes in clusters; some may be stretched and wavy. Short-term ischemia

without necrosis cannot be reliably demonstrated by pathologic examination.

Tissue repair following myocardial infarction. The inflammation and repair sequence in response to myocardial cell death follows a largely stereotyped sequence similar to tissue repair following injury at extracardiac sites. The inflammatory reaction is characterized by early exudation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, seen after 6 to 12 hours and maximal within 1 to 3 days. Subsequently (3 to 5 days), the infiltrate consists predominantly of macrophages that remove the necrotic tissue. Collagen production accompanied by neovascularization begins approximately 7 to 10 days at the margins of preserved tissue. The gross appearance reflects the progressive microscopic changes described above (Fig. 5-7). Ultimately, the infarcted tissue is replaced by dense collagenous scar, which is fully mature by about 6 to 8 weeks. Healing of myocardial infarction may be altered by reperfusion (see the following), mechanical stress, sex, and neurohumoral and other factors such as immunosuppressive drugs.<sup>26</sup>

Although cardiac myocytes are traditionally thought incapable of regeneration, a growing body of evidence suggests

![](_page_9_Picture_5.jpeg)

![](_page_9_Picture_6.jpeg)

**FIGURE 5-7** Gross photos of healing myocardial infarcts (A) approximately 3 to 4 days, (B) approximately 2 weeks. Asterisk highlights area of damage in each case.

that regeneration of cardiac myocytes can occur under certain circumstances, including at the viable borders of myocardial infarcts.<sup>27</sup> Whether this capacity for renewal can be harnessed to therapeutic advantage is not yet known (discussed later in this chapter).

### **Effects of Reperfusion**

Reperfusion of an ischemic zone occurring before the onset of irreversible injury (recall, approximately 20 to 30 minutes) prevents infarction. Reperfusion later (ie, following some cell death) may limit infarct size through salvage of myocytes located outside the leading edge of the "wavefront," provided that these myocytes are only reversibly injured at the time reperfusion occurs.<sup>28</sup> Thus, the potential for recovery of viable tissue decreases with increasing severity and duration of ischemia (see Fig. 5-6). Owing to the typical progression of ischemic injury, reperfusion 3 to 4 hours following onset of ischemia is considered the practical limit for significant myocardial salvage, and 90 minutes ("door to balloon time") is the present clinical goal in PCI.<sup>29</sup>

Reperfused previously ischemic myocardium often has hemorrhage (owing to microvascular damage; see the following) and necrotic myocytes with transverse eosinophilic lines (called contraction bands) that represent hypercontracted sarcomeres (Fig. 5-8) caused by ischemic cell membrane damage followed by a massive cellular influx of calcium derived from the restored blood flow. Microvascular occlusions (resulting from endothelial or interstitial edema and/or plugging by platelet or neutrophil aggregates) may inhibit the reperfusion of damaged regions (no-reflow phenomenon). 30 Moreover, reperfusion itself may damage some of the ischemic but still viable myocytes that were not irreversibly injured (called reperfusion injury), and arrhythmias may occur.<sup>31</sup> In reperfusion after severe global ischemia (eg, during cardiac surgery), the left ventricle may undergo a massive tetanic contraction (stone heart syndrome).32

## MYOCARDIAL STUNNING, HIBERNATION, AND PRECONDITIONING

Although reperfusion may salvage ischemic but not necrotic myocardium, metabolic and functional recovery is usually not instantaneous; indeed, reversible postischemic myocardial dysfunction (called *myocardial stunning*) may persist for hours to days following brief periods of ischemia.<sup>33</sup> Myocardial stunning may also occur in the setting of PCI, cardiopulmonary bypass, or ischemia related to unstable angina or stress.

Regions of viable myocardium with chronically reduced coronary blood flow may have impaired function (termed *hibernating myocardium*).<sup>34,35</sup> Myocardial hibernation is characterized by (1) persistent wall motion abnormality, (2) low myocardial blood flow, and (3) evidence of viability in at least some of the affected areas. Contractile function of hibernating myocardium can improve if blood flow returns toward normal or if oxygen demand is reduced. Correction of this abnormality is likely responsible for the reversal of long-standing defects in ventricular wall motion observed following coronary bypass graft surgery or PCI. Morphologically,

sublethal chronic ischemic injury often manifests as myocyte vacuolization, particularly in the subendocardium.<sup>36</sup>

Adaptation to short-term transient ischemia (ie, duration insufficient to cause cell death) may induce tolerance against subsequent, more severe ischemic insults (*ischemic preconditioning*).<sup>37</sup> Thus, short (eg, 5-minute) periods of cardiac ischemia followed by reperfusion can protect myocardium against injury during a prolonged period of subsequent ischemia. Understanding the yet uncertain mechanisms of this protection could lead to targets for "preemptive" pharmacologic stimulation of these pathways.

## Myocardial Infarction and Its Complications

Coronary atherosclerosis with acute plaque rupture and superimposed thrombosis often results in a *transmural* (Q-wave)

myocardial infarct, in which ischemic necrosis involves at least half and usually a nearly full thickness of the ventricular wall in the distribution of the involved artery. In contrast, a *subendocardial* (nontransmural, non–Q-wave) infarct constitutes an area of ischemic necrosis that is limited to the inner third to half of the ventricular wall, which can occur in the setting of episodic hypotension, global ischemia, or hypoxemia, or from interruption by reperfusion of the evolution of a transmural infarct. Subendocardial infarction associated with diffuse stenosing coronary atherosclerosis can be multifocal, extending laterally beyond the perfusion territory of a single coronary artery.

The short-term in-hospital mortality rate from acute myocardial infarction has declined from nearly 30% in the 1950s and 1960s to 7% or less today, especially for patients who receive aggressive reperfusion/revascularization and pharmacologic therapy.<sup>38</sup> However, half of all deaths from myocardial infarction occur within the first hour after the onset of symptoms, potentially before a victim can reach the hospital. Poor prognostic factors include advanced age, female sex, diabetes mellitus, and a previous myocardial infarction. Left ventricular function and the extent of obstructive lesions in vessels perfusing viable myocardium are the most important prognostic factors.

Important complications of myocardial infarction include ventricular dysfunction, cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, cardiac rupture, infarct extension and expansion, papillary muscle dysfunction, right ventricular involvement, ventricular aneurysm, pericarditis, and systemic arterial embolism; the cardiac rupture syndromes and ventricular aneurysm are illustrated in Fig. 5-9. Outcome after myocardial infarction depends on infarct size, location, and transmurality. Patients with transmural anterior infarcts are at greatest risk for regional dilation and mural thrombi and have a worse clinical

course than those with inferior-posterior infarcts. In contrast, inferior-posterior infarcts are more likely to have serious conduction blocks and right ventricular involvement.

Myocardial infarcts produce functional abnormalities approximately proportional to their size. Large infarcts have a higher probability of cardiogenic shock and congestive heart failure. Nonfunctional scar tissue resulting from previous infarcts and areas of stunned or hibernating myocardium may also contribute to overall ventricular dysfunction. Cardiogenic shock following myocardial infarction generally indicates a large infarct (often > 40% of the left ventricle). The high mortality of myocardial dysfunction and cardiogenic shock has been alleviated somewhat by the use of ventricular assist devices (VADs) to bridge patients through phases of prolonged reversible ischemic dysfunction.

Although many patients have cardiac rhythm abnormalities following myocardial infarction, the conduction system is involved by necrosis or inflammation only in a minority, and heart block following myocardial infarction usually is transient. Tachyarrhythmias usually originate owing to electrically unstable ischemic or necrotic myocardium, often at the edge of an infarct. However, autopsy studies of sudden death victims and clinical studies of resuscitated survivors of cardiac arrest show that only a minority of patients with ischemia-induced malignant ventricular arrhythmias develop a full-blown acute myocardial infarction.

Cardiac rupture syndromes comprise three entities (see Fig. 5-9A-C): (1) rupture of the ventricular free wall (most common), usually with hemopericardium and cardiac tamponade; (2) rupture of the ventricular septum (less common), leading to an acquired ventricular septal defect with a left-to-right shunt; and (3) papillary muscle rupture (least common), resulting in the acute onset of severe mitral regurgitation. Ruptures tend to occur relatively early following infarction with as many as 25% presenting within 24 hours (mean interval 4 to 5 days), most commonly through the lateral free wall. Acute free wall ruptures usually are rapidly fatal; repair is rarely possible.<sup>39</sup> Rarely, a rupture is contained as a hematoma communicating with the ventricular cavity (false aneurysm); this is an unstable situation and the false aneurysm may eventually rupture.

Postinfarction septal ruptures with acute ventricular septal defect are of two types: (1) single or multiple sharply localized, jagged, linear passageways that connect the ventricular chambers (simple type), usually involving the anteroapical aspect of the septum; and (2) defects that tunnel serpiginously through the septum to a somewhat distant opening on the right side (complex type), usually involving the basal inferoseptal wall.<sup>40</sup> In complex lesions, the tract may extend into regions remote from the site of the infarct, such as the right ventricular free wall. Without surgery, the prognosis is poor for patients with infarct-related ventricular septal defects.

Papillary muscles are particularly vulnerable to ischemic injury and rupture, particularly the posterior medial papillary muscle, and rupture can occur later than other rupture syndromes (as late as 1 month after myocardial infarction). Because tendinous cords arise from the heads of the papillary

muscles and cords from each are distributed to both valve leaflets, interference with the structure or function of either papillary muscle can result in dysfunction of both mitral valve leaflets and resultant mitral regurgitation (see later).

Isolated right ventricular infarction and involvement of the right ventricle by extension of a posteroseptal infarct can have important functional consequences, including right ventricular failure with or without tricuspid regurgitation and arrhythmias.

Infarct *extension* is characterized by incremental new or recurrent necrosis in the same distribution as a completed recent infarct. Extension most often occurs along the lateral and subepicardial borders of a recent infarct, and histologically appears younger than the previously necrotic myocardium. In contrast, infarct *expansion* is a disproportionate thinning and dilation of the infarcted region which does not lead to additional necrotic myocardium per se, but may promote both further ischemia and intracardiac mural thrombus formation. The increase in ventricular volume caused by regional dilation increases the wall stress and thereby the workload of noninfarcted myocardium. Infarct expansion is often the substrate for late aneurysm formation and increases morbidity and mortality.

Ventricular aneurysms are large scars that paradoxically bulge during ventricular systole and often result from healing of a large transmural infarct that undergoes expansion (see Fig. 5-9D). Although frequently as thin as 1 mm, ventricular aneurysms rarely rupture owing to their walls of tough fibrous or fibrocalcific tissue. Hypertrophied myocardial remnants as well as necrotic but inadequately healed myocardium often are present in aneurysm walls and mural thrombus is common.

Ventricular remodeling comprises the collective structural changes that occur in both the necrotic zone and uninvolved areas of the heart, including left ventricular dilation, wall thinning by infarct expansion, compensatory hypertrophy of noninfarcted myocardium, and potentially late aneurysm formation. <sup>42</sup> Congestive heart failure secondary to coronary artery disease (CAD) occurs when the overall function of viable myocardium can no longer maintain an adequate cardiac output or regions of hyperfunctioning residual myocardium suffer additional ischemic episodes.

#### Revascularization

Revascularization early after acute myocardial infarction is rationalized as follows: (1) prolonged thrombotic occlusion of a coronary artery causes transmural infarction; (2) the extent of necrosis during an evolving myocardial infarction progresses as a wavefront and becomes complete only 6 to 12 hours or more following coronary occlusion (see Fig. 5-6); (3) both early- and long-term mortality following acute myocardial infarction correlate strongly with the amount of residual functioning myocardium; and (4) early reperfusion rescues some jeopardized myocardium.<sup>43</sup> Thus, the benefits of revascularization depend on and are assessed by the amount of myocardium salvaged, recovery of left ventricular function, and resultant reduction in mortality. These clinical end points are largely determined by the time interval between onset of symptoms and successful reflow, and the degree of residual

stenosis of the infarct vessel. Spontaneous recanalization via endogenous thrombolysis can be beneficial to left ventricular function but occurs in only a small percentage of patients within the critical interval.

### Percutaneous Coronary Intervention

Percutaneous coronary intervention can restore blood flow through a diseased portion of the coronary circulation obstructed by atherosclerotic plaque and/or thrombotic deposits, and in obstructions in saphenous vein grafts, IMA grafts, and occasionally, coronary arteries in transplanted hearts.

## PERCUTANEOUS TRANSLUMINAL CORONARY ANGIOPLASTY

In percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), the plaque splits at its weakest point and enlargement of the lumen occurs by plaque fracture (the predominant mechanism); and by embolization, compression, redistribution of the plaque contents, and overall mechanical expansion of the vessel wall can also occur. 44 The split extends to the intimal-medial border and often into the media, is accompanied by variable circumferential and longitudinal medial dissection, and can induce a flap that impinges on the lumen. These changes can result in local flow abnormalities and generation of new, thrombogenic blood-contacting surfaces (to some extent similar to what is observed with spontaneously disrupted plaque) and contribute to the propensity for acute thrombotic closure.

The long-term success of PTCA is limited by the development of progressive restenosis, which occurs in 30 to 50% of patients, most frequently within the first 4 to 6 months. 45 Although vessel wall recoil and organization of thrombus likely contribute, the major process leading to restenosis is excessive medial smooth muscle migration to the intima, proliferation, and secretion of abundant ECM as a response to angioplasty-induced injury.

Although not widely used today, coronary atherectomy of primary or restenosis lesions mechanically can remove obstructive tissue by excision. 46 Deep arterial resection, including medial and even adventitial elements, occurs frequently but has not been associated with acute symptomatic complications. The morphology of arterial vessel healing after directional or rotational atherectomy is similar to that following angioplasty.

#### **STENTS**

Stents are expandable tubes of metallic or polymeric mesh that are used to split open the vessel wall at the site of balloon angioplasty and thereby mitigate the negative sequelae of PTCA.<sup>47</sup> Stents preserve luminal patency and provide a larger and more regular lumen by acting as a scaffold to support the disrupted vascular wall and minimize flow disruption and thrombus formation. Placement of a stent yields outcomes superior to angioplasty alone in vessels greater than 3 mm in diameter, chronic total occlusions, stenotic vein grafts, restenotic lesions after angioplasty alone, and in patients with myocardial infarction.<sup>48</sup>

Stent technology has undergone a rapid evolution, including sequentially: (1) bare-metal stents (BMS); and (2) drug-eluting stents (DES), both used extensively in clinical interventional cardiology; and more recently (3) completely resorbable/biodegradable stents (RBS). Bare-metal stents for coronary implantation are short tubular segments of metal mesh composed of balloon-expandable 316L stainless steel or nickel-titanium alloy (Nitinol) that range from approximately 2.5 to 3.5 mm in diameter and approximately 1 to 3 cm in length. Development has focused on permitting stents to become more flexible and more easily delivered and deployed, allowing the treatment of a greater number and variety of lesions.

Key stent complications are thrombosis, usually occurring early, and late proliferative restenosis (Fig. 5-10). Thrombotic occlusion, occurring in 1 to 3% of patients within 7 to 10 days of the procedure (see Fig. 5-10A), has largely been overcome by aggressive multidrug treatment with antiplatelet agents such as clopidogrel, aspirin, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. The major long-term complication of bare-metal stenting is in-stent restenosis, which occurs in 50% of patients within 6 months. 49 The causes of stent thrombosis and restenosis are complex and are largely owing to stent-tissue interactions, damage to the endothelial lining, and stretching of the vessel wall, which stimulate inflammation and adherence and accumulation of platelets and fibrin.<sup>50</sup> Stent wires may eventually become completely embedded in an endothelium-lined intimal fibrosis layer composed of smooth muscle cells in a collagen matrix (see Fig. 5-10B). This tissue may thicken secondary to the release of growth factors, chemotactic factors, and inflammatory mediators from platelets and other inflammatory cells that result in proliferation of smooth muscle cells and increased production of ECM molecules, narrowing the lumen and resulting in restenosis.

Drug-eluting stents, which impart the controlled release of drugs from durable polymers to the vessel wall, effectively inhibit in-stent restenosis. 51,52 The drugs used most widely are rapamycin (sirolimus)<sup>53</sup> and paclitaxel<sup>54</sup> in the Cypher (Cordis) and Taxus (Boston Scientific) stents, respectively. Rapamycin, a drug used for immunosuppression in solid organ transplant recipients, inhibits proliferation, migration, and growth of smooth muscle cells and ECM synthesis. Paclitaxel, a drug used in the chemotherapeutic regimens for several types of cancer, also has similar anti-smooth muscle cell activities. These drugs are embedded in a polymer matrix (such as a copolymer of poly-n-butyl methacrylate and polyethylene-vinyl acetate or a gelatin-chondroitin sulfate coacervate film) that is coated onto the stent. However, stent thrombosis emerged as a major safety concern with DES early after their adoption in clinical practice, requiring prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy.<sup>55</sup> Pathological examination of clinical specimens and animal studies have suggested that these DES were associated with DES-induced inhibition of stent endothelialization and delayed arterial healing and polymer hypersensitivity reactions resulting in chronic inflammation that contributed to stent thrombosis. Recently, DES have

been developed to overcome these issues with improved stent designs and construction and the use of biocompatible polymers.<sup>56</sup>

In contrast to the permanent presence of a foreign body in BMS and DES, RBS provide a scaffold and then ultimately disappear by resorption of foreign scaffold material that may potentiate a thrombotic event, permit more versatility in subsequent therapies, and not interfere with the diagnostic evaluation by noninvasive imaging such as cardiac magnetic resonance and CT.<sup>57,58</sup> Several RBS are in development or in clinical trials. The key challenge is to balance biomechanics (strength, deliverability, and lesion crossing), potential for side-branch occlusion (owing to thicker struts), durability

and biocompatibility, and to control the kinetics of stent degradation at a rate appropriate to maintain mechanical strength to limit recoil.

## Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery

Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery improves survival in patients with significant left main CAD, threevessel (and possibly two-vessel) disease, or reduced ventricular function, and prolongs and improves the quality of life in patients with left main equivalent disease (proximal LAD and proximal left circumflex), but does not protect them from the risk of subsequent myocardial infarction. <sup>59</sup> The principal mechanism for these benefits is thought to be the restoration of blood flow to hibernating myocardium.

The hospital mortality rate for CABG surgery is approximately 1% in low-risk patients, with fewer than 3% of patients suffering perioperative myocardial infarction. The most consistent predictors of mortality after CABG are urgency of operation, age, prior cardiac surgery, female sex, low left ventricular ejection fraction, degree of left main stenosis, and number of vessels with significant stenoses. The most common mode of early death after CABG is acute cardiac failure leading to low output or arrhythmias, owing to myocardial necrosis (often with features of reperfusion described in the preceding), postischemic dysfunction of viable myocardium, or a metabolic cause, such as hypokalemia.

Early thrombotic occlusion of the graft vessel may occur, usually potentiated by inadequate distal run-off from extremely small and/or atherosclerotic distal native coronaries. Additional factors may include atherosclerosis, arterial branching or dissection of blood into the graft or native vessel at the anastomotic site, or distortion of a graft that is too short or too long for the intended bypass. In some cases, thrombosis occurring early postoperatively involves only the distal portion of the graft, suggesting that early graft thrombosis was initiated at the distal anastomosis. Most patients who die early after CABG have patent grafts.

The patency of saphenous vein grafts is reported as 60% at 10 years; occlusion results from (with increasing postoperative interval) thrombosis, progressive intimal thickening, and/or obstructive atherosclerosis. 60 Between 1 month and approximately 1 year, graft stenosis is usually caused by intimal hyperplasia with excessive smooth muscle proliferation and ECM production (similar to that seen in restenosis following angioplasty and stenting). Atherosclerosis becomes the predominant mechanism in graft occlusion beyond 1 to 3 years after CABG, and earliest in those patients with the most significant atherosclerotic risk factors. Plaques in grafts often have poorly developed fibrous caps with large necrotic cores and can develop secondary dystrophic calcific deposits that extend to the lumen (Fig. 5-11); thus, the potential for disruption, aneurysmal dilation, and embolization of atherosclerotic lesions in vein grafts exceeds that for native coronary atherosclerotic lesions, and balloon angioplasty, stenting or intraoperative manipulation of grafts may potentiate atheroembolism.

In contrast to saphenous vein grafts, IMA grafts have greater than 90% patency at 10 years (Fig. 5-12).<sup>61</sup> Multiple factors likely contribute to the remarkably higher long-term patency of IMA grafts compared with vein grafts. Although free saphenous vein grafts sustain disruption of their vasa vasora and nerves, endothelial damage, medial ischemia, and acutely increased internal pressure, an IMA graft generally has minimal preexisting atherosclerosis and requires minimal surgical manipulation, maintains its nutrient blood supply, is adapted to arterial pressures, needs no proximal anastomosis, and has an artery-to-artery distal anastomosis. Graft and recipient vessel have comparable sizes with the IMA but are disparate (graft substantially larger) with saphenous vein. The advent of offpump and minimally invasive coronary artery bypass grafting has stimulated efforts to facilitate sutureless anastomosis of the graft to the aorta.62

Although advances in medical therapy and PCI have contributed to fewer CABGs performed each year, challenges remain and new technologies are under consideration to make the procedure safer and more efficacious.<sup>63</sup>

For example, patients needing revascularization have a much more complicated combination of disease processes and many of the patients have extensive CAD with prior attempts at revascularization. The future of coronary artery bypass grafting may benefit from smaller incisions and potentially robotic endoscopic CABG, facilitated by novel anastomotic devices and intraoperative determination of graft patency. Hybrid surgical/catheterization suites that allow for simultaneous staged CABG and PCI are currently under development.

#### VALVULAR HEART DISEASE

Normal valve function requires structural integrity and coordinated interactions among multiple anatomical components. For the atrioventricular valves (mitral and tricuspid), these elements include leaflets, commissures, annulus, tendinous cords (chordae tendineae), papillary muscles, and the atrial and ventricular myocardium. For the semilunar valves (aortic and pulmonary), the key structures are the cusps, commissures, and their respective supporting structures in the aortic and pulmonary roots.

The anatomy of the mitral and aortic valves is illustrated in Fig. 5-13.

#### Mitral Valve

The mitral valve (see Fig. 5-13A) has two leaflets: the anterior (also called septal, or aortic) leaflet, roughly triangular and deep, with the base inserting on approximately one-third of the annulus, and the posterior (also called mural or ventricular) leaflet, more shallow than the anterior and attached to about two-thirds of the annulus. The posterior leaflet typically has distinct scallops that are designated P1, P2, and P3, respectively, beginning from the anterolateral toward the posteromedial commissure. The mitral leaflets have a combined area approximately twice that of the annulus; apposition during systole occurs over approximately 50% of the depth of the posterior leaflet and 30% that of the anterior leaflet. Each leaflet receives tendinous cords from both anterior and posterior papillary muscles. The mitral valve orifice is D-shaped, with the flat anteromedial portion comprising the subaortic attachment of the anterior mitral leaflet. This part of the annulus is fibrous and noncontractile; in contrast, the posterolateral portion of the annulus is muscular and contracts during systole to asymmetrically reduce the area of the orifice. The edges of the mitral leaflets are held in or below the plane of the orifice by the tendinous cords, which themselves are pulled from below by the contracting papillary muscles during systole. This serves to draw the leaflets to closure and maintain competence. The posterior leaflet, with its more delicate structure and shorter annulus-to-free-edge dimension than the anterior, is more prone to postinflammatory fibrous retraction and deformation owing to myxomatous degeneration. The orifice of the tricuspid valve is larger and less distinct than that of the mitral; its three leaflets (anterior,

posterior, and septal) are larger and thinner than those of the mitral valve.

#### **Aortic Valve**

The aortic valve has structural complexity at several levels. 64 The three aortic valve cusps (left, right, and noncoronary) attach to the aortic wall in a semilunar fashion, ascending to the commissures and descending to the base of each cusp (see Fig. 5-13B). Commissures are spaced approximately 120 degrees apart and occupy the three points of the annular crown, representing the sites of separation between adjacent cusps. Behind the valve cusps are dilated pockets of aortic root, called the sinuses of Valsalva. The right and left coronary arteries arise from orifices behind the right and left cusps, respectively. At the midpoint of the free edge of each cusp is a fibrous nodule called the nodule of Arantius. A thin, crescent-shaped portion of the cusp on either side of the nodule, termed the lunula, defines the surfaces of apposition of the cusps when the valve is closed (approximately 40% of the separating area). The lunular tissue does not contribute to separate aortic from ventricular blood during diastole. Thus, fenestrations (holes) near the free edges commonly occur as a small (<2 mm in diameter), developmental, or degenerative abnormality and have no functional significance. In contrast, defects in the portion of the cusp below the lunula are associated with functional incompetence; such holes also suggest previous or active infection. When the aortic valve is closed during diastole, there is a back pressure on the cusps of approximately 80 mm Hg. The pulmonary valve cusps and surrounding tissues have architectural similarity to but are more delicate than those of the corresponding aortic components, and lack coronary arterial origins.

All four cardiac valves have a similar microscopically inhomogeneous architecture, consisting of well-defined tissue layers in the plane of the cusp. Using the aortic valve as the paradigm (see Fig. 5-13C), beneath the valvular endothelium, on the inflow side the *ventricularis* faces the left ventricular chamber and is enriched in radially aligned elastic fibers, which enable the cusps to have minimal surface area when the valve is open but stretch during diastole to form a large coaptation area. The spongiosa is centrally located and is composed of loosely arranged collagen and abundant proteoglycans. This layer has negligible structural strength, but accommodates relative movement between layers during the cardiac cycle and absorbs shock during closure. The fibrosa provides structural integrity and mechanical stability through a dense aggregate of circumferentially aligned, densely packed collagen fibers, largely arranged parallel to the cuspal free edge. Normal human aortic and pulmonary valve cusps have few blood vessels; they are sufficiently thin to be perfused from the surrounding blood. In contrast, the mitral and tricuspid leaflets contain a few capillaries in their most basal thirds.

Best developed in aortic valve, key specializations facilitating valve function include crimp of collagen fibers along

their length, bundles of collagen in the fibrous layer oriented toward the commissures, and grossly visible corrugations; these allow cusps to be extremely soft and pliable when unloaded in systole, but taut and stiff when stretched in diastole. Moreover, the orientation of connective tissue and other architectural elements is nonrandom in the plane of the cusp, yielding greater compliance in the radial than circumferential direction. The fibrous network within the cusps effectively transfers the stresses of the closed phase to the annulus and aortic wall. This minimizes sagging of the cusp centers, preserves maximum coaptation, and prevents regurgitation. Additionally, for the mitral valve, the subvalvular apparatus including tendinous cords and papillary muscles is a critical mechanism of valve competency.

## Valvular Cell Biology

Recent studies have fostered an emerging picture of how valves form embryologically, mature in the fetus, and function, adapt, maintain homeostasis, and change throughout life. These essential relationships facilitate an understanding of valve pathology and mechanisms of disease, foster the development of improved tissue heart valve substitutes, and inform innovative approaches to heart valve repair and regeneration.<sup>65</sup>

During normal development of the heart, the heart tube undergoes looping, following which the valve cusps/ leaflets originate from mesenchymal outgrowths known as endocardial cushions.66 A subset of endothelial cells in the cushion-forming area, driven by a complex array of signals from the underlying myocardium, changes their phenotype to mesenchymal cells and migrates into the acellular ECM called cardiac jelly. Likely regulated by TGF-\$\beta\$ and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the transformation of endocardial cells to mesenchymal cells is termed transdifferentiation or endothelial-to-mesenchymal transformation (EMT). Changes in cell phenotype and ECM remodeling continue throughout human fetal and postnatal development, and throughout life, leading to ongoing changes in properties, as evidenced by increasing valve stiffness with increasing age. 67,68

Two types of cells are present in the aortic valve: endothelial cells located superficially and interstitial cells located deep to the surface. Aortic valve endothelial cells (VECs) have a different phenotype than endothelial cells in the adjacent aorta and elsewhere, 69,70 but the implications of these differences are not yet known. The second cell type comprises the valvular interstitial cells (VICs), which have variable properties of fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and myofibroblasts. VICs maintain the valvular ECM, the key determinant of valve durability. To maintain integrity and pliability throughout life, the valve cusps and leaflets must undergo ongoing physiologic remodeling that entails synthesis, degradation, and reorganization of its ECM, which depends on matrixdegrading enzymes such as MMP. Although VICs are predominantly fibroblast-like in normal valves, they can become activated when exposed to environmental (ie, mechanical and

chemical) stimulation and assume a myofibroblast-like phenotype that mediates connective tissue remodeling.

## Pathologic Anatomy of Valvular Heart Disease

Cardiac valve operations utilizing replacement or repair usually are undertaken for dysfunction caused by calcification, fibrosis, fusion, retraction, perforation, rupture, stretching, infection, dilation, or congenital malformations of the valve leaflets/cusps or associated structures. Valvular stenosis, defined as inhibition of forward flow secondary to obstruction caused by failure of a valve to open completely, is almost always caused by a cuspal abnormality that induces a chronic disease process. In contrast, valvular insufficiency, defined as reverse flow caused by failure of a valve to close completely, may result from intrinsic disease of the cusps/leaflets and/or damage to or distortion of the supporting structures (eg, the aorta, mitral annulus, chordae tendineae, papillary muscles, and ventricular free wall). Thus, regurgitation can appear either precipitously, as with cordal rupture, or gradually, as with leaflet scarring and retraction. Both stenosis and insufficiency can coexist in a single valve. The most commonly encountered types of valvular heart disease are illustrated in Figs. 5-14 and 5-15.

#### Calcific Aortic Valve Stenosis

Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular heart disease in Western countries and has serious consequences. The prevalence of AS increases with age, reaching about 3% after the age of 75 in the United States. Thus, the global burden of AS is expected to double within the next 50 years as life expectancy lengthens. The limited available understanding of AS mechanisms and pathobiology has precluded development of effective noninvasive medical treatments. Symptomatic severe AS not treated promptly by corrective surgery has a high mortality as well as high and accelerating symptom burden.

Calcific AS, the most frequent valvular abnormality requiring surgery, is usually the consequence of calcium phosphate deposition in either an anatomically normal aortic valve or in a congenitally bicuspid valve (see Fig. 5-14A,B).<sup>73</sup> Stenotic, previously normal tricuspid valves present primarily with calcific aortic valve disease in the seventh to ninth decades of life, while congenitally bicuspid valves with superimposed calcification generally become symptomatic earlier (usually sixth to seventh decades).<sup>74</sup>

Calcific AS is characterized by heaped-up, calcified masses initiated in the cuspal fibrosa at the points of maximal cusp flexion (the margins of attachment); they protrude distally from the aortic aspect into the sinuses of Valsalva, inhibiting cuspal opening. However, the ventricular surfaces of the cusps usually remain smooth (see Fig. 5-14C). The calcification process generally does not involve the free cuspal edges, appreciable commissural fusion is absent, and the mitral valve generally is uninvolved. Calcified material resembling bone is

often present (see Fig. 5-14D). Aortic valve *sclerosis* comprises a common, earlier, and hemodynamically less significant stage of the calcification process. Nevertheless, aortic sclerosis is associated with an approximately 50% increase in the risk of death from cardiovascular causes, even in the absence of hemodynamically significant obstruction of left ventricular outflow.<sup>75</sup>

Aortic stenosis induces a pressure gradient across the valve, which may reach 75 to 100 mg Hg in severe cases,

necessitating a left ventricular pressure of 200 mg Hg or more to expel blood. Consequently, cardiac output is maintained by the development of pressure-overload left ventricular hypertrophy. The onset of symptoms such as angina, syncope, or heart failure in AS heralds the exhaustion of compensatory cardiac hyperfunction and carries a poor prognosis if not treated by aortic valve replacement (AVR). Other complications of calcific AS include embolization that may occur spontaneously or during interventional procedures,

hemolysis, infective endocarditis, and extension of the calcific deposits into the ventricular septum causing conduction abnormalities.

Aortic valve calcification has been traditionally considered a wholly degenerative, dystrophic, and passive process. However, recent studies suggest active regulation of calcification in aortic valves, with mechanisms that include inflammation, lipid infiltration, and phenotypic modulation of VIC to an osteoblastic phenotype,<sup>77</sup> and risk factors overlapping with those of arterial atherosclerosis. Similarities to atherosclerosis have stimulated interest in the possibility that statin drugs may decrease the rate of AS progression; however, benefit of statins for AS has not been supported by clinical studies.<sup>78</sup>

## Congenitally Bicuspid Aortic Valve

Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) typically has two cusps of unequal size, with the larger (conjoined) cusp having a midline raphe, representing an incomplete separation or congenital fusion of two cusps. Less frequently, the cusps are of equal size (see Fig. 5-14B). Neither stenotic nor symptomatic at birth or throughout early life, BAV are predisposed to accelerated calcification; ultimately, almost all become stenotic. Aortic pathology, including dilation and/or dissection, commonly accompanies BAV. Despite a prevalence of approximately 1%,79 BAV and other congenital valve abnormalities underlie over two-thirds of AS in children and almost 50% in adults. Infrequently, BAV become purely incompetent, or complicated by infective endocarditis, even when the valve is hemodynamically normal. Only rarely is an uncomplicated BAV encountered incidentally at autopsy.

Recent studies have confirmed previous reports of familial clustering of BAV and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction malformations, and their association with other cardiovascular malformations.<sup>80</sup> For example, mutations in the signaling and transcriptional regulator NOTCH1 caused a spectrum of developmental aortic valve abnormalities and severe calcification in two families with nonsyndromic familial aortic valve disease.<sup>81</sup>

#### Mitral Annular Calcification

Calcific deposits also can develop in the ring (annulus) of the mitral valve of elderly individuals, especially women. Although generally asymptomatic, the calcific nodules may lead to regurgitation by interference with systolic contraction of the mitral valve ring or, very rarely, stenosis by impairing mobility of the mitral leaflets during opening. Occasionally, the calcium deposits may penetrate sufficiently deeply to impinge on the atrioventricular conduction system to produce arrhythmias (and rarely sudden death). Patients with mitral annular calcification have an increased risk of stroke, and the calcific nodules, especially if ulcerated, can be

the nidus for thrombotic deposits or infective endocarditis. Mitral annular calcification can also mimic a left ventricular neoplasm.

#### Rheumatic Heart Disease

Rheumatic fever is an acute, often recurrent, inflammatory disease that generally follows a pharyngeal infection with group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, principally in children. In the past several decades, rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease have declined markedly but not disappeared in the United States and other developed countries. Evidence strongly suggests that rheumatic fever is the result of an immune response to streptococcal antigens, inciting either a cross-reaction to tissue antigens or a streptococcal-induced autoimmune reaction to normal tissue antigens.<sup>82</sup>

Chronic rheumatic heart disease most frequently affects the mitral and to a lesser extent the aortic and/or the tricuspid valves. Usually dominated by mitral stenosis, 83 chronic rheumatic valve disease is characterized by fibrous or fibrocalcific thickening of leaflets and tendinous cords, and commissural and chordal fusion (see Fig. 5-15A and B). Stenosis results from leaflet and chordal fibrous thickening and commissural fusion, with or without secondary calcification. Regurgitation usually results from postinflammatory scarring-induced retraction of cords and leaflets. Combinations of lesions may yield valves that are both stenotic and regurgitant. Although considered the pathognomonic inflammatory myocardial lesions in acute rheumatic fever, Aschoff nodules are found infrequently in myocardium sampled at autopsy or at valve replacement surgery, most likely reflecting the extended interval from acute disease to critical functional impairment.

## Degeneration of the Mitral Valve (Mitral Valve Prolapse)

Degenerative mitral valve disease (mitral valve prolapse) causes chronic, pure, isolated mitral regurgitation by leaflet stretching and prolapse into the left atrium and occasionally cordal rupture. 84 Owing to improved imaging technology and large community studies, a prevalence of mitral valve prolapse (MVP) of approximately 2% has been established. Potentially serious complications include progressive congestive heart failure, infective endocarditis, stroke, or other manifestation of thromboembolism, sudden death, or atrial fibrillation. Mitral valve prolapse is the most common indication for mitral valve repair or replacement.

In MVP, one or both mitral leaflets are enlarged, redundant, or floppy and will prolapse or balloon back into the left atrium during ventricular systole (see Fig. 5-15C). The three characteristic anatomic changes in MVP are: (1) intercordal ballooning (hooding) of the mitral leaflets or portions thereof (most frequently involving the posterior leaflet), sometimes accompanied by elongated, thinned, or ruptured cords;

(2) rubbery diffuse leaflet thickening that hinders adequate coaptation and interdigitation of leaflet tissue during valve closure; and (3) annular dilation, with diameters and circumferences that may exceed 3.5 and 11.0 cm, respectively (see Fig. 5-15D). Pathologic mitral annular enlargement predominates in and may be confined to the posterior leaflet, because the anterior leaflet is firmly anchored by the fibrous tissue at the aortic valve and is far less distensible. The key microscopic change is myxomatous degeneration with attenuation or focal disruption of the fibrous layer of the valve, weakening the leaflet. Focal or diffuse thickening of the spongy layer by proteoglycan deposition gives the tissue an edematous, blue appearance on microscopy (called myxomatous by pathologists).85 Concomitant involvement of the tricuspid valve is present in some cases, and the aortic and pulmonary valves are rarely affected.

Secondary changes may occur, including (1) fibrous thickening along both surfaces of the valve leaflets; (2) linear thickening of the subjacent mural endocardium of the left ventricle as a consequence of friction-induced injury by cordal hamstringing of the prolapsing leaflets; (3) thrombi on the atrial surfaces of the leaflets, particularly in the recesses behind the ballooned leaflet segments; (4) calcification along the base of the posterior mitral leaflet; and (5) cordal thickening and fusion that can resemble postrheumatic disease.

Although the pathogenesis of mitral valve degeneration is uncertain, this valvular abnormality is a common feature of Marfan's syndrome and occasionally other hereditary connective tissue disorders such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, suggesting an analogous connective tissue defect. In heritable disorders of connective tissue, including Marfan's syndrome, MVP is usually associated with mutations in fibrillin-1 (FBN-1); recent evidence also has implicated abnormal TGF-β signaling (similar to the aortic abnormalities in the pathogenesis of Marfan's syndrome and related disorders).86 Although it is unlikely that more than 1 to 2% of patients with MVP have an identifiable connective tissue disorder, studies utilizing genetic linkage analysis have mapped families with autosomal dominant MVP to specific chromosomal abnormalities, several of which involve genes that could be involved in valvular tissue remodeling.

## Ischemic Mitral Regurgitation

In ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR), also called functional mitral regurgitation, myocardial structure and function are altered by ischemic injury; in contrast to degenerative valve disease, the leaflets are intrinsically normal.<sup>87</sup> Present in many patients with CAD, IMR worsens prognosis following myocardial infarction, with reduced survival directly related to the severity of the regurgitation. Mechanisms of IMR include an ischemic papillary muscle that fails to tighten the cords during systole, and fibrotic, shortened papillary muscle that fixes the chordae deeply within the ventricle. Nevertheless, papillary muscle dysfunction alone is generally insufficient

to produce IMR, and regional dysfunction and dilation with an increasing spherical shape of the left ventricle, which pulls the papillary muscles down and away from the center of the chamber, usually contributes. Although there is substantial interest in developing surgical and/or percutaneous approaches to the repair of IMR, 88,89 the degree to which correcting IMR improves survival and/or symptoms remains uncertain. 90,91

## Carcinoid and Drug-Induced Valve Disease

Patients with the carcinoid syndrome often develop plaque-like intimal thickenings of the endocardium of the tricuspid valve, right ventricular outflow tract, and pulmonary valve superimposed on otherwise unaltered endocardium. <sup>92</sup> The left side of the heart is usually unaffected. These lesions are related to elaboration by carcinoid tumors (most often primary in the gut) of bioactive products, including serotonin, which cause valvular endothelial cell proliferation but are inactivated by passage through the lung.

Left-sided but similar valve lesions have been reported to complicate the administration of fenfluramine and phentermine (fen-phen), appetite suppressants used for the treatment of obesity, which may affect systemic serotonin metabolism (see Fig. 5-15E).<sup>93</sup> Typical diet drug-associated plaques have proliferation of myofibroblast-like cells in a myxoid stroma. Similar left-sided plaques may be found in patients who receive methysergide or ergotamine therapy for migraine headaches; these serotonin analogs are metabolized to serotonin as they pass through the pulmonary vasculature. Moreover, drug-related valve disease has been reported in patients taking pergolide mesylate, an ergot-derived dopamine receptor agonist used to treat Parkinson's disease and restless leg syndrome.<sup>94</sup>

#### Infective Endocarditis

Infective endocarditis is characterized by colonization or invasion of the heart valves, mural endocardium, aorta, aneurysmal sacs, or other blood vessels, by a microbiologic agent, leading to the formation of friable vegetations laden with organisms, fibrin, and inflammatory cells (Fig. 5-16).<sup>95</sup> Although virtually any type of microbiologic agent can cause infective endocarditis, most cases are bacterial.

The clinical classification into acute and subacute forms is based on the severity and tempo of the disease, virulence of the infecting microorganism, and presence of underlying cardiac disease. *Acute endocarditis* is a destructive infection by a highly virulent organism, often involving a previously normal heart valve, and leading to death within days to weeks in more than 50% of patients if left untreated. In contrast, in a more indolent lesion, called *subacute endocarditis*, organisms of low virulence cause infection on previously deformed valves; in this situation, the infection may pursue a protracted

course of weeks to months during which the infection may be undetected and untreated.

Staphylococcus aureus is the leading cause of acute endocarditis and produces necrotizing, ulcerative, invasive, and highly destructive valvular infections. The subacute form is usually caused by Streptococcus viridans. Cardiac abnormalities, such as chronic rheumatic heart disease, congenital heart disease (particularly anomalies that have small shunts or tight stenoses creating high-velocity jet streams), degenerative mitral valves, BAVs, and artificial valves and their sewing rings predispose to endocarditis. In intravenous drug abusers, left-sided lesions predominate, but right-sided valves are commonly affected. In about 5 to 20% of all cases of endocarditis, no organism can be isolated from the blood (culture-negative endocarditis), often because of prior antibiotic therapy or organisms difficult to culture.<sup>96</sup>

The modified Duke criteria provide a standardized assessment of patients with suspected infective endocarditis that integrates factors predisposing patients to the development of infective endocarditis, blood-culture evidence of infection, echocardiographic findings, and clinical and laboratory information. The previously important clinical findings of petechiae, subungual hemorrhages, Janeway's lesions, Osler's nodes, and Roth's spots in the eyes (secondary to retinal microemboli) have now become uncommon owing to the shortened clinical course of the disease as a result of antibiotic therapy.

The complications of endocarditis include valvular insufficiency (rarely stenosis), abscess of the valve annulus (*ring abscess*), suppurative pericarditis, and embolization. With appropriate antibiotic therapy, vegetations may undergo healing, with progressive sterilization, organization, fibrosis, and

occasionally calcification. Cusp or leaflet perforation, cordal rupture, or fistula formation from a ring abscess into an adjacent cardiac chamber or great vessel can cause regurgitation. Ring abscesses are generally associated with virulent organisms, and a relatively high mortality rate.

## Valve Reconstruction and Repair

Reconstructive procedures to repair mitral insufficiency of various etiologies and to minimize the severity of rheumatic mitral stenosis are now highly effective and commonplace. Reconstructive therapy of selected patients with aortic insufficiency (AI) and aortic dilation may also be done in some cases, 99 but repair of AS has been notably more challenging. The major advantage of repair over replacement relates to the elimination of both prosthesis-related complications and the need for chronic anticoagulation therapy. Other reported advantages include a lower hospital mortality, better long-term function owing to the ability to maintain the continuity of the mitral apparatus, and a lower rate

of postoperative endocarditis. Figures 5-17 and 5-18 illustrate the pathologic anatomy of various open and catheter-based mitral valve reconstruction procedures. Figure 5-19 illustrates a key difficulty of surgical repairs for AS, in that the cuspal calcification extends nearly to the inflow surface (recall Fig.14-C).

#### Mitral Stenosis

Commissurotomy may be employed in the operative repair of some stenotic mitral valves in which fibrosis and shortening of both cords and leaflets have markedly decreased leaflet mobility and area. Factors that compromise the late functional results of or technically prevent mitral commissurotomy and thereby necessitate valve replacement include (1) left ventricular dysfunction; (2) pulmonary venous hypertension and right-sided cardiac factors, including right ventricular failure, tricuspid regurgitation, or a combination of these; (3) systemic embolization; (4) coexistent cardiac disorders, such as coronary artery or aortic valve diseases;

(5) residual or progressive mitral valve disease, including valve restenosis, residual (unrelieved) stenosis, or regurgitation induced at operation; (6) advanced leaflet (especially commissural) calcification; (7) subvalvar (predominantly chordal) fibrotic changes; and (8) significant regurgitation owing to retraction.

Percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty has been used to treat mitral stenosis for over two decades, with excellent success in patients with suitable valvular and subvalvular morphology. However, because balloon valvuloplasty largely involves separation of the fused leaflets at the commissures, this procedure is also unlikely to provide significant benefit to patients with the valve features summarized in the preceding that obviate surgical commissurotomy.

### Mitral Regurgitation

Reconstructive techniques are widely used to repair mitral valves with nonrheumatic mitral regurgitation. 101-103 Structural defects responsible for chronic mitral regurgitation include (1) dilation of the mitral annulus; (2) leaflet prolapse into the left atrium with or without elongation or rupture of chordae tendineae; (3) redundancy and deformity of leaflets; (4) leaflet perforations or defects; and (5) restricted leaflet motion as a result of commissural fusion in an opened position, and leaflet retraction, or chordal shortening or thickening.

Following surgical resection of excess anterior or posterior leaflet tissue in valves with redundancy, annuloplasty with or without a prosthetic ring is used to reduce the annulus

dimension to correspond to the amount of leaflet tissue available. Edge-to-edge (Alfieri stitch) mitral valve repair has also been used. 104 Tissue substitutes such as glutaraldehyde-pretreated xenograft or autologous pericardium can be used to repair or enlarge leaflets. Ruptured or elongated cords may be repaired by shortening or replacement with pericardial tissue or thick suture material.

Percutaneous approaches currently being evaluated for mitral regurgitation attempt to emulate one or more of the components of surgical mitral valve repair, including annular reduction and edge-to-edge mitral leaflet apposition. 105-107 However, leaflet resection and cordal modification cannot be easily done via catheter, and there is considerable anatomical variability of the coronary sinus. 108 Percutaneous approaches considered include implantation of a device in the coronary sinus, left atrium (or both), or by device placement behind the posterolateral leaflet of the mitral valve (see Fig. 5-18A and B). The goal is to plicate or straighten the posterior mitral annulus. Additional annuloplasty approaches, presently in preclinical testing, include a suture annuloplasty from the

ventricular side of the mitral annulus, thermal modification of the annulus to obtain shrinkage, and a percutaneous ventricular restraint system that attempts to reshape the left ventricle. Another catheter-based approach uses an edge-to-edge clip prosthesis simulating the edge-to-edge surgical (Alfieri stitch) repair in which the midportions of the anterior and posterior mitral leaflets are clipped together (see Fig. 5-18C and D). 109,110

#### **Aortic Stenosis**

In balloon dilation of calcific AS, individual functional responses vary considerably and data suggest a modest early incremental benefit, high early mortality, and high early restenosis rate owing to recoil of stretched tissue. Improvement derives from commissural separation, fracture of calcific deposits, and stretching of the valve cusps (see Fig. 5-19A). The major complications include cerebrovascular accident secondary to embolism, massive regurgitation owing to valve trauma, and cardiac perforation with tamponade. Fractured calcific

nodules can themselves prove dangerous.<sup>111</sup> In pediatric cases in which the cusps are generally pliable, cuspal stretching, tearing, or avulsion may also occur.

In calcific AS, the calcific deposits arise deep in the valve fibrous layer (see Fig. 5-14C). Their removal by sharp dissection or ultrasonic debridement generally removes a considerable fraction of the valve substance, resulting in severe compromise of mechanical integrity (see Fig. 5-19B and C).<sup>112</sup>

## Valve Replacement

Severe symptomatic valvular heart disease other than pure mitral stenosis or incompetence is most frequently treated by excision of the diseased valve(s) and replacement by a functional substitute. Five key factors determine the results of valve replacement in an individual patient: (1) technical aspects of the procedure; (2) intraoperative myocardial ischemic injury; (3) irreversible and chronic structural alterations in the heart and lungs secondary to the valvular abnormality; (4) coexistent obstructive CAD; and (5) valve prosthesis reliability and host-tissue interactions.

Cardiac valvular substitutes are of two types, mechanical and biologic tissue (Fig. 5-20 and Table 5-2). 113,114 Prostheses function passively, responding to pressure and flow changes within the heart. Mechanical valves are composed of nonphysiologic biomaterials and employ a rigid, mobile occluder (composed of pyrolytic carbon in contemporary valves), in a metallic cage (cobalt-chrome or titanium alloy) as in the Bjork-Shiley, Hall-Medtronic, or Omniscience valves, or two carbon hemidisks in a carbon housing (as in the St. Jude Medical, CarboMedics CPHV, and On-X prostheses). Pyrolytic carbon has high strength and fatigue and wear resistance and good thromboresistance. Tissue valves resemble natural semilunar valves, with pseudoanatomical central flow and biological material. In the past decade, innovations in tissue valve technologies and design have expanded indications for their use. Contemporary utilization of bioprosthetic tissue valves is estimated to be about 80% of all aortic and 69% of all mitral substitute heart valves. 115,116 Most tissue valves are bioprosthetic xenografts fabricated from porcine aortic valve or bovine pericardium, which have been preserved in a dilute glutaraldehyde solution, and a small percentage are cryopreserved allografts.

In a recent compilation of risk models of isolated valve surgery by the Society for Thoracic Surgeons, the overall mortality was 3.4% (3.2% aortic and 5.7% mitral) and varied strongly with case mix. 117 The majority of early deaths are caused by hemorrhage, pulmonary failure, low cardiac output, and sudden death with or without myocardial necrosis or documented arrhythmias. Potential complications related to mitral valve insertion include hemorrhagic disruption and dissection of the atrioventricular groove, perforation or entrapment of the left circumflex coronary artery by a suture, and pseudoaneurysm or rupture of the left ventricular free wall.

Improvement in late outcome has occurred predominantly from earlier referral of patients for valve replacement, decreased intraoperative myocardial damage, improved surgical technique, and improved valve prostheses. Following valve

replacement with currently used devices, the probability of 5-year survival is about 80% and of 10-year survival about 70%, depending on overall functional state, preoperative left ventricular function, left ventricular and left atrial size, and extent and severity of CAD.

### Substitute Valve-Related Complications

Although early prosthetic valve–associated complications are unusual, prosthetic valve—associated pathology becomes an important consideration beyond the early postoperative period. Late death following valve replacement results predominantly from either cardiovascular pathology unrelated to the substitute valve or prosthesis-associated complications. In the few randomized studies comparing mechanical prosthetic and bioprosthetic valves several decades ago (comprising Bjork-Shiley mechanical and porcine aortic bioprosthetic valves), approximately 60% or more patients had an important device-related complication within 10 years postoperatively. Moreover, long-term survival was better among patients with a mechanical valve, but with an increased risk of bleeding. 118,119 Valve-related complications frequently necessitate reoperation, now accounting for approximately 10 to 15% of all valve procedures, and they may cause death. Four categories of valve-related complications are most important: thromboembolism and related problems, infection, structural dysfunction (ie, failure or degeneration of the biomaterials comprising a prosthesis), and nonstructural dysfunction (ie, miscellaneous complications and modes of failure not encompassed in the previous groups) (Table 5-3). 120

#### THROMBOSIS AND THROMBOEMBOLISM

Thromboembolic complications are the major valve-related cause of mortality and morbidity after replacement with mechanical valves, and patients receiving them require lifetime chronic therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin derivatives. 121,122 Thrombotic deposits on a prosthetic valve can immobilize the occluder(s) or cusps, or shed emboli (Fig. 5-21). Owing to biologic material and central flow, tissue valves are less thrombogenic than mechanical valves; their recipients generally do not require long-term anticoagulation in the absence of another specific indication, such as atrial fibrillation. Nevertheless, the rate of thromboembolism in patients with mechanical valves on anticoagulation is not widely different from that in patients with bioprosthetic valves without anticoagulation (2 to 4% per year). Chronic oral anticoagulation also carries a risk of hemorrhage. Anticoagulation is particularly difficult to manage in pregnant women.<sup>123</sup> The risk of thromboembolism is potentiated by preoperative or postoperative cardiac functional impairment.

"Virchow's triad" of factors promoting thrombosis (surface thrombogenicity, hypercoagulability, and locally static blood flow) largely predicts the relative propensity toward and locations of thrombotic deposits. <sup>124</sup> For example, with caged-ball prostheses, thrombi form distal to the poppet at the cage apex. Tilting disk prostheses are particularly susceptible to

total thrombotic occlusion or shedding emboli from small thrombi, with the thrombotic deposits generally initiated in a flow stagnation zone in the minor orifice of the outflow region of the prosthesis. In contrast, bileaflet tilting disk valves are most vulnerable to thrombus formation near the hinges where the leaflets insert into the housing (see Fig. 5-21A). Late thrombosis of a bioprosthetic valve is marked by large

thrombotic deposits in one or more of the prosthetic sinuses of Valsalva (see Fig. 5-21B), and no causal underlying cuspal pathology can usually be demonstrated by pathologic studies. Some valve thromboemboli, especially early postoperatively with any valve type, are thought to be initiated at the valve sewing cuff before it is healed, thus providing a rationale for early antithrombotic therapy for all types.

Although platelet deposition dominates initial blood-surface interaction, and prosthetic valve thromboembolism correlates strongly with altered platelet function, antiplatelet therapy alone is generally considered insufficient to adequately prevent thromboembolism. The lack of vascular tissue adjacent to thrombi that form on bioprosthetic or mechanical valves retards their histologic organization and may prolong the susceptibility to embolization as well as render the age of such thrombi difficult to determine microscopically. Nevertheless, this feature has permitted thrombolytic therapy to be an option in some cases. <sup>125</sup>

#### PROSTHETIC VALVE ENDOCARDITIS

Prosthetic valve infective endocarditis (Fig. 5-22) occurs in 3 to 6% of recipients of substitute valves. <sup>126</sup> Infection can occur early or late. The microbial etiology of early prosthetic valve endocarditis (<60 days postoperative) is dominated by *Staphylococcus epidermidis* and *S. aureus*, even though prophylactic regimens used today target these microorganisms. The clinical course of early prosthetic valve endocarditis tends to be fulminant. In the generally less virulent late endocarditis, a source of infection and/or bacteremia can often be found; the most frequent initiators are dental procedures, urologic infections and interventions, and indwelling catheters. The most common organisms in these late infections are *S. epidermidis*, *S. aureus*, *S. viridans*, and enterococci. Rates of infection of bioprostheses and mechanical valves are similar, and

previous endocarditis on a natural or substitute valve markedly increases the risk.

Infections associated with mechanical prosthetic valves and some with bioprosthetic valves are localized to the prosthesis-tissue junction at the sewing ring, and accompanied by tissue destruction around the prosthesis (see Fig. 5-22A). This comprises a ring abscess, with potential paraprosthetic leak, dehiscence, fistula formation, or heart block caused by

conduction system damage. Bioprosthetic valve infections may also involve, and are occasionally limited to, the cuspal tissue, sometimes causing secondary cuspal tearing or perforation with valve incompetence or obstruction (see Fig. 5-22 B and C). Surgical reintervention usually is indicated for large highly mobile vegetations or cerebral thromboembolic episodes, or persistent ring abscess.

#### STRUCTURAL VALVE DYSFUNCTION

Prosthetic valve dysfunction owing to materials degradation can necessitate reoperation or cause prosthesis-associated death

(Fig. 5-23). Durability considerations vary widely for mechanical valves and bioprostheses, specific types of each, different models of a particular prosthesis (utilizing different materials or having different design features), and even for the same model prosthesis placed in the aortic rather than the mitral site. Mechanical valve structural failure is often catastrophic and may be life threatening; in contrast, bioprosthetic valve failure generally causes progressive symptomatic deterioration.

Fractures of metallic carbon components (disks or housing) are unusual in most contemporary bileaflet tilting disk mechanical valves<sup>127</sup> (see Fig. 5-23A). Historically, however,

durability failures of mechanical valves were not uncommon. For example, of approximately 86,000 Bjork-Shiley 60- and 70-degree convexo-concave heart valves implanted, a cluster of more than 500 cases has been reported in which the two attachment points of the welded outlet strut fractured because of metal fatigue, leading to disk escape and often death. <sup>128</sup>

In contrast, structural dysfunction of tissue valves continues to be the major cause of failure of the most widely used bioprostheses (flexible-stent-mounted, glutaraldehydepreserved porcine aortic valves, and bovine pericardial valves) (see Fig. 5-23B-D). 129 Long-term data on the first several decades of bioprosthetic valves (1970s through almost 2000) indicate that 50% of bioprosthetic mitral or AVRs require replacement within 15 to 20 years following implantation, because of structural dysfunction manifested as primary tissue failure. Cuspal mineralization is the key mechanism, causing stenosis, and secondary tears can cause regurgitation. Noncalcific structural damage owing to collagen fiber disruption (independent of calcification) also contributes to bioprosthetic heart valve failure. 130 Calcific deposits are usually localized to cuspal tissue (intrinsic calcification), but calcific deposits extrinsic to the cusps may occur in thrombi or endocarditic vegetations. Calcification is markedly accelerated in younger patients, with children and adolescents having an especially accelerated course. Bovine pericardial valves can also suffer calcification and tearing, with abrasion of the pericardial tissue an important contributing factor in some designs. 131

The morphology and determinants of calcification of bioprosthetic valve tissue have been widely studied. The process is initiated primarily within residual membranes and organelles of the nonviable connective tissue cells that have been devitalized by glutaraldehyde pretreatment procedures, and involves reaction of calcium-containing extracellular fluid with membrane-associated phosphorus. The pathologic changes in bioprosthetic valves that occur following implantation are largely rationalized on the basis of changes induced by the preservation and manufacture of a bioprosthesis, including (1) denudation of surface cells, including endothelial cells in porcine aortic valves, and mesothelial cells in bovine pericardium; (2) loss of viability of the interstitial cells; and (3) locking of the cuspal microstructure in a static geometry. 129

#### NONSTRUCTURAL DYSFUNCTION

Nonstructural dysfunction of substitute heart valves are illustrated in Fig. 5-24. Paravalvular defects may be clinically inconsequential may aggravate hemolysis or may cause heart failure through regurgitation. Early paravalvular leaks may be related to suture knot failure, inadequate suture placement, or separation of sutures from a pathologic annulus in endocarditis with ring abscess, myxomatous valvular degeneration, or calcified valvular annulus as in calcific AS or mitral annular calcification. Late small paravalvular leaks usually are caused by tissue retraction from the sewing ring between sutures during healing. Small paravalvular defects are difficult to locate by surgical or pathologic examination (see Fig. 5-24A).

Extrinsic factors can mediate late prosthetic valve stenosis or regurgitation, including a large mitral annular calcific

nodule, septal hypertrophy, exuberant overgrowth of fibrous tissue (see Fig. 5-24B and C), interference by retained valve remnants (such as a retained posterior mitral leaflet or components of the submitral apparatus; see Fig. 5-24D), or unraveled, long, or looped sutures or knots (see Fig. 5-24E). With bioprosthetic valves, cuspal motion can be restricted by sutures looped around stents, and suture ends cut too long may erode into or perforate a bioprosthetic valve cusp.

## Valvular Allografts/Homografts

Aortic or pulmonary valves (with or without associated vascular conduits) transplanted from one individual to another have exceptionally good hemodynamic profiles, a low incidence of thromboembolic complications without chronic anticoagulation, and a low reinfection rate following valve replacement for endocarditis. Contemporary cryopreserved allografts, in which freezing is performed with protection from crystallization by dimethyl-sulfoxide and storage until use at –196°C in liquid nitrogen, have demonstrated freedom from degeneration and durability equal to or better than those of conventional porcine bioprosthetic valves.

Morphologic changes are summarized in Fig. 5-25. Cryopreserved human allograft heart valves/conduits show gross changes of conduit calcification and cuspal stretching (see Fig. 5-25A and B). Microscopically, there is progressive loss of normal structural demarcations and cells beginning in days. Long-term explants are devoid of both surface endothelium and deep connective tissue cells; they have minimal inflammatory cellularity (Fig. 5-25C). Despite the widely discussed hypothesis that human allograft valve failure can be attributed to an immunological process, the available evidence supports purely degenerative mechanisms.

## Pulmonary Valvular Autografts

Often called the *Ross operation* in recognition of its originator, Sir Donald Ross, pulmonary autograft replacement of the aortic valve yields excellent hemodynamic performance, avoids anticoagulation, and carries a low risk of thromboembolism. Explanted pulmonary autograft cusps show (1) near-normal trilaminar structure; (2) near-normal collagen architecture; (3) viable endothelium and interstitial cells; (4) usual outflow surface corrugations; (5) sparse inflammatory cells; and (6) absence of calcification and thrombus (see Fig. 5-25C). However, the arterial walls show considerable transmural damage (probably perioperative ischemic injury caused by disruption of vasa vasorum) with scaring and loss of medial smooth muscle cells and elastin. The early necrosis and healing with probable resultant loss of strength/elasticity of the aortic wall may potentiate late aortic root dilation. 136,137

## Stentless Porcine Aortic Valve Bioprostheses

Nonstented (stentless) porcine aortic valve bioprostheses consist of glutaraldehyde-pretreated pig aortic root and valve cusps that have no supporting stent.<sup>138</sup> The most widely used models,

St. Jude Medical Toronto SPV (St. Jude Medical Inc., St. Paul, MN), Medtronic Freestyle (Medtronic Heart Valves, Santa Ana, CA), and Edwards Prima (Edwards Life Sciences, Irvine, CA), bioprostheses differ slightly in overall configuration, details of glutaraldehyde fixation conditions, and anticalcification pretreatment. The principal advantage of a stentless porcine aortic valve is that it generally allows for the implantation of a larger bioprosthesis (than stented) in any given aortic root, which is hypothesized to enhance hemodynamics and thereby regression of hypertrophy and patient survival. <sup>139</sup>

The available evidence suggests that the durability of stentless bioprostheses is comparable with that of contemporary stented bioprostheses. However, nonstented porcine aortic valves have greater portions of aortic wall exposed to blood than in currently used stented valves, and calcification of the aortic wall and inflammation at the junction of aortic wall within the recipient's tissue, are potentially deleterious, owing to the large area of this interface. Calcification of the wall portion of a stentless valve could stiffen the root, cause nodular calcific obstruction potentiate wall rupture, or provide a nidus for emboli. Analyses of explanted nonstented valves show pannus and tissue degeneration, manifest as tears and cuspal calcification, but not substantial aortic wall calcification. 140,141

## Catheter-Based Valve Implantation

New catheter techniques for inserting foldable prosthetic valves within stenotic aortic and pulmonary valves, and for emulating surgical repair of regurgitant mitral valves are in various stages of preclinical development and clinical use. 142,143 Presently, catheter-based, percutaneous or transapical valve replacement is most widely used in patients with severe AS disease deemed otherwise inoperable as a bridge to valve replacement in patients in whom surgery needs to be delayed or has excessive risk, in repair of failed bioprosthetic valves, and in congenital heart disease, in which percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement may find a distinct niche to obviate the morbidity of reoperation to replace malfunctioning pulmonary conduits.

Catheter-based valve implantation uses a device that has two components: (1) an outer stentlike structure and (2) leaflets; these two components together constitute a functioning valvular prosthesis. Representative designs are illustrated in Fig. 5-26. The stent holds open a valve annulus or segment of a prosthetic conduit, resists recoil, provides the means for seating of the prosthesis in the annulus or vessel, and supports the valve leaflets.

Valves designed for catheter-based implantation generally consist of biologic tissue such as bovine, equine, or porcine pericardium (for aortic valve implantation) and bovine jugular venous valves (for pulmonary conduit implantation) mounted within a collapsable stent. The stents can be made from self-expandable or shape-memory materials such as nickel-titanium alloys (eg, Nitinol), or from balloon-expandable materials such as stainless steel, platinumiridium, or other alloys. For a balloon-expandable device the delivery strategy involves collapsing the device over a balloon and placing it within a catheter-based sheath. The catheter containing the device can be inserted into the femoral artery (or vein) for right-sided valves.

The Medtronic Melody transcatheter pulmonary valve is composed of a balloon expandable platinum-iridium alloy stent that houses a segment of bovine jugular vein containing its native venous valve. The Melody was designed to be used in children or young adults with congenital heart disease who have received surgically implanted right ventricular outflow tract conduits that are failing because of either stenosis or regurgitation.

Catheter-based stent-mounted prosthetic valves present novel challenges. Valved stents are significantly larger than most existing percutaneous cardiac catheters and devices, and are presently on the order of 22 to 24 Fr. In the aortic position, there is the potential to impede coronary flow, or interfere with anterior mitral leaflet mobility or the conduction system or the native diseased leaflets. Stent architecture may also preclude future catheter access to the coronaries for possible interventions. Secure seating without paravalvular leaks within the aortic annulus or a pulmonary conduit and long-term durability of both the stent and the valve tissue are also major considerations.

### Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), first performed in humans in 2002, is accomplished through peripheral arterial access, is a less invasive alternative to conventional AVR, and extends the opportunity for effective mechanical correction to a potentially large population of otherwise untreatable individuals. <sup>144,145</sup> Approximately 65,000 AVRs are done in the United States each year. It is estimated that at least 30% of patients with severe symptomatic AS are inoperable. <sup>146</sup> Previously, incumbent surgical valve manufacturers offered no effective surgical intervention suitable for these patients.

Clinical experience with TAVI is growing rapidly, with an estimated 200,000+ TAVI procedures performed worldwide to date. Randomized and observational clinical trials comparing TAVI to classical open surgical AVR suggest that survival following TAVI in high-risk patients is equivalent to or better than that of AVR at 1 to 2 years. <sup>147-149</sup> TAVI has rapidly become the new standard of care for many patients with symptomatic AS who would otherwise be deemed inoperable or have high risk for surgery.

For repair of AS, the device is passed from the femoral artery retrograde up the aorta to the aortic valve and deployed between the cusps of the calcified aortic valve, pushing the diseased cusps out of the way. Alternatively, in patients with significant atherosclerotic disease of the femoral artery and/ or aorta, the device can be deployed in an antegrade fashion through a minimally invasive surgical approach exposing the apex of the left ventricle (transapical implantation). The valve is inserted within the diseased native aortic valve, unlike surgical AVR that removes the native valve, and without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. Access is obtained either through a peripheral artery (femoral or subclavian) or directly through the aorta or left ventricular apex. Once located at the level of the aortic valve, the device requires balloon dilatation or self-expands (if fabricated from a shape memory alloy such as Nitinol). The patient's native aortic valve is not removed (as in AVR) but rather is pushed aside to the periphery of

It is hand crimped over a delivery balloon prior to deployment. (B) The CoreValve system is constructed of porcine pericardium attached to a self-expanding nickel-titanium alloy (nitinol) stent. The ventricular portion has a high radial force to compress the native valve. The midportion is tapered to avoid interference with the coronary arteries. The aortic portion is flared to provide additional fixation against the wall of the ascending aorta. (C) The Melody pulmonary valve is constructed from a bovine jugular venous valve attached with sutures to a platinum-iridium alloy stent. Its use is primarily in failed surgically constructed right ventricular to pulmonary artery conduits in the pediatric population. (D) Postmortem photograph from a patient who died following percutaneous valve implantation. The valve prosthesis can be seen to be fully expanded within the left ventricular outflow tract with good leaflet coaptation. The interventricular septum can be seen to the left and the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve to the right. (E) Specimen from a patient who had a valve-in-valve procedure.

the annulus, and compressed against the aortic root. During TAVI, delivery, positioning, and permanent fixation in the optimal location are guided by fluoroscopy and echocardiography are critical to procedural success. These devices may also play a role in the treatment of surgically implanted bioprosthetic valves that are failing because of stenosis or regurgitation in a so-called "valve-in-valve" application, in which a new valve is placed via catheter into the lumen of the existing valve (see Fig. 5-26E).

The design of the devices used in TAVI is necessarily different than that of conventional substitute heart valves. Valves used in TAVI generally consist of a bioprosthetic tissue valve, typically fabricated from bovine pericardium, mounted on a compressible metallic stent (Fig. 5-26). Complications have been observed in approximately one-third of patients and may include vascular injury, paravalvular leak, and stroke. <sup>150</sup>

Several devices are currently in various stages of development and clinical use in the aortic and pulmonary position. The two transcatheter aortic valves with the largest clinical experience are the Edwards SAPIEN device (Fig. 5-26A) and the CoreValve system (Fig. 5-26B). 151,152 The SAPIEN device is composed of a balloon expandable stainless steel stent that houses a bovine pericardial valve. The stent has a low profile and is designed to be placed in the subcoronary position. There is a polymer skirt circumferentially attached to the stent to reduce paravalvular leaks. The CoreValve device is composed of a self-expandable Nitinol stent that houses a porcine pericardial trileaflet valve. The CoreValve stent is longer and is meant to be placed in the left ventricular outflow tract extending into the aortic root. These devices have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory bodies abroad.

There have been a number of clinical trials from different countries, including randomized trials comparing transcatheter aortic valve replacement to classical AVR . The consensus of these studies is that TAVI is not inferior to classical AVR in terms of procedure "success" and short-term morbidity and mortality. Long-term survival is primarily limited by comorbidities in this elderly group of patients—death is often due to severe renal, pulmonary, or nonvalvular heart disease.

Aortic insufficiency, while uncommon after classical AVR, is common after TAVI, and is usually due to paravalvular leaks. Repositionable valves may be beneficial in lowering procedural complications. Vascular events are the most common complications of the procedure and contribute to procedural mortality. The resulting vascular injury may lead to significant bleeding requiring transfusion and even death. As smaller, lower-profile systems are developed, vascular injuries leading to significant blood loss are expected to occur less frequently. A rise in creatinine following TAVR has been reported in 5 to 28% of cases. However, renal function often improves with the increase in cardiac output. Elderly patients that are candidates for TAVI generally have some degree of atherosclerotic CAD. The presence of severe CAD increases procedural risks and must be dealt with before the procedure. The coronary ostia can be blocked by the device. The risk is dependent on the site of placement of the device and anatomic factors, such as unusually heavy calcification of the

aortic valve or aortic root, or low coronary ostia. The conduction system passes through the interventricular septum immediately below the aortic valve. Hence, injury to this region during valve placement may cause partial or complete heart block. New-onset bundle branch block following TAVI has been reported in up to 45% of patients, according to early reports. TAVI is commonly associated with some myocardial injury, as assessed by CK-MB and cTnT release. Myocardial injury, judged by elevated cardiac biomarkers, is inversely correlated to improvement in ejection fraction and directly proportional to postprocedural cardiac mortality. Stroke during or after TAVI may occur from thromboemboli, aortic injury (eg, dissection or atheroemboli), hypotension, hemorrhage, or dislodgement of calcific fragments during valvuloplasty. Given that TAVI is intended for individuals who are poor surgical candidates, it is not surprising that many have comorbidities that increase the risk of thrombosis and stroke. Not surprisingly, individuals most at risk include those with a history of atrial fibrillation, severe diastolic dysfunction, and/ or left atrial or ventricular hypertrophy.

Transcatheter heart valves (THVs) are susceptible to failure modes typical to those of surgical bioprostheses and unique to their specific design. <sup>153</sup> A recent review found 87 published cases of TAVI failure. Similar to surgical bioprosthetic heart valve failure, prosthetic valve endocarditis, structural valve failure due to leaflet calcification thrombosis were the most frequent complications THV embolization and THV compression occurred in multiple cases following cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

## CARDIAC REPLACEMENT AND MECHANICAL ASSIST

## **Cardiac Transplantation**

Cardiac transplantation provides long-term survival and improved quality of life for many individuals with end-stage cardiac failure that is refractory to optimal medical management. The current 1-year survival is approximately 90% and 5-year survival is about 70%. The most common indications for cardiac transplantation, accounting for 90% of the adult recipients, are idiopathic cardiomyopathy and end-stage ischemic heart disease; other recipients have congenital, other myocardial, or valvular heart disease. Retransplantation is a viable option for patients with failing allografts, and rates of retransplantation have been rising recently.

Hearts explanted at the time of transplantation may also have previously undiagnosed conditions and unexpected findings. <sup>156</sup> Some of these findings are important for patient management, as certain diseases responsible for failure of the native heart such as amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, giant cell myocarditis, and Chagas disease may recur in the transplanted heart. Making a specific diagnosis of a genetic condition such as HCM or ARVC at the time of explant has important implications for the family members. The most frequent unexpected finding in the explanted heart is eosinophilic or hypersensitivity myocarditis, seen in 7 to 20% of explants and characterized by a focal or diffuse mixed inflammatory

infiltrate, rich in eosinophils, and generally associated with minimal myocyte necrosis. In virtually all cases, the hypersensitivity is a response to one or more of the many heart failure medications taken by transplant candidates, including dobutamine. Recipients of heart transplants undergo surveillance endomyocardial biopsies on an institution-specific schedule, which typically evolves from weekly during the early post-operative period, to biweekly until 3 to 6 months, and then approximately one to four times annually, or at any time when there is a change in clinical state. Histologic findings of rejection frequently precede clinical signs and symptoms of acute rejection. Optimal biopsy interpretation requires four or more pieces of myocardial tissue; descriptions of technical details and potential tissue artifacts are available. <sup>157</sup>

The major sources of mortality and morbidity in the first few post transplant years are perioperative ischemic injury/ graft failure, infection, and multisystem organ failure, while malignancy, graft vasculopathy, and renal failure dominate after 3 to 5 years posttransplant. Because of the success of surveillance endomyocardial biopsies and current effective immunosuppressive therapies, acute cellular rejection is an uncommon cause of death in the modern era.<sup>155</sup>

## Early Ischemic Injury

Ischemic injury can originate from the ischemia that accompanies procurement and implantation of the donor heart. Several time intervals are potentially important: (1) the donor interval between brain death and heart removal, perhaps partially related to terminal administration of pressor agents or the release of norepinephrine and cytokines associated with brain death; (2) the interval of warm ischemia between donor cardiectomy to cold storage; (3) the interval during cold transport; and (4) the interval during rewarming, trimming, and implantation. Hypertrophy and coronary obstructions in the donor heart tend to promote ischemia, whereas decreased tissue temperature and cardioplegic arrest mitigate against ischemic injury. As in other situations of transient myocardial ischemia, frank necrosis, or prolonged

ischemic dysfunction of viable myocardium or both may be present. Myocardial injury can cause low cardiac output in the perioperative period.

Perioperative myocardial ischemic injury may be detectable in endomyocardial biopsies. Owing to the anti-inflammatory effects of immunosuppressive therapy, the histologic progression of healing of myocardial necrosis in transplanted hearts may be delayed (Fig. 5-27). Therefore, the repair phase of perioperative myocardial necrosis frequently confounds the diagnosis of rejection in the first postoperative month, and in some cases, for as long as 6 weeks. Late ischemic necrosis suggests occlusive graft vasculopathy (see the following).

#### Rejection

Improved immunosuppressive regimens in heart transplant patients have substantially decreased the incidence and severity of rejection episodes. Hyperacute rejection occurs rarely, most often when a major blood group incompatibility exists between donor and recipient, and acute rejection is unusual earlier than 2 to 4 weeks postoperatively. Although acute rejection episodes occur largely in the first several months after transplantation, rejection can occur years postoperatively, rationalizing the practice of many transplant centers to continue late surveil-lance biopsies at late but widely spaced intervals.

Acute cellular rejection is characterized histologically by an inflammatory cell infiltrate, with or without damage to cardiac myocytes; in late stages, vascular injury may become prominent (Fig. 5-28). The current International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) grading system for acute cellular rejection, revised (denoted by "R") in 2004 from the 1990 version, is: Grade 0R—no rejection (no change from 1990), Grade 1R—mild rejection (1990 grades 1A, 1B, and 2), Grade 2R—moderate rejection (1990 grade 3A), and Grade 3R—severe rejection (1990 grades 3B and 4). The 1990 and 2004 formulations are compared in Table 5-4. The past decade has seen tremendous progress in the recognition, understanding, and diagnosis of acute antibodymediated rejection (AMR). AMR was originally recognized as a

clinicopathologic entity characterized by (1) cardiac dysfunction in the absence of cellular rejection or ischemic injury; (2) histologic features of interstitial edema, endothelial cell swelling, and intravascular macrophages on endomyocardial biopsy; (3) positive immunoperoxidase staining for C4d; and (4) the presence of circulating antidonor antibodies. Recently, the ISHLT has recommended pathologic grading of AMR in the following manner: pAMR0—no histologic changes of AMR and negative immunopathologic (eg, C4d) staining, pAMR1 (H+)—histologic changes consistent with AMR but immunopathologic studies are negative, pAMR1

(I+)—no histologic changes of AMR but immunopathologic studies are positive, pAMR2—pathologic AMR with histologic changes and positive immunopathologic studies, pAMR3—severe pathologic AMR with histologic changes, positive immunopathologic studies and marked edema, interstitial hemorrhage, capillary fragmentation, endothelial cell damage, and mixed interstitial inflammation. AMR most often is diagnosed in sensitized patients (including those with previous transplantation, transfusion or pregnancy, and previous ventricular assist device use) and is associated with worse graft survival. Evidence is mounting that

episodes of AMR predispose to the earlier development of allograft coronary disease. Although the optimal therapeutic strategy is still under debate, most transplant centers will use plasmapheresis to treat AMR with impaired cardiac function. Findings in surveillance endomyocardial biopsies that must be distinguished from rejection include lymphoid infiltrates either confined to the endocardium or extending into the underlying myocardium and often accompanied by myocyte damage (so-called Quilty lesions, which have no known clinical significance), old biopsy sites, and healing ischemic injury either in the perioperative period or resulting from graft vasculopathy. Lymphoproliferative disorders and infections also may be seen in biopsies.

#### Infection

The immunosuppressive therapy required in all heart transplant recipients confers an increased risk of infection with bacterial, fungal, protozoan, and viral pathogens, with cytomegalovirus (CMV) and *Toxoplasma gondii* remaining common opportunistic infections in this setting. Prophylaxis is typically given to patients at high risk of primary CMV infection (donor seropositive, recipient seronegative). Viral and parasitic infections can present a challenge in endomyocardial biopsies as the multifocal lymphocytic infiltrates with occasional necrosis seen with these infections can mimic rejection.

# Graft Vasculopathy (Graft Coronary Disease)

Graft vasculopathy is the major limitation to long-term graft and recipient survival following heart transplantation. <sup>160</sup> Up to 50% of recipients have angiographically evident disease 5 years after transplantation, whereas intravascular ultrasound identifies graft vasculopathy in 75% of patients at 3 years posttransplant. However, graft vasculopathy may become significant at any time and can progress at variable rates. We have encountered graft coronary disease in several patients as early as 6 to 12 months postoperatively at the Brigham and Women's Hospital.

Graft vasculopathy (Fig. 5-29) occurs diffusely and ultimately involves both intramyocardial and epicardial allograft vessels, potentially leading to myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, or sudden death. Although this process has been called "accelerated atherosclerosis," the morphology of the obstructive lesion of graft vasculopathy is distinct from that of typical atherosclerosis (Table 5-5).

The vessels involved have concentric occlusions characterized by marked intimal proliferation of myofibroblasts and smooth muscle cells with deposition of collagen, ECM, and lipid (see Fig. 5-29A and B). Lymphocytic infiltration varies from almost none to quite prominent. The internal elastic lamina often is almost completely intact, with only focal fragmentation. The resulting myocardial pathology includes subendocardial myocyte vacuolization (indicative of sublethal ischemic injury) and myocardial coagulation necrosis (indicative of infarction).

Evidence suggests that chronic allogenic immune response to the transplant and nonimmunologic factors mediate the vascular injury. Conventional risk factors of atherosclerosis (eg, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, advanced age), pre- or peritransplant injuries, infection, innate immunity, T-cell-mediated immunity, and B-cell-mediated immunity via production of donor specific antibodies have been associated with increased and accelerated graft vasculopathy, likely acting in concert with each other. There is no apparent difference in the frequency with which graft vasculopathy develops in patients who were transplanted for end-stage CAD versus idiopathic cardiomyopathy.

Early diagnosis of graft vasculopathy is limited by the lack of clinical symptoms of ischemia in the denervated allograft, by the relative insensitivity of coronary angiography, which frequently underestimates the extent and severity of this diffuse disease, and by the exclusive or predominant involvement of small intramyocardial vessels. Histologic changes of chronic ischemia such as subendothelial myocyte vacuolization can be seen on surveillance biopsies as evidence of myocardial ischemia and may suggest graft vasculopathy (see Fig. 5-29C and D). Obstructive vascular lesions are not usually amenable to PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting

because of their diffuse distribution. Retransplantation is the only effective therapy for most cases of established graft atherosclerosis.

## Posttransplant Lymphoproliferative Disorders

Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) are a well-recognized and serious complication of the high-intensity long-term immunosuppressive therapy required to prevent rejection in cardiac allografts. PTLD occurs in approximately

2% of cardiac allograft recipients. Several factors increase the risk of PTLD, including pretransplant Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) seronegativity (10- to 75-fold increase), young recipient age, and CMV infection or mismatching (donor-positive, recipient-negative). <sup>162</sup>

Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders can present as an infectious mononucleosis-like illness or with localized solid tumor masses, especially in extranodal sites (eg, heart, lungs, gastrointestinal tract). The vast majority (>90%) of PTLDs derive from the B-cell lineage and are associated with EBV infection, although T- or NK-cell origin and late-arising

EBV-negative lymphoid malignancies have been described. There is strong evidence that the lesions progress from polyclonal B-cell hyperplasias (early lesions) to lymphomas (monomorphic PTLDs) in a short period of time, in association with the appearance of cytogenetic abnormalities. Therapy centers on a stepwise approach of antiviral treatment and reduction in immunosuppression, and then progression to lymphoma chemotherapy.

#### Cardiac Assist Devices and Total Artificial Hearts

Continuing and increasing discrepancy between the number of available donor hearts and therefore transplants performed (2500 annually in the United States) and the number of patients in the terminal phase of heart failure and refractory to medical management (estimated at 250,000 to 500,000 in the United States, and rising) has prompted efforts in the development of VADs, total artificial hearts, and other therapies.

Mechanical cardiac assist devices and artificial hearts have traditionally been used in two settings: for ventricular augmentation sufficient to permit a patient to survive postcardiotomy or postinfarction cardiogenic shock while ventricular recovery is occurring, and as a bridge to transplantation when ventricular recovery is not expected and the goal is hemodynamic support until a suitable donor organ is located. More recently, left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have been shown to provide long-term cardiac support with survival and quality-of-life improvement over optimal medical therapy in patients with end-stage congestive heart failure who are not candidates for transplantation. LVADs are also being investigated as a "bridge-to-recovery" in patients with congestive

heart failure to induce reverse ventricular remodeling leading to an improvement in cardiac function that would eventually allow device removal. Many types of pumps are currently under development or in clinical use as ventricular assist devices. <sup>163</sup> Mechanical devices that entirely replace the native heart are currently in use or under development as bridge to transplant (SynCardia Total Artificial Heart) <sup>164</sup> or as destination therapy (Abiomed AbioCor). <sup>165</sup>

The major complications of cardiac assist devices are hemorrhage, thrombosis/thromboembolism, infection, and interactions with host tissue (Fig. 5-30). <sup>166</sup> Hemorrhage continues to be a problem in device recipients, although the risk of major hemorrhage has been decreasing with improved devices, therapies, patient selection, and surgical methods. Many factors predispose to perioperative hemorrhage, including (1) coagulopathy secondary to hepatic dysfunction, poor nutritional status, and antibiotic therapy; (2) platelet dysfunction and thrombocytopenia secondary to cardiopulmonary bypass; and (3) the extensive nature of the required surgery.

Nonthrombogenic blood-contacting surfaces are essential for a clinically useful cardiac assist device or artificial heart. Indeed, thromboembolism occurred in most patients having long-term implantation of the Jarvik-7 artificial heart and is a major design consideration for current devices. The current generation of continuous flow LVADs is carefully designed to minimize thrombosis, but oral anticoagulation is still required. The incidence of pump thrombosis in the continuous axial flow HeartMate II LVAD (see Fig 5-30A) appears to have been increasing, 167 and is currently the subject of intense debate and research. Thrombi also may form outside the LVAD, often in association with crevices and voids, and in areas of disturbed blood flow such as near connections of conduits and other components to the native heart (see Fig. 5-30B). 168 Accounting for significant morbidity and mortality following the prolonged use of cardiac assist devices, infection can occur either within the device or associated with percutaneous drive lines (see Fig. 5-30C). Susceptibility to infection is potentiated by not only the usual prosthesisassociated factors (see later), but also by the multisystem organ damage from the underlying disease, the periprosthetic culture medium provided by postoperative hemorrhage, and by prolonged hospitalization with the associated risk of nosocomial infections. Assist device-associated infections are often resistant to antibiotic therapy and host defenses, but are generally considered not an absolute contraindication to subsequent cardiac transplantation. Novel device designs, including alternative sites for driveline placement and the elimination of the driveline altogether with transcutaneous energy transmission technology, may play a role in further decreasing infection.

Left ventricular assist device implantation can allow for reverse remodeling (see below), resulting in a decrease of the size of the left ventricular chamber. Therefore, an LVAD inflow cannula may end up contacting cardiac structures in the now-smaller left ventricular chamber that it was nowhere near at the time of implantation into a dilated ventricle. This can lead to inflow obstruction (see Fig. 5-30D), acquired

![](_page_43_Picture_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 5-30** Complications of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). (A) Circumferential thrombus (*arrows*) on the inflow bearing of the impeller of a Thoratec HeartMate II LVAD. (B) Thrombus (*arrows*) on the outer aspect of the inflow cannula of a HeartWare HVAD within the left ventricular cavity. (C) Fungal infection in LVAD outflow graft. (D) Inflow cannula of a HeartWare HVAD impinging on the posterior left ventricular wall resulting in obstruction.

ventricular septal defect, myocardial hemorrhage, and potential arrhythmias. Other complications include hemolysis, pannus formation around anastomotic sites, calcification, and device malfunction. There is evidence that patients on LVADs are more likely to develop allosensitization, which can pose a significant risk to posttransplantation outcome in the bridge-to-transplant patients. <sup>169</sup> These complications not only have significant morbidity and can be fatal, but they may make a previously suitable patient ineligible for future transplantation.

Long-term LVADs are primarily used as a bridge to transplantation because cardiac transplantation currently offers a better long-term outlook for most patients. In a subset of patients, support by LVAD results in improved cardiac function, with heart transplantation no longer necessary even after removal of the LVAD (bridge to recovery). Left ventricular assist device support is now recognized to offer potential for myocardial recovery, a favorable outcome that is further enhanced by combination with pharmacologic therapy. LVADs lead to lowered cardiac pressure and volume overload

in the myocardium followed by decreased ventricular wall tension, reduced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, improved coronary perfusion, and decreased chronic ischemia.

To what extent recovery of myocardial function can occur during VAD implantation is uncertain. Many pathophysiologic changes occur during the progression to end-stage heart failure, ranging from the subcellular (eg, abnormal mitochondrial function and calcium metabolism) to the organ and system level (eg, ventricular dilation, decreased ejection fraction, and neurohormonal changes), leading to the signs and symptoms of congestive failure. Implantation of an LVAD can reverse many of these changes (reverse remodeling), leading to increased cardiac output, decreased ventricular enddiastolic volume, and normalization of neurohormonal status such that a small fraction of patients can be weaned from the device without the need for subsequent cardiac transplantation. Current research focuses on the mechanisms of cardiac recovery, identification of patients who could achieve recovery, and specifics such as the timing and duration of therapy; a key goal is to identify potential predictors and novel therapeutic targets capable of enhancing myocardial repair. 170

#### **ARRHYTHMIAS**

Arrhythmias generally occur as a result of disorders of electrical impulse formation, disorders of electrical impulse conduction, or a combination of the two. The underlying anatomic substrates for arrhythmogenesis are many. Many cardiomyopathies can present with arrhythmias, including those with genetic (eg, HCM, ARVC, and the ion channelopathies), mixed (eg, dilated cardiomyopathy), and acquired (eg, myocarditis, sarcoidosis and amyloidosis) etiologies. A common cause of arrhythmias and sudden death (especially in the older adult population) is ischemic heart disease, both in patients with and without a prior myocardial infarction. Myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis of any etiology (eg, secondary to valvular heart disease, hypertension, or a remote infarction) also can provide the anatomical and functional substrate for the development of an arrhythmia. These underlying processes and pathologic anatomy increase the risk of spontaneous lethal arrhythmias in the setting of acute initiating events such as acute ischemia, neurohormonal activation, changes in electrolytes, and other metabolic stressors. 171

Treatments for arrhythmias and their complications include pharmacologic therapy, device therapy<sup>172,173</sup> (eg, pacemakers, defibrillators), and ablation therapy.

## Pacemakers and Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators

Modern cardiac pacing is achieved by a system of interconnected components consisting of (1) a pulse generator that includes a power source and electric circuitry to initiate the electric stimulus and to sense normal activity; (2) one or more electrically insulated conductors leading from the pulse generator to the heart, with a bipolar electrode at the distal end of each; and (3) a tissue, or blood and tissue, interface

between electrode and adjacent stimulatable myocardial cells, which is of critical importance in the proper functioning of the pacemaker. Typically, a layer of nonexcitable fibrous tissue forms around the tip of the electrode. This fibrosis may be induced by the electrode itself or may result from myocardial scarring from some other cause, most commonly a healed myocardial infarction. The thickness of this nonexcitable tissue between the electrode and excitable tissue determines the stimulus threshold, or the strength of the pacing stimulus required to initiate myocyte depolarization, and thus the amount of energy required from the pacemaker. Attempts to reduce the thickness of this layer (thereby extending battery life) include improved lead designs<sup>174</sup> with active fixation and the use of slow, local release of corticosteroids from the lead tip. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are used in the treatment of patients who have life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias that are refractory to medical management and unsuitable for other surgical or ablative therapy, and have similar components to the pacemaker described in the preceding. These devices sense arrhythmias that can lead to sudden death and deliver therapy in the form of rapid ventricular pacing and/or a defibrillation current to terminate the dysrhythmic episode. ICDs also must overcome the barrier posed by the interfacial fibrosis at the electrode tip.

Complications from the use of pacemakers include lead displacement, vascular or cardiac perforation leading to hemothorax, pneumothorax or tamponade, lead entrapment, infection, erosion of the device into adjacent tissues owing to pressure necrosis, rotation of the device within the pocket, thrombosis and/or thromboembolism, and lead fracture, in addition to malfunction of the device itself. If the lead needs to be extracted for chronic infection or device-related defects, damage to the myocardium and/or tricuspid valve may occur secondary to encasement of the lead in fibrous tissue. Similar complications affect ICDs, with additional considerations being the consequences of repeated defibrillations on the myocardium and vascular structures, including myocardial necrosis, and the risk of oversensing (with resultant unnecessary shocks) or undersensing (with resultant sudden death). Increased attention has been paid of late to malfunctioning ICDs because of electrical flaws in a specific model that resulted in failure to terminate fatal arrhythmias. 175

#### **Ablation**

Ablation involves the directed destruction of arrhythmogenic myocardium, accessory pathways, or conduction system structures to control or cure a variety of arrhythmias, including atrial flutter and fibrillation, ventricular tachycardias, and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias that are refractory to medical management. <sup>176,177</sup> Ablation can be carried out as part of a surgical procedure, or through percutaneous catheter means. Electrophysiologic (EP) studies can be used to (1) provide information on the type and location of rhythm disturbance, (2) terminate a tachycardia by electrical stimulation, (3) evaluate the effects of therapy, (4) ablate myocardium involved in the tachycardia, and (5) identify patients at risk for sudden cardiac death.

![](_page_45_Picture_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 5-31** Site of ablation of arrhythmogenic focus by radiofrequency ablation (*arrows*).

Radiofrequency ablation acutely produces coagulation necrosis within the myocardium directly underneath the source tip, eliminating the source or pathway of the arrhythmia. The characteristic histologic changes include loss of myocyte striations, loss or pyknosis of nuclei, hypereosinophilia, and contraction bands. The edge of the fresh lesion is often hemorrhagic with interstitial edema (Fig. 5-31) and inflammation. The area undergoes the usual progression of healing similar to that in an infarct, with an early neutrophilic infiltrate, followed by macrophages to handle the necrotic debris, followed by granulation tissue formation and eventual scarring. Through the use of irrigated, cooled catheters, the lesions can penetrate deeply into the myocardium. Techniques using other forms of energy, including cryoablation, microwave, and lasers, have been used to create lesions in the myocardium for the treatment of arrhythmias.

#### **NEOPLASTIC HEART DISEASE**

Although metastatic tumors to the heart are present in 1 to 3% of patients dying of cancer, primary tumors of the heart are unusual. The most common tumors, in descending order of frequency, are: myxomas, lipomas, papillary fibroelastomas, angiomas, fibromas, and rhabdomyomas, all benign and accounting for approximately 80% of primary tumors of the adult heart. The remaining 20% are malignant tumors, including angiosarcomas, other sarcomas, and lymphomas. Many cardiac tumors have a genetic basis.

The most frequent cardiac tumors are illustrated in Fig. 5-32.

### **Myxoma**

Myxomas are the most common primary tumor of the heart in adults, accounting for about 50% of all benign cardiac tumors. They typically arise in the left atrium (80%) along the interatrial septum near the fossa ovalis. Occasionally, myxomas arise in the right atrium (15%), the ventricles (3–4%),

or valves. These tumors arise more frequently in women and usually present between the ages of 50 and 70 years. Sporadic cases of myxoma are almost always single, whereas familial tumors can be multiple and present at an earlier age.

Myxomas range from small (<1 cm) to large (up to 10 cm) and form sessile or pedunculated masses that vary from globular and hard lesions mottled with hemorrhage to soft, translucent, papillary, or villous lesions having a myxoid and friable appearance (see Fig. 5-32A). The pedunculated form frequently is sufficiently mobile to move into or sometimes through the ipsilateral atrioventricular valve annulus during ventricular diastole, causing intermittent and often position-dependent obstruction. Sometimes, such mobility exerts a wrecking ball effect, causing damage to and secondary fibrotic thickening of the valve leaflets.

Clinical manifestations are most often determined by tumor size and location; some myxomas are incidentally detected in patients undergoing echocardiography for other indications, whereas others may present with sudden death. Symptoms are generally a consequence of valvular obstruction, obstruction of pulmonary or systemic venous return, embolization, or a syndrome of constitutional symptoms. Intracardiac obstruction may mimic the presentation of mitral or tricuspid stenosis with dyspnea, pulmonary edema, and right-sided heart failure. Fragmentation of a left-sided tumor with embolization may mimic the presentation of infective endocarditis with transient ischemic attacks, strokes, and cutaneous lesions; emboli from right-sided lesions may present as pulmonary hypertension. Constitutional symptoms such as fever, erythematous rash, weight loss, and arthralgias may result from the release of the acute-phase reactant interleukin-6 from the tumor leading to these inflammatory and autoimmune manifestations. Echocardiography, including transesophageal echocardiography, provides a means to noninvasively identify the masses and their location, attachment, and mobility. Surgical removal usually is curative with excellent short- and long-term prognosis. Rarely, the neoplasm recurs months to years later, usually secondary to incomplete removal of the stalk.

The Carney complex is a multiple neoplasia syndrome featuring cardiac and cutaneous myxomas, endocrine and neural tumors, as well as pigmented skin and mucosal lesions. Previously described cardiac myxoma syndromes such as LAMB (lentigines, atrial myxoma, mucocutaneous myxomas, and blue nevi) and NAME (nevi, atrial myxomas, mucinosis of the skin, and endocrine overactivity) are now encompassed by the Carney complex. The Carney complex is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, and is associated with mutations in the PRKAR1 $\alpha$  gene encoding the R1 $\alpha$  regulatory subunit of cyclic AMP–dependent protein kinase A.

Histologically, myxomas are composed of stellate or globular cells (myxoma cells), often in formed structures that variably resemble poorly formed glands or vessels, endothelial cells, macrophages, mature or immature smooth muscle cells, and a variety of intermediate forms embedded within an abundant acid mucopolysaccharide matrix and covered by endothelium. Although it had long been questioned whether

cardiac myxomas were neoplasms, hamartomas, or organized thrombi, it is now widely believed that they represent benign neoplasia. These tumors are thought to arise from remnants of subendocardial vasoformative reserve cells or multipotential primitive mesenchymal cells, which can differentiate along multiple lineages, giving rise to the mixture of cells present within these tumors.

## Other Cardiac Tumors and Tumor-like Conditions

Cardiac lipomas are discrete masses that are typically epicardial, but may occur anywhere within the myocardium or pericardium. Most are clinically silent, but some may cause symptoms secondary to arrhythmias, pericardial effusion, intracardiac obstruction, or compression of coronary arteries. Magnetic resonance imaging is useful in the diagnosis of adipocytic lesions because of its ability to identify fatty tissues. Histologically, these tumors are composed of mature adipocytes, identical to lipomas elsewhere. A separate, nonneoplastic condition called lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum is characterized by accumulation of unencapsulated adipose tissue in the interatrial septum that can lead to arrhythmias. Histologically, this tissue is composed of a mixture of mature and immature adipose tissue and cardiac myocytes, in contrast to the pure mature adipose tissue of a proper lipoma.

Papillary fibroelastomas<sup>180</sup> are usually solitary and located on the valves, particularly the ventricular surfaces of semilunar valves and the atrial surfaces of atrioventricular valves. The most common site is the aortic valve, followed by the mitral valve. They constitute a distinctive "sea anemone-like" cluster of hair-like projections up to 1 cm or more in length, and can mimic valvular vegetations echocardiographically (see Fig. 5-32B). 181 Histologically, they are composed of a dense core of irregular elastic fibers, coated with myxoid connective tissue, and lined by endothelium. They may contain focal platelet-fibrin thrombus and serve as a source for embolization, commonly to cerebral or coronary arteries. Surgical excision is recommended to eliminate these embolic events. Although classified with neoplasms, fibroelastomas may represent organized thrombi, similar to the much smaller, usually trivial, whisker-like Lambl's excrescences that are frequently found on the aortic valves of older individuals.

Rhabdomyomas comprise the most frequent primary tumor of the heart in infants and children. 182 They are usually multiple and involve the ventricular myocardium on either side of the heart. They consist of gray-white myocardial masses up to several centimeters in diameter that may protrude into the ventricular or atrial chambers, causing functional obstruction. These tumors tend to spontaneously regress, so surgery is usually reserved for patients with severe hemodynamic disturbances or arrhythmias refractory to medical management. Most cardiac rhabdomyomas occur in patients with tuberous sclerosis, the clinical features of which also include infantile spasms, skin lesions (hypopigmentation, shagreen patch, subcutaneous nodules), retinal lesions, and angiomyolipomas. This disease, in its familial form, exhibits autosomal dominant inheritance, but about half the cases are sporadic owing to new mutations. Histologically, rhabdomyomas contain characteristic "spider cells," which are large, myofibril-containing, rounded, or polygonal cells with numerous glycogen-laden vacuoles separated by strands of cytoplasm running from the plasma membrane to the centrally located nucleus.

Cardiac fibromas, although also occurring predominantly in children and presenting with heart failure or arrhythmias, or incidentally, differ from rhabdomyomas in being solitary lesions that may show calcification on a routine chest radiograph. Fibromas are white, whorled masses that are typically ventricular. There is an increased risk of cardiac fibromas in patients with Gorlin's syndrome (nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome), 184

an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by skin lesions, odontogenic keratocysts of the jaw, and skeletal abnormalities. Histologically, fibromas consist of fibroblasts showing minimal atypia and collagen with the degree of cellularity decreasing with increasing age of the patient at presentation. Although they are grossly well circumscribed, there is usually an infiltrating margin histologically. Calcification and elastin fibers are not uncommon in these lesions.

Sarcomas, with angiosarcomas, undifferentiated sarcomas, and rhabdomyosarcomas being the most common, are not distinctive from their counterparts in other locations. They tend to involve the right side of the heart, especially the right atrioventricular groove (see Fig. 5-32C). The clinical course is rapidly progressive as a result of local infiltration with intracavity obstruction and early metastatic events.

Peculiar microscopic-sized cellular tissue fragments have been noted incidentally as part of endomyocardial biopsy or surgically removed tissue specimens, either free-floating or loosely attached to a valvular or endocardial mass. <sup>185</sup> Termed mesothelial/monocytic incidental cardiac excrescences (MICE), they appear histologically largely as clusters and ribbons of mesothelial cells and entrapped erythrocytes and leukocytes, embedded within a fibrin mesh. These "masses" are considered artifacts of no clinical significance formed by compaction of mesothelial strips (likely from the pericardium) or other tissue debris and fibrin, which are transported via catheters or around an operative site on a cardiotomy suction tip.

## BIOMATERIALS AND TISSUE ENGINEERING

Biomaterials are synthetic or modified biologic materials that are used in implanted or extracorporeal medical devices to augment or replace body structures and functions. 186,187 Biomaterials include polymers, metals, ceramics, carbons, processed collagen, and chemically treated animal or human tissues, the latter exemplified by glutaraldehyde-preserved heart valves and pericardium. Biomaterials in medical devices interact with the surrounding tissues. The first generation of biomedical materials (eg, metals used for early valve substitutes) was generally designed to be inert; the goal was to reduce the host inflammatory responses to the implanted material. By the mid-1980s, a second generation of technology, comprising bioactive biomaterials, was emerging that could interact with the host in a beneficial manner (eg, biodegradable polymer sutures, drug delivery systems, textured bladder surfaces in ventricular assist devices). In the recent past, with a greater understanding of material-tissue interactions at the cellular and molecular levels, materials are being designed to stimulate specific cellular and tissue responses at the molecular level. 188,189 These materials are intended to be regenerative, and to yield functional tissue and organs, in approaches called tissue engineering (discussed later).

Biomaterial-tissue interactions comprise effects of both the implant on the host tissues and the host on the implant,

![](_page_48_Figure_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 5-33** Overview of potential interactions of biomaterials with tissue, comprising local, distant, and systemic effects of the biomaterial on the host tissue, as well as the physical and biologic effects of the environment on the materials and the device. These interactions comprise the pathophysiologic basis for device complications and failure modes. (Modified with permission from Ratner BD, Hoffman AS, Schoen FJ, et al: *Biomaterials Science: An Introduction to Materials in Medicine*, 2nd ed. Orlando: Elsevier; 2004.)

and are important in mediating prosthetic device complications (Fig. 5-33). 190 These interactions have local and potentially systemic consequences. Complications of cardiovascular medical devices, irrespective of anatomical site of implantation, can be grouped into six major categories: (1) thrombosis and thromboembolism; (2) device-associated infection; (3) exuberant or defective healing; (4) biomaterials failure (eg, degeneration, fracture); (5) adverse local tissue interaction (eg, toxicity, hemolysis); and (6) adverse effects distant from the intended site of the device (eg, biomaterials/device embolism/migration, systemic hypersensitivity).

#### **Blood-Surface Interaction**

Thromboembolic complications of cardiovascular devices cause significant mortality and morbidity. Thrombotic deposits can impede the function of a prosthetic heart valve, vascular graft, or blood pump, or cause distal emboli. As in the cardiovascular system in general, surface thrombogenicity, hypercoagulability, and locally static blood flow (called *Virchow's triad*), present individually or in combination, determine both the relative propensity toward thrombus formation and the location of thrombotic deposits with specific devices. No known synthetic or modified biologic surface is as thromboresistant as the normal, unperturbed endothelium. Like a blood vessel denuded of endothelium, foreign materials on contact with blood spontaneously and rapidly (within seconds) absorb a film of plasma components, primarily protein, followed by platelet adhesion.<sup>191</sup>

If conditions of relatively static flow are present, macroscopic thrombus can ensue. The specific physical and chemical characteristics of materials that regulate the outcomes of blood-surface interaction are incompletely understood.

Coagulation proteins, complement products, other proteins, and platelets are activated, damaged, and consumed by blood-material interactions. The clinical approach to control of thrombosis in cardiovascular devices is generally through systemic anticoagulants, particularly Coumadin (warfarin) or antiplatelet agents. Coumadin inhibits thrombin formation but does not inhibit platelet-mediated thrombosis and induces a risk of hemorrhage. Coumadin is also teratogenic, causing a risk of fetal malformations in pregnant women. Hemolysis (damage to red blood cells) in implants and extracorporeal circulatory systems can results from both cell-surface contact and turbulence-induced shear forces.

#### Tissue-Biomaterials Interaction

Synthetic biomaterials elicit a *foreign body reaction*, a special form of nonimmune inflammatory response with an infiltrate predominantly composed of macrophages. <sup>192,193</sup> For most biomaterials implanted into solid tissue, encapsulation by a relatively thin fibrous tissue capsule (composed of collagen and fibroblasts) resembling a scar ultimately occurs, often with a fine capillary network at its junction with normal tissue. Ongoing mild chronic inflammation associated with this fibrous capsule is common with clinical implants.

Although immunologic reactions have been proposed rarely for synthetic biomaterial-tissue interactions, <sup>194</sup> and antibodies can be elicited by implantation of some materials in finely pulverized form, proven clinical cardiovascular device failure owing to immunologic reactivity is rare.

### Healing of a Vascular Graft, Heart Valve Sewing Cuff, or Endovascular Stent

Healing of a vascular graft, heart valve sewing cuff, or endovascular stent derives principally from overgrowth from the host vessel across anastomotic sites; this tissue is called *pannus*. Grafts, fabrics, and stents used as cardiovascular implants heal primarily by ingrowth of endothelium and smooth muscle cells from the cut edges of the adjacent artery, and contact points with vessels

and/or myocardium; where endothelium is present, the tissue is called a *neointima*. Additional potential mechanisms of endothelialization include (1) tissue ingrowth through the fabric of a graft with interstices large enough to permit ingrowth of fibrovascular elements arising from capillaries extending from outside to inside the graft, which may permit endothelial cells to migrate to the luminal surface at a large distance from the anastomosis; and (2) deposition of functional endothelial cell progenitors from the circulating blood.<sup>195</sup>

Exuberant fibrous tissue can occur at a vascular anastomosis as an overactive but physiologic repair response (Fig. 5-34). Synthetic and biologic vascular grafts often fail because of generalized or anastomotic narrowing mediated by connective tissue proliferation in the intima, and heart valve prostheses can have excessive pannus that occludes the orifice. Intimal hyperplasia

![](_page_49_Figure_7.jpeg)

**FIGURE 5-34** Vascular graft healing. (A) Schematic diagram of pannus formation, the major mode of graft healing with currently available vascular grafts. Smooth muscle cells migrate from the media to the intima of the adjacent artery and extend over and proliferate on the graft surface. The thin smooth muscle cell layer is covered by a proliferating layer of endothelial cells. (B and C) Anastomotic hyperplasia at the distal anastomosis of synthetic femoropopliteal graft. (B) Angiogram demonstrating constriction of distal graft anastomosis (*arrow*).

results primarily from smooth muscle cell migration, proliferation, and ECM elaboration following and possibly mediated by acute or ongoing endothelial cell injury. Important contributing factors include (1) surface thrombogenesis; (2) delayed or incomplete endothelialization of the fabric; (3) disturbed flow across the anastomosis; and (4) mechanical "mismatch" at the junction of implant and host tissues.

Diminished healing also is clinically important in certain circumstances, such as periprosthetic leak associated with heart valve prostheses. Moreover, markedly diminished endothelialization owing to toxicity of the cytostatic agents, paclitaxel and sirolimus, has been implicated in late thrombosis of drug-eluting coronary stents. For uncertain reasons, humans have a limited ability to completely endothelialize cardiovascular prostheses beyond a zone near an anastomosis, typically 10 to 15 mm, thereby allowing healing of intracardiac fabric patches and prosthetic valve sewing rings, but not long vascular grafts. Thus, except adjacent to an anastomosis of a vascular graft, a compacted platelet-fibrin aggregate (pseudointima) comprises the inner lining, even after long-term implantation. Because firm adherence of such linings to the underlying graft may be impossible, dislodgment of the lining and formation of a flap-valve can occur and cause obstruction. 196 Current research focuses on novel vascular graft materials that enhance endothelial cell attachment, grafts, and other implants preseeded with unmodified or genetically engineered endothelial cells, attempts to block smooth muscle cell proliferation, and engineered tissue vascular grafts (see the following).<sup>197</sup>

#### Infection

Infection is a common complication of implanted prosthetic devices and a frequent source of morbidity and mortality. <sup>198,199</sup> Early implant infections (<1 to 2 months postoperatively) most likely result from intraoperative contamination or early postoperative wound infection. In contrast, late infections generally occur by a hematogenous route, and can be initiated by bacteremia induced by therapeutic dental, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary procedures. Antibiotics given prophylactically at the time of device implantation and shortly before subsequent diagnostic and therapeutic procedures may protect against implant infection.

The presence of a foreign body potentiates infection in several ways. Microorganisms may inadvertently be introduced into deep tissue locations by contamination at device implantation, bypassing natural barriers against infection. Some devices, such as current left ventricular assist devices, require a percutaneous driveline, providing a continuous potential means of entry for microorganisms. Infections associated with medical devices are characterized microbiologically by a high prevalence of organisms capable of forming protective biofilms (ie, a multicellular consortium of microbial cells that is irreversibly associated with a material surface and enclosed in a self-produced ECM composed primarily of polysaccharides), 200 including gram-positive bacteria such as S. epidermidis, S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and S. viridans, gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas

aeruginosa, and fungi such as *Candida albicans*. Some of these organisms, especially *S. epidermidis* and *S. viridans*, are of relatively low virulence in the absence of a foreign body, but are frequent causes of medical device infection. The production of a *biofilm* by an organism is protective against the humoral and cellular immune response of the host<sup>201</sup> and inhibits the penetration and effectiveness of opsonizing antibodies, inflammatory cells, and antibiotics. Moreover, vasculature may be diminished and there may be necrotic tissue in the vicinity of an implant. Consequently, an implant-associated infection often persists until the device is removed.

# Tissue Engineering and Cardiovascular Regeneration

Tissue engineering comprises therapeutic approaches that use endogenous or exogenously delivered living cells together with natural materials or synthetic polymers to develop or regenerate functional tissues. 202-204 In the most widely used generic strategy to engineering tissues, cells are initially seeded on a synthetic polymer scaffold (usually a bioresorbable polymer in a porous configuration) or natural material (such as collagen, decellularized tissue, or otherwise chemically treated tissue), in the desired geometry for the engineered tissue, and a tissue is matured in vitro. The in vitro phase is done in a vessel (a bioreactor), containing a metabolically and mechanically supportive environment with growth media. The cells, which may be either fully differentiated or stem cells, proliferate and an elaborate ECM is created in the form of a "new" tissue (the construct). In the second step, the construct is implanted in vivo into the appropriate anatomical location. Following implantation remodeling of the construct in vivo is intended to recapitulate normal functional architecture of an organ or tissue. Another collection of methods uses the in vivo environment as the bioreactor and thereby aims to recruit endogenous cells to build tissues from within. Key processes occurring during the in vitro and in vivo phases of tissue formation and maturation are: (1) cell proliferation, sorting, and differentiation; (2) ECM production and organization; (3) degradation of the scaffold; and (4) remodeling and potentially growth of the tissue.

The principles and processes of tissue engineering have been applied to vascular grafts, myocardium, and heart valves, as discussed next.

## **Engineered Vascular Grafts**

Tissue-engineered vascular grafts blood vessels of small caliber are actively being investigated.<sup>205-207</sup> Vascular cells have been applied onto tubular resorbable polymer scaffolds and matured in vitro in a bioreactor prior to in vivo implantation.<sup>208</sup> Exposure to pulsatile physical forces during tissue formation generally enhances graft properties; pulsed grafts are thicker, have greater suture retention, and higher cell and collagen density than nonpulsed engineered grafts, and have a histologic appearance similar to that of native arteries. Other investigators have fabricated mechanically sound engineered

tissue vascular grafts by constructing a cohesive cellular sheet of smooth muscle cells, rolling this sheet to form the vessel media, analogous to a jelly roll, wrapping a sheet of human fibroblasts around the media to serve as an adventitia, and seeding endothelial cells in the lumen.<sup>209</sup> Vessel "equivalents" composed of collagen and cultured bovine fibroblasts, and smooth muscle and endothelial cells have been investigated, but despite reinforcement with a Dacron mesh, such grafts have been unable to withstand burst strengths for in vivo applications.<sup>210</sup> Another approach to vascular graft engineering utilizes naturally derived matrices with or without cell repopulation prior to implantation.<sup>211</sup> Vascular grafts fabricated from small intestine submucosa used as experimental vascular grafts in dogs were reported to be completely endothelialized and histologically similar to arteries.<sup>212,213</sup>

Another approach to vascular tissue engineering extends the concept of Sparks' silicone mandril-grown graft used clinically in the 1970s, in which a collagenous fibrous capsule tube was formed around an implanted cylindrical foreign body (silicone mandril) adjacent to a diseased vessel; the mandril was subsequently removed yielding an autologous tissue tube that could be anastomosed to the vessels proximal and distal to an obstruction.<sup>214</sup> However, owing to the variability of the quality of tissue generated in older patients in areas of circulatory insufficiency, such vascular replacements often developed aneurysms when used clinically. Grafts grown as the reactive tissue that forms around silicone tubing inserted into the peritoneal cavity of rats, rabbits, and dogs, everted (so that a mesothelial cell lined surface become the bloodcontacting surface), and grafted into the carotid artery of the same animal remained patent up to 4 months.<sup>215</sup>

Initial clinical studies of tissue-engineered blood vessels as pulmonary artery segments and hemodialysis access grafts have been reported. Clinically employed conventional ePTFE vascular grafts have been seeded with endothelial cells at the time of implantation, yielding reportedly better outcomes than unseeded grafts. 18-224

## Regeneration of Cardiac Tissue

The adult heart responds to mechanical overload by hypertrophy (increase in cell size) and to severe ischemic or other injury by cell death (see earlier). Functional increase in cardiac myocyte number by cell regeneration or hyperplasia has generally not been considered possible. Nevertheless, several lines of research raise enthusiasm that clinically important cardiac regeneration and/or engineered cardiac tissue may indeed be possible.

Recent evidence suggests that myocyte regeneration and death occur physiologically, and that these cellular processes are enhanced in pathologic states, challenging the dogma that the heart as a postmitotic organ. Some investigators believe that heart homeostasis may be regulated by a stem cell compartment in the heart characterized by multipotent cardiac stem cells having the ability to acquire the distinct cell lineages of the myocardium. In this view, humans are capable of regenerating myocytes and coronary vessels throughout life

and have the capacity to adapt to increases in pressure and volume loads. <sup>225</sup> Moreover, adult bone marrow cells may be able to differentiate into cells beyond their own tissue boundary and create cardiomyocytes and coronary vessels. Myocardial tissue generated from cells, scaffolds, and bioreactors has been encouraging with respect to construct survival, vascularization, and integration, but significant and sustained functional improvement has yet to be demonstrated. <sup>226,227</sup> Application of cyclic mechanical stretch and electrical signals have been shown to enhance cell differentiation and force of contraction. <sup>228</sup>

Animal experiments and some early-phase clinical trials lend credence to the notion that cell-based cardiac repair may be an achievable therapeutic target, including (1) the possibility that the heart may have endogenous mechanisms of repair; (2) cell-based therapies in which fetal or adult cardiomyocytes, skeletal myoblasts or nonmuscle stem or differentiated cells are injected into the heart; and (3) experimental generation of functional myocardium by cell-scaffoldbioreactor tissue engineering approaches yielding a prosthetic myocardial patch.<sup>229-231</sup> Clinical trials have used cells derived from skeletal muscle and bone marrow, and basic researchers are investigating sources of new cardiomyocytes, such as resident myocardial progenitors and embryonic stem cells to achieve structural and functional integration of the graft with the host myocardium. Nevertheless, the most appropriate form of cellular therapy for myocardial injury remains to be identified. Moreover, and it remains unclear at present whether the beneficial effects observed in some studies are a result of functional and electrically integrated myocytes (the ideal), enhancement of angiogenesis owing to a local and nonspecific inflammatory reaction at the site of injection, or a "paracrine" effect, whereby transplanted cells produce growth factors, cytokines, and other local signaling molecules that are beneficial to the infarct through neovascularization and/or scar remodeling.

## Tissue-Engineered Heart Valves

Recent scientific and technological progress has stimulated the goal of generating a living valve replacement that would obviate the complications of conventional valve replacement, adapt to changing environmental conditions in the recipient, and potentially grow with a growing patient. <sup>232-235</sup> The long-term success of a tissue-engineered (living) valve replacement will depend on the ability of its living cellular components (particularly VIC) to assume normal function with the capacity to repair structural injury, remodel the ECM, and potentially grow.

Tissue-engineered heart valves (TEHV) grown as valved conduits from autologous cells (either vascular wall cells or bone marrow—derived mesenchymal stem cells) seeded on biodegradable synthetic polymers grown in vitro have functioned in the pulmonary circulation of growing lambs for up to 5 months. <sup>236,237</sup> In some studies, these grafts evolved in vivo to a specialized layered structure that resembled that of native semilunar valve. Pulmonary vascular walls fabricated from

vascular wall cells and biodegradable polymer and implanted into very young lambs enlarged proportionally to overall animal growth over a 2-year period.<sup>238</sup>

To eliminate the need for in vitro cell seeding and culture steps, an alternative tissue engineering strategy has used a scaffold of either decellularized naturally derived biomaterial (such as animal or human allograft valve, decellularized sheep intestinal submucosa [SIS]), or a porous polymer matrix implanted without prior seeding but with the intent of harnessing intrinsic circulating cells to populate and potentially remodel the scaffold.<sup>239</sup> Tissue-derived scaffolds must possess desirable three-dimensional architecture, mechanical properties, and potential adhesion/migration sites for cell attachment and ingrowth. Nevertheless, decellularized porcine valves implanted in humans had a strong inflammatory response and suffered structural failure.<sup>240</sup> Work is also being done on cell-seeded, engineered tissue valves for transcatheter implantation.<sup>241</sup>

Translation of heart valve tissue engineering and regenerative medicine from the laboratory to the clinical realm has exciting potential but also formidable challenges and uncertainties. Key hurdles include selection and validation of suitable animal models, development of guidelines for characterization and assurance of the quality of an in vitro fabricated TEHV for human implantation, and strategies to understand, monitor, and potentially control patient-to-patient variability in wound healing and tissue remodeling in vivo.
