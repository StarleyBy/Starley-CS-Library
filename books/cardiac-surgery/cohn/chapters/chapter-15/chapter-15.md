# Deep Hypothermic Circulatory Arrest

Bradley G. Leshnower • Edward P. Chen

Surgical therapy for aortic arch disease involves partial or complete replacement of the arch with great vessel reimplantation during a period of time when native cerebral blood flow is temporarily interrupted. In its original description, this interval of suspended cerebral perfusion required the cessation of blood flow to the entire body and was labeled hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA). HCA employs the use of systemic hypothermia to protect the brain and visceral organs during the ischemic period, and provides a bloodless operative field to facilitate arch reconstruction. Since the initial report of the use of HCA for aortic arch replacement, cerebral protection, and circulation management techniques have evolved to enable safe, reproducible arch reconstruction with excellent neurologic outcomes.<sup>1</sup>

HCA traces its beginnings to the work of Bigelow who demonstrated a role for hypothermia in cardiac surgery in a canine model.<sup>2</sup> John Lewis used systemic hypothermia at 28°C combined with venous inflow occlusion to perform the first successful atrial septal defect repair. He subsequently described the use of profound systemic hypothermia (9°C) with one hour of circulatory arrest without any evidence of central nervous system injury to treat an adult with ovarian carcinoma.<sup>3,4</sup> Systemic hypothermia was temporarily abandoned with the arrival of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine, but was rediscovered and used in isolated reports of arch replacement in the 1960s.5,6 However, it was the translational research of Dr. Randall Griepp, who applied lessons learned from his canine laboratory models to successfully repair aortic arch aneurysms using HCA, that ushered in the modern era of aortic arch surgery.1

#### **BASIC PRINCIPLES**

For the purposes of clarity throughout this chapter, the use of HCA without adjunctive cerebral perfusion will be termed as "HCA alone". The classification system in Table 15-1 will be used to describe varying degrees of hypothermia used for HCA Table 15-1. Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) and moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest (MHCA) are the two levels of HCA that will be primarily focused upon throughout the subsequent text.

#### Cerebral Metabolism and Blood Flow

Comprehension of HCA mandates a fundamental understanding of cerebral metabolism and blood flow. The metabolic rate and energy requirements of the brain are approximately 7.5 times the metabolism of non-nervous system tissues. The brain depends upon the aerobic process of glycolysis for energy and is estimated to have only a 2-minute supply of glucose stored as glycogen in neurons at any time. The brain is intolerant of ischemia and in that setting quickly resorts to anaerobic metabolism for energy production. Once adenosine triphosphate (ATP) stores are depleted, basic cellular ionic pumps fail and calcium accumulates in the intracellular space. This leads to irreversible neuronal injury.<sup>7</sup>

In order to support the high cerebral metabolic rate, the body provides approximately 60 mg of glucose and 3.5 mL of oxygen per 100 mg of brain tissue per minute. This translates to a cerebral blood flow of 750 to 900 mL/min or 15% of resting cardiac output under normothermic conditions. The autoregulatory capacity of the cerebral microcirculation ensures constant flow rates in normotensive individuals within a mean arterial blood pressure range of 60 to 140 mm Hg. This level of perfusion maintains a ratio of cerebral blood flow to metabolism of 20:1. However, several physiologic variables including temperature, pH, and hematocrit can modulate cerebral blood flow.

Since oxygen is vital to brain metabolism, measurement of the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO<sub>2</sub>) provides important comparative information regarding the metabolic state of the brain. Hypothermia has been shown to exponentially reduce cerebral metabolism. Systemic hypothermia at 20°C reduces the CMRO<sub>2</sub> to 76% of its baseline, and deeper hypothermia to 15°C reduces CMRO<sub>2</sub> to 84% of baseline values (Table 15-2).<sup>9</sup> In contrast to the CMRO<sub>2</sub>, hypothermia reduces cerebral blood flow in a linear fashion. As the core body temperature decreases to 22°C, the cerebral microcirculation loses its ability to autoregulate and cerebral blood flow becomes dependent upon mean arterial pressure.<sup>10</sup> Loss of autoregulation translates into an uncoupling of cerebral blood flow and metabolism. This produces excess or "luxury" perfusion of the brain, and the ratio of cerebral blood flow to

metabolism increases to a ratio of 75:1. The significance of luxury perfusion is unclear. Potential beneficial effects of luxury perfusion include a quicker, more homogenous cooling of the brain; however, potential detrimental effects include the development of brain edema and exposure to an increased embolic load.<sup>8</sup>

The most clinically accessible method of assessing cerebral metabolism is the measurement of cerebral electrical activity, which can be monitored by electroencephalography (EEG). Systemic cooling diminishes cerebral electrical activity and electrocerebral or EEG silence indicates maximal cerebral metabolic suppression. Many aortic centers use complete EEG silence during the cooling period as a reliable and safe measure of adequate cerebral suppression, indicating that it is safe to initiate HCA.

## pH Management

As stated previously, cerebral blood flow is impacted by temperature and the acid-base status of the blood. Two different strategies are used during HCA to manage pH. Alpha-stat pH management maintains normal acidemia and blood gases in 37°C (normothermic) blood. This optimizes cellular enzyme activity and preserves cerebral autoregulation. In

alpha-stat management, the pH is allowed to change as the blood temperature decreases, and the blood becomes more alkaline and hypocapneic. Such conditions cause a shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve to the left, which increases the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. The net effect is that in deep hypothermia, oxygen bound to hemoglobin is less available to be released to the tissues, and the fraction of oxygen dissolved in blood represents the major source of oxygen to the tissues.

The alternative strategy is pH-stat management, which maintains a normal pH at hypothermia by adding  $\mathrm{CO}_2$  to the blood during cooling. Supplementary  $\mathrm{CO}_2$  causes cerebral vasodilatation and eliminates the autoregulatory capacity of the cerebral microvasculature. This results in an increase in cerebral blood flow and an uncoupling of cerebral blood flow from cerebral metabolism. Due to the supplementary  $\mathrm{CO}_2$ , at deep hypothermia, the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve is shifted to the right, which decreases the affinity of hemoglobin to oxygen and increases the delivery of oxygen to the tissues. Under pH-stat management, the blood becomes acidotic and hypercapneic when the blood temperature is rewarmed to  $37^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .

Studies comparing the two strategies have been conducted in both large animals and humans. The majority of human studies contain small numbers of patients who underwent either adult cardiac or congenital heart procedures that did not utilize circulatory arrest. The adult studies are composed of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting under moderate-to-mild levels of hypothermia (26-32°C). Conclusions from the adult studies indicate superior outcomes with alpha-stat management. The animal and pediatric studies contain data conducted under deep hypothermia with either low flow cardiopulmonary bypass or circulatory arrest. Outcomes in these studies were superior with pH-stat management.<sup>11</sup>

The mechanisms of intraoperative brain injury differ between adults and children. Adults are prone to suffer embolic injury secondary to risk factors for vasculopathy (eg, hypertension, atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus). Children undergoing repair of complex congenital heart disease are more susceptible to global ischemic injury from prolonged periods of low flow or circulatory arrest. Therefore, alpha-stat management may be more optimal in adults, where the preservation of cerebral autoregulation enables the microvasculature to adjust to areas of stenoses and any disproportionate distribution of flow. Conversely, children may benefit from the global cerebral vasodilatation associated with pH-stat management to augment blood flow during prolonged low flow states. 11-13

## Pathogenesis of Brain Injury During HCA

It is well recognized that there are two different types of brain injury observed in patients treated with HCA: (1) permanent neurologic dysfunction (PND) and (2) temporary neurologic dysfunction (TND). PND, commonly referred to as stroke, manifests clinically as a focal neurologic deficit

secondary to an embolism of particulate matter or air/gas bubbles causing vascular occlusion resulting in an ischemic cerebral infarct. Risk factors for PND in patients undergoing HCA include atheromatous disease involving both the ascending aortic and the site of arterial cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass. <sup>14-16</sup> The axillary artery has been shown to provide the lowest risk of stroke in patients undergoing HCA operations. <sup>16</sup> Other neuroprotective strategies to reduce the risk of embolic stroke include the use of epiaortic ultrasound to guide the site of arterial cannulation and aortic cross clamping, and the addition of antegrade or retrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP).

TND is a reversible, diffuse subtle injury which is attributed to inadequate cerebral protection. Patients with TND can experience confusion, agitation, delirium, prolonged obtundation, orparkinsonism without localizing signs in the immediate postoperative period. Brain imaging in this clinical setting with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is negative. TND is the clinical manifestation of a global cerebral ischemic injury that results in necrotic and/or apoptotic neuronal cell death.

Necrotic cell death following HCA occurs due to a failure to meet minimum cerebral cellular metabolic and oxygen requirements. In this instance, cellular stores of ATP are exhausted and the cell converts to anaerobic metabolism. The lack of ATP also causes a failure of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump which has a multitude of consequences including cellular swelling, depolarization of the cell membrane, opening of voltage sensitive Ca2+ channels and a massive influx of calcium into the cytoplasm. Accumulation of intracellular calcium activates proteases and lipases that disrupt the cellular membrane and results in cell lysis and death. Histologically, cellular necrosis is characterized by pyknotic nuclei, swollen eosinophilic cytoplasm, and the presence of an inflammatory reaction. Risk factors for neuronal cell necrosis following HCA include inadequate levels of hypothermia, the presence of electrocerebral activity at the time of circulatory arrest, and prolonged duration (>40 minutes) of HCA without cerebral perfusion. 18-20

The second type of cell death observed in patients after HCA with inadequate cerebral protection is apoptosis. Apototic cell death is an energy-dependent process that occurs despite adequate stores of cellular energy. It represents a sublethal ischemic injury that results in the activation of specific genes, receptors and enzymes that break down the cell in a programmed manner.<sup>21</sup> Morphologically it is characterized by nuclear karyorrhexis, and margination of chromatin in the nucleus with minimal cytoplasmic or inflammatory changes. Apoptosis is a highly sophisticated and complex process that has not yet been fully characterized, and a detailed description is beyond the scope of this chapter. Fundamentally, it is a carefully regulated process that leads to the generation of caspases which initiate a proteolytic cascade in which one caspase activates other caspases and leads to rapid cell death.<sup>22</sup> Multiple animal models of DHCA have demonstrated apoptotic cell death beginning within hours of reperfusion and continuing as long as 72 hours after DHCA.<sup>23,24</sup>

Ischemia and hypoxia can initiate cell death through a third mechanism related to excessive neuronal stimulation and hyperactivity. Once the brain converts to anaerobic metabolism, lactate is produced. The inability of the neuronal cells to utilize lactate as an energy source, combined with the lack of blood flow during HCA, results in the accumulation of lactate and a drop in intracellular pH. The development of intracellular acidosis has a multitude of effects including the release of the potent excitatory neurotransmitters glutamate and aspartate, and failure of the neurotransport pumps. This results in the accumulation of glutamate in the intercellular space. Glutamate in increasing concentrations becomes neurotoxic and mediates the opening of calcium channels. The end result is an influx of calcium into the cytoplasm, which initiates a lethal biochemical cascade resulting in neuronal cell death. Excitotoxicity is the term applied to this type of neuronal cell death induced by excitatory amino acids. Excitotoxicity plays an important role in both necrotic and apoptotic ischemic neuronal cell death. 18 Metabolic rates differ throughout the different regions of the brain, and foci with high metabolic rates are more sensitive to ischemia. This concept has been termed "selective vulnerability" and, applies to neurons in the hippocampus, basal ganglia and cerebellum. 25,26 Patients with TND due to inadequate cerebral protection following HCA can often display poor cognition, altered short-term memory, and fine motor deficits. Neuropsychological tests in patients undergoing HCA have demonstrated memory and fine motor deficits consistent with subtle brain injury in patients following periods of DHCA > 25 minutes.<sup>27</sup> This type of subtle brain injury is likely due to necrotic or apoptotic neuronal cell death in the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. The impact of TND is not clinically insignificant and correlates with long-term memory and motor deficits following prolonged periods of DHCA.<sup>28</sup>

# DEEP HYPOTHERMIC CIRCULATORY ARREST

## Cooling

After the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass, systemic hypothermia is achieved by cooling the blood passing through a heat exchanger connected to the perfusion circuit. A temperature gradient (arterial inflow to venous return) that does not exceed 10°C is maintained during the cooling period to prevent the formation of gaseous emboli. The duration of the cooling period required to equilibrate blood and tissue temperatures is highly variable and is dependent upon blood flow, temperature gradient (between perfusate and organs), and tissue-specific coefficients of temperature exchange. Patient-specific variables that impact cooling include occlusive vascular disease and body mass index.

There is no consensus regarding cooling strategies for HCA. Intraoperative monitoring of time, temperature, jugular venous bulb oxygen saturation, and electroencephalographic activity can assist in the evaluation of cerebral

metabolic suppression during the cooling period. Temperature is monitored in many different sites including the inflow and outflow lines of the perfusion circuit, and by probes inserted into the bladder, rectum, nasopharynx, and esophagus. If the cerebral protection strategy is HCA alone or in conjunction with RCP, then the cooling strategy should be based upon esophageal or nasopharyngeal temperatures, as these sites have been shown to closely approximate brain temperature.<sup>29</sup> However, if antegrade cerebral perfusion is used, bladder or rectal temperatures are more important, as visceral organ protection becomes the primary goal of hypothermia.

Generally accepted parameters that ensure sufficient cerebral metabolic suppression include cooling for a minimum of 30 minutes, a goal nasopharyngeal temperature of 18°C, a jugular venous saturation > 95%, and electrocerebral silence. 30-32 However, relying on such parameters alone as a measure of adequate metabolic suppression may not be completely adequate. In a study of 109 patients undergoing HCA, >50% of patients had not achieved electrocerebral silence at a nasopharyngeal temperature of 18°C, and approximately 25% of patients have not achieved electrocerebral silence after 30 minutes of cooling.<sup>33</sup> This emphasizes the need to thoroughly evaluate all available monitoring parameters prior to initiating HCA. If HCA alone is employed, topical cooling by packing the head in ice is advocated in order to minimize upward drift of intracranial temperatures during the ischemic period.31

### Rewarming

Cerebral reperfusion and rewarming following the period of HCA is a critical phase that can exacerbate neuronal injury if not conducted properly. Following HCA, reinitiating brain reperfusion with a short period of low-pressure cold blood flow prior to rewarming is recommended. In contrast to immediate rewarming, cold reperfusion has been associated with improved cerebral perfusion, a reduction in intracranial pressure, and a decrease in cerebral edema. This strategy attenuates the adverse effects of the impaired cerebral vascular autoregulation that occurs following DHCA, and results in a reduction in brain injury.<sup>34,35</sup> Experimental data have also suggested that reperfusion should also be carried out with a higher hematocrit and normoglycemia. A lower hematocrit in the reperfusate (≈20%) has been shown to increase the degree of histopathologic brain injury compared to a higher (30%) hematocrit.<sup>36</sup> In addition to an increased oxygen carrying capacity, a higher hematocrit is thought to be beneficial due to an increase in the buffer, redox and free-radical scavenging capacity. Hyperglycemia during reperfusion has been correlated with worsening intracellular acidosis, which prevents the return of normal cellular metabolism.<sup>37</sup>

Oxygen delivery to the brain is particularly important during the reperfusion period as there is a mismatch between cerebral metabolism and blood flow. Cerebral vascular resistance is increased for up to 8 hours following the period of HCA. This results in a reduction in cerebral blood flow and an abnormally high extraction rate of oxygen and glucose from the blood in order to sustain cerebral metabolism.<sup>38</sup> It is during this period that secondary brain injury can occur with episodes of hypotension, hypoxemia, and anemia.<sup>31</sup> A gradient < 10°C must be maintained to prevent the formation of gas emboli, and the temperature of the perfusate should not exceed 36°C. Cerebral hyperthermia results in worse neurobehavioral outcomes and increased neuronal cell injury compared to mild hypothermia following DHCA.<sup>39</sup> The mechanisms behind this injury are poorly understood; however, it is likely multi-factorial and related to increases in the permeability of the blood-brain barrier and cellular metabolism in the setting of hyperthermia. The risk of this delayed neurologic injury is significant, and many high volume aortic centers advocate a period of permissive hypothermia in the intensive care unit following DHCA in an attempt to reduce this risk. 18,40

#### Safe Duration of DHCA

"DHCA alone" or DHCA without adjunctive cerebral perfusion represents the simplest, most convenient form of cerebral protection. It does not require complex perfusion strategies or neuromonitoring, and is the cerebral protection strategy of choice for surgeons who infrequently perform aortic arch reconstructions. The main concern surrounding the use of DHCA alone is the duration of the circulatory arrest period.

In an attempt to provide data regarding the safe interval of circulatory arrest at different temperatures, the Mount Sinai group measured arterial and venous blood gases at various time and temperature points in 37 adults undergoing HCA. This led to the calculation of the CMRO $_2$  consumption at various temperatures. Using CMRO $_2$ , the  $\rm Q_{10}$  (a well-described physiologic variable describing the temperature-dependent decrease in cerebral metabolism), and the assumption that cerebral blood flow can be safely interrupted for 5 minutes at 37°C, a calculated safe duration of HCA was determined for a range of temperatures. Figure 15-1 demonstrates the relationship between CMRO $_2$ , temperature, and the calculated safe duration of HCA. $^{9,18}$ 

Although most high volume aortic centers have added adjunctive cerebral perfusion to HCA as their standard strategy of cerebral protection, some centers such as Dr. Elefteriades' group at Yale still maintain the use of DHCA alone. In a contemporary series of 394 patients undergoing elective and emergent proximal and distal thoracic aortic repairs involving arch pathology, these authors cooled to a mean bladder temperature of 19°C without the use of neuromonitoring prior to initiating HCA. This correlated to a cooling period of 30 to 35 minutes. Their overall mortality and stroke rates were 6.3% and 4.8%. The incidence of seizure and dialysis were 3.1% and 2.3%, respectively. The mean DHCA time was 31 minutes, and there was a trend toward an increased stroke risk in patients with a DHCA time exceeding 40 minutes.<sup>30</sup> In a series of 656 patients undergoing DHCA alone

**FIGURE 15-1** Limits of 'safe' duration of circulatory arrest. Q<sub>10</sub> for the adult brain calculated from direct measurement of cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO<sub>2</sub>) in 37 adult patients undergoing thoracic aortic operations with DHCA. The temperature-related reduction in the metabolic rate and the calculated 'safe' periods of arrest are shown. (Data from McCullough JN, Zhang N, Reich DL, et al: Cerebral metabolic suppression during hypothermic circulatory arrest in humans, *Ann Thorac Surg.* 1999 Jun;67(6):1895-1899.)

from Dr. Crawford's Houston group, circulatory arrest times > 40 minutes were also associated with an increased risk of stroke. 41

Based upon these data above, when using DHCA alone for the repair of aortic pathology involving the arch, cooling for 30 minutes to achieve a bladder temperature of 18°C or an esophageal/nasopharyngeal temperature of 15°C will safely provide cerebral protection for 30 minutes of circulatory arrest. When the circulatory arrest period extends beyond this duration, adjunctive cerebral perfusion should be employed.

#### Cerebral Perfusion

Although DCHA revolutionized aortic arch surgery, the incidence of brain injury following prolonged periods of DHCA alone was not insignificant. It was quickly recognized that complex aortic arch reconstructions requiring circulatory arrest times > 30 minutes were associated with increased rates of adverse neurologic outcomes and mortality. <sup>30,41,42</sup> The introduction of adjunctive cerebral perfusion as an additional method of cerebral protection had a transformative effect on the field and produced dramatic improvements in neurologic outcomes following arch reconstruction.

#### RETROGRADE CEREBRAL PERFUSION

RCP was first described by Mills and Ochnerin the treatment of a massive air embolus during cardiopulmonary bypass.<sup>43</sup> In 1990, Ueda was the first to report the use of RCP

as an adjunct to profound HCA in a series of eight patients undergoing aortic arch replacement. 44 RCP is performed by cannulating and snaring the superior vena cava, and infusing hypothermicarterial blood from the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit up the superior vena cava to perfuse the brain in a retrograde direction during the period of circulatory arrest (Fig. 15-2). Generally accepted flow rates are 300 to 500 mL/min to maintain a SVC pressure of 20 to 25 mm Hg. If performed properly, RCP will produce dark blood (suggesting cerebral oxygen extraction) flowing retrograde from the origins of the great vessels into the open aortic arch during HCA. The theoretical cerebral protection benefits of RCP are to (1) flush embolic material (gaseous and particulate) from the cerebral circulation; (2) maintain cerebral hypothermia by bathing the brain in cold blood; and (3) support cerebral metabolism by providing sufficient cerebral flow during the period of HCA.

![](_page_4_Figure_11.jpeg)

**FIGURE 15-2** Schematic of retrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP). Arterial blood is perfused via the superior vena cava, with a target CVP of 25 mm Hg. Flow can be monitored through the open aortic arch. Balloon occlusion catheter can be employed to increase perfusion to body.

The proposed benefits of RCP have been extensively investigated using experimental models of HCA. RCP has been shown to significantly reduce intracranial temperatures in porcine and canine models of HCA. The maintenance of cooler temperatures resulted in a reduction of neurologic injury based upon histolopathology examinations. 45,46 RCP has also been shown to be highly effective in washing out particulate emboli from the brain using microspheres in a porcine model.<sup>47</sup> However, despite a large number of experiments in various animal models, the data are inconclusive regarding the capacity of RCP to provide significant cerebral blood flow. Shunting of blood away from brain capillaries occurs during profound hypothermic RCP via large venoarterial connections. 46,48-51 Cerebral blood flow can be improved with higher retrograde perfusion pressures and occlusion of the inferior vena cava; however, there is an increase in cerebral edema with histologic evidence of cerebral injury.<sup>52</sup> Based upon human cadaver studies, the majority of internal jugular veins have competent venous valves. In these experiments, significant retrograde cerebral blood flow was observed in <30% of cadavers, and the azygous rather than the internal jugular vein, represented the predominant pathway of flow.<sup>53,54</sup> Despite the unconvincing results of the cerebral blood flow data, RCP has been shown to improve metabolic support during HCA, with improved oxygen delivery, increased levels of cerebral ATP, a reduction in lactate production, and improved brain tissue oxygenation. 46,55,56

Although human studies have also failed to conclusively demonstrate significant cerebral capillary blood flow, the addition of RCP to HCA has markedly improved clinical outcomes following arch reconstruction.<sup>57,58</sup> In a series of 479 patients undergoing elective and emergent arch repair, Coselli compared outcomes using DHCA (n = 189) versus DHCA + RCP (n = 290). The addition of RCP significantly reduced mortality (DHCA + RCP 3.4% vs DHCA 14.8%, p < .001) and stroke rates (DHCA + RCP 2.4% vs DCHA 6.5%, p < .05).<sup>59</sup> In a series of 1107 arch repairs, Estreracompared outcomes using DHCA (n = 200) versus DHCA + RCP (n = 900). For the entire series, the mortality and stroke rates were 10.4% and 2.8%, respectively. In both univariate and multivariate analyses, the addition of RCP was protective against mortality (p < .001) and stroke (p = .02). However, the incidence of TND was 15.5% with relatively short mean RCP times of 26 minutes.<sup>60</sup> Although this is lower than the 25% incidence of TND associated with arch reconstruction using DHCA alone,<sup>28</sup> it still represents a significant incidence of inadequate cerebral protection. Other groups have also reported an incidence of TND ranging from 17 to 25% with the use of DHCA + RCP.61-63

#### SELECTIVE ANTEGRADE CEREBRAL PERFUSION

DeBakey and Cooley were the first to successfully describe the use of selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (SACP) in the surgical repair of an arch aneurysm in 1957.<sup>64</sup> In their initial report, cannulas were placed into the right femoral and bilateral carotid arteries, and a separate pump from the main cardiopulmonary bypass machine was used to perfuse normothermic blood into the carotid arteries during the period of HCA. Despite its initial success, this method was considered complex and cumbersome, and was subsequently abandoned. SACP was later revisited in the late 1980s due to the recognition of the limitations of DHCA alone. In 1991, Bachet published a series of 54 patients undergoing open arch reconstruction in which SACP was combined with HCA for cerebral protection. The technique consisted of bilateral carotid artery cannulation and infusion of blood at temperatures of 6 to 12°C ("cold cerebroplegia") at a rate of 250 to 350 mL/ min during a mean period of 22 minutes of HCA conducted at a rectal temperature of 25 to 28°C. Hospital mortality was 13% and the incidence of stroke was 1.8%.65 One year later, Kazui reported the results of 23 arch reconstructions performed with systemic hypothermia, SACP, and lower body perfusion alone via the femoral artery. The mortality rate was 8.7% and there were no strokes. The mean SACP perfusion time was 90 minutes.66 These two initial series provided the foundation for the use of SACP as the predominant form of cerebral protection for extended aortic arch reconstructions in the modern era.

In contrast to RCP, experimental data have confirmed the ability of SACP to provide adequate cerebral blood flow to support brain metabolism during the period of HCA. Transcranial Doppler measurements of middle cerebral artery blood flow in patients undergoing arch reconstruction have clearly demonstrated the superiority of SACP compared to RCP in providing reliable cerebral perfusion.<sup>67</sup> In a porcine model of HCA, Filgueiras and colleagues demonstrated the maintenance of near normal cerebral metabolism with DHCA + SACP, based upon measurements of pH and levels of cerebral metabolites. Animals undergoing DHCA + RCP or DHCA alone demonstrated a significant drop in cerebral pH during the protocol.<sup>68</sup> In a separate study using the same model, these same investigators demonstrated preserved cell structure upon histopathologic analysis with DHCA + SACP compared to DHCA + RCP.<sup>69</sup> Hagl and colleagues showed in an acute porcine model that a strategy of DHCA + SACP compared to DHCA alone is associated with improved neurophysiologic recovery, lower intracranial pressure, less cerebral edema, and reduced tissue acidosis following the circulatory arrest period.<sup>70</sup>

It should be recognized that the utilization of SACP changes the paradigm of circulatory arrest. Circulatory arrest, as originally described, refers to the complete interruption of the circulation and the absence of perfusion to all organs. The addition of SACP changes this concept from total body circulatory arrest to lower body circulatory arrest, as the brain, arms, and the spinal cord (via collateral circulation) are perfused. Therefore the legs and the abdominal visceral are the sole ischemic organs during the circulatory arrest period with the use of SACP.

Numerous techniques have been described for the delivery of SACP. Bilateral SACP (bSACP) involves direct cannulation of the cervical left and right common carotid arteries or the introduction of perfusion cannulas into the ostia of the

innominate and left carotid arteries via the open arch at the time of HCA. The disadvantages of this latter method include the risk of introducing air or atherosclerotic emboliand cluttering the operative field with additional cannulas. At Emory, the preferred method of cerebral perfusion is unilateral SACP (uSACP) via right axillary artery cannulation. An 8-mm graft is sewn end to side to the right axillary artery prior to sternotomy and used as the arterial inflow line to initiate cardiopulmonary bypass. At the time of HCA, blood flow is decreased to 10 mL/kg/min and the base of the innominate and left common carotid arteries are occluded with vascular clamps (Fig. 15-3). Left carotid occlusion is performed to pressurize the extra cranial circulation and collateral system and minimize steal. This enables blood to flow via the right common carotid and right vertebral arteries to perfuse the brain and spinal cord. Flows are adjusted to maintain cerebral perfusion pressures of 50 to 60 mm Hg.71 Critics of this technique argue that uSACP provides insufficient cerebral blood flow to the left cerebral hemisphere. However, both animal and clinical data have demonstrated that there is no significant difference in cerebral blood flow between uSACP and bSACP, with and without an intact circle of Willis. 72-74 Furthermore, data from a large, contemporary, propensity-matched analysis of 1097 patients undergoing arch replacement with HCA and SACP demonstrated no difference in morbidity and mortality between uSACP and bSACP. Interestingly, there was a trend toward a higher incidence of stroke in the bSACP group that was attributed to great vessel manipulation.<sup>77</sup>

#### MODERATE HYPOTHERMIA

The implementation of SACP as an adjunct to hypothermia for cerebral protection has led to a departure from the use of deep hypothermia, to the use of moderate levels of hypothermia

at the time of lower body ischemia. The rationale behind this strategy is based upon the concept that SACP has transformed total body circulatory arrest into lower body circulatory arrest. Since cerebral perfusion is maintained with cold blood throughout the period of circulatory arrest, the primary purpose of systemic hypothermia is to provide protection to the visceral organs, skeletal muscle, and spinal cord via metabolic suppression. The metabolic rate of the visceral organs and skeletal muscle is significantly less than the brain; therefore, the visceral organs require a reduced degree of hypothermia for optimal protection and are more tolerant of ischemia. As stated in the preceding sections, colder temperatures clearly correlate with a greater reduction in metabolism. However, the induction of deep hypothermia is not a benign process. It requires prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass times for cooling and rewarming which can have detrimental effects on the lungs, liver, and kidneys. Deep hypothermia has been associated with vascular endothelial dysfunction, bleeding complications, and an increased systemic inflammatory response. 75-78

The impact of MHCA has been examined in several retrospective studies. Minatoya and colleagues evaluated the outcomes of 229 patients who received arch reconstruction with HCA + bSACP at three different temperatures:  $20^{\circ}C$  (n = 81),  $25^{\circ}$ C (n = 81), and  $28^{\circ}$ C (n = 67). Eighty-one percent of all patients received total arch replacement. There were no significant differences between the three groups with regard to the incidence of mortality, PND, or TND.<sup>79</sup> These authors published a subsequent review of 1007 patients undergoing elective and emergent arch reconstruction (73% total arch) comparing DHCA (<25°C)/bSACP versus MHCA (>25°C)/ bSACP. Their overall mortality was 4.7% with PND and TND rates of 3.5% and 6.7%, respectively, with no differences observed between the two strategies.<sup>80</sup> Paciniand colleagues examined the impact of moderate hypothermia on visceral organ protection in 334 patients undergoing elective arch reconstruction with a strategy of either DHCA (<25°C)/ bSACPor MHCA (>25°C)/bSACP. Overall in-hospital mortality was 4.6% and the incidence of PND and TND were 5.9% and 7.9%, respectively. The incidence of dialysisdependent renal failure was 6.9% and there were no cases of liver failure. There was no difference in mortality, PND, TND, dialysis-dependent renal failure, or liver dysfunction between the two strategies. In a multivariate analysis of their results, cardiopulmonary bypass time > 180 minutes and deep hypothermia were predictive risk factors for renal and/ or liver dysfunction.81

MHCA/SACP currently represents the preferred circulation management strategy for many high-volume aortic centers worldwide. At Emory, MHCA with uSACP is the standard cerebral protection method for elective and emergent hemiarch and total arch replacements. Hemiarch replacement is routinely conducted at temperatures of 28 to 29°C with mortality rates in elective and emergent cases of 4.3% and 7.7%, respectively. There is a low incidence of PND (elective 1.9%, emergent 4.6%), TND (elective 3.8%, emergent 6.2%), and dialysis-dependent renal failure (elective 2.4%, emergent 9.2%) with this technique. Mean circulatory

arrest times are 23 minutes in elective cases and 33 minutes in emergent cases. 82 Total arch replacement is conducted at temperatures of 25 to 26°C for both emergent and elective cases. A recent review of 145 consecutive patients undergoing total arch replacement at Emory demonstrated an operative mortality of 9.7%. The incidence of PND, TND, and dialysis-dependent renal failure were 2.8%, 5.6%, and 2.8%, respectively. The mean duration of circulatory arrest for these patients was 55 minutes. 83 Other high volume aortic centers have reported similar outcomes confirming MHCA/SACP as a safe and effective strategy for circulation management in aortic arch surgery. 81,84-86

# COMPARISONS OF CEREBRAL PROTECTION STRATEGIES

Currently there is no consensus amongst aortic surgeons regarding the optimal method of cerebral protection during arch reconstruction. Instead, high-volume aortic centers employ a variety of different techniques using varying degrees of hypothermia with or without adjunctive cerebral perfusion. Often the method of cerebral protection is based upon the institutional bias rather than outcome data. Contemporary cerebral protection strategies are composed of multiple variables: arterial cannulation site, temperature at HCA, antegrade versus RCP, and unilateral versus bSACP. The majority of comparisons of cerebral protection strategies in the literature are essentially retrospective reviews of changes in circulation management strategies at a single institution over time. These comparisons are valuable, but limited by their retrospective nature, lack of randomization, and differences in several important variables including the extent of arch reconstruction, the temperature at HCA, antegrade versus RCP, and the percentage of emergent cases. Nevertheless, several lessons may be learned from a review of the existing

Hagl reviewed the neurologic outcomes from the Mount Sinai experience of 717 patients undergoing arch replacement with different methods of cerebral protection: (1) DHCA (n = 588); (2) DHCA/RCP (n = 43); and (3) DHCA/SACP(n = 86). All patients were cooled to esophageal temperatures of 10 to 13°C. The overall incidence of PND and TND were 5.7% and 30%. In the 156 patients with HCA times > 40 minutes, there was no difference in the incidence of PND; however; DHCA/SACP significantly reduced the incidence of TND compared to the other strategies.<sup>87</sup> A recent retrospective review of the Japanese Adult Cardiovascular Surgery Database analyzed the outcomes of 8169 patients undergoing elective total arch replacement using either DHCA/RCP (n = 1141) or MHCA/SACP (n = 7038). The RCP group underwent HCA at 21.2°C compared to the SACP group who underwent HCA at 24.2°C. The duration of HCA was not reported in this study. In unmatched and propensitymatched analyses, there were no differences between the groups in mortality, PND, TND, or dialysis. However, it was clear that in this contemporary study, SACP was the preferred modality of cerebral perfusion amongst Japanese surgeons

for total arch replacements that required prolonged periods of HCA.<sup>88</sup> There is a single prospective trial comparing the impact of SACP versus RCP in the literature. Okita compared DHCA/RCP versus DHCA/SACP in 60 consecutive patients undergoing total arch replacement with a variety of different cannulation sites. RCP patients underwent HCA at 17.2°C and SACP patients underwent HCA at 22.1°C. There was no difference in mortality or stroke, but SACP significantly reduced the incidence of TND (SACP 13.3% vs RCP 33.3%, p = .05).<sup>89</sup>

The remainder of the retrospective comparisons between SACP and RCP in the literature are limited by significant differences in the temperature at which HCA is conducted. In these studies, the majority of patients receiving SACP undergo circulatory arrest at moderate levels of systemic hypothermia, as opposed to DHCA with the use of RCP. Three recurring themes emerge from the existing analyses in the literature: (1) an adjunct form of cerebral protection (SACP or RCP) is superior to DHCA alone and (2) the method of cerebral perfusion (SACP or RCP) has no impact upon the incidence of PND, however, (3) SACP significantly reduces the incidence of TND. Furthermore, most experts agree that in patients undergoing extended/complex arch reconstructions requiring prolonged periods of HCA, SACP is superior to RCP in preventing TND and is associated with improved overall neurologic outcomes. 40,90-92 The thoracic aortic surgical community recognizes the need for a prospective randomized multi-institutional trial comparing cerebral protection strategies; however, the logistics remain complicated.

# Pharmacologic Adjuncts

Pharmacologic adjuncts that have been utilized to optimize cerebral protection during HCA include corticosteroids, barbiturates, and mannitol. Cardiopulmonary bypass and DHCA have been associated with a significant systemic inflammatory response, increased permeability of the bloodbrain barrier and cerebral edema. Corticosteroids are a potent anti-inflammatory agent that have been shown to suppress the inflammatory response associated with DHCA. Experimental data have demonstrated that pretreatment with corticosteroids prior to cardiopulmonary bypass reduces the permeability of the blood-brain barrier, attenuates cerebral apoptosis and improves cerebral blood flow following DHCA.93,94 At Emory our typical protocol includes the administration of 1 g of methylprednisolone following induction of anesthesia and a rapid taper of steroids over the first 72 hours of the postoperative period.

Barbiturates have been shown to reduce cerebral oxygen consumption, produce an isoelectric electroencephalogram, and minimize cerebral edema. Thiopental, the most commonly used barbiturate, is employed in several high-volume aortic centers for cerebral protection in cases requiring DHCA. The timing and dose of thiopental administration can impact its effectiveness. If administered prior to HCA, the cerebral energy state is reduced which may lead

to adverse outcomes; however, its effects are considered to be advantageous when thiopental is administered during HCA. Furthermore, there is also a dose-dependent effect of barbiturates. Although low-dose barbiturates minimize cerebral metabolism, higher doses are associated with negative inotropy and sedation which could prolong the time to extubation. A recent analysis of the currently existing data did not conclusively demonstrate a cerebral protection advantage with the use of barbiturates in patients undergoing DHCA. <sup>95,96</sup>

Mannitol is a potent osmotic diuretic that is an established agent for reducing cerebral edema. It also possesses free oxygen radical scavenger properties and may have an anti-apoptotic effect following cerebral ischemia.96 The impact of these three pharmacologic agents upon postoperative mortality and adverse neurologic outcomes was recently evaluated in an analysis of the German Registry for Acute Aortic Dissection Type A. Based upon univariate and multivariate analyses, steroids were the only agent that provided additional cerebral protection by reducing the risk of new postoperative PND. Both mannitol and barbiturates were associated with a significant reduction in 30-day mortality based upon the univariate analysis, but only mannitol lowered mortality in the multivariate analysis. Neither agent conferred additional neuroprotection. 96 In summary, the use of steroids and mannitol is advantageous following DHCA, while the use of thiopental cannot be recommended based upon the available data.
