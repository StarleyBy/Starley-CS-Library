# Immunobiology of Heart and Lung Transplantation

Bartley P. Griffith • Agnes Azimzadeh

For over 40 years, cardiac and lung transplantation have achieved remarkable one-year patient survivals beyond 90% and conditional half-lives of 13 and 7.9 years, respectively. While surgeons must acquire the technical expertise to perform these often demanding surgeries, long-term graft outcomes and the recipients' well-being benefit from a multidisciplinary team well versed in the basics of the immunology of transplantation. Comfort with treating patients who receive immunosuppressive therapies, both conventional and innovative, requires familiarity with the nonsurgical language of transplantation. The goal of this enhanced chapter is to squeeze the essentials into an understandable short text. The core features of the alloresponse are presented with some specific references unique to heart and lung allografts. These include (1) histocompatibility; (2) activation of alloresponse T lymphocytes; (3) T-cell-mediated rejection (TMR); (4) antibody-mediated rejection (AMR); (5) immunosuppressive therapy; (6) surveillance for rejection; (7) immune monitoring; and (8) emerging regulators of immunity.

# MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules are a family of proteins that vary quite a lot between individuals (genetic polymorphism) and represent the molecular basis for how people's immune systems distinguish "self" from "nonself" with respect to infections and transplants. Human MHC molecules are known as human leukocyte antigens (HLA) because they are expressed at high levels on leukocytes and were first measured on peripheral blood lymphocytes. HLA are heterodimeric glycoproteins expressed on the surface of almost every cell in the human body. If recognized by an organ recipient, these proteins can trigger rejection. This is known as allorecognition.

HLA molecules on donor cells or HLA fragments, shed from thoracic organ transplants, are determined to be foreign by the immune system of the host. Intact HLA molecules expressed on the surface of cells serve two key functions in the context of transplantation. Fragments of foreign proteins, including fragments of HLA molecules, are presented in the

binding groove of HLA and are recognized by T-cell receptors (TCRs) of the recipient that happen to have high affinity for that protein fragment in the context of self HLA (indirect donor antigen presentation). In addition, recipient T-cells directly recognize donor HLA as "foreign" (direct donor antigen presentation).

The genes coding for these antigens are located on the short arm of chromosome 6. This region spans over 4 million base pairs in length and encodes for over 200 genes in three regions: Class I, Class II, and Class III (Fig. 59-1). HLA owns the most polymorphic title in man as more than 5000 types have been recognized.

Classic Class I HLA proteins/antigens are HLA-A, HLA-B, and more recently HLA-C. The  $\alpha$ -light chain is encoded in the MHC; however, the  $\beta$ -chain is  $\beta$ -2-microglobulin that is encoded on chromosome 15. When folded, the  $\alpha$ -heavy chain contains the peptide binding region which presents peptide antigen to the T-cell. Class I antigens are constitutively expressed on nearly all cells. Expression of Class I molecules (Fig. 59-2) is upregulated on the endothelium and parenchymal cells in association with inflammation, including after ischemia and reperfusion.

Classic Class II HLA proteins/antigens are HLA-DR, HLA-DRw, HLA-DQ, and more recently HLA-DP. These proteins consist of an  $\alpha$ -heavy chain and a  $\beta$ -light chain, both of which are encoded in the MHC. When folded, the  $\alpha$ -heavy chain and  $\beta$ -light chain come together with each contributing part of the peptide binding region (Fig. 59-2). Class II antigens are expressed mainly on B-cell lymphocytes, activated T-cells, monocytes/macrophages, and dendritic cells. Other cell types, such as endothelial cells, may express Class II antigen expression after activation.

Each person has two different HLA genes at each HLA locus (HLA-A, B, D, etc.) HLA antigens are co-dominantly expressed on the cell surface so that each cell has two different HLA proteins for each HLA locus. HLA "haplotype" (the sequence of A, B, D genes on one chromosome) is usually inherited as a group from each parent in a Mendelian fashion. Thus, two offspring of the same parents have a 50% chance of inheriting one identical haplotype, 25% chance of inheriting two identical haplotypes, and 25% chance of

**FIGURE 59-2** Class I and II HLA molecules are made up of polypeptidic chains with intrachain disulfide bonds. The  $\alpha_1$  and  $\alpha_2$  distal domains of Class I and the  $\alpha_1$  and  $\beta_1$  domains of Class II make up the peptide binding site for alloantigen.

having no haplotypes in common. In addition, due to the distance between these genes in the MHC, there are "hot spots" of gene recombination. Recombination in offspring occurs approximately 1 to 2% between HLA-A and C, or between HLA-B and HLA-DR, and approximately 30% between HLA-DP and HLA-DQ. Recombination accounts for most of the occasional exceptions to faithful transmission of intact parental haplotypes to their children. HLA haplotypes are found in varying frequencies across the major population groups (White, Hispanic, Black, Asian, and American Indian).

In the early days of organ transplantation, hyperacute rejection occurred due to preexisting IgM alloantibodies. Best-known examples of these are the ABO blood group IgM antibodies. While still a barrier to xenotransplantation (cross-species transplantation), blood group typing has virtually eliminated this particular cause of immediate organ destruction in allotransplantation. Of interest is the success of blood group mismatched organs in neonatal recipients before they develop IgM antibodies to blood group antigens.<sup>2</sup> Antibodies against blood group antigens arise between 6 and 18 months postnatal due to the presence of related carbohydrate antigens on intestinal bacteria. Today, when hyperacute rejection is seen, it is normally caused by preexisting IgG antibodies usually directed against donor HLA proteins. These antibodies are often the result of previous blood-cell transfusions (most particularly multidonor platelets due to the high HLA load) or previous pregnancies or transplants. After wide adoption of the first crossmatch technique by Patel and Terasaki in 1969, hyperacute rejection based on preexisting HLA antibodies became rare.3 Further improvements in screening for HLA antibodies have nearly eliminated it. Of interest in 1970, against early convention, Terasaki found that HLA-mismatched kidney recipients fared as well as those zero-mismatched recipients. 4 Starzl led the use of mismatched livers first, and soon, except for bone marrow, all followed in kidney, heart, and lung transplants.5

While HLA mismatches seem less predictive of outcomes, those recipients who present for transplant with preformed anti-HLA antibodies (prior pregnancies or blood transfusions) or developed antibodies in responses to the mismatches have more rejection. This has led to poor survival in heart and lung recipients. <sup>6-10</sup> There is some evidence that posttransplant removal of these donor-specific antibodies (DSA) can improve the function of kidneys and lungs. <sup>11,12</sup>

# ADAPTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSE: T LYMPHOCYTE

Success in heart and lung transplantation requires control over the immune response to donor HLA antigens expressed by the allograft. An adaptive response is initiated by T lymphocytes primed to donor antigens in the peripheral lymphoid tissues and are then recruited into the donor organ where those antigens are expressed. Alloreactive T lymphocytes are primed by alloantigens presented to them on donor (direct) and/or host (indirect) antigen-presenting cells

(APCs) (Fig. 59-3). T-cells are the primary immune actors in the pathologic reaction to a transplanted organ. They participate in cytotoxicity and cytokine-mediated inflammation. B cells, antibodies, and macrophages contribute to the destruction of the graft via a variety of effector pathways. Ischemia/reperfusion injury of the allograft triggers innate immunity that can amplify T-cell alloresponse. Molecular modulators of innate immunity have recently been an expanding area of interest. These include cytokines, chemokines, complement, and more recently toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the inflammasome. While APCs are emphasized, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells exert influence on a host's decision to reject an allograft. <sup>13</sup>

# T-Lymphocyte Alloactivation

A T-cell can only become triggered to proliferate and differentiate if its TCR finds a fit with foreign peptides bound in the groove of HLA molecules presented on the surface of APCs. 14 "Professional" APCs differ from other HLA-expressing cells in that they also express "co-stimulatory" molecules that efficiently stimulate activation of both the APC and the responding T-cell. These include dendritic cells, B lymphocytes, and macrophages. The peptide HLA antigen complex may be presented by resident donor "passenger" APCs found in the transplanted heart or lung (direct presentation) or by the *host's* APCs (indirect presentation) (Fig. 59-4). HLA-peptide antigens become the specific key that fits into a T-cell's specific TCR receptor. In the thymus, T-cells learn to enable their TCR to recognize self-HLA complexes that present endogenous peptides (positive selection). Those cells that recognize self-peptides with a high affinity are deleted

**FIGURE 59-4** T cells are stimulated to proliferate when their TCR engages donor peptides processed and presented by an HLA molecule, expressed by donor or host antigen presenting cells (APCs).

(negative selection) so as to reduce the risk of their driving autoimmunity. T-cells that cannot bind self-protein HLA die from neglect. Positive selection occurs only for those T-cells whose affinity for self-protein HLA result in survival but not full proliferation. The T-cell repertoire emerging from the thymus can respond to proteins from various foreign origins (bacteria, viral, transplant). T-cells react against alloantigens because of the crossreactivity of the TCR with self and foreign HLA molecules. Host and passenger donor dendritic cells are thought to be the most efficient type of APCs for activating naive T-cells.

# Pathways of Antigen Presentation to Alloreactive T-cells (Signal 1)

Donor passenger APCs transplanted with the heart or lung directly process endogenous HLA-derived peptides from within themselves and present them in a groove on surface Class I HLA complexes on their surfaces (Fig. 59-5A). Class I protein MHC complexes presented on the donor-derived APCs (key) fit into the TCR (lock) expressed by recipient CD8+ T-lymphocytes. This activation pathway, known as the direct pathway of peptide presentation, is responsible for the majority of initial T-cell activation reacting to alloantigens and thought to mediate most early events of acute cell-mediated cytotoxicity. <sup>15</sup>

Later alloresponses are focused on CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells because they recognize donor-specific HLA peptides presented by Class II surface molecules expressed by *recipient* APCs. These recipient APCs gradually replace donor APCs transplanted with the heart or lungs of the donor. Host APCs trafficking through the allograft phagocytose interstitial and cellular HLA protein antigens shed from the donor graft (Fig. 59-5B). This shedding is induced when the graft is stressed by ischemia (preservation), inflammation (bacterial and viral infection), and during rejection. Donor proteins undergo endosomic proteolysis and resulting peptides are combined with Class II HLA molecules. Donor peptide Class II HLA complexes are transported to the surface of the host APC and presented indirectly as the "key" to the TCR complex "lock" on CD4\* T-cells. These T-cells then become activated by the indirect pathway. Because CD4\* T-cells provide help to donor-specific B cells, later alloresponses tend to be associated with appearance of alloantibody. 16

In addition to the direct and indirect pathways, a third pathway of antigen presentation involves the transfer of donor cell membrane components, including donor peptide-MHC complexes, to recipient APCs. Transfer can happen by direct cell-cell contact or through the release of very small particles (exosomes) by donor cells, which fuse with recipient APC cell membranes. This process known as the *semi-direct* pathway of antigen presentation pathway leads to presentation, by recipient APCs, of the same strongly crossreactive donor MHC/peptide that drive direct presentation. <sup>17</sup> Finally, it is helpful to distinguish the role of these pathways in the priming versus the effector phase of immune responses. <sup>18</sup>

Activated dendritic cells also provide co-stimulators to the naïve T-cells that are required for a full T-cell response. Macrophages present antigens to differentiated CD4<sup>+</sup> cells that activate the macrophage to promote cell-mediated immunity. B cells also serve an APC function by presenting antigens to helper T-cells. These then activate the B cell to become part of the effector humoral immune response through production of antibodies (Fig. 59-6).<sup>19</sup>

# Pathways of T-Cell Co-Stimulation: Signal 2

In addition to activation of the T-cell by engagement of its TCR with donor peptide/MHC complexes expressed by donor or recipient APCs (Signal 1), several other surface molecules participate in T-cell activation. Those that enhance TCR signaling (CD4 and CD8 molecules expressed by CD4+ and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells, respectively) are called *co-receptors* because they bind to part of the same HLA molecule that engages the TCR. Another group of T-cell activating surface molecules is called *co-stimulatory* receptors (Signal 2) (Fig. 59-7). Blockade of co-stimulatory pathways provides important new possible therapy to prolong organ transplant survival and even reach a tolerant state. Co-stimulatory receptors or ligands on T-cells recognize respective cognitive ligands or receptors presented on APCs or the graft tissue itself. The best defined co-stimulatory receptor and ligand pair is the constitutively expressed CD28 T-cell co-stimulatory receptor and its APC ligands B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86). This pathway is particularly important in activation of naïve

(nonmemory) T-cells. When engaged, these pairs deliver antiapoptotic signals and trigger the expression of cytokines and growth factors, including Interleukin-2 (IL-2) that encourage proliferation of alloantigen-specific CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells. If CD28 is blocked, T-cells may become anergic or apoptose. A second inducible co-stimulatory receptor for B7 molecules has been identified and termed CTLA-4 (CD152). Unlike the structurally homologous CD28, CTLA-4 appears on recently activated T-cells and is a negative regulator that promotes pathways that limit proliferation. It is efficient that the same co-stimulator (B7) can prompt initial proliferative signals via constitutive CD28 engagement and later, when CTLA-4 is induced, subsequently limit signals to the T-cell. Therapeutic targeting of this pathway with CD80 and CD86 blockade with CTLA-4-Ig-like molecules has been effective in primates and multiple clinical trials,<sup>20</sup> and was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the prevention of acute rejection in adult kidney transplant patients in 2011. Inducible co-stimulator (ICOS) and programmed death-1 (PD-1) are more recent discoveries in the T-cell CD28 family. When ICOS joins its ligand ICOS-L on an activated APC, it stimulates the T-cell effector response by promoting IL-4 and IL-10 production. PD-1 is the co-receptor for PD-ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2) and, like CTLA-4, represses T-cell responses.<sup>21</sup>

A second family of co-stimulatory molecules belong to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) super family.<sup>22</sup> The prototypic pathway is represented by the co-stimulatory receptor CD40 on APC binding to CD40 ligand (CD154) on T-cells. By reciprocal activation, CD154 on T-cells makes the APC "better" and is thought to "license" additional APCs to participate in the T-cell activation process. CD154 can also interact with CD40 expressed by CD8+ T-cells thereby providing direct help from CD4+ to CD8+ T-cells.<sup>23</sup> Moreover, transplantation immunobiology is influenced by the innate immunity directors against substances from microbes, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. These substances, often nucleic acids, are called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). PAMPs can bind to PAMP-receptors on APCs called TLRs. This engagement has the effect of strengthening the APC

FIGURE 59-5A Direct presentation of Class I HLA donor antigen by donor APCs. Donor-derived APCs (dendritic cells within the transplant) ubiquitinate an endogenous cytosolic (donor) protein and transport it through the proteasome where it is digested. Small proteins move with transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) into the endoplasmic reticulum where it becomes associated with Class I HLA α-chain. The protein HLA complex locates on the surface of the APC where CD8 $^{+}$  T-cells with TCR "locks" specific for the protein-HLA complex "keys" can associate. The association prompts CD8 $^{+}$  T-cell activation.

FIGURE 59-5B Indirect Class II HLA donor-antigen presentation by host APCs. Extracellular protein antigen shed from the heart or lung allograft is taken into a host APC by endocytosis. The protein is proteolyzed and transported into the Golgi. There it displaces the invariant chain held α and β-chain Class II HLA molecule. The digested protein molecule finds its specific place within the HLA molecule and is moved to the APC surface where it can specifically adhere to a CD4 $^+$  T-cell. The attached CD4 $^+$  T-cell with donor-specific TCR is stimulated to proliferate and participate in the alloresponse.

#### B cell activation—antibody production

FIGURE 59-6 CD4\* T lymphocytes are specifically activated by donor peptide proteins presented on APC peptide-HLA complexes. These T-cells in turn activate B lymphocytes expressing specific HLA Class II molecules and CD40. The B cells respond to growth factors by proliferation formation of germinal centers and production of specific alloantibody.

![](_page_6_Figure_2.jpeg)

FIGURE 59-7 The process of regulating T-cell (CD4\* and CD8\*) activation involves engagement of the TCR/CD4 or CD8 with the foreign protein-HLA molecule and of several co-stimulators of the co-stimulatory pathway. The constitutively expressed CD28 co-receptor drives proliferation of naïve T-cells when engaged by its ligand B7-1. Inducible CTLA-4 (CD154) co-regulator acts to regulate this process negatively along with its APC-bound B7-2 ligand. Other CD28 family co-receptors include inducible ICOS that signals for proinflammatory IL-4 and IL-10 effector responses and PD-1 that has a negative regulatory effect on the T-cell. The APC is made "better" by a reciprocal activation between T-cells and APCs and the phenomena of "licensing" in which innate receptors (PAMP—Toll receptor) stimulate B7 expression. This has the effect also on the T-cell of inducing CD40 ligand (CD154). CD40 on the APC's membrane drives additional B7 expression and elaboration of IL-12.

response, in part by increasing the expression of co-stimulatory molecules and proinflammatory cytokines, thereby strengthening signal 2.

Additional co-stimulatory molecules were recently discovered and alternative therapeutic approaches are being evaluated in experimental models. <sup>24,25</sup> In addition to promoting full T-cell activation, co-stimulatory signals are also crucially involved in cellular interactions between T and B cells, in which B cells receive *help* from T-cells to become fully activated and differentiate in memory B cells and antibody-producing plasma cells.

# MECHANISMS OF GRAFT REJECTION Cell-Mediated Rejection

Early cell-mediated rejection (CMR) begins with activation of CD8+ cells that bear TCR molecules which fit and engage donor-specific peptide-HLA Class I complexes on donor APCs. In the presence of help from CD4+ T-cells, they become cytolytic lymphocytes (CTLs) and directly attach to and kill graft endothelial and parenchymal cells bearing the identical donor peptide-HLA Class I complex presented to them by the APC "activators." This is known as the *direct effector pathway* (distinct from direct presentation of HLA

by donor APC) since the CD8 cell directly kills the allotarget. It is responsible for most acute CMR early (in the first few months) after transplant. In the presence of calcium, the protein perforin polymerizes onto the Class I bearing target cell and causes 16- to 20-nm pores to open in the cell membrane and allowing the CTL to release its granular content, including granzyme B and other cytotoxic molecules directly into the target cell, causing its apoptosis. Alternatively, apoptosis (programmed cell death) can also be stimulated in the target cell by interaction of the lymphocyte Fas ligand with the APO-1/Fas receptor of the target cell. Second messengers are elicited that activate endonucleases and proteases to cause fragmentation of DNA and thus organize the dissolution of the Class I bearing donor target cell (Fig. 59-8).

Unlike the CD8+ T-cells, the CD4+ T-cells primarily follow an *indirect effector pathway* (distinct from indirect presentation of HLA by recipient APC) by secreting various cytokines that drive inflammation and graft loss (Fig. 59-9). IL-2 increases the expression of its own receptors (IL-2R) on CD4+ T-cells, driving their proliferation and further differentiation. Activated CD4+ T-cells secrete additional lymphokines, including interferon-γ (IFNγ), which along with IL-2 stimulates CD8+ CTLs to bind to the allograft cells presenting donor MHC protein molecules. CD4+ T-cells are very heterogeneous. Four major categories are now recognized: Th1, Th2, Th17, and

![](_page_7_Figure_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 59-8** Complicated scheme of allograft rejection. CD8+ lymphocytes become activated by donor-derived dendritic cells transplanted with the allograft. These cells enter a direct alloresponse pathway by proliferating into CTLs. The CTLs recognize and attach to Class I HLA donor peptide molecules on the surface of allograft cells. They directly kill the allotarget through cell-mediated cytotoxicity by injection of proteolytic granules, creating perforin-induced membrane pores and induction of apoptosis. CD4+ T-cells are activated by host APCs that engulf donor protein shed from the allograft. The host APCs process the donor protein into surface-bound Class II HLA peptide molecules. The CD4 cells follow an indirect pathway in the alloresponse by proliferating and secreting growth factors plus proinflammatory cytokines. This indirect paracrine function augments CTL proliferation, attracts cellular mediators of inflammation-like macrophages and drives B cell central humoral immunity.

regulatory T-cells (Tregs). Th1 cells are the main mediators of CMR. They produce IFN $\gamma$  and favor IL-12 production by macrophages. Th2 cells make IL-4, 5, and 13 and promote humoral responses. Th17 produces IL-17, a cytokine recently discovered and involved in inflammation. In conditions where the immune response is partially inhibited, Tregs develop with the ability to inhibit immune responses.

# **Broad Alloresponse**

In severe rejection, B cells join the alloresponse when they receive help from CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells (Fig. 59-6). CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells are activated by APCs to express CD40L (CD154). Ligand B cells

expressing CD40 and MHC Class II receptors engage helper CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells and proliferate. B cells participate in the rejection of allografts by efficiently providing APC function to helper CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells and by elaboration of antibodies that (1) recognize and destroy the donor endothelial targets; (2) participate in antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC), or (3) stimulate the proliferation and migration of activated endothelial cells.<sup>26</sup> In the former, the endothelial antigen/antibody complexes activate the "classical" complement pathway, causing C3 and C5 to cleave, inciting inflammation (C5a) and formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), which is comprised of C5b complexed with C6, 7, 8, and 9 (C5b-9). The MAC causes vascular cell death by inducing pores to form in the cell

membrane. When endothelial cells are activated or killed by complement, this in turn results in microvascular thrombosis and inflammation. ADCC describes the process by which antidonor IgG antibodies coating donor cells bind to the Fc $\gamma$  RIII receptor of NK lymphocytes (NK cell). Cells of the innate immune system such as NK cells are also present in allografts during rejection. These may react with alloantigens because they constitutively express inhibiting receptors specific for self-HLA Class I molecules or they may engage alloantibody-bound target (donor) cells through their Fc $\gamma$  receptor. NK cells can not only directly kill target cells by injecting proteolytic enzymes into their cytoplasm, but also modulate immunity by producing proinflammatory cytokines like IFN $\gamma$  (Fig. 59-8).

# **Memory T-Cells**

With improvement in immunosuppression that limits activation of naïve T-cells, donor-reactive memory cells have been recognized as a previously underappreciated risk to the allograft. This group of donor-reactive cells has an "effector memory" phenotype. This is defined by an immediate and strong recall that is less sensitive to co-stimulation blockade. Memory cells are thought to arise from heterologous immunity. This occurs when there is a resemblance between microbial antigens and donor HLA complex antigens. Some CD4\* and CD8\* cells exposed to Epstein Barr, Herpes Simplex, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) become primed to recognize allogenic HLA molecules. Memory T-cell numbers are proportionately increased following lymphoablative treatment with rabbit ATG or Alemtuzumab (anti-CD52 Ab). It is unclear

whether these memory cells are more resistant to depletion or whether they represent a conversion from naïve T-cells during repopulation. Memory CD4+ cells provide help for the alloresponse. They provide growth and proinflammatory factors that affect CD8+ T-cells and B-cell antibody production. They can illicit the proinflammatory response from nodal-bearing tissue remote from the allograft. Memory CD4+ cells recruit CD8+ cells that infiltrate the allograft across the endothelium. The memory CD8+ cells proliferate and recruit macrophages, neutrophils, and additional activated T effector cells into the donor organ. To date, memory T-cells continue to evade efforts of therapeutic targeting. LFA-1 is one target that is under study for this purpose. Memory T cells are very heterogeneous and have multiple functions.

# **Antibody-Mediated Rejection**

AMR may be defined as a form of acute graft rejection phenotypically characterized by evidence of tissue damage mediated by antigraft antibodies as effectors. The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Working Group has codified specific criteria for cardiac AMR.<sup>28,29</sup> They include clinical evidence of DSA within the recipient, endomyocardial biopsy immunopathologic evidence of complement (specifically C4d and C3d) staining, and endothelial cell and macrophage activation (the latter assessed by CD68 staining). Similar features of AMR have been identified in the lung, although less consensus exists (Figs 59-9 and 59-10).<sup>30</sup>

Although B/plasma cell production of DSA is the essential pathophysiologic mechanism underlying AMR, T-cell

FIGURE 59-10 Specific C4d deposition on a lung transplant allograft in a recipient with circulating HLA antibody is continuous and subendothelial in capillaries and small arterioles (left). Specific C4d has been seen on 31% of transbronchial biopsies in recipients with HLA-Ab. (Ionescu D.N., Transplant Immunology 15(2005) 63-68) (middle). In contrast, nonspecific staining of the interstitium and elastic layer is depicted (right). (Used with permission from K.R. McCurry, M.D.)

help directs and/or influences AMR;<sup>31,32</sup> consequently, AMR should not be thought of as T cell-independent. DSA may be "preformed," that is, present prior to transplantation (see discussion of crossmatching and percent reactive antibody [PRA]), or develop de novo posttransplantation. It has been shown that DSA are identified temporally prior to pathological evidence of AMR<sup>33</sup> and the development of anticardiac myosin immune responses.<sup>34</sup>

Presensitization to HLA Class I or Class II antibodies predisposes to AMR.35 Those recipients who develop presensitized antibodies, especially donor-specific, risk AMR.<sup>36</sup> In addition to anti-HLA antibodies, non-HLA antibodies, including those against self-antigens such as cardiac myosin, vimentin, and endothelial cells have been less often associated with AMR.37-39 Cardiac AMR occurs early (weeks to months) after transplant and, if avoided early, rarely occurs later. 40 Classically, histological diagnosis of cardiac AMR has included evidence of endothelial swelling and activation macrophages in the graft plus confirming immunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase staining for immunoglobulin (IgG or IgM). While absence of immunofluorescence seems reasonable to rule out AMR, capillary swelling (63%) and macrophage vascular adherence (30%)<sup>41</sup> and complement (C3d and C4d) do not. Non-AMR causes of C4d staining include organ reperfusion injury, immunosuppression, treatment with monoclonal antibodies, and viral infections.<sup>42</sup> The distribution (diffuse vs localized) and intensity of the stains has not found a standardization for grading.

The incidence of AMR after heart or lung transplantation is uncertain due to a lack of universal screening in asymptomatic recipients. Symptomatic pure AMR without a component of acute cellular rejection occurs in 10 to 15% of cardiac transplant recipients, but AMR features have been reported in up to 40% of patients with acute cellular rejection (mixed rejection). Clinical symptoms of cardiac AMR are those common in heart failure using echo. A >25% decrease

in ejection fraction and an increase in left ventricular mass distinguished AMR from CMR.<sup>44</sup> Reduced R-wave voltage-conduction abnormalities, including bundle branch block, are electrocardiographic associates.

# **Desensitization Therapy**

Once unacceptable antigens are determined from solid-phase assay (SPA), they can be entered into the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) website (www.unos.org/resources/frm\_CPRA\_calculator.ASP). This will provide the calculated percent reactive antibody (cPRA). If the percentage chance that any donor is acceptable for transplantation is <50%, then it is reasonable to initiate a desensitization protocol. An optimal protocol has not been established. High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (2 g/kg/over 2 days q 2-4 weeks), plasmapheresis (1.5 volume exchange  $\times$  5 days), monoclonal anti-CD20 B-cell therapy (rituximab 1 g IV weekly  $\times$  4), and in the past cyclophosphamide (1 mg/kg/day) have been used in various combinations.

At UCLA, plasmapheresis, IVIG, and rituximab reduced circulatory antibody levels from 70.5 to 30.2%. Heart transplantation of these candidates after negative complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) resulted in similar five-year outcomes to control patients and untreated but high PRA patients (81.1, 75.7, and 71.4%). Of interest, the freedom from coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV) was 74.3, 72.7, and 76.2%, respectively.<sup>45</sup>

It has been agreed that patients waiting for transplantation with circulating HLA antibodies should be studied every three months, and those desensitized every two weeks after therapy. Patients on ventricular assist devices or who receive blood transfusions or with infections should be closely monitored as well. After transplantation donor-specific antibody monitoring is recommended at regular intervals and when a humoral rejection event is suspected. Donor-specific titers should be

measured daily for 1 to 2 weeks and frequently thereafter in desensitized patients and those considered high risk for antibody response. This higher risk group of recipients is generally treated with thymoglobulin plus IVIG, plasmapheresis, and/or rituximab. Maintenance immunosuppressive therapy that has best controlled cellular and AMR includes tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and prednisone.<sup>46</sup>

Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of a multipronged approach to the treatment of DSA and AMR. The various components of this approach may suppress DSA production, deplete levels of already generated DSA, or modulate the functionality of DSA in vivo. Glucocorticoids induce B (and T) cell apoptosis, 47 while antiproliferative agents reduce B and T cell generation in the bone marrow. The anti-CD20 monoclonal Ab (mAb) rituximab depletes B cells from the circulation as well as secondary lymphoid organs; most institutional regimens for AMR treatment use rituximab.<sup>48</sup> Similarly, the anti-CD52 mAb alemtuzumab depletes both T and B cells, and has been used to treat AMR.<sup>49</sup> Although preclinical studies of anti-T cell co-stimulation agents such as belatacept (CTLA4-Ig) have shown efficacy in treating solid organ AMR,50 little evidence is present with respect to thoracic organ AMR clinically.

The therapies above have been shown to reduce DSA and improve AMR. However, none has demonstrated consistent ability to deplete or impair plasma cells, which are generated from differentiated effector B cells are the primary source of antibody (and thus DSA) production. Recent studies have utilized the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in the treatment of DSA/AMR,<sup>51</sup> with initial successes. Plasmapheresis reduces circulating general antibody and DSA levels, and is also part of most institutional regimens for the treatment of AMR.<sup>52</sup> Exogenous immunoglobulin (Ig) may compete with DSA for Fc receptor binding sites, impairing opsonization.<sup>53</sup> In addition, some amount of Ig may have anti-DSA idiotype specificity, thereby inhibiting DSA (and source B/ plasma cell) activity. Finally, with respect to modulation of DSA functionality, novel complement-inhibiting drugs such as the anti-C5 mAb eculizumab have shown promise in kidney AMR, with one case report of usage for hyperacute lung allograft rejection.<sup>54</sup>

### Coronary Allograft Vasculopathy and Chronic Cardiac Allograft Dysfunction/ Rejection

Although heart transplantation continues to be the therapeutic gold standard for the management of end-stage heart disease, in terms of patient survival outcomes, functional capacity, and cardiac function, its durability is principally limited by chronic cardiac allograft dysfunction. Chronic dysfunction of the transplanted heart is at least associated with and thought to be due to acquired coronary arteriopathy.<sup>55</sup>

Coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV) and resultant ischemic cardiac allograft dysfunction constitute the leading cause of allograft loss and patient mortality in heart transplant recipients after one year.<sup>28</sup> CAV is characterized by coronary

arterial wall thickening with progressive lumen compromise, which is typically diffuse, both with respect to epicardial large vessel involvement and the presence of outflow/runoff small vessel disease.<sup>56</sup>

Similar to chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) in lung transplantation, a combination of allo-specific adaptive and innate immune stimuli and responses (see section on CLAD below) result in local vascular inflammation and damage of cardiac allografts. Both T and B cell responses have been implicated in the pathogenesis of CAV.<sup>57</sup> Endothelial cells may also function as professional Ag presenting cells and, consistent with this, inducibly express MHC Class II in the context of inflammation.<sup>58</sup> Thus with respect to direct alloantigen recognition, not only are antidonor HLA Class II-specific T-cells important in mediating CAV, but so too are antidonor HLA Class II-specific T-cells. In addition, antibodies directed against donor MHC and other endothelial antigens are known to be important to the development of CAV.<sup>59-61</sup>

Recently, it has been recognized that similarities between CAV and atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) have implications for the pathogenesis of CAV. Specifically, innate immune system-mediated vessel wall inflammation and damage is present in both settings, with resultant medial proliferation and even lipid deposition. Inflammatory signaling mediated by TLRs has been shown to facilitate CAV in experimental model systems.<sup>62</sup> Consistent with this, preclinical data suggest that antiproliferative agents may attenuate CAV. Sirolimus, which along with related mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors are the majority of agents used in drug-eluding stents (DES), has exhibited promising results in preventing and treating CAV, either as systemic therapy<sup>63</sup> or in DES used for percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) in instances of stenoses amenable to PCI.<sup>64</sup> In addition, the statin HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and other drugs that regulate lipid metabolism have shown some promise in preclinical experimental studies.<sup>65</sup>

# Chronic Lung Allograft Dysfunction and Chronic Rejection

Lung transplantation is hampered by relatively poor, long-term recipient survival, which is principally due to progressive CLAD. CLAD is due to fibrous obliteration of small airways termed obliterative bronchiolitis and the recently included restrictive allograft syndrome. 66

Both allo-specific and nonallo-specific injurious stimuli are capable of triggering immune responses and mediate allograft damage. Allo-specific stimuli with resultant allospecific immune responses historically have been the primary focus of immunologic investigation, and thus are the best understood.

Nonallo-specific injury may also trigger allo-specific or nonallo-specific immune responses. Infection and aspiration of gastric contents clearly induce lung injury, and some experimental studies of gastric acid-induced lung allograft injury in a unilateral lung transplant model have demonstrated disproportionate or exclusive damage to the allograft, suggestive of an allo-specific component to the immune response elicited against the generalized inflammatory stimulus. With respect to T-cell—mediated immunity, this may be due to enhanced exposure of donor MHC or MHC fragments, resulting in heightened TCR engagement and Signal 1 or inflammation-induced enhancement of expression and/or activity of co-stimulatory molecules on donor or recipient antigen-presenting cells, Signal 2. Finally, nonallo-specific injurious stimuli, such as ischemia/reperfusion injury, infection, and reflux-induced aspiration, for induce activation of the innate (nonadaptive) immune system. Ischemia/reperfusion injury is linked to subsequent development of CLAD, whereas the latter two mechanisms induce lung injury that is not restricted to the allograft.

### Immunologic Tolerance

Generally, the T-cell repertoire is edited during T-cell development in the thymus to delete clones that are self-reactive (central tolerance). Mechanisms responsible for tolerance to transplant-specific HLA antigens not present in the thymus occur in the periphery (*peripheral tolerance*). These include cell death of alloreactive T-cells by apoptosis (deletion), induction of functional unresponsiveness (anergy or ignorance), and active regulation of alloimmunity by either donor-antigenspecific or nondonor-antigen-specific mechanisms (regulation). Partial anergy has been induced by exposing CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells to MHC antigen in the absence of co-stimulation,<sup>68</sup> although it influences naive responses rather than those of memory. Much of the current interest has been in better understanding of a subset of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells called regulatory T-cells (Tregs) whose function is to suppress immune responses and to maintain tolerance of "self." 69,70 Natural Tregs develop in the thymus in response to self-antigens and are important in autoimmunity. In addition, upon antigen exposure in the periphery, CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells can convert to a regulatory phenotype forming a population of inducible (iTregs), recently renamed peripheral Tregs (pTregs).<sup>71</sup> TGF-β, IL-2, and B7/CTLA-4 co-stimulation are required for nTreg production and survival. It remains to be fully elucidated how these molecules direct naïve T-cells to differentiate into effector, memory, or regulatory phenotypes under various clinically relevant circumstances. Most Tregs express the IL-2 receptor  $\alpha$  chain (CD25) and the transcription factor Foxp3. nTregs but not pTregs are thought to express the transcription factor Helios. 70 Foxp3 is a forkhead family transcription factor important for Treg-suppressive function but is also found in activated T-cells in man and thus is not specific to identify human Tregs. Additional markers are used to identify Tregs, such as CD127 (IL-7Rα) and CD45RA. Finally, analysis of spontaneously tolerant kidney recipients has demonstrated a subset of B-cell genes associated with an upregulation of CD20 mRNA.<sup>72</sup>

There has been limited success in translation of laboratory rodent-based tolerance protocols in clinical practice. Freedom from immunosuppression rarely is accomplished universally in strictly controlled large animal models. Management of

preexisting memory cells not inhibited by blockage of costimulation appears to be a major hurdle. Finally, redundant effector cell mechanisms, cytokines, and co-stimulatory pathways make single or even dual approaches seem underpowered to establish tolerance in the clinic. There has been a limited number of patients in whom tolerance was induced by a regimen, inducing a mixed allogeneic chimerism (coexistence of recipient and donor cells) for kidney allografts. However, work in the nonhuman primate model showed that even this highly tolerogenic regimen did not induce tolerance to cardiac allografts. Heart and lung allografts are less easily amenable to tolerance than kidney, in other words, are more immunogenic. Heart and lung allografts are more immunogenic.

# **HLA Antibody Analysis**

#### SEROLOGICAL TESTING

The serological lymphocytotoxic assay for antibody "screening" is based on mixing patient serum (unknown) with a panel of cells whose HLA typing is known and adding complement (or CDC assay). If antibodies are present in the patient serum that react with the cell's HLA molecules, cell death occurs due to complement activation. This method is limited to detection of antibodies represented by the panel of antigens tested and by issues of sensitivity and accuracy. The specificity of the antigen to which the antibody is reacting (HLA or non-HLA antibody) is sometimes not clear due to the presence of other proteins in the patient serum, or to the antibody isotype (IgG or IgM, etc.; some antibody isotypes do not fix complement), and the titer (low, high) is not determined. Several enhancements of this assay were developed to address these issues: (1) heat or chemical treatment of the patient serum to inactivate IgM antibodies and identify IgG antibodies which were felt to be more important to outcomes; (2) additional washes of the target cells following incubation of the patients serum to "wash off" the nonspecific reactants, and (3) addition of antihuman globulin (AHG) to the reaction to increase the detection of low titer IgG antibody (CDC-AHG method). There are other subvariations of these serological enhancements.

The antibody-screening assay consists of a "panel" of known HLA-typed cells, with each cell representing a unique set of antigen targets for the serum to react. The assay generates the "panel reactive antibody (PRA)" titer, which is reported out as a percent of the prospective donor pool that would likely be killed by the patient's serum. The result of this analysis is termed percent calculated PRA or %cPRA. The % cPRA gives a better indication of the patient's likelihood of having a compatible offer of a UNOS deceased donor organ because it is based upon actual UNOS-typed donors. The panel may consist of any number of cells; however, minimally, cells from at least 30 carefully selected individuals are needed to cover the most common HLA antigen targets. In addition to the %PRA, the specificity of the antigen targets could be identified based upon the individual cell reactions. The more different HLA antigens to which the patient is sensitized, the higher the %PRA and the less likely the patient is to have a compatible donor identified. Using conventional

matching criteria, %PRA >10% and >25% have been associated with incrementally lower survival large registry reports.

Despite the use of enhancing techniques, serological antibody screening and methods of identification are not able to detect reliably low levels of HLA antibody, and are relatively poor for characterizing Class II antibody.

#### SOLID PHASE FLOW CYTOMETRIC ANALYSIS

With the development of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique in the 1990s, testing with HLA antigen proteins testing could be performed. SPA were then developed in which a specific recombinant HLA protein antigen could be bound to the "solid" surface of a plate, well and now beads.

The development of solid-phase, "microbead"-based flow cytometry assays represent a monumental improvement from the initial solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay antibody screening and techniques for identification. The use of fluorescent dyes is foremost as report molecules, allowing detection of the antigen-antibody reactions using a flow cytometer. Fluorescent dye light emissions are several-fold more sensitive than colorimetric dyes. The detection of the antibody-antigen reaction is made using beads coated with HLA molecules. Each HLA molecule-specific bead is identified by its unique mixture of two fluorescent dye colors incorporated into the bead. A secondary antihuman antibody is conjugated to a reporter molecule, in this case, to a fluorescent dye of another color. The higher the titer of the antibody in the patient's serum, the more antibody is available to react to the antigen conjugated to the bead, and the more intense is binding of the secondary fluoresceinated antibody. The more reporter dye becomes bound to the bead complex, the more fluorescent emission is produced from the bead when analyzed by the flow cytometer. The fluorescent emission signal of each bead type is then averaged and the normalized value is reported as the "mean fluorescence intensity (MFI)" of the bead. For most laboratories, the MFI value ≥ 1000 is considered to be a positive reaction for the presence of the HLA antibody. This cutoff was derived as twice the MFI value for the negative control serum.

SPAs can now be used to classify heart and lung candidates as having no HLA antibodies, HLA antibodies without donor specificity or those with donor-specific HLA antibodies (DSA).

The HLA antigen is sourced from recombinant cell lines and is conjugated directly to the microbead, not simply captured. This allowed manufacturing of beads coated not only with the antigens of a single individual mimicking a cell ("multiantigen beads"), but also with a single HLA antigen ("single-antigen beads"). These single antigens can be further described to the exact HLA allele of that antigen. Since individuals become sensitized to the amino acid epitopes encoded by the antigen allele, microbead-based antibody analysis opened a completely new level of insight into characterizing antibodies contained in patient serum. This process is called "epitope mapping." In combination with allele-level typing of patients and potential donors, epitope mapping of antibodies can better predict outcomes of transplants in highly

sensitized patients. The flow cytometer instrument may be either a larger instrument, which can acquire data from cells or beads, or a mini-flow cytometer, which only acquires data from beads, such as a Luminex instrument (Fig. 59-11).

The results of the serum antibody test and the donor crossmatch are interpreted together as a final assessment of recipient and donor compatibility. Composite MFI values of 4000 or greater are generally predictive of a positive flow crossmatch. This composite MFI value is derived from the "sum of MFI values" and the single-antigen antibody analysis for "each" donor target antigen present, either Class I or Class II. This is a rule of thumb, as cellular expression of these target antigens varies. Most centers will post unacceptable antigens in UNOS for those single antigens with MFI values of 4000 or greater, since these single antigens alone may result in a positive flow crossmatch with donors. Based upon these MFI values, a "virtual" or *in silico* crossmatch can be reliable in predicting the actual cellular crossmatch, especially with high MFI values.

#### **HLA Crossmatch**

#### VIRTUAL CROSSMATCH

Practical realities of matching sensitized candidates with nonlocal donors resulted in the acceptance of the virtual crossmatch (VXM).75,76 The VXM is a comparison of the donor HLA genotype determined by organ procurement organizations to the gene families represented by beads that bound antibody from the sensitized candidate recipient. If gene families are shared between donor and the bead, the VXM is positive. For example, a candidate with antibodies against A1, A11, and B7 by Luminex single-antigen beads would be incompatible with a donor typed as A11, A25, B55, and B57.77 The anti-A1 antibody determined by SPA corresponds to the donor-typed A1. While currently there is no method to determine the functional characteristics of the antibodies, recently it was estimated that the positive predicative value of an incompatible VXM compared with cytotoxic crossmatch was nearly 80%. UNOS has standardized HLA molecular data typing to include HLA A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1. Most centers refuse nonlocal donors based on an incompatible VXM and insist on a prospective CDC-AHG crossmatch for sensitized patients when possible.

#### Non-HLA Antibodies

It has become increasingly clear that non-HLA antibodies can cause injury in thoracic organ transplants. Res. About 16% of HLA antibody negative heart recipients may lose their graft to the mixed diagnosis of primary failure within 30 days of transplant. Res. SPA does not detect non-HLA antibodies, but flow cytometry methods can detect MICA/B. Antibodies-to-donor endothelial antigens are the largest poorly discussed group of clinically important non-HLA antibodies. These include endothelial, auto-antibodies and those to MHC Class I chain A (MICA) and B (MICB). Endothelial antigen targets may exist, constitutively or as induced auto-antigens

![](_page_13_Figure_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 59-11** Solid-phase microbead-based assays for HLA antibodies have improved sensitivity and specificity of detection. Single HLA antigens from recombinant cell lines are conjugated to a colored microsphere. The bead is reacted against candidate or recipient serum resulting in the specific adherence of circulating antibody to the selected HLA antigen. The microsphere HLA-serum antibody is reacted to an antihuman IgG antibody conjugated to a fluorescent dye. The microsphere complex is channeled through a flow cytometer and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for the combined emitting dye is measured.

due to activation of the endothelium. MICA and MICB are polymorphic antigens expressed on epithelial and, to an unknown extent, on endothelial cells. MICA antibodies may occur in up to 20% of candidates and have been associated with poorer survival but not increased rejection.<sup>80</sup>

"Auto-antibodies" against conserved (nonpolymorphic) proteins are frequently found in the blood of thoracic transplant recipients in association with chronic rejection. Vimentin (an intracellular cytoskeletal protein found in vessel walls and activated lymphocytes), cardiac proteins (cardiac myosin), and collagen type V (expressed mainly in the lung) are among the antigens against which auto-antibodies have been described. Antivimentin antibodies form earlier than anti-HLA after transplantation and are a response in up to 30% of heart recipients to exposure of antigens mounted on the surface of damaged and activated cells. Antivimentin antibodies reflect tissue injury but might also activate platelets and neutrophils. Antiheart antibodies exist preoperatively

in some patients due to their primary cardiac disease. At present, it is difficult to know their true significance. Finally, IgM non-HLA antibodies are cytotoxic and can react to all leukocytes, even the patient's own. Antigen specificity is unknown as is the clinical relevance.

# Gene Expression Profiling: XDx Allomap

A DNA microarray-based real-time PCR-derived biosignature for cardiac rejection has been developed by XDx, the maker of Allomap molecular expression testing. Gene expression profiling (GEP) of circulatory leukocytes measures 11 informative genes associated with ACR and scores their expression detected by PCR technology.<sup>83</sup> Several pathways were identified that participate in regulation of effector cell activation, trafficking and morphology, platelet activation, plus corticosteroid sensitivity. These included PDCD1 and ITGA4 for T-cell activation and migration, ILIR2 steroid-responsive

gene, the decoy for IL-2, and WDR40A plus CMIR of the micro-RNA gene family. Peripheral blood samples are assigned a score with higher numbers associated with progressive risk of lack of immunological quiescence. This approach was recently randomized against surveillance endomyocardial biopsy in a multicenter trial in low-risk rejection cardiac recipients, 6 months to 5 years after transplantation.84 The evaluation excluded recipients with a significant history of rejection, CAV, or allograft dysfunction. Results indicated 14.5% of patients profiled versus 15.3% of those surveilled by endomyocardial biopsy reached a composite endpoint of allograft loss/rejection with hemodynamic compromise, graft dysfunction due to other causes, death, or retransplantation. The low risk for rejection of the enrolled patients made interpretation to earlier and higher risk recipients problematic.85 Other reports found that the profiled genes regulatory T-cell homeostasis and corticosteroid sensitivity can distinguish mild from moderate and severe rejection and are evident before histological, detectable rejection. 86,87 Currently, results of GEP by Allomap suggest surveillance endomyocardial biopsy in low-risk recipients may be avoided.<sup>28,85</sup>

# Functional Activity of Immune System

A long imagined goal of selective treatment based on a quantitative assessment of the net state of immunosuppression has been approached clinically with some success. An assay from peripheral blood has been developed (Cylex, ImmuKnow, Columbia, MD) to measure the intracellular concentration

of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) of activated lymphocytes. ImmuKnow measures T-cell responses by quantifying ATP activity<sup>88</sup> to phytohemaglutinin, a T-cell mitogen. In general, the collective studies suggest that ATP levels < 200 ng/mL correlate with an increased risk of infection.<sup>89</sup> In a study in 296 heart recipients spanning two weeks to 10 years post-transplant, infection in 39 recipients occurred with an average 187 + 126 ng/ATP/mL versus a steady state of 280 + 126 ng/ATP/mL. Rejection scores in eight recipients averaged 328 ng/ATP/mL and did not differ from baseline. However, three of eight with AMR scored 491 versus 280 ng/ATP/mL.<sup>89</sup> This assay opens the field to personalized immunosuppression that might help balance risks of infection and rejection.

### **IMMUNOSUPPRESSION**

Outcomes following heart and lung transplantation have followed the developments in renal and transplant trials of immunosuppressants (Fig. 59-12). Early reliance on high doses of prednisone and the antimetabolic azathioprine permitted enough success for the field to advance but limited the rates of patient survival to well below current standards of more than 10 years for heart and five years for lung. This early regimen was associated with morbid infection and rapidly progressive episodes of acute rejection. Earlier, it was easy to pick out our patients by their steroid-induced Cushingoid appearances, spine and hip fractures, cataracts, and persistent hyperglycemia. Bone marrow suppression was common, and it was always a battle to achieve adequate doses of

**FIGURE 59-12** Individual immunosuppressive drugs and sites of action in the "Three-Signal" T-cell activation model. (Reproduced with pemission from Halloran PF: Immunosuppressive drugs for kidney transplantation, *N Engl J Med.* 2004 Dec 23;351(26):2715-2729.)

azathioprine. In the early 1980s, the situation changed for the patients, and the benefits of thoracic transplantation soared with the introduction of the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine by Starzl and Calne. Current approaches are attempting to more selectively inhibit alloresponse by including targets of the immune active **Signal 2** pathway.

#### **GLUCOCORTICOIDS**

Prednisone is the chief oral glucocorticoid (GC) antiin-flammatory. Effect is mediated by its intracellular block on nuclear factor (NF)- $\kappa$ B pathways. This has the effect of reducing proinflammatory Th<sub>1</sub> cytokines with increase in the Th<sub>2</sub> suppressive secretome and of IL-10. GC affects adaptive immunity by reducing the dendritic APC function, numbers of CD+ cells and, at higher doses, production of anti-HLA antibody. S3.94

Every transplant physician is aware of the heightened risk of increased infection from GC. While bacterial infections are commonly associated, GC also increases the risk of viral and protozoal-based complications. GC reduces innate immunity by effects on neutrophil adherence and trafficking, phagocytosis and expression of proinflammatory mediators. Finally, GC adversely affects wound healing by reducing monocyte numbers and their entry to the wound as monocytes. Monocytes are important to healing due to their expression of growth factors and ability to phagocytose. By limiting fibrocytes, GC further reduces wound healing.

# PURINE ANALOGUES: AZATHIOPRINE AND MYCOPHENOLATE MOFETIL

Early efforts in solid organ transplantation were dependent on the purine analogue 6-mercoptopure (6-MP) and its less toxic drug, azathioprine (Imuran). The metabolite of these days is 6-thioguanine nucleotide (6-TGN). It is incorporated in DNA and RNA and acts antagonistically to endogenous purines necessary for cell cycling.

MMF (Cellcept) and its active metabolite mycophenolic acid alter the purine synthesis by inhibiting inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPHD). This blocks inosine conversion to guanosine nucleotides. MMF is a more selective antimetabolic because lymphocytes are dependent on IMPHD for conversion while other cells have alternate pathways. MMF has generally come to be preferred as the rest of bone marrow and lungs are spared. The targeting of T&B lymphocytes has increased the risk of infection and particularly from CMV.<sup>99-102</sup> The most prominent adverse sites affected by MMF are a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms that can be severe enough to initiate a switch to azathioprine.

# CALCINEURIN INHIBITION: CYCLOSPORINE A AND FK506

Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) impede a critical intracellular signal pathway initiated with activation of the TCR. Usually, calcineurin binds calmodulin to dephosphorylate the nuclear factor of the activated T-cells (NFAT). NFAT

can then translocate into the nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor for a number of immunologically important genes, including those coding for IL-2, -4, -5, TNF $\alpha$  and IFN $\gamma$ . CNIs affect B cells indirectly by their effect on reducing T-cell help. Cyclosporine (CsA) was the first CNI to be introduced and was followed by Tacrolimus (TAC) (FK506). Both affect NFAT but bind to different immunophilins. CsA binds cyclophilins and TAC to FK-binding-proteins (FK-BPs).

CNIs can cause acute and chronic kidney injury. They reduce both tubular and glomerular function via their adverse effect on the aquaporin gene and protein production. <sup>104</sup> Additionally, they are associated with upregulation of renal mesangial cells and of renal fibrosis. <sup>105,106</sup> CNIs are also diabetogenic: they reduce the production and release of insulin and are proapoptotic to islets. <sup>107,108</sup> Severe neurologic complications, ranging from tremor to seizure and coma, have been associated with the use of CNIs. The cause of the neurologic side effects is likely based on multiple known neurologic interactions. <sup>109</sup> Other specific complications include hyperlipedemia, cholestasis, and malignancies especially skin cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. <sup>110</sup>

# **Proliferation Signal Inhibitors**

#### mTOR INHIBITORS: SIROLIMUS, EVEROLIMUS

mTORs are proliferation signal inhibitors (PSI) that inhibit serine/threonine protein kinase which is part of multiple pathways necessary for cell activation, proliferation, and vascular endothelial growth factor production. 111,112 Immune cells with higher metabolic needs depend on mTOR activation. mTOR has also been shown to increase the proinflammatory cytokine output and increase adaptive immune memory. The complex and perhaps contradictory action of mTOR inhibitors (mTORi) make this class of agents interesting. Rapamycin (sirolimus) and everolimus are the clinically available mTORi. Of note, mTORi reduce wound healing to the extent that perioperative use is limited due to concerns regarding healing of midline sternotomy of heart transplant and particularly of the bronchus following lung implant. 113,114 Unlike other immunosuppressants, mTORi decrease tumors associated with transplant, probably due to their global inhibition of angiogenesis and cellular proliferation. These drugs have found a more secondary role as replacement or addition to lowered doses of CNIs for nephrotoxicity, cancer, neurologic complications, and resistant rejection.

#### **Monoclonal Antibodies**

#### ANTI-IL-2R ANTIBODY: BASILIXIMAB

Basiliximab (Simulect) is a human-mouse antibody that targets the IL-2 $\alpha$  chain (anti-CD25). This limits the proliferation T-cell response. This agent can decrease CD25 $^{+}$  T-cells for up to six weeks. <sup>115</sup> It may also affect Treg-suppressive roles as CD4 $^{+}$ /CD25 $^{+}$ /Foxp3 $^{+}$  cells (Treg suppressive) decrease and CD4 $^{+}$ /CD25 $^{-}$ /Foxp3 $^{+}$  cells increase. <sup>115</sup>

#### ANTI-CD20 ANTIBODY: RITUXIMAB

Rituximab depletes mature B cells by complement-mediated cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cell toxicity. It seems also to have proapoptotic activity for B cells. This drug has been used to treat antibody-mediated allograft rejection, but its effect is at best limited. This is because it has little effect on plasma cells or mature antibody-secreting cells that do not express CD20. However, preemptive B-cell depletion at the time of transplant prevented CAV in a primate model<sup>116</sup> and is currently evaluated clinically (CTOT-11).

#### **BORTEZOMIB: VELCADE**

Velcade binds the catalytic site of the 26S proteasome in plasma cells. It is believed that this inhibition prevents degradation of preapoptotic factors. 117 Recently, Velcade has been approved for treatment of multiple myeloma and has been appropriated for persistent AMR of cardiac allografts. Complications include peripheral neuropathy, myelosuppression, and high incidence of varicella zoster infections. It has been successfully used with plasmapheresis to reduce cPRA in cardiac transplant candidates resistant to antibody-reducing treatment with rituximab and plasmapheresis. 118

#### ANTI-CD52 ANTIBODY: ALEMTUZUMAB

Alemtuzumab (Campath) is active against CD52 which is a glycoprotein expressed by T and B lymphocytes, macrophages, monocytes, and NK cells. 119 Cell suppression can last for more than 12 months. This agent has been shown to reduce acute rejection episodes but may increase the risk of cancer. 68 It also has a tricky infection-associated profile due to its deeply and persistently suppressive effect.

#### CTLA4-IG: BELATACEPT

Belatacept (Nulojix) is the prototypic immunoglobulin-fusion protein. This recombinant protein is similar to the soluble form T-cell co-stimulatory receptor CTLA-4<sup>120</sup> and binds B7 ligands. This results in interference of Signal 2 for the CD28-B7 co-stimulation pathway. It is the only biologic used in transplantation to target specific alloimmune co-stimulation immune pathway. Signal 1 TCR activation in the absence of co-stimulation limits T-cell response and can induce T-cell anergy.<sup>121</sup> Belatacept succeeded Abatacept as a higher affinity construct for transplantation and was approved for acute kidney rejection in 2011. 120 This biologic was evaluated in a Phase III study of the Belataceptbased immunosuppression regimen versus cyclosporine in renal transplant recipients (BENEFIT). While renal function and blood pressure and lipid profiles were improved with Belatacept, acute rejection was more common (20% vs 7%) and worse histologically.<sup>122</sup> It has been proposed that memory T-cells are less controlled by co-stimulation blockade.

# **Polyclonal Antibodies**

#### ANTITHYMOCYTE GLOBULIN

Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is a polyclonal mixture of immunoglobulins (IgG) drawn from either rabbits (RATG

or thymoglobulin) or horses (eATG or ATGAM). These IgG predominant preparations are based on animal immunizations with human thymocytes. They recognize multiple targets principally on T lymphocytes. Depletion of cells follows complement-based lysis, ADCC, and apoptosis. <sup>123</sup> Beyond depletion of T-cells, ATG also increases Tregs and depletes and impairs NKs and reduces B cells. <sup>124</sup> Rounding out the broad effects is ATG's interference with the uptake of antigens by DC cells.

RATG is preferred for its effectiveness in reducing rejection.  $^{125}$  It is associated with an increased risk of PTLD and CMV infection due to its broadly reacting immunosuppression  $^{126,127}$ 

# Intravenous Immunoglobulin

IVIG is made from pooled human donor IgG. It has inherent problems with supply, cost, and batch-based variability. It has become part of the regimen for treatment of AMR as it was a proven treatment for autoimmune and diverse inflammatory conditions. Its effectiveness is believed due to presence of anti-idiotypic antibodies and its ability to block complement-binding target cells and molecules. The Fabmediated antigen binding effects of IgG appear to be joined by Fc-dependent immune modulation. 129
