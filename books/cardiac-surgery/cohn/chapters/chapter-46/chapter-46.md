## Reoperative Valve Surgery

Julius I. Ejiofor • John G. Byrne • Marzia Leacche

The number of patients undergoing reoperation for valvular heart disease is increasing and will continue to increase as the general population ages. 1 These reoperations most commonly involve structural deterioration of a bioprosthesis or progression of native-valve disease after nonvalve cardiac surgery. Structural failure of a biologic valve should be considered a part of the natural evolution of tissue valves and should be fully appreciated by both the surgeon and the patient prior to implantation.<sup>2</sup> Reoperations are technically more difficult than primary operations because of adhesions around the heart with an associated risk of reentry, the presence of more advanced cardiac pathology, and the existence of more frequent comorbidities such as pulmonary hypertension. Perhaps most importantly, reoperative valve replacement operations often are performed in functionally compromised patients who tolerate complications poorly or who have little reserve.<sup>3</sup> As a consequence of these and other factors, reoperative valve surgery historically has been associated with a considerably higher operative mortality than primary valve surgery, particularly in patients who have had multiple prior replacements.<sup>4</sup> In the modern era, however, with the use of alternative surgical approaches and advanced perioperative care, there has been significant improvement

Reductions in operative risk and postoperative morbidity after reoperative valve surgery have been made in the past few years through advances in myocardial protection, as well as alternative perfusion strategies such as the proper use of deep hypothermic cardiac arrest. In addition, use of peripheral cannulation techniques to institute cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has become a relatively standard practice in reoperative cases. It also Early institution of CPB prior to reentry prevents injury to the right ventricle (RV) or patent coronary artery bypass grafts during reoperative sternotomy.

Successful replacement of degenerated cardiac valves usually results in symptomatic and hemodynamic improvement. In this regard, improvements in valve design have mitigated but not eliminated primary bioprosthetic failure. <sup>14-16</sup> As such, the risk of re-replacement for bioprosthetic failure remains a significant factor to be considered in the selection of valve type for implantation. <sup>17</sup>

## MECHANICAL VERSUS BIOLOGIC VALVES

The most appropriate valve substitute for an individual patient remains a source of much controversy. This choice should be adapted to each individual patient depending on age, life expectancy, life style, valve size, and cardiac as well as noncardiac comorbidities. 18 Some studies comparing the long-term outcomes between biologic and mechanical aortic valve prostheses have yielded similar results with regard to overall valve-related complications. 19-22 However, most recent large studies have documented that anticoagulant-related bleeding with mechanical valves must be balanced against life expectancy and the risk of biologic valve re-replacement. 23-25 Bioprosthetic valves are known to undergo a time-dependent process of structural deterioration that results in freedom of reoperation of 80% at 15 years.<sup>20</sup> Consequently, structural degeneration of a bioprosthesis is the most frequent indication for reoperation in patients with tissue valves. 19,26

Despite this, recently improved durability of tissue valves, as well as the availability of stentless valves and homografts, has led to surgeons placing bioprostheses in progressively younger age groups. <sup>18,27-30</sup> Contributing to this trend, many patients do not want to accept the risk of anticoagulant-related hemorrhage associated with mechanical valves: major events 0.5% per patient-year and minor events 2 to 4% per patient-year. <sup>31</sup> In addition, new concepts of valve-in-valve (VinV) interventions are suggesting to patients that there may be re-replacement of bioprosthetic valves in the future.

Mechanical prostheses usually are selected for younger recipients because of their proven durability over time. However, the risk of anticoagulant-related bleeding, as well as thromboembolic events (TEs), in these valves is not trivial and depends on valve design, structural materials, and host-related interactions. In a 12-year comparison of Bjork-Shiley versus porcine valves, Bloomfield et al documented severe bleeding complications in 18.6 versus 7.1%, respectively. Moreover, although endocarditis, dehiscence, perivalvular leak, and pannus formation are associated with both biologic and mechanical valves, acute prosthetic thrombosis is exclusively a complication of mechanical valves. Jan. In considering

mechanical valve durability, these associated risks cannot be ignored and must be weighed against the anticipated rate of tissue-valve failure and the need for reoperation.

### RISK FACTORS IN REOPERATIVE VALVE SURGERY

In evaluating patients for reoperative valve surgery, certain factors are associated with added risk. For example, Husebye et al, in a review of their 20-year experience<sup>17</sup> with reoperative valve surgery, found specific issues to carry higher risk (see Table 46-1). Overall operative mortality was 7% for the second and 14% for the third reoperation. Operative mortality for the first reoperation (n = 530 patients) was 5.9% in the aortic position and 19.6% in the mitral position. In the aortic position, operative mortality was 2.4% for New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I, 1.6% for NYHA class II, 6.3% for NYHA class III, and 20.8% for NYHA class IV emphasizing the significance of early referral. Regarding the urgency of surgery, the mortality for elective mitral valve reoperations was 1.4%; for urgent procedures, 8%; and for emergency procedures, 37.5%. Based on these findings, the authors have recommended that referral for reoperation be made when valve dysfunction is first noted, that is, before a significant decrement in myocardial function.<sup>17</sup> Similarly, Jones et al reviewed their experience with first heart valve reoperations in 671 patients between 1969 and 1998.6 Their overall operative mortality for first-time heart valve reoperation was 8.6%, similar to the results published by Lytle et al<sup>35</sup> (10.9%), Cohn et al<sup>4</sup> (10.1%), Akins et al<sup>36</sup> (7.3%), Pansini et al<sup>2</sup> (9.6%), and Tyers et al<sup>37</sup> (11.0%). In the Jones and colleagues series, mortality increased from 3.0% for reoperation on a new valve site to 10.6% for prosthetic valve dysfunction or periprosthetic leak; mortality was highest (29.4%) for associated endocarditis or valve thrombosis. Concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) carried a higher associated mortality (15.4%) than when it was not required (8.2%). Among the 336 patients requiring re-replacement of prosthetic valves, mortality was 26.1% for re-replacement of a mechanical valve

compared with 8.6% for re-replacement of a tissue valve. The authors concluded through multivariable analysis that significant predictors of mortality were year of reoperation, patient age, indication, concomitant CABG, and the replacement of a mechanical valve rather than a tissue valve.<sup>6</sup>

### PREOPERATIVE IMAGING IN REOPERATIVE VALVE SURGERY

Reoperative cardiac surgery is associated with higher morbidity and mortality than the first operation<sup>38-40</sup> partially related to the risk of surgical reentry. The main technical concern during surgical reentry is the risk of lethal injury to vital structures such as the aorta, RV, and patent coronary artery bypass grafts. The key to mitigating the risk of reentry is via careful planning of the surgical approach. This starts with knowing the exact proximity of the RV, aorta, and prior grafts to the posterior sternal table. The standard preoperative coronary angiography and chest x-ray is usually uninformative about the precise anatomic relationship of these vital structures with the sternum.

Retrospective electrocardiographic (ECG)-gated multidetector computed tomographic (MDCT) scanning has arisen as the modality of choice to assess not only the heart's location in relation to the sternum, but also graft's location and patency. 41-43 Use of ECG-gated MDCT meticulously evaluates the structures of interest to the surgeon, including sternum, mediastinal structures, bypass grafts, and their relationship to each other. 44-46 At our institution, all reoperative cardiac surgeries are preceded by a preoperative cardiac computed tomography (CT) scan assessment. For patients with prior valvular (non-CABG) surgeries in which assessment of bypass graft is not necessary, noncontrast CT scan is adequate. In 2010, the Appropriate Use Criteria of the American College of Cardiology rated this application of cardiac CT as an appropriate use of this technology. 45,47

Preoperative CT scan will lead to a modification of surgical approach in 20% of patients undergoing redo cardiac surgery. A1,44 For example, if CT shows a distended RV adherent to the posterior sternum, it might be prudent to initiate CPB prior to attempting sternal reentry. In high-risk redo patients, MDCT is associated with a higher adoption of preventive maneuvers aimed at mitigating the risk of reentry. There is evidence that preoperative MDCT reduces the risk associated with redo cardiac surgery as well as shorter perfusion and cross-clamp time, shorter intensive care unit stays, and less frequent perioperative myocardial infarction (MI). So

### REOPERATIVE AORTIC VALVE SURGERY

Historically, aortic valve surgery typically involved the placement of a mechanical valve. In the past, there were only a few generally accepted indications to use a bioprosthesis for primary, isolated aortic valve replacement (AVR): (1) the presence of well-established contraindications to anticoagulation, (2) the inability to monitor prothrombin levels adequately, and (3) patients whose survival was limited and more dependent on nonvalve-related issues. <sup>18,26</sup> In recent years, however, the use of biologic valves in the aortic position has become more common. <sup>24,51</sup>

As mentioned, reoperations are technically demanding, and many patients present in a poor functional state that further increases their mortality, in some series up to 19%. 32,52,53 Generally, optimal planning for reoperation prior to deterioration to NYHA class III to IV levels and before unfavorable comorbid conditions have arisen is imperative to ensure good outcomes.9 Following these guidelines in the modern era, elective re-replacement of malfunctioning aortic bioprostheses can be performed with results similar to those of the primary operation. 18,23,54 The Mayo Clinic, for example, recently reviewed its experience with 162 reoperative AVRs. Early mortality for reoperative AVR was not statistically different from that for primary AVR.<sup>55</sup> In light of recent lower operative mortality in reoperative valve surgery, a more conservative approach toward issues such as "prophylactic" AVR in patients with asymptomatic mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis (AS) at the time of CABG also may be more appropriate.<sup>56</sup>

In evaluating the reoperative patient, the presence of concomitant coronary artery disease and pulmonary hypertension has been shown consistently to be independent risk factors. 18 Patients with these risk factors therefore need careful surveillance once the probability of bioprosthetic dysfunction begins increasing (ie, 6 to 10 years after implantation).<sup>16</sup> Regarding valve surveillance and timing of reoperation, the following variables are relevant to the clinical management of patients with an aortic bioprosthesis: a history of endocarditis before the first operation, perioperative infectious complications, coronary artery disease acquired after the first operation, an increase in pulmonary artery pressure, and a decrease in left ventricular function during the interoperative interval.<sup>18</sup> Proper timing of the reoperation therefore is paramount because duration of clinical signs with a dysfunctional aortic bioprosthesis may be misleading. This is further supported by the fact that the need for emergency reoperation is the most ominous risk factor and consistently yields a high early mortality rate of 25 to 44%.57

## Reoperative Aortic Valve Surgery after Prior Coronary Revascularization

Reoperative valve surgery in patients with a prior patent left internal thoracic artery (LITA) to left anterior descending (LAD) graft is challenging for surgeons because of specific considerations for myocardial protection and prevention of patent graft injury. Unlike mitral valve surgery or CABG, in which cross-clamping of the aorta may be optional, aortic valve surgery mandates aortic cross-clamp unless hypothermic circulatory arrest is used. As such reoperative AVR in patients with a patent LITA graft presents a unique challenge of myocardial protection.

The incidence of LITA injury in the literature varies from 5 to  $9\%^{58-61}$  and is associated with a 40% risk of perioperative MI<sup>59</sup> and 50% mortality rate. <sup>62-64</sup> This high morbidity and mortality rate warrants a preoperative decision concerning the most appropriate and safe surgical approach.

This is an area of recent controversy. The most traditional approach involves resternotomy, dissection of the LITA graft, and occlusion of the patent graft with a small bulldog and then aortic cross-clamping. This strategy has the advantage of short CPB time, maximizing uniform myocardial protection without cardioplegia washout but with an obvious risk of LITA injury during dissection. Efforts to reduce the risk of LITA injury have led to the "no-dissection" surgical technique in which the graft is left unclamped with use of deep hypothermic cardioplegic arrest. 58,65-67 In this approach, the LITA graft is not dissected and myocardial protection is achieved by using moderate-to-deep hypothermic cardioplegic arrest. This has the advantage of minimizing (but not eliminating) graft injury and its main disadvantage is that an unclamped LITA graft can lead to poor/uneven myocardial protection because of cardioplegia washout from the LITA territory. Another disadvantage is poor visualization due to continuous flow through the LITA. Other less utilized and studied approaches involve supraclavicular or endovascular control of the patent LITA graft.<sup>68,69</sup>

It is worth mentioning that another strategy of handling patent LITA grafts involves deep hypothermic circulatory arrest without controlling the graft or aortic cross-clamping. This technique is occasionally indicated in patients with "porcelain" aortas.<sup>70</sup>

All these concerns reiterate the importance of meticulous preoperative assessment and planning, to determine the optimal surgical approach for each individual patient. The "no-dissection" technique with hypothermic cardioplegia is a preferred approach for redo AVR in patients with patent LITA graft. Several studies have documented the safety of this method without any increased risk of perioperative mortality. <sup>58,65-67</sup>

### Approaches and Techniques

#### CONVENTIONAL RESTERNOTOMY

The evolution of cardiac surgery through the last few decades has led to the popularization of various surgical approaches. Thoracotomy, for example, once was used extensively to gain access to mediastinal structures. Then median sternotomy became the standard approach. In reoperative cases, however, repeating the sternotomy carries definite surgical risks. Before proceeding with a resternotomy, the relationship between certain anterior mediastinal structures (eg, the RV and the aorta) and the posterior aspect of the sternum must be assessed carefully.<sup>71</sup> As described above, a CT scan with or without contrast is now the modality of choice.<sup>41,43,62</sup>

Exposure of the femoral vessels and preparation for emergency femoral-femoral CPB should be performed before resternotomy. In cases of heightened concern for RV-graft injury or in cases in which a left internal mammary artery

(LIMA) graft is patent, the surgeon should consider the use of CPB before chest reentry. Sternal wires from the previous operation should be undone carefully but left in place as a posterior safeguard during initial sternal division. An oscillating (not reciprocating) bone saw can be used to divide the anterior sternal table. An Army-Navy retractor, placed inferiorly in-line with the sternotomy can be used to stent open the wound during opening of the posterior table. Most authors recommend dividing the posterior table using a combination of scissors and anterolateral rake retraction. 62,71,72 Following this, bilateral pleural spaces should be entered inferiorly, followed by careful dissection of other mediastinal structures. The pericardial dissection plane can be developed by starting at the cardiophrenic angle and advancing slowly cephalad and laterally on the surface of the right side of the heart. Cephalad dissection should start with freeing the innominate vein before spreading the retractor to avoid its injury. Further dissection then is carried down to the superior vena cava (SVC), being careful to note the location of the right phrenic nerve. An area of consistently dense adhesions is the right atrial appendage, and caution should be used here. In addition, great care should be taken to avoid "deadventializing" the aorta. The area where the aorta apposes the pulmonary artery is another site of potential injury.

Repairing small ventricular or atrial lacerations should not be attempted before releasing the tension of the surrounding adhesions. Repair of great vessel injuries or severe RV injuries is best done on CPB. 71 Severe active hemorrhage during a second sternotomy usually is caused by adherence of the heart or great vessels to the posterior sternum. Prevention of this complication by interposition of pericardium or other mediastinal tissue at the time of the first operation has been suggested but has debatable relevance. 62 The incidence of resternotomy hemorrhage is between 2 and 6% per patient reoperation. 73-75 In a report of 552 patients who had undergone reoperative prosthetic valve surgery, 23 patients (4%) had complications related directly to sternal opening.<sup>17</sup> Of these, five patients had injury to the right atrium, seven patients had lacerated RVs, nine patients had injuries to the aorta, and two patients had a previously placed coronary artery graft divided. Nineteen of the 23 complications occurred during a first reoperation. Overall, there were two operative deaths related to resternotomy. The first death involved division of a previously placed coronary artery graft during reentry. The second death was caused by laceration of the aorta with subsequent exsanguination.<sup>17</sup> Of note, prior use of a right internal mammary artery (RIMA) graft can be particularly challenging because it frequently crosses the midline, and extreme caution must be used in first dissecting out this vessel.

Macmanus et al reviewed their experience with 100 patients undergoing repeat median sternotomy.<sup>74</sup> Eightyone patients had one repeat sternotomy, whereas the others had undergone multiple sternotomies. All had had a previous valve procedure and were reoperated on for progressive rheumatic valvular disease or for complications related to the prosthesis. Complications included hemorrhage during reentry in eight patients, postoperative hemorrhage in

two, seroma in four, and dehiscence, wound infection, and hematoma in one patient each. There was one operative death directly related to resternotomy hemorrhage.<sup>74</sup> When major hemorrhage does occur on sternal reentry, attempts at resternotomy should be abandoned, and the chest should be reapproximated by pushing toward the midline. The patient should be heparinized immediately while obtaining femoral arterial and venous cannulation. Blood loss from the resternotomy should be aspirated with cardiotomy suction and returned to the pump. Once bypass has been established, core cooling should be commenced with anticipation of the need for circulatory arrest. Once cool, flow rates can be reduced briefly for less than a minute, and the remaining sternal division can be completed, followed by direct repair of the underlying injury. 62 Anticipating the possibility of this scenario, we frequently expose peripheral cannulation sites prior to beginning a resternotomy. In cases of heightened concern for RV or graft injury, or in patients with a patent LIMA to LAD artery graft, CPB and cardiac decompression may be initiated before sternal reentry. After safe sternal entry, the patient may be weaned from bypass for further dissection of adhesions to avoid prolonged pump times.

### MINIMALLY INVASIVE REOPERATIVE AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT

Reoperative procedures are challenging owing to diffuse mediastinal and pericardial adhesions. A large incision that increases the operative exposure also has been associated with a higher risk of injury to cardiac structures and coronary artery bypass grafts and results in greater bleeding with its associated transfusion requirements. 76-79 A smaller incision with a limited sternotomy, on the other hand, reduces the area of pericardiolysis, thus mitigating these effects. The intact lower sternum that remains also preserves the integrity of the caudal chest wall, thereby enhancing sternal stability and promoting earlier extubation. 80,81 Minimally invasive valve procedures gradually have become more accepted as new technologies and instrumentation have been developed.80 Reoperative procedures in which there is risk for graft injury are an area where minimally invasive strategies may be of direct benefit.<sup>82,83</sup> Our surgical approach in reoperative AVR is shown in Fig. 46-1.80 In our series of patients, peripheral cannulation sites were exposed or cannulated before beginning the partial upper resternotomy. An external defibrillator is placed on the patient before draping for anticipated defibrillation as necessary. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was used in every patient. A partial upper resternotomy was carried out to the third or fourth intercostal space depending on the estimated position of the aortic valve as documented by CT scan/TEE and then was "T'd to the right."84 The oscillating saw was used to divide the anterior sternal table, whereas the straight Mayo scissors, under direct visualization, was used to divide the posterior sternal table. In the setting of a patent LIMA-LAD graft or other anterior coronary artery bypass grafts, patients were placed on CPB before partial resternotomy. Mediastinal dissection was limited

FIGURE 46-1 Partial upper resternotomy for reoperative AVR. The previous sternotomy incision is exposed to the third or fourth intercostal space depending on the position of the aortic valve, as documented by TEE. After dissection of the ascending aorta, paying particular attention to the position of coronary artery bypass grafts and their proximal anastomoses, cannulation is carried out. In this figure, the ascending aorta and innominate vein are cannulated. Frequently, however, other cannulation sites are required owing to space limitations in the chest. The ascending aorta is cross-clamped, and the aortic valve re-replacement is conducted in a standard fashion.

to only the ascending aorta as was necessary for clamping and aortotomy. The right atrium was dissected only if it was cannulated. Although intrathoracic cannulation was preferred, we frequently used peripheral cannulation to avoid clutter in the chest. Retrograde cardioplegia, if necessary, was delivered via a transjugular coronary sinus catheter or with right atrial placement under TEE guidance. Vacuum assistance of venous drainage was used in the majority of patients. Once on CPB, all patients were systemically cooled to 20 to 25°C. Patients with patent LIMA-LAD grafts were cooled routinely to 20°C for additional myocardial protection and in so doing avoided the need and potential hazard of dissecting out the LIMA for clamping in an attempt to avoid cardioplegia washout. If flow

from the patent LIMA-LAD graft led to significant blood flow out of the coronary ostium and obscured the operative field, pump flows were turned down temporarily to allow visualization. Venting was accomplished by placing a pediatric vent through the aortic annulus. The aortic valve surgery then was performed based on patient indications. While closing the aortotomy, intracardiac air was removed by insufflating the lungs and decreasing flows on CPB. Carbon dioxide was used and flooded the operative field. Patients also were tilted from side to side to help with de-airing, and the ascending aortic vent was left open until separation from CPB. Temporary epicardial pacing wires were placed on the anterior surface of the RV while the heart was decompressed and before the aortic cross-clamp was removed. Two 32 French right-angled submammary chest tubes then were placed through the right pleural space, one angled medially into the mediastinum and one angled posterior into the pleural space. Decannulation and closure then were performed in the standard manner.

With our increasing experience in minimally invasive reoperative AVR, we have refined our technique as an alternative to conventional full resternotomy.<sup>80</sup> Technical details of the partial upper resternotomy approach are presented in Table 46-2. By following these guidelines, we have yet to

convert any patient to a full resternotomy. CT scan and/or TEE are helpful in locating the level of the aortic valve and determining the proximity of the aorta to the posterior aspect of the sternum. <sup>84</sup> Also, extension of the sternal incision laterally on both sides through the intercostal spaces helps to later reapproximate the sternum. We have tried to limit mediastinal and pericardial dissection primarily to the aorta, believing that this is the principal reason for decreased bleeding and transfusion requirements postoperatively. <sup>80,82,85,86</sup> The RV, which often is attached to the sternum, does not need to be dissected. Also, injuries to patent but atherosclerotic vein grafts can be reduced with this "no touch" technique. <sup>87</sup>

Arterial and venous cannulation sites can vary considerably, reflecting the individual choice of the operating surgeon and the sufficiency of intrathoracic space. Possible cannulation sites, other than standard ones, include the axillary artery, innominate vein, and percutaneous femoral vein. <sup>13,88</sup> Innominate vein or percutaneous femoral vein cannulation, as well as the use of TEE to place the retrograde cardioplegia catheter, has been extremely helpful in minimizing dissection of the right atrium. At present, we consider this approach to be useful for isolated, elective reoperative aortic valve surgery. <sup>80</sup>

### REOPERATIVE AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT AFTER HOMOGRAFT/ROOT/ALLOGRAFT

AVR with homografts and autografts was performed increasingly because of excellent freedom from thromboembolism, resistance to infection, and reasonable hemodynamic performance.<sup>27</sup> Although improved durability of current tissue valves has slowed this trend, autografts and, to a lesser degree, homografts remain popular in younger patients owing to durability and, in the case of autografts, the potential for growth.30,89 Consequently, many patients will require aortic valve re-replacement for structural degeneration of their homograft or autograft valve. 90 It is expected that about onethird of patients younger than 40 years of age will require aortic valve re-replacement within 12 years of homograft placement. This is owing primarily to calcification and structural valve degeneration. As such, the issue of homograft or autograft durability is particularly pertinent in this subgroup of younger patients who are expected to live beyond 15 years from the time of operation.89

The incidence of patients with homografts or autografts in need of a second valve operation is expected to increase owing to the aforementioned recent popularity and availability of these conduits. Also, there is varied opinion as to the optimal surgical method of primary homograft AVR, with increased rates of aortic insufficiency (AI) in patients with the subcoronary implantation technique. Importantly, the selected technique of primary homograft operation may have relevance at reoperation because calcification or aneurysmal dilatation of the homograft may pose surgical challenges at reoperation. Despite these challenges, Sundt and others<sup>29,91,92</sup> have documented the feasibility of aortic valve re-replacement after full-root replacement with a homograft. In our own series of 18 patients, full-root, mini-root, and subcoronary techniques all were amenable to valve re-replacement.<sup>27</sup>

How to best approach the reoperative root scenario and which valve to reimplant, however, have been debated. At one extreme, Hasnat et al documented the results of 144 patients who underwent a second aortic homograft replacement with a hospital mortality rate of only 3.5%. 90 Although Kumar et al, in a multivariate analysis of reoperative aortic valve surgery, did not show that a previous homograft added significant risk,<sup>93</sup> the technical aspects of reoperative AVR in this patient population consistently have been found to be challenging owing to the heavy calcific degeneration that invariably occurs. With this in mind, and owing to the typical absence of the need for a second root operation, we and others<sup>94</sup> believe that a more simplified approach to reoperative aortic valve surgery in patients with previously placed homografts may be optimal. Our approach has been to perform aortic valve re-replacement using a mechanical valve or, less commonly, a stented xenograft while reserving a second homograft and root operation for specific indications such as endocarditis, associated root pathology, or a very young patient with contraindications to a mechanical valve.

An open valve-in-homogragft approach involves resection of the degenerated or infected aortic homograft leaflets and a new valve is seated within the aortic homograft valve annulus without a need for root reconstruction. 95 The procedure is done via a median sternotomy, which is preceded by peripheral cannulation for CPB via femoral vein and artery or right axillary artery. The heart is dissected out, CPB is initiated, the patient is fibrillated and cross-clamped; antegrade (and occasional retrograde) cardioplegia is initiated. 95 The aorta is opened between the homograft root and the ascending aorta. If there is heavy calcification, a vertical or S-shaped aortotomy is made. The homograft leaflets are resected and the calcified annulus debrided with careful endarterectomy of the proximal ascending aorta. The endarterectomy is carried out starting at the annulus and coming up to allow stitches on in the softer aorta. 95 The valve prosthesis (bioprosthetic or mechanical) is then sized and implanted using interrupted noneverting 2.0 Ethibond (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ) pledgeted sutures. The valve is then seated and the sutures tied and cut. The aorta is then closed with a running 3-0 Prolene (Ethicon) suture. The cross-clamp is removed and the heart defibrillated into normal sinus rhythm.<sup>95</sup>

Homograft re-replacement nonetheless is performed but it is much less common, and hospital mortality varies widely across many centers, ranging between 2.5 and 50%. <sup>29,91,92</sup> David and colleagues, for example, recently reviewed their experience with root operations in 165 patients who previously had undergone cardiac surgery. Of these, 28 had a previous root operation. Overall, 12 operative (7%) and 20 late deaths (12%) occurred. <sup>96</sup> Variations in sample size, valve selection, surgical techniques, and patient factors, as well as the experience of the surgeons, may account for these wide differences.

#### **AORTIC VALVE BYPASS SURGERY**

Aortic valve bypass (AVB) surgery, also known as apical aortic conduit surgery, is an alternative for high-risk and "inoperable" reoperative patients with AS. It has been used

in patients with reduced LV function, <sup>97</sup> porcelain aorta, <sup>98</sup> severe patient prosthetic mismatch, <sup>99</sup> excessive comorbidities, and vulnerable functional grafts <sup>100</sup> leading to prohibitive risk for conventional reoperative AVR. AVB surgery works by shunting blood from the apex of the left ventricle to the descending aorta through a surgically placed valve conduit (Fig. 46-2). This approach avoids cross-clamping, cardioplegic arrest, potentially CPB, <sup>101</sup> debridement of the native valve, and injury to patent grafts because the procedure is performed through the left chest. Patient-prosthesis mismatch is also unlikely as the indexed effective orifice area (EOAi) is the sum of the valves in both the native position and conduit.

Contraindications to this procedure include moderate AI. Relative contraindications include a heavily diseased descending aorta or significant mitral valve regurgitation. However, Gammie et al showed that the degree of mitral regurgitation (MR) is reduced after placement of the conduit and moderate MR patients are still considered.

The procedure<sup>102,103</sup> is performed using a left ventricular apical connector with a silicon sewing ring and a heart valve (typically a stentless porcine valve with the coronaries over sewn) sewn to a Dacron graft at the beginning of the procedure. An 8-mm side branch off the Dacron graft may be used for direct inflow from the CPB machine if performed on pump. The patient is positioned in the right lateral decubitus position with a double lumen endotracheal tube. TEE is used

to exclude apical thrombus, calcification of the descending aorta, and ensure proper conduit positioning. If going on bypass an arterial and venous cannula are place in groin. A fifth- to sixth-intercostal space thoracotomy is performed and the apex of the heart and descending thoracic aorta exposed. The valve conduit with apical connector is then oriented with connector aimed at the apex of the heart. After heparinization the distal anastomosis is performed after placement of a partial occluding clamp on the descending thoracic aorta. The clamp is removed and hemostasis achieved. Stentless valve competency will prevent blood flow out of the apical connector. The pericardium is then opened and tacked up and a mark is made 1 to 2 cm lateral to the true apex of the left ventricle: 2-0 monofilament pledgeted sutures are used in an interrupted fashion around this marked area with deep bites of nearly full thickness. These are then taken through the sewing ring of the apical connector. If CPB is to be initiated, it is done at this time. The patient is placed in steep Trendelenburg position and the ventricle is then paced at 200 beats/min to reduce ventricular ejection. A hole is made in the marked apical area and a 14 French Foley catheter is placed into the left ventricle. Tension is placed on the Foley catheter and a coring knife is used to remove a plug of apical myocardium. A coring knife 85% of the diameter of the apical connector is selected to ensure a proper fit and optimize hemostasis. The Foley catheter is then removed and the apical connector is placed in the left ventricle. The sutures are tied down. The graft is de-aired and the chest is closed. When complete blood flow from the left ventricle travels out of the native valve and the conduit where it will primarily travel distally in the aorta with some flow in the retrograde direction. Studies have shown that approximately one-third of the flow travels out the native valve, whereas two-thirds travel out the conduit.100 The procedure has been shown to be highly efficacious, dropping the mean aortic valve gradients in one study from 43 to 10 mm. 100 The durability of the apical aortic conduit procedure is also apparent, with some patients now more than 25 years out from their operations.

#### TRANSCATHETER AORTIC VALVES

The PARTNER trial was the first prospective randomized control study evaluating the safety and efficacy of transcatheter AVR (TAVR) in high-risk patients (cohort B) and "prohibitive" risk patients with severe AS. The study showed that in this "prohibitive" risk cohort, TAVR was better compared to medical therapy and in the high-risk cohort (cohort A) was noninferior to surgical AVR (SAVR). <sup>104,105</sup> Shortly after the successful results of the PARTNER trial was published in 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration approved TAVR. This ushered in the era of TAVR in the United States.

Today, the two types of TAVR approved in the United State are the Edwards SAPIEN XT (Edwards Lifesciences, Inc.[Irvine, CA]) and the Medtronic CoreValve (Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). The Edwards SAPIEN XT uses a balloon-expandable stainless steel alloy tubular frame

within leaflets constructed from bovine pericardium while the Medtronic CoreValve uses a self-expanding nitinol (nickel-titanium alloy that is malleable at low temperature but rigid at body temperature) frame. These devices can be implanted via percutaneous routes (transfemoral or subclavian/axillary), direct transapical or direct aortic access. For more on percutaneous AVR see Chapter 33.

## Transcatheter Aortic Valve-in-Valve Implantation

The wide success of TAVR in patients with severe native aortic valve stenosis has led to its application beyond native aortic valve disease. This initially led to several reports of off-label TAV implantation within failed surgically inserted bioprosthetic valves (VinV). <sup>107-110</sup> VinV was first reported by Wenaweser et al in 2007 <sup>111</sup> and it has garnered widespread use. A VinV procedure involves percutaneous implantation of a valve inside an already implanted bioprosthetic valve (Fig. 46-3) and it is an alternative to open surgery in high-risk patients with a degenerate aortic bioprosthesis.

VinV implantation is relatively new, but technology and experience with its application are growing exponentially. The Valve-in-Valve International Data (VIVID) registry was established in 2010 to collect data on VinV procedures from 55 centers around the world. They recently published the outcomes of 459 high-risk patients who underwent VinV implantation, the largest series to date. They reported a 30-day operative mortality of 7.6%, a 1.7% major stroke rate, and an 83.2% overall 1-year survival. Of those who survived to 1-year, 92.3% had good functional status (NYHA class I/II).

Although these initial results of VinV implantation are promising, it does come with a distinct set of technical challenges and early results have been marred by unique safety concerns. These safety concerns include device malposition, ostial coronary occlusion, and elevated postprocedural gradients. The VIVID registry reported a high device malposition rate of 15.3%; a 3.5% rate of ostial coronary obstruction; and a 28.4% rate of postprocedural high gradients (mean  $\geq 20~\text{mmHg}).^{113}$ 

Another area of uncertainty is the long-term durability of VinV implantation. There are currently no long-term data on this relatively new procedure with most studies only stating 1-year survivals. 112-114

Conventional open redo AVR is still considered the standard of care for patients with failed implanted valves. Although VinV is appealing as an alternative for high-risk, "inoperable" patients, long-term follow-up data will be necessary to establish the true role of VinV implantation for failed, degenerate bioprosthesis.

## REOPERATIVE MITRAL VALVE SURGERY

Fundamental to a flawless surgical procedure is excellent and consistent exposure of the mitral valve.<sup>115</sup> Historically, the mitral valve has been exposed through a variety of surgical approaches, including median sternotomy, right thoracotomy, left thoracotomy, and transverse sternotomy.<sup>116</sup> The median sternotomy and right thoracotomy will be discussed in detail in the following; however, a brief description of the other approaches is warranted.

The *left* thoracotomy has been used in recent years to gain access to the mitral valve in situations in which a right thoracotomy is precluded (eg, mastectomy/radiation or pleurodesis). This incision is made through the fourth intercostal space, and the left pleural cavity is entered in the standard fashion. 116 Surgery is performed under fibrillatory arrest or with the beating-heart technique. Of importance, the mitral valve orientation is noted to be upside down with this approach, with the posterior annulus found anteriorly. 117 Thompson and colleagues recently reported their experience with the beatingheart left thoracotomy approach for reoperative mitral valve surgery. Of the 125 patients undergoing this technique, 86% were in NYHA class III or IV, and 28% had undergone two or more sternotomies. Thirty-day mortality was 6.4% with low complication rates. 118 Although occasionally useful, this approach provides limited access to the other cardiac chambers as well as poor visibility. This left-sided approach is rarely needed and typically reserved for patients in whom reoperative sternotomy or right thoracotomy is considered unacceptable. A bilateral anterior thoracotomy (ie, transverse sternotomy) carried out through the fourth intercostal space also has been described. 117,119 Rarely used today, this incision transects the sternum transversely, requiring ligation of both internal mammary arteries.

Regardless of the actual approach, once CPB has been established and the heart exposed, there are several incisions that can be employed to view the underlying mitral valve. The standard left atriotomy begins with blunt dissection of the interatrial groove (ie, Sondergaard's groove), allowing the right atrium to be retracted medially and anteriorly (see Fig. 46-4). The right superior pulmonary vein at its junction with the left atrium then is exposed, and the left atrium is opened at the midpoint between the right superior pulmonary vein insertion and the interatrial groove. This incision is extended longitudinally both superiorly and inferiorly to give enough exposure of the mitral valve. Care must be taken to avoid inadvertent injury to the posterior wall of the left atrium, and when closing, one must avoid including the posterior wall of the right pulmonary vein. The right atrial transseptal approach has become popular in recent years, especially in reoperative valve surgery. After opening the right atrium, the interatrial septum is incised starting at the fossa ovalis and moving vertically upward for a few centimeters (Figs. 46-5 and 46-6). This technique is especially helpful in reoperative surgery because it minimizes the amount of dissection required. Superior biatrial atriotomy, left ventriculotomy, and aortotomy all have been well described 15,76,115,116,120,121 as approaches to the mitral valve; each one has varying advantages and disadvantages.

#### Approaches and Techniques

#### RESTERNOTOMY

Resternotomy is still a common approach in reoperative mitral valve surgery. In many cases, this incision provides full and adequate exposure. This is especially true when concomitant procedures are necessary. However, reoperative median

**FIGURE 46-4** Sondergaard's groove approach. The left atrium enlarges to the right, increasing visualization from the right thoracotomy approach. The interatrial groove (Sondergaard's groove) is dissected approximately 1-cm deep, down to the left atrial wall. The purse-string suture is placed in the nondissected area. This prevents tearing of the dissected left atrial wall when the suture is tied down. Sagittal view shows location of the mitral valve in relation to the atriotomy. (Reproduced with permission from De DH, Pessella AT: Closed mitral commissurotomy utilizing right thoracotomy approach, *Asian Cardiovasc Thorac Ann* 2000;June:8(2):192-194.)

sternotomy has known risks, including injury to or embolism from prior grafts, sternal dehiscence, excessive hemorrhage, and inadvertent cardiac injury. 122 Patients with valvular heart disease may be especially prone to these complications because atrial dilatation can result in significant cardiomegaly, atrial thinning, and adherence of the heart to the posterior sternum. As discussed, patients undergoing prosthetic valve reoperation have a 4% incidence of complications directly related to sternal reentry that can result directly in intraoperative death. 17,35 Resternotomy also has been noted to be particularly hazardous in the presence of patent internal mammary grafts. Injury to a patent LIMA graft has an associated mortality rate approaching 50%. 62,84 Furthermore, manipulation of patent but diseased saphenous vein grafts can result in embolization into the native coronary circulation with resulting morbidity and mortality. 122,123 Patients with previous AVRs can have difficult exposure of the mitral valve owing to anterior fixation and probably are best served by an anterolateral thoracotomy approach. In general, in the setting of reoperative surgery, the resternotomy is likely to be the most dangerous part of the operation.<sup>124</sup> In this situation, we also have employed techniques that avoid resternotomy, such as right thoracotomy.

**FIGURE 46-5** Atrial incision through the fossa ovalis. When the right atrium is incised, an incision is made in the atrial septum through the fossa ovalis. Retraction sutures on both the right atrium and the atrial septum of 2-0 silk then are used to elevate the septum and to keep the left atrium open. The mitral valve then will be exposed (*inset*).

FIGURE 46-6 Closure. In the transseptal approach, the atria septum is approximated with running 4-0 Prolene sutures and is left open until the aortic cross-clamp is removed and the air is evacuated. The left ventricle should be filled with fluid before removal of the cross-clamp to help dislodgment of intraventricular air. Once the cross-clamp has been removed, air is evacuated vigorously from the left atrium through the septum or the left atrium itself, and the sutures are tied. The right atrium is then closed with running 4-0 Prolene sutures in two layers. TEE has been very important in helping to monitor the clearing of air from the intracardiac structures. We consider it mandatory in the minimally invasive technique, in which access to the entire cardiac structure is limited.

#### RIGHT THORACOTOMY

The right anterolateral thoracotomy approach was one of the first surgical approaches to the mitral valve, and it has become a safe alternative to resternotomy for mitral valve replacement<sup>10,62,125,126</sup> (see Fig. 46-5). This approach provides excellent exposure of the valves (mitral and tricuspid) with minimal need for dissection within the pericardium. In our recent experience with this approach, 124,127-131 operations were performed in the supine position with the right side of the chest slightly elevated. We routinely prepped and draped the right groin to allow femoral cannulation, if necessary. Preoperative and intraoperative TEE was performed in all patients, as well as standard intraoperative cardiac monitoring and a pacing Swan-Ganz catheter. A 5-cm right anterolateral thoracotomy was made, and the chest was entered through the bed of the fourth or fifth rib. 131 Adhesions of the right lung to the chest wall or pericardium were divided by electrocautery. The pericardium was entered anterior to the phrenic nerve. Arterial cannulation was achieved peripherally via the femoral artery. Peripheral cannulation was mostly via the femoral artery and this route was utilized if by TEE the atheroma grade of the descending aorta or arch is less than grade III. However, if the atheroma grade is greater than III, arterial cannulation is done via the right axillary artery. Venous cannulation was performed via the femoral vein with the tip of the cannula positioned between the SVC and the right atrium. In cases requiring tricuspid valve surgery, an additional SVC cannula is used while the femoral venous cannula is advanced at the IVC into the right atrium. After systemic heparinization, CPB is initiated with vacuum-assisted drainage. Patients were then cooled to 28°C to induce fibrillatory arrest. If spontaneous arrest did not occur with cooling, the pacing Swan-Ganz catheter was used to pace rapidly the ventricle into fibrillation. Care is used to avoid left ventricular ejection by keeping the left ventricle empty (ie, maintaining laminar, nonpulsatile arterial line tracing). In the absence of AI, aortic cross-clamping usually was not required. Regurgitant flow through the aortic valve occasionally required temporary low pump flow at appropriate temperatures to avoid cerebral injury.<sup>131</sup> The mitral valve was then approached through the left atrium directly by dissection of the intra-atrial (Sondergaard's) groove (see Fig. 46-4) or through the right atrium via the atrial septum (see Fig. 46-6). As the valve procedure was completed, rewarming was initiated (Fig. 46-7). Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) can be continuously insufflated into the chest throughout the procedure to displace intracardiac air which reduces the time spent de-airing. In addition, perfusing blood via a cannula (eg, the left ventricular vent) positioned across the mitral valve and into the left ventricle will serve to displace residual air. A left atrial sump sucker was used to maintain a clear operative field. Upon completion of the procedure, patients then were placed in the Trendelenburg position and de-airing ascertained under TEE guidance. When core temperatures reached 37°C, the patient was weaned from CPB. Closure then was routine and at the conclusion of the procedure, patients were returned to the supine position.

The use of a small right anterior thoracotomy, femorofemoral bypass, and deep hypothermia has increased since our initial report in 1989.<sup>132</sup> Reduced blood use and decreased risk of LIMA or cardiac structural injury during sternal reentry make it a desirable approach for many complicated mitral reoperations. Deep hypothermia (~20°C) and low-flow femorofemoral bypass perfusion, without the necessity of aortic cross-clamping, provide adequate myocardial protection.<sup>133</sup> CPB times, blood loss, blood product usage, and LIMA injury rates have been lower in reoperative patients undergoing right thoracotomy than in those with resternotomy.<sup>35,118,120,129,133-136</sup>

Certain issues must be considered before the right thoracotomy approach is entertained. Patients who require simultaneous CABG generally will require a median sternotomy, although isolated right-sided grafting may be performed with a thoracotomy. Simultaneous replacement of the aortic valve is difficult from a thoracotomy approach and generally should be performed through a resternotomy. Significant AI can make effective perfusion on CPB difficult because, after opening the left atrium, blood will be returned to the pump via the cardiotomy suction. Unless the ascending aorta is clamped, effective end-organ perfusion will not be achieved. Also, in the setting of AI, exposure of the mitral valve may be difficult owing to this regurgitant flow into the surgical field. Left ventricular distension and myocardial stretch injury also can occur with fibrillatory arrest in patients with and occasionally without AI. Patients with greater than minimal AI therefore should be either excluded from a right thoracotomy approach or expected to require aortic cross-clamping either with traditional clamping or rarely with balloon occlusion with delivery of cardioplegia and aortic root venting. Significant right pleural disease, especially scarring in the right hemithorax, previously has been a relative contraindication to a right thoracotomy, although our series includes two patients

with a previous right thoracotomy who did not represent an overwhelming challenge. 137

Our experience with 90 patients undergoing reoperative mitral valve surgery via a minimally invasive right thoracotomy without aortic cross-clamping showed excellent results. <sup>136</sup> In that series, the 2% operative mortality was lower than the STS-predicted mortality of 7%. Three patients developed acute renal failure postoperatively with one patient requiring new hemodialysis. One patient (1%) developed a postoperative stroke and no patient suffered a postoperative MI. <sup>136</sup> This study confirmed that the minimally invasive right thoracotomy technique was safe and effective in reducing operative mortality in reoperative mitral valve surgery. <sup>136</sup>

#### Minimally Invasive/Port Access Right-Sided Techniques

An alternative approach to reoperative mitral valve is with minimally invasive or port access techniques.

Some authors have noted that the distance to the mitral valve with the right thoracotomy approach at times can be limiting. Chitwood and colleagues recently reported use of a minithoracotomy aided by the voice-activated robotic camera AESOP.<sup>138</sup> Vleissis and Bolling also reported 22 patients who underwent a "minimally invasive" right thoracotomy approach to the atrioventricular valves. 139 The procedures performed included mitral valve repair (n = 12), mitral valve replacement (n = 5), prosthetic mitral valve re-replacement (n = 4), repair of a perivalvular leak (n = 3), tricuspid valve repair (n = 5), and closure of an atrial septal defect (n = 7). Mean bypass time was 109 minutes with a mean fibrillatory time of 62 minutes. Operative mortality in this group was 0%, and none of the patients experienced a wound complication. At follow-up, all reoperative patients thought that their recovery from this approach was more rapid and less painful than their original sternotomy. 139 Burfeind et al recently reviewed Duke University's experience with the port access technique. 140 In their series of 60 patients, a 6 cm right anterolateral thoracotomy was used with standard port access technique. Forty-five percent of patients underwent cardiac arrest with the Endo Clamp technique, whereas ventricular fibrillation was used in 55% of patients. Femoral cannulation was used in all patients. When compared with concurrent cohorts of patients undergoing reoperative sternotomy or right anterolateral thoracotomy, patients undergoing the port access technique had lower mortality and decreased transfusion requirements but significantly longer CPB times. Although similar results have been found by other groups, one should be mindful of the potential hazards of the port access technique, namely, EndoClamp migration. 141-144

## Additional Techniques of Reoperative Mitral Surgery

A less common indication for reoperative mitral valve surgery but one that can be challenging is periprosthetic leak. The incidence of perivalvular leak for both mechanical and

biologic valves is about 0 to 1.5% per patient-year. Of note, perivalvular leak is slightly more common with mechanical than with tissue valves, possibly owing to differences in suture technique for each and sewing ring characteristics. The regurgitant flow across the perivalvular area frequently leads to hemolysis and, through denuding of the endocardium, endocarditis.

In evaluating patients with a periprosthetic leak, an assessment of valve function is important. If the valve itself is competent, direct repair of the leak avoids the hazards of valve replacement. Although pledgeted suturing may be attempted for smaller leaks, fibrotic tethering of surrounding tissue and the size of the defect may require a bovine or autologous pericardial patch. In cases of significant dehiscence or associated valvular dysfunction, removal of the valve is necessary. Replacement in this situation, however, is prone to leak recurrence because the annulus is partially intact, often calcified, and otherwise less than ideal for suture placement. In these cases, a bovine pericardial skirt can be fashioned and sewn to the sewing ring of the valve. Annular sutures then are placed in a typical fashion through the sewing ring, and the valve is seated. A running suture then can be used to sew this skirt to the left atrium (Fig. 46-8).

An additional risk of reoperative mitral valve replacement is atrioventricular disruption. Care must be used in removing the original valve sewing ring because it is frequently "socked in," and inadvertent removal of excessive annular tissue may occur. Any evidence of disruption of the posterior annulus necessitates patch repair with pericardium (autologous or bovine) before placement of annular sutures. When faced with less than ideal annular tissue, and in an attempt to ensure stability, bites must not be overly aggressive in depth. Left circumflex injury can occur and will lead to significant morbidity and mortality (Fig. 46-9). When removal of the old sewing ring will result in severe annular disruption, the ring may be left in place and used as a "neoannulus" for suturing.

![](_page_11_Picture_5.jpeg)

**FIGURE 46-8** Pericardial skirt. Bovine pericardium can be fashioned as a skirt (A) and sewn to the sewing ring of the mitral prosthesis (B). Standard annular valve sutures are then taken through the sewing ring, the valve is seated, and the skirt is sewn to the left atrium with running technique (C). (Carbomedics mechanical valve shown.)

The benefits of preservation of the subvalvular apparatus have been clearly demonstrated during first-time mitral valve replacement. Aside from improved contractile function, disruption of the posterior mitral annulus is avoided. David and colleagues found that preservation of the subvalvular apparatus is also important in reoperative patients. Ar Of 513 reoperative mitral valve replacements, preservation of the posterior subvalvular apparatus was accomplished in 103 (21%) patients, with anterior and posterior preservation occurring in 31 patients (6%). Gore-Tex neochordal construction was performed in 135 reoperative mitral valve replacement

patients (26%). Perioperative mortality occurred in 3.6% of redo patients with a preserved subvalvular apparatus (native tissue and/or Gore-Tex reconstruction) versus 13.3% of redo patients without preservation (p < .001). Attempts at preservation of the subvalvular apparatus in reoperative mitral valve patients therefore should be considered.

### REOPERATIVE TRICUSPID VALVE SURGERY

The need for reoperative tricuspid valve surgery most frequently occurs in high-risk patients. In a recent series of tricuspid valve replacements (TVR) by Filsoufi et al, <sup>148</sup> 72% (n = 58) were reoperations. The overall operative mortality in this group was 22% (n = 18). Risk factors for mortality included urgent/emergent status, age greater than 50 years, functional etiology, and elevated pulmonary artery pressure. Of the 60 survivors, 26 (43%) died during follow-up. The authors concluded that patients requiring TVR are at high risk, frequently at end-stage functional class. As such, serious consideration of the risks should occur before embarking on such procedures (Table 46-3).

Tricuspid valve endocarditis is most commonly the result of seeding of the tricuspid valve leaflets during sustained bacteremia.<sup>149</sup> Continued sepsis despite antibiotic therapy, heart failure owing to tricuspid insufficiency, and recurrent multiple pulmonary emboli are indications to intervene surgically in tricuspid valve endocarditis. Complete excision of the tricuspid valve (without subsequent replacement) was first advocated by Arbulu et al.<sup>149</sup> From an infectious disease standpoint, this surgical approach has the obvious advantage of complete extirpation of the infected tissue and avoids placement of any prosthetic material. Although it is tolerated initially, the extirpation procedure inevitably leads to late-onset right-sided failure in the majority of patients. 149-151 In a 20-year follow-up of the originally reported series of 55 patients with intractable right-sided endocarditis who underwent tricuspid valvectomy without replacement, two patients (4%) died in the postoperative period owing to right-sided failure. Six patients (11%) required prosthetic valve insertion 2 days to 13 years later for medically refractory rightsided heart failure. Of those who underwent reoperation (n = 6), four (66%) died. As such, severe hepatic congestion and the need for reoperative valve replacement have made this approach (without replacement) untenable to some practitioners. An alternative treatment option is to perform valvectomy followed by delayed valve replacement 3 to 9 months later.<sup>152</sup>

#### **FINAL POINTS**

- 1. Reoperative valve surgery most commonly involves structural valve deterioration of a bioprosthesis or progression of native valve disease after nonvalve surgery.
- 2. Bioprosthetic valves are known to undergo a time-dependent process of structural deterioration that results in a freedom of reoperation of 80% at 15 years.

### TABLE 46-3: Technical Considerations for Reoperative Valve Surgery

Consider reoperation before decline in functional status (NYHA class). Assess RV/aortic proximity to sternum preoperatively with CT scan

Consider alternate approaches (especially with patent bypass grafts) Right thoracotomy for reoperative  $\ensuremath{\mathsf{MVR}}$ 

Mini-sternotomy for reoperative AVR

Consider alternate cannulation techniques to gain safe entry, eg, femoral, axillary

Address the LIMA-LAD graft if present

Dissect it out and clamp it, or

Cool and ignore it

Consider ease of implantation in valve choice, eg, mechanical in homograft

Use "no-touch" technique of bypass grafts

Use a conservative myocardial protection strategy

Antegrade and retrograde

Systemic cooling

Warm induction/final dose ("hot shot")

If using hypothermic fibrillatory arrest, beware of AI leading to LV distension and/or obscuring operative field

Place external defibrillator pads

Consider the use of antifibrinolytic agents, eg, Amicar

- 3. Major risk factors in reoperative valve surgery include advanced age, impaired ejection fraction, congestive heart failure, urgency of operation, preoperative shock, concomitant coronary artery bypass surgery or presence of previous bypass grafts, prosthetic valve endocarditis, surgery for perivalvular leaks, valve thrombosis, or prosthetic dysfunction, renal dysfunction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pulmonary hypertension.
- 4. ECG-gated MDCT scanning is the preferred modality for preoperative assessment of vital structures in reoperative valve surgery.
- Reoperative valve surgery after prior CABG with patent LITA graft presents unique challenges and the decision regarding intraoperative management of the patent graft must be made during the preoperative planning phase.
- Reoperative aortic valve surgery after homograft or root replacement can be difficult and should be simplified by replacement with a mechanical valve when possible. Reoperative root operations should be avoided if not indicated.
- 7. AVB surgery is an alternative for reoperative AVR in extremely difficult reoperative cases.
- 8. TAVR is now an established technique of reoperative valve replacement in high-risk patients and VinV implantation is the next frontier of percutaneous valve implantation.
- 9. The right thoracotomy approach to reoperative mitral and tricuspid valves provides excellent exposure with minimal need for dissection while also avoiding prior

- bypass grafts. Significant AI and the need for bypass grafting preclude this approach when aortic clamping and cardioplegic myocardial arrest are used.
- 10. Most commonly, periprosthetic leaks should be patched, rather than treated with valve replacement if the valve is functioning normally.
- 11. Reoperative tricuspid valve surgery occurs in high-risk patients with pulmonary hypertension with variable degrees of right heart failure. As such, this operation should be carefully considered.
