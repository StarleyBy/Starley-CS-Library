# Lung Transplantation and Heart-lung Transplantation

Hari R. Mallidi • Jatin Anand • Robert C. Robbins

Human lung transplantation, performed as a single lung, double lung, or heart-lung bloc, has emerged as a life-saving procedure for patients with end-stage pulmonary disease. With improvement of operative techniques, organ preservation, and immunosuppressive regimens, combined heart-lung and isolated lung transplantation have become common treatments for patients with a variety of end-stage disease entities. To date, 3703 combined heart-lung transplants and 43,428 lung transplants have been reported worldwide. Although the number of heart-lung transplants performed annually has declined in recent years, the number of single-lung transplantation (SLT) procedures remains stable, accompanied by a steady increase in bilateral lung transplant procedures (Fig. 61-1). Clinical progress in thoracic organ transplantation has been considerable, yet significant barriers that limit the scope of these procedures still remain. These include donor organ shortage, limited preservation techniques, graft rejection, and infectious complications. This chapter summarizes the state of the art in combined heart-lung and isolated lung transplantation.

# **LUNG TRANSPLANTATION**History of Lung Transplantation

In 1949, Henry Metras described many of the important technical concepts for lung transplantation, including preservation of the left atrial cuff for the pulmonary venous anastomoses and reimplantation of an aortic patch containing the origin of the bronchial arteries to prevent bronchial dehiscence.<sup>2</sup> Airway dehiscence was a major obstacle in experimental lung transplantation, and he proposed that preservation of the bronchial arterial supply was critical to airway healing. Unfortunately, this technique was technically cumbersome and never gained widespread popularity. In the 1960s, Blumenstock and Khan advocated transection of the transplant bronchus close to the lung parenchyma to prevent ischemic bronchial necrosis.3 Additional surgical modifications were developed to prevent bronchial anastomotic complications, including telescoping of the bronchial anastomosis, described by Veith in 1970,4 and coverage of the anastomosis with an omental pedicle flap, described by the Toronto group in 1982.<sup>5</sup> Corticosteroids were found to be another contributor to poor bronchial healing,<sup>6</sup> a problem ameliorated by the introduction of cyclosporine immunosuppression. Thus, by the 1970s, the stage was set for successful lung transplantation in the human.

The first human lung transplant was described in 1963 by Hardy and colleagues at the University of Mississippi.<sup>7</sup> The patient, a 58-year-old man with lung cancer, survived 18 days postoperatively. Over the next two decades, nearly 40 lung transplants were performed without long-term success. In 1986, the Toronto Lung Transplant Group reported the first successful series of single-lung transplants with longterm survival.8 Improved immunosuppression, along with careful recipient and donor selection, was pivotal to their success. For patients with bilateral lung disease, en bloc double lung replacement was introduced by Patterson in 1988 as an alternative to heart-lung transplantation with a domino procedure in which the explanted heart was offered to a second recipient with end-stage heart disease.9 This technique was later replaced by sequential bilateral lung transplantation, described by Pasque and colleagues in 1990.10 More recent operative innovations include living lobar transplantation, performed for the first time by Vaughn Starnes at Stanford in 1992.11

Lung transplantation has seen a steady growth over the past decade, with over 3800 procedures reported to the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) registry in 2013. Currently there are 153 centers reporting lung transplant data, with more than half of these performing more than 10 transplants per year. Although the number of single-lung transplants performed has been relatively stable since the mid-1990s, bilateral lung transplant procedures have shown a consistent growth in volume. I

# Indications for Lung Transplantation

#### **GENERAL GUIDELINES**

Organ allocation for lung transplantation underwent a major change in 2005 that has significantly affected the process of recipient selection. Historically, lung allocation was determined strictly by the amount of time a patient spent on the

waiting list (matching for size and blood group). Consequently, the limited supply of donor organs resulted in an increasing number of patients on the waiting list with progressively longer wait times (Fig. 61-2).<sup>12</sup> To address these shortcomings, the organ allocation system was revised in 2005 to prioritize medical urgency and expected outcome after transplantation. Under this system, prioritization is based on a lung allocation score (LAS) that is calculated based on the following clinical criteria: age, height, weight, lung diagnosis code, functional status, diabetes, assisted ventilation, supplemental O<sub>2</sub> requirement, percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC), pulmonary artery systemic pressure, mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, current PCO2, highest PCO2, lowest PCO2, change in PCO<sub>2</sub>, 6-minute walk distance, and serum creatinine. These values can be entered into an online calculator to derive the LAS (https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/resources/allocation-calculators/las-calculator/). Based on these criteria, the waitlist urgency measure (defined as the expected number of

![](_page_1_Figure_5.jpeg)

days during the next year on the waiting list without a transplant) is subtracted from the posttransplant survival measure (defined as the expected number of days lived during the first year after transplantation) to determine the net transplant benefit. This raw allocation score is then normalized to a scale of 0 to 100 to calculate the LAS. In this scoring system, posttransplant survival is limited to 1 year because the predictive variables are only relevant in the early postoperative period. <sup>13</sup>

The rationale for approaching recipient selection from the perspective of transplant benefit is based on the premise that patient selection for lung transplantation must balance the anticipated survival after transplantation (currently at a median of 5 years) with projected life expectancy on the waiting list. Although waiting times have historically averaged 432 days, the institution of the LAS has reduced this period to an average of 262 days.<sup>14</sup> Nevertheless, mortality while on the waiting list remains at nearly 20%, so it is imperative to identify recipients as early as possible within the "transplant window."15 Ideally, recipient evaluation should select individuals with progressively disabling pulmonary disease who still possess the capacity for full rehabilitation after transplantation. Much of the current success in lung transplantation stems from improvement in recipient selection, because early attempts were thwarted by selection of patients with prohibitive operative risk factors. Candidates should have a less than 50% 2- to 3-year predicted survival despite appropriate medical or alternative surgical strategies. Disabling symptoms prompting consideration for transplantation typically include dyspnea, cyanosis, syncope, and hemoptysis. Potential recipients are identified by their local primary physicians and referred to transplantation centers for further evaluation.

Tests required for transplant listing are reviewed in Table 61-1. Diagnostic studies that are particularly useful in evaluating potential recipients include full pulmonary function tests, an exercise performance test, electrocardiogram,

A negative sputum cytology, thoracic computed tomographic (CT) scan, bronchoscopy, otolaryngologic evaluation, and carotid duplex scan are required. In addition, left heart catheterization and coronary angiography should be performed in recipient candidates who have a history of smoking.

Patients deemed suitable for transplantation during the initial evaluation are subjected to a final phase of testing (see Table 61-1). If accepted by the transplant review committee, they are listed on the national transplant registry based on LAS. Listed candidates should be seen every 3 to 6 months at the transplant center and regularly by their primary physicians, to maintain optimal medical condition. If appropriate, a period of exercise rehabilitation and nutritional modification may be initiated. Most transplant centers require patients to reside within several hours of the center by automobile or air charter.

ABO compatibilities are strictly adhered to, because isolated cases of hyperacute rejection have been reported in transplants performed across ABO barriers. <sup>16</sup> Donor-to-recipient lung volume matching is an important consideration. According to the 27th-30th ISHLT registry reports, taller donor heights have been shown to correlate with a lower risk for 1-year posttransplant mortality. <sup>1,17</sup> A range of acceptable donor heights is mandated at the time of patient listing. However, the best parameter for size matching remains controversial.

Height alone is an important predictor of lung size, yet gender affects lung size independently of height.<sup>18</sup> Therefore, another parameter commonly reported is the predicted total lung capacity (pTLC), which is calculated from a regression equation based on both gender and height. The pTLC of a 170-cm male is 6.5 L while that of a 170-cm female is 5.4 L, illustrating the importance of gender considerations and the utility of the pTLC.

Current ISHLT Guidelines recommend that donor pTLC should be matched to within 75 to 125% of the recipients pTLC. <sup>19</sup> Eberlein and colleagues evaluated a pTLC donor-to-recipient ratio (pTLC donor/pTLC recipient) in a retrospective registry study of over 10,000 patients and found an association between a high pTLC ratio (suggesting an oversized allograft) and improved survival after lung transplant. <sup>20</sup> The authors concluded that the pTLC ratio is an independent predictor of death in the first year after lung transplant and should therefore be carefully considered.

Preoperative comparison of donor and recipient chest tomography typically involves matching the vertical (apex to diaphragm along the midclavicular line) and transverse (level of diaphragmatic dome) radiologic dimensions. Donor lung dimensions should not be greater than 4 cm over those of the recipient. If needed, donor lungs may be downsized by lobectomy or wedge resection. As high-resolution three-dimensional CT imaging and advanced software becomes more readily available, lung-size-matching using newer technologies continues to emerge.<sup>21</sup>

In contrast to renal transplantation, HLA matching is not a criterion for thoracic organ allocation. Because only short ischemic times are tolerated by lung and heart-lung blocs, it is not possible to perform this tissue typing preoperatively.<sup>22</sup> However, several retrospective studies have been performed evaluating the influence of HLA matching on long-term graft survival and development of obliterative bronchiolitis (OB).

Wisser and colleagues examined the relationship between HLA matching and long-term survival in 78 lung transplant recipients, finding improved graft survival with matching at the HLA-B locus.<sup>23</sup> In a retrospective study of 74 lung transplant patients, Iwaki and coworkers also correlated matching at the HLA-B and HLA-DR loci with improved graft survival.<sup>24</sup> These studies suggest a relationship between HLA matching and long-term graft function.

Once an appropriate donor-recipient pairing is made, the recipient is screened for preformed antibodies against a panel of random donors. A percent reactive antibody (PRA) level greater than 25 prompts a prospective-specific crossmatch between the donor and recipient. A positive crossmatch indicates the presence of antidonor circulating antibodies in the recipient, which would likely lead to hyperacute rejection. In the event of a positive crossmatch, the donor organ cannot be accepted for that recipient.

#### **DISEASE-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES**

Common indications for lung transplantation are listed in Table 61-2, with listing criteria given in Table 61-3.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents the most common indication for lung transplantation, accounting for 36% of lung transplants performed each year.<sup>25</sup> Decision making with respect to referral for transplantation and listing is based on worsening clinical deterioration as quantified by the BODE index. This predictive tool takes into account body mass index (B), degree of airflow obstruction (O), dyspnea (D, measured by the modified Medical Research Council MMRC dyspnea scale), and exercise capacity (E, measured by a 6-minute walk test).<sup>26</sup>

The BODE index score ranges from 0 to 10, and patients are considered for transplant with a score of 7 to 10, because median survival in this cohort is only 3 years.<sup>26</sup> In patients with COPD who have apically predominant emphysema, lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) may represent an alternative strategy to postpone or eliminate the need for transplantation. Patients who have undergone pleurodesis or who have advanced disease (FEV, and DLco < 20% or significant pulmonary hypertension) are not eligible for LVRS.<sup>27</sup> Based on the National Emphysema Treatment Trial, which studied the benefit of LVRS, a cohort of transplant-eligible high-risk patients (median survival of 3 years with medical therapy) was identified in which FEV, was less than 20% and either DLCO less than 20% or homogeneously distributed emphysema was present.<sup>27</sup> The decision to perform singleversus double-lung transplantation (DLT) in a patient with COPD must take into account the patient's ability to tolerate single-lung ventilation, cardiopulmonary bypass, and the risk of ventilation-perfusion mismatch in single-lung transplant when compressive atelectasis and restriction occurs in the donor lung. Interestingly, a statistical model derived from United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) data between 1987 and 2004 estimated that 45% of COPD patients would gain a survival benefit of 1 year after double-lung transplant, compared with only 22% of patients who underwent singlelung transplant.<sup>28</sup>

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) represents the second most common indication for lung transplantation world-wide, accounting for just over 20% of all lung transplants.<sup>17</sup> Median survival from the time of diagnosis is only 2.5 to 3.5 years, suggesting that transplant referral should be made as soon as histologic or radiographic evidence of the disease

# TABLE 61-3: Listing Criteria Specific to the Disease Entities Commonly Evaluated for **Lung Transplantation**

#### Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

- BODE index of 7 to 10 or at least one of the following:
- · History of hospitalization for exacerbation associated with acute hypercapnia (PCO, exceeding 50 mm Hg)
- Pulmonary hypertension or cor pulmonale, or both, despite oxygen therapy
- FEV, < 20% and either DL<sub>CO</sub> < 20% or homogenous distribution of emphysema

### **Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis**

- Histologic or radiographic evidence of UIP and any of the following:
  - A DL<sub>CO</sub> < 39% predicted
- A 10% or greater decrement in FVC during 6 months of
- · A decrease in pulse oximetry < 88% during a 6-minute walk test
- Honeycombing on HRCT (fibrosis score > 2)

#### Cystic Fibrosis

- FEV, < 30% of predicted, or rapidly declining lung function if FEV, > 30% (females and patients < 18 years of age have a poorer prognosis; consider earlier listing) and/or any of the following:
  - · Increasing oxygen requirements
  - Hypercapnia
  - Pulmonary hypertension

is present. Listing a patient with IPF must take into account the fact that many patients have an indolent form of the disease, and numerous studies have identified the following risk factors for rapid decline in patients with histologic or radiographic evidence of IPF:29

- DLCO less than 39% of predicted
- 10% or greater decrement in FVC during a 6-month
- Oxygen saturation less than 88% during a 6-minute walk
- Honeycombing on CT scan

Traditionally, IPF patients have been considered for either SLT or DLT. However, recent data suggest that there may

be a survival advantage for double-lung over single-lung transplant—particularly among high-risk patients (defined as LAS > 52). $^{30}$ 

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the third most common indication for lung transplant, accounting for 16% of the total number of transplants performed.25 In these patients, bilateral sepsis mandates removal of both native lungs. In a landmark study from the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Kerem and colleagues established that CF patients with an FEV, of less than 30% of predicted experienced a 2-year mortality rate of 50%.31 However, subsequent risk stratification models have challenged these findings and presented conflicting data on the question of life expectancy in CF. Therefore, the current ISHLT guidelines state that an FEV less than 30% should prompt a referral to a transplant center with the decision to proceed with listing dependent on other indicators of disease severity such as oxygen-dependent respiratory failure, hypercapnia, and pulmonary hypertension.<sup>32</sup> CF recipients should have an otolaryngologic evaluation before being placed on an active waiting list. Most of these patients require endoscopic maxillary antrostomies for sinus access and monthly antibiotic irrigation to decrease the bacterial load of the upper respiratory tract. This measure has decreased the incidence of serious posttransplant bacterial infections.<sup>33</sup>

Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension represents 3.3% of the total lung transplantation volume worldwide. 25 Survival with this condition has improved dramatically with the institution of vasodilator therapy, with 5-year survival of 55% on epoprostenol compared with 28% among historical controls.<sup>34</sup> Listing for transplantation is indicated when a patient remains in NYHA Class III or IV after 3 months of therapy (often seen in the setting of declining 6-minute walk test, cardiac index of < 2 L/min/m<sup>2</sup>, or right atrial pressure > 15 mm Hg).<sup>29</sup>

Sarcoidosis accounts for 2.6% of all lung transplants.<sup>25</sup> The natural course of this disease can be highly variable, but in general patients should be referred for transplant if they develop NYHA class III or IV symptoms. Impairment of exercise tolerance and hypoxemia at rest, pulmonary hypertension, or right atrial pressure greater than 15 mm Hg serve as general guidelines for listing.31

Less than 2% of all single- and bilateral-lung transplants are retransplantations.25 Overall, survival is poor compared with first-time transplantation, although certain subsets of patients perform better than others. In fact, the Pulmonary Retransplant Registry has collected data from 230 patients at over 40 centers and found that 1-year survival of ambulatory, nonventilated patients undergoing retransplantation after 1991 is comparable with first-time transplants.<sup>35</sup>

# Impact of the Lung Allocation Score

Since the introduction of the LAS in 2005, there has been a decrease in waitlist time and waitlist mortality with a concurrent increase in the number of transplants performed per year (Fig. 61-3). Although early data have suggested that the 1-year survival since introduction of the LAS has not changed, more recent data indicate that the posttransplant survival

beyond 1 year may be lower.<sup>36</sup> This is in accordance with the fact that sicker patients are being prioritized, including more that are bridged to transplantation with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (Fig. 61-4). Furthermore, the most common diagnoses are also changing, with more

ECMO, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.)

IPF and less COPD patients being selected for transplantation (Fig. 61-5)<sup>1</sup> Long-term data revealing the impact of the LAS are only recently becoming available and remain under intense investigation.

Previously, ISHLT and UNOS registries have demonstrated that DLT in COPD patients is associated with improved outcomes. Furthermore, SLT and DLT have shown similar outcomes in IPF patients. However, these data are largely from pre-LAS cohorts. In the post-LAS era, reanalysis has shown that DLT is associated with improved outcomes in both propensity-matched and unmatched cohorts of allcomers undergoing lung transplantation, as well as in analyses of patients specifically undergoing transplant for IPF.<sup>37</sup> For patients undergoing lung transplant for COPD, propensity-matched cohorts in the post-LAS era show similar survival whether SLT or DLT is employed.<sup>37</sup> These outcomes in the post-LAS era cohorts are contrary to previously published findings, and are likely explained by the fact that sicker, older patients with more comorbidities, of worse functional status, and with baseline oxygen requirements are being prioritized as a consequence of the LAS algorithm.

Analysis of post-LAS registry data in patients undergoing transplant for IPAH has revealed that those listed for transplantation have significantly worse comorbidities yet have a lower wait-list mortality and a higher incidence of transplant as compared to pre-LAS era.<sup>38</sup> Furthermore, those receiving double lung transplant in the post-LAS era have a survival advantage over those in the pre-LAS era while those receiving heart-lung transplant do not see the same survival advantage when compared to the pre-LAS cohort.<sup>38</sup> Again, these outcomes are contradictory to previously published registry analyses focused on pre-LAS cohorts.

FIGURE 61-5 Major indications for lung transplantation in adults over time.

These recent analyses help to illustrate the fact that the institution of the LAS has had a dramatic impact on lung transplantation in ways that remain largely uncharacterized. Ongoing evaluation of post-LAS cohorts with an emphasis on long-term outcomes is an area of intense focus within the lung-transplant community.

# Contraindications to Lung Transplantation

There are well-established contraindications to lung transplantation (Table 61-4). In general, transplantation is an option that is restricted to patients less than 65 years old, although 9% of recipients in the first half of 2008 exceeded this cutoff.<sup>25</sup> Significant multisystem disease is a contraindication, although multiorgan transplants have occasionally been performed. Absolute contraindications include renal dysfunction, malignancy (bronchoalveolar carcinoma is a contraindication but not nonmelanoma skin cancer), infection with HIV, hepatitis B antigen positivity or hepatitis C infection with biopsy-proven liver disease, infection with pan-resistant respiratory flora, active or recent cigarette

smoking, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, severe psychiatric illness, noncompliance with medical care, extreme obesity, progressive unintentional weight loss, malnutrition, and absence of a consistent and reliable social support network.<sup>29</sup> Relative contraindications include active extrapulmonary infection, symptomatic osteoporosis, and recent history of active peptic ulcer disease. Cigarette smokers must quit smoking and remain abstinent for several months before transplantation. Patients with histories of previous thoracic surgery are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. For patients who require systemic corticosteroids, tapering to the lowest tolerable level, preferably below 10 mg/day, is critical to prevent airway healing complications. Finally, mechanical ventilation is generally considered a contraindication to transplantation; repeated studies have shown that these patients have significantly worse immediate and long-term survival after transplantation.<sup>39</sup> It is important that recipient candidates be educated about lifestyle modifications necessary for the success of a transplant, and willingness to comply with immunosuppression regimens and extensive posttransplant medical and surgical follow-up is mandatory.

# Recipient Management After Listing

It is essential that a candidate's medical condition be optimized before transplantation. Supplemental oxygen is recommended for any patient exhibiting arterial hypoxemia, defined as either an arterial oxygen saturation less than 90% or an arterial PO<sub>2</sub> less than 60 mm Hg at rest, during exertion, or while asleep. Fluid balance is optimized with restriction of dietary water and salt in conjunction with diuretic therapy. Care must be taken with the use of loop diuretics, as these can incite a metabolic alkalosis that can impair the effectiveness of plasma carbon dioxide as a stimulus for breathing.

Primary pulmonary hypertension often requires the use of supplemental oxygen to prevent hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction and secondary erythropoiesis. Pulmonary vasodilator therapy with the use of calcium channel blockers and continuous prostacyclin infusions presents another therapeutic option in the management of these patients. Although these drugs exhibit potent systemic effects and must be used with caution, the response rate for calcium channel blockers is approximately 20%. Although a favorable response to short-acting vasodilators during cardiac catheterization is predictive of a successful response to calcium channel therapy, this trend is not seen in long-term prostacyclin infusion.

Interstitial lung disease in patients awaiting transplantation results from a wide variety of diffuse inflammatory processes such as sarcoidosis, asbestosis, and collagen-vascular diseases. Increases in pulmonary vascular resistance leading to right-sided heart failure are thought to arise from interstitial inflammatory infiltrates that entrap and eventually destroy septal arterioles, thus reducing the distensibility of the remaining pulmonary vessels. <sup>41</sup> This process, coupled with closure of peripheral bronchioles, results in arterial hypoxemia, further

aggravating pulmonary hypertension. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment in this class of diseases. The adverse effects of steroids on airway healing are well established,<sup>6,42</sup> and mandate significant dose reductions in anticipation of transplantation.

The multisystem manifestations of CF, particularly chronic bronchopulmonary infection, malabsorption, malnutrition, and diabetes mellitus, pose difficult management problems in potential transplant recipients. These patients require aggressive chest physiotherapy, antibiotics, enteral or parenteral nutritional supplementation, and tight serum glucose control.<sup>43</sup>

# Organ Procurement and Preservation

#### **DONOR SELECTION**

Standard criteria have been established for donor selection (Table 61-5). 44,45 Donors must have sustained irreversible brain death, but owing to the susceptibility of the lungs to edema and infection in the setting of brain death and trauma, suitable organs are often difficult to obtain (available in <20% of all organ donors).

Initial donor evaluation consists of a directed history and physical examination, chest x-ray, 12-lead ECG, arterial blood gases, and serologic screening including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibodies, herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), *Toxoplasma*, and RPR. A donor age of less than 50 years is preferred. The chest x-ray should be clear and the arterial Po, should exceed 140 mm Hg on an Fio, of 40% and 300 mm Hg on an Fio, of 100%. Lung compliance can be estimated by measuring peak inspiratory pressures, which should be less than 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. Bronchoscopy should ensure the absence of purulent secretions or signs of aspiration. Finally, direct inspection and palpation of the lungs at explantation to verify full expansion of any atelectatic segments is an essential part of the donor organ evaluation.

Absolute contraindications to donation include prolonged cardiac arrest (30 minutes), arterial hypoxemia, active

malignancy (excluding basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin), and positive HIV status. Relative contraindications include thoracic trauma, sepsis, significant smoking history, prolonged severe hypotension (ie, <60 mm Hg for >6 hours), HBsAg or hepatitis C antibodies, multiple resuscitation attempts, and a prolonged high inotropic requirement (eg, dopamine in excess of 15  $\mu$ g/kg/min for 24 hours). It is important to rule out correctable metabolic or physiologic causes of cardiac rhythm disturbances and electrocardiographic anomalies (eg, brain herniation, hypothermia, hypokalemia).

Over the last decade, there has been a trend toward liberalization of standard donor selection criteria. This strategy, initiated in response to the shortage of donor organs, is employed at a large number of transplant centers. 46-50 Donors ranging in age from 50 to 64 years have been used in thoracic transplantation with good long-term graft survival.<sup>47</sup> However, reports from the ISHLT document worse outcomes in recipients of lung allografts from donors older than 55 years who had ischemic times greater than 6 to 8 hours.<sup>51</sup> In this group of recipients, long-term survival is impaired and the risk of developing bronchiolitis obliterans is increased. Smoking history is another criterion that has been liberalized, with conventional guidelines limiting donor selection to patients with less than 20 pack-years. Modified criteria allow for a more extensive smoking history, assuming there is no evidence of COPD or other lung disease on screening tests.

Traditionally, donor lungs have been ruled out for transplantation based on evidence of infection. In that regard, prolonged ventilation before brain death and procurement has been viewed as a contraindication for organ selection. However, a positive sputum Gram stain (excluding fungus), which was once considered a basis for ruling out an organ has failed to predict the development of early pneumonia, impairment of oxygenation, or duration of mechanical ventilation in the postoperative setting. 52,53 Some groups have accepted donors with small pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray, although clinical correlation is necessary. Others have selectively used donor lungs in patients with PaO, less than 300 mm Hg on Fio, of 100%. Gabbay and coworkers in Australia have adopted an aggressive approach to donor management and "organ resuscitation." 48 By manipulating donors with antibiotic therapy, chest physiotherapy, careful fluid management, ventilator adjustments, and bronchial toilet, 34% of donors with an initial PaO, less than 300 mm Hg on Fio, of 100% had increases in their PaO, becoming acceptable donors.

Two exciting and rapidly evolving areas in the field of donor organ procurement include the use of allografts obtained from donors after cardiac death (DCD) and rehabilitation of rejected organs using ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP).

In 2001, Steen and colleagues reported the first clinical lung transplant from a DCD donor (also known as a non-heart-beating donor). After a 54-year-old man expired from an acute myocardial infarction with failed resuscitation, his

next-of-kin consented to lung donation based on the patient's prior wishes. The organ was removed and assessed ex vivo before being transplanted into a 54-year-old woman with COPD.<sup>54</sup> The authors reported good functional results during the first 5 months of follow-up. This landmark report not only introduced an era of DCD lung transplantation, but also the clinical application of EVLP.

Unlike an allograft obtained from a donor after brain death (DBD), lungs from a non-heart-beating donor are exposed to a prolonged period of warm-ischemic time, in which varying degrees of hypotension and shock precede organ cooling and harvest and have unknown consequence on donor organ function. EVLP began as a tool to assess the functional status of DCD lungs and ultimately evolved into a mechanism to both assess and rehabilitate the donor allografts. In 2007, Steen and colleagues reported the first use of EVLP to not only evaluate a previously rejected donor lung, but to actually rehabilitate the discarded organ until, by all conventional measures, it was deemed suitable for transplantation. 55 Again, their experiment resulted in a landmark report demonstrating good functional outcomes after EVLP was utilized to rehabilitate and transplant a rejected donor organ.

By employment of a hyperoncotic perfusate, with carefully selected components to suit the metabolic needs of the lung, Steen's group demonstrated the ability to reduce interstitial edema, improve pulmonary vascular resistance, and increase gas exchange until the donor organ met the criteria for transplantation. Others around the world, most notably Keshavjee's group in Toronto, Canada, have contributed to the immense progress in advancing the techniques for EVLP.<sup>56,57</sup> Multiple reports have demonstrated excellent clinical outcomes.<sup>57,59</sup>

With as many as 40% of the total rejected donor lungs having only minimal microbiologic, physiologic, or histologic deficiencies, there is an incredible potential for organ rescue and significant increase in the donor pool. Ongoing research and long-term outcomes data are highly anticipated, yet the impact of this technology is already clinically apparent and is rapidly spreading throughout the world.

#### **DONOR MANAGEMENT**

The overriding goal in managing the thoracic organ donor is to maintain hemodynamic stability and pulmonary function. Patients suffering from acute brain injury are often hemodynamically unstable because of neurogenic shock, excessive fluid losses, and bradycardia. Donor lungs are prone to neurogenic pulmonary edema, aspiration, nosocomial infection, and contusion. Continuous arterial and central venous pressure monitoring, judicious fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, and inotropes are usually required.

Intravascular volume replacement should be limited to maintain the central venous pressure between 5 and 8 mm Hg. In general, crystalloid fluid boluses are to be avoided.

Diabetes insipidus is common in donors and requires the use of intravenous vasopressin (0.8 to 1.0 unit/h) to prevent excessive urine loss. Dopamine is the standard inotropic agent used to maintain adequate perfusion pressures, although alpha agonists (eg, phenylephrine) are often appropriate. Blood transfusions should be used sparingly to maintain a hemoglobin concentration of approximately 10 g/dL, ensuring adequate myocardial oxygen delivery. CMV-negative and leukocyte-filtered blood should be used whenever possible. Hypothermia should be avoided as it predisposes to ventricular arrhythmias and metabolic acidosis.

With regard to mechanical ventilation,  ${\rm Fro}_2$  values in excess of 40%, especially 100% oxygen "challenges," should be avoided, because these oxygen levels may be toxic to the denervated lung. Ventilator settings should include positive end-expiratory pressures (PEEP) between 3 and 5 cm  ${\rm H}_2{\rm O}$  to prevent atelectasis.

#### **DONOR OPERATION**

The donor operation is performed via a median sternotomy (Fig. 61-6A). After the sternum is divided, a standard chest retractor is placed, and both pleural spaces are opened followed by immediate inspection of the lungs and pleural spaces, particularly in cases involving trauma. The lungs are briefly deflated, and the pulmonary ligaments are divided inferiorly using electrocautery. After completely excising the thymic remnant, the pericardium is opened vertically and laterally on the diaphragm and cradled during dissection of the great vessels and trachea. The ascending aorta, pulmonary artery, and venae cavae are dissected. Umbilical tapes are placed around the ascending aorta and venae cavae (Fig. 61-6B). The pericardium overlying the trachea is incised vertically, and the trachea is encircled with an umbilical tape between the aorta and superior vena cava at the highest point possible and at least four rings above the carina (see Fig. 61-6B). The entire anterior pericardium is excised back to each hilum (Fig. 61-6C).

Approximately 15 minutes before applying the aortic cross-clamp, prostaglandin E, (PGE,) is infused intravenously, initially at a rate of 20 ng/kg/min, followed by incremental increases of 10 ng/kg/min to a target rate of 100 ng/kg/min (Fig. 61-6D). During PGE, infusion, the mean arterial blood pressure should be maintained at or above 55 mm Hg. Ventilation is continued with a F10, of 40% and a PEEP of 3 to 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. The donor is heparinized with 30,000 units. Cannulation of the aorta and main pulmonary artery is performed, with care taken to ensure adequate flow to both branches of the pulmonary artery during pulmonary plegia.<sup>61</sup> The superior vena cava is ligated and a transverse incision is made across the inferior vena cava. After the heart is allowed to empty, the aortic cross-clamp is applied, and 10 mL/kg of cold crystalloid cardioplegia, commonly the Stanford formulation, is rapidly infused into the aortic root with the bag under pressure at 150 mm Hg. The inferior vena cava is incised, and the

left atrial appendage is amputated to avoid cardiac distention. Although the antegrade cardioplegia is being delivered, Perfadex (Vitrolife Inc., Englewood, CO) is rapidly flushed into the main pulmonary artery at a rate of 15 mL/kg/min for 4 minutes. Ice-cold saline or Physiosol solution (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) is immediately poured over the heart and lungs. During the cardioplegic and Perfadex infusions, ventilation is maintained with half-normal tidal volumes of room air.

After delivery of plegic solutions, the lungs are deflated and the great vessels are divided. The heart is reflected anteriorly and a left atriotomy is performed, leaving a 2-cm cuff of atrium around the pulmonary vein orifices. Once this division is complete, the heart is removed from the chest. The lung bloc is then dissected free along the preesophageal plane above the level of the carina. The lungs are inflated and the trachea is stapled at the highest possible point. If needed, the bilateral lung bloc can be further separated into left and right lung blocs. The left atrial cuff containing the orifices of the pulmonary veins is divided in half vertically. The left and right pulmonary arteries are divided at their junction. Finally, the left mainstem bronchus is stapled near its junction with the trachea.

Once removed from the donor, grafts are wrapped in sterile gauze pads and immersed in ice-cold saline at 2 to  $4^{\circ}$ C in several sterile plastic bags placed within a sterile plastic container. This, in turn, is placed in an ice-filled chest and transported to the transplant center.

### ORGAN PRESERVATION AND TRANSPORT

The principal goal of preservation is to minimize injury to the allograft from ischemia and reperfusion. 62 Ischemia-reperfusion injury is mediated by reactive oxygen species, which disrupt the homeostatic mechanisms in myocytes and endothelial cells. As receptors for leukocyte adhesion molecules are upregulated and leukocyte chemotactic factors released, an inflammatory response ensues, leading to cellular injury. Several approaches for minimizing ischemia-reperfusion injury have developed, including donor pretreatment, use of specialized preservation solutions, and recipient treatments.

Hypothermia is considered by many to be the most important method of organ preservation. It works by reducing tissue metabolic demand by up to 99%. During explantation, organs are flushed with cold plegic solutions (0 to 10°C, depending on the institution and solution employed). Organs are stored at 0 to 10°C, and during implantation they are covered with gauze soaked in saline slush or recipients are cooled through CPB.

A variety of crystalloid pulmonary artery flush solutions are used worldwide, and they can be divided into two categories based on their electrolyte compositions: intracellular and extracellular. Intracellular solutions contain moderate-to-high concentrations of potassium and little calcium and sodium. Euro-Collins, University of Wisconsin (UW), and Cardiazol are examples. Extracellular

solutions contain high concentrations of sodium and low-to-moderate concentrations of potassium. Low-potassium dextran is an example of this type of solution (eg, Perfadex). Although Euro-Collins is the most frequently used preservation solution, there is a growing body of evidence in support of low potassium, dextran-containing extracel-lular solutions. <sup>63-65</sup>

Prostaglandins are commonly used for donor pretreatment and as an additive in pulmonary flush solutions. The administration of PGE<sub>1</sub> (a potent vasodilator) counteracts reflex pulmonary vasoconstriction induced by the cold flush and permits uniform distribution of perfusate throughout the lung. Studies in large animals also suggest that PGE<sub>1</sub> treatment may minimize reperfusion injury through its antiinflammatory properties. Another commonly used pretreatment strategy is steroid treatment. Administration of intravenous methylprednisone to the donor inactivates lymphocytes, which are thought to mediate ischemic lung graft injury.

Studies suggest that lung graft function is improved when the explanted organ is inflated, 100% oxygen is used for the inflation, and transport is carried out at 10°C.<sup>67</sup> Research in the field of lung preservation has recently focused on the role of various flush and storage solution additives, such as antioxidants, which may act as free radical scavengers. Other additives shown to decrease reperfusion injury in research models include nitric oxide donors and phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Areas of ongoing research include the development of leukocyte depletion strategies, examining the role of gene therapy to modify donor organ susceptibility to ischemia-reperfusion injury, and the development of colloid-based perfusates.

These preservation techniques, coupled with streamlined donor and recipient protocols, have permitted procurements as far as 1000 miles from the transplant center. Extensive communication and coordination must be maintained between the organ procurement agency, donor-recipient operative teams, medical centers, and abdominal procurement teams. Worldwide, the major procurement agencies include the UNOS in the United States, Multiple Organ Retrieval in Canada, and the EURO Transplant Organization in Europe.

# **Recipient Operation**

The recipient operation proceeds in two phases. The first is excision of the native organ(s) and the second is implantation of the allograft. Cardiopulmonary bypass is occasionally required for lung transplantation. Regardless, CPB should be available as standby at all times. In our practice, we have favored the use of CPB during bilateral lung transplantation for a variety of reasons. There is improved exposure of the hilar structures, which is particularly helpful in patients with dense adhesions and bronchial collaterals. CPB allows for early pneumonectomies without hemodynamic or respiratory instability, and ischemic time

of the second lung is substantially reduced compared with off-CPB bilateral lung transplants. Its use also prevents overperfusion of the first lung graft with the entire cardiac output. In patients with suppurative lung disease, the use of CPB facilitates careful washout of the distal trachea and proximal bronchi to prevent contamination of the first implanted lung. Others prefer to avoid CPB, as it may be associated with increased blood loss, transfusion needs, and reperfusion injury. More detailed experimental and clinical studies are needed to resolve these questions. At present, the need for CBP should be determined on a case-by-case basis.

Anesthetic monitoring includes arterial pressure monitoring, pulse oximetry, continuous electrocardiography, pulmonary artery catheter monitoring, temperature monitoring, and urine output monitoring. The use of double-lumen endotracheal tubes is particularly helpful, allowing for single-lung ventilation during certain portions of the dissection. Large-bore intravenous lines are placed for volume infusion. Transesophageal echocardiography is often performed during the procedure.

### SINGLE LUNG TRANSPLANTATION

If possible, the poorer functioning lung (as determined by preoperative ventilation-perfusion scan) is selected for replacement. The patient is placed in a standard thoracotomy position with access to the groin, should CPB be needed. A posterolateral thoracotomy is made at the level of the fourth or fifth intercostal space. Adhesions are lysed and the hilar dissection performed. The pulmonary artery, the superior and inferior pulmonary veins, and the mainstem bronchus are isolated. A trial occlusion of the pulmonary artery is used to determine whether the procedure can be conducted without CPB. If the occlusion is tolerated, the pulmonary artery is ligated and divided distal to the upper lobe branch. The pulmonary veins are also ligated and divided. The mainstem bronchus is stapled and divided, and the native lung is explanted.

The donor lung is removed from its transport container and prepared for implantation. The donor bronchus is opened and secretions are aspirated and cultured. The bronchus is trimmed, leaving two cartilaginous rings proximal to the orifice of the upper lobe. Any remaining pericardial and lymphatic tissue is removed, and the left atrial cuff is trimmed as needed. The donor lung is then placed in the recipient's chest and covered with saline slush and iced laparotomy pads.

The sequence of anastomoses is a matter of preference, although most perform the deepest anastomosis (the bronchial anastomosis) first and then proceed to the more superficial ones. The bronchial anastomosis is fashioned with 4-0 polypropylene suture. We favor a continuous suture technique for the entire anastomosis, although the membranous portion can be sewn with interrupted suture. Variations on the endto-end bronchial anastomosis include the use of a telescoping technique, in which the donor bronchus is intussuscepted

into the recipient bronchus, and an omental pedicle flap is placed around the anastomosis. These techniques were developed to prevent bronchial anastomotic dehiscence but are now rarely performed.

Once the bronchial anastomosis is complete, attention is turned to the anastomoses of the pulmonary veins. A sidebiting clamp is applied to the left atrium to include the pulmonary veins. The recipient pulmonary vein stumps are opened and the intervening atrial tissue is cut. This creates a cuff that is anastomosed to the donor atrial remnant using continuous 4-0 polypropylene suture. (This suture is not tied down until reperfusion.) Donor and recipient pulmonary arteries are anastomosed with 5-0 polypropylene suture. Arteries must be trimmed to an appropriate length before fashioning the anastomosis, because kinking can occur upon graft inflation if the vessels are left too long. The pulmonary artery anastomosis is then de-aired. The lung is inflated, and the pulmonary artery clamp is temporarily released to allow flushing of air through the atrial suture line. The left atrial clamp is removed to allow retrograde de-airing of the atrial anastomosis. The pulmonary venous anastomosis is then

After hemostasis is ensured, apical and basal chest tubes are inserted. The ribs are reapproximated and the chest is closed in standard fashion. The double lumen endotracheal tube is exchanged for a single-lumen tube and bronchoscopy is performed to evaluate the bronchial anastomosis.

#### **BILATERAL LUNG TRANSPLANTATION**

Bilateral lung transplantation is performed as sequential single-lung transplants. Although the traditional approach to this technique has been to access the chest via bilateral anterior thoracosternotomy (clamshell) incisions, we have recently transitioned our practice to a median sternotomy approach. The lung with the least amount of function (as determined by a preoperative ventilation-perfusion scan) is removed first and replaced with an allograft as described for SLT above. Once ventilation and perfusion are established in the first allograft, the remaining lung is explanted and the second allograft is implanted. Bilateral chest tubes are placed and the chest is closed. Bronchoscopy is performed to evaluate the bronchial anastomoses.

Although single-lung transplants are usually performed off CBP, the majority of double-lung transplants are still performed on-pump. The use of CPB allows for improved exposure, shorter graft ischemic times, controlled reperfusion, and the use of leukocyte-depleting filters. As the risk of bleeding may be increased with CPB, strategies have been developed to minimize the chance of hemorrhage. These include the use of heparin-coated CPB circuits as well as the argon beam coagulator. Despite these maneuvers, there remains considerable risk associated with CPB, and many centers prefer to perform all lung transplants off-pump if possible.

# Postoperative Management

#### **GRAFT PHYSIOLOGY**

Denervation of the lungs results in a diminished cough reflex and impairment of mucociliary clearance mechanisms. This predisposes recipients to pulmonary infections and necessitates aggressive postoperative pulmonary toilet. Moreover, in the transplanted lung, ischemia-reperfusion injury, along with disrupted pulmonary lymphatics, may result in increased vascular permeability with varying degrees of interstitial edema.

# CLINICAL MANAGEMENT IN THE EARLY POSTOPERATIVE PERIOD

Early postoperative management centers around careful fluid balance and ventilatory management. The primary objective in the immediate postoperative period is to maintain adequate perfusion and gas exchange while minimizing intravenous fluid administration, cardiac work, and barotrauma. Barotrauma and high airway pressures can compromise bronchial mucosal flow. Therefore, lower tidal volumes and flow rates may be necessary to limit peak airway pressures to less than 40 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. After arrival in the ICU, ventilator settings are adjusted every 30 minutes to achieve an arterial PO, greater than 75 mm Hg on an Fio, of 40%, an arterial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) between 30 and 40 mm Hg, and a pH between 7.35 and 7.45. Pulmonary toilet with endotracheal suctioning is an effective means of reducing mucus plugging and atelectasis. Ventilatory weaning is initiated after the patient is stable, awake, and alert, with extubation typically achieved within 24 hours. Subsequent pulmonary care consists of vigorous diuresis, supplemental oxygen for several days, continued aggressive pulmonary toilet, incentive spirometry, and serial chest x-rays.

A diffuse interstitial infiltrate is often found on early postoperative chest x-rays. Previously referred to as a *reimplantation response*, this finding is better defined as graft edema owing to inadequate preservation, reperfusion injury, or early rejection.<sup>69</sup> It appears that the degree of pulmonary edema is inversely related to the quality of preservation. Judicious administration of fluid and loop diuretics is required to maintain fluid balance and minimize this pulmonary edema.

Early lung graft dysfunction occurs in less than 15% of transplants, and is manifest as persistent marginal gas exchange without evidence of infection or rejection. This primary graft failure often results from ischemia-reperfusion injury and histologically evident as diffuse alveolar damage. Of course, technical causes of graft failure such as pulmonary venous anastomotic stenosis or thrombosis must always be considered. In cases of persistent, severe pulmonary graft dysfunction refractory to mechanical ventilatory maneuvers, ECMO<sup>71</sup> and inhaled nitric oxide<sup>72</sup> have been used successfully to stabilize gas exchange. Urgent retransplantation can also be considered if other interventions fail.

# IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE MANAGEMENT: EARLY AND LATE POSTOPERATIVE REGIMENS

Immunosuppression protocols vary from center to center. In our practice, we typically administer induction therapy of either rabbit antithymocyte globulin (RATG) at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg on POD 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 or daclizumab at 1 mg/kg (first dose given in OR then every other week for four additional doses). For highly sensitized patients, plasmapheresis with a 1:1.5 volume exchange with fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) is performed intraoperatively, along with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), which is started at 2 g/kg before releasing the cross-clamp. Methylprednisolone is given at 500 mg IV after protamine administration, and a stat retrospective crossmatch is performed.

On POD 1, T- and B-cell subset counts are performed and if the cytotoxic crossmatch is positive, RATG is given in 2 doses at 0.75 mg/kg. If the crossmatch is negative or pulmonary edema is present or expected from RATG, daclizumab is administered at 1 mg/kg and repeated every 14 days for a total of five doses. Methylprednisolone is given at 125 mg IV every 8 hours for three doses, CellCept is given at 500 mg PO BID, and Prograf is given at 0.5 mg BID and titrated to a level of 12 to 15 ng/mL. On POD 2, prednisone is started at 0.5 mg/kg PO BID. Hereafter, the patient is maintained on prednisone, Prograf, and CellCept. For sensitized patients, plasmapheresis is repeated in a 1:1.5 volume exchange with 1/2 5% albumin and 1/2 FFP. If the patient was given RATG, a second dose of 0.75 mg/kg is administered. Otherwise, IVIG 100 mg/kg is given. Plasmapheresis is repeated on POD 3 and 4, along with IVIG at 100 mg/kg. Plasmapheresis is completed on POD 5, with administration of IVIG at 1 g/kg on POD 5 and 6. A donor-specific antibody is sent before IVIG on POD 5 and after IVIG on POD 6. Finally, on POD 7 T- and B-cell subset counts are measured (and repeated weekly thereafter) along with administration of Rituximab for two doses with one dose of 375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> given at POD 7 and a second dose given a week later.

#### INFECTION PROPHYLAXIS

Antiviral and antifungal prophylaxis remain important components of the postoperative management strategy in heartlung and lung transplant recipients. Many centers employ CMV prophylaxis with ganciclovir for any CMV-positive recipient and in any CMV-negative recipient receiving an allograft from a CMV-positive donor. Ganciclovir is typically given for a several week course, and can be associated with leukopenia. Some patients may require G-CSF if their white blood cell count falls below 4000. Fungal prophylaxis against mucosal candida infection includes use of itraconazole and nystatin swish and swallow. Pneumocystis carinii prophylaxis consists of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or aerosolized pentamidine. In the immediate postoperative period, Aspergillus colonization is inhibited by the use of aerosolized amphotericin B. For Toxoplasma-negative recipients of grafts from Toxoplasma-positive patients,

pyrimethamine prophylaxis is maintained for the first 6 months after transplantation.

# GRAFT SURVEILLANCE: PATIENT FOLLOW-UP SCHEDULE

Routine clinical follow-up is required to monitor graft function and modify immunosuppressive regimens. Regular surveillance protocols developed to monitor graft function typically consist of serial pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gases, and bronchoscopic evaluation. Surveillance is usually conducted at 2, 4 to 6, and 12 weeks, followed by 6 months after transplantation and yearly thereafter. Transbronchial biopsies are obtained from each transplanted lung, and lavage specimens are submitted for staining (ie, Gram, fungal, acid-fast bacillus, silver), culture, and cytology. In addition to routine surveillance, follow-up is often needed to address changes in clinical status. Complications related to transplantation are many, and these must be addressed carefully and expediently to prevent long-term graft failure.

# **Postoperative Complications**

Early morbidity and mortality after lung transplantation (within 30 days of operation or before initial discharge from hospital) are most commonly a result of primary graft failure or infection. Late mortality is most commonly caused by OB or infection.<sup>73</sup> Causes of death at various time points after transplantation have been compiled by the ISHLT and are presented in Fig. 61-7.

## **HEMORRHAGE**

Perioperative hemorrhage is an infrequent but significant cause of early death in heart-lung and lung transplantation. The majority of perioperative hemorrhagic complications stem from operating in the midst of dense adhesions caused by previous operations or inflammation from chronic lung infection. As mentioned previously, meticulous attention to hemostasis is mandatory, and all available means should be used to achieve a dry field on completion of the operation.

#### HYPERACUTE REJECTION

ABO matching of donor and recipient has decreased the rate of hyperacute rejection. This complication, which is almost universally fatal, is mediated by preformed antibodies in the recipient that recognize antigens on the donor vascular endothelium. This humoral immune response results in activation of inflammatory and coagulation cascades, resulting in extensive thrombosis of graft vessels and subsequent graft failure. To reduce the incidence of hyperacute rejection, a prospective crossmatch should be performed in recipients with a PRA greater than 25%.

Infection is the major cause of death in the first year after transplant, while bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome is the major cause of death after the early post-transplant period.

# EARLY GRAFT DYSFUNCTION AND PRIMARY GRAFT FAILURE

Graft dysfunction in the first few days after transplantation is common. It is often referred to as the "reimplantation response," manifest by abnormal lung function, pulmonary edema, and pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray. This phenomenon is thought to be linked to ischemia and reperfusion. Other contributing factors may also include allograft contusion, inadequate preservation, or use of cardiopulmonary bypass during transplantation. Although most cases are mild and resolve with supportive care, some progress to primary graft failure. Reported rates of primary graft failure following lung transplantation range between 10 and 15%. Treatment may include the use of ECMO and inhaled nitric oxide. Unfortunately, primary graft failure is associated with a mortality of more than 60%.<sup>70</sup>

# **ACUTE REJECTION**

As in cardiac transplantation, the majority of acute rejection episodes occur within the first year after transplant at a rate of 36%.<sup>25</sup> Despite its prevalence, death is very rarely a direct consequence of acute rejection. It is recognized, however, that the number and severity of acute rejection episodes is a risk factor for ultimately developing obliterative bronchitis (OB).

Diagnosis of acute rejection in the early posttransplant period is often based on clinical parameters. Symptoms and signs of rejection include fever, dyspnea, impaired gas exchange (manifest as a decrease in arterial  $\rm Po_2$ ), a diminished forced expiratory volume during 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>, a measure

of airway flow), a fall in vital capacity (VC), and the development of characteristic bilateral interstitial infiltrates on chest x-ray (Fig. 61-8). After the first postoperative month, the chest x-ray is frequently normal during episodes of acute rejection, placing greater emphasis on other clinical parameters characteristic of rejection.

It is often difficult to distinguish between the diagnosis of acute lung rejection and pulmonary infection based on clinical findings alone. It is of paramount importance to distinguish between acute rejection and infection before initiating therapy. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy (with transbronchial parenchymal lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage) is the gold standard for the diagnosis of acute lung rejection and pulmonary infection. At least five biopsy specimens are taken from the lung allografts along with bronchoalveolar lavage, which is evaluated for cytology, undergoes microbial staining, and is cultured.<sup>75</sup> In addition to performing bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy in response to changes in clinical status and graft performance, most centers maintain a schedule of surveillance biopsies for lung recipients. Interestingly, surveillance bronchoscopy reveals occult rejection or infection in 17 to 25% of transbronchial biopsy specimens from asymptomatic recipients. For patients undergoing bronchoscopy because of a change in clinical condition, 50 to 72% of biopsy specimens have shown evidence of rejection or infection. In most cases, positive biopsies directly guide successful treatment of rejection or infection.<sup>76,77</sup> Acute lung rejection is histologically characterized by lymphocytic perivascular infiltrates (Fig. 61-9). A grading scheme for acute lung rejection was developed by Clelland and Colin<sup>78</sup> and is presented in

Table 61-6; a similar scheme was also developed by the Lung Rejection Study Group.<sup>75</sup>

As in cardiac transplantation, efforts are being made to develop noninvasive ways of diagnosing early acute lung rejection. Loubeyre and coworkers at the Hôpital Cardiovasculaire et Pneumologique report an association between "ground-glass" density areas seen on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and histologically confirmed

acute lung rejection in heart-lung transplant recipients.<sup>79</sup> They found that ground-glass opacities on HRCT had a sensitivity of 65% for detecting lung rejection and a specificity of 85% for detecting an acute lung complication.

Treatment strategies for rejection involve augmentation of immunosuppression. At most institutions, the timing and severity of rejection episodes dictate therapy. A typical algorithm is shown in Fig. 61-10. Rejection episodes that are graded moderate or severe are treated with a "steroid pulse" (intravenous methylprednisolone 500 to 1000 mg/day for three consecutive days), followed by augmentation of the oral prednisone maintenance dose to 0.6 mg/kg/day. This maintenance dose is then tapered to 0.2 mg/kg/day over 3 to 4 weeks. Clinical and radiographic improvement

(see Fig. 61-8B) after steroid therapy is often dramatic, rapid, and considered confirmatory of rejection. Mild episodes are initially treated by increasing oral prednisone dose, followed by a gradual taper over 3 to 4 weeks. Transbronchial biopsies are repeated 10 to 14 days following antirejection therapy to assess efficacy. Recurrent rejection episodes may be treated by a second steroid pulse and taper. Acute rejection refractory to steroid therapy may be treated with antilymphocyte preparations. Alternatively, primary immunosuppression may be switched between cyclosporine- and tacrolimus-based therapy. Finally, in especially difficult cases of persistent rejection, total lymphoid irradiation may be useful.<sup>80</sup>

#### CHRONIC REJECTION

Chronic lung allograft rejection poses the greatest limitation to the long-term benefits of lung transplantation. Chronic lung rejection most commonly presents as OB. The onset of OB typically occurs after the first 6 months to 1 year after transplantation, with a steadily increasing incidence thereafter. Recent data demonstrate that 50% of lung recipients are diagnosed with OB by the fifth postoperative year<sup>81</sup> (Fig 61-11).

Transbronchial biopsies remain the "gold standard" for diagnosing OB. The sensitivity of transbronchial biopsy for

The dashed green line shows the 95% confidence intervals. (Data from Yusen RD, Edwards LB, Kucheryavaya AY, et al: The registry of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: thirty-first adult lung and heart-lung transplant report—2014; focus theme: retransplantation, *J Heart Lung Transplant*. 2014 Oct;33(10):1009-1024.)

detecting OB has been reported between 17 and 87%.<sup>76,82</sup> Diagnostic yield of the biopsy procedure is related to the number of specimens taken, and current recommendations advise taking at least five specimens from each transplanted lung. Clearly, OB is a patchy process and therefore a large number of samples will be falsely negative owing to sampling error.

OB is a histologic diagnosis and is characterized by dense eosinophilic, submucosal scar tissue that partially or totally obliterates the lumen of small (2-mm) airways, particularly the terminal and respiratory bronchioles (Fig. 61-12). The physiologic consequences are decreased arterial Po<sub>2</sub>, FEV<sub>1</sub>, FEF<sub>25-75</sub> forced expiratory flow at 25 to 75% (midrange) of lung volumes, and FEF<sub>50</sub>/FVC (ratio of FEF<sub>50</sub> to forced vital capacity). A characteristic "bowing" of the expiratory limb of the flow-volume loop has also been associated with OB. Clinical symptoms may be nonspecific, and include cough and dyspnea with or without exertion. The term bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) was developed to refer to patients who have clinical manifestations of OB with or without proven histologic characteristics (Table 61-7). A standardized working formulation for the clinical staging of BOS was established by the ISHLT and is based on the ratio of the current FEV, to the best posttransplant FEV,. Patients with a decline of 20% or greater in their FEV, (in the absence of infection or other process) are diagnosed with BOS, irrespective of pathologic evidence of OB.74

Valentine and the Stanford group reported that measurements of small airway function (ie, FEF<sub>25-75</sub>, FEF<sub>50</sub>/FVC) are more sensitive indicators of BOS than the FEV<sub>1</sub> in bilateral lung transplant recipients.<sup>83</sup> An FEF<sub>50</sub>/FVC persistently below 0.7 for 6 consecutive weeks was the most sensitive predictor of OB. Approximately 50% of bilateral lung recipients with biopsy-proven OB developed a fall in their FEF<sub>50</sub>/FVC

nearly 4 months before fulfilling the ISHLT working group criteria for BOS.

Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that the etiology of OB stems from the injury of the bronchial epithelium by one or more mechanisms. These include gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), infection (particularly CMV), chronic inflammation owing to impaired mucociliary clearance, and immunologic mechanisms.<sup>69</sup> These insults result in airway epithelial damage and, subsequently, an exaggerated healing response. Along with this injury, there is increased expression of major histocompatibility class II antigens in the bronchial epithelium. In a recent metaanalysis, Sharples and coworkers found that acute rejection is a risk factor for later development of OB.84 In keeping with this finding is the association between BOS and decreased levels of immunosuppression (as may occur with noncompliance). Lymphocytic bronchitis and bronchiolitis were also closely associated with development of OB. CMV pneumonitis, other pulmonary infections, and HLA mismatching are also linked to the development of OB in small retrospective studies. Novick and coworkers reported on the relationship between OB, donor age, and graft ischemic times.<sup>51</sup> Using data from the ISHLT registry, they found a higher rate of OB at 3 years in recipients of grafts from donors greater than age 55 who were also subjected to 6 to 8 hours of ischemia. GERD has been recently proposed as a mechanism for the development of OB.85 Up to 75% of patients have demonstrable postoperative reflux based on pH studies, which may result from intraoperative vagal damage, impaired cough and airway mucociliary clearance, immunosuppression, or preexisting GERD.86 These patients have been shown to demonstrate a survival benefit as well as delayed onset of BOS after antireflux surgery in the postoperative setting. 87,88

The current management of OB hinges on prevention, close surveillance, and immediate therapeutic intervention when patients become symptomatic or asymptomatic physiologic changes occur. Patients are encouraged to perform incentive spirometry to prevent microatelectasis of lungs that are deprived of native innervation, lack bronchial circulation, and have impaired mucociliary clearance mechanisms. Moreover, all recipients are instructed to contact their transplant center or primary care physician on development of

respiratory tract symptoms so that pulmonary function tests can be performed. Any alterations in FEF<sub>25-75</sub>, FEF<sub>50</sub>/FVC, or specific changes in the flow-volume loop are indications for bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsy, especially in the absence of infectious bronchitis or pulmonary edema.

Augmentation of immunosuppression is the mainstay of therapy for BOS. The prednisone dose is increased to 0.6 to 1.0 mg/kg/day and slowly tapered to 0.2 mg/kg/day while concomitantly optimizing cyclosporine and azathio-prine dosing. Ganciclovir is reinstituted during treatment for those patients at risk of reactivation CMV infection, and antimicrobial therapy is directed against any organisms isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage. Follow-up pulmonary function tests are performed. Pulmonary function can be stabilized in most patients, but significant improvement is uncommon. Unfortunately, relapse rates are greater than 50% and progressive pulmonary failure or infection because of increased immunosuppression are the most common causes of death in lung transplant patients after the second year.

Retransplantation is the only option for terminal respiratory failure secondary to OB. Although survival for patients undergoing retransplantation for OB is better than for those undergoing retransplantation for other reasons, it is still worse than survival of first-time transplant recipients. Novick and coworkers recently reported results from the Pulmonary Retransplant Registry.<sup>35</sup> They reviewed survival rates in 237 patients who underwent pulmonary retransplantation between 1985 and 1996. At 1, 2, and 3 years after retransplantation, survival was 47, 40, and 33%, respectively. Survival was higher in nonventilated, ambulatory patients and their freedom for OB was comparable to first-time transplant recipients. The authors conclude that pulmonary retransplantation should only be performed in carefully selected recipients who have a reasonable likelihood of long-term survival.

# **AIRWAY COMPLICATIONS**

Improvements in surgical technique and posttransplant management have resulted in a relatively low incidence of airway complications after lung transplantation. Nevertheless, up to 27% of cases are complicated by stenosis, necrosis, or dehiscence. The avoidance of perioperative steroids has long been considered important in preventing airway complications. However, recent experimental and clinical evidence suggests that the detrimental effect of steroids may be overestimated. The most common airway complications are partial anastomotic dehiscence and stricture. Such complications are usually diagnosed by bronchoscopy. Airway dehiscence is treated by reoperation or close observation and supportive care. Strictures are treated by balloon or bougie dilatation, often with stent placement.

# **INFECTION**

Bacterial, viral, and fungal infections are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in lung transplantation. The rate

of infection is higher in this transplant group compared with other solid organ transplant recipients. This may be related to the lung allograft's direct exposure to airway colonization and aspiration, as well as its impaired cough reflex and mucociliary clearance. The risk of infection and infection-related death peaks in the first few months after transplantation, declining to a low persistent rate thereafter. Posttransplant infections can be classified broadly into those that occur early or late after transplantation. Early infections, occurring within the first month after transplantation, are commonly bacterial (especially Gram-negative bacilli) and manifest as pneumonia, mediastinitis, urinary tract infections, catheter sepsis, and skin infections. In the late posttransplant period, opportunistic viral, fungal, and protozoan pathogens become more prevalent. The lungs, central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and skin are the usual sites of invasion.

Bacterial infections, particularly caused by Gramnegative bacteria, predominate during the early postoperative period. Between 75 and 97% of bronchial washings obtained from donor lungs before organ retrieval culture at least one organism. Posttransplant invasive infections are frequently caused by organisms cultured from the donor. Conversely, bacterial infections developing in patients with septic lung disease, particularly CF, most commonly originate from the recipient's airways and sinuses. Treatment of bacterial infections generally involves characterization of the infective agent (eg, cultures, antibiotic sensitivities), source control (eg, catheter removal, debridement), and appropriate antibiotic regimens.

CMV infection occurs most often at 1 to 3 months after transplantation and presents either as a primary infection or reactivation of a latent infection. By definition, primary infection results when a previously seronegative recipient is infected through contact with tissue or blood from a sero-positive individual. The donor organ itself is thought to be the most common vector of primary CMV infections. Reactivation infection occurs when a recipient who is sero-positive prior to transplant develops clinical CMV infection during immunosuppressive therapy. Seropositive recipients are also subject to infection by new strains of CMV. Primary infection in previously seronegative recipients is generally more serious than reactivation or reinfection in seropositive patients.

Clinically, CMV infection has protean manifestations, including leukopenia with fever, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, and retinitis. CMV pneumonitis is the most lethal of these, with 13% mortality, and retinitis remains the most refractory to treatment. Diagnosis of CMV infection is made by direct culture of the virus from blood, urine, or tissue specimens, a fourfold increase in antibody titers from baseline, or characteristic histologic changes (ie, markedly enlarged cells and nuclei containing basophilic inclusion bodies). Most cases respond to ganciclovir and hyperimmune globulin.

CMV has been implicated as a trigger for OB69 as well as an inhibitor of cell-mediated immunity. CMV-negative

donors comprise less than 20% of the donor organ pool, and owing to organ scarcity, most transplant centers perform transplants across CMV serologic barriers using ganciclovir and/or hyperimmune globulin prophylactic protocols in CMV-positive donors and/ or recipients. A study by Valantine and coworkers found that the combined use of ganciclovir and hyperimmune globulin was superior to ganciclovir alone as prophylaxis against CMV. Moreover, the ganciclovir/hyperimmune globulin cohort had longer survival at 3 years and greater freedom from OB. 92

Invasive fungal infections peak in frequency between 10 days and 2 months after transplantation. Treatment consists of fluconazole, itraconazole, or amphotericin B. Reichenspurner and coworkers have reported that the actuarial incidence and linearized rate of fungal infections was significantly reduced in recipients who received inhaled amphotericin prophylaxis.<sup>93</sup>

The institution of prophylaxis with oral trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole (or inhalational pentamidine for sulfaallergic patients) has effectively prevented *P. carinii* pneumonia. The risk of *Pneumocystis* infection is highest during the first year after transplant. However, as infections can also occur late after transplant, most centers recommend prophylactic therapy be continued for life.

Infection prophylaxis is composed of vaccinations, perioperative broad-spectrum antibiotics, and long-term prophylactic antibiotics. Pretransplant inoculations with pneumococcal and hepatitis B vaccines, as well as DPT boosters, are recommended. All transplant recipients should receive annual influenza vaccinations. Although perioperative antibiotic regimens vary widely between transplant centers, first-generation cephalosporins (eg, cefazolin) or vancomycin are commonly used. Long-term prophylaxis typically includes nystatin mouthwash, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, aerosolized amphotericin B, and antivirals such as acyclovir or ganciclovir.

#### **NEOPLASM**

Transplant recipients have a higher incidence of neoplasia than that of the general population.<sup>94</sup> This is undoubtedly due to chronic immunosuppression. Recipients are predisposed to a variety of tumors, including skin cancer, B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, carcinoma of the vulva and anus, and Kaposi's sarcoma. On average, tumors appear approximately 5 years after transplantation.<sup>73</sup>

The incidence of B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders in transplant patients is a staggering 350 times greater than that of the normal age-matched population. Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) has been reported in 6% of lung transplant recipients. FTLD most commonly occurs within the first year after transplantation, and is associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection. Treatment consists of reducing immunosuppression and administration of an antiviral agent such as acyclovir or ganciclovir. A response rate of 30 to 40% can be expected, and recurrence is uncommon. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy have been

used successfully in some cases. During therapy, close monitoring of the graft, along with clinical assessment of tumor status is essential.

# Long-Term Results in Lung Transplantation

Pulmonary function measured by spirometry and arterial blood gases is markedly improved within several months after transplantation, with a normalization of ventilation and gas exchange after 1 to 2 years. 6 The long-term survival for lung transplant recipients reported to the Registry of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation is shown in Fig. 61-13. Survival rates among transplants performed between January 1994 and June 2012 were 88% at 3 months, 80% at 1 year, 65% at 3 years, 53% at 5 years, and 32% at 10 years.81 Survival for double lung transplant exceeds that of SLT, with the underlying indication being an important factor in the outcome between these two groups. Survival is clearly influenced by recipient age, with 1-year survival at 72% among patients older than 65 compared with 80% survival among patients less than 50.25 Patients with COPD and IPF (who often are older with more comorbidities) tend to fare poorer than those with CF, IPAH, sarcoidosis, and A1 anti-trypsin (AAT) deficiency emphysema (as shown in Fig. 61-14). In an analysis of 10-year survivors, double-lung recipients and patients with fewer hospitalizations for rejection were found to have improved long-term survival after lung transplantation.<sup>97,98</sup> Operative mortality is clearly affected by center volume, with high volume centers (≥20 implants per year) having a 30-day mortality rate of just 4.1%. 97 With increasing experience with lung transplantation worldwide, both short- and long-term survival have improved over time.

# **HEART-LUNG TRANSPLANTATION**History of Heart-Lung Transplantation

Long before the first successful human heart-lung transplants were reported, thoracic organ transplantation flourished in the laboratory. In the 1940s, Demikhov developed the first successful method of en bloc heart-lung transplantation in dogs. In his series of 67 dogs, the longest survivor lived for 6 days postoperatively.99 These remarkable studies demonstrated the technical feasibility of heart and lung replacement, yet remained largely unknown in the West until the 1960s. In 1953, Marcus and colleagues at the Chicago Medical School described a technique for heterotopic heart-lung grafting to the abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava in dogs. 100 Later studies in the 1960s and early 1970s examined the physiologic effect of total denervation on heart and lung function. Studies by Webb and colleagues in 1961 proved discouraging as they showed failure to resume normal spontaneous respiration following heart-lung replacement in dogs.<sup>101</sup> This physiologic phenomenon was confirmed by several other groups using canine models, including Lower and colleagues in 1961.<sup>102</sup>

Fortunately, later studies in primates by Haglin, <sup>103</sup> Nakae, <sup>104</sup> Castaneda, <sup>105,106</sup> and their colleagues showed that unlike dogs, primates resume a normal respiratory pattern after complete denervation with cardiopulmonary replacement. The 1970s saw the development of improved immunosuppressive

medications, particularly cyclosporine, which prevented rejection of primate heart-lung allografts after transplantation. Studies from the Stanford University showed survival for well over 5 years after heart-lung allografting in primates. <sup>107</sup> In the 1980s, Reitz and colleagues reported a modification

to the standard technique of heart-lung replacement, using a retained portion of the right atrium for a single inflow anastomosis instead of separate caval anastomoses. <sup>108</sup> This technique preserved the donor sinoatrial node and eliminated the potential for caval anastomotic stenosis. These studies laid the groundwork for a clinical trial of heart-lung transplantation at the Stanford University. On March 9, 1982, Reitz and colleagues performed the first successful human heart-lung transplant in a 45-year-old woman with end-stage primary pulmonary hypertension. <sup>109</sup>

# Indications for Heart-Lung Transplantation

Upon its introduction in 1982, heart-lung transplantation provided a life-saving therapeutic option for patients with end-stage pulmonary and cardiopulmonary disease. However, the number of heart-lung transplants performed peaked in 1990 as the techniques of SLT and DLT began to achieve improved outcomes in patients with isolated end-stage lung disease. This, combined with the donor shortage of heart-lung blocs, has restricted the procedure to patients with severe cardiopulmonary diseases (most commonly congenital heart disease with Eisenmenger's syndrome, idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, and CF). Since 2003, between 75 and 86 heart-lung transplant procedures have been performed worldwide each year.<sup>25</sup>

The diagnostic profile of heart-lung transplant recipients reported to the Registry of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) is shown in Table 61-8.

Reproduced with permission from Yusen RD, Edwards LB, Kucheryavaya AY, et al: The registry of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: thirty-first adult lung and heart-lung transplant report—2014, *J Heart Lung Transplant.* 2014 Oct;33(10):1009-1024.

Congenital heart disease (atrial and ventricular septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus) with secondary pulmonary hypertension (Eisenmenger's syndrome) is the most frequent indication, found in over one-third of the patients. Complex congenital heart defects that have been treated successfully with heart-lung transplantation include univentricular heart with pulmonary atresia, truncus arteriosus, and hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Data regarding the long-term survival benefit of heart-lung transplantation in patients with Eisenmenger's syndrome are mixed. 110 Some data suggest that pulmonary hypertension in these patients has a more favorable prognostic course than other types of pulmonary hypertension. There is clear evidence, however, that quality of life is improved by transplantation.<sup>111</sup> In patients with simpler cardiac defects, repair of the cardiac defect combined with SLT or bilateral lung transplantation is an alternative option.

Primary pulmonary hypertension with right-sided heart failure is the second most common diagnosis in heart-lung transplant recipients. Nearly one-fourths of patients in the ISHLT registry carry this diagnosis. Recently, there has been a shift toward SLT and bilateral lung transplantation in this population. 112 This new paradigm is based on the finding that normalization of pulmonary pressures following lung transplantation often allows for recovery of right heart function. However, in patients with severe right-sided heart failure and primary pulmonary hypertension, heart-lung transplantation is clearly the operation of choice.

The remainder of heart-lung transplants are performed for a variety of cardiac and pulmonary diseases. These include CF and other septic lung diseases, severe coronary artery disease (CAD) with concomitant end-stage lung disease, and primary parenchymal lung disease with severe right-sided heart failure (eg, IPF, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, sarcoidosis, and desquamative interstitial pneumonitis).

# Patient Selection for Heart-Lung

As in lung transplantation, patients are stratified according to LAS with similar listing criteria and contraindications for both groups of patients. Age restrictions tend to be somewhat more selective in most centers, with an upper recipient age limit of 50 years. Most recipients for heart-lung transplantation also fall within New York Heart Association functional classes III or IV.113 Careful attention to size matching must be carried out in the donor selection process. In a series of 82 heart-lung transplants at Papworth Hospital, Tamm and coworkers recorded recipient lung volumes posttransplantation, followed by a comparison to preoperative and predicted volumes to evaluate the influence of donor lung size and recipient underlying disease.114 The investigators demonstrated that, by 1 year after surgery, total lung capacity (TLC) and dynamic lung volume returned to values predicted by the patient's sex, age, and height. They proposed that the simplest method of matching donor lung size to that of the recipient is to use their respective predicted TLC values. Moreover, they concluded that recipients should attain their predicted lung volumes by 1 year posttransplantation, and failure to

do so suggests possible complications within the transplanted

As in lung transplantation, preoperative HLA matching is not feasible given the necessity of short ischemic times. However, histocompatibility does seem to impact on patient outcomes. Harjula and coworkers at Stanford evaluated the relationship between HLA matching and outcomes in heartlung transplantation.<sup>115</sup> Among 40 heart-lung transplant recipients evaluated, they found a significant increase in graded OB with total mismatch at the HLA-A locus.

# **Operative Technique**

#### PROCUREMENT

Exposure and cannulation for heart-lung blocs follows the same procedure as for lung procurement. After cross-clamp, the bloc is dissected free from the esophagus commencing at the level of the diaphragm and continuing cephalad to the level of the carina. Dissection is kept close to the esophagus, and care is taken to avoid injury to the trachea, lung, or great vessels. The posterior hilar attachments are divided. The lungs are inflated to a full normal tidal volume, and the trachea is stapled at the highest point possible with a TA-55 stapler (US Surgical, Norwalk, CT), at least four rings above the carina (Fig. 61-6E). The trachea is then divided above the staple line, and the entire heart-lung bloc is removed from the chest.

#### RECIPIENT IMPLANT

The recipient is positioned supine and the chest is entered through a median sternotomy. A sternal retractor is placed, and both pleural spaces are opened anteriorly from the level of the diaphragm to the level of the great vessels (Fig. 61-15A). Electrocautery is used to divide any pleural adhesions. The anterior pericardium is excised, and the lateral segments are preserved to support the heart and protect the phrenic nerves. A 3-cm border of the pericardium should be left both anterior and posterior to each phrenic nerve extending from the level of the diaphragm to the level of the great vessels (Fig. 61-15B). An alternative approach is to create posterior pericardial apertures where the pulmonary veins enter into the pericardium. A border of pericardium is left posterior to the phrenic nerves, whereas the entire remaining pericardium anterior to the phrenic nerves is left intact. After fully heparinizing the recipient, the ascending aorta is cannulated near the base of the innominate artery, and the venae cavae are individually cannulated laterally and snared. Cardiopulmonary bypass with systemic cooling to 28 to 30°C is instituted, and the heart is excised at the midatrial level. The aorta is divided just above the aortic valve, and the pulmonary artery is divided at its bifurcation (Fig. 61-15C). The left atrial remnant is then divided vertically at a point halfway between the right and left pulmonary veins.

The posterior edge of the left atrial and pulmonary venous remnant is developed in a manner allowing the left inferior and superior pulmonary veins to be displaced over into the left chest. Following division of the pulmonary ligament, the left lung is moved into the field, allowing full dissection of the posterior aspect of the left hilum, with care taken to avoid the vagus nerve posteriorly. Once this is completed, the left main pulmonary artery is divided (Fig. 61-15D), and the left main bronchus is stapled with a TA-30 stapler and divided. The same technique of hilar dissection and division is repeated on the right side (Fig. 61-15E), and both lungs are removed from the chest.

The native main pulmonary artery remnant is removed, leaving a portion of the pulmonary artery intact adjacent to the underside of the aorta (near the ligamentum arteriosus) to preserve the left recurrent laryngeal nerve. Attention is then turned to preparing the distal trachea for anastomosis. The stapled ends of the right and left bronchi are grasped and dissection is carried up to the level of the distal trachea. Bronchial vessels are individually identified and carefully ligated. Patients with congenital heart disease and pulmonary atresia or severe cyanosis secondary to Eisenmenger's syndrome may have large mediastinal bronchial collaterals that must be meticulously ligated. Perfect hemostasis is necessary in this area of the dissection, because it is obscured once graft implantation is complete. Once absolute hemostasis is achieved, the trachea is divided at the carina with a no. 15 blade. The chest is now prepared to receive the heart-lung graft.

The donor heart-lung bloc is removed from its transport container and prepared by irrigating, aspirating, and culturing the tracheobronchial tree followed by trimming of the trachea to leave one cartilaginous ring above the carina. The heart-lung graft is then lowered into the chest, passing the right lung beneath the right phrenic nerve pedicle. The left lung is then gently manipulated under the left phrenic nerve pedicle (Fig. 61-15F). The tracheal anastomosis is performed using continuous 3-0 polypropylene suture (Fig. 61-15G). The posterior membranous portion of the anastomosis is performed first, followed by completion of the anterior aspect. Ventilation is then carried out with room air at half-normal tidal volumes to inflate the lungs and reduce atelectasis. Topical cooling with a continuous infusion of cold Physiosol into both thoraces is begun. To augment endomyocardial cooling and to exclude air from the graft, a third cold, "bubble-free" line is placed directly into the left atrial appendage.

Next, the bicaval venous anastomosis is performed. The recipient inferior vena cava is anastomosed to the donor inferior vena cava-right atrial junction with a continuous 4-0 polypropylene suture. At this point, the patient is warmed toward 37°C, and the superior vena caval and aortic anastomoses are performed end-to-end with continuous 4-0 polypropylene sutures (Fig. 61-15H). After the ascending aorta and pulmonary artery are cleared of air, the aortic cross-clamp and caval tapes are removed. The left atrial catheter is removed, and the atrium is allowed to drain. The amputated left atrial stump is oversewn, and the pulmonary artery pulmonoplegia infusion site closed. The heart is defibrillated, and the patient is gradually weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass in the standard fashion. Methylprednisolone (500 mg) is administered to the recipient after heparin reversal with protamine sulfate.

PEEP at 3 to 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and an Fig. of 40% is maintained. As in cardiac transplantation, isoproterenol

 $(0.005\ to\ 0.01\ \mu g/kg/min)$  is usually initiated on graft reperfusion to increase the heart rate (~100-110 bpm) and to lower pulmonary vascular resistance. Temporary right atrial and ventricular pacing wires are placed. Right and left pleural "right angle" chest tubes are placed along each diaphragm, as well as a single mediastinal tube. The chest is closed in the standard fashion. Finally, the double lumen endotracheal tube is exchanged for a single lumen tube and the tracheal anastomosis is visualized by bronchoscopy before transporting the patient to the intensive care unit.

Lick and coworkers describe an interesting alternative to the standard technique in which the pulmonary hila are placed anterior to the phrenic nerves and direct caval anastomoses are used whenever feasible. This modification obviates extensive dissection of the phrenic nerves and posterior mediastinum, decreasing the likelihood of phrenic and vagus nerve injury. Furthermore, the posterior mediastinum can readily be inspected for bleeding after implantation by rotating the heart-lung bloc anterior-medially while still on bypass.

# **Graft Physiology**

For heart-lung recipients, denervation of the cardiac allograft leads to additional physiologic characteristics beyond what is seen in isolated lung transplantation. The denervated heart loses its sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic regulation, thereby impacting on heart rate, contractility, and coronary artery vasomotor tone. The resting heart rate is generally higher due to the absence of vagal input. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia and carotid reflex bradycardia are absent. Interestingly, the denervated heart develops an increased sensitivity to catecholamines because of increased beta-adrenergic receptor density and loss of norepinephrine uptake in postganglionic sympathetic neurons. 117,118 This augmented sensitivity plays an important role in maintaining an adequate cardiac response to exercise and stress. During exercise, the recipient experiences a steady but delayed increase in heart rate, primarily because of a rise in circulating catecholamines. This initial rise in heart rate is subsequently accompanied by an immediate increase in filling pressures resulting from increased venous return. These changes lead to increased stroke volume and cardiac output sufficient to sustain activity. Although the coronary circulation's ability to dilate to meet increased myocardial oxygen demand is not eliminated in an uncomplicated heart-lung transplant, this reserve is abnormal in the presence of rejection, hypertrophy, or regional wall abnormalities.

# Postoperative Management

Approximately 10 to 20% of heart-lung graft recipients experience some degree of transient sinus node dysfunction in the immediate perioperative period. This often manifests as sinus bradycardia and usually resolves within a week. The use of bicaval venous anastomoses has been reported to lower the incidence of sinus node dysfunction and improve tricuspid valve function. 119 Because cardiac output is primarily rate dependent after heart-lung transplantation, the heart rate should be maintained between 90 and 110 beats per minute during the first few postoperative days using temporary pacing or isoproterenol (0.005-0.01 µg/kg/min) as needed. Although rarely seen, persistent sinus node dysfunction and bradycardia may require a permanent transvenous pacemaker. Systolic blood pressure should be maintained between 90 and 110 mm Hg using nitroglycerin or nitroprusside for afterload reduction, if necessary. "Renal-dose" dopamine (3-5 µg/kg/min) is used frequently to augment renal blood flow and urine output. The adequacy of cardiac output is indicated by warm extremities and a urine output greater than 0.5 mL/kg/h without diuretics. Cardiac function generally returns to normal within 3 to 4 days, at which time inotropes and vasodilators can be weaned.

Nevertheless, depressed global myocardial performance is occasionally seen during the acute postoperative setting. The myocardium may be subject to prolonged ischemia, inadequate preservation, or catecholamine depletion before implantation. Hypovolemia, cardiac tamponade, sepsis,

and bradycardia are also potential contributors and should be treated expeditiously if they are present. A Swan-Ganz pulmonary artery catheter should be used in cases of persistently abnormal hemodynamics. Surveillance endomyocardial biopsies are performed at 3 months and then annually in heart-lung graft recipients.

# Complications

The most common complications after heart-lung transplantation include hypertension (88.6%), renal dysfunction (28.1%), hyperlipidemia (66.4%), diabetes (20.9%), coronary artery vasculopathy (8.2%), and bronchiolitis obliterans (27.1%).25 Common causes of death include graft failure and technical complications within the first 30 days, followed by non-CMV infections and BOS in the longer term.<sup>25</sup> Acute rejection remains a challenge, occurring in more than 67% of heart-lung patients within the first year between 1981 and 1994 at Stanford University. 120 Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that pulmonary and cardiac rejections occur independently of one other. Nevertheless, Higenbottam and coworkers at Papworth Hospital reported a surprisingly low diagnostic yield from routine endomyocardial biopsies in heart-lung recipients compared with functional or histologic tests of pulmonary rejection. Based on these findings, the authors concluded that transbronchial biopsy eliminates the need for routine endomyocardial biopsies in heart-lung transplant recipients.<sup>121</sup> These findings were supported by Sibley and coworkers at Stanford University, who demonstrated discordance between findings on endomyocardial and transbronchial biopsies during episodes of acute rejection. Endomyocardial biopsies are most often normal despite findings of pulmonary rejection on transbronchial biopsy. 76 In our practice, surveillance endomyocardial biopsies have been abandoned in patients in whom transbronchial biopsies can be reliably performed. Respiratory failure secondary OB represents a long-term complication of heart-lung transplant at a rate similar to DLT. Among heart-lung recipients with OB, Adams and coworkers at Harefield Hospital noted that retransplant survival rates were worse for those undergoing combined heartlung replacement compared with patients who underwent isolated lung replacement. 122 The group also noted the following factors were associated with improved survival after retransplant: absence of preformed antibodies, retransplantation at least 18 months after the original transplantation, and negative preoperative sputum cultures.

Accelerated graft CAD or graft atherosclerosis is another major obstacle to long-term survival in heart-lung transplant recipients. Significant graft CAD resulting in diminished coronary artery blood flow may lead to arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, sudden death, or impaired left ventricular function with congestive heart failure. Classic angina caused by myocardial ischemia is usually not noted in transplant recipients because the cardiac graft is not innervated. Multiple etiologies for graft CAD have been proposed, all focusing on chronic, immune-mediated damage to the coronary vascular

![](_page_26_Picture_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 61-16** Cardiac graft atherosclerosis. Complete luminal obliteration by a concentric fibrointimal proliferation was observed at postmortem in this heart-lung transplant patient (Elastin von Gieson stain; ×60).

endothelium. In fact, elevated levels of antiendothelial antibodies have been correlated with graft CAD. Unlike coronary artery occlusive disease in the native heart, which tends to be a more focal process, transplant atherosclerosis is a more diffuse vascular narrowing extending symmetrically into distal branches. Histologically, transplant arteriopathy is characterized by concentric intimal proliferation with smooth muscle hyperplasia (Fig. 61-16).

Coronary angiograms are performed on a yearly basis to identify recipients with accelerated CAD. Angiography is limited, however, to assessment of luminal diameter. Intracoronary ultrasound, by contrast, can assess both

vascular wall morphology and luminal diameter, making it a more sensitive tool to detect the diffuse coronary intimal thickening typical of graft atherosclerosis. Interestingly, graft CAD occurs at a reduced incidence in heart-lung recipients compared with the cardiac transplantation population. 123 A retrospective survey at Stanford revealed 89% of heartlung recipients were free from graft CAD at 5 years, compared with 73% of heart transplant recipients. Clinically observed risk factors for developing this condition in heart transplant recipients include donor age greater than 35 years, incompatibility at the HLA-A1, A2, and DR loci, hypertriglyceridemia (serum concentration greater than 280 mg/dL), frequent acute rejection episodes, and documented recipient CMV infection. It is not clear whether these risk factors can be extended to the heart-lung transplant population, although CMV infection has been implicated. 124 Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and coronary artery bypass grafting have been used to treat discrete proximal lesions in some cases of graft CAD. However, the only definitive therapy for diffuse graft CAD is retransplantation. Effective prevention of graft CAD will rely on development of improved immunosuppression, recipient tolerance induction, improved CMV prophylaxis, and inhibition of vascular intimal proliferation.

Infection represents another significant postoperative challenge in heart-lung transplantation. Between 1981 and 1994 at Stanford, only 20% of heart-lung transplant recipients were free from infection 3 months after transplantation. In a retrospective analysis of 200 episodes of serious infections occurring in 73 heart-lung recipients at Stanford between 1981 and 1990, Kramer and coworkers<sup>125</sup> found that half of all infections were caused by bacteria, whereas fungal infections accounted for only 14% of total infections. The most common viral agent was CMV, occurring primarily in the second month after transplantation and comprising 15% of

all viral infections. Other viral infections (ie, herpes simplex, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus) were less common. Five percent of infections were attributed to *P. carinii*, typically occurring 4 to 6 months after transplantation, and 2% were caused by *Nocardia*, generally appearing after the first year. There was no significant difference in the incidence of infections between patients receiving triple-drug or doubledrug (cyclosporine and prednisone) immunosuppression. Infectious mortality comprised 40% of all deaths.

# Long-Term Results in Heart-Lung Transplantation

Survival rates of 72% at 3 months and 64% at 1 year have been reported in the ISHLT registry. <sup>25</sup> Mortality rates taper off significantly at a year posttransplant, as illustrated in Fig. 61-17. As with lung transplantation, outcomes have improved over time and are affected by recipient diagnosis. <sup>25</sup> Graft failure, technical complications, and non-CMV infections are all common causes of 30-day mortality, with BO and non-CMV infections impairing long-term survival.
