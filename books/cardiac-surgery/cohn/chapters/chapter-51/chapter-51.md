## Trauma to the Great Vessels

Tom P. Theruvath • Claudio J. Schonholz • John S. Ikonomidis

Injury to the aorta and great vessels of the thorax may occur secondary to penetrating or blunt trauma. The management strategy involves control of immediate hemorrhage with prevention of distal malperfusion or pseudoaneurysm development and rupture. Blunt thoracic aortic injury (BTAI) is the most common thoracic vascular injury and is the second leading cause of death in the United States from nonpenetrating trauma. Its incidence is estimated at 7500 to 8000 cases per year.1 In 75 to 90% of cases, death occurs at the accident scene, typically in those with four or more serious injuries in addition to their aortic transection.2 Current data suggest that approximately 4% of patients die during transport from the scene, and an additional 19% die during the initial trauma evaluation.3 A meta-analysis in 2011 reported that inhospital mortality of patients managed nonoperatively was as high as 46%, whereas mortality was 9% in patients treated by endovascular repair and 19% for open repair.<sup>4</sup> After aortic transection at the isthmus, aortic disruption at the base of the innominate artery is the most common site of injury, followed by the base of the left subclavian artery, and the base of the left carotid. Central venous structures are rarely injured with blunt trauma, but this can occur with penetrating trauma.<sup>5</sup> Traditionally, open surgical repair of these injuries has proved effective. Since the first endovascular thoracic aortic device became commercially available in the United States in 2005, the treatment of BTAI has rapidly evolved as high-volume trauma centers applied the principles of endovascular aneurysm repair to BTAI in an off-label manner. With the growing shift from open repair to thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) as the primary treatment in patients with BTAI, outcomes have improved with significantly reduced mortality and morbidity, including procedure-related paraplegia.<sup>6</sup> This chapter describes the traumatic injuries to the thoracic aorta and its brachiocephalic branch vessels. The mechanism, clinical presentation, and treatment strategies are presented. The emphasis is directed to endovascular strategies which have emerged as the most commonly utilized intervention in blunt aortic and brachiocephalic branch vessel trauma.

The chapter is divided into the ascending, arch, and descending zones and both open surgical and endovascular approaches are described with regard to the specific zones.

## GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

## Zonal Divisions of the Thoracic Aorta

In order to facilitate international correspondence and a clinically more useful system with regard to anatomical identification of the thoracic aorta, an "anatomical endograft landing zone map" was advocated at the First International Summit on Thoracic Aortic Endografting held in Tokyo in 2001.<sup>7</sup> We suggest using this landing zone map to classify not only the proximal deployment site of an endograft but also extent of open surgical repairs. In 2002, this landing zone map was expanded to include the position of the distal end of the endograft. Since then, the map (Fig. 51-1) has achieved consensus as the standardized anatomical definition to evaluate outcomes.<sup>8</sup> On a more personal notation, we refer to the aortic root as the "double-0" site.

## Clinical Presentation

Patients presenting to the emergency department with injury to a great vessel should be evaluated according to standard advanced trauma life support (ATLS) protocols. Those suffering blunt trauma are often hemodynamically stable; therefore, a high index of suspicion for intrathoracic vascular disruption must be based on the mechanism and constellation of related injuries. In addition to high-speed collisions involving automobiles or motorcycles, crush injuries and falls often have sufficient force to rupture a thoracic vessel. 9-12 There are often clues evident in the initial evaluation of a trauma patient that can suggest aortic disruption. In contrast to blunt injury to the arch vessels, patients sustaining descending thoracic aortic rupture are often hemodynamically stable on presentation at the emergency department. Although patients may complain

of dyspnea or back pain and display differential blood pressures in the upper versus lower extremities, specific signs or symptoms of aortic rupture have been identified in less than 50% of cases. Complete de-gloving injury may result in intussusception of the aortic media into the descending thoracic aorta, with resultant "pseudocoarctation" and subsequently variable degrees of distal malperfusion (Fig. 51-2). Commonly associated complaints include neck and chest pain, and physical examination may reveal ecchymosis across the chest and neck from the seatbelt shoulder harness. <sup>13,14</sup>

Physical examination findings concerning for rupture of a great vessel include supraclavicular swelling or bruit, diminished pulse in the ipsilateral upper extremity, neck hematoma with or without tracheal deviation, acute Horner's syndrome, and an acute superior vena cava-like syndrome. 11,14-16 In a stable patient with evidence of a stab or gunshot wound located between the mid clavicular lines or in zone I of the neck, great vessel penetration should be suspected.<sup>17</sup> A precordial bruit suggesting arteriovenous fistula (AVF) formation may be noted in up to 30% of patients. 18 Penetrating distal subclavian injuries may demonstrate pulsatile bleeding during initial evaluation.<sup>19</sup> More commonly, patients suffering penetrating injury to the chest or neck will be hemodynamically unstable on arrival to the emergency department, possibly with evidence of cardiac tamponade, and those in extremis should undergo emergent thoracotomy. Hypotensive patients may proceed directly to the operating room without diagnostic imaging; the mortality of patients presenting with hypotension is nearly three times greater than that of stable patients. 18,19 Therefore, an organized, efficient, and effective evaluation of these patients is necessary to prevent unnecessary loss of life.

## Classification System for Traumatic Aortic Injury

The classification scheme for grading the severity of BTAI has been widely accepted and is shown in Fig. 51-3.<sup>20</sup> Grade I demonstrates an intimal tear or flap. Grade II demonstrates an intramural hematoma without significant change in the external contour of the aorta. Grade III demonstrates a contained pseudoaneurysm with extension beyond the normal contours of the aorta. Grade IV involves full-thickness aortic injury with extravasation. The Society of

**FIGURE 51-3** Classification system for blunt thoracic aortic injury (BTAI). The different grades of BTAI are shown: Grade I—intimal tear/flap, Grade II—intramural hematoma, Grade III—pseudoaneurysm, Grade IV—rupture.

Vascular Surgery guidelines recommend TEVAR for grade II through IV BTAIs, given that grade I injuries typically heal spontaneously.

## Initial Evaluation

A multitrauma patient should be evaluated according to standard ATLS protocols regardless of whether aortic disruption is suspected. The primary and secondary survey, routine radiographs, and hemodynamic stabilization must be completed before the team can begin investigating specific injuries. The first step in diagnosing a blunt traumatic aortic injury is identifying the at-risk patient. Motor vehicle collisions, falls from height, explosions, and crush injuries have the impact and deceleration forces required to cause aortic transection; therefore these patients should undergo imaging directed at ruling out this potentially fatal injury. 21-24 Operative management of intracranial space-occupying lesions and intra-abdominal hemorrhage takes priority over nonbleeding aortic injuries. Hemodynamically unstable patients with signs of exsanguinating hemorrhage should go directly to the operating room for control of hemorrhage, and transesophageal ultrasound may be used to evaluate for aortic injury. Ninety-five percent of patients with aortic disruption have associated injuries. Data accrued from a trial which included approximately 50 trauma centers across the United States and Canada, the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma

There are often clues evident in the initial evaluation in these patients that can suggest aortic disruption (Table 51-1).

#### **CHEST X-RAY**

In the majority of trauma patients, a supine chest radiograph is obtained as part of the initial evaluation, and the constellation of grossly widened mediastinum, hemothorax, and transient hemodynamic instability on arrival appear to be predictive of early in-hospital death from BTAI.<sup>26</sup> During the evaluation of a blunt trauma patient, an anteroposterior chest radiograph is routinely obtained and ought to be examined for one of the 15 signs that have been associated with aortic rupture (Table 51-2).<sup>27</sup> Widening of the mediastinum to a width exceeding 25% of the total chest width, obliteration of the aortic knob, apical pleural capping, and fractures of the sternum, scapula, clavicle, or first rib are some of the most common findings (Fig. 51-4). None of these signs have demonstrated sufficient sensitivity or specificity to effectively rule out aortic injury, however, and up to 40% of patients with aortic rupture have had chest x-ray findings interpreted as normal.<sup>22,23,28-32</sup> When abnormalities are identified, however, they can aid the practitioner in determining which patients require aggressive imaging to definitively rule out an aortic injury.

#### COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY

In the typical hemodynamically stable blunt trauma patient, head and abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) should be conducted to identify closed-head or intra-abdominal injury. Those with an abnormal chest x-ray or a traumatic mechanism consistent with aortic injury should undergo helical CT scan of the chest with intravenous contrast at this time. Since its introduction in the early 1990s, CT has become the screening tool of choice at most medical institutions to detect traumatic aortic rupture due to its availability, speed, and ease of interpretation. Additionally, sensitivities and negative predictive values nearing 100% have

been reported for volumetric helical or spiral CT.<sup>22,23,32-35</sup> Normal aorta portrays homogeneous enhancement, while filling defects, contrast extravasation, intimal flaps, periaortic hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, and mural thrombi may suggest the presence of an aortic injury (Fig. 51-5).<sup>34</sup> Moreover, the enhanced resolution of CT imaging has allowed identification of minimal aortic injuries, such as small intimal flaps with minimal or no mediastinal changes, that may be safely managed with anti-impulse therapy.<sup>23,34,36</sup>

## TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has become a valuable tool in cardiothoracic surgery due to its ability to image the entire descending thoracic aorta along with portions of the ascending aorta arch and its portability. In unstable blunt trauma patients requiring laparotomy, TEE can be utilized to evaluate the descending aorta for evidence of rupture, such as a mural flap or a thickened vessel wall concerning for mural thrombus. Multiplanar TEE probes permit acquisition of cross-sectional images at different angles along a single rotational axis. The typical 5- or 7-MHz transducer permits adequate resolution of structures as small as 1 to 2 mm. Doppler mapping of turbulent blood flow near a vessel wall abnormality may be suggestive of blunt aortic disruption, and time-resolved imaging allows evaluation of the movement of anatomic structures, thereby enhancing the ability to define the physiologic consequences of such abnormalities. Chronic atheromatous disease of the aorta can complicate obtaining and interpreting TEE images; therefore observation of multiple-related signs of injury, such as mural flap with a surrounding mediastinal hematoma, is more reliable. A disadvantage of TEE, and potential inhibitor to its widespread use as a screening tool for aortic injury, is its operator-dependent nature with sensitivities as low as 63% documented for this modality.<sup>37</sup> A prospective comparison of imaging techniques

for diagnosis of blunt aortic trauma reported, however, sensitivity and specificity of 93 and 100% for TEE compared to 73 and 100% for helical CT.<sup>35</sup> Thoracoscopy has also been used to evaluate traumatic hemothoraces, however with experienced practitioners intraoperative TEE has superb sensitivity and specificity for aortic transection.<sup>38,39</sup> TEE is more invasive than helical CT, but overall the associated risk is low. Contraindications include concomitant injury to the cervical spine, oropharynx, esophagus, or maxillofacial structures.<sup>35</sup>

## MAGNETIC RESONANCE ANGIOGRAPHY

Vascular structures are well imaged by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), particularly the thoracic aorta, and its utility in the diagnosis and follow-up of complex aortic disease including aortic dissections and aneurysms is firmly established. The time required to capture images inhibits the utility of MRA in the acute evaluation of a trauma patient, however it may be effective in posttherapeutic surveillance of traumatic thoracic injuries.

### **AORTOGRAPHY**

Aortography may be useful when helical CT or TEE fail to definitively identify or adequately characterize an aortic injury. The role of aortography in evaluating blunt thoracic injuries was firmly established prior to the advent of noninvasive, sophisticated imaging techniques, and it may still be considered the gold standard. In experienced hands its sensitivity and specificity both approach 100%. Intra-arterial digital subtraction is most often used because it allows rapid generation of images (Fig. 51-6). In the past, intravenous digital subtraction was used as well. After injecting intravenous

contrast, time-delayed images of the arch and descending aorta were obtained, and although this technique greatly decreased the duration of the procedure, it was abandoned because the diagnostic accuracy for aortic disruption was less than 70%. 40 With the availability and speed of helical CT, aortography is now rarely used for diagnosis, but routinely utilized for endovascular stent graft placement. This intervention requires a highly trained team of endovascular specialists and can be time-consuming; therefore trauma patients with additional life or limb threatening injuries should be otherwise stabilized before entering the endovascular suite. Rates of exsanguination and death of up to 10% have previously been reported during diagnostic aortography, but this incidence has decreased significantly as endovascular proficiency has improved. 40,44,45 In fact, complication rates attributed directly to aortography are low, but patients may suffer contrast reactions, contrast nephropathy, groin hematomas, or femoral artery pseudoaneurysms. False-positive studies are usually attributed to atheromata or ductal diverticula.

## Decision to Repair Versus Expectant Management

Uniformly, hemodynamically unstable blunt trauma patients should bypass diagnostic imaging and be taken to the operating room immediately. During a damage control exploratory laparotomy or thoracotomy, TEE may be conducted to diagnose contained aortic rupture.<sup>35</sup> Operative repair of the aorta should not be attempted at this time, however, as this group of patients benefit from immediate transfer to the intensive care unit for further resuscitation. Once hemodynamic stability is achieved, anti-impulse therapy with beta-blockade should be initiated to minimize aortic wall stress. Hemodynamically stable patients diagnosed with blunt aortic injury, and lacking severe associated injuries requiring interventions, warrant immediate repair. Treatment of all nonlife-threatening injuries should be delayed until after definitive aortic repair. As such, delayed management has demonstrated to be safe and effective in carefully selected patients with severe associated injuries or comorbidities. 46-57 Patients with thoracic, intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal hemorrhage, or intracranial bleeding that cause mass effect should be managed with aggressive anti-impulse therapy to minimize the risk of aortic rupture while these injuries are addressed.<sup>55</sup> The goal of anti-impulse therapy should be to maintain a systolic blood pressure less than 120 mm Hg and/or a mean arterial pressure less than 80 mm Hg.<sup>23</sup> The aortic insult should also be monitored by TEE during surgical repair of concomitant injuries, and routinely imaged with CT during the delayed management period. The mortality rate of patients awaiting aortic repair has ranged from 30 to 50%, but the majority of deaths have not been related to the aortic injury. 49,50,55 In the AAST trial, those presenting in extremis or with evidence of free aortic rupture were excluded, and the mortality rate of patients with associated injuries that precluded initial aortic repair was 55%.<sup>25</sup> Therefore, evidence supports operative delay or even nonoperative management in select patients with blunt aortic injury who may be considered poor operative candidates. Even in carefully selected patient with BTAIs deliberate nonoperative management has been shown to be a reasonable alternative in the polytrauma patient. Anti-impulse therapy with beta-blockers should be initiated in patients proceeding directly to the operating room for aortic repair, as well as in those selected for delayed repair, to reduce blood pressure and thereby reduce aortic wall stress. In-hospital aortic rupture rates have been reduced through aggressive beta-blockade without adversely affecting the outcome of associated injuries.

## THE ASCENDING AORTA

## Mechanism of Injury

Descending thoracic aortic transection is the most common vascular injury resulting from blunt thoracic force. The ascending aorta and arch vessels, however, may also be disrupted, commonly leading to dissection or pseudoaneurysm formation. Mechanistically, the transmission of force through the thoracic cavity from blunt injury is believed to cause torsion of the ascending aorta, leading to disruption of the wall with an associated shearing effect on the heart. Additionally, a water-hammer effect is described in which an aortic occlusion at the diaphragm occurs with impact and a high pressure wave is reflected back to the ascending aorta and aortic arch.

## **Operative Repair**

Pseudoaneurysm of the ascending aorta should be repaired using cardiopulmonary bypass. Femorofemoral or axillofemoral cannulation and commencement of cardiopulmonary bypass before sternotomy may decompress the ascending aorta and decrease the risk of pseudoaneurysm rupture on opening the chest.<sup>16</sup> After entering the pericardium, the pseudoaneurysm should be carefully mobilized, if possible, to gain proximal and distal control. Depending on the nature and extent of the injury, repair may be conducted by primary repair, patch angioplasty, or prosthetic replacement of aortic segment. If aortic valve insufficiency is encountered, prosthetic valve replacement may be warranted.<sup>62</sup> Occasionally, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest is required, especially if proximal and distal control cannot be comfortably obtained or the pseudoaneurysm extends into the proximal aortic arch. This will allow for excision of the pseudoaneurysm and closure of the aortic defect with a prosthetic patch.60 As with descending thoracic aortic injuries, a delay in operative management may be considered in hemodynamically stable patients with associated injuries at high risk for bleeding, especially intracranial lesions.<sup>60</sup> The application of this delayed approach depends on the nature of the ascending aortic injury. For instance, it must be a discrete lesion without evidence of circumferential involvement or compromised adjacent structures. Safe observation entails maintaining a mean arterial pressure less than 80 mm Hg and cerebral perfusion pressure greater than 50 mm Hg, typically through short-acting intravenous beta-blockade. Conservative management must be accompanied by regular assessment of the aortic lesion through serial CT scans of the thorax and a low threshold for operative intervention if enlargement of the pseudoaneurysm is identified. 63

## **Endovascular Interventions**

Several studies have reported safety and effectiveness of TEVAR of the descending aorta, but the role of TEVAR for treating ascending aortic pathology is less well known. Especially the role of ascending TEVAR (or A-TEVAR) in the setting of trauma has not been evaluated and reported to date. Only a small number of studies have described outcomes with this approach. 64-66 The reported experience demonstrates that endovascular repair of the ascending aorta is technically feasible in settings of chronic aneurysms or acute aortic dissections and can be accomplished with promising early results. Currently there are no commercially available endovascular devices specifically designed to treat the ascending aorta. Compared with TEVAR of the descending thoracic aorta, endovascular therapy for the ascending aorta is challenged by more complex pathology, hemodynamic characteristics, and anatomy. As such, the proximity of the aortic valve and coronary arteries to the ascending aorta makes it particularly challenging to obtain seal and fixation within the proximal landing zone. Thus far the only intervention is the open surgical approach via median sternotomy and cardiopulmonary bypass as described in the previous section.

# THE AORTIC ARCH BRANCH VESSELS Mechanism of Injury

The pathogenesis of blunt innominate artery rupture has been postulated to be the result of anteroposterior compression of the mediastinum between the sternum and vertebrae, displacing the heart posteriorly and to the left, thereby increasing the curvature of the aortic arch and increasing tension on all of its outflow vessels.<sup>67</sup> Hyperextension of the cervical spine with head rotation provides additional tension on the right carotid artery, which is transmitted to the innominate artery, and can lead to rupture.<sup>67</sup> The left carotid artery undergoes stretching injury with rapid deceleration, producing an intimal tear and subsequent dissection.<sup>11</sup> Additional mechanisms of carotid artery injury include hyperflexion of the neck to cause compression between the mandible and cervical spine, basilar skull fracture transecting the artery, and strangulation injury.11 Blunt subclavian artery injuries are more common in the middle and distal third of the artery and are theorized to be caused by downward forces fracturing the first rib with the anterior scalene acting as a fulcrum so that the subclavian artery is pinched between the first rib and clavicle.9 The abrupt deceleration of the shoulder, owing to the seatbelt shoulder harness, is also believed to cause subclavian artery shearing injuries.9

## **Operative Repair**

#### INNOMINATE ARTERY

The innominate artery is the second most common site of thoracic vascular injury following blunt trauma. In a review of 117 reported cases of blunt innominate artery rupture, 83% were in the proximal vessel, 3% were in the middle, 9% were distal, and the remaining injuries involved multiple sections.<sup>10</sup> The most common finding was disruption of the intima and media with pseudoaneurysm formation (Fig. 51-7).<sup>10</sup> Although primary repair may be possible in some cases, surgical repair of an innominate artery rupture has traditionally been performed by a prosthetic aorto-innominate bypass graft from the aortic arch to healthy distal vessels through a full or upper median sternotomy with extension of the incision along the anterior border of the right sternocleidomastoid as necessary. 17,68 Operative repair of a penetrating innominate artery injury is approached in the same manner.<sup>17</sup> The entire length of the innominate artery should be mobilized to achieve distal control and the pericardium opened to gain proximal control at the level of the aortic arch.<sup>69</sup> After systemic administration of heparin, a partial occlusion clamp is applied to the aortic arch and the proximal anastomosis of the prosthetic graft performed end-to-side with polypropylene suture.<sup>69</sup> Depending on the location and extent of the injury, the distal end-to-end anastomosis may involve only the innominate artery or a Y-graft may be required to reconstruct the proximal portions of the right carotid and right subclavian arteries individually. 10 The origin of the innominate artery should then be fully exposed and oversewn with pledgeted nonabsorbable sutures.<sup>69</sup> Healthy patients typically tolerate temporary

innominate artery occlusion caused by adequate collateral flow through the contralateral carotid and vertebral arteries.<sup>69</sup> Cerebral protection, cardiopulmonary bypass, electroencephalogram monitoring, hypothermia with circulatory arrest, or carotid shunting (for stump pressure < 50 mm Hg) should be employed in patients with neurologic abnormalities or suspicion of a contralateral carotid artery injury.<sup>68,69</sup> Long-term patency of prosthetic aorto-innominate artery bypass grafts has been reported to be greater than 96% at 10 years.<sup>70</sup>

#### **CAROTID ARTERY**

Therapeutic management of blunt carotid artery injury must be directed at preventing cerebral ischemia and surgical intervention should be weighed against observation and anticoagulation.<sup>71</sup> Small intimal flaps may resolve, whereas larger flaps can lead to thrombosis and therefore require anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolism.<sup>72</sup> Arterial dissection may progress to luminal narrowing, placing the patient at risk for thrombosis, and anticoagulation therapy is especially important in patients with bilateral carotid artery dissection owing to the morbidity and mortality associated with bilateral thrombosis.<sup>73</sup> When operative intervention is indicated because of pseudoaneurysm formation (Fig. 51-8), the surgeon may bypass the lesion, but reconstruction or ligation of the artery can also be employed.<sup>11</sup> Open repair of an intrathoracic carotid artery injury should occur through a median sternotomy with extension along the anterior border of the ipsilateral sternocleidomastoid muscle as necessary to gain adequate exposure.18 After gaining proximal and distal control, arterial repair may be accomplished by primary repair or interposition grafting with saphenous vein or prosthetic material.<sup>18</sup>

## SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY

Injury to the subclavian artery, from blunt or penetrating trauma, carries a mortality rate of 5 to 30% resulting from the inability to obtain adequate hemorrhagic control through direct pressure. 74,75 Additionally, because of the close proximity of the trachea, esophagus, subclavian vein, and brachial plexus, subclavian artery injuries are associated with 40% morbidity.<sup>74</sup> Operative exposure may be achieved by median sternotomy, limited sternotomy, supraclavicular incision, infraclavicular incision, thoracotomy, or a combination of these depending on the location of the injury.<sup>76</sup> Left-sided lesions are often managed through an anterolateral thoracotomy with either an infraclavicular or supraclavicular counter incision; however, some surgeons perform a median sternotomy for a proximal injury. 9,76 Right-sided injuries, on the other hand, require median sternotomy with supraclavicular extension.9 In cases in which the defect involves a long segment of the subclavian artery, a portion of the clavicle may be resected to optimize exposure, although this procedure carries considerable postoperative morbidity. 19,76 Once establishing proximal and distal control of the subclavian artery, the damaged arterial segment may be excised and arterial reconstruction accomplished with an interposition graft using a saphenous vein or prosthetic material.9 In cases in which minimal arterial debridement is required, primary repair is often attained.<sup>77</sup> Ligation of the subclavian artery may be performed on critically ill patients unable to tolerate an extensive operative repair, and minimal short-term morbidity in the affected limb has been reported. 19,76,77 When planning operative repair of the subclavian artery, concomitant injuries to nearby structures such as the subclavian vein and brachial plexus should be considered.

## **Endovascular Interventions**

Arteriography is considered the gold standard for diagnosis and characterization of an intrathoracic vascular injury, and as endovascular stent technology and surgeon proficiency continue to advance, arteriography may become the preferred method of treatment in hemodynamically stable patients. The literature is currently populated with small case series and case reports documenting the feasibility of this approach and minimal short-term morbidity and mortality, but very little longterm data exist. Similar to other minimally invasive techniques, endovascular management of a traumatic injury to an intrathoracic vessel can provide an opportunity for patients to avoid sternotomy or thoracotomy and the associated pain, prolonged recovery time, and infection risk. 78,79 An analysis of endovascular versus open procedures in the National Trauma Database revealed a survival advantage for endovascular repair when controlling for injury severity score, associated injuries, and age.80 Widespread application of endovascular techniques to manage great vessel trauma in hemodynamically stable patients is constrained by lesion anatomy. With regard to accessing the injury, the relationship of the vascular defect to the aortic arch is rarely an issue because brachial and carotid artery approaches, with or without a concomitant femoral approach, are increasingly

employed.<sup>79</sup> However, the likelihood that the adjacent healthy vessel segments will provide adequate landing zones and the preservation of branch vessels are important considerations.81 Therefore, critical assessment of each individual lesion is required to assure appropriate use of this technology. Common endovascular modalities such as bare-metal or covered stents (stent grafts) and coil embolization have been employed in vascular trauma. Stent grafts were not commercially available before 2000; therefore, case reports published in that timeframe described use of home-made devices in which the surgeon affixed autologous tissue, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), or polyester to a bare-metal stent and then repackaged the device for endovascular deployment across an AVF or pseudoaneurysm.82 There are currently a number of self-expandable and balloon-expandable stent grafts approved for coronary or peripheral vascular interventions that have been successfully used in the aortic arch vessels, specifically the wallstent endoprosthesis (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA), the Gore Viabahn endoprosthesis (W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ), and the Jostent stent-graft coronary or peripheral (Abbott Vascular, Redwood City, CA).83

#### INNOMINATE ARTERY

Stable patients who have suffered either a blunt or penetrating injury to the innominate artery have benefited from endovascular repair with a stent graft, without reported complications. 13,78,84-86 One technical consideration when approaching an innominate artery pseudoaneurysm is whether the distal landing zone of the stent graft will occlude the carotid artery. This situation can potentially be avoided by realignment of the guidewire such that the orifice of the subclavian artery is covered instead, a lesion that is typically asymptomatic owing to the extensive collateralization of the upper extremity around the shoulder.<sup>78,87</sup> Alternatively, if the stent graft must traverse the origin of the right common carotid, a subclavian-carotid bypass may be performed before deployment.<sup>78</sup> Appropriate follow-up for these endovascular repairs has yet to be defined, but biannual duplex ultrasound examinations or CT scans have been proposed. The duration of antiplatelet therapy after stent graft deployment is also unclear; however, the majority of patients are discharged from the hospital on daily aspirin therapy with or without Plavix (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ).13,88,89

### **CAROTID ARTERY**

Trauma to the intrathoracic carotid artery is rare, but cases of successful stent-graft exclusion of pseudoaneurysms have been reported. 90-96 Embolic risk should be considered when assessing whether the lesion is suitable for endovascular intervention, and many surgeons advocate for delayed stenting of carotid injuries to minimize arterial manipulation and the potential embolic sequelae. 97 Safely anticoagulating the trauma patient with concomitant intracranial or solid organ injuries can be difficult, but maintaining a partial thromboplastic time between 40 and 50 seconds has been shown to effectively cover carotid

artery injuries without significantly increasing the bleeding risk.<sup>73</sup> Full heparinization is vital during the stent-graft deployment procedure, however, and should be followed by antiplatelet therapy with Plavix for at least 2 weeks with subsequent conversion to lifelong aspirin therapy.<sup>91</sup> Although patients should be monitored for alterations in neurologic function as a marker of stent stenosis or occlusion, serial duplex ultrasounds ought to be employed to identify subclinical luminal narrowing.<sup>97</sup>

#### SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY

Endovascular repair of subclavian artery injuries has been relatively well described in the literature because of the obvious benefits of this procedure compared with the morbidity of open subclavian artery exposure. 83,87,94,98-104 Stent grafts have effectively treated pseudoaneurysms, lacerations, AVFs, and complete transections of the subclavian artery and theoretically reduce the incidence of brachial plexus injury since dissection of the traumatized field has been eliminated. 81,101,105 An interventional consideration unique to the subclavian artery has been the presence of branch vessels that may be covered by the stent graft and provide a source for endoleak. If contralateral vertebral artery patency and antegrade flow have been visualized, these branch vessels may often be coil embolized.<sup>81</sup> If the vertebral artery cannot be safely occluded, however, a vertebral-carotid transposition should be completed before deployment of the stent graft.<sup>104</sup> Alternatively, stent-graft repair of the subclavian artery may cover an internal thoracic artery that has been used as a pedicled graft for coronary artery bypass grafting, placing the patient at risk for significant cardiac ischemia. Postprocedure antiplatelet therapy has consisted of Plavix for 1 to 3 months followed by lifelong aspirin therapy. 104 Repetitive compression of the stent graft between the clavicle and first rib over the lifespan of a young trauma patient creates the risk of stent fracture (Fig. 51-9). Therefore, long-term follow-up with serial imaging is required.<sup>87</sup> Both stenosis and stent fracture, although often asymptomatic, have been treated with balloon dilation and deployment of an additional stent such that open intervention may still be avoided.81,102

## THE DESCENDING THORACIC AORTA

## Mechanism of Injury

Traumatic aortic disruptions typically occur in motor vehicle drivers, passengers, or pedestrians hit by vehicles. 25,106,107 Alcohol or other substance abuse is involved in greater than 40% of these motor vehicle accidents. 107 Patients ejected from the vehicle are twice as likely to sustain traumatic aortic injury, and seatbelt use can decrease this risk fourfold. 107 Overall, seatbelts have been demonstrated to be more effective than airbags at preventing blunt aortic injury, and aortic rupture of both the ascending and descending aorta has been attributed to the deployment of an airbag. 108-110 Falls from significant height, crush injuries, and airplane accidents have also caused aortic rupture. 22,25,106,111 The pathogenesis of aortic transection remains controversial and no integrated understanding of these forces has been achieved. The "whiplash" theory proposes that a combination of traction, torsion, shear, and bursting forces interact owing to differential deceleration of tissues within the mediastinum, thereby causing adequate stress to rupture the aorta at the isthmus. 107,112-116 The ligamentum arteriosum, the left main stem bronchus, and the paired intercostal arteries limit aortic mobility. Investigations have shown that displacement of the aorta in a longitudinal direction may cause a tear at the isthmus. 114 Alternatively, the "osseous pinch" mechanism has been proposed based on quantifiable thoracic compression. 117,118 With this mechanism, anterior thoracic osseous structures (manubrium, first rib, and clavicular heads) rotate posteriorly and inferiorly and may impact the vertebral column, pinching the aortic isthmus and proximal descending thoracic aorta.118 This pinch is theorized to cause shearing of the aorta and some clinical data do support the osseous pinch mechanism.<sup>119</sup> Overall, diversity among the direction and magnitude of forces generated by a blunt traumatic event in patients suffering descending thoracic aortic rupture have prohibited identification of a single pathogenetic mechanism. Traumatic aortic disruptions in the descending thoracic aorta occur most commonly at the aortic isthmus, and an autopsy series identified 54% at this site, with 8% in the ascending aorta, 2% in the arch, and 11% in the distal descending aorta. 120 In those who survive, the periadventitial tissues around the isthmus appear to provide protection against free rupture and allow time for transfer to a hospital; consequently, surgical case series have reported 84 to 97% of aortic ruptures occurring at the isthmus. 25,121-125 The strength of the aortic wall is in its adventitial layer, and despite the increased incidence of transection at the aortic isthmus, there is no evidence to suggest that the adventitia in this area is deficient.<sup>126</sup> Additionally, the structure of the aortic wall surrounding the transection has not demonstrated any defect and atherosclerotic disease does not play a role in this injury. 106,107,120 The transverse transection caused by blunt aortic trauma typically involves all three layers of the wall and the edges may be separated by several centimeters. 106,120 Occasionally, noncircumferential or partial aortic wall disruptions have been described, particularly posteriorly, and

under these circumstances intramural hematomas and focal dissections may occur. 106,120,127

## **Operative Strategies**

BTAI has traditionally undergone open repair with interposition graft placement, and this approach has proved to be safe, effective, and durable, thereby establishing it as the standard with which new repair strategies should be compared. Mortality after an open repair has been approximated at 20%, and the morbidity rate may be as high as 14%, largely attributable to the incidence of spinal cord ischemia. 128 The popularity of endovascular stent grafting (EVSG) or TEVAR of traumatic aortic disruptions has grown immensely in the current era because of expected decreases in operating room time, complication rate, morbidity, and mortality. 129,130 A prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter trial of endovascular aortic repair using Valiant Captivia for BTAI (RESCUE) reports on 50 patients with BTAI. These patients were enrolled between April 2010 and January 2012. All-cause mortality within 1 year was 12%. There were no conversions to open repair. There were no device-related adverse events. This study demonstrated that TEVAR has favorable early midterm outcomes in the treatment of BTAI. The authors conclude that TEVAR remains the treatment modality of choice; however, the longevity of the stent grafts in this patient population has yet to be established. 129 As such this approach is particularly attractive in multitrauma patients, and several institution series have reported good short-term outcomes. 131-139 Many anatomical details must be considered when pursuing TEVAR for traumatic aortic rupture in a young, otherwise healthy patient with a normal-caliber thoracic aorta. The landing zones may not coincide with those expected when the commercially available stent graft was designed for the treatment of aneurysm disease; therefore, successful placement of the stent graft relies on individual surgeon ingenuity and long-term durability of these repairs remains unknown. 129 TEVAR techniques continue to evolve, however, and are not uniformly applicable; therefore, surgeons treating thoracic aortic disruption must be comfortable with conventional open repair techniques.

#### **OPEN REPAIR**

The major controversy regarding open operative repair of blunt aortic trauma involves spinal cord protection. Some still report safety and efficacy with a "clamp-and-sew" technique, whereas the majority of surgeons have successfully reduced the historical 10% paraplegia rate through some form of lower body perfusion to minimize spinal cord and visceral organ ischemia. 25,121,123-125,140,141

### ARTERIAL SUPPLY TO THE SPINAL CORD

Blood supply to the spinal cord relies on three longitudinal arteries, the anterior spinal artery located in the anteriormedian position and supplying 75% of the spinal cord, and the paired posterior spinal arteries located near the nerve roots. Segmental intercostal and lumbar arteries originating from the posterior aspect of the aorta supply a series of unpaired

radicular arteries that subsequently contribute flow to the anterior spinal artery. The vertebral arteries also provide radicular branches to supply the anterior spinal artery; therefore, in addition to the risk of cord ischemia during aortic cross-clamp at the isthmus and associated paraplegia rates, clamping proximal to the left subclavian compromises flow into the left vertebral and further threatens the integrity of the spinal cord. The posterior spinal arteries are supplied by smaller radicular arteries that originate from the aorta at nearly every spinal level. The largest and most significant radicular artery, typically originating at the level of T10 and entering the vertebral column at the first lumbar vertebrae, is the arteria radicularis magna (or artery of Adamkiewicz) and this vessel is essential for spinal cord perfusion in nearly 25% of patients.

## **AORTIC CROSS-CLAMP**

Some groups report low paraplegia rates exclusively using a "clamp-and-sew" technique; however, these results are not widely reproducible and rely on cross-clamp times of less than 30 minutes.<sup>124</sup> Because of its simplicity, this technique may be preferentially employed by the noncardiothoracic surgeon confronted with repair of a blunt aortic injury. Fragility of the aortic wall, anatomical distortion by the periaortic hematoma, and extension of the defect into the left subclavian artery pose significant obstacles and the average cross-clamp time reported in the literature is 41 minutes. 125 Paraplegia rates are greatly reduced and may even approach zero when extracorporeal lower body perfusion techniques are paired with short crossclamp times (Tables 51-3, 51-4, and Fig. 51-10). 25,140-142

### ADJUVANT PERFUSION TECHNIQUES

Elective repair of thoracic or thoracoabdominal aneurysms allows employment of several techniques to minimize spinal cord ischemia, but the preoperative preparation required to monitor somatosensory evoked potentials, provide lumbar cerebrospinal fluid drainage, or achieve epidural cooling is typically not available in the trauma setting. 141,143-145 Hypothermic circulatory arrest techniques have been successfully applied to injuries involving the arch, but are not

practical when partial bypass systems are employed. 146,147 The system used by any one group should be routine; however, it is important to be well versed in the various lower body perfusion systems because distinct circumstances may require alterations in practice. Intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring of both the upper and lower limbs should be performed with a goal perfusion pressure of 60 to 70 mm Hg.<sup>148</sup> Systemic heparinization poses a significant risk of hemorrhage in the trauma patient, particularly in those with severe lung or intracranial injuries. Use of a centrifugal pump with heparin-bonded tubing and active partial left heart bypass or use of a heparin-bonded passive shunt is an option that does not require systemic heparinization. 148,149 Alternatively, safe use of partial left heart bypass with full systemic heparinization has been reported as well. 150,151 For partial left heart bypass, pump inflow is established by cannulating the left atrium through the left inferior pulmonary vein using a small single- or dual-stage cannula (Fig. 51-11). Pulmonary

FIGURE 51-11 Diagram showing a typical setup for partial left heart bypass in a patient with aortic disruption at the isthmus.

venous cannulation near its confluence with the left atrium has demonstrated a lower complication rate than cannulation of the left atrial appendage. 152 Arterial cannulation may occur through the distal descending aorta or the femoral artery. Distal aortic cannulation has the advantage of convenience and speed. Partial left heart bypass serves several purposes: (1) to unload the left heart and control proximal hypertension at the time of cross-clamping; (2) to maintain lower body perfusion; (3) to allow rapid infusion of volume; and (4) to control (remove) intravascular volume. Lower body mean arterial pressure should be maintained

at 60 to 70 mm Hg and this can typically be accomplished with a perfusion flow rate of 2 to 3 L/min. Mean arterial pressures from 70 to 80 mm Hg are generated in the upper body by the native heart and ventricular arrhythmias remain a significant risk. The pump reservoir and/or cell saver are employed to return blood from the field and a heat exchanger can be used to maintain core temperatures above 35°C. If the system is used without systemic heparinization, however, heat exchangers and oxygenators should be removed from the circuit to minimize surface area and thrombotic risks.

In full or partial cardiopulmonary bypass, a long venous catheter with multiple side holes may be introduced through the left common femoral vein and placed in the right atrium with a guidewire. Alternatively, direct right atrial cannulation at the inferior vena cava-right atrial junction may be accomplished from a left thoracotomy by simple, transverse, inferior pericardiotomy below the left phrenic nerve. Right atrialfemoral arterial bypass has also been used with or without an oxygenator-like partial left heart bypass. A partial arterial oxygen pressure of 40 mm Hg has been reported in nonoxygenated circuits, a level shown to be sufficient for lower body tissue oxygenation when the hemoglobin is maintained at 10 g/dL.153 In cases of aortic arch injury, full cardiopulmonary bypass is beneficial. 154,155 Partial or complete bypass may be established before entering the chest by pursuing right femoral venous to arterial bypass, a technique particularly advantageous when a concomitant right lung contusion inhibits oxygenation. In cases of aortic arch transection in proximity to the innominate or left common carotid, anterior exposure via sternotomy or thoracosternotomy may offer better exposure for total arch replacement under deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA). 154,155 Use of HCA in trauma patients poses significant bleeding risks; therefore, aortic injuries requiring this technique may be appropriate for anti-impulse therapy and a delay in repair until other concomitant injuries have been addressed. Additionally, aortic valvular insufficiency must be ruled out. When HCA is used within the left chest, the left ventricle should be vented through the left atrium. A passive (Gott) shunt has been described where the proximal and distal ends of a heparin-coated polyvinyl tube are placed in the ascending aorta or arch and the descending aorta or femoral artery, respectively. Ventricular cannulation had been used in the past; however, it was abandoned because of a high rate of ventricular dysrhythmias, reduced shunt flows, and a higher rate of paraplegia. 156,157 Flow through this fixed tube is dependent on a pressure gradient and this inability to control flow is the main disadvantage of the Gott shunt.<sup>157</sup> Moreover, it offers no left ventricular unloading or loading advantage, as partial bypass systems do; therefore, blood pressure control is left to pharmacology alone.

## **Operative Techniques**

The patient is positioned in the right lateral decubitus position with the left groin prepped for arterial and venous access.

A right radial arterial line is preferred to avoid losing arterial pressure tracing if occlusion of the left subclavian artery is required during the repair. Use of a pulmonary arterial catheter is optional. Selective ventilation of the right lung is required. A standard fourth interspace posterolateral thoracotomy with or without fifth rib notching usually provides excellent exposure to the aortic isthmus and proximal descending aorta. The incision should be long enough to facilitate dissection of the descending aorta below the level of the inferior pulmonary vein and dissection of the arch of the aorta between the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries. In a patient with a prior left thoracotomy, the associated scarring offers both an advantage and disadvantage to the patient. The adhesions between the lung and mediastinum help contain the rupture, making it less likely to exsanguinate. Dissection near the isthmus or tear should be avoided until both proximal and distal aortic control is established. Depending on the stability of the patient, lower body perfusion can be established before aortic exposure by gaining access to the left groin. If cannulation is planned in the chest, the left inferior pulmonary veinleft atrial junction is dissected and cannulated, in addition to arterial cannulation of the distal descending thoracic aorta or left common femoral vein. Excessive compression or traction of the lung should be avoided, particularly when dissecting out the aortic arch, because the left pulmonary artery may be easily disrupted at this location. Distal control is obtained first, usually by fairly simple passage of a blunt instrument or finger around the descending aorta at the distal margin of the hematoma. Care must be taken not to avulse intercostal arterial branches with this maneuver. The subclavian artery is isolated next. Great care is taken to avoid injury to either the phrenic or vagus nerves as they pass over the aortic arch, which can be difficult because they are often obscured by the hematoma. They should be reflected off the aorta with the overlying pleura and retracted medially by attaching stay sutures to the pleura just lateral to the vagus nerve. Loops around the nerves themselves should be avoided, as even stretch of these nerves can result in paresis. This reflection exposes the arch of the aorta between the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries, which is the point needed for proximal aortic control in the majority of cases. Inferiorly, the vagus nerve and its branching left recurrent laryngeal nerve are reflected medially as well. This exposes the ligamentum arteriosum, which can be sharply divided, but usually this step is not required. Careful dissection is then undertaken between the left common carotid artery and left subclavian artery using a combination of sharp and gentle finger dissection to completely encircle the aortic arch with an umbilical tape. As with distal aortic control, the periaortic hematoma facilitates this dissection considerably. There should be no dissection distal to either the left subclavian or the ligamentum in order to avoid free disruption of the hematoma. Lower body perfusion is initiated, and once systemic blood pressure is stabilized the left subclavian artery is clamped (if necessary) followed by the proximal aorta. With modern imaging techniques, it is usually possible to predict, to the millimeter, exactly where the aortic tear is in order to avoid involving it in

the proximal clamp. The distal aorta is clamped last. Traumatic aortic disruptions that occur in close proximity (<1 cm) from the left subclavian artery portend a higher mortality risk and greater operative difficulty than injuries further away from the left subclavian ostium. 154 Upper and lower body pressures are stabilized with the bypass circuit to maintain upper body mean arterial pressures of 70 to 80 mm Hg and a lower body pressure of 60 to 70 mm Hg with flows of 2 to 3 L/min. The periaortic hematoma is then entered, and the edges of the transected aorta are identified. Usually the aorta is completely transected, and the edges are separated by 2 to 4 cm. 106,120 Less frequently, the transection is partial. Some authors advocate primary repair at this point. 156,158 However, we advocate placing a short interposition graft after debridement of the torn edges in all cases. 151,159,160 Collagen-coated woven polyester grafts or gelatin-impregnated grafts are used most commonly. Use of intraluminal prostheses has been abandoned by most groups. 161 Grafts are sewn using a running polypropylene suture with the proximal anastomosis performed first, followed by the distal. Generous amounts of adventitial tissue are included in each bite. If the proximal anastomosis is done under HCA, cardiopulmonary bypass and reperfusion of the arch should be reinstituted immediately after completion of the proximal anastomosis for optimal neurocerebral protection. This requires cannulation of the graft just beyond the proximal anastomosis (branched grafts are useful here for recannulation), and then the distal anastomosis is completed using a dual arterial-inflow perfusion setup perfusing the arch and lower body simultaneously. The left subclavian can either be incorporated into the proximal anastomosis or grafted separately as appropriate. If it is discovered that the tear extends above the proximal aortic clamp, an attempt can be made to dissect more proximally and place a second clamp provided the left common carotid artery is not compromised. If this is not possible, the best recourse is to cannulate the aortic arch in addition to the distal arterial cannula, commence full cardiopulmonary bypass through both arterial routes, and perform the proximal anastomosis during a brief period of profound HCA. We cool to 20°C and use cerebral protection adjuncts, including packing the head in ice and 15 mg/kg sodium thiopental intravenously. One must be prepared to vent the left ventricular apex if distention occurs as a result of cooling induced ventricular fibrillation. A continuous short-axis view by transesophageal echocardiography is very useful is this circumstance. If the aorta is already ruptured with bleeding into the hemithorax, proximal aortic dissection between the left carotid and subclavian arteries is rapidly performed, and a cross-clamp quickly applied. The descending aorta is then clamped below the injury, and the hematoma opened. No attempt is made to establish lower body perfusion, but every attempt is made at maintaining adequate mean arterial pressure during clamping. The aortic repair is done as expeditiously as possible to minimize clamp time. Repair sutures are placed accordingly after clamps are removed. Hemostasis is achieved after continuity of the aorta is re-established. Occasionally, the aortic tear will extend into the left subclavian orifice. In this case the proximal clamp may have to partially or totally occlude the left common carotid. The left subclavian

can then be completely detached from the aorta, the proximal anastomosis completed, and the clamp then moved distally onto the graft. The left subclavian is then reattached to the aortic graft with an interposition graft after completing the distal aortic anastomosis. The left subclavian interposition graft is fashioned with an end-to-end anastomosis distally and an end-to-side anastomosis proximally.

## Endovascular Stent Grafting/Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair

Use of endovascular techniques to treat abdominal aortic aneurysms began in 1991 and has subsequently been expanded to degenerative thoracic aortic aneurysms. In trauma patients with blunt aortic injury, this technology was initially applied to patients considered extremely high risk for open repair, such as those with a head injury, abdominal visceral injury, or severe pulmonary contusions. 53,54,137,162 The safety and efficacy of this procedure has since been demonstrated and EVSG is considered the preferred method of treatment by many groups. 52,131,132,134-139,162-170 Theoretical advantages of stent grafting include avoidance of thoracotomy, one-lung ventilation, the systemic effects of cardiopulmonary bypass, aortic cross-clamping, and spinal cord ischemia, which should decrease perioperative mortality and complications. 6,129,132,134,135,137-139,162,171-175

In patients with stable aortic injuries (grade II or III), the timing of intervention is usually dictated by the severity of associated nonaortic injuries. With proper anti-impulse control, delayed management of BTAI until life-threatening nonaortic injuries have been treated has been shown to be a safe and beneficial approach. 47,176 The optimal timing of aortic repair has continued to evolve as the treatment of BTAI has shifted from open aortic repair to TEVAR. The minimally invasive nature of TEVAR has allowed for earlier aortic repair in stable patients, emergent treatment of unstable patients, and easier concomitant management of both aortic and nonaortic injuries. In patients without other serious injuries, the trend has been to treat grade II or III injuries within 24 hours of admission to avoid progression to rupture (grade IV) and the potential deleterious effects of aggressive impulse control in certain patient populations.

Several anatomical considerations must be addressed when deciding whether a patient is a candidate for TEVAR of a blunt aortic transection. A proximal landing zone of at least 1.5 cm is considered necessary to achieve a reliable seal, raising the concern of left arm ischemia if the left subclavian artery needs to be covered; however, this has not been observed. <sup>136,165</sup> In the rare case of symptomatic left arm ischemia, elective carotid to subclavian bypass may be performed. <sup>165</sup> A recent study from Texas demonstrated no statistically significant difference in physical health scores between left subclavian artery coverage and uncovered TEVAR for traumatic aortic injury and hence coverage of the left subclavian artery appears safe and does not impair normal activities. <sup>166</sup> The left subclavian artery origin is also a good marker for an area of acute angulation of the proximal descending aorta and the wall stents used

in early TEVAR procedures often became distorted in this region. 177,178 Newer flexible stents have overcome this issue. Additionally, the graft diameter should be oversized 10 to 20% for appropriate seating. 133,136 The size of the chosen graft will determine the route of placement. Early procedures used grafts designed as extension cuffs for abdominal aortic grafts, and these devices had delivery systems 65 cm in length, necessitating iliac or distal aortic access. 133,138 Those frequently reported in the literature include the Gore Excluder (W.L. Gore and Associates, Flagstaff, AZ), AneuRx (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, CA), and Zenith (Cook, Inc., Indianapolis, IN). These cuff diameters range from 18 to 28 mm, and the lengths range from 3.3 to 3.75 cm, necessitating placement of several cuffs to achieve adequate coverage.<sup>79</sup> Commercially available thoracic aortic stent grafts have been designed for treatment of aneurysm disease. Therefore, the diameters are often too large for the otherwise healthy aorta encountered in a patient with traumatic aortic transection. The Gore TAG (W.L. Gore and Associates, Flagstaff, AZ) fits vessels 23 to 37 mm, and the Talent Valiant (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, CA) may be applied to vessels 20 to 42 mm in diameter, excluding a large percentage of blunt aortic transection victims.<sup>177</sup> The ideal device for repair of traumatic aortic injury would be 16 to 40 mm in diameter, be available in 5-, 10-, and 15-cm lengths, and conform to a 90-degree curvature without deformation. Additionally, the delivery system should be distally flexible and approximately 80 to 90 cm in length.<sup>79</sup> A recent study by Canaud and colleagues compared the conformability of the four commercially available thoracic devices with increasing aortic arch angulation and oversizing. All secondgeneration devices performed significantly better than their respective predecessors. Both the Valiant and the C-TAG devices performed well, with complete wall apposition and arch angulation up to 140° and 120°, respectively. 179

Patients who will undergo TEVAR for traumatic aortic disruption should be positioned supine in a hybrid operating room/angiosuite or conventional operating room table with fluoroscopic capabilities. General endotracheal anesthesia is typically employed. Conversion to open repair is rare, but has occurred because of postdeployment stent migration; therefore, the operative team must be prepared for rapid conversion. 180 Retrograde aortic access is accomplished percutaneously or by cutdown on the femoral or iliac artery depending on the chosen stent graft. A floppy tipped J-wire should be advanced into the aorta under fluoroscopic guidance with subsequent placement of marked catheter. An aortogram should be obtained in steep left anterior oblique projection to clearly visualize the arch. The details of the aortic injury and device measurements are obtained from a computed tomography angiography (CTA) during operative planning, but the intraoperative aortogram is vital to confirming appropriate anatomy for TEVAR and selection of the correct device. Additionally, the length of graft coverage is determined by this intraoperative image. Deployments of stent grafts have been successful with and without administration of systemic heparin (Fig. 51-12). 181 Intravascular ultrasound may be a useful adjunct when determining coverage length

and graft diameter. 182,183 Based on the proximity to the aortic injury, the left subclavian artery may need to be covered, and if covered, it may need to be embolized and bypassed or transposed to the left common carotid artery to ensure a proximal graft seal and avoid problems of ischemia to the left arm or vertebrobasilar system. 138,184-186 Despite whether single or multiple graft devices have been deployed, successful exclusion of the pseudoaneurysm has been accomplished in 90 to 100% of patients reported in the literature. 136-138,187 Decreased operating room time, diminished physiologic derangement and hypothermia, decreased transfusion rates, and shorter intensive care unit and overall hospital stays have been documented in series directly comparing open and endovascular repair of blunt traumatic aortic injury. 137,138,180 Procedure-related paraplegia and mortality rates are also markedly reduced to nearly zero. 137,138,180 Long-term surveillance is recommended to evaluate for endoleak, stent migration, or delayed pseudoaneurysm formation with annual CTA. The optimal follow-up strategy is evolving as imaging technology continues to improve. Also long-term experience grows. In general, CTA is utilized at 1, 3, and 12 months. The individual follow-up strategy is usually tailored to the patient. In the absence of endoleak or endograft collapse or migration on those initial studies, repeat imaging is usually performed every 3 to 5 years.

## The Future

With the development of newer-generation devices leading to improved outcomes and less endograft-related complications, TEVAR has established itself as the primary treatment for

most patients with thoracic aortic injuries. Future iterations of devices should include shorter lengths and smaller and more precise deployment mechanisms. The potential ability to redeploy the same endograft will make this a very adaptable technique. The use of TEVAR in traumatically injured patients continues to evolve, and TEVAR has supplanted open surgical repair as the primary treatment for BTAIs in most centers. Since the release of the Society of Vascular Surgery clinical guidelines,<sup>4</sup> many issues have been resolved. Other problems associated with TEVAR for thoracic aortic injuries are evolving as this chapter is being written, with improved newer-generation devices. Soon enough, a time will come where most interventions for treatment of acute injuries to the aorta and its great vessels are undertaken by TEVAR with open surgical techniques being discussed in historical chapters.
